<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621744430">About religion and interests and preference and hard-wiring, here&#39;s something <br/>
to think about by Dean Sluyter.  I&#39;ve mentioned him.  I&#39;ll mention him again. <br/>
 I have a tie-in for you for the poop thread (later).  He has a website.<br/>
<br/>
www.cosmicbook.com<br/>
<br/>
So, from _The Zen Commandments_, page 94-95 (with *x* for italics; sorry)...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Our impulse toward devotion, I suspect, is so deeply ingrained that we all <br/>
look for objects toward which to direct it.  We&#39;re built for it the way birds <br/>
are built for flight; without millions of devotees, neither Beatlemania nor <br/>
the Roman Republic could have happened.  So the question is not *wheher* but <br/>
to *what* or *whom* you will be devoted.  By harnessing our natural tendency <br/>
toward devotion and pointing it toward an appropriate object, we can put it <br/>
to the service of liberation.  We can kiss the frog of warty, flawed <br/>
existence, freeing it--and ourselves--from the spell.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is not merely an emotional or attitudinal shift, but a perceptual <br/>
transformation.  When I was ten years old I was a devoted coin collector and <br/>
experienced this in a small way.  Pennies, the most worthless of coins, began <br/>
to reveal a greater value and beauty.  Through my focused enthusiasm (love) <br/>
for them, I literally started to see aspects I hadn&#39;t seen before:  this one <br/>
was in Extremely Fine condition because all the lines in the wheat stalks <br/>
were clear and sharp, that one was rare because it had the designer&#39;s <br/>
initials (V.D.B.) on the reverse.  My enhanced perception of the coins in <br/>
turn fed my love for them, which further enhanced my perception, which in <br/>
turn fed my love. . .<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In this way devotion becomes self-perpeuating.  If you just stay with it, <br/>
keep opening to the same object, your appreciation grows without limit.  You <br/>
many have experienced this with your children, your country, your work, your <br/>
art.  If you&#39;re a devoted musician, you hear subtleties of rhythm and timbre <br/>
that other people don&#39;t; if you&#39;re an artist, you keep seeing light, shapes, <br/>
and colors in new, vivid ways; if you&#39;re a fly fisherman, you know things <br/>
about the river that can&#39;t be put into words.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;in principle, it doesn&#39;t matter what the object of devotion is.  If we focus <br/>
steadfastly on any wave it will evenually be revealed as ocean.&quot;  <br/>
