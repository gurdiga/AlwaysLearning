Margaux loves optical illusions.  When she is seriously agitated and out to agitate others, pulling up an optical illusions site has always calmed her right down.  There is something very relaxing and engaging in optical illusions.  She&#39;ll spend hours looking through them.<br/>
 <br/>
We have a poster of M. C. Escher&#39;s Waterfall hanging in our bedroom.  This is what Margaux wakes up to everyday, as it&#39;s right next to where she sleeps.  She loves M. C. Escher because of this and it is a huge part of what has inspired her to love optical illusions.<br/>
