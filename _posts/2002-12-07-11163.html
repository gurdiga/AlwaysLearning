<div id="ygrps-yiv-180234736">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a little issue with a neighbor. For 4 years now our neighbor&#39;s<br/>
throw a party for her daughter. This year she will turn 10. Both my daughters<br/>
8 and 3 and son 6 all play with this girl. I&#39;ve picked her up from school, we<br/>
swap baby sitting at times. For the past few years these birthday parties have<br/>
been &quot;girl&quot; parties, so naturally Riley was left out. He throws major fits<br/>
about this, says all kinds of rude things, which are kinda true, and basically<br/>
I have a long bad day trying to help him cope with being left out. The party<br/>
is tommorrow. Again my oldest has been invited. Now my 3 too is chimming in I<br/>
want to go too. So I called and asked if it was a family  party where all of<br/>
us can come celebrate Cassie&#39;s B-day. I was told it is just for the older<br/>
ones.  3 other friends from the block are invited, as well as 2 other boys my<br/>
son plays great with, one the party girls 7 year old cousin.So it&#39;s not a<br/>
girls only party this year. I have such a hard time with arbitrary age cut<br/>
off. Now this year Riley 6 can not go because he is not old enough. The party<br/>
is right across the street. Many aunts, uncles, other important grown-ups will<br/>
be there. Two things I&#39;m asking about. How to comfort my kids when faced with<br/>
being left out? And how to politely let my friend know that inviting 1 of my<br/>
kids is torture and it&#39;s either all of us or none of us. I have played her<br/>
game now 3 times and I&#39;m fed up with her excuses. Riley will remember not<br/>
being invited and flip out again and again in June in September. He is<br/>
passionate. So I left the phone with my neighbor saying no I don&#39;t think we<br/>
want all the kids over, but I&#39;ll ask Cassie, it&#39;s her party. Do I even wait to<br/>
be included or simply say thank you for listening, I think we all will go to<br/>
the beach tommorow. <br/>

Take them somewhere--a movie, Christmas shopping, somewhere else.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not a game, it&#39;s real.<br/>
The reality is they have the right to invite who they want to.<br/>
Will you deprive your older daughter over a principle which isn&#39;t yours to <br/>
own?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying life doesn&#39;t suck.  I&#39;m just saying we can&#39;t keep it from <br/>
sucking, nor can we make other people think our thoughts.  <br/>
<br/>
We can easily  make it suck worse by our responses to the situations, though.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I think we all will go to<br/>

Well one was invited to a party.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332267946">I&#39;d ask if my oldest could come over a little early as I am taking the rest <br/>
of the family out to a movie and then to the beach/museum/hot dog <br/>
diner/other kid-magnet-place.  10 to one odds that your oldest child will <br/>
want to come too.  (grin)<br/>
<br/>
I have a similar situation where the mother and I are friends, the kids all <br/>
play together, but my son is typically invited to only one of her <br/>
children&#39;s parties, not the other even though he typically invites both of <br/>
her kids to his parties.  It&#39;s not a big deal for him because he knows the <br/>
other friend usually has a limit to the number of people he can invite.  I <br/>
suppose it&#39;s harder when you&#39;re only 6.<br/>

party. What if the moms of those 5 kids called up and said the siblings of<br/>
the invited ones were putting up a fuss because they hadn&#39;t been invited.<br/>
And the moms wanted you and your daughter to invite the siblings because<br/>
they&#39;d have a miserable day if they couldn&#39;t come too. Wouldn&#39;t it stop<br/>
being a special day for your daughter and start being a throw a party for<br/>
everyone who would feel left out if they weren&#39;t invited? Wouldn&#39;t you feel<br/>
that it was the parents problem to figure out how to help the kids handle<br/>
the disappointment of not being invited and not your problem?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a game she&#39;s playing. She&#39;s protecting her daughter&#39;s right to have<br/>
the birthday she plans. She&#39;s protecting her own right to not have more kids<br/>
than she feels she can handle.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like a natural opportunity to learn that our happiness depends on<br/>
how we choose to deal with things, not on what the world chooses to do to<br/>
us.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to agree here...we just went through this, but from the other side. My soon<br/>
to be 6 year old decided that he wanted an all boy party this year. He has two girl<br/>
friends that he has known for ages and I felt like we had to invite them...I posted<br/>
on the unschooling.com list and got a bit better perspective. I realized that it <br/>
really was Jason&#39;s party and that he should not be made to invite anyone that he<br/>
did not want to.<br/>
<br/>
We decided that we would see if the girls wanted to get together one on one with<br/>
my son, go for ice cream or something. I have talked to one mom who completely<br/>
understood....her daughter is probably having a princess party this year and so<br/>
we may not be invited either. :o)<br/>
<br/>
And as far as younger siblings...that is a hard one too...we are having Jason&#39;s<br/>
party at the gym where he takes gymnastics...they have told me that it is ok<br/>
for me to have his almost 3 yo brother come, but asked that no other younger<br/>
siblings be included because it would make it harder on the instructors (younger<br/>
children require much more supervision on the gym equipment...I will be supervising<br/>
my youngest).<br/>
<br/>
I would just explain to my kids not to take it personally, that the party is planned<br/>
for older kids. I would let my oldest go (if she wants to) and plan something fun for<br/>
the younger kids. Maybe your younger two would like to invite the birthday girl<br/>
over for some ice cream to wish her a happy birthday? <br/>
<br/>
It helped me to remember that a birthday party should be for and about the child and<br/>
that they should be allowed to invite who they want, not who their parent&#39;s feel they<br/>
should...<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124370455">I&#39;ve been thinking about this for a couple of days, even though by now I<br/>
know the point is moot. I wonder, though - say you and your husband got<br/>
together regularly with two other couples and went out to dinner, or to<br/>
the theater, or whatever you like... and that one of the other people in<br/>
the group decided to have a party and invite her partner, the other<br/>
couple, and your partner - but not you. And everyone talked about the<br/>
planned party at other times, when you were all together, and they knew<br/>
you wanted to come, and the reasoning was something like: &quot;Well, everyone<br/>
else is in their forties and you&#39;re only thirty-nine&quot;. I think that would<br/>
really, really suck.<br/>
<br/>
I was talking to Rain about it, too, and she wondered about Ashley&#39;s take<br/>
on it. She said that in most families she knows, the siblings fight with<br/>
each other a lot but get very protective of each other if someone else is<br/>
hurting one of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-319915064">Thanks everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still working out my own feelings on this one. Do I have a friend or just<br/>
a friendly neighbor? I have a sister-in-law who leaves people out constantly.<br/>
Do these people know how much sadness occurs on the other end. I know not<br/>
everyone can go to every party. I do not complain when someone invites one<br/>
child to something. This situation is different. The party was physically<br/>
across the street. All the kids on the block talked about it for over a wek.<br/>
Each time the party was brought up my passionate son screams how unfair it is<br/>
that every else gets to go but him. He screams how much he hates the mom and<br/>
the girl. He plans how to hurt them back. Well when I have my party...4 years<br/>
now this has happened. I have expressed to my neighbor how hurt Riley feels.<br/>
She has seen him cry. Last year she promised Riley(then 4) something, forgot,<br/>
then gave him 2 pixie sticks. He cried cuz all the party people had 3. She<br/>
told him to say thank you, stop crying and be thankful for getting something<br/>
at all. Some people do not feel for kids. Isn&#39;t that what makes us different<br/>
than main stream. We know kids are people too. We respect them. When they hurt<br/>
we listen. So I was reflecting Sandra. She origainally said yup, some people<br/>
do suck, I took this to mean, some people are cold, unfeeling people who can<br/>
hurt others with their actions.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Dar, I too had a similar idea. To put the situation in perspective.<br/>
To invite a portion of a family based on age or interest. Well, I need to go.<br/>
I&#39;m sure my neighbor and I will talk again, but I&#39;m not sure how much I&#39;m<br/>
going to give to the friendship anymore. Too many times someone in my family<br/>
comes home with hurt feelings from their house.</div>

Either way, that doesn&#39;t mean she&#39;ll like every child in your family equally.<br/>

Holly has a friend who&#39;s a girl with both an older and younger brother.  <br/>
Holly LOVES the younger brother but is very uncomfortable around the older <br/>
one.  Twice she has wanted to invite the girl and little brother to a party, <br/>
but only invited the girl because she couldn&#39;t figure out how to invite one <br/>
brother without the other.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-762555519">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
It has been very nice to write out my thoughts and receive thoughtful<br/>
responses to my party problem. Now, I&#39;m working on the idea that Riley needs a<br/>
bit of help handling his dissapointments. If he was not so bugged by the<br/>
situation, I would not be. He has shed gallons of tears about this party<br/>
situation over the past 4 years. He hurts, will always have a scar. Tim<br/>
believes he should stay away because he does get his feelings hurt somehow. He<br/>
is high energy. <br/>
<br/>
This year I asked if all the family was invited, meaning I would come too. It<br/>
was a dance party. Riley is a dancing guy. He would have been fine from my<br/>
perspective and I was not asking to drop my kiddoes off. I too wanted to<br/>
celebrate and be with my older child, but...opted to stay home with my younger<br/>
2 and hubby, as we clearly were not wanted. We do feel this family doesn&#39;t<br/>
like Riley. They think we should spank him into line and not let him cry. He&#39;s<br/>
loud. This family had only 1 child until last year. They now have 3, blessed<br/>
with twin daughters.<br/>
<br/>
So back to my dilemna. When Riley doesn&#39;t get what he wants, like going to the<br/>
party, his intensity about the situation is unbelievable. The yelling,<br/>
screaming, swearing, pounding of fists. For example, yesterday at a group<br/>
activity we were going to play a version of go fish. It&#39;s a unit study group<br/>
who are raising Salmon. We were going to match lifecycle with habitat. Riley<br/>
did not like this idea. I suggested he go play while we played the game and<br/>
said I would play the way he wanted to after. He did not like this. He likes<br/>
his way first always. He punched me in the stomach 2 times. So again, he<br/>
didn&#39;t get his way so he lashed out. He then did go sit outside, alone, cooled<br/>
off, and came in to watch. I thanked him for taking himself outside and told<br/>
him in private my stomach hurt and I do not like to be punched. He said sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas about intense reactions to dissapointments?<br/>

<br/>
This just came in the mail:<br/>
<br/>
-=- One of my favorite stories <br/>
recently is about a Native American grandfather talking to his young <br/>
grandson.  He tells the boy he has two wolves inside of him<br/>
struggling with each other. The first is the wolf of peace, love and <br/>
kindness. The other wolf is fear, greed and hatred.  &quot;Which wolf will <br/>
win, grandfather?&quot; asks the young boy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-   &quot;Whichever one I feed,&quot; is the reply.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(That&#39;s from something I&#39;ll send separately.)<br/>
<br/>
When someone&#39;s not liking my kids, sometimes I&#39;ve told them, &quot;I bet he&#39;ll <br/>
like you when you&#39;re older&quot; (or when he&#39;s older, or when you&#39;re both older) <br/>
and it has come true so many times that they believe me.<br/>
<br/>
If you go with and toward what IS possible instead of dwelling on what is not <br/>
possible, the negativity is being fed, and watered, and enshrined.  If he&#39;s <br/>
as upset after four years as you say he is, I think maybe someone&#39;s been <br/>
counting and reviewing the situation.  <br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s difficult for YOU to handle when he&#39;s disappointed, and if he has <br/>
ever kicked you in the stomach, then the neighbor absolutely wasn&#39;t playing a <br/>
game not to invite him.  <br/>
<br/>
Is he still small enough that you can carry him around?  When I&#39;ve had kids <br/>
losing it, I &quot;hipped&quot; them and carried them around with me.  If they wanted <br/>
down after they were calm, they could go, but if they seemed a danger to <br/>
others, I just casually plunked them back in the hip-carry.  From there you <br/>
can whisper advice and reminders, and you can point out potential good <br/>
situations for them to try to slip back into, and give them last minute ideas <br/>
on making it work out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Any ideas about intense reactions to dissapointments?-=-<br/>
<br/>
How much is he like you in that area?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re grown and are having a hard time with it, maybe figure out how you <br/>
handle it, and pass those tricks on to him.<br/>

towards you it sounds like it&#39;s possible there may have been some<br/>
uncomfortable incidents at their house that she hasn&#39;t told you about. Her<br/>
inability to meet your eyes when you asked about Riley coming to the party<br/>
may not have been because she recognized she was being rude but because she<br/>
felt caught between being assumed to be rude by excluding him and coming<br/>
across as ... a tattletale? complainer? ...  for telling you the things<br/>
Riley has done at her house.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d probably feel very uncomfortable with even a high energy boy in the<br/>
hosue. Our is set up to accomodate a relatively quiet girl. There are things<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL even a mother of high energy boys can occasionally find it a &quot;little&quot;<br/>
stressful.<br/>
Today I had to call a friend and go have a long lunch in an outdoor cafe<br/>
just to stop myself taking a kitchen knife and stabbing 2 soccer balls and<br/>
a big birthing ball. Living in an apartment in a city with 3 boys who love<br/>
to kick balls around usually doesn&#39;t bother me but today I was almost in<br/>
tears at the level of stress it seemed to enact within me. Of course it<br/>
could be related to the fact I&#39;m 2 days past my due date and so huge and<br/>
waddling with the next future wrestler and football player:)<br/>
<br/>
But it can be tricky to take your kids to someone&#39;s house (or public area)<br/>
who doesn&#39;t have the same kind of set-up. I think it&#39;s my responsibility<br/>
though to discuss this with my kids beforehand and then to set limits on<br/>
their behavior once there. If the place is not a wrestling or running<br/>
environment then it is my duty as their parent to help them to restrain<br/>
themselves. It&#39;s a matter of explaining consequences and setting firm<br/>
boundaries. Plus if I see they are not capable of this then I need to<br/>
remove us from the situation. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196682887">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Interesting converation in my car last night. We had just finished a book club<br/>
meeting and Ashley spoke about a boy who invited everyone in her class except<br/>
her to his party. Riley, Cassie( the party girl who did not extend an invite<br/>
to Riley last week)Riley and Kelly(a kid from the block) were all in the car.<br/>
I asked Ashley how she felt about this. She talked for a bit about how she<br/>
felt left out, wondered why this boy did not invite her...Then Kelly chimed in<br/>
that someone in her class did the same and how stupid it is to leave someone<br/>
out. Riley started to agree with the girls, said half of Cassie&#39;s name, then<br/>
bit his lip and said nothing. Cassie was in the car. Wow, he had tact like I<br/>
have never seen. I listened only, added nothing to the conversation and was<br/>
very proud of Riley for not attacking Cassie, though I had wondered how she<br/>
would answer if he had put her on the spot and pointed out his most recent<br/>
being left out.<br/>
