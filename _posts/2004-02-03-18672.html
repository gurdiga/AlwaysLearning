<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690714734">Okay, this is fun but very weird.  I just got a big packet of thank you notes <br/>
from the kids in Mo Palmer&#39;s classes at Sandia Prep.   They&#39;re for three <br/>
things, in various combinations. The loan of chain mail (my husband let them use a <br/>
chain mail coif and two or three little samples of different weaves, a few <br/>
weeks back), for copies of coloring pages on medieval topics from coloring books <br/>
I&#39;ve had for years, and for the dictionary game (which is the only work I <br/>
did).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve looked at 8 or 10 of them.  They&#39;re mostly illustrated with art, some <br/>
traced from the medieval coloring books, some hand-done, lots colored with <br/>
colored pencils.  Some are in folded card form (French fold, for card afficionados) <br/>
or just letters, or fancy folds.  Some used markers.  Some are kind of <br/>
calligraphed (untrained-kid-style), some are cursive, some printed.<br/>
<br/>
Some are sealed with stickers or tape, and I&#39;m saving those for Holly to open <br/>
because the packet was to &quot;The Dodd Family,&quot; and I noticed one person <br/>
addressed Holly, so I&#39;ll save the rest until she&#39;s awake.<br/>
<br/>
But here are some interesting quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mrs. Dodd, thank you for playing the dictionary game.  Holly, it was pretty <br/>
cool of you to come and help your mom.  Thanks again.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It was so fun (the dictionary game)...I wish that we had more time so you <br/>
could teach us more.  I just can&#39;t express how much I think you and enjoyed your <br/>
lesson....What you taught us changed my whole idea on history, in a good <br/>
way.&quot;  (That last bit included the chain mail and pictures.)<br/>
<br/>
And this one was just about the dictionary game, and just to me:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thank you for the magnificent job you did for us yesterday.  It must take a <br/>
long time to do what you do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE THAT!  &quot;It must take a long time to do what you do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think that goes with the &quot;How did she LEARN all this stuff?&quot; overheard that <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of writing back and telling them how long I&#39;ve been interested <br/>
in the history of words.  I was nine, and in 4th grade.  I played with <br/>
dictionaries from that time to now.  I read a book on etymology in 4th grade, and just <br/>
kept on whenever I had a chance.  It was &quot;a personal interest.&quot;  A hobby?  <br/>
No, because it was considered scholarly. <br/>
<br/>
I need to figure out how to say that in a useful way to committed-to-school <br/>
kids.  It&#39;s an opportunity to put a good clue into the minds of many receptive <br/>
future parents (and to change their learning perspective on their own learning <br/>
now).   <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When I was in sixth grade, our teacher used to punish the class by making us copy from the dictionary.  I&#39;m sure it was pure misery for some kids, but I never minded it too much.<br/>

<br/>
I told them they should find a word in the dictionary (I took what I had left <br/>
of 20+ year old paperback American Heritage) that showed the etymology, and <br/>
that I could tell them what language it came from.  I said I could do 80%.   <br/>
<br/>
Two classes beat me, I beat two, one was me up by 2 (16 to 18 or so) so <br/>
pretty much a tie (I sure didn&#39;t do 80%!)<br/>
<br/>
So I showed them what languages were most likely to be there (Old Norse,  Old <br/>
French, Old English, Middle English, Latin, Greek) and what the abbreviations <br/>
would be.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a really fast game, and wild, and kids who like orderly classes weren&#39;t <br/>
thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve gone through all the notes now and I saved four more to quote here:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thank you for coming into our class and giving us a very helpful/educational <br/>
lesson.  I have already noticed the signs in another dictionary.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
that my friends will be amazed when I tell them what the signs mean.&quot;   [&quot;signs&quot; <br/>
meaning the etymological symbols]<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thank you so much for the wonderful learning opportunity... It was a nice <br/>
break from all the academic work that we have to do at school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thank you Mrs. Dodd and Holly Dodd.  The game was fun and I enjoyed it so <br/>
much.  It made my head hurt because I had to think about words for a change.  In <br/>
a way I wouldn&#39;t mind for you to come back so we don&#39;t have to do schoolwork, <br/>
but I don&#39;t want my head to hurt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Dear Mr., Mrs., Holly Dodd.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thank you for coming into the class and shwoing us your chain maille.  It <br/>
was quite interesting and also quite heavy.  I wanted somebody to stabb my <br/>
stomach with a sword so I could actually see if the chain worked but knowing how <br/>
mean Mrs. Palmer was &quot;hahaha&quot; she wouldn&#39;t let me do it.  Also thanks for <br/>
playing the dictionary game with us.  It was a challenge and it was really fun.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-P.S. , Holly I am so sorry for calling you a boy.  I took a quick look at <br/>
you and the hair decieved me.  You were extremely nice and friendly though, <br/>
always stay likethat.  Bret.<br/>
<br/>
(He had said &quot;are you her son?&quot; to Holly, who said &quot;I&#39;m her daughter.&quot;  He <br/>
apologized profusely at the time, but Holly&#39;s feelings weren&#39;t hurt.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846148946">LOL I used to search and find the shortest words/definitions I could find. Drove the teachers nuts! Either that, or I&#39;d find some of the longest ones with multiple definitions and drive them nuts because I&#39;d &quot;never&quot; manage to finish it! <br/>
