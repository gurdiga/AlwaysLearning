<div id="ygrps-yiv-707608484">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;My daughters are pretty young &lt;g&gt;. 7 and 4. I&#39;m<br/>
35, so I&#39;m probably on the younger side of the Moms<br/>
here, though as time goes on, I expect I&#39;ll have to<br/>
get used to that not being so.<br/>
<br/>
But my picture&#39;s not up at the website yet, and I<br/>
don&#39;t look young -- I was never carded as a 21 year<br/>
old, no one guessed when I started working that I was<br/>
16, not 19 or 20. I married a guy 10 years older so I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t die of screaming boredom. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Tamzin is 7. I&#39;m 37. It helps me to keep track of my<br/>
age to know that I turned 30 three weeks after Tamzin<br/>
was born &lt;g&gt;. <br/>
I&#39;ve always looked younger than I am though. Most<br/>
people have a hard time pinpointing my age (like I<br/>
said before, I&#39;m a bit &#39;alternative&#39; looking and most<br/>
people associate that with youth). My ex is 3 years<br/>
younger than me (although I was never bored with him<br/>
&lt;g&gt;). <br/>

to stop having red spiky hair and get a &#39;normal&#39; hair style. That I&#39;d<br/>
have to stop wearing combat trousers and heavy metal t-shirts and get<br/>
&#39;normal&#39; clothes.<br/>
:p I said.<br/>
