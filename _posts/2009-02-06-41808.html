<div id="ygrps-yiv-1982083993">Hello--<br/>
<br/>
I just had a play date with a friend and her 2 children - daughter, 2<br/>
yo, and son about 8 months. My daughter is 2 1/2.<br/>
<br/>
I recently posted about my daughter&#39;s current love of Dora. So of<br/>
course it was on this morning when our friends arrived. And we have a<br/>
BIG, HD TV so it is very attention grabbing!<br/>
<br/>
My friend wanted to turn it off. I talked to Marisol about it and<br/>
turned it off and it led to a big emotional reaction, which I was not<br/>
surprised about. I felt bad turning it off, but I also wanted to<br/>
respect my friends wishes. We ended up compromising and I put Dora on<br/>
our laptop where Marisol (and the other little girl) could see it.<br/>
Marisol nursed for a little bit and calmed down and was happy the rest<br/>
of the play date.<br/>
<br/>
However, I know that the mom would have liked even the computer to be<br/>
off. She commented that she has noticed that her daughter is really<br/>
cranky after watching.... AND that the longer she watches the crankier<br/>
she is when it gets turned off. My thoughts were that is because she<br/>
is never allowed to watch (they don&#39;t even own a TV - just a computer)<br/>
and that she really likes it so when she IS allowed she wants more. I<br/>
didn&#39;t say that though.<br/>
<br/>
The awkward part was that the entire time we spent trying to entice<br/>
the little girl away from Dora -- with other toys, music, dancing,<br/>
building, etc. She was always drawn back. Marisol joined in with us<br/>
several times of her own volition. <br/>
<br/>
Overall, even with the awkwardness the play date was really enjoyable.<br/>
I really enjoy talking with this friend. She knows that we differ on<br/>
this issue, I have talked a little bit about not limiting TV. I&#39;m sure<br/>
that she thought it was a bit crazy how upset Marisol was to have it<br/>
turned off though, and that it &quot;proved&quot; what we were doing was wrong<br/>
(whereas in my mind she was reacting strongly because I wasn&#39;t<br/>
listening to her and I normally do). I wonder if I should limit our<br/>
play dates to her house because TV is not an issue there. Or should I<br/>
talk to my friend and just tell her that I&#39;m not going to turn the TV<br/>
off, so if she would prefer not to come here that&#39;s ok??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That sounds like a great idea.<br/>
<br/>
Just because she&#39;s totally wrong doesn&#39;t mean she doesn&#39;t have the  <br/>
right to hear opinion, and to have her house TV-free.     What if she  <br/>
were vegetarian?  I bet you would have fun going to her house for a  <br/>
special vegetarian meal, but she would have ZERO fun at your house  <br/>
trying to enjoy cole slaw while others were having chicken and  <br/>
pork&#39;n&#39;beans.<br/>
<br/>
I think that as the girls get older the issue will fade.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was just talking to a friend about this kind of thing today.  We <br/>
havnt had much issues about t.v. when friends come over, but video <br/>
games sometimes cause issues and I have found it is better to go to the <br/>
other families house or to the park so it isnt an issue.  If the other <br/>
parents are really that against it they would usually prefer that too.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126254914">wow! sandra, that&#39;s some pretty harsh language! i really really really try to think of these <br/>
things not as &quot;right&quot; vs &quot;wrong&quot; but as &quot;decisions that feel right to us&quot; vs &quot;decisions that <br/>
don&#39;t&quot;. i know my opinion of &quot;right&quot; vs &quot;wrong&quot; has changed a lot in the last few yrs.<br/>
<br/>
but what i&#39;d really do, in addition to having playdates at her house or at parks or museums <br/>
or whatever, would be to talk to your daughter about it. as sandra mentions, it&#39;d be kinda <br/>
rude to invite a vegetarian over for a meal and serve meat. we have lots of friends who <br/>
have different &quot;standards&quot; than we do, and we talk to our kids about it. i&#39;ve mentioned it <br/>
before (possibly on a different list?) but even my 2yo is able to understand that he can <br/>
have all the ice cream he wants but it&#39;d make life so much easier and more fun for my BIL <br/>
& SIL & their daughter if he waited till they went home, or ate it before they came. both of <br/>
my kids are ok with temporary restrictions for the sake of our family & friends, because <br/>
they know they&#39;re temporary and that they make our family and friends happier and enjoy <br/>
their time with us more.<br/>
<br/>
unschooling doesn&#39;t have to mean trampling over other people&#39;s feelings for the sake of <br/>
our kids&#39; freedom. there are for sure things *i&#39;d* be uncomfortable with around my kids <br/>
(swearing & racist jokes (even if not meant badly) come to mind, just because my kids are <br/>
too little at this point, IMO, to understand how and when to use those things so they don&#39;t <br/>
offend other folks, and it seems to me like a disservice to them to introduce them to <br/>
things that are likely to alienate them from people they want to be with), and i have and <br/>
still do ask people we hang around with (like my parents, lol, who curse freely, as did i, <br/>
pre-kids!) to help us out by changing their behavior a little while we&#39;re around to make life <br/>
easier. the last thing i need is for my 5yo and 2yo to be running around telling people to <br/>
fuck off! ha! anyways, in the same way i respect that other people have their own comfort <br/>
levels, and things that make them uncomfortable, and that inviting them over means <br/>
respecting those comfort levels. some people are very stressful to have around because <br/>
they have *so* many requirements for their comfort that it&#39;s difficult to satisfy them all, <br/>
and that does come into play when we consider how often to be around them or have <br/>
them over, but it doesn&#39;t mean that we should invite them over and knowingly make them <br/>
uncomfortable---that seems pretty uncool to me.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s not like i make my kids follow EVERY rule that other folks make their kids follow (we <br/>
lost one set of friends over the fact that i refused to make them wear shoes in the <br/>
playground, and to disallow them from climbing up the slide (what i *had* done is tell <br/>
them that the people going down the slide have priority (gravity & momentum being on <br/>
their side!), so they can climb as long as someone isn&#39;t going down. they are both pretty <br/>
good at checking and making sure it&#39;s safe). i just felt like those were unreasonable <br/>
restrictions i wasn&#39;t willing to put on them. so i guess it&#39;s all up to personal discretion (did <br/>
i spell that right?), but it does seem to me that there&#39;s a difference between hosting <br/>
someone at my home (in which i feel more responsibility to make them comfortable) and <br/>
meeting them somewhere (i don&#39;t feel as responsible---there are TONS of other people at <br/>
the park, and they ALL have different rules, KWIM?).<br/>
<br/>
who knows. but it&#39;s worthwhile to consider that your daughter may be old enough to <br/>
understand courtesy towards her friends, and that it may be worthwhile to your friendship <br/>
to respect your friend&#39;s feelings and beliefs as legitimate for *her*, even if they&#39;re not <br/>
legitimate for *you*, and to help her be comfortable & enjoy herself while she&#39;s visiting <br/>
you.<br/>

What did you read or see or think that caused you to write that?  If  <br/>
it&#39;s just a general statement, fine.  I agree.  If it was in response  <br/>
to something in this particular topic, I think it&#39;s overstated.  No  <br/>
one recommended that.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The other family didn&#39;t own the park.  It sounds like another parent  <br/>
wanted to control her kids AND yours AND YOU!<br/>
<br/>
-=-who knows. but it&#39;s worthwhile to consider that your daughter may  <br/>
be old enough to understand courtesy towards her friends, and that it  <br/>
may be worthwhile to your friendship to respect your friend&#39;s  <br/>
feelings and beliefs as legitimate for *her*, even if they&#39;re not  <br/>
legitimate for *you*, and to help her be comfortable & enjoy herself  <br/>
while she&#39;s visiting you.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s legitimate for her at her house might have very little to do  <br/>
with what she should request when she visits you.  If I&#39;m  listening  <br/>
to music and someone comes over and wants to talk, I&#39;ll probably turn  <br/>
the music off.  But if the visitor walked over and turned it off, I&#39;d  <br/>
be cranky.  If she asked me if it was okay to turn it off, my  <br/>
response would have to do with how she asked and why and whether she  <br/>
had been invited or just dropped in.   Bottom line, it&#39;s not her  <br/>
house and it&#39;s not a public park. It&#39;s my house.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids are in they&#39;re own home, it&#39;s their house.  That&#39;s  <br/>
important to me.  Visiting adults don&#39;t trump my kids.  I don&#39;t tell  <br/>
my kids to go in their room because I have company.   On the other  <br/>
hand, there was one family in which the kids weren&#39;t allowed to see  <br/>
or think &quot;Harry Potter,&quot; and we liked them enough to move glaring  <br/>
Harry Potter stuff out of the way if they were over.  One family had  <br/>
two vegans.  Still, if the mom or vegan daughter come over (the  <br/>
family&#39;s grown and scattered, but I&#39;m still friends with four of the  <br/>
six), I find something to put out that they can eat.  I don&#39;t cleanse  <br/>
the house of other things, I don&#39;t expect everyone else to eat vegan  <br/>
while they&#39;re here, but I try to accommodate them with enough food  <br/>
that they have the option to hang out and stay as long as they want to.<br/>
<br/>
That same family had TV restrictions when they were little, and my  <br/>
kids learned that if those kids came over, to have the TV off before  <br/>
they arrived and to lure them to the back yard quickly so they didn&#39;t  <br/>
get stuck to the TV.  Or if my kids wanted to watch a video, they  <br/>
knew for sure those kids wouldn&#39;t object.<br/>
<br/>
The principles of courtesy  have a LOT to do with venue.  If I meet  <br/>
someone at a third friend&#39;s house, neither of us gets to decide or  <br/>
control what happens or how.  The owner of the home gets final say  <br/>
and can boot us both out in a heartbeat.<br/>

-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
But because this list is a DISCUSSION  people are going to call some things wrong or wright.<br/>
If someone comes here and says they do not allow their kids to wacth TV that it is wrong if you want to unschool.<br/>
If someone comes here and says they spank their kids and/or punish them people will tell them that is wrong.<br/>
 Since you wrote it to the list than the idea has been called wrong ( limiting or prohibiting TV watching)<br/>

a family over, knowing that activity X (in this case watching TV/videos) makes them <br/>
uncomfortable, and being unwilling to modify how one usually does things in order to <br/>
make them more comfortable. i was suggesting that, at least to me, inviting them over and <br/>
persisting in doing things you know make them uncomfortable seems kinda uncool. i <br/>
guess like lots of swearing in front of my kids makes me uncomfortable, even though i <br/>
have nothing against swearing in principle, KWIM?<br/>
<br/>
i was suggesting that freedom and choices for one&#39;s own kids aren&#39;t incompatible with <br/>
making sure that people we invite over are comfortable; we talk ahead of time, and if the <br/>
requirements to make our potential guests feel comfortable are too much for us, then we <br/>

at this young age, i feel like it&#39;s giving them weapons they&#39;re not equipped to wield in ways <br/>
that won&#39;t offend people they want to be close to. and so i *do* ask my parents, for <br/>
example, to try to limit their cursing while we&#39;re around. am i trying to control them? well, <br/>
yes, in a way; i&#39;m uncomfortable with that going into my kids right now. similarly, my <br/>
niece likes to play exclusion games (to leave my son, who&#39;s younger, out), and her parents <br/>
are ok with that and defend it, but i&#39;ve said *i&#39;m* uncomfortable with it; he feels sad and he <br/>
and his sister play and replay that in the days that follow when it happens here. i&#39;ve <br/>
explained to my niece that we aren&#39;t comfortable playing like that, and helped her find <br/>
ways to include him, or at least not-explicitly-exclude him. am i controlling her and my <br/>
in-laws? yes, in a way, but i think most of us have things that make us comfortable and <br/>
uncomfortable and that we can (and should) expect the people we care about to <br/>
accomodate us as much as possible (and to explain or discuss where not possible), and <br/>
vice versa.<br/>

turning that off, because for whatever reason hearing mozart really makes me <br/>
uncomfortable&quot; i&#39;m pretty sure you&#39;d turn it off. of course it&#39;s not her house and it&#39;s not a <br/>

hell try to make people comfortable enough that booting someone from the house, or <br/>

come up.<br/>

<br/>
As it wasn&#39;t directed at anyone, I didn&#39;t say it to anyone, and the  <br/>
person in question isn&#39;t on this list, then &quot;harsh&quot; seems too harsh a  <br/>
word.  Because you WERE talking about me and something I said.  You  <br/>
even used my name.<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes to my house and one of my kids is watching TV (I  <br/>
don&#39;t care if that kid is three or seventeen years old), that mom was  <br/>
wrong--as in behaving inappropriately.  Out of line.  And if she  <br/>
thinks TV will ruin her kid&#39;s life, she is totally wrong--as in  <br/>
&quot;incorrect.&quot;  Flawed logic.  Misguided.<br/>

-=-i find i don&#39;t respond in ways i&#39;m  proud of to people if i spend  <br/>
my time thinking about whether what they&#39;re doing is right or wrong.-=-<br/>
<br/>
People have asked my advice since I was a kid.  I see that in a  <br/>
couple of my own kids.  Other people ask their opinions, so it&#39;s not  <br/>
just an aberration about me.   Kirby prevented a divorce when he was  <br/>
16, when the husband was ready to move out already.  Kirby was able  <br/>
to see the overall situation and say just the right things in a very  <br/>
calm way that made them both reconsider, and they stayed together.<br/>
<br/>
I would not be able to respond in ways I would be proud of if I tried  <br/>
to avoid deciding whether things were right or wrong.  In the context  <br/>
of what a person wants to accomplish, there are things that will help  <br/>
and things that will hurt.   What I care about on this list is  <br/>
unschooling.  In another aspect of my life, a medieval studies club,  <br/>
what I care about is honor and duty--virtues--and I counsel people  <br/>
about that, and about helping others become more honorable, even  <br/>
sometimes in tricky ways.  &quot;Social chess,&quot; someone called it recently.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to make a lot of money, and asked me for advice, the  <br/>
advice I would give would be different than if a person came and  <br/>
asked about joining and religious retreat, for sure, but I&#39;d be able  <br/>
to advise them both pretty effectively.  If I were to tell them not  <br/>
to think about what&#39;s right or wrong, but to accept that everyone&#39;s  <br/>
views are valid, they&#39;d never come back for any more advice from me,  <br/>
for sure.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone ends up being in a position to help others figure out  <br/>
how to change their lives quickly and for a purpose, but I&#39;m used to  <br/>
it.  It&#39;s been happening since I was little.<br/>
<br/>
Some people do go away because they think I&#39;m harsh.  Some of them  <br/>
hadn&#39;t wanted to be here in the first place, and are looking for a  <br/>
good excuse to leave.  Some of those who leave come back later.  Some  <br/>
stick around and change their minds.  Some don&#39;t.  But I&#39;m not going  <br/>
to change what&#39;s been working for decades because a few people ask me  <br/>
to change to make them more comfortable in what is effectively an  <br/>
extension of my house.<br/>
<br/>
Stephen King wrote a book in which a man kills a dog.  He said  he  <br/>
got a lot of complaint mail from people saying he was cruel to  <br/>
animals.  He said he wrote them all letters saying the character  <br/>
wasn&#39;t a real person, and there never was really a dog.<br/>

for being just the way they are is here:<br/>

surprised at the tone of the language; *so* not a big deal. sorry to have come off as <br/>

that readers have to read on this list are actually worth reading for<br/>
most of the people who pop in or read regularly.  Folks on here are<br/>
from all over the world, and what someone feels is harsh detracts from<br/>
the content of the posts, the unschooling stuff that the list is for.<br/>
<br/>
Perspectives about how the unschooling stuff gets expressed are side<br/>
issues.  For many, reading the side stuff is usually a waste of time.<br/>
If a person posts a lot of that kind of stuff it may get that person&#39;s<br/>
email name on &quot;ignore&quot; in the minds of the readers who find the<br/>
content of that person&#39;s posts unworthy of reading.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that every person who comes across this list appreciates<br/>
the tone.  I do because we&#39;re all online and *not* having to guess<br/>
what people are saying is very helpful to me, since in person it&#39;s<br/>
about being sociable and getting along.<br/>
<br/>
This list is for learning about unschooling.  To me, that&#39;s what it&#39;s all about.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Expecting 2 yo&#39;s to play with each other is something like magic.  It<br/>
doesn&#39;t just happen, unless there is some very interesting connection<br/>
between the 2 little ones.  I&#39;ve only seen it happen once.  That was<br/>
with Chamille and another little girl that she met when she turned 1. <br/>
It was like magic, they were completely drawn to one another and totally<br/>
inseperable!  They later became self proclaimed sisters and they still<br/>
keep in touch, at 14, even though their lives are very different.<br/>
<br/>
Most 2 yo&#39;s, I&#39;ve met, including my own, prefer the company of mom or<br/>
dad, and while fascinated with another little one, they play as an<br/>
extension of the parent.  If a 2 yo is really  more interested in<br/>
watching Dora, then maybe they really aren&#39;t ready for playdates, and<br/>
get togethers with the other mom and daughter should be in neutralish<br/>
play ground type atmosphere where they can do their own thing along side<br/>
of mom, while mom can talk and interact with the other mom.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux only recently has been able to have play time get togethers with<br/>
other kids without my constant interaction and involvement and she is 7.<br/>
To do so before it came naturally caused anxiety and conflict and<br/>
thankfully I recognized this and was able to be very present for her.</div>

Thanks to everyone for the input. I have to agree with what was said<br/>
above. I think trying to explain to my daughter at this point that we<br/>
can&#39;t have the TV on when these particular guests are over is a little<br/>
above her head. Definitely the best scenario(s) right now is for us to<br/>
meet at the other mom&#39;s house or outside at a playground. And that is<br/>
fine. I actually was able to have the TV off before they arrived the<br/>
play date before this particular one -- but it wasn&#39;t easy to do! And<br/>
this past time I was so busy cleaning up etc, that I just didn&#39;t have<br/>
time to address it before they arrived.<br/>
<br/>
I have ALWAYS felt that play dates are more for me than my daughter<br/>
and/or the kids we get together and babysit for. (I know that will<br/>
change as they get older, they are just pretty little still). It is<br/>
funny because I had a similar conversation with the same friend and<br/>
another friend a while ago. The other friend asked, &quot;well isn&#39;t the<br/>
point when we get together for them to play together?&quot; and my response<br/>
to that is that my first concern is that they are all happy and cared<br/>
for, and the play date for me is as much about MY socialization and<br/>
getting some adult contact. So I really try to keep that in mind -- to<br/>
balance what is best for her and the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I also appreciate all the discussion about boundaries in your own home<br/>
versus another person&#39;s home versus public situations. This was<br/>
something that was bothering me a little bit. I in no way meant to be<br/>
disrespectful to my friend, which is why I DID turn the TV off even<br/>
though I knew it would lead to unhappiness on my daughter&#39;s part. I<br/>
also felt that the computer was a good compromise for that particular<br/>
day because otherwise who knows if we would have had any fun!<br/>
<br/>
As always, thanks to everyone for the food for thought!<br/>

&gt; Hello--<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just had a play date with a friend and her 2 children - daughter, 2<br/>
&gt; yo, and son about 8 months. My daughter is 2 1/2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I recently posted about my daughter&#39;s current love of Dora. So of<br/>
&gt; course it was on this morning when our friends arrived. And we have a<br/>
&gt; BIG, HD TV so it is very attention grabbing!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My friend wanted to turn it off. I talked to Marisol about it and<br/>
&gt; turned it off and it led to a big emotional reaction, which I was not<br/>
&gt; surprised about. I felt bad turning it off, but I also wanted to<br/>
&gt; respect my friends wishes. We ended up compromising and I put Dora on<br/>
&gt; our laptop where Marisol (and the other little girl) could see it.<br/>
&gt; Marisol nursed for a little bit and calmed down and was happy the rest<br/>
&gt; of the play date.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, I know that the mom would have liked even the computer to be<br/>
&gt; off. She commented that she has noticed that her daughter is really<br/>
&gt; cranky after watching.... AND that the longer she watches the crankier<br/>
&gt; she is when it gets turned off. My thoughts were that is because she<br/>
&gt; is never allowed to watch (they don&#39;t even own a TV - just a computer)<br/>
&gt; and that she really likes it so when she IS allowed she wants more. I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t say that though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The awkward part was that the entire time we spent trying to entice<br/>
&gt; the little girl away from Dora -- with other toys, music, dancing,<br/>
&gt; building, etc. She was always drawn back. Marisol joined in with us<br/>
&gt; several times of her own volition. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Overall, even with the awkwardness the play date was really enjoyable.<br/>
&gt; I really enjoy talking with this friend. She knows that we differ on<br/>
&gt; this issue, I have talked a little bit about not limiting TV. I&#39;m sure<br/>
&gt; that she thought it was a bit crazy how upset Marisol was to have it<br/>
&gt; turned off though, and that it &quot;proved&quot; what we were doing was wrong<br/>
&gt; (whereas in my mind she was reacting strongly because I wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; listening to her and I normally do). I wonder if I should limit our<br/>
&gt; play dates to her house because TV is not an issue there. Or should I<br/>
&gt; talk to my friend and just tell her that I&#39;m not going to turn the TV<br/>
&gt; off, so if she would prefer not to come here that&#39;s ok??<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for any input!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
