<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992082885">Great suggestion! I think I might take my kids to do that. They have studied <br/>
the history of tattoos, so we did a field trip on that. I have a friend who <br/>
owns a tattoo parlor, so we went and watched one afternoon because he <br/>
offered. I never thought about piercing. He has a piercer there but I don&#39;t <br/>
know him. My Mom pierced mine when I was little, so piercing my daughters <br/>
was light a right of passage to me. But it would be interesting to see why <br/>
other people do it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

&gt;Here&#39;s my suggestion (and my first post on this list, so be kind all.)  I <br/>
&gt;see an opportunity for a new experience.  Do you live in or close to a city <br/>
&gt;that would have a reputable piercing place?  By that I mean not one of <br/>
&gt;those mall places that use a gun, but a place that respects piercings as <br/>
&gt;art.  Perhaps it would help him to go talk to one of theses people who have <br/>
&gt;devoted their lives to this art form.  He could see his own discomfort and <br/>
&gt;pain in relation to the greater concept of self experession and body <br/>
&gt;adornment.  Sometimes we get so focused on something, such as our own pain, <br/>
&gt;that we forget to look at the greater picture.  Maybe seeing other people <br/>
&gt;with many piercings (and loving it) would give him a sense that he can <br/>
&gt;handle just the one.  If anything, it would be an interesting outing, maybe <br/>
&gt;to an area of town you&#39;ve never been.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, and just because it looks okay, doen&#39;t mean it is pain free.  My <br/>
&gt;understanding is that the industry frowns on invasive treatments like <br/>
&gt;Bactine, alchohol and such.  A natural solution of sea salt and filtered <br/>
&gt;water does an amazing job of healing.  Ask your piercing proffesssional <br/>
&gt;(again, not one sitting in a mall kiosk) for suggestions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Good luck!<br/>

&gt;Hi Sandra,<br/>
&gt;It does move freely. We aren&#39;t using anything to clean it right now<br/>
&gt;because it has been 10 weeks, and it looks fine. He is really scared<br/>
&gt;about the pain. It seems to come out fine, but then when I go to put<br/>
&gt;it back it it hurts just in the back. But, it looks better than it did<br/>
&gt;3 weeks ago, which is the last time we tried. I think it looks healed<br/>
&gt;and that it would be ok, but he is afraid that there might be pain.<br/>
&gt;So, I am trying to help him with facing the pain, if there is any. I<br/>
&gt;just don&#39;t know how to help him because I don&#39;t want him to feel like<br/>
&gt;I &quot;talked him into it&quot;. He is convinced it will hurt, so I am just not<br/>
&gt;sure how to help him. He is so very frustrated with hiimself because<br/>
&gt;he is afraid to try. I try to help him with his feelings, but that<br/>
&gt;doesn&#39;t change anything for him, he still wants to change the earring,<br/>
&gt;but won&#39;t let himself try again. I feel his frustration, and I want to<br/>
&gt;help, but I don&#39;t think there is an easy solution.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thank you!<br/>
&gt;Amie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
