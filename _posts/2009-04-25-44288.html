<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421085387">We have a wonderful teen friend whose mother is alcoholic and not <br/>
interesting in allowing her daughter to go to college or leave home <br/>
anytime in the near future.  She&#39;s very close to 17.  Very mature for <br/>
her age and scared about her lack of prospects.  Lotsa embarrassment <br/>
and fear is the &quot;norm&quot; in her life.  If anyone knows of info that could <br/>
help this teen live more free .. please contact me.  She lives quite <br/>
far from us in the next county and her mother would never  voluntarily <br/>
agree to her leaving home.  Otherwise she would be more than welcome to <br/>
live here (but her mother knows that so we&#39;re not a secret safehouse).  <br/>
She has a great friend who understands and whose family is very sweet <br/>
and loving, who include her in their family but it&#39;s the same thing... <br/>
her mother knows about them (I think).<br/>
<br/>
She is not an unschooler.  My reason in posting at all is to perhaps <br/>
get some info offlist.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically I wondered about teen emancipation... is there such a <br/>
thing legally or is that just a concept or ideal I&#39;ve heard bandied <br/>
about?<br/>

It&#39;s real.  I don&#39;t know if it exists equally in all states, but I  <br/>
know someone who was emancipated.   The person needs to show an  <br/>
ability to take care of herself.  Some places want them to have a job,  <br/>
but mostly the idea is to give them rights to decide things as if they  <br/>
were 18.  It doesn&#39;t make them 18 for all purposes.<br/>
<br/>
Alateen might be helpful for her too, so she won&#39;t feel she&#39;s the only  <br/>
one, and they can help her see more clearly and to disentangle herself  <br/>
emotionally from her mother&#39;s situation, and see herself as strong and  <br/>
separate, even if she stays in the same house.<br/>

She doesn&#39;t need to leave to start feeling and being better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715626529">Thanks.  I had not had a chance to respond yet though I read this much <br/>
earlier.  Karl is wanting on this computer and we&#39;ve been out all day.  <br/>
