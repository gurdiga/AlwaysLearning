<div id="ygrps-yiv-221311772">Hi all,<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m realizing this is an issue where I keep slipping back into old thinking, <br/>
and could use a boost.  I think that it must involve a lot of mixed-up <br/>
thoughts in my head, both rational and irrational:  worry about saving enough for <br/>
college and retirement; anxiety about acquiring debt at times and being sloppy <br/>
about budgeting; fears of &quot;spoiling&quot; the kids (totally irrational, I know, I <br/>
know!) and not &quot;teaching&quot; them to be responsible about money, leading to fears <br/>
for their future; guilt about not contributing enough myself financially.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve read here for a while and get that many of you consider your money to be <br/>
&quot;family money,&quot; but how does that work, practically?  As I write this, I <br/>
imagine the answer would be similar to what you get with moving toward unlimited <br/>
tv; supply and demand, and that once you start with give-give-give, they might <br/>
first respond with take-take-take, but then will become less so as you build <br/>
trust in that area and continue to work toward that climate of helping everyone <br/>
get what they wants.  Is that it?  <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s funny how just writing the question starts me seeing the problem more <br/>
clearly and imagining at least a few ways people might suggest I could improve <br/>
things.  But since I doubt I&#39;m the only one struggling with this issue and I&#39;m <br/>
sure I still have plenty of blind spots in my own thinking, can those of you <br/>
who&#39;ve developed healthy and peaceful relationships with your kids regarding <br/>
money please share some of your thoughts, ideas, experiences? <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Patty<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1312013697">Holly&#39;s birthday&#39;s next week but for various reasons, she needed to  <br/>
do something before then, so she wanted to take a friend to a haunted  <br/>
house, $13 each.  I figured I&#39;d give her $40 and she could take three  <br/>
people.  Marty was going to go with her.  Then others wanted to go.   <br/>
I gave her $60, remembering it&#39;s cheaper than a baker cake and enough  <br/>
food for a party, and suggested maybe she could equally subsidize  <br/>
people or something.<br/>
<br/>
Seven people went--Holly, Marty and five others from 18 to 28.  Holly  <br/>
had the birthday $60, and $10 of her own, and two other people made  <br/>
up the difference.  So Holly purchased all the tickets at once.   <br/>
Afterwards they went for Boba Tea and others covered Holly because  <br/>
she had spent all her money.<br/>
<br/>
Today she&#39;s going to a birthday party at the zoo.  I owed her $10.   <br/>
It costs $7 to get into the zoo (our membership expired and with only  <br/>
one &quot;child&quot; under 18 it&#39;s not a good deal anymore).  I was invited to  <br/>
the party too, but I&#39;m staying home, so it&#39;s already cheaper than it  <br/>
would be if I went.  Holly can drive herself.  I gave her a twenty  <br/>
dollar bill and three dollars in quarters.  The quarters are for the  <br/>
food for the koi and the ducks.  I put them in a baggie with six  <br/>
small paper cups so the littler kids at the party can feed ducks.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s taking the only automatic transmission car that&#39;s running at  <br/>
the moment and will be gone for hours. She doesn&#39;t have to pay for  <br/>
the gasoline.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s generous when she has money and we try to be generous with her.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We never had a take-take-take phase, but we never had a very stingy- <br/>
parents phase either, so I don&#39;t know.<br/>
I was surprised when we went to Disneyland and kept offering Marty  <br/>
money or souvenirs and he kept saying no thanks, and not in any kind  <br/>
of surly or reactionary way, he was just honestly having fun without  <br/>
the acquisition of *stuff.*  Kirby and Holly had money and hardly  <br/>
spent any.  I was so surprised I wrote it up and it&#39;s here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/spoiled">http://sandradodd.com/spoiled</a><br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was moving out, we offered to lend him money but he wanted  <br/>
to try to do it on his own.  When he got to Austin, he needed to pay  <br/>
his second month&#39;s rent before his first paycheck came, so Keith  <br/>
transferred $500 to lend him.  We told him he didn&#39;t have to pay it  <br/>
right away, but when he got settled.<br/>
<br/>
Marty went to visit last week and Kirby sent back a check, with  <br/>
Marty, for $500, on his own account with his new address on the  <br/>
check, and his handwriting was really nice.  I thought of scanning it  <br/>
to show people here his naturally-evolved  handwriting and his  <br/>
forceful signature, but then I thought better of photocopying a  <br/>
check!  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times last week when I was out, once with Holly and once  <br/>
with Marty, I asked if we should go out to eat and they each  <br/>
separately said, &quot;Let&#39;s just go home and eat.&quot;  &quot;Out to eat&quot; is my  <br/>
dream thing, I guess.  I feel good if I eat out and sometimes sorry  <br/>
for myself when I eat at home.   They don&#39;t have that, though. They  <br/>
don&#39;t have the feeling that they&#39;re only loved if someone&#39;s spending  <br/>
money on them, and they like to be home.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all inter-related I think.<br/>

 <br/>
So it sounds like you had kind of a party budget in your head, and you more <br/>
or less stuck to it.  And when it wouldn&#39;t completely cover her, she chipped in <br/>
and her friends helped out.<br/>
 <br/>
That&#39;s pretty similar to what we do, most of the time.  <br/>
 <br/>
Holly&#39;s older and has more money than Abby, who&#39;s 11 and not earning anything <br/>
on her own yet, but maybe it works out about the same since the things Holly <br/>
wants probably cost more.  So maybe it&#39;s more an issue of Abby not having a <br/>
big enough allowance.  She still asks me for things at the store, and I have a <br/>
hard time drawing a line between things she should pay for, and things I <br/>
should.  <br/>
 <br/>
I guess I have issues at times with judging as frivolous or unnecessary stuff <br/>
she wants.  Like the other day I got annoyed with her at the store because I <br/>
invited her to come with me to get milk and she ended up getting excited <br/>
thinking *we* should buy a Halloween mask that she thought would be funny for dh, <br/>
when she didn&#39;t have any money.  I did catch myself afterward and said, look, <br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I wasn&#39;t expecting to buy other stuff, we don&#39;t even know if dad <br/>
*wants* to wear a mask on Halloween, why don&#39;t you ask him if he wants you to <br/>
pick something out for him and if so, we&#39;ll go back and get it.  And sure enough, <br/>
he saw her excitement about it and said yes, so the next day I did go back <br/>
with her and get it.  <br/>
 <br/>
So depending how you view it, it was either a total *waste* of money, or, <br/>
*priceless* to see how delighted it made her to present it to dh.  (And if *was* <br/>
a pretty funny mask --- it&#39;s the top half the Elvis&#39; head.  Looks hilarious on <br/>
him, IF you&#39;re not focusing on how you *wasted* another $6 after spending $25 <br/>
on stuff for her own costume.)  Looking back, it was pretty dumb of me to <br/>
think she wasn&#39;t going to actually want anything at the store, because she nearly <br/>
always does.  <br/>
 <br/>
I supposed I could&#39;ve offered her a loan.  But with loans and paybacks it&#39;s <br/>
not what I imagined as a system of the money belonging to everyone.  But it <br/>
would be an improvement over what I&#39;m doing now.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s generous when she has money and we try to be generous with her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Abby is too, really.  I mean look, the mask wasn&#39;t even for her.  But it&#39;s <br/>
silly that the fears come up anyway even when the evidence right in front of me <br/>
says otherwise.<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; We never had a take-take-take phase, but we never had a very stingy- &gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>parents phase either, so I don&#39;t know.<br/>
 <br/>
But you do have limits -- but they&#39;re natural ones, not arbitrary ones, right?<br/>
 <br/>
Part of the reason I ask is that I was just having a conversation with a <br/>
friend who&#39;s trying improve her relationship with her teen son.  She&#39;s wrestling <br/>
with a decision of whether to grant his request for her to take him to the Led <br/>
Zeppelin concert in London (from California.)  And it *is* within their means, <br/>
and he knows it, and reminds her of that -- which is one source of her <br/>
concern, I think.  She and her husband have some of the same fears I&#39;ve mentioned.  <br/>
But since saying yes to this would be a very new approach for her, I&#39;m <br/>
predicting it may work the same as the unlimited tv thing.  But maybe not.  She says <br/>
he doesn&#39;t ask for a lot.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I was surprised when we went to Disneyland and kept offering Marty  <br/>
&gt; money or souvenirs and he kept saying no thanks, and not in any kind  <br/>
&gt; of surly or reactionary way, he was just honestly having fun without  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really good (and I will share it with my friend and her husband, too.) <br/>
 So when you have money and they don&#39;t, you occasionally do just hand it out. <br/>
 I cut this from there:<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;I think they knew if they had REALLY wanted something–a toy or a t-shirt or <br/>
whatever–that they could have had it. So their decisions were not made on any <br/>
basis except &quot;Do I really want this? Would it make my life better to have <br/>
it?&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
This is the place I&#39;d like to get to with Abby.  Only I worry there are a <br/>
*whole* lot of things she&#39;d like and in her opinion would make her life better.  <br/>
Her room is knee-deep in stuffed animals, which is fine, but it&#39;s not like <br/>
they&#39;re going to stop making them or new ones will cease to be cute and <br/>
appealing.  My mother-in-law loves to buy things too, and with her it seems like a <br/>
symptom of a larger problem.  So maybe that&#39;s it, I worry that we&#39;ve done <br/>
something wrong and made her needy for hundreds of stuffed animals. Or it&#39;s genetic, a <br/>
shopping gene she got from Grandma that has nothing to do with me.  Or <br/>
neither.<br/>
 <br/>
My son is more like how you describe Marty though.  He seems to take pride in <br/>
using his own money and not needing things from us.  But he&#39;s a year older.  <br/>
And I do remember getting to that point with my own parents.  So maybe it&#39;s <br/>
just a matter of time.<br/>

<br/>
What we&#39;ve done with allowance is that it&#39;s for things they don&#39;t  <br/>
have to ask about at all.  If they want something I think is part of  <br/>
what parents should provide anyway and if we can afford it, I might  <br/>
offer or they might ask.  Or we think about it and talk about it and  <br/>
that ends up one way or the other too.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of gifts for their dad, sometimes we just tell the story  <br/>
and tell him how much it would have cost and so how much we saved  <br/>
him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We talk about things to buy just like we talk about every other kind  <br/>
of thing.  I don&#39;t know about &quot;limits,&quot; but the factors include what  <br/>
else has been bought lately, what&#39;s coming up, what the longterm or  <br/>
sharing or &quot;educational&quot; value of a thing might be, whether we can  <br/>
play with it for a while and then give it as a gift, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thrift stores are great for satisfying curiosity, general desire, and  <br/>
the need for newness.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If she treats it like a big fling, not the eternal opening of the  <br/>
&quot;you can have whatever you want forever&quot; door, how would it be  <br/>
different from going to London for a wedding, a funeral, a  <br/>
conference, a week of touristing?  And they could get some touristing  <br/>
in too, and shopping and maybe get on a train and get off in some  <br/>
little town the name of which they&#39;ll never remember when they get home.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing it as *just* a concert isn&#39;t the best angle for viewing, I think.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;ve known since I was little that I have similarities to that  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350632164">Here&#39;s what we do...my nine and twelve year old daughter each get <br/>
$25 on the first of the month. There are no chores attached to that <br/>
money but over time we have all (all of us in the family) have <br/>
gravitated towards certain things we take responsibility for in the <br/>
house. My husband does most of the cooking, I do the cleaning, <br/>
except for the vacuuming which my husband does. My nine year old <br/>
keeps the back yard play area under control (picks up fallen <br/>
branches, fills up the bird feeders and butterfly, squirell and bird <br/>
drinking bowls, removes the ever falling leaves off the trampoline, <br/>
etc) and she also puts the dishes away after my 12 year old washes <br/>
them. The other things we do on an as needed basis or whoever sees <br/>
it or can do it first. <br/>
<br/>
They can do whatever they want with their money, which they also use <br/>
for birthday & Christmas gifts. I pay for all activites, clothes, <br/>
haircuts, etc. I still buy stuff for them in the store if I have <br/>
extra cash and there have been times where they&#39;ve paid for me or <br/>
taken me out to lunch (they LOVE doing that....they took me to <br/>
Burger King the other day for a veggie burger and both wanted to pay <br/>
for it. LOL)<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps!<br/>

See, this is why it&#39;s so good to ask other people.  We&#39;ve been doing $5, but <br/>
weekly.  And it works SO badly because we all forget until somebody wants <br/>
something, then nobody can&#39;t remember how much they&#39;re owed.  It just never <br/>
occurred to me that a kid&#39;s allowance could be a monthly thing - duh!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ll ask them if they think monthly would be easier for everybody.  And maybe <br/>
we&#39;ll toss in a $5 raise as well.<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for reminding me of this.  She LOVES Thrift stores, and I do too, <br/>
because then she can buy whatever she wants and I really don&#39;t care.<br/>
 <br/>
Even better though is garage sales.  A few weeks ago we fell into one when we <br/>
were out, and she managed to get a stuffed puppy, a mini beany baby, a <br/>
stuffed &quot;Peeps&quot; bunny, eight cute animal Hallmark Christmas ornaments, a &quot;Wolf Xing&quot; <br/>
sign for her friend&#39;s bedroom, a shirt with an &#39;A&#39; on it (like the &#39;L&#39; ones <br/>
Laverne wore on Laverne & Shirley,) a kitty coffee cup and two puppy <br/>
knickknacks, all for $6.50, which I think is less than just one of the Hallmark <br/>
ornaments would&#39;ve cost new.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s be good to remember this next time we&#39;re out and that shopping bug <br/>
starts to nibble at her (and bug me,) I can remind her about how far our money can <br/>
go at garage sales, and see if she&#39;d rather make a plan to get our butts out <br/>
of bed on Saturday morning to go &#39;saling.&quot;<br/>

Sometimes we invite friends to help out and earn money too and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944570986">Our 8 year old son and nearly 10 year old daughter get $30 on the first of each month.  They can do with it what they please. At first they would buy lots of lollies (which was cool) but now they spend a bit more time thinking about what they want to buy.  And they also want to buy stuff for us too which is super sweet.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, their maths skills have increased heaps since they started getting an allowance.  DS will stand in the shop working out in his head what he can afford.  It&#39;s fantastic to see.  REAL hands on maths!!<br/>
<br/>
I just love unschooling!!!<br/>

  Here&#39;s what we do...my nine and twelve year old daughter each get <br/>
  $25 on the first of the month. There are no chores attached to that <br/>
  money but over time we have all (all of us in the family) have <br/>
  gravitated towards certain things we take responsibility for in the <br/>
  house. My husband does most of the cooking, I do the cleaning, <br/>
  except for the vacuuming which my husband does. My nine year old <br/>
  keeps the back yard play area under control (picks up fallen <br/>
  branches, fills up the bird feeders and butterfly, squirell and bird <br/>
  drinking bowls, removes the ever falling leaves off the trampoline, <br/>
  etc) and she also puts the dishes away after my 12 year old washes <br/>
  them. The other things we do on an as needed basis or whoever sees <br/>
  it or can do it first. <br/>
<br/>
  They can do whatever they want with their money, which they also use <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989076226">there is a really good movie called winning at parenting without beating your child.  She talks about allowance and her thought is that children should have money as soon as they are old enough to not eat it.  Then they should get a &quot;raise&quot; once they prove they need it.  She said she had 3 kids and one wanted to be paid monthly, the others weekly.  One of the older ones wanted a raise and had reasons why he would need more money.  One of the younger kids had a bunch of reasons that she didn&#39;t agree with, but he worked so hard to convince her of his need for more money that she gave him some too.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were younger Friday was &quot;dollar day&quot;  They would each get a dollar to spend or save as they wish.  Then for a while money was tight and 2 dollars a week was too much for me to give them.  They understood that.  They know about how much money we make working in our family business and they know what bills we have.  They have a good understanding of money.<br/>
<br/>
I personally do not like to attach money to chores around the house because then when I ask my kids to help with something they ask if they are getting paid and they only want to help out if they are getting something out of it.  I do have optional jobs that they can do to earn money, like mowing the lawn, but laundry and dishes are something that everyone in the house is expected to help out with, without payment or reward.<br/>

&gt;  $25 on the first of the month. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  See, this is why it&#39;s so good to ask other people. We&#39;ve been doing $5,<br/>
&gt;  but<br/>
&gt;  weekly. And it works SO badly because we all forget until somebody wants<br/>
&gt;  something, then nobody can&#39;t remember how much they&#39;re owed. It just<br/>
&gt;  never<br/>
&gt;  occurred to me that a kid&#39;s allowance could be a monthly thing - duh!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  I&#39;ll ask them if they think monthly would be easier for everybody. And<br/>
&gt;  maybe<br/>
&gt;  we&#39;ll toss in a $5 raise as well.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;  Thanks!<br/>

&quot;Expected to&quot; is another way to say that they are required to do it,  <br/>
right?<br/>
<br/>
There are other ways.<br/>

call them chores either.  I love it when my kids help out, but I try <br/>
not to make a big deal out of it.  A simple thanks is all I takes.  <br/>
<br/>
When I make a big deal out of it, they get this idea that what they <br/>
did is out of the ordinary and exceptional.  I may have these long <br/>
held beliefs about doing household work, but I don&#39;t want my kids <br/>
to.  It is what it is, something I choose to do to make our lives <br/>
more comfortable, and that&#39;s how I&#39;d like them to experience it too.  <br/>
It&#39;s not something exceptional and extraordinary, it&#39;s just something <br/>
we do to get on in the world.  Everyone has their own comfort levels. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t expect my kids to do anything.  Sometimes one or the other <br/>
will just pitch in while I&#39;m doing some cleaning, especially if they <br/>
know why I&#39;m doing it and they like the reason.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time I asked my 13 yr old to help do this or that.  She <br/>
said &quot;no&quot; for so long that I stopped asking.  The other day she was <br/>
talking about wanting a pet rat.  I told her I wasn&#39;t comfortable <br/>
having another pet because I felt like I wasn&#39;t taking care of the <br/>
ones we already had well enough.  I started to list off all the <br/>
things that I do to keep our pets healthy and happy.  She cut me off <br/>
in the middle of it and said &quot;mom, you never ask me to do that stuff, <br/>
I&#39;d be happy to help out but you never ask.&quot;  She&#39;s right, though I <br/>
never ask anymore.  She wants me to ask her to help out and says that <br/>
she would, she just doesn&#39;t always know what or when to do things.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s kinda cool!  Before that was able to happen, I had to change <br/>
how I viewed doing household work and general other maintenance <br/>
around the house.  When she was little, I expected her to help do <br/>
things, like pick up her toys and such.  I wasn&#39;t mean about it and I <br/>
did it with her, but it was still an expectation and it did years of <br/>
damage.  Over the years she&#39;s on and off helped out willingly, but <br/>
probably not as much as she would&#39;ve had I never expected her to, to <br/>
begin with.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter has never had that expectation placed upon her <br/>
and she helps out a LOT more all on her own.  It could be <br/>
personality, but it could be that whole expectation thing.</div>
