don&#39;t. I have thought a great deal about this. Puppies are cute, but I don&#39;t<br/>
want the responsibility of a puppy right now in my life. Mostly I don&#39;t want<br/>
to have to clean up after it. Not to mention we don&#39;t have the money to<br/>
devote to a veteranarian right now.<br/>

How do I go about explaining all this to my dd? I have tried telling her<br/>

That might make her happy for a while and she can learn how to take care of dogs. I know she is only 7 but I started young too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964734185">I would explain it exactly how you explained it to us.  Puppies are a LOT of<br/>
work.  They require more care, money, training, and attention than a 7 year<br/>
old can provide and at this time in your life you do not feel ready for a<br/>
puppy.  It would not be fair to the puppy to bring them into a family where<br/>
the primary care taker felt resentment towards the work/money required to<br/>
care for it properly.  Without the whole family being on board it just isn&#39;t<br/>
a good idea.  A child&#39;s brain just can not foresee the problems that could<br/>
come up or the responsibility required to care for a puppy. She may not<br/>
understand it but you cannot sacrifice an animal&#39;s welfare as a learning<br/>
experiment for your daughter.<br/>

I have done this. I think she understands on some level, but she still<br/>
*wants* a puppy. That *want* is very strong and sometimes I feel bad because<br/>
sometimes I feel that I am not FINDING a way for her to have a puppy.<br/>

Your message is part right, Diana. It is a cop out, sort of. I don&#39;t<br/>
really like dogs. I was made to take care of them when I was growing<br/>
up and we lost so many animals (due to them being hit or dying or<br/>
whatever)that part of me doesn&#39;t want a dog at all.<br/>
<br/>
However, there are breeds that I am more &quot;warm&quot; towards (my step dad&#39;s<br/>
parents had a miniature Doberman, who has since passed on, that I fell<br/>
in love with) and could definitely see myself getting, someday. I know<br/>
that now is not that time though. We make *very* little money and are<br/>
barely keeping ourselves afloat. It would be unfair to bring another<br/>
mouth to feed into that mix I think.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
Maybe mom and daughter can do that together.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
I will think on this. I am not a big fan of this idea because I am<br/>
really not that fond of dogs and her dad *really* doesn&#39;t like them so<br/>
it would have to be me (or will it? I guess that isn&#39;t the *only*<br/>
option). I will see what I can come up with though.<br/>
<br/>
I asked her if instead of getting a dog (for now) if we could maybe<br/>
talk to people about &quot;borrowing&quot; their animals to walk/play<br/>
with/perhaps bathe or whatever. She was so excited and even called me<br/>
&quot;the best mom ever&quot; (gotta love these moments, right?). I am on a<br/>
couple local lists and asked around and there is a family willing to<br/>
let us play/walk their dog (not a puppy, but a start) so I will see<br/>
what she says to this idea.<br/>
<br/>

These are great ideas that I will keep in mind for when the time comes<br/>
to get a dog. We did consider Paws For A Cause, but again, the expense<br/>
right now is too much.<br/>

Thank you all for your ideas and helping me get &quot;unstuck&quot;.<br/>

You can say no, about a dog.<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted a dog but your daughter really was afraid of them or  <br/>
just thought they were creepy or something, you probably wouldn&#39;t get  <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It sounds good except for the &quot;I asked her if instead of...&quot;  because  <br/>
neither the parents nor the children should be dictating what has to  <br/>
happen in the family about things like that.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could get her books about dogs and breeds and posters and  <br/>
dog-up her room, without getting a dog.  How many young girls have  <br/>
model horses and horse posters and no horse?   Don&#39;t let your life be  <br/>
ruined over disagreement about a dog.   Don&#39;t let her bring a dog  <br/>
into a situation where the dad has negative-points interest in a dog  <br/>
and the mom has bad associations and memories.  Too expensive, in  <br/>
human terms. (And then financial.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could visit a veterinarian that handles lots of dogs.  Sit  <br/>
in the waiting room.  See some of the people come in and out.  Most  <br/>
of the dogs will be healthy, and in to be spayed or neutered or get  <br/>
shots or whatever.  When there&#39;s a lull at the desk, maybe you could  <br/>
ask for literature--handouts about heartworms or how to keep a dog  <br/>
healthy, or post-operative instructions, or whatever would be  <br/>
interesting to her (and remind her that problems happen).<br/>

I think it&#39;s great that you are willing and able at this point in your life<br/>
to get Hayden the dog he wants.  I&#39;d love to see more parents go out of<br/>
their way to  help their children make their dreams come true.  I just want<br/>
to point out that lack of money, time, and willingness are not always a cop<br/>
out.  Getting a dog IS a big responsibility and it has to be the right<br/>
decision for your whole family.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Right now my daughter wants a dog.  We have 2 horses, 2 cats, and 2 rabbits.<br/>
We love and take good care of all of our pets and it can be expensive.  Last<br/>
fall one of our horses got Lyme disease and we are now suffering the fallout<br/>
from that as she has now developed arthritis from having Lyme.  Proper vet<br/>
care is expensive.  Had the vet out the other day for her and it was $450<br/>
and we still don&#39;t know if what they did helped her.  For my family, adding<br/>
a dog to our expenses right now would, imo, be irresponsible because we&#39;re<br/>
already on a tight budget and the pets we have already are not inexpensive<br/>
to keep.  A dog is a whole different level than a gerbil or hamster.  They<br/>
are pack animals that want to be part of your family and vet care can be<br/>
expensive.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The reason I am writing all this is because I don&#39;t think other mom&#39;s out<br/>
there should feel like being responsible is a cop out if the time is not<br/>
right for them to add a dog to the family.  I hate seeing all the unwanted<br/>
dogs in shelters when their families give them up because they did not<br/>
consider all the responsibilities connected with bringing home a puppy.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2028067291">Hi, Amanda - just wanted to add some more &quot;food for thought&quot; here.  I<br/>
happend to love dogs and have always had dogs.  And I am always kind of<br/>
surprised when I meet people who don&#39;t.  That said, my 10 yr old son did<br/>
not inherit the dog gene -- he likes fish and that&#39;s it, nothing with<br/>
fur or feathers.  One of his friends, though, started wanting a dog and<br/>
wanting to spend time with our dog (Great Pyrenees).  He worked and<br/>
worked on his mother, who also did not inherit the dog gene, until<br/>
finally, after I think three years, he talked her into a puppy for<br/>
Christmas.  She never, ever owned a dog before.  She was in for some<br/>
changes, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
This little boy is in school, so he&#39;s not home during the day to take<br/>
care of the puppy.  His mom has to do it, and I think she resents it. <br/>
Puppy is now six months old and recently ate part of their grill and<br/>
part of something on their air conditioner.  This tells me Puppy is not<br/>
being watched as well as needed and places aren&#39;t puppyproof.  Mom&#39;s<br/>
response is to put the pup in her carrier -- time out, I guess.  She<br/>
calls me often upset and angry about whatever is going on.  I try to<br/>
tell her about phases and training, etc.  She really does resent the<br/>
puppy, though, and I seriously doubt they have her much longer.  BTW,<br/>
they paid $600 for this pup who is just being a pup.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that helps you any.  My friend is still trying to adjust<br/>
to the extra cost of just one little puppy -- monthly flea/tick<br/>
treatment, heartworm, food plus any vet visits, grooming, toys,<br/>
bedding...  My dog, who is big, costs about 40 a month for those<br/>
preventative treatments, probably another 50 in food and her upcoming<br/>
checkup is going to be about $130.  I TRY to groom her -- not fun, even<br/>
to me -- because taking her to be done would be upwards of $200.<br/>
<br/>
If you think your daughter is responsible/capable of all the home needs<br/>
- feeding, watering daily, training, cleaning up potty messes/yard,<br/>
exercising, etc., then no problem (I did do all that stuff, except for<br/>
the yard cleanup, when I was that age).  But if not, maybe you two could<br/>
pick a breed  (www.dogbreedinfo.com &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com</a>&gt;   <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do</a><br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/dogselectorindex.do</a>&gt;    <br/>

books on that breed, some dog training books, maybe observe a training<br/>
class somewhere - Petsmart has them - and let her learn all about it<br/>
before she gets her dog.<br/>
<br/>
While I think older dogs are great, many are not the best option for a<br/>
beginner.  Some are really set in their ways, have health issues, may<br/>
not like kids (you won&#39;t always get a history on an oder dog).  I like<br/>
that my son, even though he doesn&#39;t care about dogs, has been around our<br/>
dog since he was three years old and she was 9 weeks.  She adores him<br/>
and loves my toddler, too.  Growing up together, to me, is ideal for<br/>
kids and their dogs.  It creates such a special bond between them<br/>
(remembering my own childhood dogs here) that lasts forever.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck either way!<br/>

&gt; because I have been using it too. And because after years of that<br/>
&gt; rationale, Hayden has called me on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m putting my own dog-fears to bed & we&#39;re earnestly seeking the<br/>

&gt; -OR- do I want to be the mom who (like most everything else)<br/>
&gt; understands how important this is and makes it happen??<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Your message is part right, Diana. It is a cop out, sort of. I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really like dogs. I was made to take care of them when I was growing<br/>
&gt; up and we lost so many animals (due to them being hit or dying or<br/>
&gt; whatever)that part of me doesn&#39;t want a dog at all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; However, there are breeds that I am more &quot;warm&quot; towards (my step dad&#39;s<br/>
&gt; parents had a miniature Doberman, who has since passed on, that I fell<br/>
&gt; in love with) and could definitely see myself getting, someday. I know<br/>
&gt; that now is not that time though. We make *very* little money and are<br/>
&gt; barely keeping ourselves afloat. It would be unfair to bring another<br/>
&gt; mouth to feed into that mix I think.<br/>

with my intent focus only for the last 6 months or so. I&#39;ve only owned dogs<br/>
with my parents (NOT good examples) and one neurotic puppy as an adult that<br/>
we had to get rid of (no experience + no examples = bad sitch for us all!).<br/>
So I carried all this fear about being a good dog owner. There&#39;s not much<br/>
that&#39;ll get my attention like fear - bravely, I dug deep, to see where/why<br/>
it exists. I&#39;m mostly a &quot;glass half-full&quot; kinda gal, I was surprised to find<br/>
a part of me that felt &quot;there is no glass&quot; and held such awful opinions of<br/>
myself. *That* process has been the most beneficial (and not just related to<br/>
the dog issue)!<br/>
And here we are, treading water financially... the temptation arises often<br/>
to say &quot;We can&#39;t afford it&quot; though my own experience has shown that when<br/>
it&#39;s important the money comes... I&#39;ve shifted that thinking to &quot;HOW can we<br/>
afford it?&quot; We&#39;ve looked into preparing homemade food for the dog<br/>
(incredibly labor intensive AND incredibly inexpensive) and joining 4-H as a<br/>
way to expand dog-training. And out of our watching of &quot;The Dog Whisperer&quot;<br/>
Hayden thinks he&#39;d like to walk other dogs with his; for some extra cash and<br/>
because it&#39;s easier to walk dogs as a &quot;pack.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; Maybe mom and daughter can do that together.<br/>
&gt; -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
&gt; I will think on this. I am not a big fan of this idea because I am<br/>
&gt; really not that fond of dogs and her dad *really* doesn&#39;t like them so<br/>
&gt; it would have to be me (or will it? I guess that isn&#39;t the *only*<br/>
&gt; option). I will see what I can come up with though.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I asked her if instead of getting a dog (for now) if we could maybe<br/>
&gt; talk to people about &quot;borrowing&quot; their animals to walk/play<br/>
&gt; with/perhaps bathe or whatever. She was so excited and even called me<br/>
&gt; &quot;the best mom ever&quot; (gotta love these moments, right?). I am on a<br/>
&gt; couple local lists and asked around and there is a family willing to<br/>
&gt; let us play/walk their dog (not a puppy, but a start) so I will see<br/>
&gt; what she says to this idea.<br/>

their parent is willing to volunteer with them. There&#39;s a monthly training<br/>
meeting available. Ah, maybe there&#39;s another adult willing to do this with<br/>
her?? Maybe check with local 4-H and see if they have a dog program she can<br/>
help with (usually obstacle course kinda stuff).<br/>
When I talked to Hayden about the pound, he was interested though not yet<br/>
enough to follow through. He feels it would be hard to fall in love with<br/>
those dogs and not be able to bring them home, then come home to an empty<br/>
house. So, for that we wait.<br/>
In the meantime, we&#39;ve dogsat for a weekend and now my friend brings her dog<br/>
each time she visits so Hayden can spend time with her.<br/>
And we&#39;re in communication with a family in Portland who needs to get rid of<br/>
their Shepherd mix dog named Ohana (how perfect is that?!?!?!) who may come<br/>
live with us :) (And I still don&#39;t know how.... those voices will just have<br/>
to chill out for a while and let me *be* :::vbg:::)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-738020475">-=-The reason I am writing all this is because I don&#39;t think other  <br/>
mom&#39;s out<br/>
there should feel like being responsible is a cop out if the time is not<br/>
right for them to add a dog to the family.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a boyfriend who&#39;s over here a lot and he&#39;s allergic to cats  <br/>
and dogs.  If our dog died, I wouldn&#39;t rush out and buy another one,  <br/>
out of consideration of Brett (other Brett, not Brett Henry, for  <br/>
those who know our original Brett).<br/>
<br/>
Holly wanted tortoises.  She wanted to get a couple of the small ones  <br/>
from her grandmother&#39;s yard on the way back from Texas the other  <br/>
day.  The message passed through a couple of people, and they saved,  <br/>
in a box for her, two BIG tortoises.  Holly wanted babyish ones, to  <br/>
keep inside in a dry tank for a few months, and then take them back  <br/>
to the grandparents&#39; back yard before hybernation seasons.   (There  <br/>
will be a video of the two she let loose again on my blog in a day or  <br/>
two.)<br/>
<br/>
We both read on the internet and thought about what and where and  <br/>
how.  I was willing to help her make it happen, but she decided  <br/>
against it for the comfort of the tortoises, who needed  more room,  <br/>
and are way grown and big.  We have cats, and our yard isn&#39;t tortoise- <br/>
secure, and we have streets on two sides.<br/>
<br/>
She might still get some smaller ones later in the year.  Those were  <br/>
the only two out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-13746519">We visited my parents the other day and we played the board game &quot;Are You<br/>
Smarter Than a 5th Grader,&quot; which we all enjoy. (my girls are 11 and 14 now<br/>
and always unschooled) The question &quot;who invented the cotton gin?&quot; came up.<br/>
It was my mom or dad&#39;s question, I think.  After we discussed what a cotton<br/>
gin was and who invented it, my dad asked me how I teach the kids stiff like<br/>
that.  (I&#39;ve explained to him several times over the years about unschooling<br/>
but apparently it hasn&#39;t made much of an impact, LOL)  I laughed and said,<br/>
&quot;by playing &quot;Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader.&quot;  He then went on to tell me<br/>
that he still knows all the prepositions (I think it was prepositions) that<br/>
he had to learn in grade school.  Then he recited them.  Then he laughed and<br/>
said he wished he could delete those memories and replace them with<br/>
something WORTH remembering, like when his next dr. appointment was.  It<br/>
just cracked me up that in one breath he was expressing some worry about my<br/>
kids learning arbitrary facts and in the next breath he wished he could<br/>
delete the arbitrary things he memorized as a kid.  I would say point made,<br/>
but I&#39;m not sure he saw the irony of the whole thing.<br/>
