<div id="ygrps-yiv-2124074559">There&#39;s a new description of unschooling published this week.  Robin Bentley found it and sent it to me.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://zenhabits.net">http://zenhabits.net</a><br/>
or for a longterm link:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://zenhabits.net/unschool/">http://zenhabits.net/unschool/</a><br/>
<br/>
And bigger than that, Pam Laricchia has created an set of introductory e-mails about unschooling.  I haven&#39;t seen off of it, but I&#39;ve seen some and it seems wonderful.  So anyone here who&#39;s new to unschooling might want to sign up for this series.  It comes to each person individually, so it&#39;s not a problem to sign up later.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingjoyfully.ca">http://www.livingjoyfully.ca</a> (the middle link on top; I LOVE her opening screen at her website, and she made it herself)<br/>
<br/>
Either of those could be sent to friends or relatives who ask, but who don&#39;t want information as extensive as my website or Joyce&#39;s!  <br/>
