<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302533941">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your critical comments on my post.  I appreciate your always <br/>
keeping your eye on what&#39;s best for the children.  That&#39;s why I&#39;m on <br/>
your lists.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go easy on how you explain things that are feel-good ideas but not so<br/>
absolute.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely -- actually as I wrote it I realized that my modeling and <br/>
living it are the only real ways to explain it.  And it&#39;s tricky -- just <br/>
as what we teach spiritually and religiously can be challenging (i.e. if <br/>
God is in everything, why did he make our dog blind?)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;Any life they choose&quot; isn&#39;t a promise anyone can make to anyone.<br/>
Honesty and living in the moment are way better than new-age fantasy<br/>
future scenarios.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Actually for me this is honesty and living in the moment.  Don&#39;t worry, <br/>
I&#39;m extremely practical and grounded -- sorry that my words didn&#39;t <br/>
convey that.  I am not at all into fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This leaves the problem of other children allegedly having chosen<br/>
abusive and sexual molesting parents.<br/>
It&#39;s not really a sound principle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is where we disagree but this isn&#39;t the place to discuss this.  <br/>
Just to be clear, I lived a very traumatic childhood including sexual <br/>
abuse_ so for me,_ I do know what I am talking about.  And I also <br/>
understand how what I wrote could be painful to others. Sorry.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If someone comes over and beats your child up, will you calmly accept<br/>
that with love on the grounds that your son attracted that energy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Of course not - that&#39;s ridiculous -- that would be denying my energy.  I <br/>
am the most protective mother you can meet ... I will fight anyone who <br/>
tries to mess with my children and because of that I sometimes see <br/>
threat where there is none. <br/>
<br/>
What I was saying is that I can now value and respect my husband&#39;s <br/>
intuition - just as mine is valid, so is his.  Sorry for mixing it up <br/>
with &quot;new-age&quot; language ...  I can see if you thought I was a bimbo who <br/>
blindly followed others&#39; leads why you would be concerned.  Not to worry ...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sorry to rain on your rainbow parade, but I&#39;d really prefer for this<br/>
list (my list) to stick with what&#39;s immediately useful and positive<br/>
to anyone, and not venture into juju-magic that blames victims.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hey, I like rain -- but seriously I understand you&#39;d like me to be more <br/>
practical and concrete with my posts. And for the record, I do believe <br/>
in magic.  However &quot;blame the victim&quot; is not in my vocabulary.  <br/>
<br/>
Respectfully,<br/>
Deborah, j.m.</div>
