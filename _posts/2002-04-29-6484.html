<br/>
Years ago in one of John Holt&#39;s newsletters someone made a suggestion that I <br/>
followed.  It was to have a journal for each child and make notations of <br/>
POSITIVE things about that person in it.<br/>
<br/>
I usually did an entry once a month, and put in a picture from that time.  <br/>
Also tucked into their books are other info about them --  a concert program <br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
One of my sons asked to borrow his book to show his girlfriend.  When he <br/>
returned it, he said, &quot;I&#39;ve always looked at the pictures, but this time I <br/>
read what you&#39;ve written.&quot;  He seemed to be very pleased.<br/>
<br/>
It has been fairly easy to maintain, and gives a wonderful record of the <br/>
passing time, and points out the wonderful things about each of the kids --<br/>

Where were you when my kids were little? I wish I had thought of this when<br/>
my oldest was little. (he&#39;s almost 21 now)<br/>
