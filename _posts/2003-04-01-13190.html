Cracking up here!   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed the same thing! But maybe it&#39;s that the more &quot;out of the <br/>
mainstream&quot; they are, the more &quot;tradtional&quot; they feel they need to be in <br/>
other parts of their lives. I have friends who feel that certain parts of <br/>
their lives should be VERY conservative, because they do have an alternative <br/>
lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
With my VERY traditional/conservative background, I think every step away <br/>
from mainstream in more liberating. Those already alternative folks may find <br/>
my steps just too &quot;far out&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
The New Mexico homeschooling list is a fragile and boring little thing, <br/>
because the structured folks are defensive and don&#39;t want the taint from the <br/>
wild ones.  There aren&#39;t so many activities in town for homeschoolers these <br/>
days.  There&#39;s a Harry Potter Tournament Thursday afternoons, and so a more <br/>
conservative group put a park-meeting playgroup on Thursday at the same time, <br/>
two miles from there (in a town 15+ miles across and deep).  It was pointed <br/>
out on the list that it was a conflict.  Nobody said &quot;NO, it&#39;s a PROTEST.&quot;  <br/>
Nobody even said &quot;Oh, *really*?&quot; So every week we get a reminder about that <br/>
playgroup meeting.  And every week Holly and her buds go play Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>
(I am getting to a point, honest.)<br/>
<br/>
Someone new came on and asked &quot;What curriculum to you all use and why?&quot;  I <br/>
gave a mild unschooing answer and got JUMPED by a couple or three people <br/>
saying I was ALWAYS blah blah blah.  That list doesn&#39;t usually even get one <br/>
post per DAY, and I rarely say anything about unschooling.  It&#39;s one of the <br/>
lamest lists ever, but has its use when a law changes or there&#39;s a change of <br/>
displays at the museum, y&#39;know?<br/>
<br/>
So time passed, it was quiet, and someone new came on wanting to aggressively <br/>
organize a pre-school co-op at her house, parents help on a schedule, <br/>
vegetarian organic lunches, they would pay her a bit and help or pay her more <br/>
if not helping, very Prussian organization altogether, more forward  and <br/>
organized than the list was used to, but I hung back and said nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Someone inquired lightly about her beliefs (didn&#39;t say &quot;are you Christian?&quot; <br/>
but that was the question, I think) and someone else said it wasn&#39;t really <br/>
legal to run a school from a home in New Mexico, and so what was she wanting <br/>
to charge money for?   <br/>
<br/>
Again, very vague and tentative kind of communication.<br/>
<br/>
The woman came back on and said (I THINK, maybe I should just go find it) she <br/>
was living with her two husbands and their son, one husband is Black, they <br/>
want to emphasize racial acceptance, yammered on a bit, and I could feel the <br/>
conservatives withering and the &#39;new age&#39; faction covering their eyes and <br/>
shaking their heads slowly.<br/>
<br/>
There was a great long silence.   <br/>
<br/>
I never volunteered to her any personal information or support, not even on <br/>
the side, because although her marital/sexual stuff doesn&#39;t bother me in the <br/>
least,  her intent to run a school and call it homeschooling really DID <br/>
bother me.  And her oblivion about first discovering who was on the list and <br/>
what they felt about even hanging out with unschoolers, let alone alternative <br/>
hedonists, was amusing.<br/>
<br/>
So for a change I observed in silent amusement.  It was like watching a very <br/>
slow-motion flower-cart wreck in the set for the marketplace  of the recent <br/>
Disney version of Roger&#39;s and Hammerstein Cinderella.  All cartoon-colorful <br/>
and fantasy-worldly, with no soundtrack.  Flowers fly up and the picture <br/>
freezes without it even mattering where they fall or what happens next.<br/>
