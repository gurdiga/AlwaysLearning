<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811470593">OK, for fear of being flamed, I have hesitated in sending this message, but <br/>
my curiosity is getting the best of me.  I am fairly new to unschooling, I have <br/>
been homeschooling for 4 years, and this is my first year of unschooling.  <br/>
Around our house, TV isn&#39;t something we watch a lot of.  Yes, we watch a ton of <br/>
videos, we have quite a collection of videos, and the kids usually pick videos <br/>
of interest to them from the library.  My question is for the people that do <br/>
not put limits on what their kids watch, and again, please don&#39;t flame me, I <br/>
am not trying to ask a dumb question and I really hate groups that start <br/>
flaming.  If your child chooses to watch something along the lines of borderline <br/>
pornography, or full blown pornography, do you put an end to that, or are you <br/>
letting them watch it or has that not become an issue in anyone&#39;s home? I guess <br/>
that is something I wouldn&#39;t want to walk in and see my kids watching and I <br/>
would hope that other parents would feel the same. Again, I am just asking a <br/>
question, not trying to start an all out war.  Susan<br/>

<br/>
Susan:<br/>
<br/>
Good question!  My daughter has always had the opportunity to watch <br/>
movies and occasionally TV where nudity or lovemaking happens.  We <br/>
have talked about pornography.  Easy to do since it comes to most <br/>
free email accounts all the time.  We have discussed how it uses <br/>
women and often denigrates them, turning them into pleasure objects <br/>
for men.  Yes, I know there are all kinds of variations of <br/>
pornography, but 99% of what sells is men using women to satisfy <br/>
themselves.  And we have talked about and watched some films in which <br/>
people make love, usually just a clip within the movie, but if it is <br/>
done very well, it can be quite beautiful.  I want her to know that <br/>
good sex is beautiful and enjoyable for both parties.  <br/>
<br/>
So, yes, she is allowed to see these things.  More often than not we <br/>
watch together.  And until recently (she&#39;s 16) she did not have much <br/>
interest in this type of thing.  Now she does, so we watch from time <br/>
to time.  No, we do not rent adult videos, or even some of the X <br/>
rated popular films.  She has never expressed an interest in these <br/>
and on a few occasions when she has been at friends&#39; homes and they <br/>
put these kinds of videos on (mostly teen boys do this) she has left <br/>
the room because she did not want to watch.  But we have watched <br/>
quite a few R movies.  <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite films is a very scary murder mystery titled &quot;Don&#39;t <br/>
Look Now&quot; with a young Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie.  Besides <br/>
being so scary my husband won&#39;t watch it, it has one of the nicest <br/>
love-making scenes in all of filmdom, I think.  One of Dd&#39;s all-time <br/>
favorites is &quot;Pretty Woman,&quot; and another is &quot;Flashdance,&quot;  and yet <br/>
another that she has watched many times is &quot;Dirty Dancing.&quot;  Her most <br/>
recent favorites are the French film, &quot;Amelie,&quot; and &quot;Center Stage.&quot;  <br/>
All of these have sex scenes, and she loves all of them.  And she is <br/>
no more inclined to go out and try sex than she was before watching <br/>
them.   <br/>
<br/>
On the plus side she is not inclined to be interested in any of the <br/>
very exploitative TV shows about men and women getting together, <br/>
especially these &quot;reality&quot; things that have men selecting women or <br/>
women selecting men.  <br/>
<br/>
The real bottom-line, however, is time.  She really doesn&#39;t spend <br/>
much of her time in front of a TV.  She is a very busy teen, with <br/>
hours of figure skating practice each day, a part-tim job at the <br/>
library, and many activities in which she is involved.  Often she <br/>
will start to watch something then drift over to the piano and start <br/>
working on a piece she is practicing.  Or she will have the TV on <br/>
while she is working on her clothing designs, sewing.  Or she will <br/>
prefer to listen to her favorite CDs, dancing and working out.  TV is <br/>
just background noise more often than not. So I just don&#39;t worry <br/>
about it.  She has a good head on her shoulders and I think she can <br/>
handle whatever comes along.   So, yes, we do watch many different <br/>
things on TV and on videos, but only when we have time, when we are <br/>
so inclined, which is not very often.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856357027">Hi!  Welcome!  I&#39;ve never seen any flaming on this<br/>
list, ever.  We&#39;re all grown ups here.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My question is for the people that do not put limits<br/>
&gt;on what their kids watch, ....... If your child<br/>
&gt;chooses to watch something along the lines of <br/>
&gt;borderline pornography, or full blown pornography,<br/>
&gt;do you put an end to that, or are you letting them<br/>
&gt;watch it or has that not become an issue in anyone&#39;s<br/>
&gt;home? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well we don&#39;t have any pornography in our home, but we<br/>
do have some movies with pretty explicit love scenes. <br/>
Shakepeare in Love is a great example because there is<br/>
a lot of very obvious sex in the movie and we watched<br/>
it together recently.  My son Thomas, who has special<br/>
needs that I just went into regarding tv in another<br/>
post, has really sophisticated taste in storytelling<br/>
and movies.  He wants to be a director.  He loves<br/>
Lawrence of Arabia, Fiddler on the Roof, and<br/>
Shakespeare, as well as action movies.  So he<br/>
specially requested this movie and has been watching<br/>
it recently.  When we get to the sex parts he hides<br/>
his face and/or asks us to fast forward.  It&#39;s not<br/>
ditrubing to him, but he doesn&#39;t want to see it.  He<br/>
says &quot;I know what sex is.  It&#39;s grownups kissing and<br/>
cuddling, and doing other stuff.  I don&#39;t know what<br/>
other stuff, because I am just a kid.&quot;  But he doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to watch it, even though he finds merit and value<br/>
in the rest of the film.  When he watched Franco<br/>
Zeferelli&#39;s Romeo and Juliet, there is slight nudity<br/>
but no overt sex, so he was quite comfortable with<br/>
that and watched it about 6 times while we had it from<br/>
the library.  He&#39;ll be 7 in Dec.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funny thing, but my 5 year old son&#39;s all time favorite movie (has <br/>
been for about 2 years) is Dirty Dancing (which he calls &quot;Baby&quot; <br/>
after Jennifer Grey&#39;s character.)  He doesn&#39;t get squirmy or turn <br/>
away from the one real sex scene in the movie, but then it&#39;s very <br/>
implied and artfully done and not graphic at all.  He often says <br/>
(like if we&#39;re reading a book or watching a show where little boys <br/>
say Ewwww! or something about kissing)  &quot;I like kissing!  Kissing is <br/>
nice.  So is cuddling.&quot;  He&#39;s very physically affectionate that <br/>
way.  We call him our Cuddlebug.  <br/>
<br/>
But what I think he really loves in that movie is the music, and the <br/>
dancing.  He wants to sing and dance and play music.  It&#39;s his <br/>
passion.  How we wish we could get him a piano!!  He&#39;s wanted one <br/>
since he was 2.  You should see how rapt and mezmerized he gets <br/>
whenever we are around live music (a fair amount in our artsy <br/>
community) and how he makes friends with the musicians and soon has <br/>
them showing him notes scooching over on their piano bench for him.  <br/>
I love the way he lays his palm or his cheek against an instrument <br/>
when they let him (bass, piano, guitar, etc) to FEEL the music.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t know where to find it on TV (we have sattellite) and at the <br/>
moment they wont even watch people holding hands, let alone kissing. <br/>
They self-censor.<br/>
As they get older maybe they will want to watch films with sexual <br/>
content but I imagine that at that age they can make up their own minds. <br/>
They may choose never to see it. I&#39;m 34 and have never seen any porn, <br/>
nor do I choose to watch it. I like films with plots and special <br/>
effects, porn doesn&#39;t really have either.<br/>
I imagine it will be a non-issue for several years too. When we move <br/>
home we will be back to 4 channels, 2 of which are the BBC. Cable and <br/>
satellite will be out of our financial reach (waaaaah, no more <br/>
Stargate). Maybe they will watch it at someone else&#39;s house but the <br/>
decision will be there&#39;s and not mine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067102372">One of the girls on Lexie&#39;s soccer team is in special education, <br/>
diagnosed LD, has all sorts of problems in school, etc.  I suggested the <br/>
mom homeschool and she said &quot;Oh no, I couldn&#39;t ever sit with her for six <br/>
hours a day doing school work, that&#39;d be worse than it is now.&quot;  So I <br/>
spoke with her a bit about unschooling, and how it works.  We were at <br/>
the pizza party for the team and I was saying how in life there are so <br/>
many opportunities to learn and that one doesn&#39;t need to learn by doing <br/>
worksheets, etc.  Janene just then walked up and said &quot;mommy I need more <br/>
money.&quot;  I gave her a dollar.  Janene said &quot;No, mommy I need two <br/>
dollars, cause one dollar is only four quarters and I need eight <br/>
quarters so I need two dollar bills.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
After explaining to Janene how we didn&#39;t have money to burn on buying <br/>
little bouncy balls which are dangerous to the dogs, I turned to the mom <br/>
and said &#39;that&#39;s how unschooling works!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1361279010">I was looking for what I had written about pornography and Marty, and found <br/>
this instead.  I&#39;m still looking for the other one and will bring some of it <br/>
here rather than try to remember and write it all.  <br/>
<br/>
This was posted on the unschooling discussion list last summer--those who&#39;ve <br/>
read it can merrily skip on by, but it will be new to some here.  And as <br/>
preview, this is a kid who HAS looked at some porn, and not on TV (we don&#39;t have <br/>
cable) but computer.<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
The first reference was, I think, about someone who had come and ranted that <br/>
our recommendations about unschooling showed us to be lazy hedonists.  The <br/>
rest is me, June 7, 2003.<br/>
---------------<br/>
-=-I pretty much got sick to my stomach reading that post.   If only she <br/>
could see the wonderful things that have come from this unschooling life <br/>
change.  <br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well, the same day I read that we were lazy hedonists, this happened:<br/>
<br/>
The final day, graduation from the Junior Police Academy, they march in like <br/>
soldiers, doing face drills and filing in and pledging allegience (we briefed <br/>
Marty on that this week; he said he knew it from a humorous version in the <br/>
bathroom, just leave out the joke parts)...<br/>
<br/>
Ceremonial this&#39;n&#39;that, certificates, pins, Marty was awarded a certificate <br/>
as &quot;Top Gun&quot; (electronic target practice guns, F.A.T.S. and paintball guns) <br/>
which also came with $15 gift certificate to a sporting goods store.  Seven <br/>
or <br/>
eight other kids (of 32) got awards like most pushups, most improved, most <br/>
physically fit male.<br/>
<br/>
Of Marty, I thought &quot;All that Nintendo Duck Hunt paid off.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then we ate good local barbecue, served up by their instructors, and as <br/>
people were taking pictures and saying goodbye, I went up to one of his <br/>
instructors <br/>
and sat to thank him.  He said Marty was just a joy to work with.  Chit chat <br/>
you&#39;d expect.<br/>
<br/>
Then he said the big thing.   (Brace yourselves.   And I really like the guy.)<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;You can always tell a kid who comes from a family with discipline, <br/>
with rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said Marty was really well behaved and enthusiastic and cooperative.  (I <br/>
wish I had the exact quotes there; I wish I had VIDEOTAPE.)<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;We hardly have any rules at our house.  We just tell them to always <br/>
make the best choice, to be helpful and not hurt people.&quot;  (That&#39;s maybe 85% <br/>
close to exact words; I need my audio back!)<br/>
<br/>
He said they had talked about a lot of things like that over the week.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to make light again, because it was maybe kinda tacky to counter <br/>
&quot;you can always tell&quot; with &quot;GOTCHA!  Wrong!  CAN&#39;T always tell.&quot;  So I said, <br/>
&quot;Y&#39;know, Monday was really his first day at school of any sort.   It was his <br/>
first <br/>
day taking notes or anything like that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh, right, he&#39;s homeschooled, right?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Most of the homeschooled kids I&#39;ve met were not so good at social <br/>
interactions.  Marty&#39;s really confident and outgoing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told him he had gone home and re-written his notes from Monday, and had <br/>
been really focussed on his assignments and getting ready for the next day.  <br/>
He <br/>
said &quot;Initiative!  Good!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Probably there was nobody there who was as eager and excited to be there as <br/>
Marty was.  So we made some more sweet chitchat and that was it.  <br/>
<br/>
I could hardly wait to get into the van and close the doors so I could tell <br/>
Keith, Marty and Holly what he had said about discipline and rules.  We <br/>
talked <br/>
about that most of the way home.  Holly can hardly believe that some people <br/>
think that rules upon rules will make people &quot;good&quot; away from home.  It just <br/>
makes no sense to her.   <br/>
<br/>
Marty said one of the kids got in bad trouble this afternoon, threatened with <br/>
being sent home, for throwing pieces of rubber at other kids, and for <br/>
throwing paintballs.  One broke on the exercise track.  NOT at the targets, <br/>
where the <br/>
mess was supposed to be.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty couldn&#39;t fathom why someone would be at such a cool place and act that <br/>
way.  <br/>
<br/>
But Marty had also told me there were two people there who hadn&#39;t even wanted <br/>
to be there.  I didn&#39;t ask (yet) whether this kid was one of those.  Marty <br/>
was exhausted when he got home and went to bed at 10:00.<br/>
<br/>
This evidence is really important, that someone who works with kids a lot <br/>
(Police Athletic League volunteer), someone who&#39;s in law enforcement, sees an <br/>
enthusiastic, well-behaved, cooperative kid, and is confident that he came <br/>
from a <br/>
house with discipline and rules.<br/>
<br/>
Discipline and rules?   All-fired flaming hedonists?  (Whatever the <br/>
accusation was.)<br/>
<br/>
Neither of the above.<br/>

Subject:  Re: Pornography and teens (long, true)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But boys get their curiosity blocked because there isn&#39;t any<br/>
acceptable &quot;pornography&quot; for boys. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Whether it&#39;s &quot;acceptable&quot; or not, there is a fair amount of written<br/>
fanfiction involving characters from comic book series, fantasy series, and<br/>
even video games. Some of it is just adventure/romance, and some is at least<br/>
as graphic as romance novels. Maybe it&#39;s for and by girls, though, I don&#39;t<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Two nights ago I wanted to play Destruct-o-Match on Neopets. Both Marty (14)<br/>
and Holly (11) play Neopets, and I have an account (just so I can play that<br/>
pattern-falling cascading game myself without having to ask Marty) and our<br/>
Mac Powerstrip we use to get to recent files, recent programs, recent sites<br/>
was FULL of porn stuff. I didn&#39;t open any, the titles themselves were gross<br/>
enough. OH!! I had wanted to get to Netflix to cancel getting a DVD I had<br/>
just rented (which didn&#39;t work).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well anyway, usually I use it to get to Neopets games page.<br/>
<br/>
I called Marty in, and said &quot;Marty, this is a bit much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He said &quot;Most of it was pop-ups mom, I didn&#39;t really look at it all much.<br/>
Just some.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I asked him if he could cover those kinds of trails over so I didn&#39;t have to<br/>
know and so Holly wouldn&#39;t accidently see. I said he needed to open a bunch<br/>
of CLEAN websites and look at some better stuff so that would be on the<br/>
trail. He told me he could delete the trail. I said I didn&#39;t think he<br/>
could, that I had even asked Leon, one of the developers, who said it only<br/>
works on the Mac OSX version, not 9.<br/>
<br/>
But Marty is a teenaged boy, so besides his porn curiosity he has a computer<br/>
facility. And he figured out a three-step process to erase that list through<br/>
Internet Explorer.<br/>
<br/>
If I say &quot;NO, never ever even look,&quot; I risk losing the communication we have<br/>
within which he will just tell me what he&#39;s seen and knows and where it came<br/>
from.<br/>
<br/>
But that story has gone two days now. At first he was embarrassed and &quot;Mom,<br/>
okay, I know, don&#39;t talk to me about it anymore.&quot; So I said I wanted to talk<br/>
to him one more time the next day, about whether he knows the reasons people<br/>
object to kids looking at porn.<br/>
<br/>
The next day came and had nearly passed without me remembering, when he came<br/>
and said, &quot;Okay, mom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You wanted to talk to me about porn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh! Thanks. I hadn&#39;t remembered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I asked if he knew the objections. He said no. I said, &quot;In all your<br/>
reading and listening you haven&#39;t heard objections to porn?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, that its illegal for me to see it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I talked to him about degradation of women, about creating unhealthy and<br/>
unreasonable expectations in marriages, and that normal sex wasn&#39;t like that.<br/>
He said &quot;Well, DUH, mom!&quot; I said some people were messed up by WANTING it<br/>
to be. He seemed surprised that that could happen.<br/>
<br/>
I told him that some of those who are filmed are not quite volunteers and<br/>
told him two stories, one of the mom of girls his age he&#39;s known his whole<br/>
life, who was photographed as a kid for posed stills which were sold out of<br/>
Oklahoma. It was shocking for him, and I don&#39;t know much detail, but naming<br/>
a person he knew who had been victimized was effective. I told him of a<br/>
drug dealer and illegal snake importer my younger half-brother had taken up<br/>
with some years back, who videod him and his then-girlfriend, and used it as<br/>
blackmail (she was from a Mormon family) to get them to deliver drugs for him.<br/>
<br/>
Then I said I didn&#39;t think it was the most horrible thing people could do, to<br/>
look at pictures, but he REALLY needed to be careful because it&#39;s illegal and<br/>
I didn&#39;t want the county coming to talk to me about anything they were doing.<br/>
<br/>
(I had a similar moment with Holly later that evening about going outside in<br/>
a teensy fancy t-shirt and nylon pajama pants, no shoes, in January, while<br/>
she has a sore throat. &quot;Illegal,&quot; I told her, for parents to allow that,<br/>
and let&#39;s not draw attention to a loose lifestyle by being outside in the<br/>
cold without proper attire.)<br/>
<br/>
I told Marty that women tend to prefer word-porn and so they don&#39;t get<br/>
caught, but pictures were easy to find and more offensive.<br/>
<br/>
I told him one danger was obsession. I didn&#39;t go into that much, because<br/>
some of the original arguments about obsession were the cost. I did have a<br/>
friend years ago who had a large collection of porn videos that had cost him<br/>
$60 to $80 apiece. Had he had the internet, his obsession wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
ruined his finances, nor left a mountain of evidence to shock his mom.<br/>
(That friend had a sex change operation since then, so I think it was his way<br/>
of dealing with deeper psychological and biological situations, and that was<br/>
way too much to tell Marty.)<br/>
<br/>
Then I asked him if he had ANY idea how much trouble some other boys his age<br/>
would get into if their parents caught them having looked at that kind of<br/>
stuff on the computer. He said &quot;Lots?&quot; I talked about loss of computer<br/>
accesss, grounding, and physical spanking by some big grown man.<br/>
<br/>
He said he had been mostly embarrassed when I first talked to him because he<br/>
had had friends in the house. They couldn&#39;t hear us, but he had to leave<br/>
where they were, talk to me, and go back in there, and it just embarrassed<br/>
him. I said in those worst-case situations, the parents would have called<br/>
all of the friends&#39; parents, said to come get them, told them why, and some<br/>
of THEM would have been grounded and in trouble just for hanging out with<br/>
someone who had looked at porn.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt he really fully believes me on those things, or maybe he can&#39;t fathom<br/>
a parent doing that to a child.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind having a kid who can&#39;t readily imagine being hit by an angry,<br/>
grown man or can&#39;t imagine being told &quot;You stay in your room for a month and<br/>
don&#39;t even touch a computer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who has read this far and is offended, I didn&#39;t mean to throw this<br/>
out to offend anyone. It&#39;s a candid, current situation involving a real teen.<br/>
<br/>
And usually the trail on this real teen&#39;s internet use has Neopets, AoN (a<br/>
role-playing game), humor sites, and in-person friends&#39; journals. People<br/>
who know Marty wouldn&#39;t think of him as a nasty kid. He&#39;s not. He is coming<br/>
into adulthood, though, and he&#39;s curious.<br/>
<br/>
I think similar to make-up, if it is declared &quot;only for adults,&quot; and a girl<br/>
waits and waits and WAITS until she can use it and is then unlikely to just<br/>
let it go unused, a boy who is slapped away from any glimpse of nudity until<br/>
he&#39;s eighteen is GOING to immerse himself in his newfound access for a while<br/>
the moment he gets a chance.<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I were out grocery shopping, and talking about Kirby turning<br/>
seventeen this year. I said I used to want to have a big eighteenth birthday<br/>
celebration for him, like a graduation, but I no longer want to do that. I<br/>
don&#39;t want to declare an end to his learning, nor to his living with us if he<br/>
wants to stay. Keith said he had no ideas either, but that was fine. Said<br/>
&quot;Well, I&#39;m not going to get him drunk and take him to a whorehouse, so<br/>
there&#39;s probably going to be no rite of passage.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby wouldn&#39;t want any of that anyway. ANOTHER good thing. When he turns<br/>
eighteen, he&#39;ll have more legal rights, but there won&#39;t be the effect of huge<br/>
tension released. He&#39;ll have no restrictions suddenly lifted.<br/>
<br/>
I know this won&#39;t suit everyone&#39;s belief system, but it is working with us to<br/>
produce mature, calm, considerate, communicative teenaged boys. They&#39;re not<br/>
angry with us, they&#39;re not reactionary, they&#39;re not sneaky.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My dh has shared that he believes that when the family is<br/>
unhealthy, porn more likely beomces an addiction to fill a hole. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I agree. I think it&#39;s the same as other &quot;internet dangers.&quot; If a child has<br/>
nothing else to do and no affirmation of wholeness, the internet can be an<br/>
escape from what seems a lack of life. But when life is big and real and<br/>
happy, the child will be there, in his own real life.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really appreciate hearing how you&#39;ve dealt with so many of the<br/>
issues I&#39;ve raised. Your perspective and style of interaacting with<br/>
your kids is refreshing and gives me hope.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. Sometimes when I write those things so plainly I worry that I&#39;ll<br/>
cause more damage than good in some families. But since things ARE going so<br/>
well with my boys (and I hope it stays that way) it seems worth continuing to<br/>
share.<br/>

&gt; I was looking for what I had written about pornography and Marty, and<br/>
found<br/>
&gt; this instead.  I&#39;m still looking for the other one and will bring some of<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; here rather than try to remember and write it all.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This was posted on the unschooling discussion list last summer--those<br/>
who&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; read it can merrily skip on by, but it will be new to some here.  And as<br/>
&gt; preview, this is a kid who HAS looked at some porn, and not on TV (we<br/>
don&#39;t have<br/>
&gt; cable) but computer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ---------<br/>
&gt; The first reference was, I think, about someone who had come and ranted<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; our recommendations about unschooling showed us to be lazy hedonists.  The<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The final day, graduation from the Junior Police Academy, they march in<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; soldiers, doing face drills and filing in and pledging allegience (we<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know, I&#39;m chatty today.  I had read this last summer, but didn&#39;t <br/>
comment at the time for whatever reason, lack of time or whatever.  <br/>
I wanted to mention that rites of passage are traditionally a <br/>
difficult task or challenge, performed either alone or often with <br/>
grown men, a male mentor, females for a girl, whatever.  Getting <br/>
drunk and going to the whorehouse is what, Porky&#39;s?  Americana?  <br/>
It&#39;s pop culture, but not really a real rite of passage.  I think <br/>
there is value in real rites of passage, helping a young person feel <br/>
like they are passing childhood and reaching new levels of <br/>
responsibility and a different chapter in their lives.  The reason <br/>
rites of passage have appeared in so many cultures and so many eras <br/>
is because they are valuable, when done right.  That&#39;s not just <br/>
rites welcoming you into adulthood, but all stages of life, <br/>
commemorating changes, growth and important events.  Americans act <br/>
like reaching age 18 is a rite of passage, but then we don&#39;t <br/>
actually DO anything to make that so.  So kids spend a lot of time <br/>
thinking they will feel differently after they turn 18 and then they <br/>
are disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
If I wanted to have a rite of passage ceremony for a son or a <br/>
daughter (not necessarily connected with a birthday or age) I would <br/>
think it would be about something that they had not been able or old <br/>
enough to do before that showed maturity, adult capability in some <br/>
fashion.  A trip taken on their own, responsibility in a challenging <br/>
situation, mastering a fear, learning something about themselves <br/>
that fosters a more adult understanding of themselves or other <br/>
people, or the world around them.  Knowing that they can be capable <br/>
all on their own is an important thing.  Sometimes it comes all on <br/>
it&#39;s own and you have to be able to recognize it when it happens and <br/>
help them celebrate their accomplishment.  If we wanted to plan <br/>
something, I think I would talk to the person in question about <br/>
whether they would be interested in such a ceremony, how formal or <br/>
informal to make it, whether it would be completely personal, or <br/>
whether they would like a little celebration afterwards to <br/>
comemorate their accomplishment, and helping them to design their <br/>
own experience in something that is meaningful to them.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this all depends on how spiritual your family is, how <br/>
interested your kids are in their spiritual and psychological <br/>
selves, or their place in society and their greater culture.  It&#39;s <br/>
not a matter of religion, but how comfortable you are with the <br/>
notion that ceremony can enhance life experiences and that internal <br/>
growth is a worthy goal.  <br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean that if you DON&#39;T want to have a rite of passage <br/>
that you are some kind of empty shallow person, just that it can be <br/>
a very valuable experience and mean a lot to a young person and <br/>
their family and/or supportive social circle or mentors.  It can <br/>
also give them that sense that so many of our teenagers are looking <br/>
for that they have crossed a threshold and are not seen as children <br/>
anymore.  Of course you have to follow suit and not TREAT them like <br/>
children, but then unschoolers don&#39;t really treat children <br/>
like &quot;children&quot; anyhow.  Just some thoughts on rites of passage.<br/>

Kirby is not going to need that.  When he moves out, that will be a passage <br/>

wants.  We&#39;re not sending him out against his will to college.  We&#39;re not forcing <br/>

done to people in European culture for generations, and except for the college <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm....So what if you never do any of those things,<br/>
or don&#39;t do them in the conventional sense?  Yeah, I<br/>
recognize that those are American rights of passage, I<br/>
guess I just feel like so many of our &quot;traditions&quot; to<br/>
mark lives are, well, lame.  <br/>
<br/>
I never graduated anything except kindergarten, not in<br/>
the traditional sense, though I had 5 various years of<br/>
college, but that was later, after I was on my own.  I<br/>
never went bar hopping or had any ceremonial bar trip<br/>
because by then I was already long past my wild, angry<br/>
rebel days when I was still surviving in an alcoholic<br/>
home, and I hate bars.  I&#39;m not sure what my rite of<br/>
passage might have been.  I did move out of the house<br/>
and was paying my own bills and taking care of myself<br/>
fairly early, but that&#39;s all clouded up with years<br/>
still living codependent with abusive guys (like dear<br/>
ol dad.)<br/>
<br/>
Tom (hubby) and I were talking about this and he says<br/>
his own real right of passage into adulthood was<br/>
moving out on his own, not with a friend/roomate.  He<br/>
says knowing that he could pay for his own<br/>
necessities, eat well, not just keep from starving,<br/>
and manage work and a social life, those things had<br/>
real personal meaning for him in learning his own<br/>
adult capabilities and depending on himself and<br/>
trusting his own judgement.<br/>
<br/>
I guess, in pondering it, my real right of passage was<br/>
when I made the decision to stop struggling to survive<br/>
with, and trying to win the approval from, parents who<br/>
would never be satisfied or healthy, and when I<br/>
decided to take responsibility for important decisions<br/>
in my life into my own hands.  That was when I was 14<br/>
and I nearly died from long illness and something in<br/>
me changed.  I decided I only get one life and I&#39;ll be<br/>
damned if I was going to let people who were so self<br/>
absorbed and abusive control it.  I still made<br/>
mistakes after that, and was occassionally bullied<br/>
into giving up my own authority on important<br/>
decisions, but it was definately a turning point for<br/>
me.  I forced my way out of institutional schooling at<br/>
the same time, and entered independent study and the<br/>
full time workforce.  I can&#39;t think of anything else<br/>
that would qualify more for me as a rite of passage to<br/>
adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If it&#39;s traditional among any people in ANY culture<br/>
&gt;then it is really a real rite of passage in that<br/>
&gt;real culture.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose that&#39;s true, but unutterably sad regarding<br/>
our &quot;culture.&quot;  Blech.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Each person has one life.<br/>
&gt;Some things are done well, some aren&#39;t.  Some<br/>
&gt;weddings are botched, some funerals are botched, but<br/>
&gt;those things are undeniably rites of passage.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I guess by &quot;done right&quot; I meant when you are talking<br/>
about an &quot;intentional&quot; right of passage.  There are<br/>
many things in life that are challenges or that mark<br/>
the beginning of a new time in our lives, but most of<br/>
them are not intentional, and many that are, are done<br/>
with little thought to them as marking a change in<br/>
life.  They&#39;re rites of passage, trials which change<br/>
us, often affecting our &quot;status&quot; and how others see us<br/>
or how we see ourselves, to be sure.  That doesn&#39;t<br/>
make them less valuable than intentional ones, often<br/>
more so, just that I was referring to engineered and<br/>
intentional rites of passage as possibly beneficial.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It can also give them that sense that so many of<br/>
our teenagers are looking for that they have crossed a<br/>

not just risking life and limb and being forced to<br/>
follow your &quot;duty.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We already don&#39;t treat him like a child, so there&#39;s<br/>
&gt;no big 18 privileges to look forward to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our culture makes a big deal about there being adult<br/>
&quot;privileges&quot; when they turn 18 though.  What are<br/>
those?  Voting?  Dying for their country?  They are<br/>
legally responsible at that age, and can be held both<br/>
accountable for their actions, as well as being able<br/>
to make decisions and enter into contracts without<br/>
another authority.  They can also be held accountable<br/>
for the actions of minor friends in their car, or at a<br/>
house where they are, or who are with them.  There are<br/>
&quot;privileges&quot; that our country bestows on them for<br/>
being 18, plus many people &quot;see&quot; an 18 year old<br/>
differently than a 17 year old.  I guess it could be<br/>
fun to make a certificate of some sort and have a<br/>
presentation at a birthday party where you emphasize<br/>
all the special &quot;privileges and responsibilities&quot; of<br/>
&quot;legal adulthood&quot; that they are now privy to (in a<br/>
humorous way,) as well as all the stuff they will not<br/>
have to do or put up with anymore.  As to the later,<br/>
not so much at home because they are unschooled, but<br/>
maybe in other places and from other people.  For that<br/>
matter I guess graduating HS has some merit after all,<br/>
as an escape from the institution finally.  I forgot<br/>
about that because I didn&#39;t get out that way.  I could<br/>
see something along the lines of a string of humorous<br/>
titles, like Bilbo&#39;s string of riddling titles to<br/>
Smaug in The Hobbit, applying to new status and/or<br/>
&quot;responsibilities&quot; and &quot;preiviliges.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 10yo is particularly fascinated with various age-related laws and <br/>
rules and always has been.  For instance- you have to be 14 to have <br/>
a &quot;real&quot; job with working papers, 16 to get a permit, 17 to get a <br/>
driver&#39;s license, 21 to legally purchase alcohol etc.  Aren&#39;t these <br/>
rites of passage in a way, albeit subtle ones with not much fanfare?<br/>
He&#39;s been attending skateboard camp since he was 7, and at this <br/>
particular camp they separate the &quot;mini-campers&quot; (7-9 year olds) <br/>
from the 10 and up crowd which gets special priveleges like being <br/>
able to stay up much later before lights out and being able to <br/>
participate in different activities such as Paintball.<br/>
It was definitely an exciting &quot;big deal&quot; to him when he attended <br/>
this past summer as an over 10 camper for the first time.<br/>
I&#39;m sure I could think of other things as well... so I guess I don&#39;t <br/>
really have a point except to say that even if we treat our children <br/>
with respect (i.e. not &quot;like a child&quot;) all along and carefully avoid <br/>
arbitrary age related privileges, they will *still* have big <br/>
(society determined) privileges to look forward to.<br/>
And while I like John Holt&#39;s ideas of childhood as a walled garden <br/>
(meaning they can do things or not as they feel ready however old <br/>
they are rather than according to an arbitrarily decided upon age), <br/>
I must say that my son finds these little age related milestones <br/>
very satisfying.  Mabye because they take the place of other rites <br/>
of passage that aren&#39;t a part of his unschooled life?  I&#39;m not <br/>
sure...<br/>
