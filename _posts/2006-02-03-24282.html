<br/>
We also co-sleep, and have done the musical bed thing.  The issue for you<br/>
husband, is it that he really would like some time with you, alone?  Is he<br/>
feeling like he doesn&#39;t get to be with his wife?  I notice that I can&#39;t get<br/>
in touch with the intimate parts of me if my son is in the room.  If your<br/>
husband wants to connect on an intimate level (and have fun), is there a way<br/>
you both could leave the &quot;family den&quot; for some fun, say in the living room?<br/>
Just a thought.  I know how hard it is for everybody&#39;s needs to be met in<br/>
this situation, and every family is different.  My husband has never had a<br/>
hard time with the co-sleeping.  He has had a very big hard time, though,<br/>
with me being a &quot;mom&quot; 24/7&quot; and not his mate...To your benefit, remember<br/>
that we are the only species who don&#39;t den with our family...<br/>

Hi all<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted here (or anywhere) in quite a while.  I need some <br/>
perspective.  My kids have always slept in our room.  As babies it <br/>
was something I insisted on, when I discovered the sleep benefits.  <br/>
As they grew older I tried getting them to sleep in their own rooms, <br/>
with the idea of &quot;that&#39;s how it&#39;s suppose to be&quot;, not because I <br/>
minded them in our bed.  My dh has never been thrilled with the <br/>
idea.  He accepted the babies, because he knew it really did help me <br/>
get more rest, but as they grew, he always made comments of them <br/>
sleeping in their own rooms.  The kids always fought the idea and <br/>
always ended up in our bed sometime in the night.  My dh didn&#39;t seem <br/>
to mind that.  He wanted them to atleast start out in their own room <br/>
though( alone time for us was his idea)  It was always a huge <br/>
struggle.  Lots of time for me getting them into bed, lots of <br/>
getting out of bed, being scared and eventually they would be in our <br/>
room anyway at some point in the night.  3 years ago, our son died.  <br/>
From that point on, we all slept in one room.  My now 15 yo stopped <br/>
after a couple of months (she had been sleeping in her own room <br/>
willingly from about the age of 10-11).<br/>
My now 9yo son and 6yo dd don&#39;t seem to have any desire to sleep in <br/>
their own rooms. They would sleep in the same room if they did go <br/>
upstairs, so it&#39;s not a matter of being completely alone.<br/>
I have no desire for them to leave.  My dh isn&#39;t home at night <br/>
usually 3 nights of the week til about 2 a.m.  In the summer it&#39;s 6 <br/>
nights a week.  We just downsized to a queen(it was free and our <br/>
king was really bad) and the kids sleep on cushions on the floor <br/>
next to the bed.  I thought this would make dh happier because he <br/>
atleast isn&#39;t crowded out of the bed anymore.  But it still is <br/>
bothering him.  He usually doesn&#39;t make a big deal.  Just snide <br/>
comments here and there.  But every once in a while he has a fit <br/>
about it in front of the kids and is mad that I&#39;m not backing him <br/>
up.  I remain calm and do see his side, but I also feel I &#39;m the one <br/>
that really has to make the effort and it seems futile anyway.  And <br/>
it&#39;s not something I want to do.  He&#39;s not willing to really go <br/>
through the process of putting them to be.  He thinks they should be <br/>
sent to bed and stay there, like he did as a child (or atleast <br/>
that&#39;s what he wishes could happen).  That never worked in the past, <br/>
but he doesn&#39;t want to hear logic or opinions, he just wants it to <br/>
be easy and done.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking I should just take a stand here.  Usually it blows <br/>
over, sometimes I make a little effort but end up back to our usual, <br/>
all going to sleep in my bed together, he accepts it&#39;s not happening <br/>
and we continue to all sleep in the room.  <br/>
I&#39;m thinking they will naturally want to sleep in their own rooms at <br/>
some point (like my oldest did)  My 9yo seems to want to, but gets <br/>
scared being alone still.  My 6 yo has no desire.<br/>
Also, my oldest went to high school and goes to sleep earlier than <br/>
everyone else.  The kids rooms are upstairs and they would keep her <br/>
awake if they were up there.<br/>
I make an effort for dh and I to have &quot;alone time&quot; at other times <br/>
than night.  Dh usually sleeps in late and we can have &quot;alone time&quot; <br/>
mid morning while the kids are busy doing thier own things, so I <br/>
really don&#39;t think that should be an issue with him.  I&#39;m way to <br/>
tired at night usually, anyway. (Especially if I&#39;ve just spent a lot <br/>
of energy getting the kids in their own rooms.)<br/>
So am I being wrong or stubborn or lazy or a clingy mother here?<br/>
Should I put his wants over ours?  How can I do that without being <br/>
resentful.<br/>
Should i ask him to accept this and realize it is temporary (though <br/>
not short term)<br/>
I would really like to let the kids choose when they are ready.  I <br/>
would like them to feel completely welcome by both of us.<br/>
I think I should really take a stand here, but wanted some <br/>
perspective first.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

Years ago, so I don&#39;t remember where, I visited a stately home in  <br/>
England, somewhere south of Cambridge I think, and there was a bed  <br/>

the docents said they thought it was for a whole family.  There was a  <br/>

or two, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Probably I have some details wrong, but I remember the big, big bed.<br/>
<br/>
 From what I know of human sleeping arrangements, it&#39;s not always  <br/>
family together, but it&#39;s not commonly single humans in separate  <br/>
&quot;dens&quot; or huts or caves.  That&#39;s not safe or sensible.  In some  <br/>
cultures (historically? currently too maybe?)  women and children  <br/>
slept together in a communal kind of place, I think.<br/>

I hope some anthropology students somewhere are gathering all that  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769941143">From Meredith Small&#39;s book Our Babies, Ourselves:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In almost all cultures around the globe today, babies sleep with an<br/>
adult and children sleep with parent or other silings.  It is only in<br/>
industrialized Western societies such as North America and some<br/>
countries in Europe that sleep has become a prvite affair; the<br/>
comparison of the latter pattern with that of other groups highlights<br/>
one of the major ways in which the West stands out from the rest of<br/>
humanity in the treatment of children.  In one study of 186<br/>
nonindustial societies, children sleep in the same bed as their<br/>
parents in 46 percent of the nonindustrial cultures, and in a separate<br/>
bed but in the same room in an additional 21 percent.  In other words<br/>
in 67 percent of the cultures around the world, children sleep in the<br/>
company of others.  More significant in none of those 186 cultures do<br/>
babies sleep in a separate place before they are at least on year old.<br/>
 In another survey of 172 societies, all infants in all cultures do<br/>
some co-sleeping at night, even if only for a few hours. The United<br/>
States consistently stands out as the only society in wihich babies<br/>
are routinely placed in their own beds and in their own rooms; in one<br/>
survey of a hundred societies, only parents in the United States<br/>
maintained separate quarters for their babies, and in another study of<br/>
twelve societies, all parents but Americans slept with their babies<br/>
until weaning.&quot;<br/>
