<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664877076">one of my great joys is listening to my children learn language.<br/>
<br/>
Janene said to me the other day, &quot;mommy, you are really well at <br/>
typing.&quot;  I had to think for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just so cool listening to her figure it all out.  I didn&#39;t correct <br/>
her, I just thanked her for her compliment.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
It is so annoying when people say &quot;you do that really good.&quot;<br/>
