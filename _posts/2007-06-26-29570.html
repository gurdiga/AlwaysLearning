practice. Play, if you play. Talk about it if it comes up organically. Just<br/>
don&#39;t mention a need for them to practice. Don&#39;t mention the cost. Breathe<br/>
deeply and know that if *you* had signed up for lessons you really didn&#39;t<br/>
like, no one would shame you into going anyway. Breathe some more.<br/>
Hannah was part of a couple of singing groups. One was a casual, summer<br/>
singers group which met 5x/week for an hour, for 6 weeks. They sang in<br/>
public a few times. It was ideal for us and our life. She wanted to continue<br/>
singing, so we hooked up with a Girls Chorale. They met over 9 months, once<br/>
weekly for a very intense rehearsal. Hannah&#39;s love of the piano was sparked<br/>
here. We didn&#39;t do lessons, we fingered and figured out the songs she liked<br/>
and we picked up fun-looking books. She didn&#39;t want to rehearse at home for<br/>
the Chorale; sometimes she didn&#39;t want to go to group rehearsals. When she<br/>
did participate, she loved it and it did spark something in *her* to want to<br/>
return. She loved the retreat they had with a local opera singer. She loved<br/>
playing the songs on the piano. She loved singing the songs. Not the same<br/>
experience other girls got from the groups. Definitely a Hannah experience.<br/>
A joyful one at that.<br/>
I know the expectations of the other grownups for the other kids were<br/>
different than mine. We met the core criteria and did the rest Hannah&#39;s way.<br/>
I smiled at a lot of &quot;clucking&quot; mothers. My kid was always happy to be<br/>
there. We were participating on a scholarship, which could make one feel<br/>
even *more* obligated to fully participate, so as to better appreciate the<br/>
gift or somesuch ;) I worked my way through. This gift is a gift of Joy. If<br/>
Singing is bringing Joy, then the scholarship has done it&#39;s job. To provide<br/>
Singing without the Joy by making it full of have-tos and musts, cannot be<br/>
the goal here... what&#39;d be left to sing about? I found a way to best<br/>
appreciate all the gifts in the scenario, first being the gift of my<br/>
daughter and her love of music. We got Joy out of Singing and definitely got<br/>
someone else&#39;s money&#39;s worth!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-46694735">My daughter takes violin lessons.  She goes once a week, for a 30 minute<br/>
lesson.  She is 8.  She has taken them for a little over a year - off & on.<br/>
<br/>
She decided she wanted to learn violin after watching a young woman play<br/>
with her teacher at our local homeschool music recital.  I put off<br/>
finding a teacher for a bit, because I thought she just wanted to be able to<br/>
pick up the violin & play like they did.  But she kept asking, so I<br/>
finally tracked down a teacher.  And luckily, Rose is a wonderful teacher<br/>
for Sierra.<br/>
Sierra rarely practices.  I sometimes ask if she wants to play.  Usually for<br/>
someone else - her dad, her friends.  She likes performing.<br/>
But she doesn&#39;t just pick the instrument up to &quot;practice&quot; her songs.  And<br/>
sometimes she says she doesn&#39;t want to go to her lesson.<br/>
So we&#39;ll take some time off.  I just call & cancel some lessons - maybe 2<br/>
weeks, maybe 4.  Then when her next lesson is coming up again, I&#39;ll ask if<br/>
she&#39;s ready to go back.  If she is, great.  If she&#39;s not, I go with that.<br/>
She really likes Rose & they have a nice relationship.  And Sierra is having<br/>
fun with her music.<br/>
Isn&#39;t that the goal?<br/>

I think there is confusion about whether your daughter indeed has ALL the<br/>
choices available (as you put it) or whether she only has those choices that<br/>
you offer to her. There is a subtle but important distinction here. If your<br/>
daughter feels that she only has those choices that you offer to her, then<br/>
she will wait for you to give direction before she makes a choice. As in she<br/>
will wait for you to take the lead. <br/>
<br/>
Does your child have the freedom to chuck the piano lessons? <br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262500092">Nothing draws interested piano players like hearing someone else in the<br/>
house play.  I find my kids will play a lot more if I am enjoying myself<br/>
regularly at the piano.  My two daughters also take violin lessons (the<br/>
piano is completely informal).  They choose to practice because they want to<br/>
see what&#39;s next in the book and they figure their teacher will move to the<br/>
next thing quicker if they&#39;ve really played last week&#39;s stuff a lot.  They<br/>
don&#39;t practice every week but most weeks they do and I don&#39;t remind them.<br/>
It is true that if one plays, the other will usually play soon after.<br/>
Sometimes I try my my hand at playing something from their book and since<br/>
they get the lessons and I don&#39;t they will usually help me with what I&#39;m<br/>
doing wrong.  This is great for me (free lessons) and good for them -they<br/>
seem to  really learn a lot for themselves when they help me.  I hasten to<br/>
add that I don&#39;t make up fake ways for them to help me with violin.  They<br/>
only help me when they want to and when they hear me and figure I need help.<br/>
It&#39;s an honest back and forth not a way to manipulate them into practicing<br/>
more.<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a &quot;we mess up&quot; moment to say &quot;practicing music is  <br/>
required because the<br/>
music lessons cost money.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Donuts cost money.<br/>
If you buy a dozen donuts and everyone is satisfied at one or two, do  <br/>
you require them to finish the dozen because donuts cost money?<br/>
<br/>
Medicine costs money.<br/>
If you have some medicine you really don&#39;t like or that&#39;s giving you  <br/>
a bad reaction, will you finish the bottle because it cost money?<br/>
<br/>
First you need to decide on the purpose of the piano lessons.  The  <br/>
purpose might be fulfilled without an hour of practice a day.  The  <br/>
teacher wants to &quot;show progress.&quot;  The teacher wants parents to &quot;get  <br/>
their money&#39;s worth.&quot;  But maybe the student would rather binge and  <br/>
play for two hours one day and none for a while, or practice one week  <br/>
because it&#39;s raining outside and she&#39;s learning a new song she really  <br/>
likes, and not practice for three weeks afterwards because she&#39;s on a  <br/>
volleyball team and the sun is shining.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking of it as &quot;practicing,&quot; changing the term to  <br/>
&quot;playing&quot; might help too.  I play the piano.  I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
&quot;practice&quot; the piano.  I&#39;m playing it, for my own enjoyment, for my  <br/>
own purposes, when I feel like it.<br/>

When I first started learning to juggle, I didn&#39;t want to &quot;practice <br/>
juggling&quot; I just wanted to juggle. A friend of mine showed me a way <br/>
of learning that let me feel like I was juggling right from the <br/>
start, even though I was still dropping a lot of balls. I just got a <br/>
set of clubs, though, and find I&#39;m wanting to &quot;practice&quot; specific <br/>
skills. <br/>
<br/>
Someone - Holt, I think - noted that in adult life we learn things <br/>
by doing them. Its only kids who are expected to build a set of <br/>
skills *before* doing whatever those skills are &quot;for&quot;. Adults will <br/>
often choose to practice skills once they can see a reason for doing <br/>
so, but often &quot;practice&quot; those skills by means of choosing a project <br/>
that relies heavily on the skills in question.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost my train of thought, getting b&#39;fast for Morgan... I think <br/>
its good to note there&#39;s a difference between doing something and <br/>
practicing a skill-set. Its not necessarily the sort of difference <br/>
between &quot;learn&quot; and &quot;teach&quot; but it is good to see our kids playing <br/>
music or dancing or doing karate etc as being different from <br/>
practicing a set of skills for any of those. Not that practice is <br/>
unhelpful, per se - but that suggesting a kid practice something <br/>
doesn&#39;t necessarily support his or her interest in *doing* that <br/>
something. <br/>

<br/>
If I&#39;m playing a sonata (just the movements I like, probably) I&#39;m  <br/>
just playing.  If I try something new I&#39;ve never tried before, I  <br/>
might find something in there I like and I&#39;ll go through it the next  <br/>
few times I come to the piano, and I&#39;ll either like it more or less  <br/>
(just like anything--tv shows, restaurants, CDs, people) and if I  <br/>
decide it&#39;s worth having in my life longterm, those passages that  <br/>
aren&#39;t readable to me....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
OOOOH!   REMEMBER THIS TANGENT<br/>
<br/>
...those passages that aren&#39;t readable to me, I&#39;ll work through over  <br/>
and over (IF I&#39;m in the mood, because I have no deadline of a lesson  <br/>
or performance) until I &quot;know them&quot; in a way other than the way I&#39;m  <br/>
knowing the other parts that came easier.<br/>
<br/>
Up above, in full word-flow, I wrote &quot;aren&#39;t readable to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So this can tie in to my ever-ongoing thoughts about how reading  <br/>
works and what it means &quot;to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With apologies to those who will not know what I&#39;m writing about, you  <br/>
might just skip the next few paragraphs and go to this point ****<br/>
<br/>
I most like Baroque music.  In the music-reading area, it&#39;s very  <br/>
visual to me.  I don&#39;t count it out, I go by the patterns against  <br/>
patterns of the left and right hands.  Sometimes each hand is just  <br/>
playing one note, each hand a stream of notes going in different or  <br/>
parallel or some of each directions (contrapuntal/counterpoint).  I  <br/>
like that kind of vocal music too.  I like harmonies like that in  <br/>
folk and popular music too, though parallel thirds are more common.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of reading horizontally left to right, though, I&#39;m kinda  <br/>
reading vertically, by half measures or whole measures, and I see the  <br/>
relationship of the two parts, and I read them like whole phrases and  <br/>
relationships.   When one comes that I have to count out and that I  <br/>
can&#39;t hear by seeing, as it were, then I revert to the counting and  <br/>
thinking of note names that I was not using at all before.<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
When people read fluently they can look at a phrase like &quot;look at a  <br/>
phrase&quot; and see it whole, or at least see it as a kind of passage of  <br/>
music, or a section of a recipe, or like if you were reading  <br/>
directions for building, you would see 2x4 stud  and not think of  <br/>
each number or letter, but see a picture of a 2x4 in your mind and  <br/>
just have to look for the part that shows how long they want you to  <br/>
cut it.<br/>
<br/>
When anyone reads, no matter how good they are, they have a strategy  <br/>
for words they don&#39;t know, that don&#39;t just flow into their mind  <br/>
without analysis.  Some sound it out.  Some look it up.  Some make  <br/>
something up for it and skip it. Some just skip it.   But I think, at  <br/>
that moment, that the person was not &quot;reading&quot; but stopping, one way  <br/>
or another, to use another strategy.<br/>

him, rather than try to sound it out (although he *will* do this <br/>
sometimes), he&#39;s more likely to try to fit a word that works in the <br/>
context that may have the same starting letters as the stumper.  I <br/>
think that&#39;s very cool because he&#39;s fulfilling his purpose for <br/>
reading, which is gathering information (not reading for reading&#39;s <br/>
sake, as he most probably would be doing in a school setting).  I <br/>
gather from this guesswork that he&#39;s getting what he&#39;s reading.<br/>
<br/>
I love being a witness to this fascinating way of learning!<br/>

things.  When I did my art, even when I was young, I was working <br/>
towards a finished project.  I wasn&#39;t practicing my brush strokes or <br/>
shading techniques.  When there were assignments in art class that I <br/>
didn&#39;t feel like doing, I didn&#39;t do them, I would do something else.  <br/>
I didn&#39;t feel the need for practicing how to draw a still life of <br/>
fake fruit.  If I wanted to draw fake fruit, I would have just drawn <br/>
fake fruit.<br/>
<br/>
I think that it&#39;s true that you are either doing something or not <br/>
doing something.  Practicing isn&#39;t that helpful of a word.  The more <br/>
you do something, the better you get at it.  Practicing implies doing <br/>
something to achieve a certain level of proficiency with or without <br/>
the internal drive to be there.  I never practice art, I just do it.  <br/>
I did practice the violin a lot, and I never play it now, however I <br/>
did reach a certain level of proficiency at it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823780483">Max (17) has been playing guitar since he was 9. He told us one day he<br/>
wanted to learn to play guitar, so we checked out local music store/lessons,<br/>
bought a cheaper acoustic and signed him up.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I knew back then how fortunate we were to be living in a<br/>
laid-back, liberal college town (Athens, OH) with musicians who played music<br/>
for the love of it...on the sidewalks, in the little coffee shops, etc., and<br/>
how fortunate we were that Max&#39;s first teacher just asked Max what he wanted<br/>
to do and did it with him. It was the ultimate unschooling guitar learning<br/>
experience, and Max flew.<br/>
<br/>
Fast-forward to today...Max is a consummate guitarist in a jazz band and in<br/>
a funk/blues band. He has learned with numerous amazing guitar teachers,<br/>
including Jorma Kaukonen from Jefferson Airplane. According to Max, he<br/>
practices. He says, &quot;I&#39;m going in my room to practice&quot; and he will play one<br/>
part of one song over and over again till he feels good about it, and then<br/>
he&#39;ll move on to something else. His teachers have given him assignments<br/>
along the way, and if they made sense to him and were meaningful to him, he<br/>
usually did them. But no one here ever told him to :o) Usually he<br/>
&quot;practices&quot; particular things that he wants to get better at. And maybe his<br/>
terminology of &quot;practice&quot; could just as easily be called &quot;playing&quot;. His goal<br/>
is usually to play really well for whatever gig is next.<br/>
<br/>
He always seems very content when playing guitar, whether he was playing for<br/>
the love of playing, or working on something in particular.<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s as good as he is today because:<br/>
*he loves playing and no one has squelched that...and he played and played<br/>
and played and continues to do so<br/>
*he hasn&#39;t been pushed into anything with guitar, including having to<br/>
&quot;practice&quot;<br/>
*he&#39;s lead his own course with this passion<br/>
*he&#39;s received lots of support<br/>
<br/>
Max&#39;s guitar-playing has been such a beautiful and natural journey, and a<br/>
great example of where a child can go with freedom and support.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-487762182">I loved playing soccer when I was a boy and would often play &#39;park <br/>
football&#39; with friends for hours on end (that&#39;s where the goalposts <br/>
are piles of coats or sweaters).<br/>
<br/>
My best position turned out to be goalkeeper. When I was 14, I joined <br/>
a proper soccer club. At the weekly practices, virtually all we did <br/>
was drill, either fitness drill or practising one specific tactic <br/>
over and over again. Sometimes we hardly ever touched a soccer ball <br/>
until our ten minute six a side game that usually closed the two hour <br/>
training session. I hated all that. I just wanted to play soccer.<br/>
<br/>
Yet I would often spend long sessions alone in my back garden at home <br/>
kicking a ball against the wall of the house, leaping all over the <br/>
place as it came back to me at all sorts of unpredictable angles, so <br/>
that I would keep my goalkeeping reflexes sharp.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s as the saying goes: the only true motivation is self-<br/>
motivation and everything else is coercion.<br/>
<br/>
btw, I was a fiddle player for many years back in my days as <br/>
a &#39;folkie&#39; and how that started was I was 21 and working with a guy <br/>
who was seriously into folk music, dance and song. One day he invited <br/>
me to come along with him to the local folk club. At that time, I <br/>
thought &#39;folk&#39; meant Bob Dylan and Joan Baez and stuff like that, <br/>
and, being more into T Rex and Led Zeppelin and stuff like that, I <br/>
declined. So the guy bribed me by offering to pay for all my beer - <br/>
who could refuse that? - and I reluctantly went along with him to <br/>
this quaint olde worlde pub tucked away down some English country <br/>
lane (the Black Horse, Nuthurst, Sussex, for any English people on <br/>
this list). So my friend and I walked in through the front door of <br/>
this pub into a bar that was absolutely jam packed except for a small <br/>
clear area in one corner where two fiddle players stood ramping out <br/>
Irish reels. And I&#39;m looking at these two guys nonchalantly sawing <br/>
away and I&#39;m listening to this alien music and I&#39;m immediately <br/>
thinking &quot;I wanna do that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A week later I&#39;d bought a violin and learned a couple of tunes and <br/>
that was the start of an &#39;amazing adventure&#39; that lasted 15 years <br/>
until it took second place to my role as my daughter&#39;s stay-at-home <br/>
dad (I finally quit playing when she was five and haven&#39;t touched a <br/>
fiddle since). Included in the adventure, I got interested in the <br/>
fiddle music of the Shetland Islands (a group of islands off the <br/>
north coast of Scotland) and I went up there on a working holiday to <br/>
play in the pubs with the locals. And while I was there I met the 19 <br/>
year old girl from Belfast I&#39;ve now been married to for 33 years and <br/>
who&#39;s the mother of both of my children.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s ramble. :)<br/>

But maybe get one of the Chinese-made-ones that are cheap and then  <br/>
you can let your kids play with it too, and take it camping, and not  <br/>

The conversation it led to was it being our son&#39;s great, great grandfather&#39;s - and the linage that entailed.  Our son thought great great grandfather meant always following the father&#39;s linage so we discussed and outlined how it could go in many directions.  He thought it meant it was his dad&#39;s dad&#39;s dad&#39;s dad - but it is his dad&#39;s, mom&#39;s, mom&#39;s, dad&#39;s violin.<br/>

The item our son loves to pick around on is a lap harp - the cheap ones that you slide the music under the strings to pick out the tune. He also enjoys his tin whistle.   The guitar and violin pretty much gather dust.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391214866">I&#39;d love to play the tin whistle. It&#39;s got such a wonderful clear <br/>
sound - and you can stick it in your pocket. Very handy.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after I took up the fiddle, I went through a phase of <br/>
interest in different instruments that other folk music enthusiasts <br/>
were playing. I got on alright with the mandolin (which is tuned the <br/>
same as a violin), but never played it much; and I did pretty well <br/>
with the melodeon, which I played off and on for morris dancing for <br/>
many years; but I couldn&#39;t figure out that tin whistle. Just couldn&#39;t <br/>
synchronise my lungs and my fingers! Perhaps it didn&#39;t help being a <br/>
heavy smoker in those days.<br/>
<br/>
I learned one tune that I would sometimes wheel out as a party piece. <br/>
It&#39;s called Bold Benjamin. Sandra probably knows it. It&#39;s very slow <br/>
(plenty of time for me to think where to put my fingers next). My <br/>
wife has it on a Sinead O&#39;Connor CD and whenever she plays it, which <br/>
is once in a while, she *always* remarks that Bold Benjamin is the <br/>
saddest tune in the world. I think it&#39;s She Moved Through The Fair, <br/>
which Sinead O&#39;Connor sang in the movie Michael Collins when the <br/>
messenger came to tell his one true love of his death. I was blubbing <br/>
like a baby.<br/>
<br/>
What kind of music does your son like to play? Is he self-taught on <br/>
the tin whistle or did he have lessons?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-202385951">Self taught - same as the lap harp.  <br/>
<br/>
He just plays it - plays around with it same as the guitar or violin - probably not music to anyone&#39;s ears except his own - LOL  Though with the lap harp he does follow the sheet music and play songs others have written.<br/>
<br/>
Our son loves to listen to a very wide variety of music - he loves the old hard rock - his favorite radio station is old hard rock from the 60&#39;s to the 80&#39;s;  I just bought an ELO (Electric Light Orchestra) CD and he loves it;  some  country (he is into Johnny Cash right now for country);  he loves the Anamie tracks from the TV shows and Movies; He also loves to get movie sound tracks to movies he really likes - such as  Star Wars and Pirates of the Caribbean;  He loves Scottish music (especially the pipes and fast paced dance/reel music) and African music. There is also an Irish band here in the USA called The Elders that we love it&#39;s more like Irish Rock and one of the dad&#39;s is in our homeschool group so we know them (him).   He says he also likes music where they take classical music and make it with a more rock twist (his description).<br/>
<br/>
What I need to do is have a conversation with him and let him know if he ever did want to take lessons we&#39;d be open to that - we&#39;ve had the conversation in the past but I know of a violin player that is great for open ended mentoring / lessons that I could explore the option of just playing and mentoring without the drill and hours of practice.<br/>
<br/>
He likes to play basketball and volleyball - they had a homeschool group doing both but he went a few times and then asked to drop out because he did not like the drill, he just wanted to play and have fun - not be an expert.   Then there was another group that did basketball and play is all they did and he loved it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653703910">I never thought of that - That&#39;s why these groups are great for me (and thus my child) !  Actually I think a standard sheet 8.5x11 will work - thanks for the idea!  it is one of those lap harps that is very simple - a triangle of wood with strings, and you can buy pre-made music sheets that are triangle shaped that slide under the strings and show where to strum/pick. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think he would love this idea - in his own time of course.  Maybe I&#39;ll write some for myself and then he&#39;ll be inspired - though musically inclined I&#39;m not really (did the whole forced practice/lesson thing with organ and clarinet for 12 long years and the whole time I was being forced to sit there all I could think about was running through the back pastures free with nature and the many animals I collected - which is probably why I was not a &quot;good&quot; musician. ;)  At least I knew enough to explain the types of notes to him - in other words how fast to play the notes or how long to stretch them out.<br/>

It needs to be just the size of the other ones the harp uses, and  <br/>
it&#39;s wider than 11&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If the paper doesn&#39;t fit up in there tightly, it won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
What I did was play the song to make sure it would fit on the harp  <br/>
(not too wide a range, not needing notes that weren&#39;t there).  When  <br/>
you find a good place for it, then get a pencil and just put dots.   <br/>
Plan to make it fit in the width you have.  Then you can pull it out  <br/>
and finish the notation on a flat surface, putting it back in and  <br/>
testing it once in a while to make sure you&#39;re getting it the way you  <br/>
want to.<br/>
