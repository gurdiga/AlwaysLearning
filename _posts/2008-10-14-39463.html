<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989742585">I&#39;m asking this here because I&#39;m thinking some of the members on this list have girls who like princess-y types of things.  And in supporting that, you might be able to suggest some fun games.<br/>
<br/>
My niece likes girly, princess-y types of things.  So, with Christmas coming up I thought she might enjoy some PC or Nintendo DS games that feature princesses or fashion or something like that.  <br/>
<br/>
My neice is six and has used Jumpstart and has some kind of fluffy kitten PC game.  She has Nintendogs and is happy to just pet/wash/walk the dog.  She also has a Webkinz and an account at Bellasera - but she doesn&#39;t really play them.<br/>
<br/>
I am looking for a game that is easy to play, doesn&#39;t require reading, and has lots of &quot;point and click&quot; types of features.  If she doesn&#39;t get something right the first time she is likely to completely shut down, so an open ended game without right/wrong choices would be best.<br/>
<br/>
She lives with us on the weekends and will only be playing the games when she is here.  Maybe something pretty to look at with lots of sparkles.  Maybe something with a dress up doll or taking care of babies.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many games out there and I really want to pick one she&#39;ll love.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-201698105">Jayn has been enjoying Barbie games for a while. I don&#39;t recommend 12 <br/>
Dancing Princesses for someone easily frustrated, but we have some others <br/>
that are great fun, that focus on dress up and coloring pictures and <br/>
stickers. My favorite is Rapunzel. Also the Disney Princess games are heavy <br/>
on the dress up stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Super Princess Peach is one that Jayn likes on her Nintendo DS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726662511">This isn&#39;t a gift suggestion, because it&#39;s free online, but my daughter and her friend love a <br/>
site called girlgogames.  There is a whole Barbie dress-up game that they can play for <br/>
long periods of time--lots of sparkle.<br/>

<br/>
Our experience so far has been that Nintendogs seems to be the best of the bunch for pet <br/>
games.  She&#39;s tried a few pony DS games and a dog dress-up game from another maker, <br/>
and none of them are as good.  (But those are all at least a year old--I don&#39;t know if there <br/>
are any good new ones.)  She also likes Cooking Mama.<br/>
