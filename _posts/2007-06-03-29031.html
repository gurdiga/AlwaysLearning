Phrases like &quot;feel like a maid&quot; can get in the way of seeing clearly  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602640727">***How do you handle it? ***<br/>
<br/>
I have been in this situation.  Children come over to our house a lot, <br/>
as my children prefer playdates here.  I think it gets easier as the <br/>
children get older, as I can&#39;t imagine any of my dd&#39;s 10 year old and <br/>
up friends being asked if they &quot;cleaned up&quot;, but sometimes I think they <br/>
are asked if they watched tv all day or played video games.  At least <br/>
that happens in the car on the way home :)<br/>
<br/>
For us, I haven&#39;t hit upon that perfect solution.  Sometimes I meet the <br/>
moms outside, with an &quot;Oh, yeah, they picked up what they played with!  <br/>
See you later!&quot;  Or I straighten up myself.  But, I have plenty to do <br/>
to love and care for and raise my own children.  If another mom is in <br/>
my home treating her children a certain way I don&#39;t agree with (but is <br/>
not harmful), that is part of having guests.<br/>
<br/>
It is kind of like having a dinner guest over.  If she drinks way too <br/>
much everytime, I would mention something to her about her lifestyle in <br/>
private, alone.  I would, because our family is uncomfortable around a <br/>
lot of drinking, probably stop inviting her.<br/>
<br/>
If she just has a couple of glasses of wine to my one, doesn&#39;t drive <br/>
home, etc, I would probably not really encourage the relationship <br/>
because of my families needs and desires about drinking, but I would <br/>
not try to encourage a change in the person.<br/>

<br/>
We mostly play in others&#39; homes but I&#39;ve run into similar <br/>
situations. I work on creating open dialog with the other family <br/>
about rules and expectations and coming to a mutually acceptible <br/>
agreement regarding clean-up. <br/>
<br/>
The hardest situation I&#39;ve been in is with a long-time girlfriend <br/>
who was very insistent at one point that *I* shouldn&#39;t help the kids <br/>
clean up. At that point we switched to only getting together for <br/>
outside play for several weeks. During that time I talked with <br/>
Morgan off and on about my friend and her issues around cleaning - <br/>
Mo&#39;s not a tremendous talker, so we had to do this in itty bitty <br/>
bits, but over time she and I came up with some options for playing <br/>
in ways and rooms that didn&#39;t involve a lot of &quot;mess&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
At the same time my gf and I would toss suggestions and ideas and <br/>
theories back and forth to one another every time we got together - <br/>
at first we would even say things like &quot;this is just brainstorming, <br/>
I&#39;m not attatched to the idea, what are your thoughts?&quot; That let us <br/>
express our concerns to one another in a non-confrontational way, <br/>
and eventually find some solutions that work for both our families. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   Say my house my rules and in this house we dont worry about <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The way I found to phrase this was &quot;We do things Really Differently <br/>
in our family&quot;. I have also found it helps, when talking about <br/>
asking others to clean at my house, to state that clean-up-time is <br/>
really stressful for *me* - moreso than having to clean up the mess <br/>
later on my own. That re-frames the issue in terms of courtesy and <br/>
helpfulness, rather than &quot;teaching the kids a lesson&quot;. <br/>

  Its hard work to sweep and mop a floor , its hard work to build a play scene, its hard work to entertain 4 little boys ...she gave a tour, she suggested activities, she got everyone snacks , and tried to make sure everyone was having a good time.

<br/>
My young adults were not taught to clean, the value of hard work, or respect<br/>
for their things and the house overall, but they each learned all of these<br/>
things internally as they lived life in a respectful, supportive, flowing<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
If I had a bunch of kids over and I knew our time together was about to end,<br/>
and the mess was big, I might start to pick things up and might ask for help<br/>
here and there. The response or lack of response from the kids wouldn&#39;t<br/>
matter. More often than not though, kids help.<br/>
<br/>
That is different than saying, &quot;It is now clean-up time. Everyone pitch in!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Today at home if I ask for help, my kids almost always do. Lots of times I<br/>
don&#39;t even say anything and the groceries are carried in, or the dishwasher<br/>
is being filled, or the floor is swept. These acts of helping and<br/>
responsibility (and hard work and respect for their things and the house<br/>
overall) came without my forcing it or teaching it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173417774">-=-(b) Say my house my rules and in this house we don&#39;t worry about<br/>
trivial things like making kids clean.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A suggestion from another list (Robyn Coburn wrote):<br/>
-=-The other reason I often don&#39;t want help  cleaning up is that Jayn  <br/>
and I are going to be continuing the game. Maybe something like &quot;I  <br/>
don&#39;t know whether my kids are quite finished with the stuff yet&quot;  <br/>
would be useful.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes other families do expect and require that kids clean up and  <br/>
when I picked my kids up from such places, I helped with the  <br/>
cleaning, while hearing stories of how much fun it had been, instead  <br/>
of standing with the mom supervising the labor.<br/>
<br/>
When other moms did the little sing-songy voice &quot;Did you clean up  <br/>
your mess?&quot; or whatever condescending, shaming thing they might have  <br/>
had to say to their kids, in front of me and my kids, implying or  <br/>
stating that what kids do is &quot;a mess,&quot; I would try to aim for saying  <br/>
something that would soothe the kid and stop the mom, and then I  <br/>
would smile.  I&#39;d say something like &quot;They played outside a lot, and  <br/>
there isn&#39;t anything to clean up,&quot; or &quot;We&#39;ll get that stuff later.&quot;    <br/>
And smile.<br/>
<br/>
But if anyone presses me to &quot;discipline&quot; their kids at my house, or  <br/>
make them eat something or to make them do anything, I just defend  <br/>
the kid and my house.   It&#39;s sanctuary.  Their options are to stop  <br/>
coming over or to let me have my way at my house.  To let their kids  <br/>
have my way at my house, or to stop bringing them over.<br/>
<br/>
And my kids either go with the rules and structures at other houses,  <br/>
and if it&#39;s too much for them they quit going over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358272365">*Today at home if I ask for help, my kids almost always do. Lots of <br/>
times I<br/>
don&#39;t even say anything and the groceries are carried in, or the <br/>
dishwasher<br/>
is being filled, or the floor is swept. These acts of helping and<br/>
responsibility (and hard work and respect for their things and the <br/>
house<br/>
overall) came without my forcing it or teaching it.*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is so cool. I never &quot;make&quot; my children clean up. They do it b/c <br/>
they choose to and when they see me doing something most of they time <br/>
will join in too. They are very helpful.</div>

I did the whole &quot;value of hard work&quot; thing when my stepson was little. <br/>
It created an ugly, antagonistic relationship that we&#39;re still working <br/>
on healing. I wish I&#39;d &quot;missed&quot; that. I&#39;m happy to be missing it with <br/>
my dd. <br/>
