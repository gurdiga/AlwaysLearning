<div id="ygrps-yiv-58343384">Hi all,<br/>
Well, we&#39;re learning all about how to degrease an engine and undercarriage <br/>
on a new-to-us &#39;97 F250 4x4 diesel truck named Betsy.  Problem is, the only <br/>
ways we can figure to degrease her (using biodegradable degreasers), <br/>
removes the paint from the undercarriage too, leaving the metal unprotected <br/>
(and nevermind my arm is tired from scrubbing!)  Has anyone out there <br/>
successfully degreased an engine/undercarriage without stripping the paint <br/>
as well?  Any helpful hints?<br/>
<br/>
(We need to clear out the dreck as we&#39;ll soon be switching to using <br/>
home-made biodiesel soon and we want to be able to tell by sight if it&#39;s <br/>
dissolving any of the tubing/etc.  Otherwise, we&#39;d leave the dreck alone!)<br/>
