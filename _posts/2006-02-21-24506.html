This page is beautiful.<br/>
It was in the sigline of an e-mail from Carelia@gmail, and I like it  <br/>
when I have time look at what people have in their siglines.<br/>
<br/>
This one&#39;s worth asking other people to look at too!  Partly it&#39;s  <br/>
beautiful.  Partly it&#39;s got good links I hadn&#39;t seen before, and some  <br/>
great quotes like this one:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.&quot; ~  <br/>
Frederick Douglas<br/>

--------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Are there other personal sites some of you want to put out here for  <br/>
people to see?  Any secret obscure ones, or flashy big new ones  <br/>
people should know about?<br/>
<br/>
There is an unschooling blog ring, where you can click to go to  <br/>
&quot;next&quot; or &quot;random,&quot; of blogs people have voluntarily linked, but  <br/>
other sites are &quot;regular&quot; webpages and not blogs.  You can get there  <br/>
from the side of one of my pages (which I should use more, but my  <br/>
writing energy gets used up here and at UnschoolingDiscussion  <br/>
usually)  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I have a few linked to the righthand side here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/blog">http://sandradodd.com/blog</a><br/>
(which is my new-to-the-site announcements page).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad people are making their own sites.  These must be some of  <br/>
the greatest things to show relatives who wonder if you really know  <br/>
what you&#39;re doing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062933195">Thanks, Janet, for letting me know the toddler link didn&#39;t work at  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/blog">http://sandradodd.com/blog</a><br/>
<br/>
None of the links in the most recent post worked.  I learned  <br/>
something this morning.  It&#39;s too early for me to have felt good  <br/>
about learning this morning. &lt;g&gt;  I need more tea, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
The quotation marks were curly.  I cut and pasted that from an e- <br/>
mail, and the quotes not only went curly, but were all right-hand  <br/>
quotes, so the links withered up.<br/>
<br/>
I think they&#39;re all working now, though.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who ever finds a bad link on any of my pages, pleaseâ€”let me know.<br/>
<br/>
And Joyce has shown me how to make the photos load better and I&#39;ll  <br/>
work on that for future pages but I don&#39;t promise I&#39;ll go back and  <br/>
fix all existing pages right away because it overwhelms me.<br/>
<br/>
I do like to learn, I just prefer it not to be a head-aching mystery  <br/>
at 7:00 in the morning.  (I got up to help Marty get off to work, as  <br/>
Keith is still on vacation and didn&#39;t need to be naturally up so early.)<br/>

<br/>
If anyone finds dead links, can you let me know? LOL And btw the  <br/>
&quot;family&quot; link goes to my family&#39;s main page and the kids have pages  <br/>
linked from there (tho they are heavy on graphics and low on actual  <br/>
content), and my husband has his blog, which at one time contained  <br/>
quite a few unschooly posts (things the kids did or his random  <br/>
observations). He edits it frequently (he&#39;s a geek boy engineer so he  <br/>
loves tweaking the code and such) so I am not sure if it&#39;s working  <br/>
right now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s why we started making the pages. We lived in CO for 7 years  <br/>
and the grandparents were in MO and CA. Then it became a hobby to do  <br/>
it, regardless if anyone else looked at it! I don&#39;t do scrapbbooking  <br/>
so this is my &quot;scrapbook&quot;. I love the dynamic nature of the pages,  <br/>
and when I get bored with a layout, I can easily change it!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the &quot;plug&quot;, Sandra! :)<br/>
