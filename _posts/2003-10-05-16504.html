<div id="ygrps-yiv-1847496508">Lexie wrote a book report tonight.  She was funny, she said &quot;mommy bring <br/>
up word so I can write a book report for Ms. May.&quot;  Ms. May is the <br/>
reading specialist where I teach, and a month or so ago she told Lexie <br/>
that Lexie could borrow any book in school as long as she occassionally <br/>
wrote a book report about a book she had borrowed.  When this <br/>
conversation took place, I just smiled and didn&#39;t say a word.  Later I <br/>
told Lexie she could borrow any book she wanted, she didn&#39;t have to <br/>
write a book report unless she wanted to do so.  So tonight when she <br/>
announced that she wanted to write a book report, I reminded her that <br/>
Ms. May didn&#39;t have any right to ask for a book report from her, and <br/>
that she didn&#39;t have to do one.  She said, &quot;I know, but I want others to <br/>
read this book, and I really liked this book and want to write about <br/>
it.&quot;  OK.... But then she was concerned because the book she wanted to <br/>
write about was not one she had borrowed from the school  &quot;Will Ms. May <br/>
know I didn&#39;t borrow this one?&quot;  I assured her that there were plenty of <br/>
Nancy Drew books in the library and also that if she wanted to write a <br/>
book report, she should write it on whatever book she wanted!  I also <br/>
said something like &quot;doesn&#39;t writing a book report for some teacher at a <br/>
middle school where you don&#39;t even attend defeat the purpose of <br/>
unschooling?&quot;  Lexie just chuckled and told me to type (she doesn&#39;t <br/>
write, if you remember, I type everything for her  She does however lean <br/>
over my shoulder and correct all gramatical and typing errors. She even <br/>
helped me spell attak, attat--she says &quot;mom, try attic.&quot;  lol).<br/>
<br/>
So here it is<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Book Report<br/>
<br/>
Nancy Drew<br/>
<br/>
Mystery of Twin  Elms Mansion<br/>
<br/>
By Lexie Fowler<br/>
<br/>
10/4/03<br/>
<br/>
This is a mystery book.  Mysteries are books where there is a crime to<br/>
solve and it is always solved near the end of the book.  The main<br/>
characters in this book are Nancy Drew, Nancy&#39;s father (Mr. Drew),<br/>
Nancy&#39;s housekeeper (Ellen) and Nancy&#39;s friend.  The friend&#39;s family are<br/>
also in the book.<br/>
<br/>
The plot is that there is supposed to be a haunting in the mansion and<br/>
Nancy is called to solve it.  All these strange events happen.  One of<br/>
them, not to ruin the mystery, is there is a big scary face outside the<br/>
window that only Nancy&#39;s friend sees.  That is pretty much the plot.<br/>
<br/>
The setting is Twin Elms Mansion and the mansion next door, which is an<br/>
exact replica.  Nancy&#39;s mansion and the servant&#39;s cottages for all but<br/>
Nancy&#39;s mansion are thought to be where a tunnel is.  I know this took<br/>
place in the past because the girls wore dresses all the time and the<br/>
president was different.<br/>
<br/>
The chapter before Nancy&#39;s victory and Nancy&#39;s Victory is where the<br/>
climax is.  Her friend is going through the tunnel, which is a listening<br/>
post, where someone would listen to the servants&#39; conversations, and the<br/>
criminal can use this tunnel to spy on the house, because it goes under<br/>
three rooms, ending under the kitchen.  And then Nancy finds a passage<br/>
out on top, on the attic, and then she finds that there is a passage as<br/>
well leading from the mansion next door to the other mansion.  But her<br/>
father was kidnapped and they find her father and the mystery is solved!<br/>
<br/>
I LOVED this book, I couldn&#39;t put it down!  I would recommend it to<br/>
anyone who likes books with suspense!!  If you want a good book or just<br/>
to pass time, you should pick up the Nancy Drew Mystery Books!</div>

I&#39;m reading, you know the black one.&quot; ;-) But I certainly poured over the<br/>
list of 50-some-at-the-time Nancy Drew titles often enough as a kid to<br/>
realize I recognized the plot but not the title.)<br/>

<br/>
Thanks, Sandra<br/>
<br/>
She most definately has great reading skills.  I often try to figure out <br/>
how I helped her to develop the reading stragegies she has, so I can <br/>
help my students at school, who are not readers, to develop them as well. <br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago I was trying to think of that william carlos williams <br/>
poem about the wheelbarrow. I  said that aloud as I&#39;m flipping through <br/>
my anthology looking for the right poem.  She says, aloud, oh you want <br/>
this one?  And recites it word for word.  She had read it in a book, <br/>
Love that Dog, a few months before and had loved that poem.  So she <br/>
memorized it.  I had no idea she had it memorized.  I needed to make <br/>
sure I had an exact copy of the poem so I did look it up and she had it <br/>
100-% right.<br/>
<br/>
OK brag over.<br/>
<br/>
I just love the fact she loves to read and drops her books in the tub <br/>
and recites poetry.  Cause that&#39;s exactly what I do.<br/>
<br/>

but the book is in &quot;daddy&#39;s car&quot; and she didn&#39;t want to wait to check <br/>
facts.  ;-) She wantedto write her report before going to bed. <br/>
<br/>
btw the book she read is a 1st edition my mom found, dated 1932 or <br/>
something close to that.  She found like five of these first <br/>
editions--wonder how much they&#39;d bring on ebay?<br/>
<br/>
I did ask her not to read that one in the tub but I still found it in <br/>
the bathroom.  I can&#39;t assume she was in the tub, though.  She reads on <br/>
the toilet too. <br/>

title at the top and the author&#39;s name at the bottom in orange letters?<br/>
The former might get you maybe $5-$10, the latter maybe close to $100,<br/>
depending on what printing, condition, and whether you have the jacket.<br/>
The true first edition is the latter. It would also have 3 or 4 full page<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I went through the marine biologist phase, too, thanks to Jacque Cousteau<br/>
shows.  I cured myself with a high school P.E. class in scuba -- I sank like<br/>
a rock with a tank on my back.  Plus, the harsh reality of the effects of<br/>
depth on a person with a heart condition was unavoidable; I can&#39;t take high<br/>
altitude, either, which doomed my olympic downhill racer career &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Alex is already an accomplished cartoonist; I credit heredity there as well,<br/>
since he has visual artists on both sides of the family.  I&#39;m rather glad<br/>
he&#39;s interested in riding, since that makes my &quot;I wanna horse!&quot; whine more<br/>
altruistic; the *family* needs a horse, hubby, not just me ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Why is it that parents don&#39;t want their kids to pursue the same career?  My<br/>
mom was very artistic in school, and won a scholarship to a prestigious art<br/>
school in L.A.  (For stupidly dysfunctional family reasons, she wasn&#39;t<br/>
permitted to accept.)  Mom *hated* my sister&#39;s passion for both painting and<br/>
ballet, and was furious when I changed majors from advertising to graphic<br/>
design.  Maybe that Albert Brooks movie, &quot;Mother,&quot; holds the answer -- the<br/>
frustration of a failed or aborted career makes a parent so jealous they<br/>
can&#39;t support their child in the same career?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if parents who are doctors have the same issues, but for me<br/>
it&#39;s just about how hard a life it is, so full of disappointment. I also<br/>
know that anyone who is destined to be an actor will be one no matter what,<br/>
so what will be, will be.<br/>

**Hi Joylyn - You can check out this page to see how much your books might<br/>
be worth: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://collectbooks.about.com/library/weekly/aa040401b.htm">http://collectbooks.about.com/library/weekly/aa040401b.htm</a> .    I<br/>
have a collection from my mom, too.<br/>
<br/>
Please tell Lexie that she&#39;s inspired me to reread The Hidden Staircase.<br/>
That was always my favorite :0). ~Rue<br/>
