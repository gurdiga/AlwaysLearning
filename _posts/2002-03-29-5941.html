&lt;&lt;  They&#39;re going to be the most decorated kids in the council!  I have Pam <br/>
S to thank for showing me how do that with educationese.  ;)  A skill <br/>
that easily transfers to other venues. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have links at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingotherwise">http://sandradodd.com/unschoolingotherwise</a> to some sites for scouts and camp <br/>
fire (I THINK, maybe 4-H) for which some other folks have pre-educationalized <br/>
it.<br/>

Holly did scouts for a while.  Eeek.  Not education.  They wanted her to do a <br/>
report on girl scouts in China.  They told her the Chinese flag was blue and <br/>
yellow.  I told her it was RED for sure.  She said no, the leader said...<br/>
<br/>
And I said there were probably NOT any girl scouts in China.<br/>
Her leaders had not thought of that.<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
I know, volunteers... real world... school, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
There are some Girl Guides being phased out in Hong Kong, so she told them <br/>
about that.<br/>
