<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017702130">Sandra, you might remember this.<br/>
<br/>
THere is a place in New Mexico called Bandalier national monument.  It <br/>
is a wonderful Anasazi site with excellent ruins. Anyway, the family who <br/>
set up the visitor center did so before National Parks so it is quite <br/>
interesting.  One thing they used to have is a bunch of hummingbird <br/>
feeders, and I used to help the woman (can&#39;t think of her name right <br/>
now) fill them.  They used to also feed the squirrels and such.  They <br/>
don&#39;t do that anymore, cause they don&#39;t want to mess with the wild life, <br/>
but it was much fun to have these 10-15 feeders in this little <br/>
courtyard, the hummingbirds were quite used to the people and would flit <br/>
right in front of you.<br/>
<br/>
My parents feed the hummingbirds down the road (by about 30 miles, or <br/>
less as the hummingbird flies) at their house.  One day before they had <br/>
built their house and were only going up there on weekends, my parents <br/>
arrived to find a few hummingbirds waiting.  The feeder was empty.  The <br/>
birds were MAD.  One of them flew right into my mother&#39;s face and <br/>
hovered there for a bit and then flew to the empty feeder and then to my <br/>
mother&#39;s face.  She was not even allowed to empty the car first, she <br/>
knew that she had to fill that feeder immediately.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Last week my girls got to get up close and personal with a hummingbird,<br/>
&gt; which is very rare, but has happened twice to me.  They were out playing<br/>
&gt; in the back lawn and there was a hummingbird just sitting in the grass<br/>
&gt; and it didn&#39;t fly away.  They got to get right up to it and see all it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; colors.  This happened to me a few years ago on the steps going up our<br/>
&gt; back porch.  Each time, when I went to nudge the bird, it just flew<br/>
&gt; away.  I&#39;m pretty sure they were young and paralyzed with fear until my<br/>
&gt; hand coming at them startled them into motion.  But they really are<br/>
&gt; amazing creatures!  I love sitting in my screened porch just off my<br/>
&gt; kitchen, sipping coffee and watching the hummingbirds sipping off the<br/>
&gt; trumpet vine flowers that cover the side screen.  It&#39;s just awesome.<br/>
&gt; Happy spring...and summer!  HeidiC.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Thought I&#39;d contribute to springtime happenings...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Tim, my dh, and I were enjoying a cup of coffee this morning.   We <br/>
&gt; are sitting just off our kitchen, next to our screen porch.  (Couldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; go out in the porch this a.m., too cool)   Anyway,,, I take a sip of <br/>
&gt; coffee and lookup,  here, a hummingbird has flown right into the <br/>
&gt; screen.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Ya see, last summer we hadn&#39;t finished the screen and they would fly <br/>
&gt; right through.  We kept saying, &quot;oohh,  that porch is going to be a <br/>
&gt; rude awakening for the hummingbirds!&quot;  <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;He was stuck for maybe 20 seconds and visions of Flit (I think that <br/>
&gt; was his name of the hummingbird in the movie Pocahontas) stuck in the <br/>
&gt; canoe, came to mind.     It was pretty funny,  he&#39;s fine, went and <br/>
&gt; drank from the feeder.   <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I know my tune would probably be different if he would have gotten <br/>
&gt; hurt,  but he was so darn cute flying there,  then backing out. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;I love watching those little birds!<br/>

people without regard or fear, and it&#39;s fun to be able to stand there and look at <br/>
them close-up, but when they get hostile at the other hummingbirds they might <br/>
back into people or buzz them too.<br/>

<br/>
I remember going to the Desert Museum outside of Tucson with Dave&#39;s dad,<br/>
and we went into the bird enclosure and the hummingbirds were really<br/>
attracted to the red plastic balls on his ponytail holders... he had a<br/>
bunch of them in his hair, it was that ponytail with a holder every<br/>
couple of inches thing, good for riding a bike because your hair doesn&#39;t<br/>
tangle, so he took out a few and held them in his hands and the hummers<br/>
came right to him...<br/>

It is handy to have other locals and ex-locals around. My boyfriend (who<br/>
was actually born and raised in Albuquerque) lived in Tucson for a few<br/>
years (he actually did a project with my dad) and we can talk about<br/>
places in and around Tucson that no one else has ever heard of....<br/>
