<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835859385">Someone asked here a while back about local groups (pretty sure it was here) and I got a <br/>
couple of side e-mails, one of which I think I lost.   <br/>
<br/>
Could those of you who have a minute to spare please look at my local listings page and see <br/>
if it works for your area, if I&#39;ve left something out, if a link&#39;s broken, etc.?  I want to list <br/>
groups that are really by and for unschoolers, not just any old playgroup.  People can find <br/>
those by other means.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an e-mail link at the bottom of that page if you want to send me a note, so this list <br/>
doesn&#39;t fill up with local discussion.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, anyone with the time and interest to help me edit that up nicely!<br/>
<br/>
