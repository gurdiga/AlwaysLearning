I am on that list and I caught that too, and I almost brought it up but I didnt want to &#39;piss&#39; off the entire list (albeit I might anyway; it&#39;s pretty obvious the list is a bit younger than my daughter..)<br/>

  &gt; -No Joanna, it was my doing. Inadvertantly.<br/>
  &gt; I&#39;m glad there are a few other voices so I&#39;m not alone. I questioned <br/>
  &gt; a person that said something about if her child &quot;got behind&quot; she <br/>
  &gt; would do something about it.<br/>
  &gt; Sheesh. <br/>
  &gt; When I called that view into question, against the views of <br/>
  &gt; unschooling, it started the whole mud slinging battle again.<br/>
  &gt; What an idiot I am to think that someone over there could be <br/>
  &gt; questioned and actually give some thoughtful answers without feeling <br/>
  &gt; attacked.<br/>
  &gt; I can&#39;t believe the fallout from my post.<br/>
  &gt; I should know better. But like you I can not stomache the thought <br/>
  &gt; of &quot;do whatever works for your family&quot;<br/>
  &gt; Why even have Unschooling as a concept if we&#39;re just goint to tell <br/>
  &gt; everyone that line of BS.<br/>
  &gt; It&#39;s not right that they&#39;ve ousted the clearest voice on the planet <br/>
  &gt; about unschooling (Yes, Sandra)<br/>
  &gt; and the voices that have taken over are giving lousy advice to people.<br/>
  &gt; Ren<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Would any of you hardcore unschoolers who live in WA<br/>
  want to join the WAUNSCHOOLERS list and tell me if<br/>
  they are *really* unschoolers?  They are talking about <br/>
  curriculum books and asking the kids to do a page or <br/>
  two in a book every day and trying to figure out ways <br/>
  to teach math,,,,&quot;so the kids don&#39;t fall behind&quot;, etc,,, <br/>
<br/>
  I joined that list since I live in WA and wanted to learn all<br/>
  I can about unschooling,,,,but the list seems more of a <br/>
  place to plan and do field trips with other homeschoolers <br/>
  than a place to learn about unschooling.  They have set <br/>
  times to go to the children&#39;s museum, set times to go to<br/>
  a thing in Renton called FLIGHT (FLIGHT means Families <br/>
  Learning In God&#39;s Honor Together. It is a very large <br/>
  homeschooling co-op comprising some 180+ families <br/>
  representing more than 30 churches/faiths etc.  They <br/>
  go there, separate the kids by age and then send them <br/>
  off to classrooms to do age appropriate activities),,,etc <br/>
  It all seems very scheduled and not very *unschool* like<br/>
  to me.  One newbie to the group got slammed on the <br/>
  list for questioning FLIGHT and saying it didn&#39;t sound <br/>
  like unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  The owner of the list even said that she thinks society <br/>
  would crumble to pieces without public school!  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
  be questioning any of this if their name was <br/>
  WAHomeschoolers or WAFieldTripsforHomeschoolers, <br/>
  but their name is WAUNSCHOOLERS! (so it seems kind<br/>
  of misleading).<br/>
<br/>
  On the other hand, I&#39;m still new to all this, so maybe<br/>
  I&#39;m not informed enough about unschooling to make<br/>
  comments about something not seeming very<br/>
  unschooling-like.<br/>
