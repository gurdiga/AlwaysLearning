Not that children spoil at all. (Well sometimes I wonder about the smelly <br/>
teen years.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I told myself I wasn&#39;t going to get into this, but...  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is no verse in the bible which reads &quot;Spare the rod, spoil the child.&quot;<br/>
This is as close as you get:<br/>
<br/>
Proverbs 13:24<br/>
He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him chasteneth<br/>
him betimes. <br/>
(Whole Chapter: Proverbs 13Â In context: Proverbs 13:23-25  KJV)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Beats me where the other saying comes from ;-)))<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As Nancy said, the line isn&#39;t in the Bible. Here&#39;s some that are close<br/>
(though no prettier). (Sandra preserved this at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/s/rod">http://sandradodd.com/s/rod</a><br/>
in case anyone wants to trot it out when the subject of this line and the<br/>
Bible comes up.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; PROVERBS <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 13:24 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him<br/>
&gt; chasteneth him betimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 19:18 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul spare for his<br/>
&gt; crying. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 22:15 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of correction<br/>
&gt; shall drive it far from him.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 23:13 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the<br/>
&gt; rod, he shall not die.<br/>
&gt; 23:14 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul from hell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 29:15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth<br/>
&gt; his mother to shame.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bartlett&#39;s says spare the rod is from a Samuel Butler poem, Hudibras:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Love is a boy by poets styl&#39;d;<br/>
&gt; Then spare the rod, and spoil the child.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know what the context of the quote is but the ironic thing is that<br/>
his poem is, one webpage said, &quot;a burlesque satire on Puritanism&quot;. Wikipedia<br/>
says &quot;The closest analogy in the present day to the meaning of &quot;Puritan&quot; in<br/>
the 17th century would be &#39;fundamentalist&#39;&quot;<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I added that to the page.<br/>
<br/>
I like those pages, even the kind of boring ones.  Some (like <br/>
sandradodd.com/food) are big inspiring feasts, and some (like sandradodd.com/s/rod) are like <br/>
technical footnotes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a wonderful tool, the internet.   I&#39;m glad I lived to see it and even <br/>
get in there and add to it some.<br/>
