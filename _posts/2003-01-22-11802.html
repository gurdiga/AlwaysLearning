 CHICAGO, Illinois (AP) -- For Tim and Nicholas<br/>
 Peebles, school is always in session -- even at the<br/>
 grocery store. <br/>
 <br/>
 As the father and son stroll the aisles, Tim finds<br/>
 plenty of visual aids to teach 8-year-old Nicholas<br/>
 about subjects like health and nutrition,<br/>
 agriculture and economics. <br/>
 <br/>
 No longer content to sit on the sidelines, fathers<br/>
 like Tim Peebles are getting more involved in what<br/>
 was once firmly a woman&#39;s domain: homeschooling.<br/>
