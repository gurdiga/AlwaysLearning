But when I read your post my first response was how would clothing make <br/>
someone more or less aggressive? I can see how it would make someone appear <br/>
more or less aggressive, I watched the Breakfast Club the other night and <br/>
the whole transformation of Ally Sheedy&#39;s character is all about how <br/>
appearance matters. Actually much of the movie is about how appearance <br/>
matters. But it is also about how appearance is only skin deep, or societal <br/>
standards deep. At least that&#39;s what the letter at the end of the movie <br/>
tells us&lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

I just can&#39;t see how clothes could honestly change the aggression level of <br/>
an individual.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s funny how you brought that movie up because my daughter <br/>
absolutely loves that movie.  She says the one girl looked much <br/>
better before the make-over and was a little disgusted with the fact <br/>
that they made her look all preppy, and only then, did the guys think <br/>
she was good looking.  AAHHH the peer pressure thing.  Something we <br/>
talk a lot about over here.  My daughter just seems impervious to it, <br/>
but really deeply understands it. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We speculated on that too.  Several scenarios were brought up about <br/>
what could have happened to the child to make him so.  It&#39;s the same <br/>
sort of reasoning that schools have about wearing pictures of guns <br/>
and stuff and why they don&#39;t allow it.  Apparently they think it <br/>
promotes the usage of guns and violence.  I don&#39;t really see that to <br/>
be true at all.  I don&#39;t know a single kid, and I know many many <br/>
kids, that even own a gun, much less know how to use one, or want to <br/>
use one.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a bb gun here, but neither of my kids have ever expressed an <br/>
interest in it at all.  It was my husbands when he was a kid.  I <br/>
acutally really like those pop guns, they make such a loud sound <br/>
without even doing damage to anything.<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter really loves knives and has a few and would like <br/>
more.  The bigger and more dangerous the better, but she would never <br/>
use them to harm another person.  She&#39;s one of the sweetest kindest <br/>
people I know.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057358407">Apparently Robyn deleted her messages, so there&#39;s nothing to <br/>
reference to anymore.  I was going to reply to her on list and let <br/>
her know that my daughter wanted to meet her son because she said he <br/>
sounded cool and wanted to know if he had a myspace.  She was a <br/>
little disappointed that he lived all the way over in MO, while we <br/>
live in OR.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well.  She did reply to me off list letting me know that I was as <br/>
judgemental as a fundamentalist christian.  I didn&#39;t really think <br/>
that I was being very judgemental.<br/>
<br/>
I see how what she&#39;s doing could hinder her relationship with her son <br/>
though.  I could&#39;ve easily done the same thing with my daughter.  As <br/>
usual though, with these things, it&#39;s the parent that really needs to <br/>
question their own discomforts so that it doesn&#39;t get in the way of <br/>
really understanding and respecting their children.  <br/>
<br/>
If I had reacted shocked over the shock value thing, I would&#39;ve been <br/>
missing out on the fun of it all and knowing where it was coming from <br/>
and all that it has led to.  I don&#39;t think it is healthy to getting <br/>
unschooling to work, by blocking the paths that my children are <br/>
following.  If I do that, how will I know what cool things it will <br/>
lead to?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t that kind of the point of unschooling?  Encouraging your kids <br/>
to follow their own paths and enjoying it along with them and adding <br/>
to it in ways that will enrich their lives in a meaningful way.<br/>
<br/>
If I had said &quot;no&quot; to knives, my kids wouldn&#39;t know how to safely use <br/>
them, simply because I was fearful of knives.  It&#39;s sort of a self <br/>
fulfilling prophecy.  Kids that do things when they are told not to, <br/>
will find their own way to do them, without your guidance, then it <br/>
justifies your reasons for telling them &quot;no&quot; in the first place <br/>
because they&#39;ve gone and done it in an unsafe way behind your back.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t think of a single thing that my kids do behind my back.  They <br/>
just aren&#39;t like that.</div>

 </span></blockquote>That wasn&#39;t the only thing she said in the email though.  But even if <br/>
it was, it still wasn&#39;t a very nice thing to say.  When I saw that <br/>
she&#39;d left me an email, before I read it I was thinking that perhaps <br/>
her son had wanted to meet my daughter, as they seem to have similar <br/>
interests and that was where my mind was already.  So when I read the <br/>
email it felt a little insulting.<br/>
<br/>
I actually prefer to write onlist.  I don&#39;t mind if others email me <br/>
offlist, but I would hope it would be to further a comraderie of sorts.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always respond to posters onlist.  I responded to this <br/>
particular thread because I&#39;ve been there were this person is right <br/>
now.  That feeling of discomfort with something that their child is <br/>
interested in, where your gut reaction is to say &quot;no&quot;, when you work so <br/>
much at saying &quot;yes&quot; to really build up a strong relationship with your <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;yes&quot; is a huge aspect of parenting in unschooling.  If my gut <br/>
reaction is to say &quot;no&quot; to something, then that&#39;s a big indicator that <br/>
I, as the parent, need to re-examine my own hang ups and feelings.  <br/>
Talking to my kids about where they are coming from is extremely <br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
With this particular issue of clothing, just being present with my <br/>
daughter and talking about her likes and dislikes I came to discover <br/>
that my assumption of the why&#39;s and what&#39;s of it all were all wrong.  <br/>
My daughter showed things in a whole new light to me.  I never would <br/>
have found that out if I&#39;d said &quot;no&quot; because something felt <br/>
uncomfortable with me, or if I had a misunderstanding about it.  It <br/>
would have been a missed opportunity of connection and understanding <br/>
with my child.<br/>
<br/>
At the age of 12 and 13, if you keep missing those opportunities and <br/>
connections and understandings, you will break those bonds that you <br/>
worked so hard on building all those years when they were little.  It&#39;s <br/>
a crucial age where you can make it or break it, so to speak.  You <br/>
might still have a child that you can talk to and hang out with, but <br/>
that extra special something will be gone.  That trust and <br/>
understanding won&#39;t be there like it was.  It&#39;s not something you can <br/>
just do when your kids are little and it&#39;s easier because they are more <br/>
trusting and more likely to do what you say.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;no&quot; because a parent feels that it is best for the child&#39;s own <br/>
good, doesn&#39;t promote confidence in the child or their ability to make <br/>
good decisions for themselves.  Ulimately, the message you send is that <br/>
you don&#39;t trust them to make good decision and that you, because you <br/>
are the adult, know the only &quot;right&quot; way to do it.  It&#39;s extremely <br/>
arrogant to assume that a 12 or 13 yr old, or any age, doesn&#39;t have a <br/>
better answer than the adult does.  My kids show me creative logical <br/>
reasoning all the time.  They come up with better solutions than I do <br/>
sometimes.  I wouldn&#39;t know that if I said &quot;no&quot; and made them do it my <br/>
way.  They simply wouldn&#39;t have the opportunity to show me how smart <br/>
they are in their decision making abilities.<br/>
<br/>
Traditional parenting tells parents to make the decisions and then when <br/>
the kids do it differently they call is misbehaving or disobedience, or <br/>
any other number of other things.  Kids get told good only when they do <br/>
it like the parents want them to.  There is no room for following their <br/>
own instincts to solve problems or navigate their life, unless it <br/>
happens to be what the parents say is good and right.  It goes both <br/>
ways too and eventually the kid will be grown and say &quot;nope, my way <br/>
now, so butt out&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I already see a marked difference in my relationship with my children <br/>
that other parents don&#39;t have.  I contribute that to the way we treat <br/>
each other and my ability to let go and say &quot;yes&quot; and really deeply <br/>
trust my kids and their abiltiy to make good choices for themselves.  <br/>
They do make good choices too, and even when they don&#39;t, the only place <br/>
to go from there is to make a better one next time.  No punishment, no <br/>
shaming or blaming, more just sympathizing with them about the outcome <br/>
of a poor decision.<br/>
<br/>
And just by the way, my 13 yo dd doesn&#39;t own any clothing items with <br/>
guns on it, but that&#39;s not why she&#39;s sweet and kind and gentle.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642563598">For me, saying &quot;Yes&quot; is not saying &quot;Yay! Woohoo! Let&#39;s do it right<br/>
now&quot;, about every and any thing. I think it&#39;s easy for someone looking<br/>
on to see RU style parenting as all about being cool in a way that can<br/>
seem only rebellious, if the depth of it is not understood, and<br/>
practiced by those who venture into the territory. <br/>
<br/>
The bits I snipped out of Jen&#39;s post and left there below leapt out at<br/>
me particularly. Most especially the importance of talking with our<br/>
young people about where they&#39;re coming from. I&#39;ve frequently found<br/>
that what I think my daughter might be thinking about something, ie.<br/>
the way *I* see it ;) is so not where she is coming from. <br/>
