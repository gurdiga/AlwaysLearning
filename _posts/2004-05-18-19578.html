<div id="ygrps-yiv-1390902799">My favorite list has been VERY quiet lately!<br/>
<br/>
Ben and I just finished watching PBS&#39; Colonial House.<br/>
<br/>
At the end, we saw that Coldwell Banker was a sponsor. Ben thought that that <br/>
was a bit ironic. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I added that to make it worse, they could have added Lowe&#39;s, a grocery store <br/>
(Piggly Wiggly was my suggestion), Time-Warner Cable, and Microsoft! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Anybody else watch?<br/>

I watched, but fell asleep before I found out what the 21st century tragedy <br/>
was!  What happened, and what did they do about it?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872515690">One of the girl&#39;s (of the preacher from TX) boyfriend died in a car accident<br/>
and so they went home.  Boy they sure were unorganized.  Must be hard when<br/>
you have so many different people coming together with different ideas.  I<br/>
can&#39;t imagine they came into it not realizing they would have to work their<br/>
butts off all day long every day, though.  Interesting to watch people.<br/>

One teens girl&#39;s boyfriend was in an accident with her older brother. The <br/>
brother (and son) was injured, but the boyfriend was killed. The family left. Dad <br/>
returns later; he was the governor. He returns at the very end of episode <br/>
two, so we&#39;re left hanging. I bet the little brother (9-ish?) was glad to be home <br/>
though!<br/>
