Many thanks for the David Albert live chat info--I think his thoughts are <br/>
always worth listening to.  Our family just read aloud Charles Dickens&#39; Hard <br/>
Times because of a reference he made to that novel in a recent column.  I look <br/>
forward to &quot;tuning in&quot; on Thursday--thanks again!<br/>
