************* I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so simple... There are two people inside me, the adult, and the child. The adult wants something, but the child inside, who wasn&#39;t free, wasn&#39;t listened at all is fighting for doing the same to my children. <br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s clear, really difficult en english for me, but my life showed me that there&#39;s no only the willpower. I need the &quot;tilt&quot;. My willpower can nothing if I don&#39;t feel the &quot;tilt&quot;.<br/>

================<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if you have it in France, but here because of programs to help  <br/>
adults whose parents were alcoholics or adults who have grown up feeling that  <br/>
they can only be happy if they make another person happy (co-dependency), the <br/>
 concept of the inner child is discussed pretty freely.  <br/>
 <br/>
When you make decisions about what to do with or for your children, don&#39;t  be <br/>
jealous.<br/>
You can heal your own inner child little by little if you do what you would  <br/>
have liked to have done for you when you were little.   When you tell  your <br/>
child &quot;Yes, you can have this&quot; or &quot;Okay, we can stay at the park longer,&quot;  think <br/>
of yourself at that age, and imagine someone having done that for you, and  <br/>
think &quot;It&#39;s not too late to have a happy childhood.&quot; <br/>
 <br/>
You can relive your childhood in an improved, healing, soothing way by  <br/>
giving the ideal childhood to your children.<br/>
 <br/>
If your parents had known what you know now, would they have been nicer to  <br/>
you?  Forgive them.  They just didn&#39;t know any better, or maybe they  bowed to <br/>
pressure from their own older relatives.  As you picture each  incident when <br/>
you&#39;re making your decision you can begin to consider why your mom  said no, <br/>
and what would have been the worst to happen if she had said yes?   And then you <br/>
can say yes for her and for you too.<br/>

****************************** oh ! I&#39;m not jealous at all... When I say there is a fight inside, it was inconscient, at the beginning. I have 9 years of therapy behind me, and I had the time to know myself very well for some things.. But I think nothing is so helpfull, but hard, then children to make get off those things we have inside us, because of our childhood. It&#39;s not jealousy, but just repetition, inconscient repetition, even if I don&#39;t want to do them what I lived myself. It&#39;s better and better, but I think that if we don&#39;t want to repeat, it&#39;s something very hard to work, because of the inconscient. Again, with children, the willpower doesn&#39;t work at all, since we know about our own childhood, and work on it. Sometimes, I react like my mother reacted with me, even if I don&#39;t want, even if I can&#39;t stand that kind of react at all. I just do the same, like mimicry, and I know I don&#39;t want to do this way. <br/>
<br/>

*************** Yes, now I&#39;m sure about it, I just see it since a few days... It&#39;s very new for me, but I can feel something, I can feel what it is... And I had the &quot;tilt&quot;, so, I&#39;m sure I will go on..<br/>
<br/>
If your parents had known what you know now, would they have been nicer to  <br/>
you?  Forgive them. <br/>
*************** I think I did. But again, I think I forgived them without wanting to. It&#39;s just happened, because of all this work I did whith myself, all those years, and espacially because of my children. Their births change something in me, I let all my anger, my hate for my mother. Now I feel in peace with them. Before this &quot;tilt&quot;, I tried and I tried, but it&#39;s the same thing, the willpower doesn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t think we can forgive by the willpower. One day, something coming inside, and it comes. <br/>
