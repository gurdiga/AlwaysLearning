<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482632714">The Logical Journey of the Zoombinis is REALLY fun - REALLLLLY fun  <br/>
for all ages.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard really good things about &quot;ClueFinders&quot; from &quot;The Learning  <br/>
Company.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are some great math-based games from Edmark called the &quot;Mighty  <br/>
Math&quot; series -  Number Heroes, Carnival Countdown, Zoo Zillions,  <br/>
Calculating Crew, Astro Alegbra, and Cosmic Geometry. Number Heroes  <br/>
and Carnival Countdown are for kids probably 5 to 9 years old or so.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just a thought - I&#39;m not sure what kind of a system you&#39;re running on <br/>
but if my son had accesss to an XP I think I might get him a <br/>
subscription to the new Gametap site ($15 or so a month) they get <br/>
unlimited access to what I thought was a lot of games my son really <br/>
enjoyed at ages 6&7, but he spends more time with the PS2 now and he <br/>
only has a Windows ME, so for us now we can&#39;t do it but for what you <br/>
get I thought it looked like a good deal so that&#39;s why I am suggesting <br/>
it. We have probably at least 200 games that we have bought (yep big <br/>
$$ but definately worth it IMO) and I saw many of them on there and <br/>
more. Something you could look into - Barbara</div>

<br/>
Holly loved 3rd grade adventures (which was similar to zoombinis) and  <br/>
really did NOT like the 4th grade version of it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if there are editions of these compatible with new  <br/>
machines, but all my kids liked Thinking Things.<br/>
<br/>
Zoombinis, absolutely, though.<br/>
And if Backyard, Treehouse and Playroom are still available in any  <br/>
form, those got hundreds of hours of play.<br/>
<br/>
Scholastic Books has a Software Club (like the book club, and  <br/>
homeschoolers can order from there) and used to be (probably still)  <br/>
you could get low prices and earn points to get free games pretty  <br/>
easily.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids enjoy Zoombinis, Clue Finders, Scooby Doo in Egypt (or something <br/>
of the sort), Magic Schoolbus, Ages of Mythology, SpyFox.<br/>
<br/>
Online they play a lot at Cartoon Network, and the girls enjoy Polly <br/>
Pockets and MyScene.com--just throwing those out there for anyone with <br/>
girls who might be interested.<br/>
<br/>
Starfall.com is a reading site that some kids enjoy--mine thought it was <br/>
okay when I showed it to them, but weren&#39;t wowed.<br/>
<br/>
They also like their gameboys and leapsters. We don&#39;t have a game system <br/>
yet, so no recommendations there.<br/>

<br/>
Zoombinis for sure!!<br/>
<br/>
SpyFox is similar to Freddy Fish, so that&#39;s a possibility.<br/>
Also, Pajama Sam is fun around here.<br/>

Putt Putt is easier, imo, so perhaps that&#39;s a maybe.<br/>
