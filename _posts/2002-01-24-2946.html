<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have a &quot;situation&quot; here right now. My son, who is 14 today (wow! when did <br/>
&gt; THAT happen??) has a very good (also 14) friend who confided in him a year <br/>
&gt; ago that she&#39;s gay. She&#39;s been debating for months on how/when to tell her <br/>
&gt; parents, and it came out vaguely in a heated argument a week ago. Two days <br/>
&gt; ago, her parents had rummaged through her room and found a love letter from <br/>
&gt; her girlfriend. They attacked her with it, and she ran over here in tears <br/>
&gt; that night.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Her parents are very religious (SC, remember) and homophobic and know that <br/>
&gt; she&#39;s going straight to hell. Her older sister was &quot;Miss Blue Devil&quot;, a <br/>
&gt; social butterfly, and modeled for a while; and this girl can&#39;t do anything <br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s really a delightful girl---her parents only see &quot;dyke&quot;. They&#39;ve taken <br/>
&gt; away her phone, her computer, all functions (no going out with friends, no <br/>
&gt; movies, no parties, etc), and (worst of all) called her friend&#39;s parents <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &quot;outed&quot; this girl as well to her parents! Both girls are very upset---and <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t even speak to each other! They don&#39;t go to the same school, so they <br/>
&gt; can&#39;t even see each other there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She&#39;s welcome to use our phone and computer (although the other girl&#39;s <br/>
&gt; parents have agreed that they are NEVER to speak to each other again) and <br/>
&gt; just to hang out here as much as possible.&lt; I guess the &quot;straight&quot; boy&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; seen as a threat.&gt; And she seems to need to talk both to Cameron and to me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I was hoping for *something* from y&#39;all---especially maybe <br/>
&gt; KathrynB---something that I could give her to help her through this. My <br/>
&gt; advice so far has been to &quot;lay low&quot; and not stir things up. And that they <br/>
&gt; can <br/>
&gt; control her environment, but not her thoughts, feelings, beliefs, and <br/>
&gt; sexuality. And to write a letter telling her parents calmly and gently how <br/>
&gt; she feels (all conversations turn into &quot;who can yell the loudest&quot;). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anything else from y&#39;all?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks so much!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kelly<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, my!  My first thought, of course, was *She can come live with us!*<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, the first, best thing, is that she has you and your son. One of the <br/>
biggest reasons the suicide rate among gay teens is so high is that they have <br/>
NO ONE.  You two have the opportunity to let her know that she&#39;s okay, she&#39;s <br/>
normal, that she&#39;s loved.  You know how to say, &quot;uh-huh, yes, isn&#39;t it <br/>
terrible&quot; to her parents (or to educate them if you think that&#39;s possible, <br/>
but it&#39;s more important that they let you be with her) and to give her space <br/>
and resources and options.<br/>
<br/>
Fourteen sucks. She has a long time before she can really be free of her <br/>
parents, and they CAN control her environment. Your advice to lie low is <br/>
probably best at this point. I&#39;ll try to come up with some resources she can <br/>
keep at your house. Where do you live? There may be some local groups she can <br/>
connect with. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll think about this and try to think of some other ideas. <br/>
<br/>
Kelly...thank you SO much for being there for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1157222020">When I was in High School, I wanted Ricky so bad.  He was tall, handsome,<br/>
funny, kind.  I just loved him to death.  I tried and tried to get him<br/>
interested in me.  I even tried out for the school play so I could kiss him<br/>
(he was the lead in a romantic comedy) I wasn&#39;t half bad looking back then<br/>
and couldn&#39;t figure out why he wasn&#39;t interested at all.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody told me he had a girlfriend in Oklahoma, a few hours away.  I was<br/>
bummed but figured that explained it.  Several years later, I learned that<br/>
Ricky was gay, had known about it for years and had run off with another<br/>
friend from High School to California.  It broke my heart when I learned<br/>
they both died of AIDS.  They were good friends and I miss them.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps a long distance romance could also solve some problems.<br/>
