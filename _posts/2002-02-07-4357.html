<div id="ygrps-yiv-563698478">&lt;&lt;She says she wants to be a monkey scientist some day like Jane Goodall.  <br/>
She really believes her animals are very smart and tells me how she has <br/>
trained them.  The most recent thing was training her cat to flush the toilet <br/>
since he likes seeing the water swirl.  Today he fell in the bath tub with <br/>
her because he was playing with the stream of water.  Now I&#39;m getting off <br/>
track.<br/>

<br/>
&gt;There are books and videos about animal behavior, though, that you could <br/>
&gt;kinda be looking for.  And any movies with trained animals (Homeward Bound, <br/>
&gt;Dr. Doolitle) would probably be of interest to her.  Fly Away Home is fun <br/>
&gt;even for people who aren&#39;t fascinated by animal behavior.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I really think you hit on something big here.  They have lots of books on animal intellegence and animal behavior in the library that I think Virginia will love.  One of the books is called &quot;Experiments with Animal Behavior&quot; and it is written for kids.  I can&#39;t wait to get it for her.<br/>
<br/>
She recently spent hours observing her cat and writing her observations in a journal.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone!<br/>

&lt;&lt;  They have lots of books on animal intellegence and animal behavior in the <br/>

<br/>
Maybe take her with you, show her where it is, and let her decide.<br/>
<br/>
Bringing a book like that home could backfire.  If you press the scientific <br/>
explanations on her, you might take out the mystery and joy of her own <br/>
discoveries.<br/>
<br/>
I think more &quot;evidence&quot; before explanation might be better.  Depends on her <br/>
personality, but if she&#39;s discovering a puzzle to figure out, don&#39;t bring an <br/>
answer key.<br/>
<br/>
Some of those books can be depressing, too, if they&#39;re too much about lab <br/>
animals.  The mothering studies from the 60&#39;s with the baby monkeys made big <br/>
changes in doctors&#39; advice and treatment of babies in hospitals and <br/>
orphanages, but they&#39;re not going to cheer up any animal-loving children, so <br/>
be careful what you bring home.<br/>
<br/>
Koko&#39;s Kitten (a book for kids) is great from the point of view of someone <br/>
interested in language development and communicating by sign language, but it <br/>
involves mourning a dead kitten, so might not be good for her either.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Virginia was not as excited as I thought she would be about the animal behavior books.  I told her about the books I was looking for and she hung around that section with me for a few minutes but then went on to find different books.  I&#39;ll go through the stuff I found and see if there is anything with neat pictures and show them to her.  Otherwise I&#39;ll let it go for now.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Koko&#39;s Kitten was a big hit with her.  She is also very much into sign language so it hit on more than one interest.  She handled the sad part pretty well but doesn&#39;t always.<br/>

Thanks<br/>
