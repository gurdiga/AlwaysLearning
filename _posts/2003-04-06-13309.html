 So many people look at age and grade and scores and calendar and their vague <br/>
 recollections of what they had to know at that age, and never even THINK of <br/>
 looking at the human being. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES!<br/>
That was the thing that started my wheels turning about homeschooling in <br/>
general. Two amazing girls that had been homeschooled their whole lives.<br/>
Opened my mind up to possibilities.<br/>
Cool story.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve found that the schooled mindset seems to be MUCH more ingrained in <br/>
&gt; PARENTS. My friends who have no children really GET unschooling and are <br/>
&gt; VERY <br/>
&gt; supportive---even the &quot;educators&quot;. It&#39;s as if the DAY you have a child---  <br/>
&gt; &quot;education&quot; becomes all-important. Like they can&#39;t see any further than a <br/>
&gt; good school (and we all know how they sell houses! &lt;g&gt;)!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always just assumed that some people with kids dislike homeschooling in <br/>
general because  they percieve it as an implied criticism of their schooling <br/>
choices. <br/>
