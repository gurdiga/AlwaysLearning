<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147232222">The comments are getting scattered, and I want to bring some to the same place.   In the sleep thread, Joyce wrote a response:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So even if unschoolers are &quot;permissive&quot;, they may<br/>
&gt; create a social atmosphere for their children where peer pressure <br/>
&gt; supports<br/>
&gt; good decisions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Being permissive isn&#39;t a good concept for unschooling. It also isn&#39;t a <br/>
good word to use for what unschoolers do since it muddies what&#39;s <br/>
really happening. Permissive suggests disengagement, detachment, <br/>
leaving kids to their own devices, letting them do whatever they want.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about greater engagement with kids than conventional <br/>
parenting. It&#39;s about connecting with kids to support who they are, <br/>
support their interests, help them explore the world.<br/>
<br/>
Kids being allowed to enjoy wine with the family is not at all the <br/>
same as being permissive. The only quality they share is whether or <br/>
not the parents allow the kids to have alcohol. All the important <br/>
factors that build a healthy relationship with alcohol don&#39;t exist <br/>
under the &quot;Permissive&quot; label.<br/>
==========================<br/>
<br/>
Before I saw that, I had written on the under-age thread:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The term &quot;permissive&quot; isn&#39;t the same as living so closely with our kids that they really trust us.  It&#39;s not &quot;whatever.&quot;  It&#39;s &quot;Let&#39;s talk about it,&quot; and &quot;thanks for telling me,&quot; and &quot;have you considered?...&quot;<br/>
==========================<br/>
<br/>
-=- But again, if we&#39;re controlling the peer group to some<br/>
 extent, she won&#39;t engage in habits that we don&#39;t engage in, unless <br/>
 there is<br/>
 external, and persistent, pressure.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This seems to assume that people only do things other people tell them to do.  We&#39;re talking about kids who have not been school-trained, curriculum-trained, or been subjected to any operant conditioning situations.    We&#39;re talking about kids who are used to thinking and making choices, in the presence of adults who know them well and with as much advice and input as they want.   <br/>
<br/>
Few scientists have ever seen such people. :-)<br/>
And unschoolers are not going to be a scientific study group for the benefit of anyone&#39;s research, either.<br/>
<br/>
When Joyce shares, or I share, or other people who have immersed themselves in unschooling philosophy and practice for a dozen years, or twenty, we&#39;re not guessing or just shooting the breeze.  We&#39;re talking about what we have seen, experienced and know.<br/>
