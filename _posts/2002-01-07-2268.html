<div id="ygrps-yiv-479894731">Oh Callie, sometimes families aren&#39;t much fun are they?  My Zach will be 9<br/>
in June and has no interest in reading.  He has had very little interest in<br/>
being read to even, until we discovered &quot;Captain Underpants&quot;.  He also would<br/>
have been labeled and we would have been pressured to medicate him.<br/>
Sometimes the family is wonderful and sometimes they aren&#39;t.  Zach has many<br/>
talents, they just don&#39;t tend to fall into &quot;academic&quot; areas.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of missing sounds, my Marsie (5) can&#39;t say &quot;L&quot; sounds.  This<br/>
morning she was painstakingly teaching my Danny (3) how to say &quot;jewwy&quot;.<br/>
They worked on it over and over.  Made me smile.<br/>
