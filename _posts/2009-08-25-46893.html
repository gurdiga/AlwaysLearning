<div id="ygrps-yiv-275324">for virtual strewing you can subscribe (best price - it&#39;s free) to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.csiro.au/services/ScienceByEmail.html">http://www.csiro.au/services/ScienceByEmail.html</a><br/>
which will send an email each Friday (Thursday in the USA etc) which has science news and a science activity each week - my boys use it by scanning the email incase something sparks an interest, if it does we get the materials together.<br/>

Sharing ideas isn&#39;t a bad idea, but what&#39;s good for natural learning  <br/>
is to remember to look for science all over the place, and not just on  <br/>
&quot;science sites.&quot;  When you&#39;re on a science site, think of history and  <br/>
art and music, while you&#39;re in there.  Try to &quot;double dip&quot; in your  <br/>
learning-life as much as possible.  :-)<br/>
