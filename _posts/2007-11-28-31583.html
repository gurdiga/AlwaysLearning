<br/>
Someone pointed out a bad link on one of my pages, and upon checking  <br/>
that I had it working, I was sucked into the site.<br/>
The page it&#39;s on is<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/vijay">http://sandradodd.com/t/vijay</a><br/>
Vijay on Television, Children and Making Decisions Rationally<br/>
<br/>
The links is to<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tvturnoff.org">http://www.tvturnoff.org</a><br/>
and here&#39;s their logo, for those who are set up to see such things:<br/>
￼<br/>
<br/>
Very TV-like. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But on this page there are some very thought-provoking &quot;facts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Children watch 2.1 hours of television per day, second only to  <br/>
the time they spend sleeping.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
So those days were measured in such a way that nothing else happened  <br/>
for two hours?  Not being with siblings or parents?  Not being in  <br/>
school?  (They discuss homework/schoolwork.)  Some kids ride a  <br/>
schoolbus 2.1 hours a day.  Maybe the averaged out homework for the  <br/>
week or something, I don&#39;t know, but it seems worthless.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Analysis of 1,063 children&#39;s television programs shows that...  <br/>
educational programs designed for school-aged children are not  <br/>
available.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they shouldn&#39;t have been looking at &quot;children&#39;s television  <br/>
programs&quot; if they wanted to see how and where real-aged people learn  <br/>
from TV.  Did they consider newsmagazine shows, talk shows, Nova,  <br/>
documentaries, concerts or cooking shows?  WHY should there be  <br/>
&quot;designed-for-school-aged&quot; educational programs?  School thinks and  <br/>
claims it&#39;s serving all a child&#39;s educational needs.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s another bit some of  you will see and some might not:<br/>
￼<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a graph showing that children spend more time watching TV than  <br/>
doing schoolwork at home.<br/>
Good for them.<br/>
<br/>
Since my kids have no schoolwork at home, they can spend all that  <br/>
time watching more TV and learning more.<br/>
<br/>
 From an unschooling point of view, this doesn&#39;t make sense:<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Analysis of 1,063 children&#39;s television programs shows that...  <br/>
educational programs designed for school-aged children are not  <br/>
available.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why analyze 1,063 children&#39;s programs?  Why not just look at real  <br/>
children and how they learn from all kind of things?<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Over half (55.8%) of secondary aged young people have a  <br/>
television set in their room... Children with television sets in  <br/>
their bedrooms watch 2.5 hours more per week...&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly doesn&#39;t have a TV in her bedroom anymore, but she used to.   <br/>
When she did, she would have it on while she cleaned  her room,  <br/>
braided her My Little Ponies manes, drew and colored, worked on the  <br/>
computer, made fairies with pipe cleaners and sparkly cloth and  <br/>
wooden beads.  I think those families with rules against bringing  <br/>
things like that into the den would (by their own rules) see TV  <br/>
watching as a sit-and-look-quietly activity.<br/>
<br/>
I could go on, but I won&#39;t. The page is short.  The site is large.<br/>

that my children spend a lot more time at home than most schooled <br/>
children and probably watch a lot more tv, but percentage wise watch a <br/>
comparably less amount of total at home time watching tv.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943274128">What about Einstein?  He was a big fan of &quot;Your Show of Shows.&quot;   <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; ran from 1950 to 1954. At its peak, it had 25 million <br/>
viewers, including Albert Einstein, who apparently took great delight in a stock <br/>
Caesar character, the German professor who was an expert on everything. Mr. <br/>
Caesar said that Einstein&#39;s secretary called him with a request from Einstein <br/>
that the two get together. Einstein died before this strange meeting of the <br/>
minds could take place. &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; ran from 1950 to 1954.&quot;  _Manic <br/>

&spon=&pagewanted=print) <br/>
 <br/>
and<br/>
 <br/>
&quot;Some 36 years ago Albert Einstein requested the pleasure of Sid Caesar&#39;s <br/>
presence at Princeton. This performer, a kind of pyrotechnic of comedy, was <br/>
lighting up the television screen for 90 minutes, 39 weeks a year with a show that <br/>
had the elements of timing the universe relies on. Einstein died before Caesar <br/>
could come to him, but Robert Oppenheimer later told Mr. Caesar: &#39;&#39;Albert <br/>
wanted to see you. He figured out the physical equation. He wanted to talk to you <br/>
about the human equation.&#39;<br/>
 <br/>
History agrees that Einstein usually knew what he was talking about, and it&#39;s <br/>
clear the man knew his comedy. Mr. Caesar&#39;s work is the humor of the human <br/>
condition, &#39;&#39;taken a little further,&#39;&#39; as he says.&quot;   _THEATER; Humorous Sages <br/>
