<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103422969">Thank-you for all the clarity.  I am going to refer back to all of your posts in my times of weakness.  I got into a very fear driven space for a while and now I have Vertigo which made everything worse.  I might be coming out of it now somewhat but it is an effort to not get paralysed by fear. <br/>
I think I have made an effort not to let this situation affect the kids beyond it&#39;s obvious effects of having less.  Vega&#39;s stealing I think may have reflected the situation.  He seems to want more than the others and is relentless in his asking.  I know a few times I finally responded to the nagging with &quot;We cannot afford it.&quot;<br/>
He asks for things that we wouldn&#39;t buy anyway.  I know he can feel less than abundant, especially having a friend who seems to have so much and is always doing a variety of classes.  We are pretty busy too I think but last night he said he wants to stay up all night and sleep all day because he is bored during the day. It is hot, hot, hot, here in Vegas and the summers are really a challenge because you cannot do much outside.  We do swim a lot but getting them in any sort of swim class did not pan out for them.  The boys just seem to think classes, or the one&#39;s I find for them, are boring.<br/>
Oh, the kids are awake now and I haven&#39;t finishe the post.  I&#39;ll have to respond later.  I might have gotten a bit off topic.<br/>

The idea of living in abundance vs. scarcity is a big one in unschooling.  It is both tangible and non-tangible.  There will always be someone that appears to have more than you.  More time, more house, more activities, more money, more traveling, just more more more.  It will help to stop comparing yourself to others.  Looking for the abundance of your own life will help enormously.  What do you have in abundance?<br/>
<br/>
That will be different for every person, every family.  We have an abundance of computers at our house.  We have an abundance of time, and remember time is priceless, how much time is one person&#39;s time worth?  How much time is a mother&#39;s time worth?  If you went out and got a job right now, how much would you get paid for your time, how much would it cost your family for you to get paid for your time?  Now go, do something with your kids, something sweet and abundant, milk and cookies and a movie, even, and decide what that time was worth.<br/>
<br/>
Abundance is in the eye of the beholder, as is scarcity.  It seems, and this is my experience, you can choose one or the other, regardless of physical possessions and monetarily defined activities.  Your whole physical being as a mom can be one of giving abundance to your kids.  <br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s really hard for a young child to go to the store without feeling scarcity, don&#39;t take him.  Bring him home something small and special, even if it&#39;s a box of tic tacs from the checkout stand.  Those little things, those little extras that are so inexpensive, add up to a feeling of being loved and thought of and feeling abundant.  Thrift stores are great for feeling abundant with physical things.  Underneath the physical though, a feeling of abundance comes from feeling emotionally full.  Nobody can buy that feeling.  A parent can help create that feeling by giving of him or herself to a child that is feeling lack.  <br/>
<br/>
Look around your house, your neighborhood, what can you give to your child right now that will add to his feeling of abundance?  Paper airplanes?  A bike ride?  A bucket of ice?  A platter of interesting food?  A cozy place to sit?  An unusual game found online?  A made up game of cards?  A pocket knife and pieces of wood?  The ideas are limitless and they exist IN ABUNDANCE, but only if you choose to see it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1150359129">We&#39;re having some troubles with my daughter (who&#39;s just turned 6), <br/>
surrounding money and spending.  We&#39;re a little short of money right now <br/>
(hopefully temporary), though not completely.  The problem we&#39;re having is <br/>
that our daughter seems to have no sense of evaluating how badly she wants <br/>
something.  She will see something, and just want it, and there is no <br/>
variation in the level of wanting.  Everything she sees, she wants and <br/>
insists she is going to be miserable if she doesn&#39;t get it.  Quite <br/>
frequently, if I ask her what it actually is that she&#39;s wanting (as in, what <br/>
is in that box on the shelf), she has no idea, but she&#39;s going to scream <br/>
until she gets it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Today she went shopping with her dad for the express purpose of buying <br/>
another craft kit like the one she just enjoyed, but got swayed in the store <br/>
by some pretty looking toys, and DH agreed that she could have them instead <br/>
(they were around the same price).  Then about an hour or so after getting <br/>
home and playing with the toy, she wished she had bought the other toy, and <br/>
wanted to go straight back and buy it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really not sure how to handle this given her complete lack of ability to <br/>
evaluate what she wants to buy.  We&#39;ve tried giving her pocket money, but <br/>
she will spend it on the first thing she sees, then we just have the same <br/>
desperate need to buy everything else she sees.  As much as possible we try <br/>
to avoid situations where there are going to be lots of things she wants, <br/>
but sometimes it just isn&#39;t possible.  I also find it really hard when she <br/>
wants something that I can see she will really get a lot of enjoyment out <br/>
of, not to just buy it for her.  But then I feel like I&#39;m evaluating what <br/>
she is getting, and perhaps she might really enjoy some of those things that <br/>
I can&#39;t see any value in. (As she frequently has previously.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m at a loss as to how I can handle this in an unschooling manner, <br/>
especially given our limited finances at the moment.  I feel like I&#39;m <br/>
constantly saying no to her, and neither of us are enjoying it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649892173">Six is pretty young to be evaluating her wants!<br/>
<br/>
I used to make a wish list for my daughter. That was a &quot;yes&quot; even  <br/>
though it wasn&#39;t a &quot;run out and get it this minute&quot; kind of yes. She  <br/>
felt like I was taking her wishes seriously, especially since I  <br/>
followed up on those lists and did my best to get what she wanted,  <br/>
when I could. We even made wish lists right in the store.<br/>
<br/>
Limited finances is a real limitation, not an artificial one to teach  <br/>
a lesson as some people do to their kids. You can avoid too many &quot;I  <br/>
want that&quot; scenarios by leaving her at home to play with dad while you  <br/>
shop. If she needs to go with you somewhere, you can tell her you have  <br/>
enough money for, say, one Littlest Pet Shop animal or one small  <br/>
plushie (or whatever it is she likes the most) to give her a choice.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to consider is that maybe she&#39;s understanding that money  <br/>
is scarce and is trying to get what she can before there&#39;s none left.   <br/>
It&#39;s sort of like kids who won&#39;t stop playing video games, because  <br/>
they know their game time is going to run out.  Take her to dollar  <br/>
stores, so she can fill a basket with things. Or go to a thrift store  <br/>
and find some cool stuff together. Think abundance!<br/>
<br/>
It *is* hard not to buy something our kids would really enjoy. But you  <br/>
can get it eventually, when you can afford it. Maybe your daughter  <br/>
might like to keep track of change in a jar to add up to something  <br/>
special.<br/>
<br/>
I can get caught up wanting to get everything my daughter wants  <br/>
because I want her to have it. I do that myself - want something  <br/>
*right* now. But even I make myself a list and I feel better, just  <br/>
knowing that it&#39;s possible.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, my daughter is 15 and sometimes *really* wants something. I write  <br/>
what she wants on a list, and she&#39;s cool with it, still.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-299440397">I like the idea of taking her to dollar stores and thrift stores. Maybe, if she&#39;s sensing a lack of money in the house, you could also give her a quarter or two every day, so her money is building up and she always has some, rather than having to wait a long time, in her mind, to have more money once she&#39;s spent it. Then you could take her, once a week or so, to a store where that money could stretch to 2 or 3 new things each week.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then it might be a good idea to stop asking that question! It can be helpful to ask more pertinent questions, though - to ask your dd what looks so wonderful, not in a snarky, dismissive way, but the way you&#39;d ask a friend &quot;what is it about this car/phone/dishwasher that you like?&quot; Ask out of interest and curiosity, to let your child-friend know you are interested in her wants and loves and fascinations. Don&#39;t jump straight from &quot;I want&quot; to talking about cost and whether its actually feasible to buy that thing - that jump is often what breaks the bubble for kids, turns the attraction of something new and lovely to a power struggle. <br/>
<br/>
 Sometimes its enough to acknowledge a want, and that the wanted item is wonderful in its own special way. Some kids are even happy &quot;having&quot; an item for the duration of the time in the store, which can seem boggling to adults. I&#39;ve filled shopping carts with things Mo wanted, only to pare it all down to what we had the money for at the time - put seventy five percent of the contents of the cart back on the shelf - because it was enough that she &quot;had&quot; it all for an hour. Like I said, that doesn&#39;t work with every child, and it certainly doesn&#39;t work without a lot of compassion for and attention to the needs and desires of the child in the moment. Its not some kind of trick, its a way of saying &quot;yes&quot; that fills a need for some kids (or adults for that matter, like reading an article while waiting in line means you don&#39;t have any need to buy the magazine). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Then about an hour or so after getting <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sucks to realize that you wish you&#39;d gotten the other thing. I&#39;ve been there more times than I can count! Be compassionate. Depending on the cost and the duration of the trip, is it feasible to go out and get the other thing? If not, put it on a wish list or vision board, treat the matter as seriously as if you&#39;d bought a bra that didn&#39;t end up being as comfortable an hour after wearing it as it seemed in the changing room. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m at a loss as to how I can handle this in an unschooling manner, <br/>
&gt; especially given our limited finances at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Finances are sometimes a very real limit. It can help to have a budget - with Mo it used to help, if we were going to more than one store in a trip, to have a budget for each store since I knew she&#39;d want to get something everywhere we stopped. So I&#39;d do a little thinking ahead of time, think about the prices of things in each store, and set an amount based on that. <br/>
<br/>
When our finances have been dire, we didn&#39;t take Mo to stores. George and I would arrange our scedules so that one of us could go without her. I did take her to yard sales, library sales, auctions and thrift shops so that *she* could shop, but not retail stores. I set it up so that I could say Yes. I even did things like visited banks for the free lollipops and balloons so that she could get something when we were all feeling the pinch of finances really hard. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Everything she sees, she wants and <br/>
&gt; insists she is going to be miserable if she doesn&#39;t get it. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In the moment, commiserate. Let her know her feelings are important to you. Outside the moment, it can help to talk about what you do and how you feel when you can&#39;t have some lovely thing you want. What are your strategies? <br/>
<br/>
There are occasions when, right before going in to a store, I&#39;ll let Mo know &quot;I only have money for this one thing (milk, for example) so please don&#39;t ask for anything else.&quot; She&#39;s understanding about those few times, and doesn&#39;t ask.<br/>

<br/>
We used to have a list taped to the wall in the kitchen.  That way if  <br/>
we were out and someone expressed a &quot;wish we had..&quot; or &quot;we should  <br/>
get...&quot; I&#39;d say &quot;Let&#39;s put it on the list when we get home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes by the time we were home, it wasn&#39;t worth putting on the  <br/>
list anymore.   First elimination phase.<br/>
Sometimes we would find something at a thrift store that eliminated  <br/>
something from the list--not necessarily by being the same item.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby had a couple of things on there just for funs.  The  <br/>
one I remember was &quot;exploding stroller.&quot;  So the list was clear not a  <br/>
serious-business list.  It was helpful, though, because a couple of  <br/>
times a guest to the house came over and saw something and said &quot;Oh, I  <br/>
have...&quot; something like it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you have an electronic list it should be printed out and put  <br/>
in public.  Sometimes a need passes, or if others are seeing the list,  <br/>
they can help prioritize.  I do remember sometimes the joy I felt in  <br/>
seeing Marty and Kirby suggest that something Holly wanted should be  <br/>
the next purchase.  That couldn&#39;t have happened if the list was just  <br/>
on a computer somewhere.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041720324">Hi Tamara,<br/>
My 4.5 year old DD is going through this right now, and her need to buy things is quite intense. Her desire is &quot;to buy something&quot; and not usually related to any particular thing...she just wants to go to the store and shop. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;The problem we&#39;re having is that our daughter seems to have no sense of evaluating how badly she wants something.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe your daughter is craving the experience of shopping, looking at all the different things, touching them, thinking about them, deciding which thing she might desire more than another.  When she went to the store with her Dad, did she have enough time to really experience the shopping? If they went with the intended purpose of getting the craft kit, and she got swayed by something else, maybe she didn&#39;t have enough time in the store to really figure out what she wanted to buy.<br/>
<br/>
My girls LOVE to go shoe shopping. We go to Target, or Payless, or Kohls and they try on every shoe they want. We pull everything out they are interested in, try them on, walk around in them, look in the mirrors, and in the end they each decide after they&#39;ve had lots of time to figure it out, and they are generally so in love with their new shoes after that and so happily strut about showing them off to their friends and family for weeks afterward. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Quite frequently, if I ask her what it actually is that she&#39;s wanting (as in, what is in that box on the shelf), she has no idea, but she&#39;s going to scream until she gets it anyway.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is this during regular grocery store type trips? Can you involve her more in the shopping process so that she is able to make lots of choices while you are picking stuff up, and so she feels she has more say into your basic necessities?<br/>
<br/>
When we go to the grocery store, my 4.5 year old starts telling me she wants to buy something while we are driving to the store. I say, we will, because we are going to the store to buy a whole lot of things. And many of those things will be just for the kids--certain foods, snacks, etc. This is where choices and involving them in the shopping process has really helped, they are helping to stock our shelves, and choosing things they like to eat and use. I have found that if I have to rush into the store to get a couple things, my DD&#39;s desire to buy something is heightened--almost as if my lack of time increases her need to buy exponentially.  In those times, I choose our route accordingly--avoiding the toy aisle, and then being sure to ask if she would like some nail polish, gum, or candy as we check out. <br/>
<br/>
If the issue is about her feeling the lack of money, and possibly needing to buy something before it runs out, I second the dollar store idea...dollar stores, thrift stores, good will, garage sales, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Because we live about an hour away from the quality &quot;stuff&quot; stores (Target, Kohls, etc.) another thing that often helps both my girls when we are at home and they are needing to buy and shop is to look on the computer  or in the kid catalogues that come in the mail...they circle the pics in the catalogue and they come up with ideas when browsing through clothes and toys on the computer...it&#39;s another means for them to enjoy the experience of shopping. We can then  make a list for when finances are better, or we know that we&#39;ll be going to the bigger stores in a week or two.</div>

<br/>
This note isn&#39;t about Meredith, but about stranger I have seen in  <br/>
stores, and other parents I used to be friends with. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Some parents habitually say &quot;I don&#39;t have money for...&quot;<br/>
They say it all the time.<br/>
And the kids know that, so it becomes meaningless.   And I have heard,  <br/>
from people with liquor or cigarettes in their cart, &quot;I don&#39;t have  <br/>
money for candy,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t have money for toys.&quot;  And what it  <br/>
seemed to mean was &quot;My money is not intended for toys or candy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What the kids were learning was that the parent was selfish and  <br/>
dishonest.<br/>
I figured that out about my mom when I was very, very young.  Nothing  <br/>
she ever did in all those ensuing years redeemed her, because she  <br/>
continued to be that way her whole life.<br/>
<br/>
I could kind of understand it, as I got older.  I could justify it and  <br/>
explain it, but I couldn&#39;t feel loved from it, and I couldn&#39;t trust her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rosie was like this. I thought it would be MORE difficult to carry <br/>
something around in a store and then leave it at the checkout counter or <br/>
put it back on the shelf, but that seemed okay to her - she enjoyed the <br/>
carrying-it-around time.<br/>
<br/>
Rosie is 19 years old and when we go to a bookstore she gathers up a lot <br/>
of books - as many as 15 or more of them - and carries them around with <br/>
her. When it is time to leave, she picks out the one or two she&#39;s going <br/>
to buy out of that stack.<br/>
<br/>
The OP described dad taking the child to the store to buy a craft kit, <br/>
but also said they avoided taking her shopping whenever possible. That <br/>
seemed like a contradiction and my suggestion is to really not take her <br/>
anywhere that there is shopping for the next 6 months or so. Then give <br/>
it a try again.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she likes surprises - packages to open. My kids used to wrap up <br/>
things they already owned and pretend they were getting them as <br/>
presents. They also played &quot;store&quot; at home - maybe that would be a good <br/>
pretend game to play with her if it is the buying that is fun - she can <br/>
get some of that fun in pretend play. Get props - toy cash register, <br/>
play money - set up a store with toys and games and books you already <br/>
own. Maybe she&#39;d like to put price tags on them. You can shop and she <br/>
can be the cashier or vice versa. My girls played store a LOT.  They <br/>
also looked through catalogs a lot and talked and talked about the <br/>
things they wanted - they made lists, circled them in the catalogs, etc. <br/>
It was easier to use the American Girl Doll catalog to pick out one <br/>
thing than it was to stand in a toy store and pick out one thing.<br/>

If you give her pocket money occasionally, rather than allowance on a  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983639679"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;And if all the dad intended to or was willing to buy was that one  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>crafts kit, he should have gone (perhaps with the box of the old one,  or the name written down) and gotten it and come home.   It seems almost sadistic to me to take her somewhere and either let her  <br/>
experience the shopping or not; either way could be awful.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Indeed. If you know you need this one thing, send someone out to get it. Maybe sending her Dad off quietly, without a big discussion of it, if possible.<br/>
<br/>
Is it possible that if her Dad had been set on getting this one thing, and then your daughter is swayed by this other thing, maybe her Dad felt compelled to buy the new thing quickly and get out of the store so as to prevent her from being swayed by yet another thing?<br/>
<br/>
If you can do the shopping when she is not with you, and without making an issue of it, do.  I often go to the store really early in the morning when my girls are still asleep, or on my way home from work. They are as excited to help unload the groceries to see what I brought home as they are to pick stuff out at the store.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra mentioned this during her Unschooling Conference this past January and it REALLY made an impact on me:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Some parents habitually say &quot;I don&#39;t have money for...&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They say it all the time.<br/>
And the kids know that, so it becomes meaningless. And I have heard,<br/>
from people with liquor or cigarettes in their cart, &quot;I don&#39;t have<br/>
money for candy,&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t have money for toys.&quot; And what it<br/>
seemed to mean was &quot;My money is not intended for toys or candy.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I realized that I had been saying the same thing to my kids, even as we were buying a cart load of groceries. After hearing Sandra say that, I realized what a confusing message that had to be for my kids. Clearly if I was buying a cart load of food, I had money. Why wouldn&#39;t I have money for gum or cheap toys? I stopped saying that, and haven&#39;t said that to my daughters since. I spoke to my oldest about it, because I wanted to make sure she understood that I&#39;d realized my error.  She gets it; the other day when we were at the store my youngest picked out a hot pink brush and said, &quot;I want this,&quot; my oldest caught me before I said a word and said, &quot;What&#39;s more difficult Mom, trying to explain to her why you don&#39;t want to buy it, or spending the three dollars?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not to say that limited finances don&#39;t play into these decisions, and that&#39;s where shopping without her when you can might be helpful there.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-348815113">When Linnaea was about 7 we used to go swimming at a place that had gumball <br/>
machines filled with toys for about 20 pence a pop. She would ask for 20 pence <br/>
pieces for much of the time we were there, which got frustating, largely because <br/>
it was repeated over and over again. It helped a lot to just have the change to <br/>
give her when we got there so that she could decide what to do with it, how much <br/>
she wanted and so that I didn&#39;t feel so much like I was being nickeled and dimed <br/>
to death. A bunch of what she got were bouncy balls, we had lots of bouncy balls <br/>
for a long time, but they&#39;ve all proven valuable as cat and dog toys over the <br/>
years. I can remember being annoyed at the money being spent on occassion, but <br/>
what has been amazing has been the pleasure those 20 pence balls have added as <br/>
well as the real sense of richness that Linnaea has. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Others have pointed this out about their own children, but neither Linnaea nor <br/>
Simon are needy. Linnaea, particularly, but Simon in lesser ways, went through <br/>
periods of huge desire for things from stores. And it was easy to feel <br/>
frustrated, to feel poorer at the prospect of their need. David was very good at <br/>
being generous when I was tired or grumpy. I can remember once in Singapore <br/>
airport when he happily took Linnaea to buy a pair of lovely silk pajamas when I <br/>
couldn&#39;t face spending any more money. I&#39;m so glad he did. She really loved <br/>
those pajamas. But both of them now will turn things down more often than they <br/>
will accept them. I try, I offer and I ply them with things, but they don&#39;t want <br/>
what they don&#39;t want. It took a real sense of abudance for them to get to a <br/>
point of being so discerning. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I was a child, and into being an adult, I looked to things to fulfill me. I <br/>
was a marketer&#39;s dream. I figured if I looked right or if I had the right toys <br/>
or the right something I could be attractive enough or good enough or sucessful <br/>
enough or happy enough to do whatever it was that I felt needed to be done or <br/>
whatever it was. It is amazing to not see that in Simon and Linnaea. They like <br/>
what they like and they get what they want and then they are done with getting <br/>
stuff. They don&#39;t want the most expensive, they don&#39;t want the most impressive. <br/>
Heck, even the things they do want, like Xbox games or whatever, they will wait <br/>
for the price to go down or they will really research to make sure it is what <br/>
they want. I am so very impressed by them. And the only things that I can see <br/>
that made that difference was the freedom to buy things, the abundance that they <br/>
had and the support and love that David and I have given them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-378981202">One of the things which helped me say yes to spending more was to collect quarters for machines.  Every time I got change back I would put the quarters in a pocket in my camera case -because the camera is always with me- and whenever we came to games or candy/toy machines I always had lots of quarters to give.<br/>
<br/>
My kids especially liked that at birthday parties at pizza places with game machines....plenty of quarters to go around, and they shared, too, with the kids whose parents were saying no.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-798908388">My kids are all very different when it comes to spending and money and it does determine how much and when we go to the store.  One thing I think that has helped some is that I very seldom buy things for myself that I have to planned.  A few weeks ago I picked up a purse at target on clearance without planning to buy a purse but i dont dont do that often. My husband and I research and debate alot of purchases. When we go to the store therefore, whether it is for something for any of us we usually do it with a purpose.  Even if that purpose is to find something to buy with their christmas money.  Often my two youngest dont really have anything in mind, but my two older ones typically have things they want in mind.  And I try to warn them ahead of time if it isnt going to be possible this trip.  For example they really want a new video game that just came out but it is still 50 dollars.  We dont have the money, so I rented it for them this week for 6.  <br/>
If they really want to buy something though, money is burning a hole in their pocket or something, i take them to the dollar store or a garage sale.  I will say though that time has helped.  My 8 year old was interested in entering a tournament for taekwondo the other day. I said if he really wanted to I would sign him up.  He asked how much it was.  When I told him he responded, &quot;you know I really want a GOOD skateboard for my birthday, so I think I would rather you keep that money so you have enough to get a nice one.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231142570">-=-. A bunch of what she got were bouncy balls, we had lots of bouncy  <br/>
balls<br/>
for a long time, but they&#39;ve all proven valuable as cat and dog toys  <br/>
over the<br/>
years. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly did coin machines and bouncy balls.  She had an old jewelry box  <br/>
(one of the fancy-paper-covered cardboard ones made to look nicer than  <br/>
its materials) and the nicest bouncy balls were sorted into the  <br/>
drawers that might have held rings and bracelets.  The plainer ones  <br/>
went in the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Once we rented a helium tank and got some nice balloons, for a party  <br/>
here.  Holly had the idea of putting bouncy balls inside balloons, pre- <br/>
helium.  Then helium.  It would work with air, too, but that was HOURS  <br/>
of fun.  Serious fun.  You can hold the balloon and get the super ball  <br/>
spinning around inside it and then throw it.  It moves really  <br/>
erratically.  If it&#39;s helium, it moves around, and maybe up, very  <br/>
erratically.  Or they would get the ball bouncing up, and when it was  <br/>
at the apex, let go.  The balloon started up, then the ball&#39;s bump on  <br/>
the way down disturbed it, but it would still go up.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people have said, &quot;Well I don&#39;t get ideas like that.&quot;  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t either.  It took years for that idea to come to pass.  It took  <br/>
years of me letting Holly collect little super balls (and helping her,  <br/>
by not throwing them away if I found them, and making sure she had a  <br/>
good place to keep them).  It took being willing to see that a day of  <br/>
helium balloon play could be worth the $50 or whatever it cost us.  It  <br/>
took Holly having had people say &quot;Let&#39;s try it!&quot; or &quot;Sure, okay&quot; for  <br/>
years, rather than &quot;That&#39;s stupid,&quot; and &quot;Don&#39;t,&quot; and &quot;What are you  <br/>
DOING!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You need to start early with being sweet, generous, accepting, and  <br/>
gaining faith in learning itself and in the potential of your  <br/>
children&#39;s response to living in a rich and peaceful environment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They don&#39;t want the most expensive, they don&#39;t want the most  <br/>
impressive. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I heard Holly say to Marty and Ashlee (Marty&#39;s girlfriend)  <br/>
that she would like to go with them, to lunch with their friend Ben.   <br/>
She had overheard that they were going, and wanted an invitation.    <br/>
They said okay very nicely, and they all left.  I was picturing one of  <br/>
the several nice restaurants they know and like.   While they were  <br/>
still gone, Holly tweeted this:<br/>
<br/>
Taco Bell lunch with some of my favorite people. And mmmm Taco  <br/>
Bellllll. about 19 hours ago<br/>
<br/>
For anyone living where Taco Bell is an unknown, it&#39;s a very  <br/>
inexpensive taco and burrito chain that&#39;s been around since the  <br/>
1960&#39;s, mostly a drive-through, with small dining rooms that could be  <br/>
hosed down, they&#39;re so solidly plastic and metal.  About the only  <br/>
decorations are the logo and the paper bags.  It&#39;s probably the least  <br/>
expensive place in town, but Holly was as happy as could be.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  I went to confirm the 1960&#39;s; I was right.  But the founder, Glen  <br/>
Bell, died in January of this year!  He was in the Marines in WWII.<br/>
<br/>
You never know what will lead to other things... A child might be  <br/>
collecting what will become a life&#39;s work or interest.  Look at Kirby  <br/>
and video games, or Jayn Coburn and dolls!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310157693">I wanted to thank everyone for all the replies, and all the different <br/>
thoughts people had on my situation with my DD and spending.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading, and thinking, and reading again, and I think it&#39;s becoming a little <br/>
clearer with everyone&#39;s help.<br/>
<br/>
We went out to a bigger toystore with my sister a couple of days ago (she <br/>
was going to buy a slide, so we tagged along), and before we even left I <br/>
told DD we could spend a set amount of money.  I did agree that it could be <br/>
negotiable after she asked what if what she wanted was 50c more.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when we arrived, she immediately wanted a giant pony, but it was <br/>
more than the amount we&#39;d agreed, so she moved on, and found a unicorn <br/>
hobbyhorse which was the amount we&#39;d agreed on, so she wanted it.  Instead <br/>
of commenting, I helped her pick out one that worked (the played sounds), <br/>
and she gallopped around the store while we helped my sister pick out <br/>
slides.  Then she decided she didn&#39;t want the unicorn anymore, so we walked <br/>
back to take it back.  Next she found a big box of plastic toy food which <br/>
was just over what we&#39;d agreed on.  She carried it around for a while too, <br/>
and I said nothing, even though I was hoping she wouldn&#39;t choose it.  (My <br/>
opinon on how much use she&#39;d get out of it, which wasn&#39;t necessarily right). <br/>
She then settled on a plastic toy cake with velcro decorations, which I <br/>
actually thought was pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
She did get a little upset a couple of times saying she didn&#39;t know what to <br/>
choose, but with plenty of time and patience, she was able to make a really <br/>
good choice, and get something she&#39;s played with a lot since she got home.<br/>
<br/>
I think that perhaps a lot of the problems we&#39;ve been having with her <br/>
getting home and wishing she&#39;d bought something else is a combination of not <br/>
giving her enough time to make a choice, and putting too much of our own <br/>
evaluation on what she is buying, even if we&#39;re trying not to.  We want her <br/>
to be able to make her own choice, but often we do get too caught up in what <br/>
we think she should buy, and we&#39;re making that too obvious.  So she chooses <br/>
what she wants, but feels we&#39;re disapproving.  Definately going to work on <br/>
that one.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone for all your help.<br/>
<br/>
