<div id="ygrps-yiv-471855255">Hi Unschoolers,<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for about 4 yrs now after I pulled my children out of school and read <br/>
John Holt.  Since then, I&#39;ve noticed that when people ask me about WHAT I do at home, I try <br/>
to explain the philosophy of child led learning, etc.  I have noticed that most of my &quot;friends&quot; <br/>
avoid me, my children&#39;s friends from school definitely do.<br/>
Because we live in San Jose and don&#39;t want to travel an hour north, have not really found a <br/>
support group or friendly, accepting people.  Has anyone had the same experience?  and if <br/>
so, do you have any ideas?<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize how lonely and isolated I would feel.  I mean we go out into society and do <br/>
things and meet people but just don&#39;t seem to make lasting connections.<br/>

Maybe just say &quot;we&#39;re  homeschooling.&quot;  If they ask for details say  <br/>
it&#39;s different different days, or you go to museums, or something  <br/>
happy and perky and vague.<br/>

When my kids were that age they hung out at a gaming store.  It was  <br/>
the height of Pokemon card tournaments, and they had friends from that.<br/>
<br/>
What about clubs based on interests, or doing overnight visits to  <br/>
other unschooling families?  What about state-organization sponsored  <br/>
camping trips?  (I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re already hooked up with HSC, but  <br/>
if not, HSC.org.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2052830712">Living in Los Angeles, that big spread out endless plain of cities and <br/>
suburbs, driving an hour doesn&#39;t sound like much to me. We do it all the <br/>
time to visit Jayn&#39;s special friends who live north and south, just as they <br/>
come to us sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Personally knowing some of the lovely unschooling families who live in the <br/>
Bay area, all I can say is that doing that kind of drive once or twice week <br/>
would be totally worth it!<br/>
<br/>
Try posting at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:westernregionunschoolers@yahoogroups.com">westernregionunschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a> to find some folks <br/>
closer to you maybe.<br/>
<br/>
When people ask me what we do, I tell them about our activities (play games, <br/>
read, watch tv, sew and craft, write stories, draw, outings) and Jayn&#39;s <br/>
passions (dolls, mysteries, computer games, dance, swimming). I can be <br/>
brief, or talk longer if needed. I can talk longer than anyone would want to <br/>
listen about all the stuff we can do. I don&#39;t even try and make it sound <br/>
like schooly subjects. One of the points about unschooling is that our days <br/>
don&#39;t look like school-at-home, so I don&#39;t try and give that impression even <br/>
when I know that people mean &quot;what do you do for school&quot; when they ask &quot;what <br/>
do you do&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1761401721">I&#39;d say stick with the &quot;we&#39;re homeschoolers&quot; response and leave it at<br/>
that.  Only elaborate if you feel comfortable.  I&#39;ve had that &quot;oh&quot;<br/>
reaction a couple of times and it&#39;s a crummy feeling, isn&#39;t it!?  I have<br/>
found, though, that most people are understanding when you say &quot;it just<br/>
works for us&quot; and smile and then proceed to ask how school is going for<br/>
them, does their kid like their teacher this year, have they gone on any<br/>
exciting field trips, blah blah blah. :-)  My daughter did receive some<br/>
crummy treatment just this last year (she&#39;s 9) from some of the kids in<br/>
the neighborhood but they just really were jealous of her, didn&#39;t know<br/>
where to &#39;put&#39; her in their little worlds, and were belittling her<br/>
because they felt poorly about themselves (low self-esteem).  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t bother with these kids, now.  Others in the neighborhood are<br/>
more accepting and just want to get down to the business of playing!<br/>
 <br/>
Are you just looking for an unschooling group, specifically or would a<br/>
group of homeschoolers suffice?  We have a couple of schooled friends in<br/>
the neighborhood and at ballet class, some unschooled friends, and some<br/>
homeschooled (school-at-home) friends.  I think what helps is to go<br/>
after interests.  My girls like to ride horses, take ballet, bowl with a<br/>
homeschool group (small), play at the park, attend a cool science class<br/>
once a month at an environmental research center, arrange playdates, go<br/>
to a homeschool P.E. class, go to a homeschool open gym at a gymnastics<br/>
place, etc.  I might get to talking with a mom or they might come out<br/>
from the activity and say &quot;Can you talk to so-and-so&#39;s mom and arrange a<br/>
playdate for us?&quot;.  Now, my elder gal is the extrovert while my younger<br/>
is the introvert, so I find a difference in how many friends they want<br/>
and want to play with at a time.  <br/>
 <br/>
Join some local Yahoo groups and homeschool groups and post about<br/>
getting together based on interest and/or age.  Keep at it, it will<br/>
click!<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I find that just having certain activities on certain days each<br/>
week is really helpful.  The girls know that Monday we might go ice<br/>
skating (just us! :-)), Tuesday is riding, Wed. is open gym and later<br/>
ballet, Thursday is riding again, Friday I babysit three unschooled boys<br/>
(brothers) and we all go to the homeschool P.E. class in the winter and<br/>
the park in the warmer months.  We usually fit in playdates before or<br/>
after these activities or just lay low at home until it&#39;s time for the<br/>
activity (or run errands!).  If $ is a concern, park days are free and<br/>
even just two activities a week can be a real boost and a way to meet<br/>
others.<br/>
 <br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
~Melissa :-)<br/>

Have you joined the SFBUN group on yahoo?  That&#39;s short for San Francisco Bay Area <br/>
Unschooling Network.  I&#39;m from the other end of the bay area, and we do travel an hour to <br/>
make connections with this amazing group, but there are members from all over.  I&#39;d <br/>
recommend joining, posting, and seeing if anyone from your area responds.  We have <br/>
members from as far away as the Santa Cruz area.<br/>

We also do events in different locations, including an excellent campout in July at Caswell <br/>

 </span></blockquote>With more and more homeschooling families doing homeschool charter<br/>
programs in CA, I think it&#39;s harder for the actual stay at home<br/>
homeschoolers to find and meet like minded others.<br/>
<br/>
We have friends in the Modesto area that definitely run into this!  They<br/>
finally conceded and enrolled their daughter in a homeschool charter<br/>
after looking for 6 mos for ANY homeschoolers at all.  Even though this<br/>
family has lived in CA off and on over the course of their daughter&#39;s<br/>
life, and they homeschooled most of it, they didn&#39;t even know about the<br/>
private schooling option for registering.  I think that is probably the<br/>
case for a lot of people, especially those that leave the public school<br/>
system, who get their information form the schools that say they must<br/>
enroll in a homeschool charter.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are homeschoolers in the bay area though, so I&#39;d say keep<br/>
looking and be open to driving.  The older your kids get, the more<br/>
important it will be to have other kids to hang out with and do things<br/>
with!<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered going to the Life Is Good Conference<br/>

than a few from CA.  It&#39;s been very instrumental in finding friends for<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596778312">I second what Johanna said about joining SFBUN, and I know that one<br/>
unschooler is/or used to be part of some group down your way called<br/>
Parkhoppers or something.  I found the link!: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parkhoppers.org/">http://www.parkhoppers.org/</a> When<br/>
I used to live in Santa Clara about 10 years ago I was part of a group<br/>
called All Ways Learning, and they seemed rather snooty toward non-<br/>
unschoolers at the time.  I cannot find that link.  Prehaps the group is<br/>
gone.<br/>
There are also a lot of unschoolers taking nature studies classes at Riekes<br/>
in Menlo park: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.riekes.org/">http://www.riekes.org/</a><br/>
If you don&#39;t mind traveling a lot of unschoolers go to the SFhomeschoolers(<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sfhomeschoolers.org/)">http://www.sfhomeschoolers.org/)</a> Parkday on Mondays.  We go there even<br/>
though we live in Alameda.<br/>
Besides the regular activities of SFBUN(or BUNnies) on Thursdays, there is<br/>
also a regular Friday hike in the East Bay that is set up by an unschooler<br/>
which has many unschooling regulars, but I do not know what theory the<br/>
majority follow.<br/>
If you are interested in the hike, email me and I will pass your address on<br/>
to the organizer of the list.<br/>
Hope to see you around!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057318176">Christine,<br/>
I&#39;m new to this list, but I want you to know that I understand.  I&#39;ve hs-d my children for 8 years - my dd is 15 and my ds is 11.  My dd went to school until 1st grade and my son has never been.  We&#39;ve done the &quot;traditional&quot; hs things up until a few months ago.  We&#39;re a military family and we were stationed in Washington state before here (We&#39;re now in Naples, Italy - don&#39;t hate).  I was incredibly active with our hs group in Washington.  I taught some classes with our group, went to trips together, we were all best friends and were at each other&#39;s houses almost weekly - if not a few times/week.  We moved to Italy and decided to change things up.  The hs group here is &quot;okay&quot;.  They&#39;re not that active except to meet once/week for PE.  I was somewhat friendly with a few of the parents before but now not so much.  I was in touch with many of the moms from Washington for a while, too, but not anymore.  What happened?  Well, I&#39;d like to say it&#39;s NOT because I now unschool, but I can&#39;t be so sure.  We are here, in a foreign country where we&#39;re learning, but don&#39;t speak the language, and have no one that has the same hs philosphy as we do.  When the HS group here does get together, of course the conversation goes to &quot;what curriculum do you use?&quot;, &quot;we did &#39;x&#39; amount of pages in our book today!&quot;, or some magnificent project they&#39;re kids are working on with children form all over the globe, LOL!  It&#39;s alright.  I&#39;m closer to my kids now than I have EVER been and they&#39;re happier than I&#39;ve ever seen them.  It&#39;s worth the trade-off to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1300599351">In addition to HSC conference (I too consider it mostly unschoolers--at least all the<br/>
folks that I hang out with I guess!) I would recommend attending the HSC campouts.<br/>
We have about 6-7 a year and the core group are unschoolers (some SF bunnies<br/>
and some of us SoCA).  The next campout is Camp Krem in about a week or so<br/>
and its full.  The next is in March at Joshua Tree and the info is going to be posted<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, our family has experienced the same thing.  I got some advice <br/>
from this list that if we just followed our own interests to keep us <br/>
happy and occupied, friends would likely just happen.  We didn&#39;t do <br/>
well when we were going out just to meet people.  We had very little in <br/>
common with the people we met.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, my dd10, Allie, is enrolled in several classes of interest that <br/>
are keeping her happy.  She isn&#39;t making friends really but the <br/>
activities are keeping her happy.  I hang out with her the rest of the <br/>
time.  When we get bored, we go find something to do. It sounds <br/>
simplistic but the key for us was finding happiness by ourselves.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I heartily agree with this.  Unfortunately, families following attachment parenting and <br/>
unschooling are in the minority. (Why is this the case? Robin Grille&#39;s book Parenting for a <br/>
Peaceful World offers one theory, that parenting through the ages is slowly evolving from the <br/>
utterly barbaric to an authoritarian mode to an attachment mode- most of western society is <br/>
currently in the authoritarian mode). I sometimes feel isolated too, but I&#39;ve learned to keep <br/>
my focus on my own family, to enjoy the contact we have with other families and friends, but <br/>
not to look for too much in the way of guidance from them.  For wonderful role models and <br/>
sharing of ideas I come here!  I really admire Sandra&#39;s modus operandi - to keep on chipping <br/>
away at the huge edifice of conventional parenting and schooling, to keep on demonstrating <br/>
that there is an alternative that puts your relationship with your child front and centre.</div>

<br/>
Thanks.   Helping people find options and little tweaks that will  <br/>
make their children&#39;s lives happier seems to be my life&#39;s work after  <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
Kids have grown up on ranches and science stations (Sunspot, New  <br/>
Mexico) and pioneers of various sorts and missionaries have survived  <br/>
for years in relative isolation and some of their kids did  <br/>
wonderfully well.  Maybe all, but I can&#39;t say.  Probably  most, I can  <br/>
guess.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I&#39;m happy to do is to help my adult childless friends  <br/>
be more at ease in a world of ideas and experiences.  Too many people  <br/>
(because of school and authoritative parenting, perhaps?) become  <br/>
calcified into acting as they&#39;re supposed to act, into &quot;acting their  <br/>
age&quot; and becoming inflexible rejecters of the joys around them.  They  <br/>
don&#39;t look for beauty or humor and they insult those who do.  So I do  <br/>
my little guerilla peace-and-joy bits and sometimes cause a rift in  <br/>
their space and time.  That&#39;s all. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Deborah Cunefare brought a link to one of my Thinking Sticks blogs  <br/>
just this morning which has me enthusiastic.  I&#39;ve already bought a  <br/>
copy of the book, and am thinking about things around my house I  <br/>
should photograph and make available for others to see and comment  <br/>
on.  Maybe I can learn more about some of my favorite tools and  <br/>
containers.<br/>

<br/>
(we have both of those pickups, by the way, and they run, too)<br/>
<br/>
No one needs to be isolated from the world of ideas and music and  <br/>
art, if they have books, a computer, or a hiking stick and some good  <br/>
shoes.  It just take looking in a different way.<br/>

<br/>
I think extended families and villages are more common than nuclear  <br/>
families.  The pioneer stories aren&#39;t my favorites, I&#39;m just sayin&#39;  <br/>
people find things to do and they still can learn even in the absence  <br/>
of cities and libraries and museums.  People who feel isolated aren&#39;t  <br/>
isolated from opportunities to do, see and learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056525652">Probably humans have largely hung out in nuclear families within an extended kin group within a larger group for much of human prehistory. So, if you picture humans in a longhouse or whatever big weather-protective, community shelter, the mom, dad, and kids are all together with grandma and grandpa and aunts and uncles as you move down the row to inlaws or less related individuals. Of course pre-agriculture is 10,000 years ago. Serious change in a species has been shown to occur in 40 generations, so if you assume 25 years for a generation (birth to reproductive) it is arguable that humans have changed from pre-agricultural adaptations to post-agricultural adaptations, 10 times over. If living away from family, farming your own patch and living nearer to it, gave you better returns and lower mortality and higher reproductive rates, than moving from extended kin longhouses to more isolated households is certainly going to be selected for. We moved, at a<br/>
 rush, from the country to the city. We seriously believed that the city was going to give us a better return than the country was. Moving from the country moved us away from our extended kin networks. We moved to isolation. Of course we often took our cultural identities with us, the food we loved, moved to the neighborhoods that was most filled with folks from our part of the world, the clothes we wore. We like to be a part of a group. I assume because being a part of a group gives us an advantage over being all by ourselves. <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m no help whatsoever. <br/>
<br/>
I read Sandra&#39;s response first. My mom sends me these fantastic diaries from women, often teachers to start, who lived in Minnesota and South Dakota in the 1800&#39;s and life was really fairly social then. I think I am stuck in an Old Jules view of the early settlers that makes me think it is all like the Mosquito Coast . <br/>
