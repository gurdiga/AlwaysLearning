<div id="ygrps-yiv-667905771">Is this the list where someone introduced us to the poop-movie-title game?  <br/>
We  had fun with that for a week here. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I had seen before, and thought maybe there&#39;s someone on this <br/>
list for whom it would be new, or some who might just appreciate the smile <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
25 Lines From Star Wars That Can Be Improved if you substitute the word<br/>
&quot;Pants&quot;<br/>
<br/>
1. A tremor in the pants. The last time I felt this was in the presence of<br/>
my old master.<br/>
<br/>
2. You are unwise to lower your pants. <br/>
<br/>
3. We&#39;ve got to be able to get some reading on those pants, up or down. <br/>
<br/>
4. She must have hidden the plans in her pants. Send a detachment down to<br/>
retrieve them. See to it personally Commander. <br/>
<br/>
5. These pants may not look like much, kid, but they&#39;ve got it where it<br/>
counts. <br/>
<br/>
6. I find your lack of pants disturbing. <br/>
<br/>
7. These pants contain the ultimate power in the Universe. I suggest we<br/>
use it. <br/>
<br/>
8. Han will have those pants down.  We&#39;ve got to give him more time! <br/>
<br/>
9. General Veers, prepare your pants for a surface assault. <br/>
<br/>
10. I used to bulls-eye womp-rats in my pants back home. <br/>
<br/>
11. TK-421. . . Why aren&#39;t you in your pants? <br/>
<br/>
12. Lock the door. And hope they don&#39;t have pants. <br/>
<br/>
13. Governor Tarkin. I recognized your foul pants when I was brought on<br/>
board. <br/>
<br/>
14. You look strong enough to pull the pants off of a Gundark. <br/>
<br/>
15. Luke. . . Help me take...these pants off. <br/>
<br/>
16. Great, Chewie, great. Always thinking with your pants. <br/>
<br/>
17. That blast came from those pants. That thing&#39;s operational! <br/>
<br/>
18. Don&#39;t worry. Chewie and I have gotten into a lot of pants more heavily<br/>
guarded than this. <br/>
<br/>
19. Maybe you&#39;d like it back in your pants, your highness. <br/>
<br/>
20. Your pants betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Esof an <br/>
Imperial Cruiser. <br/>
<br/>
22. Yeah, well short pants is better than no pants at all, Chewie. <br/>
<br/>
23. Attention. This is Lando Calrissean. The Empire has taken control of<br/>
my pants, I advise everyone to leave before more troops arrive. <br/>
<br/>
24. I cannot teach him. The boy has no pants. <br/>
<br/>
25. You came in those pants? You&#39;re braver than I thought.</div>

<br/>
The pants will be with you, always.<br/>
<br/>
We should go for the strongest power source.  It should be the pants<br/>
generator!<br/>
<br/>
Imperial pants are heading towards the ion cannon!  Stop them!<br/>
<br/>
The pants are strong with this one.<br/>
<br/>
Luke, I am your pants.   (Noooooo!)<br/>

Actually, he won&#39;t let me near the GameCube without ridiculing and shaming<br/>
me.  I&#39;ll be videogame-deficient for life, and it&#39;s all my (home)school&#39;s<br/>
fault!  My kids won&#39;t even let me hold the cable remote or use the vcr or<br/>
dvd player.  I&#39;ve never had enough time to fool with them to learn how;<br/>
every time we need to record or play something, they grab the remote from<br/>
me.  I just hand it over now.<br/>
<br/>
When Alex teased me about my utter absence of video game skills, I kidded<br/>
him about being HRD -- Horseback Riding Deficient.  He said &quot;But I&#39;m not<br/>
interested in horses!&quot;  Point to mom.  &lt;g&gt;  My interest in video gaming<br/>
extends to watching the others play and congratulating them appropriately.<br/>

Oh HUH!<br/>
<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
Here are the DVDs I have rented and should watch so I can send them back:<br/>
<br/>
Beyond Enemy Poop<br/>
The Royal Poops<br/>
Pooplander<br/>
<br/>
and earlier this week, being in bed, I have watched<br/>
Pooply Ballroom (or Strictly Poop)<br/>
Dave (which has nothing to add Poop to)<br/>
Peacekeeper (ditto)<br/>
Stargate (boring)<br/>
Armageddon<br/>
<br/>
And I am getting bored.<br/>
<br/>
Today I walked on my foot the right way for the first time in a week and a <br/>
half.  I rolled from my heel to my toes (not every time, but sometimes).  I <br/>
went up stairs with one foot on each stair instead of both feet and crutches <br/>
on each stair.   <br/>
<br/>
So I guess that means I can take myself to Walgreen&#39;s (because my van is an <br/>
automatic) and buy a cane with a good rubber foot, and I can take myself to <br/>
Hollywood video and rent some more movies.<br/>
