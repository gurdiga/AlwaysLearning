<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594982298">Hey Sandra,<br/>
 <br/>
I just read your Art, Aging and Spirituality article on your website<br/>
where you mention the Goodwill on Central.  You wrote: <br/>
 <br/>
&quot;In 1970 I lived in Hokona Zia dorm, at UNM. I was 17 whole years old,<br/>
and had my mom&#39;s old 1952 Singer portable sewing machine. India-print<br/>
bedspreads were $4 and $5 each at Gold Street Circus, a hippie shop that<br/>
wasn&#39;t on Gold Street, but on Central across from Hodgin Hall. (Now it&#39;s<br/>
the west end of Bike World.) Up Central at Wellesley, where a restaurant<br/>
named Kelly&#39;s lately opened, there was a Goodwill. It had been a car<br/>
dealership way before I was born. You could still tell by the building<br/>
where the office, the repair shop, and the showroom had been.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
We used to shop at that Goodwill when I was a little girl!   I never<br/>
knew it had been a car dealership.  It&#39;s fun to think back and remember<br/>
the shop and realize that indeed it did look like a car dealership.  I<br/>
can still remember the smell!  Thinking of that store reminded me that<br/>
my mom bought a bike for me there - my first two-wheeler and I loved<br/>
that bike.  It was probably about 1970 so we might have even crossed<br/>
paths!  Lots more memories ran into that one, so I just wanted to thank<br/>
you for triggering those fond recollections and giving me a bit of<br/>
history from my childhood.   It&#39;s a small world, indeed!<br/>
 <br/>
Reminiscing and appreciating, <br/>
Sunday<br/>

<br/>
I remember right where they used to put the bikes!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really glad someone read that who knew the places!  It was first  <br/>
written for Enchanted Famiies, a local publication, so naming places  <br/>
near UNM made way  more sense then than when it&#39;s out in the wider  <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for that note.  It was fun.<br/>
<br/>
Holly sometimes wears a polka-dot dress I bought there for $1 in 1972  <br/>
or so, and I&#39;ve copied that pattern several times, from having that  <br/>
dress.  It was just a traditional pattern with a square faced yoke  <br/>
and the sleeves and body gathered into it.  It looks kinda like an  <br/>
old Wonder Bread bag. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
