<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317404455">-=-The grandparents are very impressed with my daughter and they always<br/>
praise her in family reunions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
So they helped create the problem, and they&#39;re not paying much attention while they babysit.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The cousin bumps into my daughter &quot;accidently&quot;, yells at her,<br/>
rejects her and talks to her in a condescending manner. They take a<br/>
karate class together. In the class the cousin kicked my daughter very<br/>
hard. Now my daughter is intimidated by her cousin. She gets stomach<br/>
pains when she sees her cousin.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does she yell &quot;STOP IT&quot; as loudly as she can?<br/>
In the karate class did she say &quot;DON&#39;T KICK ME&quot; full voice?<br/>
If she&#39;s accepting these things passively, she&#39;s feeding the situation, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My husband talked to his brother and his brother&#39;s wife about this<br/>
situation.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well if they don&#39;t know how to help, you and your husband and your daughter should deal with the cousin directly.  <br/>
<br/>
But they won&#39;t be the ages they are for very long.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My husband and I have been bullied by his own brother and his<br/>
brother&#39;s wife. They are aggressive people. They provoke us and<br/>
when we react to them they accuse us of attacking them. I hardly talk to<br/>
them anymore because of this.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then you pretty much knew that leaving the girls together was asking for trouble.<br/>
<br/>
-=Now the grandparents only babysit my daughter in the afternoon while I<br/>
am at work. The damage has been done. What can I do to help my<br/>
daughter?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You mean the cousin isn&#39;t there anymore?  <br/>
Then if you move her to a different karate class, the immediate problem is solved.  <br/>
<br/>
At family reunions or holidays, hang out with her or where you can see her, and the second you see the cousin gaze at her in that thoughtful-bully way, move closer.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What would you do if you weren&#39;t related to your babysitter and the other &quot;sat&quot; child? That&#39;s an important question. Sometimes and ideal of &quot;family&quot; can seem so important that parents will overlook children&#39;s needs in the moment for that ideal, but the sad fact is that &quot;family&quot; more often protects bullies than the bullied. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What can I do to help my<br/>
&gt; daughter?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does she want to do? If she&#39;s having stomach pains, she may be happiest if she can avoid him for awhile, so help her do that. Find another childcare option so she&#39;s not stuck in a situation where she can&#39;t get help and she&#39;s being made miserable. <br/>
<br/>
Find her another karate class, maybe an all-girl class or a women&#39;s self-defense class - because she doesn&#39;t need katas right now, she needs to know how to take a boy down who&#39;s giving her trouble. Or, if she likes martial arts in general but doesn&#39;t care what, shop around to different styles and also things like sword-fighting.<br/>
<br/>
Make other friends - people you can rely on not to make you feel cruddy or be mean to your daughter. Family can be a trap which keeps you from the world. See this as an opportunity to expand your world, rather than keeping it confined to what and who you know. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>***************<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean showing that she&#39;s intimidated? My experience with bullies is that avoiding them actually knocks some of the wind out of their sails, at least temporarily - it will take that person time to find another target and build up again. He won&#39;t feel a &quot;win&quot; because bullying is a defense mechanism to make him feel better about himself. And if he chose your daughter because she&#39;s related, that will slow him down in terms of acquiring a new target, maybe even prevent him from doing so.<br/>
<br/>
If you daughter goes away entirely or goes away for awhile and comes back with more skills, she&#39;s in a better situation than if she stays. Staying in a situation with a bully most likely means she&#39;d continued to be bullied unless the bully slips up and hurts her badly enough to get kicked out of the class - which isn&#39;t either likely or something to hope for. A kid picking on his cousin is the sort of thing teachers will ignore all the harder Because of the family ties - they don&#39;t want to be in the middle of a situation which could very well have started with the parents (like this one!).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She wants to attend a 1-week sleep over karate camp. She would skip a belt and that would put her at the same belt level with her mean cousin. She thinks that would give her confidence.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****************<br/>
<br/>
Confidence is good, but she shouldn&#39;t feel like she has to go back to the same class if there are others available. If you&#39;re telling her things like &quot;you can&#39;t let him intimidate you into leaving&quot; then stop - those messages are feeding into the situation and setting her up to get hurt. Some types of conflict are Best handled by avoidance because there&#39;s no &quot;once and for all&quot; solution - the other person&#39;s needs are such that he or she will keep picking and picking and picking. <br/>
