<div id="ygrps-yiv-713066394">-=-This way, the IDEA is being discussed rather than the terminology. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I doubt the terminology&#39;s feelings would be hurt.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of using more positive phrasing and being supportive instead of <br/>
using negative terms IS an idea.  Once in a while a good example (or bad example) <br/>
comes by on its own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think it&#39;s important to recognize that some words may be viewed as <br/>
negative by some but as benign or merely descriptive by others. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No one here can make you change your behavior and language choices, but I <br/>
think if anyone believes a phrase is toward the less-supportive, less-respectful <br/>
side of the MANY choices parents have, this list is a great place to point <br/>
that out.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think it would be a good idea if we decided to take it for granted that <br/>
the members of this list are all dedicated to providing a loving, <br/>
coercion-free learning environment for their children-=-<br/>
<br/>
Pushy me.  It&#39;s my list, and I think the best idea is to assume everyone here <br/>
wants to get nearer to what will make unschooling work as well as it can.<br/>
<br/>
-=-With that in mind, it is unlikely that anyone posting here is thinking <br/>
negatively of their children, but may use light-hearted phrasing in order to <br/>
express concerns that are very serious for them. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Anyone choosing to write down and then post negative phrasing will likely get <br/>
feedback that negative phrasing doesn&#39;t help unschooling, doesn&#39;t help the <br/>
child, and doesn&#39;t help the parent.<br/>
<br/>
A while back Marty had said something tacky about another kid.  The kid <br/>
wasn&#39;t there, and Marty said he wouldn&#39;t say it around him.  But as it was <br/>
something that other boy really, truly couldn&#39;t change about himself, I suggested <br/>
gently to Marty that even when his negativity wasn&#39;t known to the other&#39;ve been if <br/>
he hadn&#39;t said it.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are things that can be said humorously IF everyone involved is <br/>
aware of the humor and if the relationship is SO sweet and strong and positive <br/>
that a &quot;psychotic&quot; or &quot;insane&quot; or &quot;crazy&quot; won&#39;t harm the child in any way, and <br/>
the child will know deeply that it&#39;s a joke.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know that about the children of people here.  If it&#39;s true, you <br/>
don&#39;t need to convince us, you already know it.  If you&#39;re not sure whether it&#39;s <br/>
true, it shouldn&#39;t hurt you the mom to consider choosing kinder words.<br/>

<br/>
The percentage of parents in this country who don&#39;t coerce their kids, even when they are hard-to-understand toddlers is really really low.  So, sometimes, the coercion-free assumption would be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
How about assuming that if someone flags a remark as sounding too negative, know that you have a chance to explain that you meant it humorously.  Humorous remarks that contain put-downs probably should be examined, though.  It&#39;s really easy to get in the habit of repeating negative thoughts, and sometimes exaggerated negative thoughts.  Removing exaggeration and &quot;cutting a problem down to size&quot;, that is it&#39;s realistic size, is usually a helpful starting point in dealing with a problem.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And even if the sweet and totally joking context is true of the original<br/>
poster, that environment and understanding doesn&#39;t travel with the negative<br/>
words as they spread out to everyone reading and joining into the<br/>
conversation. The words create an atmosphere of negative thought on the<br/>
list. The use of the words suggests that it&#39;s okay to think negative<br/>
thougths about kids and this list is a good place to vent those pent up<br/>
frustrations.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much more useful for the list to discuss ways parents can turn their<br/>
thinking around so they aren&#39;t thinking of their children in those negative<br/>
ways and aren&#39;t building up pent up frustrations that needed vented<br/>
somewhere.<br/>
