<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991136223">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I had some more questions come to mind as I come to grasp unschooling <br/>
and try to imagine how it fits in with the rest of my life.<br/>
<br/>
First I was thinking about how it fits in with a religious lifestlye. <br/>
I guess my question mostly is for people who consider themselves <br/>
radical unschoolers and who may be religious also. I&#39;m guessing that <br/>
you apply the same principles to your religion that you would to <br/>
learning in other areas -- make it accessible to your children but <br/>
not mandatory? I am Catholic and actually converted from <br/>
Protestantism. I am also thinking about my wedding vows and how my <br/>
husband and I made a promise to raise our kids in the Catholic <br/>
church. Personally, I am really drawn to the ideas of unschooling <br/>
because they make so much sense to me. I mean just because someone is <br/>
forced to go to church or mass every week and go through all the <br/>
rituals does not mean that they will truly embrace the religion. If <br/>
any of you have any input from experience, I would really appreciate <br/>
it. (I notice that I am kind of answering my own questions as I go <br/>
often, but it is nice to work these ideas out. And I like hearing <br/>
different perspectives/stories).<br/>
<br/>
Second, I have been thinking about how unschooling works with the <br/>
whole idea of working Mothers. I have been home with my DD since she <br/>
was born and don&#39;t intend to return to work (ironically I am a <br/>
teacher by training!) any time soon. However, one question that <br/>
definitely comes to my mind is how &quot;women&#39;s rights&quot;/mother&#39;s needs <br/>
fit into unschooling. I know that sometimes the Dad is home with the <br/>
kids, but am under the impression that many time it is Mom. How do <br/>
you all balance your own interests with unschooling your children? I <br/>
imagine that with unschooling you have much more freedom than people <br/>
who homeschool and try to follow a curriculum... anyways, I&#39;m not <br/>
sure that I&#39;m clearly putting my thoughts into words. I would love to <br/>
hear from people how they balance their own work/hobbies etc. And <br/>
also I&#39;m curious how many of you feel philisophically that it IS best <br/>
if one parent is able to be home with their children (as opposed to 2 <br/>
working parent homes.)<br/>

called A Love Divided (see details below).  Perhaps it would be <br/>
interesting to you.  I thought it was great!!  Laurie<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A love divided [videorecording] / a Parallel Films production ; a <br/>
film by Sydney Macartney ; directed by Sydney Macartney ; produced <br/>
by Alan Moloney, Tim Palmer & Gerry Gregg ; written by Stuart <br/>
Hepburn. Publisher New York, NY : New Yorker Video, [2002] <br/>
 <br/>
Originally released as a motion picture in 1999. <br/>
Peter Caffrey, Liam Cunningham, Orla Brady, Tony Doyle. <br/>
Unrated. <br/>
<br/>
Based on a true incident in County Wexford, Ireland, this film tells <br/>
how one family&#39;s problem in dealing with a religious decision swept <br/>
up first a town, and then a country. Sean and Sheila Cloney (played <br/>
by Liam Cunningham and Orla Brady) are Catholic and Protestant. In <br/>
order to marry in the Catholic church in Ireland, Sheila signs the <br/>
required Ne Temere pledge that she will raise any children from the <br/>
marriage as Catholics. She honors this pledge for a long time as her <br/>
little girls part to go to Mass with their father on Sundays while <br/>
she goes to services with her father and sister. However, she draws <br/>
the line when the local parish priest, Father Stafford (Tony Doyle), <br/>
insists on her oldest daughter going to the Catholic school without <br/>
any regard for the idea that the parents have the right to make this <br/>
dicision. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203275158">The religion question is something Im struggling with just a bit. <br/>
   <br/>
  Dh and I were both drug to catholic church our childhood lives and have both chosen not to be catholic. After not stepping foot in a church of any kind in years he decided to start having the missionaries come over. It started out as &quot; Im curious about the mormon church and think i want to learn more about it &quot; and has turned into I think maybe i like these mormon people. <br/>
   <br/>
  So tomorrow we are going to visit their church. My oldest is 8 so they cannot stay home by themselves. I talked with them a bit about going tomorrow and what it might be like. Im bringing my little laptop with ear phones. My 8 year old can choose to sit outside and play on the laptop or come in the sacrament meeting with us.most likely a little of both. My 4 year old wants to bring her bear and color and coloring books and Im packing a few quiet toy for my son and a few snacks. <br/>
   <br/>
  I expect at least one to get antsy and want to go out . Well go walking, maybe out to the van and eat a snack. <br/>
   <br/>
  It can be frustrating to not get to hear most of the service but i think thats part of having kids. Mom and dad can trade off taking kids out. A wednesday service or religious study may be a possibility . There are also chat rooms, forums, etc on the net for religious discussion. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-177381684">Hi Susan,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll share my experiences. I was at one time a single<br/>
parent working upwards of 80 hours per week as a<br/>
pediatric resident, and I unschooled. The main issue<br/>
to overcome for me was how to keep my kid out of an<br/>
institution while I worked. I did this by lucking out<br/>
really and finding a wonderful live-in nanny who cared<br/>
for my son while I worked. She did everything from tag<br/>
along with him to the library, get him to bed and up<br/>
when necessary, supervised playdates, pretty much<br/>
everything I wasn&#39;t there to do. I have always been<br/>
flexible with sleep, etc, so having my kid stay up<br/>
late and sleep in was no big deal, which enhanced the<br/>
amount of time we spent together. It wasn&#39;t easy, and<br/>
honestly wasn&#39;t even my ideal, but it worked out for<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d had my wish, I would have had a supportive<br/>
partner at the time or extended family to help out.<br/>
That wasn&#39;t the case then, so I had to get creative<br/>
and stay flexible.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I&#39;m the working mom and my partner is the stay at<br/>
home mom. We both really want one of us to always be<br/>
with our kids, and we share educaional philosphy, so<br/>
this makes life pretty ideal for us in this regard. I<br/>
do feel like I miss out on quite a bit while I&#39;m at<br/>
work, even though I limit my hours; but I absolutely<br/>
love my  work. It&#39;s more of a mission for me. Heck<br/>
even some of our vacations are spent in places where I<br/>
do my job on a volunteer basis. <br/>
<br/>
As for what is best philosphically speaking...I can<br/>
say that it would certainly be ideal if a family <br/>
could survive in this age as a family unit without one<br/>
or both parents having to separate themselves from the<br/>
family to work. Heck, even most of the family farmers<br/>
back where I grew up have to work off the farm to<br/>
survive! It&#39;s just sad that so many folks don&#39;t have<br/>
the choice. For many people working or staying home is<br/>
not a choice they get to make. That&#39;s a socio-economic<br/>
class issue, and a political one. For those of us with<br/>
the opportunity to choose, we may in fact be faced<br/>
with a larger dilemma because it *is* a choice. Is one<br/>
&#39;right or wrong&#39; to choose to spend time doing work or<br/>
a hobby which fulfills one&#39;s interests outside of<br/>
parenting or family life? I think that&#39;s a question<br/>
that each individual has to answer for him- or<br/>
herself.<br/>
<br/>
Great questions,<br/>
Kim<br/>
