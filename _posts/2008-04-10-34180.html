<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938599273">Dr. James McKenna at Northwestern University has a great website for his sleep labs: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/.">http://www.nd.edu/~jmckenn1/lab/.</a> Dr. Helen Ball at the University Durham as a sleep-lab as well and a website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/sleep.lab/projects/.">http://www.dur.ac.uk/sleep.lab/projects/.</a> Dr. Carol Wortham at Emory University has a great paper on sleep at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/6yyvdc.">http://tinyurl.com/6yyvdc.</a> It talks about the contexts in which humans sleep. I didn&#39;t read the whole thing, but there was a lovely, relevant passage: <br/>
Components of Human Sleep Ecology<br/>
Sleep behavior and architecture clearly have strong biological determinants.<br/>
Yet consider Henri Rousseau’s famous picture, Sleeping Gypsy, in<br/>
which a rigidly prostrate, colorfully clad dusky figure, clutching a stick,<br/>
lies asleep on bare earth amid a barren landscape beneath a blank full<br/>
moon, under the alert gaze of an adjacent lion. The impact of the painting<br/>
relies largely on what is missing, namely the usual social and material<br/>
contexts of sleep, and the sense of danger aroused when these contexts<br/>
are absent.A solitary, unprotected, and unequipped sleeper is an aberration;<br/>
for humans, sleep is embedded in behaviorally, socially, and culturally<br/>
constituted environments enabling safe sleep. Safety concerns not<br/>
only macropredators such as lions or human enemies, but also buffering<br/>
elements, protection from micropredators such as mosquitoes, and general<br/>
reduction of external disturbance and predation risk. Safety also inheres<br/>
in membership in a well-functioning social group that frames and<br/>
populates the context for sleep. Shelter for and accoutrements of sleep<br/>
define its physical microenvironment. Moreover, the diurnal patterning<br/>
of sleep is influenced by a set of structural and cultural features operating<br/>
variably across the life course, including labor demands, schedules<br/>
of social and ritual activity, status and role differentiation, and beliefs<br/>
about the nature and functions of sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the line &quot;A solitary, unprotected, and unequipped sleeper is an aberration; for humans, sleep is embedded in behaviourally, socially, and culturally constituted environments enabling safe sleep. <br/>
<br/>
I found that article hard to read. And the term self-soothe disturbs at a level I can&#39;t even begin to not vent about it. David, my husband, has a paper on co-sleeping and stress in children. The abstract is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/114800801/ABSTRACT.">http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/abstract/114800801/ABSTRACT.</a> If you want I can get him to send you a copy, he says it has a decent introduction to the research on co-sleeping. <br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Re: relatives, changes, and why we can unschool<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday my SIL (husband&#39;s sister) sent an article to my husband and<br/>
their father. Here is the link:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1728755,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1728755,00.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Since my daughter is only 21 months this is definitely one of the most<br/>
relevant examples that I could add to this discussion. This article is<br/>
about a study and how children should not sleep with their parents --<br/>
that they should learn to sleep on their own. Well, my SIL knows that<br/>
our daughter sleeps with us (and still nurses). So I&#39;m not sure if she<br/>
thinks that sending this article will make us want to change how we do<br/>
things or what. I&#39;m sure that if we brought it up to her she would<br/>
tell us she was trying to help us because the article says that doing<br/>
these things (sleeping with your child) can cause health problems<br/>
later on. Whether it is true that she wants to help us, and/or how<br/>
much she wants proof that their ways of doing things with their son<br/>
(our nephew)are better, only she can know. What I do know is that<br/>
since my daughter has been born we have been working on finding the<br/>
path that is right for our family. Part of that for me is to stop<br/>
worrying about what other people think - including family. I find that<br/>
I often feel I&#39;m doing better about this (especially when we don&#39;t see<br/>
them!) but that I take steps backwards when I do have contact with<br/>
people that I perceive as questioning me (even if they aren&#39;t openly).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I also wondered what is my best way of doing more research<br/>
about studies like this one? It makes me sad to think that more people<br/>
who might consider and enjoy sleeping with their children will be<br/>
discouraged by another &quot;expert&quot; opinion. Even after reading the<br/>
article I could start to think of some ways that the study might not<br/>
be credible. But I thought I would throw it out to some of you who<br/>
might have more insight and experience dissecting studies.<br/>

This is a great point.<br/>
<br/>
Well, as someone who has just recently changed up the sleeping thing<br/>
in our house I just wanted to chime in.  For a couple of weeks we have<br/>
been trying to get oldest dd(5) to fall asleep on her own in her own<br/>
bed(I know, I know...). We had our own reasons-not b/c of anyone elses<br/>
say so but, anyway...<br/>
  Well we&#39;ve gotten rid of &quot;bedtime&quot; and gone to *if you want to get<br/>
into our bed and read then we&#39;ll sleep if you want to*  Last night I<br/>
turned off the light and dd starts giggling uncontrollably(you know<br/>
that kind of laugh that you know just means bliss).  And I ask her<br/>
what&#39;s up?  She says &quot;I just feel so good and warm and cozy being in<br/>
your bed.&quot;  Enough said for me to know we&#39;re doing the right thing now.<br/>
<br/>
Well, at least it didn&#39;t take me forever to figure things out! It&#39;s<br/>
less stress, kids are sleeping well and so far we all feel much more<br/>
peaceful. <br/>

peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1587633646">Well, maybe you all would be wililng to write Amy and tell her she was wrong in her advice to a mom... Here is the letter...<br/>
<br/>
Exasperated single mom wants her son to sleep in his own bed<br/>
<br/>
Dear Amy: I am a single mom raising a 21/2-year-old son. My son refuses to sleep in his bed through the night. He is up at least three times a night, wanting to lie in bed with me or lie on the couch. I lie on the floor by his bed and tell him to lie in his bed and go back to sleep. He refuses to stay in his bed, so he lies on the floor with me.<br/>
<br/>
I just started a new job working an overnight shift. When I work, my son stays at Grandma and Grandpa&#39;s overnight. He sleeps all night and does not get out of his bed.<br/>
<br/>
Am I handling this the wrong way?<br/>
<br/>
How can I get my son to break this habit?<br/>
<br/>
— Frustrated<br/>
<br/>
Dear Frustrated: The best way to break a child&#39;s habit is to change the parent&#39;s behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Your son should stay in his bed for the sake of both of you. When he wanders around at night and sleeps on the couch or floor, he isn&#39;t getting the rest he needs. You also must be well-rested to take good care of him during the day.<br/>
<br/>
Do not wander around with him at night or sleep on the floor of his room. The message you should convey is that nighttime is for sleeping and that everybody sleeps in his or her own bed.<br/>
<br/>
Establish a nice, unhurried bedtime ritual, and ask him to pick out which stuffed animal will sleep with him each night.<br/>
<br/>
When your son wanders or climbs in with you, take him by the hand and lead him back into his room. Place him in his bed and tuck him in. Don&#39;t speak and quickly leave the room. He will balk. He will cry and seem bereft. Do not cave.<br/>
<br/>
You may have to take him back to his bed many times the first night, but he needs to have the experience of falling asleep and waking up in his own bed. The second night will be easier, and if you stay calm, consistent and firm, he should be in a new pattern by the third or fourth night.<br/>

<br/>
Amy, I was not pleased with your answer to the frustrated parent whose 2 1/2 year old son was wanting to sleep with her.<br/>
<br/>
In many parts of the world, parents and children sleep together, in the same room and often in the same bed.  This is considered normal.<br/>
<br/>
Why do babies, children, need to grow up so quickly?  Why does this child need to sleep alone?  There is obviously a need that child has, to be in the same room, next to his mother.  Why do we ignore this child&#39;s need and push him to be grown up when he hasn&#39;t even lived three years on this earth.<br/>
<br/>
We should respect our children and their needs.  There is nothing wrong with parents sharing sleep with their children.  I always slept better with my young children close to me, I was there if they had a nightmare, or if there was an emergency such as a fire or earthquake. The quality time of sleeping close to my children made up for the time I missed when I was at work.<br/>
<br/>
Furthermore, I am a parent 24 hours a day, and I really wanted my children from the time they were born to know that they could come to me and I would respond to their needs all the time, not just during waking hours.   My children are now older, and we still have that special bond--there is no teenage angst in our home.  And even though we don&#39;t share sleep regularly, my children still climb in bed for a cuddle.  <br/>
<br/>
What message are we giving to our children when we say we will not be with them during sleeping hours?  Maybe when they are teens, they will remember this message, and not call us or trust us to respond to their worries and concerns.  <br/>
<br/>
Please, reconsider your advice--our society has pushed our children away long enough and the results of that are clear.  Now it&#39;s time to pull our children closer to us, even at midnight, and even when we are tired.  <br/>

<br/>
Who is this Amy woman anyway?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When your son wanders or climbs in with you, take him by the hand and<br/>
lead him back into his room. Place him in his bed and tuck him in.<br/>
Don&#39;t speak and quickly leave the room. He will balk. He will cry and<br/>

<br/>
Child management masquerading as parenting. I hate it. Solve a problem<br/>
now by generating three in the future. And then put the blame on the<br/>
child most likely instead of where it belongs with gonks like Amy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-178797288">In all of this I&#39;ve been thinking about the question about how to  <br/>
research co-sleeping, or Family Bed, or having nursing babies in bed  <br/>
with the mom.  Reading the book The Family Bed would be helpful.   <br/>
There was research behind that.  You could buy the book used<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0895293579/ref=lp_g_1">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0895293579/ref=lp_g_1</a><br/>
or search for The Family Bed and read what people are writing about  <br/>
the concept on parenting websites.  There&#39;s quite a bit of info there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The question about how to research something sounds to me pretty  <br/>
schooly.  I know it might not be what was thought, but it was the way  <br/>
it was stated, and I&#39;d like to riff on that in general.<br/>
<br/>
If we were in a graduate class, researching it would involve finding  <br/>
recent studies done probably by other grad students or PhD candidates.<br/>
<br/>
How do people learn naturally about such things, though?<br/>
<br/>
Observation, conversation, comparisons, extrapolating from what you  <br/>
know already about various things:<br/>
<br/>
architecture:  What kinds of houses do humans live in?  Who&#39;s had a  <br/>
separate bedroom for each person, and since when?<br/>
<br/>
biology:  What mammals dig a separate den for each pup/cub/kit/whatever?<br/>
<br/>
logic:  What&#39;s the advantage of isolation?  If sleeping alone in one  <br/>
room is so great, why don&#39;t parents do it?  Has &quot;going to bed&quot; become  <br/>
so sexualized that a virgin child must &quot;go to bed&quot; alone?<br/>
<br/>
Free-range thinking about such things can come to some interesting  <br/>
questions which can then be followed to other answers and questions.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;How do we learn more?&quot; replaces &quot;How do we research this?&quot; the  <br/>
answer becomes clearer and way more about unschooling, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156137776">Hi Susan.<br/>
<br/>
I would say, first of all, that the article was a travesty of bad <br/>
reasoning, since it made one tenuous claim (certain parental habits <br/>
can cause infants to wake more and sleep less) then &quot;supported&quot; that <br/>
with two totally unrelated studies that simply showed that getting <br/>
too little sleep can be connected to other physical or mental health <br/>
issues. There isn&#39;t any actual study referenced here that shows in <br/>
any way shape or form that co-sleeping causes children to sleep less <br/>
or that co-sleeping leads to any sleep-related issues.  The article, <br/>
through it&#39;s poor construction, tries to leave readers with that <br/>
impression, but nothing here justifies that notion.<br/>
<br/>
I would have to dig up some of the research I did when my son was <br/>
born (proud co-sleepers until my son was 5 and my daughter was 3, and <br/>
then they asked for their own rooms).  But some of the research I <br/>
remember showed that infants who co-sleep and breast feed (the <br/>
natural human manner of being with infants) had much higher levels of <br/>
brain activity while they slept.  They slept lighter, true, but while <br/>
sleeping they were in fact learning!  They react to the sounds and <br/>
smells of the mother, and even in sleep interact with her body all <br/>
night.  Infants sleeping alone in fact go into such deep brain <br/>
shutdown that they are nearly in a coma, with very little brain wave <br/>
activity.  Which makes sense - infants left alone go into a kind of <br/>
hibernation, shutting down all but essential bodily functions in <br/>
order to conserve energy.  Infants sleeping skin to skin with their <br/>
mothers is the natural way for infants to live in the world, and I <br/>
think the scienfitic literature, if looked at in total and <br/>
objectively, makes a strong case that this is the optimal arrangement <br/>
for infants.  <br/>
<br/>
And the studies can&#39;t distinguish between quality of sleep and only <br/>
measure it in terms of hours.  An infant is built by nature to sleep <br/>
lightly, to wake frequently to nurse, and to interact with the mother <br/>
continually (even their temperature regulates through contact with <br/>
the mother&#39;s skin).  It&#39;s probably why several studies have showed a <br/>
10 point IQ improvement for co-sleeping infants.<br/>
<br/>
The insistence that infants and toddlers and children sleep alone is <br/>
completely cultural, not grounded in science (regardless of how many <br/>
studies they toss out) and, to my mind, one more horrible thing done <br/>
to children.<br/>
<br/>
We still sleep very flexibly.  I never know who will end up sleeping <br/>
where, or waking where despite where they fell asleep.  Now that my <br/>
son and daughter are older and spend most nights in their own beds, I <br/>
find that I miss them terribly.  I wouldn&#39;t trade the way we slept <br/>
for anything.<br/>

It talks about the contexts in which humans sleep. I didn&#39;t read the <br/>

my husband, has a paper on co-sleeping and stress in children. The <br/>

you a copy, he says it has a decent introduction to the research on <br/>
co-sleeping. <br/>
