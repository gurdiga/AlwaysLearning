Aha!    It&#39;s called Play and Learn and was easy to find.   Ooops.   Sorry <br/>
about quoting the whole thing then.<br/>
<br/>
July 29, 2005 article on the banning of Grand Theft Auto in Australia:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://smh.com.au/news/breaking/popular-game-pulled-from-sale/2005/07/29/1122144013522.html">http://smh.com.au/news/breaking/popular-game-pulled-from-sale/2005/07/29/1122144013522.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;The game cannot now be legally sold, hired, advertised or exhibited in <br/>
Australia.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Businesses that sell or hire computer games should remove existing stocks <br/>
of this game from their shelves immediately,&quot; said OFLC director Des Clark.&quot;<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it would be illegal for someone (private person, not a dealer) to <br/>
sell a copy he had legally purchased in Australia to another Australian?   <br/>
And I wonder what the price could climb to if it&#39;s legal or what the fine would <br/>
be if it were ruled illegal?<br/>
<br/>
That is really pretty extreme.<br/>
<br/>
And so now there&#39;s an article (as of today) saying actual carjackings were <br/>
down by HALF since that game came out.   Funny, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Statistics, though...<br/>
Still, if statistics were used to condemn the game, statistics should be fair <br/>
for redeeming it.<br/>
