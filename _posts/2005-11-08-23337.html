<div id="ygrps-yiv-1899860691">I&#39;ve received the following request from a TV production company planning <br/>
something having to do with off the grid.   The guy&#39;s in England, and he said <br/>
&quot;the States,&quot; but I doubt he would turn down a fascinating Canadian family.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to respond to him off the list, go for it.   If you know of <br/>
families not on this list who might be interested, please forward this to them. <br/>
  If you don&#39;t want to correspond with a foreign stranger but you have ideas, <br/>
please write to me on the side at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a>    <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

 Hi,<br/>
<br/>
 Ricochet are the producers of documentaries for ABC and the Discovery <br/>
Channel.  We&#39;re now making a new series for Discovery, following families moving to <br/>
remote parts of the States to live a more off the grid lifestyle - building a <br/>
cabin, raising animals, aiming for self sufficiency, homeschooling their <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
 We&#39;re keen to find families making this kind of move to remote parts of the <br/>
States, and I&#39;m wondering if you know of any families who are preparing for <br/>
this kind of move? If so, I would really appreciate it if you could forward our <br/>
contact details to those who may be interested in participating in the series. <br/>
Would there also be space for a brief mention in an e-mail newsletter, or <br/>
even on your website?<br/>
<br/>
 My contact details are 011 44 207 251 6966 (UK), or 1 323 692 3038 (US), or <br/>
you can e-mail me on <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jamescm99@...">jamescm99@...</a> or <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:james.christiemiller@...">james.christiemiller@...</a> - rather boringly, our server is down right now, so the hotmail address is <br/>
best for the short term....<br/>
<br/>
 Many thanks for your time  - I look forward to hearing from you soon. In the <br/>
meanwhile you can view all of our programmes at www.ricochet.co.uk<br/>
