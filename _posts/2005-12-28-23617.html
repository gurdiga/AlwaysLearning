<div id="ygrps-yiv-148295287">This phrase has been stated here and is also common in mainstream <br/>
society....&quot;When you get out into the REAL world&quot;....i think the <br/>
poster here meant &quot;the real world&quot; in which if you dont make money <br/>
to pay your electric bill you might be in the dark, or if you dont <br/>
have money to buy food you might go hungry. <br/>
<br/>
But in the context of an unschooling family, is there really such a <br/>
thing as &quot;the real world&quot; set apart from the world in which our <br/>
children are already living? <br/>
<br/>
I only have one 9 yr old, and i am assuming at some point (the <br/>
magical age of 18 i guess?)i am supposed to want him to leave, to <br/>
move out, to &quot;make it on his own&quot;...but honestly its a little hard <br/>
for me to imagine. The previous poster said something about having <br/>
very little money but not expecting the child to contribute to the <br/>
household at 16, only at 18...because he is a legal adult then? I <br/>
would think if i was really having a hard time putting food on the <br/>
table, that whoever had a job in the family (whether they were 12, <br/>
or 16, or 18)might want to contribute as much as they could. I <br/>
borrowed my son&#39;s birthday money to pay a bill, and he was fine with <br/>
that. I told him i&#39;d pay it back in January when things are a little <br/>
easier....he even told me not to worry about it, i could keep it (it <br/>
was over $100!) Of course i will give it back to him, but he is very <br/>
generous. <br/>
<br/>
So i dunno....is 18 just an arbitrary age, in an unschooling family, <br/>
or is there something especially magical and significant about that <br/>
age that i should prepare myself for?<br/>
