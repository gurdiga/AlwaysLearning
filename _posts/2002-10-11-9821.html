<div id="ygrps-yiv-194380623">Hello friends,<br/>
I just wanted to drop a line to let you all know I love to read these little<br/>
stories. I am reassured that the way we live and learn is an excellent<br/>
choice! My ds is 5 and dd is 3, and the hardest part of unschooling, to me,<br/>
is the nagging feeling I&#39;m not doing enough to keep him &quot;up to par&quot; for lack<br/>
of better words. I need this type of list to encourage me along!<br/>
<br/>
We live in the desert, so there is no rainfall to speak of, but I allow my<br/>
kids to make mud and they do so nearly daily. I also went to the thrift<br/>
store and purchased them ladles, spoons, forks, spatulas, pie pans... all<br/>
theirs for mud pies and mud soup (my dd&#39;s favorite thing to create). I have<br/>
family that is horrified that our once manicured back yard is now half dug<br/>
(the half under the tree shade!) and that I encourage the water hose to make<br/>
mud, but my children&#39;s learning comes above a perfect yard, and mud washes<br/>
off!<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, definitely, when we have our couple of rainfalls each year, we are<br/>
outside playing in it!<br/>

&gt; Subject: Our Rainy Day<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, Deb.  You&#39;ve inspired me to share our day yesterday.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We awoke to the sound of rainfall outside.  A slow, steady, relaxing rain<br/>
that makes you want to lounge in bed all day.  My daughter was snuggled up<br/>
beside me and smiling sweetly from her dreams.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mady (6) somehow talked her brother Alex (9) into painting her toenails<br/>
(because he does such a gooooood job) for her.  It was the cutest thing I<br/>
had seen in a while........he was kneeling in the floor painting toes, while<br/>
she sat in the chair looking like a pampered princess.  I did find out later<br/>
that it was actually a business proposition that got Alex interested.  He<br/>
was charging her 25 cents per toe/finger and he easily told me that she<br/>
would be giving him $5 of her allowance on payday.  :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A while later, I found the kids sitting under the patio cover listening to<br/>
the rain fall onto it.  I could see the excitement in their eyes as they<br/>
asked me, &quot;Hey Mom, can we go play in the mud?&quot;   Now, I am sort of a<br/>
perfectionist and I don&#39;t like things dirty.  I usually don&#39;t intentionally<br/>
let them get covered head to toe in mud, but I decided it is surely to be a<br/>
learning experience, right?  (we&#39;ve been completely unschooling for 4-5<br/>
months now and I am still doing my best to deschool myself!)  Needless to<br/>
say, they had a blast.  After the gigantic mud pie construction, they<br/>
discovered how fun it was to rub the mud all over each other which of<br/>
course, had to be removed by spraying each other with the water hose.<br/>
After their subsequent showers, wrapped in their fuzziest robes, they had<br/>
steaming hot chocolate for afternoon snack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It wasn&#39;t long before something else fun was started.  Alex got his Hot<br/>
Wheels out and they had crash up derby in the kitchen floor.   They used all<br/>
the blocks, Legos, and Lincoln Logs to build towers to crash into.  While<br/>
Alex was building, Mady got tired of waiting and got out a math workbook and<br/>
did a couple of pages.  She had to have me check for accuracy as soon as she<br/>
was finished (which of course my baby did wonderfully!) and then hang it on<br/>
the fridge for all to see.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Then the fort building started.  I truly guess I have lost the battle for<br/>
the living room.  We don&#39;t have a playroom so the kids have taken over my<br/>
tastefully decorated living area.  They had forts built from one end of the<br/>
room to the other.  Alex got out his video camera and started filming a<br/>
sequel to &quot;War of Wars&quot; which he filmed last week for his Mimi.  For his<br/>
birthday last year, she got him almost every GI Joe doll and accessory<br/>
available.  She is in the Army Reserve and very military oriented.  He<br/>
filmed his dolls (excuse me, It was requested I use the term,<br/>
soldiers........) ahem, ....soldiers in the midst of a ferocious battle.  It<br/>
was kinda Toy Storyish.  Anyway, they were now doing a sequel with Barbie<br/>
and her friends with the Soldiers.  Barbie&#39;s house was eventually bombed<br/>
(you could &#39;hear&#39; the fighter pilots coming) but everyone made it out okay.<br/>
Whew!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What a wonderful day for us all!  I even had time to do some reading<br/>
myself.   We now have to plan Daddy&#39;s birthday party ....it&#39;s tonight....and<br/>
people are coming over.......eeek!  I guess the forts will have to be put<br/>
away for another rainy day.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Do you<br/>
&gt; &gt; live<br/>
&gt; &gt; somewhere up in the Northern Midwest? Montana, N. Dakota?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We live in Montana, in a little town in the south west part of the state.<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s beautiful here and interesting, geographically, but I&#39;ve never fit<br/>
&gt; in, personally.   I&#39;m a granola in a meat and potatoes town.  I used to<br/>
&gt; kind of hide out, but now I flaunt it.  I figure every little cowboy town<br/>
&gt; needs a character!  Dylan loves it here.<br/>
&gt; He thinks small town life is perfect.  He wouldn&#39;t mind though, if we&#39;d<br/>
&gt; get a good toy store.<br/>

&gt; Kimber,  don&#39;t tell that entrepreneurial son of yours people pay good<br/>
&gt; money to have mud smeared on them at expensive spa&#39;s!   LOL.  What a fun<br/>
&gt; family.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our neighbor doesn&#39;t let her kids play in the rain.  Dylan loves the<br/>
&gt; rain, in the summer when it&#39;s warm, and is always out in it.  She came<br/>
&gt; over a few weeks ago with her littlest boy and told me... came over TO<br/>
&gt; tell me, that HER kids don&#39;t play in the rain because they could get sick<br/>
&gt; and she didn&#39;t think it was fair that Dylan was out there, right across<br/>
&gt; the street, where her kids could see, playing in the rain.  I said, no<br/>
&gt; that&#39;s not fair that they can&#39;t play in the rain too, and I was amazed<br/>
&gt; about the illness because he&#39;s ten now and has never gotten sick from it.<br/>
&gt;  She looked at her little boy and said, sternly, &quot;GO HOME&quot;  and then told<br/>
&gt; me she didn&#39;t appreciate me saying stuff like that in front of her<br/>
&gt; kids...   She didn&#39;t seem to think it was a problem that she was in my<br/>
&gt; yard, in front of my kid telling me WE shouldn&#39;t be outside because HER<br/>
&gt; kids weren&#39;t allowed in the rain.... well, whatever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Your mud story made me happy.  = )  You want to come and be my neighbor?<br/>

&gt; I loved reading about your day with Dylan.  Sometimes I forget it&#39;s the<br/>
&gt; small things that make the difference.  The discovering of something<br/>
&gt; simple.  Yesterday I picked up my best friend&#39;s son from school (wow<br/>
&gt; those places are noises)..  He had a half day and she&#39;s out of town in<br/>
&gt; Kansas for a week.  My boys couldn&#39;t get over the amount of school buses<br/>
&gt; in one place!!  Zak and Eliott played together for about 6 hours and had<br/>
&gt; a great time.  They dug up the back garden and built a moat and a<br/>
&gt; castle.  It was fascinating to watch them on and off.  Soccer practice<br/>
&gt; came later, followed by a stop at grandma and grandpas and then DH<br/>
&gt; decided to take both sons to Peter Piper Pizza.  Needless to say my baby<br/>
&gt; (Max aged 3) didn&#39;t go to bed till I think 11:30pm.  He was in bed with<br/>
&gt; me and I think I fell asleep about 11:30pm.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What  a great day was had by all...<br/>

&gt; Dawn, when Dylan five we had a friend here who&#39;s children were in<br/>
&gt; Kindergarten and second grade.  We&#39;d pick them up after school three days<br/>
&gt; a week and they&#39;d play at our house for a couple of hours while their mom<br/>
&gt; was at work.  Dylan thought the school was really interesting and we&#39;d go<br/>
&gt; a little early so he could climb on the playground equipment while we<br/>
&gt; waited.<br/>
&gt; The thing was, after picking up the kids they would always have something<br/>
&gt; to say about their day.  The little girl, Morgan, always had a headache,<br/>
&gt; always had been hit or pushed or otherwise assaulted or offended and the<br/>
&gt; older boy Jared was being bullied by some mean kid.  I never worried that<br/>
&gt; Dylan would want to go to school because he felt so sorry for his friends<br/>
&gt; who had to go.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He hears all the time at Karate and Tae Kwon Do that he&#39;s lucky he<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t have to go to school, but we still sneak in and climb that jungle<br/>
&gt; gym thing once in awhile.  I expect we&#39;ll get busted someday...but I<br/>
&gt; figure, hey, I paid for it, right?<br/>

&gt; My hubby used to work at the McDonald Observatory in Far West Texas so<br/>
last year we were able to see the leonid show and it was truly spectacular.<br/>
We got our sleeping bags and laid out most of the night. We laid on top of<br/>
the car because they were shooting from all directions and we couldn&#39;t see<br/>
from the ground. I do miss the fantastic sky shows we witnessed in Texas.<br/>
Sigh... Mary in Va.<br/>

&gt; something people consider &quot;real&quot;.<br/>
&gt; *I* don&#39;t believe that&#39;s the only thing that would give these stories<br/>
&gt; value, but I think nervous parents want a blueprint AND a guarantee.<br/>
&gt; Without it people would still have panic attacks, but with it they could<br/>
&gt; say to worried husbands and relatives,  other kids lived this way and<br/>
&gt; they turned out ok...<br/>
&gt; There will be lots and lots of those stories before too long.  = )<br/>

&gt; LOL, My son (when younger) pulled off Barbies head and threw it because he<br/>
&gt; thought she was using Ken (which was his doll) Later that day we played<br/>
&gt; badmitton (sp) with her poor ole head. My oldest, who is a feminist says<br/>
&gt; Barbie is a tramp :)<br/>

&gt; &gt;I could see the excitement in their eyes as they asked me, &quot;Hey Mom, can<br/>
&gt; we go play in the mud?&quot;   Now, I am sort of a perfectionist and I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; like things dirty.  I usually don&#39;t intentionally let them get covered<br/>
head<br/>
&gt; to toe in mud, but I decided it is surely to be a learning experience,<br/>
&gt; right?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This reminds me of when we first moved to Hawaii years ago. The two older<br/>
&gt; ones were about 5 and 3 and they decided to make one part of the backyard<br/>
&gt; into a mud garden. On one of their first days doing this they decided to<br/>
&gt; paint themselves from head to toe with the mud (2 very pale British<br/>
kids --<br/>
&gt; completely naked). they were caked in bright red mud which we discovered<br/>
an<br/>
&gt; hour or two later also left them stained bright red! They were kind of<br/>
&gt; muddy/streaky colored for about 3 days after that. After a few more weeks<br/>
&gt; they were so brown the future mud wars didn&#39;t show up as badly as at<br/>
first,<br/>

&gt; &gt; kids weren&#39;t allowed in the rain.... well, whatever.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Deb L<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I want to be your neighbor! (the kids and I are spending the day<br/>
reorganizing<br/>
&gt; book shelves :o( boring!)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our neighbor once had the nerve to come over and tell me that it wasn&#39;t<br/>
fair<br/>
&gt; that my kids got to play outside during the day. I asked why it mattered<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; her, her kids are in school all day. She told me that every time they are<br/>
at<br/>
&gt; home on a parent teacher conference day or other holiday from school, they<br/>
&gt; see my kids running around playing. Since she was at work, her kids had to<br/>
&gt; stay inside until she got home at 5, and they spent the day calling her at<br/>
&gt; work asking to play outside. This of course is very disruptive to her work<br/>
&gt; day and she doesn&#39;t want to have to deal with it. I had suggested that she<br/>
&gt; let the kids come out to play, I was out with the kids, they would have<br/>
fun.<br/>
&gt; She, very meanly, told me, she didn&#39;t want her children getting the idea<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; hsing is fun. :o( She then told me she had gone to great lengths to tell<br/>
her<br/>
&gt; kids that Moly and Jack had to do all the same things they did at school,<br/>
all<br/>
&gt; the bookwork and tests and that them seeing ours out disputed that idea in<br/>
&gt; her kids heads. So I told her hsing didn&#39;t have to be that way, my kids<br/>
don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have bookwork or tests, my kids are free to play and be kids. She sent her<br/>
&gt; kids home too, after hearing me say that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Since then, her children have come over often, asking questions about<br/>
hsing.<br/>
&gt; They are very curious about our lives, and how Moly and Jack learn to read<br/>
&gt; and do things like math and science. (Moly said she wished they would get<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; idea and just play, since she isn&#39;t too fond of feeling like a monkey in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; zoo.) It is a constant source of wonder when I explain that we don&#39;t<br/>
divide<br/>
&gt; our learning into groups like math, reading, and science. When they see<br/>
Moly<br/>
&gt; reading about the human body and playing with her models, I hear things<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; &quot;We don&#39;t get to learn about that until high school.&quot; When they see Jack<br/>
&gt; reading a book with chapters, the youngest Jack&#39;s age, made a comment that<br/>
&gt; she didn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; to read *chapter books* until next year. (Jack wanted to<br/>
&gt; know what a chapter book was.) Many times I have had to sit and explain<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; I have never grouped books into categories like chapter books. They are<br/>
&gt; amazed that my kids can read and write. By the things they say, I am sure<br/>
&gt; their mother has gone to great lengths to get them to believe they would<br/>
&gt; never learn by just being kids. :o(<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ~Nancy Who would rather hear all about everyone&#39;s great and not-so-great<br/>
&gt; unschooling days than any &#39;ole neighbor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; I loved reading this!! We live in the city -- and sometimes I get a little<br/>
weirded out about certain puddles (such as the ones with car fluids floating<br/>
on top)....but mostly I let dd jump away! About a week ago, I drained all<br/>
the water from her swimming pool. Dd proceeded to get her water boots on and<br/>
splashed around wildly in the street as the water flowed down to the storm<br/>
drain. My neighbor came out, made a face, and stated (angrily) &quot;Ach! That<br/>
water is dirty! Why are you letting her jump in dirty water?&quot; I informed her<br/>
that my daughter was having fun and does take baths.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I grew up in a small town with a big back yard. My fondest memory of being<br/>
a little kid is playing in the dirt, stomping in streams, puddle<br/>
jumping....basically we loved anything that involved getting totally filthy.<br/>
I will never deny my daughter similar opportunities!<br/>

&gt; We had a great rain day a couple of weeks ago.  It was warm, so I<br/>
&gt; told the kids to go out in bathing suits(didn&#39;t want a bunch of wet<br/>
&gt; clothes to wash).  It was one of those really HARD down pours and<br/>
&gt; they stood on our front deck screaming with joy from the feeling.<br/>
&gt; It lightened up a bit and they took the umbrella from our deck table<br/>
&gt; and put it on the play set out back and made a fort.<br/>
&gt; They were out there for over an hour and my 5 yo came in with blue<br/>
&gt; lips(at which point I offered him a raincoat, but he opted for hot<br/>
&gt; chocolate instead).  Amazingly, noone got sick!?<br/>
&gt; Playing in the rain is a thrill no child should be denied.<br/>

&gt; Hi Deb<br/>
&gt; Well, I have to admit, that even though I love all the homeschoolers<br/>
&gt; around, the crowding of this area is hard to take some days. Also,<br/>
&gt; it can be hard to find &quot;nature.&quot;  For our Nature Club we mostly will<br/>
&gt; go to state and county parks in the area.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The way I got it going was this:  I have been toying with the idea<br/>
&gt; of starting some type of co-op activities that would be friendly for<br/>
&gt; bringing preschoolers and toddlers along, since most of my friends<br/>
&gt; have these! I thought of doing an art day, a games day, things liek<br/>
&gt; that.  I wanted it to be free and not require too much commitment<br/>
&gt; from people, since I always hate the feeling of waking up and<br/>
&gt; realizing I commited to some activity that doesn&#39;t sound good that<br/>
&gt; day!  I asked around and everyone I talked to said it sounded great,<br/>
&gt; so I armed myself with two books:<br/>
&gt; Walking San Diego--it maps out easy to difficult walks all over the<br/>
&gt; county with info about native habitats, etc.<br/>
&gt; Sharing Nature with Children--an old book by Joseph Cornell that has<br/>
&gt; simple awareness and appreciation activities for kids.  I will pick<br/>
&gt; out one or two activities each time, but I just leave it open to the<br/>
&gt; mood whether we actually do them or not.<br/>
&gt; Then, each week, my girls and I go check out one or two of the<br/>
&gt; walks.  When we find one that will work for a group, we invite<br/>
&gt; everyone by e-mail.<br/>
&gt; Well, I was hoping to get two or three other families to share our<br/>
&gt; walks, but already I have eight, and more interested.  Yikes!<br/>

&gt; Hi Tami,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am Tami and my mate is Michael too :)<br/>
&gt; Welcome!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Peace,<br/>
&gt; Tami<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &#39;Namaste&#39; is an East Indian greeting which means &#39;the light within me bows<br/>
&gt; to the light within you.&#39; In other words, beyond our achy bones, our tired<br/>
&gt; feet and our multi-colored real life soap operas, lurks a dimension that<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; more than the body, the persona, the ego and all the &#39;trappings and the<br/>
&gt; suits of woe&#39; as Hamlet would say---a dimension where there isn&#39;t a &#39;you&#39;<br/>
&gt; and &#39;me&#39; but rather a synergy that is more than all that, a space for the<br/>
&gt; eternal to rest within the temporal.<br/>
