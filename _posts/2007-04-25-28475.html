<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612703920">Hi! I am new to unschooling. I read about 4 of John Holt&#39;s books over<br/>
the last few months and became captivated with the idea of unschooling<br/>
our three boys (at least that&#39;s all we have so far). The oldest will<br/>
be 4 in July and I have already been working on changing my ideas of<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; him, which is very hard for me because I am such a<br/>
teacher-type. It&#39;s harder for me to just get down and play with my<br/>
children, but I am learning, too.<br/>
<br/>
My question for the group would be, has anyone found that friends and<br/>
family (especially older friends and family) think that unschooling is<br/>
just a way to let your kids take charge and run all over you? I keep<br/>
getting this a lot, that I am doing them a disservice by letting them<br/>
guide their own learning, that they are going to turn out to be<br/>
spoiled brat monsters or something. I do not believe this to be true,<br/>
but there are times when a seed of doubt that I am doing the right<br/>
thing is placed in my heart when so many of my friends and family are<br/>
against what we want to do with the boys. Any discussion about this<br/>
would be appreciated. I feel a bit defeated and I haven&#39;t even truly<br/>
started yet.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1729960613">We are new to unschooling (still learning as we go along) too and we are<br/>
LOVING it!!  (well, DH is still at the &quot;unsure&quot; stage, BUT me and the kids<br/>
are loving it!, LOL)  As for our family and friends that don&#39;t get &quot;it&quot;,  I<br/>
don&#39;t even go into details.. especially with family.  They just know that we<br/>
homeschool and for now thats all they need to know about how we CHOOSE to<br/>
educate our children.  I want to live a rich, full, fun life with my family<br/>
and I have made the choice to do that and unschooling is the way to do<br/>
that.  Some friends who know that I have started unschooling don&#39;t say<br/>
anything about it but I know they don&#39;t truly get it.  Hopefully they will<br/>
see it as time goes on!<br/>
