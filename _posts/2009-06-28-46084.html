<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285817804">&lt;&lt;&lt;If I recall correctly, Kuhn&#39;s _The Structure of Scientific <br/>
Revolutions_ is all about that,<br/>
about scientists/thinkers being invested in<br/>
certain belief systems, and how that affects<br/>
their abilities to think and to do research,<br/>
and to evaluate the research findings of<br/>
colleagues. And so, progress is very, very<br/>
incremental. Great big, new, different ideas<br/>
are just too difficult to accept. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
Yep, that&#39;s Kuhn.  And I think it does have a lot to do with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
So Kuhn talks about &quot;normal science,&quot; which is incremental, but also <br/>
scientific revolutions, which happen in big leaps when there get to <br/>
be too many inconsistencies in a theory.  Most of the scientists are <br/>
trying to patch up the holes in a theory, say for example, the sun <br/>
revolving around the earth.<br/>
<br/>
But the scientific revolutionaries look at it with a different eye <br/>
and propose a new theory that works with everything including the <br/>
holes.  They say, aha! the earth revolves around the sun.  The old <br/>
timers sometimes  can&#39;t accept or even see the new way of thinking, <br/>
so Copernicus winds up imprisoned.<br/>
<br/>
But, even though there are hangers-on to the old theories, <br/>
revolutions in science do come about with a major and fairly sudden <br/>
paradigm shift.  (Kuhn coined the term &quot;paradigm shift.&quot;)   The new <br/>
theory just makes too much sense.  After the shift, people can&#39;t <br/>
believe in an earth centered universe anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I feel that we unschoolers are the leading edge of a <br/>
paradigm shift.  At least it&#39;s nice to think so!  You know how it is <br/>
when you meet people so stuck in the school mode of thinking that <br/>
they can&#39;t even see it when you explain that you don&#39;t use a <br/>
curriculum?  I think of them as stuck in an old paradigm.  Sometimes, <br/>
they can shift when you show them the contradictions, but way too <br/>
often they try to patch up the holes in their theories about learning <br/>
with more discipline and longer school days.<br/>

The theory has been really important in helping my husband understand <br/>
the reactions he&#39;s gotten to his research.<br/>

new idea.  School&#39;s the new idea, the new experiment in social order. <br/>
When school wasn&#39;t compulsory, people still managed to learn and live.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or sometimes they don&#39;t want to question it at all, no patching up holes<br/>
or examining contradictions, just a simple belief in the way things are<br/>
because that is how it was when they were a kid and how it was when<br/>
their parents were kids.  It&#39;s far enough in the generation chain, that<br/>
school&#39;s accepted as IT, the way of getting and imparting knowledge.  To<br/>
consider otherwise is crazy, right?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard parents say things like, &quot;School isn&#39;t the best place, but I<br/>
went and got through it, so my kids should be able to too&quot;.  Nothing<br/>
like settling for mediocre for your children, simply because it&#39;s the<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; thing to do!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about &quot;YES&quot; a lot lately, how empowering it is to<br/>
hear that word and live that word.  I keep thinking how schools don&#39;t<br/>
embody that kind of empowerment, how dangerous it would be if they did. <br/>
Schools keep things controlled and orderly.  When I look at how my kids<br/>
learn, and even myself, it&#39;s not controlled and orderly.  That kind of<br/>
environment would stifle learning, and in fact does, in classrooms<br/>
everyday.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s such a huge idea to open up your world to saying &quot;yes&quot; and allowing<br/>
for that kind of freedom of exploration of the world, instead of saying<br/>
&quot;no&quot; and shutting the door to ideas and things, that could be very<br/>
expansive to thought and learning.  I was thinking of shutting doors<br/>
figuratively, but schools actually do it for real, they shut doors and<br/>
windows, so in school, it&#39;s both real and figuratively.  My mind gets<br/>
claustrophobic just thinking about it!</div>

<br/>
An SCA friend of mine, grown, childless, was going to teach his first  <br/>
physics course and having talked with me lots of times about  <br/>
alternative education, he asked me to come and take the class, and  <br/>
critique him, but also to see whether I wouldn&#39;t understand physics  <br/>
better if he had a chance to explain it to me.<br/>
<br/>
I had taken a physics course in the early 1970&#39;s from a guy who used  <br/>
to DO things--he rode in on a bicycle-wheel cart, propelled by a fire  <br/>
extinguisher one day.  He had one of those birds that dips over and  <br/>
comes back up, like they sell little ones of, but his was about four  <br/>
feet high.<br/>
<br/>
So I went to my friend&#39;s physics class at the university, and I was  <br/>
planning to go for a semester, but after two weeks I couldn&#39;t stand  <br/>
anymore.  He enjoyed physics, himself, but for us he was reciting what  <br/>
other people had recited to him.  We had to agree to these &quot;simple  <br/>
examples&quot; or proof of physical &quot;laws,&quot; and I was arguing from the  <br/>
beginning (not in class, but on the side with him by e-mail).   A  <br/>
bullet fired straight up will hit the ground going as fast as when it  <br/>
was fired from the gun?<br/>
That didn&#39;t make sense to me.  A row of numbers as &quot;proof&quot; didn&#39;t make  <br/>
it make any more sense.  A rocket returning to earth doesn&#39;t hit the  <br/>
ocean with the same force that it left the atmosphere.<br/>
He figured I was hopeless.  I figured physics was beyond me lame  <br/>
everyday logic.<br/>
<br/>
Then the mythbusters TV show came along and took my side and said the  <br/>
physics number<br/>
proof was wrong.  So what people have been paying other people to  <br/>
teach them and give them physics degrees about was a myth?  And they  <br/>
claimed to believe it and consider the &quot;proof&quot; as proof, like the  <br/>
emperor&#39;s new clothes?<br/>
<br/>
Another question in that physics class had to do with something  <br/>
(water, probably) in a container, under certain conditions, and what  <br/>
would happen if it was cooled or heated or something, and I said  <br/>
&quot;What&#39;s the container made of?&quot;  And he just looked at me.  That one  <br/>
was in class.  What the container was made of wasn&#39;t part of the  <br/>
&quot;equation.&quot;   What!?  In what universe?  Is it steel?   Glass?   <br/>
Plastic?  Ceramic?  So he wasn&#39;t undertanding that I thought it  <br/>
mattered what the container was.  He said &quot;I don&#39;t see why it matters.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was stunned, but figured, still, it was my misunderstanding and not  <br/>
his.  I said &quot;Is it God&#39;s perfect container?&quot;  Yes, he said.  God&#39;s  <br/>
perfect container.<br/>
<br/>
So this was THEORETICAL.  IF there were a container that didn&#39;t affect  <br/>
the process in any way whatsoever, then...<br/>
But there isn&#39;t one.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-583798951">I had already pulled three magazine pages out to quote here, while I  <br/>
was reading in the bed last night, and woke up and found this from Pam  <br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I was reading a month-old issue of People Magazine. Because of the  <br/>
recession, they&#39;ve started having pages on having a great life without  <br/>
spending much money.  That&#39;s good!<br/>
<br/>
Samantha Brown of The Travel Channel (I don&#39;t get cable, so I&#39;m  <br/>
quoting; I have no idea about her) had suggestions on how to have a  <br/>
great vacation in your own town:<br/>
<br/>
Check in to a hotel.  You won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re on vacation if you  <br/>
have to do laundry and wash dirty dishes, so book a room somewhere.<br/>
Avoid your usual places.  Get your coffee at a different cafe, eat at  <br/>
a new ethnic joint, go for a walk in an unfamiliar park.  The goal is  <br/>
to &quot;discover hidden gems.&quot;<br/>
Check tourist sites for festivals, poetry readings, music performances  <br/>
and outdoor movie screenings--stuff you might otherwise be oblivious to.<br/>
<br/>
For years haven&#39;t I and others on this list been saying &quot;go to a  <br/>
different store; eat where you&#39;ve never eaten&quot;?  Drive different ways  <br/>
when you travel.  When people have needed to reconnect with a child,  <br/>
I&#39;ve said do an overnight trip to another town, stay in a motel, do  <br/>
something just the two of you.<br/>
<br/>
So now it&#39;s more mainstream advice, even for people without kids. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Two articles talked about school, in passing, in ways that assumed no  <br/>
options.  A kid who used to be on TV shows and movies disappeared at  <br/>
the age of 18, two years ago.  The family had lived in southern  <br/>
California, but the parents had taken him back to Washington State to  <br/>
finish high school, and the mom said he was &quot;...heartbroken.  But he  <br/>
understood that we needed to go home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s dead or gone or run away, but the family &quot;NEEDED&quot; to take him  <br/>
away from Burbank because Burbank high school wouldn&#39;t let him  <br/>
transfer credits from wherever-in-Washington unless he enrolled full  <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
HOW did high school become more important than well-paying full time  <br/>
employment?<br/>
<br/>
In an article about Chris Pine who played Captain Kirk in the new star  <br/>
trek movie, it says<br/>
&quot;Pine graduated from U.C. Berkeley with an English degree in 2002 and  <br/>
then worked as a restaurant server before landing his breakout role in  <br/>
2004&#39;s The Princess Diaries 2.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That paragraph was headed &quot;He&#39;s got brains too.&quot;<br/>
Were brains proven by graduating with an English degree?<br/>
Was an English degree helpul in working as a restaurant server?<br/>
He&#39;s an actor.  Neither the English degree nor the working in a  <br/>
restaurant was the point of the article, but that was offered as proof  <br/>
he was smart.<br/>
<br/>
Then there was one I didn&#39;t save, about an autistic boy whose parents  <br/>
discovered he loved horses and started talking after he was around  <br/>
horses.<br/>
The mom mentioned school MANY times in the article, and he&#39;s just  <br/>
little, like six maybe.  But at some point they took him to Mongolia  <br/>
or somewhere to live around horses and Shamans.  So the parents could  <br/>
afford to move to China?  And when they were there, he became much  <br/>
more communicative.   It was like a miracle.  Now he&#39;s back in school.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no proof that just getting older helped him and the horses and  <br/>
shamanistic healings were incidental.  Maybe it was just being with  <br/>
his mom, doing something SO PROFOUNDLY INTERESTING as riding horses  <br/>
that triggered him to speak.  Maybe they should just be with him a lot  <br/>
at their own house and not send him to school.<br/>

could skip all the middle man, why not do so?  It seems more and more<br/>
that school is the means and the end, in and of itself.  It sure felt<br/>
like the end for me, when I graduated from high school.  It finally felt<br/>
like the end to all that boring drudgery, time to actually live my life.<br/>

helping that kid be able to talk and do all the stuff that he&#39;s likely<br/>
to do anyway, and then blame the kid and the parents for all the damage<br/>
the schools do to him.</div>

that IF Chamille chooses, she can do a dual enrollment program and get<br/>
cosmetology credit without us having to pay out of pocket.  We need to<br/>
be in a different school district.  She may choose not to, since she&#39;s<br/>
not keen on going to school at all, and we may choose to pay out of<br/>
pocket anyway.  We still want the option, so we are moving.  She may<br/>
even choose not to do any of it, but at this point, she&#39;s very much<br/>
wanting to go that direction, eventually, not tomorrow, but sooner than<br/>

I believe you are referring to Rowan Isaacson in the above story.  His parents, according to this article, came back from Mongolia and set up an equine therapy ranch and &quot;homeschool&quot; for children with disabilities.  I love that the title of this article includes &quot;encourage exploration.&quot;  Am not sure what a homeschool for a group of children means exactly.  But at least  we know the parents have taken a step away from traditional school for their son and are offering support to others who want to do the same.  Perhaps it is even more like unschooling that schooling at home.  Might be interesting to find out...am not sure how one totally unschools a child with lower functioning autism, though, and grapple myself with this idea because the child is not motivated to learn in the same way that a typical child is and  sometimes is quite content  NOT to explore his/her surroundings.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, parents of children with autism, because their lives can be so &quot;abnormal,&quot; want, even more than the average parent, their child to experience the &quot;normalcy&quot; of going to school.  Maybe it is less about the quality of education and more about simply wanting the choice to do what everyone else is doing. It&#39;s one thing to have a typically functioning child and choose to educate him/her differently, and quite another to have your choices limited because your child is not welcome.  Also, the unfounded fear that taking a child out of school might limit him socially is doubly hard for a parent of a child with autism to come to terms with because the child is already suffering socially.  This is perhaps why the Isaacson&#39;s have invited other homeschoolers to join them at their home--to be sure Rowan has other children with whom to interact.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re so right in that there is no proof that anything these people have done has helped their son mature.  But at least they&#39;re adventurously experimenting by offering him the chance to have fun in the real world with real (potentially scary) animals rather than locking him in an office with a therapist. It sounds like they&#39;ve also questioned the effects of &quot;regular&quot; school on their son.<br/>
<br/>
The Isaacson&#39;s are likely doing their best they can with what they know/have in some very difficult circumstances. <br/>

<br/>
No doubt.  I wasn&#39;t trying to say they weren&#39;t.<br/>
In keeping with the topic, though, their concern in the article I read  <br/>
seemed to be heavily school-related.   And it seemed obvious to me  <br/>
that the biggest difference between being home and sending him to  <br/>
school and being in China was that they were WITH HIM, together, not  <br/>
sending him to school.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe horses were the magic key at first, but that doesn&#39;t mean horses  <br/>
are the continuing best possible thing necessarily.<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in the article did anyone suggest that he might&#39;ve become more  <br/>
verbal even if his parents couldn&#39;t afford to go across the world, and  <br/>
even if he hadn&#39;t gotten to ride a horse.  There was no indication  <br/>
that anyone involved (even professionals asked to comment) had  <br/>
considered it might be the special time and attention and being with  <br/>
his parents.<br/>

one big fat &quot;NO&quot; you can&#39;t do what you want, you must be in this<br/>
building doing what we tell you to do.  Without that, kids would likely<br/>
choose to do other things on any particular day.  They might just say<br/>
&quot;yes&quot;, I&#39;d like to sleep in today, or &quot;yes&quot;, I think I&#39;d like to spend<br/>
the day skating at the skate park.  That kind of empowerment is<br/>
dangerous to the existence of schools.<br/>
<br/>
The very notion that our culture raises kids without choices, seems<br/>
truly dangerous to keeping freedom alive.  It is, in many ways, the<br/>
antithesis of free thinking and free exploration.  All the wonderful<br/>
inventions and ideas didn&#39;t come about because of compulsory schooling. <br/>
If anyone can think of inventions and ideas that came about with<br/>
compulsory schooling, speak up, because, I really am not thinking of<br/>
any.  I suppose unschooling came about as a reaction against it.</div>

It was confusing and difficult to un-format, so I left out all names  <br/>
when I realized I might be combining posts.  I hope you don&#39;t mind,  <br/>

<br/>
Heck, I&#39;d love to have a photo of me in that one I had.  I was a size  <br/>
10 but the requirement was to order a size larger so they would be  <br/>
baggy and we wouldn&#39;t grow out of them.   My friend Cyndi was a  <br/>
cheerleader and she was in charge of taking the orders for the  <br/>
uniforms for P.E.  I still remember the little act she put on when she  <br/>
discovered with horror that the one she had ordered for herself was  <br/>
actually a size too SMALL.  How embarrassing.   She wore it all year,  <br/>
though, and didn&#39;t consider trading out with someone just one size  <br/>
off.   &lt;g&gt;     Meanwhile, the PE teacher was wearing skin-tight bike- <br/>
shorts kind of things and a low-cut dance top, sort of.   We had no  <br/>
option but the baggy blue cotton uniforms.  Standing next to Cyndi,  <br/>
posing in her tight one.<br/>

part of the PE uniform at my high school when I graduated in 1979.<br/>
<br/>
The rule for the tunic hem length was &quot;8-10 inches above the ground when <br/>
kneeling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
For the school uniform it was &quot;6-8 inches above the ground when kneeling&quot;.<br/>

Someone sent this quote today:<br/>
<br/>
    If you make people think they&#39;re thinking, they&#39;ll love you. If  <br/>
you really make them think, they&#39;ll hate you.  (Don Marquis)<br/>
<br/>
There is a great deal of school-surround that involves creating the  <br/>
impression that parents, teachers and students are being thoughtful  <br/>
and making decisions.  They are given options and they weigh them with  <br/>
gravity, and feel good about their choices.  The choices are something  <br/>
like military or college, or which college, or what major.   If  <br/>
military, then what branch of the service, or will one go to college  <br/>
and join an officers&#39; training program and THEN go to the military?    <br/>
It seems like a world of choices if you nose is on the recruiting  <br/>
posters and if your choice that day had been to stay in class or go to  <br/>
the recruiting session in the gym.<br/>
<br/>
As to unschooling and the quote though,   &quot;If you make people think  <br/>
they&#39;re thinking, they&#39;ll love you&quot; reminds me of a sales room at a  <br/>
large homeschooling conference, with all the vendors and different  <br/>
curriculae.  It reminds me of discussion lists that tell people they  <br/>
can unschool any way they want to!  There are no rules, and there are  <br/>
as many ways to unschool as there are unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
And that latter part, again...  unschooling discussions where people  <br/>
will actually say &quot;Did you think this through at all yourself, or are  <br/>
you just reciting what someone else said?&quot;  Or, &quot;You wrote it and  <br/>
posted it; why did you say &quot;lazy&quot; and &quot;taught&quot; and &quot;problem&quot;?<br/>

 &gt; employment?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or College...see below:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My younger brother Matt is 22 years old.<br/>
He never liked school, although he was very bright.<br/>
It was a constant struggle for my dad and Matt&#39;s mom, (dad&#39;s second  <br/>
wife).<br/>
They live in NJ, and at some point the TV show &quot;Ed&quot; was filming in a  <br/>
bowling alley close to their home.<br/>
Matt checked it, and because of that, acting became his passion.<br/>
For someone that was considered lazy because he did not do his school  <br/>
work, he became very ambitious.<br/>
He went to the set and made friends with the crew, which led him to  <br/>
get agents names.<br/>
He started taking dancing and singing lessons, and joined his school&#39;s  <br/>
drama club as well as a local theatre troupe.<br/>
Matt got the lead in a number of his high school plays.<br/>
I saw him, he was good, it was his passion.<br/>
<br/>
In Matt&#39;s senior year he got an internship at one of Broadway&#39;s top PR  <br/>
firms for the summer through a connection with a neighbor.<br/>
He made the most of it, he loved it, pure pleasure.<br/>
Matt decided not to go to college, and the firm offered him a position  <br/>
as an assistant agent.<br/>
Not bad for an 18 year old who did not do well in school.<br/>
My dad was ok with the idea, but Matt&#39;s mom freaked out, although  <br/>
she&#39;s over it now that he is a success.<br/>
Matt ended up handling some of the agencies biggest accounts including  <br/>
Disney, the youngest agent on Broadway.<br/>
He is a great networker, and is well known in the Broadway community,  <br/>
where he has an excellent reputation.<br/>
He now works for another big agency that courted him and made him an  <br/>
associate.<br/>
<br/>
Matt has followed his passion.<br/>
All of his theatre friend&#39;s are jealous, because they went to college,  <br/>
but he is so further along in his career than any of them.<br/>
He also started his own production company and he has some very  <br/>
interesting things in the works.<br/>
I use him as an example  when people say you need an education to be a  <br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I are starting a business, and we have made Matt a  <br/>
partner because of his business savvy.<br/>
All  in all, not bad for a kid who did not like school!<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1297786505">When Amelia Bloomer popularized them<br/>
in the early-mid 19th century America,<br/>
they were very liberating for women,<br/>
much more comfortable and functional<br/>
than the costumes ladies of that era<br/>
were expected to wear.<br/>
<br/>
My Amelia, who loves to study history<br/>
through the lens of clothing/fashion,<br/>
reminded me of this.  She is 10, and<br/>
loves the strong Amelias of history,<br/>
of whom Earheart was only one.  Bloomer<br/>
often gets forgotten, but she popularized<br/>
pants for women.  It seemed a revolutionary<br/>
idea at the time.<br/>
