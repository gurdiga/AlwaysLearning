<div id="ygrps-yiv-732246724">odd i was thinkng the other day  how diffrent my girls are and  my hubby said <br/>
well they say even though the same woman raised them they swear they had a dif <br/>
mom.<br/>
just thought I would ask ya all you think the  growing up of mom had lots to <br/>
do with  the extreem diffrences in there personalties?<br/>
viki 25 in few days:<br/>
i was real into herbs and herb garding very poor and we hiked for entrtainment <br/>
and  went to ped mall and wore long skirts and  played in fountans and sang <br/>
folk music viki also slept mostly with me till she was 14 wore what she wanted <br/>
and  only restriction clouting and piercing and tats was no tats till 18  had <br/>
3 holes in ears one in nose at 17, she did do many other piercings after 18. <br/>
she played with make up every sience i can rember and i think she owns some <br/>
but doesnt wear it much.<br/>
niki 19 in 3 weeks:<br/>
I did the  suburban mom thing. was very very stepford with her. she was <br/>
allowed to wear makeup and choose most her own clouthing. she is my babrie <br/>
doll. not a hair out of place. dresses up counstly. expect her to pull up in a <br/>
pink car any day.room never a mess and probley the most responsible  of the 4 <br/>
children, she  did get her ears and belly button perced at 18 and is thinking <br/>
of a 1 inch tat if it can be hidden. I also must note when she was 16 i lost <br/>
150 lbs and shocked her, got way into leather and her dad and i started to <br/>
ride  again she is also my step daughter and I did not start raising her full <br/>
time till she was almost8.<br/>
Lisa 13:<br/>
she was adopted and is my bio niece has many problems from adhd to reactive <br/>
attachment dis order. she arived in our lives when i went wild again with <br/>
leather and so forth. she dont want  tats  does play with make up some but as <br/>
make up isnt a issue in our house dont bother much with it. she did pierch her <br/>
ears and has recently talked about piercing her belly button.she is also home <br/>
schooled as of last year, most of the rad issues have disapeared, and adhd <br/>
isnt a issue  at home we just dont give  all the directions and dont do <br/>
cirruclumn stuff so it isnt a issue. she loves to travel and her main goal in <br/>
life seems to be she wants to do something to make a diffrence in the world <br/>
she belives one person can make a diffrence. she is the most creative in <br/>
crafts and sewing and she  is self motavated and  has adaped her own style of  <br/>
every thing from clouthing to hair and in recent mo. her freinds are from all <br/>
walks of life and age groups she is the least judgmental of the 3 girls, sees <br/>
both the other girls as extreem  on diffrent sides one is very right wing <br/>
other very left wing lisa evaluates things for herself more and more and  as <br/>
she grows i see her think for herself isnt shocked at all  when mom  wears <br/>
leather or long skirts or looks like every other mom in area she wasnt shocked <br/>
when i died my hair red from yellow,isnt suprise when i wear high heals or go <br/>
barefoot,she got the best of both  as I age I find I want to be more like her <br/>
a lil of  what my mood strikes and more true to me. funny what unschooling in <br/>
what6 mo. can do to a family.<br/>
just a note  oldest girl wish I had  done same with her, yet enrolled her <br/>
daughter in  kindergaden this year. and is  moving her to dif school  already. <br/>
asked me other day do you worrie about moving lisa nope I dont,(we are alll <br/>
moving to diffrent homes soon odd we all doing it at once) Lisa made freinds <br/>
in new home whil we where looking at the home.it is her way. and i will <br/>
contunie to work in small town so she can always come see her freinds here and <br/>
she told viki when ya home school kid ya dont worrie so much about a new <br/>
school. you just worrie how to arrange your room.<br/>
should mention there is a boy also:<br/>

to me and every one quite like his dad.no motavation in any area. moved home a <br/>
year ago when he lost his car and house moving this week end in with girl <br/>

I think a lot of this has to do with birth order, too.  My mother was a hippy-wanna-be.  She would have lived on a commune and the whole 9 yards if she didn&#39;t have 5 kids.  We grew up in the city but we did so much stuff outside the city that we all learned there was a life outside of there.  Each one of us grew up to be totally different.  I am the closest one like my mother.  I go against the grain all the time.  My next 2 siblings, sister and brother, got heavily into drugs and drinking and really don&#39;t know where they belong in this world.  The next siblings are completely opposite to me.  They believe in the system and the whole bourgois way of life.  They want the big house with the black lacquer furniture and gold lamps and gaudy jobs and so on.  I would hate to live like that.  I like wood and antiques.  We are completely different persons.  You can hardly tell we grew up in the same house with the same mother.<br/>

dif <br/>
mom. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Even kids who are biologically matched and closer in age will have a <br/>
different experience with the same mom.  Partly birth order, partly the financial and <br/>
physical realities of their &quot;coming along.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With Kirby we were really poor, and most of his toys were from thrift stores.<br/>
<br/>
With Marty I was selling Discovery Toys so we had really wonderful toys, NEW! <br/>
 Lots!<br/>
<br/>
Holly played with all those, and got her whole new bunch of girl toys given <br/>
to her from every direction, for being the first girl in my husband&#39;s family <br/>
for two generations, for being the first girl in our social group...   She&#39;s <br/>
never really had to share a room, the boys have.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of differences.<br/>
<br/>
My sister and I are only 3.5 years apart, same dad and mom, and our <br/>
experiences of our dad, especially, are really different.    Once when we were in our <br/>
20s she was arguing with me about how he was with us, and I realized during <br/>
that conversation that MY experience of my dad was just between me and him.  We <br/>
had a relationship which was not the same as the relationship my sister had <br/>
with him, for who knows how many reasons.<br/>
<br/>
I understand the differences, and I think it&#39;s interesting that you brought <br/>
it up, Dee.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-742173595">think you may be right on that one I am the oldest also and most like my mom <br/>
in most areas. she also well now I think of it she did lol they have pic of me <br/>
getting out of vans ext carrying sighns.<br/>
sister under me is so oppiste  lives in mansion wont have any thing to do with <br/>
us when our mom died her kids told mine we thought she was dead already(my <br/>
oldest looked up her oldest ) none of them came to funrel.funny she is the odd <br/>
one in our family talk about rebalion! eddie under her has drinking and <br/>
wominizing problems but a great dad and   brother.<br/>
amanda well she has problems yecky realships 6 kids at least 2 of them adopted <br/>
out (I have one of em) her like the other sister wont talk to any the rest of <br/>
us cuz we didnt think agter her bf did what he did to lisa she should  stay <br/>
with the fater of her 3 youngest, and retain coustdy of lisa, swore it wouldnt <br/>
happen again. that was it for me, being the oldest  I am the care giver of <br/>
family,in lots ways.<br/>
so I guess you are right order may have lots to do with it. and lisa is lots <br/>
like me  even though she is youngest but  so far from the rest often she is <br/>
like a only child any more.<br/>
but odd how the pattern repeted I didnt notice till I read your post lol<br/>
Dee<br/>
fornately I do think there is more love with mine than my mothers children , <br/>
so far . or maybe that is a mothers view point. lol<br/>
