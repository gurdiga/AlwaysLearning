<div id="ygrps-yiv-1572227639">We have a four year old boy, and ever since he was born he&#39;s taken a long time to settle <br/>
down to sleep. He will act tired, even say he is tired and lie down. Within 5 minutes he&#39;ll <br/>
pop up again, and start jumping up and down. He has told me that he can&#39;t get his brain <br/>
to shut down, and on another occasion that when it gets dark his brain turns on. This <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be a problem, except for he is so obviously tired, and the next day everything is <br/>
harder for him. Things that normally wouldn&#39;t bother him send him into really hard crying.<br/>
<br/>
Until about February we had bedtimes (we only discovered unschooling in late 2007), <br/>
which sometimes led to 45 minutes of crying in bed before he would go to sleep. We never <br/>
left him alone, and it was pretty torturous for everybody involved.<br/>
<br/>
Since February it&#39;s been up and down, but with generally an easier time going to sleep. Just <br/>
recently I switched to working two nights a week (from three mornings), so I know that <br/>
we&#39;re going through a transition. He wants me all day, doesn&#39;t want me to leave his side, <br/>
even to go get something to eat. The nights when I&#39;m not here he&#39;s fine, but on the other <br/>
nights he&#39;s just had a really hard time winding down. The past few nights it&#39;s ended with <br/>
both of us in tears. Me just out of general tiredness and a lack of a few minutes to myself, <br/>
and him because I won&#39;t do something he wants me to do, or because the show he wants <br/>
to watch isn&#39;t on, or something like that. Then he&#39;ll cry for a few minutes until he goes to <br/>
sleep. It seems to help him go to sleep -- I think because it stops his brain from whirring <br/>
around if he&#39;s focussing on something else (this happens to me to, both my mom and I <br/>
have trouble going to sleep and staying asleep). But clearly this isn&#39;t what I want for our <br/>
family. Several times we&#39;ve even told him, &#39;Just go to sleep&#39; which isn&#39;t really what I want to <br/>
be doing, especially since I said it in quite an irritated tone of voice!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to spend more time with him, and say yes more, because it seems like he has <br/>
that need. We&#39;ve been driving around a couple of nights a week, but he doesn&#39;t always stay <br/>
asleep when we bring him inside, and if he wakes up it extends his going to sleep by at <br/>
least an hour. When he has a baby if he slept for even five minutes in the car, it would <br/>
delay bedtime for about 45 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any suggestions for us to get through this transition? And for me to <br/>
keep my patience?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You haven&#39;t mentioned how you encourage sleep, other than to drive  <br/>
around in the car. Do you or your partner lay down/sleep with him at  <br/>
night? Do you have some going-to-bed rituals, say turning the lights  <br/>
low, having a bath with him, reading or telling a story, watching a  <br/>
video, rubbing his back, cuddling him? He seems to need you more, as  <br/>
you say, and doing those types of things for him can help.<br/>
<br/>
If you are doing all those things already, it&#39;s possible that he has a  <br/>
different rhythm to his sleep cycles that don&#39;t match yours. You say  <br/>
he&#39;s always had trouble settling down. I assume that&#39;s in part because  <br/>
you imposed a bedtime on him that doesn&#39;t match his bodily rhythm.  <br/>
Lots of kids come to life late in the evening. That doesn&#39;t mean you  <br/>
can&#39;t encourage sleep when you see that he&#39;s tired. But you can adjust  <br/>
your expectations about the timing.<br/>
<br/>
My dd, from babyhood, did not really settle down until at least 11  <br/>
p.m. at night. I found a way to adjust to that, and since she slept  <br/>
with us, eventually my sleep-wake cycle changed to accommodate hers. I  <br/>
think I&#39;m still on that cycle, even though she&#39;s 13 and stays up way  <br/>
later than I can &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 <br/>
Storm and I are both like this. Before I found my own  solution, it used to <br/>
take me hours to fall asleep. Dark, quiet room, comfortable  bed, sleepy self, <br/>
yet an hour was the shortest time-no matter how tired I was-I  could fall <br/>
asleep in, sometimes 2, 3 even 4 or more hours. (In bed next to a guy  who can <br/>
fall asleep in 30 seconds with light, noise and in an uncomfortable  <br/>
position-very frustrating). Books don&#39;t do it for me, they just encourage my  brain to go. <br/>
Movies, too, though to a lesser degree. Hand-held video games, on  the other <br/>
hand, are a sure-fire solution. I started out with a cheap Solitaire  game, <br/>
went to a Monopoly game, and then to Game Boys. It took a while for me  (over 30 <br/>
at the time) to get &quot;bored&quot; enough with the game for it to work, but  they <br/>
occupy my brain *just enough* to keep it from going to exciting things, yet  if <br/>
I have the right game (something with lots of repetition), it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
stimulate my brain. These days, I&#39;ve gotten to the point that on a good night, I  can <br/>
be asleep within 5 minutes-with a video game. They don&#39;t even have to be  <br/>
that boring or repetitive any more. Storm also has trouble with lights, movies,  <br/>
t.v., movement, etc., and hand held video games work for him, as well. There <br/>
are  games that help him fall asleep more quickly than others, I&#39;ve noticed, <br/>
but I  don&#39;t usually try to influence his choice of game at night. He&#39;s been <br/>
playing  them since he was between 18 months and 2 years old, and has gotten to <br/>
the point  in the month since he&#39;s turned 4, to where he&#39;s now handing me the <br/>
Gameboy,  saying, &quot;I&#39;m done.&quot; and turning over to fall asleep while I put it in <br/>
the basket  by our bed.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if it works for others, but it has been  *wonderful* for <br/>
inducing sleep, here.<br/>

she would be good to go for 7 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Assuming she is ready to go in to bed, when I read to Jayn in bed she falls <br/>
asleep almost at once, even when she is interested in the story. It may be <br/>
the rhythm of my reading aloud. It has the same soporific effect on my dh. <br/>
If she is not ready nothing will induce sleep.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t equal &quot;no bedtimes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about not having arbitrary rules override choices in  <br/>
the moment.  If you want to stay up later one night or let your child  <br/>
stay up later or sleep somewhere besides right where you tell him to  <br/>
right when you tell him to, be flexible!<br/>
<br/>
-=-He has told me that he can&#39;t get his brain to shut down, and on  <br/>

<br/>
I understand that feeling.  What about recorded books he can listen  <br/>
to on an iPod or Mp3 player?  Or a little DVD player with headphones?<br/>
<br/>
I would tell him that sleep is necessary and that when he&#39;s bigger he  <br/>
can stay up, but now he needs to sleep when you sleep, but make it  <br/>
inviting and comfortable if you can.<br/>
<br/>

really what I want to be doing, especially since I said it in quite  <br/>

<br/>
Sometimes there&#39;s no way around that, when there isn&#39;t another adult  <br/>
you can put the child with.  For a while we had three adults in the  <br/>
house and that was helpful for Holly.  When it was just me, when  <br/>
Keith was in Minneapolis working and the kids were young, there were  <br/>
times I was more sleepy than I was patient.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Drugs?  He won&#39;t be four forever.  It might seem like forever when  <br/>
you&#39;re exhausted.   Will a long warm play-in-the-tub bath get him  <br/>
sleepy?   Milk and cake?  Hot chocolate?  Turkey and cheese?<br/>

I had some on cassette tape, and my kids didn&#39;t love them (but I  <br/>
did!).   Marty did like one thing, though, that was a draw-along tape  <br/>
about the circus.  It would set the scene, describing how the tent  <br/>
was put up with the help of elephants, and how big the poles and  <br/>
ropes were or some such, and who all was there, and then after a  <br/>
while it would leave just music so the kid could draw a picture, and  <br/>
Marty would fall asleep to that night after night for a while.<br/>
<br/>
For another long while he would fall asleep watching Dumbo in the  <br/>
living room.<br/>

Holly takes 40 minutes to fall asleep.  Me, seconds.  If I&#39;m tired,  <br/>
about ten seconds.  If I&#39;ve gone to bed because it&#39;s time, because I  <br/>
need to be up in 8 hours or something, maybe fifteen minutes, reading  <br/>
magazines.  I don&#39;t read books much to sleep.  They get me interested  <br/>
and I need to get to a stopping place and if I drop it it&#39;s noisy (or  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-350684309">We also all go to bed around the same time (usually). We have twin 3 year olds who struggle with going to bed sometimes. One of them seems to get more active when he gets sleepy! When we notice sleepiness we begin winding things down in the house! Mom and Dad usually end up in a recliner with a book, lights are dimmed, because it is winter here Daddy starts a fire, etc. It seems that when the boys see all of this they automatically begin changing their activities too. They pull out the quiet legos, cars, etc. and sit behind the couches and play. What has really made a drastic change is when we are heading off to bed, we ask the boys if they are ready to go around and turn off all the lights! We hoped that by making them active participants in preparing for bed they would be more willing. They love it, and up to this point have wanted to do it! After turning off all of the lights they automatically head up for bed, on their own! Everybody is happy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Zach (17) did this too, when he was 3 - 6 or so.  We would put Dumbo  <br/>
on one TV for him, with headphones, and position him so he couldn&#39;t  <br/>
see our TV with our movie. He was in the same room with us, but  <br/>
watching and listening to Dumbo (and eventually falling asleep) while  <br/>
we watched our grown-up movie.<br/>
<br/>
When he was little, Zach took a long time to fall asleep even with me  <br/>
next to him. I&#39;d listen to his breathing for what sometimes took up to  <br/>
an hour, then wait a good ten minutes after I knew he&#39;d fallen asleep  <br/>
before getting back up to spend some time with dh.  Most nights I fell  <br/>
asleep along side him though. When he was really little, toddlerish  <br/>
and younger, he&#39;d wake up every 15 minutes if I wasn&#39;t next to him.<br/>
<br/>
Zoe (11 now) on the other hand, fell asleep fast and stayed asleep  <br/>
even if I got up, but.. she wouldn&#39;t fall asleep on car rides - which  <br/>
almost always worked for lulling Zach to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Zach is a night-owl with a natural sleeping time of about 2-3  <br/>
a.m. but since he started working and has to be at work sometimes at  <br/>
8:30 a.m., he juggles his bedtime a bit.  He&#39;s still figuring it out  <br/>
and uses melatonin occasionally to help him get to sleep when he knows  <br/>
he needs to be up the next morning. Zoe tends towards a later bedtime  <br/>
than me and since I started a job last summer that required an  <br/>
occasional 6 a.m. wake up time, she&#39;s adjusted to having her brother  <br/>
or dad hang out with her until she goes to bed. THey took over the  <br/>
bedtime rituals with her - reading etc.<br/>
<br/>
Dh, is a night owl too, so I&#39;m outnumbered.  For some unexplainable  <br/>
reason, I used to get quite livid about his staying up so late even  <br/>
though he was able to manage his business just fine during the day.  I  <br/>
got over it and now relish my quiet mornings to myself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some of you whose kids seem to not be able to sleep even though they  <br/>
are very sleepy are probably dealing with RLS. It isn&#39;t terribly  <br/>
uncommon - maybe as many as 10 percent of people have it over the  <br/>
course of a lifetime, and a significant percentage of people have it  <br/>
as children. It is almost never diagnosed in children, most people  <br/>
brush it off as &quot;growing pains&quot; or even as a form of hyperactivity. I  <br/>
used to tell my mom, night after night, that my legs &quot;wanted to run&quot;  <br/>
even when I wanted to sleep. It isn&#39;t anything to take lightly, it is  <br/>
pure agony and has serious health repercussions. It is another good  <br/>
reason to sleep with your child because if you&#39;re sending them off to  <br/>
sleep alone, you won&#39;t realize how awful the constant overwhelming  <br/>
urge to move the legs is.  It may or may not involve actual pain -  <br/>
mine does, but some people describe it as &quot;ants under the skin&quot;  <br/>
discomfort. People with RLS become depressed and have lots of other  <br/>
serious health issues that all have chronic lack of decent sleep as  <br/>
the root cause.<br/>
<br/>
Light leg massage is a wonder for children with RLS - and distraction  <br/>
is almost essential (listening too books on my iPod nano is my  <br/>
favorite distraction - it has a sleep timer, so shuts itself off).   <br/>
For help getting to sleep, when sleepy but too mentally active to  <br/>
relax, melatonin can be wonderful. It is the one thing that gives a  <br/>
truly deep good sleep - not drug-induced, but natural. Don&#39;t give them  <br/>
over-the-counter sleep medications - they usually have benadryl  <br/>
(antihistamine) in them (including tylenol pm, etc) - benadryl  <br/>
aggravates RLS in most people.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, if your child complains that their can&#39;t hold their legs still  <br/>
or that their legs feel creepy or weird or tingly or excited or achy  <br/>
or painful, consider the possibility of RLS. It is genetic, but not a  <br/>
simple pass-down from parent to child - it seems to be the result of a  <br/>
series of genes, not just one. Still it does run in families.<br/>

<br/>
Several people have mentioned this. Is it safe to use with a four-year-old? I don&#39;t want <br/>
everyone to think that I&#39;m jumping straight onto medication as the answer, except that <br/>
we&#39;ve tried sooooo many things, including videos and gameboys and books and baths etc. <br/>
The problem with many of the conventional bedtime things is that he thinks we&#39;re trying to <br/>
trick him. After being forced to go to bed for so long, he&#39;s only just getting to the point <br/>
where he&#39;ll even let me read books to him, before he&#39;d say something like, &quot;but I&#39;m not <br/>
ready to go to sleep&quot; as that was part of our bedtime routine when we were forcing him to <br/>
stay in bed.<br/>
<br/>
Some nights playing his gameboy works, or watching videos. It&#39;s those nights when <br/>
nothing seems to work. I&#39;ll definitely try to ask him about his legs, to see if it might be <br/>
RLS. I don&#39;t think so, but it&#39;s a good idea. Just from listening to him talk when he&#39;s going <br/>
to sleep or driving in the car, I&#39;m pretty sure his mind is just spinning. He takes in <br/>
information voraciously, and is curious about everything, which is great except I don&#39;t <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-952507357">&#39;Unschooling doesn&#39;t equal &quot;no bedtimes.&quot;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right, but this is something I didn&#39;t understand at first. There are definitely some <br/>
groups out there that give a different idea, and we just went a little far in not helping him, <br/>
at first. Then, I think, we didn&#39;t really know what to do for awhile. (this goes for <br/>
everything, not just bedtimes) Now I feel like we&#39;ve got a pretty good handle on other <br/>
issues, but sleeping has so far eluded us. We need to figure it out because he keeps his <br/>
little brother (2) up as well. Normally Evan just comes to me and says &quot;I&#39;m tired&quot; and is <br/>
asleep in 10 min. But if Deacon is up too, it doesn&#39;t go so smoothly!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I understand that feeling.  What about recorded books he can listen  to on an iPod or Mp3 <br/>
player?  Or a little DVD player with headphones?<br/>
 <br/>
 I would tell him that sleep is necessary and that when he&#39;s bigger he  can stay up, but <br/>
now he needs to sleep when you sleep, but make it  inviting and comfortable if you can.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to get him listening to stories, I&#39;ve done some looking but haven&#39;t found ones <br/>
Ithink he&#39;d like. It needs to be longer, but not scary. He&#39;s sensitive to people not being <br/>
nice. Alot of the longer ones are for older kids and I&#39;m concerned they might be scary. <br/>
Anyone have any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He won&#39;t be four forever.  It might seem like forever when you&#39;re exhausted.&quot;<br/>

&gt;  &lt;&lt;&lt;I think because it stops his brain from whirring<br/>
&gt;  around  if he&#39;s focussing on something else (this happens to me to, both my<br/>
&gt;  mom and I<br/>
&gt;  have trouble going to sleep and staying asleep).  &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Storm and I are both like this. Before I found my own  solution, it used to<br/>
&gt;  take me hours to fall asleep. Dark, quiet room, comfortable  bed, sleepy self,<br/>
&gt;  yet an hour was the shortest time-no matter how tired I was-I  could fall<br/>
&gt;  asleep in, sometimes 2, 3 even 4 or more hours. (In bed next to a guy  who can<br/>
&gt;  fall asleep in 30 seconds with light, noise and in an uncomfortable<br/>
&gt;  position-very frustrating). Books don&#39;t do it for me, they just encourage my  brain to go.<br/>
&gt;  Movies, too, though to a lesser degree. Hand-held video games, on  the other<br/>
&gt;  hand, are a sure-fire solution. I started out with a cheap Solitaire  game,<br/>
&gt;  went to a Monopoly game, and then to Game Boys. It took a while for me  (over 30<br/>
&gt;  at the time) to get &quot;bored&quot; enough with the game for it to work, but  they<br/>
&gt;  occupy my brain *just enough* to keep it from going to exciting things, yet  if<br/>
&gt;  I have the right game (something with lots of repetition), it doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  stimulate my brain. These days, I&#39;ve gotten to the point that on a good night, I  can<br/>
&gt;  be asleep within 5 minutes-with a video game. They don&#39;t even have to be<br/>
&gt;  that boring or repetitive any more. Storm also has trouble with lights, movies,<br/>
&gt;  t.v., movement, etc., and hand held video games work for him, as well. There<br/>
&gt;  are  games that help him fall asleep more quickly than others, I&#39;ve noticed,<br/>
&gt;  but I  don&#39;t usually try to influence his choice of game at night. He&#39;s been<br/>
&gt;  playing  them since he was between 18 months and 2 years old, and has gotten to<br/>
&gt;  the point  in the month since he&#39;s turned 4, to where he&#39;s now handing me the<br/>
&gt;  Gameboy,  saying, &quot;I&#39;m done.&quot; and turning over to fall asleep while I put it in<br/>
&gt;  the basket  by our bed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  I don&#39;t know if it works for others, but it has been  *wonderful* for<br/>
&gt;  inducing sleep, here.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know this may seem contrary to sleep inducing activities, but Margaux<br/>
has been like this too, and when she does that, we let her jump on the<br/>
trampoline and get totally out of breath and then try again to fall<br/>
asleep.  We call it getting your yaya&#39;s out before climbing to bed! <br/>
Sometimes it works amazingly well.  Sometimes it takes about an hour<br/>
until she is exhausted enough to settle down, but during that time,<br/>
nobody is crying or upset.  I usually take the time to swap out a load<br/>
of laundry and fold and put away a load of clothes, or read in bed.  I<br/>
don&#39;t do any of the normal daily activities, I try to keep it like<br/>
nighttime activities, in the bedroom part of the house.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been driving around a couple of nights a week, but he doesn&#39;t<br/>
always stay<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; delay bedtime for about 45 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Driving rarely made Margaux fall asleep.  She&#39;ll even stay awake on very<br/>
long road trips, the whole time, like well over 24 hrs.  She&#39;s stayed<br/>
awake on a road trip from Oregon to New Mexico before and it was about<br/>
30 hrs.  During that time she would doze for about 5-10 mins every few<br/>
hours and then pop her eyes open to see more.  My older daughter<br/>
would&#39;ve slept about half that time, and she would generally fall asleep<br/>
in the car and stay asleep.  When she was a baby, she wore a hat that<br/>
would slip down onto her eyes and it would keep it dark and keep her<br/>
asleep when we went from dark car at night to lights in a house.  It<br/>
wasn&#39;t a planned intent when we bought that hat, but it turned out to be<br/>
a, can&#39;t leave home without it sort of hat!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; keep my patience?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve watched movies, listened to books on cd, played the DS, read<br/>
books, given massages, burned lavendar candles, given baths, dimmed<br/>
lights, put special lights on, eaten food, played with dolls in bed,<br/>
played with laptops side by side in bed.  Some of it worked better than<br/>
other things, but not because of the thing itself, mostly things worked<br/>
better simply because someone was more tired that particular time than<br/>
another.  It makes more sense to make the sleeping time fun and<br/>
peaceful.  Even though, all those things can be done during the daytime,<br/>
we make them more nighttime by removing ourselves from daytime activity<br/>
spaces and go into the bedroom.<br/>
<br/>
By far, the very best way to get Marguax to sleep well, is to do<br/>
something very tiring during the daytime, long walks, lots of outdoor<br/>
play, science museum, zoo, new and different and exciting sensory kind<br/>
of things that involve physical activity.  On days that we aren&#39;t able<br/>
to do that, we bring out the trampoline, or play with the dog or chase<br/>
the cats around with toys, or tumble on pillows in the living room, or<br/>
play DDR, or rake leaves, or pull weeds, or jump rope, or hoola hoop, or<br/>
or or, etc.</div>

My comment was about drugs for the mom to be calm.  (The question was  <br/>
about changing the mom&#39;s attitude or something, I think.)<br/>

My mom had a cousin who used to give each of her several children a  <br/>

you could go down to the drugstore and buy opium by the bottle.<br/>

I don&#39;t guess drugging kids is a good idea at all, but now that my  <br/>

&gt; Some of you whose kids seem to not be able to sleep even though they<br/>
&gt; are very sleepy are probably dealing with RLS. It isn&#39;t terribly<br/>
&gt; uncommon - maybe as many as 10 percent of people have it over the<br/>
&gt; course of a lifetime, and a significant percentage of people have it<br/>
&gt; as children. It is almost never diagnosed in children, most people<br/>
&gt; brush it off as &quot;growing pains&quot; or even as a form of hyperactivity.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All three of my children sleep better after a leg massage. Aurora (who is<br/>
5.5 months old) settles down much better after I rub her hips and upper<br/>
legs. For Rowan, who&#39;s 6 and has catastrophic growth spurts, I rub the<br/>
length of his legs and feet, and I also give him... oh, the name&#39;s escaping<br/>
me right now, but there&#39;s a homeopathic remedy for growing pains. Kestrel<br/>
just likes all over touch, so I tend to rub his back.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think &quot;growth pains&quot; should be dismissed at all; I remember growth<br/>
spurts as being uncomfortable, and I can imagine that while there are things<br/>
to concentrate on, they could be pushed back, but once it&#39;s dark and quiet,<br/>
the discomfort would become way more noticeable.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;The problem with many of the conventional bedtime things is  that he <br/>
thinks we&#39;re trying to <br/>
trick him. After being forced to go to bed  for so long, he&#39;s only just <br/>
getting to the point <br/>
where he&#39;ll even let me  read books to him, before he&#39;d say something like, <br/>
&quot;but I&#39;m not <br/>
ready to  go to sleep&quot; as that was part of our bedtime routine when we were <br/>
forcing him  to <br/>
stay in bed.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When Storm started feeling like bedtime was inflexible, we  started being <br/>
sure we read books and played video games at different times  during the day, not <br/>
just after dark or &quot;at bedtime&quot;. Also, when he&#39;d want to  make a trip <br/>
downstairs (that was his way of gauging whether or not he was &quot;being  made to&quot; do <br/>
&quot;bedtime&quot;), I&#39;d ask what he needed, offer to get it myself or have  someone else <br/>
bring it up, and if he still wanted to get it, it was fine.  Sometimes a trip <br/>
for a cup of milk would take 20 minutes, but I either joined  him and the rest <br/>
of the family downstairs for a while or, more often, I would  just wait <br/>
upstairs for him to come back.<br/>
 <br/>
Another thing that helped with the transition from &quot;living  area&quot; to <br/>
&quot;sleeping area&quot; was some sort of a game. Chase was a popular one for a  while, with <br/>
variations on who was chasing and who was escaping, always ending on  the bed <br/>
with great roars and giggles. Another was tossing on the bed, where I&#39;d  put his <br/>
belly on my shoulder and count to 3, then toss him (using his legs for  <br/>
leverage) onto the bed with a *bounce*. A game of tickle sometimes works, but he  <br/>
just doesn&#39;t seem to like that at bedtime, for some reason. Very recently, he&#39;s <br/>
 been interested in helping Malachi, his Cabbage Patch doll, get ready for <br/>
bed:  changing clothes, snuggling, tucking into bed, combing hair. When it <br/>
becomes too  routine or resistant, we just change things up and try something new.  <br/>
Inspiration comes from strange sources, sometimes-I never would have thought  <br/>
active things like &quot;chase&quot; or bed-tossing would be conductive to sleep, but I <br/>
 think they make the bedroom and bed a fun area rather than something to be  <br/>
dreaded for Storm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-84156731">Have you considered it may just be the way his mind works?  I&#39;ve been that<br/>

seeing shapes while playing with the Gameboy, or using other objects as<br/>
accompaniment to whatever is rolling through my mind.  Karl makes new<br/>
chapters for his ongoing stories at bedtime & drifts off to sleep.  Then I<br/>
lie awake for a while longer.  My mind jumps from thing to thing.  I&#39;m very<br/>
used to it.<br/>
<br/>
Action and exercise get Karl to sleep when he&#39;s wakeful, and the small<br/>
indoor trampoline is the ticket at those times. When he&#39;s sleepy the Gameboy<br/>
or DS is perfect, and he plays during the day so it&#39;s not new or exciting<br/>
but old hat.  He used to draw or color at night and I put the markers on the<br/>

***My doctor recommended melotonin for my 7 and 5 yo old.  Lower doses are often better.  If you get a pill you can cut off a piece.  Start with as little as .5 ml.  Samuel almost never needs it, unless sleep has been rare and he is sick or we have a very busy week and we are trying to get him down extra early.  Eli has RLS I&#39;m sure and sometimes lays in bed for hours without being able to fall asleep.  Melotonin normally works in minutes.  Samuel has it once every few months, Eli once every few weeks.  Everything I&#39;ve read says it is safe, however I would not use too often as it is feared it could lower the body&#39;s natural production.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-749002128">&quot;Have you considered it may just be the way his mind works?  I&#39;ve been that way since I <br/>
was a kid.  I can be thinking about black holes or anagrams or seeing shapes while <br/>
playing with the Gameboy, or using other objects as accompaniment to whatever is rolling <br/>
through my mind.  Karl makes new chapters for his ongoing stories at bedtime & drifts off <br/>
to sleep.  Then I lie awake for a while longer.  My mind jumps from thing to thing.  I&#39;m very <br/>
used to it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m SURE it&#39;s the way his mind works. Mainly because of remembering what it was like <br/>
for me as a child, laying awake for hours before I could go to sleep. He&#39;s already ahead of <br/>
the game, compared to where I was as a child. Once he goes to sleep, he stays asleep, as <br/>
long as he&#39;s near us. We cosleep so that&#39;s not a problem. And I agree, he will get used to <br/>
it, and learn coping mechanisms to help himself go to sleep. What I want to do is help that <br/>
process along a little, just give him some ideas. It took me until my mid-twenties to really <br/>
learn how to fall asleep, and some times I still have trouble. When I lay awake with my <br/>
mind spinning, it is not pleasant. He&#39;s alot like me, so I have to be careful not to draw <br/>
parallels willy-nilly, but I do believe that he Is sometimes bothered by it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve already ordered some stories from the library that he can listen too, and I know that I <br/>
also need to get us outdoors more. It does help him. In the winter it&#39;s difficult, as he&#39;s <br/>
sensitive in many other ways, as well, to cold, wet, etc. He prefers the regularity of <br/>
indoors, even in the summer. But there are some outdoor things he really likes to do, and <br/>
there&#39;s a gymnastics open time that he really enjoys, which we won&#39;t be able to go to for a <br/>
couple of weeks, as his thumb was slammed in the door last night by his little brother. He <br/>
lost his thumbnail, but he did sleep really well after spending a couple of hours at the ER!<br/>
<br/>
I also really like the idea of a trampoline, will be heading to Craigslist momentarily!<br/>

&gt; Action and exercise get Karl to sleep when he&#39;s wakeful, and the small<br/>
&gt; indoor trampoline is the ticket at those times. When he&#39;s sleepy the Gameboy<br/>
&gt; or DS is perfect, and he plays during the day so it&#39;s not new or exciting<br/>
&gt; but old hat.  He used to draw or color at night and I put the markers on the<br/>
&gt; table after he fell asleep.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  Some nights playing his gameboy works, or watching videos. It&#39;s those<br/>
&gt; nights when<br/>
&gt; &gt;  nothing seems to work. I&#39;ll definitely try to ask him about his legs, to<br/>
&gt; see if it might be<br/>
&gt; &gt;  RLS. I don&#39;t think so, but it&#39;s a good idea. Just from listening to him<br/>
&gt; talk when he&#39;s going<br/>
&gt; &gt;  to sleep or driving in the car, I&#39;m pretty sure his mind is just<br/>
&gt; spinning. He takes in<br/>
&gt; &gt;  information voraciously, and is curious about everything, which is great<br/>
&gt; except I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt;  think that he can always turn it off. He&#39;ll go from asking about what<br/>
&gt; makes eardrums work<br/>
&gt; &gt;  to what&#39;s inside a black hole and on and on. When he&#39;s really tired he<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t even pause for<br/>
&gt; &gt;  answers.<br/>

Do it gently, so he knows it is really okay if he wants to go to sleep  <br/>
- but lighten up the whole topic by playing around a little.<br/>
<br/>
I used to fall asleep while reading sometimes. It was funny -  <br/>
apparently I&#39;d slowly drift into reciting a grocery shopping list and  <br/>
then just stop talking. After I realized what I was doing, sometimes  <br/>
I&#39;d do it on purpose to entertain the kids. You could do something  <br/>
like that, too, to lighten up the atmosphere around the whole issue of  <br/>
sleep.<br/>

your head &lt;BEG&gt;. It is a processing problem in the way the brain uses  <br/>
dopamine - a glitch in the dopamine receptors.<br/>
<br/>
But, muscle relaxants don&#39;t do anything for it at all. It is not  <br/>
musculature that is the problem. Most doctors are still pretty  <br/>
ignorant about it and will frequently prescribe muscle relaxants or  <br/>
sleeping pills or anti-depressants. Then you give horrible heeby-jeeby  <br/>
legs PLUS you feel too rubbery to do  anything or too zonked out.   <br/>
There are things that can help and there are drugs that act directly  <br/>
on the dopamine receptors in the brain.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t pursue this, but it is almost NEVER something parents  <br/>
consider with their children. As someone who suffered a lot from it as  <br/>
a child, I sure wish at least I&#39;d have been believed that it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
just me being &quot;over-tired&quot; - that&#39;s why my parents used to say. I felt  <br/>
like it was my fault - my punishment for playing too hard (I was a  <br/>
tomboy in the 50&#39;s when that was still a bit uncool, girls had to wear  <br/>
dresses and act like girls).<br/>
