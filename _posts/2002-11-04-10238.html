a great Jamie. Sean and Alan, now THERE&#39;s a movie. ;)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve just started re-reading the Outlander series this week. I can&#39;t come up <br/>
with an actor to play Jamie if they ever did a movie of it, though. I guess <br/>
nobody is matching the mental image I have of him!<br/>

this topic constantly strays away from unschooling....<br/>

I guess not following a curriculum gives us plenty of time to think <br/>
about other things....like Mr Rickman ;-)<br/>
