If you&#39;re on another list that&#39;s more into politics and laws, that  <br/>
would be a better place to take this.  It&#39;s not about how people  <br/>
learn, and California law has never had &quot;homeschooling&quot; legal  <br/>
anyway.  It&#39;s a local issue.   It will be taken care of in California.<br/>

  Since it&#39;s a California issue and not related to unschooling, you might want to join one of the California homeschooling yahoo groups to discuss and read about this issue. The HSC (HomeSchool Association of California) is very active on the subject right now. The addy is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CA-Homeschooling-HSC/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/CA-Homeschooling-HSC/</a><br/>
