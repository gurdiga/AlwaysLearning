&lt;&lt; The last straw for me on that list was when a woman said <br/>
she needed advice because her daughter was getting too involved in <br/>
her geography lessons (from the aforementioned textbooks) and wanted <br/>
to spend all day on geography &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the first homeschooling advisement situations I ever found myself in <br/>
was a mom of twins saying her daughter would do three or four English lessons <br/>
a DAY if her mom didn&#39;t stop  her.  And she HAD to slow down so she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
get ahead of her twin brother.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked &quot;Why?  Why can&#39;t she be ahead of her brother?  And he could be <br/>
ahead of her in some other stuff.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The mom told me obviously I had NO idea what it was like to have twins. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But we became good friends and she just e-mailed me a couple of weeks ago for <br/>
help making a medieval hat (she sent a photo) for her daughter&#39;s wedding! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
