<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506179624">Oh hey, Karin...<br/>
I forgot to thank you for not minding my horrid handwriting.<br/>
I don&#39;t really care, but it&#39;s sometimes embarrassing at work because everyone <br/>

I just believe that it&#39;s my artistic, freedom loving side showing up.<br/>
At least that&#39;s my justification for the barely legible scrawl!!<br/>
