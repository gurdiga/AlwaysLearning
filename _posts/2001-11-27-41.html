<br>Makana,
<br>
<br>It&#39;s okay if things get stirred up. &nbsp;I think poking people where they&#39;re comfortable is a productive use of a list. &nbsp;&nbsp;We don&#39;t all have to be encouraging of everything anyone else comes up with.
<br>
<br>I was thinking about the chess analogy, and the points worked as an analogy really well, as far as immediate expenditure, but I had some other thoughts. &nbsp;That kind of money isn&#39;t spent on a beginning chess player, only a small percentage of the best. &nbsp;Gamers have to lay out maybe $25 just to get in the game sometimes. &nbsp;(Unless they hang out with a group of people who each can contribute a dozen cards to design them a deck, which does happen for sure.) &nbsp;
<br>
<br>And the chess analogy looked back upon ten years later will have less detritus than years of CCG (collectible card game) or miniatures gaming. &nbsp;On the other other hand, that detritus does sell on e-bay.
<br>
<br>My kids used to love getting new Pogs. &nbsp;It gave them joy, frenzied delight, visions of electric sugarplums. &nbsp;Now there are ziploc bags of pogs in boxes here and there. &nbsp;Someday some younger kid not yet born now is going to have a GREAT few hours going through those, claiming the best as a new treasure, putting most back in the bags as weird old stuff, and a few will probably make it a hundred years into the future to be oddities in some future person&#39;s collection of antiques. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>How evil is that? &nbsp;
<br>
<br>It is odd, but it&#39;s not immoral.
<br>
<br>I was indignant when I was in college and a friend from a wealthy family bought her mother a miniature flyswatter (dollhouse size) for $5. &nbsp;I was from a poor family, and in the early 1970&#39;s $5 was, for me, a lot of money. &nbsp;&nbsp;My friend defended the purchase, saying it was art, and that her mom would really appreciate it.
<br>
<br>I later saw her mom&#39;s dollhouse, and it was marvelous, funky, glorious, and will someday be in a museum for thousands to see. &nbsp;I no longer begrudged her the fine-wire piece of flyswatter art. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it had never been found at Christmas. &nbsp;It was wrapped up miniaturely and fastened to another package and was lost without her mom ever having seen it. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>So was that a loss of $5 or a good lesson for me? &nbsp;Here I am 27 years later still thinking about it.
