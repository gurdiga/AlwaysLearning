<div id="ygrps-yiv-753803676">One of the most important things I learned from reading here is how much I<br/>
need to nurture my relationship with my husband--that the principles of<br/>
unschooling are necessary for US, not just for our children. It sounds<br/>
silly to say it now, because it seems like common sense, something I<br/>
should&#39;ve just known. Thank you for that, Sandra. My whole family is<br/>
happier and learning so much more because of what you&#39;ve taken the time and<br/>
effort to share here.<br/>
