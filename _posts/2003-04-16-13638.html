  Yesterday I found my first gray hair, a <br/>
  little tiny one in my bangs. I was so excited, I yelled for my dh to come and <br/>
  look. He exclaimed,  &quot;you better pull it out!!!&quot; I looked at him like he was <br/>
  nuts. I said, &quot;no it is my first hair of wisdom and I plan on keeping it.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240107511">I&#39;m teaching in a middle school now.<br/>
<br/>
Last time i was teaching in a middle school was 12 years ago.  I was in <br/>
my later 20&#39;s.  One day during my first week I was walking down the hall <br/>
with a Coke in my hand and a teacher asked what I was doing out of class <br/>
and why did I have a coke, students weren&#39;t allowed coke at school.<br/>
<br/>
I have so much grey and much earned lines--sadly, no one will mistake me <br/>
for a student now.  :-(  But, I think it makes me look good, I would <br/>
never dye them, ok, never say never... but for now I&#39;m happy with them.<br/>

been feeling pretty frumpy, so I bought some and wore it out with dh <br/>
Saturday night.  All night, I felt like a clown.  No white or silver <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582273170">I&#39;m just sticking with a little eye liner.  My lashes are very pale, but <br/>
I can&#39;t do mascara because I wear contacts and &quot;Murphy&#39;s Law&quot;  the <br/>
minute I put on mascara I get a hair or something stuck to my contact <br/>
and then I just get a big mess as I try to rinse my eye out.  I guess <br/>
life&#39;s too short to mess around with trying to be what I&#39;m not.  I do <br/>
think it&#39;s fun to do other people up, though.  So I can understand how <br/>

hair.  LOL.  I always look at the women with the perfectly dressed children <br/>
and the perfect clothes, hair and make up all in place and wonder how they do <br/>
it.  They must be busy at home making everything look good.  I wonder if they <br/>
do that every day or just when they have to go out?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-614859196">If I pull my hair up there&#39;s a lot of grey.  When it&#39;s down, not so much <br/>
shows, but just lately (a year or two) some of the gray is as long as my hair <br/>
(waist length grey).  <br/>
<br/>
My first grey hair, I pulled, taped to a black paper and sent it to my mom.<br/>
I thought it was cool!  I thought she would care.   Same as first tooth, <br/>
first period, first child.<br/>
<br/>
Friends of mine were appalled, though.  They said it was cruel.<br/>
I didn&#39;t think so.  If one of my kids showed me a grey hair, why would that <br/>
be mean?  Would it surprise me with my own age all of a sudden?  I&#39;ve never <br/>
lied about my age or pretended.<br/>
<br/>
Like Joylyn, I looked very young for a long time.  When I was teaching, 9th <br/>
grade hall patrols would ask for my pass.  I was told I couldn&#39;t check books <br/>
out the last week of school.  I said &quot;But I&#39;m a teacher.&quot;  The library aide <br/>
looked at me like I was the world&#39;s bravest liar.<br/>
<br/>
But in the past ten years it caught up.  Now I look my age.  Some days I look <br/>
the age of those older than I am!! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care.  My friends never chose me for my looks anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I find that there&#39;s a definite pattern.  I&#39;m nearly seventeen years older <br/>
than I was when Kirby was born.  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>During the actual process they numb you so you don&#39;t have pain while the <br/>
needle is at work. Now then, when the numbness wears off, OMG not only you <br/>
you hurt, but you look like someone beat the crap out of your face with your <br/>
eyes as the targets.LOL The funnier thing is it doesn&#39;t usually take the <br/>
first time, my poor mom had to have hers done three times and still adds some <br/>
eyeliner. I only had to have mine done twice and the effect was much better <br/>
than my moms. Then again my mom is blonde with fair eyelashes, but I have <br/>
black hair and thick eyelashes, so I think that has effect on the look of the <br/>
liner too.<br/>
<br/>
After my second time (the tatooist doesn&#39;t charge you over and over because <br/>
it&#39;s standard that the face needs several coats), I had totally forgotten we <br/>
were supposed to be at a Luau that nite. My dh&#39;s grandma who was blind as a <br/>

<br/>
My husband never liked make-up, which probably is one reason he liked me.   <br/>
<br/>
I have owned some and used some (eye stuff mostly) but it always felt like <br/>
there was gunk on me that needed to be taken off.  I couldn&#39;t justify the <br/>
time spent, either.<br/>
<br/>
I have had female friends whose own families hadn&#39;t seen them without makeup. <br/>
 I can&#39;t imagine an unschooling family in which that could even BEGIN to work.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday Holly found a stash of nail polish she had misplaced and we were going <br/>
through admiring the colors.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is trying to stop biting her nails.  She quit for a week.  Then bit, <br/>
but a whole week!  And she saw how much they grew in a week.<br/>
<br/>
My nails grow fast and they&#39;re strong.  I can use them for pry bars and screw <br/>
drivers.  It really irritates my friends who buy nail-jobs.  Especially since <br/>
I frequently cut the left hand short to play guitar (and keep the right long <br/>
for fingerpicking, or screw-driving.   <br/>
<br/>
Lately I&#39;ve been playing fiddle with Holly.  Again, left hand gets cut short.<br/>
<br/>
So I painted my nails glittery gold with a clear overcoat.   At night, it <br/>
woke me up once.  The smell or the rough texture or something.<br/>
<br/>
But on Monday, an adult friend of Holly&#39;s was coming over, someone pretty <br/>
pink (figuratively speaking) and Holly thought it would be cool for me to <br/>
have nail polish, kind of in honor of her much more feminine friend who wears <br/>
make-up.  And, Holly says, she wears three layers of pink nail polish.<br/>
<br/>
AHA!  The friend probably dressed down just for us.  She had makeup, but just <br/>
a plain kind of sweatshirt, and I noticed (but Holly did not notice) she was <br/>
wearing NO fingernail polish. &lt;g&gt;  So we played card games and I myself had <br/>
gloriously long and gold-glittery fingernails.<br/>
<br/>
Just thought that image might amuse those who&#39;ve met me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Well sure.  Then his will seem more natural.   The genetic gift of turquoise <br/>
hair! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember who anymore, it was years ago, but someone I knew <br/>
secondarily dyed her daughter&#39;s hair brown hair blonde so people would <br/>
continue to believe the mom was a natural blonde!   That&#39;s pretty funny.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith was blond, and I have dark brown hair.    Kirby&#39;s is dark, Marty was <br/>
tow-headed (so had my mom been as a kid, and hers got dark in her teens) and <br/>
Holly was blonde.  Her hair is light brown now, but she uses Sun-In <br/>
sometimes, which is a heat-activated lightening spray.  (Not a spray of <br/>
lightning, a spray to lighten.)<br/>
<br/>
For a while Kirby had five stripes on his head that another friend put in <br/>
with Sun-In.<br/>
<br/>

Hey, is this the list I told a story about listening to Cyndi Lauper and <br/>

&gt;&gt;Tell me about the tattooed eye-liner.  Did it hurt?  <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;During the actual process they numb you so you don&#39;t have pain while the <br/>
&gt;needle is at work. Now then, when the numbness wears off, OMG not only you <br/>
&gt;you hurt, but you look like someone beat the crap out of your face with your <br/>
&gt;eyes as the targets.LOL The funnier thing is it doesn&#39;t usually take the <br/>
&gt;first time, my poor mom had to have hers done three times and still adds some <br/>
&gt;eyeliner. I only had to have mine done twice and the effect was much better <br/>
&gt;than my moms. Then again my mom is blonde with fair eyelashes, but I have <br/>
&gt;black hair and thick eyelashes, so I think that has effect on the look of the <br/>
&gt;liner too.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;After my second time (the tatooist doesn&#39;t charge you over and over because <br/>
&gt;it&#39;s standard that the face needs several coats), I had totally forgotten we <br/>
&gt;were supposed to be at a Luau that nite. My dh&#39;s grandma who was blind as a <br/>

some of her things that had been meaningful to us, and Rain chose her<br/>
large collection of nail polish.  My mom&#39;s stuff was all pinks and reds,<br/>
though, and Rain also has greens and blues and blacks and stuff... and<br/>
glow in the dark, and stuff that smells like brownies (and nail polish<br/>
too, but you can definiely smell brownies). She usually does different<br/>
colors on each finger, or stripes, or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
I hatw earing nail polish, it makes me feel like my fingernails and being<br/>
smothered. Toenail polish is okay, Rain did mine green a week or two ago,<br/>
I guess my toenails are less sensitive to being smothered. I do wear<br/>
makeup about once a month - I think it&#39;s sort of fun to dress up, and I<br/>
like how it looks on me. I do some powder, blush, eyeliner, shadow,<br/>
mascara, and lipstick, all in natural colors, but it just takes too much<br/>
time for every day...<br/>

too long and in the way, and I&#39;ve perfected a bite and tear technique<br/>
that I like. We do own 3 pairs of clippers but they seem to gte lost a<br/>

still) I&#39;ll put on a touch of blush, mascara, and eyeliner.  I, too, can&#39;t<br/>
wait to rush home and wash it off.  The same when I wear a dress and<br/>
pantyhose - I&#39;m out of them ASAP (after my MIL&#39;s funeral, it was literally<br/>
seconds after entering the house).<br/>
<br/>
As for the gray hair - I admit I use color.  My brain tells me I only feel<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053578949">Hi.  My name is Kimberly and I&#39;m new to the list.  My boys are 3 and 4.<br/>
I&#39;m certain that we are already unschooling, but no one calls it that<br/>
and I think I&#39;ll run into issues once the mandatory school age is upon<br/>
us.  At least the family is already receptive to the idea of<br/>
homeschooling.  We live in sunny So Cal.<br/>
 <br/>
Count me in with the non-makeup wearing mamas.  No nail polish either,<br/>
on fingers nor toes.  I grew up believing that women &quot;had&quot; to wear<br/>
makeup and I wore it through high school.  In college I mostly didn&#39;t,<br/>
but I did when I started a career.  Now that I no longer have a paid job<br/>
I am thrilled to be bare-faced everyday.  It is far simpler and I<br/>
finally learned to base my self-esteem on who I am and not what I look<br/>
like.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066179629">I didn&#39;t wear any makeup for my wedding last year either. It didn&#39;t even occur to me. Now that I think about it though, I do look especially lovely in the photos, so it must have been the happiness shining out! <br/>
<br/>
Ralph and I got remarried for our 20th anniversary. The legality of our marriage status is as unconventional as our educational philosophy! We were married 20 years ago, then got divorced a few years later. We reconciled and never remarried. Then last year we decided we would like to have a wedding, but didn&#39;t see any need for it to be &quot;official&quot; so instead of a marriage celebrant, we wrote our own ceremony, exchanged promises & rings, and had readings by my sister and our daughter. We did other cool stuff, a candle lighting ceremony, I sang a song to Ralph. It was very powerful and meaningful. A license couldn&#39;t have made it any better. In fact, having a stranger involved would have been out of place. All our family and friends were there,and while some of them were a bit dubious to start with, they all agreed afterwards that it had been a &quot;real&quot; wedding and they were very moved.<br/>
