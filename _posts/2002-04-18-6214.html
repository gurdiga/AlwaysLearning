<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176542617">WOW!! I had not seen all the pictures for a while..finally took the <br/>
time to look.<br/>
Joyce and Mary are NOT what I pictured!! It&#39;s very hard to match <br/>
images in your brain with reality sometimes.<br/>
I pictured Mary as this long, dark haired person....kind of asian <br/>
looking. She looks a lot like ME!! LOL<br/>
And Joyce I had an older image with dark hair...why do I always <br/>
picture people with dark hair?<br/>
It&#39;s so neat to see the happy smiling faces irl that I chat with here.<br/>
And all those free and joyful kids!!<br/>
I actually had a similar image of Sharon (of the swamp) in my <br/>
head....amazing! So one out of three&#39;s not bad?<br/>
