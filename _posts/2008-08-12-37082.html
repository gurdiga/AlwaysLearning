Unschooling has helped to bring us this incredible relationship and I know  <br/>
it will continue.  I just could use some ideas about this next step and  what <br/>
has helped the most during this time of transition for those of you who  have <br/>

Kirby was moving to an apartment with another co-worker.  They knew  <br/>
each other already, and they decided who would provide what.  We  <br/>
offered to let Kirby take things that would make his new place feel  <br/>
homey and he took some familiar kitchen things, and lamps, and his  <br/>
own bed.  Some things like pillows helped.  That might be minor, but  <br/>
knowing that we didn&#39;t say &quot;Get your own new stuff when you get  <br/>
there&quot; made it less a separation.<br/>
<br/>
If we had had to wait for a real paper letter or for a long distance  <br/>
phone call, it would&#39;ve been harder on me, but with cell phones and  <br/>
instant message and e-mail and mySpace and all that, I can check in  <br/>
on him by asking Marty and Holly if they&#39;ve heard from him, first  <br/>
pass.  And now Holly&#39;s going out with (odd term, but I can&#39;t think of  <br/>
the just-right-one) one of Kirby&#39;s best friends, so Brett hears from  <br/>
Kirby too.  So I can get news without bugging him directly.  And he  <br/>
calls me sometimes when he&#39;s walking to work, which is just the right  <br/>
amount of time for him to update me and then he gets there and has to  <br/>
turn his phone off so it&#39;s done. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have ordered him gifts and had them shipped straight there.  A USB  <br/>
cannon (controlled by keyboard, and you shoot kind of nerf-dart  <br/>
things).  A peaceful background picture and music DVD for the giant  <br/>
TV they bought together.  A Learn Nothing Day magnet (we gave him a  <br/>
shirt when he came to visit).   And he orders from my Amazon account  <br/>
sometimes, but uses his own charge card.  So I see what he ordered.   <br/>
OF  COURSE he could get his own Amazon account, but he was used to  <br/>
using mine before, and he just still does.<br/>

<br/>
Have them move in with other unschoolers!! lol<br/>
Trevor moved out in May and I really have no advice, just sympathy.<br/>
Our family dynamics have changed, it feels a bit strange and empty yet<br/>
there are many really neat parts too.  I see changes in him and in his<br/>
confidence level that are really cool. I know he is in a home where he<br/>
is valued and honored (hence my first comment).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing to prepare you for the bizarre empty room. Or the fact<br/>
that the physical presence isn&#39;t there. <br/>
<br/>
I am new to this also, but I thought that sending care packages once<br/>
in a while would be nice. I know how much those meant to me as a young<br/>
person out on my own for the first time. <br/>
<br/>
We have unlimited long distance so I can call him anytime ( I think I<br/>
called too much the first couple of weeks!) and I try to keep our blog<br/>
current because he and his girlfriend read it regularly. Great method<br/>
for tapping into the day-to-day stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a strange time in my life. I don&#39;t feel old enough on any level,<br/>
to have a grown child. I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;ll ever feel ready. So I&#39;m<br/>
&quot;weaning&quot; (as Sandra mentioned) and I don&#39;t know how long that takes!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending you lotsa hugs Gail!!!<br/>

I know my situation is a bit different in that Annie was only ever here part<br/>
time.  I still cry every time she leaves and I still have a rough day that<br/>
day (as do the boys).<br/>
<br/>
Annie is &#39;on her own&#39; now.  I don&#39;t have much more to add than Sandra and<br/>
Ren.  I too plan on sending gift packages  She knows she can ask us for<br/>
anything (even time) and we will do it.  I have been leaving messages for<br/>
her that aren&#39;t &#39;about&#39; her, but things I know she finds an interest in.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know if it helps her as much as it helps me :).  It&#39;s just a way to<br/>
let her know I&#39;m thinking of her.<br/>

Hope you find an peace with the silence...it will take time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627817949">Hello Gail,<br/>
My husband and I had our sons very young and after our first son got <br/>
married I thought I was ok with this but now they are talking about <br/>
moving over 1600 miles away and we wont be able to see them or our <br/>
grandson. We allowed our twins to take a summer job away from home <br/>
and (age 14) and I cried and couldn&#39;t handle the solitude at all. <br/>
It kind of goes into more detail than just missing my kids. Since my <br/>
husband and I started having our children young, we were pressured <br/>
and overwhelmed and had a tubal ligation at age 21. I regretted this <br/>
almost the moment I did it. We never had the money to reverse it so I <br/>
found myself depressed everytime I would think about my home being <br/>
empty after my children left. Well I had a horrible glimps into this <br/>
this summer and I couldn&#39;t deal. I have always wanted a house full of <br/>
children and we finally decided to have my tubal reversal on the 31st <br/>
of July. (My Dear sister paid for it) We are both 36 years old. So I <br/>
guess we will have to see what will happen for us. <br/>
I do feel for you though. It is so hard to let go and no matter how <br/>
you try to fill your time to avoid the emptiness, there is just <br/>
something that makes it hard to close this chapter of your life. <br/>
Almost like the most exciting part is over. I just wasn&#39;t ready yet.<br/>
So I will also be keeping up with advice that others give to you <br/>
because one day I will have to deal.<br/>
Blessings, Shalyn<br/>

____<br/>
That&#39;s a very exciting possibility.  36 is a great age to have a  child!<br/>
  I had Brenna at 36 and Logan at 40 and I really don&#39;t have any  desire for <br/>
young children now.  I do imagine, though, that if I had chosen  to have <br/>
children when I was much younger that I would have had more.  I  love everything <br/>
about my life as a mom and especially that I&#39;ve been able to  spend so much <br/>
really fun time with them.  I attribute much of our full rich  lives to <br/>
discovering unschooling and choosing to embrace it.<br/>
 <br/>
Brenna was talking today about being open to moving back to a closer  college <br/>
after this first year because it was so far away.  I&#39;m happy that  she&#39;s <br/>
brave enough and confident enough to go and I really think (like  Sandra said) <br/>
that with cell phones, e-mails and social networking that we will  stay in close <br/>
contact.  Her room will stay as it is and for now, she&#39;ll be  home for <br/>
holidays and occasional weekends. I remember a 5 hour drive  not being so far when I <br/>
was 18..&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I&#39;ll see her at the Live and Learn Conference two weeks after we  take <br/>
her to college.  That will at least help with the initial driving  away from <br/>
the campus.  I&#39;m still not sleeping much this week, though.   Waking up at 3 <br/>
a.m. with those thoughts that seem so much worse before the sun  comes up.  <br/>
 <br/>
Looking ahead, I have so many interests and find that I have more time to  <br/>
pursue them because the kids are older.  I&#39;m still at my happiest with a  house <br/>
full of kids playing games or when all four of us are together just  hanging <br/>
out.  I look forward to grandchildren and maybe even unschooled  <br/>
grandchildren...&lt;g&gt;<br/>
I&#39;m also looking forward to spending more time with my 15 year old  son.  <br/>
Brenna and I have so many similar interests and can finish each  others <br/>
sentences.  Logan and I not so much. It will be a very good  thing for the two of us to <br/>
have this time.<br/>
 <br/>
Definitely a new chapter coming up and I&#39;m hoping the reality is a bit  <br/>
easier than I have imagined it to be.<br/>
 <br/>
I loved the idea of her taking familiar things and she has been  choosing <br/>
things from her room and house today that she will take with her.   Also, the <br/>
care packages.  Very good idea.  Thanks.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357249057">One more thing.  My Aunt housed other kids when hers were gone...she had 3<br/>
that left all in the same year.  She says the other kids were a way to ease<br/>
the transition and keep the silence at bay.<br/>
<br/>
Now she records everything she thinks my boys would like on her dvr.  Then<br/>
she has the list of them all ready for the boys and loves sharing the time<br/>
with them.  Just one more idea...<br/>
<br/>
Jeff and I used to talk about sending the boys out with something that we<br/>
gave them (something to fit on the key ring) that they could have to help<br/>
them through the day.  Maybe you could make something together that each of<br/>
you could have with you all the time?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll keep thinking and sharing...<br/>
<br/>
I know for Annie, I&#39;m making something for her every year (she thankfully<br/>
likes sweaters!) and then I feel like my love is surrounding her every time<br/>
she wears them.<br/>

This doesn&#39;t fit the above idea, but it reminded me of something we<br/>
are working on for Trevor. He wanted to have names and addresses of<br/>
friends and family. I&#39;m getting a nice address book/calender and<br/>
putting birthdays and notable dates, plus all the phone numbers and<br/>
such of people he would want to stay in touch with.<br/>

It could be a really nice one, with photos and such too. A way for<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2078083094">Ren, perhaps since you may be more net savvy than me... you know this<br/>
trick... but i love Google&#39;s calendar.  Ravi adn i can share some parts like<br/>
b&#39;days and other common friend stuff adn otherwise keep our calendars<br/>
separate as well.  check it out here :<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/googlecalendar/overview.html">http://www.google.com/googlecalendar/overview.html</a><br/>
<br/>
So your family members can have separate private parts to the calendar and<br/>
select the common calendars that they want to see... this can include all<br/>
the common friends birthdays etc.  time consuming to put it all in but neat<br/>
to have forever.<br/>

the home of a couple in our church.  We&#39;d never met them before but <br/>
they were SO sweet.  When we left I gave them a framed photo I had <br/>
taken of the trunk of their poplar tree.  I had joked that if they <br/>
didn&#39;t have anywhere to put it, that maybe they could give it to one of <br/>
their (ten!) children who might be feeling homesick, so they could have <br/>
a little piece of home.  So that fits in with this thread...maybe take <br/>
some nice pictures of favorite places/haunts and frame nicely so they <br/>
will have a little bit of &quot;home&quot; to look at.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-327040770">OK, as always, I&#39;m behind!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
It is a strange time!   My oldest has been out of the house and with a<br/>
little boy for 7 years - I still don&#39;t feel old enough on any level!    I<br/>
have 5 grandchildren and am helping raise 4 of them.     As for my oldest,<br/>
she&#39;s awesome, both as an individual and as a mother (a lot stricter than<br/>
me, but that&#39;s her choice)   I was listening to someone lament the age of<br/>
their child recently and it dawned on me that my oldest is starting to push<br/>
the 30 mark!   Talk about getting hit with a brick - I cannot have a child<br/>
that old! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, ladies.   Enjoy the new parts and remember the old ones.<br/>
The transition isn&#39;t always easy, but it&#39;s worth it!   My daughter and I are<br/>
closer than ever.   She lives 2 states away and we talk every day!<br/>

It&#39;s a strange time in my life. I don&#39;t feel old enough on any level, to<br/>
have a grown child. I don&#39;t feel that I&#39;ll ever feel ready. So I&#39;m &quot;weaning&quot;<br/>
(as Sandra mentioned) and I don&#39;t know how long that takes!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending you lotsa hugs Gail!!!<br/>
