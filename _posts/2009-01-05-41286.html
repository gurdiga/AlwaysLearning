<div id="ygrps-yiv-818947627">I&#39;ve returned three posts this morning.  One came through anyway  <br/>
(either I accidentally sent it or another moderator did; it&#39;s okay).<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t for exchanging recipes, or valentines, or for finding  <br/>
free sources for antibiotics.   If there&#39;s anyone here who&#39;s only on  <br/>
this list and no others, and if you feel you&#39;re missing out on the  <br/>
benefits of yahoo lists, please state your needs here in this topic  <br/>
and people can let you know where to find such things.  If you want  <br/>
to be on a homeschooling penpal exchange, or to sign petitions, or to  <br/>
know about the problems some homeschoolers have had with local  <br/>
government, please find another list for that!  I don&#39;t mind people  <br/>
helping you find one now.<br/>
<br/>
This list, which is my list, is intended for discussion of natural  <br/>
learning and unschooling.  I&#39;d like for the discussion to unfold in  <br/>
ways that people all over the world can find useful.  If someone  <br/>
brings a link to an especially interesting art site or an interactive  <br/>
world map about something cool, that&#39;s fine. That&#39;s as accessible to  <br/>
people in Australia as to those in the U.K.    Announcements about  <br/>
something happening in Vermont wouldn&#39;t be as useful (no that there&#39;s  <br/>
anything happening in Vermont, it was just an example).<br/>
<br/>
I encourage everyone here to get out and about on the internet. I&#39;m  <br/>
assuming people already do that.  If you go to blogs, you&#39;ll find  <br/>
links to other blogs and to people&#39;s favorite websites, and you&#39;ll be  <br/>
on the superhighway to everything.<br/>

Wanting this list to provide everything to everyone is kinda like  <br/>
wanting to get a facial at a pizza place, or to buy flowers where  <br/>
they&#39;re repairing your computer.<br/>

I&#39;m going to be really busy this week, and I was afraid I&#39;d come back  <br/>
to a discussion about how I hate Valentine&#39;s Day or something,  <br/>
because I don&#39;t think this list is the place for penpal stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-406908209">Good places to post where unschoolers might find your projects.  I  <br/>
should&#39;ve listed these before:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.info/forum">http://unschooling.info/forum</a><br/>
(this is being revived, I hope, and it would be cool if some of you  <br/>
would go and post there just in general)<br/>
