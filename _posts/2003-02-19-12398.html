<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332867843">Hey y&#39;all,<br/>
<br/>
I have not been writing lately, but have been back to lurking for months. I<br/>
am laughing about the &quot;granny&quot; discussion (and the crap circles, too, Deb!).<br/>
<br/>
So here we are:  my parents are Mimi and Bumpa (which is what I, being the<br/>
oldest grandchild, called my father&#39;s father), my in-laws are Nana and<br/>
Grandpa, my father used to live with these folks when he was in the army who<br/>
were &quot;grandparent-ish&quot; and he called them Nanny and Po.  The funny thing is<br/>
that both my grandmothers were called Grandma (insert last name), so my<br/>
sister called them &quot;Grandma with the teeth like mine&quot; (because my mom&#39;s mom<br/>
had a large gap between her front teeth...like my sister) and &quot;The Grandma<br/>
who eats the cores&quot;  (because my dad&#39;s mom ate her apples all the way down<br/>
to the seeds).  I have not laughed about that in so long, thanks for the<br/>
giggle!!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and Betsy, I love to go to the library alone, too.  It is so nice to<br/>
just go in, sit down, read, and walk out with stuff I can carry by myself<br/>
without my imaginary personal chiropractor counting the money she&#39;ll make<br/>
off me the next day!!<br/>
<br/>
Blessed be,<br/>
DiAnna</div>
