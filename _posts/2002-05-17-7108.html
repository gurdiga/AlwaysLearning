<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107806814">Hi all.  I have been on the list for awhile, but this is the first time I¹m<br/>
posting.  This is the most active list I¹m on and I enjoy reading the posts<br/>
so much.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my problem...my oldest son is 5 years old and he loves to watch TV.<br/>
We have never had restrictions on television and he watches it a lot (IMO).<br/>
He watches for about 2 hours in the morning and another 1 1/2 in the<br/>
afternoon, and sometimes in between.  It seems that when ever we are home,<br/>
he wants the TV on.  This ends around three when PBS Kids goes off the air.<br/>
He will sometimes request a video at night.<br/>
<br/>
I thought that over time my son would get bored of so much TV, but that has<br/>
not been the case.  I really want him to self-regulate and I trust that he<br/>
knows what he needs, but it seems like way too much TV to me.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering...Can all kids self-regulate TV?  How much TV is too much?<br/>
Should I step in and limit TV?  How can TV be limited in an unschooling way?<br/>
Do unschoolers limit TV?  What about when kids get older and parents try to<br/>
limit TV?  I don¹t want to be the TV Police!<br/>
<br/>
I checked the archives of Always Learning and Unschooling.com and am still<br/>
conflicted about this topic.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to any and all comments.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, isabel<br/>

I thought that over time my son would get bored of so much TV, but that has<br/>
not been the case.  I really want him to self-regulate and I trust that he<br/>
knows what he needs, but it seems like way too much TV to me.<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
If he has other options for things to do, he is self-regulating. Some people<br/>
like a lot more TV than others. I personally don&#39;t like to have it on unless<br/>
I&#39;m watching a specific program (and even then I read a book during the<br/>
commercials &lt;g&gt;) but my husband likes to have it on quite a lot. When bored,<br/>
he&#39;s likely to turn it on and pick some REALLY stupid movie (he likes to<br/>
make snide remarks at really stupid movies) halfway in and happily watch<br/>
that (and half a dozen other programs at the same time). When I&#39;m bored I&#39;m<br/>
likely to read or bake or clean. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So the only thing I would be asking myself is: is he going to the TV because<br/>
that&#39;s the only interesting thing to do? If yes, time to spend more time out<br/>
of the house, or in the house building rocket ships or those cool<br/>
science-project valcanos or playing Dinosaurs or whatever his other<br/>
interests are. If you&#39;re already offering all that, and he still chooses TV,<br/>
then it&#39;s his real choice (and I cannot even BEGIN to list all the things my<br/>
daughters have learned from television. &quot;Good&quot; stuff, too, not just the<br/>
names of Pokemon).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
I am wondering...Can all kids self-regulate TV?  How much TV is too much?<br/>

----------<br/>
<br/>
In order asked:<br/>
Yes (with caveat of available other choices as above).<br/>
Not applicable.<br/>
No.<br/>
It can&#39;t be.<br/>
Some do.<br/>
I imagine it&#39;s quite difficult, in any family where the kids have a<br/>
backbone, not just unschoolers.<br/>
No, you really don&#39;t. ;)<br/>
<br/>
TV is not heroin. Some people like to watch a lot, some a little, some none.<br/>
Basically the same with any normal activity. Personal preference should<br/>
carry the day.<br/>
<br/>
Put &quot;I think&quot; and &quot;I believe&quot; in front of all my statements, please &lt;g&gt; I&#39;m<br/>
too lazy to go back and do it,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-579915886">&lt;&lt;I am wondering...Can all kids self-regulate TV?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes they can IF they have other options and are truly allowed to decide<br/>
when they&#39;ve had enough.  If someone is prodding and pushing them to turn<br/>
it off they don&#39;t really have the power to say when and you&#39;ll never<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How much TV is too much?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get a wide array of opinions on this but I haven&#39;t seen any proof<br/>
of any of the dire warnings of it&#39;s dangers.  I am one of those folks who<br/>
likes the TV to be on a LOT but I seldom actually watch what is on.  My<br/>
kids are the ones who turn it off, they have never been limited.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Should I step in and limit TV?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;How can TV be limited in an unschooling way?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can.  Deciding that something is not valuable for<br/>
learning FOR your children doesn&#39;t jive with unschooling, IMO.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do unschoolers limit TV?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some do but my observation is that those who demonstrate the strongest<br/>
grasp of unschooling and natural learning don&#39;t limit TV.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;What about when kids get older and parents try to limit TV?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it creates resentment and a controller vs controlled environment.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don�t want to be the TV Police!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t either and I won&#39;t.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think what you&#39;re describing is too much.  He IS self-regulating.  <br/>
You seem to be unhappy with the level.<br/>
<br/>
Can ANY kid &quot;SELF&quot; regulate to the secret, unspoken specifications of another <br/>
person?  Accidentally, if they&#39;re lucky.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t limit it.  As he gets older and can do more he&#39;ll have more to do! <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The unschoolingest way I know to limit TV is to provide other more <br/>
fascinating options.  But right now it seems he&#39;s learning from and liking TV.<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s watching a PBS kid&#39;s show, he has the option to turn it off, and he <br/>
chooses not to.  If he were in school for that half hour, he wouldn&#39;t be as <br/>
attentive, would have no right to leave, and other kids would be bugging him. <br/>
 So there he is, safe, free, and engaged in learning.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could make tapes of his favorite PBS shows.  Even if you tape it <br/>
while he&#39;s watching it, and collect all of one kind on one tape, he might <br/>
watch that later, and feel less like needing to be right there at 2:30 if he <br/>
knows he has six hours&#39; worth on tape for later.  That&#39;s IF you are truly <br/>
bugged by his watching the shows.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s ten and she really likes Zoom, Arthur, the math one whose name I&#39;m <br/>
failing to learn... but she&#39;s willing to miss them too.  Some days she sets <br/>
the alarm early to watch the early-morning Arthur, which is the repeat of the <br/>
afternoon of the day before.  If it&#39;s a good one or she missed it, she&#39;ll <br/>
wake up early.  Some other days she merrily misses any and all of it to do <br/>
other things.<br/>
<br/>
Videotaping can free a child from the clock the way phone messages/answering <br/>
service or machine can free people from telephone worry.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Isabel, welcome to the list.<br/>
<br/>
My son is ten now and has never had TV restrictions.   When he was four<br/>
and five he discovered Godzilla movies, the old ones, and other bad<br/>
sci-fi and classic horror films.  He was enthralled.  There were days the<br/>
TV was on all day.  Once I can remember he never even changed out of his<br/>
pj&#39;s.  ( This happened once when he got his Playstation too.)   <br/>
<br/>
He had other options, playmates, toys, games, a sand box and pool, a fun<br/>
mom, but he really wanted TV.     I think that&#39;s ok.  <br/>
<br/>
He now rarely watches TV all day.  Some days the TV is never even turned<br/>
on.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I thought that over time my son would get bored of so much TV, but <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You didn&#39;t tell us how long this has been going on, that he&#39;s watching TV<br/>
and that YOU think it&#39;s too much.  <br/>
You think it&#39;s too much, but obviously he doesn&#39;t.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am wondering...Can all kids self-regulate TV? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If TV isn&#39;t the best thing in their lives, yes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How much TV is too <br/>
&gt; much?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does it matter?  Would you be asking this question if he was reading<br/>
all day?  Would you be asking how many books are too many?  What if he<br/>
was playing outside for three or four hours.  Would that seem unhealthy<br/>
to you?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Should I step in and limit TV? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t.  You said you trust him to know what he needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How can TV be limited in an <br/>
&gt; unschooling way?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When it&#39;s the child&#39;s choice.<br/>
By making sure there are other options available to him that are fun and<br/>
wonderful and then by letting him make up his own mind.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do unschoolers limit TV? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What about when kids get older and parents <br/>
&gt; try to<br/>
&gt; limit TV?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why does this matter?   He&#39;s five right?  If you let him decide about TV<br/>
now, he&#39;ll be able to decide about TV when he&#39;s twelve.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I don�t want to be the TV Police!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your child doesn&#39;t want you to either, I bet.  <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I checked the archives of Always Learning and Unschooling.com and am <br/>
&gt; still<br/>
&gt; conflicted about this topic.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So many people I&#39;ve seen who are worried about TV are worried because<br/>
someone else said they should be.   If you really look at your life and<br/>
write down all the bad things TV has done to you, you&#39;ll probably find<br/>
the TV safer and nicer than most of your relatives.  ( Or maybe that&#39;s<br/>
just MY relatives.)  <br/>
<br/>
My son is a gentle and nice kid.  He&#39;s never been deliberately mean or<br/>
hurtful to someone else.  He loves animals and nature and cares about<br/>
politics and the suffering in the world.  He&#39;s never been limited or<br/>
restricted in what he can watch.  He watches whatever rated movie or show<br/>
he want&#39;s to.  He watches violence, sex, (not his favorite, but if it&#39;s<br/>
in the middle of stuff blowing up, he can live with it) <br/>
drugs and otherwise unsavory business, and he&#39;s not a hatchet murderer,<br/>
or a cat burglar or even a grasshopper-pull-the-legs off-er.   He DID try<br/>
a magic spell or two after reading &quot;Harry Potter&quot;  but as far as we know<br/>
none were successful and he&#39;s put aside the magic wand for now.  <br/>
<br/>
The TV was on this morning for two hours (Mystery Science Theater)  and<br/>
that&#39;s the first time since Wednesday night.  My son even has his own TV<br/>
and VCR for movie watching if the big TV is unavailable.  I can&#39;t<br/>
remember the last time he had it on. <br/>
He had a friend over last night and they played Set and made clay models<br/>
and pulled weeds out of the strawberry bed, but no one was interested in<br/>
TV. <br/>

OH yes.  I&#39;d rather them watch Arnold Schwartzenneger appear to kick the <br/>
bloody special-effects crap out of another actor then for them to spend more <br/>
than just a couple of hours with their grandmother!   MUCH less harmful to <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-562968734">Thanks so very much to all those who responded to my television questions.<br/>
The responses helped me gain some perspective on why this bothers me so<br/>
much.  I printed out the posts and plan to refer to them when I feel an<br/>
anti-TV attack coming on.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of the pressure I feel is coming from several friends (both<br/>
homeschoolers and schoolers) who have either gotten rid of the TV altogether<br/>
or severely  limit viewing.  According to these friends, their kids started<br/>
composing music, writing novels,  programming computers, cloning hamsters,<br/>
discovering galaxies, etc. once the TV was limited or trashed.  They insist<br/>
that it was the Tv that kept their kids from greatness!<br/>
 - I¹m exaggerating, of course...they didn¹t really program a computer! :)<br/>
hee-hee<br/>
<br/>
So, I¹m thinking...how is my son going to find a cure for cancer by his 6th<br/>
birthday if he¹s busy watching Arthur and Zoboomafoo!?  Apparently, he has<br/>
his own plan for his life.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone else had to combat this pressure from society, family and friends<br/>
regarding unlimited TV?  I be really interested in hearing some stories<br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Isabel<br/>
ps...my son has loads of other things to do.  He is very social and loves to<br/>
spend time with friends.  We go on lots of field trips and spend a few hours<br/>
outside everyday.  I tape his shows if we are going out and that works<br/>
great.<br/>

his life when he was a kid.  His parents got divorced and he moved <br/>
around a lot so he didn&#39;t have many friends.  TV was his best friend <br/>
and he turned out just fine professionally, if that is what you are <br/>
worried about.<br/>
<br/>
It is 9 p.m. here and right now both my daughters are in our garage, <br/>
with two of their friends, who are spending the night.  They have <br/>
drawn a city on the garage floor with chalk.  Their city is filled <br/>
with all kinds of interesting features and people from all walks of <br/>
life.  They are using polished stones as the people for their city.  <br/>
I&#39;m amazed at the creativity and planning that has gone into this <br/>
game.  I&#39;m sure they got the inspiration to do all this from <br/>
*all* &quot;The SIMS&quot; they have been playing on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, a few weeks ago I posted a question to this list similar <br/>
to yours, about all the time my daughters were spending on the <br/>
computer.  I don&#39;t know why I was so worried.<br/>
