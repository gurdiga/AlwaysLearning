<div id="ygrps-yiv-1591692636">Hello,<br/>
We have been deschooling for 2 months. For ten years, I worked with children with varying special needs in the Florida public schools. I left the school system in 2012.<br/>
Our 12 yo went to ps for K and 1/2 of 1st... we have homeschooled since then with a variety of curriculums. She is a peaceful, go with the flow kid and enjoys learning of most kinds.<br/>
Our 9 yo has never attending ps... always homeschooled but I definitely coerced LOTS of time spent ‚Äúteaching‚Äù her when she would have rather been playing knee deep in mud or with an entire village set up of her critters. A deep regret for me but now I know what I know and we are going about things differently.<br/>
Our 5 yo has been wild and free... did voluntarily sit with us regularly during ‚Äúlessons‚Äù, jumping in and out as he pleased.<br/>
Our 20 month old and 3 month old get lots of attention and playtime throughout the day with whomever is interested at the time or whom they are interested in.<br/>
My question is... my heart desires a gathering time during the day to read our Bible, listen, draw, and dance to music, read picture books they‚Äôve chosen from the library, look at art, and watch videos about interesting stuff. I usually have food available if they are hungry and they bring things to draw/color/create while we are together.<br/>
Everyone stays as long as they are interested, leaves when/if they want.<br/>
Is this ok to do? Is this a form of strewing?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your insight,<br/>
Randi Timmons<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505976748">If you have only been deschooling for two months and you have worked in the school system for many years I would say you are only just at the beginning of your deschooling journey. It‚Äôs OK, it can‚Äôt really be rushed but it can be addressed and analysed and taken seriously as an undertaking. You are looking to be a careful observer of yourself, but in a spirit of curiosity and fun, not judgment.<br/>
<br/>
It takes a long time, and usually longer for the parent than the kids.  <br/>
<br/>
Your wish for a gathering sounds a little (actually, very!) schoolish to me, and I wonder what it is you think it will bring to each of your individual children.  Take some time to really ask what it‚Äôs purpose is other than to make you feel purposeful?   I know I used to think I‚Äôd really achieved something if both my kids were sitting at a table doing something with pen and paper together at the same time.  Then I realised what an agenda I had. And what if they simply said ‚Äòno thanks mum not today‚Äô and simply carried on playing in the mud. Would that be ok for you? would you feel someone was missing?  Families ebb and flow.  They rarely formally ‚Äògather‚Äô with ‚Äòactivites‚Äô. That sounds like a class. Many willingly gather at mealtimes though, or to watch movies.  But not always.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As to the idea of strewing, in my understanding strewing is something completely different. It is a seemingly  casual, often unmentioned, enriching of your environment with cool and interesting stuff.  Yes, books, games etc maybe, but also things you find in a junkshop, a wierd sweet from japan you found in the supermarket, an obscure musical instrument given to you by a neighbour‚Ä¶ It might generate interest, it might not. It might be for anyone in the family, including your husband.  Something to discover, trip over, trigger conversation.  No agenda.<br/>

<p style="margin-top:0;margin-bottom:0;">Two months is really no time at all to be deschooling - especially with multiple children who all also have some deschooling to do
<span>üòä<br>
<br>
So, I would be avoiding anything that looks remotely schooly for a good long while yet.<br>
<br>
==<span style="color:rgb(33, 33, 33);font-family:Georgia;font-size:15px;">My question is... my heart desires a gathering time during the day to read our Bible, listen, draw, and dance to music, read picture books they‚Äôve chosen from the library, look at
 art, and watch videos about interesting stuff.==<br>
<br>
The &#39;gathering&#39;, to me,&nbsp;sounds more like an informal lesson - a way for you to still &#39;teach&#39; them things you think are important (reading, drawing, Bible study, art). Who decides if a video is &#39;interesting&#39; and why? What do their individual hearts desire at
 this exact time of day?<br>
<br>
</span><span style="color:rgb(33, 33, 33);font-family:Georgia;font-size:15px;">==Everyone stays as long as they are interested, leaves when/if they want. ==<br>
<br>
If that is really true - great. But I&#39;m wondering if everyone is free to not come at all, if they want.</span></span></p>

<p>==&nbsp;Is this a form of strewing? ==<br>
<br>
I don&#39;t think so, from what you&#39;ve described. It sounds like Mom is choosing the time and place for certain, Mom sanctioned, activities to take place - that doesn&#39;t seem like strewing to me. Strewing would be getting some books from the library and leaving
 them out somewhere. Finding an &#39;interesting&#39; video and maybe sending it to a child who might like it via a Skype link. Driving to a market and watching a performance of street dancers. etc.<br>

Not strewing.<br/>
<br/>
It won‚Äôt hurt unschooling to have a time you want to read to them.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be good not to call it anything that would seem like that was the learning time, more than other times, for unschooling, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1486539954">We have fairly naturally evolved a kind of regular reading time, it doesn‚Äôt happen every day, but when we don‚Äôt have a reason to go anywhere in the morning, we snuggle in one of the beds and I read to my two girls, aged 11 and 8.  We do it usually around when they wake up, sometimes while they are eating.  <br/>
<br/>
So I have one book that I‚Äôm reading to both of them, and then if my youngest doesn‚Äôt feel like listening, I have another couple of books I‚Äôm reading with just my oldest, who would happily listen to me read all day.  Their dad has different books he‚Äôs reading to them after dinner and once a week we do some poetry.<br/>
<br/>
None of this is at all compulsory and it doesn‚Äôt happen at the same time every day or every week.  But it‚Äôs something fun and we all enjoy it.</div>

<br/>
You won‚Äôt really be unschooling well until you can do it without asking other people ‚ÄúIs this unschooling?‚Äù<br/>
<br/>
Two people have already said how it could interfere with deschooling.  If five people come in now and say, ‚ÄúNo, you‚Äôre fine‚Äîit couldn‚Äôt possibly hurt a thing,‚Äù will you relax and not wonder about it anymore? :-)<br/>
<br/>
It‚Äôs WHY that‚Äôs important, not a majority vote.  WHY could it hinder deschooling?<br/>
<br/>
-=-It feels connective and often inspires interests,  common or tangental. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If your unschooling becomes solid, any connection between you and a child should feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This time is how we come back together after being apart and share what‚Äôs been going on in our day. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why would you have been apart?<br/>
<br/>
Keep your gathering time, but don‚Äôt expect it to be the only time of sharing or connection.  That is what could mess you up.<br/>
<br/>
Your older kids will be teens and out and about soon, so don‚Äôt take too much time deschooling or it will be too late, for them, for unschooling to have a good effect.<br/>
