Gargamel is voiced by Paul Winchell...Winnie-The-Pooh is a HUGE <br/>

Sorscha has been a huge fan of the Smurfs lately and she says, &quot;That he has a book that says that he can turn Smurfs into gold and so he wants all the Smurfs because he wants all the gold.&quot; <br/>

I found an answer.  It&#39;s not *the* answer, but it&#39;s a very amusing (to me) answer:<br/>
<br/>
* SMURFS<br/>
<br/>
Most of us think of the Smurfs as cute, harmless little blue and white aliens. However, the <br/>
story line is full of occultism. Papa Smurf is cast in the role of a &quot;White&quot; Witchdoctor who is <br/>
protecting his people by incantations and rituals and potions. Gargamel is cast in the role <br/>
of the &quot;Black&quot; or evil witchdoctor who is always trying to cast some evil spell over the poor, <br/>
helpless Smurfs so he can control them forever. In one cartoon screen several years ago, <br/>
Gargamel is shown creating a Devil&#39;s Pentagram from lighted candles on the dirt floor of <br/>
his house. Gargamel moved inside the Pentagram and carried out a ritual designed to <br/>
defeat Papa Smurf and the little Smurfs. Your children have probably watched this most <br/>
Satanic cartoon.<br/>

This is from a site that&#39;s a transcription of a radio program.  The commenter also reviled <br/>
My Little Pony, Masters of the Universe, Captain Planet and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, <br/>
so I guess that makes it from around 1990 or so?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195996062">Originally (1950s), it was to use in an alchemy formulation, but<br/>
Gargamel was unsuccessful in this endeavor, and has been a sworn enemy<br/>
of the Smurfs since they freed their compatriot.<br/>
<br/>
His wanting to eat them seems to be an American invention with the<br/>
advent of the cartoon here . . . I don&#39;t think that ever came up in my<br/>
childhood in post-war Europe and the wildly popular Smurfs there. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453468243">-=-Gargamel the sorcerer is the sworn enemy of the Smurfs. He is an  <br/>
evil wizard (though with very limited powers; he actually seems to be  <br/>
more of an alchemist) Gargamel is absolutely obsessed with the Smurfs  <br/>
and his main goal is trying to capture, eat, and otherwise destroy  <br/>
the Smurfs. His robe is worn and patched, and his teeth are rotten.  <br/>
He lives in a run-down hovel with his flea-bitten cat Azrael.-=-<br/>

There&#39;s what the eventual shake-down summary is, according to Wikipedia.<br/>

That page has what dozens of different languages call Smurfs.  Pretty  <br/>
interesting.  One is Catalan.<br/>
Just  yesterday I posted up about a version of Powers of Ten in Catalan.<br/>

Better to go there and read it for the illustrations and other 80&#39;s  <br/>

<br/>
CARTOON: The Smurfs<br/>
<br/>
LESSON: Communism works!<br/>
For naysayers who point to the Former Soviet Union as proof that  <br/>
communism is inherently flawed, may we merely direct your attention  <br/>
to Smurf Village, where everyone shares everything, wears similar  <br/>
utilitarian clothing, battles Gargamel and his turn-Smurfs-to-gold  <br/>
get rich quick schemes and obeys the dictates of a bearded, red hat- <br/>
wearing, benevolent authority figure. Quoth Comrade Papa: �From each  <br/>
according to his abilities, to each according to his needs.� Really,  <br/>
he actually said that.<br/>
<br/>
How it affected us as adults: Secret communist agendas ceased being  <br/>
dangerous, or really any adjective of consequence, years ago. The  <br/>
worst thing communism does these days is make Ivy League students  <br/>
waste a couple of years wearing ugly clothes and attending boring  <br/>
meetings. However, the sexual politics of Smurf Village, with its one  <br/>
female for every 30 guys, did go a long way towards preparing us for  <br/>
freshman year of college.<br/>
<br/>
===================================================================<br/>
<br/>
I found it because a friend sent me a link to an article on video  <br/>
games there (also a fun article):<br/>

<br/>
I poked around there a bit and found this comment:<br/>
lannasport90 (1 week ago)<br/>
mom did not let me look at this when I was 5 =,(<br/>
<br/>
It was about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles show themesong.<br/>
<br/>
So this Iannansport kid (young adult now, probably) is still sad that  <br/>
his mom said &quot;NO&quot; about a show.<br/>
I let my son watch it, I helped him tape it, he still (at 20, nearly  <br/>
21) has ALL the action figures and all their weapons except April  <br/>
O&#39;Neill&#39;s gun, which was lost years ago, he has a &quot;Turtle Museum&quot; on  <br/>
one wall of his room, and he studied karate for years because of his  <br/>
interest in that show.<br/>
<br/>
My son has many happy memories and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Iannasport didn&#39;t recover yet from his deprivation.  It wasn&#39;t worth  <br/>
it.  They both grew up to live in a world where YouTube links could  <br/>
bring them that theme song and intro any time of the day or night.<br/>
