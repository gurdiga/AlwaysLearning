<div id="ygrps-yiv-151904922">Hi all, <br/>
Thankyou all for taking the time to respond to my e-mail.  All of your<br/>
answers have brought comfort to me.  Living for the &quot;now moment&quot; makes<br/>
lots of sense.  I have been guilty of envying other children for their<br/>
achievements, but I guess we only see a snapshot of their lives when<br/>
we meet up.  I will try and focus more on my own children and enjoy<br/>
the blessings of who they are.<br/>
Thankyou Bob for &quot;going with the flow&quot;.  Your days sound perfect and<br/>
like you say if you can see their happiness then that&#39;s what counts.<br/>
Today has been a day of memories with an &quot;Alternative Halloween Party&quot;<br/>
and playing in the leaves.  Their joy today has been good to see.<br/>
I will go back to lurker status for a while. <br/>
Blessings<br/>
Michelle</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-177951819">-=-If people always did that, we&#39;d be changing everyday, because  <br/>
there is always something different out there.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some people do change all the time.<br/>
<br/>
My first constant critic, early in the $3 an hour AOL days, was on me  <br/>
all the time about not being more flexible in my beliefs, but it  <br/>
turned out she was so flexible that she put her kids in school at  <br/>
some point *every year.*  And took them out.  And put them in...<br/>
<br/>
The reason I write as I do about unschooling is that one things  <br/>
that&#39;s required for it to work is for the parents to understand it  <br/>
clearly within themselves and to have confidence.  Without that,  <br/>
their unschooling life is very, very small.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, Kelly Traaseth has pointed out to me that the quote I  <br/>
liked has been her sigline for a year:<br/>
