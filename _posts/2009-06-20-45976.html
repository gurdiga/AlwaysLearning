<div id="ygrps-yiv-593678317">Haley, 10, told me about 20 minutes ago that someone she thinks from Italy<br/>
was asking her how to download<br/>
Scratch. She&#39;d put a &quot;make a request from me&quot; project on there and that was<br/>
his request. She said she<br/>
was even pretty sure she had read and understood one word, &quot;grazie&quot;. She was<br/>
excited about that. I told<br/>
her she could probably google a translation and off she bounced.<br/>
<br/>
She came back just a bit later to say that grazie did mean thanks and that<br/>
wiki was so cool! That&#39;s where<br/>
she&#39;s found it. And that she&#39;d told him how to do the download...I said,<br/>
&quot;So, he reads English but only<br/>
types Italian?&quot; I was confused. She said no he only knows Italian as far as<br/>
she knew. So, how?<br/>
<br/>
She had used her web cam to take a shot of the front page and drew a large<br/>
arrow to where the download<br/>
button was. Amazing! I wonder if the years of using the internet not knowing<br/>
how to read or write<br/>
English, she&#39;s only been reading 6-9 months now, has anything to do with her<br/>
not thinking a thing about<br/>
helping someone speaking in a different language?<br/>
<br/>
I just had to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054007532">That was a very cool little story. I&#39;m super impressed with her <br/>
confidence and resourcefulness! Awesome.<br/>
<br/>
Did she find a translation site like babelfish - where you can copy and <br/>
paste a whole block of text in, in one language, and it translates the <br/>
whole thing to another language? I used babelfish a lot when my daughter <br/>
was in France and I wanted to order things from amazon.fr to be sent to <br/>
her there in paris.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907743812">This is such a good example of what makes unschooling so awesome!  When<br/>
you don&#39;t tell kids how to do things, or that there is a right or wrong<br/>
way, they find really creative solutions to their problems.  Sometimes,<br/>
well often, the solution is one that the parent, or at least this<br/>
parent, never considered!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one of those never ending surprises that happen on a regular basis!<br/>
It wasn&#39;t something that I expected out of unschooling.  It&#39;s so fun to<br/>
watch my kids do things and discover things in ways I never could have<br/>
imagined!</div>
