&gt; observed; instead, they would really *look* at it, its color, size, beak<br/>
&gt; shape, feet, behavior, etc.  He felt that once the thing was named, the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that&#39;s so important. With my 3yo, we&#39;re swimming in all sorts of &#39;kid <br/>
stuff&#39; that he&#39;s gotten for christmas, books, computer games and such. It&#39;s <br/>
mostly about matching, labeling, etc. Identifying things and putting them all <br/>
in their neat little category. Very little room for interpretation, <br/>
appreciation, experiencing all that something entails, etc. <br/>
