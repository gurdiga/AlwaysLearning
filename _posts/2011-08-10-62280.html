I thought once I started a set of people saying &quot;You don&#39;t treat me the way you claim to treat your own children,&quot; but I can&#39;t find it and couldn&#39;t find out how to search on this list or my own page.  (I mean several attempts to search failed to turns things up.)<br/>

The thread was called &#39;What Unschooling is Not&#39;. Below is the relevant excerpt.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-=-I KNOW you don&#39;t treat your children like that so why me?-=-<br/>
<br/>
#1, you&#39;re not the child of anyone here.<br/>
#2, you&#39;re not a child.<br/>
#3, you came to a discussion group as an adult.<br/>
#4, you have children at your house. We would like to help you treat your<br/>
children the way we treat ours.<br/>
<br/>
This complaint is made a time or two a year. If a mother wants to be treated as<br/>
a child, that&#39;s beyond the scope of this list. We KNOW that many adults had<br/>
insufficient nurturing and would like to be babied and soothed and rocked and<br/>
sung to. We can&#39;t rock and sing here anyway, but mothers can heal their own sad<br/>
childhoods by babying, soothing, rocking and singing to their own children.<br/>

<br/>
Sure some take longer to start understanding unschooling more deeply than just not doing school . <br/>
It is when I someone that is just so unclear in her own thoughts and her own ideas about everything, not just unschooling, that I wonder of that person will be able to really do it well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685778136">I have had, and  still have , my thoughts, words and way of thinking challenged often.<br/>
I usually stop and I think about it before I go on and on on a rant and before I feel attacked and go on a personal attack towards whoever challenged me.  I like being challenged. I learn a lot from it. <br/>
One of the things I have learned and am learning so much from the discussions in this list is to stop and think about my words. Think about why I am using them. Realize that the words I choose matter. They can change the way I think about a situation. <br/>
<br/>
Today when I feel like &quot;I have to&quot; do something  I stop and think :&quot; I do not have to, I can choose to or not&quot;<br/>
Just a change in how we words something can make a huge difference in how we see a situation.<br/>
Its making my thinking so much more clear. <br/>

<br/>
My experience, having known more than one mom like that in person, is that they eventually give up on unschooling. They get a curriculum or put kids in school - and discover that &quot;works better&quot; because for them it does. <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t for every family, but it doesn&#39;t often help to say &quot;you know, I don&#39;t think you&#39;re cut out to unschool your kids&quot;. I&#39;ve tried ;) and the response is usually to tell me I&#39;m being dogmatic. I don&#39;t think I am - I&#39;d much rather see a family homeschooling or schooling relatively peacefully than &quot;unschooling&quot; where the mom has a host of contradictory goals and expectations. <br/>
(I just wish so many &quot;alternative&quot; moms didn&#39;t think unschooling was cool - can we somehow get it to be un-cool? That would save a lot of time and energy.)<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
It really depends on how open they are to examining their own beliefs and how open they are to changing.  I really don&#39;t think parents who refuse to examine their own thoughts and are unwilling to change will have very good results in unschooling.  I think there are some parents that have too much baggage to unschool.  It won&#39;t stop people from trying though.  It won&#39;t stop people from doing whatever they do and calling themselves unschoolers.<br/>
