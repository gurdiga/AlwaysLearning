I hope you didn&#39;t think I was complaining about newcomers, I certainly didn&#39;t want my post to sound that way! I enjoy answering questions about unschooling and discussing the finer details of gentle parenting.<br/>
<br/>
As to my rant,<br/>
What gets me really annoyed is people defending practices that don&#39;t fit in with the goals of the list. &quot;Spanking is fine in certain cases&quot; was the most recent example. That&#39;s just fine if you want to feel that way and not change your mind, but don&#39;t spout off about it on a list whose goal is to help people get to gentle parenting, yk?<br/>
And this list is a place for people that want pure unschooling.<br/>
If you don&#39;t want it, FINE! But why do they have to come here and then feel the list &quot;beat them up&quot;? I wouldn&#39;t go to a vegan list spouting off about how SOME animal products were absolutely necessary and they were all bigots to say I don&#39;t need animal products, ever.<br/>
<br/>
I guess some people have a hard time understanding the purposes of certain lists. This one is for radicals....easy enough right? :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, seeing someone whine about this list was a bit more than I could bear. Forgive me for venting on you all. <br/>

I was mostly joking.. I just had an encounter at swim<br/>
team where someone was complaining about my  relaxed<br/>
parenting to strangers and it really got my goat.I am<br/>
a fine parent, The bitch. I later found out she is<br/>
having serious personal troubles, but still do not<br/>
want to be someones target. So goes my quote about not<br/>
saying anything if you can&#39;t be nice. And I love this<br/>
list.. I am a creature of philosophy. I embrace that<br/>
and put it into practice and I am loving the entire<br/>
unschooling thought.. I am reading John Holt Learning<br/>
all the Time and have read Sandra&#39;s stuff. Reading all<br/>
the goodies on this list lets me feel supported as I<br/>
practice. I agree that whoever was list jumping<br/>
complaining about this group is a buttface for no<br/>
better term and I do get what you are saying  about<br/>
not expecting the list to be something it is not. I am<br/>
not offended or feeling unwelcome.. THis is my current<br/>
favorite list! I too am passionate and often<br/>
misconstrude. <br/>
We are off to state swim meet.The kids will be bummed<br/>
when it is all over. <br/>

and all my  anoying questions&quot;<br/>

I never found your questions annoying Dee....you were here wanting to learn, it was obvious. You didn&#39;t insult people or tell them that it just would never work for you. You listened and asked more and absorbed and asked more again.<br/>
I appreciate that kind of question asker. The annoying ones are the ones that insult and insist that we simply have sweet, compliant children or this style of parenting would never work.<br/>
Please don&#39;t think I get annoyed with questions, that certainly isn&#39;t the case. I&#39;ve thoroughly enjoyed your questions and willingness to learn.<br/>

<br/>
I missed the original, as yahoogroups seems to be having some indigestion, <br/>
and so I don&#39;t know what spouting off happened, but there are LOTS of lists <br/>
about unschooling.  If you go to yahoo and search for unschooling lists you&#39;ll get <br/>
many, and could try them all.<br/>
<br/>
Where the lists are that are about unschooling and that want people who <br/>
aren&#39;t yet unschooling to disrupt them, I&#39;m not sure.  <br/>
<br/>
If you truly want to learn abut unschooling, there is a great deal collected <br/>
at websites, and lots of them are linked from mine:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could read for weeks without reading it all if you just follow the links <br/>
from each page you come to.  Mae Kowaski&#39;s site is mostly links to articles on <br/>
unschooling she has liked, and her pages are linked from mine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the third one you&#39;ve been on.  You left the other two when people<br/>
disagreed with you.  If it bothers you to be disagreed with, the best thing<br/>
to do is just read what other people write.   You can do that here, or at<br/>
the other lists you&#39;ve left, or on the web at www.unschooling.com and many<br/>
other places.  Just plug unschooling into the search feature for lists, if<br/>
you want a list, or into Google if you&#39;re just looking for info.  You don&#39;t<br/>
*have* to post things that are likely to be disagreed with, if you&#39;re just<br/>
looking for information.<br/>
