<div id="ygrps-yiv-361596099">Thank you marietta, plaidpanties!, pamela, helen, sylvie and sandra. I<br/>
found your own varied experiences really helpful. Sandra<br/>
you&#39;re bang on the nail that I hoped my son would respond in French.<br/>
The decision I&#39;ve come to for the moment - and it&#39;s flexible - is to<br/>
continue speaking French, to my son, and as often as possible, to my<br/>
husband, whose French is high-intermediate. When it gets difficult, we<br/>
shift to English. I abandon all hope that he speaks back in French and<br/>
this exchange with you all has made me more respectful of his<br/>
preference whereas before I felt irritated and scornful every time he<br/>
spoke English. But it&#39;s not ideal. I think monolinguism is ideal! As<br/>
someone said, people who just speak one language may well speak it<br/>
better. I myself find that as my French gets more fluent my English<br/>
gets corrupted and vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
I have a baby girl so it&#39;s been hard to make time - usually my husband<br/>
takes over looking after my son, which is why English has suddenly<br/>
become dominant. That&#39;s been a bit of a shock to me. My son also<br/>
sounds absolutely gorgeous when he speaks French. He uses a different,<br/>
more natural voice, perhaps because that&#39;s his mother tongue. I also<br/>
think French enables both of us to express<br/>
better emotions. I&#39;ve noticed that when he does something annoying<br/>
and I respond indignantly in French, he responds better. It&#39;s like a<br/>
way through. I think when I speak in English, I can get cross more<br/>
easily and I don&#39;t know why. I get cross in French too but I can bend<br/>
the crossness and make it more indignant, less hostile.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I am making extra time to read him stories in French - I have<br/>
a few story books he&#39;s keen on. While I read them he does a strange<br/>
babble, neither French nor English. So no, he&#39;s not particularly<br/>
against French, he just finds it increasingly difficult.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;d be interested to do a weekend visit. I have family in France<br/>
but spend more time trying to avoid them than anything else.<br/>
Thanks again for the help, which has been good guidance.</div>

While I think knowing more than one language makes people  <br/>
appreciative of languages in general and gives them the opportunity  <br/>
to be philosophical about the differences in language, it&#39;s not magic.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people who are trilingual and who seem to think very  <br/>
little in ANY language, but live kind of flat, boring lives.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people who are monolingual and they spark with thought  <br/>
and words and ideas.<br/>
