That&#39;s going to happen a lot here, Julie.  We&#39;re discussing the ideas  <br/>
themselves separate from the particular authors or situations, very  <br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
Also, most people aren&#39;t careful with words.  They throw them around  <br/>
without regard to the huge clues they&#39;re missing about their own  <br/>
thoughts or moods.   Try not to be defensive if people pick a phrase  <br/>
up and turn it over.  Eventually you can learn to do it for yourself,  <br/>
before the phrases even come out, and that level of thought is  <br/>
something very valuable.<br/>

Go for a walk around the neighborhood together.<br/>
Invite her to make cupcakes.<br/>

She&#39;s not so much interested in you telling her what to do or why she shouldn&#39;t be bored.   She wants you to help her feel better.  Spend time with her talking and doing and that will help.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389098048">=======How do you all handle if your child tells you that she/he is bored?<br/>
=======<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Bored is a codeword for lonely.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I want to reiterate what others have previously posted.  Don&#39;t make<br/>
suggestions.  Invite her to do things with you.  Respond at the first signs<br/>
of boredom/loneliness.  It is possible to be around people all day long, and<br/>
still be lonely.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have a similar dynamic in our house:  Two older children who are close in<br/>
age and a much younger child.  The boys have each other, but my daughter<br/>
just has me.  I do my best, but I can be a sucky playmate at times.  It<br/>
seems I have forgotten how to play with full imagination and absolute<br/>
abandonment of reality.  I play games (both video and board) with her.  I do<br/>
art projects with her.  I read to her.  I leave the boys at home and go with<br/>
just her - for a walk, to the park, shopping, out to eat - anything as long<br/>
as it is just me and her.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However, the absolute best thing I can do for her - the thing that makes her<br/>
the happiest - is invite her friends over.  The more, the merrier.  It is<br/>
not unusual to have 3-4 extra kids at my house.  Those days are absolute<br/>
bliss for my girl.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If you hear &quot;I&#39;m lonely&quot; every time your child says &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; you&#39;ll<br/>
better understand how to react.  You will know that if she finally goes off<br/>
to do something on her own, the problem is not solved.  A lonely child who<br/>
is no longer bothering her mom is still a lonely child.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you for posting this.  I&#39;ve been baffled & irritated by Eli&#39;s (4 yrs<br/>
old) recent complaints of boredom, and this explains it. <br/>
<br/>
The other day we went to my doctor&#39;s appt and when that was done I offered<br/>
lots of fun ideas about what we could do next - playground, children&#39;s<br/>
museum, science center, beach, meeting up with friends-  and Eli said, &quot;No,<br/>
I just want to go home and play my games.&quot;  I was disappointed and Izador (2<br/>
yrs) was disappointed, but out-in-the-world-adventures are no fun when Eli<br/>
doesn&#39;t really want to be there, so home we went.  Once home he immediately<br/>
collapsed on the couch,  &quot;I&#39;m bored. I&#39;m so bored.  Mommy, I&#39;m soooooooo<br/>
bored.&quot;    I felt super irritated and I&#39;m sure this came across, even though<br/>
I didn&#39;t voice my thoughts out loud (&quot;you wouldn&#39;t be bored if you&#39;d agreed<br/>
to one of my super-exciting ideas, and now we&#39;re all stuck at home, and<br/>
we&#39;re all bored, and now you want me to come up with something exciting to<br/>
do?  GRRR.&quot;) .  <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;d simply heard his complaint as &quot;I&#39;m lonely&quot; I would have reacted much<br/>
more helpfully.  He wanted connection.  He wanted to be at home, he wanted<br/>
to recharge, he wanted to connect with me.  And I totally blew it. <br/>
<br/>
Next time.  I promise.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Pam <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-181448685">-=-Recently I was talking with a friend of mine who had gone to a simplicity childhood workshop. A couple things that were brought up were simplifying the house (getting rid of much of the stuff), lessoning screen time, and letting the child experience boredom (be more boring than the boredom, was recommended). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Schools traditionally paint over windows, or tape paper there, or kids&#39; art, so that kids can&#39;t look out the windows, so that the teacher&#39;s droning on is more interesting than trees or people or cars or birds outside.<br/>
<br/>
This might seem picky to you, but I&#39;m going to say that &quot;lessoning screen time&quot; isn&#39;t about lessons.  It&#39;s about making less of.  Limiting.  Creating lack.  Paucity.  <br/>
<br/>
Lessen (not lesson).<br/>
I never wanted to lessen my child&#39;s world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Our house is full of stuff - fun and interesting stuff, in my opinion. We spend a good amount of time together playing video games, and watching videos (along with other things, of course). And, when my son is bored we explore together. I try to be more fun, not more boring.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m with you, absolutely.  I think boredom is sad and should be avoided.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-I feel pretty confident in our choices, but I think my friend is concerned about stuff, screen time and too much interaction being disruptive to a child&#39;s free development. Has anyone heard of Simplicity Parenting? I think of unschooling as more, not less, but can there be too much?-=-<br/>
<br/>
You might ask her if she knows what &quot;simple&quot; means, in intellectual terms.  I really wouldn&#39;t want my child to be simple.  <br/>
<br/>
-=- I think my friend is concerned about stuff, screen time and too much interaction being disruptive to a child&#39;s free development. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she thinks it&#39;s up to her to decide how much stuff, screen time or interaction is exactly right for her child&#39;s &quot;free development.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-can there be too much?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure.<br/>
<br/>
Too much noise, or too much parental yammering, or too much stuff.  And if the kid says &quot;too much!&quot; I think a parents should absolutely try to find ways to make things quieter, less overwhelming.    If the child is in on decisions about what to do and what to acquire and play with, and what movie to watch, and when to turn it off, all the problems above are eliminated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437312051">----Has anyone heard of Simplicity Parenting?-----<br/>
<br/>
It kind of reminds me of the Living Simple magazines and such--pay money to get more stuff that tells you how to spend less money and get rid of stuff ;-/<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking out loud here, but I wonder if there isn&#39;t a huge difference between boredom as experienced by schooled youth and that experienced my unschoolers? I&#39;m guessing that unschooling creates a space where children are more (naturally?) able to follow their interests and engage in something that makes them happy/entertained and their parents are more committed/skilled at assisting in the process. I can see this being significantly more difficult for schooled youth because they don&#39;t get to learn how to do that (follow their passions) in the first place, and even if they do know how, they often lack the time needed for such pursuits. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I&#39;ll ask Noor, &quot;Are you bored? Wanna shake things up a bit and go.......&quot;  Sometimes she&#39;ll jump at the chance and other times she&#39;ll say, &quot;no thanks.&quot; I do think that quiet, restful, contemplative times are beneficial--is that what boredom looks like? Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
---- (be more boring than the boredom, was recommended).-----<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really sure I know what that means.  Being boring and and feeling bored are completely different things, no?  Reminds me of that yucky mom-ism, &quot;Only boring people get bored&quot;<br/>

What&#39;s the claim? What do they say will happen if you do? Its good to look at all of that with the skepticism you would bring to looking at an advertisement - what are they &quot;selling&quot;, what&#39;s the fine print, and how do they substantiate their claims? <br/>
<br/>
My experience with the those kinds of theories is that they purport to magically turn children more creative and thoughtful. The underlying idea is that limits engender creativity. The trouble with that theory is that its based more in popular mythology and urban legend than in an understanding of the human mind. <br/>
<br/>
I wrote an article on the subject of limits and creativity awhile back and I&#39;ll link it rather than paraphrasing:<br/>

<br/>
One of the myths of boredom is that if you make a child bored long enough, he or she will suddenly get more creative, just to alleviate the boredom. It sounds like it should work... but boredom can lead as easily to apathy as to activity. Creative work needs to be inspired, not dulled into being. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589047353">Boredom and activity are two sides of the same coin  one is not inherently right or another wrong.  Trying to make one or the other happen, though, would become not-listening.   Inherently both are as necessary and interdependent just as being asleep and being awake.  Or birth and death.

<br/>
Our society seems to value activity and doing more than non-doing though. Trusting that both will happen in their own times would create a more listening balance.  Like, for example, many people feel more active during the full moon time.  Knowing these waves will come and go takes a lot of trust and knowing that the tendencies are greater than the individual to &quot;make it happen&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Where it can get tricky (for me at least) is when I start to listen to what others are doing (what schooled kids know or what other kids are doing) :  ie. comparison<br/>
Or listening to what society values:  doing, results, lots and lots of activity.<br/>
<br/>
In actuality both are necessary and natural.  The times of reflection, introspection and down-time nourish people as much as the active time.  I guess it could be said that &quot;learning&quot; is happening during both.  To strive to be active or strive to be bored, can create unbalance and non-listening.  Honoring both, in their own time, is honoring the whole person.  <br/>

I would think unschooling could work very well without much striving unless one needs to push against something/prove something, like the government wanting to see results.

To clarify, I put learning in quotations because, reflection or non-activity is not really learning, nor should it be probably.  Yet it is important, also.

<br/>
Once the question is brought to this list, it&#39;s not about what the people somewhere else meant anymore, though.  We&#39;re discussing how an idea works within the principles of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
As to definitions, let&#39;s use plain English and not redefine things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-UNHAPPILY bored may be an important difference-=-<br/>
<br/>
But there is no happy boredom.   Inactivity is not necessarily boredom, and boredom isn&#39;t always inactivity.  Sometimes a bored person will become destructive or whiny or disruptive.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Certainly, UNHAPPILY STIMULATED would not be helping a child have a grounded, self-reflecting life either. -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, and I don&#39;t think anyone should be (or is recommending) pressing activities on a child who is wanting some peace and quiet.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Striving was your word, not mine.<br/>
I have seen unschooling fail when mothers think there&#39;s nothing to it.   <br/>
I have seen people fail to understand unschooling because they had been advised not to try to do anything to create a rich, peaceful environment, but just to trust, or to visualize, or to wait.<br/>

Bored is a kid saying &quot;I&#39;m bored. There&#39;s nothing to do.&quot; (Or thinking  <br/>
or feeling it.) When you&#39;re bored, even staring out the window isn&#39;t  <br/>
interesting ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Bored is &quot;feeling weary because one is unoccupied or lacks interest in  <br/>
one&#39;s current activity.&quot; I don&#39;t see a way to be happily bored!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A more listening balance, would be valuing each equally.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What does listening have to do with valuing and balance? For me the  <br/>
phrase is adding a muddy layer over more direct terms like value and  <br/>
appreciate and understand.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would think unschooling could work very well without much striving<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It can to those it comes naturally to. But those who do it naturally  <br/>
don&#39;t generally need a list to help them figure it out! :-) This list  <br/>
is targeted at those who have baggage they want to get rid of.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would very definitely say it&#39;s learning. Activity isn&#39;t necessary  <br/>
for learning. In fact inactivity or being away doing something  <br/>
entirely different is an essential part of learning. It&#39;s when the  <br/>
brain quietly makes connections between ideas.<br/>

So it&#39;s about appearances not about connecting with kids to really  <br/>

If all a kid has is rocks and sticks, they&#39;ll turn those rocks and  <br/>
sticks into a wide variety of things. If a kid has a Pokemon, it&#39;s  <br/>
usually going to be a Pokemon.  To see the rich story telling the  <br/>
child doing, it takes more attention and more understanding of what  <br/>
the child is interested in.<br/>
<br/>
Einstein and Ferrari and e.e. cummings and Steve Jobs didn&#39;t build  <br/>
from sticks and stones. They built off of what others had created  <br/>
before. Kids shouldn&#39;t have to be made to reinvent story telling  <br/>

<br/>
I think that there are people who pine for what they tend to remember as the &quot;good old days,&quot; when things were supposedly simpler. Nostalgic memories are often more appealing than the reality of the times.  I was recently recalling cartoons or Saturday shows I used to watch as a child.  I used to watch something called &quot;HR Puffinstuff.&quot; My memories of it were that it was fairly entertaining and I enjoyed watching it.  I went to Youtube recently wondering what the reality was, and watched a clip of it.  Er, television shows have gotten exponentially better and more appealing, but that doesn&#39;t change my memory.  The memory is there of having enjoyed it.  My expectations have changed and I wouldn&#39;t make it through 5 minutes today.  I think technology feels scary to some people.  I have noticed that the majority of unschoolers seem to be very excited and happy about new technology.  There are new things to learn and try all the time.  I am definitely in that camp.  My family loves the latest gadgets and what they can do.  I would not like returning to simpler times at all.  I am sure we would find something to do if we were forced to adapt to no new gadgets, but given the choice, we would likely pick the new more interesting gadget and wonder what we could do with it.</div>

which I would never wish on anyone, especially my son or myself.  Boredom is<br/>
an uncomfortable place to find oneself.  Boredom needs an encouraging<br/>
friend.  To leave someone in this place seems cruel to me.  Transition or<br/>
contemplation, on the other hand, is where connections can be made.  Here<br/>
there seems to be more room for the parent or friend to stand back a bit,<br/>
give room and observe.  Although, sharing reflective, quiet times with<br/>
someone you love can be very rewarding as well.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I need to continue to strive for is knowing my son well enough<br/>
to hear what he is needing from me and for himself, and respond accordingly<br/>
and generously.<br/>

I think this is exactly where many parents get confused, equating boredom with daydreaming or contemplation or even something like &quot;zoning out&quot;. Any of those can be pleasant occupations but they aren&#39;t &quot;boredom&quot; which has connotations of dull inactivity coupled with the desire to do something else. <br/>
<br/>
The trouble is, you can&#39;t make another person contemplate or dream or even &quot;zone out&quot; but you can bore them and some people respond to boredom by looking for something else to do. When children are bored and then find something adults approve to do, adults may pat themselves on the back and say &quot;see, it works&quot; - but it only &quot;works&quot; now and then. More often kids who are bored do things adults find frustrating - they fall back on default strategies like picking fights with siblings, or doing things they &quot;aren&#39;t supposed to do&quot;, or they watch tv or play video games, or they eat. Not that tv and games are bad! but they shouldn&#39;t just be defaults. If kids are watching tv because home is boring, parents are falling down on the job. <br/>

A better way to phrase that would be in terms of choices. When my daughter chooses to contemplate the flow of water in the creek for an hour, that&#39;s no less marvelous than when she choose to jump on the trampoline for an hour, or build a dam across that same creek, or play a video game. Parents often think they need to take choices away from children so that the only choices left are good ones - but its not true, human beings are endlessly able to come up with less-than-perfect choices, and children who aren&#39;t supported by their parents are often set up to do that.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-468414906">-=-I used to watch something called &quot;HR Puffinstuff.&quot; My memories of it were that it was fairly entertaining and I enjoyed watching it. I went to Youtube recently wondering what the reality was, and watched a clip of it. Er, television shows have gotten exponentially better and more appealing, but that doesn&#39;t change my memory. The memory is there of having enjoyed it. My expectations have changed and I wouldn&#39;t make it through 5 minutes today. I think technology feels scary to some people.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I remember watching Taxi, a half-hour sitcom in the 1970&#39;s, and WKRP in Cincinnati, and LOVING the humor and the characters.<br/>
I bought some DVDs of those to show Holly, and they really weren&#39;t very good compared to things she has discovered on her own.  Perhaps part of the joy was that I watched it myself and decided I liked it, rather than it being something my parents &quot;assigned&quot; or recommended.<br/>
<br/>
They were kind of cutting-edge culturally, and the humor was about things that were new in those days, and very old now.  Not old enough to be of special interest.   <br/>
<br/>
Holly DID really like The Mary Tyler Moore Show, more than I did when it was new.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My expectations have changed and I wouldn&#39;t make it through 5 minutes today. I think technology feels scary to some people. I have noticed that the majority of unschoolers seem to be very excited and happy about new technology. There are new things to learn and try all the time. I am definitely in that camp. My family loves the latest gadgets and what they can do. I would not like returning to simpler times at all. I am sure we would find something to do if we were forced to adapt to no new gadgets, but given the choice, we would likely pick the new more interesting gadget and wonder what we could do with it.<br/>

In the medieval studies group I was in, sometimes there would be objections or disagreements to someone using a shortcut or something that was &quot;post period&quot; (not available before 1600).   The argument for using something (like duct tape, or elastic, or a microwave) is the humorously-stated &quot;If they&#39;d&#39;ve had it, they&#39;d&#39;ve used it.&quot;   That&#39;s true!   &quot;They&quot; are us, and as soon as they had more modern weapons, clothing, communications, dishes, imports, they DID use them!<br/>
<br/>
When families want to live like Little House on the Prairie or something, it seems like a horrible game of make-believe in which not all participants have agreed to play.   &quot;Let&#39;s pretend we don&#39;t live in 2011!&quot;    But they do.  And they should!  And life will be happier if the parents can figure out how to look forward to 2012, and 2021.<br/>
