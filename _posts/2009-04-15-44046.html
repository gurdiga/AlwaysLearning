<div id="ygrps-yiv-983959256">I&#39;ve been asked to arrange for a chat about when/whether/how it can be  <br/>
good or problematical for a family to use more than one language.<br/>
<br/>
Friday there&#39;s a chat planned already.   IF Hema in India and Pam in  <br/>
California can do something an hour or two earlier than that chat,  <br/>
then that will be the time (an hour or two earlier :-)<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, Friday&#39;s chat will be about bi- and tri-lingual families  <br/>
and language acquisition and that.<br/>
<br/>
The times in various places are listed here:<br/>

ALSO, if anyone has time and inclination to find things already  <br/>
written about this (archives of this or unschoolingdiscussion or  <br/>
unschooling.info or anything), please leave links here so people can  <br/>
get a head start.   Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127095955">I just wrote something on another list:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Live WAY more in the present than in the future, while knowing that how<br/>
you live in the present will largely determine how your children will<br/>
live in the future.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And then my daughter, Roxana, sent me this article:<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livescience.com/culture/090414-smile-marriage.html">http://www.livescience.com/culture/090414-smile-marriage.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here is the beginning of the article:<br/>
<br/>
Psychologists have found that how much people smile in old photographs <br/>
can predict their later success in marriage <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livescience.com/health/080205-spouse-negative.html">http://www.livescience.com/health/080205-spouse-negative.html</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
In one test, the researchers looked at people&#39;s college yearbook photos, <br/>
and rated their smile intensity from 1 to 10. None of the people who <br/>
fell within the top 10 percent of smile strength <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livescience.com/culture/081229-facial-expressions.html">http://www.livescience.com/culture/081229-facial-expressions.html</a>&gt; had <br/>
divorced, while within the bottom 10 percent of smilers, almost one in <br/>
four had had a marriage that ended, the researchers say. (Scoring was <br/>
based on the stretch in two muscles: one that pulls up on the mouth, and <br/>
one that creates wrinkles around the eyes.)<br/>
<br/>
In a second trial, the research team asked people over age 65 to provide <br/>
photos from their childhood (the average age in the pictures was 10 <br/>
years old). The researchers scored each person&#39;s smile, and found that <br/>
only 11 percent of the biggest smilers had been divorced, while 31 <br/>
percent of the frowners had experienced a broken marriage <br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livescience.com/topic/marriage">http://www.livescience.com/topic/marriage</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Overall, the results indicate that people who frown in photos are five <br/>
times more likely to get a divorce than people who smile.</div>

<br/>
Hema was in a chat the other day and commented on the smile lines in a  <br/>
photo I had sent a link to (not my chat-registration photo).<br/>
<br/>
She told us that in India people read the lines on people&#39;s faces and  <br/>
can tell what kind of person they are.<br/>
<br/>
Can that be faked?  I mean if a person just fakes a smile, will that  <br/>
improve marriages?   I&#39;ve heard (and don&#39;t know) that forcing a smile  <br/>
changes mood.  And there&#39;s not much difference between the look of  <br/>
about to cry and the look of giggling, sometimes (not always, but  <br/>
there is a crying that looks like laughing).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my guess:  there are glands all around our faces with which we  <br/>
can affect things scientists don&#39;t know about.   The same way dogs wag  <br/>
their tails to broadcast an information-providing scent, or stick the  <br/>
tail between their legs to hide a scent.  I think people who aren&#39;t  <br/>
powdered and perfumed would (do) exude information/signals.  And I  <br/>
think this might be THE most hidden/taboo area of instinct in the  <br/>
western world (and probably other cultures that use scent-masking  <br/>
perfumy stuff).<br/>
<br/>
But back to the other...<br/>
I went through a time when I was 30ish when I was probably clinically  <br/>
depressed and didn&#39;t know it.  I pulled myself back out of it with  <br/>
thought and effort.  But during that time a friend of mine told me she  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to hang around with me because I was too negative.   I&#39;ve  <br/>
never forgotten that moment.<br/>
<br/>
Every two or three years since, I&#39;ve had a down cycle, which has a  <br/>
couple of times turned to depression for which I went to my favorite  <br/>
counsellor and talked, and then to my whichever&#39;s on call doctor, and  <br/>
got anti-depressants.   I don&#39;t live there.  And if the down cycle  <br/>
comes while I&#39;m mentally strong and alert, I can keep myself  <br/>
functional and cheery, but during those times I avoid my friends  <br/>
partly so that I don&#39;t depress them too.<br/>
<br/>
Usually I&#39;m zippy and funny and energetic.   Feeling what that feels  <br/>
like helps me induce it later.  And I&#39;m wondering if laughing and  <br/>
singing (which I consciously do when I want to lift my mood) are  <br/>
physically hooked in to biochemicals that cheer moods.  And maybe it  <br/>
has to do with stretching certain parts of the facial skin and muscles  <br/>
which affect something... blood flow or teensy glands or secretions  <br/>
within cells or whatnot.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the frowning thing is why people don&#39;t get better in mental  <br/>
hospitals; they often get worse.  Like prison, if a minor offender  <br/>
goes, he can come out a pissed off major offender.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had heard that forcing a smile will change your mood.  I do that.  If<br/>
I catch myself frowning or being more concerned than usual, I&#39;ll smile,<br/>
and there is a lightness and lifting that happens.<br/>
<br/>
When Chamille was a tiny baby, I&#39;d rock her to sleep in my arms,<br/>
sometimes while nursing and sometimes after she was done.  I&#39;d catch<br/>
myself frowning, because I was tired and needed to sleep or get things<br/>
done before I was able to sleep and I needed my baby to be asleep.  I&#39;d<br/>
be concentrating on all that stuff and it would cause me to frown, or at<br/>
least look concerned.  So, I&#39;d consciously put a smile on my face, so<br/>
that my little baby would see me smiling at her as she fell asleep.  By<br/>
doing that, it always helped me relax in the moment and enjoy that small<br/>
thing of puting my baby in her bed.  It was something that left me<br/>
feeling refreshed almost.  It had everything to do with smiling!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I<br/>

&gt; western world (and probably other cultures that use scent-masking<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chamille has always been hugely perceptive of this stuff, body language,<br/>
scents, all of that, and the ways that people hide things.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Usually I&#39;m zippy and funny and energetic. Feeling what that feels<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you are onto something with that!  I think we can tap into that<br/>
consciously!  I give myself pep talks sometimes.  I do that with my kids<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe the frowning thing is why people don&#39;t get better in mental<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone is mentally injured, I think one of the worst things that<br/>
person could do, is to be around other mentally injured people.  They<br/>
stay in that place, instead of being inspired out of it.  That&#39;s not to<br/>
say that all mental injury can be changed like that.  I&#39;m thinking more<br/>
about people who end up in mental institutions because they&#39;ve tried to<br/>
commit suicide, or some other tragic thing.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest cousin, was part of the first wave of the three strikes and<br/>
your out, in CA.  He was young and needed help and did something minor<br/>
and stupid, but the legal system used him as an example as a first timer<br/>
of that three strikes law.  He never recovered from that.  It left him<br/>
scarred, and feeling like a criminal, and he lived up to that for the<br/>
rest of his life.</div>

keep an eye out for which time gets selected.<br/>

We speak English, Kannada, Hindi and some Marathi.  And my husband can also<br/>
speak Telugu.  These are all, believe it or not, separate Indian languages!<br/>
However Kannada and Telugu share the same script.  Hindi and Marathi share<br/>
the same script too... but again otherwise completely different. And I can<br/>
read and write Arabic.. I&#39;ve lost the vocabulary though.<br/>

So ya... lots of languages here.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-933766463">This idea is intriguing for me as a unschooler.  A smile is an <br/>
experience, or an experiment if you will, that serves as a great <br/>
personal information gathering opportunity.  How does one create <br/>
learning if not through such things as smiling and frowning, giving and <br/>
receiving, going away and arriving, and associating the effects on <br/>
oneself and others?  To me, that&#39;s much of what unschooling is all <br/>
about.<br/>
