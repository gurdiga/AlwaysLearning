<div id="ygrps-yiv-548714824">Hi all,<br/>
For the short term i may have to do some paid work.  i am fine about this as i can earn more being a qualified teacher.  Don&#39;t really know if i am asking a question here.  just knowing it will be a bit odd returning to the classroom after 8 years at home and knowing what i know now about a better way of being with children.  I am only going in the capacity of teacher&#39;s assistant so i guess i can &quot;do my thing&quot; in a small way and try and make it as painless and fun for them as possible.<br/>
any others had a similar experience?<br/>

I think the problem will not be with the family (except indirectly), but with the emotional response of the unschooling mom to working in a classroom. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe concentrate on finding ways not to become attached to any sorrows or frustrations you perceive in the children at school, so that you can go home filled with love and patience, rather than becoming a bundle of &quot;OMG!&quot; from what you see and feel at school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339740036">cara, thanks but yes it&#39;s true what sandra said i think the family will be ok as dad will be looking after them so no problems there.  my children are 10,6 and 4 and it will only be two mornings a week.  <br/>
i think it is as sandra said &quot;more the emotional response of the unschooling mom to working in a classroom. &quot;.<br/>
will check out the links :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-886461923">I feel your reactions and responses after interacting with school and<br/>
schoolly stuff is going to be the challenge. I have been a teacher in<br/>
a public school for 6 years or so. That was 5 years back. If someone<br/>
told me to go back I would really find that tough. In fact many kids<br/>
call me for help with school work in German language at home (I have<br/>
done that for 10 years earlier too), but now I keep pushing it off,<br/>
since I don&#39;t know how to tackle that anymore.<br/>
<br/>
 I too need to get over this soon because I love teaching German to<br/>
the children!!. It is so fulfilling for me. and also it is one way to<br/>
stay home and earn an income for me. I need the income.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-672841306">hi dola and everyone,<br/>
went into day and it was fine.  i did realise how much i am blessed being able to have my children at home and not in school.   the boredom levels were quite high :-),for me and i am sure for most of them.  but i did enjoy being with the children and chatting to them and helping them with their &quot;work.&quot;<br/>
