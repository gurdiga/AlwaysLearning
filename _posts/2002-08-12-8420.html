<div id="ygrps-yiv-208842738">We have been &quot;de-fooding&quot; for about 2 months now.<br/>
It is a success.  I no longer require the kids to eat things they don&#39;t<br/>
like. I no longer restrict snacks.<br/>
I buy healthy and no-so-healthy food.  They choose equally for the most part<br/>
from all the foods.<br/>
<br/>
Our son who normally who turns his nose up at anything new is now trying and<br/>
liking lots of new foods.  Our daughter who used to sneak snacks is now<br/>
snacking less frequently (and many times on fruits & veggies).  Both the<br/>
kids have dropped some weight and are happier with meal times.  If they hate<br/>
what I cooked they can have something else (something that does not require<br/>
me to cook a second meal)<br/>
<br/>
There are 2 small restrictions that still remain and the kids are very<br/>
agreeable to them....<br/>
1) they have to ask before they have pop, in case there is not much left<br/>
(they have many other drink choices as well)<br/>
2) if a food item is part of a planned meal (which are posted on the fridge<br/>
weekly) they should not eat it all and screw up the menu plans.<br/>
<br/>
We currently have Oreos, ice cream, wafer cookies, chocolate covered<br/>
peanuts, pokemon fruit snacks, etc in the house.  These items were bought<br/>
over 2 weeks ago.  Normally they would have been gone in a few days.  Dole<br/>
fruit bowls (mandarin oranges) are like GOLD around here, so is apple juice<br/>
and bananas.  My birthday cake was not completely finished off and had to be<br/>
thrown out once it got old. (that is a first!)<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to see that this is working out for us.  I have always had issues<br/>
with food.  I am very overweight now, always have been.  I started my first<br/>
diet at age 10 at my mother&#39;s request.  She still asks about my weight every<br/>
time I see her.  I noticed that I used to eat alot of junk food when I was<br/>
around my parents.  Now I try to make healthier choices.<br/>
I was happily surprised to find (when I visited my doc last week) that I<br/>
have lost about 6 pounds in 4 weeks.  Slow & steady, without suffering and<br/>
without effort.  So this new way of dealing with food is working for me as<br/>
well.<br/>

We have the same thing going on here.  We&#39;ve got a full carton of<br/>
ice cream, chocolate raisins and a 1/4 pack of Oreos (that I will<br/>
have to throw away because they&#39;re probably stale by now!).<br/>
Today we had instant pudding for the first time and Tamzin had a<br/>
few bites and didn&#39;t want anymore because it was too sweet<br/>
&lt;g&gt;.  I truly believe that if you don&#39;t restrict food choices they will<br/>
eat a balanced and overall a healthy diet.<br/>
I also believe that you don&#39;t necessarily have to get all your<br/>
nutrients in one day.  I think that if your kid eats nothing but french<br/>
bread with butter on it for a day and then eats loads of fruit the<br/>
next day (as Tamzin did a few days ago at my mom&#39;s house<br/>
&lt;g&gt;), then it all evens out in the body in the long run.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
if I&#39;m making any sense about this to anyone, I&#39;m having a hard<br/>
time explaining it somehow.<br/>
I know, from two different friend&#39;s experiences, that you have to<br/>
allow time to de-food (just like de-schooling) if kids have been<br/>
used to having food controlled.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Zan!  That&#39;s so cool!<br/>
<br/>
I enjoyed your whole success-reporting post.<br/>
<br/>
My husband used to eat after the kids.  He would always finish their plates, <br/>
if we were at a restaurant or at home.  We discussed it several times, and he <br/>
was agitated about &quot;food going to waste.&quot;   He&#39;s the kind of guy whose mom <br/>
shames him about his weight constantly, and she blamed me (when I was still <br/>
paying attention to her, years ago) for having whole milk and real butter in <br/>
the house.  She has starved her own husband down to skinniness, and he IS 80, <br/>
so she MUST be right.  <br/>
<br/>
So I discussed with Keith that if ALL the food passes through a person and <br/>
causes health problems, or just fattens them up unnecessarily, that&#39;s more <br/>
wasteful than giving it to the dog (who also needs to eat) or putting it in <br/>
the compost pile (which also needs fibrous input).<br/>
<br/>
And finally he calmed down about &quot;waste.&quot;  He was used to every morsel being <br/>
consumed at his house, but he had two older and also-big brothers, and the <br/>
mom liked to try to starve them all with controlled access, timed meals, and <br/>
small portions.<br/>
<br/>
So?  They got jobs and ate out in addition to eating at home.  They sneaked <br/>
food.  They  hung around other houses and ate there.  Her &quot;control&quot; was an <br/>
illusion.  Their disdain for her was pretty real, though.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son&#39;s best friend is a fat kid with super-controlling parents (both are<br/>
teachers, hmm...).  Neither parent is obese, but both kids are.  The parents<br/>
load the plates with food, demand they clean them, then send the kids to fat<br/>
camp.  They think I&#39;m awful, because my kids have NEVER had to clean a<br/>
plate, and as yet, neither has eaten a vegetable or a fruit.  (They&#39;re 12<br/>
and 15, btw.)  They drink orange and white grape juice, though.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of things influenced my decision to let them eat as they please.<br/>
One was my pediatrician, who, when I asked about forcing 3-y.o. Laura to eat<br/>
*everything,* (dh was channeling mil&#39;s criticism for her :-P ), dear<br/>
pediatrician pointed out that forcing creates more problems than missing the<br/>
particular food.  He noted that she was growing, was perfectly healthy, and<br/>
if it made ME feel better, I could slip some spinach in a lasagna once in<br/>
awhile.  I hate spinach lasagna, so that wasn&#39;t going to happen &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I later found a book called &quot;Let Them Eat Cake,&quot; written a few years ago by<br/>
some M.D.&#39;s, which is about this very topic.  Nothing like having experts<br/>
back you up when you&#39;re an insecure mom with bozos trying to tell you how to<br/>
live.<br/>

This reminds me.  Ever since we started De-fooding, our dog (who was<br/>
underweight) has now reached a healthy weight.  I tend to still cook as if<br/>
we were all starving at meal times, so we always have left overs now, and<br/>
the dog is very happy about that!<br/>

essential to me that all the critters get appropriate<br/>
treats from the left-overs. I can&#39;t just throw it all<br/>
in the compost....and NEVER in the trash.  No food in<br/>
the trash.  Can&#39;t do it. <br/>
<br/>
When the older boys were little and had little boy<br/>
spills, I would selfishly cry at night (feeling sorr<br/>
for myself) becuase I couldn&#39;t have coffee and<br/>
half/half becuase what they had spilled needed<br/>
replacing. Even then, though, the critters got the<br/>
spilled or spoiled things. Just couldn&#39;t waste food.<br/>
