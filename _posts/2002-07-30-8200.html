<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lisa,<br/>
I had to respond because you son has a lot of issues<br/>
in common with my older son, who is 5.5 years.  Thomas<br/>
has sensory integration issues, many allergies, very<br/>
little patience, anger management problems, compulsive<br/>
and obsessive behaviors, is extremely cuddley and<br/>
needy.  Most of his bigtime cuddles take place in the<br/>
morning, often watching tv with his daddy or I before<br/>
the day really starts.  He is an early riser.  He<br/>
cannot wear many types of clothes, only soft cloth<br/>
pants and shirts, tags cut out, no big seams, no thick<br/>
or stiff material, no tight cuffs, no collars, no<br/>
short pants, no short sleeves, socks inside out, shoes<br/>
loose.   He is often naked.  He wants his hair cut<br/>
short enough not to brush his neck but long enough not<br/>
to have cowlicks (his hair is one of his obsessive<br/>
things.)<br/>
<br/>
Thomas doesn&#39;t respond well to authority and fights<br/>
tooth and nail against being thwarted.  He is<br/>
passionate, impatient, strong willed, stubborn,<br/>
artistic and creative.<br/>
<br/>
He also experienced a change of personality watching<br/>
too much tv, and was obsessive about the tv.  Too much<br/>
tv made him very hard to live with, and increased his<br/>
frustration and stress level to such a degree that it<br/>
was really making him miserable.  He required that no<br/>
one talk above a whisper in the room where he was<br/>
watching tv, because he could not properly filter the<br/>
noise out.  He was really controlling about what we<br/>
watched.  So we stopped getting tv, local channels<br/>
have not come in well or many in any place that we<br/>
have lived, so not taking cable means no real tv<br/>
access.  Instead we watch videos and DVDs or he plays<br/>
computer games or does things online.  The different<br/>
pace of commercial tv, and the commercials themselves,<br/>
were just overloading him to the point that he was not<br/>
pleasant to live with and he was not capable of<br/>
handling normal daily stress.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I have had many doctors tell me when we have<br/>
had him evaluated for his behavioral issues, is that<br/>
he is on sensory overload (right before they all tell<br/>
me he needs drugs.)  His senory integration, for lack<br/>
of a better way to term his problem, although I<br/>
recognize that labels are insufficient, doesn&#39;t enable<br/>
him to process too much sensory information at one<br/>
time.  His ability to filter different sensory input<br/>
is limited and the more stimulation he has the worse<br/>
it gets.  So quiet is good for him, being at home is<br/>
good for him, no commercial tv is good for him.  At<br/>
least until he is older and better able to filter<br/>
sensory input without getting overloaded.  I consider<br/>
this a parenting decision to protect his well being,<br/>
sanity, self esteem and family harmony.<br/>
<br/>
We have a Homeopathic family doctor, but Thomas<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to take the supplements that she gave us,<br/>
and it is a lot to expect of him to take all these<br/>
things every day.  She believes that early stress<br/>
affected his nervous system, immune system and<br/>
digestive system.  Thus he has so many allergies and<br/>
is unable to deal well with stress, among other<br/>
things.  We are still working on finding a good<br/>
solution to these issues.  But we did go all organic,<br/>
and eliminated a few more allergens from his diet, as<br/>
well as greatly reduced his sugar intake.  That has<br/>
helped in his ability to deal with daily stress and<br/>
his attention span.  With less chemicals for his body<br/>
to deal with, he is better able to focus his energy<br/>
where he wants and needs it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if any of this will help. But I do<br/>
aympathize, and you are not alone in dealing with<br/>
these issues with your son.  Good luck in finding the<br/>
right solutions for your son and your family.<br/>
