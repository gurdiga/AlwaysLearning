<div id="ygrps-yiv-699721478">I had side mail and responded, and mentioned Lori Odhner as a possible  <br/>
resource, and looked Lori up to make sure she was findable, and we  <br/>
communicated.  Lori (who with Carol Rice was one of the two La Leche  <br/>
League leaders who so profoundly changed my life when Kirby was a  <br/>
baby) said she loved reading &quot;Public School on your own Terms,&quot; an  <br/>
article I had sent in the e-mail response to the other mom.   So I  <br/>
went to read it to see what Lori would&#39;ve seen.<br/>
<br/>
I have changed in twelve years.  Most people have, probably, so that&#39;s  <br/>
not a big deal, but because this article is really out there in many  <br/>
places (in Linda Dobson&#39;s book, and so in Japanese, and various other  <br/>
places), I wanted to bring one little passage here and say something  <br/>
for the record.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-In families in which student-directed learning is the primary  <br/>
focus, children taking control of their own learning by deciding  <br/>
whether to pursue it at home or at school can be liberating for all  <br/>
involved, and educational in the extreme for their teachers.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Although the ideal might be children who have never gone to school  <br/>
a day in their lives, reality isn�t always ideal.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was writing for a newsletter in California which was not &quot;a radical  <br/>
unschooling newsletter&quot; (not that anything was, twelve years ago), but  <br/>
was a politically-leaning &quot;reject government schools&quot; newsletter.  I  <br/>
lost my gig as an invited, featured columnist over this article.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BUT anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I no longer use terms like &#39;Student directed learning,&quot; or &quot;taking  <br/>
control of their own learning.&quot;  I quit thinking that way a long time  <br/>
ago, and I was using phrases others were using anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This phrase which sounds really inspiring, maybe, is also not in my  <br/>
current voice or vocabulary:  &quot;The philosophies of choice, freedom,  <br/>
child-led learning, �bliss-led learning,� and personal responsibility  <br/>
can be honored and spread to new audiences by parents treating  <br/>
children as humans with rights and responsibilities whether they are  <br/>
sixteen, twelve, or eight years old.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to include all the terms in use in those days to describe  <br/>
unschooling.  I certainly get it all and can defend it, but &quot;child-led  <br/>
learning&quot; has caused problems for people trying to get unschooling to  <br/>
work.  I used to assume that people would begin with a busy, enriched  <br/>
and enriching life, but not everyone was making the same assumption or  <br/>
starting from the same place.  Some said &quot;We&#39;re unschooling, starting  <br/>
now,&quot; and then watched the kids to see when they were going to take  <br/>
control or direct their own learning.<br/>
<br/>
Choices in an environment maintained with learning in mind are  <br/>
different from choices in a quiet, boring place.  If I were a kid, my  <br/>
choice in a quiet, boring place would be to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Also when I write that, in 1996, Holly was five years old.  Now she&#39;s  <br/>
nearly eighteen.   -=-Although the ideal might be children who have  <br/>
never gone to school a day in their lives, reality isn�t always ideal.- <br/>
=-    Holly has been to school five or six days in her life, but she  <br/>
was visiting, not enrolled, and wasn&#39;t always visiting a class of  <br/>
people her own age.<br/>
<br/>
Because I didn&#39;t compromise my beliefs, and continued to clarify and  <br/>
strengthen them through discussions with other unschoolers, I have  <br/>
children who have never gone to school.  A full set.  This is better  <br/>
for me than a college degree.  I&#39;ve done something really special now,  <br/>
something I&#39;m proud of.  I stuck with a project for nineteen years.  I  <br/>
was willing to let the kids choose not to stay home, and so I took  <br/>
that gamble knowing that if home wasn&#39;t interesting enough school  <br/>
still existed.  If school was better than home, there it always was,  <br/>
walking distance from the house.<br/>
<br/>
For a while Holly did consider going to middle school.  She asked kids  <br/>
about what they liked and didn&#39;t like, and she would sit outside when  <br/>
school let out and watch all the kids, see what they were wearing,  <br/>
observe the fashions of how to wear what kinds of backpacks, and think  <br/>
about it.   We talked about what she might need to do if she wanted to  <br/>
go, and while I wasn&#39;t wholly encouraging, I was willing.  She would  <br/>
have needed to practice her handwriting, and learn the pledge of  <br/>
allegiance and a few things like that.  Not much.  She stayed home,  <br/>
though, and so I have &quot;the ideal&quot; as I stated it when Holly was  <br/>
&quot;kindergarten age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t register Holly to homeschool.  I had a backup plan (a copy of  <br/>
the registration papers, notarized with a date, in case anyone asked;  <br/>
I hadn&#39;t sent it in, though).  I did that for a few years.  The  <br/>
state&#39;s processes and policies changed for registration, so I quit  <br/>
even doing that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m rambling now, but it takes a while to tell twelves years.<br/>
<br/>
