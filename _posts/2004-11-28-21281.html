<div id="ygrps-yiv-460929308">It&#39;s Sunday  morning.  Later today I&#39;m going no-mail because we&#39;re going on a <br/>
family vacation, driving.  I&#39;ll be back late the 8th, if all goes to schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Trips like this scare me.  I&#39;m afraid of car trouble or accidents, or of a <br/>
kid being sick or wounded far from home.  I like the feeling of being out and <br/>
seeing new things and being with other unschoolers (that&#39;s most of my focus this <br/>
time, while Kirby and Marty have a gaming focus, going to GenCon, and Holly <br/>
has a roller coaster focus, and Keith is our heroic and patient protector).  I <br/>
like being with my family away from scattery schedules and distractions.  But <br/>
packing and actually driving away is a stressful thing for me.<br/>
<br/>
We have a housesitter one of the kids&#39; friends. I didn&#39;t tell him I always <br/>
give the dog a snack at night. Cheese, or meat.  I might forget.   I didn&#39;t tell <br/>
him I turn the cat food over if it&#39;s getting dry overnight.  It&#39;s not too <br/>
late to tell him.<br/>
<br/>
This is one thing I don&#39;t want my kids to learn from me, this hesitation and <br/>
worry and fear.  So I pretend courage, and I just ask them to help me <br/>
checklist the preparations.  They&#39;re pretty good at that.    It&#39;s one time I  keep my <br/>
fears as secret as I can, though.<br/>
<br/>
For people newish to this list, I thought I should make the reassurance that <br/>
I don&#39;t mind it sitting quiet for long stretches of time and then being busy.  <br/>
And if anyone wishes it weren&#39;t so quiet, there are other busier lists and <br/>
some of them are listed with links here:<br/>

<br/>
All my kids are teens now and two of them drive.  I remember family trips <br/>
where I had to fasten two kids&#39; seatbelts every time we got back in the car.  Now <br/>
I don&#39;t even have to pack for them.  But they&#39;re willing to go on a family <br/>
vacation!  I think many families with would find it difficult to impossible to <br/>
get happy agreement and cooperation from an 18 and 16 year old, so I do feel <br/>
good about that.  Every nuclear family experience could be the last, I&#39;ve been <br/>
thinking for two years now.  There are no significant others or grandchildren <br/>
yet.  I&#39;m trying to imprint these days on my happy-memory mind.<br/>
<br/>
I know some of you are still in the little-kids stage, and that&#39;s exhausting, <br/>
so this might not be something you can identify with at all.  Someday, <br/>
though, you won&#39;t have to be the one to know where all the shoes and jackets are.  <br/>
You won&#39;t have to pack a diaper bag or sippie cups.  It seemed those days would <br/>
never end, but they did.   The days we have now, it seems likely they could <br/>
end tomorrow.  Age and perspective.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you braver than I am, wish me some of your calm, please. It will <br/>
be snowing in Gallup, they say, and all my eggs will be in one basket.  (It&#39;s <br/>
a Chevy conversion basket with a nice CD player and a bed in the back.  <br/>
Still, I&#39;m afraid.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-265516802">I wish you a safe and enjoyable trip Sandra.  Lots of deep breaths will get<br/>
you through your worried spells.  If something does happen to your car, you<br/>
have brave Keith there to save the day and you all seem creative enough to<br/>
make the best out of any situation.  Have fun!  Leave a note about the<br/>
animals for your house sitter.  Leave your phone number and instructions<br/>
that they can call for any reason, no matter how small.  It&#39;ll make you feel<br/>
better.  I understand your stress over the situation.  I also hope I don&#39;t<br/>
pass that on to my kids.  <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92763272">Have fun Sandra!<br/>
I look forward to your family stories/experiences.<br/>
Sounds like one of those neat family trips that your kids will always  <br/>
remember and tell their children or friends.<br/>
I keep thinking of that Willie Nelson song &quot;On the road again&quot;<br/>
