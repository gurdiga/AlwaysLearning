<div id="ygrps-yiv-549421470">I am having difficulties watching war movies with our son who so wants me to share this passion with him.<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger I could watch war movies with no problem.  About 10 years ago I began to get extremely stressed out with action movies.  Now I&#39;ve noticed that I get extremely sad - not so much stressed out but sad to the point of tears running down my cheeks with war movies.  The human suffering gets to me and I don&#39;t know why - I feel it so deeply the soldier&#39;s suffering and their families back home.<br/>
<br/>
Watching on a small TV screen does not help.<br/>
<br/>
I can watch documentaries with no problem - which show real footage.<br/>
<br/>
Oh I should also say the movies that bother me so much are from a time period of around the American Revolution to current.  Meaning if I watch a movie about the Romans it does not make me sad.<br/>
<br/>
Specifically Zac has been watching WWI movies the past 2 weeks and it just breaks my heart and I stay sad for several hours.<br/>
<br/>
This sadness actually caught me off guards.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions on how to enjoy these movies with Zac ?<br/>
<br/>

Find someone else to watch with him, maybe.  Or while he&#39;s watching, find a website with discussion of the movie, and send him a link.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s heartbreaking for you to immerse yourself in those thoughts, don&#39;t do it.<br/>
