<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405752335">I f I had a child, traumatized or not, that had big needs of total attention and I was giving her only the prescribed 10-20-10  do you think that would be fulfilling her needs??<br/>
<br/>
When a child needs your attention give it to her. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you want to measure, measure generously. If you want to give, give generously. If you want to unschool, or be a mindful parent, give, give, give. You&#39;ll find after a few years that you still have everything you thought you had given away, and more.&quot; Sandra Dodd<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 hack my kids needed way more than 40 minutes of undivided attention when they were 4. <br/>
As they grow older they need it less.<br/>
<br/>
But some kids have bigger needs then others.  <br/>
<br/>
If you need water and someone gives you a glass and you still need more water but they tell you that was enough , did the need for water go away?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1594922091">The 10-20-10 is meant to be the minimum, not a limit.  The trauma therapist<br/>
who designed it was assuming that the child would be in school and that<br/>
both parents (or the single parent) would be working outside the home.  In<br/>
reality, many traumatized children do need much more. My daughter did and<br/>
still does.   That&#39;s why I am at home with her 24/7.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you have a child who needs a lot of attention, being there right when he wakes up is a good idea - no need to limit it to 10 minutes! That&#39;s a good example of what I mean by offering attention proactively: don&#39;t wait for your kid to come to you, plan on being there ahead of time. I resisted that kind of thinking at first, when Ray was little. He needed soooooo much attention and the idea of giving him more seemed overwhelming. But it made such a difference to actively choose to do it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;your child may<br/>
&gt; be considerably younger emotionally than their chronological age<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s also fairly common for parents with their first child to have wildly unrealistic expectations as to what&#39;s developmentally normal. Kids with big vocabularies in particular can &quot;fake out&quot; parents, who expect them to understand (intellectually and emotionally) more than they&#39;re really capable of grasping. <br/>
<br/>
It helps to assume your kids are doing the best they can with the resources they have. If your child is struggling, he&#39;s struggling! He&#39;s not trying to drive you crazy or run your life, he&#39;s trying to get his needs met and, being a child, doesn&#39;t have a lot of good ways to do so. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538602843">-=-When my 10 year old reverts to age 2<br/>

 <br/>
I think unschooling requires that parents meet their children where they are, and that will vary with any child.  It&#39;s harmful to think of it as &quot;reverting,&quot; instead of seeing that &quot;maturity&quot; and age are not smooth curves with no variations.  Sometimes adults want to be silly, and sometimes adults are stressed and feel helpless and frustrated and need help.  Sometimes a child can step up and be extremely responsible for a while, and then might want to suck her thumb and fall asleep with a lovey.  That&#39;s normal.<br/>
<br/>
I can see how the 10-20-10 formula would work for a family where the child was in school, or one of many foster children, and the parent was busy with a fulltime job or many other foster children, and it could be a helpful therapeutic tool.  And it might be helpful for the mom of the four year old who needs to take some steps back herself and bond differently.<br/>
<br/>
For advice for a family where the child is home as much as unschoolers are, it seems a tiny bit of time and attention.<br/>
<br/>
When families are separated by work and school, they might only know each other slightly, after a while.  Good unschoolers will learn to know each child&#39;s interests and temperaments, moods and fears, if they&#39;re doing it right and well.<br/>
