<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043531020">My daughter has a friend, whose father is the strict follow the <br/>
rules (that are always changing) or else you&#39;ll get it, kinda guy. My <br/>
daughter seems to really enjoy this little girls company so mostly <br/>
they play here.  But sometimes the father feels his daughter spends <br/>
to much time here and they should play at his home.  Today my <br/>
daughter played at their house.  When she came home she was quick to <br/>
tell me, the father spanked her and A.  &quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  My daughter says, &quot;We were pretending to be zombies, with dry scaly <br/>
skin, and when we said AHHHH!  the little sister pretended to be <br/>
scared so she screamed.&quot;  At this point the father told them to &quot;Stop <br/>
scaring the little sister.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I asked my daughter if they were trying to scare the her.  She says <br/>
they were not and that she was laughing and playing with them.  Well <br/>
they continued to play and the little sister screamed again to which <br/>
the father said I told you to stop then spanked my daughter and her <br/>
friend and warned them if they did it again he was going to &quot;get the <br/>
belt&quot;.......<br/>
<br/>
  Breathe........breathe.....breathe.....(talking to myself here)..<br/>
<br/>
 So there is no question that I will be speaking to this man. But it <br/>
could be more.<br/>
<br/>
  What I am looking for are your suggestions.  I see this as (maybe) <br/>
an opportunity to speak to this man about other options in <br/>
parenting. By the way, his wife is a doll and I really like her. <br/>
<br/>
  You see his child, of all my childrens friends, (I have four <br/>
children)is by far the worst behaved.  I know it is because of his <br/>
oppression.  The very issues he has the tightest rules on in his home <br/>
are the very same things she takes advantage of in my home.  <br/>
<br/>
  An example is food.  Food is tightly regulated in their home,  <br/>
where they eat, how much, and not a bit is to be wasted EVER.  So in <br/>
my home she is always wasting food, by that I mean taking way more <br/>
then she can eat then throwing it away.  Manners are strictly <br/>
enforced in her home, when she is here you would hardly know she had <br/>
any.  These are small examples (there are more) but proof that the <br/>
father is creating the exact opposite of what he wants. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Do you think it is possible for me to help this family and in doing <br/>
so help my daughters friend?  Or should I just deal with the spanking <br/>
issue and continue to set an example of how life can be different and <br/>
joyful with children. I know he sees the joy my family has. <br/>
<br/>
oh, my dd Elaine is 7 almost 8.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; Do you think it is possible for me to help this family and in doing<br/>
&gt; so help my daughters friend?  Or should I just deal with the spanking<br/>
&gt; issue and continue to set an example of how life can be different and<br/>
&gt; joyful with children. I know he sees the joy my family has.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s pretty hard to make a difference with someone who isn&#39;t looking to<br/>
change, and unfortunately I doubt he is. It does no harm to try, so you<br/>
might print out a list of parenting books or websites or clip an article for<br/>
him or whatever you have to hand.<br/>
<br/>
What I would tell him is that your daughter is not to be hit, ever, and if<br/>
he cannot guarantee that that won&#39;t happen she can&#39;t be at his house without<br/>
you, ever. (Okay, actually I wouldn&#39;t let her be at his house without me<br/>
ever again anyway. :/)<br/>
<br/>
This is the second note I&#39;ve read in a week about someone spanking someone<br/>
else&#39;s child while they were at another house. I find this absolutely<br/>
ASTONISHING, just when I had thought I could no longer be astonished.<br/>

And it probably REALLY tics him off.<br/>
<br/>
I think you should not talk to him.  I think you should put your concerns in <br/>
writing.<br/>
That way you can say everything you need to say and he will really have to <br/>
read it.<br/>
And his wife can read it.<br/>
And you can keep a copy.<br/>
<br/>
I would tell him you like having his daughter over, it&#39;s great, and you hope <br/>
to have her over for many years, but that you&#39;re unwilling to have your <br/>
daughter there until and unless he can reassure you that he will never again <br/>
lay a hand on her.  And that if he DOES ever under any circumstances again <br/>
hit her you will call the police and charge him with assault.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s IF your daughter&#39;s willing to risk losing contact for a while with the <br/>
other girl.<br/>
Or if you&#39;re willing to go one step further and tell him that if he allows <br/>
your communication to cut off the girls&#39; friendship you might call the police <br/>
anyway and explain to them why.<br/>
<br/>
This is me being first-pass reactionary.  I&#39;ll probably not feel so sharply <br/>
threatening if I sleep on it and think about it. <br/>
<br/>
But I WOULD absolutely and unquestionably put whatever I said in writing and <br/>
keep a copy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723363839">oh man, I would be so beyond mad.  <br/>
<br/>
This man would never ever be alone with my child again.  The children <br/>
would play at my house.   I would want to bring charges against him for <br/>
hitting a child, and I might even investigate that, but of course, if I <br/>
did that, there would be no further friendship between the children or <br/>
our families, but then, I don&#39;t think I would care. I don&#39;t think I <br/>
could ever look at a person who hit my child again, let alone be in the <br/>
same room with him or be a friend with him.  But then, I consider it <br/>
abuse to hit a child, any child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357323191">I am fairly new on this list and have been reading for about a week, but I just had to jump in on this topic.  Like everyone else who responded, I am completely appalled that this man would spank your child.  I agree with others that only addressing the spanking  is probably the best route to take.  If you decide to have a conversation with him, I would be sure to have it with him and his wife together.  Also, I would not tell him about his daughter&#39;s behavior in your home.  He sounds like the kind of man who would become more punitive if he learned that he did not have control of her behavior outside of the home.  Life might become considerably worse for her. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-19170248">WOW!!!  IMHO There would be no point in talking to this person as he<br/>
doesn&#39;t get it that it&#39;s not ok to deal with his anger about his<br/>
inability to control everyone and everything  in the manner he did.<br/>
Obviously this man has some big time control issues and if he&#39;s spanking<br/>
your child then he&#39;s spanking his own easily.  As for the wife being a<br/>
&quot;doll&quot; that can be a problem.  She is weak and is maybe receiving the<br/>
same treatment from him, even if it&#39;s verbal abuse.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I would not let my child go to that house again and after thinking about<br/>
this since I read it last night I think I would talk to the mother about<br/>
the father&#39;s behavior and find out whether this is a typical pattern of<br/>
his and see where she&#39;s at on this.  If this is all ok with her then I&#39;d<br/>
call the police.  Yes my son would be upset that he&#39;d lost a friend, but<br/>
I think he would be more upset if I did nothing to protect him from this<br/>
bully.  I would sit down and explain to him what happened, what I did<br/>
and why I did it. I think if I didn&#39;t do that I would be also sending a<br/>
message that in order to have the friend that you want the price you<br/>
have to pay is being beaten.  I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a lesson I want my son<br/>
to learn.<br/>

(Well if they are still friends far into the future that may <br/>
change).  My dd. and I  talked and she is a bit sad to hear this, <br/>
because she understands she will most likey not be able to play as <br/>
often but she also agrees that the father can not be trusted.<br/>
<br/>
  The mother at this house feels her husband is to strict, we have <br/>
had a couple of small conversations.  I do not think she is being <br/>
abused, in fact I think she might be a bit fiesty in her attitude <br/>
towards her husband, and I know she openly questions his logic, which <br/>
is hopeful.<br/>
<br/>
  Let me state, I knew he was strict and has some ridiculous rules, <br/>
but I NEVER dreamed he would take a swat at someone elses child. <br/>
Never..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861987606">I think I ask myself here how would your husband react if you came home and<br/>
told him that this next door neighbour had spanked you for being rowdy in<br/>
his home or vice versa. This would be considered assault right? So why is<br/>
it different for a child. Someone hit her outside her home so in my opinion<br/>
this should be taken as seriously as if this guy hit another adult.<br/>
How you handle it might depend on how you would handle it if it were an<br/>
adult. It could be in the form of a serious discussion or a call to the<br/>
police. A lot would depend on how you want the relationship to be in the<br/>
future.<br/>
<br/>
An additional thing to think about is how your daughter reacted to it. If<br/>
it was no big deal to her then perhaps the situation warrants a smaller<br/>
discussion with the guy but if she is truly upset then perhaps a little<br/>
stronger action might be in order.<br/>

would I do.  You know it is tough.  I was thinking I might call the police as <br/>
well.  Was thinking what would my child think if I didn&#39;t call the police.  I <br/>
mean hitting someone is against the law (for adults).  If I believe that it <br/>
is wrong to hit a child then the logical consequence is to call the police.  <br/>
Would my child feel that I was not defending him if I only talked to the <br/>
parent?  Would I be sending the message that I am not always there to defend <br/>
you?  Would I be sending the message that I feel it isn&#39;t a crime?  <br/>
<br/>
Not sure what I would do as I have never been in that situation but just some <br/>
questions I had in my own mind about the situation.  And please let us know <br/>
what happens.  Good learning opportunity for us all.  And what your child <br/>
thought about the whole thing.  <br/>

quietly, maybe the next time his kids have a friend he doesn&#39;t much love <br/>
he&#39;ll spank that one in hopes that her mom will remove her quietly, and so <br/>
forth.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe he has some dumbass idea that if a child is in his house he can <br/>
treat them however he wants, and he needs to hear SOON that that&#39;s just not <br/>
the case.<br/>
<br/>
-=-As for the wife being a &quot;doll&quot; that can be a problem.  She is weak and is <br/>
maybe receiving the<br/>
same treatment from him, even if it&#39;s verbal abuse.-=-<br/>
<br/>
A VERY good point.  And she truly might not know he spanked the visiting <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
It might help to find and give him a printed out copy of the local laws about <br/>
assault, battery, whatever applies.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-If this is all ok with her then I&#39;d<br/>
call the police.  Yes my son would be upset that he&#39;d lost a friend, but<br/>
I think he would be more upset if I did nothing to protect him from this<br/>
bully. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The parents are not the children, though.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly wanted to keep a friend, I would help her figure out how to deal <br/>
with maintaining that friendship while still feeling safe and comfortable <br/>
around the parents, OR help arrange that she&#39;s never with the parents when <br/>
other adults aren&#39;t also around.<br/>
<br/>
If my friends&#39; parents had forbidden them to hang out with me at all when I <br/>
was younger because my mom was a drunk, that would have been a harsh <br/>
punishment for me, who didn&#39;t even drink at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think if I didn&#39;t do that I would be also sending a<br/>
message that in order to have the friend that you want the price you<br/>
have to pay is being beaten.  I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s a lesson I want my son<br/>
to learn.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But you probably also don&#39;t want him to be learning that you never stay and <br/>
defend your rights, you just run away.  If the girl in the story still wants <br/>
to go to visit the other home, she could be coached and empowered to say, in <br/>
the case of a spanking-possibility, &quot;Don&#39;t touch me or I will call my mom and <br/>
she will call the police.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a useful speech for any kid to learn for such instances.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t break up a friendship without trying other measures to save it.<br/>

&lt;&lt; This goes without saying.  They will only play here from now on <br/>
(Well if they are still friends far into the future that may <br/>
change).  My dd. and I  talked and she is a bit sad to hear this, <br/>
because she understands she will most likey not be able to play as <br/>
often but she also agrees that the father can not be trusted.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Who cares if he can be &quot;trusted&quot; if he can be told in no uncertain terms <br/>
never to touch her again.<br/>
<br/>
To hell with &quot;trust,&quot; go with threat if you have to.<br/>
<br/>
But let your daughter live in the world instead of hiding like SHE did <br/>
something wrong.  She didn&#39;t.  And she will learn from the bad example of <br/>
that family just what kind of parent she does NOT want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Holly has a couple of families she visits where she comes back and says, <br/>
&quot;Mom, WHY are people so STUPID with their kids?&quot;  She&#39;s a good influence, <br/>
because they know she doesn&#39;t live with the threat of being spanked or <br/>
grounded.  So the parents see her behaving better than their own kids and <br/>
they MUST sometimes think that they might be wrong.   She&#39;s a beacon to <br/>
parental choices and thought.<br/>
<br/>
Across the street is/was (haven&#39;t seen her lately) a girl about seven years <br/>
old.  Holly&#39;s known her a couple of years.  She was being BADLY raised by her <br/>
young dad and his younger brother.  Where the mom ended up, I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
Alive, but elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Holly would play with her sometimes, usually at their house.  But three times <br/>
she just walked and came home because the uncle (who was really the more <br/>
attentive and better caregiver) was making her scared or nervous by being <br/>
irrational and lame.  Nothing dramatic, just nonsense.  Like they were using <br/>
our neighbor&#39;s pool, and the girl wanted her towel or something outside the <br/>
pool, and the uncle said &quot;Stay in the pool.&quot;  And she said, &quot;But I just <br/>
want...&quot;    &quot;STAY IN THE POOL,&quot; and Holly said he wasn&#39;t even looking at <br/>
them, just kind of staring away, thinking about something else.  So Holly got <br/>
out and got the thing and handed it to the little girl very nicely, and the <br/>
uncle seemed not even to notice.  <br/>
<br/>
This Thanksgiving he died.  I&#39;m kind of relieved.  He got sick and went to <br/>
the hospital and died.  Some flu or infection or whatnot.  It won&#39;t be better <br/>
for that little girl, probably, but better for Holly&#39;s peace in the <br/>
cul-de-sac, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Holly would have been hurt more by me saying &quot;NO, you can&#39;t go swim,&quot; or &quot;No, <br/>
you just have to tell that little girl you can&#39;t play.&quot;   She would have <br/>
learned less and felt restrained.  I never made her play there, certainly.  <br/>
But I didn&#39;t prevent her either.  She was, as usual, making informed <br/>
decisions with back-up plans, and not staying any longer than she wanted to.<br/>

anything.  If you left the man in charge of your child, which would be<br/>
assumed since you left her there with him, then he was acting &quot;in loco<br/>
parentis&quot;, standing in place of the parent.  He would likely by law have the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; to discipline your child in any legal manner.  Now if you had left<br/>
him with instructions that he was *not* to use spanking as a discipline<br/>
tool, then the police would have something to act on.  I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;m<br/>
actually wrong about this, but I don&#39;t think so.  I sure wouldn&#39;t leave her<br/>
there again, or maybe only if you knew that the mother rather than the<br/>
father was going to be there.<br/>

say &quot;Call my mom NOW!&quot; or call herself.  <br/>

<h4>coyote&#39;s corner</h4>
<time>26 Jan 2003, at  1:30pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1328055479">Hello,<br/>
I am new to the list. I&#39;ve not posted before. I home school my<br/>
granddaughter. We also operate a home business, www.coyotescorner.com<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.coyotescorner.com/">http://www.coyotescorner.com/</a>&gt;<br/>
&quot;Very Cool Stuff for the World&quot;. We work pow wows, festivals, and of course,<br/>
the e-catalog.<br/>
That&#39;s my introduction.<br/>
<br/>
When I was five years old. I was molested by Margie, my baby-sitter. My Mom<br/>
had brought Margie into our home to help her with the newborn and me. In<br/>
reality, my mom had brought Margie into our home to save her. Margie was<br/>
sleeping in my double bed with me. It was January, 1955<br/>
Margie&#39;s dad was EXACTLY like the man you describe. Right down to the food.<br/>
Margie&#39;s brother, Jimmy used to literally eat his bed. The headboard was<br/>
slowly being gnawed away. They were beaten. I remember visiting their mom<br/>
with my mom and watching their dad count out slices of bologna. I also<br/>
remember some of the punishments they received. One was &quot;the cross&quot;  They<br/>
had to stand with their arms straight out..for hours and hours. He would<br/>
beat them with a switch if their arms dropped.<br/>
That man assaulted your child. This is a punishable offense. He broke the<br/>
law. How exactly did he spank her? Did he put her over his knee? Did he<br/>
spank her through her clothes? What will he do next time? And there will be<br/>
a next time. He doesn&#39;t respect boundaries. He doesn&#39;t respect your<br/>
daughter. He doesn&#39;t respect you. Do you have a man? Do you think this jerk<br/>
respects your husband? No matter what you do, he will be in control. He will<br/>
hit her again.<br/>
I would call the police.<br/>
I would not have any contact with him.<br/>
You cannot help him.<br/>
Spanking is the tip of the ice burg.<br/>
You cannot change him.<br/>
He knows that he is right.<br/>
If you disagree, you are wrong.<br/>
This kind of behavior only gets worse.<br/>
Cuff him.<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Janis<br/>

  My daughter has a friend, whose father is the strict follow the<br/>
rules (that are always changing) or else you&#39;ll get it, kinda guy. My<br/>
daughter seems to really enjoy this little girls company so mostly<br/>
they play here.  But sometimes the father feels his daughter spends<br/>
to much time here and they should play at his home.  Today my<br/>
daughter played at their house.  When she came home she was quick to<br/>
tell me, the father spanked her and A.  &quot;WHAT?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  My daughter says, &quot;We were pretending to be zombies, with dry scaly<br/>
skin, and when we said AHHHH!  the little sister pretended to be<br/>
scared so she screamed.&quot;  At this point the father told them to &quot;Stop<br/>
scaring the little sister.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I asked my daughter if they were trying to scare the her.  She says<br/>
they were not and that she was laughing and playing with them.  Well<br/>
they continued to play and the little sister screamed again to which<br/>
the father said I told you to stop then spanked my daughter and her<br/>
friend and warned them if they did it again he was going to &quot;get the<br/>
belt&quot;.......<br/>
<br/>
  Breathe........breathe.....breathe.....(talking to myself here)..<br/>
<br/>
So there is no question that I will be speaking to this man. But it<br/>
could be more.<br/>
<br/>
  What I am looking for are your suggestions.  I see this as (maybe)<br/>
an opportunity to speak to this man about other options in<br/>
parenting. By the way, his wife is a doll and I really like her.<br/>
<br/>
  You see his child, of all my childrens friends, (I have four<br/>
children)is by far the worst behaved.  I know it is because of his<br/>
oppression.  The very issues he has the tightest rules on in his home<br/>
are the very same things she takes advantage of in my home.<br/>
<br/>
  An example is food.  Food is tightly regulated in their home,<br/>
where they eat, how much, and not a bit is to be wasted EVER.  So in<br/>
my home she is always wasting food, by that I mean taking way more<br/>
then she can eat then throwing it away.  Manners are strictly<br/>
enforced in her home, when she is here you would hardly know she had<br/>
any.  These are small examples (there are more) but proof that the<br/>
father is creating the exact opposite of what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Do you think it is possible for me to help this family and in doing<br/>
so help my daughters friend?  Or should I just deal with the spanking<br/>
issue and continue to set an example of how life can be different and<br/>
joyful with children. I know he sees the joy my family has.<br/>
<br/>
oh, my dd Elaine is 7 almost 8.<br/>

*       I was thinking about that.  Wondering if I were in the same<br/>
situation what<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; would I do.  You know it is tough.  I was thinking I might call the police<br/>
 </span></blockquote>as<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; well.  Was thinking what would my child think if I didn&#39;t call the police.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>police.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would my child feel that I was not defending him if I only talked to the<br/>

 </span></blockquote>defend<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you?  Would I be sending the message that I feel it isn&#39;t a crime?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d be inclined to do the same, but I really doubt that the police would do<br/>
anything.  If you left the man in charge of your child, which would be<br/>
assumed since you left her there with him, then he was acting &quot;in loco<br/>
parentis&quot;, standing in place of the parent<br/>
<br/>
THIS IS NOT TRUE:.<br/>
*      He would likely by law have the<br/>
&quot;right&quot; to discipline your child in any legal manner. No one has that right.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Now if you had left<br/>
him with instructions that he was *not* to use spanking as a discipline<br/>
tool, then the police would have something to act on.  I&#39;m hoping that I&#39;m<br/>
actually wrong about this, but I don&#39;t think so.  I sure wouldn&#39;t leave her<br/>
there again, or maybe only if you knew that the mother rather than the<br/>
father was going to be there.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not sure.....I think my first reaction would be to call the police (after I <br/>
made sure we didn&#39;t need to go to the hospital) and not think about it too <br/>
much.  It is a crime I would not want to be repeated.  I can&#39;t imagine my <br/>
husband not thinking it was a crime.  If someone hit him I am thinking I <br/>
would probably not take that amount of time.  To actually sit down and ask <br/>
what he thinks and what he wants.  I am just trying to picture it happening.  <br/>
I think I would immediatly call the police.  <br/>
<br/>
And I agree that it would have been good if the child could have said <br/>
&quot;No...call my mom right now.&quot;  Although I know you had no idea that this <br/>
would happen and no preparation.  But I have thought about this.  Not with <br/>
friends because my boys don&#39;t go to anyones house to play if I am not there.  <br/>
I think that is just the age and most of their friends are in public school.  <br/>
But I have thought about what if my FIL ever tried to spank my children and I <br/>
have told my DH to have a talk with his dad before he comes to visit.  I <br/>
could see him trying to spank my boys, that is just his thinking....you don&#39;t <br/>
finish a meal you get spanked etc... Have tried to think about how to avoid <br/>
it and what I would do if it happened.  Like I said I have no good answers <br/>
only more questions.<br/>
