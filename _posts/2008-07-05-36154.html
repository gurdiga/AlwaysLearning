<br/>
I just saw a Subway sandwich commercial with kids talking about all the <br/>
choices they don&#39;t get to make in life: &quot;when I wake up, what I wear, <br/>
what to read, and of course when I go to bed. But at Subway, I have the <br/>
power to choose and I eat it up.&quot; Smart of Subway to try to sell <br/>
empowerment and choice to kids, it&#39;s clearly valuable but limited for <br/>
most of them. Sad sandwich toppings are expected to pacify them.<br/>

If that&#39;s all the choice a kid were to have, it would still be some  <br/>
freedom!<br/>
I remember road trips as a kid when we&#39;d stop at a burger joint, but  <br/>
my dad would order six hamburgers and six chocolate shakes and nobody  <br/>
had any choice.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE hamburgers and chocolate shakes, but still it robbed of us  <br/>
autonomy and power.  It bought him ten minutes on the road, I guess.   <br/>
And it was way better than homemade sandwiches in the car.<br/>
<br/>
My kids&#39; lives are So far from that it&#39;s hard to imagine how it must  <br/>
feel (compared to me as a younger kid).<br/>
