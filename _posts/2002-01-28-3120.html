You are defining something as &quot;not homeschooling&quot; because of the reality of <br/>
the way it works - saying it isn&#39;t homeschooling because it involves being at <br/>
the center and doing what the teachers say the way they say to do it and so <br/>
on and doesn&#39;t allow the freedom to do things their own way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any problem with saying that isn&#39;t homeschooling. I&#39;d have no <br/>
problem saying, &quot;I don&#39;t think people enrolled in &#39;The Learning Center&#39; are <br/>
really homeschooling. They&#39;re really more in school than out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m saying that just being signed up for a public school program doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
that that is the way it will be. There are many different kinds of public <br/>
school programs and that includes the AEPs in Washingington. Some are MUCH <br/>
looser than many private cover schools. There are public school programs that <br/>
encourage unschooling - I once went to an excellent workshop that ENCOURAGED <br/>
unschooling at our county&#39;s public school program. There are public school <br/>
programs where people only see somebody from that program once a year or <br/>
twice a year or every three months or even never at all. There are public <br/>
school programs where they have drop-in centers that offer workshops and the <br/>
people can use them or not, as they wish. There are a b&#39;zillion different <br/>
kinds of programs.<br/>
<br/>
So - if you want to look at what one family is doing or what one particular <br/>
program requires, and say &quot;That isn&#39;t really homeschooling,&quot; based on what <br/>
they are REALLY doing -- fine. But these people in Washington are insisting <br/>
that it is &quot;in black and white&quot; and we should all just accept what the law <br/>
says. They aren&#39;t looking at what people are really doing, individually. They <br/>
aren&#39;t interested in the difference between different programs. They are just <br/>
saying that their LAW distinguishes between families in AEPs versus &quot;real&quot; <br/>
homeschoolers and they want to keep that distinction and they get extremely <br/>
heated up over it when people aren&#39;t willing to maintain that distinction. <br/>
There are people in that state who have really been hurt and driven away from <br/>
the rest of the homeschooling community by this extremely rigid thinking <br/>
which is repeated over and over. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in a public school program and I was just as much a homeschooler <br/>
then as I am now. We started unschooling while in a public school program, <br/>
after experimenting with doing unit studies for a while. We saw the program <br/>
staff person ONCE, when we signed up. They didn&#39;t tell us what to do, they <br/>
offered materials and workshops and some field trips and a park day, that we <br/>
could use IF we wanted to use them. We have board members of the National <br/>
Home Education Network who are in public school programs and they are not <br/>
only homeschooling, they are unschoolers. Shall we kick them off the board, <br/>
telling them they aren&#39;t &quot;real homeschoolers&quot; because they&#39;re enrolled in a <br/>
public school program?<br/>
<br/>
Nichoel, I&#39;ve been involved in this discussion for the past 6 years and I&#39;ve <br/>
read all the statutes. In fact, by quoting all the statutes, you&#39;re just <br/>
emphasizing my point that you want to let the law define who is a <br/>
homeschooler.  WHY would we homeschoolers want to let the government define <br/>
who is and who isn&#39;t a homeschooler? Some of the most prominent homeschoolers <br/>
in the State of Washington are underground and would not be called <br/>
homeschoolers according to your own statutes, in fact they&#39;d technically be <br/>
called &quot;criminals&quot; since they are breaking the law. Do you insist that they <br/>
not call themselves homeschoolers since they aren&#39;t, legally, operating under <br/>
the actual homeschooling statutes?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t object to looking at the programs and talking about the problems with <br/>
them and the problems that could be created in the homeschooling community by <br/>
them and so on. I don&#39;t object to looking at a particular program and saying, <br/>
&quot;It doesn&#39;t look like homeschooling to me when they have to be there and have <br/>
to work on somebody else&#39;s schedule and have to do what somebody else <br/>
requires,&quot; and so on. That&#39;s based on reality, not on what the LAW defines. <br/>
<br/>
I very very strongly object to the argument that the LAW defines some people <br/>
as homeschoolers and other people as not homeschoolers and that we should all <br/>
support that definition. It flies in the face of reality and requires us to <br/>
deny our own observations. There are radical unschoolers who are enrolled in <br/>
public school programs - and there are people in Washington State telling <br/>
THEM that they don&#39;t have the right to call themselves real homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I find it disheartening that there are homeschoolers who so adamantly <br/>
continue to argue that we should all call ourselves exactly what the <br/>
government says we should call ourselves without giving any consideration to <br/>
what people are REALLY doing. WHY should we let the law define who is and who <br/>
isn&#39;t a real homeschooler? I&#39;m discouraged that people don&#39;t think about the <br/>
further ramifications of that kind of thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve already repeated myself on this too much on this already and I&#39;m <br/>
sure it is getting tedious and I promise I will resist doing it again if I <br/>
have nothing new to say &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

And I do see your point, honestly I understand why on a case by case basis it is important to look at what the family does, however when it comes down to protecting the homeschooling laws as they sit now I&#39;m on the other side of the fence from you on this issue it seems. I thank you for the conversation and the debate however, it really has brought up some interesting points that I will need to ponder my position on =)!<br/>
