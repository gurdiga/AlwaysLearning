I just came across homeschoolopoly(not made by the same co. as Monopoly,<br/>
btw) and all I have to say is YUCK!  (There is a HSLDA card to get out of<br/>
court free) Maybe we should put our heads together and make an<br/>
unschoolopoly.  :-)  (might be pretty hard with all the various things that<br/>
unschoolers love)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking about Monopoly because we just ran across a new one,<br/>
Rodeo-opoly, which sounded cool.  We play Horse-opoly and Whoville-opoly for<br/>
hours on end sometimes.  <br/>

Maybe for an unschooling game you could combine the horses and  <br/>
whoville and whatever else, so you can go from one board to another!   <br/>
A bigger town.   Ha!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-439967388">I only remember playing this game at a friend&#39;s when I was a kid and I<br/>
don&#39;t think we finished.  We never had the game in our own house when<br/>
I was growing up and I don&#39;t have it now.<br/>
<br/>
My 9.5 yo DD just recently played The Game of Life at her friend&#39;s<br/>
house (on a sleepover).  When she came home and told me about playing,<br/>
she said that she had a baby girl, that she made 80 thousand dollars,<br/>
her friend made $20K, and the other girl playing made $40K.  And that<br/>
her friend, the one who made 20K, won the game because she became a<br/>
grandparent LAST. Huh? I kept wondering if this was my friend&#39;s spin<br/>
on the game... she never planned on having kids.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, now I want to get the game just to see.<br/>

<br/>
We have the game of Life and there isn�t anything in our version that has<br/>
anything about grandparents in it at all.  The person with the most money at<br/>
the end of the game wins.  That includes your cash and these little cards<br/>
that you get when you do something good that have a money value on them.<br/>
Usually, but not always, the person with the highest salary wins.  But<br/>
salaries can change during the game if you land on the right square.  Oh,<br/>
and I think there is one other way to win (at least in the old version, I<br/>
get them mixed up�I have the new one and the one from when I was a kid)<br/>
where if you don�t think you could possibly have the most money, you can put<br/>
your money and car on a number on the number strip and spin the spinner and<br/>
if your number comes up you automatically win.  (pretty sure that�s the old<br/>
version though)<br/>
