<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162914987">Introducing a new email discussion list, &quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:NoSpanking@yahoogroups.com">NoSpanking@yahoogroups.com</a>.&quot; <br/>
The list is owned and moderated by Pam Sorooshian, homeschooling mom of <br/>
three children, ages 18, 15, and 12.<br/>
<br/>
List description:<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the NoSpanking list is support for parents who wish to <br/>
discover and utilize alternatives to spanking their children. This list <br/>
is not for debating, but is for providing help, information, ideas, and <br/>
encouragement for those who prefer not to use corporal punishment on <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
The official policy of this list is that punishment of children is not <br/>
necessary and that alternative nonpunitive ways of relating to children <br/>
are preferred.<br/>
<br/>
  Questions and suggestions and support are welcome from parents, no <br/>
matter what their parenting philosophies or practices, but this is not <br/>
the place for argumentative posts in favor spanking.<br/>
<br/>
