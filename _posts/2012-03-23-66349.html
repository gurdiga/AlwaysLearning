<br/>
Eight weeks from now, in Massachusetts:<br/>

You can register directly if you&#39;re not needing a bunk.  There are bunkbeds. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Even if you&#39;re not able to go, it might be worth reading there because there will be others.  Some are listed on the righthand column of the main Albuquerque symposium page:<br/>

Albuquerque, Minnesota, Lisbon, Australia (because Schuyler is moving there, and Joyce and I are going to go there and have some little ALL Unschooling events with her!), and I&#39;m speaking at twice that many places at other people&#39;s gatherings.  Big busy year and a half coming up.  Many of those have pages you can subscribe to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to get to meet Meredith in Massachusetts.  In Minnesota next spring, I get to meet Alex Polikowsky.  <br/>
<br/>
It helps to see other families in operation.  It helps to see people speak whose voices have been only words on the screen.  It helps to hear the tone of voice, and see the eyes.  <br/>
<br/>
As to the expense, consider this:  If you were required to take a course to be certified as a homeschooling parent, you probably would&#39;ve done that.  It would cost money, and time, and you&#39;d have to have gotten a babysitter.  But you didn&#39;t have to do that!! And people have been offering unschooling help freely.  If you want to experience some of this in person, it will cost a little bit of money, some time and some transportation, but you will also learn things you can&#39;t learn sitting at the computer, and might make some lifelong friends.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it. :-)<br/>
The other, longer list of my own speaking engagements is here:<br/>

There are other people and places, in person, too.<br/>
