* For Christmas, Holly got copies on DVD of &quot;A Hard Day&#39;s Night&quot; and<br/>
&quot;Help.&quot; The day &quot;Across the Universe&quot; was released on DVD she bought<br/>
a copy with her own babysitting-earned money. This week she watched<br/>
&quot;The Rutles: All you need is cash,&quot; a mockumentary of a group just<br/>
like The Beatles (involving people from Monty Python and old Saturday<br/>
Night Live, and George Harrison was in it too, and Mick Jagger).<br/>
She understood TONS of references--social, visual, musical,<br/>
cultural. I explained a few things, like the death of Brian Epstein,<br/>
and Yoko Ono&#39;s art, because without those things there were parts of<br/>
the Rutles story that were mystifying to her. Now she wants to see<br/>
Yellow Submarine (which she hasn&#39;t seen for years) and Magical<br/>
Mystery Tour. I&#39;ll either rent or buy those for her.*<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh my!  I just recently saw that Rutles mockumentary at the library.  I&#39;ll<br/>
have to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re *lurving *&quot;Across the Universe&quot; here...the imagery is amazing.  I had<br/>
forgotten how much I love the song &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra (well, any-and-everyone who&#39;s interested in the Beatles), a doc<br/>
called *Imagine:  The Beatles in LOVE *is airing on the Sundance<br/>
Channel this Friday at 12:30 pm (Eastern).  It&#39;s the story of Cirque du<br/>
Soleil&#39;s &quot;Love&quot; show, which is a visual interpretation of Beatles songs.<br/>
<br/>
I only caught the tail end the other day, and it was beautifully done...I&#39;ll<br/>
be recording it Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Thought some of you would be interested...<br/>
