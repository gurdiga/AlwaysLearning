So glad I am able to e-mail you.  I&#39;m a mother of 4 - mostly unschooled all <br/>
of them, but not without alot of anguish of whether or not they are &quot;missing <br/>
something&quot;.  I am also a trained Montessori 3-6 directress.  Right now, I have a <br/>
soon to be 16 yr. old boy who hates absolutely anything to do with paper and <br/>
pencil.  He e-mails his girlfriend.  That is it.    Do I need to be concerned? <br/>
 He wants to go to college to be a Conservation Officer, but I also believe <br/>
he has a negative belief in himself about doing homework from the days/years of <br/>
me wigging out.  Thanks for any encouragement/ideas you can give me.  -=-<br/>

My response (and I&#39;ve invited her to join this list):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My oldest just went to his first college classes.  His handwriting is tiny <br/>
little printing.  He will get better from doing it.  This is the first time he&#39;s <br/>
really needed to.  I figure it will be that way with your son, too.<br/>
