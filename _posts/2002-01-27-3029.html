<div id="ygrps-yiv-116942801">Just wanted to say hello to everyone before I slip into obscurity.  <br/>
My name is Thomas Kuykendall, husband to Nanci K.  I am trying to <br/>
keep up on the home schooling subject and have done a pretty poor job <br/>
of it to date.  Most of my knowledge is from my lovely wife and I <br/>
really do try my best to educate my children, especially when they <br/>
ask those all important question starting with, &quot;Daddy, why is...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Due to my limited time to read email (usually done on breaks at work) <br/>
and even more limited time to answer any, I will pretty much be a <br/>
lurker.  No, I don&#39;t have long hair (yuck, too much effort to take <br/>
care of) or a beard, I sure hope that doesn&#39;t mean I will have to <br/>
leave.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeh, if I do reply and my message makes absolutely no sense, Nanci <br/>
will definitely be discussing it with me and follow up with a much <br/>
better explanation of what I really ment to say.  What can I say.  I <br/>
am in Engineer and english was a second language for me.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
ps.<br/>
<br/>
For those woundering, I am the 4th Thomas in 5 consecutive <br/>
generations of Thomas&#39;.  I have gone with the BORG theme and go by <br/>
the T4of5 designation.  Remember, RESISTANCE IS FUTILE.</div>

 </span></blockquote>In true unschooling fashion. :o) Learning comes in all shapes and sizes and <br/>
from many different sources, not just reading. It all counts. From what I&#39;ve <br/>
seen, your lovely wife is a pretty knowledgable source.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Thomas. Glad you&#39;re here.<br/>
