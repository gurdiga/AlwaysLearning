I&#39;m planning to send each college/university (admissions office) in the state <br/>
an invitation to attend our Unschooling conference next October. <br/>

<br/>
Hi, Kelly,<br/>
Could you tell me more about this conference? Where is it? Who sponsors it? How are speakers arranged? I&#39;d love to mark it on my calendar...<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the opportunity to plug it once again! I thought everyone knew <br/>
about it by now!<br/>
<br/>
Columbus Day weekend (October11-13, 2002) in Columbia, South Carolina at the <br/>
Holiday Inn Coliseum. Sponsored by Palmetto State School&#39;s Out Support (SOS) <br/>
(an unschooling support group).<br/>
<br/>
Our speakers include Lisa Bugg, Anne Ohman, Joyce Fetteroll, Ned & Luz Vare, <br/>
Fiona Hutchison, and ...Sandra Dodd (among others that I&#39;m working <br/>
on---$$$!). It will be for the whole family with workshops and activities for <br/>
everyone. I&#39;m at the hotel this afternoon to finalize some things. I&#39;m <br/>
meeting with &quot;Spiderwoman&quot; next Wednesday, so we&#39;re hoping to have the <br/>
website up and running as soon as possible. I&#39;ll keep everyone posted!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re interested, please send me your snail mail address and I&#39;ll put you <br/>
on the mailing list. There are carpools/caravans being set up all over the <br/>
south and northeast! It should be a GREAT weekend! I hope you can join us!<br/>

Everyone on the list has access to all the archives, at yahoogroups.com.  If <br/>
you&#39;ve never been to the site they ask you to register and pick a password.  <br/>
Then you can go to AlwaysLearning where you can read every message ever <br/>
posted, see who else is on the list, read the intro, change your settings <br/>
(from individual e-mails to digests or even to just read online so that you <br/>
get no e-mail but always go to the site).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171277622">I know this,  Sandra,  but for some reason,  I have been unable to access<br/>
the archives....Yahoo seems to disagree on what my password really is.  ???<br/>
Maybe one day soon I&#39;ll have a few child-free moments to really concentrate<br/>
and figure out the snag.  Or maybe I should have one of the young &#39;uns<br/>
figure it out for me...may be faster!<br/>
