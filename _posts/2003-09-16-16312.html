<div id="ygrps-yiv-71917520">So often when I try to explain new ideas to people I end up feeling like an idiot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading homeschooling and unschooling books & magazines for about six years now.  I don&#39;t usually say much about this reading to people unless I know they are also interested in homeschooling or alternative education.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do have some people in my life that I would like to share these ideas with.  These ideas are so totally changing my life that I want to share them with people who are part of my life.  One of them is my husband.  Others are close friends who either send their kids to public school or whose children are grown.  These people are not doing the reading I&#39;m doing.  When I share the things I&#39;m reading about, they respond in such mainstream ways, yet I can&#39;t seem to come up with the words to back up these *new* ideas.  (Not new ideas to most of you on this list, I&#39;m sure!)  It is so frustrating!<br/>
<br/>
For instance, a recent dinner conversation evolved to schools and standardized testing.  I suggested that children would benefit more by putting money into smaller class sizes instead of into testing.  *D* insisted that testing is the only way we can know if smaller class sizes or other changes in the system are working.  I couldn&#39;t think of anything to say to that.<br/>
<br/>
Should I just not bother talking to people unless I know they are also questioning the status quo?  I hate to think that I can only have meaningful conversations with people who already think as I do.<br/>

Testing doesn&#39;t prove anything other than how good a kid is at taking tests<br/>
and how they&#39;re feeling that day.<br/>

As far as that goes, it&#39;s true.   Schools involve money and &quot;accountability,&quot; <br/>
and so they have to show something &quot;quantifiable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s how it works.<br/>

jumped to the top of my tottering nightstand pile.  It&#39;s called &quot;What<br/>

Susan Ohanian.  We who are not daily in the public school trenches have no<br/>
idea what &quot;standardized testing&quot; really means.  Your dh needs to read it.<br/>
America is being fed a load of crap, and our public schooled kids are<br/>
suffering on the altar of &quot;global economies.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Smaller Classes = Less Reliance on Testing & the testing being looked at more as one available tool instead of the most important tool<br/>
<br/>
The teachers have more time to get to know the students in a smaller class and what they are capable of vs. what they are producing.  However, that is only true with good teachers.  Not all teachers, even those with a small class size (15 or less / class), will take the time to get to know their students individually.   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>They are right. The tests are necessary in that context.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t good enough to know that one on one or smaller class sizes or<br/>
unschooling works &quot;better&quot;. Because better in those cases means realizing<br/>
the goal of school is not as good as the goal that those can provide.<br/>
<br/>
When an institution is being trusted to get kids from point A to point B<br/>
then they need a way of proving to those that are trusting them that it is<br/>
happening.<br/>
<br/>
People invested in schools have a different goal than people who are<br/>
unschooling. For their goal -- getting a child from the state they&#39;re in to<br/>
a point where they can &quot;be anything they want&quot; -- testing is appropriate.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s why you&#39;re having problems presenting your viewpoint. They&#39;re on<br/>
one path and you&#39;re on another. And you&#39;re trying to tell them the<br/>
techniques they&#39;re using to navigate their path are wrong but that isn&#39;t<br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
So you need to find a way to help them question whether the path they&#39;re on<br/>
is the best one or not.<br/>

<br/>
Authentic assessment methods are more like what unschooling parents do <br/>
naturally - we hang out with our kids, talk to them, and often aren&#39;t <br/>
even conscious of our &quot;assessments&quot; because we don&#39;t think of them that <br/>
way - we think of them as just thinking about our child - mostly we&#39;re <br/>
just fascinated by what our child knows and can do, etc.<br/>
<br/>
But still - authentic assessment in a classroom is &quot;sort of&quot; like that. <br/>
The teacher observes kids doing stuff or just in conversation about <br/>
something (not with the intent to &quot;grade&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
So - if you want to talk about testing - and why we don&#39;t need to do it <br/>
and schools do - you might want to google &quot;authentic assessment&quot; so you <br/>
understand it a little and then you can just say, &quot;Oh, yes, we use <br/>
authentic assessment, just like the more progressive schools.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also - if you go to the Fair Test website -- you can read about why <br/>
standardized testing is NOT a good idea even in schools.<br/>

<br/>
Well, there&#39;s two ways I look at it...YES, I protect my sanity by being choosy about with whom I will enter into a debate/discussion. On the other hand, if you only talk to people that agree, how does one hone their beliefs and learn to think them through from other points of view? Having conversations with doubers has truly helped me define my philosophies. But I don&#39;t enter into convo&#39;s with those that just want to prove me wrong, I enter in when a person truly wants to discuss.<br/>
Those that automatically dismiss everything you say are not worthy of your time.<br/>

<br/>
We had an interesting day on Monday.  My 6yo daughter told us this<br/>
weekend that she wanted to go to 1st grade.  My husband and I talked<br/>
about it and decided that it would be best if we asked a friend of ours<br/>
who teaches if we could sit in her classroom for the day, that way we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be enrolling and then possibly dropping out the next day.<br/>
<br/>
She said no problem (she has always been supportive of our<br/>
unschooling).  So Monday bright and early we got up, got dressed, ate<br/>
breakfast, made lunches and headed out.  There were three of us - me,<br/>
Robin (son-8 1/2) and Storey (daughter-6).<br/>
<br/>
Natalie (my friend, the teacher) had written two sentences that needed<br/>
correcting on the board.  Neither of my children can read yet, but I<br/>
read the board to them and they told me what was wrong with the<br/>
sentences and wrote them correctly on a sheet of paper.  Then we<br/>
listened to a story and participated in answering questions about the<br/>
story (my son asked me why Natalie was asking these questions - did she<br/>
think we hadn&#39;t been listening?)<br/>
<br/>
Already my kids were getting out of their chairs and starting to wander<br/>
around, which  of course was being noticed by the other kids in the room<br/>
and they were starting to pop out of their seats too.  Recess was still<br/>
pretty far away but somehow we managed to get there without me having to<br/>
remind them to sit and be still.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch the kids had to take the second part of a standardized test<br/>
(that&#39;s where the quote above comes in).  They were being timed.  It was<br/>
subtraction, 50 questions, and it said at the top that the test should<br/>
be completed in 5 minutes or less.  Natalie sat and did the key - it<br/>
took her 5 minutes to do that!!  Needless to say, the quickest time was<br/>
6.5 minutes and the longest was 33 minutes.  Silly testing.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the best part:<br/>
<br/>
My kids took the test too, just for fun.  Storey did about half of them<br/>
and then asked if she had to finish it.  I told her only if she wanted<br/>
to.  She said it was just the same thing over and over and didn&#39;t they<br/>
already know that she knew it?  Why did she have to keep answering the<br/>
same thing?<br/>
<br/>
Robin looked at the first problem (7-3=?) and found a different 7 on the<br/>
page, circled it then found a different 3, circled it and drew a line to<br/>
the 7, then found a four and drew a line to it.  He did this for about<br/>
10 problems.  Natalie was sitting at the table next to him watching,<br/>
fascinated.  She told him that she had never seen anyone do it that way<br/>
and was very impressed.  (She was too, she called me later and we talked<br/>
about the kids creativity.)<br/>
<br/>
So, long story later,  I got to watch my lifelong unschoolers take a<br/>
standardized test in a 2nd grade classroom.  I got to see how children<br/>
who have never had to do math problems or workbooks or anything like<br/>
that, do well on a California Standardized test.  I am so blown away<br/>
that this unschooling actually works SO much better than regular<br/>
schooling.<br/>
<br/>
I told my mom about this.  Her response?  To tell me that she was<br/>
apprehensive at first (that&#39;s an understatement) but now that the kids<br/>
are older and she&#39;s around them more and of course this new story about<br/>
the testing.  She now thinks I may be right with this unschooling thing.<br/>
<br/>
Ok.  I&#39;m done.  Was any of this understandable?  I&#39;m not a writer, I&#39;m<br/>
sure that&#39;s clear.  But it was such an amazing adventure I felt<br/>
compelled to share it.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, neither of the kids want to go to school, there is a greater<br/>
appreciation for our way now.<br/>
