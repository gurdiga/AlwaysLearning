<div id="ygrps-yiv-554408571">Since we&#39;re in a peppet phase at our house ...and since Sandra mentioned<br/>
Holly playing with marionettes....<br/>
<br/>
Abby got several puppets as presents at her party -  one being a simple<br/>
marionette.  ANyway,  I was telling Katy (10yo dd) about Holly trying to<br/>
make marionettes (though I was skimming the list then...I may get confused<br/>
on some details :-) )<br/>
    Anyhow,  we came up with the idea of using those yarn dolls (you wrap<br/>
yarn around a book and it makes a doll.  I have no idea how to do this,  but<br/>
Katy is an expert!) and making them into marionettes with popsicle sticks<br/>
and thread or fishing line.  The yarn dolls are floppy enough AND you can<br/>
design some simple dress up outfits for them.<br/>

Good idea!  They&#39;ll need weighted feet.  Doll shoes with playdough in would <br/>
do it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One book showed a neat marionette made with a head (whatever kind of little <br/>
doll head or homemade head) fastened to the corner of a scarf, and two <br/>
corners of the scarf make the hands, and the fourth corner just hangs down.  <br/>
Looked kind of ghostly, but worked well.<br/>
