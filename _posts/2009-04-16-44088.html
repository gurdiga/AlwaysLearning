<div id="ygrps-yiv-1886962049">This is a comment for Sandra.  I don&#39;t ever post on groups, liking to maintain my quiet life out of the limelight :) But I have been reading through some of Sandra&#39;s webpage and I think it may have been on Sandra&#39;s blog, where I read that she had thought to pay a flower shop to apprentice a child (I hope I am getting the scenario right -- I have read through quite a lot and it might be I am losing details) so that they could gain skills in a particular area.  Anyway, I just wanted to say I thought that idea brilliant.  But really it&#39;s no different than paying a college or university.  It had just never occurred to me that you could do something like that and I doubt I would have ever thought to ask.  I don&#39;t know why, but when I read that bit I just went, wow, yes, of course that is how you would learn something like that, just offer to pay to apprentice.  Anyway, for some reason that idea just made sense to me in a really big way.  Wanted to say thanks for that bit.<br/>

I hugely disagree. I think mentorships are a whole different ball game on MANY levels. First of all, they cost less. Secondly, you are finding someone passionately pursuing the topic, not just teaching about it. You tend to get people who are sharing their interest in a natural way, not trying to cram information into a bunch of students heads. You also have SO much less hassle (colleges have entry tests and requirements and all sorts of bureaucratic bullshit to deal with), no tests or grades or.....<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on about the differences between mentorship and college courses, but there are so many.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1133812366">In the case of Holly and the flower shop, though we were willing to  <br/>
pay them money, the deal is she works on Monday afternoon for pay, and  <br/>
other times during the week, when they need help (if she&#39;s not working  <br/>
at Zumiez) without pay.   They&#39;re talking about making a MySpace  <br/>
page.  THAT is certainly something Holly can do without much effort.   <br/>
If they do task her with making a MySpace page, for work, for money,  <br/>
then I can point to three years or so of Holly&#39;s unwitting preparation  <br/>
for a future job. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One difference between the flower shop and paying for a class is that  <br/>
this is open-ended, it&#39;s real.  The first day she was there she made a  <br/>
little arrangement and a few days later she was in the shop when  <br/>
someone bought it!!<br/>
<br/>
The shop (it&#39;s actually two shops; one on the air base, and she&#39;s been  <br/>
to that one one day)... the owner paid for Holly to attend an all day  <br/>
Teleflora workshop, with the other employees.  That was pretty cool!<br/>
<br/>
Holly could quit any time without &quot;failing.&quot;  If she&#39;s done at the end  <br/>
of the spring season, she fulfilled the original deal.  If they like  <br/>
her and she wants to stay, cool!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s both less artificial and lower pressure.   It&#39;s real AND casual  <br/>
(compared to college or a formal course).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love this.  The idea that you could find work FIRST, before you have all the skills, and use the job to try out and gain the skills, for whatever reason is a bit of a revelation to me.  It feels like it opens up quite a lot of possibilities in my mind that hadn&#39;t been there before.  It&#39;s very cool to me that people are happily going about their business doing things that seem obvious and make sense to them, that never even occurred to me.  I thank you for that.<br/>

<br/>
My other kids had learned lots from their jobs--all sorts of things.    <br/>
So I was sure Holly would learn wherever she was, and if she couldn&#39;t  <br/>
work at a flower shop without flower shop experience...  that was the  <br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
Because Holly works at a cool store and sees the competition all  <br/>
around them at the mall for selling artsy sports shoes and tshirts by  <br/>
famous artists (famous tshirt artists &lt;g&gt;), after she hung around the  <br/>
flower shop a few weeks she told me the owner was marketing it 90&#39;s  <br/>
style, and there were a few simple things she could do to update and  <br/>
upgrade.<br/>
<br/>
Well!  Maybe Holly&#39;s learning management and advertising. &lt;g&gt;  What  <br/>
she&#39;s doing is what she&#39;s always done, though--being observant, asking  <br/>
questions, doing what she can to make things work better in the  <br/>
moments that she&#39;s there working.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-743223065">Oddly enough, apprenticeships are a big buzzword in the UK at present and  <br/>
the government is throwing lots of money at them.  They&#39;re  viewed as a way <br/>
of engaging those designated  in policy-speak as &quot;NEETS&quot; (young people Not <br/>
in Education, Employment  or Training).  Of course, this set-up probably <br/>
falls  way short of the apprenticeships set up by the efforts and initiative of  <br/>
unschoolers, as I&#39;m sure there&#39;ll be an element of compulsion to these  <br/>
apprenticeships along the lines of &quot;Do this or we&#39;ll cut your welfare  <br/>
benefits&quot;.  <br/>
 <br/>
But I&#39;ve seen a couple of the Creative Apprenticeships in  action.  These <br/>
particular instances were driven by the interest of the  participants.  And <br/>
they did provide a practical route  into artistic employment/freelancing for <br/>
young people who passionately  wanted to be practicing artists and might <br/>
otherwise spend 3 or more years  at college doing a lot of theory.  One example <br/>
is a young songwriter  who was part of the pilot scheme at a local music  <br/>
venue.  She was given lots of opportunities to facilitate  vocal workshops, <br/>
to run her own business and to hone her performance  skills.  She&#39;s now <br/>
massively in demand and has neither had to sit any exams  nor compromise any part <br/>
of her creative vision.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess it&#39;s a glimmer of hope that, somewhere in a tiny corner  of the <br/>
powers-that-be, there&#39;s some recognition that school is not  everything.  <br/>

It&#39;s interesting too, because floral shops are always looking for<br/>
people, but they always want qualified, experienced people that they<br/>
don&#39;t pay lots of money to.  I see ads for floral shops repeatedly for<br/>
months before flower seasons.  What Sandra did, was take the risk away<br/>
from the shop owners, to hire someone without experience.  It&#39;s cool,<br/>
and I&#39;d be willing to bet that there are other jobs like this, that need<br/>
experience, but want it inexpensively, without risk.</div>

<br/>
I doubt it was the idea of the schools, though.<br/>
<br/>
Apprenticeship is the old-time way.  Medieval.   The bad thing about  <br/>
it then was that in some cases, it seems, people&#39;s parents paid big  <br/>
bucks and signed a contract that the kid would stay there for two  <br/>
years (or whatever), and the child went to live at the home of the  <br/>
craftsmaster (or whatever it was) and did grunt work for free for two  <br/>
years.   Sometimes kids were put into apprenticeships against their  <br/>
will.   Worse than being sent to college.  At least at college there  <br/>
are other people to  hang out with.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s an interesting topic, but I don&#39;t doubt that if it were to become  <br/>
institutionalized again, there would be parents pressing their kids  <br/>
into apprenticeships they didn&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the situation with Holly, &quot;the powers that be&quot; were  <br/>
just my imagination and initiative, Holly&#39;s strong interest, and the  <br/>
curious willingness of the shop owner.   Nobody &quot;had to&quot; do anything,  <br/>
and that makes the whole thing pleasant and happy.<br/>

I remember reading about Benjamin Franklin and how apprenticeships were done during those days.  I think the parents, in probably most cases, felt they knew which would be the best field for their children to apprentice in and they made arrangements a bit like arranged marriages.  It wasn&#39;t necessarily a case of children&#39;s interests being considered.  I like that in your case, Sandra, you and your child were on the look-out for something that the child might enjoy, and I&#39;m sure she would have been able to say, &quot;well, thanks, mom, but I&#39;m not sure flowers are really my thing&quot; or whatever and that would be it.  Not so in early times apprenticeships, I don&#39;t think :) What I really like was that this scenario offered something for all parties involved -- a win-win situation, if you will.  The store is being offered cash, taking any perceived risk out of it for them; and because of that, if your child didn&#39;t care for this line of work after a bit, she also wouldn&#39;t have to feel that she &quot;owed&quot; the store anything, nor would you.  I think this particular set-up, where it is a loose agreement between just a couple of people, is rather optimal.  It occurs to me after hearing about it, that there may be any number of businesses and trades that might consider something like this, if someone approached them casually.  Not everyone perceives themselves as a mentor or teacher to others and might not be willing to sign up for any state program or anything, but I would think there are a lot of people who do have something they know how to do well and who would be willing to consider this situation on a casual basis.  Kind of a &quot;let&#39;s see if it might be something we would enjoy&quot; type thing. <br/>

Which is exactly what I like about it and why it struck me as so brilliant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419627724">When I was 13 I started to show dogs professionaly and by the age 16 I wanted to learn more on showing and grooming. That is whne friends of mine helped me get a position working for a professional handler here in the US. They too have done that  and that is how most handlers learn , by working for another handler.<br/>
I worked for a handler and she has been family since than. It was an awesome experience. My parents weere Ok with me dropping out of 11th grade to do it. When I was back in Brazil a year later I went back to school and graduated and then went to Law School. But living abroad, working and learning so much about EVERYTHING was a priceless experience. I worked my little butt off that year and I loved it!<br/>
