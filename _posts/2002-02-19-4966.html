<div id="ygrps-yiv-106508642">I wanted to mention how much I&#39;ve enjoyed the reference book discussion.<br/>
I&#39;ve been picking them up here and there and putting them on the shelf and<br/>
kitchen table etc and now Matthew is *sleeping* with his Scholastic Atlas of<br/>
the World lol he thinks it&#39;s so cool.  I remember really loving our set of<br/>
encyclopdedias and reference books until I *had* to start using them to look<br/>
stuff up for school.  Hopefully Matthew will retain his love for the books I<br/>
remember.....as really cool places to read tidbits about all kinds of really<br/>
neat people places things and animals.<br/>
