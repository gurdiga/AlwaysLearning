<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733936573">Hello, this is Katie from Homeschool.com. Can you post the following message <br/>
on your e-list, message boards, chat groups, etc? We really want to support <br/>

Special Announcement: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LIVE Interview with Eragon Author<br/>
<br/>
This Wednesday, May 19th!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the first time ever, Homeschool.com will be doing a LIVE interview.  This <br/>
Wednesday, May 19th, Homeschool.com will be interviewing Christopher Paolini, <br/>
author of Eragon.  Although he is only in his early twenties, his book is #1 <br/>
on the New York Times bestseller list, he has made guest appearances on both <br/>
the David Letterman and Jay Leno shows, and he has sold the movie rights to his <br/>
book. Christopher attributes his success to the fact that he was <br/>
homeschooled. You can read more about Christopher in Homeschool.com&#39;s April newsletter at <br/>
Homeschool.com.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Christopher is an inspiration to homeschooled teens everywhere and we invite <br/>
both you and your older children to listen in as we interview Christopher and <br/>
find out: <br/>
<br/>
  a.. What type of homeschooling did Christopher do? Unschooling? <br/>
School-at-Home? <br/>
<br/>
  b.. Did he follow a particular curriculum? <br/>
<br/>
  c.. Is his household TV-free? <br/>
<br/>
  d.. How did his parents encourage him? What can we learn from that? <br/>
<br/>
  e.. What advice does he have for other aspiring writers? <br/>
<br/>
  f.. Can he give us a sneak preview on what will happen in Part Two? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
