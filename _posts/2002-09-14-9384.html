<div id="ygrps-yiv-193761282">What a wonderful mother I was thinking I am.... I made fresh cauliflower<br/>
cheese (only veg Zak will eat)... Made my own sauce by making a rue<br/>
first... It was looking delicious.  Just finished making a crown for<br/>
Zak.  I got to be a prince and DH a princess (go figure) by wearing<br/>
Tupperware on our heads, holding sticks as our swords.  What a picture<br/>
perfect day.... When I was making my cauliflower cheese I couldn&#39;t<br/>
figure out why the rue was bubbling up so much.  DH and I kept tasting<br/>
in and it was sort of salty... Persevered and put the sauce on the<br/>
carefully cooked cauliflower and popped it into the oven at 350 for 15<br/>
mins.  Opened the oven to find the sauce covering the entire oven...<br/>
What&#39;s the problem?  DH took it out of the oven (still wearing our<br/>
Tupperware knight helmets) and we tasted it.  It was so salty and not<br/>
possible to eat.  I then said to DH &quot;I don&#39;t understand this... I used<br/>
flour like I usually do&quot;... he suddenly had a thought he said &quot;early Max<br/>
was climbing up on a chair and getting into that cabinet, I bet he<br/>
tipped all the baking soda into the flour bag&quot;.... Sure enough the<br/>
baking soda container was empty and when I looked into the flour bag I<br/>
could see plenty of baking soda.... This brought about an interesting<br/>
conversation with the King (Zak) about the differences between<br/>
substances that are white and look the same... We talked about baking<br/>
soda, baking powder, flour and other cooking substances and how they are<br/>
different and what they are doing... So unfortunately the cauliflower<br/>
cheese went down the sink and turkey sandwiches seem to be lunch<br/>
today...  Zak is now dressed in long pants and long shirt (in 100 degree<br/>
weather) and instructing us on what you need to do to be the King,<br/>
prince and knights of his land.....<br/>
 <br/>
Oh the joys of unschooling..... Zak has decided to go grocery shopping<br/>
with me later to make sure I buy flour and to look at other cooking<br/>
ingredients....<br/>
