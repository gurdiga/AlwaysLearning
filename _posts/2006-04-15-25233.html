<div id="ygrps-yiv-344245121">Some new kids have moved in next door, and are being a bit of a<br/>
problem. My sons don&#39;t have many friends and they have thought it&#39;s<br/>
great. The kids next door are their same ages. The older boy goes to<br/>
public school and the four year old is home all day. Their single<br/>
Mother and Aunt who watch them send them outside to roam the<br/>
neighborhood almost all the time they are home. When my sons ask in<br/>
they can play at their house the boys say they aren&#39;t allowed to go<br/>
inside because their Mom is napping or whatnot. They are all over at<br/>
my house constantly. The problem is that the other kids are VERY<br/>
disrespectful of other people&#39;s things and space, and don&#39;t really<br/>
play with my sons so much as they just come over to use their stuff<br/>
and have somewhere to go. They knock on my door constantly at all<br/>
hours of morning and evening and walk around my house looking in the<br/>
windows. They treat my kids&#39;stuff worse than my kids do. They come<br/>
into our fenced backyard and take my sons&#39; toys over to their house<br/>
without asking, and we even think they came into our house when we<br/>
weren&#39;t home briefly the other night( we had left the back door<br/>
unlocked and they knew we were stepping out to go get dinner). Yes i<br/>
have realized we should have locked up better. I have tried to talk to<br/>
the older boy, who just lies to me. I&#39;m not sure if i should speak<br/>
with his Mom. In all honesty i&#39;d like to tell him he&#39;s not allowed<br/>
over here because he can&#39;t respect our space and my kids can only play<br/>
with him when they are outside, but my sons like having him in the<br/>
house. So what do you do when you feel like your privacy is being<br/>
violated by one of your children&#39;s friends and your children want to<br/>
have that friend over anyway?</div>

Make a deal with the kids that they can&#39;t come over until a certain  <br/>
time, and just tell them flatly not to come in the yard unless it&#39;s  <br/>
that time.  Say &quot;It&#39;s not okay to go in people&#39;s yards&quot; but you can  <br/>
say it nicely.  If the mom and aunt aren&#39;t talking to them plainly,  <br/>
you can.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had neighbors who would come over too early too much before,  <br/>
and I&#39;d say &quot;Wait until noon&quot; or something, depending on the season.<br/>

<br/>
Your own privacy, or your family&#39;s privacy?<br/>
<br/>
Make the boundaries of the yard and house clearer to the other  <br/>
children and their parents, but add when they CAN come over.  Don&#39;t  <br/>
make it seem like a banishment, or the other mom might say &quot;You can  <br/>
never go over there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Help your children get the playtime they want.  You might need to be  <br/>
right there when those kids are over, but if you keep things out they  <br/>
CAN play with or do, and snacks or whatever will keep them occupied  <br/>
and civil, gradually they&#39;ll come to know you and you to know them.<br/>
<br/>
I never hesitate to tell a kid what he can and can&#39;t do at my house,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917024370"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Some new kids have moved in next door, and are being a bit of a<br/>
&gt;&gt;problem.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had to chime in here because we had seemingly the exact same problem when<br/>
we moved here 3 1/2 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
Three children of the same family for whatever reason had little<br/>
understanding of boundaries, at least to my and my children&#39;s liking. Their<br/>
parents were very strict about their own home, but made them stay out of the<br/>
house all day as well. They had restrictions around tv and video games,<br/>
which made our house like an amusement park to them.<br/>
<br/>
This is a Mormon family as well, and being that I didn&#39;t know much yet about<br/>
this religion and having moved into one of the highest populated areas of<br/>
Mormonism, I wasn&#39;t sure if I was dealing with a &quot;cultural&quot; thing as well.<br/>
<br/>
Talking gently yet firmly to the kids, and telling them the boundaries (call<br/>
before you come [they seriously came over and over again all day long<br/>
driving my kids crazy because if they didn&#39;t want to play, they had to keep<br/>
saying no and why and when they would and it was exhausting for them...these<br/>
kids were VERY persistent...AND they were competitive and often mean], you<br/>
may not enter the yard or house without permission, and you need to respect<br/>
us and our stuff) had a little effect, but not much. This behavior that we<br/>
were asking them to change was years in the making...it was going to take<br/>
time and consistency on our part. I spoke to both parents next. Things<br/>
changed a little, but not enough for us.<br/>
<br/>
There were two things that really made it work.<br/>
<br/>
The first was my being there whenever they were around and sticking with the<br/>
boundaries. If they came without calling, I wouldn&#39;t let them in. I would<br/>
say, &quot;You didn&#39;t call first, and we really need that. Give us a call before<br/>
you come.&quot; It may seem mean, but this is what my kids needed to not be<br/>
controlled by the neighbors&#39; obsession. They would find a phone and call,<br/>
and the kids would be able to have better control of what happened next.<br/>
<br/>
The second was dh&#39;s involvement. For whatever reason, his saying, &quot;I know<br/>
we&#39;ve told you ________, and I see you doing it. It may be hard to remember,<br/>
but if you want to be here, you&#39;ve got to follow our ways here. If it<br/>
happens again, you&#39;ll need to stay away for a few days.&quot; I would say the<br/>
same thing and it would not have the effect that dh saying it did (which<br/>
really ticked me off at first because I get my meaning across really well<br/>
thank you, but I believe that may be a &quot;cultural&quot; thing as well...Dad is the<br/>
head of the house).<br/>
<br/>
It took a long time, but they did eventually conform (I hate that word in<br/>
general!). After all, they WANT to be here, so doing what they need to do to<br/>
be here won out...otherwise, they couldn&#39;t be here. And life is much better<br/>
for my kids and dh and me when they&#39;re here...we have a great time together!<br/>
The neighbor kids seem much happier and easier-going too...I think they like<br/>
our ways. It is VERY competitive at their home...they get to relax here and<br/>
not &quot;be the best&quot; at everything.<br/>
<br/>
We are some of the loosest people I know, so this was another telling thing<br/>
for us. Hell if you can&#39;t follow our loose boundaries, then you DO need our<br/>
help!<br/>
<br/>
About the &quot;in the yard, house when you are not there&quot; part...these kids came<br/>
in our house and yard when we were gone as well.<br/>
<br/>
For that one, I called their parents and let them know that the next time it<br/>
became evident that someone was in our house when we were gone, we would<br/>
call the police...not on their children, but because that is what we do when<br/>
someone has illegally entered our home. If it happened that it was their<br/>
children in our house then it would be in the police&#39;s hands and we wanted<br/>
to let them know in advance. Hasn&#39;t happened since.<br/>

This sounds like justification not to tell them you just don&#39;t WANT  <br/>
them in your hard.  Even if you didn&#39;t have dogs or  a shed, they  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be in your yard, or in your shed.<br/>
<br/>
If their mom is harsh, it&#39;s sad to say this but you could use that.   <br/>
You could say &quot;Don&#39;t get in my yard or I&#39;ll call your mom.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would call the county if I had neighbors who put their kids out all  <br/>
day and wouldn&#39;t let them back in.  That&#39;s about the same as sending  <br/>
them over to your house, or out into an alley, or a street.<br/>
<br/>
We had neighbors with one little girl.  Four generations of dull-eyed  <br/>
women in that house, and while I was sympathetic, they did NOT watch  <br/>
that girl, and I suspect that ran in the family.  She would come up  <br/>
the road, three houses, barefooted in a diaper.  And as she got  <br/>
older, she would wander up, dirty, not speaking, finally say &quot;Can I  <br/>
play with your boys?&quot;  Sometimes they played, but she stole things.<br/>
<br/>
Several times I walked her home.  Once it was DARK, after nine, she  <br/>
was not over three, and I walked her to the door, knocked pointedly,  <br/>
ushered her in ahead of me, and said &quot;She was walking past our house  <br/>
and it&#39;s dark.&quot;  They looked at me blankly like they weren&#39;t sure who  <br/>
I was talking about and said &quot;Okay&quot; or something very non-committal.<br/>
<br/>
They weren&#39;t mad at her, or worried, nor did they seem embarrassed or  <br/>
guilty.  They were just as neutral about me.  That happened like a  <br/>
bird might land in the yard and then fly off again.<br/>
<br/>
We just started talking to her, and pointing out to here where the  <br/>
antbeds were (so she wouldn&#39;t stand there) and such.<br/>
<br/>
Once I went over to say the boys thought she had taken their Ernie  <br/>
puppet.  The next day they brought me a grocery sack of zuchinni and  <br/>
the Ernie puppet in it.<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t comfortable, but we did the best we could with it.  I felt  <br/>
sorry for the little girl.  After a few years we moved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510539839">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; The problem is that the other kids are VERY<br/>
disrespectful of other people&#39;s things and space, and don&#39;t really<br/>

and have somewhere to go. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have two thoughts to add to this issue.<br/>
<br/>
When our neighbor kids come over and want to play with Jayn&#39;s <br/>
copious amounts of stuff and exclude her from the game, I have said, <br/>
more than once, &quot;We are not a toy store or play facility. If you <br/>
come here to play, you need to play with Jayn, not just use our <br/>
stuff.&quot; If the visitor and Jayn can&#39;t come to an agreement about <br/>
what to play, I send him or her home. Usually that is immediately <br/>
followed by the other one arriving.<br/>
<br/>
I got very tired of the little boy Jayn&#39;s age peeking in our <br/>
apartment french window, and wanting to hang in our (one) bedroom. I <br/>
realized that I was keeping the vertical blinds fully closed <br/>
constantly, but he was putting his wretched eye to any gap. So I put <br/>
up clear contact on the sliding glass doors to the balcony, which <br/>
has the effect of frosted glass, but still lets in light. (Low <br/>
budget movie trick). Perfectly easy to remove also.<br/>
<br/>
As for the bedroom, I simply repeatedly said, &quot;This room is private&quot; <br/>
and James says the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I have also walked either one of them home (essentially down the <br/>
hall) if there has been a problem, or Jayn has asked that the <br/>
visitor leave.<br/>
<br/>
I guess something that makes me wonder is that if you have a dog, <br/>
and that dog becomes acclimated to having non-family members <br/>
wandering the yard when the family is from home, then maybe the dog <br/>
won&#39;t be much use as a watchdog in the event some real burglar comes <br/>
prowling around. Maybe someone who knows more about dogs would have <br/>
a better take on that....<br/>

&gt; Robyn L Coburn<br/>
&gt; (Just checking in briefly)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is one of my concerns, as my dogs are the type that bark at<br/>
srangers coming around, but wouldn&#39;t bite anyone. They are treated<br/>
like family members and sleep in our bed and whatnot. My main concern<br/>
is that one of my dogs is a pitbull. We raised her from a puppy, and<br/>
she is great with our children and all our other pets including cats<br/>
and rats. But i try very hard to practice responsible pit bull<br/>
ownership, and don&#39;t want any incidents happening with my dog that<br/>
could add to the undue bad name this breed already has. I always<br/>
supervise my dog being around new people and especailly children, and<br/>
if i&#39;m not able to be paying attention at the time i will seperate my<br/>
dog from the situation until i can be paying attention. Well, when<br/>
those children came into my house the other night my pit bull was in<br/>
the house and no one else was here(my other dog was outside, we don&#39;t<br/>
leave the pit bull outside when we aren&#39;t home). I know she wouldn&#39;t<br/>
bite anyone for no reason, but who knows what some mean kid like him<br/>
might do to her to try making her reactionary. So there is the concern<br/>
that my dogs will start to think it&#39;s normal to have strangers walking<br/>
through the yard and house, and there is also the concern that some<br/>
mean kid tresspassing in my house might do something really messed up<br/>
to my dog and get attacked and no one would be here. Myself and my dog<br/>
 held accountable. I have already mentioned this, but we have bought<br/>
warning signs for our house and yard that we will be putting up today.</div>

that they need to NOT go in your yard, ever, when you&#39;re not there or  <br/>

<br/>

that she is a watchdog (does not matter if she is or not) and you do not <br/>
know what would happen if someone just wandered into your house or yard.....<br/>
A little fear on the part of neighbor kids who seem to not understand <br/>
personal space or boundaries is not a bad thing. Much as I like being <br/>
the place where the kids want to come, I would not enjoy it if they were <br/>
little and I was beginning to feel like the neighborhood babysitter. One <br/>
could send their mother a bill for services rendered if it gets <br/>
excessive....<br/>
<br/>
Are you really liable if a kid comes into your home or yard while you <br/>
are gone and gets bit?<br/>
Sure we have all heard the odd story, but I wonder what is statistically <br/>
true.<br/>
And do you have to lock your door if you don&#39;t want to?<br/>

  apartment french window, and wanting to hang in our (one) bedroom. I <br/>
  realized that I was keeping the vertical blinds fully closed <br/>
  constantly, but he was putting his wretched eye to any gap. So I put <br/>
  up clear contact on the sliding glass doors to the balcony, which <br/>
  has the effect of frosted glass, but still lets in light. (Low <br/>
  budget movie trick). Perfectly easy to remove also.<br/>
<br/>
  As for the bedroom, I simply repeatedly said, &quot;This room is private&quot; <br/>
  and James says the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
  I have also walked either one of them home (essentially down the <br/>
  hall) if there has been a problem, or Jayn has asked that the <br/>
  visitor leave.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess something that makes me wonder is that if you have a dog, <br/>
  and that dog becomes acclimated to having non-family members <br/>
  wandering the yard when the family is from home, then maybe the dog <br/>
  won&#39;t be much use as a watchdog in the event some real burglar comes <br/>
  prowling around. Maybe someone who knows more about dogs would have <br/>
  a better take on that....<br/>
