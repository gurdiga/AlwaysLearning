<div id="ygrps-yiv-1414350796">REFERENCES <br/>
I knew there was a list of references to presidents.  I had it linked from <br/>
strewing from Simpsons on my web-web (page/site), but after getting a complaint <br/>
about one of my links not working, I went looking for a new site to link there <br/>
and found all this (AND MORE) at the address listed below.  LOTS of fun, and <br/>
lots of &quot;educational&quot; justification and tie-in.  (More dots to connect!  <br/>
Woohoo!!)<br/>
