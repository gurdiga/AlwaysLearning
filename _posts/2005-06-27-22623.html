<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080214295">Hello! I&#39;m Nicki, live in Minnesota with my dh Jason<br/>
and ds, Kai who is 2 yrs. <br/>
I joined this group because I need the support and<br/>
information brought out by unschoolers. I am just<br/>
starting to look into homeschooling, though I have<br/>
thought about it and learned about it from Kai&#39;s<br/>
birth. It has always just seemed like the natural<br/>
thing to do with him. <br/>
I have read some of Holt&#39;s books and other AP<br/>
parenting books and am always in search of new books<br/>
to help me become a better mama and person. I want to<br/>
have the trust and respect for my ds (and others) that<br/>
I have read about on the web and in books that other<br/>
people have with their kids. I wasn&#39;t raised that way<br/>
so I have to learn it myself. I have respect for my<br/>
son, of course, but not to the extent which I really<br/>
want. If anyone has any good books or web pages with<br/>
great links, send them my way.<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Another thing I wanted to share is to check out this<br/>
months issue (The Game of Life) of Adbusters magazine.<br/>
(www.adbusters.org)<br/>
It&#39;s all about American cultures take on birth,<br/>
schooling and homeschooling, advertising to youth,<br/>
etc. It&#39;s really a great issue. <br/>

Hi Nicki,<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if you knew it, but there is a Minnesota Unschooling list.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/unschoolingmn/</a>   (Maybe you&#39;re a member but I didn&#39;t see your name. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Its not very active right now but it has its spurts. :)<br/>
<br/>
I know that some of the people down near the cities get together. So if you&#39;re down south you could possibly connect with some unschoolers there.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about 4 hours north from there, so I don&#39;t get to their get togethers.  :( <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am trying tho&#39;,  I&#39;ll surprise them sometime. ;)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
***If anyone has any good books or web pages with<br/>
great links, send them my way.<br/>
Thanks!***<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming you&#39;ve found Sandra&#39;s site since you&#39;re here, but in case you found this list another way:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a list that might be perfect for you (in addition to this one, if you <br/>
want to stay--not trying to run you off).   It&#39;s called Always Unschooled.   <br/>
It&#39;s linked here.   The Unschooling Basics list would probably be helpful too.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you wanted to ride a bike and had read several books about riding bikes, <br/>
and came to a bike forum to ask what other books you should read, I&#39;m sure some <br/>
of them would say &quot;Get a bike and ride it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
More books is probably not what you need right now.   One thing that will <br/>
help immensely is to learn yourself, on yourself (and by observing your son&#39;s <br/>
learning), that most learning doesn&#39;t come from books, and confidence, trust and <br/>
respect are in actions and interactions and are slowly built, not gotten from <br/>
books.<br/>
<br/>
So here.  Books   Something to read about books.   Not because reading is <br/>
good, but you   might want to distance yourself a little bit from books.   You <br/>
could still sit next to the bookcase (GOD KNOWS I have thousands), but look the <br/>
other direction more often for a while. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
