<div id="ygrps-yiv-44481623">---I just got off the phone with my mom, and she again went into great detail about how bad alexx would get as a teen. I said that so far I was LOVING Alexx&#39;s teen years...She laughed and said, what Alexx has been a teen for three weeks. AHHH. I stuck up for Alexx and our relationship, I even told her that when I dropped Alexx off with friends, Alexx kissed me goodbye, and she thought that was amazing, while I thought it was just a normal part of our relationship. It&#39;s so sad, how my mom thinks that it&#39;s going to get &quot;bad&quot; with Alexx. Sad.----<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I think is sad is that parents take no responsibility for how teens act. That if their children have any problems, that the problems might be them or how they treat them.<br/>
<br/>
I read a book called &quot;Reviving Ophelia&quot; when my dd was little. What I got out of it was that, wow, you *could* have a good relationship with your child if you didnt treat them like second class citizens. I made the mistake of trying to talk to my mom about it. Of course, I was one of those bad teens. She says now, what could she do? Her stance is that I was just a hellcat and all she could do was try to corral me the best she could. Tough Love she called it. My mom thinks that it was just her between me and the abyss of total destruction.<br/>
<br/>
She doesnt think that she had anything to do with driving me to the abyss. She doesnt think she had anything to do with me wanting to destruct. Life, for me, was really painful and awful, and yes, I was a &quot;bad teen&quot;. I dont want to sit here and blame my parents for my actions. But I really didnt know there were other choices. I didnt know there were other ways to live. I guess I was locked into my  vision of how teens were supposed to act, too. And my parents had their ideas of how parents act and how teens act, and we all did what we thought we had to do, I guess. That is really sad.<br/>
<br/>
What is good is that I know there is another way. And so do you. Maybe your mom will allow herself to see it, maybe not.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s because most people have no concept that there could be  <br/>
life without school.<br/>
<br/>
I have two teen stories of today.  One was at 4:30 and one was ten  <br/>
minutes ago.<br/>
<br/>
The first, I was at Boston Market (a food place) with Holly (16) and  <br/>
Brett, her boyfriend.  Holly&#39;s shy about ordering.  She fears menus  <br/>
and choices sometimes.  I was going to order for her (it&#39;s a walk-up  <br/>
counter like a cafeteria, like Subway).  Brett apologized to me for  <br/>
making the problem worse by ordering for Holly all the time.  It was  <br/>
sweet, though, and I said it was okay.  Holly said to Brett and me  <br/>
both (and I wrote it down on my debit-card envelope):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a very complicated issue.  Why do you always have to simplify  <br/>
things?&quot;<br/>
It was a self-deprecating joke, and a good one.<br/>
<br/>
Marty (19) was in here a minute ago.  I told him I don&#39;t feel good  <br/>
and I&#39;m about to go to bed.  He said he&#39;s about to walk up to the  <br/>
park to play basketball.  It&#39;s not the nearest park to us btw, or the  <br/>
second nearest.  It&#39;s half a mile or more.  Two cars are sitting in  <br/>
the driveway, but he chooses to walk.   I asked if he would do me a  <br/>
big favor before he left.  I told him where there was a box of  <br/>
kleenex three rooms away, and asked him if he would please bring it  <br/>
to  me.<br/>
<br/>
He looked at me and said in a kind of indignant tone that confused me  <br/>
at first.  I thought he wasn&#39;t going to do it.  He said &quot;Mom, that is  <br/>
not a big favor.  That is MINISCULE.&quot; and he went and got the kleenex.<br/>
<br/>
Keith used to worry, years ago, that I was letting them &quot;talk back,&quot;  <br/>
and argue with me.  I told  him if they could win arguments with me  <br/>
they could win arguments with anyone, so it was good practice for  <br/>
both of us.  He quit worrying about it a long time ago.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s examples show what can happen if conversations are  <br/>
straightforward and kind and honest.  It takes a few years to get to  <br/>
that good point, but it&#39;s possible that teens who have very few  <br/>
restrictions of any kind past expectations that they&#39;ll let us know  <br/>
where they are and who they&#39;re with will want to be home, happily  <br/>
telling us what they did when they were gone.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I had breakfast with a friend who also has three kids.  One  <br/>
was homeschooled after 1st or 2nd grade.  The next two started off  <br/>
unschooled and ended up in school because of the parents&#39;  <br/>
separation.  We were talking about romances and dating and honesty.   <br/>
Her 16 year old, she said, has probably had sex and has a  <br/>
girlfriend.  She said her daughter (who is 18) wouldn&#39;t tell  her if  <br/>
she had a boyfriend, because she would be too afraid her dad would  <br/>
find out.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not healthy that they can&#39;t talk about those things.<br/>

<br/>
I had a difficult life as a teen as well, and I made choices that were the best I could do in <br/>
the circumstances.  The problem was that my decisions were all reactionary.  They weren&#39;t <br/>
real decisions based on information and weighing the options--they were me doing what I <br/>
could to try to preserve my sense of integrity.  I had adults around me doing some pretty <br/>
cr**py things, yet holding me responsible for how I responded to it.  Not fair!  I don&#39;t <br/>
blame my parents for any choices I made once I was an adult--out on my own and <br/>
responsible for myself, and I don&#39;t actually spend much time thinking about my teen years <br/>
anymore, but I do have people in my life that won&#39;t &quot;forgive&quot; me for a few things that <br/>
happened as a teen, and I actually feel very divorced from the whole time.  <br/>
<br/>
I, who feel very responsible for every decision I make or don&#39;t make and talk with my kids <br/>
frequently about those issues, don&#39;t feel an ounce of responsibility for things I did or said <br/>
back then--because none of it was me.  It all came from feelings over divorce, affairs, <br/>
abandonment, alcoholism & drug use, etc.  They did those things--not me.  And I didn&#39;t <br/>
have any adults in my life at that time that had any attention on what I might want to be <br/>
or do.  No one was supporting me in my journey to adulthood--I had to figure that stuff <br/>
out all on my own.  I, too, feel so grateful to be able to give my kids so much more <br/>
support than I had.  I LOVE the conversations I&#39;m having with my almost-teen.  Through <br/>
my connection with ds I am able to see the incredibly grounding value of having a multi-<br/>
age perspective.  He&#39;ll still be going through his own journey, but not alone.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this contributes to why so many teens are angry--they&#39;ve essentially been <br/>
abandoned.  Maybe not through any extraordinary circumstances, but through the <br/>
degradation of trust that happens with each criticism, each time-out or &quot;loss of <br/>
priviledge,&quot; each attempt to control.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s beautiful.  It&#39;s not happy or cheery, but it&#39;s profound.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, talking to my friend, we talked about a year-long problem  <br/>
with her middle child, whose dad forces him to go to Albuquerque  <br/>
Academy.  He hates it and wanted to keep homeschooling.  The dad  <br/>
doesn&#39;t care what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
The dad doesn&#39;t care what he wants.  That is not my opinion.  It&#39;s  <br/>
what the dad has told him, in words to his face, and certainly in deeds.<br/>
<br/>
The boy was hospitalized for bulemia.  He weighed about 100 pounds--a  <br/>
sixteen year old boy.  When he was 11, 12, he was a pudgy but strong  <br/>
and quick kid I figured would be a football player.  It was like slow- <br/>
motion suicide.<br/>
<br/>
I asked the mom whether the counsellors or anyone involved said it  <br/>
was because he didn&#39;t want to be at the Academy.  She said no, none  <br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
The only way he can win is for his dad to lose.  He only controls his  <br/>
own life in those moments he chooses to do other than what his dad  <br/>
says he has to do.<br/>
<br/>
How is that rebellion, really?  He&#39;s trying with his entire human  <br/>
being to BE a human being.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a long talk with my daughter&#39;s best friend about 2 weeks ago.  Her<br/>
father is extremely controlling, not in the traditional parenting type<br/>
way, but the abusive and manipulative type way.  I asked her why she<br/>
didn&#39;t just do something that she wanted to do and she said she didn&#39;t<br/>
have a choice.  I told her that she did have a choice to do whatever she<br/>
wanted to and that she would have to deal with her dad if she made other<br/>
choices than what he told her she had to do.  I told her that one day,<br/>
wether it be tomorrow, or next year or the year after, she will have to<br/>
defy her father to do what she wants.  He&#39;s made it an inevitable thing<br/>
and his reasoning for being so controling is to keep her from doing all<br/>
those things and to make her respect him.  What he is ensuring is that<br/>
she will have to go against him to get what she wants in life.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think that she&#39;d ever thought of it that way, that her father has set<br/>
her up to defy him, but that she has the choice to do so or not sooner<br/>
or later.<br/>
<br/>
There is no way around it.  I think that is really sad.  The only way<br/>
she can win is if her dad loses, but is that really winning?  They both<br/>
lose, she will lose her dad as a parent, not because he won&#39;t be there,<br/>
but if she defies him, it will drive a bigger wedge between them than<br/>
there already is.<br/>
<br/>
It is really hard to sit back and watch that all play out.  I know<br/>
Chamille feels that pain too.  Our house used to be a safe place for<br/>
those kids, but the dad won&#39;t let them be here anymore.  It&#39;s an<br/>
interesting guiding compass of how to NOT be.  It provides a lot of<br/>
conversations about how and why people behave the way they do and better<br/>
ways they could behave.  I ran across a letter that Chamille had written<br/>
to the dad about 6 months ago.  She didn&#39;t send it because I asked her<br/>
not to.  I wish now that she would&#39;ve sent it.  It was very to the point<br/>
and she was so succinct in how she wrote about his controlling behavior<br/>
and how it affected her and his daughter.  At the time I still had hope<br/>
that he would snap out of it and things would get better, and that such<br/>
a letter would gaurantee it not happening.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately kids will do what they want to do, inspite of their parents. <br/>
I like that my kids will get to do what they want to do because of me,<br/>
not inspite of me.  I love that I can do that, that I can give that to<br/>
them as a precious gift.</div>

<br/>
How about when your kids are very angry and being very disrespectful of all family members?  How about when they are not finding any balance for themselves--like not doing the chores for their animals, and playing a video game ALL DAY?  I have seen the anger, disrespect (talking very rudely, screaming, slamming doors etc) escalate daily.  I really think a lot of it is DUE to all that screen time.  But I do not know that is the only reason...of course there is never only 1 reason for anything, but I do feel it is playing a great part in this excessive anger and rudeness.   What can you do about this type of thing while still allowing your teen the control they want, but at the same time, keeping your home a place of respect and peace and keeping younger children from being emotionally upset ( and abused!) by the whole thing??<br/>
<br/>
Looking for ideas.  Right now, counseling looks like a good one, as I feel he does not have the normal filter mechanisms most of us use to control anger and reactions to things.  Yes, I know hormones are involved--I have tried very calmly discussing my childhood and how my father was very angry and how it affected all those around him, and how really, he just needed some tools to help him reroute his anger when his brain went on overload.  I have said that i think sometimes we have to help our brains channel things....like count to 2, snap 2x, think of a strange word....anything that breaks the volcanic eruption and allows the steam to escape without killing everything down-mountain.  I support him and have said that I will go with him to talk to someone, or not.  That I really was very angry when I was his age too, as that was what I was taught thru my father&#39;s modeling of his behavior, and that it took many years...a decade+ to figure out new ways to deal with things.  And I sure would&#39;ve liked a shorter route to where I am today! <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions are welcome!<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<br/>
I really doubt that it is the screen time.  If it&#39;s the only thing to do and he had to play what he&#39;s playing, I could see it then.  But the gaming causing the things you&#39;re saying... I just haven&#39;t seen it.  My kids play a lot of video games and computer games and they aren&#39;t rude or screaming or slamming doors.  I&#39;m not saying that don&#39;t get angry over things.  But video games aren&#39;t making  kids rude or disrespectful.<br/>
<br/>
***How about when they are not finding any balance for themselves--like not doing the chores for their animals, and playing a video game ALL DAY?***  <br/>
If he isn&#39;t feeling like taking care of his animal right now is there a way to help him for a while.  Maybe he&#39;s changed his mind about having it?  Maybe he&#39;d rather do something else right now.  Feeling trapped in something, not in control,  would make me angry.  <br/>
<br/>
***Looking for ideas. Right now, counseling looks like a good one, as I feel he does not have the normal filter mechanisms most of us use to control anger and reactions to things.***<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about counseling.  I don&#39;t know of many counselors who are going to respect what your son wants.    <br/>
<br/>
Can you just hang with him and do fun stuff?  Spend time with him, play with him..  offer other things too besides the video games, but be OK with it if he wants to do that.  My 15 yr old son still likes it when I play with him.  And if I can&#39;t play what he&#39;s playing just being beside him as he&#39;s doing his gaming or what ever he&#39;s doing is great bonding time. :)<br/>

******I have a child who *can* be volatile, and yes some people could think  <br/>
it&#39;s from screen time (or whatever they feel like blaming at the moment ) but <br/>
I  think it&#39;s his makeup, his personality and probably hormones too. He&#39;s of <br/>
the  *perfectionist* type .<br/>
 <br/>
When he gets frustrated or angry or annoyed, he *can* be loud and sometimes  <br/>
disrespectful. And the other child is almost always calm and sweet even in  <br/>
anger. So there&#39;s that very obvious comparison that people do make, which  <br/>
doesn&#39;t help. <br/>
 <br/>
I try to help him through it. We talk about different ways to  channel his <br/>
anger and frustration. And look for times that might make him easily  <br/>
frustrated, like making sure his body has nutrition.<br/>
 <br/>
But in the heat of the moment , one is not always rational , and I look at  <br/>
it as *you feel what you feel*  and some kids are more volatile than  others, <br/>
yet they still need to express themselves. They need to let their  feelings out <br/>
and not keep them bottled up inside. And of all places their home  needs to <br/>
one of safety and a place where they can be heard, whether it&#39;s good or  bad.<br/>
 <br/>
We had an incident the other day. he was playing video games and on the  <br/>
computer and taking his time getting ready for baseball ( which he LOVES!) and  <br/>
his father was getting very impatient and annoyed. <br/>
 <br/>
He was definitely going to be late and then the coach would flip out  and my <br/>
son would feel awful ,etc.<br/>
 So there were words and loudness and stomping off and then a  quivering, yet <br/>
angry face that stormed off to the car. <br/>
 <br/>
In the meantime I reiterated my belief on the home being a safe haven and a  <br/>
place to be able to verbalize anything , to the rest of the family who was  <br/>
there. And answered the question of &quot;How is he going to be on time when he&#39;s out <br/>
 in the world and has a job? &quot; with &quot;he&#39;s 11 1/2 ! If he lives in a loving,  <br/>
respectful and safe home making his own choices he WILL be a  responsible <br/>
person, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
I asked  him to come back into the house for a  minute. You could tell he <br/>
wanted to come but didn&#39;t.  He came up the walk  very slowly.  I gave him a hug <br/>
and told him to have a good practice. He  hugged tight and went off.<br/>
 <br/>
Later that night he came to me and said he was sorry he flipped out in the  <br/>
afternoon. We talked a long time about feelings and how we can help ourselves  <br/>
deal with things.<br/>
 <br/>
I think a child needs to know they are loved no matter  <br/>
what...unconditionally. People can say but my child knows I love him. But does  he really?????  How <br/>
do you know that??? You have to *show* him<br/>

I would say &quot;help them find balance&quot; but it seems you would do that  <br/>

do more for them and help them do what they want to do,  you will see  <br/>
(not tomorrow, but at some point) that they will want to do more for  <br/>
you and help you do what you want to do.<br/>

teen the control they want, but at the same time, keeping your home a  <br/>
place of respect and peace and keeping younger children from being  <br/>
emotionally upset ( and abused!) by the whole thing??-=-<br/>
<br/>
#1:  Stop thinking of &quot;control.&quot;  Start thinking of choices.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/control">http://sandradodd.com/control</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Yes, I know hormones are involved--I have tried very calmly  <br/>
discussing my childhood and how my father was very angry and how it  <br/>
affected all those around him, and how really, he just needed some  <br/>
tools to help him reroute his anger when his brain went on overload.  <br/>
I have said that i think sometimes we have to help our brains channel  <br/>
things....like count to 2, snap 2x, think of a strange  <br/>
word....anything that breaks the volcanic eruption and allows the  <br/>
steam to escape without killing everything down-mountain.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is he the oldest?  Maybe he needs lots of pampering.  Do you deliver  <br/>
food to him where he&#39;s playing his games?  Do you keep the other kids  <br/>
away so he can have some quiet privacy, or do you expect him to  <br/>
negotiate and arrange for his own privacy?  Are the other kids  <br/>
bugging him?<br/>
<br/>
-=-t I really was very angry when I was his age too, as that was what  <br/>
I was taught thru my father&#39;s modeling of his behavior, and that it  <br/>
took many years...a decade+ to figure out new ways to deal with  <br/>
things. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Taught through my father&#39;s modeling&quot; is too indirect for why you  <br/>
might have been angry.    If it was nature, you might have inherited  <br/>
(genetically) a short fuse--quick adrenaline, adrenaline that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
dissipate easily.  It it was nurture, how did an angry father treat  <br/>
you?  What did you need (emotionally, physically) that you didn&#39;t  <br/>
have?  How were you needy?<br/>

That page is too unfinished to really put out there.  I should work  <br/>
on it.  But counting to two, snap2x, that&#39;s *nothing.*  It&#39;s too little.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764446797">&quot; How about when your kids are very angry and being very disrespectful<br/>
of all family members?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let it go, you count to ten, and remain calm.  Ask others to stay away<br/>
from that person and give them space, let that person know that you all<br/>
are going to get out of his space so that he can get himself in a better<br/>
mood.  Absolutely don&#39;t antagonize the situation.  Don&#39;t lecture, don&#39;t<br/>
say anything negative or shameful.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How about when they are not finding any balance for themselves--like<br/>
not doing the chores for their animals, and playing a video game ALL<br/>
DAY? I have seen the anger, disrespect (talking very rudely, screaming,<br/>
slamming doors etc) escalate daily. I really think a lot of it is DUE to<br/>
all that screen time. But I do not know that is the only reason...of<br/>
course there is never only 1 reason for anything, but I do feel it is<br/>
playing a great part in this excessive anger and rudeness. What can you<br/>
do about this type of thing while still allowing your teen the control<br/>
they want, but at the same time, keeping your home a place of respect<br/>
and peace and keeping younger children from being emotionally upset (<br/>
and abused!) by the whole thing??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling and freedom are new to the family, let it go.  It will<br/>
take a while for people to find their comfort in the newness.  If a<br/>
child is used to control, it is sort of a stability of sorts to rely on.<br/>
If you take it away a kid might feel a little like they are floundering<br/>
about not knowing what to do or how to behave.  Screen time is NOT the<br/>
issue, it could very well be the solution.  Don&#39;t interupt it, don&#39;t<br/>
belittle it, let it happen.  Offer things, and accept &quot;no&quot; as an answer.<br/>
Anger and rudeness are reactionary behaviors, don&#39;t give any reason to<br/>
react in that way.  Do it enough times that a child can calm down and<br/>
stop reacting.  Keep doing it.<br/>
<br/>
No one has ultimate control.  Perhaps instead of seeing it as taking the<br/>
parental control and handing it over to the child, see it as learning<br/>
how to navigate together, no one is in control or everyone is.  Really<br/>
the ONLY thing a person can control is their own behavior, pretty much<br/>
everything else is circumstantial.<br/>
<br/>
As to keeping younger children safe, refer to above about directing them<br/>
elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Right now, counseling looks like a good one, as I feel he does not have<br/>
the normal filter mechanisms most of us use to control anger and<br/>
reactions to things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe he is reacting perfectly normal to a control based environment<br/>
and he feels very intensly about being controlled.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend<br/>
counseling.  If you work for a year at happy relationship building<br/>
without control and he is still having problems, then maybe counseling<br/>
could help.  Counseling could just be another cause of resentment over<br/>
control though.  How are you going to get him there if he doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to go?  Really!  A counselor isn&#39;t necessarily going to help him with<br/>
anger and stuff either.  Counselors are mostly there to listen and<br/>
interpret and offer advice here and there.  Wouldn&#39;t it be cool if you<br/>
as the parent, could do that and be that for your kids?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve often looked at my role as a mom as one of a counselor and advisor.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504644063">My 17 year old (unschooler 8 years/graduating from high school this <br/>
year) wants a tattoo.  I have never stopped living the unschooling <br/>
lifestyle with her.  School and everything else she has done has been <br/>
her choice and though she no longer unschools, I never fell into the <br/>
school mentality and always looked at it as her option, not something <br/>
she had to do or do well at.  I just support her. I have LOVED the teen <br/>
years with her.  She is now saying she wants a tatoo.  Bob (dh) is <br/>
happy to take her.  She wants a small one on her back that says in <br/>
French, &quot;I love my brother&quot;  in memory of Sam.<br/>
As beautiful as that is, I really don&#39;t like the idea of a young person <br/>
getting a tattoo.   Actually, it&#39;s just MY young person, that is <br/>
bothering me.  What if she regrets it later?  I am technically still <br/>
responsible for this.  Has anyone dealt with this?  I have asked her to <br/>
wait til she is 18,(in Sept) but she thinks that is arbitrary and <br/>
want&#39;s it before summer.  <br/>
I need words of wisdom.  She wouldn&#39;t do it, if she knew it would <br/>
really upset  me, but she keeps mentioning it and I can&#39;t put her off <br/>
much longer. She wants my blessing.  I really can&#39;t see myself drawing <br/>
a line in the sand over this, but I really feel uncomfortable with it <br/>
too.  Is there anyway to be at peace about it?<br/>
Bob is going on his birthday, April 15, to get another one.  He has a <br/>
portrait of Sam on his arm, and has added his dates and then added Sams <br/>
signature from a letter he wrote to Bob, then he put angels on his <br/>
shoulder (we lost another son Jay when I was 8 mos preg with him) so <br/>
the angels represent both boys.  Now he&#39;s getting 2 wolves (Sam loved <br/>
wolves).  I have heard tattoos can be addicting and it seems to be <br/>
playing out with him.  She want&#39;s to go with him to get hers.<br/>
I really wish I could change her mind.<br/>
Any tattooed teens out there?<br/>
Or tattooed adults that regret it? Or don&#39;t.<br/>
Help!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339695894">How sweet that she wants to get a tattoo in memory of Sam!  I&#39;m sure it <br/>
will be a tasteful one, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Tattoos seem to be very popular here in New Mexico -- everything from <br/>
gang logos to a lover&#39;s name on your neck (ick) or kids&#39; <br/>
names/birthdates in very visible and elaborate detail.  Many are over <br/>
the top, and the lower back seems very popular with girls, too.<br/>
<br/>
I have friends with one or more tattoos, and my oldest son got his <br/>
first tattoo at 17, with my permission and blessing (and I didn&#39;t even <br/>
know then what he&#39;d get). His first tat is a HUGE dragon that occupies <br/>
virtually all of his lower right leg. He&#39;s added a second one now, a <br/>
New Mexico zia (sun) sign, and is contemplating several more (he&#39;s 23, <br/>
btw).  <br/>
<br/>
Personally, my feeling was I could &#39;let&#39; him get one at a quality, <br/>
clean tattoo parlor with my oversight, and know it was safe and he&#39;d <br/>
have a good experience, or I could draw my line in the sand and risk <br/>
that he&#39;d make an unsafe choice in getting a tattoo. And if he had to <br/>
hide it from me, what kind of aftercare would he be able to get?<br/>
<br/>
I had to remember, too, that my hallmark reason for unschooling my kids <br/>
is a fervent dedication to their personal autonomy and sovereignty over <br/>
their own bodies and lives. So, I said yes, told him he could spend his <br/>
travel money on it (he used my sister&#39;s tattoo artist during a visit to <br/>
her home in Texas) and told my sister he had total freedom in what he <br/>
wanted.  Hence, the very big, elaborate -- and beautiful -- gold dragon <br/>
on his leg.  He even negotiated a discount by allowing the tattoo <br/>
artist to use the finished product in some ad layouts for his business!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll admit, too, that tattoos fascinate me. I&#39;ve thought about getting <br/>
one over the years, but I&#39;m not crazy about pain, and I have so many <br/>
allergies I&#39;m afraid I&#39;d end up with a huge reaction under my skin!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say let her get the tattoo. <br/>

Holly and I were discussing lately that we haven&#39;t seen any gold and  <br/>
red Zias on people, and it seems we would.  They&#39;re on trucks and  <br/>

<br/>
She had seen one, but it was a different color--khaki or dark green  <br/>
or something.<br/>
<br/>
Keith doesn&#39;t like tattoos at all.  I have no urge.  Holly talks  <br/>
about getting one.  I&#39;ve asked her to wait until she&#39;s 18.  Keith  <br/>
doesn&#39;t even like ear piercings.  It won&#39;t hurt her to do him that  <br/>
courtesy.  He didn&#39;t say no about ear piercings.  He said he would  <br/>
rather she didn&#39;t, but they&#39;re her ears.  He probably wouldn&#39;t say no  <br/>
about a tattoo, because she probably wouldn&#39;t ask him.  She asked me  <br/>
what I thought, and understood my concern and advice.  If she decides  <br/>
not to wait, we&#39;ll still love her. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766725702">My oldest got a tattoo at 17.  She knew exactly what she wanted, drew it herself.  My next is going to get one this summer; she&#39;ll be a couple months shy of 17.  In our state you can get a tattoo at 16 with parental consent.<br/>
<br/>
  I have no concerns with either of my daughters getting tattoos.  They researched it thoroughly, are fully aware that they are considered permanent, and it was important to them.  It wasn&#39;t a spur of the moment decision - although those aren&#39;t always wrong either.  I think your daughter wanting to honor her brother in this way is beautiful; considering that it is for her brother, it&#39;s not likely that she would ever regret that.  Also, I think it&#39;s much easier to have a tattoo removed than it used to be.  I truly don&#39;t think 18 and almost 18 makes any difference.  It&#39;s only a matter of a few months.<br/>
<br/>
  Do you know what your main concern is with the tattoo.  Is that you are afraid she&#39;ll change her mind later on about having it?  Afraid that it&#39;ll lead to more tattoos?  Or is it that you don&#39;t care for tattoos?  I know how that can feel.  My 16 yr old dd has numerous piercings.  I don&#39;t like piercings.  It&#39;s been hard for me to support her in this, and I&#39;ve bit my tongue more times than she knows.  She has shown me that it isn&#39;t a passing fancy, and she is extremely knowledgeable about piercings.  In fact, she hopes to have a piercing/tattoo shop someday.  I&#39;ve have had to put my personal dislikes aside in order to support her, but it has been worth all the effort on my part.  She told me she could care for them, shared her knowledge with me and they were important to her, and I trusted her judgment.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605761627">We have a teacher in my school.  She has multiple piercings and tattoos.  The main ear ones are like a spiral, and the holes are quite big.  I think the spiral is to slowly make the holes bigger and bigger.  She also has three or maybe more nose piercings, and they are not little tiny studs, but a hoop, a pointy thing, and something else...  she has one facial tattoo, and then both arms look like arm warmers, the tattoos are so colorful and cover from her wrists to  under her clothing.  She also has tattoos on her legs and I&#39;m sure elsewhere.  She is quite openly out, although I&#39;m not sure if the kids know.  She has very short spiked hair.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it is changing and body art is becoming more and more acceptable.  Alexx wants a lip piercing.  I&#39;m thinking of letting her, as soon as the divorce is final.  Although I don&#39;t like how that was stated.  <br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, and young girl started in my class, new student.  On day two, she has this LONG (like 8 inches) spike coming out of her lip.  It was not something that would be safe for a young person to wear in a school full of young people.  After talking to her, I discovered that she and her older sister hand pierced the lip the night before and she had to wear this for however long (months)... I was appalled that this 6th grade 11 year old had pierced her own lip.  <br/>
<br/>
So I realize that Alexx could do this on her own.  Not that she would, I don&#39;t see her doing that.  I see us talking about, waiting for the divorce to be final so I have custody completely, and them doing research to see how and where and how to make it happen in the safest possible way, and then us going together and getting it done. <br/>
<br/>
I think she is thinking of a tattoo too.  I&#39;m not opposed.  As long as she breastfeeds and is not a republican, I&#39;m cool with her choices.... (and I&#39;m only sorta kidding.)<br/>

  Really?  My brother has one too -- his is on his right bicep, my son&#39;s is on the inside of his right calf, just above his ankle bone.  He jokes that he&#39;ll cover his right leg in tatts first, then his left.  <br/>
   <br/>
  What did impress me in Will&#39;s decision about getting a tattoo was the thought he gave to where on his body the tattoos should be.  He wanted them to be easily covered, so that if he someday worked a job where he might dress well but roll up his sleeves he wouldn&#39;t be embarrassed; the stomach was too painful, neck too visible (but very popular here for some odd reason).  Ultimately, he figured that if he had a job where shorts were allowed, they&#39;d likely be okay with tattoos.  From what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s rare he wears shorts, even away from work, so I&#39;m not sure how often anyone sees his tattoos.<br/>

  I have 2 tattoos that I love. I have no regrets because they both mean something to me and they take me back to the time when I got them. I think her reason for wanting the tattoo is beautiful and the likely-hood of her regretting the tattoo at a later date is very remote (due to the reason). <br/>
  Here are some questions you could think about that might help you be more peaceful with it and/or clarify why it&#39;s important to you for her to wait. What is it about getting the tattoo that bothers you (is it just the regret factor or maybe also the addiction factor, and have you discussed that with her)? What&#39;s the huge difference between now and September in the timeline of life? Is the potential struggle between you over this tattoo worth damaging your relationship (if that&#39;s a possibility)? Do Bob&#39;s tattoos bother you? And if not, why do you feel differently about your dd having a tattoo? If they do bother you, have you talked to her about why they bother you?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548278491">~~&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; What did impress me in Will&#39;s decision about getting a tattoo<br/>
was the thought he gave to where on his body the tattoos should be. He<br/>
wanted them to be easily covered, so that if he someday worked a job<br/>
where he might dress well but roll up his sleeves he wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
embarrassed; the stomach was too painful, neck too visible (but very<br/>
popular here for some odd reason). Ultimately, he figured that if he<br/>
had a job where shorts were allowed, they&#39;d likely be okay with<br/>
tattoos. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;~~<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s a good idea for the first few tattoos for anyone.<br/>
<br/>
But, they could end up like me,with a job where tattoos and piercings<br/>
are a-ok.:) Out of seven girls at my counter, two don&#39;t have tattoos.<br/>
Most of us have tattoos that show.<br/>

<br/>
Good point.<br/>
<br/>
And there are places in Albuquerque that probably ONLY hire people  <br/>
with piercings and tattoos, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;ll be around  <br/>
thirty years with  great retirement plans or anything. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; about getting one. I&#39;ve asked her to wait until she&#39;s 18. Keith<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t even like ear piercings. It won&#39;t hurt her to do him that<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947313827">Remember back in the early 80s when multiple earrings came into  <br/>
fashion?  Well I was 12 and I HAD to have 2nd holes in each of my  <br/>
ears or I was going to just DIE.  My mom thought that this was  <br/>
ridiculous and refused to let  me do it.  Many, many arguments came  <br/>
of this and finally the reason she had was because that as I became  <br/>
an adult and this fashion passed, then I would be an adult with  <br/>
useless extra holes in my head and regret to go with it.  Well, I  <br/>
thought on this and in my very clever 12-year old mind stated that  <br/>
&quot;well, so will 20 million other girls!&quot;  I guess mom couldn&#39;t argue  <br/>
this one or either she gave up, but I got the extra holes in my  <br/>
head.  But I do like them and still wear earrings in them and just  <br/>
about every person I know anywhere  near my age also had the extra  <br/>
holes.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 19, I got a tattoo on spring break.  Probably not the best  <br/>
set of decision making skills going on at the time.  But I do still  <br/>
like it and don&#39;t regret it at all.  I have even considered getting  <br/>
another one as an (mature) adult.  Tattoos are very fashionable now.   <br/>
That is why I mentioned the earrings above.  Lots and lots of people  <br/>
have tattoos now, even multiple tattoos.  It doesn&#39;t carry the stigma  <br/>
that it once did and that will prove even more true in the future as  <br/>
these &quot;crazy tattooed young people&quot; become the tattooed adults of our  <br/>
society.<br/>
<br/>
It seems as though your daughter has really thought this through and  <br/>
it isn&#39;t as if she is putting &quot;I love (insert current young love)&quot; on  <br/>
herself.  Will her being 18 make her body more her own that it  <br/>
currently is at 17?  If she is just counting down the days until she  <br/>
is 18 to get it and you are both struggling with this every day until  <br/>
then, then why all the waiting?<br/>
<br/>
Also, my younger brother lost a dear friend when they were about 18  <br/>
and he and all his friends had a beautiful tribal band tattoo done on  <br/>
each of their arms with the date.  I know that not a day has gone by  <br/>
that he has regretted it.  Oh, and last year I added another hole to  <br/>
the top of my ear and one to my nose!  Don&#39;t regret those either.   <br/>
Someday, me and all the old ladies at the nursing home can compare  <br/>
all our holes and tats.<br/>

&gt; As beautiful as that is, I really don&#39;t like the idea of a young  <br/>

&gt; getting a tattoo. Actually, it&#39;s just MY young person, that is<br/>
&gt; bothering me. What if she regrets it later? I am technically still<br/>
&gt; responsible for this. Has anyone dealt with this? I have asked her to<br/>
&gt; wait til she is 18,(in Sept) but she thinks that is arbitrary and<br/>
&gt; want&#39;s it before summer.<br/>
&gt; I need words of wisdom. She wouldn&#39;t do it, if she knew it would<br/>
&gt; really upset me, but she keeps mentioning it and I can&#39;t put her off<br/>
&gt; much longer. She wants my blessing. I really can&#39;t see myself drawing<br/>
&gt; a line in the sand over this, but I really feel uncomfortable with it<br/>
&gt; too. Is there anyway to be at peace about it?<br/>
&gt; Bob is going on his birthday, April 15, to get another one. He has a<br/>
&gt; portrait of Sam on his arm, and has added his dates and then added  <br/>
&gt; Sams<br/>
&gt; signature from a letter he wrote to Bob, then he put angels on his<br/>
&gt; shoulder (we lost another son Jay when I was 8 mos preg with him) so<br/>
&gt; the angels represent both boys. Now he&#39;s getting 2 wolves (Sam loved<br/>
&gt; wolves). I have heard tattoos can be addicting and it seems to be<br/>
&gt; playing out with him. She want&#39;s to go with him to get hers.<br/>
&gt; I really wish I could change her mind.<br/>
&gt; Any tattooed teens out there?<br/>

<br/>
I think often the parent&#39;s issues with &quot;fashion&quot; type problems is  <br/>
that the seem so different for us that what we are used to.  We know  <br/>
how we look at people that sport such fashions, but we aren&#39;t in the  <br/>
peer to peer group.  Bell bottoms, hippy hair, fishnet stockings,  <br/>
platform shoes, baggy jeans, guy-liner, big hair.  Oh, the big hair.   <br/>
My mom didn&#39;t have big hair and simply couldn&#39;t stand my own bid  <br/>
hair.  But everyone I knew either had it or tried to have it.<br/>
<br/>
Several years ago when it was fashionable to have pants or shorts  <br/>
with words across the butt like &quot;princess&quot; and such, my husband had a  <br/>
fit and swore that his daughter would never, never wear such stuff!   <br/>
She was 2.  I assured him that no, she never would wear such stuff  <br/>
because that by the time she was at the age when she would want to  <br/>
wear such stuff, it would be out of fashion and there would be  <br/>
something else she wanted to wear that would drive him crazy!<br/>
<br/>
He also has issues with our boys long hair.  He thinks people will  <br/>
look at them like they are loosers or worse...girls.  But my  <br/>
experience with them is that almost everyone they meet thinks their  <br/>
hair is really, really cool.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that tattoos are much more permanent than words on the  <br/>
shorts or long hair, but in a society where it seems that most of the  <br/>
young people are getting tattoos on their body, it can&#39;t  possibly  <br/>
carry the same stigma into the future of their work or marriages.<br/>

<br/>
Parental consent shouldn&#39;t mean that the parents HAVE to consent,  <br/>
though.  If the mom is uncomfortable for ANY reason, she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
consent.<br/>
<br/>
When unschoolers decide to give a lot of surprising choices and  <br/>
leeway to their children, we&#39;re not giving them what&#39;s theirs  <br/>
originally, we&#39;re giving them what is OURS, morally, legally,  <br/>
ethically.   We&#39;re letting them make choices that our society  <br/>
believes are the parents&#39; to make.<br/>
<br/>
If I let my children drive all around Albuquerque without telling me  <br/>
where they&#39;ll be, that doesn&#39;t mean it would be just as okay for me  <br/>
to find out they were in California.<br/>
<br/>
If I let my children choose what they&#39;ll wear, that doesn&#39;t mean I  <br/>
would be obligated to remain calm and accepting if they went out naked.<br/>
<br/>
Taking things to an extreme is useful in terms of seeing what the  <br/>
principle is.  I don&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t care what you wear.&quot;  I say &quot;Do  <br/>
you need help deciding what&#39;s appropriate?&quot;  And they don&#39;t,  <br/>
usually.  And sometimes I ask them what would be best for me to wear  <br/>
here or there, and based on principles of what&#39;s likely to be the  <br/>
tone and formality level or practical needs of the event at hand,  <br/>
they&#39;ll help me decide.  Different shoes for a wedding or for hiking  <br/>
over to the rock house.  Remind out of state guests that it&#39;s about  <br/>
30 degrees colder on the top of the mountain than it is at the base;  <br/>
more if it&#39;s windy.<br/>
<br/>
Same with any kinds of decisions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Oh, the big hair. My mom didn&#39;t have big hair and simply couldn&#39;t  <br/>

<br/>
Big hair is gone with one shampoo.  Tattoos aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Long straight hair can be put up in curlers anytime.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly wore a green mini-dress I&#39;ve had since 1972. It has  <br/>
mirrored embroidery (shisha) all down the front.  She took out the  <br/>
hem!!!  I hemmed it up years ago to make it short enough to be a  <br/>
decent mini-dress, and she took it down and wore it to her  <br/>
boyfriend&#39;s birthday gathering.  It was halfway down to her knees.<br/>
<br/>
Even mini skirts can be undone later. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<br/>
In 1970 or so I was riding with my dad and someone was walking along  <br/>
the road with long hair, corduroy jacket and jeans.  My dad was  <br/>
grumbling about &quot;can&#39;t even tell if it&#39;s a boy or a girl,&quot; and I  <br/>
asked  him why it mattered.  It was a serious question, and a good  <br/>
discussion.  He said so he would know how to treat them.  He was from  <br/>
the days when there were lots of things one needed to do, like open  <br/>
doors for women or stand up when they came in.  I said it might be  <br/>
better if people started treating other people the same way without  <br/>
regard for whether they were female or not (early Women&#39;s Movement  <br/>
days there...).  We actually listened to each other. It wasn&#39;t an  <br/>
argument.  It was cool.  I know right where we were, in Espanola,  <br/>
driving south between the Santa Cruz turnoff and the Y.  I told him  <br/>
we were in the car and the person was on the side of the road, and it  <br/>
didn&#39;t affect how we passed by.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If it carries ANY stigma, though, or could make it more difficult for  <br/>
a person&#39;s opportunities in any aspect of life, it&#39;s worth advising  <br/>
them of that instead of saying &quot;Yeah, sure, whatever; it&#39;s your body.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who worked honor guard at Arlington cemetery when he  <br/>
was in the Navy.  He would&#39;ve rather been a SEAL.  But he was tall,  <br/>
had no facial scars and no visible tattoos, so that&#39;s where they put  <br/>
him.  If you have a possible future military kid who definitely does  <br/>
NOT want to be doing formal ceremonies, that&#39;s information they could  <br/>
use to get out of that.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a kid who might want to grow up to be a judge or a  <br/>
politician, they might not want to have tattoos.  SOMEday it won&#39;t  <br/>
matter, but some paths need approval of people who are fifty years  <br/>
older than a person, and if those people don&#39;t like tattoos, it will  <br/>
matter until they&#39;re all dead.<br/>

not sure<br/>
what she thought my reaction would be, but I tried hard not to have a<br/>
reaction except I&#39;m sure my disappointment showed.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There must be more to this story.  How does an 11 year old get to a  <br/>
place to have ears pierced?  Who paid for it or did it?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this is a child in school, there were other pressures and  <br/>
influences.  If the relationship between parent and child was such  <br/>
that rules were made and the only way the child could win was for the  <br/>
parent to lose, that&#39;s important information for us to have.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly decided about having her ears pierced, she thought about  <br/>
it a long time, and talked to many people.  I don&#39;t remember how old  <br/>
she was.  Sorry.  Maybe nine?<br/>
<br/>
Last year she put another hole in her ear, herself, in expression of  <br/>
a life change (lost a friendship by standing up for principles) and  <br/>
because she did it without asking, she didn&#39;t get any advice about  <br/>
what might&#39;ve made it hurt less.  But we didn&#39;t get mad about it at  <br/>
all.  She did it in the bathroom of the room I was in, in fact,  <br/>
during the time, and came out and showed us.  It wasn&#39;t rebellion.   <br/>
She had all the tools to  make a decision like that, and she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
do crazy things.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of things in life take the agreement of two or three people.  It  <br/>
happens with business partnerships, music groups, parents and  <br/>
children, marriages, people on road trips...  When one single person  <br/>
calls all the shots and makes all the rules, it&#39;s not a relationship  <br/>
anymore, it&#39;s more like controlling or bullying.  And that&#39;s true  <br/>
whether that one single person is the dad or the mom or the kid.<br/>
<br/>
When people are used to making decisions together, it wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
usually occur to one of them to make a decision without consulting  <br/>
the other.  My friend Jeff and I have been doing a series of  <br/>
Wednesday discussions.  I talk to him about  topics and food.  I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t cancel one without talking to him.  It&#39;s not that I couldn&#39;t  <br/>
do it legally, but within the expectations of our 22-year-old- <br/>
friendship, it&#39;s just not done.  That&#39;s why we HAVE a 22 year old  <br/>
friendship.  If it were like a parent/child relationship, he&#39;d&#39;ve  <br/>
&quot;been 18&quot; a long time ago.<br/>
