<div id="ygrps-yiv-528797427">I agree about the toxic parents Jessica.... I wrote this afternoon about the<br/>
wonderful time I had with Zak making chocolate covered strawberries... Then<br/>
Max got up and we were still making them.  He wanted to help.  I kept him<br/>
away from the stove and made sure it was off and I turned away for 5 seconds<br/>
and Max (2,5 yrs) put his hand on the burner.... Hubby walked in from work 3<br/>
mins later and we ended up at the hospital.  He has 2nd degree burns on his<br/>
right hand, possibly 3rd,  we are taking him to the burn unit tomorrow<br/>
morning at 7am, the first time they can see him.<br/>
<br/>
So what does this have to do with toxic in-laws and mothers?  I called my<br/>
mother and asked her if she would watch Zak in the morning so that hubby and<br/>
I can go together and she&#39;d been drinking (again)... She started saying all<br/>
kinds of strange things such as &quot;You need to be careful THEY don&#39;t take your<br/>
children away&quot;... &quot;Whose they?&quot; was my response.... She started going on<br/>
about CPS, Welfare, they were only intersted in the kids and could think I&#39;d<br/>
burned him deliberately.... Of course this was just the joyful news I needed<br/>
to hear when I was already having a hard time with the fact that he was with<br/>
me when he got burned.  She even asked me &quot;where were you&quot;.... I didn&#39;t need<br/>
to justify myself but out of habit did (I thought that one had gone by the<br/>
wayside)... I turned to put a plate in the sink and in 5 seconds his hand<br/>
was on the stove...<br/>
<br/>
My parents not only don&#39;t support homeschooling, they have no clue was<br/>
unschooling is and don&#39;t want to learn anything, read anything or know<br/>
anything about it.  They are unsupportive in the decisions we make for our<br/>
children.  I guess I&#39;d just been sucked in lately to my mother being nice.<br/>
I forget she&#39;s like the Black Widow Spider who will do anything to get you<br/>
into her net and then strike.<br/>
<br/>
As you can imagine I&#39;m feeling a bit overwhelmed tonight and your thoughts<br/>
and prayers for a swift recovery of my adorable Max would be appreciated.<br/>

btw, we&#39;re in the same boat with the toxic inlaws, too. in fact, their<br/>
<br/>
extremely negative (verbal, in front of our child) response to our choice to<br/>
opt<br/>
<br/>
for &quot;this homeschooling bulls**t&quot; (the last in a string of negative<br/>
responses to<br/>
<br/>
just about every parenting choice we&#39;ve made) has caused us to pretty much<br/>
cut<br/>
<br/>
off contact. Jessica Kelly<br/>
