Meghan, I had this terrible urge to pierce something while you were gone!<br/>
 But I distressed my table instead. &lt;g&gt;   I told it it was ugly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL!! Well distressing furniture is definitely a good substitute! I <br/>
do that a lot. I&#39;m working on a headboard right now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
I&#39;d better go now. I&#39;m about to be stabbed by a pirate and I&#39;m <br/>
going to have to die now. Au Revoir.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50006918">Hi Dar:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll get to California eventually (LOL).. Kino is the school that he&#39;s<br/>
been going too.  Like I&#39;ve said it&#39;s wonderful in that it&#39;s an<br/>
Unschooling school so the kids don&#39;t have lessons or &quot;have&quot; to learn<br/>
anything at any particular time, but as Zak pointed out to me<br/>
&quot;Everything I do at Kino, I can do at home and I miss you when I&#39;m away<br/>
from you&quot;.. That was the deciding vote and the fact that it costs $640<br/>
per month.<br/>

What school was Zak at? I thought about Kino for a while, when Rain<br/>
wanted to go to school...<br/>
