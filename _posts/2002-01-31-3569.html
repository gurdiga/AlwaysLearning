<div id="ygrps-yiv-994904383">I had my ears done when I was 16.  I had to wear solid 14K gold or sterling<br/>
silver posts.  Anything else made me itch and ooze.  Now, while nursing, I<br/>
can&#39;t wear anything without oozing.  Fortunately my holes haven&#39;t closed and<br/>
my son is close to weaning (I think...).<br/>

DD chose to have her ears pierced at age 6.  She mentioned it a few times,<br/>
and I kind of stalled looking for a good place to do it (to make sure she<br/>
really wanted it done).  Much to my surprise, DH made an appointment and she<br/>
had them done within a week.  She still loves it and  enjoys changing her<br/>
earrings.  So far she has had no oozing problems (except during the initial<br/>
healing).<br/>
<br/>
SIL (hispanic) had her dd&#39;s done as an infant.  It is a cultural thing for<br/>
her.<br/>
