<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891976137">&lt;SNIP&gt; Julie said: Anyway, just wanted to share with someone who wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Well, he&#39;s 8 for gosh sakes, don&#39;t you think he is behind?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My son will be 9 in a few days and I must confess that on most days we are all very comfortable with our unschooling lifestyle.  I never stress over schoolish issues with my kids, well almost never ;-)  Anyway, we were at the library the other day and I saw a poster inviting kids to sign up to win something Harry Potter so I asked my son if he wanted to put his name in the hat.  I was helping him fill out the slip of paper, which was a brand new experience for him, when I found myself saying something like &quot;we need to work on that&quot; meaning his handwriting and the fact that her forgot and wrote his 9 backwards.  Boy was I ashamed of myself.  <br/>
<br/>
We (my children and I) have lots of little discussions about acceptance and differences and motivations behind prejudices.....including public schooled kids.  I recently told my son that it was okay to &quot;know&quot; things that someone else does not, and it was okay for others to &quot;know&quot; things he does not.  Then I acted like a big ass in the library by letting my old public school demons chastise him for something so unimportant.  Where did that come from?  I fear it may have come from all those inane classes I took when I was being certified as a public school teacher in another lifetime...ACK!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, although I used to think I would never say something like Julie wrote above, now I know that I evidently still have some exorcizing of past demons to do!!  And yes, sometimes (tho&#39; thankfully rarely) I hear myself saying things my mother would have said DOUBLE ACK!!!<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, I sometimes slip into judgemental mother-teacher-nagger-uplifter<br/>
mode myself.<br/>
<br/>
Being ashamed of yourself, instead of your kid, is a big step in the<br/>
right direction.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
