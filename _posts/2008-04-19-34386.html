 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t give parenting advice, but I have had a major problem in the<br/>
past with my son when he was at school (ages 5 to 7) and becoming<br/>
increasingly unhappy with that. Sometimes everything I did seemed to<br/>
antagonise him. It was most disconcerting when my son would suddenly<br/>
become aggressive and sometimes violent toward me &#39;for no apparent<br/>
reason&#39;. In other words, I had no idea what I&#39;d done to trigger it. As<br/>
far as I could tell, I was the epitome of sweetness and light, but, as<br/>
the saying goes, the meaning of the message is how the recipient<br/>
responds to it - while I was sure I was being positive, friendly,<br/>
supportive, and the rest, my son apparently perceived me as The Dad<br/>
From Hell. Presumably because instead of actually helping him get what<br/>
he wanted I was doing what I thought would help but didn&#39;t. Who knows?<br/>
I&#39;m not a mind reader.<br/>
<br/>
In truth, there were other factors involved besides the school<br/>
experience. My son had been in childcare for bits and pieces of his<br/>
toddlerhood (until I quit my job to be at home with him full time when<br/>
he was two and a half), with the result that his life in those early<br/>
years had been quite fragmented at times - he usually didn&#39;t know when<br/>
he would be at home, when he would be elsewhere, and who he would be<br/>
with. We moved house five times from his birth until we bought the<br/>
house we&#39;re living in now when he was five years old, including<br/>
emigrating from England to Australia. <br/>
<br/>
While all that was going on, there were occasional tantrums and acts<br/>
of aggression to accommodate somehow whenever he became frustrated<br/>
with his less than ideal circumstances. One day, when my son was two,<br/>
I had come home from work and I was playing with him, helping him<br/>
build with his Brio, and he deliberately smacked me in the mouth with<br/>
one of the wooden blocks and broke two teeth. And while I&#39;m rolling on<br/>
the floor in pain with little bits of my shattered teeth around me, my<br/>
wife&#39;s saying &quot;What did you do to upset him?&quot; LOL. I still laugh about<br/>
that when I think of it. For somebody who thinks of himself as a<br/>
&#39;successful parent&#39; (which I am), these events are a challenge. <br/>
<br/>
That was an exceptional event though. Mostly the tantrums and acts of<br/>
aggression were of the usual kind for a toddler (if that makes sense).<br/>
When my son started school, however, what had been occasional tantrums<br/>
and outbursts escalated over time into almost chronic rage. After my<br/>
wife and I had decided he would be homeschooled, we made the HUGE<br/>
mistake of agreeing with the school that he would complete the year<br/>
(there were only seven weeks remaining when we made the decision - I<br/>
would have taken him out immediately in retrospect). During those<br/>
&#39;dark and desperate&#39; weeks, I used to pick my son up from the<br/>
classroom and, on the ten minute walk home, he would almost always<br/>
pick a fight with me out of nothing and would either sit down on the<br/>
ground and refuse to budge or I would get punched and kicked and<br/>
occasionally whacked with a conveniently available tree branch. One<br/>
time, he threw a house brick at my head. It&#39;s okay, I ducked. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we got through it. Within weeks of my son leaving school, his<br/>
tantrums and apparently random acts of aggression had vanished like<br/>
morning mist in the sunshine. It took another couple of years for us<br/>
to become as close as I would like to have always been with him - we<br/>
hadn&#39;t exactly got off to a great start with that: we&#39;d spent hardly<br/>
any meaningful time together in the first two and a half years of his<br/>
life because I&#39;d had a &#39;real job&#39; in those days that kept me away from<br/>
home 60 hours a week. <br/>
<br/>
Once my son was out of school, my wife and I were able to give him<br/>
something he&#39;d never really known before - at least to the extent that<br/>
he could trust in it - maximum control over his own life. Once, that<br/>
is, we&#39;d dumped the &#39;school at home&#39; trial that lasted all of two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
When truly helpful circumstances eventuated (not circumstances we only<br/>
thought were helpful), my son became positive and friendly very<br/>
quickly. He was always a genuinely wonderful person. And behaved<br/>
accordingly most of the time. Now there were no hindrances to him<br/>
being wonderful all the time - as he&#39;s continued to be.<br/>
<br/>
What I learned from my own experience:<br/>
<br/>
Set the goal of solving the problem (Don&#39;t, for example, ask yourself<br/>
questions like &quot;What if nothing works?&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Have faith in your ability to find a solution.<br/>
<br/>
Know the answer to these two questions. What do I want? How will I<br/>
know I&#39;ve got it?<br/>
<br/>
Be the change you want to see in the world. <br/>
<br/>
If I can feel compassion for my son and be even more determined to<br/>
create circumstances that will make it easy for him to be happy when<br/>
he&#39;s just thrown a house brick at my head ... well, you get the point<br/>
of what Ghandi said, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
You may have to go upstream to find your solution in this case.<br/>
<br/>
My ten cents worth anyway. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1221571429">Bob, your mail is very special. Thank you for being so honest and so<br/>
transparent. On our parenting journey, we look back and see where we went<br/>
wrong and where we would have made different choices had we known what we<br/>
know now. We look forward, to see how to use what we know now for the<br/>
future. And we live now in the joy of what we have learned. Finally, we<br/>
share what we have learned in an effort to help other parents do things<br/>
better. Your mail achieves all of these purposes. You have a very fortunate<br/>
son...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I particularly appreciated this paragraph: &gt;&gt;&gt; As far as I could tell, I was<br/>
the epitome of sweetness and light, but, as the saying goes, the meaning of<br/>
the message is how the recipient responds to it - while I was sure I was<br/>
being positive, friendly, supportive, and the rest, my son apparently<br/>
perceived me as The Dad From Hell. Presumably because instead of actually<br/>
helping him get what he wanted I was doing what I thought would help but<br/>
didn&#39;t.&lt;&lt;&lt;, and also your comment &gt;&gt;&gt; When truly helpful circumstances<br/>
eventuated (not circumstances we only thought were helpful), my son became<br/>
positive and friendly very quickly.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My daughter works with horses, and I have a Highland pony that I enjoy, and<br/>
it is so interesting to observe how one&#39;s own behaviours, responses and<br/>
attitudes affect the horse. Increasingly we are learning, when things go<br/>
wrong, not to say &#39;what a naughty horse&#39;, but rather to ask - &#39;what did I do<br/>
to set our partnership up for this failure?&#39; Not to say that horses are<br/>
automatisms, with no intelligence of their own; however, because they are<br/>
such body language communicators, they pick up things that we are not aware<br/>
of. We humans can be terribly incongruent - what we think we are is often<br/>
not what we really are. The horses show this up like a mirror, and the<br/>
reflection is not always nice to look at!!! Anyway, I have had some<br/>
interpersonal difficulties with my eldest daughter, and because of what I<br/>
have been learning, it has been so much easier not to blame, not so see her<br/>
as the cause of our problems, but rather to make an honest appraisal of what<br/>
happened and from there to see how to heal our relationship. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I find that in moments of frustration I start asking &quot;why&quot; questions<br/>
which shut down the problem solving process. When I switch over to the<br/>
&quot;how&quot; questions it opens the door to finding solutions.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How can we solve this?&quot;<br/>
&quot;How can everyone get their needs met?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those open the door for me to be more creative rather than obsessing<br/>
about WHY someone is acting a certain way.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s so important in the parent/child relationship to keep the communication lines <br/>
as free from parental baggage as possible.  I&#39;m a horse-person too, and so I really connect <br/>
with your analogy about that what happens is a reflection of the relationship, not the <br/>
&quot;fault&quot; of the other.  If we all kept this in mind, we might be able to better serve all of our <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
When my father left, (I was 16) things hadn&#39;t been good for a long time, and he had <br/>
disconnected himself entirely from the family.  He then blamed all of us for the lack of <br/>
connection.  The day I turned 18 he was able to make me fully responsible for everything <br/>
regarding our relationship.  I know that this is an extreme example, but many people act <br/>
this way--not taking personal responsibility for the state of their relationship with their <br/>
children.  People want to blame genetics, videogames, drugs, peers, etc., for the unwell <br/>
state of their relationships, but I think most of us know that when we really help our <br/>
children to get/do/be what they want, they respond with gratitude and love, and <br/>
connection, just like I do when someone helps me.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>At first I didn&#39;t have anything to respond to this. But after <br/>
reading Bob&#39;s response I could see parallels in my life. Our 4yo son <br/>
seems to be very aggressive toward my husband a lot of the time. He <br/>
has wacked him in the face with a plastic golf club. He sometimes <br/>
punches my husband as hard as he can for no apparent reason. It was <br/>
very bizarre behavior for our 4yo. OTOH, my husband was gone from <br/>
just before he turned 3 until just after he turned 4, an entire year <br/>
of his life without a male role model. It was like my husband came <br/>
back and the testosterone went wild. Our son would never do those <br/>
things with me, although he could have. He still has never done <br/>
anything like that with me. <br/>
<br/>
Our son is now calming down a bit. He doesn&#39;t beat the crap out of <br/>
daddy so much anymore. Daddy has to be very careful not to even <br/>
appear to be aggressive or overpowering in any way. I still haven&#39;t <br/>
figured out what that is all about.<br/>

<br/>
When my son was about nine, we got into watching WWE on the TV for a<br/>
while and used to have mock wrestling matches on the bed in the main<br/>
bedroom. I was Rob van Dam, he was Rey Mysterio. Tons of friendly<br/>
aggression from him on those occasions. It was all great fun and<br/>
neither of us got hurt over the course of dozens of &#39;bouts&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
As I write, I can&#39;t think of the last time my son showed any<br/>
unfriendly aggression towards me. It was that long ago.<br/>
