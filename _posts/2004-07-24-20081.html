<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661826910">I think the words we use are important to ourselves and those around us -<br/>
they set the stage so to speak.  In the emails I have read -  &quot;it&#39;s non<br/>
negotiable&quot; and &quot;that&#39;s not an option&quot;.   Those types of lay down the law<br/>
statements really set others up to feel and act defensively.  It shuts down<br/>
any hope of finding solutions and having open communications.<br/>

I do agree with this in most cases and delivery counts too.  However, in regard to seatbelts, if I am driving the car the only option for anyone is to choose not to go with me if they are not willing to put on the belt.  I have been in several car accidents.  One would have killed me if the belt was not on.  There is no room for negotiating.  It is a simple statement of fact and no solution needs to be found. I will not enable the behavior.  I am an attachment parent and prefer to remain attached to the living.  If someone I love wants to defend their right to risk their lives and be stupid they will need to do that in their own car.<br/>
