<div id="ygrps-yiv-799185011"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;You have a child that is 14. She is going to be a<br/>

they can marry at 16, or even 14, with parental<br/>
permission.  They are older than you think.  I was<br/>
also thinking that I had access to plenty of televised<br/>
sex when I was a pre teen and a young teen, even porn<br/>
as part of a regular cable package, when cable first<br/>
came out and they didn&#39;t have special packages with<br/>
different channels.  But I actually learned the most<br/>
from Jean M. Auel&#39;s Earth&#39;s Children series, which has<br/>
a lot of very detailed sex scenes, particularly in The<br/>
Valley of Horses and the Mammoth Hunters.  That was<br/>
when I was 12.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696902684">Censorship, always a popular topic on unschooling<br/>
lists.  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I had to comment on this:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; as they were getting older. When I felt that they<br/>
&gt;understood that inflicting violence on another<br/>
&gt;person, an animal, or anything else, was not<br/>
&gt;acceptable, <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Joylyn, violence is sometimes necessary. <br/>
There was more than one time growing up when I wished<br/>
I had been given emotional premission, and physical<br/>
preparation, for defending myself.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking as I read this, does this mean you<br/>
don&#39;t eat meat?  Many vegetarians consider being<br/>
cranivorous to be horrible violence against poor<br/>
little animals.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I love what you said about how if we surround<br/>
ourselves with war, what is the benefit of peace? <br/>
Very well spoken truth.  I know you don&#39;t mean games<br/>
and recreative fantasy either, since your family is<br/>
into that, but real historical or current blood and<br/>
guts and tragedy.  <br/>
<br/>
As for movie violence, I am a very sensative person<br/>
and I love to watch movies like the Matrix, Long Kiss<br/>
Goodnight, LOTR, etc.  The violence is overblown and<br/>
fantastic and unreal, or in a fantasy setting that<br/>
equates with being unreal in our modern world.  But<br/>
when we tried to watch The Patriot, I was sobbing 20<br/>
minutes into the movie and could not watch any more.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I do run around completely naked in front of my<br/>
&gt;children, although my husband doesn&#39;t any more.  I<br/>
&gt;think it&#39;s important that our girls see real women&#39;s<br/>
&gt;bodies, not just the air brushed stuff they see in<br/>
&gt;ads. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that is important for my boys too.  I don&#39;t<br/>
try to hide when I am changing my clothes or in the<br/>
shower or something.  I want them to have real<br/>
expectations of what real women look like.  It is<br/>
funny though, because my boys have WAAAAY too much<br/>
testosterone for 7 and 5.  They always say things like<br/>
&quot;heh heh..boobies&quot; even though it&#39;s not a rare and<br/>
wonderful thing for them to see them, well ok, maybe<br/>
not rare.  LOL  My five year old lays on my chest and<br/>
says &quot;I like to lay on your boobs mom, they&#39;re nice.&quot; <br/>
My husband says, &quot;Well, can&#39;t say I blame him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thomas (7) had the funniest conversation with his Dad<br/>
when they were out in the car together, related to me<br/>
later by dh.  He asked how babies get out of a mommy&#39;s<br/>
belly.  His dad gave him some vague answer, and he<br/>
said &quot;Yes, but Dad, How do they get out?  Where do<br/>
they come out?  The belly button?&quot;  So my husband<br/>
explains about the birth canal, since he is obviously<br/>
ready for this information and wanting it.  Thomas<br/>
thinks about this for a while and then says &quot;Dad, I&#39;ve<br/>
looked all over Mommy, and I have not seen anything<br/>
like that.&quot;  So my husband awkwardly explains it&#39;s<br/>
location, near where I go pee.  Thomas laughs and says<br/>
&quot;Comeon dad, quit teasing, I really want to know!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Sugar sometimes not just makes things sweet but<br/>
&gt;changes their taste. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Joylyn I love this!  Did you make it up?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145506846"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Our children decided for themselves when they were<br/>
&gt;uncomfortable with nakedness. The age that happened<br/>
&gt;ran from about 4 to 7, depending on the kid. When<br/>
&gt;they&#39;re uncomfortable with being seen naked, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;usually the time they no longer want to see their<br/>
&gt;parents naked.<br/>
&gt;Tia<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 5 year old spent the last 5 days in a row<br/>
completely naked, except when we went to the store. <br/>
Then he got dressed to go to the store with us (in<br/>
backwards shirt and pants, as usual) and then stripped<br/>
when we got home.  Last night he said he&#39;s a super<br/>
hero called &quot;Naked Guy.&quot;  He&#39;s sleeping naked right<br/>
now.  He&#39;s usually enjoys being naked, but not like<br/>
this.  He obviously needs this right now.  He is also<br/>
obviously really comfortable in his skin.  I don&#39;t<br/>
think he would be as comfortable if he didn&#39;t see on a<br/>
regular basis how comfortable his dad and I are in our<br/>
skin.<br/>

to be naked. I think mainly because it bugs Amanda.<br/>
<br/>
Amanda is VERY easy to annoy. She is the perfectionist and thinks he <br/>
REALLY NEEDS TO OUTGROW THIS PHASE.  LOL I encourge him running <br/>
around naked. <br/>

&gt;of steps leading into sex but left the rest to the imagination. But the 4th<br/>
&gt;one caught me by surprise and had a scene that left nothing to the<br/>
&gt;imagination. (More blatant than Spike and Buffy ;-) Yikes! It&#39;s really more<br/>
&gt;detail than she needs at this stage of her biological development and it<br/>

to herself? I read Mary Stewart&#39;s Merlin trilogy to Lars when he was quite <br/>
young, maybe 8. I found myself skipping the odd paragraph where I could do <br/>
it and have it still make sense. I think I might have even said something <br/>
like, &quot;You probably don&#39;t want to hear this part so I&#39;ll skip it.&quot; If he <br/>
had objected, I guess I would have read those parts.<br/>

Beth read the first couple of Jean Auel&#39;s prehistoric books to Julian, who is <br/>
14.  She told him that she was too shy to read aloud the detailed sex parts, <br/>
but said he was welcome to go back and read them. He didn&#39;t care, and he <br/>
didn&#39;t bother.<br/>

We used to laugh about those scenes in college. They were all these dramatic <br/>
references to Jondalar and his flaming man-root.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s still pretty funny.<br/>

for that reason, but that I thought he would like them. I was kind of <br/>
hoping that would get him interested (he was certainly interested in all <br/>
things sexual at that point) but his reading just wasn&#39;t up to par at that <br/>
time.<br/>
