<div id="ygrps-yiv-414885936">I can&#39;t keep up with this list!!<br/>
Forgive me if I mention something redundant, but I can&#39;t possibly read all <br/>
the e-mails (not even in digest format).<br/>
I just wanted to pop in and say WOW! to Sandra for being the first American <br/>
Bowie fan...I&#39;m so totally impressed. I fell in love with him in 1983, I <br/>
know, I know.....a little late for you &quot;old time&quot; fans. But he was sooooo <br/>
sexy in &quot;Let&#39;s Dance&quot;. YK?<br/>
I bought a bunch of his tapes after that and still adore his music. That and <br/>
his incredible talent for costuming. I loved him in &quot;Labrynth&quot; too.<br/>
Julie, <br/>
I have been doing a lot of searching myself lately. Questioning many, many <br/>
things I formerly took for granted as far as religion goes.<br/>
I love Jesus and consider myself a Christian because of that.<br/>
I do not see him in churches though. I do not see his spirit in most that <br/>
claim Christianity either.<br/>
Most of this matters not a whit to how I choose to live my life, I know what <br/>
has been spoken to my own heart and I just try to follow that.<br/>
I just understand the questioning and the not wanting to just go to church <br/>
because you&#39;re &quot;supposed&quot; to.<br/>
