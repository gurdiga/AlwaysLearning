<div id="ygrps-yiv-1989757844">hi,<br/>
<br/>
I never like to introduce myself until I&#39;ve posted or responded a<br/>
couple times because I don&#39;t know about you, but I&#39;ll never connect<br/>
the name with an intro until I have some reason to want to know who<br/>
someone is because of curiosity. Heh...I guess the unschooling ideas<br/>
seep in everywhere, don&#39;t they?<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m a 31 year old sahm to two: Jacob, who&#39;ll be 8 March 1st and<br/>
Amadea, who is 5. I live in a poly and Pagan household with two men,<br/>
both of whom are wonderful daddies and excellent partners. We also<br/>
live with lots of critter friends. <br/>
<br/>
I have been pretty much unschooling from the start, I had a midwife<br/>
for both births and after finding out my sister was vaccine dammaged,<br/>
did some research and opted out of that. So that got me started really<br/>
thinking and reading about doing things my way and following my heart.<br/>
I think it was easy having broken several molds already by that point.<br/>
<br/>
I was in college myself until a car accident left me disabled, so we<br/>
work around my medical challenges as best we can. Anyway, more mundane<br/>
stuff, we live in Kent, Washington.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious, are there any other Pagans raising Pagan kids on this list?<br/>
<br/>
Merry Meet!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877959605">Well, I guess I would consider us pretty pagan, but I don&#39;t think <br/>
about it that much to tell you the truth.  We live in a very <br/>
conservative Christian community, with a HUGE Christian homeschooling <br/>
group, so I don&#39;t make too much of my beliefs and mainly focus on <br/>
encouraging my children to be open-minded and respectful of everyone&#39;s <br/>
beliefs.  <br/>
<br/>
I have some very funny? stories re. how my children have &#39;interpreted&#39; <br/>
religious information they have picked up -- since they don&#39;t really <br/>
have a biblical context for it they just place into their own <br/>
framework and come up with the darndest things!  Sometimes the &quot;Truth&quot; <br/>
children create is so much more poignant and real that I just want to <br/>
bottle it and sell it as &quot;World Peace Solution.&quot;<br/>
