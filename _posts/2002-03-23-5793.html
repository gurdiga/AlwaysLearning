<div id="ygrps-yiv-961325382">&lt;&lt;Not every unschooling house has to be filled with nonstop <br/>
activity and visitors and travel and so on. People can live great unschooling <br/>
lives that aren&#39;t as wild or exciting as some others. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have phases and waves.   The kids all noticed that the February calendar <br/>
(wall calendar in the kitchen) had two or three things written on every <br/>
single day, and March was totally, clear, white blank.  Even when we turned <br/>
the page, not one single mark.<br/>
<br/>
Putting Kirby&#39;s work schedule (which varies) on there, and karate and Holly&#39;s <br/>
drama class helped.  And now that the month&#39;s nearly over there&#39;s quite a bit <br/>
more, but still  there are five days blank.  I&#39;m sure we did or will do <br/>
things on those days.<br/>
<br/>
Next Tuesday there&#39;s a homeschool skating session (for socialization and <br/>
discount &lt;g&gt;).  Thursday the community center is closed for the school&#39;s <br/>
spring break, and so the homeschoolers are meeting at the aquarium instead.  <br/>
A dollar a head for what is  usually $3.50 to $5.50.  <br/>
<br/>
Those are cheap and easy ways for me to offer something I didn&#39;t have to <br/>
bother to organize.  Marty loves to ice skate and will help younger kids <br/>
generously.  I usually figure that part of it is the most valuable for him.  <br/>
I&#39;ve never mentioned it; it&#39;s secret to me.  But I see him learning how to <br/>
deal with younger beginning skaters, and figure out what they need to know <br/>
and how best to show them or tell them, and learning it&#39;s different for <br/>
different people.<br/>
<br/>
The same skating rink has a roller blade side.  Holly would rather roller <br/>
blade.  The Cordova family, or original unschooling buddy-family, will be <br/>
there too.  I&#39;m pretty excited.  So we&#39;ll all be getting different things out <br/>
of the day.  It&#39;s a 40 minute drive (unusual for Albuquerque) and that will <br/>
deliver unguessed-at opportunities for music  or conversation or to see <br/>
something unexpected.  So it&#39;s &quot;just skating,&quot; but I know it&#39;s not that. It&#39;s <br/>
a day of unmined potential, with old friends and new friends.  It&#39;s a chance <br/>
for newer homeschooling families to spy on Marty and Holly (both &quot;lifers&quot; in <br/>
that group) to see how they are.  Behind my back, my kids have made a lot of <br/>
tentative homeschoolers feel a lot more relaxed about the possibilities.  If <br/>
my kids can be that &quot;civilized&quot; without any school at all, maybe these newer <br/>
people&#39;s angst about units or curriculum just isn&#39;t worth it.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m trying to say, I guess, is that after years of unschooling the days <br/>
look different.  What might look very educational might just be a leisurely <br/>
day in an airconditioned museum with not much longterm effect.  What might <br/>
look like yardwork might be the highlight of the learning- and life-changing <br/>
week.<br/>
