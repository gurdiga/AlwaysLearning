<div id="ygrps-yiv-758620257">So...<br/>
<br/>
If any of you wish you had a way to get news about homeschooling or  <br/>
unschooling (such as momentous legal happenings, or newly published  <br/>
articles or books), maybe bookmark this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschooling.blogspot.com">http://unschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
And if any of you already HAVE some way to get such news, it would be  <br/>
friendly and generous of you to go there and put the name and maybe  <br/>
even a link to that source.  Some people subscribe to lists or online  <br/>
newsletters.  Some go to websites now and again, or subscribe to  <br/>
announcements for blogs.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a favorite homeschooling news source and could share it,  <br/>
that would be very nice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

Here&#39;s the link:<br/>

Might be worth looking into if you don&#39;t already. <br/>
