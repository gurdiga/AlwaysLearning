<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801680375">&lt;&lt;If they were in school, would you begrudge them a classroom full of<br/>
supplies<br/>
and cool stuff? Would it bother you that they didn&#39;t consider what the lab<br/>
equipment cost or the fundraising needed to build that new gym or where the<br/>
teacher was going to store the classroom games? You don&#39;t have to have all<br/>
or any of the stuff on my list. You can get what *does* interest your kids<br/>
(and you!).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is what  I try to tell my dh when he complains that I buy the kids too<br/>
much stuff!  My response is always that they need new and cool stuff around<br/>
because they DON&#39;T go to school!  I get lots of stuff from tag sales, thrift<br/>
stores, e-bay, etc.<br/>
