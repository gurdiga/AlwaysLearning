<div id="ygrps-yiv-509773422">My 10 year old son, Simon, isn&#39;t reading yet. A couple of days ago he <br/>
gathered up all the Asterix and Obelix comic books we have and put them in <br/>
his sleeping bag so that he could read through them with a flashlight. He <br/>
worked through some of the words and looked at the pictures and sang some of <br/>
the words when the Gauls had a moment of drunken revelry. When he was 5 I <br/>
can remember reading books with him and pointing out words in text for him <br/>
to read. When we read Noddy books I&#39;d have him find the words Big Ears as we <br/>
read through. It didn&#39;t make a difference. Even the little dot-to-dots I <br/>
used to do so that he could trace out the letters, it didn&#39;t make a <br/>
difference. His reading is going at his own pace. As is his writing. I don&#39;t <br/>
think there is anything that I could have done to push his reading on. And I <br/>
certainly don&#39;t think that the tricks I was doing when he was 5 did anything <br/>
but make him more reticent to explore reading.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spent some time looking at the literacy statistics to underscore the <br/>
lie that schooling can bring children to reading. Here is a table of <br/>
proficiency across grade levels and years (from 1992 to 2005) that really <br/>
shows how literacy isn&#39;t something that schooling can give your child: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2006/section2/table.asp?tableID=560">http://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/2006/section2/table.asp?tableID=560</a> And the <br/>
interesting thing is that betwen 4th and 12th grade the movement between <br/>
proficiency levels is very slight, and certainly by 8th grade, in school, if <br/>
you aren&#39;t reading, you aren&#39;t going to read. But I bet there are instances <br/>
on this list of people whose children might not have been reading by 13, but <br/>
by not being excluded or shamed or made to feel like a failure, a permanent <br/>
non-reader, they are reading by 15 or 16 or 17.<br/>
<br/>
In my own case relaxing about it made the biggest difference. I can&#39;t make <br/>
Simon read. Having Linnaea read at 6 really demonstrated to me that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t necessarily an environmental issue, its more likely a developmental <br/>
issue. I can&#39;t change his development. I can only support him by reading to <br/>
him, by helping him to live in a world filled with text and words. There are <br/>
things that amaze me about him not reading. He remembers things like none of <br/>
the readers in our family do. He sees things in video games that those of us <br/>
relying on text don&#39;t seem to, or at least that take us a lot longer to get <br/>
to. His story telling is amazing. His narrative structure is very developed. <br/>
He helps me to negotiate a world that isn&#39;t made up of text.<br/>
<br/>
I would relax. I would support your son in his reading. I would help your <br/>
husband to see how successfully he is negotiating the world, and how reading <br/>
will come. I would help him to get through the video games that require <br/>
reading. Simon is amazingly confident in his not reading. He will ask <br/>
friends and adults and his younger sister to read for him without even a <br/>
moments embarrassment. I was woried when Linnaea began to read that it would <br/>
make Simon feel uncomfortable, or stupid. My fears were so misplaced. He is <br/>
incredible.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In this way he learns exactly as everyone else: he&#39;ll figure it out  <br/>
when he&#39;s biologically and developmentally ready to. It&#39;s like trying  <br/>
to teach a 9 mo old to walk. You can try. And at 12 mos when he gets  <br/>
up and walk you can even believe the walking lessons worked. But it&#39;s  <br/>
just biology maturing that made him able.<br/>
<br/>
Teachers can believe they teach kids to read. They&#39;re providing an  <br/>
environment -- not a particularly great one, but it does have books  <br/>
and words. Kids mature and they do learn to read when they&#39;re able  <br/>
and it seems like the teacher caused it. But *lots* of kids because  <br/>
of the pressure to do something that they aren&#39;t ready for decide  <br/>
they hate reading.<br/>
<br/>
Reading happens when it happens, usually between 6 and 12, as long as  <br/>
the experience with the printed word is a pleasant one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Him being upset about it<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Kids can struggle to ride a bike before they&#39;re ready. It *is*  <br/>
frustrating. But then the next summer they get on and in a few  <br/>
minutes are riding fine. It&#39;s amazing how easy development can make  <br/>
something!<br/>
<br/>
But *you* need to believe that it&#39;s development that allows decoding,  <br/>
not lessons. As long as you keep holding onto the idea that there&#39;s  <br/>
some program that will get him reading, he&#39;s going to be even more  <br/>
frustrated.<br/>

It was a hard time. But everything still held true, he wasn&#39;t ready,  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-569269701">-=-I have tried many things, he get easily frustrated.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a funny line on The Simpson&#39;s.  Ned Flander&#39;s parents were  <br/>
beatniks.  They went to a child psychologist or some such, about  <br/>
their little boy Ned.  The dad says something like &quot;We&#39;ve tried  <br/>
nothing, and nothing works!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful ambiguity. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;nothing&quot; can&#39;t work if you&#39;re trying many things.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t work in the presence of many methods and  <br/>
experiments.  It only starts to work at some point after all other  <br/>
methods are abandoned and one begins to trust that the learning can  <br/>
and will happen WHEN the parents stop trying to teach.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. Of course I have talked<br/>
with him about different ways we could go about learning -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are not different ways &quot;we&quot; could go about learning.<br/>
You know how to read, and he will learn to read HIS way, not  <br/>
different ways.<br/>
<br/>
Stop trying to frustrate him, by stop trying to teach him to read.<br/>
<br/>
But on the other hand there are games you could play.  One might be  <br/>
to list something from the video games (the characters, or the areas,  <br/>
or something) and see if he can tell the words apart, like a multiple  <br/>
choice.  If you list (I&#39;m thinking Harvest Moon, which Holly started  <br/>
playing before she could read) things like<br/>
chicken<br/>
horse<br/>
cow<br/>
sheep<br/>
moles<br/>
dog<br/>
cat<br/>
fish<br/>
bird<br/>
goat<br/>
duck<br/>
<br/>
and say &quot;can you see which one is &quot;dog&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need to look at all the letters, just either maybe the  <br/>
beginning or the end (whatever the kid knows, if anything).<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go through the whole list.<br/>
And you might put a picture by each one.<br/>
<br/>
We did have some little cheat sheets for video games, on index cards,  <br/>
with the names of things and a picture of them.  I remember a little  <br/>
list for Treasure Mountain (an old computer game) that had a picture  <br/>
of a tree and a pinecone and such, with the words next to them.<br/>
<br/>
There are other things between &quot;can read&quot; and &quot;can&#39;t read.&quot;  There&#39;s  <br/>
mom reading to the kid non-judgmentally, helping just as you might  <br/>
help a bi-lingual friend who couldn&#39;t read English fluently yet, or a  <br/>
blind friend, or a friend who wasn&#39;t wearing her contacts and just  <br/>
needed something read to her, like a menu.  Skim and read what they  <br/>
need, not every single word.  Paraphrase.  Ask if they need help.<br/>
<br/>
Treating children like adult friends has gotten me through many  <br/>
moments when I was tempted to go with an old &quot;rule&quot; or habit or  <br/>
default action.<br/>

I expected her to read earlier than the boys had, because she was a  <br/>
girl, and statistically/generally, girls read earlier.  Holly wasn&#39;t  <br/>
contributing to those statistics, but that&#39;s okay.  She reads fine now.<br/>

She doesn&#39;t skim well yet.  She&#39;s 15.  She can read top to bottom of  <br/>
anything, just fine, but to glance over a menu quickly is scary for  <br/>
her.  She can read a whole menu, but doesn&#39;t have the &quot;skip this  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest dd, now 13, didn&#39;t start reading well until she was about <br/>
12.  Now she reads great, types faster than me and her spelling is <br/>
awesome!  <br/>
<br/>
When she was really little and we first started homeschooling, I tried <br/>
doing the phonics thing.  That lasted about 2 or 3 days before I <br/>
dropped it.  She never ever got phonics.  The concept evaded her.  It <br/>
was like describing the color &quot;red&quot; to someone who has never been able <br/>
to see.  Now that she can read, she understands phonics a little <br/>
better.  She is a whole word learner and it took her all those years to <br/>
gather enough words in her store of knowledge before she had enough to <br/>
read strings of them together in the form of sentences.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have tried many things, he get easily frustrated. I think he just <br/>
&gt; learns differently than most kids and I do believe he will figure it <br/>
&gt; out. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>From our experience, you are right about that!  If he is getting <br/>
frustrated help him.  Help him not get into situations that frustrate <br/>
him so much.  Read to him, always answer his request to read something <br/>
for him.  Listen to books on tape or cd.  I really can&#39;t stress that <br/>
enough!  Chamille devoured books in that form, so that by the time she <br/>
was reading, she knew those words existed, she knew how sentences and <br/>
ideas strung together.  Her knowledge of grammar is very good, her <br/>
sense of descriptions and ideas is great!  <br/>
<br/>
He too can get upset about it, because he&#39;s friends read or he <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; wishes he could read through his video games.Him being upset about it <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of frustration. Thanks for any suggestions. Lyn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Chamille used to get frustrated too.  What helped her more than <br/>
anything was the fact that book for book she had read more books on <br/>
tape and cd and me reading to her, than most of her school aged peers.  <br/>
Let your son know that reading will come, assure him and help him feel <br/>
whole and perfect just the way he is.  I remember telling Chamille many <br/>
times that she DID know how to read, she just was still in the learning <br/>
process of gathering words.  It helped to point out all the words that <br/>
she could read.<br/>
<br/>
Write him little notes.  I went through the bathroom and made cute <br/>
little signs for everything in there and stuck them to the objects.  <br/>
For a long time she saw those words every time she went into the <br/>
bathroom.  I stickered everything with words, toilet, bathtub, mirror, <br/>
drawer, toothbursh, etc.  I did that because I knew she knew what those <br/>
things were and that she was a whole word learner, gathering words into <br/>
her storage bank.  It helped her gather words faster.  She hardly ever <br/>
asked more than once how to spell or read a word.  Once she knew it, <br/>
she knew it.  <br/>
<br/>
Seriously do EVERYthing in your power to eliminate frustration.  Don&#39;t <br/>
make it frustrating by trying to get him to do something that his brain <br/>
is already trying to do.  Find the way to help him in his own natural <br/>
process.</div>

One thing that helped Holly, though it was very sad, was learning  <br/>
that some of her friends who had claimed (or pretended) to be reading  <br/>
were just bullshitting.<br/>
<br/>
She and another friend both had rats, and they both owned copies of  <br/>
the same book about having pet rats.  When Holly learned to read, she  <br/>
saw that the things the other friend had said were in the book  <br/>
weren&#39;t in there at all.  One was kind of the opposite. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
While I was a little amused, I was also really sad about it, because  <br/>
Holly thought much less of the girls after that.<br/>
<br/>
When &quot;reading ability&quot; is graded or rewarded extrinsically, kids will  <br/>
lie about it (or cheat in other ways).  When reading is wholly and  <br/>
purely for the purpose of getting information off a page, it&#39;s a  <br/>
whole different thing.<br/>

Thanks Jen for that!  In all the years I&#39;ve read these lists, I&#39;ve <br/>
never seen it put quite that way.  That&#39;s what my oldest has been <br/>
doing these last few years.  I wish I&#39;d thought of or heard this <br/>
expression, &quot;gathering words,&quot; years ago.  It would have helped me <br/>
with waiting.  There are so many stories out there of the &#39;overnight <br/>
&quot;late&quot; reader&#39; that, when it&#39;s clear it&#39;s not happening that way, <br/>
it&#39;s easy to get worried.  Sandra, I hope you&#39;ll put this in your <br/>
reading section of your web site.  I think it&#39;s an important idea!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384607102">I have to concur--thanks for this post!  My dd has been a little frustrated on and off that <br/>
she&#39;s not reading yet--it&#39;s not coming at all from us, but she is getting messages from <br/>
other kids she meets who are in school, and from the fact that her best friend (unschooler, <br/>
same age) is starting to read.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night after reading this post I had a conversation with her and put forth the idea that <br/>
she is gathering words and in that vein would she like me to start labeling things around <br/>
the house to help her gather more.  She got really excited about it and immediately came <br/>
up with a game to play where I give her the words on cards and she can take them to <br/>
where they belong in the house.  <br/>
<br/>
I could tell she regained a sense of control and confidence about the process that has <br/>
been lacking.  I think I was contributing to the lack of confidence by being a little stuck <br/>
with my schooled mind.  I didn&#39;t want to &quot;teach,&quot; which is what she was asking for but I <br/>
knew she didn&#39;t really want, but didn&#39;t know what else to do, so I did nothing.  That wasn&#39;t <br/>
right either in this situation, because she was aksing me to be more actively present for <br/>
her.  (She is usually pretty clear about when she wants help and when she doesn&#39;t.)  <br/>
<br/>
This post helped to free up a little creative thought for me and opened a new paradigm for <br/>
her.   I&#39;ve been saying to her that she really is learning to read, as she is reading more and <br/>
more words, but she knows that she isn&#39;t ready to string them all together yet, so in her <br/>
mind she is just not reading.  When I presented the new way of looking at it, I think she <br/>
suddenly saw herself on a continuum that leads to proficient reading, whearas before it <br/>
was an either/or.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Jen.   Joanna<br/>
