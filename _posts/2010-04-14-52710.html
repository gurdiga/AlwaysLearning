<div id="ygrps-yiv-396461401">I have an acquaintance who was unschooled, Kate Cayley, who is Jutta Mason&#39;s<br/>
daughter and she is lovely.  She is also the mom of a two year old.  She<br/>
didn&#39;t read until she was nine.<br/>

<br/>
As you can see she is involved in theatre and she became a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
There is documentary film-maker Astra Taylor, whom I have never met.<br/>

<br/>
The other two adult women(in their thirties) who were unschooled I met were<br/>
articulate mothers who graduated from university.(One had a masters)<br/>
<br/>
I have met unschooling teens at Conferences and they seemed happy,<br/>
passionate, confident and very polite.<br/>
<br/>
You can also see Sandra&#39;s daughter Holly Dodd on YouTube, as well as other<br/>
life-learning teens if you look.<br/>
