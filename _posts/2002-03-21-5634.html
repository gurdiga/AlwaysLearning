<div id="ygrps-yiv-47976205">Let me rephrase what I wrote before about Rosie doing worksheets with her <br/>
friend - I got carried away and didn&#39;t say what I really meant in there at <br/>
all. First, Rosie WANTED to do the worksheets and play school and she was <br/>
totally HAPPY doing it. She was not disturbed in the LEAST by the fact that <br/>
she got all the math problems wrong and all the spelling words wrong except <br/>
one. She gets it that she&#39;s not learning the same stuff at the same time as <br/>
every other kid and that she knows more about some things and they know more <br/>
other things. Also - I misunderstood about the mom grading the problems, the <br/>
kids graded each other - the mom gave them the answers to do it with, I <br/>
guess. Anyway, that wasn&#39;t really relevant - it didn&#39;t bother Rosie to have <br/>
her papers graded, it was part of what they were playing - she was ENJOYING <br/>
it. No problem at all there.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that if you&#39;re unschooling, you have to be aware that your kids <br/>
may get into these situations where they openly demonstrate that they clearly <br/>
don&#39;t know what other kids of their exact age are being taught and it could <br/>
be embarrassing or upsetting - to the kid or to the parents. COULD be!!! <br/>
Wasn&#39;t at all in our case.<br/>
<br/>
The point I was trying to make was unschoolers come to a problem late, but <br/>
with a maturity of thought that school schedule doesn&#39;t allow. When I said <br/>
Rosie can think more clearly than the other girl - I was thinking about the <br/>
opportunity she has to think more clearly about the stuff before she learns <br/>
to &quot;do&quot; it. I didn&#39;t mean she just thinks more clearly, in general, about <br/>
anything and everything. Here is an example of what I was thinking about <br/>
(none too clearly, myself, given how very badly I expressed it):<br/>
<br/>
When my older daughter was about 6 or 7, she had a friend (Mary) who had an <br/>
older brother who was learning his &quot;multiplication facts&quot; in school. He <br/>
apparently practiced, out loud, so much that Mary memorized them too. Much <br/>
was made over this by their teacher - a 1st grader knowing all her <br/>
multiplication facts - very exciting.<br/>
<br/>
A few years later, I was running a little &quot;math club&quot; for some 4th graders <br/>
and Mary was part of it. One day I heard one of the other girls explaining to <br/>
Mary that multiplication was really just a shortcut for doing repeated <br/>
addition. This was clearly a new concept to Mary -- she&#39;d learned to DO <br/>
multiplication so young that she hadn&#39;t been able to really think clearly <br/>
about it at that time and, since then, she&#39;d just done it without giving it <br/>
any thought and had, apparently, never realized that multiplication was <br/>
really not a whole &quot;new&quot; operation, but just another way to do addition. <br/>
<br/>
Contrast that to how an unschooled child I know learned multiplication. She <br/>
added and added, she would add 8+8+8+8+8+8+8 for example, two numbers at a <br/>
time. One day she announced, &quot;Every time I want to add up seven eights, it is <br/>
always going to be 56 so I can just say that seven eights is fifty-six and <br/>
not have to do all that adding. Mom answered: &quot;Yep. And if you want, you can <br/>
just do the same thing for lots of numbers, like four fives or three nines or <br/>
whatever you want.&quot; &quot;WOW&quot; says the child - that is very cool. Mom: &quot;I can <br/>
show you how to make a table so you can do it for all the numbers from 1 to <br/>
10 or from 1 to 12 or whatever you want.&quot; So they did that and the child <br/>
memorized the multiplication facts because she was THRILLEd with the concept <br/>
of being able to do addition so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is a simple example, most people (but not all, by any means), come <br/>
to realize that multiplication is really repeated addition, pretty quickly. <br/>
<br/>
However, take more difficult concepts and apply the same approach. How many <br/>
adults can quickly and easily explain why dividing one fraction by another <br/>
gives an answer that is BIGGER, not smaller. Why is 1/2 divided by 1/4 equal <br/>
to 2? Most adults will say because you get it by inverting and multiplying so <br/>
1/2 divided by 1/4 becomes 1/2 times 4/1 which is 4/2 which is 2. BUT that is <br/>
just a technique to DO it, not an explanation of the underlying concept. What <br/>
are you really doing when you divide one fraction by another? <br/>
<br/>
If you teach a child: &quot;To divide one fraction by another you invert and <br/>
multiply,&quot; and make them practice doing it over and over, then that may very <br/>
likely be as clear as their thinking ever gets about that. But if you wait <br/>
until it comes up in some interesting relevant context where they really need <br/>
to or want to divide one fraction by another and take THAT opportunity to <br/>
investigate and understand it - then the child will be able to think about it <br/>
more clearly. <br/>
<br/>
The time that some kids spend doing worksheets will be time that unschooled <br/>
kids spend doing other things. The other things are not likely to be things <br/>
that would show up in testing, for example, for kids that age. As I said, 5th <br/>
graders are not getting tested on world geography, for example. This is a <br/>
choice people make - if they choose to do &quot;school&quot; curriculum stuff - either <br/>
a little or a lot - then I support to the maximum their &quot;right&quot; to do it and, <br/>
heck, I&#39;ll even admit that could be the best choice for their family and <br/>
maybe I&#39;m making a terrible mistake not doing it too. I&#39;m not omniscient and <br/>
can&#39;t predict the future. However, IF someone is going to unschool - then <br/>
their kids get to learn things on their own timetable and I really believe <br/>
that one of the huge benefits is that, when they DO learn things, they do it <br/>
because of their own choice/interest and that is conducive to more clear <br/>
thinking, more focus, more in-depth understanding, of what they are learning.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that makes more sense. Rosie&#39;s friend is a great kid and she and her <br/>
family are great friends of ours and I certainly didn&#39;t mean to say that she <br/>
isn&#39;t just wonderfully bright and intelligent. Her family is more of an <br/>
eclectic homeschooling family, not radical unschoolers like us, and they <br/>
spend plenty of time following their children&#39;s interests and supporting <br/>
those interests.  I&#39;m just really glad that they&#39;re homeschooling and have <br/>
found a way to do it that works well for them.<br/>
<br/>
My point was that radical unschoolers ought to be aware that they are <br/>
&quot;trading off&quot; having their kids know stuff at certain ages at least partly <br/>
because we think that they&#39;ll be able to &quot;get it&quot; better, if we let them wait <br/>
until they are ready and wanting to learn it (whatever it is). Of course, <br/>
some of it they&#39;ll never get to - that&#39;s another reality. <br/>
<br/>
I worry about parents who want to radically unschool and, at the SAME time, <br/>
satisfy spouses or friends or relatives that their kids really are learning <br/>
just fine. It might not really seem &quot;just fine&quot; to them if the child doesn&#39;t <br/>
learn long division until she&#39;s 13 instead of when it is taught in schools at <br/>
about 9 years old. So - you sort of need to be clear in your own heads about <br/>
whether or not that kind of delay is okay with you and whether you feel <br/>
confident about the benefits of letting things &quot;wait&quot; like that. I sort of <br/>
see that as the purpose of this list, really, to help each other understand <br/>
the benefits of it, especially for people who get the &quot;disadvantages&quot; flung <br/>
at them by concerned spouses and others. They need to know that there are <br/>
real reasons why some of us think that it is better to not teach something <br/>
just because it is &quot;time&quot; according to schools.<br/>

I had to figure out how to multiply fractions for some costumes I was <br/>
making for my kids play, and I couldn&#39;t remember what to do. We were <br/>
at a rehearsal, so I called this 13 yo kid over and asked him if he <br/>
knew how to do it, and though he said he worked on that in school, he <br/>
couldn&#39;t remember either. <br/>
So I sat there and really though about it.  I used my brain and <br/>
mentally put together the fractions into  wholes and saw how many <br/>
wholes I had and figured out how much material I needed. THEN I <br/>
figured out/remembered the formula.  It was strangely empowering.<br/>

until they are ready and wanting to learn it (whatever it is).  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If people really care about keeping their kids &quot;caught up&quot; with school, the <br/>
best thing is to send them to school.  (Most people forget or never <br/>
understood, though, that at least half the kids in school are not caught up <br/>
with school, but still....)<br/>
<br/>
I know for a fact that some in-person friends of mine think I&#39;m lazy which is <br/>
why my kids learn to read late.  They don&#39;t see at all the MANY things my <br/>
kids know about that their kids have never even heard of or considered.  And <br/>
I hear from my kids sometimes, their surprise that other kids their age or <br/>
older don&#39;t know ANYTHING about ___ (Thailand / chain mail / polar bears / <br/>
chess / whatever it might have been that came up in conversation or play and <br/>
the other kids said &quot;What?&quot; about).<br/>
<br/>
Holly does not read fluently.  But in the past few days we have had <br/>
conversations about the history of England *because* she asked about <br/>
spellings.  Why two words that sounded the same looked so different.  And <br/>
she&#39;s totally onto the fact that words from Greek will use &quot;ch&quot; to sound like <br/>
&quot;k&quot; and &quot;ph&quot; to do &quot;f.&quot;  So if she wants to spell something I can say &quot;It&#39;s <br/>
Greek,&quot; and she says, &quot;So &#39;ch,&#39; like &#39;Christ&#39;?&quot; or something.  <br/>
<br/>
How many first graders learning to spell by writing each word ten times in <br/>
preparation for a spelling test on Friday are going to wonder about such <br/>
things, or care?  How many teachers of first graders are going to explain <br/>
past &quot;just memorize it&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
One of the things was Holly asking me to spell &quot;please,&quot; and it being too <br/>
long for her to remember two rooms away.  So I wrote it down.  She said six <br/>
letters for one syllable was too much.  I told her &quot;thought&quot; was worse.  <br/>
<br/>
We talked about ski and skate later in the car, being from Norse.  That came <br/>
from discussing onomatopoeia. (I had to look up the spelling, and won&#39;t even <br/>
THINK of confusing Holly with THAT much Greek.)<br/>
<br/>
Onomatopoeia came from a discussion with Marty the day before about &quot;Whoosh&quot; <br/>
sounding like &quot;whoosh&quot; and &quot;pop...&quot; and I said &quot;There&#39;s a word for words that <br/>
sound like the thing they name.&quot;  So we discussed that &quot;quack&quot; and &quot;bow wow&quot; <br/>
and &quot;meow&quot; which we think of as copying that animal&#39;s sound aren&#39;t the same <br/>
in all languages.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of language discussion for 24 hours for someone who can&#39;t even <br/>
read.  <br/>
<br/>
SO I could easily say that in and around spelling and language, Holly <br/>
understands much more than the kids her age who learned to read &quot;by the <br/>
book,&quot; and on schedule.  When they&#39;re fifteen those kids might also have <br/>
picked up a lot of linguistic history and terminology and there will be no <br/>
difference.  But at the moment, Holly is coming at the whole reading and <br/>
spelling thing with an analytical viewpoint most beginners don&#39;t have at all.<br/>
<br/>
I like it.  Her learning is not like the model teachers believe is necessary.<br/>

&gt; making for my kids play, and I couldn&#39;t remember what to do. We were <br/>
&gt; at a rehearsal, so I called this 13 yo kid over and asked him if he <br/>
&gt; knew how to do it, and though he said he worked on that in school, he <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t remember either. <br/>
&gt;  I used my brain and <br/>
&gt;  wholes and saw how many <br/>
&gt; wholes I had and figured out how much material I needed. THEN I <br/>
&gt;  It was strangely empowering.<br/>

&gt;&gt; Let me rephrase what I wrote before about Rosie doing worksheets <br/>
&gt; with her <br/>
&gt;&gt; friend - I got carried away and didn&#39;t say what I really meant in <br/>
&gt; there at <br/>
&gt;&gt; all. First, Rosie WANTED to do the worksheets and play school and <br/>
&gt; she was <br/>
&gt;&gt; totally HAPPY doing it. She was not disturbed in the LEAST by the <br/>
&gt; fact that <br/>
&gt;&gt; she got all the math problems wrong and all the spelling words <br/>
&gt; wrong except <br/>
&gt;&gt; one. She gets it that she&#39;s not learning the same stuff at the same <br/>
&gt; time as <br/>
&gt;&gt; every other kid and that she knows more about some things and they <br/>
&gt; know more <br/>
&gt;&gt; other things. Also - I misunderstood about the mom grading the <br/>
&gt; problems, the <br/>
&gt;&gt; kids graded each other - the mom gave them the answers to do it <br/>
&gt; with, I <br/>
&gt;&gt; guess. Anyway, that wasn&#39;t really relevant - it didn&#39;t bother Rosie <br/>
&gt; to have <br/>
&gt;&gt; her papers graded, it was part of what they were playing - she was <br/>
&gt; ENJOYING <br/>
&gt;&gt; it. No problem at all there.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; My point was that if you&#39;re unschooling, you have to be aware that <br/>
&gt; your kids <br/>
&gt;&gt; may get into these situations where they openly demonstrate that <br/>
&gt; they clearly <br/>
&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know what other kids of their exact age are being taught and <br/>
&gt; it could <br/>
&gt;&gt; be embarrassing or upsetting - to the kid or to the parents. COULD <br/>
&gt; be!!! <br/>
&gt;&gt; Wasn&#39;t at all in our case.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The point I was trying to make was unschoolers come to a problem <br/>
&gt; late, but <br/>
&gt;&gt; with a maturity of thought that school schedule doesn&#39;t allow. When <br/>
&gt; I said <br/>
&gt;&gt; Rosie can think more clearly than the other girl - I was thinking <br/>
&gt; about the <br/>
&gt;&gt; opportunity she has to think more clearly about the stuff before <br/>
&gt; she learns <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; it. I didn&#39;t mean she just thinks more clearly, in general, <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt;&gt; anything and everything. Here is an example of what I was thinking <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt;&gt; (none too clearly, myself, given how very badly I expressed it):<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; When my older daughter was about 6 or 7, she had a friend (Mary) <br/>
&gt; who had an <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; in <br/>
&gt; school. He <br/>
&gt;&gt; apparently practiced, out loud, so much that Mary memorized them <br/>
&gt; too. Much <br/>
&gt;&gt; was made over this by their teacher - a 1st grader knowing all her <br/>
&gt;&gt; multiplication facts - very exciting.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; for some 4th <br/>
&gt; graders <br/>
&gt;&gt; and Mary was part of it. One day I heard one of the other girls <br/>
&gt; explaining to <br/>
&gt;&gt; Mary that multiplication was really just a shortcut for doing <br/>
&gt; repeated <br/>
&gt;&gt; addition. This was clearly a new concept to Mary -- she&#39;d learned <br/>
&gt; to DO <br/>
&gt;&gt; multiplication so young that she hadn&#39;t been able to really think <br/>
&gt; clearly <br/>
&gt;&gt; about it at that time and, since then, she&#39;d just done it without <br/>
&gt; giving it <br/>
&gt;&gt; any thought and had, apparently, never realized that multiplication <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; operation, but just another way to do <br/>
&gt; addition. <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Contrast that to how an unschooled child I know learned <br/>
&gt; multiplication. She <br/>
&gt;&gt; added and added, she would add 8+8+8+8+8+8+8 for example, two <br/>
&gt; numbers at a <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Every time I want to add up seven <br/>
&gt; eights, it is <br/>
&gt;&gt; always going to be 56 so I can just say that seven eights is fifty-<br/>
&gt; six and <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;Yep. And if you <br/>
&gt; want, you can <br/>
&gt;&gt; just do the same thing for lots of numbers, like four fives or <br/>
&gt; three nines or <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot;&quot; says the child - that is very cool. <br/>
&gt;&quot;I can <br/>
&gt;&gt; show you how to make a table so you can do it for all the numbers <br/>
&gt; from 1 to <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot; So they did that and the <br/>
&gt; child <br/>
&gt;&gt; memorized the multiplication facts because she was THRILLEd with <br/>
&gt; the concept <br/>
&gt;&gt; of being able to do addition so quickly.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Now, this is a simple example, most people (but not all, by any <br/>
&gt; means), come <br/>
&gt;&gt; to realize that multiplication is really repeated addition, pretty <br/>
&gt; quickly. <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; However, take more difficult concepts and apply the same approach. <br/>
&gt; How many <br/>
&gt;&gt; adults can quickly and easily explain why dividing one fraction by <br/>
&gt; another <br/>
&gt;&gt; gives an answer that is BIGGER, not smaller. Why is 1/2 divided by <br/>
&gt; 1/4 equal <br/>
&gt;&gt; to 2? Most adults will say because you get it by inverting and <br/>
&gt; multiplying so <br/>
&gt;&gt; 1/2 divided by 1/4 becomes 1/2 times 4/1 which is 4/2 which is 2. <br/>
&gt; BUT that is <br/>
&gt;&gt; just a technique to DO it, not an explanation of the underlying <br/>
&gt; concept. What <br/>
&gt;&gt; are you really doing when you divide one fraction by another? <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;To divide one fraction by another you invert <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot; and make them practice doing it over and over, then that <br/>
&gt; may very <br/>
&gt;&gt; likely be as clear as their thinking ever gets about that. But if <br/>
&gt; you wait <br/>
&gt;&gt; until it comes up in some interesting relevant context where they <br/>
&gt; really need <br/>
&gt;&gt; to or want to divide one fraction by another and take THAT <br/>
&gt; opportunity to <br/>
&gt;&gt; investigate and understand it - then the child will be able to <br/>
&gt; think about it <br/>
&gt;&gt; more clearly. <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; The time that some kids spend doing worksheets will be time that <br/>
&gt; unschooled <br/>
&gt;&gt; kids spend doing other things. The other things are not likely to <br/>
&gt; be things <br/>
&gt;&gt; that would show up in testing, for example, for kids that age. As I <br/>
&gt; said, 5th <br/>
&gt;&gt; graders are not getting tested on world geography, for example. <br/>
&gt; This is a <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; curriculum <br/>
&gt; stuff - either <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; to <br/>
&gt; do it and, <br/>
&gt;&gt; heck, I&#39;ll even admit that could be the best choice for their <br/>
&gt; family and <br/>
&gt;&gt; maybe I&#39;m making a terrible mistake not doing it too. I&#39;m not <br/>
&gt; omniscient and <br/>
&gt;&gt; can&#39;t predict the future. However, IF someone is going to unschool -<br/>
&gt;  then <br/>
&gt;&gt; their kids get to learn things on their own timetable and I really <br/>
&gt; believe <br/>
&gt;&gt; that one of the huge benefits is that, when they DO learn things, <br/>
&gt; they do it <br/>
&gt;&gt; because of their own choice/interest and that is conducive to more <br/>
&gt; clear <br/>
&gt;&gt; thinking, more focus, more in-depth understanding, of what they are <br/>
&gt; learning.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I hope that makes more sense. Rosie&#39;s friend is a great kid and she <br/>
&gt; and her <br/>
&gt;&gt; family are great friends of ours and I certainly didn&#39;t mean to say <br/>
&gt; that she <br/>
&gt;&gt; isn&#39;t just wonderfully bright and intelligent. Her family is more <br/>
&gt; of an <br/>
&gt;&gt; eclectic homeschooling family, not radical unschoolers like us, and <br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt;&gt; spend plenty of time following their children&#39;s interests and <br/>
&gt; supporting <br/>
&gt;&gt;  I&#39;m just really glad that they&#39;re homeschooling <br/>
&gt; and have <br/>
&gt;&gt; found a way to do it that works well for them.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; My point was that radical unschoolers ought to be aware that they <br/>
&gt; are <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; having their kids know stuff at certain ages at least <br/>
&gt; partly <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; better, if we let <br/>
&gt; them wait <br/>
&gt;&gt; until they are ready and wanting to learn it (whatever it is). Of <br/>
&gt; course, <br/>
&gt;&gt; some of it they&#39;ll never get to - that&#39;s another reality. <br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I worry about parents who want to radically unschool and, at the <br/>
&gt; SAME time, <br/>
&gt;&gt; satisfy spouses or friends or relatives that their kids really are <br/>
&gt; learning <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; to them if the <br/>
&gt; child doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt; learn long division until she&#39;s 13 instead of when it is taught in <br/>
&gt; schools at <br/>
&gt;&gt; about 9 years old. So - you sort of need to be clear in your own <br/>
&gt; heads about <br/>
&gt;&gt; whether or not that kind of delay is okay with you and whether you <br/>
&gt; feel <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; like that. I <br/>
&gt; sort of <br/>
&gt;&gt; see that as the purpose of this list, really, to help each other <br/>
&gt; understand <br/>
&gt;&gt; the benefits of it, especially for people who get <br/>
&gt;&quot;&quot; flung <br/>
&gt;&gt; at them by concerned spouses and others. They need to know that <br/>
&gt; there are <br/>
&gt;&gt; real reasons why some of us think that it is better to not teach <br/>
&gt; something <br/>
&gt;&gt;&quot;&quot; according to schools.<br/>

When would a child learn long division naturally in real life? Personally, I <br/>
have always just used a calculator the few times it has come up in my life. <br/>
Maybe I&#39;m not seeing all the times I&#39;ve really been using it without <br/>
realizing. I *am* confident that Conor could learn long division if he <br/>
wanted/needed to. I&#39;m just not able to picture a scenario where it would <br/>
come up naturally.<br/>
<br/>
What am I missing?<br/>

division &lt;g&gt;. I never can...<br/>
<br/>
I used long division to figure our gas mileage on the drive out here. It<br/>
wasn&#39;t crucial to know the exact answer, so I guess I could have<br/>
estimated, but it was something to do while driving, so I didn&#39;t. It was<br/>
important to at least have a ballpark, so I wouldn&#39;t end up out of gas<br/>
somewhere where the prices were really high, or somewhere with no gas<br/>
stations at all. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess I&#39;m not sure what &quot;naturally&quot; means to you. I don&#39;t think that <br/>
they&#39;re likely to just pick it up unless someone takes the time to explain it <br/>
to them and help them do it a little - so it won&#39;t be naturally in that <br/>
sense. It isn&#39;t any different than learning to ride a bike, though. They see <br/>
a reason to do it (that seems natural, to me, but if it doesn&#39;t to you, then <br/>
it could be this step is the stumbling block), they see other people doing <br/>
it, they decide they want to try it, they might try it on their own based on <br/>
what they&#39;ve seen other people doing and that might work or it might not, <br/>
they may ask for help, they may flounder a bit and someone may step in and <br/>
offer help, or someone might just step in early in this whole process and <br/>
say, &quot;Do you want me to help you learn that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They can learn multiplication when they find they need to add the same number <br/>
over and over... 8+8+8+8+8 etc. I mean - they can just use a calculator for <br/>
that, too -- nothing wrong with that. But even punching in 8+8+8+8+8+8 etc <br/>
into a calculator is a pain - you can forget how many eights you already <br/>
punched in or you can accidentally hit the wrong key and have to start all <br/>
the way over, etc. Teaching multiplication BEFORE a kid has experienced any <br/>
sort of frustration with repeated addition is sort of silly since the kid <br/>
won&#39;t appreciate why multiplication is useful and it&#39;ll just seem like <br/>
another operation to learn just for its own sake.<br/>
<br/>
So - they can learn division, too, the same way. When they find they are <br/>
doing repeated subtraction. When Roxana wanted to go to New York City to see <br/>
Cats on Broadway, she asked me how far it was and how far we could drive in a <br/>
day - she wanted to figure out how many days it would take to drive there and <br/>
back. So she started with 3,000 and started subtracting 350 miles, over and <br/>
over, to see how many times she&#39;d have to subtract it to cover all 3,000 <br/>
miles. She made a mistake somewhere and realized she needed to start ALL over <br/>
and she groaned aloud. I was walking by and I said, &quot;I can show you a <br/>
shortcut way to do that.&quot; She wanted to learn, so I should her some simple <br/>
division like 6 divided by 3 and then 60 divided by 3 and then 69 divided by <br/>
3 and then 69 divided by 23 and so on until she could do 3,000 divided by <br/>
350. It took about 20 minutes or so. She was THRILLED and even asked for more <br/>
problems to practice on. THEN I told her, &quot;This is long division&quot; and she <br/>
said, &quot;I can&#39;t believe it - why do people say that they hate it, this is so <br/>
convenient.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how you can MAKE such a situation happen in your home - how you <br/>
can make it come up naturally like that. It has to do with the parent being <br/>
aware of the kids&#39; interests and focus and stuff like that. In some ways, <br/>
this is really hard work - it doesn&#39;t seem like it to those of us who just <br/>
sort of do it naturally, but I know that to my mom and my sisters it looks <br/>
like hard work for me to always be thinking things like, &quot;Oh, I wonder if <br/>
that would be something Roxana (or Rosie or Roya) would be interested in - <br/>
and remembering to introduce her to it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I think our society is in a strange sort of place - we have so much <br/>
opportunity - such enriched environments - that we can just pass on formal <br/>
schooling and live in our stimulating and wonderful environments with <br/>
attentive and doting parents who focus on supporting their own kids&#39; learning <br/>
and our kids can do ANYTHING with it.  In the past or in other places, kids <br/>
did the same thing - learned by hangin&#39; out with the important adults in <br/>
their lives - but the expectations were that they would end up DOING mostly <br/>
what the adults in their lives did. Our expectations are so different - we <br/>
expect our kids to find their own way, not follow in our footsteps, and we <br/>
expect and they expect that they&#39;ll find stimulating, fulfilling, work that <br/>
makes them truly happy, not just develop skills so that they can be <br/>
productive members of society and support themselves and maybe their own <br/>
family. It is pretty amazing to live in a time and place where we have the <br/>
luxury to do this. And I can see why it is scary and seems way too risky to <br/>
lots of people.<br/>
