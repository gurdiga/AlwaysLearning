<div id="ygrps-yiv-1398281754">Cindy I think it&#39;s called &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot;...  I went to yahoo and typed<br/>
in &quot;children&#39;s videos&quot; and then typed in Castle in the Sky... You can buy<br/>
it.  I think it was $9.99.  I checked e-bay as well (nothing) and then<br/>
checked yahoo&#39;s auction site and found it there too... Just trying to stop<br/>
spending at the moment, otherwise it&#39;s the next movie on the list.<br/>

Has anyone found Castle in the Air? That&#39;s the anime video in the<br/>
<br/>
commercials before the Kiki video starts. My kids have asked for it<br/>
<br/>
and I can&#39;t find it.<br/>
<br/>
Alex loves that video. He acts it out with various toys as the blimp,<br/>
<br/>
the clock tower, Tombo and the police car. He made a Lego clocktower<br/>
<br/>
yesterday. I&#39;m making him a quilt with his favorite vehicles on it.<br/>
<br/>
It has to have a blimp and a clocktower! If you ask a 4 year old for<br/>
<br/>
design input, expect challenges!&lt;g&gt;<br/>

undoubtedly been a great boon to video pirates since it looks just like a<br/>
legitimate purchase. There are a handful of &quot;Castle in the Sky&quot; videos on<br/>
eBay now, mostly from the same guy in Chicago.<br/>
<br/>
I inadvvertenly bought a pirated copy of a Japanese kids&#39; show through eBay.<br/>
The copy, on DVD no less, is good, but the subtitling is, um,<br/>
unconventional. I don&#39;t know if the translator had a sick sense of humor or<br/>
if he learned English in back alleys but it&#39;s peppered with swear words.<br/>
It&#39;s actually pretty amusing. ;-) One of the milder examples is the<br/>
translation of one of the episode titles into &quot;Kiss Ass Lipstick&quot;. It&#39;s<br/>
about magical lipstick that makes the wearer say nice things to whoever<br/>
(whomever?) they&#39;re talking to. So it&#39;s an accurate translation. Just a bit<br/>
unconventional for kids. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Another Hayao (not Hiyao that I think I typed before) Miyazaki film that I<br/>
like and is actually legitimately available is Castle of Cagliostro<br/>
(pronounced cally-oh-stroh). It&#39;s not the same gentle quality of Kiki and<br/>
Totoro (though you can see elements of it). There&#39;s lots that would normally<br/>
make me uncomfortable in a kids&#39; movie (smoking, drinking, swearing,<br/>
leering) but I find myself smiling all the way through it and Kathryn (10)<br/>
loves it too. It&#39;s a It Takes a Thief/James Bond theme. It&#39;s funny and goofy<br/>
and sweet -- despite the fact that things get blown up on occasion. ;-)<br/>

There are also manga (graphic novels) by him though, except for Nausicaa<br/>
(which is beautiful but a bit too complex visually and plotwise for my<br/>
daughter), they&#39;re out of print.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard about Panda! Go, Panda! which Miyazaki also worked on. There&#39;s<br/>
some great reviews at Amazon. Someone mentioned &quot;These two movies [there are<br/>
2 stories on the DVD] are considered by many to be prototypes of Miyazake&#39;s<br/>
My Neighbor Totoro due to the similar character designs and child-friendly<br/>
nature throughout the films,&quot; though other reviews suggest it doesn&#39;t have<br/>
the depth that make Totoro also enjoyable for adults.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We were loaned a new South Park video.  Recent episodes from TV.  They were <br/>
REALLY really shocking even for me. &lt;g&gt;  Sex education.  EEEEEK!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure after the initial revulsion is gone I&#39;ll see it as I see some of the <br/>
more benign ones.  It&#39;s not that it&#39;s not really funny, it&#39;s that it&#39;s a <br/>
little close to the bone.  For real.<br/>
