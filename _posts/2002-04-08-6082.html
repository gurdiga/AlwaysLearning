I haven&#39;t thought out the details but maybe we could put our heads <br/>

Maybe someone can find us an already-established video library for public <br/>
borrowing.   The mailing of videos isn&#39;t easy--usually involving going to the <br/>
post office.  And the cost of them means if one is lost the owner will be <br/>
grumpy. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d much prefer not to start anything that will produce something to fight or <br/>
complain about.<br/>
