&lt;&lt;   Plus, she&#39;s a triathlete (at almost <br/>
 42!)  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, she&#39;s young still for a triathlete!! The oldest competitor at the Santa <br/>
Rosa Island Triathlon last year was EIGHTY!! There was a large group of 50 <br/>
somethings and 60 somethings, and then a few 70&#39;s, but eighty? I thought that <br/>
was really cool.<br/>
Hope she heals well and gets back to training!<br/>

people--simple and complicated.....The simple ones are contented.  The <br/>
complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ah, she&#39;s young still for a triathlete!! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We think she&#39;s absolutely crazy, but she&#39;s happy.  She did the iron man in <br/>
Hawaii a few years back, but shattered her collar bone in a bike accident the <br/>
following year while preparing for some race in New Zealand for the <br/>
millennium.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s dedicated her life to her sport, so every break and pain is difficult <br/>
for her.  And she&#39;s been unsuccessful in having children, even after I tried <br/>
to be a surrogate for her this fall.  That&#39;s another source of pain for her.  <br/>
So, complaining about my ankle (which seems to be my favorite sport) is <br/>
ridiculous in comparison.<br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;s aspiring to be a 70 year old triathlete!  I admire her and you <br/>
for your training regimens...<br/>
