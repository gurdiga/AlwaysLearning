<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056435524">&lt;&lt;how much thyme honey did you use&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Actually, we never took it to &quot;ward off&quot; a cold.  I simply used it a lot in<br/>
cooking.  Throw some in a soup, the bean pot, stew.  Slather it on toast.<br/>
That kind of thing.  No colds was just a benefit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1802231305">well, as i said, our honey isn&#39;t even done yet, but i started dipping into the<br/>
pot and spooning it to our son, who&#39;s colds usually last for at least a week,<br/>
and he&#39;s better already this morning, after only one day.  (cold cure or no,<br/>
it&#39;s sure delicious.)<br/>

that our children and adults can go to and learn about the<br/>
oil and gas industry.&quot;<br/>
