<div id="ygrps-yiv-191120751">On a state list in a state quite south of where I am today (I&#39;m in New Jersey) and a ways east of where I live (I live in New Mexico), someone badmouthed teens.  Someone else responded with a defense and some discussion and examples.  I wasn&#39;t involved in that part, because I&#39;ve been really busy and behind on e-mail.<br/>
<br/>
I want to put these out, though, for anyone who was aware of or involved in that:<br/>

<br/>
And one more thing.  Somewhere in the U.S., not quite exactly that part of the country but closeish (compared to New Mexico, anyway), a mother shot and killed her two teens a couple of weeks ago, because they talked back to her too much.    This is a comment from someone who knew the mom:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;She complained about her kids, especially Calyx, but not any more than any other mother does.&quot;<br/>
(quoting the family friend of a mom who shot her two teens for talking back to her, large print, page 74, February 14, 2011 People magazine)<br/>
<br/>
If they thought all mothers complained that badly about their teens, and if one of those mothers shot hers dead, I think every other mother should STOP speaking so horribly about her teens.  And I&#39;m glad to be among a great number of mothers who have found that it&#39;s possible to create and maintain an environment in which their teens don&#39;t need to be complained about.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088420668">This is an issue I&#39;ve been struggling with recently.  Even among my friends, I&#39;m lately hearing more complaints and stereotypes about teenagers.  That they&#39;re bad drivers, or moody, or don&#39;t stick to things they don&#39;t enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
I find myself biting my tongue a lot, because these ideas are so deeply ingrained in our culture, and in these particular people, that I don&#39;t have any reason to believe my words would persuade anyone to a different perspective. It just seems not worth the energy and words expended to explain my position.  And if that&#39;s really how others feel about their kids and mine, I find myself feeling unsafe expressing how I feel.  I don&#39;t want to offer stories from our life, only to have them picked apart and argued, so I say nothing.  All while making note of which conversation topics are no longer safe for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I do speak up and disagree when our kids are nearby, if only to validate for the kids something they may be thinking, or offer a perspective they don&#39;t often (if ever) hear. Probably, in a few weeks when I&#39;m feeling more assertive (February is typically a survival mode time for me) I&#39;ll begin to speak up and not care who feels a need to argue with me.  <br/>
<br/>
The story about the Mom who killed her teens for being mouthy is just awful.  It&#39;s scary to think that other people are saying she didn&#39;t complain about her kids any more than others Moms they know.  <br/>

<br/>
I always speak up!  Sometimes I think I should keep my mouth shut.  When I think <br/>
I&#39;ve said too much.... later I feel like I&#39;m glad I said something because <br/>
something needed to be said.  I&#39;ve lost friends over it.  It&#39;s not like I don&#39;t <br/>
care about the adult, it&#39;s that I care more about the child who can&#39;t escape the <br/>
injury.  <br/>
<br/>
When I hear stories of teens being injured by their parents, I&#39;m doubly glad I <br/>
said something, even if it wasn&#39;t to that person, it went into someone&#39;s head. <br/>
 It&#39;s simple... be nice to your kids.  Don&#39;t do or say things you shouldn&#39;t say <br/>
or do.  Make your child&#39;s life so wonderful and happy that your kids will never <br/>
run from you.  When those teens become adults, you get to continue having them <br/>
around and in your life.  I know plenty of people who moved far away and never <br/>
or rarely talk to their parents after they became an adult. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t do or say things that are mean or cruel and if you do, apologize and do <br/>
NOT do it again.  There are so many things parents can do to make their <br/>
children&#39;s life miserable by not proactively making it wonderful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912104962">Jenny, you&#39;re right. I will try to speak up more often.  I don&#39;t expect it will lose me any friends, since only one of my close friends does this, and she&#39;d not dump us for a simple disagreement.  Goodness knows she and I disagree about enough other things and still manage to remain good friends.  Acquaintance level folks, if I manage to offend and scare them off, no big, since likely my kids don&#39;t know their kids very well anyway. <br/>
<br/>
Even if only to have the kids around me hear how I feel about them and how I would like to see them treated, that will be enough. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206226038">Years ago on one of these lists I read a poem about a mom showing her teen son <br/>
she was boss by taking away his things, making him buy used clothes at Goodwill, <br/>
because the son said something about calling CPS on her because she was a mean <br/>
mom.  I think it was making internet rounds at the time and parents were <br/>
applauding.<br/>
<br/>
Someone here made a rebuttal poem which was awesome.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are now teens (well 16 & 12) and fabulous people.  It has been a joy to <br/>
watch them grow.  Sometimes I wish I had saved that second poem.<br/>

<br/>
That poem was sometimes called, &quot;Don&#39;t Mess With Mom&quot; and sometimes called, &quot;Children&#39;s Bill of Rights&quot; when it went around the internet.    I don&#39;t recommend anyone read it.  It&#39;s awful. <br/>
<br/>
***Someone here made a rebuttal poem which was awesome.***<br/>
<br/>
Pam G. posted to this list when it showed up on some other list she was on.  She posted a reply.     I think that&#39;s the poem you&#39;re thinking of. <br/>
<br/>
You can find it at message number 12721 and the subject line is, Re: homeschooling group question.<br/>
