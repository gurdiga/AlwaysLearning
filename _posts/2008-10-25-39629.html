<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219446393">I&#39;ve been homeschooling my children since 1988.   Older kids (30, <br/>
28, 26, and 22) are grown and moved on.   We still have four younger <br/>
kids (15, 14, 13, 12) at home, all internationally adopted.   We&#39;ve <br/>
had a mom-directed approach.   Never very formal in that I&#39;ve never <br/>
been into formal curricula, but I have definitely controlled the <br/>
operation.  We do &quot;school&quot;. It feels to me like the right time to <br/>
shift, to give up my control.  But what holds me back are two <br/>
things.  <br/>
<br/>
First, my 15 year old has severe learning issues.    We are not sure <br/>
of the whole story (she came to us when six from a bad Chinese <br/>
orphanage), but it&#39;s clear that her difficulties are complex and in <br/>
large part connected to a low IQ, that would probably classify her <br/>
as borderline retarded/slow learner.  We know she has a major <br/>
language processing disorder, but that is complicated by the low <br/>
IQ.   She has been unable to learn to tell time or handle money.  <br/>
Her reading skills are adequate but her comprehension is very poor.  <br/>
There is some possibility that she has fetal alcohol exposure, <br/>
although we have no history to confirm this, but we definitely see <br/>
signs of the type of brain impairments that would go with this. I <br/>
worry about whether she would benefit by unschooling or if her <br/>
serious learning problems require more structure......and yet, I <br/>
realize she&#39;s not learning certain things even with my imposed <br/>
structure.  Her therapists have long supported our homeschooling <br/>
over putting her in institutional school, but the assumption has <br/>
been that I am actively working with her.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, I just don&#39;t know how to make the switch from mom-directed <br/>
to unschooling. Is this something that I should introduce with the <br/>
girls by an announcement?   Should I just stop directing and see <br/>
what happens?   How do I get four girls who totally expect me to <br/>
direct their learning to make a switch and assume some <br/>
responsibility?<br/>
<br/>
How have people made this transition?    My girls have never been in <br/>
institutional school, but they are used to my imposed structure.   I <br/>
have planned time for my reading to them, and I typically pick the <br/>
books I want to read based on my concept of what material I want to <br/>
cover.   I pick out math texts and I have structured time for doing <br/>
math lessons, where I make myself available to assist.    I <br/>
pick &quot;living books&quot; for history and science, and I &quot;assign&quot; what the <br/>
girls read, although of course they also choose their own books at <br/>
libraries and bookstores. There is definitely free time during the <br/>
day where they make their own schedule, but I am definitely <br/>
maintaining control of an academic atmosphere.   <br/>
<br/>
All girls are heavily involved in dance.   They take multiple <br/>
lessons each week, ranging from four classes for the youngest to <br/>
seven for the older two.   Add on rehearsals for Nutcracker and <br/>
spring performances.   We spend two to four weeks every year in <br/>
Florida where the girls read obsessively and swim, a nice break from <br/>
a Montana winter.   We spend our summers at a cottage on a Canadian <br/>
lake, and the girls do lots of whining there because they are away <br/>
from the dance studio.  Three of the girls take piano lessons and <br/>
all four take a knitting class at a local shop, which we&#39;ve <br/>
continued well past their picking up basic knitting skills becausre <br/>
we&#39;ve enjoyed it so much.   The girls knit quite a bit, making gifts <br/>
for friends.<br/>
<br/>
I should add that we live 25 miles from town, so they are dependent <br/>
on my driving to get to town to the library or other activities.<br/>
<br/>
I never direct during the summer months or the weeks we spend in <br/>
Florida.   This fall I thought about just not making a switch in <br/>
September, but the girls kept talking about what we would be doing <br/>
for &quot;school&quot; and I feel back into traditional territory of my <br/>
planning, my directing.  This is what we&#39;re all used to.   They <br/>
expect it, and I&#39;m in a rut.   One of the girls is getting major <br/>
pressure from friends to go to public school.   She likes the idea <br/>
of being able to talk about what she&#39;s doing in a way that her <br/>
public school friends can relate to.   I&#39;m not sure if she would see <br/>
unschooling as adequate initially.<br/>
<br/>
One motivation for making a change is that I&#39;m slowing down because <br/>
I&#39;m aging.    I turn 62 in December, and because we started our <br/>
family late (first child born when I was 31) and then we adopted six <br/>
after the two bio sons, my husband and I are still parenting and <br/>
will be until the 12 year old moves on.   I love parenting.    I&#39;ve <br/>
loved homeschooling.   But I&#39;m tired.   I don&#39;t want to feel I&#39;m <br/>
bailing out of homeschooling, but I&#39;m tired of the &quot;school&quot; nature <br/>
to our lives.  I just don&#39;t know how to change.   I don&#39;t want it to <br/>
look as if I&#39;m abandoning the mom control because I&#39;m OLD.   I would <br/>
like the girls to see this as a positive move in our lives, but I <br/>
just don&#39;t know how to go about making a change. <br/>
<br/>
Any advice on how to make the switch?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368953792">The other post with the links is the more important one, but this is  <br/>
commentary on some particulars:<br/>
<br/>
-=-She has been unable to learn to tell time or handle money. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why don&#39;t you say &quot;I have been unable to teach her to tell time or  <br/>
handle money&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
And then you can start to think about the difference between teaching/ <br/>
learning and REAL, natural learning that happens all the time  <br/>
(especially out of the range of teaching).<br/>
<br/>
I bet that gradually, in real-world ways, she can learn to tell time  <br/>
and handle money.<br/>

<br/>
-=-Her reading skills are adequate but her comprehension is very  <br/>
poor. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Let that go for a while.  Do other things where she can learn without  <br/>
any of her own reading.  Videos.   Fun webpages.<br/>
<br/>
Here are lots of links and some of them require no reading at all.   <br/>
Maybe you could scout out some good stuff, or explore them with her  <br/>
and the other kids:<br/>

And about how unschooling works, it&#39;s not as much work as school at  <br/>
home in many ways, but it&#39;s more work than that in a whole new and  <br/>
different way.<br/>

<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t do that.  Not an all-of-a-sudden thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Should I just stop directing and see what happens? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, not that either.  Become less controlling and more creative,  <br/>
gradually.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-How do I get four girls who totally expect me to direct their  <br/>
learning to make a switch and assume some responsibility?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it would be good for you to read more about unschooling  <br/>
families and what it looks like in everyday practice.  I have a  <br/>
collection, but there are also more and more blogs with photos which  <br/>
might be more interesting.  I&#39;ll give you links below, but the reason  <br/>
I want to send you out is that I think (from what you&#39;ve written) you  <br/>
think unschooling will be less work and the girls will take  <br/>
responsibility to direct their learning.<br/>
<br/>
When unschooling works well, no on is &quot;directing&quot; anyone&#39;s learning.   <br/>
No child is responsible for his own progress or learning.  I know  <br/>
there are people out there saying it, but every time one says it  <br/>
around me, I object.<br/>
<br/>
-=-and yet, I realize she&#39;s not learning certain things even with my  <br/>
imposed structure. Her therapists have long supported our  <br/>
homeschooling over putting her in institutional school, but the  <br/>
assumption has been that I am actively working with her.-=-<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to actively work with her that aren&#39;t schoolish.  Have  <br/>
you been limiting movies, or TV, or computer time?  Maybe that could  <br/>
be the first thing to let up on.  Encourage lots of movie watching  <br/>
and computer use, maybe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>She is what she is.  IQ testing is an outdated testing system that was<br/>
created from a test that was never intended to measure intelligence.  It<br/>
reached it&#39;s height in the 50&#39;s.  I&#39;d drop the idea of low intelligence<br/>
and focus on what she is actually good at.<br/>
<br/>
She has been unable to learn to tell time or handle money.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Her reading skills are adequate but her comprehension is very poor.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you have a digital clock?  Can she read numbers?  Does she own a<br/>
watch?  Could you make a sundial?  Does she get an allowance?  When does<br/>
she get a chance to use money?<br/>
<br/>
How are you measuring her reading comprehension?  You said that the<br/>
girls read on their own, does she understand what she is reading when<br/>
she reads her own books?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; over putting her in institutional school, but the assumption has<br/>
&gt; been that I am actively working with her.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you stop the school at home, you will still be actively working with<br/>
her, just in a different way, hopefully more meaningful to her.<br/>

they want to do rather than what they think you want them to do.  Don&#39;t<br/>
expect anyone to assume any kind of responsibility.  Let them come to a<br/>
new way of living and seeing things gradually.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have planned time for my reading to them, and I typically pick the<br/>
&gt; books I want to read based on my concept of what material I want to<br/>
&gt; cover.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps, next time let them pick the books they want you to read, or get<br/>
things on tape or cd to listen to while doing other things like<br/>
knitting.  If one or 2 of them wander off, don&#39;t make a big deal of it. <br/>
Get food and drinks and make the focus be fun and relaxing time<br/>
together.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I pick out math texts and I have structured time for doing<br/>
&gt; math lessons, where I make myself available to assist.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe play games instead, or find math puzzles to solve together. <br/>
Textbook math is very boring and doesn&#39;t even begin to encompass what<br/>
math is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I pick &quot;living books&quot; for history and science, and I &quot;assign&quot; what the<br/>
&gt; girls read, although of course they also choose their own books at<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Find movies and go to science museums.  At first you could stop<br/>
assigning and let them pick something of their own choosing.  After a<br/>
while, let them choose not to choose at all.  Maybe they don&#39;t want to<br/>
do those books at all.  History is all around us, there are museums and<br/>
national monuments and antique stores and all kinds of things around us<br/>
that show where we&#39;ve been.<br/>
<br/>

Here&#39;s a sample of where one &quot;subject&quot; called dance can lead a person...<br/>

And that was just the tip of the iceberg!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I never direct during the summer months or the weeks we spend in<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Slowly and gradually shift to seeing learning in every thing a person<br/>
does.  Your kids have passions, help them follow what they love.  Start<br/>
with changing your schedule around, don&#39;t expect and don&#39;t force.  When<br/>
you go to the library, let them pick what they want and you can pick<br/>
things you think they might enjoy.  Give more choices.<br/>

<br/>
If you got to amazon.com I&#39;m sure there will be a category of &quot;best  <br/>
dance movies.&quot;  Maybe at netflix.com, too.<br/>
White Nights will get you geography and the Soviet Union, ballet and  <br/>
tap.<br/>
<br/>
Singing in the Rain has dancing and some of the history of movies.<br/>
<br/>
Most early Fred Astaire stuff gets you The Great Depression, and what  <br/>
people liked as fantasy escapism when they were very poor but a  <br/>
Saturday movie matinee was affordable.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t show a movie and say &quot;Class, this is The Great  <br/>
Depression...&quot; or &quot;Please observe that this movie was made just a few  <br/>
years before the Soviet Union was dissolved.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Strictly Ballroom... Australia and gypsies.  I hadn&#39;t considered that  <br/>
there would be Spanish gypsies in Australia.  And that&#39;s not even  <br/>
what the movie is about.<br/>
<br/>
The very-new High School Musical 3 has some VERY cool dance scenes.<br/>
<br/>
Let them ask questions, or make comments the same way you would to  <br/>
adult friends who might know those things already.  It might take  <br/>
years for them to start making their own connections, but they will.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313727141">&quot;How do I get four girls who totally expect me to <br/>
direct their learning to make a switch and assume some <br/>
responsibility?&quot;<br/>
the short answer is, &#39;slowly&#39;, it&#39;s not their fault that they have <br/>
learnt the lesson &#39;wait to be told what to do&#39; if this is what was <br/>
previously rewarded.<br/>
When I made the switch from schooling to unschooling with my older son, <br/>
I learnt how to do it through the time I was spending with my younger <br/>
son.<br/>
Through setting a timer (for my benefit not his!) I started with 5 - 15 <br/>
minutes every day where I concentrated totally on following the <br/>
changing focus of my child. If he started a jigsaw puzzle and then <br/>
chose to use the puzzle pieces to tell a story, then I went along with <br/>
that. Putting the pieces back was no longer our task. it had fallen off <br/>
our radar. To start with the 15 minutes were incredibly long, 5 minutes <br/>
was only barely sufferable as I learnt not to direct the play. what I <br/>
learnt was that as I learnt to let him stay in his changing focus, he <br/>
was able to stay in his focus aswell, and didn&#39;t look to be to be the <br/>
director. In hindsight I would say that it wasn&#39;t a problem that he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t take responsibility, but more that he hadn&#39;t been allowed to. <br/>
We are now able t play, work, and laugh together and he is (again! <br/>
because this is what he was doing as a toddler!) able to both self <br/>
inititiate a task and ask for help if/when he needs it. I haven&#39;t <br/>
abandoned him, I have over time changed my role to that of facilitator.<br/>
I have also learnt to be kind to my self (in changing how I am doing <br/>
homeschooling I am also unschooling, and I ocassionally fall back into <br/>
what I have grown up with. But I no longer need to stay there, even if <br/>
I&#39;ve paid for the workbooks and photocopies - doesn&#39;t mean I need to <br/>
use them)<br/>
<br/>
wishing you kind days<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s true that traditional parenting has mechanisms that shut kids  <br/>
down, that prevents their creative thinking, and that punishes  <br/>
initiative.<br/>
<br/>
Still, to have &quot;taking responsibility&quot; as a goal can be a problem  <br/>
when people are changing their parenting focus.  The parent should  <br/>
still have responsibility for making sure the child&#39;s life is rich  <br/>
and good and full of opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not any child&#39;s job to raise himself, to take care of himself,  <br/>
or to &quot;direct his own learning&quot; or any of those  many phrase that  <br/>
make me cringe.<br/>
<br/>
Some people criticize unschooling because they don&#39;t want their child  <br/>
to rule the house, or they don&#39;t want a &quot;child-led life.&quot;  That  <br/>
argument couldn&#39;t survive if there weren&#39;t people saying their  <br/>
children should lead their own learning, or make all their own  <br/>
decisions.<br/>
<br/>
Both of those miss the model that we&#39;ve been talking about for many  <br/>
years, in which the parents choose to create an environment in which  <br/>
natural learning thrives.<br/>
