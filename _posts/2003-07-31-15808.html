Thanks, Tia.  I never got that e-mail.  I went to the group&#39;s archives to see <br/>
what I&#39;m missing because a couple of times people have referred to something <br/>
I never got.  I hope it&#39;s just me, a personal glitch, and that others aren&#39;t <br/>
missing posts too.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Pinnies.&quot;  At least I can look on the web.<br/>

<br/>
I think there is a yahoo glitch because things are either coming out of order <br/>
or not at all in my case also. I&#39;ve been to the archives more than I care to, <br/>
just to find out what I am missing or who I have seemingly ignored. Very odd.<br/>

just hope there&#39;ll be an explanation later down the line.<br/>
