<div id="ygrps-yiv-2053847835">hi all,<br/>
i am very much on with my journey of unschooling and am totally<br/>
enjoying the adventure.  i just have a question that keeps<br/>
niggling.......how would u propose unschooling in the &quot;developing&quot;<br/>
nations?  what i mean by this is.....we hear all the time of the<br/>
advantages of an education for the children of these nations and how<br/>
we in the west can support a child and pay for his/her<br/>
education....how it gives them more choice and betters them for their<br/>
future....are we just being misled?  are they being misled?  is this<br/>
just an ideology from the west that we are transferring to them?  do<br/>
they really need our notion of what denotes &quot;an education&#39;&quot;.  you hear<br/>
a lot of children on the interviews saying they want to be doctors,<br/>
teachers etc.  and then are given the impression that their education<br/>
will get them there.  <br/>
thanks in advance for your ideas.<br/>

<br/>
That may be true for them though.<br/>
They don&#39;t have the access to materials and information in the homes<br/>
the way Americans do. Their parents may not have many skills or access<br/>
to methods of gaining skills. So school might actually improve their<br/>
lot in life.<br/>

<br/>
Unschooling works here only when a family is able to be extremely  <br/>
involved with the children.  In places where parents  have to live  <br/>
away from home, or 12 hours a day, or for so little money they can&#39;t  <br/>
afford reading materials or museums or whatever, it won&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
School is better than not-school, under conditions in which  <br/>
unschooling wouldn&#39;t work anyway.<br/>
<br/>
-=-is this just an ideology from the west that we are transferring to  <br/>
them? do they really need our notion of what denotes &quot;an education&#39;&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The West has pressed and challenged other nations to do it more our  <br/>
way, and so in some ways it becomes a necessity.  If a Chinese kid  <br/>
wants to get out of the village, education is the way to go.  Same  <br/>
with lots of places and cultures and economic situations.<br/>
<br/>
Yo might want to read about some of the movement in India to get away  <br/>
from the English colonial leftovers and to go back to their more  <br/>
traditional ways.  That&#39;s where unschooling is, In India.  It&#39;s mixed  <br/>
in with other &quot;why do we do it the European way?&quot; questions.  They  <br/>
will use English, though, because there are too many languages  <br/>
there.  English is what unites India.  That they&#39;ll keep.<br/>
<br/>
-=-you hear a lot of children on the interviews saying they want to  <br/>
be doctors,teachers etc. and then are given the impression that their  <br/>
education will get them there. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I know a family who would&#39;ve been untouchables in northern India had  <br/>
the dad not gotten a government scholarship to go to college and then  <br/>
to do grad work abroad.  He ended up in Toronto for a PhD, and then  <br/>
Bell Laboratories in New Jersey.  Of five children, the two oldest  <br/>
are girls.  One is a banker and married a millionaire and lives in a  <br/>
mansion in Florida.  The next sister works at the U.N, some sort of  <br/>
international advisement; I don&#39;t know the details.  The two youngest  <br/>
boys are medical specialists.  One heart, one I forget what.  The  <br/>
middle kid was my boyfriend for four years when I was a teen and he  <br/>
was 21-24.  He is the failure of the family.  He has an MD, did  <br/>
family medicine (in Spanish, in the Dominican Republic, so he&#39;s got  <br/>
Hindi, English and Spanish), then became a child psychiatrist and now  <br/>
is doing ayurvedic combo medicine and counseling.  BIG failure,  <br/>
because he won&#39;t settle and isn&#39;t a surgeon.<br/>
<br/>
That family is proof that education buys big houses and gives them  <br/>
enough money to visit relatives in India and help them financially.   <br/>
No one can argue with the extreme difference in their lives from this  <br/>
to what if the father had stayed in his village, with whatever job he  <br/>
could&#39;ve gotten without a college degree.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t for everyone.  Can&#39;t be.  Shouldn&#39;t be.  Most  <br/>
people can&#39;t do it, some shouldn&#39;t, and in many cases it just  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work anyway.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just finished reading Three Cups of Tea (which I LOVED!!!) and it <br/>
is all about building schools in Pakistan .  So I spent a lot of time <br/>
pondering this -- my very strong belief in unschooling and my total <br/>
joy in the schools  Greg Mortenson was/is building for kids, girls in <br/>
particular, in Pakistan and now Afganistan. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ikat.org/">http://www.ikat.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
What I came to was this: they are unschooling, pretty much.  They <br/>
absolutely choose to go to school, in some many ways they have to <br/>
fight for that choice.  They don&#39;t necessarily place school above <br/>
other aspects of life, they also work in the fields, take time off <br/>
for deaths, births, to help out the family ... for them school is <br/>
another thing out there to do in life.  They don&#39;t have books, paper, <br/>
pencils at home, so here is an opportunity to use all these great <br/>
things.  Just as we would help our kids study for the ACT (very <br/>
schooly) if they wanted to get into college to study to become a <br/>
doctor, so these families help their kids go to school so that they <br/>
can go to college and become doctors (or whatever).  <br/>
<br/>
My kids and I have actually started collecting pennies for the <br/>
pennies for peace progam -- a penny buys a pencil in Central Asia, <br/>
something my dd in particulatr can&#39;t imagine living without.<br/>

teacher or a doctor or a marine biologist they would probably, at <br/>
some point, need to go to some kind of school to get there. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-954453637">-=-They don&#39;t have books, paper,<br/>

<br/>
There are some families without such things at home.  We had  <br/>
neighbors when Holly was little.  The mom didn&#39;t have crayons or  <br/>
paints or any such messy thing in her house, because Kellee could  <br/>
paint and draw at school.   Their house was like a motel suite,  <br/>
photographable at any moment.<br/>
<br/>
I bought a globe when I was a kid.  Saved my money.  Otherwise, the  <br/>
only maps would&#39;ve been ten or  fifteen years old in the encyclopedia  <br/>
we had (ten years old when I first got the globe; fifteen years old  <br/>
when I was in high school and still using it).<br/>
<br/>
Some people are unschooling without much stuff, either.  Some don&#39;t  <br/>
have the internet (and they&#39;re unlikely to read this).  There&#39;s a  <br/>
continuum from no resources to too many resources, maybe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a neighbor when I was seven.  Geneva.  I don&#39;t remember her  <br/>
last name.  They lived in a two-room adobe house, right next to the  <br/>
bus stop, so we played while we were waiting for school.    They  <br/>
owned two cookpans, just a few dishes, had electric light, but I  <br/>
don&#39;t remember anything else electric.  Wind-up clock.  The stove was  <br/>
natural gas, or maybe wood.   I think two beds, two chairs, just her  <br/>
mom and grandfather and her, I think.   No paper, no pencils outside  <br/>
of her school supplies.  For that family, school was great.  For  <br/>
Geneva, school was good.<br/>
<br/>
For me, school was good because my mom was usually ragging and  <br/>
complaining and accusing and insulting and telling me to go somewhere  <br/>
else and do something else, or get back here and do whatever she told  <br/>
me to do.  There were other times, not so bad, but the chances of it  <br/>
being rag on and on and on were about 60%, and a full day never  <br/>
passed without a bout of it.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t the opposite of school, but it kinda seems like it  <br/>
might be when someone standing between a school door and a $700  <br/>
curriculum, and sees some kids playing off in the distance.<br/>

Choosing to go to school isn&#39;t unschooling.  That&#39;s not a good way to  <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be thrilled if you used this list to say school by choice is a  <br/>
world of difference from school by compulsion.  I&#39;d send this link to  <br/>
go with it:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, that is why I said unschooling pretty much.  But I got it, <br/>
school by choice isn&#39;t school by cumplusion.  <br/>
<br/>
But isn&#39;t that the point that I was making in the first place?  I <br/>
actually came to my place of balance with the issue of those schools <br/>
that kids fight for versus us choosing to unschool by way of your <br/>
article you posted the link to.  You wrote &quot;No longer were these <br/>
children in school against their will, their parents having submitted <br/>
them to a lock-up situation. On one hand they had teachers who wanted <br/>
them to stay in school. On the other hand they had parents who wanted <br/>
them to stay home. How much more &quot;wanted&quot; could they feel? Each <br/>
moment they were in school they were aware, and the teacher was <br/>
aware, that they were there because they, the children, WANTED to be <br/>
there!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Granted,there are a whole world of cultural issues that are also at <br/>
play in many of these situations. And, I agree, &gt;going to school is <br/>
still going to school.&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I just know that I wouldn&#39;t want my children *denied* the right to <br/>
choose to go to school.  And I think that that is the main thing at <br/>
play in these countries.  <br/>
<br/>
And, now back unschooling ... which I am eternally grateful for <br/>
having the freedom to choose.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, maybe my wording is all wrong again -- I was trying to <br/>
explain how I found a place for both unschooling my children and <br/>
understanding the *need* for schools in other parts of the world.<br/>

around here who would be willing to put in the time and energy and  <br/>
attention that unschooling requires.<br/>
