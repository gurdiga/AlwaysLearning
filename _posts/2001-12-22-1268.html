<div id="ygrps-yiv-639289369">Well I&#39;ve been lurking for a few days.. getting up the courage to post ( a<br/>
big glass of wine helps!)  We are a family of five.. homeschoolers for 10<br/>
yrs and then unschoolers.. me and the girls more so than my husband, at<br/>
least as far as math is concerned. (and I do need suggestions in this<br/>
area!!) He is ok with everything but this for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m married.. 21 yrs.. we have 3 daughters.. ages 17, 11, and 6yrs.<br/>
<br/>
We live in the country..and are a back-to-the-land homesteading kinda<br/>
family. We raise goats for milk, chickens for eggs and my oldest daughter<br/>
has 2 Appaloosas..I also have sheep.  I love herbs, gardening, baking bread<br/>
and whole foods, feeding the birds, and books of course..I&#39;m always<br/>
reading.. a stay at home kinda person really.<br/>
<br/>
We tend to be Libertarians in our political thinking..  not so sure about<br/>
our Spiritual side anylonger.. once pretty fundamentalist Christian..(I was<br/>
raised Lutheran, my husband was no specific religion when we married) but<br/>
after experiencing some very bad things done to us by &quot;so called<br/>
Christians&quot;.. we are once more searching. I personally tend to lean to<br/>
Native American spirituality now.<br/>
<br/>
A special &#39;hello&#39; to Sandra.. I&#39;m a big fan of yours.. reading your site..<br/>
listening to you on the unschoolers forum..and also your articles in Home<br/>
Education magazine. I&#39;m curious about your spiritual journey..raised<br/>
Southeran Baptist..but now?? What changed for you? Or maybe none of my<br/>
business..and that&#39;s ok too.  Hey, I also am interested in the Medieval<br/>
stuff that you do.. my family and I once went to a festival near OKC and my<br/>
sister and brother in law used to be very into it.. sounds like SO much<br/>
fun!! I also love the Civil war re-enactments that are done locally in our<br/>
area.<br/>
<br/>
Ok.. hear it goes..<br/>
