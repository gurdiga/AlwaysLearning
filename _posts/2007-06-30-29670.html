<div id="ygrps-yiv-824242147">I found a definition of &quot;virtue&quot; that I really liked, on the visual  <br/>
thesaurus, and it&#39;s &quot;the quality of doing what is right and avoiding  <br/>
what is wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty, who participated with a group I ran all last winter to have  <br/>
weekly discussions with a dozen SCA members of medieval virtues and  <br/>
applying virtues in the everyday modern world, was right there.  I  <br/>
told him the definition and he kinda turned his mouth to one said and  <br/>
shook his head, and said &quot;I don&#39;t like the &#39;avoiding&#39; part.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to avoid what&#39;s wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought maybe they meant avoid doing what&#39;s wrong, but Marty  <br/>
figures virtuous people have to be in a position to try to stop &quot;wrong.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;But you want to be a super hero, and I just want to be  <br/>
virtuous!&quot;  (Above-Average Joe, who has a MySpace page, is secretly  <br/>
Marty Dodd.  If I&#39;d named him Diego Dodd instead, it would have been  <br/>
more in keeping with naming practice, but Zorro has Diego...  but I  <br/>
digress...)<br/>
<br/>
His response to that was &quot;I bet you like Superman better than  <br/>
Batman.&quot;  It&#39;s true, I do.<br/>
<br/>
He said a study had shown that passive people liked Superman better,  <br/>
and Batman fans tended to want to do something to solve other  <br/>
people&#39;s problems.  Well...  I do like Superman, but I kinda feel  <br/>
that I&#39;m an other-people&#39;s-problem-solver, too, to the point that  <br/>
some who know me best will preface a story with &quot;I don&#39;t want you to  <br/>
do anything, but...&quot; or &quot;I don&#39;t want this fixed, I just want advice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So maybe I mess up the theory or maybe I just don&#39;t appreciate Batman  <br/>
as I should.  Maybe I just prefer primary colors to a black-and- <br/>
purple theme.  Maybe I like writers.  Maybe I was born in the 50&#39;s  <br/>
instead of the 60&#39;s and that&#39;s that.<br/>
<br/>
Any other thoughts on &quot;avoiding what is wrong&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
Will I drink and drive?  Or will someone help me not to...not avoid <br/>
the &quot;wrong&quot;ness of it, but make an effort to help me?<br/>
<br/>
Would my brother go to jail for smoking pot, or could a doctor stand <br/>
up and say, &quot;I will confront the wrong of living with chronic pain <br/>
and find a way to help you...even without medical insurance.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, now I&#39;ve forgotten my point...and what the original post said.  <br/>
Apparently, though, I&#39;m a Batman...<br/>

Hmmm, this is interesting. If I had to choose I over Batman and Superman I would choose Superman. But, out of them all I really like Spiderman. Any thoughts on him and avoidance etc?<br/>

PS My husband has always raved about Superman and he is ULTRA passive and an ultra avoider!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064914255">-=-It kinda depends on what you&#39;re defining as &quot;wrong&quot; doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
It&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot; for *anyone* to live in fear...<br/>
it&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot; for *anyone* to have to go hungry...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well it&#39;s wrong that English sucks. I mean &quot;English sucks&quot;---&gt; correct.<br/>
<br/>
#1, I misspelled &quot;average&quot; (or I typo-fied it, anyway).  That&#39;s  <br/>
wrong, not to spell as well as one can in public.<br/>
<br/>
-=-IMO, it&#39;s &quot;wrong&quot; for my husband to look at porn...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Porn doesn&#39;t bother me.  So in my universe, with my own divvying up  <br/>
of wrong from right, porn is no big deal.<br/>
Spending a bunch of money on it would be a bad thing.  Leaving it  <br/>
casually lying around would be &quot;wrong&quot; (in my wrongs).<br/>
<br/>
If my husband didn&#39;t put gas in the cars, that would be &quot;wrong,&quot; but  <br/>
that comes under fulfilling obligations and safety and consideration  <br/>
(for me, not the same in every family/home/couple).<br/>
<br/>
If my husband had no clean underwear one day that would be wrong.   <br/>
Partly it would be wrong because it&#39;s never happened to him since I  <br/>
came into his life (and maybe never before that, but I don&#39;t know).   <br/>
It has happened to ME in the past thirty years, but not to Keith.   <br/>
(Partly he owns more underwear, partly I&#39;m less conscientious about  <br/>
keeping my own clothes laundered than I am about his, because he has  <br/>
to go to work.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-If everyone avoids &quot;wrong&quot;, who&#39;s going to fix things? Will children<br/>
still go go bed hungry...because we look the other way instead of<br/>
getting close to a &quot;wrong&quot;?-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I read the definition I saw it as making the better choice.   <br/>
Seeing two things and making the worse/wrong choice isn&#39;t virtuous.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing hungry children and doing nothing would be choosing the wrong.<br/>
It&#39;s not about avoiding other people&#39;s &quot;wrong,&quot; it&#39;s about not  <br/>
creating some of your own.  (I think.  As I interpretted it is was.)<br/>

<br/>
My first thought was that if you haven&#39;t heard Weird Al&#39;s song about  <br/>
Spiderman, you should.  It&#39;s a parody of Billy Joel&#39;s &quot;piano man.&quot;   <br/>
You can get it from iTunes for 99 cents (or whatever that is in  <br/>
wherever you are).<br/>
<br/>
The lyrics are<br/>
<br/>
Weird Al Yankovic - Spiderman Lyrics<br/>
<br/>
(Parody of &quot;Piano Man&quot; by Billy Joel)<br/>
<br/>
Poor Peter Parker was pitiful<br/>
Couldn&#39;t have been any shier<br/>
Mary Jane still wouldn&#39;t notice him<br/>
Even if his hair was on fire<br/>
<br/>
But then one day he went to that science lab<br/>
That mutated spider came down<br/>
Oh and now Peter crawls over everyone&#39;s walls<br/>
And he&#39;s swingin&#39; all over town<br/>
<br/>
La la la didy dah<br/>
La la lily da da dum<br/>
<br/>
Sling us a web you&#39;re the Spiderman<br/>
Sling us a web tonight<br/>
&#39;Cause we&#39;re all in the mood for a hero now<br/>
And there&#39;s evil-doers to fight<br/>
<br/>
Now Harry the rich kid&#39;s a friend of his<br/>
Who horns in on Mary Jane<br/>
But to his great surprise<br/>
It seems she prefers guys<br/>
Who can kiss upsidedown in the rain<br/>
<br/>
&quot;With great power comes great responsibility&quot;<br/>
That&#39;s the catch phrase of old Uncle Ben<br/>
If you missed it, don&#39;t worry they&#39;ll say the line<br/>
Again and again and again<br/>
<br/>
La la la didy dah<br/>
La la didy da da dum<br/>
<br/>
Now Norman&#39;s a billionaire scientist<br/>
Who never had time for his son<br/>
And then somethin&#39; went screwy<br/>
And before you knew, he<br/>
was trying to kill everyone<br/>
<br/>
Then he&#39;d ridin&#39; around on that glider-thing<br/>
And he&#39;d throw in that weird pumpkin bomb<br/>
Yes, he&#39;s wearin&#39; that dumb Power Rangers mask<br/>
But he&#39;s scarier without it on<br/>
<br/>
Sling us a web you&#39;re the Spiderman<br/>
Sling us a web tonight<br/>
&#39;Cause you&#39;re brave and you&#39;re strong and so limber now<br/>
But where&#39;d you come up with those tights<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a pretty sad day at the funeral<br/>
Norman Osbourne has bitten the dust<br/>
And I heard Harry said he wants Spiderman dead<br/>
Ah but his buddy Pete he can trust<br/>
<br/>
Oh and M.J. is all hot for Peter now<br/>
Ah but Peter he just shuts her down<br/>
Mary Jane don&#39;t you cry, you can give it a try<br/>
Again when the sequel comes around<br/>
<br/>
La la la didy dah<br/>
La la didy da da dum<br/>
<br/>
Sling us a web you&#39;re the Spiderman<br/>
Sling us a web tonight<br/>
&#39;Cause we all sure could use us a hero now<br/>
We think that you&#39;ll do alright<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll chew on this awhile, I think.  I discussed it with Daddy today, <br/>
and found this interesting...just thinking of who I liked better, I <br/>
probably would&#39;ve said Superman, but looking closer, after typing all <br/>
that out, it certainly seemed more like a Batman thing.  Daddy said <br/>
the same thing, I asked him who he preferred, and he said Superman, <br/>
then after we had talked about it, he was thinking more toward <br/>
Batman.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my world-changing question, though.  HOW does Superman get <br/>
that little curl on his forehead when he changes from Clark Kent?  <br/>
Last thing he does before he comes out of the phone booth is lick his <br/>
finger and twist that little bit of hair?<br/>
That&#39;s what I want to know.<br/>

I&#39;ve never seen those!  Dairy Products Gone Bad, heh, heh...<br/>
As for me, I *loved* &quot;The Tick&quot; and his sidekick &quot;Arthur&quot; dressed like a moth. <br/>
I looked it up on Wikipedia, because I remember The Tick knew an assortment of odd superheroes.  The one I liked best was &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; because when I was 11, a friend of mine used to draw a version of Batman and called him &quot;Die Fledermausman&quot;.  That&#39;s how we passed the time in math class (taught by a man who could not understand why we couldn&#39;t &quot;get&quot; math - umm, because you made it so boring that even the math whiz had to draw German batpeople?)<br/>
I looked down the site and found that Patrick Warburton was cast in the live-action TV show The Tick (which I never saw) and when I googled *him*, he is drawn as Superman on a Superman art site!<br/>
So...after all that, I&#39;d pick Batman, given the choice &lt;g&gt;.  I couldn&#39;t wait to get home to see the live-action Batman with Adam West and Burt (Holy Animal Superheroes, Batman!) Ward, once upon a time.<br/>

like Oracle. Batman doesn&#39;t need her nearly as much as he once did...I&#39;m sure the <br/>
batphone has internet access now. But I still like Oracle best, I think, of all the <br/>
superheroes. Her resilience, and the way she retained her sense of humor even after the <br/>
Joker crippled her. <br/>
<br/>
I think you could make a case that Batman was an unschooler of sorts...<br/>
