What an *awesome* statement!! I was raised in the safe and happy  <br/>
house...and my hubby did have to compete. :-) I wasn&#39;t out looking  <br/>
for someone to love me because I got total love and acceptance at  <br/>
home. I had to meet someone that was worth leaving home for! And he  <br/>
was/is worth it....but my parents live next door to us. So I didn&#39;t  <br/>
go far. LOL My mom is even joining us at [the Live and Learn  <br/>
Conference] this year.<br/>
