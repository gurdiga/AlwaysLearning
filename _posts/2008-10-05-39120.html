<div id="ygrps-yiv-175541555">**I don&#39;t think of humanism as a group, but some people do and have managed <br/>
to make a minor counter-religion of it, just as some atheists have, with <br/>
meetings and literature and I guess they have picnics and social stuff.**<br/>

That&#39;s the webiste for the Ethical Humanist Society of Chicago, founded in <br/>
1882. It&#39;s a pretty happening place. :) They exist to perform the community <br/>
functions of churches in their members lives. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The Ethical Humanist Society of Chicago is a democratic fellowship and <br/>
spiritual home for those who seek a rational, compassionate philosophy of life <br/>
without regard to belief or nonbelief in a supreme being. We value the importance <br/>
of living an ethical, responsible, and joyful life. We promote intellectual, <br/>
philosophical, and artistic freedom, avoiding dogma and rigid creed. We nurture <br/>
a sense of wonder about life, nature, and the universe, and are inspired by <br/>
models of human achievement. Shaped by the forces of humanism, democracy, <br/>
science, and religious reform, we cherish human diversity and focus on what we have <br/>
in common, not on what keeps us apart.<br/>
<br/>
While respectful of the faiths and traditions we may have been born to, we <br/>
serve as a new religion or as an alternative to religion.<br/>
<br/>
We care for and support each other, sharing our joys and sorrows. Like <br/>
traditional religious communities, we celebrate births, conduct wedding ceremonies, <br/>
host memorial services, and provide for the caring, ethical education of our <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
We believe in deed beyond creed and in working for a better world. We <br/>
recognize the worth and dignity of every person, and strive to act so as to bring out <br/>
the best in others and thereby in ourselves. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they allow homeschoolers use of their wonderful building space dirt che<br/>
ap. :)<br/>
