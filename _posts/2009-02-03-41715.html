<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095707908">Hi Katherine,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy to see you take an interest in your niece&#39;s condition. I <br/>
have MS and I often wish that my closest and dearest paid more <br/>
attention at times. A great place to start would be to join the <br/>
friendswithMS group on yahoogroups. Just send a blank email to <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:friendswithMS-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">friendswithMS-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a> . They are a great bunch of <br/>
people and have a wealth of information. They&#39;d be the ideal people <br/>
to get you the information you need.<br/>
<br/>
GOod luck!<br/>
<br/>
