<div id="ygrps-yiv-1579605879">Okay.  I watched it.  I laughed, I cried, I leaned right over too close to <br/>
the TV and forgot to breathe.<br/>
<br/>
I was glad it was on DVD, so I could turn on the subtitles and not have to <br/>
keep going back to see what they were saying.  I&#39;m glad the Spanish was easy, <br/>
since they didn&#39;t subtitle that, and I could understand most of that (better <br/>
than I could understand the Polish guy with the English accent), or the boss <br/>
with the Scottish accent...<br/>
<br/>
But is IS a VERY cool movie, totally cool concept, and the #2 main male <br/>
character (I guess, the art therapist) was in Hamlet (played Rosencrantz or <br/>
Guildenstern) and Henry V (played the dauphin), so it was fun to see him in a <br/>
non-Shakespearean situation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041591098">I just got back from seeing Harry Potter.<br/>
It&#39;s SO much better than the first - only there&#39;s less Snape than I <br/>
remember from before.  Sorry ladies.  Personally, I&#39;m a little fond of <br/>
Hagrid.  Big Bearish Mountain-type Guy with a gravelly voice and a big <br/>
dog....<br/>
A great time was certainly had!<br/>
(and it&#39;s a good deal &#39;scarier&#39; as well with startling things popping up <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Apparently the next one has a new director. Which I&#39;m glad of. Though I love<br/>
the actors and the settings, there&#39;s just something missing. The next is<br/>
being directed by the guy who directed A Little Princess<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0113670)">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0113670)</a> which I thought was *wonderful*. He&#39;s so<br/>
good at capturing what&#39;s going on inside the characters which I think is<br/>
what&#39;s lacking in Harry Potter.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone hasn&#39;t heard, The Chamber of Secrets is 2 hours and 41 minutes but<br/>
reviews have said it&#39;s so well paced you don&#39;t notice :-)<br/>

<br/>
We only noticed it when we got out and it was PITCH DARK, and cold.  We <br/>
hadn&#39;t taken coats, and the  showing we&#39;d aimed for was sold out, so we <br/>
thought 35 minutes longer wouldn&#39;t be a problem...<br/>
<br/>
AND we hadn&#39;t told Marty where we were going.  He was out with friends.  <br/>
Holly called and left a message on the phone, but Marty never checked that.   <br/>
So he came home to an empty house, even the wheelchair-gimp gone, and no <br/>
note.   But he did the right thing.  He left for a D&D game without leaving <br/>
US a note! &lt;g&gt;   Good for us knowing he was with a kid with a cellphone. <br/>
<br/>
I was sitting in a nice theatre chair, with my wheelchair at my feet for a <br/>
footstool, leaning my whole back AND neck and head against something soft!!  <br/>
That made me realize that hadn&#39;t happened in over a month and it felt GOOD.  <br/>
Small comforts...  We were in the front row, but it wasn&#39;t too close to the <br/>
screen--pretty far back.  Even Kirby jumped a few times.  It was scarier than <br/>
the last one.  <br/>
<br/>
So who&#39;s going to play Dumbledore next time??<br/>
I bet they already have an idea.  We were thinking maybe Ian McKellan.  Maybe <br/>
Patrick Stewart?  But I don&#39;t think he&#39;s tall.   What abot the guy who played <br/>
Hamlet&#39;s father with Mel Gibson?  (to google... searching... searching...)  <br/>
Paul Scofield.  He&#39;s tall and English and old.  If he&#39;s also not dead, that <br/>
might make him a candidate.  Alec Guinness is dead, right?  So he&#39;s no good.  <br/>
<br/>
Found some good sites while I was out looking:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We figure they&#39;ll ALL be in it eventually (probably NOT Alec Guinness &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
although not ALL as Dumbledore &lt;g&gt;. We were watching some Brit movie last <br/>
night and got to talking about the actors: we have five more movies and tons <br/>
more characters. Eventually they&#39;ll ALL have some part---they might even run <br/>
out of Brits! &lt;G&gt; Then in Goblet of Fire we need French and German (or <br/>
Poles?). Maybe even a few Americans in later books? <br/>
<br/>
I was bummed at first that John Hurt wasn&#39;t Snape (he&#39;s too short anyway, but <br/>
I&#39;d pictured him as I read it---he can be quite evil. ), but happy to see him <br/>
as Ollivander in the first movie. Then out came Book IV, and he&#39;s there <br/>
again. Oh, and Shyrley---Snape barely makes an appearance in this one! Sorry.<br/>

<br/>
They keep saying &quot;All British cast,&quot; so if they need an American they&#39;ll <br/>
probably get Hugh Grant to do his American accent. &lt;g&gt;    Kenneth Brannagh <br/>
did a great American accent in Dead Again (I found ONE single mistake, and a <br/>
tiny one), but they&#39;ve already used him.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Another tall Brit who came to mind was John Cleese, but then I <br/>
remembered he&#39;s already Nearly Headless Nick.    Also, I think he can&#39;t help <br/>
but be funny.<br/>
<br/>
SHYRLEY!!  Come back here, please and name every tall Brit actor who&#39;s 5&#39;11&quot; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He needs to be taller than the other teachers, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Film him from a lower angle?  And close?  have him hold small props?<br/>
<br/>
He played the ghost in Black Adder&#39;s Christmas Carol, and he also breaks down <br/>
a door and apologizes, like in Harry Potter.  So that was a good little touch <br/>
for those who already were Black Adder fans, for the door to come down just <br/>
that way.<br/>
<br/>
And the new teacher (botanist) was a Black Adder regular too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Captain Hook in the newest Disney/Sony production of Peter Pan. He played <br/>
opposite Mel Gibson in The Patriot, he was a drag queen in Sweet November. He <br/>
was a priest in Neil Jordan&#39;s End of the Affair. and played Lord Felton in <br/>

Mckellan. He&#39;s already used to the beard having been Gandalf. <br/>
Christoper Lee would be too stern I think.<br/>
Richard Attenborough is a possibilty and Richard Briars who I <br/>
desppised in the Good Life but has the right sort of demeanor and <br/>
voice.<br/>
Dunno how tall they all are though.<br/>

    &#39;Harry Potter&#39; actor Richard Harris dies<br/>
-<br/>
<br/>
by Marcus Errico <br/>
Oct 25, 2002, 2:45 PM PT<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Richard Harris, the Irishman known as much for his carousing as for his <br/>
masterful acting in such films as A Man Called Horse and This Sporting Life, <br/>
died Friday after a brief bout with Hodgkin&#39;s disease. He was 72. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;With great sadness, Damian, Jarid and Jamie Harris announced the death of <br/>
their beloved father, Richard Harris,&quot; the actor&#39;s family said in a <br/>
statement. &quot;He died peacefully at University College Hospital.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Word of Harris&#39; death comes less than two weeks after his agent stated Harris <br/>
was responding &quot;extremely well&quot; to chemotherapy at the London hospital. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, the agent said on October 15 that Harris &quot;should be released from <br/>
the clinic soon&quot; and be fully recuperated in time to reprise his role as the <br/>
kindly Professor Albus Dumbledore in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of <br/>
Azkaban, slated to begin shooting in March. <br/>
<br/>
Harris was reportedly hospitalized in August after complaining of a severe <br/>
chest infection. It was then doctors diagnosed the Hodgkin&#39;s, a cancer that <br/>
attacks the body&#39;s lymph nodes.<br/>
<br/>
Harris&#39; condition was serious enough to force the filmmakers of the upcoming <br/>
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, due out November 15, to use a double <br/>
to complete some of the actor&#39;s final scenes. According to British press <br/>
reports, they also began looking for potential replacements to be cast in <br/>
future Harry Potter installments. <br/>
<br/>
Long before assuming Potter duties, Harris gained acting-legend status for <br/>
his intense performance in 1963&#39;s This Sporting Life. His turn as violent <br/>
coal miner Frank Machin earned him a Best Actor Award at the Cannes Film <br/>
Festival and his first of two Best Actor Academy Award nominations. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other key credits include turns as a squadron leader alongside David Niven, <br/>
Gregory Peck and Anthony Quinn in 1961&#39;s The Guns of Navarone and as a <br/>
singing King Arthur in the film version of Camelot, which won him a Golden <br/>
Globe. <br/>
<br/>
But Harris&#39; most popular role (apart from Dumbledore) was John Morgan, an <br/>
English aristocrat captured by Sioux in the franchise-launching surprise 1970 <br/>
hit A Man Called Horse. The film spawned two sequels and later prompted <br/>
Harris to accuse Kevin Costner of swiping scenes from the series for Dances <br/>
with Wolves. <br/>
<br/>
Harris&#39; celluloid résumé also includes the 1962 Marlon Brando version of <br/>
Mutiny on the Bounty and Robin and Marian, in which he costarred with Sean <br/>
Connery and Audrey Hepburn. <br/>
<br/>
Then there were the mid-&#39;70s flops (Orca or Game for Vultures, anyone?) that <br/>
prompted Harris to abandon moviemaking. &quot;I made a decision that half was made <br/>
for me by the motion-picture business,&quot; he once recalled. &quot;Around 1980, I <br/>
decided that was it, my career was really finished. I was doing a series of <br/>
movies I wasn&#39;t happy doing. The standard of the movies was very low. Because <br/>
of what I was offered, I was unhappy.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
He quit Hollywood, toured in a revival of Camelot and stopped working <br/>
altogether by the late &#39;80s. Then Harris made a remarkable comeback, snaring <br/>
a Best Actor Oscar nomination for 1990&#39;s The Field, followed by a supporting <br/>
role as gunslinger English Bob in Clint Eastwood&#39;s 1992 Oscar-winning western <br/>
Unforgiven. <br/>
<br/>
More blockbusters followed, including Gladiator, in which he played Marcus <br/>
Aurelius, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, the first movie <br/>
adventure of J.K. Rowling&#39;s boy wizard. <br/>
<br/>
Harris signed on to play Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore after his young <br/>
granddaughter threatened never to speak to him again if he refused, but he <br/>
wasn&#39;t always so cuddly. <br/>
<br/>
An inveterate hellraiser in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, the actor was once drinking <br/>
buddy to Peter O&#39;Toole and the late Richard Burton. Harris nearly died from a <br/>
cocaine overdose in 1978. (According to one newspaper report, he had been in <br/>
intensive care five times over the years and had been given last rites <br/>
twice.) After his O.D., and under doctors&#39; orders, he gave up his hard-living <br/>
ways in 1982--after downing two bottles of wine first--and had remained clean <br/>
and sober since. <br/>
<br/>
Twice wed, he is survived by his three sons from his first marriage, to <br/>
Elizabeth Rees-Williams.</div>
