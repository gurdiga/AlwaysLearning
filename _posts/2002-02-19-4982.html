<div id="ygrps-yiv-730952708">**Would *limiting* offering new activities to once a week be about the right <br/>
amount to keep from taking charge of their learning?  I would be offering <br/>
these activities with the idea of exposing them to new things. **<br/>
<br/>
Ouch. My head hurts just thinking about this. :)  You&#39;re trying SO hard to <br/>
find a formula you can use to guarantee results. <br/>
<br/>
My opinion, nope, yup, maybe. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So what are you thinking of here? One day a week is marked on the calendar as <br/>
&quot;mom&#39;s activity day&quot;? Or you get to offer an activity any day but then you&#39;re <br/>
done for the week? Or just trying to average things out? What happens when <br/>
there are three great things going on in town on the same weekend that your <br/>
kids won&#39;t know about unless you tell them?<br/>
<br/>
What happens if they don&#39;t respond to what you offer, even after trying it? <br/>
Exposing kids to new things is like exposing them to chicken pox. Sometimes <br/>
they&#39;ll catch them, sometimes they won&#39;t. And the kids should be able to say <br/>
&quot;no thanks&quot; without feeling guilty.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what you mean by &quot;offering&quot; new activities? Places to go, <br/>
people to see, things to do? If it&#39;s just once a week, how do you keep from <br/>
making those things seem more important and compulsory than everything you <br/>
didn&#39;t choose to offer? And how will you deal with rejection?<br/>
<br/>
Some days, we exist in a virtual sea of &quot;new things&quot;, others we&#39;re content <br/>
and snuggled up with the familiar. <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand - &lt;g&gt; it can be a help sometimes to have a plan to always <br/>
get out on the same day every week. When my youngest were smaller it was <br/>
sometimes a real chore to pack everyone up to go ANYWHERE, and so if it <br/>
wasn&#39;t planned it didn&#39;t happen. <br/>
