<br/>
I would say opportunities to be with whomever he wants to be - NOT segerated into teen activities.  Opportunities to mingle and talk with everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Opportunities to game together possibly - board games and electronic - but again not just teens.<br/>

-=-What usually attracts teenagers to unschooling conferences?-=--<br/>
<br/>
Other teenagers.<br/>
But I would advise against trying to attract teenagers just for the  <br/>
sake of having teens there.<br/>
<br/>
One of the worst things about conferences can be the presence and  <br/>
influence of  schooled kids who have just lately become unschoolers  <br/>
and still have the bad habits and disdain and avoidance patterns  <br/>
learned in school.<br/>
<br/>
Encourage families to come.  Encourage families with teens to bring  <br/>
them.  But don&#39;t encourage teens alone.  The problems could outweigh  <br/>
the benefits, I think.  And liabilities (legal, moral) would be a  <br/>
bringdown to the overall burden of the organizers and site owners, too.<br/>
<br/>
If most of the families there have younger kids, that&#39;s the current  <br/>
reality.  If some have older kids, maybe specifically inviting those  <br/>
families and asking various members of the family to run workshops  <br/>
would be a way to persuade them to come.   Subsidizing travel for  <br/>
families wanting to be there (to gain their teens&#39; presence) would  <br/>
help too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The biggest draw for my teen is being with her friends (some of whom  <br/>
she met at previous conferences).<br/>
<br/>
Senna likes the dances okay, but she loves sharing her passions  <br/>
(Pokemon, World of Warcraft). She&#39;s hosted a funshop or two for the  <br/>
last 3 years at Life is Good. She also enjoys performing at the talent  <br/>
shows.<br/>
<br/>
Some teens love little kids (and extra $$), so can&#39;t wait to babysit.  <br/>
Jenny C&#39;s daughter does zombie makeup for anyone who asks. Some want  <br/>
to sell their handmade items at an &quot;Untrepreneurial&quot; table.<br/>
<br/>
I think teens have as many reasons to come to a conference as adults  <br/>
do &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585795078"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-What usually attracts teenagers to unschooling conferences?-=--<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The HSC Conference in Sacrament in August is in its 20th year and always <br/>
has a very very large number of unschooled teens.<br/>
Most of the fun workshops are open to all ages - but there are workshops <br/>
intended specifically for teens such as discussions of controversial <br/>
issues. We have a group of 25 teens who meet throughout the year and <br/>
come up with a lot of their own ideas and sessions. They plan and <br/>
organize the themed dances every night - and that&#39;s a big draw for some <br/>
kids, but not for all. My kids always visit the dances just a bit, but <br/>
don&#39;t get into them much.<br/>
<br/>
If you look at this list and just scroll through it, check the ones that <br/>
say &quot;teen.&quot;   Teens are also welcome at all the other sessions, too. <br/>
There are also things like the art deck (a deck overlooking the lake <br/>
with big tables of art supplies available) and the game deck (lots of <br/>
yu-gi-oh and magic, the gathering, and other game playing going on there <br/>
at all times). There is a papercraft salon - a room dedicated to <br/>
papercrafts like ATCs and more and a fiber-crafts salon. There is also <br/>
the super popular &quot;swap-o-rama-rama&quot; -- piles and piles of used clothing <br/>
and accessories like ribbons and beads. The teens LOVE this - everybody <br/>
picks out clothing and embellishes it. There are people will sewing <br/>
machines and supplies and expertise to help us create what we can imagine.<br/>

I laughed when I read that because my experience is that what attracts teenagers to anything is OTHER teenagers!  Music, dancing, hanging out, video games, all those things might attract more teens.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I&#39;ve seen that!  Other families may not know this and assume this is what unschooled teens are like.  That part of a conference is hard.  It happens with other aged kids too, not just teens, it&#39;s just that the teens are more visible.<br/>

<br/>
What I meant was if a conference wants to attract teens, maybe they  <br/>
could invite some as speakers, or give them a free room, or something.<br/>
<br/>
Some ongoing conferences have a scholarship fund people can apply for,  <br/>
but it probably only covers the registration.  Some conferences offer  <br/>
something for working at the registration table or selling books or  <br/>
some such.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207642685">diane, my daughter was like your daughter 2 years ago.  actually, three Life is Good conferences ago, she was still in school (but her brother was unschooling), and she came to the conference with me.  that year she spent most of her time with our old (always unschooled) friends who were in WA from CA for the conference and didn&#39;t branch out much.  the next year, she came after having been unschooling for only about 7 months, and she dove right in and made connections.  she was still deschooling heavily, and struggling with a lot of leftover issues from her school experiences, as well as from some other things going on in her life, but she was welcomed into the large group of teens, and went home with email and IM and facebook connections and a whole new outlook on life.  then she went to HSC in sacramento, and met  a bunch of new people, and then  &quot;not back to school camp&quot; and reconnected with many of the same people she had met at the conferences.  <br/>
<br/>
she was accepted just as she was, with all her struggles and issues, and as she&#39;s worked through those and found her confidence and self-hood through unschooling, she&#39;s been embraced at each stage of that process.   <br/>
<br/>
I think it can be tricky if a schooled kid is teasing, excluding, or being overtly judgmental of the teens at a conference, but if your daughter is at all open or curious, I think she will find friendly and accepting teens at conferences.    <br/>
<br/>
I will be at hsc with my daughter (15) - introduce yourself! <br/>
<br/>
warmly, lyla<br/>

<br/>
What I said is that it can be a problem.  The question involved a  <br/>
conference in Australia where there hasn&#39;t been such a gathering, and  <br/>
the question of how to attract teens.  I don&#39;t think setting out to  <br/>
attract just any old teens would be a good idea in that situation.  If  <br/>
there aren&#39;t a majority of experienced unschooling teens,  it could be  <br/>
a problem.<br/>
<br/>
At HSC there are MANY longtime unschoolers, and it&#39;s a large  <br/>
established conference.  Very different situation.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your daughter wants to attend.  Some of the kids I&#39;ve seen  <br/>
cause problems in the past were there reluctantly.  the parents wanted  <br/>
to go, but the kids didn&#39;t really want to.  That could happen in  <br/>
Australia, if they press too much to get teens there.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think you want me to give lame, guarded or insincere advice to  <br/>
soothe the feelings of every person on the list.<br/>
<br/>
If your daughter  wanted to leave school, wants to unschool and wants  <br/>
to go to the conference, I don&#39;t think there will be a problem.   But  <br/>
what I think only matters in discussions on this yahoo group, anyway.   <br/>
It&#39;s not my conference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been at over three dozen conferences.  I know of problems with  <br/>
teens at three of them.  There might have been others I didn&#39;t attend.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;is always&quot; a problem.   I said &quot;can be.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She will be fully welcome at the HSC Conference.  There are a whole lot <br/>
of teens - more than a hundred, maybe double that, I don&#39;t really know, <br/>
and it is a really good first conference because there are more <br/>
organized activities for teens than at other conferences and so it is <br/>
easier for new teens to find things to do and meet people, etc.<br/>
<br/>
One thing to consider is that the teens have tremendous freedom - it <br/>
isn&#39;t like school where adults are herding them around and keeping an <br/>
eye on them. They go where they want and do what they want. We trust <br/>
them not to do crazy or stupid things. Sometimes a kid can&#39;t handle that <br/>
kind of freedom without taking advantage of it by behaving <br/>
irresponsibly. I don&#39;t think that problem is limited to schooled kids <br/>
even though they are more prone to it.<br/>
<br/>
I often suggest people bring their teens to the HSC Conference when <br/>
they&#39;ve just started unschooling. I think it is very inspiring for the <br/>
teens and super supportive for them to discover all this big crowd of <br/>
other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
The bigger problem that I see is that it appears to new teens like <br/>
everybody else already knows each other and it can seem really hard to <br/>
sort of break in to a new group. Lots of these kids have been going to <br/>
conference since they were little and they get very excited to see each <br/>
other and they don&#39;t think about the new kids. It is important to go to <br/>
the opening activities where there are ice-breakers and stuff like that, <br/>
if you&#39;re new.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I&#39;m on the HSC Board of Directors and have been to 15 HSC <br/>
conferences plus more than a dozen other conferences.<br/>

<br/>
Conferences are great for new to unschooling teens.  They get a feel of how that feels, what other unschooled teens are like and with the added bonus of meeting new people that could possibly be free to hang out after the conference.<br/>
<br/>
Be with your daughter and be her friend during the conference, help her find peace while there.  What happens sometimes, is that newer to unschooling parents will kind of let their kids go and do and be without much feedback and interaction.  That&#39;s really typical of what schooled parents do with their schooled kids, there is a disconnect between parent and child, something that isn&#39;t the case with unschooled kids that haven&#39;t just been pulled out of school.  Perhaps, think of the conference as something, a thing, that you can bond together with your kid.<br/>
<br/>
If that&#39;s not the case for you and your teen, then go and have fun and be present and be her friend as needed.  If there is a disconnect, like what is so typical, be even more aware of that and help to head of trouble as needed while still allowing for a bit of freedom.  The social dynamics of unschooled teens is so very different than that of schooled teens.  For the most part, unschooled teens are much more accepting of each other, even if they aren&#39;t best buddies. <br/>
