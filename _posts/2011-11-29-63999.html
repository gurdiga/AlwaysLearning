<div id="ygrps-yiv-777102357">My eldest daughter (5) likes being in charge. When she and her sister, 3,<br/>
are playing she likes to dictate how they are going to play together, ie if<br/>
my youngest wants to be a certain character, and my eldest wants to be the<br/>
same character she tells her no, you can&#39;t be whatever, you have to be<br/>
&quot;_______.&quot; I feel like she is bullying her sister, if she doesn&#39;t get her<br/>
way she gets ANGRY, which can be aggressive. She will also change the rules<br/>
to suit her needs. She also doesn&#39;t like to share, whereas our youngest<br/>
readily shares with her, often to eldest&#39;s benefit. She also takes things<br/>
away from her when she wants it.<br/>
<br/>
Over Thanksgiving when my 5 year old was being &quot;mean&quot; to her sister (she<br/>
&quot;accidently&quot; sprayed perfume in her sister&#39;s mouth) my mother wouldn&#39;t let<br/>
her talk to her or even be near her as she didn&#39;t want to be &quot;around mean<br/>
people.&quot; She also told her it wasn&#39;t an accident. I don&#39;t like her<br/>
approach. So I have two questions, 1. handling my mom and 2. effectively<br/>
addressing the play-style/ teaching compassion.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

It sounds like a natural consequence to me, that if someone is mean (perfume doesn&#39;t accidentally spray), that someone else might not want to be around them.<br/>

Explain that to your daughter.  Let your mother make her own decisions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-889238916">True that it wasn&#39;t accidently sprayed, but it was an accident that it hit<br/>
her sister in the face/ mouth. I put mean in quotes because my mother kept<br/>
repeating it over and over, yet I wasn&#39;t convinced she did it on purpose,<br/>
and accidents don&#39;t define someone as mean. It isn&#39;t in her character to<br/>
tell me it was an accident unless it was one. I don&#39;t own perfume, so I<br/>
doubt that she knew where to look for the nozzle.<br/>
<br/>
I do step in, I was wondering if there were things I could say to her to<br/>
help her realize she is being a bully because it doesn&#39;t seem I am being<br/>
effective. I usually say Raev, she can be whomever she wants to be, you<br/>
both can be that character. And similarly when she changes the rules to<br/>
suit her own benefit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-433091467">Are you spending more time with the 3-year-old than the 5-year-old? Is  <br/>
the &quot;baby&quot; the focus? Not just your focus, but your extended family&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
I remember Sandra talking about how she was really resentful of her  <br/>
younger sister - Sandra was &quot;the one&quot; until her sibling arrived. Is  <br/>
there anything like that going on for your eldest?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some one-on-one time with you is what the 5-year-old needs. That  <br/>
could be a good time to talk with her about her feelings (if she can  <br/>
articulate them) or for you to remind her how much you love her, even  <br/>
so she can be the baby again.  It could lessen her need to be mean to  <br/>
get attention.<br/>
<br/>
Sharing everything can be difficult, even for older kids. Does your  <br/>
eldest have some things that are just hers alone? If she&#39;s required to  <br/>
share everything of hers, that can lead to resentment, too.<br/>
<br/>
Meanness and bullying can be a symptom of a child&#39;s needs not being  <br/>
met. Explore that possibility as a way to help her to stop that  <br/>
behavior, in addition to being right there to intervene. Don&#39;t expect  <br/>
your girls to always play happily with each other while you go do  <br/>
something else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-53955153">Stepping in means not being there to start. Be there more. If you are actively playing with your daughters more, if you are engaged with them, it will be easier to help your 5 year old to have a good time with her younger sister. Being with Simon and Linnaea, who are 14 and 11, still makes a difference to how their interactions run. It&#39;s much easier for me to move them away from tension if I&#39;ve been there all along than it is for me to move them from a tense moment when I&#39;m coming in from outside. And it&#39;s fun. I like playing with them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250723839">In addition to intervening and not allowing the older child to dominate the<br/>
younger one, I would recommend recognizing that the older child has the<br/>
urge to be in charge and finding good ways for her to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few people on this list know my daughter, Roya, who is 26 now. She<br/>
was also a bossy 5 year old - bossed around older cousins and younger<br/>
siblings. She still likes to be in charge, but she knows when it is<br/>
appropriate and when it is not. This was a long long process for her to<br/>
learn to channel that urge to run things...it happened slowly and there<br/>
were setbacks, over the years. I understand the urge - I&#39;m a person who<br/>
takes charge, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say get her involved in something like Girl Scouts or 4-H -- or other<br/>
activities where she has a lot of chance to be in a leadership role and to<br/>
allow others to be in leadership roles - Girl Scouts was great for my<br/>
daughter - she learned to be a good leader instead of a demanding boss.<br/>
Help her be in charge of projects. Channel that urge to be bossy into<br/>
leadership and planning.<br/>
<br/>
Roya has a college degree in Recreation - does a lot of organizing events<br/>
and adventures and is in charge of large groups of people - clients and<br/>
employees and volunteers - quite often. She&#39;s now working on becoming a<br/>
family therapist.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying it is okay for the child to be dominating and selfish - but<br/>
that the same urges can be positive, too.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds to me like you&#39;re justifying what your daughter does.<br/>
<br/>
if it&#39;s habitual and she starts to say &quot;accident,&quot; you might want to protect your younger daughter&#39;s safety and space rather than split hairs over what is accident and what is mean.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I don&#39;t own perfume, so I<br/>

<br/>
Did you daughter own perfume, or was it your mom&#39;s?<br/>
That makes a difference in how much it&#39;s your mom&#39;s business, too.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I usually say Raev, she can be whomever she wants to be, you<br/>
both can be that character. And similarly when she changes the rules to<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could address the younger girl and say &quot;Do you want to be [whatever]?&quot; and then turn to the older girl and say &quot;She doesn&#39;t want to play that.  Change the game.&quot;  OR, if you&#39;ve already heard the situation and the exchanges, you could say &quot;Let her pick what she wants to be or don&#39;t play.&quot;  It&#39;s really okay to say &quot;That&#39;s not okay.&quot;  When your younger daughter is being bullied, and you don&#39;t stop it, you&#39;re not being a good mom to her.<br/>
<br/>
Each child should feel safe in her own home.  If one of them is the aggressor, then she IS being mean.    Help her make better choices so that there&#39;s more peace, so her sister is safer, and so she (older daughter) is a better person.<br/>
<br/>
Occasional mean choices don&#39;t make her a mean person, but each bad choice is a bad choice.  Each better choice is better for everyone and for everything.<br/>
<br/>
You daughter is bulling, being angry and aggressive.<br/>
I don&#39;t know her, but her mother wrote this:  &quot;I feel like she is bullying her sister, if she doesn&#39;t get her<br/>
way she gets ANGRY, which can be aggressive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to mull over what people write here a while.  No rush, as it&#39;s a series of little decisions, not any big ones.<br/>
