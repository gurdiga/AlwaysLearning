take a shower or wash my hair  because the water hurt too much. I just <br/>
lay there smelling and looking so much like something from a horror <br/>

utterly repelled and fascinated at the same time.<br/>

amazing?)<br/>

(btw, Eric hadn&#39;t heard anything about red spiders in Australia. As we <br/>
speak, he&#39;s in the air going to Figi. What seems like an incredible <br/>
destination really doesn&#39;t interest him that much at this point. He&#39;s <br/>
sick of warm weather and beaches--true Minnesotan, I guess--and wants to <br/>
come home. but the way his ticket was set up he has to spend a week <br/>
there. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m going to see him next week !  !  !)</div>

actually felt better when the spots came out because the fever and headache<br/>
before it was so bad.<br/>
I am having some kind of reaction to pregnancy right now and have this<br/>
hideous rash over my legs that itches worse than chicken pox! I can&#39;t take<br/>

I used the bath one with my dd when she had chicken pox, she said it made the pox stop itching and stop hurting the best (It also helps to reduce scars). We use the lotion (for itch) for almost all itches. It is so wonderful.<br/>

<br/>
I had camped with a family in central New Mexico (the family of my sponsoring <br/>
teacher while I was student teaching!) and I was twenty.  I saw the mom of <br/>
the family Monday at the university (high school had ended; it was the week <br/>
before finals at the university) and asked her if there were possibly <br/>
chiggers where we camped(In the DIRT!?  I doubted it) and showed her my <br/>
&quot;bites.&quot;   There were only about 12 or 18 of them, on my back and side, which <br/>
seemed insectish.   Oooooh.... she said, sorry; chicken pox.<br/>
<br/>
I was 20 years old.  <br/>
<br/>
My mom had tried to expose me when my sister and cousins had them--three <br/>
cases in the house at once and I played, ate, slept and all with them, but <br/>
missed getting it.<br/>
<br/>
I went to finals anyway, and just sat in the back far from other people.  One <br/>
day I had a message from the health center when I got back from a test saying <br/>
I needed to quarantine myself and not go to classes.  Yeah, right.  I was a <br/>
senior who lived out of town.  I needed to graduate and get out of there.<br/>
<br/>
I never broke out past that one (big, but sparse) patch of pox, so I lucked <br/>
out in that way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All my kids had them naturally at fairly young ages, so they lucked out too.<br/>

classes at univ of TN -- a total of about 380 students! I felt like crap<br/>
and kept wanting to faint and I&#39;ve no idea how many people I infected:)<br/>

in a tube sock, tie a knot in the top and put it into a bath. When you get<br/>
it squishy it gives off a milky liquid that is really soothing. Sometimes I<br/>
race in and stick my legs in the bathtup and &quot;wash&quot; with the oatmeal.<br/>
I&#39;m just at the point of wanting heavy meds to make it go away once and for<br/>
all!<br/>

certain circumstances (like a mild first case.)  I was<br/>
sick like you were and had them in my ears, on my<br/>

Ooooh. This I could understand in some cases. Like when you get a sea <br/>

and neutralize the poison.<br/>
But drink it, yucko. That I could not do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366621263">I have first heard about drinking your first urine of day when I<br/>
was in Brazil, 1000 km fm the Athantic ocean and 60 km fm the<br/>
Paraguay border. It was more than 10 years ago. There was this<br/>
friend of my mother doing it every day.  And she said she was not<br/>
the only one in that community she lived in.  Fm the 60 family of<br/>
Japanese immigrant settlers, she is the only one that still lives<br/>
there and plants coffee beans.  Most of the settlers moved to<br/>
cities to live with their children and the remain 3 other<br/>
families are growing soybeans.  I should remember to ask my<br/>
mother if this friend of her is still drinking the urine.<br/>
<br/>
Then I have heard about this &quot;healthy&quot; rotine many times here in<br/>
Japan too.  I have seen a tribe there in Africa that runs to the<br/>
back of their cows and bulls when they begin to urinate and wash<br/>
their faces and hair.  I can not remember if they drank it.  If<br/>
it is proven that the first urine is good for your healthy I<br/>
might begin doing it.  It costs nothing and it is only a matter<br/>
of acquiring a brand new value.  At least I am glad that I know<br/>
that in I have my own liquid in case of an emergency!<br/>
.......<br/>
dd found my new glasses broken. We were at the grass in front of<br/>
the library enjoying the sunshine. I had paid US$300,00 for the<br/>
glasses.<br/>
I said &quot; I had left them on the top of that heavy bag of books.<br/>
The bag must have been dragged and the glasses must have gone<br/>
under it...&quot;  dd had dragged the bag near her to pick up a book.<br/>
&quot;Whose fault was it?&quot; she asked.<br/>
&quot;What do you think&quot;, I asked.<br/>
&quot;Everybody&quot;, she said.<br/>
&quot;Yes, it was my fault to leave the glasses over the bag and yours<br/>
too for not looking carefully when pulling the bag.&quot; I said.<br/>
We smiled to each other and then I said. &quot;Oh, now we have to go<br/>
to store to have them re-done.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267816633">Well we aren&#39;t in Kashmir but it&#39;s similar weather. It&#39;s &quot;only&quot; about 115<br/>
right now -- really heats up in July and August. We had bad winds yesterday<br/>
and the hot sand was stinging as it hit your face. Completely covering your<br/>
head and face seems like a good idea at times. That was the original reason<br/>
people wore head and face scarves-- now it&#39;s become religious.<br/>
Thanks for thinking of us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730180447">Yes....I thought the weather might be similar, at<br/>
least the temp., just now.  Once June it was 110F for<br/>
a few weeks when I was preganant with DS3, Moses. It<br/>
was easily 120 inside our non-airconditioned house. <br/>
That seemed most unpleasant to me. (I placed a<br/>
tempered glass, of iced tea, on a table....it exploded<br/>
from the contrast of temperatures. Chunks of glass<br/>
everywhere.Big noise, too.) So you anticipate higher<br/>
temps and humidity later? When are you due? Going from<br/>
airconditioning to outdoor heat and back can&#39;t be<br/>
healthy....are you still working at the university? <br/>
How is the rash?  My XDH had an allergy to extreem<br/>
temperatures.  Heat or cold, or more to sudden<br/>
changes. Big itchy hives (welts) they would only last<br/>
a short time, but he was very uncomfortable for a<br/>
while. It was a draft defferment, in the olden days<br/>
when we had a military draft (USA). What did you find<br/>
out about your welts?<br/>
<br/>
We figured that about the scarves.  Similar to food<br/>
prohibitons.  Originally it was something<br/>
needed....then it evolved. <br/>
