<div id="ygrps-yiv-532313916">The problem with what you are saying is that unschooling is about not being <br/>
in school. It is a homeschooling approach. So, while it may have felt like <br/>
you approached your own education as an unschooler, because it had to work <br/>
around and within the framework of a schooled life, it wasn&#39;t unschooling. <br/>
The problem with what Pat Farenga stated is using the phrase &quot;can <br/>
comfortably bear&quot; he is, more than anything else, allowing an individual to <br/>
rest on their laurels. He is giving a stamp of approval to people who say I <br/>
am not comfortable trusting that learning happens, so I pick and choose <br/>
curriculum to use at home. He is giving the stamp of approval to parents who <br/>
say I am not comfortable living a life where my child doesn&#39;t master the <br/>
skill of reading before the age of 9 and so we do worksheets. He is giving <br/>
the stamp of approval to someone who says they are unschooling their <br/>
children who are still in school. Instead of arguing that unschooling is a <br/>
philosophy that helps you to stretch your arms wide and embrace the whole <br/>
world as learning, he is shrinking it to fit any parent&#39;s choices.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t unschool your children. You may have given them great <br/>
opportunities by traveling and by exploring the world with them, but you <br/>
didn&#39;t unschool them. Every day you put them in school you told them that <br/>
they needed to have someone else tell them what was important to understand <br/>
the world. And while they may have had the most amazing of vacations and <br/>
while they may have had a great time in Turkey, they still spent far more <br/>
time in school.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why you need to think you were unschooled or that you <br/>
unschooled your children. Unschooling is a pretty specific subset of <br/>
homeschooling. You don&#39;t gain anything by being called an unschooler except <br/>
whatever it is that you get inside. If I put my kids in school, even if it <br/>
as their behest, I am no longer unschooling, I am schooling them. Even if <br/>
they take school on their own terms, they are choosing that life over an <br/>
unschooled life. And while I love being an unschooling family, it isn&#39;t more <br/>
essential that I be able to define myself as such than that Simon and <br/>
Linnaea get to live the lives they want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019152194">-=-This is the most telling statement I&#39;ve seen in a homeschool list.<br/>
Unschooling is not a matter of where its done. It is a matter of what<br/>
is done. It is a mindset, not a way of teaching.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a way of teaching, that&#39;s true.  But it&#39;s not just &quot;whatever.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Pat Farenga inherited John Holt&#39;s mantle.  It could never really fit  <br/>
him, because he didn&#39;t have Holt&#39;s experiences or writing abilities.   <br/>
Then Pat&#39;s wife couldn&#39;t comfortably unschool.  Marrying someone who  <br/>
works in a place that sells books about unschooling isn&#39;t the same as  <br/>
really wanting to learn about how learning works on one&#39;s own.  They  <br/>
also have the added difficulty of living in that high-pressure  <br/>
environment (Boston, in their case) where pre-school is the norm, and  <br/>
both parents employeed is standard.  Rather than say &quot;I don&#39;t know,  <br/>
we didn&#39;t really unschool,&quot; he redefined unschooling to match what  <br/>
they did.  All three of their children went to school some of the  <br/>
time, and some of the time were back home.  I don&#39;t know the details  <br/>
of that, but I first read it in The Old Schoolhouse Magazine.  He  <br/>
wasn&#39;t admitting it when he spoke at conferences, as far as I knew.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This may explain why I am sometimes a bit short with paranoid<br/>
homeschoolers who think there is only one way to homeschool and<br/>
denigrate andy other options to public schooling.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You can be all the short you want to be.  If you&#39;re not unschooling,  <br/>
if you don&#39;t really understand unschooling and you haven&#39;t done it,  <br/>
then  your opinion is small in an unschooling forum.  You don&#39;t have  <br/>
the experience to really help others understand unschooling if you  <br/>
don&#39;t understand it and haven&#39;t done it yourself.   I don&#39;t even go  <br/>
into Toyota repair discussions because I&#39;ve never even owned a  <br/>
Toyota, let alone repaired one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So it&#39;s<br/>
not &quot;hard to distinguish unschoolers from anyone else&quot; -- the mindset<br/>
set is rare and sets them apart -- there aren&#39;t many of them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if there are many of them, but none of them are  <br/>
found in public schools.  Once they opt to go to school, they&#39;re  <br/>
enrolled in school and NOT learning in the absence of school.  Once  <br/>
they go to school-at-home (a formal curriculum), they&#39;re not  <br/>
unschooling anymore.<br/>
<br/>
If someone whose kids went to school disagrees with me about what  <br/>
unschooling is, and I&#39;m writing as someone whose children never did  <br/>
go to school (the youngest is 15, so she has time to go if she wants  <br/>
to, at which point our family&#39;s unschooling would be  something we  <br/>
did, not something we&#39;re doing), then it&#39;s up to each reader to  <br/>
decide for him- or herself which of us to regard as more experienced.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Roya (22) was schooled for five years (k-4) and Roxana (19) went to  <br/>
school for 2 years (k/1) and both then unschooled after that. Rosie  <br/>
never went to school. When they were being schooled, we did what Bill  <br/>
wants to include as &quot;unschooling,&quot; but I would describe as  <br/>
&quot;enrichment.&quot; Also, Roya went to a relatively unconventional school  <br/>
that had no textbooks or tests or grades, and Roxana was in an even  <br/>
more experimental program that allowed tremendous freedom of choice.  <br/>
So, they were perhaps &quot;less schooled&quot; than many schooled kids, but it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t unschooling. Schooling can vary a lot - from &quot;free schools&quot; to  <br/>
&quot;back-to-basics fundamental schools,&quot; but even the free schools are  <br/>
not the same as unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It does get a little tricky deciding, as the kids grow up, when  <br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; stops and &quot;schooling&quot; begins, if they use the local  <br/>
community college for tap dancing, voice, acting, guitar, piano, or  <br/>
ballet lessons, as my kids have all done. I definitely still consider  <br/>
my 15 yo to be an unschooler, she is not taking those classes as part  <br/>
of a &quot;college program of study,&quot; but in the exact same way that she  <br/>
takes karate classes at a karate studio or her friend takes dance at  <br/>
a dance studio.<br/>
<br/>
It gets more tricky when they decide to also add what would be  <br/>
considered college &quot;academic&quot; courses to what they take at the  <br/>
community college. If Rosie signs up for an English class, is she  <br/>
suddenly no longer unschooling? Why is that different than taking a  <br/>
dance or karate class? She&#39;s a true unschooler and does not think of  <br/>
&quot;writing&quot; as any different than art or sports. I think she&#39;ll still  <br/>
be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
They are &quot;college students&quot; and not &quot;unschooling&quot; anymore, though,  <br/>
once they are more conventionally &quot;doing college,&quot; as Roxana and Roya  <br/>
are both doing, these days. They are not choosing to take college  <br/>
classes because they want to dance or throw pottery or write poetry,  <br/>
but because they are fulfilling requirements for earning a degree.  <br/>
Yes, they are choosy and try to take courses that interest them. Yes,  <br/>
they are different than other students in that they LOVE learning and  <br/>
making all those connections between what is taught in their classes  <br/>
to the other knowledge they already have picked up. Yes, they are  <br/>
different than most other college students in some undefinable ways -  <br/>
primarily because they aren&#39;t viewing the educational system through  <br/>
the veil of resentment and resistance and passivity that so many  <br/>
college students wear.<br/>
<br/>
Even though my older kids are no longer &quot;unschooling,&quot; I think they  <br/>
will always consider themselves to be &quot;unschoolers&quot; - they are  <br/>
adamant about that - they feel like unschooling has made them  <br/>
different than other young adults and they still self-identify as  <br/>
unschoolers. They believe that the crux of unschooling is that  <br/>
learning is life, that all learning counts, that learning in a  <br/>
classroom is not a particularly good way to learn and most definitely  <br/>
not where most significant learning occurs. They believe that  <br/>
compulsory education is an oxymoron - that nobody CAN be forced to  <br/>
learn anything (Can they be coerced into memorizing and  <br/>
regurgitating? Yes. But, real learning? No.). They do not confuse  <br/>
what they sometimes do to earn grades in their college classes with  <br/>
&quot;real learning.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
When I was in college, after 11 years of public school (no  <br/>
kindergarten, and I left a year early), I took classes because I  <br/>
wanted to throw pottery and play recorder.  I took lots of classes  <br/>
that I knew at the time wouldn&#39;t contribute to my getting a degree  <br/>
any faster.  One on decoding (a seminar given by a former army  <br/>
intelligence guy), one on English and American folksong (which I knew  <br/>
as much about as the professor, but that was part of the point of the  <br/>
seminar).<br/>
<br/>
I loved learning and started making all KINDS of connections between  <br/>
what I&#39;d learned in one class and another and in stoner conversations  <br/>
in high school and in movies and song lyrics.  I LOVED being at the  <br/>
university for the opportunity to meet people from other places, from  <br/>
other social strata (I grew up in a poor town in northern New  <br/>
Mexico), who had done and seen things never available to me in any  <br/>
way when I was growing up.<br/>
<br/>
None of that made me an  unschooler.  It made me someone who was  <br/>
curious and creative and loved learning and didn&#39;t wait to be  <br/>
spoonfed.  But I was schooled.  And I was paying for more school, so  <br/>
that I could go out and be a teacher and try to make schools better.<br/>
<br/>
School was my life.  I knew school could be more fun.  I was at the  <br/>
university paying to sit in a chair and read school reformers and  <br/>
take notes and take tests and write papers on how that kind of school  <br/>
wasn&#39;t the best way to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I had mined 4-H and girl scouts and church for learning.  I was going  <br/>
to two churches at the same time for a few years--9:30 at the  <br/>
Catholic Church doing guitar mass, and then over to my real church  <br/>
for 11:00 service.  I was fifteen when I started asking questions  <br/>
about religion and the Bible that the minister and priest had never  <br/>
considered and couldn&#39;t answer.<br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t make me an unschooler.  That made me a seeker of wisdom,  <br/>
but I was asking priests and ministers.<br/>
<br/>
My kids were unschooled.  It was different.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That is a great big thing, about Pam&#39;s girls.<br/>
They have a deep, deep confidence.<br/>
My kids have that too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I need to clarify - Roya and Roxana both STILL choose to enroll in a  <br/>
number of college courses even though the course isn&#39;t required as  <br/>
part of their program. I don&#39;t want to leave the impression that they  <br/>
only take classes that are required to earn a degree.<br/>
<br/>
So, anyway, I wasn&#39;t saying that it IS unschooling when college  <br/>
students take courses just because they want to and not for the  <br/>
purpose of earning their degree. What I was saying was that Roya and  <br/>
Roxana ceased to be unschooling when they started taking courses in  <br/>
order to fulfill college requirements. The essence of schooling is  <br/>
that someone else determines what the student must &quot;learn,&quot; and then  <br/>
tells them when they&#39;ve learned enough to graduate. As soon as Roya  <br/>
and Roxana were part of that kind of system, then I wouldn&#39;t say they  <br/>
were unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
But, if you ask them, they will still say they are unschoolers.  <br/>
They&#39;ll say they can never be anything else. They&#39;ve got something in  <br/>
their heads about what they mean by this and it is hard for me to  <br/>
articulate. They will NEVER see the world in the same way that people  <br/>
who were schooled see it. The unschooling attitude about life and  <br/>
learning is an integral part of themselves, not something they  <br/>
figured out (like we did). They lived it and they ARE it, in some way  <br/>
that is permanent.<br/>
<br/>
Aha - it is like the difference, in Spanish, between &quot;estar&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;ser.&quot; We say, &quot;You are an unschooler when you&#39;re school-age and not  <br/>
being schooled.&quot; We&#39;re using &quot;estar&quot; - &quot;Tu estas una unschooler.&quot; But  <br/>
they are saying, &quot;I AM an unschooler now and forever.&quot; &quot;Yo SOY una  <br/>
unschooler.&quot;<br/>
