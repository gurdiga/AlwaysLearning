&lt;&lt;&lt;When Keith and I were young, early 20&#39;s, he wasn&#39;t a good  speller and <br/>
I didn&#39;t know the times tables up around and among 6, 7 and 8.  We <br/>
made a deal that we would never shame the other or explain, just  <br/>
spell or give a number. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That reminds me of times before *our* kids came along. Dave&#39;s forte is more  <br/>
along the engineering scale: math, equations, memorization of formulas, how to <br/>
 build things, how to take things apart. My forte is more along the words  <br/>
spectrum: putting words together in a pleasing way, telling stories, spelling,  <br/>
definitions. I have a habit of speaking (and writing) words that specifically  <br/>
fit into what I&#39;m trying to say and I&#39;ve always admired Dave&#39;s ability to say <br/>
 things simply and directly (where I tend to run off into tangents, get <br/>
caught up  in explinations and specifics)... for example, I might say, &quot;The mundane <br/>
nature  of his exsitence left him empty and wanting&quot; (okay, I might not <br/>
actually *speak*  that, but it is definitely along the lines of how I write) and <br/>
Dave would say,  &quot;He&#39;s bored.&quot; The simplicity of that not only impresses me, but <br/>
I&#39;m a  little jelous sometimes! Those kinds of words are just in my nature. <br/>
So, often  when we *first* were married, Dave would nod as if he understood <br/>
when I&#39;d say  some things he wouldn&#39;t really be clear on. I didn&#39;t know. After we <br/>
were married  long enough that he knew he could trust me not to make fun of <br/>
his &quot;lack of  understanding&quot; (he had a lot of being made fun of before we <br/>
met-by family  mostly), he came up with a way to gently let me know he didn&#39;t <br/>
understand some  word I used without actually saying, &quot;I don&#39;t know that word&quot;-in a <br/>
way, &quot;saving  face&quot; while still letting me know he wasn&#39;t clear. We&#39;d heard a <br/>
comedian do  something similar and we thought it was pretty funny, so he&#39;d <br/>
take to saying,  &quot;Mundane. How do you spell that?&quot; with a big grin on his face, <br/>
then I&#39;d know and  I&#39;d rephrase. He doesn&#39;t say that much anymore. I don&#39;t <br/>
know if he understands  more of the language I use or if I&#39;ve learned from him <br/>
how to simplify, but I  kind of miss that &quot;private joke&quot; kind of thing we used <br/>
to share all the time. I  also ask him to double-check my math, but that&#39;s not <br/>
really a fun, private joke  kind of thing. :~)<br/>
 <br/>
As I was sitting here thinking of searching dictionaries, Google, people  and <br/>
other sources for information, a term popped up in my head, &quot;hedonistic  <br/>
learner&quot;. That&#39;s what I am. Is it by nature or by nurture or both? I don&#39;t know.  <br/>
I do know that I have loved looking things up as long as I can remember and <br/>
that  I&#39;ve loved listening to folks tell their stories (like, &quot;I remember when I <br/>
was a  kid, candy bars were five cents. And they were bigger than they are <br/>
now...) for  as long as I can remember. Or maybe &quot;hedonistic <br/>
information-seeker&quot;. I don&#39;t  know. I just know that I love to learn and I hope that whatever it <br/>
is-nurture or  nature-that my kids &quot;get it&quot;, too!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
