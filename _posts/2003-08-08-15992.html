<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685584165">Hi Joylyn,<br/>
<br/>
I thought about a tape recorder next to the phone for her to use. She knows who it is and is capable of taking a message. She could talk into the recorder then spend more time on the message off the phone. Also Tucks idea is good, though it leaves her without the ability to actually learn to take real messages. <br/>
<br/>
I have a question, can Lexi read her own handwriting?<br/>
<br/>
We spend alot of time drawing from various childrens drawing books. Drawing with Chlidren, and all the Ed. (I forget his long last name.) books. He writes the Purple Book of Drawing. The Big Orange Book of Drawing. More Ed ...Book of Drawing and more I think. Also the Usborne I Can Crayon, and I Can Draw. These books are fun fine motor practice books. Even when Riley was 4 he could sketch out things he was happy with. Writing really is an art form, differing shapes in space.<br/>
