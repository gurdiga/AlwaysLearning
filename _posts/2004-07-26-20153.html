Because at that time in TVLand, a peck on the cheek was all the enjoyment a <br/>
guy could have with his hot wife.  <br/>
**************************************<br/>
And yet, just a little earlier, there was the Dick Van Dyke Show. There&#39;s the <br/>
great episode where Rob and Laura get off for an evening at a fancy hotel. <br/>
It&#39;s all about sex, or at least its anticipation. They flirt...they explore the <br/>
room (At one point, while cuddling on a chaise lounge with Laura, Rob looks <br/>
around and says, &quot;This place has some neat spaces!&quot;), then Laura goes into the <br/>
bathroom for a bath, where her toe gets stuck in the faucet. Most of the <br/>
episode is very conscious that she&#39;s behind that door....naked. (Hmm...maybe that&#39;s <br/>
just me....)<br/>
<br/>
They had separate beds at home, but you could tell they did it.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn, who wonders why she&#39;s speculating on the sex lives of 60&#39;s fictional <br/>
characters<br/>

Hey, Ozzie and Harriet definitely did it, at least twice.<br/>
<br/>
Beaver&#39;s parents too.  (Oh wait--those are 50&#39;s.)<br/>
<br/>
By the 70s, The Brady Bunch, they were unquestionably doing it, in a kingsize <br/>
bed, right?<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the greatest (meaning big-worst) impediments to sex lives in <br/>
those older days HAD to be curlers.  Lots of women wore curlers to bed.  And <br/>
that&#39;s not attractice, nor comfortable, nor sexy.  Perms probably did more for <br/>
active sexuality than anything for years had (except the stench, those first <br/>
few days).  Then the hippies didn&#39;t bother with curlers or perms either one.<br/>

Not necessarily---the kids were all from PREvious marriages. Carol  and Mike <br/>
maybe NEVER did!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

downstairs so they had even MORE time together.<br/>

Wasn&#39;t that the first show where viewers actually saw the married couple in the same bed together?   <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe all the TV rules are why so many people who grew up then have this idea that their parents never had sex?  It&#39;s been a long-running joke here that Gary must have been conceived on a handshake, because he just knows his parents never did it!  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>

Right----but there was never &quot;living proof&quot;: like Wally and the Beaver or  <br/>
like Rickie   and the other one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

But they had The Pill, like my mother did, not long after I was born in the  <br/>
mid-60s&#39;.  (I was born in &#39;62, but my mother didn&#39;t get the pill until  around <br/>
&#39;65.  Took her that long to find a non-Catholic doctor in  Chicago who would <br/>
prescribe it for her.)<br/>
 <br/>
My mom used to give her friends perms and haircuts at our dining table also  <br/>
in the &#39;60s and I remember really wanting to be absent those days!<br/>
