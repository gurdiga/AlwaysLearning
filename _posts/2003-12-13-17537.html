<div id="ygrps-yiv-922135155">earlier this year Lexie was taking quizzes on books she had read.  She <br/>
really enjoyed taking these tests (as much as I found the idea silly) <br/>
but when we moved to our new computer, we lost the link.  I can&#39;t find <br/>
it.  I have googled and searched and can&#39;t find it.  Does anyone know <br/>
what webpage I&#39;m talking about?<br/>
