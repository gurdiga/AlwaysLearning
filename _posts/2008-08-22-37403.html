<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435855542">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lurker from way back and while I was only able to squeeze in a<br/>
few years of unschooling with my youngest before she went to college,<br/>
I embrace the principles in my heart and hope my future grandkids can<br/>
one day benefit from all the fine work you do every day.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son ended up creating his own way through the college<br/>
conundrum studying art and computers.  Three schools and three<br/>
different cities and various types of classes and many years later he<br/>
has recently landed at Jim Henson studios.  It has been very exciting<br/>
and he&#39;s working on a new show called Sid the Science Kid.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about a bunch of very multicultural kids who ask questions<br/>
all day and are encouraged to find their own answers.  I hope you&#39;ll<br/>
check it out.  It premieres on Sept. 1st, Labor Day.<br/>
Here&#39;s the website link for the show to play games and such:<br/>

Have fun and thank-you for your brilliant advice giving.<br/>
always learning,<br/>
