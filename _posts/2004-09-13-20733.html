<div id="ygrps-yiv-254209889">I was wondering what folks did here when their childrens speech development was seemingly slower than peers ? Her Doctor addressed this as a concern at her last well baby and she was evaluated by a therapist that found her in the low end of acceptable speech, my husbands family is allways telling me to do somthing about this so called problem. Strangers allways think she is2yo. She was born with a club foot and had some physical therapy from delayed development.My child is 3 and she understands a great deal and can read some. When she speaks she uses usually uses1,2,or 3 words at a time. She seems to enjoy being quiet and will go through long sittings while reading childrens novels. We have many family members that remark about her perhaps problem. She seems so happy that it is hard for me to consider it a problem. She definitely has problems  with c&#39;s, ch&#39;s, sh&#39;s, r&#39;s, l&#39;s and s&#39;s and i think thats it, but my nephew is 5 and has problems with the same sounds and so does half the kids in his class. I am going to bring her to her well baby exam in a couple of months where it is sure to come up so i am just looking for a heads up what to expect. Kids in our area that are 3yo and have speech development are put into school earlier and everyone thinks that is so lovely but i am allready on the path of learning with her and my other child and we all really are enjoying ourselves, i dont really see how putting her in school will help, but i thats just what people usually do. When my son was her age the doctor sugjested speech therapy and early school but i just declined and he just really took off speechwise with out any ouside help, but he did not have any problems with making sounds he was just shy around strangers. I dont want to dismiss any possible genuine problems but i dont want to get caught up what people usually do because it is just how things work in the school system which we are not apart of and the medical world is not acustomed to that perhaps. I was wondering if anybody had any books to sugjest with tounge  twisters to help her work on those particular sounds. Or if their may be any genuine concerns that i can talk to the doctor about. She had her tounge clipped once to help with nursing, maybe we need to be referred to a ENT again for another tounge evaluation. Maybe some kind of massage therapy ? I know these 2 are not usually mainstream but our doctor is pretty good about giving referrals for things she would not nessisariy sugjest herself, so i am trying to find out as much as possible before our next appointment. I would greatly appreciate it if anyone shared their personal experience with this matter.</div>

<br/>
If he had no problems, but speech therapy was recommended, perhaps you&#39;re misremembering?<br/>
And if his speech took off on its own, your daughter&#39;s probably will too, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
<br/>
-=- I was wondering if anybody had any books to sugjest with tounge twisters to help her work on those particular sounds. Or if their may be any genuine concerns that i can talk to the doctor about.-=-<br/>
<br/>
At three, no.  If she&#39;s seven or eight and can&#39;t make those sounds, then there are games to play, but if she&#39;s not in school (so that kids won&#39;t tease her or teachers won&#39;t be pressuring her), why the rush?  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well baby&quot; visits can be problematical all on their own.  Why would well babies need doctors? <br/>
Doctors will make more money if they can find problems, though.<br/>
<br/>

Holly couldn&#39;t pronounce &quot;r&quot; when she was seven, but can now.<br/>
Kirby couldn&#39;t say &quot;k&quot; and pronounced his name &quot;Tirby&quot; for a few years.<br/>
<br/>
Kids figure those things out gradually, and develop the ability to do tricker things as they get older.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If she&#39;s not getting frustrated, then I&#39;d certainly wait. There&#39;s a lot of variation in when kids are able to make all the speech sounds clearly - and kids often develop coping mechanisms in the short term, which they drop naturally once they can make all the sounds they want to. They Want to sound like everyone else! <br/>
<br/>
If she was getting frustrated I might look at therapy as a way for her to feel more in control - although honestly *I* would look online and try to get an idea of what kinds of things a therapist would ask her to do and come up with some games or exercises at home. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;She definitely has problems  with c&#39;s, ch&#39;s, sh&#39;s, r&#39;s, l&#39;s and s&#39;s and i think thats it, but my nephew is 5 and has problems with the same sounds and so does half the kids in his class. <br/>
 </span></blockquote>***************<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good picture of why speech therapy can be a waste of time - so many speech issues are purely developmental, but nowadays parents and teachers want to Do something to try to fix or hurry along natural development. The best that can be said about most speech therapy is that it gets kids out of class ;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I dont want to dismiss any possible genuine problems...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t fall prey to the warnings that you Have to start Now or she&#39;ll Never Learn - that&#39;s the big scare tactic all and sundry pull on nervous parents. If she&#39;s not frustrated with her speech, don&#39;t fuss. Don&#39;t Make her frustrated with something she may not be able to control just yet. You&#39;ve seen for yourself that older kids have the same issues, so wait and see. Lots of 3yos still aren&#39;t speaking at all - and a &quot;3 word utterance&quot; is perfectly reasonable to expect from a reasonably verbal 3yo. <br/>

Oh yes! Think of all the kids who get nicknames because a sibling can&#39;t pronounce their name - or they can&#39;t pronounce their own. Neither my brother nor I could pronounce &quot;Meredith&quot; for years, between the &quot;r&quot; in the middle and the &quot;th&quot; at the end, and we both got a kick out of trying to get the neighbor kids to say &quot;Massachusetts&quot; when we moved to the west coast - ch and then the tt at the end made it a tongue twister for all the younger kids on the block (and came out &quot;massa-two-tits&quot; so it was great naughty humor). And some grandparents get nicknames for the same reason - a personal favorite is my friend&#39;s mom, who got tagged with &quot;mucker&quot; when her first grandchild couldn&#39;t say &quot;grandmother&quot;. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In my husband&#39;s family, we had &quot;Grape-Nanny&quot; and &quot;Bumpa&quot; because one  <br/>
of my nephews couldn&#39;t say either &quot;Great-Nanny&quot; or &quot;Grandpa&quot;. We all  <br/>
called them by those names, after that!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter didn&#39;t talk much at all at 3. When she did talk, a lot of  <br/>
her words were as close an approximation as she could muster:  <br/>
&quot;ogrehogger&quot; for motorcycle (which I suppose might fit for Harley  <br/>
riders), &quot;caggerpigger&quot; for caterpillar, &quot;neenie&quot; for chicken (not  <br/>
sure exactly where that came from). She&#39;d say &quot;wan you&quot; for thank you.<br/>
<br/>
Around that time, I read a book about late-talking children which  <br/>
correlated science/math facility with late talking, positing that  <br/>
different areas of the brain can sometimes mature faster; often the  <br/>
language part would lag behind when the math part was operating at  <br/>
full tilt. Though this wasn&#39;t especially true for my daughter, it did  <br/>
ease my mind that kids have their own timetable for walking, talking,  <br/>
reading and more. And when I look back on it, Senna has been a &quot;late  <br/>
bloomer&quot; in just about every respect.<br/>
<br/>
Now, at 16, Senna speaks perfectly well, with a huge vocabulary and  <br/>
excellent comprehension. She reads, writes, and talks a blue streak at  <br/>
every opportunity &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S. I also remember hearing stories about my dad not being able to  <br/>
say the &quot;st&quot; or &quot;sm&quot; sounds when he was 3. There was no speech therapy  <br/>
in England in 1921 and he eventually spoke the Queen&#39;s English  <br/>
wonderfully with no remediation.</div>

Holly was a preemie, and that can cause delays.   She&#39;s quite &quot;mathish,&quot; though, and though not left handed as her dad and brother Marty are, she has their spatial and math skills.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-806970943">My daughter is adopted from Ethiopia. She joined our family when she was 5 months old. Still it appears to be common for adopted children no matter what age they come home to be &quot;delayed&quot; in some way. At 3 years old my daughter could only put 2 word sentences together. We took her for a few speech therapy sessions but it didn&#39;t jive with my unschooling philosophy so we stopped. She is now 5 and we can&#39;t get her to stop talking! lol. I would say compared to other 5 year old she still has some pronunciation issues but otherwise she talks up a storm. I think speech is one of those issue&#39;s like reading, if you child doesn&#39;t do when &quot;they&quot; say the child should be, we start to panic. But how many adults do you see walking around who cannot speak? Back in the day people just waited for their kids to start talking and they all did. There was no speech therapy back when my mom was a kid. In fact my grandmother tells a story of my uncle who didn&#39;t speak a word until he was 5. Then one day just started talking. <br/>
<br/>
I also wanted to say something about well baby visits. When I had my first son, almost 12 years ago I took him for all the well baby visits, and all those well baby visits did was cause me to stop nursing early, start food too early, diagnose ear infections that I doubt he ever had and cause me stress. I didn&#39;t take any of my other children to well baby visits and low and behold I was able to nurse them all (even my adopted daughter), I started food when THEY were ready, None of them has ever had an ear infection or even been on antibiotics, and no stress. I know that my baby is well. I spend every moment with them. How on earth can a doctor who is seeing them for maybe 10 minutes going to be able to tell me that my baby is well??</div>

<br/>
When I had my first son, 25 years ago, I took him for all the well baby visits.  Our pediatrician had posters and flyers all over his office for ear tubes, for treatment for ear infection that involved putting a little spoolie opening in a perfectly good ear drum.   I would take Kirby in fine and healthy (well), and because this tall, unfamiliar man would pick him up and talk to him with a funny accent (Texas), Kirby would cry.  Because Kirby would cry, the insides of his ears would get red.  And this, the doctor assured me two different times, was a definite sign of an ear infection.  But I said no, he&#39;s crying and that makes his whole head red eventually.  And they won&#39;t be red when we leave and he calms down.<br/>
<br/>
The worst thing that was happening to him was he was going to the doctor.  Otherwise, he WAS a well baby.  And when he wasn&#39;t, I sometimes took him to the doctor.  And sometimes I opted not to.  I held him through what seemed to be meningitis because the hospital was willing only to do a spinal tap on a five year old to see whether it was bacterial or viral.  I asked why it mattered, and they said antibiotics would cure bacterial, but not viral.  I said well then give him antibiotics.  They said not without a spinal tap.  I asked what if it WAS viral?  &quot;It&#39;s not viral.&quot;  How did they know?  &quot;If it was viral, he would be dead by now.&quot;   Then it&#39;s bacterial, right?  &quot;We&#39;d have to do a spinal tap.&quot;   So I risked holding him with 105 fever, being delirious and limp, rather than let illogical, cold-hearted people use him a a test rat in a risky experiment.  <br/>
<br/>
I called a friend of mine who was an emergency room doctor in another state, in hopes that he would tell me something I could use.   He very VERY condescendingly said, &quot;Now, mother...&quot; and tried to shame me into just doing what the doctors wanted to do.   I never spoke to him again.   <br/>
<br/>
Kirby lived.  He can pronounce his name perfectly well.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657607306">Caitlyn is almost 5 and struggles with having people understand her including her dad. I sometimes have trouble but usually I can figure it out because we are together all the time and if I can&#39;t then she describes whatever word I can&#39;t get. I have attributed a lot of this to the fact that we are multilingual at home. Even though she is not speaking French much, she hears it from her dad almost exclusively and we often play with Spanish and other languages because she&#39;s very interested in other languages. Interestingly when she says a word in French it is purely accentless but I&#39;ve had people tell me that her English sounds like has a French accent. Who knows but whatever it is I think that it may be part or why her speech development has been slower. It&#39;s fine for us but she often gets very frustrated when people don&#39;t understand her. She&#39;s never been really talkative to other people only opening up in the last year or so. When people don&#39;t understand her we&#39;ve been working towards alleviating the frustration by either me telling them what she&#39;s saying or her trying to reword it which has helped a bit. There have been a few times that it&#39;s been suggested that we should take her to a speech therapist but we believe that eventually her speech will become clearer but it will be in her time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, we also skipped well baby visits. The only couple of times we went were either very traumatic (emergency room visit with the croup where we had to hold her down so they could xray her lungs - not something we wanted to repeat again) and a doc visit where he told us he thought it was something in the air making her sinusy and she was actually sick...Otherwise we didn&#39;t want her compared to some development chart to tell us she was &quot;progressing&quot; appropriately for her age. <br/>

&gt; -=When I had my first son, almost 12 years ago I took him for all the well baby visits, and all those well baby visits did was cause me to stop nursing early, start food too early, diagnose ear infections that I doubt he ever had and cause me stress. I didn&#39;t take any of my other children to well baby visits and low and behold I was able to nurse them all (even my adopted daughter), I started food when THEY were ready, None of them has ever had an ear infection or even been on antibiotics, and no stress. I know that my baby is well. I spend every moment with them. How on earth can a doctor who is seeing them for maybe 10 minutes going to be able to tell me that my baby is well?? -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I had my first son, 25 years ago, I took him for all the well baby visits.  Our pediatrician had posters and flyers all over his office for ear tubes, for treatment for ear infection that involved putting a little spoolie opening in a perfectly good ear drum.   I would take Kirby in fine and healthy (well), and because this tall, unfamiliar man would pick him up and talk to him with a funny accent (Texas), Kirby would cry.  Because Kirby would cry, the insides of his ears would get red.  And this, the doctor assured me two different times, was a definite sign of an ear infection.  But I said no, he&#39;s crying and that makes his whole head red eventually.  And they won&#39;t be red when we leave and he calms down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The worst thing that was happening to him was he was going to the doctor.  Otherwise, he WAS a well baby.  And when he wasn&#39;t, I sometimes took him to the doctor.  And sometimes I opted not to.  I held him through what seemed to be meningitis because the hospital was willing only to do a spinal tap on a five year old to see whether it was bacterial or viral.  I asked why it mattered, and they said antibiotics would cure bacterial, but not viral.  I said well then give him antibiotics.  They said not without a spinal tap.  I asked what if it WAS viral?  &quot;It&#39;s not viral.&quot;  How did they know?  &quot;If it was viral, he would be dead by now.&quot;   Then it&#39;s bacterial, right?  &quot;We&#39;d have to do a spinal tap.&quot;   So I risked holding him with 105 fever, being delirious and limp, rather than let illogical, cold-hearted people use him a a test rat in a risky experiment.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I called a friend of mine who was an emergency room doctor in another state, in hopes that he would tell me something I could use.   He very VERY condescendingly said, &quot;Now, mother...&quot; and tried to shame me into just doing what the doctors wanted to do.   I never spoke to him again.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kirby lived.  He can pronounce his name perfectly well.  <br/>

Most children don&#39;t master sh, ch and th until they&#39;re 4.5 years or older. It&#39;s &quot;normal&quot; for l&#39;s to not be mastered until age 6. <br/>
