insure your purchases. Then I started asking co-workers and friends <br/>
about this program and to my surprise 6 out of the 10 people that I <br/>
spoke with were already using this program. They told me how pleased <br/>
they were with it and how much money they had saved and are currently <br/>
saving. So I decided to sign up for this program on 11/20/02. On <br/>
11/25/02 I received my complete membership package and the fun began. <br/>
Using their program and the free lifetime membership that it includes <br/>
I went to the supermarket ready to make a killing. The cashier rang <br/>
up my grocery bill and it came out to $ 239.87 then I presented her <br/>
with the coupons I received from this program and I saved $ 213.38 - <br/>
my final bill was only $ 26.49! The cashier wasn&#39;t the only one <br/>
shocked. I want to thank that person so much for this amazing tip!</div>
