I think that writing ought to be reserved for those<br/>
who have something to say.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And this is the place!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re talking about real things for real purposes, and we&#39;re doing it in <br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t have my feelings hurt in the tirade against grammar teachers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was just pushing back against an argument with the counter argument.  It <br/>
was purely business/logic, and not personal.  I&#39;m fine, and it does help for <br/>
people who have big teacher-resentment to hear the other side.<br/>
<br/>
I have to drive to another town and haven&#39;t finished my e-mail. OH HORRORS!  <br/>
Kirby and Holly are in the car and if I don&#39;t log off RIGHT NOW he&#39;ll be late <br/>
for work.  And I won&#39;t be back til 4:00... Oh the withdrawals...<br/>
