&lt;&lt;&lt;Watching enough to know what it is helps. If you know  enough that if <br/>
he tells you a story about something he saw you have an  idea who the <br/>
characters are is really great for  him.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do with Spongebob, but reading this, I  realized I&#39;ve been avoiding Ben 10 <br/>
(which I rather like, actually) and  definitely DON&#39;T know enough about the <br/>
characters or storyline. What a great  opportunity for me to sit down with him <br/>
tomorrow and ask to watch it &quot;on  demand&quot;-thanks.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;When I start to feel  the sharp grating jangly feeling, I try to breath <br/>
through it and think GOOD  thoughts about what they&#39;re doing and learning.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
I do see things he&#39;s learned from it and I love  the sound of his laughter <br/>
when he is watching it. I don&#39;t like to watch it  *myself*, mainly because of <br/>
what parts I see as *disrespectful*... But opening  my mind with this thread has <br/>
helped me see that I have a &quot;problem theme&quot; of  *disrespect* looming large in <br/>
my mind, so I will have to spend some time  examining *that*.<br/>
 <br/>
On the other hand, I do love silly shows and  silliness in general (we love <br/>
puns and wordplay, here-apparently I have not been  watching closely enough! <br/>
Thanks, Pam!), and I *love* that his pet snail, Gary,  &quot;meow&quot;s. Maybe I got <br/>
stuck with some negative thoughts: &quot;I *don&#39;t* like it.  It is big on disrespect&quot;, <br/>
and/or searching out those negative things within the  show. I&#39;ll try watching <br/>
from here on in without an &quot;agenda&quot; and hopefully even  looking *for* those <br/>
silly, fun things. Maybe I will eventually find that I like  it for myself. Big <br/>
thanks to all those that contributed to this thought process  and helped me <br/>
change my thinking perspective!!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

I never learned the characters&#39; names on RugRats.  Holly liked it,  <br/>
and we talked about it some, but I told her I don&#39;t like the way they  <br/>
treat each other and it makes me sad everytime I see it.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
like the mean girl using the word &quot;stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That might&#39;ve been enough feedback for Holly&#39;s comfort, though,  <br/>
because she would come and tell me stories sometimes about the  <br/>
meanness and that she was glad people had never been that way with  <br/>
her, but I said some people are that way and they don&#39;t know a  <br/>
different way.<br/>
<br/>
So good came of it, even though I really was too uncomfortable with  <br/>
it to watch myself, probably because people HAD called me and my  <br/>
ideas and my interests &quot;stupid&quot; when I was a kid, more times than I  <br/>
would want to try to count.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s experience with the show wasn&#39;t mine at all.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s on right now on my TV.  My 16 y.o. son and his 19 y.o. friend are <br/>
watching, and laughing.  The episode has the characters transported <br/>
back to cave-man days; they look a little like the Flintstones, but <br/>
they&#39;re grunting instead of talking.  Squidward just chose which club <br/>
to take with him, leaving the other behind; the club started crying.<br/>
<br/>
The genius of SpongeBob is its visual absurdity.  I mean -- a starfish <br/>
that has eyes and a mouth on what ought to be the top of its body is <br/>
just the start.  I think with many cartoons, its the voices and the <br/>
overall noise level that bug adults; try turning the sound down and <br/>
just *look* at SpongeBob.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit I have a weakness for &#39;toons, though, as my son wants <br/>
to be a cartoonist (planning on a daily strip) and one of his good <br/>
friends is already a voice actor and knows many of the actors behind <br/>
shows like Animaniacs.  That one, btw, is pure genius and unique in <br/>
that the writers were not beholden to a studio; Steven Spielberg backed <br/>
them financially, and gave them carte blanche.  (Can you tell I&#39;ve been <br/>
to ComiCon? &lt;g&gt;)  Like a lot of cartoons (Loony Toons, Bullwinkle, <br/>
etc), Animaniacs is written for adults, but kids like it, too ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-731241030">DH *loves* Spongebob.  I like it too, but not to the same degree. <br/>
He&#39;s one of those guys who can get all the kids waiting in line at the<br/>
supermarket to sing the theme song with him!<br/>
<br/>
Fin, our DD, seems bewildered by it, but jumps up and trys to watch<br/>
with him.  She&#39;ll ask questions like, &quot;They are underwater? Why does<br/>
Gary have to take a bath then?&quot; Yes, I would say &quot;visual absurdity&quot; is<br/>
one of its highlights :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Not to mention the regular gravity pull in the ocean...whether falling off a<br/>
cliff or out of a flying car...it&#39;s straight down like a penny off the Sears<br/>
Tower.<br/>
<br/>
And the ocean beachfront...on the ocean floor. I still have to think about<br/>
that one to get it when I see it. And Sandy Squirrel with the air<br/>
helmet...it&#39;s just part of her...no one seems to notice she&#39;s a land animal<br/>
blithely living on the sea floor...it&#39;s all so funny (more so watching than<br/>
reading my inept attempt to capture it).<br/>
