<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111715444">Holly and I were talking about friends she misses in Quebec.  I was  <br/>
talking about other trips she&#39;s taken, her stay in England when she  <br/>
was 13, and my upcoming visit to the same family (though they&#39;re in  <br/>
France now).   She said she&#39;s heard that the &quot;bad words&quot; in Quebec are  <br/>
more religious than those in France.  I said probably Louisiana, too,  <br/>
because France seems to have thrown religion out during the  <br/>
Revolution.  I&#39;m doing a workshop in August on &quot;bad words.&quot;    So I  <br/>
told her about a line being taken out of one of of my pieces of  <br/>
writing, when it was translated to French--a line about Jesus.  She  <br/>
asked me to find it.<br/>
<br/>
So a five minute discussion in my kitchen led to me sending this to  <br/>
the list, but the reason I&#39;m sending it is the recent spate of people  <br/>
coming to the list sure that all ideas are equal.  Unschooling.  This  <br/>
list is for discussing unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
Once upon a time a confident and experienced scholar went to the best  <br/>
Zen teacher he knew, to apply to be his student. The master offered  <br/>
tea, and he held out his cup. While the student recited his knowledge  <br/>
and cataloged his accomplishments to date, the master poured slowly.  <br/>
The bragging continued, and the pouring continued, until the student  <br/>
was getting a lapful of tea, and said, “My cup is full!” The master  <br/>
smiled and said, “Yes, it is. And until you empty yourself of what you  <br/>
think you know, you won’t be able to learn.”<br/>
<br/>
Weird Al says it a different way in “Everything You Know is Wrong,”  <br/>
and Christians say “You must surrender yourself.” Before that Jesus  <br/>
said, “Unless you become as a little child…”<br/>
<br/>
What it means in homeschooling terms is that as long as you think you  <br/>
can control and add to what you already know, it will be hard to come  <br/>
to unschooling. The more quickly you empty your cup and open yourself  <br/>
to new ideas uncritically, the sooner you will see natural learning  <br/>
blossom.<br/>

<br/>
There is another misconception going around that if one&#39;s children  <br/>
didn&#39;t go to school there&#39;s no need for deschooling.  The parents  <br/>
still went to school, and will not recover just from wishing for it,  <br/>
or imagining that joining an unschooling list makes one an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s work to do, and changes to be made, and HUNDREDS of people  <br/>
here willing to help you do that!!<br/>
