<div id="ygrps-yiv-454200427">We are planning on South Carolina.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care what the format is.  I&#39;m just so excited to be meeting other<br/>
unschoolers and the fact that dh is also excited to go.  We are driving in<br/>
from Texas and making a family vacation out of it.  Dh went to college in<br/>
Columbia so we know a few things to do.  If anybody has any suggestions for<br/>
cool stuff to do with 5 kids, let us know.<br/>

kids do during presentations(assuming kids are welcome).<br/>
The SC one is 3 days.  How long of a day? I&#39;m thinking a morning and <br/>
afternoon session.??  Are there activities at night?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK. I&#39;ve never been to one either, so I&#39;m flying by the seat of my <br/>
pants---and those of Sandra and Nathaline---and any others whose pants I can <br/>
grab.<br/>
<br/>
Children are OF COURSE welcome! This IS an UNschooling conference! &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
Things get started Fri afternoon and are followed by Game Night as a &quot; get to <br/>
know you&quot;. Sat & Sun there will be speakers and Funshops (or, to the more <br/>
seriously minded, workshops) open to adults AND kids. Sat night we will have <br/>
a talent show---open to kids AND adults. There will be no age discrimination, <br/>
although there will probably be things that certain ages will enjoy more than <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
PLEASE if you have any ideas, send them this way---there&#39;s still LOTS to <br/>
plan, and I&#39;m open to suggestions---although I cannot guarantee I&#39;ll use your <br/>
idea!<br/>
<br/>
The website should be up by the end of next week. I&#39;ll post as soon as it&#39;s <br/>
up!<br/>

to Mexico so I missed the beginning of the discussion, but this sounds<br/>
awesome. I went around and around with the HSC people on their stupid<br/>
ageist rules and finally decided it wasn&#39;t worth it until Cacie was a<br/>
teen and was &quot;allowed&quot; to actually walk from one place to another<br/>
unescorted - not to mention how she was &quot;too old&quot; or &quot;too young&quot; to go to<br/>
90% of what was offered... arggh..<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this sounds excellent. Have I effused enough? I wonder of we<br/>
could make a road trip out of it, we&#39;ve been threatening.... um,<br/>
*promising* to visit some folks there for years, and now we could visit<br/>
Sharon, too... Unschoolers Across America?<br/>
<br/>
Hmm. Looks like a 5500 mile round trip just going to Columbia and back.<br/>
Dang, this is a big country. Perhaps we&#39;ll fly...<br/>
<br/>
Dar, excited!<br/>

What are the rules about kids for the Sacramento deal?  I&#39;ve been planning to <br/>
take Holly with me to Sacramento this year, but she&#39;s only ten, and if that <br/>
means she has to be with an adult all the time I&#39;d rather leave her home.  I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to impose on anyone else, and she won&#39;t want to hang around <br/>
with me all the time.  I&#39;ve never had kids with me before, so could always <br/>
ignore that part of it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; home. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, for the last two years anyway, the rules were that kids had to be<br/>
accompanied by an adult everywhere. They had workshops (or &quot;activities&quot;)<br/>
for kids but each attending child needed to have an adult with them at<br/>
the workshop, and they couldn&#39;t leave the workshop  by themselves to go<br/>
elsewhere. You could have a few kids to one adult, but it still was a lot<br/>
of juggling, and often the kids we knew didn&#39;t want to go to the same<br/>
workshops, or they&#39;d rather swim, or play in the hotel room, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Teens were a whole different ballgame, they didn&#39;t have to be escorted.<br/>
However, all the workshops had age limits, and the one year we went (year<br/>
before last) Cacie was the wrong age for everything she thought was<br/>
interesting - most of what sounded good to her was designated &quot;teen&quot;<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So, frankly, I was less than thrilled, and so was she... we both think<br/>
the SC conference sounds much better!  Although if Holly wants to come to<br/>
Sacramento, she&#39;s be welcome to come hang out with us :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, this sounds like this single mom&#39;s nightmare. How am I <br/>
supposed to go and hear someone speak that Tamzin has no <br/>
interest in? And does having to be at all activities with her mean <br/>
that I&#39;m going to miss out on stuff that I want to see? I was <br/>
hoping that she might be able to go to an activity whilst I went to <br/>
a presentation. I guess not :-(<br/>
Luckily, we have those little walkie talkie things. At least maybe <br/>
she could be in the room (watching TV or playing) while I went to <br/>
a presentation. There&#39;s probably not too many that I want to go to <br/>
anyway. I mainly want to go to meet some of you folks from the <br/>
list.<br/>

once.  This will be my 5th year attending - my kids and husband do<br/>
something else that weekend.  I don&#39;t know when my children might<br/>

had quite a few &quot;converts&quot; after last year&#39;s conference!<br/>
