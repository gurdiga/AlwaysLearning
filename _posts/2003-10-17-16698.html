<div id="ygrps-yiv-587353546">We&#39;re registered in MA because...well...that&#39;s the kinda gal I am, and the <br/>
requirements are not particularly oppressive. I get a letter once a year saying <br/>
they got my proposal and that they may ask me to test. They never have, and if <br/>
they did, at that point I would say, &quot;you know...that doesn&#39;t fit in with <br/>
what we do....How about a portfolio instead?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
MA has bad reputations, but it&#39;s been pretty easy for us.<br/>
