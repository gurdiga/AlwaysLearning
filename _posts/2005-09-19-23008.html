<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076815041">I &quot;homeschooled&quot; my son (almost 9) for half a year last year and for <br/>
this year too. I have done some unschooling (a couple weeks) then I <br/>
got nervous and went back to the homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple questions you may be able to help me with.<br/>
<br/>
First, my son loves to be with me, and I with him. But without an <br/>
activity handed to him, he will want me to amuse him at all times. <br/>
Although it is so much better than it used to be, he will still ask <br/>
for the 2 hours of the babys nap to play with me the whole time, <br/>
thereby stealing all of the only time that i have for anything else. <br/>
And if I say no, i just wind up feeling so guilty that i go and play. <br/>
That is one of the reasons we went back to structure. I enjoy playing <br/>
with my son quite a bit, but 2 hours of pretending to be the <br/>
zookeeper for a fort zoo is toooooooooo much. How do you handle this <br/>
type of thing ?<br/>
<br/>
Second, when i was unschooling I saw that my son got very, snotty i <br/>
guess is the only way to put it with him friends. He seemed to get <br/>
the notion he was above them and that he was smarter, and it <br/>
reflected in his relationships. I dont know if that is just because <br/>
his self esteem is so good that he is just going to relate taht way <br/>
for awhile or what. Any info would help !<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
School at home won&#39;t take less time.   It will take more, and it will stress <br/>
your relationship.    If you want to unschool, drop that like a hot rock.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Second, when i was unschooling I saw that my son got very, snotty i<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Snotty&quot; can&#39;t be the only way to put it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he was relieved to be out of school and he was showing that joy.   It <br/>
will help loads if you think of your child in the nicest possible terms, and <br/>
look for the benefits rather than the inconveniences.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He seemed to get<br/>
the notion he was above them and that he was smarter, and it<br/>
reflected in his relationships.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Advise him on being a gracious host, and on being welcoming, and on playing <br/>
with the other kids where and how they want to play, before asking them to do <br/>
something he&#39;s wanting to do.<br/>
<br/>

put him back in school ? What kind of support was that ?<br/>

Yes I DO have other things to do. Maybe you have a maid, etc, but i <br/>
do not. My husband works all the time and is very unhelpful. Excuse <br/>
me if I do have to do laundry now and again.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Why do you put &quot;homeschooled&quot; in quotes?  If your child is not <br/>
attending full-time school, either private or public, are you doing <br/>
something else, like a public school independent study program?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Do you understand what unschooling is?  I tend to not think of it as <br/>
something I &quot;do,&quot; but as something my kids don&#39;t &quot;do,&quot; i.e., school.  <br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean they do nothing at all, although with teens you have <br/>
to be nocturnal to observe this &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why not just say &quot;yes&quot;?  Go play.  The housework can wait, or you can <br/>
make it part of the play.  I used to race my son to see who could put <br/>
Legos in the bucket, not only fastest, but loudest!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; type of thing ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you tried giving him totally, without guilt or any kind of <br/>
negativity, your total self for as long as he wants?  That&#39;s what I&#39;d <br/>
do.  I would be absolutely his, for, say, an hour and a half; show him <br/>
how to read the clock.  Then let him know that when that time is up, he <br/>
may help you mop the floor or clean the bathroom or whatever (and let <br/>
him, if he chooses you and a chore over being alone).  You may find <br/>
that, having satisfied his need not only *for* you but to know he can <br/>
trust you, his demands on your time and attention will decrease.  You <br/>
have to be patient, though, and absolutely cheerful and sincere; no <br/>
sighing and clockwatching.  If zookeeping isn&#39;t your thing, after <br/>
awhile, suggest something else, but still -- if it&#39;s within his time, <br/>
it&#39;s fair to do what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you know most convicted felons rate very highly on self-esteem <br/>
scales?  Esteeming *others* is a better way to make friends.<br/>
<br/>
You might need to teach him to be polite, before his friends start <br/>
dumping him.<br/>
<br/>
There is one other thing to consider: his friends could be hassling <br/>
him, and he&#39;s defending himself.  My kids were often quizzed by school <br/>
kids, who couldn&#39;t believe somebody else got off without having to <br/>
endure the torment of school.  It was their way of making themselves <br/>
feel better (and it was ALWAYS math questions, usually far above their <br/>
own class&#39;s level).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps,<br/>

<br/>
It seems that increasingly people are finding this list and joining as beginning unschoolers, or wanna-be unschoolers, not realizing that discussions assume that people already understand and embrace unschooling.  I could be wrong, but that is my understanding from the list description:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books Learning All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have made unschooling a sweet and viable option for thousands of families. This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way.) It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure unschooling than neutral, general homeschooling discussion-there are hundreds of general homeschooling discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus more toward how people learn no matter where in the world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular country or jurisdiction.

 </span></blockquote>I vividly remember how challenging life is with a baby in the house.  And all those mothers of no-longer-babies would say the housework will wait.  Your baby won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The same is true for 5 year olds and 10 year olds and teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
Children really do grow up so fast.  Your son will be 9 for only one year.  Housework and laundry will always be there waiting for you &lt;g&gt;.  Your son won&#39;t.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But without an<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For some kids, some people for that matter, the important part of an  <br/>
activity isn&#39;t the activity but sharing it with someone else.<br/>
<br/>
For some people being faced with a world of being able to do anything  <br/>
you want is intimidating. There are too many choices.<br/>
<br/>
As a child I enjoyed watching my father work on building projects  <br/>
around the house. But as an adult I find doing them myself isn&#39;t  <br/>
nearly as much fun. I&#39;d much rather help someone else.<br/>
<br/>
I know the feelings you&#39;re going through. You want someone to tell  <br/>
you how to get him to change so you can get what you want. But the  <br/>
truth is that you can&#39;t do that without hurting him and hurting your  <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although it is so much better than it used to be, he will still ask<br/>
&gt; for the 2 hours of the babys nap to play with me the whole time,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, look at it from his point of view. He used to have you all to  <br/>
himself. Now he has to share you with the baby. But when that daily  <br/>
opportunity comes when he can pretend it&#39;s still just the two of you  <br/>
you want to work it so you&#39;re away from him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; thereby stealing all of the only time that i have for anything else.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Get up earlier. Go to bed later. Hire someone. Get a mother&#39;s helper  <br/>
to spend some time with your son. Invite other kids over. Help him  <br/>
find friends so he&#39;s out of the house for a bit. Rethink the task you  <br/>
have to do. Someone said they only used just enough dishes for one  <br/>
meal so she had to wash them right away so she never had a huge pile  <br/>
of dishes to do. Some people store their clothes in the laundry in  <br/>
bins and hanging racks so doing the laundry is *much* easier.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to dismiss the ideas because it would be easier and more  <br/>
convenient if he&#39;d just change, but you won&#39;t be able to get him to  <br/>
change. If you make his happy childhood your priority you&#39;ll find  <br/>
ways to make things simpler.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And if I say no, i just wind up feeling so guilty that i go and play.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s your heart speaking. Listen to it.<br/>
<br/>
When he looks back on his childhood he&#39;s going to have either the  <br/>
impression that you were always there for him or that you were always  <br/>
too busy. You *can&#39;t* get him to see the importance of the tasks  <br/>
around the house. He&#39;s not old enough. He can only interpret &quot;I have  <br/>
other things that need done,&quot; as saying other things are more  <br/>
important than he is. And it&#39;s going to be especially hard if you&#39;re  <br/>
saying during the only time he sees that you belong to him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; That is one of the reasons we went back to structure. I enjoy playing<br/>

&gt; zookeeper for a fort zoo is toooooooooo much. How do you handle this<br/>
&gt; type of thing ?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By telling him that it isn&#39;t your favorite thing to do but you&#39;ll do  <br/>
it for 30 minutes. Before he asks, maybe in the morning, tell him  <br/>
that you&#39;d like to find some other things to do during the 2 hours of  <br/>
the baby&#39;s nap because you have a hard time playing zoo keeper that  <br/>
long. Make a list. That way he knows what&#39;s coming.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Second, when i was unschooling I saw that my son got very, snotty i<br/>
&gt; guess is the only way to put it with him friends.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That could be a reaction to extreme stress. It&#39;s a 5 yo version of  <br/>
&quot;Thank goodness I don&#39;t have to do that stuff anymore!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wild animals who&#39;ve been caged tend to bolt if they get the chance.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He seemed to get<br/>
&gt; the notion he was above them and that he was smarter, and it<br/>
&gt; reflected in his relationships.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wouldn&#39;t project adult motivations on a child. I child who says &quot;I  <br/>
hate you!&quot; isn&#39;t saying the same thing as an adult. They&#39;re coming  <br/>
from a totally different mindset.<br/>
<br/>
Be his partner. Help him be a better friend. Help him find better  <br/>
ways to relieve his stress.<br/>
