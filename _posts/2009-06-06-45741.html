This was on the Medieval Trivia yahoo list.  It&#39;s a link to a BBC  <br/>
article:<br/>
<br/>
New software has enabled researchers to recreate a long forgotten  <br/>
musical instrument called the Lituus.<br/>
The 2.7m (8.5ft) long trumpet-like instrument fell out of use some 300  <br/>
years ago.<br/>
Bach&#39;s motet (a choral musical composition) &quot;O Jesu Christ, meins  <br/>
lebens licht&quot; was one of the last pieces of music written for the  <br/>
Lituus.<br/>
Now, for the first time, this 18th Century composition has been played  <br/>
as it might have been heard.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are photos.<br/>
There&#39;s a great intersection of music, history and technology!<br/>

What a great link!.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s just wonderful when something utterly of the present can help us  <br/>
understand something much older.  It put me in mind of the composer  Percy <br/>
Grainger going out in the very early 20th century with his  new-fangled <br/>
phonograph to record the voices of old singers whose songs and  styles were falling <br/>
out of fashion.  Joseph Taylor was one of these  singers: I&#39;ve put a link to <br/>
some mp3 previews (sorry, it&#39;s via a commercial  site, but it has the only <br/>
audio previews I could find).  &quot;Creeping  Jane&quot; especially is really quite <br/>
exotic, yet annotation on the  page wouldn&#39;t really have picked this up in the <br/>
same way as the technology that  allowed us to hear Taylor&#39;s phrasing in <br/>
that particular moment.<br/>

And now we can hear this voice from the past at the click of a  mouse. <br/>

<br/>
That was very cool.<br/>
<br/>
I have, on cassette tape, recordings taken (by me through the air) of  <br/>
78s of ballads taken from wax cylinder. Yikes.  Fragile.   And not  <br/>
well cataloged. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
College.  I had a professor who had lots of old field recordings on  <br/>
78s.  I went to his funeral when he died in the 1980s.  I didn&#39;t ask  <br/>
for the records.  Maybe they&#39;re at the university.<br/>

Here&#39;s the link, so you can hear the lituus (you can hear it best <br/>
after the singing at the beginning):<br/>
