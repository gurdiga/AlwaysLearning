Below is some advice from a friend of mine going through a nasty <br/>
divorce.  She&#39;s really savvy - not an unschooler though. She advises <br/>
that you tell the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) everything. I wouldn&#39;t take <br/>
on explaining or justifying unschooling to the GAL. Maybe when you <br/>
need to talk about education stuff, consider using schoolish <br/>
vocabulary - good examples of this at   <br/>

Best advice I can give is to get good recommendation for a GAL - <br/>
someone with experience and a history of fairness, and tell the GAL <br/>
EVERYTHING. Send a weekly update on the child (schedule, activities, <br/>
significant moments, etc..), communicate with the ex-husband only by <br/>
e-mail so that there is a record, and send the GAL copies of all e-<br/>
mails. If weird stuff happens, sum it up and send an e-mail to the <br/>
GAL. The husband&#39;s only weapon is to create an air of concern about <br/>
the welfare of child. If she keeps her life and the child&#39;s an open <br/>
book, that weapon is gone. She doesn&#39;t have to follow all of the <br/>
norms for the courts to find her to be a good mother, she just has to <br/>
be a good mom. It&#39;s okay for the GAL to know that her son isn&#39;t <br/>
always thrilled with her, and for the GAL to know how she handles <br/>
that. The GAL will know that kids are kids - she/he wants to know how <br/>
the parents handle it.</div>
