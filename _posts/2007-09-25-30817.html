<div id="ygrps-yiv-485506703">A report on national reading and math scores came out today.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20973598/">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20973598/</a><br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I like to read these reports just to remember how far I&#39;ve<br/>
come and to compare how differently I think now than when I was enmeshed<br/>
in that culture.  I thought the below quote was very telling and a<br/>
little confusing.  In comparing the difference in scores for reading and<br/>
math, does it really state that &quot;educators&quot; believe that there&#39;s minimal<br/>
math exposure outside of the classroom!!  Yikes.   And are they really<br/>
saying that because some students get extra exposure to reading in the<br/>
home, it&#39;s harder to control what they learn? <br/>
 <br/>
 &quot;The math scores have generally been on a steady upward trajectory<br/>
since the early 1990s. Some educators say it&#39;s easier for teachers to<br/>
affect math scores, because math is almost entirely a school-based<br/>
subject while some children get extra exposure to reading in their<br/>
homes.&quot;<br/>
To keep this related to Unschooling, this journey has expanded my<br/>
awareness of how learning is going on all the time and how often we are<br/>
exposed to math, science, history, reading, and every other subject that<br/>
schools have tried to take ownership of.  Unschooling has helped me not<br/>
put our learning in a box or a certain category.  It has helped replace<br/>
my fears with confidence that learning is always happening.<br/>
 <br/>
I love those shifts in consciousness,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Like most people they see doing formal math as math. Most kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
doing much 47 + 158 type of math out of class.<br/>
<br/>
Though they *are* doing &quot;Well, I have $25 and the new game is $48.98  <br/>
at Wal-Mart so I need to wait 3 more weeks of allowance before I can  <br/>
get the game.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When teachers spend hours and hours doing formal math to make a tiny  <br/>
bit of progress, the small amount of real math kids do doesn&#39;t seem  <br/>
enough. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so hard to get across to new unschoolers that  <br/>
encountering numbers in real contexts will give kids an understanding  <br/>
of how numbers work. After that, the formal stuff is easy.<br/>

<br/>
I think (but could be wrong) they mean by this:  &quot; Some educators say  <br/>
it&#39;s easier for teachers to<br/>
affect math scores&quot; that it&#39;s easier to prove that changes in school  <br/>
policies improved math scores.<br/>
<br/>
It probably means they&#39;ve started teaching to the tests instead of  <br/>
wasting time (in the view of those analysts) with following  <br/>
curiosities or letting different teachers teach math in their own  <br/>
creative ways (if any), but they&#39;ve successfully changed school to  <br/>
focus more on test scores than general learning and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
I bet they&#39;re very proud of themselves for making school even MORE  <br/>
narrow and &quot;focussed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And they think it&#39;s focussed on children, no doubt, instead of on  <br/>
measurable results (i.e. numbers in the form of improvement of scores  <br/>
on tests over the course of years).  The students are raw materials  <br/>
to create those improvements in numbers.<br/>

And my immediate question is: Why teach math at all, if it&#39;s only<br/>
school-based and has no application to the outside world??<br/>
Probably the greatest frustration to those of us who love the sterile<br/>
absolutes of numbers and rarely find real-life math to be so *clean* :D I<br/>
just came back into the house after standing outside for a few minutes with<br/>
&quot;The Great Book of Math Teasers&quot; (my other books are already packed)-- I&#39;ve<br/>
come to realize that the most of Hayden&#39;s number manipulation thrills come<br/>
from what *I* consider &quot;story problems&quot; from my math classes. I&#39;ve<br/>
recognized that tightness in my gut and my immediate desire to throw my<br/>
hands in the air and wait for someone else to give me the formula so I can<br/>
put the numbers in, without consideration for Gramma and her dumplings ;)<br/>
I&#39;ve got lots of healing to do, I want numbers to be as fun for me as they<br/>
are for my son!<br/>
It&#39;s only through unschooling I&#39;m able to do this, in the absence of the<br/>
judgment a teacher brings to the equation :)<br/>

Yes, that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m seeing unfold in both my children! Thanks<br/>

And speaking in a teacher voice, with the eyes they used to draw in  <br/>
Mad Magazine for the clueless twinkie-girls...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What do you mean &#39;the outside world&#39;?<br/>
School is the real world.  School is your job, until you&#39;re old  <br/>
enough to go into the work force.  School is as real as it gets.  If  <br/>
you don&#39;t get good grades in math, how will  you get good grades in  <br/>
college math?  If you don&#39;t get good grades in college, how will you  <br/>
get a good job?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yada, yada, yada.<br/>
<br/>
They really can&#39;t look at the world without squinting through those  <br/>
painted-over classroom windows.<br/>
I used to be there myself.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I&#39;ve come to realize is that math isn&#39;t just numbers either.  Math <br/>
is conceptual exploration of perspective as well as numbers that can <br/>
apply to that.  To me, it&#39;s better to be able to ask the questions than <br/>
to know the answer, or how to write the answer in the form of an <br/>
equation.<br/>
<br/>
While I know that there is a symbol for infinity, the concept is much <br/>
cooler than knowing the written form of it.  Symmetry and spirals and <br/>
all of those things can represent the infinite.  How to add and <br/>
subtract and get a story problem, or &quot;algebra&quot; is the easy day to day <br/>
mundane of mathematics.</div>

understanding of the &quot;practical&quot;, yet it seems to work in Unschoolers&#39; real <br/>
lives all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I remember in college I and several others took film studies through the <br/>
English Department - being Theater majors ourselves. The difference in <br/>
approach was an illustration of this same concept. In our department we were <br/>
constantly engaged in creating projects - the practical - while any theory <br/>
studies we did (which was plenty!) were in order to facilitate our further <br/>
development as theater practitioners and artists. Whereas in the English <br/>
department practical projects (ie student films) were assigned as aides to <br/>
understand the various theories being discussed in class.<br/>
<br/>
I will leave you to guess whose film projects consistently won most kudos, <br/>
prizes in the student competitions and, ironically, the best grades in the <br/>
English class.<br/>

--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It is really sad for all those children who are the product of this  <br/>
increasing dishonesty in state education. My sentiments are fully  <br/>
with Sandra here. Working at Pearson Education part-time (eves) was  <br/>
such an eye-opener on what happens across the country in school  <br/>
testing. In many instances, the students were using the exact same  <br/>
words. For some classes you just see the teacher peeked at the rubric  <br/>
and wrote it on the board--and still, most of the students were not  <br/>
concerned enough to copy it correctly (and good for them!) I despise  <br/>
testing and mostly took the temp job out of curiosity. My kids aren&#39;t  <br/>
in school so I didn&#39;t know how it was these days.<br/>
<br/>
When I think about this situation I am both joyous that my family  <br/>
doesn&#39;t buy into that ugly panic-filled life-style, but sad that so  <br/>
many others in our modern culture have to.<br/>
<br/>
George Carlin, in a recent youtube clip (&#39;who owns America&#39;), says  <br/>
much the same concerning the archaic educational system we&#39;ve  <br/>
developed. We aren&#39;t any closer to teaching effectively, we&#39;ve just  <br/>
dumbed down everything so it looks that way.<br/>
<br/>
When do think people are going to realize that this mindless approach  <br/>
to education is potentially harmful for all involved  and on many  <br/>
levels?<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness for unschooling (and the current freedom we have to  <br/>
practice it).<br/>
