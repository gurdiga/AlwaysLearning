<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586886323">I dont want to.I know it works for so many people but I dont feel our <br/>
situation is healthy.We are horrible hermits and dont like being <br/>
around people and my 14yo is just like me.I dont want this for him.<br/>
I wish they had unschooling counseling to help us do this.<br/>
Ive talked to my son and we have gone over our options<br/>
1. Correspondence school(American school(very dry and boring dont <br/>
think i could make myself do this stuff)<br/>
2. Work toward a GED(I personally find these useless but at least he <br/>
is doing something)<br/>
3. Go to public school for high school<br/>
4. Continue to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
But his unschooling consists of getting up at 10:00 and lounging <br/>
around the house.Playing computer till 10:00 at night then maybe <br/>
reading a book till 1 or 2am.He doesnt want to try anything new.Ive <br/>
strewn, Ive suggested.He doesnt like change, he wont try new foods or <br/>
different clothes either.I find myself criticising him all to often <br/>
lately and dont like it, and know its not helping the situation at <br/>
all.He fights with his brother or bosses him around constantly.<br/>
He doesnt want to get a job, and doesnt like any of the above options <br/>
1 though 3.<br/>
I feel lost...What are we supposed to be doing? <br/>
BTW he hates sports so dont suggest joining anything like that.<br/>
Ive always promised him if hates something he can always quit, Im not <br/>
a monster or anything.I would even let him quit highschool if really <br/>
hated it...<br/>
I worry because my 22yo son still lives at home, works at a <br/>
grocerystore without even paid sick days.And has never even been on a <br/>
date with a girl...What is going to become of us?</div>

There are people who will talk to you by phone for money, seriously,  <br/>
if you want that kind of counselling.<br/>
(could people here who post some, please?  I see things in  <br/>
homeschooling magazines, but I haven&#39;t kept up with them...)<br/>

How long has he been out of school?<br/>
That is the most important information we need to advise you further.<br/>

Did the 22 year old go to school?<br/>
Would school help the 14 year old in those areas?<br/>

Are the boys anything like you or your husband, in temperament?<br/>

once a week in a game store.  His whole social life revolves around it. <br/>
  Trust me, it&#39;s not sports &lt;g&gt; but it is a lot of fun, mentally <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Cece. I&#39;m glad that you&#39;re still considering 4. an option, even<br/>
though you seem uncomfortable with how things are in your home right now. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m something of a collector of quotable quotes, and one that springs<br/>
to mind is &quot;search for what you lack in that which you have&quot; (Enrique<br/>
Solares(sp?),I think) - though maybe modify it &quot;search for what you<br/>
*think/feel* you lack in that which you have&quot;.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So the lounging around plays out how? Do you have a bunch of companion<br/>
animals, like we do, that are endless sources of joy/fun (and work)?<br/>
Is he chatting with you and other family members about this, that and<br/>
the other - the book he&#39;s currently reading? what all is going on in<br/>
his corner of computerland, whether he&#39;s a gamer, or a wiki linktrail<br/>
follower or whatever it is he&#39;s up to/exploring in his computer and<br/>
reading time? <br/>
<br/>
Perhaps he spends, and needs to spend a lot of time processing<br/>
internally rather than talking about stuff. If so, I can relate. I<br/>
need time to stare at the wall or off into space in order to work<br/>
through things, though more often I fill this need in me while<br/>
standing at the sink washing dishes and gazing out the window at our<br/>
back garden or meditatively concentrating on the soapsuds or patterns<br/>
on the plates or whatever I&#39;m tending to, which serves the same sort<br/>
of purpose for centering myself.<br/>
<br/>
Your post drew my attention particularly because I&#39;m a hermitty type<br/>
person by nature. My daughter, K, a 14 yr old only, is a little less<br/>
introverted than me, but still happily spends almost all her time at<br/>
home, not engaged in or longing for much or any outside activity at<br/>
this time in her life - though I should say she did go happily to<br/>
school from 5-10.5yrs. <br/>
<br/>
K is not fixed on any particular future either, but has thought some<br/>
about part-time paid work she might be interested in doing now, or<br/>
soonish, and due to ethical/political issues she has with a lot of the<br/>
world at large, came up with the library, gallery or museum, maybe, as<br/>
places she thinks/feels she could find comfortable and interesting to<br/>
be. I&#39;ve made preliminary enquiries about working at the library, so<br/>
that we know how to go about that - they have young people working in<br/>
the back and stacking shelves, etc. This work ideas thing is newish so<br/>
haven&#39;t got to enquiring at gallery spaces around town yet, nor the<br/>
museum. <br/>
<br/>
We are mostly night people at our house right now, and a great deal of<br/>
K&#39;s time is spent on the computer, reading, listening to music,<br/>
watching tv/movies etc. Recently she said &quot;I&#39;d like to learn more<br/>
about Napolean&quot;. Don;t know where that came from, nor her last<br/>
particular interest in something that looks &quot;educational&quot; to those<br/>
looking on through the mainstream lens, which was Hitler/WWII... but<br/>
around things like that, her interest in media (screen and music,<br/>
history included), the time she spends creating pixel and other art<br/>
which she has websites for/forums she sometimes participates in, and<br/>
something else I meant to say that has gone out of my head right now,<br/>
she has fuller days, a fuller, richer life than many looking on would<br/>
imagine possible, given how small and close her life might look to some. <br/>
<br/>
We do take a few daytrips out of town each year, and attend a few<br/>
specific local homeschool events of interest each year, but we&#39;re<br/>
certainly not constantly out and about doing things as many people<br/>
are. Unschooling looks different in every home.<br/>
<br/>
My point is, again, that I wonder just how empty your 14 yr olds days<br/>
really are when you take a closer look. Possibly it&#39;s up to you to<br/>
take a closer look/interest in what all he is doing with his time. You<br/>
might be surprised what you see there, which might help you relax<br/>
some, to be more in the moment, more about *now*. <br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s a lot, and others have asked questions that your answers<br/>
to will no doubt help people help you. <br/>
<br/>
Kind regards<br/>

friend but just cant seem to find one either.Maybe that is how my <br/>
14yo is to a point.My hubby is better with people but not big on <br/>
socializing either.He is however self motivated and it frustrates him <br/>
that certain kids are so unmotivated.He likes the idea of unschooling <br/>
as well but its been a hard year, he had a heart attack last year and <br/>
a slew of other health problems so he hasnt been able to help me with <br/>
the kids much at all(like playing with them or going places or <br/>
whatever)..<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ive been discussing this more with my son and hubby.We really are <br/>
trying to find a solution here that we all are happy with.My hubby <br/>
doesnt like the idea of public school(he had bad experiences there)<br/>
But I NEED to believe that if he(14yo) decides to continue on his <br/>
narrow path that this is the right thing and healthy (mentally)for <br/>
him..<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is SO often the key! I don&#39;t think it can be emphasized enough.  <br/>
And it applies at all ages. No matter HOW trivial what they are doing  <br/>
seems to be, to a parent, take it seriously. If a kid is spending  <br/>
many hours a day watching soap operas, take it seriously. Start  <br/>
watching together - subscribe to Soap Opera Digest. Bring up the  <br/>
characters in your conversations. Bring up the situations and compare  <br/>
them to real situations happening in the world to real people. And,  <br/>
notice what it is that seems interesting about the soaps, to your  <br/>
kid. Is it relaxing? Is it exciting? Is it the relationships or the  <br/>
drama or the tragedy that is attractive? What is holding his/her  <br/>
interest?<br/>
<br/>
  I picked soaps because most parents would probably think their kid  <br/>
was wasting his/her time if he watched soaps for hours and hours  <br/>
every day. But, replace &quot;soap operas&quot; with anything else - whatever a  <br/>
kid might be spending their time on.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Attention must be paid.&quot; (from Death of a Salesman)<br/>
<br/>
An unschooling parent needs to be fully present with their kids,  <br/>
sensitive to their kids&#39; needs, and extremely respectful of their  <br/>
kids&#39; interests. This is simple and very difficult, at the same time.  <br/>
It is so simple, it really asks so little of us, as parents, to pay  <br/>
attention to what &quot;is&quot; right in front of us. But, it is very very  <br/>
difficult to do, sometimes, especially when what our kids are  <br/>
presenting to us appears to us to be negative or dull or unproductive.<br/>
<br/>
I work at it, still, myself, sometimes. My 16 and 19 year olds have  <br/>
been playing The SIMS for hours and hours, every day for a week.  <br/>
They&#39;ve been up until 3 or 4 in the morning playing and slept until 1  <br/>
or 2 in the afternoon.  This is hard for me - I have a little urge  <br/>
inside myself to try to get them to do something more productive.  <br/>
Having been down this road many times before, though, I stifled that  <br/>
urge in myself and purposely thought supportive thoughts (they are  <br/>
having so much fun with this, they are having fun TOGETHER and  <br/>
enjoying a lot of hours of side-by-side play, a lot like when they  <br/>
were little). And then, suddenly, a moment of clarity struck me - my  <br/>
older daughter left last week for Alaska - she&#39;ll be gone for 3 or 4  <br/>
months and most likely will not ever really live at home again. My  <br/>
other girls&#39; response has been to nestle down in the house and play  <br/>
together - play something that involves creating and controlling  <br/>
families&#39; lives (The SIMS). DUH!<br/>
<br/>
So - I got serious about supporting their play time - just by doing  <br/>
little things like helping them find a missing disk and bringing them  <br/>
some food and giving them a little kiss as I walked by, etc. MY  <br/>
realization is what changed - not their behavior - but it changed the  <br/>
entire feeling of our home - in a flash!<br/>
<br/>
Next thing I knew, Rosie was writing a screenplay (NaNoWriMo is  <br/>
sponsoring a screenplay writing month) and she&#39;s using the SIMS to  <br/>
develop the characters and putting them into some kind of storyboard  <br/>
software that Roxana found for her.<br/>
<br/>
The kid who was upset that his mom put his straw in his milk box?  <br/>
Paying more attention might show a series of situations like this one  <br/>
- he probably is reacting to being treated just like the other kids -  <br/>
it probably felt sort of like being part of an assembly-line. It  <br/>
would probably help to single him out more, in advance, and  <br/>
constantly ask him things like, &quot;I&#39;m putting the straws in for the  <br/>
little ones, do you want to do yours, yourself?&quot; Take every  <br/>
opportunity to treat him as different and special.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that you don&#39;t have to have the insight in advance. You  <br/>
don&#39;t always have to have the knowledge of what the kid is going  <br/>
through, what need they are trying to fill. You won&#39;t always know.  <br/>
But if you pay close attention and take on face value what they&#39;re  <br/>
showing you, and take it seriously whether or not you understand it,  <br/>
you&#39;ll often get more insight, sometimes only after-the-fact.<br/>
<br/>
In the post about the kid being upset about mom putting his straw in  <br/>
his milk box for him, it was implied that his reason for &quot;wigging  <br/>
out&quot; was trivial. I think it was supposed to indicate to us that the  <br/>
kid is having meltdowns over such little things.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of considering these little things, consider that they are  <br/>
important and significant enough for a child to be really upset by  <br/>
it, enough to disrupt an otherwise fun outing. This is not a trivial  <br/>
matter, this is a matter that is serious to this child and, if it is  <br/>
important to the child than mom ought to take it very seriously, as  <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
As we get older and our kids grow up, we eventually come to realize  <br/>
that all the big things in our lives are really the direct result of  <br/>
how we&#39;ve handled all the little things.<br/>
<br/>
When people have several young children, they can often get into a  <br/>
sort of mass production, assembly line, mode of operation. In a mall,  <br/>
mom can be focused on getting food into the hands of each of the  <br/>
kids, for example, while making sure none of them are wandering away.  <br/>
Easy to not be aware of how one of the kids might be not comfortable  <br/>
with the assembly-line approach until the kid explodes over some  <br/>
seemingly trivial thing like mom sticking his straw in his milk  <br/>
carton for him.<br/>
<br/>
Take more time to pay more attention. &quot;Sweat the small stuff.&quot; &lt;G&gt;  <br/>
Slow down a lot. Time the extra minutes to check whether or not each  <br/>
kid is comfortable in the car. Check whether each kid is getting the  <br/>
food they really want. Check - &quot;Do you want a straw? Want me to put  <br/>
it in?&quot; Take the time to focus on little things like this and the big  <br/>
things will be good, too. Kids will learn to be more patient with  <br/>
each other, to take care of each other, to pay attention to how  <br/>
others are feeling, etc. Look into their eyes now, check in with how  <br/>
they&#39;re doing, support what is important to them. Life with these  <br/>
kids, when they are teens, will be pleasant and comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
For the parent of the 14 year old - all the exact same advice! Figure  <br/>
out how you might apply it to your situation. Don&#39;t worry that the  <br/>
stakes seem higher - let that go. You still have years!<br/>

<br/>
This has been true in our family.<br/>
It&#39;s another of those unexpected benefits about unschooling that  <br/>
surprised me.  A pleasant surprise.<br/>
<br/>
All my kids can drive now.<br/>
All my kids have had jobs and money.<br/>
<br/>
I see them being responsible and careful and considerate and it&#39;s  <br/>
nothing I could have &quot;taught&quot; them or created through my own effort,  <br/>
but I gave them room to grow, and nurtured them, and kept them safe  <br/>
and happy.<br/>
<br/>
I have trees in my yard that we put in as little seedlings, and some  <br/>
are taller than the house, in ten years for the biggest ones (Western  <br/>
catalpas that came up in a friend&#39;s yard and we transplanted (and  <br/>
four years for the honey locusts) which I grew from seed and are not  <br/>
house-tall, but taller than I am).  I don&#39;t know how those trees grow  <br/>
their branches and leaves.  I didn&#39;t make those trees.  I watered  <br/>
them and kept them safe and they are becoming the trees they had the  <br/>
potential to become.<br/>
<br/>
Those who were once my children are becoming the adults they had the  <br/>
potential to become.<br/>
<br/>
I could have messed those trees up, or pulled them up by the roots,  <br/>
or let them shrivel from lack of water.<br/>
I could have messed those kids up, filled them full of &quot;no&quot; or make  <br/>
them mean and unhappy.<br/>
<br/>
I  made other choices, and the results are good.<br/>

If that happens very often, or if it has happened recently, it&#39;s  <br/>
possible that you (and he) never really deschooled to the point that  <br/>

I am a very introverted person.  I attended public school for grades K-12.<br/>
I definitely didn&#39;t fit in, and I felt horrible about it.  I was made to<br/>
feel that there was something wrong with me because I didn&#39;t have a lot of<br/>
friends.  I didn&#39;t really have any close friends, but I think I would have<br/>
been fine with it if the authorities and other students hadn&#39;t labelled it<br/>
odd.<br/>
<br/>
I have five children, and two of them are very introverted.  There is an<br/>
obvious difference between them and me.  They are so self-confident.  They<br/>
don&#39;t think that there is anything wrong with themselves.  They don&#39;t think<br/>
they need friends, or that they should stay in relationships or social<br/>
situations where they are not having fun.  They live their lives doing<br/>
things they like, spending time the way they want.<br/>
<br/>
I think that the foundation of our differences is that my children were<br/>
never told that they needed to make friends.<br/>
<br/>
Going to public school did not make me more outgoing, it just made me less<br/>
accepting of myself.  I am who I am.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad that my children have had a different kind of life.  They have<br/>
been loved and supported and allowed to be who they are.  They are not more<br/>
outgoing because of unschooling either, but they are happier, and that is<br/>
what matters.<br/>

<br/>
Is it unrealistic to expect him to do things that you arent modeling?<br/>
Do you have interests that you pursue? Do you have hobbies or  <br/>
passions? Do you discuss them with your kids?<br/>
<br/>
What kinds of things are you involved in?<br/>
<br/>
Even if your kids are introverted and shy about new things, you are  <br/>
projecting your own feelings (negative) about yourself onto them. If  <br/>
its their choice, they may be fine with their lives, and isnt that  <br/>
the point?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333936106">This is so true....<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Stop and take a deep breath. Your younger son is not a carbon copy <br/>
&gt; of the older, he is a different person. They may have a lot of <br/>
&gt; similarities, but they are not the same - if nothing else, one has a <br/>
&gt; 22yo older brother and the other has a 14yo younger brother ;) Work <br/>
&gt; on seeing each of them as individuals, with individual needs and <br/>
&gt; goals and feelings. <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest son did stuff that wasn&#39;t good. He left home at 17 in anger <br/>
and did more stuff that wasn&#39;t good. Mostly, I suspect because of the <br/>
disrespectful way I had raised him! I kept expecting my second son to do <br/>
similar things, until one day he said to me - well, shouted, to get my <br/>
attention over the top of my rantings - &quot; I&#39;m NOT him! I&#39;m different! If <br/>
I do do wrong things they&#39;ll be my own wrong things! I&#39;m not him!&quot; and <br/>
that was the real start of me learning to be a better mother. I thanked <br/>
him, and asked him to remind me whenever he felt I needed to be reminded <br/>
of that again - and he did.<br/>
<br/>
Each of my sons is special and wonderful and sometimes awful in his own <br/>
way. I love them to bits - and since I became a more respectful mother, <br/>
honoring their individuality, life has been so much better for all of us <br/>
- and I am closer to my eldest now at 26 (him not me hehe) than since he <br/>
was a baby :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-676392821">This has been an incredible thread for me so thank you Jacquie for <br/>
being so open and honest and thank you everyone for the feedback... <br/>
One of Zak&#39;s passions is Pokemon and being on the computer and <br/>
inside I&#39;m using feeling gripped with the feeling of &quot;oh he SHOULD <br/>
be doing something else that&#39;s teaching him something&quot;  Just that <br/>
thought alone stopped me and made me realize how much he is <br/>
learning.  We talked a lot about Pokemon last night and I was <br/>
astonished at how many websites he&#39;d been on and found out things <br/>
about the creators of Pokemon, how and when it started, all the <br/>
cards and games on line and in boxes, where all the tournaments are <br/>
in the country and on and on and on.... I&#39;d just smiled when he <br/>
talked about this stuff in the past and never really realized how <br/>
much he knew.  He asked me if we could go to Japan where Pokemon <br/>
comes from... My response was if you want to go there then I&#39;m going <br/>
to need to know where, how much it would cost, where would we stay, <br/>
and lots of other questions... He said &quot;I&#39;m getting right onto that <br/>
and finding out the info&quot;... Before the end of the evening he&#39;d <br/>
already been to several websites for travel information and then <br/>
found out that neither he, his brother or dad have passports (I have <br/>
both British and American that are current)... He&#39;s searching the <br/>
British Embassy site as I write to find out about what he needs for <br/>
his British passport (born in USA, but because of me can have a <br/>
British passport)... Next is his USA passport... He asked me for a <br/>
file this morning so that he could start making a file for all the <br/>
information he&#39;s gathering for this trip we are all going to take to <br/>
Japan.... This has been a wonderful, illuminating experience... so <br/>
again Jacque  thank you from the bottom of my heart for expanding <br/>
what was already going on in my house and looking at something from <br/>
a different perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644212166">This board is fast.My network cable shorted out and couldnt get on <br/>
for a few days.Anyway I cant reply to everyone here but I do <br/>
appreciate the replies.Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I think that perhaps I overreacted.I was feeling very low when I <br/>
wrote this.I reread some Holt articles and feel better again.The <br/>
problem is with me not my son.He is happy and so is my 6yo.So I guess <br/>
I just freak out every now and again.I have no support other then my <br/>
hubby and its hard to live in such a small community where the <br/>
schools and education are such a focal point.I over heard a comment <br/>
by someone the other day that really killed me.Someone said that <br/>
homeschooled kids were all wierd and couldnt socialize properly.They <br/>
were commenting on someone elses shy homeschooled kid.My 6yo is very <br/>
outgoing so I know that socialization is not as key as genetics.Some <br/>
kids are social and some arent.<br/>
 Is anyone else as wishy washy as me.I love unschooling I just feel <br/>
that we dont do enough.As in we dont go enough places, have enough <br/>
experiences so the kids will find thier bliss...They cant find it if <br/>
they dont know its out there..<br/>

our <br/>
&gt; situation is healthy.We are horrible hermits and dont like being <br/>
&gt; around people and my 14yo is just like me.I dont want this for him.<br/>
&gt; I wish they had unschooling counseling to help us do this.<br/>
&gt; Ive talked to my son and we have gone over our options<br/>
&gt; 1. Correspondence school(American school(very dry and boring dont <br/>
&gt; think i could make myself do this stuff)<br/>
&gt; 2. Work toward a GED(I personally find these useless but at least <br/>
he <br/>
&gt; is doing something)<br/>
&gt; 3. Go to public school for high school<br/>
&gt; 4. Continue to unschool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But his unschooling consists of getting up at 10:00 and lounging <br/>
&gt; around the house.Playing computer till 10:00 at night then maybe <br/>
&gt; reading a book till 1 or 2am.He doesnt want to try anything new.Ive <br/>
&gt; strewn, Ive suggested.He doesnt like change, he wont try new foods <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; different clothes either.I find myself criticising him all to often <br/>
&gt; lately and dont like it, and know its not helping the situation at <br/>
&gt; all.He fights with his brother or bosses him around constantly.<br/>
&gt; He doesnt want to get a job, and doesnt like any of the above <br/>
options <br/>
&gt; 1 though 3.<br/>
&gt; I feel lost...What are we supposed to be doing? <br/>
&gt; BTW he hates sports so dont suggest joining anything like that.<br/>
&gt; Ive always promised him if hates something he can always quit, Im <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; a monster or anything.I would even let him quit highschool if <br/>
really <br/>
&gt; hated it...<br/>
&gt; I worry because my 22yo son still lives at home, works at a <br/>
&gt; grocerystore without even paid sick days.And has never even been on <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; date with a girl...What is going to become of us?<br/>
