<div id="ygrps-yiv-755206030">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
My hubby and I have gone down the &quot;they need to be doing school stuff&quot; road <br/>
before. What worked for me was to put it on him. He could do school with <br/>
them if he wanted too. You can cram a whole week into Saturday and Sunday <br/>
mornings. We do beleive we learn anywhere we find an interest. Maybe your <br/>
hubby needs to set a learning goal for himself and babystep it until he <br/>
reachs his goal. I also agree being around other confident unschoolers helps <br/>
sell the idea that yes our kids are always learning. I&#39;ll forward my hubby <br/>
good posts to help him be connected to the unschoolers I gain so much from <br/>
also.<br/>
<br/>
