On February 12, I need to be in Bryn Athyn, Pennsylvania, to speak at  <br/>
a church-run marriage conference.  Not my church, but a church.  There  <br/>
will probably be an unschooling talk elsewhere that Friday, for a  <br/>
local homeschooling group.    It seems a shame to go that far for just  <br/>
two days, and so if people have good ideas, please e-mail me.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284396263">You should definitely tour the Bryn Athyn Catherdral and do a little  <br/>
research on the PItcairns beforehand (the family  of &quot;Mutiny on the  <br/>
Bounty&quot; fame).  The other must is either Fonthill,The Mercer Museum,  <br/>
or the Moravian Tile works or all three, the link is here-   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mercermuseum.org/">http://www.mercermuseum.org/</a> <br/>
  .  The Mercer Museum is the collection of Henry Mercer who sought to  <br/>
collect and categorize the outmoded material of daily life before the  <br/>
Industrial revolution.  It is a really cool place.  The Tile works is  <br/>
a little ways away but is really neat as well and still makes  <br/>
craftsman tiles, and Fonthill was his home (castle).  I grew up in  <br/>
Bucks County PA and would spend hours and hours just hanging out in  <br/>
the before mentioned places.  Peddler&#39;s Village and New Hope  are also  <br/>
neat to visit, albeit slightly farther away.  The little movie theater  <br/>
in Newtown (near Bryn Athyn) still had a pipe organ upfront when I was  <br/>
a kid.  February will be cold though, pack warm.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653228376">This article (My Kids Listen...) reminded me of an exchange I had with my neighbor (traditionally schooling her 7 year old). <br/>
<br/>
We were taking a walk together and the boys (mine 9 & 6, hers 7) were on their scooters.  Whenever we came up to a stop sign or crossroads, she was clearly in a panic, frantically yelling at her kid to stop. I never said anything to mine, but of course they stopped when they needed to to check for traffic before they crossed. <br/>
<br/>
She was incredulous: &quot;how do they know to stop if you don&#39;t tell them to??&quot;  It honestly took me a minute to answer, but when I did, I said &quot;Um, common sense?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It never occured to her (or her kid, sadly) that her son might have his own sense of self-preservation if she hadn&#39;t hijacked it from him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-974988951">If thats is it Sandra (I&#39;m assuming so)  It&#39;s great.  I love reading peoples thought processes.<br/>
I think we all have feelings of missed opportunities or when we feel that we have miss-represented ourselves. It&#39;s nice to read how she might have wanted to respond...  have to file that in the memory banks so I can reflect on it in similar circumstances.  <br/>

<br/>
Margaux, even at 9, will stop and wait at the crosswalk.  I still need to tell <br/>
her, &quot;it&#39;s okay, there are no cars, you can go if there are no cars!&quot;  She likes <br/>
the reassurance from me that her instincts were right to wait and that it is <br/>
right to cross!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1524099265">Yes, that was the one.<br/>

I wanted to cite it in this:<br/>

<br/>
I started writing it early yesterday, but didn&#39;t finish until midday  <br/>
today.  I had vaguely hoped to have it done before last night&#39;s chat,  <br/>
but as it turned out, it was better to be able to refer to chat as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-714698574">That was a very good chat yesterday. The first hour was hetic.<br/>
I am glad I went back in when Gigi was asleep even if I could not type<br/>
or participate in the great discussion for the second hour of it.<br/>
Thanks Sandra for hosting it. <br/>
Lots of clarity in my head I could not sleep thinking about it but <br/>
it was in a good way. Woke up great the next day.<br/>
