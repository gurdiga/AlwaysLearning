<div id="ygrps-yiv-181668149">Dismiss their interests as trivial or too much trouble for not enough gain. <br/>
<br/>
Come prepared with no; only occasionally say yes.<br/>
<br/>
Have preconceived notions about television and food that you are unwilling to explore. <br/>
<br/>
Live a very routine life. Don&#39;t look for new experiences, new ideas, new people, new places. Do the things you know. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110987622">* Don&#39;t allow a mess, or always make kids clean up<br/>
* Look for who&#39;s to blame when things get stressful<br/>
* Tell kids how their experiments will turn out <br/>
* Project the future from small daily events<br/>
* Micromanage so things turn out the way the parent &#39;knows&#39; is best<br/>
* Assign life experiences a different &#39;learning value&#39; and steer kids, &quot;subtly&quot; towards what you see as more valuable <br/>
   I am at times guilty of all of these although I am actually too poor a housekeeper for the first error to be apparent to most people!  Still it was fun to get to articulate them. Thanks for the opportunity.  Cameron<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-698460179">This is basically just a beginning list of fallacies which I as an adult can<br/>
easily refute.  As a child, I couldn&#39;t figure my way round them because I<br/>
wanted to be able to do what was asked (even demanded):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*Tell them they can&#39;t do or have something until they&#39;re old enough or have<br/>
earned it or attained some other achievement first.<br/>
<br/>
*See your income as strictly yours and not belonging to anyone else in the<br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
*See other items belonging to you as strictly yours and not to be touched<br/>
especially by sticky careless kid fingers.<br/>
<br/>
*Be sure to point out all the watermarks on the furniture.<br/>
<br/>
*Keep in mind that if you don&#39;t complain, children might think you don&#39;t<br/>
care.<br/>
<br/>
*At least LOOK like you&#39;re in charge.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003713006">* Set your default response to &quot;no.&quot;<br/>
   In my family we have long called this the &quot;Automatic NO Button.&quot;  The kids and I  knew about this even before we started unschooling, from their grandmother and other kids&#39; parents mostly.  I have seen that many overwhelmed mothers have a very strong automatic no button.  It&#39;s especially bad in those who also think that once you say no you must never back down or change your mind.  I so much hated the automatic no button as a child that I had already developed the theory that overwhelmed/overtired people say &quot;No!&quot; immediately because they can&#39;t imagine one more thing/idea/job to deal with.  Maybe they are also emotionally overloaded.  This is so common in our culture.  Some of the women I work with have been open to learning to watch for their tendency to automatically say NO if I lead into the discussion with understanding that they are overwhelmed, and the term &quot;automatic no button&quot; lends some humor to the discussion to help them stay<br/>
 open. My Mom has even learned to wait if I preface a discussion during one of her visits with, &quot;Watch out, Mom.  This may hit the automatic no button!&quot;  So real. Cameron<br/>

more valuable than another - i.e. reading, writing, algebra, board  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029325413">*Up until a couple of years ago, I used to take my kids to Borders every<br/>
Friday evening. They&#39;d have live music at 7 and we&#39;d get there around six,<br/>
with plenty of time to browse around and shop, pick a cozy chair to sit near<br/>
the performers and pick an armful of books to look at while we listened. As<br/>
a rule the kids each automatically had $5 to spend on (generally one) book,<br/>
unless they&#39;d brought any extra pocket money.  It was great to watch them<br/>
develop strategies for picking that one book each week, and see if they&#39;d<br/>
put it aside after paying for it (and use the time there to look at other<br/>
books) or if they couldn&#39;t resist and dove in immediately. For a while we<br/>
ran into some of the same people regularly (an older lady and her two grown<br/>
daughters, a dad with a toddler who was at first shy with my kids, then<br/>
would dance on the aisle with them as soon as the music started). When the<br/>
musicians were done and packing up, my kids would go up to talk to them<br/>
while I paid for our books. So many great memories made there!*<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507615428">Thanks for starting this thread.  I must have been processing these<br/>
posts in my sleep because I woke up and these came to mind:<br/>
<br/>
* Follow someone else&#39;s &quot;age-appropriate&quot; guidelines.<br/>
<br/>
Worry:<br/>
  * Focus too much on how your kids will &quot;turn out&quot; instead of<br/>
enjoying who they are right now.<br/>
<br/>
  * Believe that life is divided into school subjects and worry &quot;how<br/>
will my kids ever learn x&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
  Similar to &quot;compare your children to other children&quot;: <br/>
  * Be impatient and worry or expect that your kid should be doing<br/>
something, e.g., reading, because their friends of the same age can<br/>
all do it.<br/>
<br/>
Under &quot;Responses&quot;:<br/>
  * When asked the reason you said &quot;no&quot;, respond with &quot;because I said so&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Under &quot;Don&#39;t talk to kids&quot; and similar to &quot;Don&#39;t ever talk to them<br/>
about situations that could be handled better the next time.&quot;:<br/>
  * &quot;Unparent&quot; -- give kids &quot;free reign&quot; without talking to them re:<br/>
appropriateness of their actions (affecting others and others&#39; property).<br/>
<br/>
In reading through other&#39;s posts, it looks like there&#39;s a lot under<br/>
the theme of &quot;control&quot;, e.g., &quot;controlling the home environment&quot;,<br/>
&quot;controlling money and purchases&quot;, &quot;controlling food&quot;, &quot;controlling<br/>
media&quot;, etc.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, this is my first post to this list (been lurking and learning for<br/>
a while -- thanks for all the wisdom).  I have a 3.5yo son.<br/>

I tried to categorize two things, and I don&#39;t like what I chose.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t Advise<br/>
&quot;Unparent&quot;�give kids &quot;free reign&quot; without talking to them re:  <br/>
appropriateness of their actions (affecting others and others&#39;  <br/>
property).<br/>
Don&#39;t help your kid understand the ways of the world and boundaries  <br/>
and what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong.<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t advise&quot; isn&#39;t what I mean, I think.  I&#39;m thinking it should be  <br/>
something like &quot;Don&#39;t counsel respectfully&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t help them  <br/>
understand the world&quot;  but it should be short.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have a great idea?<br/>
In other places where there were sets, I did this:<br/>
<br/>
Responses:<br/>
Set your default response to &quot;no.&quot; **<br/>
Come prepared with no; only occasionally say yes.<br/>
When asked the reason you said &quot;no&quot;, respond with &quot;because I said so&quot;.<br/>
&quot;Interests&quot;:<br/>
Don&#39;t show any interest in their interests.<br/>
Dismiss their interests as trivial or too much trouble for not enough  <br/>
gain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-518520100">Well, the short phrase I use for this sort of thing is &quot;tugging my <br/>
coat&quot; or &quot;tugging my sleeve&quot;.  But this is perhaps a little esoteric, <br/>
urban, and maybe a little ungainly.  Maybe, &quot;imparting wisdom&quot; or <br/>
just &quot;wisdom&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
How do you say no to that? <br/>
<br/>
well, I rarely say no to anything food, but we do limit things due to finances.  we can try one new fruit today, and another one next time we come to the store. <br/>
<br/>
Today we also bought chocolate candy covered sunflower seeds...<br/>
