<div id="ygrps-yiv-2142957325">Thanks for all your posts. I have read a lot about both sides of TV. I <br/>
am from A country where there are 5 channels! Of course there is still <br/>
violence, killing, commercials and other in your face stuff, however, <br/>
the technology here in USA has always been somewhat overwhelming for <br/>
me. But, I do live here, and so do my kids. SO. I will think through <br/>
all of this info. (Yes, in my own head)! You guys were all pretty <br/>
supportive and that was what I was looking for. I even appreciate the <br/>
sarcasm. By the way. I am really not anti TV. Just looking for ideas <br/>
and advice. Now. Back to lurking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-953467481">Hi, <br/>
Forgive me if I&#39;m outta line, but I&#39;ve been reading all this discussion<br/>
about TV, and while I agree totally with the bunking of ridiculous<br/>
anti-TV &quot;evidence&quot; and I&#39;m completely on the path of not &quot;limiting&quot;<br/>
anything, including TV, I just wanted to say how I *feel*<br/>
I *feel* like TV is evil.  Well not &quot;evil&quot; in the christain devil and<br/>
brimstone sence, but for me, it&#39;s not a good thing.<br/>
I can&#39;t really explain that.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a very secular home where we were allowed to watch as much<br/>
TV as we liked, we came home from school and turned the TV on.  we<br/>
&quot;zombied&quot; in front of it till dinner time, and then went straight back<br/>
to it.  the only self-imposed respite from TV was computer games, of<br/>
which we always had plenty.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that a lot of things that are products of our modern technology<br/>
culture are bad.  I dont know why that is.  I just feel that way.<br/>
Now I&#39;m grown-up and I have a daughter and I guess I&#39;m what a lot of<br/>
americans would call &quot;crunchy&quot; in the extreme.<br/>
<br/>
We dont have a TV at home, simply because I dont want one.  When I stay<br/>
somewhere that has a TV, I still go and sit in front of it for hours<br/>
without break.  That&#39;s why I dont have a TV, I dont like it&#39;s effect on<br/>
*me*. <br/>
<br/>
I do have a computer that plays DVDs and we watch plenty of them, as<br/>
well as downloading loads of shows and movies.  My daughter is allowed<br/>
to use the computer and to watch as much as she likes, I dont limit her<br/>
on that, and she&#39;s allowed to watch TV if she is somewhere that has<br/>
one.  I just choose not to have one in my house, because I *feel* that<br/>
it&#39;s bad.<br/>
<br/>
I could follow the parents out there who feel that TV is bad, for<br/>
whatever reason and start quoting a bunch of &quot;evidence&quot; supporting my<br/>
belief, but I agree, the &quot;evidence&quot; is flawed and we can find<br/>
statistics that prove ANYTHING if we want.  <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share another perspective.  For some people, (me) TV<br/>
IS bad, without needing any &quot;evidence&quot;, my feelings are valid.  Of<br/>
course, that doesnt mean that I have the right to go spouting some<br/>
illogical creed as a justification for limiting my own child in doing<br/>
something that I feel is bad for me.  She does lots of things that I<br/>
think are revolting, like eating raspberry popsicles! ;)<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not about forgiveness of individuals, it&#39;s about discussion of  <br/>
ideas.  Don&#39;t personalize it.<br/>

<br/>
But you watch shows on the computer.  Somehow you&#39;re  <br/>
compartmentalizing these things.  Would you let her read, but NOT let  <br/>
her into a library or bookstore?  Is the magic difference that you&#39;re  <br/>
the one choosing the programs?  Is it that there aren&#39;t  <br/>
advertisements or news shows?<br/>

<br/>
Maybe if you had one at your house and worked on making conscious  <br/>
decisions about what to do with your time instead of blaming the box,  <br/>
you wouldn&#39;t want to sit in front of it at other people&#39;s houses.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
I feel that a lot of things that are products of our modern technology<br/>
culture are bad. I dont know why that is. I just feel that way.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Now that you have a daughter you should not just not know why you  <br/>
feel certain ways.  It&#39;s probably time to really analyze WHY, so that  <br/>
you don&#39;t pass illogical prejudices on to her, or limit her life by  <br/>
your unexamined fears.<br/>
<br/>
-=-without needing any &quot;evidence&quot;, my feelings are valid. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You call them valid, but that doesn&#39;t create validity.<br/>
If I feel aluminum foil will protect me from having my mind read,  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t make it a valid belief.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Of<br/>
course, that doesnt mean that I have the right to go spouting some<br/>
illogical creed as a justification for limiting my own child in doing<br/>
something that I feel is bad for me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What are you going to do when she wants a TV?  Will she feel it&#39;s a  <br/>
possibility or will she just not even ask?<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching 12 year old kids, some of them had NO print  <br/>
material at home, at all.  Not a newspaper, not a book.  The parents  <br/>
didn&#39;t want it.  The parents figured there were books at school and  <br/>
the kids could read books there.  When I was little my parents didn&#39;t  <br/>
own books really�my mom a few pamphlets and magazines and one  <br/>
cookbook. They did get the newspaper, and bought us comic books and I  <br/>
was in a couple of kid bookclubs.  But I saw houses with nothing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-185956936">What would be out of line would be for a parent to publicly defend  <br/>
refusing to even examine or rationally consider beliefs that he or  <br/>
she is imposing on his/her children - to insist that they are &quot;valid&quot;  <br/>
just because they are his/hers.<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t understand how an intelligent, thinking person could  <br/>
simply not care whether beliefs are rational, logical, and based on  <br/>
the reality of how unschooling works. Unschooling doesn&#39;t work so  <br/>
well in families where parents are into control. It doesn&#39;t work so  <br/>
well in families where parents have a lot of fears. It doesn&#39;t work  <br/>
so well in families where parents tend to set limits and want to  <br/>
narrow a child&#39;s world.<br/>
<br/>
We all have to be careful about extrapolating from our own childhood  <br/>
experiences into our unschooled kids lives - they are living such  <br/>
very different lives, so VERY different from the experience of going  <br/>
to school, day after day.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to raise kids WITH a tv in the house and not have them  <br/>
distracted by it from doing other cool things or attracted to it  <br/>
against their will. None of my kids is drawn to tv in some weird way  <br/>
- they are calm and comfortable about tv, just like about books,  <br/>
games, cooking, swimming, talking, drawing, etc. There is absolutely  <br/>
no difference in how they treat tv than how they treat anything else.  <br/>
They are selective, they don&#39;t become zombies when watching, they  <br/>
don&#39;t give up other activities to watch tv, they&#39;re definitely not  <br/>
couch potatoes.<br/>
<br/>
My husband grew up in Iran - lived in a very small town, no  <br/>
electricity, etc., until he was 12 and then in a city with  <br/>
black&white tv and only a couple of channels, until he was 23. He is  <br/>
most definitely THE most avid tv-watcher in our family, by far. TV- <br/>
free childhood isn&#39;t going to make children less attracted to it -  <br/>
human nature really just doesn&#39;t work that way.<br/>

<br/>
Not a week ago someone said something like &quot;Not all children are like  <br/>

right off that their children don&#39;t have the potential or the value  <br/>

it can be undone.  People&#39;s thinking can change.  Their attitudes  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We recently had friends visiting from out of town, with a 9, 5, and 2 <br/>
yos. I didnt get really into her &quot;tv philosophy&quot; because i wanted to <br/>
keep everything light, and didnt want to have to defend my position. <br/>
But it was clear that she&#39;s restrictive about it (was before even <br/>
having kids.) I thought it ironic how her oldest was totally &quot;sucked <br/>
into&quot; the computer, wanted to stay up later playing it, wanted to play <br/>
it early when he woke up. It was a &quot;violent&quot; game (uhhh...cartoony <br/>
sword play, knights and dragons stuff), something he wouldnt be <br/>
allowed to play at home, although his mother let up while he was here. <br/>
<br/>
But i&#39;m betting that because he was soooo drawn to it, his mom was <br/>
thinking &quot;see, if i let him play that at home, it would be ALL he <br/>
wanted to do...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My son decided to no longer bring his PSP to the HS group <br/>
because &quot;thats all the kids want to do, since they don&#39;t have one at <br/>
home&quot;...but again, i bet the anti-video game moms are <br/>
thinking &quot;see...if i let him have that game, all he would want to do <br/>
is play it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The basis of attachment parenting is the belief that if you meet a <br/>
child&#39;s need, the need is fulfilled and goes away. (If a child knows <br/>
you will be there for him, he is more comfortable seperating because <br/>
he knows he can come back to you.) Yet somehow AP parents lose this <br/>
when it comes to other things....like food/chores/bedtime/tv....my son <br/>
can EASILY walk away from tv/computer/videogames if there is something <br/>
better to do, because he knows it will be there. But our poor little <br/>
friend knew that once he left our house he&#39;d never see AdventureQuest <br/>
again, so he&#39;d better try to get his fill. <br/>

<br/>
My sister told me, after her kids once again argued over who would  <br/>
get to play video games when they were visiting outside their home,  <br/>
that she would never buy her kids a video game system, because they  <br/>
would fight over it.<br/>
<br/>
I asked if she&#39;d feel better spending her money on something that  <br/>
wasn&#39;t interesting enough to fight about, or some such.  She looked  <br/>
at me with that blinky stare that means &quot;processing... processing&quot;  <br/>
and within the month bought them a Sega system.  My niece was maybe  <br/>
seven then, and now she&#39;s 21, and she still does art based on Sonic  <br/>
the Hedgehog.  Pretty fancy art.  She also (to tie back to TV &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
learned LOTS of drawing from the PBS drawing shows by Mark Kistler  <br/>
(who is himself anti-TV--a wonderful irony, because if you&#39;ve ever  <br/>
heard of him, it&#39;s because he was on TV for years).<br/>

Here&#39;s the beginning of it, but there&#39;s lots more, and the formatting  <br/>
is better at the link.<br/>
<br/>
Television, Children and Making Decisions Rationally<br/>
<br/>
In an online discussion on TV and unschooling, Vijay Owens gave some  <br/>
wonderful responses about children learning to make their own  <br/>
choices, and in the faith she has in her children&#39;s learning. The  <br/>
other mom&#39;s quotes are italicized and indented; the others are  <br/>
Vijay&#39;s. �Sandra<br/>
<br/>
If we don&#39;t let our kids determine for themselves what is crap and  <br/>
what isn&#39;t how will they ever know the difference? Will they always  <br/>
look to someone else to tell them what their opinions are if we  <br/>
choose to do it for them? I want my kids to have their own opinions.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think my not having a TV will prevent my kids from having  <br/>
their own opinions?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not what I said. I just want to get in the habit of letting my  <br/>
kids make up their own minds in general. Food, bedtime, books, tv,  <br/>
whatever. Within reason. Obviously this is not an &quot;anything goes&quot;  <br/>
situation, I use my judgement. If you want to make up their minds for  <br/>
them on the issue of television, that is your choice.<br/>
<br/>
Do you think there&#39;s not other kinds of crap to weed through in life  <br/>
besides what&#39;s on TV?<br/>
<br/>
Of course there is crap in other areas of life! Some books are crap,  <br/>
but that is just my opinion. It doesn&#39;t mean that I think they  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t exist, or that people shouldn&#39;t read them. Many times I&#39;ve  <br/>
started to read a book and then thought, you know, this just isn&#39;t  <br/>
doing it for me. So I put the book down. I don&#39;t burn it, or write  <br/>
angry letters to the author or publisher, I just put the book down.  <br/>
Same with TV. If I think a show has potential and I start watching  <br/>
it, if I don&#39;t like it I turn the channel or I turn it off. I don&#39;t  <br/>
give away my TV or tell other people that they should to, or that  <br/>
they are somehow damaging their children by letting them watch Sesame  <br/>
Street.....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>First of all, are you sure that your car will not spontaneously combust when<br/>
you get in it next? Are you sure the next time you&#39;re at the grocery store<br/>
that there&#39;s not a bomb planted there? Of course you can&#39;t be sure of either<br/>
of those two things, but the best information you have so far should satisfy<br/>
you such that you&#39;ll get in your car and drive to the grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t make you accept this idea, but so far I have read many people&#39;s<br/>
real-life experiences with unschooling and no limits on TV, and no one has<br/>
produced a person that you are afraid your child will become. That&#39;s<br/>
probably as good of evidence as you are going to get. I don&#39;t think there is<br/>
more that this list can offer you this way. We talk about what&#39;s real and at<br/>
the moment we are probably the best source of information about the results<br/>
of unschooling. You and anyone else can continue to ask the same questions,<br/>
and have the same fear of making a &quot;big mistake&quot; (when really, how big could<br/>
this mistake be...what is the worst case scenario in your mind?), or you<br/>
could try it out and see for yourself. It appears that nothing else will<br/>
convince you anyway.<br/>

You have real kids, right? You have to think about your own kids, not  <br/>

with any kind of &quot;tv issues.&quot; Our kids don&#39;t obsessively watch it and  <br/>
they don&#39;t vilify it and they treat it casually and calmly just  <br/>
exactly the way they treat other things in their lives like books,  <br/>

I recall you have a 13 yo and an 8 yo - is that right?<br/>

limits. Tell us what they said.<br/>

300,000 children over many years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204179123">-=-I was not referring to my own children, but to children in  <br/>
general.-=-<br/>
<br/>
On this list I want to talk about unschooled children, when we&#39;re  <br/>
talking about ideals and possibilities and experiences.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not all children are like Holly&quot; is more accusation than  <br/>
information.    If we name any one person we can say &quot;not all people  <br/>
are like that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a good idea to wait to post until there&#39;s something  <br/>
helpful to say.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is about discussion of ideas, don&#39;t personalize it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Where in the paragraph below have I personalized?  I didn&#39;t even  <br/>
remember who wrote the thing about Holly.  It WAS about the idea of  <br/>
defensiveness and resistence.  It is about the idea of people batting  <br/>
away real information with &quot;yeah, but&quot; excuses.<br/>
<br/>
This paragraph is not personalized to any person.  It&#39;s general.<br/>
-=-Not a week ago someone said something like &quot;Not all children are like<br/>
Holly,&quot; and I thought it was sad for some people to seem to decide<br/>
right off that their children don&#39;t have the potential or the value<br/>
or something that other people&#39;s kids do. That&#39;s VERY negative, but<br/>
it can be undone. People&#39;s thinking can change. Their attitudes<br/>
toward their children can be improved.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now... are you saying absolutely (and I am confused) that no child<br/>
without restrictions has ever or will ever watch TV obsessively? only<br/>
unschooled kids won&#39;t? These double negatives are getting to me... :)  <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Instead of asking questions that seem to show you want absolute rules  <br/>
instead of principles you can apply to your own life, please read  <br/>
what&#39;s already been written by several people here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m saying absolutely is that negative attitudes are harmful but  <br/>
can be undone.  People&#39;s thinking can change, but it has to change  <br/>
from the inside.  Learning happens because people make connections  <br/>
inside themselves, not because they badger others to state something  <br/>
absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-are you saying absolutely (and I am confused) that no child<br/>
without restrictions has ever or will ever watch TV obsessively?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What others have written seems to be being ignored in favor of  <br/>
zeroing in on me, my family, what I said.  Others have written (and  <br/>
it made sense when I read it; you might want to go back and look for  <br/>
those) that unhappiness and boredom and depression and stress can  <br/>
make TV attractive.  It&#39;s a way to be alone even in the midst of  <br/>
other people, in those cases.  It&#39;s escape, just as reading a book or  <br/>
listening to music can be.  Making live happier and more interesting  <br/>
will make learning better, and easier, and if there are many good  <br/>
alternatives (as others have stated), TV won&#39;t be the only choice.   <br/>
If in the midst of many other choices that ARE appealing to the  <br/>
children (not just judged better by the mom), the child still chooses  <br/>
to watch a TV show, the mom will know that was a choice in a rich  <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
The choices children make in a thin, boring, negative environment  <br/>
can&#39;t really be held up to the choices kids make in best-possible  <br/>
unschooling nests, can they?  Energy spent thinking or saying &quot;it&#39;s  <br/>
not FAYER&quot; should be put instead into working on getting unschooling  <br/>
in all kinds of ways so that TV isn&#39;t looming so large on the  <br/>
horizon, but is jut one of those things, smaller than people, part of  <br/>
a rich, busy life.<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s the result many people want.  They want to challenge  <br/>
us and win so they can feel justified in ignoring us.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s related emotionally and intellectually, I think, to Bible  <br/>
inerrancy.  To those who have been taught there is ONE book and it is  <br/>
flawless and doesn&#39;t contradict itself, all they have to do to reject  <br/>
the whole thing is to find one flaw.  They wanted to cling to the  <br/>
idea that there was one perfect set of rules they could follow  <br/>
without thinking very hard, or reject altogether as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a much harder thing to come to believe that everything we do is  <br/>
a choice based on the best we know and can do, and that each of us  <br/>
needs to know and understand why and on what basis we will make the  <br/>
choices we make.<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely, the opportunity for blind following still exists.  There  <br/>
are churches, communities, political beliefs, diets, curriculum  <br/>
choices, etc. that will sell you the whole kit.  You can follow  <br/>
along, dress like them, buy their workbooks, pay again next year for  <br/>
a new set of books, and they WILL give you simple answers to simple  <br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t one of those.  This list isn&#39;t everything to anyone.   <br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean to be, it can&#39;t be.  This list, this philosophy of  <br/>
unschooling, says &quot;The world is big; live in it.   Look around,  <br/>
compare things, THINK!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t an easy answer, and it doesn&#39;t fall to lame  <br/>
criticisms, either.  Homeschoolers at large hear &quot;What about  <br/>
socialization/math/jobs/college?&quot;  Unschoolers hear all that plus a  <br/>
whole other layer of the same old, same old arguments and questions.<br/>
<br/>
We can help other people who have those arguments, but those who have  <br/>
really seen unschooling take root in their real lives with their real  <br/>
kids, whose lives are more peaceful and sensible and rich, can&#39;t be  <br/>
harmed by those arguments and questions.<br/>

It&#39;s hard to discuss some aspects of all this.  I think everyone has  <br/>
to be convinced by really seeing it, but one can&#39;t see what it is  <br/>
without dropping the noisy overlay of the recitation of what is it NOT.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of anyone who stays and argues for a year without sharing  <br/>
stories of what really is or isn&#39;t working at home, without  <br/>
indicating that there&#39;s any actual change taking place, I think of this:<br/>
-=-Once upon a time a confident and experienced scholar went to the  <br/>

It&#39;s not a competition.  We&#39;re not setting up school and choosing A  <br/>
students with a Valedictorian.   Some people come here, read for a  <br/>
month, go away quietly and make their lives better. (Some do that  <br/>
after a day, I think.) Some argue for six months, have an epiphany  <br/>
(usually because of something that happened at home, not because of  <br/>
something they read) and stick around to help other people.  Some  <br/>
think they&#39;ve got it, and after a year or two come back and say &quot;NOW  <br/>
I got it, when (this or that) happened.&quot;   There are some of those  <br/>
accounts here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/gettingit">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/gettingit</a><br/>

<br/>
Maybe because of school thinking some people refuse to go back to the  <br/>
beginning information if they don&#39;t consider themselves beginners,  <br/>
but I see karate teachers still do the first forms they ever learned,  <br/>
even when nobody&#39;s looking.  I see athletes stretch before they go  <br/>
out.  I see people re-read books they already &quot;know&quot; because they  <br/>
want the reminder of the feeling of that information, and every time  <br/>
they read it THEY are different, have different knowledge and  <br/>
experiences, and they are older.<br/>
<br/>
I re-read other people&#39;s deschooling articles sometimes and it&#39;s  <br/>
soothing and strengthening for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103167750">Cool, Pam!  Thank you for finding that.  I&#39;ve added it to my TV page  <br/>
already.<br/>
<br/>
So... they found it&#39;s not a big deal but slightly to the better-than- <br/>
not side?<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if someday there will be a study about whether parental  <br/>
approval and shared experiences make TV a better resource than  <br/>
parental disapproval and separateness?   I&#39;ve seen it be true in all  <br/>
the cases I&#39;ve seen it attempted. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
To be technically fair (&quot;fair&quot; meaning a technical thing here), John  <br/>
Holt about whom the intro of this list gushes expressed anti-TV  <br/>
bias.  To be fair to real life, he was an unmarried childless  <br/>
intellectual and his TV experience was black and white stuff in the  <br/>
50&#39;s and 60&#39;s.  Lots of people made longterm TV decisions based on  <br/>
that, and so missed the new-improved all-color 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.  Again,  <br/>
it doesn&#39;t harm my kids that that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt wouldn&#39;t be able to hang out with my kids, Pam&#39;s, Joyce&#39;s,  <br/>
Kelly&#39;s, Ren&#39;s and still say anything bad about TV freedoms.     <br/>
Looking at TV and speculating is one thing.  Looking at real  <br/>
unschooled kids directly is a whole &#39;nother world.<br/>

I hope it&#39;s not happening on the newer lists like AlwaysUnschooled  <br/>

<br/>
I hope it&#39;s not, but I&#39;d guess it is.<br/>

two while they think about it.  Poor kids.<br/>

&gt; advertisements or news shows?<br/>
<br/>
For some reason, you just assumed that I am the one choosing the<br/>
programmes.  Firstly, I dont do that, as I SAID, I DONT limit my<br/>
daughter&#39;s viewing at all, she can explore on the net, watch any DVD<br/>
or download any show she likes, and she can watch TV in places where<br/>
it&#39;s available.  <br/>
<br/>
Really, there&#39;s far more news and advertising to be had on the<br/>
internet than on TV, especially a lot of the cable channels that dont<br/>
have any commercials at all. There is in fact, advertising right here<br/>
on this list page. I just dont have one in my house, because that&#39;s<br/>
something I dont want.<br/>
<br/>
I personally have a problem with it.  If I had a problem with alcohol<br/>
I would also choose not to have alcohol in my house.  I have had TV in<br/>
my home before, and for *me* it was a problem, a serious addiction. <br/>
Yes, an addiction, in the scary sense of the word, I neglegted my life<br/>
while watching TV.  Yes, I have some issues to work out with that one,<br/>
a whole super-centre full of trauma, and TV ended up being my<br/>
addiction (better than crack anyway ;) )<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; -=-without needing any &quot;evidence&quot;, my feelings are valid. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You call them valid, but that doesn&#39;t create validity.<br/>
&gt; If I feel aluminum foil will protect me from having my mind read,  <br/>
&gt; that doesn&#39;t make it a valid belief.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, if I feel a certain way, no matter how irrational or<br/>
illogical, its still a feeling.  It is valid, as a feeling, in it&#39;s place.<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; What are you going to do when she wants a TV?  Will she feel it&#39;s a  <br/>
&gt; possibility or will she just not even ask?<br/>
<br/>
Please dont project on me that I&#39;m an authoritarian parent who is<br/>
resrticting and limiting, or anything.  If my daughter wants to have a<br/>
TV and she asks for one, then she&#39;ll get it.  Just like she gets<br/>
raspberry popsicles when she wants one, even though I find them<br/>
repulsive and wouldnt have one myself.<br/>
<br/>
We also dont have a swimming pool but that doesnt mean that I restrict<br/>
my daughter from swimming.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just a parent who is genuinely committed to unschooling, and I<br/>
join these groups for support and learning.  I didnt come here to<br/>
criticize you, there&#39;s no need to be so defensive.<br/>

over feelings on this group.  My only intention was to share another<br/>
perspective.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Feelings are often discussed here.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you expected people to &quot;validate&quot; your feelings? To say, &quot;Well,  <br/>
if you FEEL that way, then that&#39;s the way you feel and it must be  <br/>
right for you.&quot; Stuff like that?<br/>
<br/>
You posted about your feelings that tv is evil. Maybe what we should  <br/>
have started talking about is what to do when we have such irrational  <br/>
strong feelings - feelings that fly in the face of reality.<br/>
<br/>
Especially given what you&#39;ve added, later, that your child IS  <br/>
watching a lot of tv programming, but just not on a tv in your own  <br/>
house (on the computer or at other people&#39;s houses), it seems what  <br/>
you have is some sort of phobia about the physical equipment itself -  <br/>
the actual television set? A phobia - an extreme and irrational fear  <br/>
or aversion toward something.<br/>
<br/>
You can avoid having a tv in your house as long as your child doesn&#39;t  <br/>
outright ask for one - but how horrible for her to think that her  <br/>
mommy considers something she wants to be horrible and evil. So - the  <br/>
first thing I&#39;d suggest is to not pass on your own phobia to your child.<br/>
<br/>
Phobias can be overcome - and working at that can take a big chunk of  <br/>
negativity out of your own mind - one that you&#39;re so used to that you  <br/>
don&#39;t realize it was there until it is gone.<br/>
<br/>
This may ALL be off base and anyone who thinks tv is really &quot;evil&quot; is  <br/>
free to ignore it. But it might be true for some.<br/>
<br/>
And - I don&#39;t see anybody here being defensive. Like I said before,  <br/>
my kids are grown, they grew up without tv limitations and they don&#39;t  <br/>
have tv issues. I have nothing to gain or lose here - I&#39;m past this  <br/>
kind of decision.<br/>

<br/>
It might be true for some if their life is built on flimsy nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
I might have a feeling that cockroaches get really big when I&#39;m  <br/>
asleep and put my clothes on and dance around the room.  If I really  <br/>
felt that, would it be &quot;a valid feeling&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If I thought that anything worldly would risk my children&#39;s eternal  <br/>
souls and so the best thing would be to hit them with a stick (wooden  <br/>
spoon, belt, whatever) if they watched TV, because TV was evil (i.e.  <br/>
a Satanic threat to their souls) would that be a valid feeling?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who believes TV is evil or that cockroaches get really big at  <br/>
night, dress up and dance might want to dig deep and  send me a love  <br/>
offering through PayPal at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a><br/>
Someday we might have dancing cockroach satanic TV theme park in  <br/>
South Carolina or Tennessee or wherever might be appropriate for such  <br/>
things.  Keep those cards and letters coming.<br/>

<br/>
Working on webpages, I found a great bit written a while back that  <br/>
mentions specifically &quot;Evil&quot; in reference to TV:<br/>
=======================================<br/>

~~my husband has enforced a rule that we don&#39;t watch tv during the  <br/>
day.~~<br/>
<br/>
I did something similar when we were first starting out. We had begun  <br/>
unschooling, (or at least I thought we had) and a few months had  <br/>
passed by and I began to get scared that our boys weren&#39;t &#39;doing&#39;  <br/>
enough, or &#39;learning&#39; enough, and all they wanted to do was to sit  <br/>
around and watch TV and play video games. I hit the panic button and  <br/>
put limits on everything (TV & video games) they wanted to do. It was  <br/>
a disaster! They immediately began to &quot;do&quot; things, and as soon as I  <br/>
got home from work they would tell me or show me what they had  <br/>
&quot;done&quot;, and I would ooo and ahhh over whatever it was, but soon  <br/>
realized that they didn&#39;t care about my oooing and ahhing, they had  <br/>
done &quot;it&quot; so they could get their reward--TV! In my attempt to guide  <br/>
them to &#39;bigger and better&#39; things, all I had done was to replace one  <br/>
reward system (grades) with another (TV & video games). They didn&#39;t  <br/>
care about &#39;doing&#39; things, they only cared about doing what it took  <br/>
to get their reward. Just like they did in school.<br/>
<br/>
Until your children realize that the real reward Iaid out before them.<br/>
<br/>
It may seem that the things you read about on these message boards,  <br/>
and the children we all talk about here are...unique, in their true  <br/>
desire to learn, and you may not be able to fathom that your children  <br/>
could be this way too, but I&#39;ve found in our case that our children  <br/>
are EXACTLY like the one&#39;s you read about here, all they needed was  <br/>
the time to get there. The way unschooled children &#39;act&#39; and learn is  <br/>
the way that children REALLY are, and it&#39;s school and it&#39;s mind- <br/>
numbing schedules and curriculums that change the way a child&#39;s mind  <br/>
works and dulls their view of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t put TV up on a pedestal like I did. Let your children be free  <br/>
to choose, and in time, their choices will amaze you. Watch TV with  <br/>
them, talk about what you&#39;re watching, ask them their opinions, but  <br/>
don&#39;t push. Don&#39;t turn it into a &#39;lesson&#39;. That will only make them  <br/>
want to watch it...alone.<br/>
<br/>
TV is not the Great Evil that some of the &quot;experts&quot; make it out to  <br/>
be. Some of our best discussions have come from watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
Let your children learn however and whenever they choose to.<br/>
