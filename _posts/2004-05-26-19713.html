<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168776249">My parenting isn&#39;t at all fear based.  It is also not<br/>
denial based.  I also don&#39;t believe in censoring my<br/>
sons natural curiousity about learning anything he<br/>
wants to learn. If he is old enough to ask the<br/>
question then he is old enough to have the answer even<br/>
if it is a difficult topic.  At a young age of five he<br/>
knows all about reporduction, same sex marriages, <br/>
death, etc...  I have supported him in learning all of<br/>
this at the level he indicates he wants to know.  Not<br/>
more, not less.<br/>
<br/>
 It seems that when i talk about protecting my son by<br/>
scanning the material he has access to, the assumption<br/>
on this list is that i want to control what he desires<br/>
to learn.  That isn&#39;t the case at all.  In fact I want<br/>
to make it safe for him to learn what he wants to<br/>
learn, and not be surprised or harmed by those things<br/>
that he was neither looking for or ready to witness. <br/>
Of course children aren&#39;t going to look for<br/>
pornography on the web, nor are they looking for<br/>
violence on tv or in the print media.  But these<br/>
things exist in what originally appears as the most<br/>
innocent of places.-  Have none of you received spam<br/>
with links to pornographic sites, an innocent subject<br/>
line with a surprise on the other end?  Have none of<br/>
you gone to what is termed a family movie and<br/>
witnessed more violence than your child was ready to<br/>
see?  Do none of you read the 1000 or more studies<br/>
showing the negative  effects on children of violence<br/>
in cartoons, let alone the many other programs out<br/>
there?  <br/>
<br/>
I know that these things have lasting impact.  I have<br/>
counseled for well over 20 years helping families deal<br/>
with behaviour problems, domestic violence, and simple<br/>
childhood nightmares.  This society is getting more<br/>
and more immune to violence.  Rape, assaults, etc...<br/>
are increasing. We are going to war without exploring<br/>
the possibility of other peaceful resolutions.  Do you<br/>
really think that there is no link with premature<br/>
expossure to these topics and this alarming fact? <br/>
Exposure to material that a child isn&#39;t emotionally<br/>
mature to handle can be overwhelming, and has the<br/>
possibility of stifling rather than assisting the<br/>
emotional/spiritual development of the child.  This<br/>
isn&#39;t just my opinion it is substantiated by not only<br/>
my work, but the many, many respected  leaders in the<br/>
alternative healing community, and those in the<br/>
psychological community as well.  I have included a<br/>
basic link about the negative effects of cartoons<br/>
alone. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need any of you to agree with me on this,<br/>
however, i do want to make the distinction that i am<br/>
not censoring my son, i am censoring the media that<br/>
tries to invade my son&#39;s natural curiosity and take<br/>
advantage of his desire to learn by exploiting his<br/>
innoscence.  From this he both needs and deserves my<br/>
protection.<br/>

<br/>
Is this really true?  My understanding was that all violent crimes had been on the decline for decades.  Do you have statistics to back this up?  Humans have been violent for as long as history exists.  People were stoned in the streets, beheaded, human sacrifices were made, none of these things happen in this culture on a daily basis.  Are you sure we are really more violent now than in the past?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Long before Rain wanted her own email address, I was getting those. So,<br/>
I&#39;d read email, and she&#39;d be around, and I&#39;d snort and comment about how<br/>
clever these porn spammers thought they were, and share some of the more<br/>
creative attempts with her (or anyone else who was around). By the time<br/>
she did get her own email address, all I did was mention that if she<br/>
didn&#39;t know the person she was getting email from it was probably spam,<br/>
especially if they didn&#39;t say her name. I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s just<br/>
deleted all the porn spam she&#39;s gotten, although once she commented that<br/>
the supposed &quot;hot 16 yr old&quot; had the same name as someone we knew, and<br/>
once she asked what a word meant.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, in an unschooling family the issue was not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Rain was 2 1/2 we went to see a movie about a dragon, I think Sean<br/>
Connery was the voice of the dragon... I can&#39;t remember the title, but<br/>
think 1995 movies and someone will. Anyway, I thought it was G or PG-ish,<br/>
and got there and realized that it was R-ish, with some fairly gruesome<br/>
violence... but Rain was really liking the story so she didn&#39;t want to<br/>
leave, so we sort of muddled through. There was a guy who I think got<br/>
stabbed through the eye and died, that was my clue that this was maybe<br/>
not a PG movie. That was upsetting... but after that she covered her eyes<br/>
during any scenes that looked potentially gory and I told her what was<br/>
going on and when it was over, and that worked out okay. <br/>
<br/>
If I had known I would have warned her ahead of time, and she could have<br/>
been closing her eyes for the first gory part, but we did work it out,<br/>
and the next time I researched more, and I&#39;m pretty sure she wasn&#39;t<br/>
traumatized for life... okay, she&#39;s saying she was but she&#39;s laughing and<br/>
admitting that she doesn;t even remember it ;-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, the studies I&#39;m aware of showed that a subset of the children<br/>
in these studies became more violent after seeing violent shows... which<br/>
makes you wonder what was going on with that subset. I&#39;ll bet none of<br/>
them were unschoolers. And in the studies, the kids weren&#39;t asked if they<br/>
wanted to see the shows, or if they wanted someone sitting with them to<br/>
tell them when the scary parts were coming so they could not watch. We<br/>
did that for years...<br/>

should be, the active participant, determining which media he wants in<br/>
his life and to what degree. If he isn&#39;t, you are censoring him.<br/>

<br/>
Our society is not getting more and more immune to violence.  We actually<br/>
live in a world that is safer than it has ever been throughout history.  You<br/>
might want to check your facts on that one.  Think Crusades, think 1700&#39;s<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110390063">so it sounds like your daughter was emotionally ready to handle <br/>
it.  If a child isn&#39;t, are you suggesting to still give access?  All i am <br/>
saying is if a child isn&#39;t ready for the unexpected content, they <br/>
should not be given it.  Of course there is some trial and error <br/>
here, but really?  If it is clear they are not ready, dont&#39; you <br/>
protect?-<br/>

&gt; &gt; My parenting isn&#39;t at all fear based.  It is also not<br/>
&gt; &gt; denial based.  I also don&#39;t believe in censoring my<br/>
&gt; &gt; sons natural curiousity about learning anything he<br/>
&gt; &gt; wants to learn. If he is old enough to ask the<br/>
&gt; &gt; question then he is old enough to have the answer even<br/>
&gt; &gt; if it is a difficult topic.  At a young age of five he<br/>
&gt; &gt; knows all about reporduction, same sex marriages,<br/>
&gt; &gt; death, etc...  I have supported him in learning all of<br/>
&gt; &gt; this at the level he indicates he wants to know.  Not<br/>
&gt; &gt; more, not less.<br/>

&gt; &gt;  It seems that when i talk about protecting my son by<br/>

&gt; &gt; Of course children aren&#39;t going to look for<br/>
&gt; &gt; pornography on the web, nor are they looking for<br/>
&gt; &gt; violence on tv or in the print media.  But these<br/>
&gt; &gt; things exist in what originally appears as the most<br/>
&gt; &gt; innocent of places.-  Have none of you received spam<br/>
&gt; &gt; with links to pornographic sites, an innocent subject<br/>
&gt; &gt; line with a surprise on the other end?  Have none of<br/>
&gt; &gt; you gone to what is termed a family movie and<br/>
&gt; &gt; witnessed more violence than your child was ready to<br/>
&gt; &gt; see?  Do none of you read the 1000 or more studies<br/>
&gt; &gt; showing the negative  effects on children of violence<br/>
&gt; &gt; in cartoons, let alone the many other programs out<br/>
&gt; &gt; there?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know that these things have lasting impact.  I have<br/>

&gt; &gt; expossure to these topics and this alarming fact?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Exposure to material that a child isn&#39;t emotionally<br/>
&gt; &gt; mature to handle can be overwhelming, and has the<br/>
&gt; &gt; possibility of stifling rather than assisting the<br/>
&gt; &gt; emotional/spiritual development of the child.  This<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t just my opinion it is substantiated by not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; my work, but the many, many respected  leaders in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; alternative healing community, and those in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; psychological community as well.  I have included a<br/>
&gt; &gt; basic link about the negative effects of cartoons<br/>
&gt; &gt; alone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mary, I think the point is that the children are able<br/>
to decide what they need, and what they can handle,<br/>
and THEY can make a point to steer away if they feel<br/>
they need to.  A child perhaps, if they were afraid of<br/>
a scary show, would say &quot;Mom, can we not watch that<br/>
movie at night, because it gives me nightmares&quot;....NOT<br/>
the parent saying &quot;You aren&#39;t allowed to watch this at<br/>
night because it might give you nightmares&quot;....The<br/>
child is equally protected in each instance, but only<br/>
one child is empowered with freedom to make choices...<br/>

&gt; &gt; Long before Rain wanted her own email address, I<br/>
&gt; was getting <br/>
&gt; those. So,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d read email, and she&#39;d be around, and I&#39;d snort<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; comment about how<br/>
&gt; &gt; clever these porn spammers thought they were, and<br/>
&gt; share <br/>
&gt; some of the more<br/>
&gt; &gt; creative attempts with her (or anyone else who was<br/>
&gt; around). <br/>
&gt; By the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; she did get her own email address, all I did was<br/>
&gt; mention that if <br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know the person she was getting email from<br/>
&gt; it was <br/>
&gt; probably spam,<br/>
&gt; &gt; especially if they didn&#39;t say her name. I&#39;m pretty<br/>
&gt; sure she&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; &gt; deleted all the porn spam she&#39;s gotten, although<br/>
&gt; once she <br/>
&gt; commented that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the supposed &quot;hot 16 yr old&quot; had the same name as<br/>
&gt; someone <br/>
&gt; we knew, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; once she asked what a word meant.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; In other words, in an unschooling family the issue<br/>
&gt; was not a <br/>
&gt; big deal.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have none of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you gone to what is termed a family movie and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; witnessed more violence than your child was<br/>
&gt; ready to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When Rain was 2 1/2 we went to see a movie about a<br/>
&gt; dragon, I <br/>
&gt; think Sean<br/>
&gt; &gt; Connery was the voice of the dragon... I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; remember the <br/>
&gt; title, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; think 1995 movies and someone will. Anyway, I<br/>
&gt; thought it was <br/>
&gt; G or PG-ish,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and got there and realized that it was R-ish, with<br/>
&gt; some fairly <br/>
&gt; gruesome<br/>
&gt; &gt; violence... but Rain was really liking the story<br/>
&gt; so she didn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; leave, so we sort of muddled through. There was a<br/>
&gt; guy who I <br/>
&gt; think got<br/>
&gt; &gt; stabbed through the eye and died, that was my clue<br/>
&gt; that this <br/>
&gt; was maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; not a PG movie. That was upsetting... but after<br/>
&gt; that she covered <br/>
&gt; her eyes<br/>
&gt; &gt; during any scenes that looked potentially gory and<br/>
&gt; I told her <br/>
&gt; what was<br/>
&gt; &gt; going on and when it was over, and that worked out<br/>
&gt; okay. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; If I had known I would have warned her ahead of<br/>
&gt; time, and she <br/>
&gt; could have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been closing her eyes for the first gory part, but<br/>
&gt; we did work it <br/>
&gt; out,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the next time I researched more, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; pretty sure she <br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; traumatized for life... okay, she&#39;s saying she was<br/>
&gt; but she&#39;s <br/>
&gt; laughing and<br/>
&gt; &gt; admitting that she doesn;t even remember it ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do none of you read the 1000 or more studies<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually, the studies I&#39;m aware of showed that a<br/>
&gt; subset of the <br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt; &gt; in these studies became more violent after seeing<br/>
&gt; violent <br/>
&gt; shows... which<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes you wonder what was going on with that<br/>
&gt; subset. I&#39;ll bet <br/>
&gt; none of<br/>
&gt; &gt; them were unschoolers. And in the studies, the<br/>
&gt; kids weren&#39;t <br/>
&gt; asked if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted to see the shows, or if they wanted someone<br/>
&gt; sitting <br/>
&gt; with them to<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell them when the scary parts were coming so they<br/>
&gt; could not <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a difference between protecting and controlling.  Zach, age 10, is<br/>
an anxious guy.  Has been since the day he was born.  He gets stuff in his<br/>
head and worries about it.  So if some show is coming on that I think might<br/>
cause problems for him, I mention it.  But I certainly don&#39;t stop him from<br/>
watching it.<br/>
<br/>
Zach watched Jurassic Park at a friend&#39;s house.  He loved the movie but it<br/>
freaked him out.  He was scared for me to leave the house at all for several<br/>
days.  We were in the library and he saw the movie and wanted to rent it.  I<br/>
reminded him of his reaction in the past but he wanted it, so he got it.  He<br/>
watched it probably 40 times in a weekend.  He wasn&#39;t scared anymore.  He<br/>
took control of a situation and handled it exactly opposite of how I would<br/>
have suggested he do it....and it turned out perfect.<br/>
<br/>
When the second LOTR came out on video, we bought it.  The older kids had<br/>
seen it and plugged it in right away.  All the kids were in the living room<br/>
watching the show and I was in the kitchen next door.  I look around and<br/>
there was Michelle, then 3yo.  She said she didn&#39;t like the movie, it was<br/>

<br/>
&gt; so it sounds like your daughter was emotionally ready to handle<br/>
&gt; it.  If a child isn&#39;t, are you suggesting to still give access?  All i am<br/>
&gt; saying is if a child isn&#39;t ready for the unexpected content, they<br/>
&gt; should not be given it.  Of course there is some trial and error<br/>
&gt; here, but really?  If it is clear they are not ready, dont&#39; you<br/>
&gt; protect?-<br/>

&gt; &gt; Long before Rain wanted her own email address, I was getting<br/>
&gt; those. So,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;d read email, and she&#39;d be around, and I&#39;d snort and<br/>
&gt; comment about how<br/>
&gt; &gt; clever these porn spammers thought they were, and share<br/>
&gt; some of the more<br/>
&gt; &gt; creative attempts with her (or anyone else who was around).<br/>
&gt; By the time<br/>
&gt; &gt; she did get her own email address, all I did was mention that if<br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn&#39;t know the person she was getting email from it was<br/>
&gt; probably spam,<br/>
&gt; &gt; especially if they didn&#39;t say her name. I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s just<br/>
&gt; &gt; deleted all the porn spam she&#39;s gotten, although once she<br/>
&gt; commented that<br/>
&gt; &gt; the supposed &quot;hot 16 yr old&quot; had the same name as someone<br/>
&gt; we knew, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; once she asked what a word meant.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; In other words, in an unschooling family the issue was not a<br/>
&gt; big deal.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Have none of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you gone to what is termed a family movie and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; witnessed more violence than your child was ready to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; When Rain was 2 1/2 we went to see a movie about a dragon, I<br/>
&gt; think Sean<br/>
&gt; &gt; Connery was the voice of the dragon... I can&#39;t remember the<br/>
&gt; title, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; think 1995 movies and someone will. Anyway, I thought it was<br/>
&gt; G or PG-ish,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and got there and realized that it was R-ish, with some fairly<br/>
&gt; gruesome<br/>
&gt; &gt; violence... but Rain was really liking the story so she didn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; leave, so we sort of muddled through. There was a guy who I<br/>
&gt; think got<br/>
&gt; &gt; stabbed through the eye and died, that was my clue that this<br/>
&gt; was maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; not a PG movie. That was upsetting... but after that she covered<br/>
&gt; her eyes<br/>
&gt; &gt; during any scenes that looked potentially gory and I told her<br/>
&gt; what was<br/>
&gt; &gt; going on and when it was over, and that worked out okay.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If I had known I would have warned her ahead of time, and she<br/>
&gt; could have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been closing her eyes for the first gory part, but we did work it<br/>
&gt; out,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and the next time I researched more, and I&#39;m pretty sure she<br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; traumatized for life... okay, she&#39;s saying she was but she&#39;s<br/>
&gt; laughing and<br/>
&gt; &gt; admitting that she doesn;t even remember it ;-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Do none of you read the 1000 or more studies<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; showing the negative  effects on children of violence<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in cartoons, let alone the many other programs out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Actually, the studies I&#39;m aware of showed that a subset of the<br/>
&gt; children<br/>
&gt; &gt; in these studies became more violent after seeing violent<br/>
&gt; shows... which<br/>
&gt; &gt; makes you wonder what was going on with that subset. I&#39;ll bet<br/>
&gt; none of<br/>
&gt; &gt; them were unschoolers. And in the studies, the kids weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; asked if they<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted to see the shows, or if they wanted someone sitting<br/>
&gt; with them to<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell them when the scary parts were coming so they could not<br/>
&gt; watch. We<br/>
&gt; &gt; did that for years...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I know that these things have lasting impact.  I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; counseled for well over 20 years helping families deal<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with behaviour problems, domestic violence, and simple<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; childhood nightmares.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My daughter never needed counseling, despite having access<br/>
&gt; to all of<br/>
&gt; &gt; these things.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This society is getting more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and more immune to violence.  Rape, assaults, etc...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are increasing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Violent crime is actually descreasing. Rape reports have<br/>
&gt; increased, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; most experts believe that it&#39;s the reporting that has increased,<br/>
&gt; not the<br/>
&gt; &gt; number of rapes itself.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;We are going to war without exploring<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the possibility of other peaceful resolutions.  Do you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; really think that there is no link with premature<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; expossure to these topics and this alarming fact?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Didn&#39;t we do the same thing 35 years ago?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i do want to make the distinction that i am<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; isn&#39;t just my opinion it is substantiated by not only<br/>

the dinosaurs seemed very real and that she might be scared.  She wanted <br/>
to anyway so we got the DVD which was great because before we all <br/>
watched the movie we watched how they made the movie.  After watching <br/>
that, we all watched the film and it was fine.  Since then we&#39;ve had <br/>
movie marathons with all three Jurassic Parks.  It was always a given <br/>
that if someone was upset they could leave or the movie could be turned off.<br/>
<br/>
One of my best friends has a dd who desperately wants to see this movie. <br/>
 Her mother has forbidden it since she says it will give her dd <br/>
nightmares.  So this movie has joined a large amount of others that this <br/>
girl cannot watch, including the Wizard of Oz which upset her dd at 3 <br/>
yrs.  Her dd is now 13.  In my opinion, my friend is doing a great deal <br/>
more harm withholding these movies than if she&#39;s sit with her dd and <br/>
watch them with her.  It&#39;s a darn good thing this woman has other <br/>
redeeming qualities, because these actions make me struggle sometimes to <br/>
hang onto this relationship and keep my mouth shut.<br/>

<br/>
I was also thinking about The Wizard of Oz.  Back in the Sixties (as the older among you will remember) this used to be on TV in the US once a year.  I remember being quite intimidated by the wicked witch and watching some parts of the movie from *behind the couch*, and I did that for a couple of years running.  Maybe even three years running.   (Hey, I still think the winged monkeys are pretty creepy. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
But I think this supports the idea that kids have some control over their experiences.  (I had a couch and I used it.  I didn&#39;t need the movie banned.)  <br/>
<br/>
However, taking kids to the movie theater and *making* them stay because the parent wanted to stay would likely cause more problems than having the same movie on in the living room.  A theater is typically darker and louder and kids aren rarely free to move around.<br/>
<br/>
FYI, I no longer hide behind the couch, but I don&#39;t like being scared, so I do sometimes slide pretty far down under a blanket. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS  I happen to have a kid who only has nightmares very rarely.  If he was expressing fears at night I might feel differently about hunting for the cause, even though a direct cause and effect relationship would be hard to prove.</div>

&lt;&lt; Have none of you received spam<br/>
with links to pornographic sites, an innocent subject<br/>
line with a surprise on the other end? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never gone to any of the sites.<br/>
<br/>
From the time my kids had e-mail, we showed them that there would be &quot;junk <br/>
mail&quot; and just to delete things that were obviously being sent to lots of <br/>
people.  We didn&#39;t treat it like anything that won&#39;d jump out and surprise them, and <br/>
neither did they, and so it never did.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Have none of you gone to what is termed a family movie and<br/>
witnessed more violence than your child was ready to see? -=-<br/>
<br/>
No, because I&#39;ve never taken my children to movies they didn&#39;t request or <br/>
that I hadn&#39;t checked out somewhat first.  Most of our viewing is at home, and <br/>
nobody is &quot;made&quot; to watch videos or DVDs.  Anyone can go in and out, pause, <br/>
mute...<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do none of you read the 1000 or more studies<br/>
showing the negative  effects on children of violence<br/>
in cartoons, let alone the many other programs out<br/>
there?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
1000 or more?  If there are that many, which I seriously doubt, I bet over <br/>
800 had to do with people getting higher degrees in education and having to do <br/>
some &quot;original research&quot; (or what can pass as research in education <br/>
departments).<br/>
<br/>
What matters when school looms large is not the same as what matters when <br/>
school isn&#39;t even on the horizon.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you<br/>
really think that there is no link with premature<br/>
expossure to these topics and this alarming fact? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you really think unschoolers are no different from the people you&#39;ve <br/>
counselled for 20 years?  The people on this list are not your domestic violence, <br/>
premature exposure candidates.  And attachment parents all grouped together <br/>
lole lives, all three combined, than I used to have in a year.   Two or three <br/>
each, ever, maybe.  They don&#39;t have to sleep where they don&#39;t want to sleep.  <br/>
They can get up and be with others any time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Exposure to material that a child isn&#39;t emotionally<br/>
mature to handle can be overwhelming, and has the<br/>
possibility of stifling rather than assisting the<br/>
emotional/spiritual development of the child. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t an issue with the unschoolers here, or at unschooling.com, or the <br/>
other lists I&#39;m on or have been on.<br/>
<br/>
-=- This<br/>
isn&#39;t just my opinion it is substantiated by not only<br/>
my work, but the many, many respected  leaders in the<br/>
alternative healing community, and those in the<br/>
psychological community as well. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Really?  Did you or respected leaders expose children to things they weren&#39;t <br/>
emotionally prepared to handle?  Or did you just see effects and peg a cause <br/>
after the fact?<br/>
<br/>
If you have a boogie man in mind, you can blame him for lots of things.  If <br/>
you don&#39;t have a control group and an exposed group (if you didn&#39;t take <br/>
innocent children and show them horrible things to measure before and after) it <br/>
wasn&#39;t too damned scientific, was it?  So go easy with that &quot;substantiated&quot; word <br/>
when you mean &quot;theorized.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- i am<br/>
not censoring my son, i am censoring the media -=-<br/>
<br/>
Censoring has a specific meaning; you&#39;re censoring nothing, except in the <br/>
controlling-input sense.  Your son&#39;s thoughts aren&#39;t yours to control, and you&#39;re <br/>
not &quot;censoring the media.&quot;   You&#39;re limiting your son&#39;s access.<br/>

This morning I was reading at an anti-spanking site, and there was a summary <br/>
of the laws that have been changed over the past few hundred years.  Pillories <br/>
(where others could come by and take a whack at a convicted criminal were <br/>
outlawed long ago.   Wifebeating was legal not so long ago.  Rape within marriage <br/>
wasn&#39;t even a concept until fairly recently.  Corporal punishment in schools <br/>
used to be VERY common.  Spanking is outlawed in MANY countries, and more <br/>
every year.<br/>

&lt;&lt; expertness on others being why she thinks psychology isn&#39;t so<br/>
<br/>
great &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think lots of what has been discovered/proposed/theorized about cognition <br/>
and human development have made kids&#39; lives better, though (except when they <br/>
live with people who think that&#39;s all a bunch of bullhockey and that if kids <br/>
don&#39;t cooperate they&#39;re just being obstinant, manipulative or disobedient).<br/>
<br/>
Holly was telling me about a friend of hers who put her rats down for a nap.  <br/>
She was visiting with her pets rats, and all the rats had been playing <br/>
together, but the visitor declared it time for her rats&#39; nap and held her hand over <br/>
their bed/box and didn&#39;t let them out for a while, until they&#39;d been quiet a <br/>
while.  I had known that; I&#39;d been in there for part of it.<br/>
<br/>
What I heard tonight was that for some offense inside her rats&#39; travelling <br/>
cage, she had waggled her finger in the face of one of Holly&#39;s rats and said &quot;We <br/>
don&#39;t do that here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly reported it with blinky big eyes, amazed that someone could really <br/>
think it was the least bit sensible.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe psychology and behavioral science isn&#39;t so bad when it suggests that <br/>
rats don&#39;t understand English, that &quot;we don&#39;t do that here&quot; isn&#39;t the thing <br/>
to say to a creature in its own home ANYway and ...  gosh, I don&#39;t know what <br/>
more can be said.  But as play therapy goes, wasn&#39;t that a heck of a display of <br/>
&quot;how it ought to be&quot;?    Long-awaited visits can be interrupted for a nap, and <br/>
finger-wagging will get the serious attention of men and mice (or girls and <br/>
rats) [NOT].<br/>

the fact that they feel safe when they go to sleep.  They aren&#39;t forced to<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; it would have ben in a big, dark theatre. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I saw &quot;The Exorcist&quot; at the drive-in.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I saw it in an old velvet-seat theater the first weekend, when people didn&#39;t <br/>
know what was going to happen.  Big theater, balcony, full.  The Highland, on <br/>
Central (Rt.66) in Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in theaters when the mood of the crowd was light, but that night it <br/>
was not.  People were disturbed, and afraid.  When the movie was over, people <br/>
weren&#39;t chattery.  They were stunned, and spooked.   <br/>
<br/>
Most of the parking at that theater is around the back, and the side streets <br/>
are dark.  (One side has a Wendy&#39;s now, all lit up, but in those days, nothing <br/>
open, nothing light.)<br/>
<br/>
People seemed afraid of the dark, afraid of the big dark wall of the theater, <br/>
afraid of each other, afraid to say anything, afraid of their cars.  <br/>
Everyone&#39;s auras just sucked into them and they were trying to be invisible, to be <br/>
magically elsewhere.  Nobody was laughing about it.<br/>
<br/>
I was 19 or 20, and with three friends in my VW bug.  We were to let one out <br/>
at his small apartment (behind a garage, not in an apartment building) and the <br/>
other three of us would&#39;ve gone back to dorms.<br/>
<br/>
We walked him in, and were afraid to leave and he didn&#39;t want us to leave.  <br/>
We slept two on the bed and two on the floor right  next.  Took a long time to <br/>
go to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
We weren&#39;t feigning fear, we were bone-chilled scared.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
I always categorized that as a scary, disturbing movie.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago, one of Marty&#39;s friends brought it over and a dozen or <br/>
so people watched it at once.  Holly wanted to, so I stayed.   Kirby didn&#39;t <br/>
want to, so he went and played video games elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing was scary.  The kids were laughing, pointing out the old-fashioned <br/>
special effects, discussing the datedness of costumes and such.  It didn&#39;t scare <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I watched Psycho recently.  Holly thought it was hilarious.  It di<br/>
dn&#39;t scare her.<br/>
<br/>
Part of the scary experience of a movie has got to be the mood of people <br/>
around.   And is it dark and are kids alone?  Bad time for a scary movie.  Remote <br/>
control in hand so it can be paused or muted or run back?  No comparison to <br/>
being stuck between and among frightened adults in a dark theater.<br/>
<br/>
Apples and oranges, I think.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted Marty and Holly to see The Birds because there are references to it <br/>
in so many parody and cartoon things they know.  We watched it in daylight, <br/>
discussing how they did things.  It was on DVD and there were discussions of <br/>
special effects.  <br/>
<br/>
I think when somene who was scarred and scared by seeing Jaws in a theater <br/>
too young might think they need to protect their child from the same movie, but <br/>
at home with a remote is just too different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1833973563">This may be a weird question. Would you feel any different if your<br/>
children were boys? I have always done something similar with Nick. In<br/>
our case, Nick and I start out in my bed, reading for about an hour<br/>
and then falling asleep. When Rob (ds) comes to bed (he&#39;s a nite owl<br/>
and we&#39;re not!) he lugs Nick to his own (loft) bed in his own room and<br/>
then comes to bed. Nick is fine with this.<br/>
<br/>
But now that Nick&#39;s getting older (he just turned 11) this arrangement<br/>
is beginning to feel like something I don&#39;t want to admit to anyone<br/>
outside the family! (It reminds me of the days when Nick was still<br/>
nursing occasionally as a pre-schooler: not something I felt I could<br/>
comfortably do in public!)<br/>

I think part of the issue for us is that Nick is an only child and has<br/>
no siblings to keep him company if he were to try to fall asleep in<br/>

It&#39;s hard to speculate about something like that but it doesn&#39;t seem like it<br/>
would feel differently to me if my girls were boys.  I don&#39;t really talk<br/>
about our sleeping arrangements with people (except a couple of close<br/>

come up.  <br/>

My oldest is only 9 and she has rarely gone to sleep without me in the same<br/>
room.  I think that this helps the girls to feel secure.  My mother never<br/>
slept alone.  As a child she shared a bed with a sister.  As a teen she<br/>
shared a bed with her grandmother, whom she lived with to help care for her.<br/>
Then she married my father and slept with him. <br/>

My 10 yo boy still sleeps with me most of the time.  He&#39;d rather not, <br/>
sometimes, but he is the last kid in the house, ane he gets lonely, too.  He is very <br/>
gradually growing out of it, I think.  <br/>
<br/>
I know other families where the 15 and 11 yo boys still bunk in on the floor <br/>
or the bed with the rest of the family.  My own boy cousins when I was growing <br/>
up would still come into my aunt&#39;s room in the middle of the night and crash <br/>
on the floor even up to the time they moved out!  <br/>
<br/>
I think everyone having their own bed and having to stay there is highly <br/>
overrated in this country.  No one has to know that your boy sleeps with you.  <br/>
It&#39;s natural and has a natural evolution to the end, and the end will be <br/>
different for everyone.<br/>

or damaged or will never have &quot;proper&quot; sleeping habits; I have to bite my<br/>
tongue.  Your comment,<br/>

<br/>
struck a chord with me as I am about to exit a MOMs group that I found great<br/>
comfort in four years ago.  Our lifestyles are completely divergent,<br/>
parenting, schooling and just the fact that we respect our children as<br/>
people/individuals with minds of their own (I couldn&#39;t think of the right<br/>
word here.)  It&#39;s funny I really didn&#39;t notice this so much when my older<br/>
boys were younger, but as of late, I feel I can&#39;t share anything with these<br/>
women without being put under the microscope.  It astonishes me that I<br/>
didn&#39;t notice the differences before.  It really only became evident to me<br/>
as my boys grew to an age where everyone else&#39;s children were starting<br/>
school.  Then the separation became quite apparent as have the differences<br/>
in our children.  I rarely tell people much about our personal lives, maybe<br/>
mentioning that we home school, definitely NOT referencing unschooling<br/>
because of the uncomfortable atmosphere it generates.  Not on our part, but<br/>
theirs.<br/>

It&#39;s not about a family bed, but it really opened my eyes and helped me to let go of a lot of ideas and notions I had kicking about in my head, and helped me to relax, and enjoy the fact that my boys like to cuddle with us, and that they feel safe and secure being in our bed with us.<br/>
