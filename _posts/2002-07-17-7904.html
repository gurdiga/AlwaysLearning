<br/>
I think you make a good point Joyce - why do we put up these hurdles for<br/>
ourselves.  I know I am doing that at the moment - I want to establish a<br/>
homeschool learning/resource center for teens and I know I am putting up<br/>
stumbling blocks.  I don&#39;t have the money is the main one.  I know there are<br/>
many people who would find a way to do this, to find the money and it<br/>
disappoints me that I am finding it difficult to jump the hurdle.  Anyone<br/>
have good tactics for breaking down these barriers and moving from planning<br/>
to doing.<br/>

I miss it.  Would you like to share ideas?<br/>

Tamzin&#39;s birthday was on Wednesday (she&#39;s now 8!) and we had <br/>
an Hawaiian luau in the park.  It was a blast.  The only thing that <br/>
marred the day (for me) was the fact that my lower back muscles <br/>
totally seized up on Monday morning and I couldn&#39;t sit down (I <br/>
still only have two positions for any length of time - upright or <br/>
lying down &lt;g&gt;) so I had to spend the duration of the party <br/>
upright.  I still had a great time though.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m off to lie down and stretch again - sigh.<br/>

moving out of some of my tranquility to be a bit more fiery.  <br/>
