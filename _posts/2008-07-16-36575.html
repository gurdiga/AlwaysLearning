<div id="ygrps-yiv-111100779">Hi, I would like to hear some ideas on a situation.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 4.5, and its summer, we go to the park almost every  <br/>
day. Here in Chicago, ice cream vendors sell ice cream from  <br/>
refrigerated boxes they push around on bikes, they hang out in the  <br/>
parks of course, where the kids are. They are 1.50-2$ each. My  <br/>
daughter always wants one, but she doesnt actually eat them. She  <br/>
licks it a few times then hands it back to me, saying its too cold,  <br/>
its drippy, it doesnt taste good. I think they taste gross, so its  <br/>
not even like I can eat it, it just has to be thrown away. A lot of  <br/>
the other kids in our group get them, too, although some parents dont  <br/>
allow them as a rule.<br/>
<br/>
I hate paying for them not to get eaten. 2$ a day turns into 8$ a  <br/>
week (if we go to the park 4 times), etc.<br/>
I dont mind if she eats ice cream, I would not mind paying 8$ a week  <br/>
if she was eating them. I get ice coffee most days, which is 2$ or  <br/>
so, and I see it as similar. But, to just toss it?<br/>
<br/>
So, when we are at the park, and I say that I am not buying it today,  <br/>
I tell her we have ice cream at home for later,( true), and I bring  <br/>
and have other snacks, etc, but she cant get her mind off it, and of  <br/>
course, the guy rings his bell every so often and plenty of other  <br/>
kids are eating it, etc....<br/>
<br/>
So, am I being unreasonable to not buy them anymore?  I have been  <br/>
buying them...but its beginning to irk me, the waste. Its not even  <br/>
like she eats half or most. Its a little bit, and not really  <br/>
something else (like a friend) would want after she has licked it and  <br/>
let it get all melty.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

before you leave home? Or getting her some on the way (something that<br/>
perhaps comes in a cup like a McFlurry)? What about a portable car<br/>
freezer (I googled it, they exist). You could buy some ice cream<br/>
whatevers at the store and stick one in there for the trip.<br/>

Can you try problem solving with her before you go to the park? <br/>
<br/>
The way we would this is to:<br/>
1. talk about it before going to the park, when she is calm and rational<br/>
2. identify your concerns - spending the money and not eating the ice cream,           let her identify her concerns (and you may be surprised here)  -- either one can go first or you can take turns as you think of concerns. <br/>
3. have both of you (or everyone who is around) brainstorm possible solutions  - bringing treats, buying it once a week, buying it to share, getting it on the way home so you can freeze it, only buying ones that you also like, not buying it at all, going to a different park, taking over the ice cream truck franchise... and see what she comes up with.<br/>
4. agree on a solution to try and then try that solution<br/>
5. if it works then you have a solution<br/>
6. if that doesn&#39;t work, go through the process again or use your second choice solution. We will often have plan A, plan B, plan C etc and then go from there. <br/>
<br/>
We also use it for uncertain situations like: getting a ride from so and so is plan A, and my being done coming to get him is plan B, and taking the bus is plan C.<br/>
We got this from Ross Greene&#39;s Collaborative Problem Solving and use it all the time. <br/>
We sometimes have to write it down so that my youngest will remember in the heat of the moment (he has neurological regulation issues) or my middle son will remember the order (he has processing issues) or I will remember that it was an issue. You can draw pictures to remind a child who can&#39;t read. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you try it and it helps.<br/>

What if you took a plastic container and a spoon, and she put it in  <br/>
there.  You could snap the lid on.  She might like it better after  <br/>
it&#39;s melty.  You could take it home for the dog or the cat if she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t finish it, maybe?  I&#39;d take a ziploc bag to keep it in.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I smell popcorn and I haven&#39;t had any for a while, I want some.   <br/>
So I started &quot;popcorn innoculation&quot; for me.  When I&#39;m going to go to  <br/>
a movie, I make microwave popcorn and eat it before we leave or on  <br/>
the way.  Then when I get there the popcorn doesn&#39;t smell so good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe eating ice cream before you go would work.<br/>

very fast as he doesnt like the coldness (lol-!) so whenever we bought<br/>
a cone for him, we would ask for a cup and spoon as well.  This way he<br/>
could let it melt, eat the cone dipped in the melted icecream and<br/>
slurp away as slowly as he pleased.  <br/>
<br/>
He still prefers melted icecream to frozen....it could be that it is<br/>
just too cold for her to eat quickly, but she doesnt like the<br/>
messyness of it when she doesnt.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m curious if she varies her choices?  In the past my kids have always<br/>
like the $.50 ones the best.  Usually all the trucks, at least around<br/>
here have mostly the $1.50-$3 options with at least one $.50 variety. <br/>
It&#39;s generally the plain popcycle, no icecream.  I guess my pocket book<br/>
was lucky with my kids!<br/>
<br/>
We used to keep a coin collection by the front door of our house for the<br/>
ice cream truck that would go by, since we live a block from the park. <br/>
I&#39;d always take change with me to the park.  I did that enough times and<br/>
the kids don&#39;t really ask anymore, they aren&#39;t really interested, and<br/>
one is still 6, so still at the age of wanting goodies from melodic<br/>
trucks, if she was interested.  I don&#39;t rule out the possibility<br/>
entirely.<br/>
<br/>
I also made a point of filling our freezer with goodies that the kids<br/>
really really liked.  I still do that.  I have vocally compared prices<br/>
at the store with what you can get for the same price as the ice cream<br/>
vendor, but soooo much more.<br/>
<br/>
Also, someone else suggested putting the leftover in a container to take<br/>
home.  We have a cute little book called Ice Cream Star Soup where the<br/>
girl in the story did exactly that to share with her stuffed animal<br/>
friend and then helped her friend finish her portion of soup.  It&#39;s<br/>
cute, written by the same person who wrote Lilly&#39;s Purple Plastic Purse,<br/>
can&#39;t remember the name of the author at the moment and I don&#39;t want to<br/>
go searching for the book just right now.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that I do, is to let go of any attatchment to wether my<br/>
kids finish anything that I buy them to eat.  I can pretend that they<br/>
ate every last bite and that they got the same value out of it as if<br/>
they only ate one.  Sometimes the value is in the having the item, the<br/>
fun of buying it, not wether or not one actually consumes it.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly your daughter sees buying icecream as part of the park<br/>
experience of summer.</div>

it&#39;s gone too.  If she ate the whole ice cream it would be gone. I <br/>
doubt you&#39;d feel estatic if she ate it all.  You probably wouldn&#39;t <br/>
feel much of anything.  So the distance between her eating it all and <br/>
you feeling not much and her NOT eating it all and you feeling irked <br/>
is a pretty short distance indeed. Instead of thinking that you&#39;ve <br/>
paid for the ice cream you could think that you paid for her to have <br/>
the fun of standing with other kids in line.  You&#39;ve paid for her to <br/>
have the fun of looking at the pictures and choosing her treat.  <br/>
You&#39;ve paid for a summer tradition;-)<br/>

help her see some of the other things she could spend it on?  It <br/>

age, they really didn&#39;t get saving and spending concepts yet.  My <br/>
youngest wanted ice cream every time the truck came around until he <br/>
was eight.  Then he finally understood what I&#39;d been saying about how <br/>
we could buy it so much cheaper at Safeway and he stopped wanting <br/>
it.  But that wouldn&#39;t have happened when he was 4.<br/>

The ice cream truck is pretty exciting.<br/>

for the extra entertainment and excitement of buying something off the  <br/>
ice cream truck.<br/>
<br/>
When we were in Manhattan a few weeks ago - we bought stuff from  <br/>
street vendors. Hot dogs, pretzels, kabob, nuts - it was all so much  <br/>
fun. Some of them weren&#39;t good though. I&#39;d forgotten that I like meat  <br/>
ONLY when very very well done - decided to dump the entire kabob into  <br/>
the nearest trash can. Still, I paid for the experience as much as for  <br/>
the food.<br/>
