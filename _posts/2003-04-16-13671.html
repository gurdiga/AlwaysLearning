<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Brenda,  what do you do onstage?  Acting?  Music?  HeidiC.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>These days, I&#39;m more of a stage mommy; hopefully you will read that the good<br/>
way and not the bad way.  I am not the pushy stage mommy type.  Ugh.  My son<br/>
likes acting than I ever did.  Since I have no other children to worry<br/>
about, I tend to end up in charge of the child actors backstage.<br/>
<br/>
I did a fair bit of acting back in middle and high school, though at the<br/>
community theatre rather than school theatre. Last Christmas Tim and I were<br/>
both in the Christmas show here.  I sing on pitch and read music, which got<br/>
me turned into the music director at some point.  I&#39;m still not sure how<br/>
that happened!  So I sang in a couple of the group numbers to &quot;direct&quot;.<br/>
(Glorified metronome.)  I also played a jazz cello Christmas piece, so I was<br/>
onstage for that.  That was pretty neat; I got written up in the German<br/>
paper for it.  My first review, and I couldn&#39;t even read it.  Had to get a<br/>
friend to read it to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-590979547">That&#39;s cool, Brenda.  I was in drama club in high school and loved it. <br/>
 I wish we lived in a higher populated area so we had more access to <br/>
things like that for the girls.  How old is your son and how old was he <br/>
when he started acting? Lately, the girls do shows for dh and I.  Maybe <br/>
I could just invite the grandparents and aunts and uncles over for a <br/>
bigger audience.  HeidiC.<br/>
