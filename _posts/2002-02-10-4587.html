&lt;&lt; I really thought we were true unschoolers..but after<br/>
the lastest discussions concerning tv and food. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The TV and food stuff are way off the philosophical end, I think.  It&#39;s not <br/>
the make-or-break of unschooling at all.  It just seems to be at that <br/>
juncture of &quot;why&quot; and &quot;how&quot; that helps people make the jump to unschooling.  <br/>
If a family sees that people will sleep and eat voluntarily if they&#39;re not <br/>
forced, it&#39;s easier for them to see that people will read and write <br/>
voluntarily.  <br/>
<br/>
So very often these discussions are sparked by someone&#39;s comment that has to <br/>
do with control and management and schedules (or an offhand insult about TV <br/>
watchers as a class of creatures &lt;g).<br/>
<br/>
I see the TV issue as a blind spot for some parents, a last bulwark of <br/>
prejudice about what is and isn&#39;t &#39;educational.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The food thing is related philosophically, and while it can be justified in <br/>
educational terms, and some families CAN &quot;make bad learning&quot; through food co<br/>
ntrol, it&#39;s also something that can be separated from unschooling.<br/>
