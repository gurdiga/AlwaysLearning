<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979431396">&quot;Some women need chocolate.  Some use wine.  <br/>
<br/>
I use Henry V, Guarding Tess, El Cid, sometimes Brother Sun Sister Moon.   <br/>
Not just any scenes, though I&#39;ll watch the whole thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mine is Pirates of the Caribbean lately.<br/>
It&#39;s the Johnny Depp factor....he makes a rogue, dirty pirate seem so immensely delicious. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm<br/>

looking at his other movies.  I saw Pirates 12 times<br/>

It is funny to share with my 14yo this little<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Speaking of kids seeing sex scenes in movies...  &quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; was<br/>
playing on our cable movie channel; I became intrigued when I turned it on<br/>
partway through and saw Johnny Depp looking like Zorro talking to a<br/>
psychiatrist, played by Marlon Brando, so I watched through to the end.<br/>
Another day, I caught it just starting, so 16 y.o. Laura sat down and<br/>
watched, too.. yikes!  There is the most, er, inspiring, seduction scene at<br/>
the beginning...  I think both of us were blushing, especially since dh was<br/>
in the room, albeit on the computer with headphones playing some CD.<br/>
<br/>
That was one hot scene, though it wasn&#39;t especially naked.  Yowza.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and for your Johnny Depp viewing essentials, you have to see &quot;Ed Wood.&quot;<br/>
He&#39;s only hot in that if you like transvestites, but it&#39;s a great<br/>
performance.  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve seen Chocolat and What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Holly watched the latter with me recently, and we had some really <br/>
good discussions.   Leonardo diCaprio plays his retarded brother and he is <br/>
awesome in that part.  The guy who sings &quot;Cellophone&quot; ( I don&#39;t know his name &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
is in it, and Holly is a big fan of the recent Chicago movie.   The one who <br/>
played the dad in Back to the Future and the hair-fetish bad guy in Charlies <br/>
Angels is in it.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has seen Edward Scissorhands but I haven&#39;t.  Should, I guess.<br/>

Yes, and then you can watch &quot;Unfaithful&quot; and wonder why that woman didn&#39;t <br/>
learn from her experiences. &lt;bwg&gt;  (same actress)<br/>
<br/>
This Olivier Martinez who&#39;s in Unfaithful is pretty easy to watch too.<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t watch that with kids in the room, generally speaking.  Sex scenes <br/>
are central and a little harsh.<br/>
