The key word is really &quot;trust.&quot;  I had to hire a professional parenting teacher to tell me that, but I think I get it now.  He told me, &quot;you have to trust them completely; if they sense that they&#39;ve lost your trust they&#39;ll have nothing else to lose.&quot;<br/>

About that goofy name list, my 10yo, who couldn&#39;t care less about writing, finally found something worth writing about!!  She asked me to spell everyone&#39;s name she can think of and she gave them new names!  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1923596981">Hey,<br/>
It must be conference time... My 14 year old wanted a curriculum <br/>
this year.. We ordered and she is happier than I have seen her in a <br/>
while. The other five and I do our thing, whatever that is and she <br/>
sat and did her thing at the computer....It seems to me that her <br/>
pleasure is coming from the fact that I did trust her and allowed <br/>
her to decide. She had MTV going in her ears and came and hugged me <br/>
several times. She wanted to know if she had to get certain things <br/>
done.... Whatever you think you need to get done, was my reply.<br/>
Just wanted to share.. <br/>
Thanks for the help <br/>
