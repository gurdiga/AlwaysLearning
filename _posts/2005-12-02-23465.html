<div id="ygrps-yiv-2033195606">A friend of mine came across this in Home Education Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
www.LowryHousePublishers.com sells a T-shirt with this printed on it. <br/>
Great definition!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;unschooler, n : one who learns from life and love and great books and <br/>
late morning conversations and big projects and eccentric uncles and <br/>
eyes-wide-open and mountains and mistakes and volunteering and starry <br/>
nights--instead of from classrooms and exceedingly dull textbooks and <br/>
sedative lectures and interfering homework.<br/>
<br/>
Synonyms:<br/>
<br/>
homeschooler, self-schooler, autodidact, rise-out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am going to order a couple of t-shirts for my boys.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna</div>

Before you do that, check out an unschoolers home business, with LOTS <br/>
of unschooling T&#39;s to choose from. She&#39;ll even customize them for you:<br/>
