Oh, never mind Shyrley....I missed that one!!!<br/>
But they don&#39;t have any taxes really....just property and they give you  <br/>
$1,000 per year (roughly) per person as a resident.<br/>
Houses are really, really expensive.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s see....here in Pensacola we can give you most of your list, but nix the <br/>
snow in winter. You could always drive a day to get to snow, TN would be a <br/>
good location for getting away from the sunshine and beaches!!!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I thought the SW<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s true in some parts.<br/>
<br/>
Because of drought, Albuquerque looks about to be needing to start using <br/>
treated river water for city water instead of ground or reservoir.  People <br/>
downstream are not going to like that, because the Rio Grande is argued over <br/>
all the time.  Most of what we use will go back in, but some will evaporate <br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
It rained hard yesterday for an hour or more.   Two hours later, there were <br/>
some wet places on the ground (not puddles, and not mud, but wet).  Other <br/>
parts of the yard, where there was no roof runoff or collection, we could <br/>
still kick the ground and it was dry.  Not as dry as if nothing had happened, <br/>
but still dusty dry.<br/>
<br/>
Ground that was set up for plants did collect water for them, and that was <br/>
great.  <br/>
<br/>
Some people can&#39;t handle coming to such a dry place.  There are whole new <br/>
tricks to learn.  Don&#39;t make sandwiches in advance unless you&#39;re coving them <br/>
immediately.  Putting bread in a bag might not keep it moist if you don&#39;t <br/>
take most of the air out of the bag too.<br/>
<br/>
But ticks are rare where I am and where I&#39;ve lived.  If you have a barn full <br/>
of hay or live in wet woods (also rare) you might get them.  I pulled dozens <br/>
of ticks out of cats&#39; ears when we got barn-kittens a couple of years ago.  <br/>
We might find one on the dog once in a while if we&#39;ve been to the mountains <br/>
for a few days.<br/>
<br/>
No earthquakes or volcanos expected.  No hurricanes. &lt;g&gt;  No tornados except <br/>
in SE New Mexico, pretty much (Carlsbad, Roswell, Hobbs), and they&#39;re rare <br/>
there.  <br/>

The more you write Shyrley, the more I see the Alaskan in you!!! Sheesh, are <br/>
you crazy? LOL<br/>
It&#39;s very dry in the interior (Fairbanks area) in the summer...I mean DRY. <br/>
Winters are very cold, very dry and very long.<br/>
In the summer you have light all night and enough of it to grow really <br/>
humongous things in your garden.<br/>
Let&#39;s see.....<br/>
There is at least one unschooler at unschooling.com (she&#39;s in Wasilla though, <br/>
where it rains a lot) and my sis who is a relaxed homeschooler is moving <br/>
there in June.<br/>
A lot of hippy/eclectic types are drawn to Alaska, I love it for that.<br/>
Outdoor adventure types love it there too.  <br/>
The winters down by Wasilla and Anchorage are milder (cold wise. 40 below <br/>
would be rare) and less snow. Rainier too. But absolutely breathtaking <br/>
mountains surround you.<br/>
Um, lots of military goings on.<br/>
Elmendorf AFB, Eilson AFB and Ft. Wainright are the ones I know of...but <br/>
there are others.<br/>
There is public transportation in Fairbanks and Anchorage for sure, not too <br/>
sure about Wasilla.<br/>
Cheap housing? Not a chance.<br/>
But again, no taxes hardly and they give you that permanent fund money every <br/>
year.<br/>
The wages are also really much better up there.<br/>
I think you have some Alaska blood mixed in with that English!! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We are having a bad drought in AZ right now.<br/>
There was barely any rain this winter/spring season.<br/>
The ski resort in Flagstaff, AZ was only open for 3 days this year - not<br/>
enough snow!<br/>
I don&#39;t think our overall water supply is in danger, but they&#39;re starting a<br/>
rationing system now for watering your yard (odd and even days.) But, I<br/>
think with a good rainy season, like we do get sometimes, we&#39;ll be in better<br/>
shape.<br/>
AZ is getting quite populated, too.<br/>
Last census showed the population at 5.1 million and 3 million just in the<br/>
Phoenix and surrounding area.<br/>
That&#39;s compared to 1.8 million in all of New Mexico.<br/>
There&#39;s always construction going on, freeway&#39;s being built, and even light<br/>
rail in the future.<br/>
The weather is beautiful for a large part of the year, but the summers are<br/>
very intense.<br/>
I do appreciate the monsoon/rainy season in the summer, though.<br/>
The humidity level is usually very dry, but does go up slightly in the<br/>
summer. It&#39;s not bad, though, compared to other really humid places.<br/>
Northern Arizona, like Flagstaff, is a nice escape in the summer with high&#39;s<br/>
usually in the 80&#39;s.<br/>
Here in Phoenix, bugs are rare, at least for us.<br/>
No ticks, no mosquitos (unless you live near a water source), no biting<br/>
flies, etc.<br/>
We do have the occasional scorpion, though, and some spiders.<br/>
We also don&#39;t get earthquakes, hurricanes, or tornadoes. The weather is<br/>
almost always agreeable - except for those darn summers! I&#39;m bracing<br/>
myself - it&#39;s just around the corner. Well actually, we&#39;ve already got temps<br/>
in the 100&#39;s. I guess it&#39;s here!<br/>

ticks here! When we first moved here I had to have the kids strip down every<br/>
time they came in the house so I could search them for ticks. Ticks were<br/>
even found crawling on the inside walls of our house occasionally. The only<br/>
thing that would get rid of them was diazanon. YUCK!<br/>

<br/>
Never humid.  Hot, but 90/100, not 106/112 like Phoenix.<br/>
<br/>
The top secret work sites are LANL (Los Alamos), Sandia (Albuquerque--not <br/>
quite northern New Mexico in the geographical sense) or in C Spgs, NORAD and <br/>
related jazz.<br/>
<br/>
If there are others, they&#39;re secret from me.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My mom lives in Barstow, CA and it&#39;s so dry there that elastic only lasts<br/>
about a year (makes keeping your socks and knickers up tricky:) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one reason I don&#39;t really like drying some kinds of laundry outside.  <br/>
Bras I hang INside for sure.  Using the dryer even is summer is better for <br/>
thins you don&#39;t want to get too stiff or wrinkly, because it dries with some <br/>
humidity maintained.  If you take it out SLIGHTly damp, and hang it up or lay <br/>
it out, it will dry in minutes and not be wrinkly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Also some<br/>
of her antique wood furniture she brought out of England has cracked<br/>
because of the dryness. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Cracks in furniture and musical instruments aren&#39;t natural and inevitable!?<br/>

me) that a daddy longlegs (though not a spider - thanks, Bill Nye) is the<br/>
most venomous creature you&#39;ll meet, but it&#39;s mouth is incapable of biting a<br/>
person, and the quantity of venom is very small; it&#39;s only a danger to bugs.<br/>
It&#39;s rather ethnocentric to think only in terms of what is poisonous to<br/>
humans &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
