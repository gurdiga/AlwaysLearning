<div id="ygrps-yiv-125706116">We came across unschooling just before my 4 year old was born.  We had<br/>
already decided that I would stay home and had been talking about<br/>
homeschooling my oldest (then 10 years old).  One of my friends mentioned<br/>
that she unschooled so we talked about it and I did &#39;the research&#39; and<br/>
decided that unschooling was the path for us.  I was relieved that I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have to nag him about homework anymore, that there would be no more<br/>
trips to the principal&#39;s office, and especially the promise of a better<br/>
relationship with my son because it would be based on mutual respect and<br/>
exploration.<br/>
I pulled him out of school after 5th grade.  We started with the typical<br/>
deschooling while I kept wrapping my head around all that unschooling meant,<br/>
especially radical unschooling.  We attended the Rethinking Education<br/>
conference that September and David Albert and many others were a huge help<br/>
with making our transition into the more radical unschooling.  We went the<br/>
next year as well and he went to the Not Back To School Camp last year.<br/>
We will have been unschooling 4 years the end of this month.  Most of the<br/>
time he is in his room to play video games, computer stuff, read, play<br/>
guitar, write various short stories, sleeping most of the day, awake most of<br/>
the night.  When he is not doing that he is rehearsing for whatever<br/>
production he is in (acting, musicals, improv), playing laser tag, or<br/>
skateboarding.  Most of which one would think I am complaining about or<br/>
seeking ways of how to change.  No, it&#39;s not.  He is a brilliant person and<br/>
the way he chooses to spend his time doesn&#39;t bother me.  <br/>
What bothers me is that despite us doing everything we can to support him in<br/>
what he wants to do, despite us inviting him to help plan and/or participate<br/>
in family activities, despite us respecting his choices.there have not been<br/>
very many moments of *mutual* respect.  There have been countless moments of<br/>
my oldest son tormenting his younger brother - &quot;because he&#39;s f****ing<br/>
annoying.&quot;  There have been countless times of him yelling at us and even<br/>
punching holes in the walls because we are &quot;doing __________ to piss him<br/>
off.&quot;  <br/>
He essentially refuses to be a part of the family and carries on with this<br/>
air of entitlement that he should be able to do and say what he wants<br/>
whenever he wants regardless of what anyone else needs, already has planned,<br/>
or money involved.  He refuses to take responsibility for his words or<br/>
actions.  He refuses to do anything with or for the family.  All of this<br/>
despite the fact that since his birth I have modeled doing things for others<br/>
and taking our own responsibility.  He will even comment when others don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest part of this is that when he is out in the world with others, I<br/>
hear about how great of a kid he is.  He REALLY IS a great person and I LOVE<br/>
hearing about it.  But since starting this unschooling journey he has been<br/>
treating his family in a bully-like way instead of with mutual respect like<br/>
he treats others outside our family.  I am really feeling like radical<br/>
unschooling has not been good for him/our family at all and I really don&#39;t<br/>
like that feeling.  I really want this to work but we can&#39;t be bullied any<br/>
longer.we can&#39;t live tip-toeing around what he thinks he is entitled to.<br/>
The only thing I see to do is pull in the reigns and it is paining me to<br/>
feel like I failed him and our family by making the choice to radically<br/>
unschool.<br/>
I don&#39;t know what I want or don&#39;t want to hear from you all.  I might just<br/>
be venting but I just can&#39;t take this life anymore.  I can&#39;t watch him be so<br/>
mean to his brother, talk so hateful to me or my dh, essentially make our<br/>
lives hell.  <br/>
I don&#39;t expect or even want some fairy tale life, just a life in which we<br/>
can all be happy and peaceful more often than not. A life in which his<br/>
little brother isn&#39;t afraid of him walking in the room, a life in which we<br/>
can all breathe easier and not worry about the next shoe dropping.  A life<br/>
where the respect is mutual, not just one sided.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Did he want to come home, or would he have preferred to stay in school?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So the entire life of his little brother (half brother?) his life has  <br/>
been changed.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ve been married since 2004?   So Seth has a stepdad?   That seems  <br/>
the biggest factor in what I could see from that post.<br/>
<br/>
You said &quot;funschooling,&quot; but one principle is that it&#39;s only fun if  <br/>
everybody&#39;s having fun.   It&#39;s only funny if everyone thinks it&#39;s funny.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The biggest part of this is that when he is out in the world with  <br/>
others, I<br/>
hear about how great of a kid he is. He REALLY IS a great person and I  <br/>
LOVE<br/>
hearing about it. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This was true of Kirby.  He has some resentments firstborns can easily  <br/>
have, and we moved when he wasn&#39;t thrilled about moving, and he didn&#39;t  <br/>
get the room in the new house he had first wanted.   But he was always  <br/>
great elsewhere, and I comforted myself then with the idea that we  <br/>
were helping him grow up to live elsewhere, not at home.<br/>
<br/>
-=- He refuses to take responsibility for his words or<br/>
actions. He refuses to do anything with or for the family. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That first question, above, is a hingepoint.  Were his words and  <br/>
actions his own when he was ten years old?  Do you take responsibility  <br/>
for your words and actions which might have put a wedge between you  <br/>
and him, or made him feel like an outsider?<br/>
<br/>
-=I really want this to work but we can&#39;t be bullied any<br/>
longer.we can&#39;t live tip-toeing around what he thinks he is entitled to.<br/>
The only thing I see to do is pull in the reigns and it is paining me to<br/>

<br/>
Reins.  I want to clarify that it&#39;s &quot;pull in the reins,&quot; as on a  <br/>
horse&#39;s bridle.<br/>
Are you still riding him?  Did you give him free rein but not let him  <br/>
frolic in the pasture?<br/>
<br/>
-=-it is paining me to feel like I failed him and our family by making  <br/>

This also sounds like you made the decision and your son didn&#39;t.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m just guessing here, but does Seth have a different father?  Are you<br/>
remarried with younger children?  My kids are really far apart in age,<br/>
and people often suspect that to be the case even though it isn&#39;t, so I<br/>
don&#39;t want to assume here, just asking.<br/>
<br/>
If that IS the case, he may be feeling displaced in his family.  He IS<br/>
seperate, and older, and different than the other members of the family.<br/>
It is really difficult at times to navigate the teen world and the<br/>
little kid world simultaneously.  In many ways teens need more from<br/>
their parents than little kids, more rides to this or that, more in<br/>
depth conversations that are uninterrupted by little ones, etc.<br/>
<br/>
How much time is set aside for one on one with him?  It could make all<br/>
the difference in the world.  Not &quot;family&quot; time, since that is clearly<br/>
not what he wants, but &quot;mom&quot; time, with just mom, getting coffee or<br/>
going to a concert or movie.</div>

<br/>
How have you approached him about his actions?<br/>
<br/>
Do you think he deschooled enough? Ten years of schooling takes time  <br/>
to overcome; it takes longer for some kids than others.<br/>
<br/>
Is he intense? He might need help negotiating everyday interactions.  <br/>
Even at 14.<br/>
<br/>
He has had two new siblings after 10 years of being an only. And 4- <br/>
year-olds *can* be incredibly annoying to older kids. That doesn&#39;t  <br/>
excuse mean behavior, but perhaps there are underlying feelings he  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>How do you show respect for him? This isn&#39;t a snide question. I&#39;m just  <br/>
wondering what your view of respect is and whether he might be  <br/>
misinterpreting it.<br/>
<br/>
And though this may not be true for you at all, I wonder sometimes if  <br/>
people think that unschooling will automatically create always  <br/>
respectful, happy, peaceful children. When I unschool and parent in a  <br/>
peaceful way, it&#39;s because I believe it&#39;s the best life for my child  <br/>
(and for me, too). It doesn&#39;t guarantee anything. And for some kids  <br/>
(like mine), it takes &quot;more&quot; of it all. More BEing with, more  <br/>
presence, more understanding, more help. Not always easy. Always worth  <br/>
it.<br/>

your son is invited politely to participate in token ways.  *I* don&#39;t think<br/>
this is unschooling, quite honestly.  You got fed up with the homework, you<br/>
didn&#39;t want to go to the principal&#39;s office...You were taking responsiblity<br/>
for how he performed in that environs, and you chose to remove him because<br/>
it was easier for you.  You chose to radical unschool, and then you enforced<br/>
your choice.  No wonder this kid is mad at you.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids left it was their choice.  I gave my opinion that if they<br/>
decided to stay I would go to bat for them, and I was not going to shill for<br/>
the school.  One of my sons chose to go back and we found a democratic<br/>
school that allows him the freedom to explore.  I tell my kids what I am<br/>
comfortable doing, they tell me what they would like and we figure out the<br/>
solution together.  Some times I take the lead, because I am older and I am<br/>
the one that sees the problems and issue more clearly.  But at some point<br/>
there is a compromise.<br/>

<br/>
Respect is invisible.  Can&#39;t you just make specific requests and respect his<br/>
decisions?  You aren&#39;t truly giving him options if you are invested in the<br/>
outcome and resent his choices.  I am hearing you want obedience rather than<br/>
offering choice.  If you can&#39;t truly offer a choice at times can you not<br/>
just say so honestly?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340995635">i totally agree with jenny, and wonder if you have read &quot;parent-teen breakthrough: the relationship approach&quot;<br/>
<br/>
i seriously question your questioning about whether radical unschooling is the &quot;problem&quot; - my relationship with my teen (14 in 3 weeks) is *vastly* improved from just 6 months of RU - and it seems very likely that there are other factors that are causing/contributing to a fracture in your relationship with your teen and his with the rest of the family, that have nothing to do with RU, and would, in fact, be much much worse, if on top of whatever issues are going on, he was also being forced to go to school and eat and come out of his room at specific times, and not play video games, etc. etc.  <br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d suggest looking at HIM and your relationship, and his place in  the family, and not the lifestyle, in terms of where changes might  need to be made.  <br/>

These questions are good ones, about what other factors could affect a  <br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s something that adults often think about parenting their <br/>
children:  that adults see more clearly.<br/>
<br/>
They see some things clearly and others not as clearly.  As do their <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
The difference is that adults generally have more experience in making <br/>
decisions and the legal wherewithal and duty to make lots of those <br/>
decisions.  Children&#39;s ability to choose is derived from whatever <br/>
decisions parents have the legal right to transfer to their children.<br/>
<br/>
To reiterate: children see some things much more clearly from their own <br/>
standpoint than their parents can.<br/>
<br/>
Talk with your children and ask them what they think at least about <br/>
some things.<br/>

we do something or not, but even within that, there can be choices.  If<br/>
I need to go to the store and my youngest needs to come with me, we can<br/>
have a dozen or more choices within that context, like where to go to<br/>
the store, how long we shall be gone, where else we can stop, what we<br/>
can purchase, which cart to use, what radio station to listen to in the<br/>
car, which seat to sit in, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a directive sent down from the heavens, &quot;though shalt go to the<br/>
store and enjoy it!&quot;, it&#39;s a &quot;we need to go to the store because we have<br/>
this narrow time frame in which to do it and we really do need milk and<br/>
dog food, and dad isn&#39;t home, so you need to come with so that you won&#39;t<br/>
be home alone, so what would you like to get at the store, and would you<br/>
like to stop at the library?&quot;</div>

you were forced to give an explanation, what would you say? I think we <br/>
need more to go on.  -pam~~~<br/>
 <br/>
I have what might be a typical theory of: I think he resents the fact that<br/>
he was an only child for 10 years.  8 of which it was just him and me at<br/>
home (his father has not been in the picture since he was 3 weeks old).<br/>
Being a single mom, I had to work and he had to go to day care then school<br/>
but since he was diagnosed ADHD when he was 5, I did everything I could to<br/>
take him to school and be home after school so he didn&#39;t have to go to day<br/>
care because I noticed it over-stimulated him and made behavior worse at<br/>
home and school.  We had a pretty good relationship then, only really<br/>
strained when school/homework was brought into the picture.  I did parent<br/>
differently - more mainstream and less respectful but it never felt right,<br/>
just didn&#39;t know other options at the time.<br/>
When his stepdad and I got together, Seth loved him and there was this<br/>
instant bond.  It didn&#39;t take as long as I thought it would for Seth to want<br/>
to call Chet &quot;Dad&quot; and we never pushed it - it was his idea.  We had started<br/>
changing our parenting style to being more respectful of him and his<br/>
needs/wants.  It was a gradual process but it allowed for us to step out of<br/>
our own way more when we discovered we discovered we were pregnant.  We<br/>
involved Seth as much as he wanted to be involved - he even named his<br/>
brother.  I made a vow that Seth would never have to watch Aden like so many<br/>
other families just automatically require of older siblings.  When Chet and<br/>
I got married, it was really a family thing where we all took vows together<br/>
(lots of talking and making sure Seth was okay with it prior to doing it).<br/>
We were not in a financial position for me to quit work and bring Seth home<br/>
until very late in my pregnancy.  We had been talking with him about the<br/>
option because he was miserable in school.  He was being bullied almost<br/>
daily, in trouble daily for talking in class (because he finished his work<br/>
and was bored), homework was a battle every night and took forever to<br/>
complete because of the struggle - not the difficulty.  Then I thought I<br/>
*had* to leave him in school for the rest of the year (It was winter break<br/>
when I was able to come home and in hind-sight could have brought him home<br/>
then, but again I didn&#39;t realize I could).  Anyway, things seemed to be<br/>
going well after Aden was born until he was about a year old.  Then Seth<br/>
started getting annoyed with him easily and progressively getting more and<br/>
more mean with him and us.<br/>
We have tried to have discussions with Seth over the years in which we were<br/>
completely open to listen and try to figure out what could help us all be<br/>
happy and respect each other but Seth shuts down and won&#39;t talk with us or<br/>
he will seem to tell us what he thinks we want to hear, we all agree to work<br/>
together and a week later its back to the same thing.  After a more recent<br/>
blow-up I asked him why he thinks he is so unhappy in our family and he just<br/>
shrugged his shoulders and mumbled, &quot;I dunno.&quot;  I shared my theory and he<br/>
said, &quot;maybe subconsciously.&quot;  He wouldn&#39;t elaborate or say anything more.<br/>
I am not sure what else to share about this regarding your questions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you shouldn&#39;t have made a vow like this.  Perhaps if he&#39;d felt<br/>
more connected in this way, he&#39;d feel differently towards his siblings. <br/>
I don&#39;t require Chamille to watch Margaux, but I&#39;ve asked on many<br/>
occasions, and I&#39;ve offered to pay on many more.  It&#39;s not something<br/>
that I abuse at all, it&#39;s a priviledge that I use carefully.  They love<br/>
it when it is just the 2 of them at home, they get along tremendously<br/>
when it is just them doing their thing, and that is what it is, their<br/>
thing, their bond.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, things seemed to be<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; going well after Aden was born until he was about a year old. Then<br/>

 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more mean with him and us.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve experienced that to a degree.  Chamille expected that having a<br/>
baby sister would be very different than what it was.  She was<br/>
disappointed because her little sister cried all the time and never let<br/>
her hold her or play with her.  She only wanted me, which not only hurt<br/>
Chamille&#39;s feelings, it also took me away from her more.  Double whammy!<br/>
Yet is was only because of that awareness that we were able to move<br/>
through it and help Chamille handle it better, not perfectly, but<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
It took a few years, until Margaux was able to spend more time with dad,<br/>
which allowed me to spend more time with Chamille.  In the meamtime, we<br/>
relied heavily on dad, my husband, spending more time with Chamille.<br/>
<br/>
However, you added another person to the mix last year.  So, yet again,<br/>
your time is taken by another little person, where it could otherwise be<br/>
given to Seth.  That&#39;s gotta be incredibly frustrating for a teenager<br/>
who NEEDS his mom and one on one time and focused attention from the<br/>
adults in his life.</div>

<br/>
Is it OK for your son to be unhappy? Is it OK for him to dislike his little brother? You might be working toward a goal he doesn&#39;t share, but he feels like he &quot;should&quot; share, so it looks like he&#39;s going along with you. Then he acts out his honest feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Can he be himself, or are you pushing him to be part of what you picture as the &quot;perfect family&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
  our close family friend and her kids were here last year, staying with us for a few days, during a really dark time in our family.  having that mom to talk to and to witness our struggles was transformational for me - AND - even more importantly - for my (then 13) year old daughter.  it was still a long and difficult road to where we find ourselves today - in a MUCH more connected, trusting, and loving place  - a place i could only imagine in my dreams up until recently.  <br/>
<br/>
  we were  fortunate in that this friend (she&#39;s on this list ;-)) had/has been a close friend since my daughter was 2, so the relationship was already there.  but the depth of the connection was massively expanded through that *real* and difficult experience and i think for a teen to have &quot;many mothers&quot; or others outside the nuclear family to whom they feel connected and by whom they feel loved and &quot;seen&quot; is very very valuable.<br/>

situations and legal and moral obligations bearing down on me that I feel<br/>
compelled to share those views with my children.  Let me share an example.<br/>
I don&#39;t police food.  I don&#39;t have rat poison in the fridge so noone is<br/>
going to die a horrific death if they make their own choices.  When I am at<br/>
parties with conventional parents (we skip a lot of them) and cake or ice<br/>
cream is served my middle son will be first in line.  The adult scoop or<br/>
knife in had will  feel it necessary to comment on this.  Of course they<br/>
aren&#39;t at our house watching him balance his diet.  His weight is fine, and<br/>
he rarely has the sniffles ;).  I&#39;m guessing we are good.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s something that adults often think about parenting their<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; They see some things clearly and others not as clearly. As do their<br/>

&gt; decisions parents have the legal right to transfer to their children.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To reiterate: children see some things much more clearly from their own<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-221619174">~~~Did he want to come home, or would he have preferred to stay in<br/>
school?~~~<br/>
I replied to Pam&#39;s post before reading yours so some of this will be<br/>
repeats.  He had not asked to come home but I offered the option.  We talked<br/>
a lot about what unschooling is and how he would stay &quot;caught up&quot; in case he<br/>
wanted to go back to school at some point.  He wanted to try it out for a<br/>
year and see so that was what we did.  During that year he expressed<br/>
concerns about math particularly and we talked about what might help him<br/>
feel better about it.  He realized that he used math quite a bit in daily<br/>
life and his fears were absolved.  The end of the year we talked about him<br/>
returning to school and he was happy being at home.  A year later he talked<br/>
about wanting to go back to school and upon discussing why he wanted to, it<br/>
was to hang out with his friends more.  When we discussed it further he<br/>
decided against going to school because he wouldn&#39;t really be hanging out<br/>
with them.  We also figured out ways for him to get more hang out time with<br/>
his schooled friends AND his homeschooled friends.<br/>
 <br/>
~~~So the entire life of his little brother (half brother?) his life has <br/>
been changed.~~~<br/>
Yes, you are correct and yes, half brother.<br/>
 <br/>
~~~You&#39;ve been married since 2004? So Seth has a stepdad? That seems <br/>
the biggest factor in what I could see from that post.<br/>
You said &quot;funschooling,&quot; but one principle is that it&#39;s only fun if <br/>
everybody&#39;s having fun. It&#39;s only funny if everyone thinks it&#39;s funny.~~~<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Seth has a stepdad whom has been his main/only father figure.  I think<br/>
it is somewhat of a factor but I think the bigger factor is I think he feels<br/>
like we have started over with our own family even though we have done<br/>
everything in our power to not distinguish/make it seem that way.<br/>
You are absolutely right - this is what I am desperately trying to<br/>
accomplish.everybody having fun.<br/>
 <br/>
~~~ I comforted myself then with the idea that we <br/>
were helping him grow up to live elsewhere, not at home.~~~<br/>
I have really tried to focus on that as well but when it comes down to<br/>
having to protect Aden from Seth and us living in fear of his temper, what<br/>
kind of life is that for the rest of us?<br/>
 <br/>
~~~Were his words and actions his own when he was ten years old? Do you take<br/>
responsibility <br/>
for your words and actions which might have put a wedge between you <br/>
and him, or made him feel like an outsider?~~~<br/>
For the most part, yes I would say his words and actions were his own when<br/>
he was 10.  Yes, at least most of the time, I take responsibility for my<br/>
words and actions.  I will not say I am conscious of it 100% of the time but<br/>
I try to be aware of how my choices and things I say might affect others.<br/>
When we first started being more respectful parents then unschooling, I made<br/>
a point to apologize to Seth about how disrespectful I had been prior to and<br/>
that I would work very hard at being respectful.  I don&#39;t know of anything I<br/>
have said or done that would have put a wedge between us or made him feel<br/>
like an outsider.  If I have inadvertently done so, I wish someone (he or<br/>
anyone else) would point it out to me.  <br/>
 <br/>
~~~ Reins. I want to clarify that it&#39;s &quot;pull in the reins,&quot; as on a <br/>
horse&#39;s bridle.<br/>
Are you still riding him? Did you give him free rein but not let him <br/>
frolic in the pasture?~~~<br/>
I knew using that phrase was not really the right wording.  The only<br/>
&#39;riding&#39; I can think of that I *might* be doing or that he might consider<br/>
being riding is trying to protect Aden and the rest of the family from his<br/>
bullying (physical for Aden, mental/emotional with us).  As respectfully as<br/>
I can talk with him and explain how it feels when he does things and remind<br/>
him of our agreements to be respectful.  He has had free reign since we<br/>
started unschooling.  We went more radical soon after the first RE<br/>
conference we attended the September after his 5th grade year (he was 11 by<br/>
then - July bday).  <br/>
 <br/>
~~~ This also sounds like you made the decision and your son didn&#39;t.~~~<br/>
It was a joint decision with much discussion.  He knows he has the choice to<br/>
return to school if he wants, he knows he has the choice to do what he<br/>
wants.  The thing that seems to be unclear to him is that with these choices<br/>
comes responsibility to respect those around him and our financial<br/>
situations.  He *is* entitled to do, feel, be what he wants and he is free<br/>
to do so.  That entitlement and freedom ends when others rights to safety<br/>
and happiness are being stomped on.<br/>

I want to respond with something in the post that came in my box immediately after yours: <br/>
<br/>
katherand wrote:<br/>
&quot;Unschooling principles exist not to control children, sign them up and <br/>
&quot;make&quot; them peace out.  This isn&#39;t the Geneva conference.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Caren wrote something that applies beautiful to what you&#39;ve written with regards to &quot;agreements to be respectful&quot; and other mentions of agreements and discussions. I think it might help for you to reread her writing.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Before I knew of radical unschooling, I read &quot;Positive Discipline&quot;<br/>
and tried the techniques from that book. I learned some through that,<br/>
but one thing we did over and over (and I didn&#39;t even see it at the<br/>

were agreements to clean before he came home, which were rarely upheld.<br/>
There was no room for &quot;I don&#39;t want to clean, how can we address this?&quot;<br/>
We were all miserable. No one was being honest - we were trying to be<br/>
kind to each other, but still get &quot;our way&quot;. (Man! I am SO grateful we<br/>
found radical unschooling!!) I pushed my family into giving up TV this<br/>
way - but they all agreed, right? They agreed because it&#39;s what Mama<br/>
wanted, and they knew they weren&#39;t free to disagree. (not proud of that)&quot;<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever agreed to something when you were calm and not been able to keep that agreement when things are stressful? An agreement to be respectful seems both vague and potential massive. How do you deal with anger and intensity if you have to uphold your agreement to be respectful? If you are in a heated moment is it truly helpful to you if someone says &quot;remember our agreement to be respectful&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
A lot of what you write seems like you have very formal discussions. That may not be the case, I recognize that this format lends itself to more formal writing. So what your writen about discussions about school may falsely sound as though you are sitting down to a family discussion when in practice the discussions were actually happening while you were driving somewhere or while you both were doing something else and the conversation just arose. If discussions here get too formal it becomes a bit like a principal talking to a student, I am the one with the power and Simon or Linnaea are squirming under my powerful gaze. They agree with me and my goals in part because I&#39;m really good at framing my words. It is much better if I mention something in passing, or talk about it when something else is going on. <br/>
<br/>
You wrote that he first wanted to unschool for only a year and then decided to take it on as a permanent thing. I ask Simon and Linnaea, every once in a while, if they want to go to school. I want them to make that choice. I want them to know that they are doing this staying out of school thing because they are choosing to. I would miss them and this life if they did choose to go to school, but I will adjust to give them what they want. And if they change their mind about school if they ever decide to go, I&#39;ll be happy to make that adjustment too. <br/>
<br/>
I think you are holding him accountable to agreements in a way that isn&#39;t going to help either of you to get along. I think you are trying to fix too many things with words. There is probably nothing you can say that will make him feel good about his brother or his sister. There is probably nothing that you can say that will make him feel better. But there are things you can do. You said when he felt like he wasn&#39;t getting enough time with friends you worked to make that less of an issue. Instead of talking about things with him, work to make things better. Give him more time when you can. Sit with him while he plays games, help him to feel more connected with you. Don&#39;t worry about his relationship with his brother, do what you can to not let them be alone together. If Aden wants to hang out with Seth, you be there too. If Seth doesn&#39;t want Aden around, then make sure that he has his space from Aden. See if you can get time to do stuff just you and<br/>
 Seth. Ask Chet to watch Aden and Emma and go out to a movie with Seth or do something else that he might enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t spend time looking for what made it all go wrong, look for ways to make it better now. Make sure that you are offering him food at regular intervals, and not verbally, bring him food he likes. Make sure you are offering him things to do that are interesting for him and aren&#39;t about tagging along on something more about entertaining a 4 year old. Have his friends over more. If he is more pleasant when he&#39;s out, go out with him more. <br/>
<br/>
You wrote: <br/>
Yes, Seth has a stepdad whom has been his main/only father figure.  I think<br/>
it is somewhat of a factor but I think the bigger factor is I think he feels<br/>
like we have started over with our own family even though we have done<br/>
everything in our power to not distinguish/make it seem that way. <br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;ve also written a couple of times that he isn&#39;t being a part of the<br/>
family. It means that whatever you are doing to distinguish that isn&#39;t working. You are feeling like he isn&#39;t acting like a part of your family. I don&#39;t know that I understand how that works. Simon sometimes plays video games and listens to Harry Potter books on cd or ipod and is kind of out of the main family loop. So I make the loop bigger and go and hang out where he is. I make sure that I touch him and sit with him and chat with him and be with him. I find something that he wants to do with me, or I do with him what he is doing. And I bring him food and drink. I include him in my day. <br/>
<br/>
You also wrote: <br/>
<br/>
You are absolutely right - this is what I am desperately trying to<br/>
accomplish.everybody having fun.<br/>
<br/>
and <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
others rights to safety<br/>
and happiness are being stomped on.<br/>
<br/>
I think that everybody having fun is outside of your ability. Everybody having fun is something that you can encourage and support, but it is their own choice and ability that makes it so. And while I think that people have a right to be safe in their own home, they don&#39;t have a right to happiness. In the U.S. you can argue they have the right to the pursuit of happiness, but not actually to attaining that happiness. Helping everybody to feel safe is a good thing. Helping to make the members of your family have things they enjoy doing and going to places they like to go and finding new things that might also be good to do, those things fall within your remit. But making sure that the outcome is happiness or fun, that is outside of what you can do. It might help to recognize your own limitations. <br/>

<br/>
Not as a replacement father figure but just as more experience, <br/>
consider cultivating other father figures for your son.  There might be <br/>
other unschooling dads you could trust who are willing to help in this <br/>
way.  I posted earlier about mother figures and how important a part <br/>
that has played in helping me to see many options and different ways of <br/>
thinking about all kinds of things, especially where conflict seemed to <br/>
haunt my every step.  I wasn&#39;t an unschooler yet having other &quot;mothers&quot; <br/>
was a great help to me.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trying to protect Aden and the rest of the family from his<br/>

<br/>
Consider that this is too much responsibility for a 14 year old.  How <br/>
is it possible that a 14 year could emotionally or mentally &quot;ride&quot; an <br/>
adult?  Lack of clarity about the situation probably for one.  Also <br/>
giving a child something too heavy to be responsible for (for instance, <br/>
the mental and emotional outlook of adults) is typical with first born <br/>
children.  I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t make it his duty to look after Aden.  I <br/>
think that stems from not feeling able oneself as a new parent mostly.  <br/>
I&#39;m working overtime myself to provide for Karl&#39;s emotional and mental <br/>
needs without talking any about my own or giving Karl the duty to help <br/>
me with my emotions or thought life.  I feel it&#39;s very important to <br/>
keep my needs filled without directly involving Karl in the <br/>
consideration of those, while at the same time reminding him to <br/>
consider the feelings of others.  So I&#39;m happy that he (like Seth) is <br/>
mostly considerate of others.  Definitely find other outlets to provide <br/>
emotional and mental stability for yourself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335394454">Christy--<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding myself wondering about something. This may be way off the mark--I don&#39;t know--but I&#39;m wondering if your son could be feeling a deep anger about having too much responsibility for his own life.<br/>
<br/>
You said that he seemed to change after his baby brother was about a year old.  I&#39;m wondering if, as he got a sense of his brother&#39;s emerging independence surrounded by nurturing support, if he became angry that he wasn&#39;t receiving that same level of connected support?  Everything you&#39;ve said about him was in terms of &quot;his&quot; choice.  Did you put too much choice on his 10 year old little shoulders?  I&#39;ve met families that have interpreted the radical unschooling message as everything being the child&#39;s choice, and I&#39;ve seen children who had a sort of anxiety (that I interpreted as being caused by too much responsibility) that made them treat parents very disrespectfully.<br/>
<br/>
How was your transition to radical unschooling?  A conversation that happened not too long ago here about autonomy helped cause the biggest shift for me in seeing that things really need to happen in connected partnership.  Seeing children as an autonomous island is not helpful to them--it can cause them to feel fearful down deep and then react outwardly in some of the ways you&#39;ve described.  It seems to be pretty common, though, with families coming to radical unschooling with children older than babies.  Could your son be feeling some inner insecurity that is driving his behavior?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen children &quot;acting out&quot; to try to get their parents attention (including my own when we threw away the rules and declared ourselves unschoolers--LOL).  It&#39;s my theory that this is what some people observe when they think that children crave boundaries and limits.  I think there is some truth to this, but not in the usual authoritarian sense.  I think they are craving connection and guidance.  Not the kind of connection where you ask them what they want intellectually--I mean the deeper kind where you just know.  And the fact that you have no intuitive sense of what could be going on for him is what is making me wonder why he feels like an isolated island.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; When we first started being more respectful parents then unschooling, I made<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a point to apologize to Seth about how disrespectful I had been prior to and<br/>
&gt; that I would work very hard at being respectful.  I don&#39;t know of anything I<br/>
&gt; have said or done that would have put a wedge between us or made him feel<br/>
&gt; like an outsider.  If I have inadvertently done so, I wish someone (he or<br/>
&gt; anyone else) would point it out to me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you still feel apologetic towards him?  Maybe you set up a dynamic where you feel like you are still &quot;making it up to him,&quot; or like you deserve his disrespectful treatment.  Are you meeting his disrespect genuinely in the moment, or are you trying to be some idea in your head of the perfect unschooling mom reacting in some perfect way?  Have you lost the part of yourself as a parent that sets the tone in your house by accommodating his anger?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering if you are spending so much time trying to figure it out that you are not taking steps with him to create more actual peace?  He may be waiting for you to re-emerge as a leader in this area.  My son can tend toward emotional wallowing, and he depends on me to be the &quot;kick in the pants&quot; voice to help him get unstuck when it&#39;s really time to be thinking about moving on.  It&#39;s not something he can do all the time for himself at this point in time.  I empathize, etc., for a while, but then there&#39;s a point when things begin to go around in circles, like the needle on the record player being stuck, that I know is my cue to change the tone of the conversation.  Maybe your son is waiting for something along those lines?<br/>
<br/>
Like I said--I may be off the mark, but these were the impressions I was getting.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  absolutely.  my daughter needs me to &quot;collect&quot; her, (in gordon neufeld&#39;s words) - to reach out to her in ways that are meaningful to HER, and make her an absolute priority for a chunk of time.  this has looked as simple and quick ase a 15 minute car ride,  to as extensive as a weekend away with me  - just me - or me and a group of women friends.  in a week and a half she is going with me to the life is good unschooling conference, and my son is not (because he doesn&#39;t want to.)  last weekend we went on a 2 hour trail ride on horses with an hour and a half drive each way.  in june we are going on a mother-daughter camping trip, and again in july, and in august to the HSC conference in CA.  these trips have done wonders recently to cement our relationship and  help her feel cherished for who she is and her role and place in the family.  with much youger kids, those longer trips may be impossible, but it&#39;s well worth it to plan some shorter, doable activities just the two of you - and he and his step dad too, maybe.  <br/>

  have you read &quot;hold onto your kids: why parents matter more than peers&quot; by gordon neufeld?  highly recommend it.  when my daughter prefers peers it&#39;s when we are disconnected or things are strife-filled at home.  i wouldn&#39;t ask for suggestions - i&#39;d make plans and &quot;collect&quot; him.    that&#39;s not the same as force.<br/>

Try smaller individual time that isn&#39;t about joining in at first so <br/>

only has one of those.  Make your relationship something he will <br/>
remember happily.  It sounds like there was some turmoil when he was <br/>
younger and now lots of attention to the younger kids, and now he&#39;s <br/>
resigned himself to mom getting upset about it and he doesn&#39;t know how <br/>

  yes!  especially if he&#39;s staying up most of the night - bring him a fun snack at midnight!  see if you are welcome to flop on his bed and joke around a  bit.  bring a cool funky movie you think he might like and see if he&#39;ll watch it with you.  spontaneously invite him out for his favorite food at 10pm!  etc.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955822766">~~~How have you approached him about his actions?~~~<br/>
If he is being mean to Aden, I have to intervene quickly which sometimes<br/>
means having to yell to get his attention.  I have tried talking with him<br/>
after the fact when we have both calmed down.  I have tried talking with him<br/>
in general long after the fact to see if it being less fresh would help the<br/>
communication process. It seems like nothing works.  He insists that the way<br/>
he acts is our fault as if he has no control over what he says or does.<br/>
Almost as if we are puppeteers.  <br/>
 <br/>
~~~ Do you think he deschooled enough? Ten years of schooling takes time <br/>
to overcome; it takes longer for some kids than others.~~~<br/>
I am not sure that there is a point in which deschooling stopped.  I mean,<br/>
to me deschooling is a period of time in which the family is getting past<br/>
the schooling time and more used to being a family that spends more time<br/>
together (building the relationship back) before getting started in some<br/>
other form of homeschooling.  Deschooling for us just gradually turned into<br/>
unschooling and really looked much the same.if not exactly the same.<br/>
 <br/>
~~~Is he intense? He might need help negotiating everyday interactions. Even<br/>
at 14.~~~<br/>
I am not sure how to answer this.  I am thinking that if he were intense as<br/>
you say, I would be able to say, Yes he is.  He handles everyday<br/>
interactions just fine with others.<br/>
 <br/>
~~~perhaps there are underlying feelings he <br/>
hasn&#39;t had help dealing with?~~~<br/>
probably but I don&#39;t know how to help him when he won&#39;t let me in.<br/>
 <br/>
~~~ How do you show respect for him? This isn&#39;t a snide question. I&#39;m just <br/>
wondering what your view of respect is and whether he might be <br/>
misinterpreting it.~~~<br/>
Well, let&#39;s see.  I try to treat him as I would want to be treated - as I<br/>
treat my friends and family and strangers: speaking respectfully, gently<br/>
instead of yelling, demanding, demeaning. Asking his opinion, what he<br/>
wants/needs and honoring differences of opinion and doing what I can to meet<br/>

~~~ I wonder sometimes if <br/>
people think that unschooling will automatically create always <br/>
respectful, happy, peaceful children.~~~<br/>
Wow, this would be great!  if there could be a guaranteed way to have this<br/>
result.dreamy!  <br/>
 <br/>
~~~ More BEing with, more <br/>
presence, more understanding, more help. Not always easy. Always worth<br/>
it.~~~<br/>
I agree, always worth it.  How does one do this without forcing themselves<br/>
on the teen?<br/>
