<div id="ygrps-yiv-427485274">My son, Cas, has a checkup scheduled in a few weeks, and I am wondering how to handle the weigh in.  I haven&#39;t had him to the doctor for a few years. The last time he had a checkup, the doctor told him he was &quot;a little heavy.&quot;  The doc was not mean or lecturing, just said stuff like &quot;be sure to eat healthy and get some exercise.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This ended up having a bad effect on my son&#39;s self-image.  He started to call himself fat, and think of himself as fat.  I don&#39;t consider him fat.  He is a little chubby, he has a bit of a tummy on him, but I don&#39;t consider him fat.<br/>
  <br/>
Although he tends more toward sedentary activities, he also likes to play basketball; he has been taking karate twice a week for a couple of years now, so I would describe him as moderately active.  His weight does not interfere with him doing physical activity.<br/>
<br/>
In preparation for what we might hear at the doctor&#39;s office next week, I put Cas&#39; stats into a height/weight chart.  He is 5&#39;2 and 135 pounds, and that is considered obese!  Obese?  I was shocked.  I think it&#39;s bullcrap.  He&#39;s not obese. <br/>
<br/>
I know that if he hears the word &quot;obese&quot; in the doctor&#39;s office, it is going to do a number on an already shaky body image.<br/>
<br/>
I have dealt with negative body image all my life, I remember feeling fat when I was young, probably from age 8 on up.  When I look back at pictures of myself when I was a child, I was not fat in the least.   I sometimes wonder how things might have been different if I had not thought of myself as fat.  If I had had a positive body image instead.<br/>
<br/>
So I know firsthand that how you perceive yourself and how you feel about yourself matters greatly.  I would like for my son to not feel bad about his weight.<br/>
<br/>
I am considering slipping the doctor a note beforehand explaining that Cas is already sensitive about his weight, that he eats pretty healthy and does get exercise, and to ask the doctor not to hammer on the weight too hard. Or at all.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t take him for the check up at all (the reason he hasn&#39;t been is because for a few years is because I wanted to avoid further weight discussions with the doc,) but Cas wants to go for a specific purpose.  (His ears have been bothering him since we flew on an airplane last spring and we are planning another plane trip and he&#39;s worried about how that will affect his ears.) <br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anyone has dealt with this issue and, if so, how they handled it.  Does anyone have other suggestions besides giving the doctor a note beforehand?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,  Jennie</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-568388045">My oldest girl and boy are considered obese. They have always been&quot; big&quot; for their age. They are also alot taller than most kids their age. They eat pretty healthily and get physical activity, so I dont worry too much. We discuss healthy habits and the fact that their body type is probably genetic. I just spoke up and told the doctor what Ive just told you because the first time my doc mentioned weight(when my daughter was 5 or 6), my daughter started talking diets.<br/>
I think giving the doc a note beforehand is a good idea. Just let him know youve done your research, and that you dont need any further discussion on the matter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-363211098">I have dealt with this issue a bit.  I think your idea to slip the doctor a note beforehand is a good one.  In our doctor&#39;s office the nurse &quot;checks vitals, etc&quot; before the doctor shows up.  Maybe hand her the note and say &quot;it is very important that the doctor read this before he come in&quot; would be helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
In my case I actually pre-visited the doctor (it&#39;s a family practitioner and I had an appointment for myself a few weeks ahead) and talked there.  They &quot;flagged&quot; my child&#39;s appointment with the info. we talked about.  Worked very well.  The conversation also gave me peace that this was a doctor that would be respectful, too.  If I&#39;d had the pre-appointment with a doctor who started lecturing and &quot;giving me the business&quot; I would have found someone else before bringing my child in.<br/>
<br/>
Healthy body image is so much more important than where the weight falls on the chart!<br/>

<br/>
My husband was fat from the time he was a baby.  He was also strong, healthy and athletic.  <br/>
Both our boys went through phases of pudging up and thinning out as they got taller.  As young adults, each has had a paunchy season and thinned down from it by having a strenuous job or doing sports, and neither has ever been as big as his dad.  <br/>
<br/>
I was a skinny kid, and as an older woman I&#39;m NOT.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe looking around at other people you know, at their parents and grandparents, at pictures of different kinds of people, would make him feel better about the range of normal!  <br/>
<br/>
I think a note to the doctor, or just not going to the doctor, might be okay.    Maybe try some ear drops to soften wax, in case that&#39;s the problem with the ears.  And chewing gum in an airplane can be a way to keep ear-parts moving.  And taking dramamine (if it&#39;s causing a pressure headache) might be the way to go--help him sleep through the flight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498996962">If his ears are bothering him bring him to an  ENT. The Dr won&#39; be concerned  <br/>
about his weight. If you son doesn&#39;t want to know his weight have him turn  <br/>
the opposite way on the scale and say your son doesn&#39;t want to know his  <br/>
weight. My daughter does that. The number on the scale is not going to say  <br/>
you are healthy. Eating right and exercise will so that. We don&#39;t have a  <br/>
scale in the house<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Where did you get this from?<br/>
<br/>
If I get this right, he is 1.62m and 62kg - Using the metric formula,<br/>
that&#39;s a BMI (Body Mass Index) of 23.64 - That&#39;s considered normal!<br/>
The formula for metric BMI is  *k**i**l**o**g**r**a**m**s* / *m**e**t**e**r*<br/>
*s*2<br/>
<br/>
The imperial formula is *B**M**I* = *l**b* * 703 / *i**n*2 If I use 62<br/>
inches and 135 pounds that gives me 24,69 - That&#39;s still normal!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not even overweight, where did you get the idea he&#39;s obese? He&#39;s got<br/>
another 30 pounds to go before he reaches obesity<br/>

In retracing my steps to answer your question, I saw that the site was called, of all things, Blubberbusters. I&#39;m embarrassed that I used that site and didn&#39;t notice it.  Here&#39;s the link to the calculator I used: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.blubberbuster.com/height_weight.html">http://www.blubberbuster.com/height_weight.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the wake up call.  I poked around on some other sites and put the same numbers in to a different calculator and got a BMI of 24.7, which is closer to the one you got.  <br/>
<br/>
Is it too cynical to think that the Blubberbusters have something to gain by more people thinking their kids are overweight?<br/>
