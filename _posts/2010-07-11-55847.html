<div id="ygrps-yiv-136661489">I&#39;ve been listening to several books while I do other things around  <br/>
the house, while I work in the yard, while I play pattern games to  <br/>
recover from working and doing.<br/>
<br/>
One, I&#39;ve finished. One&#39;s not bothering me so much.  They&#39;re all  <br/>
social science, with commentaries on research.  They have  <br/>
similarities. The easy &quot;good&quot; one is _Click_, about friendships that  <br/>
form suddenly and easily.  One is _How Pleasure Works_; still  <br/>
listening to that one, but it&#39;s not bugging me.<br/>
<br/>
One is taking a long time because it bothers me a lot.  It&#39;s  <br/>
_NurtureShock_.  I could say a lot about it, and somewhere (facebook?   <br/>
RUNning?) someone asked.  If anyone remembers where that request to  <br/>
discus it was, I could go there, later, when I&#39;m through it.<br/>
<br/>
The reader is doing a bad job of reading.  He wrote it.  Still, his  <br/>
voice is painful because he&#39;s using a sing-song with high-pitched  <br/>
emphasis.  I hope he doesn&#39;t talk to his own child that way, but I&#39;m  <br/>
guessing he does.   Can&#39;t say it &quot;monotonous,&quot; because musically  <br/>
speaking, it&#39;s all over the place.  But it&#39;s like the same irritating  <br/>
bird call over and over and over.   So I should say that I&#39;m pre- <br/>
irritated, and I don&#39;t want to pay for the book in hard copy just so I  <br/>
can get through it more quickly.  Then it will be sitting in my house  <br/>
like a brick.  I might get the paperback used, later, for marking  <br/>
passages, or something.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I wrote down to share, though.  This is about research on  <br/>
young children.  These phrases were used without shame or amusement,  <br/>
as though they made a great deal of sense and were worthy of deep  <br/>
thought:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;preschoolers&#39; EF capability&quot;<br/>
&quot;attentional focus&quot;<br/>
&quot;cognitive control&quot; (defined as &quot;when the brain has to manipulate  <br/>
information in the mind&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
What the hell!?<br/>
The emperor is wearing and breathing a bunch of hooey!  It&#39;s not real  <br/>
communication.  Can those medical-sounding latinate terms be  <br/>
translated into plain real English?!<br/>
<br/>
First, &quot;EF capability&quot; is &quot;executive function capability,&quot; which  <br/>
phrase alone is wordy word word for doey-do-do.<br/>
<br/>
All those quoted phrases above are about learning and thinking.<br/>
<br/>
This list is about learning and thinking.  We&#39;re not wiring any kids  <br/>
up, or having them prove they can (or can&#39;t) associate a picture on a  <br/>
computer of a flower with their right, and a heart with their left (or  <br/>
the other way around).  We&#39;re not doing catscans on them while they  <br/>
&quot;manipulate information.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I will stop and show you a different kind of treatment of learning,  <br/>
thinking and English:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Below is something Joyce Fetteroll wrote in the discussion about toy  <br/>
guns.    It is not bullshit.  It&#39;s in plain English.  It&#39;s based on  <br/>
direct experience and years of association with other people, of being  <br/>
observant, of thinking and of learning.  If you want to re-read it as  <br/>
a contrast to the phrases above, you&#39;ll see the beauty in plain  <br/>
English, and maybe understand a little better why I don&#39;t want people  <br/>
using any initials or jargon on this list:<br/>
<br/>
(Joyce, from here to the end)<br/>
<br/>
====================<br/>
<br/>
When these gun and TV and sugar discussions come up I suspect it reads<br/>
to some people like the unschoolers have different values. It&#39;s easy<br/>
to allow your kids to play with (toy) guns and eat Fritos if you don&#39;t<br/>
believe those are dangerous.<br/>
<br/>
But one of the goals of unschooling is creating an environment where<br/>
our kids can play around with ideas and decide what&#39;s right for them.<br/>
Part of creating that environment is how parents can prevent their own<br/>
beliefs from *interfering* with that process. Parents can&#39;t help but<br/>
influence. Nor should they! But they should be aware of how powerful<br/>
their influence is. Depending on a child&#39;s sensitivity, if beliefs<br/>
from their parents are starting to make more sense, they can feel<br/>
guilty and bad for having &quot;wrong&#39; thoughts. As they get deeper into<br/>
different beliefs that are feeling more right to them, they will trust<br/>
their parents less. And -- this is huge if someone wants unschooling<br/>
to work -- they can&#39;t bounce these new ideas off their parents to get<br/>
more input. They already know their thoughts are &quot;wrong&quot;. They already<br/>
know their parents want them not to see the right in those ideas.<br/>
<br/>
When parents impose their own beliefs -- even when they provide what<br/>
they&#39;re certain is good, solid information to support their beliefs --<br/>
they&#39;re doing what schools are doing: handing kids information to<br/>
accept as right and true. They&#39;re doing what any propagandist does:<br/>
providing information meant to sway someone&#39;s emotions and thoughts<br/>
towards a particular conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
But unschooling is about the messy process of trying on different<br/>
ideas like hundreds of different colored glasses to see what the world<br/>
looks like through them. They will layer glasses. They will toss some<br/>
aside after wearing them for a good while. Some won&#39;t even appeal so<br/>
they won&#39;t try. Every pair will have good points and bad points. The<br/>
question they&#39;re always asking is, &quot;Is the good worth the bad?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They will create, as they will continue to create through out their<br/>
lives, a unique collection of filters that feel right to them and<br/>
clarify the world in a way that&#39;s meaningful to them.<br/>
<br/>
One way to help parents avoid imposing strongly held beliefs is for<br/>
them to examine the foundation of beliefs *that interfere with<br/>
children&#39;s exploration of beliefs.&quot; To examine what actually happens<br/>
IN UNSCHOOLING FAMILIES where children are allowed to explore freely.<br/>
(Not just any family where the philosophy of parents towards children<br/>
is a big fat X of unknowable.)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents *can* be anti-gun pacifists, non-sugar-eating<br/>
vegetarians without creating an atmosphere where kids feel wrong for<br/>
trying on other beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
But holding a belief that toy guns and playacting violence promote<br/>
violence *will* interfere. *And*, not only that, but it doesn&#39;t hold<br/>
up to examination as the stories here indicate. I have yet to meet a<br/>
child who is respected for who he is, whose beliefs are respected, who<br/>
acts violently. It&#39;s not guns or legs of lamb or candlesticks that<br/>
cause violent desires but how people are treated by others.<br/>
<br/>
One of the great things about playacting violence is being able to<br/>
play in a world that someone *doesn&#39;t* want to live in but is<br/>
interested in exploring to see what it&#39;s like living with different<br/>
rules (different colored glasses). Living in a world where someone<br/>
solves problems with a gun means living in a world where *other*<br/>
people solve problems with guns. It&#39;s not a world where anyone can<br/>
peacefully go to the park or relax in the evening to watch TV. Kids<br/>
growing up in secure homes where they&#39;re respected for who they are<br/>
(even if they like guns and eating meat!) don&#39;t have any desire to<br/>
live in a world like that. They&#39;d have to give up too many other<br/>
beautifully colored glasses to wear the &quot;solve problems by shooting<br/>
problem people&quot; glasses.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984262893">I was just checking that book out on iTunes this morning.  I wanted  <br/>
something to listen to while I work out on the elliptical machine.   <br/>
That booked seemed... pretentious may be the word I&#39;m thinking.  I  <br/>
downloaded Orwell&#39;s 1984 instead.<br/>

You even commented on it saying that you were going to follow that thread!  I <br/>
haven&#39;t read the book.  The title turned me off!  So, please do review away and <br/>
I&#39;ll read up!  I&#39;m reading 3 other books right now, so I won&#39;t be picking up any <br/>
more soon!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I loved this book, to skim. I love research--yes, the kind with scientific researchers interacting with people, not just people reading books that support what they already believe!--which examines whether the popular ways of doing things are, actually, bullshit. <br/>
 <br/>
I take a lot of notes when I read. Here&#39;s my Cliff Notes version:<br/>
-Self-esteem programs INCREASE aggressive behavior of youth at risk. <br/>
-College students who kept gratitude journals regularly (but not daily I think) seemed to become happier, more optimistic, and got sick less often. <br/>
-Up to 15 months babies learn the names for objects much easier if you wiggle the object while saying the name. <br/>
-Babies gain vocabulary faster when parents pay more attention to what the baby is looking at than what the word sounds like when trying to figure out new speech<br/>
-In cultures in which spanking is seen as totally normal for kids, kids who are spanked are much less likely to exhibit more violent behavior than their peers<br/>
-Teen brain scans show that they actually consider doing horribly uncomfortable things when asked. While they usually say no just like adults, it&#39;s not because of a visceral reaction like the adults had, because they don&#39;t have enough experience yet to FEEL it<br/>
-The teen need for autonomy is higher at 11 than 18, and peaks around 14-15<br/>
-Telling a kid The Boy Who Cried Wolf doesn&#39;t usually decrease lying. Telling the George Washington & cherry tree story (role model who will not lie) usually does. The fact that that story appears to be a lie was not discussed. :)<br/>
-Some 3 and most 4 year olds lie<br/>
-In 1 study, the teens who lied the least were the ones with just a few rules in a few areas of their life, which were consistent and openly discussed in the context of a warm relationship <br/>
-The change in attention span for kids who got one hour less versus one hour extra sleep is greater than the gap between the average 4th and 6th graders<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more of course. I&#39;m sure I goofed something, and I can&#39;t give you the research that these assertions came from. But that&#39;s at least 2/3 of what interested me about the book. <br/>
