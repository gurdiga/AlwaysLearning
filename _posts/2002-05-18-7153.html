<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188226565">I HATE chiggers.  We are just north of San Antonio and they are terrible.<br/>
My 3 little guys are so ate up with them that I&#39;ve made them stay inside for<br/>
the last few days.  Michelle has lots of allergies and apparently chiggers<br/>
are no exception.  Poor thing is covered with oozing welts.  At least,<br/>
calamine lotion offers some relief.  Adriane (11) decided to grow out her<br/>
fingernails and of course wouldn&#39;t quit scratching her chiggers.  Ended up<br/>
with a staph infection that got into her eye and anywhere elastic was in her<br/>
clothes.  Some Rx meds fixed her right up but it was very uncomfortable for<br/>
her...but at least she decided to cut her fingernails (doing the happy mom<br/>
thing because I miss her little girl fingers &lt;sigh&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Give me scorpions anyday.  At least you have a chance of seeing them and<br/>
avoiding them.<br/>
<br/>
I teach a couple of karate classes in my garage.  (up to 14 students now<br/>
with 2 on a waiting list!!) One week we were invaded with worm snakes.  Last<br/>
week, we had to pause sparring matches 3 times to kill a scorpion running<br/>
across the ring.  I keep telling my students this is secret ninja<br/>
training.....but I don&#39;t think they are buying it  &lt;grin&gt;<br/>

<br/>
What are worm snakes?   <br/>
I&#39;m fascinated.<br/>
<br/>
And the invasion--was it five of them?  Ten?  <br/>
<br/>
Where is it that big red spiders walk across the country, through houses, <br/>
blocking traffic?  Australia?  Or was that just some horrible bad dream I had?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Now THAT would be something to see.  <br/>
<br/>
We just came back from the store and as I was parking the car, I saw a<br/>
huge black spider running down the road.  Now this is Montana and we just<br/>
don&#39;t see spiders that big so we jumped out and tried to grab the thing. <br/>
I did get my hand over him once then thought I&#39;d been bitten so I yanked<br/>
it away and he took off.  I hadn&#39;t been chomped, just poked by something<br/>
else, but we never did catch him.  Now I can&#39;t find anyone in our field<br/>
guide who looks like him and can&#39;t look at him again for more details and<br/>
Dylan&#39;s trying to draw a picture of him for later reference.  Don&#39;t know<br/>
if I&#39;d want a whole battalion marching through my house, but he was<br/>
pretty cool.  <br/>
<br/>
Deb L, who still doesn&#39;t know what chiggers look like, nor worm snakes<br/>
and never heard about giant traffic blocking red spiders, but it&#39;s<br/>
sounding more like a B movie all the time.</div>

 </span></blockquote>In the UAE and Saudi there are camel spiders which are as big as a dinner<br/>
plate. We&#39;ve had friends say they crawled across them when they were out<br/>
camping in the desert! I&#39;ve only seen them in a natural history museum here<br/>
thank goodness. <br/>

Could you be thinking of Christmas Island where they bright red crabs<br/>
migrate from the forest to the shore to release their eggs into the surf?<br/>
 Then later, the tiny hatchlings migrate from the shore to the forest<br/>
where they spend the majority of their life span.  A lot get squished but<br/>
the islanders do their best to give them safe passage.<br/>
