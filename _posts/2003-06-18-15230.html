<div id="ygrps-yiv-1009010684">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
The last time the TV debate came around on the other list (where I&#39;ve <br/>
deleted 800 messages and am now 800 behind), I was referred to as &quot;some <br/>
brave soul on this list who admitted they don&#39;t have a TV.&quot; Or something <br/>
like that.<br/>
<br/>
At that time I said we didn&#39;t have one and weren&#39;t planning to get one <br/>
because no one was asking for it--the kids know about TV but don&#39;t seem <br/>
to be attracted to it. They&#39;ve seen it at different places but don&#39;t pay <br/>
much attention to it--something like that was how I put it.<br/>
<br/>
Times change.<br/>
<br/>
Now the kids have gotten to where they want to go to the library to <br/>
watch Thomas videos on the computer game. They want me to drive 90 miles <br/>
to the train museum so they can watch train videos. Hmmm...time to get a TV.<br/>
<br/>
So Brian and I went to a pawn shop and spent $225 on a combo TV/VCR/DVD <br/>
(figured I&#39;d get less flack for one big expenditure and on bit thing <br/>
than on a whole bunch of stuff). Then we bought two train videos, a dump <br/>
truck video, two Thomas videos, and checked out video policies at the <br/>
library.<br/>
<br/>
The TV&#39;s in the living room--which I don&#39;t like--I&#39;d envisioned it in <br/>
the playroom--but doing fine. The kids are happy, and perhaps the next <br/>
time we go to the train museum we can enjoy the trains, although they <br/>
have a DIFFERENT video than we have, so perhaps they&#39;ll want to watch it <br/>
still.<br/>
<br/>
