 birthday?  *Both* my kids refused to nurse at that age; go figure.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

Are you sure it wasn&#39;t just a nursing strike that you accidentally<br/>
thought was weaning?  That happens a lot.  At about 8 or 9 months <br/>
old Allison went through a 3 day period when she cried everytime<br/>
I tried to nurse her.  She just didn&#39;t want it.  I hoped and prayed it <br/>
was just a nursing strike and kept offering my breast to her. About <br/>
four days later, she was back to nursing normally and the strike <br/>
was over.  Whew!!!  :-)  BTW, she started walking at 10 months.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Once<br/>
 they were walking, there was no slowing &#39;em down long enough to eat, much<br/>
 less nurse.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming since they are still alive, that they did slow down long<br/>
enough to eat in some fashion.  :-)<br/>

strike&quot; until just now.  I guess this discussion *does* belong on a list<br/>
called &quot;AlwaysLearning.&quot;<br/>

No one should feel guilty if their child decided to wean at an earlier age.<br/>
It pays to understand the issues Dar is talking about...but if you didn&#39;t at <br/>
the time then no reason for guilt.<br/>
Every child is different for sure! I do think you made some great points <br/>
about unwittingly encouraging the weaning process Dar.<br/>
<br/>
Mary, You have such a wonderful way of putting things, especially the <br/>
spiritual. I love your openness to discussion of ideas and your &quot;flowing&quot; <br/>
attitude. Your Zenness shines through!<br/>

3 days but then finally did when he was sleepy.  That was at around 9 <br/>
months.  When he was around 18 months, he started wanting to take it with <br/>
him.  Ouch!  I gently encouraged him to wean to a bottle, which he threw <br/>
away when he was about 3.  The other two weaned at a little over 4.<br/>
