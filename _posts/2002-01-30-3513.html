a red circle/slash with school in it (as in &quot;no school&quot;), and <br/>
unschooling.com under that. There&#39;s lots of places online. Head shops, if <br/>

head shop in the middle of nowhere in Wyoming. It says &quot;Learn from others, <br/>

piercings and tatoos. ;-)<br/>

I figure I&#39;ve got the piercing (nose) and the tatoo (shoulder) so why not<br/>
the crazy hippie station wagon? LOL<br/>
