<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109695653">Well, that&#39;s officially three (this is my pet superstition <br/>
showing...)  Sandra&#39;s fall, the passing of a beloved mother and a spouse <br/>
surviving a horrid car accident.<br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone out there stays safe, and that those of you in &#39;the 3&#39; heal <br/>
well!<br/>
(and I&#39;m not a big one for mushiness, but I&#39;ve gotta say that I LOVE (as in <br/>
luuuuuuuuve) that all the people on this list *think* so much.  It&#39;s such a <br/>
relief... or is it a &#39;Dodd-send&#39;? (evil grin))<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;I will not be online much but just wanted to check on<br/>
&gt;this question I had asked.  Lucky for me, and my sons,<br/>
&gt;my inlaws found a Super Nintendo and a number of games<br/>
&gt;in a closet that belonged to my husbands 18 year old<br/>
&gt;nephew.  Lucky Day!  Some games were not even opened,<br/>
&gt;including Tetris! Woo Hoo!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Now on to why I will not be online.  Thursday night on<br/>
&gt;his way home from work, my husband Tom was in a major<br/>
&gt;car accident.  He completely totaled his 13 year old<br/>
&gt;Geo when his visibility was compromised due to a<br/>
&gt;sudden rain and a dirty windshield, at night, on on<br/>
&gt;unlighted road, in the middle of nowhere (where he<br/>
&gt;works on a secure government reservation.)  He blew<br/>
&gt;through a stop sigh on a 55 mph road at a T<br/>
&gt;intersection.  Luckily he was hit (side inpact) by<br/>
&gt;another car, or he would have shot right off the road<br/>
&gt;and rolled the car.  Luckily he was also hit on the<br/>
&gt;passenger side.  As it was he had to leave his shoe<br/>
&gt;behind and tear his skin up extracting his pinned<br/>
&gt;right leg.  No air bag, but he was wearing his seat<br/>
&gt;belt as always, thank God.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;He managed to amaze emergency crews by climbing from<br/>
&gt;the wreck before they arrived.  They found him sitting<br/>
&gt;on the side of the road in the rain, his clothes<br/>
&gt;shredded, one bare foot, covered in blood from head to<br/>
&gt;foot.  He left wrist is badly broken and too swollen<br/>
&gt;yet for a cast.  His left leg is in a full leg brace<br/>
&gt;and his knee may need surgery.  His right arm, and the<br/>
&gt;right side of his head and face are heavily lacerated<br/>
&gt;from shattering glass.  His right ribs are badly<br/>
&gt;bruised and he has seat belt contusions and various<br/>
&gt;other hurts.  He is not moving around too well right<br/>
&gt;now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;My husband works out of town and stays with his inlaws<br/>
&gt;on Mon through Thurs, so I heard from them Thursday<br/>
&gt;night about his accident and after going through the<br/>
&gt;shock and everything, I hastily packed  the kids and<br/>
&gt;pets and some clothes in the car and headed to my<br/>
&gt;inlaws for an extended stay, caring for my broken<br/>
&gt;hubby.  So I am here and my time online will be<br/>
&gt;limited and our routine disrupted.  Still picking<br/>
&gt;glass our of Tom&#39;s hair and skin, helping his dress,<br/>
&gt;wash and get pain medications, helping the kids adjust<br/>
&gt;to different rules and whatnot here, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I hope everyone is well.  Hug your husband or wife<br/>
&gt;today and be thankful.<br/>

Nancy, my broken leg is like a scratch now.   {{{{{{{{{{Nancy}}}}}}}}}<br/>
I&#39;m so sorry, but glad too that you are with him and that he will recover.<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps that will help the boys be distracted through the stressful days in <br/>
your near future.  And if this game is not in that batch, consider finding a <br/>
used copy of:  Kirby&#39;s Avalanche  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good pattern-game, like Dr. Mario, which in my experience can <br/>
mesmerize a mom to bring on   a state of stillness.<br/>

Way too close to what we assure everyone won&#39;t happen and rattling to the<br/>
safe foundation we are certain will always be there. Encourage lots of extra<br/>
cuddles all around to heal those wounds.<br/>
