&gt; I think you&#39;d find that there are two distinct grassroots groups involved<br/>
&gt; in the homeschooling movement, the people who homeschool for religious<br/>
&gt; reasons or because the schools are too liberal, and the group that John<br/>
&gt; Holt started helping to homeschool when he got fed up with trying to change<br/>
&gt; the schools.<br/>

homeschooling long before John Holt did much!  They were homeschooling<br/>
in the 70s - I think most of them would have been considered hippies.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There&#39;s also a group around here (in the Santa Cruz Mountains) who were<br/>

<br/>
Santa Fe too.<br/>
<br/>
I know he knew some of the people at the Santa Fe Community School, which I <br/>
think pre-dates &quot;Teach your Own&quot; and such.  And he taught at the Rocky <br/>
Mountain School a bit, where my friend Peyton Dew went to high school.  She <br/>
lived on a ranch in Wyoming or Montana or somewhere (I forget), wintered in <br/>
Santa Fe (because the ranch would get totally socked in), and her dad was <br/>
rich.  And when she got high school age, she went for at least a couple of <br/>
years to live in a barn and learn with a small group of other rich teens <br/>
while they (teachers and students together) built other buildings.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know what became of the school.  That was late1960&#39;s; she was older than I am <br/>
by a bit.   So John Holt learned from some of the radical hippie schools out <br/>
here in New Mexico and Colorado.<br/>
<br/>
I have several friends who went to the Santa Fe Community School in the <br/>
1970&#39;s.  They were required to show up twice a week, I think, but didn&#39;t have <br/>
to stay.  They got credit for community service and projects and verbal <br/>
reports and consultations with teachers.  I have no idea about funding or <br/>
accreditation.<br/>
<br/>
Hippies were doing it quietly, but John Holt was a previously-published <br/>
author in use in college classrooms, and so when HE said &quot;let them go home,&quot; <br/>
millions of people heard that.<br/>

their kids.  That&#39;s the kind of school I always thought I would send my <br/>
kids to.  Only problem with that. . . there weren&#39;t any around or enough <br/>
interest to start them when my older kids were coming on to school age.<br/>
