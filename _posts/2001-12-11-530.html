No, you do not have to go to a school if you don&#39;t want.<br/>
No, you do not have to clean your plate if you are full.<br/>
No, you do not have to read that book if you&#39;d rather be outside playing.<br/>
<br/>
and finally (in case there&#39;s any doubt):<br/>
No, I don&#39;t like liver better than chocolate.<br/>

<br/>
Because I said so does not mean you can&#39;t find your own way of doing it.<br/>
Because I said so does not mean it&#39;s the only way of thinking.<br/>
Because I said so does not make me Queen of the Universe.<br/>
Because I said so means very little to Buddha or the IRS.<br/>

There, how&#39;s that?<br/>

P.S. BISS can stand for Because I Said So, or it can simply be the German for <br/>
a bite. I don&#39;t really want to bite my children, thanks... :^)</div>

t-shirt I got him from Florida with a picture of crocodile and the <br/>
aforementioned sentiment. :o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29291799">On my path to deciding to homeschool, I found John Rosemond.  He wrote a<br/>
book about homework.  What I got from it was to let the child take<br/>
responsibility for doing it or not doing it and let them deal with the<br/>
consequences.  Seemed like a good idea to me!  Then the teacher started<br/>
calling me, seems she thought otherwise.  It was a short road to<br/>
homeschooling and unschooling after that.<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, I know he had a lot of other ideas about what to do for kids who<br/>
&quot;won&#39;t take&quot; responsibility and get the job done but I only took what I<br/>
found useful.)<br/>
