<div id="ygrps-yiv-516918941"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I do know I have not been able to reject the Faith I was baptized <br/>
&gt;&gt;into....though I struggle with it often.  Is it in my blood?  Did <br/>
&gt;&gt;something happen at that Baptism, First Communion, Confirmation  that <br/>
&gt;&gt;changed me?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was also baptised and raised in a certain faith. I don&#39;t think the act of <br/>
baptism or confirmation itself holds any power to change a person. I believe <br/>
the power comes with all the messages given to you as a child through all <br/>
those years of going to church and being a member of that community.<br/>
<br/>
When we&#39;re brought up in a certain faith, we are told from the time we are <br/>
born, from the most influential people in our lives, that this is The Truth. <br/>
It&#39;s ingrained into our psyche. It is as real as the air we breathe or the <br/>
laws of gravity. I never even thought to ask a question for many years. It <br/>
wasn&#39;t until I had my son that I knew I had to really examine what I truly <br/>
believed. I knew that if I truly believed in the Christian dogma, I HAD to <br/>
have him baptized. I couldn&#39;t play around with his eternal soul. I thought <br/>
long and hard, read a lot, and had many meaningful discussions. He wasn&#39;t <br/>
baptized and he&#39;s not going to hell. That&#39;s My Truth. I think everyone has <br/>
to discover their own Truth.<br/>
