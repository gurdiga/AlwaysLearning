<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229984461">Hi all,<br/>
I&#39;m back!  <br/>
The UK was great and the weather was good too!  I got to see <br/>
old friends and hang out in the sidewalk cafes in Brighton, <br/>
drinking tea and chatting.  I also went to a friend&#39;s wedding at <br/>
London Zoo (definitely a fun and different place to get married <br/>
&lt;g&gt;).  I existed on curries and thai food, yum!  <br/>
Well, now I have three weeks by myself, whilst Tamzin&#39;s in the <br/>
UK with her dad.  I enjoy the solitude for awhile, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
take too long for me to miss the presence of my girl.<br/>
I&#39;ve got plenty to keep me busy while she&#39;s gone though.  <br/>
Painting a room, making new curtains, moving furniture around, <br/>
painting a bed, working on my business, and working at a <br/>
friend&#39;s home painting and plastering are just a few of the <br/>
projects I&#39;m doing while she&#39;s gone.  I&#39;m also going to a Celtic <br/>
festival in Nevada City in 2 weeks time.  <br/>
This next bit is for the resident Brits...Fairport Convention are <br/>
playing at the festival!!  I&#39;ve never seen them (but I did see <br/>
Hawkwind in SF in 1989 &lt;g&gt;).  It should be a laugh!  <br/>

Sounds like a fun trip.  I wish I could have gone.<br/>
