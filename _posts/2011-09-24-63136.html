<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548851543">From my sister-in-law who has lived in Bordeaux, France for about a quarter<br/>
century.<br/>
If anyone happens to have links of homeschooling organizations in Paris or<br/>
Bordeaux or thereabouts I would like to send them to her. Otherwise I do<br/>
think it encouraging to have positive international reporting about home<br/>
schooling.  Anyone know whether unschooling is getting a foothold  yet in<br/>
France?<br/>

&quot;You will never guess what I saw on the national news here in France the<br/>
other night.  It was a lengthy report about home schooling in the US,<br/>
including interviews with kids, with parents, all very positive.  The intro<br/>
to the report said something along the lines of &quot;We all know that things<br/>
happen in the US and eventually come here.&quot; Surprised me.  I mean, the<br/>
content was not surprising, but the fact that this positive report came to<br/>
me on the publicly funded tv channel.  Huhn.&quot;<br/>

Schuyler and I  met with some of a dozen families (some families not wholly there, some were) last summer--our American resident-in-France host family and several from local (Bretagne) and as far as Bordeaux and two from near Geneva.   Some are really doing it, some are newer to the ideas and their kids are very young.  <br/>
