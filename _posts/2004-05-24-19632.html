<div id="ygrps-yiv-558973809">Dear Heidi,  It seems to me like your child is trying to make sense of the negative images she is watching sense you say she sees it on the videos. I don&#39;t know you, however, I am wondering if it is possible that your child is crying out for some healthy boundaries and structure.   As an unschooling parent I like to follow my son&#39;s lead and support him in what he wishes to learn, however, at the same time it is still my job to protect hime, set healthy boundaries and provide a structure that supports his natural unfolding. I will censor the videos he watches until he is emotionally mature enough to handle the content, because early exposure has proven to cause distress in children.  Just talking about the content is not enough when the child is not emotinally mature enough to handle the content.  I will choose developmentally appropriate books, activities, etc... until such an age when he is emotionally mature enough to make those decisions himself.  This, i believe will occur in<br/>
 incremental steps, and be a wonderful learning experience for him.  It is not impeding his learning, nor dictating what he can or can not discuss, it is protecting him so that he is not overwhelmed so much that no real learning can take place. The difficulty is that  many of us (me) have experienced controlling boundaries growing up, that weren&#39;t boundaries at all, but rigid walls, rules that were dictator like rather than an obviously keeping us safe and secure.  Choosing the exact opposite of what we may have experience as a child is a reaction, and not really a choice at all, since it is so linked to our parent&#39;s behaviour.As a counselor i have often seen a swing in parenting styles from parents who grew up with too rigid boundaries in turn have little or no boundaries for their children.  Yet healthy structure and boundaries is an innate need of all children, and if they are not there the child tries to punish themselves, or expresses their distress in some other way. <br/>
 Inadequate boundaries leaves the child not knowing what is and is not safe, they don&#39;t know where the parent actually is, and that is a scary feeling.I have also witnessed that some kids need more structure than others in order for their day to go smoothly.  Unschooling, again, doesn&#39;t in my  opinion rule out structure in the day.  It is child centered, so it means understanding the specific needs of the individual child and then providing the support, nurturing and structure that best allows the child to grow in his own way.Like i said, I don&#39;t know if this is what is going on for you and your family,  but just in case my thoughts are helpful I thought i would share them with you.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone ever chooses &quot;the exact opposite&quot; in all things.<br/>
<br/>
Most people choose &quot;exact same&quot; by having the same table rules and the same <br/>
bedtime and the same spanking routines they grew up with.<br/>
<br/>
In another large group, people might be reactionary and reject things without <br/>
replacing them with something else thoughtfully chosen.<br/>
<br/>
But with unschooling it&#39;s neither of those things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1263378551">Thank you, Mary.  We have changed our lifestyle since becoming <br/>
unschoolers, but not to a point of outright unparenting, which is what I <br/>
suspect you read into it.  My comment on her perhaps picking up violence <br/>
from movies was based on movies like Sinbad and other cartoon-types <br/>
where someone gets killed.  Perhaps she&#39;s not ready for these things, <br/>
but she is interested in watching them and I feel it would be more <br/>
harmful to forbid these things than to let her watch.  <br/>
<br/>
Mostly, she hurts herself or threatens to when she doesn&#39;t get her way. <br/>
 An example would be if I don&#39;t do what she asked at just that moment, <br/>
she threatens to hurt herself.  If I get after her for doing something <br/>
inapproriate to one of her sisters, she may threaten to kill herself. <br/>
 In reading that, you may think she&#39;s just spoiled.  The worry then is <br/>
sometimes she actually will hurt herself.  Then older she gets, there <br/>
are more ways she can hurt herself.  I can&#39;t always do as she demands. <br/>
 I can&#39;t punish her for hurting herself.  I haven&#39;e been able to stop <br/>
her from hurting herself.  I have thought long and hard about what to do <br/>
to help her learn to deal with impatience, anger, and frustration.  It <br/>
could be just a stage she&#39;s going through at 3 1/2.  What really bothers <br/>
me is that she&#39;s been hurting herself since about 18 months.  It <br/>
definitely wasn&#39;t from watching movies and tv then.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve began a new strategy.  It&#39;s rather extreme and I really don&#39;t <br/>
know if it&#39;s the &quot;right&quot; thing to do...but she hasn&#39;t hurt herself in <br/>
over two weeks.  It began like this:  After one episode where she was <br/>
yanking her hair and threatening to run out in the street to get hit by <br/>
a car, I say her on my lap and said that I loved her.  That every time <br/>
she got hurt, it hurt me because I love her so much.  I told her that I <br/>
gave birth to her out of my tummy because I wanted her to be alive and <br/>
to be happy.  Then I told her that because she couldn&#39;t see how much it <br/>
hurt me when she hurt herself, I would show her.  From then on, whenever <br/>
she hurt herself, I would do the same thing to myself.  And I have.  The <br/>
last time she&#39;s hurt herself was at this computer.  She was upset <br/>
because the game she was playing was too hard so she began to slam her <br/>
knee on the edge of the desk.  So I did the same.  I ended up cutting my <br/>
knee in two places and making a huge bruise.  I know this sounds awful <br/>
and very dramatic and I guess it is.  But it made a huge impression on <br/>
her.  She was very upset to see her mommy hurt.  I told her that&#39;s how <br/>
upset I feel when she hurts herself.  <br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if this is the right thing to do.  But it&#39;s all I could <br/>
think of.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your insights.  Heidi<br/>

awful lot of power and responsibility to put on one little person - the<br/>

hurting yourself, which is exactly what you *don&#39;t* want her to do. It<br/>

longer-term implications.<br/>
<br/>
Rain at that age would very occasionally do or say something<br/>
self-destructive, but she was more focused outward. I was physically<br/>
self-destructive for years, though, and then later I worked in the mental<br/>
health field with people who were physically self-destructive, and then<br/>
even later I taught kids with emotional and behavioral disorders, some of<br/>
whom would do self-destructive acts. What worked, in all cases, was to<br/>
physically prevent self-destructive acts (when possible), while telling<br/>
the person that you wouldn&#39;t permit anyone to hurt her while you were<br/>
around because you cared about her and didn&#39;t want her to be hurt... and<br/>
then refocus on resolving the issue at hand, the issue that triggered the<br/>
self-destructiveness. It was important to stay very low-key and matter of<br/>
fact, and to make it clear that you were emotionally  strong enough to<br/>
handle things. What made it worse was flipping out and yelling and<br/>
getting emotional... which I know is harder than it sounds, especially<br/>
with your own child, but it&#39;s important.<br/>
<br/>
This may not work as quickly as what you&#39;re doing, but I think it&#39;s a<br/>
better soloution in the long run.<br/>

In the first year of marriage, I went through some pretty tough stuff <br/>
with my dh and I found myself at times scratching my arms up or <br/>
something similar. For me it was about feeling out of control. I <br/>
didn&#39;t know whether I had a right to feel the way I did and whether I <br/>
was the problem in our marriage and when I reached a point of huge <br/>
emotional confusion (usually after an argument)I would hurt myself <br/>
because at least I knew that I was responsible for *this* pain. I <br/>
think too that it was a way of punishing myself and if I did this <br/>
then Mark wouldn&#39;t feel the need to continue to make me feel bad. I <br/>
know that if someone had done to me what Dar is suggesting, I would <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-337750393">Julie, I&#39;m sorry to hear you went through such a bad time.  You say that <br/>
the times you hurt yourself were times when you were hurting emotionally <br/>
and struggling for some kind of control.  I see this in my daughter. <br/>
 She&#39;s trying very hard to control her situations and the people <br/>
involved.  So many people tell me how amazed they are at her vocabulary <br/>
for her age, but I think that for her, it&#39;s not enough.  She has two <br/>
older sisters who do everything together and one younger one who is just <br/>
starting to play with others, so essentially she&#39;s a middle child.  I <br/>
think she&#39;s feeling a great deal of frustration about this.  I do hope <br/>
that as my youngest gets older, these two girls will be as close as the <br/>
older two.  Perhaps then my dd won&#39;t feel so alone.  I also think she&#39;s <br/>
a person who will always have extremely high expectations of herself.  I <br/>
would just like to help guide her in setting her high goals while being <br/>
patient with herself to attain them.  Right now, she feels that if her <br/>
older sisters can do it easily, why can&#39;t she.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your thoughts on this.  I hope things are better for you <br/>
now.  Sincerely,  Heidi<br/>

They were lecturing me and I was suddenly 14 again and felt sooooo out of control. I honestly had no idea what I had done until later whan Jason saw my legs and asked me what had happened. <br/>

I still feel out of control when we have these meetings with my dad. But now, Jason holds my hand and lets me squeeze his hand and will gentley squeeze back.<br/>
