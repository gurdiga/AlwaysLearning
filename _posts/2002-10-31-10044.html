<br/>
Hello <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a>,<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve been invited to join the Pentecostal-homeschool group<br/>
hosted by Yahoo! Groups, a free, easy-to-use community service.<br/>
By joining Pentecostal-homeschool, you will be able to exchange<br/>
messages with other group members, store photos and files, <br/>
coordinate events and more.<br/>
<br/>
This invitation will expire in 7 days.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an introductory message from the group moderator:<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hello Fellow Homeschooler,<br/>
<br/>
We wish to extend an invitation to join our homeschooling community.<br/>
<br/>
Pentecostal Homeschool is a community of Apostolic-minded parents who have a <br/>
passion for creating a powerful Christ-centered learning environment for <br/>
their children within their homes. WOW what a responsibility!<br/>
<br/>
This community is for those who currently homeschool their children, or are <br/>
considering doing so in the future. Discussions are centered around <br/>
homeschooling and can include lesson plans, activities, links to homeschool <br/>
related articles and subject matter. Post homeschool-related links, pass on <br/>
an idea, share a Bible lesson, outline a family night, offer a lesson plan <br/>
that teaches English, social studies, art, math or any subject vital to <br/>
creating a strong homeschooling environment.<br/>
<br/>
We do wish you would come and add value to our community.<br/>
<br/>
Doug Constant<br/>
  (&#92;o/)<br/>

<br/>
Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Dodd.<br/>
She is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored,<br/>
She has loosed the fateful lightening of Her terrible swift sword <br/>
Her truth is marching on.<br/>
<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Her truth is marching on. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have seen Her in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps <br/>
They have builded Her an altar in the evening dews and damps <br/>
l can read Her righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps <br/>
Her day is marching on. <br/>
<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Her truth is marching on. <br/>
<br/>
I have read a fiery gospel writ in burnish`d rows of steel, <br/>
&quot;As ye deal with my contemners, So with you my grace shall deal;&quot; <br/>
Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with her heel <br/>
Since Dodd is marching on. <br/>
<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Her truth is marching on. <br/>
<br/>
She has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat <br/>
She is sifting out the hearts of men before Her judgment-seat <br/>
Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Her! Be jubilant, my feet! <br/>
Our Dodd is marching on.<br/>
<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Her truth is marching on. <br/>
<br/>
In the beauty of the lilies Sandra was born across the sea, <br/>
With a glory in Her bosom that transfigures you and me: <br/>
As She died to make men holy, let us die to make men free, <br/>
While Dodd is marching on.<br/>
<br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Glory! Glory! Hallelujah! <br/>
Her truth is marching on. <br/>

For some reason people keep trying to *save me*. I get signed up <br/>

I dunno what it is. Its not like I&#39;m an athiest. I&#39;m openly pagan.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wouldn&#39;t it though!?  I&#39;ll eat cookies to honor their Christian God <br/>
with them, no problem.  I believe all aspects are part of the One <br/>
anyhow, honoring the head should not stifle or offend the heart, or <br/>
honoring the knee offend the foot.  I am with you Shyrley, but I <br/>
didn&#39;t know you were pagan too girl!  I guess we all have a healthy <br/>
doses of free thinking in all our facets, whether they be faith, <br/>
education, parenting, whatever...<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t usually try to save me though.  You must be more gentle <br/>
than me or something.  The general reaction I get is the hissing, <br/>
spitting &quot;GET THEE BACK!&quot; kind.  People are all friendly right off, <br/>
but then when they get to know me, they start denouncing me and <br/>
spreading gossip all over the place.  Good thing I care not one whit <br/>
what stupid and bigotted people think of me huh?  You would think I <br/>
was flamboyant or something, but I think I am rather boring.  Maybe <br/>
it&#39;s that my plain demeanor and looks are deceptive, and when they <br/>
scratch the surface they get something wholly unexpected.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The hymn, although meant in fun, is perilously close to what Sandra <br/>
says.  Christian Hymns and prayers are as much spells as any pagan <br/>
verse.  We create our own reality by what we believe.  Naming a thing <br/>
may make it so, if belief is strong enough.  Even the staunchest <br/>
skeptic knows that the human mind is capable of defying &quot;known&quot; <br/>
reality, even of cheating death, where the will is strong.  I would <br/>
have a care for how you build an ediface of words around Sandra that <br/>
even she cannot force her own reality through.  Don&#39;t cheat her of <br/>
her desired destiny by imposing another on her.<br/>
<br/>
Here Sandra, this is a blessing I wrote for you, from my faith, to <br/>
yours;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra be like the earth,<br/>
Strong in mind and body,<br/>
Green and full of life.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra be like the wind,<br/>
Carry your message where you will,<br/>
Remaining ever free and light of heart.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra be like the fire,<br/>
Your will the flame fed by love,<br/>
Warming those around you.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra be like the water,<br/>
Your tide swirling in power,<br/>
Is also the gentle wash of life.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra be of your Spirit,<br/>
More than the sum of your parts,<br/>
Defined by no measure but your own.<br/>

sometimes too blunt, I offend people with my sense of humor, and make <br/>
people nervous.  I make no secret of my opinions and suffer no fools <br/>
lightly.  I don&#39;t take crap from people either.  I think it is the <br/>
purely physical aspects.  I have nothing to alert them, and they <br/>
think me an innocuous homemaker and mom, most likely Christian.  <br/>
Plain brown med length straight hair, jeans most often, with sewaters <br/>
or t-shirts, etc, brown eyes, and this &quot;Doe in the headlights&quot; <br/>
innocent irish look that is genetic, no piercings, no tatoos, no <br/>
dyes, no makeup.  I&#39;m just a country gal at heart.  <br/>
<br/>
We had friends who for two years thought we were fundamental <br/>
Christians because we homeschool.  How they laughed at themselves <br/>
when they found out we were pagan!<br/>

That was very strengthening and inspiring.  Thank you very much.<br/>
<br/>
I cleaned the fireplace!!  I have cleaned the fireplace before, but not with <br/>
one leg in a cast.  I&#39;m very happy to have done something actually useful <br/>
today.<br/>
<br/>
And tomorrow I&#39;m taking an elaborate spongebath in front of the clean <br/>
fireplace, with a fire.  It&#39;s not a good time of year to be nekkid and wet <br/>
here. <br/>
<br/>
Trick or treating is just about to commence.  Our house was the meeting place <br/>
for Marty&#39;s friends, and they&#39;re taking Holly and her friend Jasmine to cover <br/>
for them.  &quot;I&#39;m going with my little sister!&quot; they can say, when it takes <br/>
seven costumed teenagers to accompany two younger girls.<br/>
<br/>
Keith my husband is out in the driveway, dressed kind of as Pan.  I think <br/>
there was a photo of him in this costume in some of the photos I took to pass <br/>
around in South Carolina.  There&#39;s a helm with deer horns, and fur trim in a <br/>
pattern on it, a set of pan pipes hanging around his neck, big furry legs, <br/>
and little hooves.  The hooves I&#39;m particularly proud of.  It&#39;s a pair of <br/>
clogs with the heels cut off, and the tops painted to look more hoof-like.  <br/>
So he goes clomping around on his toes looking taller (and crazier) than <br/>
usual.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about stationing me at the door to distribute.  Me in a <br/>
wheelchair on a landing about twice as big as a wheelchair.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re giving away candy (small chocolate bars, Kit Kat and Almond Joy and <br/>
suchlike), jokes with illustrations (something I made years ago, and Holly <br/>
found the stash of them, rolled up in little scrolls) and Halloween pencils I <br/>
got at a thrift store once.  LOTS.<br/>
<br/>
The jokes I will put in another e-mail.<br/>

Apparently I do!<br/>
Lying in a hospital (people, I say a BAPTIST hospital) for days while others <br/>
talk about unschooling JUST so that the hotel will refund the organizer the <br/>
price of my airfare, if that ain&#39;t martyrism, what would be?<br/>
<br/>
Next conference I attend, I shall endeavor to pointedly NOT spill gasoline on <br/>
myself and walk outside where the smokers are assembled to ask if they know <br/>
what would take that gasoline out of my fancy new HOMESCHOOLING t-shirt.<br/>

&gt; &gt; People don&#39;t usually try to save me though.  You must be more gentle<br/>
&gt; &gt; than me or something.  The general reaction I get is the hissing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; spitting &quot;GET THEE BACK!&quot; kind.  People are all friendly right off,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but then when they get to know me, they start denouncing me and<br/>
&gt; &gt; spreading gossip all over the place.  Good thing I care not one whit<br/>
&gt; &gt; what stupid and bigotted people think of me huh?  You would think I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was flamboyant or something, but I think I am rather boring.  Maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; it&#39;s that my plain demeanor and looks are deceptive, and when they<br/>
&gt; &gt; scratch the surface they get something wholly unexpected.<br/>

&gt;  Gentle!!!!!!!! Har har har.<br/>
&gt; You know me....&#39;Have opinion, will rant!&#39; is my motto.<br/>
&gt; I think I make people nervous sometimes cos I am pretty blunt. <br/>
&gt; That and my spiky hair, weird clothes and funny accent.<br/>
&gt; I also dunt take no crap from no-one and I have a sense of humour <br/>
&gt; that offends a lot of people &lt;EG&gt;<br/>
