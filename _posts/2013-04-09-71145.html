<div id="ygrps-yiv-169553351">I&#39;m bringing something from Facebook, because it&#39;s worth looking at again, maybe.  The first part is Cara Barlow, then me.<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told, directly and indirectly, over the past few weeks that I&#39;m expecting too much from members of the local unschooling groups I moderate. I have this weird idea that if you voluntarily join an unschooling group or email list, that you&#39;re interested in learning more about unschooling and honing your unschooling skills. Sigh.<br/>

Sandra Dodd -=- I have this weird idea that if you voluntarily join an unschooling group or email list, that you&#39;re interested in learning more about unschooling and honing your unschooling skills.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I used to think that too!! <br/>
And I still act like I think it. For many people it&#39;s true, and those are my target audience, and honored guests.<br/>
<br/>
It turns out some are there because they&#39;re superstitious. Some are emotionally needy (not a crime). Some are mean and want to cause trouble for fun.<br/>
<br/>
The superstitious ones think there is magic in touching a statue or a medal, or in &quot;joining&quot; an unschooling group. It&#39;s like touching holy water and thinking that&#39;s the same as being a good Catholic; like buying a prayer shawl, and thinking it&#39;s the same as praying and studying; like owning a statue of Buddha and thinking that makes them a Buddhist nun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not religious. The analogies don&#39;t mean this is a religion. It means there is a depth of understanding, and a practice of many years, that make unschooling work well. Joining a group, or subscribing to a magazine, or going to a conference (or a dozen conferences) isn&#39;t what it&#39;s about. Unschooling lives (is alive; breathes; functions) where the learning is happening. The learning is supported and fed by the relationships between the parents and chidren.<br/>
<br/>
If I have a big woodpile, I don&#39;t have a fire. Even if I have a fireplace and matches and bellows and kindling and firestarters and a fire extinguisher and the chimney was just cleaned and inspected and I have a paper saying &quot;good to go,&quot; I don&#39;t have a fire. Would wrought-iron fire tools on a cool rack help? What about a stained-glass fireplace screen, so no sparks can get out on the floor? I could subscribe to magazines for fireplace owners. I could join a yahoo group and a facebook page to talk about fires. I could be receiving catalogs with all kinds of fancy flameproof rugs and indoor wood racks and really cool slings for carrying wood in, and Ooh! What about a beautiful mantle?<br/>
<br/>
Still no fire.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, the neighbors might have build a real, operating fire, in a little hole they dug and lined with scrap bricks or rocks, with wood they found in a vacant lot, and kindled it with old receipts and fast-food wrappers they found blown into the alley. Their fire has heat, their fire has light, if they&#39;re sitting around it talking and laughing, they have the benefit of the fire.<br/>
<br/>
Some people want to look like they&#39;re interested and that they intend to hone their skills, but they don&#39;t actually want to do it, if it&#39;s going to involve any real combustion or change in them.</div>

<br/>
Local groups are more often social or support groups and people absolutely expect that kind of focus. If you want something focused on learning about unschooling on a local level, you might do better with a book club or study group.<br/>
<br/>
It might also help to clarify whether the group is intended to be inclusive or not. The &quot;not&quot; option is harder to express in ways that don&#39;t offend people, but it&#39;s really important to be up front about that. Not all groups Have To be inclusive - and one of the sources of friction within groups comes from differences of opinion as to whether the group is specifically inclusive, or intended to meet a narrower range of needs and interests. <br/>

International groups are more often social and support groups than not, too. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Some people expect that chit-chat teaparty nicety and fluff in ANY group and every group.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling groups can include people in widely varying stages of<br/>
unschooling and people who are not radical unschoolers and I don&#39;t think<br/>
that being on a local group email list is an invitation to others on that<br/>
list to critique my parenting or unschooling. A local list is more often<br/>
for planning activities, making announcements, and discussing how things<br/>
are going at park days or other get-togethers. It can even include people<br/>
who aren&#39;t unschooling, but like to hang out with unschoolers. My local<br/>
unschooling group has always had the policy that everybody is welcome but<br/>
they have to be a good &quot;fit&quot; - we wouldn&#39;t tolerate people who are too<br/>
harsh with their children or who spoke disparagingly about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I would say if you want an actual unschooling discussion list with local<br/>
people - start that as a separate list and you write the description and be<br/>
very very clear that it is your list and you are setting the tone from the<br/>
beginning. I think the alwayslearning type of discussion list would be<br/>
difficult to do at a local level - people will get their feelings hurt.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782583081">I love the analogy about the fire. I guess you could say we have a big collection of fire making stuff and just a little ember in the bottom of the fireplace.  No real light or warmth from our fire yet.  It just needs to be nurtured a little longer, given some air and some more fuel.  We are working on this as a family even though it&#39;s a big learning curve for us (my kids are teens). I&#39;ve learned so much from reading this list and made some pretty drastic (for me) changes in my thinking and actions toward learning and parenting. Thank you for your honest sharing.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072300065">I absolutely agree about the support aspect of local groups if by local<br/>
that means a group of people who are within a small geographic area who get<br/>
together socially.<br/>
<br/>
If the group is statewide or regional and is clearly identified clearly as<br/>
a group for people who are unschooling or those interested in unschooling,<br/>
I think it&#39;s appropriate for the moderator say something to the effect of<br/>
&quot;hey, wait a minute&quot; when a post shows up that isn&#39;t unschooling-friendly<br/>
or is unclear.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s almost like the statewide and regional lists I&#39;m moderating with are<br/>
at a midpoint between a small social support group and what goes on here.<br/>
There are people meeting each other and arranging social events and sharing<br/>
opportunities, but there are also people asking for help on how to get<br/>
started unschooling, and myself and others sharing links to articles or<br/>
blogs about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t experienced people criticizing other&#39;s parenting, but we have had<br/>
discussions about articles and links that I&#39;ve posted - the latest one that<br/>
started a discussion was a Pam Laricchia quote about unschooling being<br/>
hard. Someone, who I don&#39;t think is unschooling but is considering it,<br/>
 posted in response that unschooling wasn&#39;t hard, it was &quot;just living<br/>
life.&quot; That gave me a &quot;hey, wait a minute&quot; moment, I wrote a response, and<br/>
the discussion went on.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of interest in unschooling in the homeschool community and<br/>
some people cherry-pick the parts of unschooling that fit their lives. One<br/>
of the  local-to-me general homeschooling groups recently offered a seminar<br/>
called &quot;Unschooling for Uptight Parents&quot; The presenter was admittedly not<br/>
an unschooler and never had been.<br/>
<br/>
In a sense I feel like I need to be *more* clear about unschooling if<br/>
there&#39;s a largish contingent of relaxed homeschoolers reading. I feel like<br/>
I have a responsibility to offer good information. I suspect that members<br/>
who feel like I&#39;m expecting too much probably aren&#39;t comfortable with me<br/>
pointing out when a post is getting too far afield or is confusing. And<br/>
yes, it&#39;s my idea of what&#39;s too far afield or confusing :-)<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>

<br/>
If someone says something entirely wrong or disparaging about unschooling, I defend myself.  Having unschooled three real people, for real, I resent people know know less suggesting that what I did was really nothing.<br/>
<br/>
Someone said something rude about unschooling on a statewide list here�a list I myself created and maintained in a neutral fashion.  I never even had a link by my name.  I didn&#39;t write about unschooling there.   One day, though, it went into anti-unschooling crap and I responded, and people hooted back, and I left.  Gave the list to someone else and left, because that&#39;s bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
And the group died.  Because they were smart enough to think it was okay to insult unschoolers, but not smart enough, apparently, to maintain a yahoogroup.  I was pretty disgusted with them, but I hope their kids grew up happy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-316937720">I sometimes talk about these kinds of unschooling perception issues<br/>
with Jayn (13).<br/>
<br/>
She said unschooling is like a white tube sock. The sock is the same<br/>
but the shape changes to fit all the different feet.<br/>
<br/>
I rather like the analogy.<br/>
