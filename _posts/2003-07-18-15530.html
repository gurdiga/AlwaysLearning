Hi, been reading for awhile, haven&#39;t posted yet. I read this and had a<br/>
memory flash. Have to share.<br/>
I was on the toilet and...  the phone rang. My son who was then 3 decided he<br/>
would answer it. I called out not to bother but I heard him dragging a chair<br/>
across the room towards the phone. I sat there helplessly and listened to<br/>
him answer the phone and tell the person that &quot;Mummy can&#39;t come to the phone<br/>
coz she&#39;s doing a poo!&quot; Aagghh!!!!! He came in a few minutes later to tell<br/>
me it was Noni (my mum). I called her when I could and she answered the<br/>
phone crying from laughter. Phew!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Julie by the way, mum to three amazing kids. I&#39;m in Australia.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135299166">Hi Julie.  Oh have I ever been there!  Only with me it was my fil!  I never got<br/>
up the courage to call him back and thank goodness, he acted like it never<br/>
happened.  I think he may have been more embarrassed than me.  HeidiC.<br/>
