<div id="ygrps-yiv-850675867">I used to have real visceral judgemental attitudes<br/>
about kid&#39;s programming which I thought was &quot;stupid.&quot; <br/>
I tried not to let on to my kids what I thought<br/>
mostly.  I&#39;ve learned it&#39;s not important enough to get<br/>
worked up about, and that my opinion is only that, no<br/>
more valid than theirs.  My parents were and are still<br/>
very judgemental and sanctimonious so my &quot;defaults&quot;<br/>
were set there I guess.<br/>
<br/>
My boys just recently discovered the Power Rangers<br/>
movies, being somewhat emotionally and developmentall<br/>
&quot;young&quot; for their ages.  Some of them are pretty bad,<br/>
as in bad acting, bad writing, bad directing, bad<br/>
editing, cheesy effects.  Some of them are not half<br/>
bad though.  The boys are savvy enough movie viewers<br/>
to pick up on the bad/cheesy/poor quality stuff all by<br/>
themselves and we have quite a lot of fun laughing<br/>
together about characters falling 1000 feet screaming<br/>
only to dust themselves off without a scratch and then<br/>
later tripping and breaking their arm or whatever. <br/>
The boys like to go back and watch particularly funny<br/>
things again and again, laughing every time. <br/>
<br/>
Just like the scene in Kung Pow (a favorite here)<br/>
where Steve Odekirk is making fun of poor continuity<br/>
between scenes with costuming and Evil Betty says &quot;I<br/>
am a great magician!  You&#39;re clothes are Red!&quot;  then<br/>
later &quot;Your clothes are blue!&quot; and so forth - there<br/>
are similar things in some of the Power Ranger shows<br/>
where we laugh about the magic hat that repeatedly<br/>
disappears and reappears, or the &quot;Power Ranger Magic<br/>
Shiny Pants&quot; that repel dirt and inexplicably go from<br/>
filthy to sparkling so often.  All this seems to<br/>
enhance their pleasure and enjoyment of their movies.<br/>
<br/>
The kids are intelligent enough and experienced enough<br/>
as movie viewers to pick up on that stuff and enjoy<br/>
noticing it, and I can put aside my dislike to be<br/>
respectful about their choices as well as being honest<br/>
about things that are well done, well acted or<br/>
scripted and so on.<br/>
