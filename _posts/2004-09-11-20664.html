<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832764611">Below is the response I got today from Helen at HEM.  I had sent an email<br/>
stating my concern about the removal of Sandra&#39;s column, not so much<br/>
specific to Sandra but to the loss of what I saw as the only &#39;unschooling&#39;<br/>
piece in the magazine.   In the response, she asks that it be posted to<br/>
share the &#39;information&#39;.   I have some pretty strong feelings about what<br/>
she has written here but will let everyone else form their own opinions :) <br/>
Sorry if this is a repeat for anyone.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hello Anna,<br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s the reply I sent in response to another person&#39;s letter this morning:<br/>
 <br/>
Hello &lt;name withheld&gt;,<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for taking the time to write and share your concerns with me. <br/>
A number of people have written about the same concerns, but I&#39;ve <br/>
been very busy with family matters these last few weeks and have not <br/>
had a chance to respond to anyone until now. If you have the <br/>
opportunity - via discussion lists, message boards or other forums - <br/>
perhaps you could share my reply here with others who are concerned <br/>
about the changes we&#39;ve made at HEM regarding Sandra Dodd. It&#39;s not <br/>
necessary, of course, and I&#39;ll be trying to find those who wrote <br/>
earlier and reply to them directly, but their contact information may <br/>
be lost to me by now.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I share your disappointment about Sandra&#39;s column no longer <br/>
appearing in Home Education Magazine. I&#39;ve always loved the wonderful <br/>
way Sandra could put words together to convey a thought or an idea or <br/>
a concept - that&#39;s why she was selected to be an HEM columnist in the <br/>
first place. Her writing has a special quality, a clarity of purpose <br/>
and a way of making the reader feel as though they, too, can do all <br/>
the wonderful things she writes about doing, whether it&#39;s making math <br/>
simple and easy to understand or sharing music with her kids and <br/>
friends and family or just enjoying the simple wonderfulness of <br/>
watching her children figure things out for themselves. She could <br/>
write it all down in a way that made you feel like you could do all <br/>
of that and more with your own kids. Her writing is clean, pure, and <br/>
honest, and those qualities do not come through in everyone&#39;s writing <br/>
like they come through in hers. If it was ONLY about the writing, I&#39;m <br/>
certain that Sandra would still be writing for HEM, but her writing <br/>
was only a small part of a much larger situation which led to our <br/>
making the decisions we made.<br/>
 <br/>
As I understand it there has always been plenty of Sandra&#39;s writing <br/>
available online, not only at her own website but at many other <br/>
sites, forums, discussion lists, and in books and magazines. I don&#39;t <br/>
think her absence in HEM will be much noticed by those who want to <br/>
read her writing, as I believe she wrote far more for other venues <br/>
than she ever wrote for our bimonthly magazine. She&#39;s a very prolific <br/>
writer and a tireless advocate on the lists and forums. In that <br/>
respect, HEM was never much of a source for those who wanted to <br/>
benefit from her writing and discussions.<br/>
 <br/>
At the same time, it has struck those of us here at HEM as odd that <br/>
people think there has been some significant change in the magazine. <br/>
Almost everyone associated with HEM - the publishers, editors, <br/>
writers, columnists, office staff and various others - are all <br/>
unschoolers at heart, all believe pretty much the same kinds of <br/>
things Sandra has written about and promoted, and have always worked <br/>
hard to share the unschooling philosophy with our readers. The odd <br/>
attitude that Sandra&#39;s column was the only thing worth reading in HEM <br/>
and it&#39;s not worth subscribing if she&#39;s not going to be writing for <br/>
it is a somewhat bizarre revelation to us - and it tells us all that <br/>
this is much more about Sandra&#39;s faithful followers defending some <br/>
perceived wrongdoing than about anything truly relating to our <br/>
magazine. That also strikes us as bizarre because we&#39;ve always <br/>
thought true unschooling was about finding one&#39;s own path and not <br/>
simply dogging someone else&#39;s footsteps to learn.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve always loved what John Holt had to say about that concept: That <br/>
true leaders don&#39;t look around to see who&#39;s following them, they <br/>
simply move ahead doing what they think is right and good and in <br/>
doing so they empower others to do the same for themselves. That&#39;s <br/>
what we&#39;ve been doing at HEM for over 20 years, and it&#39;s what we&#39;ll <br/>
continue to do for the next 20.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks again for writing,<br/>
Helen<br/>

So:<br/>
<br/>
We love Sandra BUT we&#39;re firing her anyway.<br/>
We agree with everything she says BUT we&#39;re firing her anyway.<br/>
If you have a problem with the content of the magazine you must just be one<br/>
of her unthinking followers, so who needs you.<br/>
You are too dumb and brainwashed by her to see that the rest of us are<br/>
better Unschoolers anyway.<br/>
<br/>
And then the back handed zinger:<br/>

<br/>
Sandra isn&#39;t a &quot;true&quot; leader because she must want followers.<br/>
<br/>
I notice they don&#39;t say anything about promoting Unschooling in the next 20<br/>
years, just what they think is right.<br/>
<br/>
Does Helen realize the above meanings can be read into her letter? I can&#39;t<br/>
believe someone who has published a magazine of this long standing could be<br/>
writing unintentionally or be oblivious to the insulting tone.<br/>
<br/>
Well I have never subscribed to HEM, because from the odd copy I have<br/>
perused it did look like it was trying to cast too broad a net of general<br/>
Home Schooling, and I was interested in Radical Unschooling. Actually the<br/>
point they make that Sandra has a lot published on the web is true. However<br/>
not everyone who reads HEM is necessarily on line a lot, and now new<br/>
subscribers won&#39;t even hear her name in that publication or about her<br/>
website. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth to feel like they resent her<br/>
popularity on line. <br/>
<br/>
There is clearly more to be revealed in the message boards situation too.<br/>
Hmmmm. :/<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing that Anna.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41734437">Well,  I guess I was the &lt;name withheld&gt;,  cuz I got the letter.  Some others may have too,  I suppose.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s what I wrote so you can see Helen&#39;s contradictions as loud and clear as I have.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
***********************************  <br/>
 <br/>
Dear Helen Hegener, I was really disappointed to see that Sandra Dodd was not in the latest issue of your magazine. As an unschooling mom,  I really felt a connection with that column and now..... not much there for me. With the other articles and columns in HEM,  I would be thinking,  &quot;yeah, this is kind-of like me&quot;.  But they were never on target.   They were either too controlling or too schooly.   The reason I started home educating my children was to get away from that.  That didn&#39;t work so why would I replicate that? Sandra&#39;s column was like a breath of fresh air.  It really spoke to me in a way that the others never did.   I saw that Sandra&#39;s focus was her children and their relationship.  Not what her children needed to know.  The focus wasn&#39;t on what the parent thought the child should learn, it was on what the child thought he or she should learn.  Isn&#39;t that how we all learn best anyway?  When we&#39;re doing what we want,  when we&#39;re following our own passions and dreams?   I<br/>
 don&#39;t see that in the other articles/columns.  I&#39;m sorry to see your magazine going in this direction. I won&#39;t be renewing my subscription.  Kelli Traaseth,  unschooling mom to 3<br/>
*****************************************************<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know HEM wasn&#39;t ever very &#39;unschooly&#39; but it sometimes had unschooling articles and then it had Sandra&#39;s column.   I looked forward to those.   <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Previously, Helen has made claims that she wants to try and unify the home educating population.    Obviously,  she doesn&#39;t want to include unschooling (or our definition of unschooling) in that population.   To me,  she has just divided the home educating community even more.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The more and more I thought about it,  and after discussing it with Sandra too,  I&#39;m fine in missing the magazine.   Like I said there wasn&#39;t much there for me anyway.  But now the masses are missing out on it too.   That&#39;s one big thing that made me sad.<br/>
<br/>

Hello Anna,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the reply I sent in response to another person&#39;s letter this morning:<br/>
<br/>
Hello &lt;name withheld&gt;,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to write and share your concerns with me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-417696142">Helen&#39;s MO is to try to agree with everyone while trying to undermine<br/>
certain unschoolers with innuendo.   <br/>
I&#39;m insulted and offended, not to mention, plain sick of her.    But<br/>
then, it&#39;s easy for me to say what I mean because I&#39;m not trying to sell<br/>
magazine subscriptions and I&#39;m not selling advertising space to<br/>
curriculum providers.  I don&#39;t have to try to be all things to all<br/>
people. <br/>

not everyone who reads HEM is necessarily on line a lot,  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
That is so true and what I think HEM will be missing.  I know when we  first <br/>
considered homeschooling here in NC, I didn&#39;t have to register with the  state <br/>
until my oldest was 7 so I really didn&#39;t think about it until then.   But at <br/>
that point DH and I had decided that we didn&#39;t want to change anything  about <br/>
our lives, no curriculum, no school-at-home etc.  We wanted to  continue <br/>
living life. <br/>
 <br/>
I was at that time reading HEM and was so drawn to Sandra&#39;s column.   And <br/>
that was all I knew about her.  I was not on any yahoo lists and had  never seen <br/>
her web site.  Wasn&#39;t really online much at all.  But when  I started <br/>
searching the Internet and ran across Kelly&#39;s site for the SOS group  and saw the Live <br/>
and Learn Conference (of course I didn&#39;t know it was the first  one..LOL) <br/>
that was what I saw, Sandra.  I told Jackson, DH, that I didn&#39;t  know any <br/>
unschoolers, and didn&#39;t know anyone going to the conference, but I did  recognize <br/>
Sandra&#39;s name from HEM.  We talked about going and took the  plunge and had a <br/>
great time and came away knowing that we were unschoolers, it  had a name and <br/>
from there I went online and joined lists, etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Now some 3 years later I have the North Carolina Unschoolers list and web  <br/>
site and plan get togethers for unschoolers all the time.  It has really  snow <br/>
balled but it started with HEM and the little SOS group.<br/>
 <br/>
I am not sure Helen realizes how many people were affected by that  column.  <br/>
It is not just people searching for writings by Sandra.  But  maybe Helen does <br/>
realize that and it is not the slant that HEM wants to  take.  Anyway it is a <br/>
loss for the unschooling community but maybe the Live  Free Learn Free <br/>
magazine will fill that a little.  I loved the first issue  of LFLF.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1376076003"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve always loved what John Holt had to say about that concept: That<br/>
&gt;&gt; true leaders don&#39;t look around to see who&#39;s following them, they<br/>
&gt;&gt; simply move ahead doing what they think is right and good and in<br/>
&gt;&gt; doing so they empower others to do the same for themselves. That&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt; what we&#39;ve been doing at HEM for over 20 years, and it&#39;s what we&#39;ll<br/>
&gt;&gt; continue to do for the next 20.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is so sad... what a great idea and how frustrating it is that it can<br/>
be used to justify the *right* and *good* thing for us all.  I&#39;d love to<br/>
find the original John Holt quote to see how he really worded it.<br/>
<br/>
What I see as a hidden message with Helen&#39;s use of this idea is that HEM is<br/>
doing the right thing, they are being true leaders - following their own<br/>
vision.  But with that vision they only share certain points of view in<br/>
their magazine, and by doing so they believe they are helping others see<br/>
those same POV, which are the &quot;right&quot; views to have.  So in the end, this<br/>
is actually the same thing as having followers.  In fact, you can even see<br/>
in the wording that she used that it may not be about whether or not to<br/>
have followers, it&#39;s just about not caring &quot;who&quot; they are (ie. if we don&#39;t<br/>
have any unschoolers following us, that&#39;s just fine -- which seems to be<br/>
their stance.)<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not what I&#39;ve ever gotten out of John Holt&#39;s writing (or<br/>
Sandra&#39;s!)  The idea isn&#39;t about empowering someone else to figure out for<br/>
themselves that your POV is the right one, it&#39;s about empowering them to<br/>
find their own true path - which may look very different from yours!<br/>
<br/>
I have a word/idea that I&#39;ve been thinking about recently, and that is<br/>
self-validation.  I think this really fits my own interpretation of John<br/>
Holt&#39;s idea.  A true leader is self-validated; they don&#39;t need followers to<br/>
help tell them they are right, they don&#39;t need to convince others to have<br/>
the same POV in order to be validated.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh this is a great insight. &quot;You can have any color you want as long as it&#39;s<br/>
the same as mine&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
This really is a key idea, sometimes challenge, for Unschooling parents. The<br/>
idea that if you are creating an environment of genuine choice for your<br/>
children, sometimes they are going to make choices that you disagree with,<br/>
or come to conclusions that are different from yours. <br/>

<br/>
I guess Helen and her staff members don&#39;t feel the need to be validated by<br/>
Unschoolers - but they still want to suggest that we are the ones in the<br/>
wrong place - or perhaps more accurately the &quot;less right&quot; place.<br/>
<br/>
Self-validation is another great concept for Unschoolers to embrace.<br/>

It might be that it wasn&#39;t an interesting post to some of us.  I  seriously <br/>

I did go back and reread your post.  I am assuming it was the post  about <br/>
helping the child figure out what their real needs are, in wanting to go  to PS, <br/>
and helping them to work out solutions and opportunities that meet those  <br/>
needs and do not involve PS.  That is not a new concept and has been  discussed <br/>
here and on other lists many times.  You could probably search  the archives and <br/>
see what others have said about the subject.  Maybe search  public school or <br/>
my child wants to go to school etc. <br/>
 <br/>
I personally cannot relate.  My boys have never been to school and  have no <br/>
desire to &quot;try it out&quot;.  <br/>

Hi -<br/>
<br/>
When you are not getting the response you want, it&#39;s best just to repost <br/>
it or rephrase it and see if you can raise more interest.  Insulting <br/>
people will get you attention, but it won&#39;t increase the discussion of <br/>
ideas, which you stated was your goal.  I think your post was a broad <br/>
insult to everyone who read yesterday and didn&#39;t post.  If that wasn&#39;t <br/>
your intention, then I&#39;d appreciate it if you&#39;d clarify what the above <br/>
post meant.<br/>
<br/>
(At this point, the water is pretty cloudy and I have no idea what <br/>
&quot;challenging concept to the status quo about &quot;unschoolers&quot; succumbing to <br/>
school you are talking about.  A quote from your original post would <br/>
have been clearer.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  If my child wanted to go to public school, I wouldn&#39;t be thrilled, <br/>
but if I couldn&#39;t meet his perceived needs at home, I am committed to <br/>
letting him try it.  Because I feel no child should be unschooled <br/>
against his will.  That would be an oxymoron.  Do some of you disagree <br/>
with that approach?<br/>
<br/>
PPS (Now that I have gone back and re-read in the archives, I can say <br/>
that I agreed with your post on Saturday that it would be desireable to <br/>
meet a child&#39;s needs by enhancing community.  However, I don&#39;t often <br/>
comment about posts that I agree with.)</div>

proverbial headless chicken all weekend on non-list business matters. I&#39;d<br/>
really prefer NOT to have to play police officer Pam this weekend, so if you<br/>
could refrain from posting messages to the list about what people do and do<br/>
not choose to respond to and why, it would make my life easier and my temper<br/>
less iffy, not to mention the small matter of keeping the list to its<br/>
intended purpose instead of de-railed into discussions that have nothing to<br/>
do with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Another poster on moderation already had a post rejected yesterday for being<br/>
nothing but flame-bait. This is not in general a moderated list (new members<br/>
are moderated so we can avoid spam messages and once in a blue moon a member<br/>
is put on moderation or left on moderation if they truly cannot converse<br/>
like socially-able adults), and neither the list owner nor the other<br/>
moderators are interested in moderating a lot of members. We&#39;re far more<br/>
likely just to send them on their way.<br/>
<br/>
If no one responds to a post, it is most likely because a) They weren&#39;t<br/>
interested or b) They, like me, had a few other things to see to on the day<br/>
it was posted. You can always try posting again (courtesy works), reword the<br/>
post, or try another topic. If you don&#39;t find enough folks here to converse<br/>
with, you can also try another list.<br/>

I sent several posts to this list in the last few days and none of them<br/>
posted.  I went through the range of anger at Yahoo! for messing things<br/>
up again, paranoia over cosmic karma and after your post, certainty that<br/>
I was the moderated member.  I have been considered by some a flame<br/>

Anyway when I went to sent messages to check the details I found the<br/>
address I was using said AlwaysLearning at yahoo &quot;gorups&quot; .   I don&#39;t<br/>
know what a gorup is but I now know if you send mail there it disappears<br/>
entirely, never to be seen again. (or so I&#39;m assuming)<br/>
<br/>
In a happy twist of fate it led me to reconsider one post - a snarky,<br/>

The above concept wasn&#39;t that challenging to long-time <br/>
unschoolers/mindful parents.<br/>
<br/>
I just figured that the poster had young children and hadn&#39;t yet<br/>
had the opportunity to fully appreciate the critical thinking ability <br/>
of life-long unschoolers.  Apologies if that assumption is <br/>
incorrect.  <br/>
<br/>
One interesting thing about people who have always been supported in <br/>
their decisions, is that they make good decisions for themselves.  <br/>
Regardless of age.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is now pursuing psychology.  She has expressed a desire <br/>
to go to school because she wants to understand why schooled children <br/>
think the way they do.  She feels one of the ways to gain that <br/>
understanding is to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
She is 13.<br/>
<br/>
She hasn&#39;t gone (yet).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-436769872">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Nor the  fact that I have posted a challenging concept to the status <br/>

<br/>
You know there have been times when I have written something I thought was<br/>
erudite and fabulous and then...nuttin&#39;.  And then other times I make some<br/>
minor comment in passing and bingo a huge and wide ranging discussion<br/>
ensues.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s completely unpredictable.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Pam G. The idea of winkling out the &quot;real&quot; need behind the<br/>
desire to go to school *has* been expressed often here and on U/D. The<br/>
aspect of freedom is that we may still have to be prepared for the kid to<br/>
say, &quot;I get that you will help me find other friends (or whatever the need<br/>
is), but I still want to see about school for myself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I read the post, enjoyed the expression, but it is up &#39;til<br/>
now irrelevant to my life. Also as I have posted often, I avoid school<br/>
conversations, and this looked like it *might* go in that direction.<br/>

What the hell does that mean?  Did I miss a post that said we should  wait <br/>
for Sandra to post before we do?<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know what you are referring to when you say &quot;challenging  concept...&quot; <br/>
so I will go back and look.  But maybe, just maybe, the people  who haven&#39;t <br/>
commented found your post completely un-challenging and not worth  their time <br/>
to respond?<br/>

&gt; Here&#39;s the reply I sent in response to another person&#39;s letter <br/>
 </span></blockquote>this morning:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you have the opportunity - via discussion lists, message boards <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I thought this was an odd and inappropriate way for the publisher of <br/>
a national homeschooling publication to circulate her rationale for <br/>
what is essentially a personnel action.  <br/>
<br/>
First, did the information need to be circulated at all? (Seems to <br/>
me that it is a private matter between an editor and author.) But if <br/>
so, why not post it on the publisher&#39;s own e-mail list at HEM-<br/>
Unschooling Cafe?  Finally, might not the most appropriate venue to <br/>
discuss her rationale be within the editorial pages of Home <br/>
Education Magazine?<br/>
<br/>
For the record: I do not know any of the parties involved.  <br/>

unschooling conference in two weeks&#39; time.<br/>
<br/>
One in Peabody with hundreds of people.<br/>
One in Chicago with dozens of people (but it was a limited, small  <br/>
conference from the get-go).<br/>
<br/>
Both all and entirely unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t be back until Tuesday night.  I&#39;m looking at nearly 100 <br/>
posts here I haven&#39;t read and won&#39;t have time to read, and it <br/>
tempts me sorely.  Maybe I&#39;ll stay up late tonight and catch up, or <br/>
maybe tomorrow night.<br/>
<br/>
I was writing about unschooling from the time I got on *Prodigy, <br/>
in I think 1993 (not positive about that date).  I was writing TONS <br/>
on AOL before I read any HEM.  I gladly took on editing an online <br/>
newsletter for HEM in those old days (1997??   I&#39;d have to check <br/>
on my own computer), before the days of anything like <br/>
yahoogroups.  I kept a list of subscribers on my Mac, and <br/>
checked new and &quot;remove me&quot; against my list every month &quot;by <br/>
hand&quot; with over a thousand subscribers (though I found a clever <br/>
way to do it quickly by putting new people in green font, outgoing <br/>
in red, alphabetizing the whole list and deleting what was <br/>
duplicated with red, and deleting the black-match if a green was <br/>
duplicated.)    I ran an online chat every week (Tuesday from 1:00 <br/>
to 3:00, I think) and then edited it down into a readable format for <br/>
uploading to the unschooling library there.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there I was asked to write for the magazine.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t write for the magazine first and then start helping other <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m curious to see what else has been written, but people are <br/>
going to come over here to hang out in a bit.  Some who were at <br/>
the conference on Saturday and maybe some who weren&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday I was force-marched a mile or so to the El and then all <br/>
over downtown Chicago, Millenium Park, in and out of cool <br/>
buildings, over bridges for better views of architectural details...  <br/>
my feet HURT.   But I got to hang out with two unschooling moms <br/>
who hadn&#39;t been at the conference.  And today I got to see part of <br/>
The Field Museum.  Part.  All would have taken two or three days.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow, home!!<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t hear from me again until then, it&#39;s just me trying to be <br/>
a good guest here in foreign-land.<br/>

<br/>
If I was gone and people started talking about how parents could <br/>
best deal with teachers and nothing else, that wasn&#39;t the <br/>
purpose of the list.    <br/>
<br/>
When I peeked in on the list, no one was talking about the HEM <br/>
problem. That came soon after, and I didn&#39;t know that until now <br/>
(Monday night).<br/>
<br/>
But with or without that, it was a joke.  It would have been a joke <br/>
even without the winky-smile.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t get a joke, it doesn&#39;t help anyone for you to say so.<br/>

If you didn&#39;t see mine, go back and read Friday night (I think it <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No doubt, if people WANT to discuss the ideas they can.  There <br/>
is no such thing as thinking with anyone else&#39;s mind, so don&#39;t <br/>
yell about it.<br/>
<br/>
This list was not created to discuss school.<br/>
If school is to be discussed, it should only be discussed in ways <br/>
in which it will help people better understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
That was my point a few nights ago, and that is my point now.  <br/>
And if people agree or disagree with me the point is not THAT <br/>
(whether they think as I do), but the point is that this list is my list, <br/>
created by me, and if I say &quot;take this school discussion to <br/>
another list so that we can discuss unschooling,&quot; that&#39;s not me <br/>
telling anyone how to think.  It&#39;s me saying &quot;Help me maintain the <br/>
integrity of this unschooling list.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Way too much explanation for one little joke.<br/>
