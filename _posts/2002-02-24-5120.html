<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043119916">We have 200 members as of this moment.  It might be 198 by afternoon, but <br/>
with all the comings and goings, we&#39;ve come to 200.<br/>
<br/>
For being a contributor, I get a first-class copy of Home Education Magazine. <br/>
  The big topic is the definition and purity of homeschooling, or <br/>
homeschooling as discreet from school-sponsored programs.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this isn&#39;t a philosophical question.  Maybe it&#39;s a political one, which <br/>
is why I&#39;m confused.   <br/>
<br/>
Clearly different homeschoolers have different motives and boundaries.  Some <br/>
seem to want to disprove and undo the compulsory attendance laws.   Some want <br/>
freedom from government control (good luck with that one, longterm...).  Some <br/>
want some degree of isolation for social, religious, dietary or safety <br/>
reasons.<br/>
<br/>
One argument that has been presented to me, personally, over the years is <br/>
that we (homeschoolers) need to be a unified group, that we&#39;re all in this <br/>
together, that we have to support the rights of all homeschoolers.  That <br/>
sounds good in a pep-rally way, but it has always seemed to me that <br/>
conservative school-at-home homeschooling is 180 degrees from what I want and <br/>
do and believe, with school halfway between us.  They leave because school is <br/>
too permissive, teaches too broad a set of information.   I&#39;m out because <br/>
school is so restrictive, and teaches so narrow a set of information.  So <br/>
I&#39;ve never seen myself the same as, or in the same category as, those who use <br/>
ABeka or Sonlight or anything super-structured and punish children for <br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot; infractions and &quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;low grades.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Soem of the objections (not just in this issue of HEM, but in online <br/>
discussions from time to time) seem to have to do with whether someone else <br/>
is telling the family what and how to teach.  Some seem to deal more with the <br/>
family&#39;s freedom of schedule and movement.  <br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t understand is why subscribing to a &quot;homeschool&quot; that involves <br/>
parents teaching per directions and sending the tests and assignments back to <br/>
the company for grading or comment or whatever is considered homeschooling <br/>
(whether it&#39;s A Beka or Clonlara), while unschooling while signed up with an <br/>
alternative school program is not.<br/>
<br/>
Why jump on an unschooler who has accepted state funding, but NOT jump on <br/>
someone who paid $800 or $1000 for someone else to tell them exactly what to <br/>
do?<br/>
<br/>
I care more about how people learn than about what they&#39;re taking from teh <br/>
government or not.  If I believed school methods worked, I&#39;d probably send my <br/>
kids to school.  I think school methods can be harmful to children and their <br/>
families, and those children&#39;s future children.  So why (if it is, as it <br/>
seems to me) are families who school MORE like school than school does <br/>
supposed to be my partners and cohorts, while those who don&#39;t school <br/>
school-style are bad guys for signing up with a charter school or umbrella or <br/>
special program?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve complained about the Family School here in Albuquerque, but again it&#39;s <br/>
because of methods.  I hate for them to call it &quot;half-time homeschooling&quot; <br/>
when that half time is prescribed assignments and homework which the parents <br/>
have to chart and document.  And if kids miss school or parents miss the <br/>
required weekly meetings, the child is dumped in favor of someone else on the <br/>
mailing list.  If Albuquerque Public Schools had an unschoolers&#39; help center <br/>
with people advising families and teaching them to unschool, I wouldn&#39;t care <br/>
if they got full state, federal and add-on-special-ed funding for every one <br/>
of them, as long as they let them learn however they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is just a perspective problem, like looking at a ribbon.  You can <br/>
look at it edge on, you can look at the width of it, you can look at it as <br/>
something with two opposing sides, or you can see it as something the cat can <br/>
twirl and tangle into a big mess.   <br/>
<br/>
What am I missing in the current debate?<br/>

Could an understooding of the origin of the grassroots homeschool <br/>

<br/>
Are there any other grassroots movements that we can trace the <br/>
history of to help explain the reason for this debate?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any answers.  I&#39;m just glad to have the right to <br/>
homeschool.  If debates of this nature aide in the preservation of my <br/>

<br/>
Part of it may be the piece that says if the government is giving you money, <br/>
they will want something - accountability probably - back.<br/>
<br/>
Can you imagine a gov. sponsored unschooling program that was totally <br/>
hands-off? I can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;while unschooling while signed up with an <br/>
alternative school program is not.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why anyone would want to say that is not really homeschooling <br/>
though. <br/>
<br/>
I would advocate for the rights of all homeschoolers as a group, because if <br/>
you start to separate us out according to method, you leave us open to <br/>
regulation. That is a political question.<br/>
<br/>
The importance of why people homeschool is a philosophical question.<br/>
<br/>
Does that get to what you were asking?<br/>

herding cats. If the only thing that unites  a group is not subscribing to<br/>
something as large and dominant and far reaching into every corner of our<br/>
society like public-school, there will be as many reasons for being part of<br/>
the group as there are corners in our society.  Politics always creates<br/>
strange bedfellows.  This is just another example.<br/>
<br/>
The only reason we have such free access to home schooling here in<br/>
California is because all the private schools have paved the way ahead of<br/>
us.  The freedom to be out from under a government run schools is about the<br/>
*only* issue I feel united with private schools. It&#39;s a political union.<br/>

<br/>
Here in VA, we have a state homeschooling org whose volunteers work <br/>
diligently to keep governmental paws off homeschooling, so I can see how this <br/>
would work if such an organization *were* diligent.  It seems every session <br/>
I&#39;m having to write a note to my representative to head off one governmental <br/>
intrusion or another in homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a problem with state funded/state regulated options for <br/>
homeschooling, nor do I have a problem with anyone who chooses to make use of <br/>

loud and ugly then on the same subject.  There was someone from the &quot;other <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a perennial issue, and I&#39;m not sure whether I want to keep arguing <br/>
with any of them about it.  The ironic thing is that there are at least a <br/>
few states and provinces where the legal homeschoolers have to do *more* in <br/>
the way of accountability than I have to do on the program we&#39;re with in <br/>
this province.  We&#39;re supposed to send in a report 3 times a year with info <br/>
on what our kids are learning within the BC curriculum.  We don&#39;t have to <br/>
*follow* the BC curriculum.  We just have to find at least some things in <br/>
it that our kids have learned in the last few months.  Easy.  I&#39;m glad BC <br/>
still has the other option of no reporting at all, but for a computer, <br/>
internet access, and some extra dollars to spend on great electronic <br/>
&quot;toys&quot;, I don&#39;t mind at all.<br/>

&gt;Well, I think you might be comparing apples and oranges.  At least the<br/>
&gt;reasons people criticize these things are vastly different.  Personally, I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;supportive of homeschoolers whether they accept state funding or not.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;known families for whom that was the best way.  But, as Joyce pointed out,<br/>
&gt;the criticism for that comes from the very real threat that once you accept<br/>
&gt;monies from the government, the government expects to have a hand in telling<br/>
&gt;you how to use that money and then we start slipping down that slope of overt<br/>
&gt;governmental control of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the argument I keep hearing.  Yet in BC we&#39;ve had these programs <br/>
for over 7 years now, and there&#39;s been no change to the homeschooling <br/>
law.  What I tell people who are worried is to keep vigilant about the <br/>
homeschooling laws.  Fight any changes toward more control, even if you use <br/>
the programs and thus aren&#39;t officially homeschooling in the eyes of the <br/>
State.  Seems to me that would work a lot better than trying to make people <br/>
feel like traitors for using the programs.  Get those people on board with <br/>
the state or provincial homeschooling groups so the government knows that <br/>
they have the numbers to fight any changes to the homeschool law.  That <br/>
said, I&#39;d better go renew my membership in our provincial org.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; What am I missing in the current debate?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think you might be missing fear.  From some of the more outspoken<br/>
opponents to government programs here in CA, I&#39;ve read some very strongly <br/>
fear based articles.  Cathy something-or-other (I&#39;m spacing her last<br/>
name, she used to be CHN&#39;s webmaster) wrote an article about<br/>
how the government preys on homeschoolers just like the predators<br/>
in Africa prey on the wildlife there.  Maybe she was just trying<br/>
to scare her readers into joining in her crusade; maybe she actually<br/>
believes it.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that (again amongst the ones here in CA) in their worldview<br/>
the ultimate evil is government control.  I&#39;ve met Chris Cardiff and<br/>
his family IRL.  Chris is strongly opposed to government control in<br/>
education.  Yet his daughters are not unschooled.  For you, me and <br/>
probably the other members of this list, control as administered in<br/>
any school setting is the ultimate evil.<br/>
<br/>
This has been my experience.  I bought into their thinking too, until<br/>
I moved here in November, 2000.  I spent a lot of time agonizing over<br/>
my decision to join the local charter program.  I kept thinking &quot;how<br/>
could I sell out homeschooling?&quot;  But when I looked at the program<br/>
and the alternatives and I realized that I&#39;d be &quot;selling out&quot; my children<br/>
by not joining this program.  It is a great community resource.  We<br/>
joined about 1 year ago.  I do have more paperwork to do than if we&#39;d<br/>
remained independent.  It&#39;s been great and we&#39;ve met a lot of really<br/>
neat unschooling families in this program.  <br/>
<br/>
IMO it&#39;s the fear, anger, and the personal attacks that is more of a <br/>
problem than the purity of homeschooling.<br/>

Maybe that&#39;s one reason that in some states people don&#39;t want homeschoolers <br/>

<br/>
Some states, though, like Texas, aren&#39;t counting at all.  And New Mexico&#39;s <br/>
counting, but like Hansel we hold out a little bone instead of a real finger. <br/>
 It&#39;s estimated that as many as 2/3 of homeschoolers here don&#39;t register.  <br/>
That was the estimate a few years back.  I&#39;m guessing that since the law was <br/>
relaxed, it&#39;s over 3/4 unregistered.<br/>
<br/>
I would just as soon have the schools get funding just as if my kids were <br/>
there.  It&#39;s a shame that our kids being gone doesn&#39;t improve the per-student <br/>
funding, or decrease the student/teacher ratio.  I wish it would.<br/>

??? What this statement means is escaping me, but then lots of things baffle <br/>
me these days. :)<br/>
<br/>
In any case - here in IL homeschoolers are unregistered and unregulated, and <br/>
most of us fight to keep it that way. Any advantages gained by knowing how <br/>
many of us there really are are far outweighed by the potential for harm. The <br/>
problem with giving educrats a bit is they always want more. Start keeping <br/>
lists of homeschoolers and it won&#39;t be very long at all before legislators <br/>
and educrats believe they ought to be doing something with those lists. <br/>
<br/>
For me though it&#39;s mostly a privacy and freedom issue. It&#39;s not the state&#39;s <br/>

My sister married a millionaire (no kidding), the kind with a trust fund and stocks in the company, and he&#39;s set for life and he doesn&#39;t work at all. They had a huge house (about 4,000 sq. ft) but they just built their dream house. It&#39;s over 12,000 sq. ft, up on the side of a mountain with a view, a negative edge pool, 2 jacuzzis, an elaborate home theater room, and even an elevator (why? for the heck of it!), and they aren&#39;t planning on ever having kids. All this is just for the 2 of them. They NEVER host business parties and my BIL is actually quite a recluse and very private. Why did they build this house? Well, it is customed designed just for them and it has all the things they ever wanted in it. They have the money and they use it to please themselves with the certain things they buy and have. They don&#39;t travel. I should mention, though, that for all this money, my BIL is going blind and no amount of money will buy his eyesight back. It&#39;s very sad. He&#39;s only in his early 40&#39;s. I always think that it&#39;s so ironic this way that LIFE has a way of balancing everybody out naturally, whether you are rich or poor. And just because you are a millionaire doesn&#39;t mean you are rich. I&#39;m sure he would trade all of his money to get his eyesight back right now.<br/>
<br/>
This probably isn&#39;t typcial of all millionaires, I&#39;m sure. Most probably buy big houses to show off to other people. But I&#39;d bet that MOST millionaires are just NOT typical people to begin with. There is a story behind each and every one. :-)<br/>

We recently took a road trip with it and imo it is a piece of crap! We were trying to drive up a mountain and the thing wouldn&#39;t go! A beat-up old truck pulling a trailer passed us.<br/>
