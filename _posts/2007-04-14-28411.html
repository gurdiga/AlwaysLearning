<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634079898">I would appreciate any advice in regard to the best way to handle the situation of spouses who don&#39;t agree on gaming issues.  While I am not in the least bothered by my son&#39;s interest in computer games, my husband constantly tells me that he thinks our son spends too much time on the computer.  Sometimes my son will play for a long time, other days he doesn&#39;t play at all.  Sometimes he will play for awhile and then get out his Lego&#39;s and try to build the characters on the game.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I consider everything he chooses to do to be a learning experience. I have done research to try and help my husband see gaming in a positive light--that it isn&#39;t addictive or harmful, etc.--but all of this seems to fall on deaf ears.  I felt that maybe it was more of a physical activity issue, so I agreed to come up with a fun physical activity for the kids to do every day.  <br/>
   <br/>
  My question relates more to the issue of how to persuade a spouse to see things from a different perspective in regard to unschooling than just to the issue of gaming.  I use gaming as an example, because it seems to be the only unschooling issue that my husband and I argue about.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Any thoughts are appreciated--I&#39;m willing to look at things from all perspectives!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-471675882">I have always had issues myself with gaming.We have five computers all<br/>
networked together and my 4(now 3) kids will spend days on the computer<br/>
playing World of Warcraft.I dont get it and do worry, but I also see so<br/>
much that has come from it too.First off my five year old learned to<br/>
read playing these online games.His interest in the game World of<br/>
Warcraft(he&#39;s a level 37 Paladin) sparked his interest in getting the<br/>
graphic novels and reading all three cover to cover.Now his most recent<br/>
love is Guitar Hero 2.He plays on easy right now but can get through the<br/>
hardest song.He is spending hours doing this.I love that he will focus<br/>
so hard on something he wants so bad.How many small kids will spend sooo<br/>
much focused time trying to accomplish something that is so hard to do?<br/>
Failure doesnt stop him, he just keeps trying till he is as good as he<br/>
is happy with.Do I need to mention his eyehand coordination as well as<br/>
his typing skills?<br/>
Gaming is hard work.They have to focus, they have to learn to keep<br/>
trying time after time till they beat the area or game.Its frustrating<br/>
but they just keep at it.I think they call it perserverence.That in<br/>
itself is amazing to me.<br/>
<br/>
Now let me mention my now 19yo.He spent his whole 4years of highschool<br/>
gaming.He worked parttime, and played computer or PS2 on his time off.He<br/>
also drew anime and watched lots of movies.Then he finally got bored<br/>
with it and started pacing the house wondering what to do with his<br/>
life.He wanted to take an art class in Denver and we sent him to live<br/>
with his Auntie so he could.He ended up taking 6 college classes so he<br/>
could get the 15 credits he needed to join the Marines.He made all A&#39;s<br/>
and B&#39;s and these were hard classes he took with only a &quot;6th grade<br/>
education&quot;.Now he just graduated MCRD and is on his way to the School of<br/>
Infantry in San Diego.BTW he scored a 97 on his last written test in<br/>
bootcamp.Basically he got what he wanted even though he &quot;wasted&quot; most<br/>
his life playing video games...Most people may not see joining the<br/>
Marines as a good life choice but this kid has been talking about being<br/>
a &quot;soldier&quot; since he was 3yrs old.<br/>
Im just giving you some of my experience.I do try and find physical<br/>
things for them to do each day, like go to the lake or play frisbee with<br/>
the dogs.My 13yo wants to start a dog walking business that we are now<br/>
trying figure out since the weather is starting to get better.Im hoping<br/>
that this will work out, but I still dont make any rules about time on<br/>
the computer.<br/>
I guess if they were playing legos for hours and hours and days on end<br/>
that would be more acceptable?What about reading novels for hours on<br/>
end, day after day? I dont know if gaming is bad or not but it hasnt<br/>
hurt my kids in any real tangible way so I say let them play...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think if it was anything else besides tv or videogames, people  <br/>
would look at the whole kid, not just at the activity they&#39;re engaged  <br/>
in, and consider whether the kid is doing okay or not. What I mean  <br/>
is, watching hours and hours and hours of tv or playing hours and  <br/>
hours and hours of videogames could possibly be a sign of depression,  <br/>
but it usually is not. Those are activities that can conveniently be  <br/>
used to sort of occupy one&#39;s mind and avoid thinking about things we  <br/>
don&#39;t want to think about - a way to avoid feeling sad or scared or  <br/>
angry. I think many of us have used these activities in this way, a  <br/>
bit, here and there, so we kind of know that it is possible. Reading  <br/>
and eating are other things people can use this way, sometimes, too.  <br/>
(And, yes, many of us WERE told, as kids, to &quot;Put down that book and  <br/>
go out and play.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think parents are concerned that tv and videogaming can be  <br/>
a form of avoidance of life or lead to avoiding other parts of life,  <br/>
and I don&#39;t think that concern is completely unfounded. If I had a  <br/>
kid who started watching tv for seven or eight hours per day, I would  <br/>
pay some attention to what else was going on with that kid and I&#39;d  <br/>
pay attention to how the child was interacting with the tv shows.  <br/>
Rosie, my 16 yo, just finished watching all eight seasons of &quot;The  <br/>
West Wing.&quot; There was no avoidance of life happening there - it was  <br/>
that she was LOVING the show and part of what was so enjoyable for  <br/>
her was how much she was learning. She watched many episodes over and  <br/>
over and she asked questions and googled things, because there was a  <br/>
lot she didn&#39;t understand, at first. It has been really obvious that  <br/>
we had absolutely no reason to worry about her tv watching. This has  <br/>
been a pattern for her - to get really into a certain show or two and  <br/>
watch and watch and watch it. For a long time it was Roseanne and The  <br/>
Cosby Show - she analyzed and analyzed the behaviors in those two  <br/>
families and our family has had many conversations about those family  <br/>
dynamics. It has been an ongoing study of marriage and parenthood -  <br/>
college courses in the sociology of families couldn&#39;t come close to  <br/>
offering the amount of learning that we&#39;ve experienced through  <br/>
Roseanne and The Cosby Show. English courses in writing &quot;Compare and  <br/>
Contrast&quot; essays couldn&#39;t have offered the kind of development of  <br/>
critical thinking that comparing and contrasting Roseanne and The  <br/>
Cosby Show offered.<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are healthy and happy, who have lots going on in their  <br/>
lives, who enjoy their lives, who have good, strong relationships  <br/>
with their parents, are not at risk, imo, for excessively watching tv  <br/>
or playing videogames as a form of avoidance. The difference is  <br/>
whether they are choosing to do something (watch shows/play games)  <br/>
versus using tv and gaming to avoid something else.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can tell the difference IF they can shake themselves loose of  <br/>
the fear created by writers such as Marie Winn, auther of &quot;The Plug- <br/>
In Drug.&quot; Here is the publishers description of that book:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In The Plug-In Drug, Marie Winn demonstrates &quot;with devastating  <br/>
persuasiveness&quot; (The Washington Post) that television has a negative  <br/>
impact on child development, school achievement, and family life. But  <br/>
rather than focusing on program improvement as a solution, Winn  <br/>
proposes that the problem lies within the seductive act of TV  <br/>
watching itself. Extensive TV watching alters children&#39;s relations  <br/>
with the real world, depriving them of far more valuable real life  <br/>
experiences, especially playing and reading. Ever sympathetic to  <br/>
parents&#39; need for relief, Winn proposes ways to control this  <br/>
addictive medium and live with it successfully. This 25th anniversary  <br/>
edition addresses the variety of new electronic media that have  <br/>
supplemented television in the home and increased children&#39;s bondage  <br/>
to screen experiences. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is sensationalist fear-mongering. It isn&#39;t a thoughtful look at  <br/>
what can help parents look at their real whole child. It assumes from  <br/>
the start that these things that children love (watching tv and  <br/>
playing videogames) are negative. It never considers the benefits of  <br/>
supporting a child&#39;s interest, engaging with the child in the  <br/>
activities the child loves best. It also doesn&#39;t consider the longer- <br/>
term impact on children who are reminded regularly that what THEY  <br/>
like to do is bad for them - how can these children not get the  <br/>
message, loud and clear, that pursuing their own interests is a bad  <br/>
thing to do?<br/>
<br/>
My college classes are filled to capacity with young people who are  <br/>
extremely out of touch with their own interests, passions, aptitudes,  <br/>
etc. Ask them what do they want to do - they frequently say, &quot;Get a  <br/>
good job.&quot; That&#39;s as far as they can think. They don&#39;t have any  <br/>
interest they want to pursue - they don&#39;t trust themselves to have  <br/>
such interests. If they DO have an interest, they don&#39;t even consider  <br/>
it as a possible career. Last semeseter, I had a student who was  <br/>
majoring in &quot;Business Management&quot; (many of my students are majoring  <br/>
in business of some kind or another, because I teach economics). I  <br/>
complimented her on a purse/bag that she was carrying and she told me  <br/>
she&#39;d made it herself. I said I loved it and would love to have a  <br/>
similar one, wondered how much she&#39;d charge to make me one. Turns out  <br/>
she WAS making them for friends and sometimes selling one here and  <br/>
there. She designed them herself. She&#39;d also designed some clothing.  <br/>
Loved it. I asked her why she didn&#39;t pursue fashion design and she  <br/>
had no answer, just hadn&#39;t really considered it. I got some  <br/>
information for her about the Fashion Institute of Design and  <br/>
Merchandising in Los Angeles and a few months later she emailed me  <br/>
and she&#39;s been accepted to start there in the fall.<br/>
<br/>
How is this related to tv and videogames? I honestly think that it is  <br/>
ALL about parents not being really engaged and in touch with their  <br/>
own kids and not trusting themselves to really know their kids better  <br/>
than some author or journalist or even scientist who studies groups  <br/>
of kids. Conventional wisdom is extremely distrustful of children and  <br/>
one aspect of that is being sure that adults know better than kids  <br/>
what they ought to do with their time. But you can&#39;t grow up with  <br/>
someone else always in charge of what you do with yourself and  <br/>
constantly reminding you that you can&#39;t trust your OWN interests, and  <br/>
then, suddenly, at 18, know yourself and be able to think about what  <br/>
you want to do with your time. I&#39;ve seen kid after kid after kid who  <br/>
automatically dismisses the idea of pursuing anything they are  <br/>
actually interested in - they have deep inner belief that it must not  <br/>
be worth pursuing if they are interested in it.<br/>
<br/>
I want to encourage parents of younger children to think with a  <br/>
longer-term perspective --- think (for yourself) about what long-term  <br/>
message you&#39;re giving your child now. If you say, &quot;You&#39;d like to play  <br/>
videogames for 6 hours a day, but that&#39;s not good for you so I&#39;m  <br/>
restricting you to 2 hours per day,&quot; then what might the kid be  <br/>
hearing from that? How about this? &quot;What I really LOVE to do and want  <br/>
to do a lot is bad for me and it would be better if I didn&#39;t do it at  <br/>
all, but I&#39;m weak and can&#39;t resist so i&#39;ll do just a little and feel  <br/>
a little ashamed when I do it.&quot; Yikes! Is that what we want running  <br/>
through our kids&#39; minds all the time? How will that sentiment play  <br/>
out when it is STILL running through their minds when they are 18  <br/>
years old?<br/>

unschooling. I used to teach middle school, and once I gave a journal <br/>
prompt that was something like, &quot;What job would you like to have when <br/>
you&#39;re older?&quot; A few boys, as soon as they read it, said to me, <br/>
almost emotionlessly, &quot;Well, what job makes a lot of money? That&#39;s <br/>
what I&#39;ll be.&quot; They were completely serious.<br/>
<br/>
I have a relative who went to college and majored in Business, <br/>
immediately didn&#39;t like it, but &quot;didn&#39;t know what else to do&quot; so she <br/>
didn&#39;t change her major. That is so strange to me, and I suspect it&#39;s <br/>
not unusual.<br/>
<br/>
I was a music major in college. I&#39;ve actually had one or two parents <br/>
tell me that their child will NOT be allowed to major in music. (One <br/>
person even had a list: her twelve year old was told she could not <br/>
major in music, or English, or art ...). Not only is that rude to <br/>
their kids, and a crummy attitude, but I think it&#39;s also kind of <br/>
insulting to me!<br/>

<br/>
Actually my enjoyment of it has evolved over the years. I first read <br/>
it seven years ago and DID have the &quot;TV is bad&quot; mentality. A lot of <br/>
it stemmed from not liking the way TV was used in my house when I was <br/>
growing up, and &quot;blaming&quot; it on the TV itself.<br/>
<br/>
As I re-read it over the years, though, and realized it <br/>
wasn&#39;t &quot;shameful&quot; to enjoy TV (nor would it make me like my parents), <br/>
I still liked the book, but more as a sort of social <br/>
commentary, &quot;signs of the times&quot; kind of way. <br/>
<br/>
For me, it&#39;s more like &quot;this is what a lot of American families are <br/>
like and how they think&quot; as opposed to being a book about TV being <br/>
bad.<br/>
