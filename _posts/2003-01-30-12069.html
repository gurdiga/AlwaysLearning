&gt; We<br/>
&gt; &gt;have an excellent relationship with Perry, but the truth is, that if<br/>
&gt; &gt;something happened to me, whatever Julian needed or Beth wanted, Perry<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt;call all the shots. I THINK he would want to do what&#39;s best for Julian,<br/>
&gt; &gt;including NOT sending him to school, but I am not certain. It&#39;s scary. And<br/>
&gt; &gt;Julian HAS thought about it, and has talked about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Would it help for him to talk about his worries with Perry?<br/>

does not respond as well as he could, and Julian does not like talking about <br/>
his feelings very much. I think the best thing to do would have me talk to <br/>
Perry when he&#39;s in a good mood.<br/>
