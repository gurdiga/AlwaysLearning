<div id="ygrps-yiv-14055468"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Lastly, and this is a tad off topic, any recommendations to keep ticks<br/>
&gt;at bay? My 8 yo comes in from the yard with a tick nearly every day.<br/>
&gt;This is surburban middle class Virgina!! Not deep forest!! It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;driving me nuts. I have a real phobia about them and my husband has to<br/>
&gt;remove them cos I can&#39;t bear to look :-(<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Take care<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We used to have a BIG problem with ticks when we first moved here to Clovis,<br/>
NM.  They were all over the dog and the kids every time they came in the<br/>
house. We finally had to treat the whole yard with diazenon.(sp?) We did the<br/>
back yard first, and wouldn&#39;t let the kids or the dog back there for a<br/>
couple of days, then did the front yard. No more ticks since, and it has<br/>
been 4 years since we treated the yard.<br/>

P.S. I used to live in Colorado Springs, and I wouldn&#39;t move back there for<br/>
anything. (unless, of course, my husband got transferred there)</div>
