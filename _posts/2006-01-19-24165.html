 </span></blockquote>Are there other kids who can come and play with him?  Are there  <br/>
things he might do like swim classes or sports or karate or cut  <br/>
scouts or art classes or music?  If he gets where other kids are and  <br/>
meets some kids and families, he might have places to go and people  <br/>
to invite.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Development wise...he is yet to read. I believe he has alot of<br/>

<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the wrong course.    If reading  (inability) is  <br/>
stressful, reading to him and playing games that involve reading will  <br/>
be a reminder.  Does he like movies?  You didn&#39;t mention movies.     <br/>
You can discuss the same ideas, art, language, plot, character, drama/ <br/>
comedy you could discuss after reading a book if you do it after a  <br/>
movie.  Maybe you could do a theme (one movie at a time, letting his  <br/>
preferences change the plan anytime).  If he liked Charlie and the  <br/>
Chocolate Factory, that could go toward more movies by the same  <br/>
director (Nightmare Before Christmas, Beetlejuice, Peewee&#39;s Big  <br/>
Adventure) or to other Johnny Depp or to other special effects movies.<br/>
<br/>
You didn&#39;t mention music.  Might he like musicals?  Little Shop of  <br/>
Horrors?  Wizard of Oz?  Peter Pan with Martin?  That one could lead  <br/>
to other Peter Pan DVDs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-789244906">I know this probably won&#39;t help very much, but boredom is not necessarily a<br/>
bad thing.  Boredom is a motivator and  often leads to exploration of the<br/>
world around you and opportunities for learning and growth.  Eventually he<br/>
may simply *do something* on his own to relieve the boredom and in the<br/>
process expand his horizons.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While this is true, in the context of unschooling if a child is bored  <br/>
the parents probably need to be doing more.<br/>
And from a mindful parenting point of view if we replace boredom with  <br/>
another emotion, it seems cruel.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually he may &quot;do something&quot; on his own to relieve the fear and  <br/>
in the process expand his horizons.<br/>
Eventually he may &quot;do something&quot; on his own to relieve the sorrow and  <br/>
in the process expand his horizons.<br/>
Eventually he may &quot;do something&quot; on his own to relieve the depression  <br/>
and in the process expand his horizons.<br/>
Eventually he may &quot;do something&quot; on his own to relieve the  <br/>
embarrassment and in the process expand his horizons.<br/>
<br/>
I never used to think of boredom as an emotion until another  <br/>
unschooling mom described it that way.  Before then, I think I  <br/>
considered it the way my parents and grandparents did.  Boredom was  <br/>
just a sin.  Boredom was ingratitude, lack of intelligence, whining.   <br/>
An expression of boredom was the same as saying &quot;I don&#39;t have enough  <br/>
chores--make me mop the kitchen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
American culture has a deep Puritan undercurrent.   We have a  <br/>
separation of church and state, but our language and culture are  <br/>
infused with hidden sins.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>However, there is, I think, another aspect to boredom. I have seen in my <br/>
own life, and in the lives of my children (now aged 15, 18, 22, 24), how <br/>
boredom usually comes towards the end of a cycle. As one nears the end <br/>
of a period in one&#39;s life but haven&#39;t quite found the next thing to get <br/>
involved with / excited by. It is then a sort of restless, seeking <br/>
energy. You get twitchy and snappy and despondent and, well, bored! But <br/>
it seems to be, for some of us anyway, a necessary part of the journey. <br/>
That&#39;s not to say that a parent can&#39;t try to help by offering a <br/>
supportive, patient, listening ear, or by suggesting possibilities, or <br/>
what ever. I just don&#39;t think you should necessarily get too panicky <br/>
about it. One of my sons once said to me something along the lines of, <br/>
&quot;I wish you wouldn&#39;t get so involved. Sometimes I feel sad or angry or <br/>
bored or frustrated, and that&#39;s just how life is. It&#39;s okay for you to <br/>
sympathise and listen, but I hate it that you always try to fix things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So sometimes boredon is an emptiness that can be fixed by a parent <br/>
making life more interesting, by providing more or different <br/>
experiences, resources, whatever, but other times it is due to a period <br/>
of transition, and I don&#39;t think in that case there is much one can do <br/>
but refrain from snarling, &quot;well, just go and find something to do!&quot; and <br/>
just be loving and understanding and listen.<br/>

In my life, as I got older and was better able to analyze and  <br/>

kinda clean up the house a little--nesting behavior, like cleaning  <br/>
out some workspace for when the unknown whatever-it-is comes.<br/>

Maybe it&#39;s restless expectation.<br/>

But boredom seems more like dissatisfaction with surroundings and  <br/>
opportunities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2043835105">Thanks everyone who responded. My heart says it&#39;s more of a <br/>
transitional funk. The world is his oyster, but usually he likes to <br/>
hang close to home. He is not one to like clubs or sports. I asked <br/>
him if he wanted to go to the zoo (2 hours away) he said y-e-s-? So <br/>
we are planning that...he loves animals. We are watching the weather <br/>
hoping for snow somewhere within a 7 hour drive (NC) if that happens <br/>
we will load up and go. I just need to keep my expectations under <br/>
control (and my worries about him not reading ;-) ) <br/>
