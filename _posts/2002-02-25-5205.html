<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219120829"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;NOW, how strong would the medication have to be to make her HAPPY?????&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe she&#39;s not looking for happy. Maybe she&#39;s just looking for NOT <br/>
depressed. If she was already on medication and looking for a higher dose, <br/>
maybe all those difficult life circumstances were throwing her brain <br/>
chemicals out of whack again. It happens. Maybe she knows what it feels like <br/>
to be severly, clinically depressed and she does NOT want to let it get to <br/>
that point again. Maybe it&#39;s easier to ask the doctor for help now, rather <br/>
than after she&#39;s so depressed she can&#39;t even get out of bed, make dinner for <br/>
her kids, complete a focussed thought or stop picturing that gun pointed at <br/>
her head and feeling a sense of relief.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Let&#39;s face it, sometime life is hard and sad, and we need to feel that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re kidding right? Anti-depressants have nothing to do with not feeling. <br/>
They have eveything to do with being able to feel and process and react and <br/>
think. Telling  a clinically depressed person to stop whining and deal with <br/>
life, is like telling a diabetic that they just need to deal with the <br/>
insulin problems. Their body will resolve its&#39; sugar issues if they just <br/>
feel their way through it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My input about it anyway.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And my personal experience right back at ya.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;ps - I have dated a little since my divorce and each man (all three of <br/>
&gt;&gt;them)is on Prozac.  Will I find someone that isn&#39;t???  I&#39;m still <br/>
&gt;&gt;looking.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If that&#39;s your criteria for relationships (men and women apparently) you&#39;d <br/>
probably do best to steer clear of me and my family.<br/>
Many in my bloodline are medicated. But at least we&#39;re not getting out the <br/>
noose like great-grandma.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-39663496"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I believe that certain chemical make ups or personality types are<br/>
&gt;more prone to depression just like some people are more prone to<br/>
&gt;becoming alcoholics.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, these two go hand in hand. Alcohol can give a temporary fix for <br/>
those altered brain chemicals. Obviously it&#39;s not a good or healthy fix and <br/>
ultimately makes matters worse. But I believe the theory that many <br/>
alcoholics are self-medicating without knowing it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;*But* I think our childhood experiences play a large role in greatly <br/>
&gt;&gt;influencing all aspects of our lives.  Not all people prone to being <br/>
&gt;&gt;alcoholics become alcoholics.  Not all people prone to depression need to <br/>
&gt;&gt;take medication.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what would make you &quot;prone&quot; to either of these conditions. Do <br/>
you mean a family history? Personal weakness? I&#39;m curious, not antagonistic <br/>
BTW. :o)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I really wish there would be a study done of the children whose<br/>
 </span></blockquote>families followed an unschooling lifestyle and see if they grow up<br/>
with a lower than the normal population need for medication.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was sure unschooling would make everything different for my kids. <br/>
Unfortunately it didn&#39;t. My son has struggled with depression, but not my <br/>
daughter. It would be interesting to hear of others&#39; experiences.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;My brother was severely depressed for years.  He was really not<br/>
&gt;functioning well even on Prozac.  Ever since he overcame the total<br/>
&gt;lack of self-esteem he was left with by my father he has been doing<br/>
&gt;wonderfully.  He finally found a job he was good at.  It took him<br/>
&gt;until he was 40 to be able to say to himself &quot;I am a grown man&quot;.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s so wonderful. Maybe we&#39;ll someday be able to figure out more <br/>
definitively who needs medication and who needs a better life situation or <br/>
whatever.<br/>

I read recently that certain parenting styles made children more <br/>
prone to drug and alcohol abuse.  This was from T. Berry Brazelton&#39;s <br/>
book &quot;The Irreducible Needs of Children&quot;.  Using fear as a method to <br/>
control kids was the method he was mentioning.  I took this thought <br/>
one step further and figured that this would be more likely if the <br/>
person was already physically prone to these problems.</div>

<br/>
If there is such a thing as a strong personality, there must then be such a <br/>
thing as a weak one.<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;weak&quot; is in the eye of the beholder.  Something the military prizes <br/>
might be seen as weakness outside the military.   Someone in a culture in <br/>
which women MUST be quiet and passive would last MUCH longer with the ability <br/>
to &quot;be weak&quot; than someone who couldn&#39;t shush and just do what her mother in <br/>
law said.<br/>
<br/>
So I think it&#39;s relative and it&#39;s situational and IF it has to do with <br/>
personal nature, then it has to do with biochemistry.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think of a strong personality as sort of the opposite of a wishy-washy<br/>
personality. What I think we&#39;re talking about here is what I&#39;d call a<br/>
resilient personality, someone who can bounce back well. That&#39;s what I<br/>
hope unschooling gives Cacie, resiliency, because she doesn&#39;t come from<br/>
very resilient stock...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve read that repeated trauma can actually change your biochemistry.<br/>
When you&#39;re stressed, your body makes all sorts of hormones to help you<br/>
to fight, or flee, or something. If fighting and fleeing are maladaptive<br/>
or impossible,  you still end up with all those stress hormones flying<br/>
around anyway, even though you&#39;re just sitting there trying to disappear.<br/>
You end up with chronically high levels of stress hormones, you&#39;re<br/>
hypervigilant, and there&#39;s no release... and here I get fuzzy on the<br/>
whole thing, but someone you ended up with low serotonin levels. <br/>
<br/>
I would think repeated stress as an adult could have the same effect, to<br/>
some degree. <br/>
<br/>
I have a familial history of depression, but the same family member has a<br/>
history of abusing and being abused, so there&#39;s the chicken and egg<br/>
thing. I hate pills but I take antidepressants anyway, because I don&#39;t<br/>
think it&#39;s fair to Cacie to have to deal with me crying and grumping just<br/>
because I hate pills. I don&#39;t take them all the time, but I can tell when<br/>
I need them. I can&#39;t really make myself take them just because they make<br/>
me feel better, but I&#39;m getting there. I also quit smoking and making<br/>
myself throw up when I was pregnant, because that wasn&#39;t fair to Cacie<br/>
either...<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I still have trouble taking those stupid pills regularly, and I<br/>
have no insurance so I&#39;m taking SJW, which kinda works... it doesn&#39;t<br/>
totally get rid of the depression but it doesn&#39;t get rid of the rest of<br/>
my feelings either, which the other ones do.<br/>
<br/>
Dar, babbling away...<br/>

&gt;would be more prone to depression.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm...Maybe that scenario would make someone more prone to self destructive <br/>
behaviors, liking drinking and drugs and such. Things to numb the obvious <br/>
pain being inflicted. Or the behavior of isolating oneself from people <br/>
because past experiences were so bad. Those destructive behaviors might then <br/>
lead to the physical factors that alter brain chemistry. The altered brain <br/>
chemistry causes true clinical depression IMO.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Do you feel *most* depression is due to a physical cause as opposed<br/>
 </span></blockquote>to an emotional cause?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do. Of course, my study sample size is very small-me and mine. ;-) But <br/>
based on my family history of depression, bi-polar, drug and alchohol abuse, <br/>
I really believe there&#39;s a genetic link and a physical cause.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the physical symptoms of depression were as bad or worse than what <br/>
people think of as the &quot;sad/emotional&quot; symptoms. I physically could not get <br/>
out of bed in the morning. I felt like I had been hit by a truck. At the <br/>
worst part of it, I felt like I was underwater just trying to get to the <br/>
surface for a breath. It was physical. For me, the anti-depressants started <br/>
helping in 3 days. The link was undeniable. Once I was stable on the <br/>
medication, I could see where my thinking patterns had been going so <br/>
terribly wrong. I never could have solved the &quot;emotional&quot; part of it without <br/>
having the brain balance to look at it all clearly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Personal weakness is an interesting concept.  Is there any such thing as <br/>
&gt;&gt;true personal weakness?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t really think so. At least I wouldn&#39;t label it as such. But I guess <br/>
some people do react more forcefully and others more tepidly. The phrase <br/>
personal weakness has been used for ages when talking about alcoholism. I <br/>
see it coming out again these days when people start talking about <br/>
depression. The idea that life is sad and we need to learn to live with it, <br/>
or at least accept it. That is true, but that doesn&#39;t mean a depressed <br/>
person is physically capable of doing it.<br/>
<br/>
I have experienced both alcoholism and depression personally. I quit <br/>
drinking cold turkey the moment I found out I was pregnant. Is that a <br/>
personal strength? I never thought so. I lingered for quite awhile in a <br/>
horribly depressed state. Is that personal weakness? I don&#39;t believe that <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
I acknowledge that some people like to hover on the edge with being down and <br/>
moody. An attention getting device for emotional reasons? Maybe. That&#39;s <br/>
different from what I&#39;m talking about.<br/>

<br/>
Some people love the feel of adrenaline, so they bungie-jump and ride roller <br/>
coasters and drive too fast.  I do NOT like the feel of adrenaline.   Any <br/>
biochemical &quot;cocktail&quot; can feel good to someone or other.  Some people are <br/>
sadistic.  Some are masochistic.  So I don&#39;t doubt there are people who enjoy <br/>
the feeling of sadness and despair.  There&#39;s plenty of music, poetry and art <br/>
for them to use to trigger that feeling when they want it.<br/>
<br/>
Some people like to get drunk and goofy.   <br/>
<br/>
IF a person is drinking for fun, but he has within him whatever-it-is that <br/>
craves alcohol to the point of addiction and family abandonment, he needs to <br/>
NOT drink for fun.  I can drink for fun, and I don&#39;t want alcohol the next <br/>
day.  But there are some friends of mine who have chosen not to drink at all, <br/>
and it would be low and mean of me to invite them to drink.  <br/>
<br/>
I have friends who are prone to depression.  I am too, myself.  And so it is <br/>
NOT a good idea for those friends to discuss (for fun) death, or to watch <br/>
really sad movies, or listen to really sad music, because there can be <br/>
emotional triggers for depression.<br/>
<br/>
If I find out an alcoholism-prone friend (or former-practicing-alcoholic <br/>
friend) has gotten drunk, it&#39;s something for me to visit with them about, or <br/>
to check in on them about, to make sure they came through okay and haven&#39;t <br/>
started drinking a lot again.<br/>
<br/>
If a friend who&#39;s prone to depression has a death in the family or other <br/>
serious jolt to equilibrium, I will MUCH more quickly attend to cheering them <br/>
up than if it had been a friend who can bob on the surface of emotional <br/>
trauma.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509444454">My dad was depressed.  He had a terrible childhood and served as a medic<br/>
in the war.  He spent some time in the state mental hospital after trying<br/>
to kill my mom, but was never medicated.  <br/>
He became very depressed after learning he had cancer.  A year later when<br/>
they told him it had metastasized to bone cancer and he only had six<br/>
months to live he became a different person.   He got nice.<br/>
I never liked my dad when I was growing up, but as an adult, and<br/>
especially the last eight years of his life, we had a wonderful<br/>
relationship.  I get my dad now and I didn&#39;t when I was younger.  He did<br/>
his very best and I have to admire that, even if his best left a lot to<br/>
be desired.  He lived eight years after his six month sentence, and I can<br/>
only guess it was due in part to the remarkable change that took place in<br/>
him when he looked at what was left of his life and wanted it to be more<br/>
than it had been.<br/>
Medication might have given my dad and the rest of us a better life,<br/>
we&#39;ll never know.   <br/>
He held an alcoholic brother together as long as possible and took care<br/>
of his sister in law.  He was with his sister in her battle with bone<br/>
cancer and at the end.  He stayed and supported his kids even though he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to and a lot of guys bail on that one.  He supported extra<br/>
kids when they ended up with us, and endless stray critters. <br/>
I saw all the bad things about my dad growing up, but I&#39;m happy to say<br/>
the good I came to see in him in my adult life is replacing the bad.  <br/>
Mostly I just feel sorry for him, that he wasted so much time on misery. <br/>
 But it&#39;s been a good lesson to his children,  who now tend to &quot;bob on<br/>
the surface of emotional trauma&quot;  and slide deeply into the joyous.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-355288160"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;People can be depressed without having used alcohol and drugs.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely. I was using that as one example of a depression/brain chemistry <br/>
trigger. I also mentioned someone isolating themself. For some, alone time <br/>
is nourishing, for others it&#39;s isolating and painful. Trauma, death, <br/>
divorce, etc. can all be triggers IMO. I think the part that makes people <br/>
&quot;prone&quot; to depression starts with  a genetic predisposition for your brain <br/>
chemicals getting out of whack. Although not every depressed person has a <br/>
history of drugs and alcohol, there seems to be a pretty strong correlation <br/>
between the two.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;So I don&#39;t doubt there are people who enjoy the feeling of sadness and <br/>
&gt;&gt;despair.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know---enjoy? Maybe they&#39;re drawn to it. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the <br/>
same as enjoying it exactly. I could be wrong obviously.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Some people like to get drunk and goofy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I used to love getting drunk and goofy. It evolved into something else <br/>
pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;IF a person is drinking for fun, but he has within him whatever-it-is that <br/>
&gt;&gt;craves alcohol to the point of addiction and family abandonment, he needs <br/>
&gt;&gt;to NOT drink for fun. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never knew I had it within me until it happened. I have lots of <br/>
discussions with my kids about it though. I think it helps that we&#39;re more <br/>
open about it, and recognize family patterns and genetic predispositions, <br/>
than in the past.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I can drink for fun, and I don&#39;t want alcohol the next day.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So can my husband, my parents, one sister and one brother. My grandmother, <br/>
an aunt, an uncle, three brothers and I can not. Lots of the ones who <br/>
weren&#39;t alcoholics were still hit with pretty severe depression though. I&#39;m <br/>
not sure where that leaves my kids. I have told them they need to be much <br/>
more aware than most. They need to realize the extra risks they are taking <br/>
by even dabbling with mood enhancing substances. They&#39;ll need to be extra <br/>
vigilant during times of stress to watch for depression. (This was done on <br/>
an age appropriate level BTW.)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with everything you said about caring and helping and watching out <br/>
for friends who might have problems with alcohol, drugs or depression. We <br/>
need our friends.<br/>

unschooling or homeschooling is a cure-all or prevent-all. I have no way of <br/>
knowing if there is a greater or lesser rate of depression among the <br/>
unschooled teens versus schooled teens, but I do think sometimes that the <br/>
unschooled kids feel a lot of pressure/weight on themselves when they get to <br/>
be 17 to 19 or so. Giving them responsibility for their own learning is <br/>
empowering and they are wonderful wonderful kids - but many also suffer from <br/>
a lot of depression and anxiety at that age. They have MUCH bigger dreams and <br/>
ambitions than most schooled kids. They don&#39;t think, for example, of just <br/>
going to college and getting a job. NOT FOR THEM!!!! They have huge ideals - <br/>
they want to feel fully fulfilled by what they are doing and they often want <br/>
every moment of their lives to be filled with pure BLISS!!! Becoming an adult <br/>
can be really hard for them.  They really want independence- they place a <br/>
super high value on taking care of themselves and do not want to feel <br/>
dependent at all. And sometimes this means getting a job to be able to afford <br/>
a car and apartment, etc. They DO struggle, sometimes, with schedules - with <br/>
committment to regular work or study -- not being able to be totally free sp<br/>
irits. They struggle with working in places where they see inefficiency and <br/>
lack of creativity - it is much harder for them than for kids who are used to <br/>
it in school. AND - most of all - the reality that their big dreams are going <br/>
to take long, hard and often tedious work, begins to really hit them around <br/>
17 or so and that can feel really discouraging to kids who have been so well <br/>
supported in achieving their dreams all their lives.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I agree with everything you said about caring and helping and watching out <br/>
for friends who might have problems with alcohol, drugs or depression. We <br/>
need our friends. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sister just left her husband of 23 years.   Many people were stunned.  My <br/>
sister has never been prone to depression at all.  But she used to drink, and <br/>
she used to do cocaine.<br/>
<br/>
When I first heard (accidently saw an IM between my niece and a friend of <br/>
Kirby&#39;s who knows her well, which was left on my desktop when the kids went <br/>
to sleep), I wondered right away whether one of them had started drinking or <br/>
doing drugs and the other had said &quot;I&#39;m outahere.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t that.  Still, each is in renewed danger now of self-medicating, or <br/>
finding some new friends who won&#39;t know they REALLY need to not use drugs or <br/>
drink.  Really.  And the kids, all teens, are unknowns as to the risk of <br/>
depression, because their lives have been idyllic in large part.  I don&#39;t <br/>
know what a big shock like this will do.  They&#39;re left with their dad in the <br/>
big house, and my sister has moved out with their karate teacher.  Yeeeps!<br/>
<br/>
yeeeeeeeeeeps.<br/>

It turned out not to be the case, and I was first surprised, but hugely <br/>
relieved.</div>

&lt;&lt; They have MUCH bigger dreams and <br/>
ambitions than most schooled kids. They don&#39;t think, for example, of just <br/>
going to college and getting a job. NOT FOR THEM!!!!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I see that in Pam&#39;s two older kids, but I don&#39;t see it in mine.  I think <br/>
Kirby would be happy to be put on full time at the gaming shop, take a few <br/>
classes at the university, and share an apartment with other gaming geeks.  I <br/>
also think he might end up doing better than that, but I&#39;m pretty happy with <br/>
the idea that it seems that would make him feel fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
Marty, I don&#39;t know.  He seems happy with whatever, so maybe that will extend <br/>
to job and goal and all too.  He&#39;s great at saving money, and great at just <br/>
not wanting much.  So is his dad, and I think it&#39;s hugely genetic.  <br/>
<br/>
But when I see Kirby go under the surface sometimes a bit, I think being here <br/>
with me is safer and sweeter than if he were at school with people who could <br/>
easily make him more depressed, more frustrated, and give him something to <br/>
focus his dark squint on.  We see it early and jolly him up in various ways, <br/>
including tipping his friends off.  So far so good.  And since he was little <br/>
we&#39;ve talked about small tips to be calm.  <br/>
<br/>
It seems in me, that if I catch those first feelings of a catch in the <br/>
biochemistry, of the up and down of adrenaline, fear, despair, that I can <br/>
consciously ward it off.  But if I&#39;m too busy or it&#39;s overwhelming, I can get <br/>
to the point that I need counseling and Prozac.  It&#39;s happened three times <br/>
now, over 15 years.  The longest I was on Prozac was 18 months.  That <br/>
followed the near-total shutdown with daily, hourly death wishes.<br/>
<br/>
I think the first time it happens to someone they think life is done and gone <br/>
(and sometimes that comes true).  But each time you pull back out (however <br/>
that happens) it increases the knowledge that it&#39;s possible to pull back out. <br/>
 And knowing what it feels like coming on and what it feels like as it&#39;s <br/>
lifting helps the person to be able to manage, avoid, increase--whatever it <br/>
takes--their own physical reactions to some extent.<br/>

&gt; and served as a medic<br/>
&gt; in the war.  He spent some time in the state mental<br/>
&gt; hospital after trying<br/>
&gt; to kill my mom, but was never medicated.  <br/>
&gt; He became very depressed after learning he had<br/>
&gt; cancer.  A year later when<br/>
&gt; they told him it had metastasized to bone cancer and<br/>
&gt; he only had six<br/>
&gt; months to live he became a different person.   He<br/>
&gt; got nice.<br/>
&gt; I never liked my dad when I was growing up, but as<br/>
&gt; an adult, and<br/>
&gt; especially the last eight years of his life, we had<br/>
&gt; a wonderful<br/>
&gt; relationship.  I get my dad now and I didn&#39;t when I<br/>
&gt; was younger.  He did<br/>
&gt; his very best and I have to admire that, even if his<br/>
&gt; best left a lot to<br/>
&gt; be desired.  He lived eight years after his six<br/>
&gt; month sentence, and I can<br/>
&gt; only guess it was due in part to the remarkable<br/>
&gt; change that took place in<br/>
&gt; him when he looked at what was left of his life and<br/>
&gt; wanted it to be more<br/>
&gt; than it had been.<br/>
&gt; Medication might have given my dad and the rest of<br/>
&gt; us a better life,<br/>
&gt; we&#39;ll never know.   <br/>
&gt; He held an alcoholic brother together as long as<br/>
&gt; possible and took care<br/>
&gt; of his sister in law.  He was with his sister in her<br/>
&gt; battle with bone<br/>
&gt; cancer and at the end.  He stayed and supported his<br/>
&gt; kids even though he<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t want to and a lot of guys bail on that one. <br/>
&gt; He supported extra<br/>
&gt; kids when they ended up with us, and endless stray<br/>
&gt; critters. <br/>
&gt; I saw all the bad things about my dad growing up,<br/>
&gt; but I&#39;m happy to say<br/>
&gt; the good I came to see in him in my adult life is<br/>
&gt; replacing the bad.  <br/>
&gt; Mostly I just feel sorry for him, that he wasted so<br/>
&gt; much time on misery. <br/>
&gt;  But it&#39;s been a good lesson to his children,  who<br/>
&gt; now tend to &quot;bob on<br/>
&gt; the surface of emotional trauma&quot;  and slide deeply<br/>
&gt; into the joyous.  <br/>

Japan during the occupation later and made life long friends with a<br/>
Japanese prisoner there.  They exchanged photos and letters for years.  <br/>
My dad wouldn&#39;t talk about his experiences in the war much,  but he did<br/>
write a few things in a little book for Dylan.   He died a year ago last<br/>
November and I still cry when I read that little book.   Such a wimp!<br/>

This has been true for me.  I have had 3 episodes of overwhelming anxiety<br/>
and depression and I the first one had me thinking it would never end. <br/>
When the third one occurred I knew that it would which made it shorter<br/>
and manageable.<br/>
<br/>
I have since begun using Celexa to boost my seratonin and I&#39;m seeing much<br/>
improvement.  Medication combined with management skills learned over the<br/>
years not only help me function but even make life more fun.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had not been so resistant to the idea of medication for so long.<br/>
