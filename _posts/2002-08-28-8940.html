&lt;&lt; Rain in the desert is one of my absolute favorite smells...<br/>
It brings out the natural scent of the desert plants .... it&#39;s just magical<br/>
to me ... and far too rare lately. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I smells really good at my house, and we&#39;re even in town.  Something about <br/>
the ionization of the air makes everything feel different too.<br/>
<br/>
I think that effect needs a desert to work.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing that surprised me was that in Pennsylvania when I was camping there <br/>
(at Pennsic war, years back) the rain was warm.  In New Mexico, rain is <br/>
always cold.  I guess it&#39;s the altitude of the clouds, because even when it <br/>
hits the ground it&#39;s still a mile above sea level, and the clouds in <br/>
Pennsylvania were low and we were maybe at 400 feet or something (I don&#39;t <br/>
know).<br/>
<br/>
I was used to rain drops being totally distinct from the air around them, <br/>
too, and some of that sea level rain, like in England, is more like a drippy <br/>
mist than the rain I had learned to recognize as rain.<br/>

rain on a grocery-store parking lot, all asphalt with gas and oil spots, <br/>
somehow still smells good when it rains in northern New Mexico.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I think the main smell here when it rains is creosote. It&#39;s all over<br/>
town and in the city, not only in the desert, so that smell comes out<br/>
whenever it rains. We have a creosote bush in the backyard and even if I<br/>
water it with the hose, it&#39;s that same &quot;rain&quot; smell.<br/>
<br/>
Just curious, Dar. Why did Rain (Casey) change her name to Rain? Was it<br/>
because she liked the smell or the way she felt whenever it rained - or<br/>
because she saw someone else with the name and just decided she liked it?<br/>
It&#39;s a cool name and I just love whenever it rains!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rain is actually Raina Prudence Quinlan. I had always wanted her to be<br/>
named Acacia Rain, mostly for a friend of mine named Reana who died<br/>
shortly before my Rain was born, but her dad won out and she was Acacia<br/>
Erin. So, during some conversation when she was saying she didn&#39;t like<br/>
her name, I told her that Rain has been a strong contender for her middle<br/>
name, and she decided that would have been better. She also likes the<br/>
rain....<br/>
<br/>
Prudence, of course, is for the Beatles song.<br/>

parking lot and some of the asphalt had gotten on the landscaping timbers. It <br/>
was really hot out, and it had just briefly rained. I was instantly whisked <br/>
away to Alaska, my Dad, and the docks down on the job-site. MAN! What a <br/>
memory! (Yep, my Dad was one of those bad oil men. &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of smells, I can smell snow. When the sky turns that soft lead <br/>
color, the whole world goes quiet, and there is this sharpness hanging in the <br/>
air. I love it. <br/>
