<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025606332">I store my photos in iPhoto on my computer right now - I don&#39;t have  <br/>
many pics -  but I was thinking of using online storage in the future  <br/>
for both photos and other data. In the summer, I heard a program on  <br/>
NPR about &quot;cloud computing&quot; (storing information online) which made me  <br/>
think I needed to research it a bit more. It&#39;s here:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It hasn&#39;t stopped me from considering it, not at all. The most  <br/>
important advice for me was to actually read the user agreements &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-628299553">A free account at Flickr limits the file size to 10 MB per photo  <br/>
which are compressed to 1024 pixels if they&#39;re larger than that. The  <br/>
paid account to 20 MB but you can still access your original size  <br/>
photos.<br/>
<br/>
Also the free Flickr account only lets you see the latest 200 photos.  <br/>
All the photos are still there and you can access them if you have  <br/>
the links to them, but you can only see the latest 200 on your  <br/>
account page. To see earlier ones you&#39;ll need to delete later ones.<br/>

<br/>
Photobucket might have similar limitations.<br/>
There&#39;s also Picasa, the Google photo storage. There&#39;s a limitation  <br/>
to 1G total but you can always add another account. I think Flickr is  <br/>
unlimited but you can only upload 100M/month or something like that.<br/>
<br/>
There are also external hard drives. You can get oodles of gigabytes  <br/>
for a hundred dollars or so. (LaCie is a reliable brand. I&#39;ve even  <br/>
dropped it. It&#39;s like a metal brick ;-)<br/>

Not that I know of.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to poke around photobucket accounts, here&#39;s mine.  The  <br/>
files aren&#39;t as organized as they would&#39;ve been if I&#39;d known I&#39;d get  <br/>
a paid account and live there.<br/>

Here&#39;s Holly&#39;s free account.  She&#39;d had a laptop that died on her,  <br/>
and she lost photos, so we got her a laptop for Christmas 2007 and a  <br/>
paid photobucket account so she could store them in two places.  But  <br/>
her old account is still there. I don&#39;t know if they&#39;ll look  <br/>
different from the outside.  There are just many more options and an  <br/>
unlimited  number of folders and more storage space with a paid account.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195524485">===She&#39;d had a laptop that died on her, and she lost photos, ===<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s probably too late now, unless you just happen to have <br/>
that old laptop laying around, but the data on a hard drive is not <br/>
lost when the computer dies - even if you have a hard drive <br/>
malfunction.<br/>
<br/>
A few years ago my hard drive crashed on my laptop with all of my <br/>
photos and several important documents on it.  This included all of <br/>
my photos of my daughter&#39;s first year of life.  My dh took the hard <br/>
drive out of my laptop and took it to work.  His IT department had <br/>
some gadget that he hooked up to my hard drive, and he was able to <br/>
extact every file I wanted from my hard drive.  After he purchased a <br/>
new hard drive for my laptop, he put the files back onto my computer, <br/>
and we went on as if the crash never happened.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember what the gadget was called, but I&#39;m sure if you <br/>
describe it to an IT person she/he will know what you are talking <br/>
about.  <br/>

You cannot (apparently, it seems) upload directly to Picasa from a  <br/>

the intelligence I&#39;ve gathered this week that might help with this  <br/>
