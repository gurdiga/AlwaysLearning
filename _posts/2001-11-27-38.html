&lt;&lt; -=-This is way out there, but I feel like people can never get enough of <br/>
(be satisfied by) something that isn&#39;t really satisfying. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems to be the nature of humans to feel unsatisfied, to want something <br/>
more, better, different, and new. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Satisfaction is having a need met.  It can also be lesson learned, job well <br/>
done, confirmation of a path taken.  It can be the feeling of a moment&#39;s <br/>
reflection, or an overview.  To say that something isn&#39;t really satisfying <br/>
seems to demand more of the feeling than is necessarily appropriate.  To <br/>
imply that unless imbued with altruism, the feeling is selfish and of lower <br/>
quality.  <br/>
<br/>
Nick (my 12 year old) seems to find real satisfaction in playing D&D.  Go <br/>
figure.  What he gets out of it:<br/>
<br/>
He has characters he imbues with characteristics and personality -- he <br/>
controls their actions but not their fate.  He learns to deal with adversity <br/>
and disappointment, to come up with solutions to unexpected challenges.  He <br/>
experiments with responses which have no real life consequences, in the <br/>
company of friends.  He gets to make mistakes and try again, without hurting <br/>
someone &quot;real&quot;.  He and his friends play for hours at a time -- they argue <br/>
and negotiate, debate the merits of a over b -- these are real skills which <br/>
will in future serve them well.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s also the Dungeon Master (the person who develops the story for a group <br/>
of gamers) for a weekly online group.  He started this group -- and has <br/>
members ranging from 15 to 30 years in age.  His ability to plan a quest in <br/>
advance, to decide what problems the groups will face, which monsters they <br/>
will encounter, what pitfalls will spring up -- amazes and pleases me.  I <br/>
value his imagination and ability to guide and inspire others.<br/>
<br/>
Childhood is short.  I know there&#39;s a mindset which says that we denigrate <br/>
childhood by assuming it wants no altruism, to make no real difference in the <br/>
world.  That to imply by allowing children to stay at home or in school, <br/>
&quot;wait until you&#39;re older to make a real difference&quot; invalidates the child as <br/>
a whole and capable person.  Eh.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was in seventh grade, as a class, we collected money for food, <br/>
packaged it up, and drove an hour and a half to a small town, and delivered <br/>
food packages to families whose fathers were in jail.  I felt both awkward <br/>
and self-righteous -- awkward because some families seemed uncomfortable with <br/>
us trooping into their house with boxes of food, and self-righteous because <br/>
some famiies lived in &quot;nice&quot; houses and how was it they needed this support?  <br/>
I did a supportive action, without having the perspective to really <br/>
understand it.  I got the underlying emotions, without awareness of what <br/>
their situations really were.    <br/>
<br/>
That same year, we spent some time playing with children at a penitentiary, <br/>
during visiting hours for families, so husbands and wives could talk without <br/>
interruption.  There was resentment and hostility swirling around which now, <br/>
I can certainly understand.  But then, it was confusing and alarming.  <br/>
<br/>
There are children who&#39;ve done amazing things with volunteer efforts.  There <br/>
are adults as well.  But not all adults do.  Not all children do.  Such is <br/>
life.  <br/>
<br/>
I want to give my kids time to grow up internally, at their pace, in a <br/>
supportive environment geared to who they are.  I contribute to causes which <br/>
are important to me -- and if my kids decided they wanted to participate in a <br/>
cause, I&#39;d support that too.  But I&#39;m not going to nudge them into it as <br/>
something which they should be doing now, to be real.  There are gives and <br/>
gets, as in all things.<br/>
