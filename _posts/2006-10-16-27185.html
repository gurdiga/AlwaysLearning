<div id="ygrps-yiv-621200171">I think what they are doing is great!  We traveled the country one summer and had a blast.  Then we bought land and horses and now we only take little getaway&#39;s to see snow.  My spouse has talked about living on a sailboat, but the kids said only if it comes with acreage and horses.  RVing is a fun way to travel, though, we have good memories.  I recommend everyone try it at least for a few weeks.<br/>
