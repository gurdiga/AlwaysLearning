<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121813699">I&#39;m really enjoying reading about this subject.  About 2 months ago I kept<br/>
&quot;wishing&quot; there was a book called &quot;The Organized Unschooler&quot;..  A book that<br/>
would give me some insight on how to get organized so that I don&#39;t feel so<br/>
overwhelmed or didn&#39;t feel so overwhelmed with all the choices of activities<br/>
that we could do.<br/>
<br/>
For example I have found that having a very large cart in the kitchen with<br/>
lots of art and crafts, coloring books, and stuff to do projects with is a<br/>
must (well for my kids).  I had so many things all over the place that my<br/>
house was becomming way too messy (at least that I was comfortable being<br/>
in)...<br/>
<br/>
I now also have another 3 tier cart with 3 drawers in it (it&#39;s on wheels)<br/>
and in one of the drawers I put information about upcoming homeschooling<br/>
events in our area or that we might like to attend, such things are info<br/>
from our homeschooling group, or student days at various events such as the<br/>
Renaissance Fair in Phoenix, U of A Presents (matinee theatre for school<br/>
kids 6 times a year) In another drawer I put information about on-going<br/>
opportunities my kids might like, such as Karate places, Soccer Camps, Ice<br/>
Skating (Zak just announced he wants to learn to play Ice Hockey in Tucson<br/>
no less... LOL)....<br/>
And in the third drawer I have ideas for projects or books about subjects<br/>
the kids have shown interest in, even if it was a glimmer of interest.  Also<br/>
in that drawer places for me to follow up with such as looking to find out<br/>
if there is a Lego Racers Competition, where and when it&#39;s held and whether<br/>
we want to go etc....<br/>
<br/>
So even though we are unschooling there is some organization for me and my<br/>
mental needs.... Mental being the appropriate word.<br/>
<br/>
I have more containers now than I ever did to pile buckets, cars, trucks,<br/>
trains etc into without having them strewn everywhere and the next thing is<br/>
a table for projects (got this idea from Heather this afternoon) so they can<br/>
keep things out instead of putting them away (as we are using the kitchen<br/>
table).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe these seem simple to some people, but these were things I didn&#39;t<br/>
realize would make my life easier and also the kids, because they know where<br/>
things are kept now.<br/>
