<div id="ygrps-yiv-1030811440">**Or &quot; I&#39;m glad Bill Gate&#39;s mom didin&#39;t say to him,  honey, you&#39;ve been<br/>
on the computer too much!&quot;.**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure that I read in a Bill Gates biography that when the<br/>
school librarian wouldn&#39;t let him check out more than three books at at<br/>
time and the school wouldn&#39;t bend the policy his parents actually<br/>
enrolled him in a different school.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always impressed wh3en parents are willing to fight the system.  <br/>
Kids who know that their parents will fight for them have incredible power.<br/>
