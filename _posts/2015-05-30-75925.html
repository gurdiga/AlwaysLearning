would love to here about how others work and unschool. We(husband and myself)
feel completely overwhelmed and guilty that I’m not able to do more with my
daughter. The other thing is we don’t know anyone and with the time I’m putting
into the business we aren’t meeting people like I would like.(Sky seems to be
fine with it). Sky spends most of her days on Minecraft, watching TV, and
sometimes drawing and watching Youtube.<span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-622097191">&nbsp;

good ideas on managing work and unschooling? Btw we have no family here and at
the moment on a strict budget to get to the next level with our business. We
joined a local unschool group, so far we haven’t been able to attend any of the
activities for one reason or another. I was considering putting her in some Y
camps this summer to help out with the time I need to get work done and give
her some other things to do. She seems really interested in the lego build camp
and others. I was hoping we could meet some people in our new town <span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-622097191">&nbsp;</span>that way as well.<span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-622097191">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I <span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-622097191">&nbsp;</span>think<span style="" class="ygrps-yiv-622097191">&nbsp; </span>I

<br/>
You didn&#39;t say how old she is.<br/>
If you&#39;re really busy and you need babysitting, school might not be the worst thing, for a while.  When she&#39;s older and can do more things without you, unschooling would still be an option. <br/>
<br/>
Being in school because the parents think it&#39;s necessary isn&#39;t the same as being in school with parents who know learning happens in Minecraft and Youtube, drawing and playing.<br/>
<br/>
Summer camps might be a way to find friends and have fun.  It also might be a way for you and her to gauge whether school might be a fun option for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528688942">Thank you Sandra. It helped to read your attachment and post. The situation is temporary and I want to get through this with Sky who is only six still feeling valued and connected to us. I&#39;m feeling scattered and overwhelmed with the challenge, however I think we can get through this without sending her to school hopefully. Unless that&#39;s what she wants. I have 1 child in high school by his choice and 1 that left high school by her choice. I need to keep reading and pull out your book again.:) love that book! You were at a library near us and we had to miss both dates. I was pretty bummed about that, would be lovely to meet you in person.<br/>

<br/>
This might seem a departure, but it&#39;s evidence of a choice, which must be evidence of thought.  Your e-mail address is &quot;freedomlearning.&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s possible that you&#39;ve come to believe and communicate that school is not freedom, or that the only way to value a child is to homeschool.  You might be in a trap of your own making.<br/>
<br/>
A philosophical stance can harm a family, and a child.  <br/>

So does my husband. When my son was little, my husband worked second shift or overnight. I worked early. My son and I stayed up really late while Dad was working, so the two of them would sleep in late in the morning. This also meant half my work day was done before they got out of bed. By the time I got home, they had woken up and relaxed (coffee for hubby), and were ready to go out or do fun family things.</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_5148" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_5205" dir="ltr"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_4969" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_4968" style="font-family:HelveticaNeue, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Arial, Lucida Grande, sans-serif;font-size:16px;"> <div id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_4967" dir="ltr"> <hr id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_4975" size="1">  <font id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_4966" face="Arial" size="2"> <b id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_5207"><span id="ygrps-yiv-1691938368yui_3_16_0_1_1433087326587_5206" style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> &quot;Heather Bruga freedomlearning@...
