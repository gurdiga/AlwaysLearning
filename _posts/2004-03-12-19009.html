<div id="ygrps-yiv-563064006">My son will be 6 next week and he went through a time from about 4 <br/>
1/2 to 5 when we went to a &quot;very highly recommended&quot; private <br/>
preschool, WRONG - this teacher had all these ideas that just <br/>
because my child refused to do exactly what the other kids were <br/>
doing or what she told them to do, or sat in his seat properly, or <br/>
his eyes wondered off his page, etc etc etc that he most definately <br/>
HAD to be ADD and I should get him professional treatment(ie drugs <br/>
or reconditioning) for his own benefit, of course. That was a <br/>
nightmare for me but in the end it was also one of my biggest <br/>
eyeopeners about how the public system mostly works. Now I am lucky <br/>
enough to know that my child is wonderful healthy and as normal as <br/>
need be! <br/>
Unschooling (or whatever you want to call it) seems to deminish most <br/>
of the qualities of this ADD/ADHD disease, and now I truely believe <br/>
that it is only another label or excuse or money-making idea and not <br/>
something that truely deserves our taking hold of it as a real <br/>
thing. That being said I do believe that allergies are real and if <br/>
you have concern with a certain food you could try and remove that <br/>
food from your child&#39;s diet and see if the situation improves for <br/>
you. I don&#39;t recommend the feingold diet because it will drive <br/>
everyone more insane than needs be. I believe also that what may be <br/>
seen as an alergy is actually a deficiency of something needed to <br/>
properly digest the food in question (like needing lactace to digest <br/>
the milk sugar lactose, like in the suppliment lactaid I believe) So <br/>
sometimes a well balanced diet can make a difference. It is very big <br/>
debate because allergy people say that you crave things that you are <br/>
allergic to, but some people also say that you crave things that <br/>
give you the vitamins and minerals your body naturally need. I let <br/>
my son eat what he wants and I try to give him as healthy of options <br/>
as possible, but he also does help me do the shopping as well. <br/>
We did several horrible weeks of allergy trials with no difference <br/>
in behavior, other than being grouchier than normal because he <br/>
couldn&#39;t eat the foods that he preferred. I wouldn&#39;t really <br/>
recommend it to anyone, they do have professional allergy tests that <br/>
I think would be less excrutiating. We also tried some of <br/>
the &quot;Natural suppliments&quot; some of them made him sick or &quot;wired&quot; and <br/>
a couple of them perhaps helped a tiny bit but were hard to get him <br/>
to take because he still refuses to take tablets and notices the <br/>
taste of drops in anything! I believe the protein suppliments did <br/>
the most good and I still do make sure breakfast is a high protein <br/>
meal, but otherwise we didn&#39;t get any &quot;miracle&quot; results, and we <br/>
tried a lot of different things, spending a lot of $ and lots of <br/>
time reading books on the subject. <br/>
I think that &quot;letting go&quot; of my perfect parental expectaions of my <br/>
son has helped me the most to get past the ADD thing. If he needs to <br/>
run or be active then try and find a way for him to do that in an <br/>
acceptable way, like sports or jogging together, walking the dog, <br/>
etc. I now am really starting to believe that most of the time my <br/>
son does know what he needs and I simply need to help him get it, or <br/>
stay out of his way while he gets it himself.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-697815424">I agree that Feingold can turn kids into neurotic eaters! It happened to my<br/>
dd!<br/>
<br/>
However, when it comes to the allergies/ food sensitivities I think<br/>
eliminating the allergen can help a lot (I&#39;m not specifically referring to<br/>
ADD). I saw my dd&#39;s behavoiur get so explosive that people&#39;s reactions to<br/>
her were affecting her self-esteem. This really concerned me. Also she was<br/>
so HIGHLY sensitive to sounds and textures that it was really affecting her<br/>
daily life. Since being off soy she is no longer covering her ears half the<br/>
day and freaking out because the seam of her sock is off by half a<br/>
millimeter. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think its the answer for all kids but when your child seems *angry*<br/>
most of the time its possible its something in their environment.<br/>
