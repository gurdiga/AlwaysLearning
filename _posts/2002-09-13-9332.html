&lt;&lt; My deal. I gave her more flour and told her<br/>
 sorry for not listening right away.  &gt;&gt;<br/>

That is really great! <br/>
Here&#39;s how I see it, they ask for something that you know will result in a <br/>
not so great end product. You can tell them what you think might happen and <br/>
then let them go ahead. What kind of experiments would parent&#39;s try to create <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; them the very thing they are experimenting with all on their own.<br/>
She&#39;ll find out why things get dry if you add too much flour, how cool!<br/>
The school at home parent would pay money to create such and experiment. And <br/>
the mess? I look at that as part of the price of the &quot;unschooling <br/>
curriculum&quot;. lol<br/>
