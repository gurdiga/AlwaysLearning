I think my favorite old read was a parenting book my mother got when she<br/>
was pregnant with my sister.  It had great information on breastfeeding,<br/>
for the most part, but the other stuff (diet, hygene, dress, etc.) was<br/>
just too much.  I laughed all the way through it.  The assumption was<br/>
the pregnant woman was married and a stay at home mom.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a 1940something planned parenthood book.  That&#39;s even better.<br/>
<br/>
I now say:<br/>
My favourite was the catholic guide to being married which they gave out in<br/>
New Zealand at the end of the 80&#39;s. We didn&#39;t take it at all seriously but<br/>
it caused great hilarity at dinner parties for many years.<br/>
