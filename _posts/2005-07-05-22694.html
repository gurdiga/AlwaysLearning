But on  the other hand, I have a new computer.   I was used to my old one  <br/>
(and <br/>
its father before it &lt;g&gt;).   I was frustrated that it  didn&#39;t have the same <br/>
&quot;recent documents&quot; feature, and that an add-on I had  before (WorkStrip) <br/>
didn&#39;t <br/>
do what IT used to do.    How would I  ever find my files?    And Sherlock, <br/>
even <br/>
SHERLOCK didn&#39;t do  what it used to do.   Oh, I was sad.    Then I figured <br/>
out  <br/>
that the regular old &quot;find&quot; feature that used to not find much will now  find <br/>
ANYTHING and everything, no matter how badly named.  &lt;g&gt;   (Almost.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*****Not all that many years ago, when I was first separated and money an  <br/>
even bigger issue than usual (meaning, I didn&#39;t have a computer) I went to the  <br/>
library and discovered they had replaced the card catalog with a computer  <br/>
system.  I was SO upset.  The kind librarian was right there to walk  people <br/>
through the steps, but I had never even done a mouse, so you can imagine  how slow <br/>
and confused I was behaving right there for everyone to see.  I  found I was <br/>
whining and moaning and bemoaning the good old days with the card  catalog.  <br/>
Then I came home and thought about how many years I might have  yet to live and <br/>
how much change there will be, even in areas I love, like the  library.  <br/>
Slowly, I learned to use the computer, got one of my own, and now  don&#39;t know what <br/>
I&#39;d do without it.  The one thing you can count on is  change, and why is it <br/>
such a difficult concept to incorporate???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, those big solid-looking wood boxes with their hundreds of little<br/>
cubby/drawers holding the cards -- so many mysteries to be discovered.<br/>
<br/>
But I didn&#39;t like the typeface they usually used on the cards.  I<br/>
wanted to open those drawers and find lots of secret little notes and<br/>
pockets and envelopes, not a typeface that looked like the somber face<br/>
of one of those shushy types of librarians.<br/>

   They matched the furniture, in the older days.<br/>
<br/>
I liked them, though.   I liked the accidental discoveries of things next to <br/>
what I was looking for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a term for that principle and I can&#39;t think of it, but it points to <br/>
what made it easier for new typists who did NOT play piano to become fast and <br/>
accurate, while the piano players had to teach their old fingers new tricks.    <br/>
My fingers were fast and could cross over and knew RIGHT WHERE the black keys <br/>
were.    None of that helped on the typewriter,   I was NOT accustomed to <br/>
reaching down.   I had no muscles or coordination for that.   And with <br/>
typewriters you never &quot;cross over&quot; in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Last week I messed with Garage Band, a program that&#39;s on the new iMacs.   <br/>
Because I don&#39;t have a MIDI for this yet (have one for my IIsi, but no swift <br/>
modern UBS-port thing), I was using the keyboard to play music.   ut<br/>

It&#39;s painful to find out that our prior knowledge is wrong or useless.<br/>
<br/>
Already knowing something seems to make it harder, sometimes, to learn new things.<br/>
<br/>
Kids seem to adapt to new technologies faster than adults.  My son can do all kind of tricks with our satellite and Tivo that I don&#39;t think I&#39;d have ever figured out (without him to lead me).  I suppose that our expectations, that come from older experiences, somehow trip us up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-376862792">SORRY, sent too soon.<br/>
<br/>
So I was using the keyboard and there was a little chart there to say which <br/>
letters (middle row) were which notes, and which third-row letters were which <br/>
&quot;black keys,&quot; and all was fine,   and I was doing okay EXCEPT when the g or h <br/>
keys were to be played.   Then I got screwed up.    <br/>
<br/>
It was really interesting, because I &quot;type right&quot; (formal typing-class <br/>
which-finger-where stuff), and I would ordinarily have used thumbs on the piano, but <br/>
my thumbs are trained (like dogs not allowed on the couch) NOT to touch <br/>
anything but the space bar.   <br/>
<br/>
Negative something.<br/>
The term is &quot;negative&quot; something, I think.   You have to unlearn what you <br/>
knew before.<br/>
