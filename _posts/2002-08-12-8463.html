We really love my son&#39;s martial arts teacher.  He&#39;s a great guy, he&#39;s a<br/>
great instructor, the class is great, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just feeling like he hasn&#39;t adequately prepared the three blue belts<br/>
going for their purple belt test on Wednesday.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s recently spent a lot of time with the large group of yellow belts<br/>
testing for orange, and his brown belt who will be testing for black. <br/>
But this little group of blue belts seems to have been left out of the<br/>
loop. <br/>
<br/>
Now, because my son is one of the blue belts,(ten years old, the other<br/>
two are 13 and 14)  I&#39;m wondering if I&#39;m just being one of those horrible<br/>
&quot;sports&quot; parents.   <br/>
<br/>
They received their requirements sheet last Monday, had a substitute<br/>
teacher last Wednesday, who wasn&#39;t sure about some of the requirements,<br/>
and now have one class left before the test.  ( This is Karate, by the<br/>
way )    <br/>
<br/>
So, he wouldn&#39;t be testing them if he didn&#39;t think they were ready, but<br/>
it seems some of the  kids could use a little brushing up on all the<br/>
previous requirements that aren&#39;t presented often in their classes these<br/>
days.  From the instructors point of view maybe this is part of the test?<br/>
 Seeing how many will ready themselves?<br/>
<br/>
I was going to yell at him last week but he wasn&#39;t there.  I&#39;m just<br/>
wondering if I should yell at him today before the test on Wednesday, or<br/>
wait till after, or skip it entirely and find someone else to yell at.<br/>

Has anyone at that school ever failed a belt test?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re entirely formalities.<br/>

I know of two students in three years who didn&#39;t get the promotions they<br/>
were going for, but mainly he just tells the student&#39;s if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
think they&#39;re ready and asks if they want to wait a while to test.  <br/>
Thank you bringing that up.<br/>
It turns out I didn&#39;t yell at him, but Dylan was anxious and asking a lot<br/>
of questions and expressing his concern that he might not be too fresh on<br/>
some things and they talked for a while and Dylan felt more confident<br/>
after that.  <br/>
So tomorrow is the big test.  It&#39;s three hours long, which seems horrible<br/>
to me, but Dylan says he&#39;s ready after all.   We&#39;ll see how it goes.<br/>
