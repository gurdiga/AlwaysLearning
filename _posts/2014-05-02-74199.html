<div dir='ltr'>Talk to you daughter about the dynamic that you have seen between her and her friend. &nbsp;Help her identify the warning signs that she is nearing needing a break so she can tell you. &nbsp;She may need her break alone or with you or her brother, so the friend may need to have some alone time or do something special with you.<div><br></div><div>I would also broach the topic with the friend, what would she like to do when some time apart would be helpful. &nbsp;She may feel even more trapped because she is &quot;stuck&quot; at your house but needing her own space. &nbsp;Could she go home for a couple of hours to hang out by herself? &nbsp;I know my 11 year old cherishes the time he gets alone in the house.</div><div><br></div><div>Lots of real roommates (and life partners) have to figure these things out too, so it can be part of the roommate theme with them. &nbsp;Is there a guest room where the friend can move to occasionally to go &quot;on vacation?&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>This family and your kids are lucky to have such a thoughtful friend!</div><div><br></div><div>Katie</div> 		 	   		  </div>
