<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380229320">-=- I REALLY thought I knew what might help when I took my daughter out of school seven years ago. And taking her out of school was a huge START. I joined and read some unschooling lists and couldn&#39;t believe what people were writing. It wasn&#39;t that I thought anyone was rude, but that what they were suggesting was so...different! It seemed pretty far out there... . I got off the unschooling lists because it was just too much to take in! It was radical! But ...<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;m happy for my almost grown child that I made the effort to change, to stop listening to the conventional world. I wasted time insisting it was okay to just do part of it, or most of it for a while longer. And I held on to my exceptions because our situation was &quot;a little different&quot;, and you people wouldn&#39;t quite understand if I tried to explain it to you. Well, that was then. Now I can say that you (the list owners and the other really wise people who participate) - Thank You! You DO know.-=-<br/>
