My 12yo son recently asked me &quot;what *is* algebra?&quot;, and not wanting to lead<br/>
him down the garden path, I looked it up and gave him the definition from<br/>
the online MW dictionary: &quot;a generalization of arithmetic in which letters<br/>
representing numbers are combined according to the rules of arithmetic&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He paused for a few seconds, and then said &quot;Oh, I do that playing Magic [the<br/>
gathering].&quot;  smiled and walked off.<br/>
<br/>
So there you go; maybe a few decks of Magic cards are the ticket for now?<br/>

<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
My kids &quot;do algebra&quot; without having letters represent numbers, by doing it in <br/>
English.   <br/>
<br/>
If a video game is $50, it will take more weeks of Holly&#39;s allowance at $7.50 <br/>
than it will of Marty&#39;s at $9.75, but if they partner up and go together...<br/>
<br/>
Variables don&#39;t have to be letters representing numbers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also if we use two pounds of beef for the family on a regular night, <br/>
and we have three extra kids over, we need three pounds of beef.  But the <br/>
addition of those three make a total of five teenaged boys.  Make it four <br/>
pounds.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Now that you mention it, we do that all the time here too. I just felt like<br/>
I had to look up a definition for him because I still have residual<br/>
math-fear, left over from junior high school, where I didn&#39;t make it past<br/>
pre-algebra (what ever *that* is).  I took a deep breath when he was little<br/>
and told myself that we could figure this stuff out together and that I<br/>
didn&#39;t have to &quot;be behind&quot; anymore.  There&#39;s still a bunch of stuff I don&#39;t<br/>
know though.  and not just about math...<br/>
<br/>
What was cool to me though, was that he totally groked it.<br/>

<br/>
Linda Wyatt came up with Algebra is figuring out what you don&#39;t know from<br/>
what you do know. Which *anyone* can do whether their eyes glaze over at the<br/>
sight of x + 2 = y or not :-)<br/>
<br/>
Wish I had similarly pithy definitions for calculus, trigonometry and<br/>
differential equations. I could manipulate all the equations like a champ<br/>
since they were all just pattern identification to me. But I never really<br/>
got a grasp of what they were, even if I did have to actually use them in<br/>
engineering ;-)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Why does she want to do algebra? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea.<br/>
<br/>
OK, I have some ideas &lt;gg&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
1) She wants to go to college and knows she will need to do some to get there<br/>
2) She wants to know everything her friends know<br/>
3) She is generally interested in most things<br/>
4) She likes the feeling of tangible accomplishment she get when she works <br/>
through the books.<br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with me, that&#39;s for sure. Some of our conversations when <br/>
doing this (she usually wants me to sit and do it with her) have been very <br/>
funny:<br/>
<br/>
Me: OK, you clearly understand that, just skip the rest of the page<br/>
Her: No, I have to do every problem on the page<br/>
Me: No you don&#39;t<br/>
Her: Well, I like to <br/>
Me: I&#39;m going to read email, call me when you&#39;re done<br/>
<br/>
Lately, she&#39;s been skipping on faster - whew.<br/>

<br/>
Less that 50%<br/>
<br/>
Ratio of kind-of 5:3, and then I think no, 11:6  No, 21:12<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t turn to a recognizeable proportion and so I quit caring! <br/>
<br/>
I have a vague picture of an inverse fraction equation swimming to mind, and <br/>
could fill it in with known numbers to make a formula and put those other <br/>
numbers in, but I have no objection to division of labor and for the effort <br/>
it takes to make some mathie a cup of tea I could get the answer.<br/>
<br/>
Or I&#39;d go online and ask someone else, if it were some big, hard problem I <br/>
couldn&#39;t figure out.  <br/>
<br/>
A friend (old friend from jr. high and high school) is some kind of genius, <br/>
makes a BUNCH of money (re-made an antique silver teaspoon for someone last <br/>
week--it had gone down the garbage disposal and the bowl folded into a wad <br/>
like chewing gum, and for $250.00 he caused it to appear it never had done <br/>
so), but can&#39;t write.  He does analysis of <br/>
antiquities--thousands-of-years-old Chinese swords.  Stone carvings from <br/>
central America.  He does spectral analysis and chemical forensics and blah <br/>
de blah stuff I will never fathom, but he can&#39;t write very well.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a musician and knows how to do all kinds of recording-studio <br/>
technicalities, and he&#39;s made a CD of music involving a friend of ours, a <br/>
bass player, who died.  I couldn&#39;t have begun to do ANY of that, but I did <br/>
edit his liner notes.  It was cool, because of the 20 or so people named in <br/>
the history of the projects, I knew all but three or four very personally and <br/>
long term.  <br/>
<br/>
I worked two hours on writing up the errors and problems and explaining <br/>
alternate choices for phrasing to clean it up and make it consistent in tense <br/>
and tone with the rest of it.  He was really happy.<br/>
<br/>
We as parents sometimes forget, I think, that even if &quot;all&quot; one person can do <br/>
is repair  picture frames, there is a real need in the world for picture <br/>
frame repair.  It would become furniture repair, too, and maybe the creation <br/>
of prostheses or &quot;dental appliances&quot; or jewelry or...<br/>
<br/>
We sometimes see the school-highway and forget the truly interesting <br/>
side-trails.<br/>
<br/>
When I was editing writing about musicians and my friend Robert&#39;s life, I was <br/>
an expert, for a little while, on something obscure.   Some people are <br/>
obscure-math experts.  I never will be.  But I&#39;m good with spelling and <br/>
punctuation.  I can get a flyer or a program or a newsletter done and out. <br/>
<br/>
School says everyone has to know everything.  It never happens, NEVER, but <br/>
they never quit saying it anyway.    Any high school senior who doesn&#39;t know <br/>
every subject is a failure.  They  might graduate, but they&#39;re reminded that <br/>
they &quot;almost didn&#39;t&quot; or &quot;bottom of the class&quot; or &quot;with C&#39;s&quot; or whatever.  And <br/>
they probably know more than many who graduated high with A&#39;s, because they <br/>
were pursuing life instead of doing so much homework.<br/>

OK&lt; I used a calcultaor.<br/>
42 boys + 24 girls = 66 kids<br/>
the % of boys in the class is 63.6%<br/>
42/66=63.6 or 64%<br/>
If there are 64% boys, there must be 36% girls. The difference percentage<br/>
wise is 28% (64% - 36% = 28%)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was my point exactly!  <br/>
<br/>
The answer they want is 75%.<br/>
<br/>
42-24=18 there are 18 more boys than girls.  I took 18/42 x 100 because that would give me the percent more boys.<br/>
<br/>
To get 75% you need to take 18/24 x 100 but that would give the percent of girls they would need to increase the girls by to equal the boys.  These are two different things.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately exposure to stupid things like this helps kids that will need to take tests in or for college.  I think. ??????  Or maybe they don&#39;t have badly worded questions at that level?<br/>

so that&#39;s 64% of the total kids. 24 are girls, so that&#39;s 36% of the total <br/>
kids. Therefore, there are 28% more boys than girls. The difference between <br/>
64 and 36. Am I missing something?<br/>

<br/>
When dh and I were building our deck, he was able to figure out how to keep the thing square with some math he remembered.  I didn&#39;t have a clue!!!!!  I&#39;m realizing, now that I am getting back into math on my own, what he did was not all that complicated.   <br/>
<br/>
My MIL and SIL were math majors.  MIL was a statistics major and SIL got an engineering degree but they said they couldn&#39;t work in those fields because they were too boring.  It is not math aptitude women lack.  It is *possibly* interest in math related areas that a lot of women lack.<br/>
<br/>
The math part of the problem was easy.  What Dan used to figure it out was his training in problem solving.  His first thought was &quot;what answer were they looking for&quot;.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it helps to change it into a problem that you can see the answer to.<br/>
<br/>
If there were 2 boys and 1 girl, how many percent more boys than girls are<br/>
there?<br/>
<br/>
Then test your theory with some other number combinations that are obvious.<br/>
0&#39;s, 1&#39;s and 2&#39;s can give you false clues so it&#39;s always a good idea to test<br/>
it with numbers that aren&#39;t even but that are obvious enough to still let<br/>
you see the pattern developing.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it&#39;s a dumb question. It&#39;s not the type of information someone<br/>
would generally want to know from that kind of situation. So that makes it<br/>
hard to figure out because the answer doesn&#39;t really mean anything. (One of<br/>
the hazards of learning math from textbooks.) Someone might want to know<br/>
something like:<br/>
<br/>
* what percentage of the total the boys were<br/>
* how many more boys than girls<br/>
* the ratio of boys to girls<br/>
<br/>
I suppose someone could come up with a reason for wanting to know the<br/>
percent more boys than girls, but it just isn&#39;t information someone would<br/>
normally ask for.<br/>
<br/>
Usually when you want to know what percentage more, it is in the context of<br/>
packaging or price, like that store&#39;s price is 10% more than this store&#39;s<br/>
price or you get 20% more (than the regular size) for free.<br/>
<br/>
I *think* the problem is the same as asking if the 42 ounce package is the<br/>
same price as the 24 ounce package then what percent more are you getting<br/>
free?<br/>
<br/>
So if it&#39;s 2 lbs for the price of 1 lb, you&#39;re getting 1 pound free which is<br/>
100% of the regular 1 lb package, so 100% *more* free. (Not, of course the<br/>
same as 100% free!) If it&#39;s 3 lbs for the price of 2 lbs you&#39;re getting 1<br/>
pound free which is 50% of the regular 2 pounds, so it&#39;s 50% more free.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s the amount you&#39;re getting free (how much larger the bigger package<br/>
is than the regular one) divided by the regular size: (42-24)/42 = 18/24 =<br/>
.75 or 75% more for free.<br/>
