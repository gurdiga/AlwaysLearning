<div id="ygrps-yiv-1671593166">A few years ago I used to read and post on the Unschooling.com (I think) forum, which had Sandra Dodd posting frequently.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to find that forum and read and post there, vs using the yahoogroups.  Is that still possible?<br/>
<br/>

The archives are still there but the most frequent posters are  <br/>
spammers. (We catch them before they appear, but still ...) The board  <br/>
was down with technical problems for a month or so and people drifted  <br/>
away and never drifted back when it returned.<br/>
<br/>
It could be The Radical Unschoolers Network started up at that time  <br/>
and that filled the gap with a lot more style :-) It&#39;s a fairly  <br/>
lively place with message boards, groups, personal pages, blogs and  <br/>
familiar faces :-)<br/>
