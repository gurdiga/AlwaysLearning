<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897922424">I hope this question isn&#39;t too subtle or nit-picky.  It kinda feels that way<br/>
to me.  This is something I&#39;ve been thinking about for months, though, and I<br/>
pondered it a lot yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Where is the line where an interaction between parent and child crosses into<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;?  Does it just have to do with the motivation/agenda of the<br/>
parent in any given scenario?  Or is there some other defining detail in the<br/>
exchange?  And sorry this is so long.lacking personal clarity on this<br/>
subject, I&#39;m using a lot of words.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we were getting in our hot tub, my 3.5 year old son and I.  He<br/>
loves playing in the hot tub so spends several hours a week in there.  Even<br/>
through the summer, I kept it maintained with the temp about 99 or 100 so it<br/>
was still nice to be in there.  Before getting in yesterday, I said, &quot;let&#39;s<br/>
go down to the playroom in the basement and get some toys for the hot tub&quot;.<br/>
We looked around a bit, and one of the things I grabbed was a clear plastic<br/>
shoebox-sized storage container without lid.  Initially I saw the box as a<br/>
potential boat to hold toys journeying on the ocean, and it could also be<br/>
attacked by toy dinos to capsize it, etc.  Or it could just be an island in<br/>
the middle of the ocean. <br/>
<br/>
Once in the tub, I discovered many other fun things to do with it, that I<br/>
hadn&#39;t been thinking about when I picked it up since I hadn&#39;t realized how<br/>
optically clear the box was.  I was having fun playing with air and water,<br/>
for example holding the empty box on the surface and looking through the<br/>
bottom to clearly see under the water, like a glass-bottomed boat.  Or<br/>
holding it under the water upside-down with about a golf-ball-sized air<br/>
bubble in it and rocking it around, kinda using the box as a &quot;level&quot; and<br/>
seeing if I could get the bubble to the exact middle of the smooth flat<br/>
upturned bottom (I couldn&#39;t.the bubble would split into pieces every time).<br/>
<br/>
Another example: we also had a nalgene bottle in the tub, and I would hold<br/>
the clear plastic box, completely full of water, upside down under the<br/>
water, and it was pretty much neutrally buoyant, then I&#39;d fill the nalgene<br/>
bottle with air and &quot;empty&quot; the air from the bottle, under water, into the<br/>
box, causing the box to float to the top.<br/>
 <br/>
As I was playing, I was sharing &quot;facts&quot; with my son.  &quot;See, if you go under<br/>
now, and blow air up into the submerged box, the air from your lungs gets<br/>
captured in the box.  And now, if I flip the box over, your air bubbles will<br/>
finally come to the surface.  But they&#39;ve been trapped under the box for a<br/>
while.&quot;  And he was playing right along, enjoying just floating the empty<br/>
box on the surface and holding his toys under the water, and seeing how<br/>
clear they looked, or saying &quot;Daddy, ok to do that again?&quot; and diving again<br/>
to exhale into the upturned box.  None of it was un-fun, and at no time did<br/>
I tell him &quot;do this&quot;.I was just passing time, sipping a beer and playing<br/>
with the &quot;toys&quot; in the tub, offering ideas for more fun.  At no time did I<br/>
say, &quot;no, do it *this* way&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
But I kept pausing, feeling uncomfortably like I had crossed into taking<br/>
advantage of a &quot;teachable moment&quot;.  All the things we were doing were things<br/>
that anyone could discover on their own by playing with containers in the<br/>
water.  I didn&#39;t have an agenda of &quot;teach him this today, to build on<br/>
something tomorrow.&quot;  I felt more like a good friend of mine who&#39;s very<br/>
savvy about many different topics because he&#39;s had many different jobs over<br/>
the years, ranging from general contractor building eco homes to chef to<br/>
living in a van on the interstate keeping big trucks running, who interjects<br/>
little factoids into any conversation, and I love it.  I could just hear<br/>
him, sitting in the tub with us, saying, &quot;if you hold the bottle, filled<br/>
with water, upside down and let the spa jets blow air bubbles into it until<br/>
all the water is displaced, you could submit that air sample for analysis<br/>
and they could tell you about the health of your pump&quot; or something similar.<br/>
He doesn&#39;t do those things to be know-it-all.he&#39;s not out-of-touch or<br/>
over-the-top like Norm on Cheers with his &quot;little-known facts&quot;.  Plus I<br/>
wasn&#39;t getting that detailed with my son, and he wasn&#39;t offering resistance<br/>
to anything we were doing.  So what I was doing felt like Strewing in many<br/>
ways, except there was lots of talking.not just putting the box in the tub<br/>
and letting play/discovery happen.  And my son wasn&#39;t asking me for help<br/>
with it, nor was I interrupting his own play.  He would see me doing<br/>
something, and hang on my shoulder watching for a bit, then want to join in.<br/>
And sometimes the exact thing I was doing in that moment didn&#39;t look very<br/>
interesting, so he would play with something totally different for a while<br/>
on the other side of the 8-person tub.<br/>
<br/>
At one point I played with the nalgene bottle for a half-hour, by myself.  I<br/>
was trying to make it exactly neutrally buoyant, with just the right size of<br/>
small air bubble, so the bottle would neither bob to the top nor bounce off<br/>
the bottom unless &quot;thrown&quot; that direction.  Completely neutral (it was<br/>
harder than I thought it would be).  My son wasn&#39;t even involved in that<br/>
because I don&#39;t think it looked too interesting to him.I was just loosening<br/>
the lid again and again, above water or under water, making tiny adjustments<br/>
to the ratio of air and water, over-correcting one direction and having to<br/>
start all over again.<br/>
<br/>
To help me tease apart the subtleties of this topic, would anyone be willing<br/>
to give me a few different short specific &quot;scripts&quot; of how the scenario<br/>
could play out with the clear container and nalgene bottle in the tub,<br/>
ranging from &quot;not teaching at all, just letting learning happen and being<br/>
there to facilitate&quot; to &quot;maybe teaching&quot; to &quot;definitely teaching so<br/>
potentially harmful&quot;?  Is learning always less valuable if it is &quot;shown&quot; to<br/>
a child, vs. letting them discover from their own experience as they<br/>
undoubtedly would at some point?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  -=b.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s probably the point where the question starts.  You weren&#39;t  <br/>
answering his questions, you were narrating a demonstration, it seems.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that&#39;s fine, and I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll play those things out later  <br/>
with other toys, whether he remembers what you said or not.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;So what did I say?&quot; would be harmful, because you would turn  <br/>
a conversation into a test. But you didn&#39;t do that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is learning always less valuable if it is &quot;shown&quot; to a child, vs.  <br/>
letting them discover from their own experience as they undoubtedly  <br/>
would at some point?-=-<br/>
<br/>
My first answer is &quot;no&quot; and my second answer is &quot;sometimes&quot; but you  <br/>
asked &quot;always.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I learned a lot of hydrodynamics from amusing myself in the sink when  <br/>
I was made to do dishes when I was a kid.  We had a percolator to  <br/>
wash, so there was a tube and a strainer basket, both of which are  <br/>
fun.  I figured out all kinds of things to do with putting glasses  <br/>
face down into the water.  Water will overflow if it&#39;s  near the top,  <br/>
and it works the same whether you push the glass down butt-first or  <br/>
head-first, so I figured out it was full of air.  Nobody was there to  <br/>
explain it to me and I just thought about it and kept playing.  For  <br/>
years.  Still. &lt;g&gt;   And I knew you could look for a knife in the  <br/>
bottom of soapy water by putting a glass down in there as a viewer.   <br/>
My mom did show me that one, and she showed me for fun.<br/>
<br/>
I think if you share a fact and he seems interested or asks questions  <br/>
you could share another one.  But to decide in advance to share five  <br/>
or ten regardless of his reaction isn&#39;t conversational or friendly.   <br/>
It&#39;s teacherly, because you had a lesson plan.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I hope this question isn&#39;t too subtle or nit-picky. It kinda feels  <br/>
that way to me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
For people who already have the broader understanding, ALL of their  <br/>
learning happens at the subtle level.   Bring out all the subtle  <br/>
questions you want to!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Where is the line where an interaction between parent and child  <br/>
crosses into<br/>
<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;? Does it just have to do with the motivation/agenda of the<br/>
parent in any given scenario? Or is there some other defining detail  <br/>
in the<br/>
exchange? And sorry this is so long.lacking personal clarity on this<br/>
subject, I&#39;m using a lot of words.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What has helped me is to rephrase any of my questions about teaching  <br/>
and learning so that the verb was always &quot;learning.&quot;  Sometimes it  <br/>
takes a fair amount of rearrangement, and sometimes it can&#39;t be  <br/>
done.  When it can&#39;t be done, just abandon the thought!  (That&#39;s my  <br/>
advice.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Then, though, sometimes an older kid might ask you to explain long  <br/>
division or something, and then you&#39;re in a different situation.   <br/>
Holly asked me to show her (not to teach her how to do it), so I did  <br/>
one real current problem (whatever it was we had been talking about)  <br/>
and there was going to be a remainder/fraction, but I stopped there,  <br/>
because she didn&#39;t need to know that, she needed to know how many of  <br/>
whatever we had.  She watched me to it and I explained as I went (but  <br/>
as quickly as I was going, without stopping and looking to see if she  <br/>
understood; she would&#39;ve stopped me if she wanted me to slow down),  <br/>
and I said &quot;and some left over, and we could figure out exactly how  <br/>
much, but...&quot; and that was all.  She was happy, I hadn&#39;t &quot;done a  <br/>
lesson&quot; and she knows what it looks like.  If she wants more she&#39;ll ask.<br/>

information, and insist he listen while you read what you find?   <br/>

course, you share the world with him.  Think of yourself as a docent  <br/>
in the museum of the world.  You know what the cool exhibits have to  <br/>
offer.  You are also not required to grade the visitor, but to share  <br/>
what you know and help him satisfy his own curiosity.<br/>

An unschooling family continues in the same way, though the 10 y.o. or  <br/>
the teen may become the docent as well.  Live a rich, stimulating  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341775194">This was a really interesting, thought provoking post, and it sounds like a <br/>
lovely time was had by all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pulling out a couple of quotes for my comments.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I was having fun playing&gt;&gt;&gt; snip &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;But I kept pausing, feeling <br/>
uncomfortably like I had crossed into taking<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; advantage of a &quot;teachable moment&quot;.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was the key. You had a gut feeling that interefered with your fun. That <br/>
is the feeling I try to identify and trust when it happens. That is the <br/>
point at which I would back off a bit. It is good to learn about yourself - <br/>
can this kind of activity be a &quot;slippery slope&quot; for you? Being aware of your <br/>
own heart will prevent the slide.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; As I was playing, I was sharing &quot;facts&quot; with my son.  &quot;See, if you go <br/>
under<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; now, and blow air up into the submerged box, the air from your lungs gets<br/>
&gt; captured in the box.  And now, if I flip the box over, your air bubbles <br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; finally come to the surface.  But they&#39;ve been trapped under the box for a<br/>
&gt; while.&quot;  And he was playing right along,&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In a way you got lucky, because what you were showing him was so immensely <br/>
interesting that the lecture portion was accetable to him. It was going a <br/>
bit beyond an honest exclamation of delight or surprise (&quot;oh look at <br/>
that!&quot;), wasn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Part of this is also your child&#39;s temperament. My dd would probably have <br/>
told me to be quiet almost immediately, because my voice would have been <br/>
interfering with her process of discovery. She would much, much rather tell <br/>
me what she was seeing. If I persisted Jayn would have gone away to do <br/>
something else, and a moment of sharing would have been lost.<br/>
<br/>
I believe pretty strongly that every time you tell a child a &quot;fact&quot; like <br/>
this, or direct their observation, or do the movement for them, you deny <br/>
them the opportunity to discover it for themselves. The energy of a child <br/>
being told or shown something really cool is great, the energy of child <br/>
discovering something really cool is stellar.<br/>
<br/>
In a similar to this scenario, such as the bath or the pool at our house, my <br/>
first job is done when I have supplied a number of different objects with <br/>
different properties. Jayn has done almost those exact experiments (and I <br/>
know what you mean about the challenge of the exact neutral density with <br/>
water bottles) in the course of inventing a game of making a &quot;submarine&quot; to <br/>
push between us like catch. The next part of my job is not describing what <br/>
we are seeing, but listening to her tell me what she is discovering.<br/>
<br/>
She has also stood at the kitchen sink on the kitchen stepladder, with many <br/>
containers, bottles, measuring cups, warm water and soap on uncountable <br/>
occasions from the time she was about 18 months old and played water for 2 <br/>
hours at a time. Her intensity would have been interrupted if I were trying <br/>
to give her information. I guess in a way I am disagreeing with Nancy, <br/>
because I believe the younger they are the LESS you should be telling them <br/>
and doing for them in exploration type activities (and aren&#39;t they ALL <br/>
exploration type activities), the more you should be holding your tongue and <br/>
letting them joyously discover these basic laws of physics and chemistry.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no hurry. These physical characteristics of buoancy and liquids <br/>
aren&#39;t going to change any time soon. Trust your feelings.<br/>

lived before.  It&#39;s not the same one (not that I think it could live  <br/>
for years, but it&#39;s smaller), but it has occurred to me that it might  <br/>
be related, y&#39;know...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t let my kids wait their whole lives to maybe discover an  <br/>
albino praying mantis!  But I didn&#39;t give a lecture with photos and  <br/>
explanations of albinism, I just said &quot;HEY, LOOK!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856594187">Brad,<br/>
Thank you, I love this story, and read it avidly.  And it was timely for me.<br/>
My 5yo daughter and I are in a monthly science club, ten families with a<br/>
total of about 12 kids ages about 4-7.  Some of us are unschoolers, and some<br/>
are school-at-home types.  I took my first turn leading science club<br/>
yesterday, and chose SOUND as my theme.  We played &quot;What can you tell about<br/>
this sound?&quot; where I knocked or rubbed various things together in a box<br/>
where they couldn&#39;t see what was making the sound.  They listened to see if<br/>
they could figure out the size, what the pieces were made out of, or any<br/>
other information their ears were picking up.  Then I would unveil the<br/>
items.  We made telephones out of plastic cups and fishing line; little<br/>
stringed instruments out of cans and rubber bands; kazoos out of combs and<br/>
tissue paper; and poppers that make a fun loud bang, out of folded paper.<br/>
 Everyone could choose which projects, if any, they participated in.  And<br/>
playing with the paper poppers turned into me showing a few of them how to<br/>
make and use those paper fortune tellers (aka &quot;cootie catcher&quot; in English,<br/>
and &quot;coin coin&quot; in French).<br/>
<br/>
It was fun, and thus successful, in my opinion, but two school-at-home<br/>
parents had sort of a gently disappointed tone that I didn&#39;t cover<br/>
terminology or discuss the actual science of any of it, other than what was<br/>
actually observable (like I observed out loud that you can touch the fishing<br/>
line and feel the sound go through it while people are talking into it).<br/>
 One on one with the kids and parents, I did answer questions, and some<br/>
terminology did come up that way, for those who were interested, but I<br/>
figured each kid would take what they took from it, and maybe one might be<br/>
still playing his kazoo comb, and wondering why it feels vibrate-y, someone<br/>
else might be running her finger up and down the rubber band and hearing the<br/>
pitch change, or whatever.  I feel really happy that they got to experience<br/>
those things.  And they can take it from there.  Or not.  Or not now.  Or<br/>
yes now.<br/>
<br/>
But I (honestly) feel proud of myself that I feel (mostly) peaceful that I<br/>
didn&#39;t stick terminology and schematics in to make myself feel like it was<br/>
more science-y, and thus value-added.  And I also feel grateful that I can<br/>
groove on the fact that the most universally popular part of the day turned<br/>
out to be the paper fortune teller things, which wasn&#39;t about sound, and<br/>
wasn&#39;t planned.  I see a lot of progress in myself as an unschooler and am<br/>
happy remembering yesterday, as it was.<br/>
<br/>
I really think your description sounds wonderful.<br/>

&gt;   I hope this question isn&#39;t too subtle or nit-picky. It kinda feels that<br/>
&gt; way<br/>
&gt; to me. This is something I&#39;ve been thinking about for months, though, and I<br/>
&gt; pondered it a lot yesterday.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Where is the line where an interaction between parent and child crosses<br/>
&gt; into<br/>
&gt; &quot;teaching&quot;? Does it just have to do with the motivation/agenda of the<br/>
&gt; parent in any given scenario? Or is there some other defining detail in the<br/>
&gt; exchange? And sorry this is so long.lacking personal clarity on this<br/>
&gt; subject, I&#39;m using a lot of words.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yesterday we were getting in our hot tub, my 3.5 year old son and I.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-366231893">This has been the &quot;Summer of Spiders&quot; for us - it will go down in my memory as the Summer of Spiders anyway.  We are calling it that too  - The Summer of Spiders ;)  We have had large spiders making huge webs all over the place.  We have even at times refused to use the front door or back door as there will be a huge web covering the door way - with spidey right in the middle having a snack or spinning his web right in front of our faces!!!!!!  Poor dogs never know which door to ask out at - LOL    We say &quot;OH COOL - anyone want to see another cool spider and web?&quot; Once a web was being built between a tree and our house and an electrical wire.  I stood there speculating/wondering in amazement, out loud, about how the spider could have gotten it all put there in mid air, between those connecting places - by the way does anyone know how they do it ?  There was probably 10 feet between the tree and house.  We&#39;ve lived here for 15 years and this is our first experience with spiders covering our door ways - usually they are tucked into a corner (outside not inside the house) and we have to discover them.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t look up anything at all - we have no idea what type of spiders we are harboring (we know they are not Brown Recluse / very poisonous or they would not be welcome) just the wondering, amazement, and beauty of the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650377452">But you also didn&#39;t necessarily bring them over to the flower, direct their <br/>
attention to the stamens, turn over the leaves and show them how to stroke <br/>
the underside, have them follow the stem down to the roots, compare the <br/>
fragrance (if any) to a bunch of other things. Maybe you collected the spent <br/>
bloom and pulled it open to investigate. I could happily leave that to Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
Making an analogy between &quot;pointing out the flower&quot; and &quot;tub/water play&quot; - <br/>
what you did with the flower was the equivalent of what I do by filling the <br/>
tub with water and popping a bunch of items, toys and containers, into the <br/>
water.<br/>
<br/>
I would say &quot;look at that&quot; about an albino mantis too! That sounds cool. <br/>
Jayn would show me whether she wanted more infomation.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier in the week when we got home, Jayn said &quot;come look at this big <br/>
spider!&quot; It had spun a long web between a 2nd floor balcony and a tree, <br/>
spanning about 15 feet and was sitting in the middle. It was fascinating and <br/>
a bit scary for Jayn. It&#39;s gone now, as we reemerge to the world after <br/>
having our annual conference crud. Yes timely can be important.<br/>

webs and they themselves are pretty big, body size about a dime.  Now,<br/>
they come back to the same spot every year.  One on our bedroom door<br/>
(french doors leading to outside) and one by our front door!  I<br/>
imagine that they must be the previous spiders babies??  Kinda like<br/>
Charolette (from Charolettes Web!)!  We look forward to them every year!<br/>

Is this what yours looks like??<br/>

The internet does a pretty good job, considering the paper letters it  <br/>
replaces!<br/>
<br/>
Kirby has lived in Texas for a year.  If I were having to depend on  <br/>
paper letters, I might only have heard from him three or four times.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing I absolutely and deeply adore about the internet is  <br/>
that a digital photo can be available seconds from the time it is  <br/>
taken, and can be seen by ALL your relatives, all at once, and they  <br/>
can hit print if they want to.   And I can see people brand-new born- <br/>
at-home babies, and kids playing with soap bubbles and toy guns and  <br/>
climbing on cool equipment and babies nursing, and grandparents  <br/>
smiling all twinkly-eyed at unschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
This part is new.<br/>

<br/>
Yes that is what 3 of them look like - the ones making webs across door ways - The one that was ten feet in the air was a bit hard to tell what he was like - but some are different and making different types of webs in other places.  That has been some of the coolness of it.  Also, these spiders have been around since early summer and some we have actually seen them grow.  Well not actually growing at that moment - but can see a day by day difference in their size.<br/>

natural and normal.  And good.<br/>

It sounds totally fun!  And educational.  You can&#39;t beat that.<br/>
