<div id="ygrps-yiv-875170739">**As far as the law is concerned, once that child is adopted, they are equal <br/>
to a birth child.<br/>
The birth certificate is even changed to reflect you as the mother. **<br/>
<br/>
**Somehow I missed this, a week ago (nearly).<br/>
<br/>
That would be falsification of documents.  Jesus.  I don&#39;t doubt some state <br/>
is doing it, but I doubt all states are doing it.**<br/>
<br/>
All states are doing it. Many change not only the names, but places and other <br/>
information as well. What&#39;s more, in most of these United States, the <br/>
original birth certificate is &quot;sealed&quot;, and the adoptee is not allowed to <br/>
access it without a court order. A very few states now allow adult adoptees <br/>
access to information about their own births, most with the provision that <br/>
the birth parent can veto the access. In Nebraska, an adoptee can get his <br/>
original birth certificate at age 25 if the birth parent has consented UNLESS <br/>
his adoptive parent objects. <br/>
<br/>
From Bastard Nation:<br/>
**Most adult adoptees in the U.S. and Canada are denied legal access to their <br/>
own original birth records and adoption decree. This is not the case in many <br/>
places around the world. In the U.S. and Canada Influential adoption industry <br/>
lobbyists perpetuate bizarre notions of a beneficial &quot;permanent anonymity&quot; <br/>
imposed on all in the adoption experience so as to protect their ability to <br/>
continue acting as a completely unaccountable industry - something unique to <br/>
the adoption industry. **  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bastards.org/activism/">http://www.bastards.org/activism/</a>    <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

I suppose I can see the birth parent saying &quot;I want to be free from this <br/>
until I die.&quot;  I guess.  But for the adoptive parents to have a veto over the <br/>
legal rights of a 25 year old who&#39;s mentally competent seems wrong to me.<br/>
<br/>
I thought there were adoption papers separate from birth certificates.  <br/>
Well!! Then if a kid doesn&#39;t have a birth certificate (as happens here with <br/>
hippie births from the 1970 and 80&#39;s and now lots of those kids are wanting <br/>
passports and have no proof of nationality), he can just be adopted and get a <br/>
brand new birth certificate.<br/>
