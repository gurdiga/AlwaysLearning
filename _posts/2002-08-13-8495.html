&lt;&lt; Are any of us planning to get together at the hsc conference?  I <br/>

<br/>
I hadn&#39;t remembered which list it was planning to get together and was too <br/>
frazzled to remember to ask, so I&#39;m glad this came up!<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll have spoken twice before lunch on Sunday and then be done for <br/>
the weekend.  Maybe I&#39;m wrong... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Last night we checked the schedule of workshops for tweens (after I checked <br/>
and tried to print out the one for children and discovered Holly&#39;s not even <br/>
in that category, at 10, almost 11).  I had been picturing Holly lazing <br/>
around, playing with other kids, swimming (she&#39;s a really good swimmer, which <br/>
is wonderful, since I&#39;m not a swimmer at all).  Looks like she&#39;ll be busier <br/>
than I&#39;ll be!<br/>
<br/>
Sunday lunch, on my list of &quot;must do.&quot;<br/>
But where?  How will we know?  I can&#39;t organize anything like that, I&#39;ll be <br/>
raggedy and probably losing my voice, having fever blisters and a headache.  <br/>
(Just remembering back to conferences in the past.  &lt;g&gt;  Expect me to look <br/>
blank sometimes from exhaustion by that point!)<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s taking her Harry Potter cards, and wanted me to ask other moms to ask <br/>
their kids to take theirs if they want to.   I asked Pam S. to ask on the HSC <br/>
list.<br/>

----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my specialty. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I propose: All of us meet outside the main gate to the pool area (it&#39;s a<br/>
very simple landmark at this hotel, right outside the conference buildings)<br/>
at 12:15 p.m., carrying either a to-go lunch from the hotel, or your own<br/>
cooler-full of food, or whatever you want to eat. :) We&#39;ll gather and mill<br/>
like water buffalo (well, I&#39;ll mill like a water buffalo, the more slender<br/>
amongst us can mill like gazelles &lt;g&gt;) until 12:30 p.m., at which point<br/>
we&#39;ll adjourn to wherever looks shady.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll hold a sign that says &quot;Always Learning&quot; when I&#39;m standing by the main<br/>
gate to the pool (perhaps I&#39;ll receive kindly hand-outs! &lt;g&gt;). I&#39;m the tall<br/>
woman of Amazonian proportions, short brown hair, freckles, probably have my<br/>
glasses on. Permanently goofy expression, can&#39;t miss me.<br/>
<br/>
All in favor? Opposed? Better idea?<br/>

It sounds like a good plan to me, except (wah!)I promised my mom who<br/>
lives outside Sacramento, that she could come by and swoop me away for a<br/>
long lunch at noon on Sunday. I&#39;ll be waiting for her in the hotel<br/>
lobby, and she&#39;s usually not punctual.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to be wearing my new long dress, dark red, covered<br/>
with paisleys, makes me look like a large bundle of Persian carpets. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
On Sunday a.m I&#39;m planning to go see Sandra&#39;s talk in the first slot<br/>
(8am), then Frank Smith, then Pam&#39;s Mathematical Joy part II.  If any of<br/>
you spot me, please come up and say &quot;hi&quot;!  (The words &quot;love the dress&quot;<br/>
are optional &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

That means I can&#39;t see Frank Smith, I think, because we&#39;ll be talking about <br/>
video games elsewhere.  Unless that&#39;s another time.   WAH FOR SURE.<br/>
<br/>
Well...  I would look at the schedule but I&#39;m so tired after having read <br/>
through the childrens and tweens workshops last night I can&#39;t bear to look at <br/>
another list of things I can&#39;t do right now.<br/>

I just thought, we&#39;ll all probably meet each other at Sandra&#39;s talk <br/>
in the am anyway, so we may even know who to look for &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

Hi, Kathy --<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago I ate bad shrimp before going to the conference.  I can<br/>
ASSURE you, based on personal experience, that puking at the conference<br/>
is not any more fun than puking at home. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hope that makes you feel better!  And I hope the morning (or all day)<br/>
sickness passes off soon.<br/>
