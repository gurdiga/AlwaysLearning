<div id="ygrps-yiv-857023415">===Everything I&#39;ve ever known about eating disorders have been about kids<br/>
that I&#39;ve known throughout my life, and what I&#39;ve heard through<br/>
scientific studies and such. It seemed to me the underlying issue<br/>
was/is always about control or trying to find control for oneself. In<br/>
my own head I&#39;m playing out all these ideas and scenarios, intentionally<br/>
not discussing any of it with my daughter until I worked it out in my<br/>
own head through thought and observation of what was going on right in<br/>
front of me.<br/>
<br/>
At any age a kid should be able to decide what and how much and when to<br/>
eat, at 14, they should pretty much have that down. My daughter has<br/>
never been restricted with food, so I decided that she must clearly know<br/>
what she&#39;s doing, especially given that I completely trust her. I<br/>
figured the best thing I could do, as her mom, is to observe and listen,<br/>
make food she likes and offer to make food at any time that she might<br/>
seem hungry. That is what I did. After all many people fast for many<br/>
reasons and live to tell about it!<br/>
<br/>
Fast forward about 2 months, and a whole bunch of unexpected things have<br/>
come out of this. One is that she&#39;s still here and still healthy. She<br/>
doesn&#39;t have an eating disorder just because she chose not to eat much<br/>
if at all. Her food choices became very select, and almost entirely<br/>
whole foods. She learned all about caloric intake, vitamins, fats,<br/>
carbs, and all those other nutrition labeling that is on food, she even<br/>
found info about fruits and meats. In her research about meat, she<br/>
learned all about factory farming and has decided to avoid these things.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s found for herself on a whole new level what it is to push her body<br/>
and find it&#39;s limits, to know really what she NEEDS to eat to survive.. <br/>
Meanwhile alarmists all around me have been trying to tell me that she&#39;s<br/>
got this eating disorder and that she&#39;s anorexic and all sorts of other<br/>
dysfunctional stuff. I&#39;ve pushed those nay sayers out the door to make<br/>
room for my daughter. What I see is a very smart kid who found for<br/>
herself in an unconventional way how and what to eat and took it to a<br/>
level that goes beyond basic nutrition and goes all the way to ethics.<br/>
<br/>
That never would have happened if I hadn&#39;t trusted, if I had listened to<br/>
the alarmists instead of observing and knowing deeply that my daughter<br/>
can and will make good choices if given the chance to. I could have<br/>
done a lot to ruin all that happened. It&#39;s really easy to screw it up,<br/>
it takes a lot to shut up and trust and watch and observe when you see<br/>
your kids do things that trigger alarms.===<br/>
My daughter is 13 and just did the same thing.  Only before I could adjust to her being vegetarian (and we had just stocked up on veggie foods) she became a vegan. :)  Huge mental shift for *me*, the meat eater and junk food king.  But she&#39;s cooking and trying new recipes, and I&#39;m looking for foods she can eat (when not in Whole Foods).  Most of our shopping is done at Whole Foods now.<br/>
