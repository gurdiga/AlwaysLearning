<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176997338">I have heard both good and bad things about Camp Fire USA.  I decided <br/>
to do a little first hand research of my own and find out what they <br/>
were all about.  So I have been in touch with the Executive Director <br/>
of our local Council, to get more information. In the course of our <br/>
correspondence, he sent me some pages from the Leader Guide.  Most of <br/>
it looked pretty good, but I was given pause by certain parts of it.  <br/>
I thought I would share about my concerns here and get some feedback <br/>
from all of you, and also ask for experiences of those who have been <br/>
involved with Camp Fire, before I discuss this with my Camp Fire <br/>
contact.<br/>
<br/>
The Section that gave me pause is titled: Camp Fire USA Builds <br/>
Developmental Assets<br/>
<br/>
It begins by talking about the results and findings of a study done <br/>
by the Search Institute, in the 1990s, which identified asset <br/>
building as a focus for youth development instead of problem <br/>
solving.  OK, I can get with that, being as I see prevention as <br/>
better than bandages in general.  They go on to say that they have <br/>
identified 14 assets in the Camp Fire program that they believe help <br/>
youth to develop.  OK, so they are earmarking positives in their <br/>
program, that&#39;s ok.  <br/>
<br/>
But the next part starts to get creepy, and reads like a recipe for <br/>
cooking up wonderful adults, as though it&#39;s a fool proof plan.  Here <br/>
are the 14 assets:<br/>
<br/>
-Young Person has empathy, sensitivity and friendship  <br/>
-Young person has knowledge of and comfort with people of different <br/>
cultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds<br/>
(ok, so far so good)<br/>
-Young person serves the community 1 or more hours per week<br/>
(whoa, what does this mean?  What counts as community service?  Is <br/>
the age of the child considered?  I think community service is a <br/>
great thing and I encourage it, but I don&#39;t like being involved in a <br/>
program where my child is REQUIRED to do it to meet some objective <br/>
set by the group.)<br/>
<br/>
-Young person receives support from 3 or more non-parent adults<br/>
(ok, that sounds good)<br/>
-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in lessons or practice <br/>
in music, theater or other arts<br/>
(whoa again, mandatory minimum time duration on arts?  What counts <br/>
according to them?  What if my child is not classically artistic, or <br/>
goes through a phase where they are not?)<br/>
<br/>
-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in sports, clubs, and <br/>
organizations at school or in the community<br/>
(whoa again!  Mandatory involvement in hobbies and recreational <br/>
sports?  If they said, young person is encouraged to do this or that, <br/>
ok.  If they said they feel it is important, ok.  But just saying <br/>
that they spend X amount of hours per week is so arbitrary and <br/>
controlling to me.)<br/>
<br/>
-Young person is out with friends with &quot;nothing special to do&quot; two or <br/>
fewer nights per week.<br/>
(What??  Does that mean they think all their time should be planned <br/>
and scheduled, even for teenagers?  Does that mean we are not <br/>
supposed to trust our children&#39;s judgement in general about how they <br/>
spend their time?)<br/>
							<br/>
The rest sounds good<br/>
-Young person can resist negative peer pressure and dangerous <br/>
situations<br/>
-Young person seeks to resolve conflict nonviolently<br/>
-Young person knows how to plan ahead and make choices<br/>
-Young person feels that he or she &quot;has control over things that <br/>
happen to me.&quot;<br/>
-Young person reports having high self esteem.<br/>
-Young person reports that &quot;my life has a purpose.&quot;<br/>
-Young person is optimistic about his or her personal future<br/>
<br/>
But then this &quot;All of the Camp Fire USA&#39;s curricula are outcome <br/>
based.  Forty Camp Fire outcomes were identified to develop these <br/>
assets.  These outcomes guide all projects, programs and <br/>
recognitions.  The outcomes are in the appendix and referenced <br/>
throughout the grade level program books.  This makes it easy to know <br/>
if you are using the Camp Fire activities and projects as designed, <br/>
the children will be experiencing the outcomes that will make them <br/>
caring, confident youth and future leaders.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As a passionate Unschooler/Natural Learner how many ways can I say <br/>
ick?  Curricula?  Grade levels?  Outcome based? Am I just looking at <br/>
this the wrong way or not understanding what they are trying to say?<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When children and youth <br/>
join Camp Fire, they start at the level appropriate to their grade.&quot;  <br/>
Is this program totally geared toward the institutional schooling <br/>
system, and would we be totally out of place?  I don&#39;t really want to <br/>
separate my children out into narrow band age groups.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
it is socially good for them.  I am one of those who is of the <br/>
opinion that institutional schooling is intrinsically bad for the <br/>
human mind and spirit, and that the institutional educational model <br/>
can never be made healthy enough to be effective or positive.<br/>
<br/>
After I read the pages to my husband, he said &quot;Well I have heard <br/>
enough.  YUCK!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I have Unschooling friends with a teenager who refer to their <br/>
experiences with &quot;the Cult of Camp Fire&quot; with a shudder.  Perhaps <br/>
that was just their local group or council, or is that indicative of <br/>
the general atmosphere?<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess my thoughts are that with any of the scouting (I don&#39;t know about <br/>
Spiral Scouts) Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Campfire.. they all have a curriculum <br/>
based outcome. I am currently going through Boy Scout Leader training and it <br/>
is all curriculum this and outcome that. Big on the morally straight and <br/>
religious stuff. I&#39;m not too big on that. In fact it makes me kinda nervous, <br/>
and that is why I volunteered to be a leader. I wanted to be able to have <br/>
some control. One of the things said the other night in training really made <br/>
me pause. One guy was saying that if they can get a boy into scouts and keep <br/>
him there for three years, then they could mold the child for life. I don&#39;t <br/>
like that at all, but Jack wants to be a scout right now. So I guess my <br/>
feelings are that if he wants to do this, then I am going to be there to see <br/>
that things don&#39;t get too military and religious. I would prefer that he not <br/>
be in it at all, but I recognize the need to be a part of a group at his age. <br/>
It is definitely a catch 22, kinda damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t. The <br/>
only advice I can give is if your child really wants to be a scout (and there <br/>
are lots of good things about it) then, be sure that you are a leader if you <br/>
can. <br/>
Not really what you were looking for was it? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No such thing as a requirement in Camp Fire.  Sure, some leaders do things <br/>
differently and are more rigid--but I find Camp Fire extremely flexible at <br/>
the National and Council level.  It&#39;s one of the things I like about it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in lessons or practice <br/>
in music, theater or other arts<br/>
(whoa again, mandatory minimum time duration on arts?  What counts <br/>
according to them?  What if my child is not classically artistic, or <br/>
goes through a phase where they are not?)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen anything like this in any Camp Fire literature.  And I just <br/>
got through a weekend cleaning out the Council storage room and went through <br/>
a LOT of old literature.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in sports, clubs, and <br/>
organizations at school or in the community<br/>
(whoa again!  Mandatory involvement in hobbies and recreational <br/>
sports?  If they said, young person is encouraged to do this or that, <br/>
ok.  If they said they feel it is important, ok.  But just saying <br/>
that they spend X amount of hours per week is so arbitrary and <br/>
controlling to me.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking what you&#39;re reading is more of a philosophical statement than a <br/>
list of requirements.  For SURE I&#39;ve never seen anything like it.  Doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean it doesn&#39;t exist, though.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Elsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When children and youth <br/>
join Camp Fire, they start at the level appropriate to their grade.&quot;  <br/>
Is this program totally geared toward the institutional schooling <br/>
system, and would we be totally out of place?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have to remember that much of what is written as program standards and <br/>
&quot;curricula&quot; is for the sole purpose of getting someone else to give money to <br/>
fund the programs.  When you ask United Way or International Paper for money, <br/>
they want to know that you have a plan. <br/>
<br/>
What the program looks like at the end is totally a product of the people <br/>
involved.  And, built into all the Camp Fire curricula is &quot;design your own&quot; <br/>
type stuff to earn emblems and beads.  As an unschooler, I use the <br/>
information in the books as a guide.  I give emblems and beads freely, based <br/>
on what I know the kid has done and what we&#39;re doing together.  I adapt it <br/>
and change to suit our needs.  Even the councils change requirements, etc., <br/>
for their own purposes.  As an example, according to the nationally published <br/>
materials our club met the criteria to become a Blue Ribbon Club in our first <br/>
year.  That wasn&#39;t really our goal, it just happened.  At the last minute, <br/>
our council changed the criteria to allow another club to be awarded the <br/>
honor, as well.  (Our council is in a starting-over mode right now.)  Now <br/>
there are two Blue Ribbon Clubs in the council.  That looks good to United <br/>
Way, see?  We&#39;re meeting our standards.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t consider Camp Fire to be a top-down organization.  I find it to be <br/>
very kid-centered.  Perhaps that&#39;s my unschooling outlook.  In my dealings <br/>
with other Camp Fire adults, I find if I can bring them back to what&#39;s best <br/>
for the kid in any given conflict, then they can see it, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Every council and every area is different, though.  Councils have very wide <br/>
latitude in how the programs are administered.  We only have 7 clubs and one <br/>
council in our whole state.  Out west some cities have several councils.  And <br/>
they usually have typical mainstream ideas about what youth programs should <br/>
look like.  I find, however, that Camp Fire is the most flexible and <br/>
adaptable and that&#39;s why I use it.  I&#39;m a leader because I want to make any <br/>
scouting-type experience that he wants more unschooly for my son.  Obviously, <br/>
I believe even the kids in my club who are in school are going to benefit <br/>
from that atmosphere.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding myself to be really enthusiastic about Camp Fire--more than I <br/>
thought I would be.  I think it&#39;s because we are re-building, and I&#39;m getting <br/>
to design and create what the council looks like.  My husband is now on the <br/>
board and so we are becoming invested in it in a big way.  Truth is if you <br/>
don&#39;t have enthusiasm for what you do, no one else will want to participate.  <br/>
I think Camp Fire is a good program, and there is room for all types of <br/>
people.  Like most things, it is what you make it.<br/>

being *Morally Straight and Religious* the molding he was referring too was <br/>
more like badly hidden antigay, anti-anthing not conservative Christian <br/>
rhetoric. We had also just discussed the issue of child safety, or rather, <br/>
the BSA stance on molestation. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I am NOT pro <br/>
molestation, but, BUT this man angered me in his instance that the BSA does <br/>
its best to avoid anyone not morally straight becoming a leader, thus <br/>
decreasing the chances of boys being sexually abused or lured into a <br/>
lifestyle that isn&#39;t &quot;right.&quot; He never once used the word homosexual or gay, <br/>
he was very cautious to avoid any comments that might be misconstrued, but he <br/>
made his point. So I made mine. I asked where the BSA got the information <br/>
that pedophiles are gay men wanting to convert little boys to that <br/>
&quot;lifestyle.&quot; (Which I tried to explain it isn&#39;t a lifestyle, but didn&#39;t get <br/>
too far.) I explained that 98% of the time a pedophile is a white man in his <br/>
mid 20&#39;s and older. I made allowances for molesters of other races and of <br/>
women molesters, but explained that homosexual people were the least likely <br/>
to become Boy Scout leaders specifically for the propose of leading little <br/>
boys astray. Lets just say he didn&#39;t like me much. We then went into a <br/>
discussion of what religious means. He said Boy Scouts promotes a belief in a <br/>
higher spiritual being. So I asked if that included any spiritual being, or <br/>
just the Juedo/Christian god. (He didn&#39;t understand that question.) So I <br/>
asked if a child and parents with Buddhist beliefs or beliefs in American <br/>
Indian gods or Pagan gods would feel welcome. He chose to ignore me after <br/>
that. <br/>

doubt we will do this next year. I am sure I will be investigating other <br/>
opportunities! But I have committed myself (and so has Darin) to leading the <br/>
Tiger Cubs this year. And our socioeconomic area is such that if we didn&#39;t do <br/>
it, then there would be boys who wouldn&#39;t have anything at all. And Darin and <br/>
I are in this for them. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418195095">Dear Nanci: We are involved in Camp Fire USA because it is inclusive.<br/>
We were able to start a Karen Land Iditarod Club which is to include all<br/>
ages.  We start this Saturday.  My son and daughter are in groups with<br/>
kids of their own age.  They have been very supportive of us in our<br/>
Homeschooling and pretty nice all the way around.  We are involved in 4H<br/>
too.  Here there is a 4H all homeschool but of course they are all<br/>
religious but not exclusive.  We go and have become friends with a woman<br/>
who has adopted kids.  We were thinking of starting a homeschool Camp<br/>
Fire group and it would have been open to all ages because there are<br/>
just a few homeschoolers but neither the other homeschooler or I could<br/>
do it.  To me it doesn&#39;t matter if a kid is homeschooled or not or even<br/>
religious, kids are kids.  Lisa<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Camp Fire USA<br/>
 <br/>
I have heard both good and bad things about Camp Fire USA.  I decided <br/>
to do a little first hand research of my own and find out what they <br/>
were all about.  So I have been in touch with the Executive Director <br/>
of our local Council, to get more information. In the course of our <br/>
correspondence, he sent me some pages from the Leader Guide.  Most of <br/>
it looked pretty good, but I was given pause by certain parts of it.  <br/>
I thought I would share about my concerns here and get some feedback <br/>
from all of you, and also ask for experiences of those who have been <br/>
involved with Camp Fire, before I discuss this with my Camp Fire <br/>
contact.<br/>
<br/>
The Section that gave me pause is titled: Camp Fire USA Builds <br/>
Developmental Assets<br/>
<br/>
It begins by talking about the results and findings of a study done <br/>
by the Search Institute, in the 1990s, which identified asset <br/>
building as a focus for youth development instead of problem <br/>
solving.  OK, I can get with that, being as I see prevention as <br/>
better than bandages in general.  They go on to say that they have <br/>
identified 14 assets in the Camp Fire program that they believe help <br/>
youth to develop.  OK, so they are earmarking positives in their <br/>
program, that&#39;s ok.  <br/>
<br/>
But the next part starts to get creepy, and reads like a recipe for <br/>
cooking up wonderful adults, as though it&#39;s a fool proof plan.  Here <br/>
are the 14 assets:<br/>
<br/>
-Young Person has empathy, sensitivity and friendship  <br/>
-Young person has knowledge of and comfort with people of different <br/>
cultural/racial/ethnic backgrounds<br/>
(ok, so far so good)<br/>
-Young person serves the community 1 or more hours per week<br/>
(whoa, what does this mean?  What counts as community service?  Is <br/>
the age of the child considered?  I think community service is a <br/>
great thing and I encourage it, but I don&#39;t like being involved in a <br/>
program where my child is REQUIRED to do it to meet some objective <br/>
set by the group.)<br/>
<br/>
-Young person receives support from 3 or more non-parent adults<br/>
(ok, that sounds good)<br/>
-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in lessons or practice <br/>
in music, theater or other arts<br/>
(whoa again, mandatory minimum time duration on arts?  What counts <br/>
according to them?  What if my child is not classically artistic, or <br/>
goes through a phase where they are not?)<br/>
<br/>
-Young person spends 3 or more hours per week in sports, clubs, and <br/>
organizations at school or in the community<br/>
(whoa again!  Mandatory involvement in hobbies and recreational <br/>
sports?  If they said, young person is encouraged to do this or that, <br/>
ok.  If they said they feel it is important, ok.  But just saying <br/>
that they spend X amount of hours per week is so arbitrary and <br/>
controlling to me.)<br/>
<br/>
-Young person is out with friends with &quot;nothing special to do&quot; two or <br/>
fewer nights per week.<br/>
(What??  Does that mean they think all their time should be planned <br/>
and scheduled, even for teenagers?  Does that mean we are not <br/>
supposed to trust our children&#39;s judgement in general about how they <br/>
spend their time?)<br/>
                                          <br/>
The rest sounds good<br/>
-Young person can resist negative peer pressure and dangerous <br/>
situations<br/>
-Young person seeks to resolve conflict nonviolently<br/>
-Young person knows how to plan ahead and make choices<br/>
-Young person feels that he or she &quot;has control over things that <br/>
happen to me.&quot;<br/>
-Young person reports having high self esteem.<br/>
-Young person reports that &quot;my life has a purpose.&quot;<br/>
-Young person is optimistic about his or her personal future<br/>
<br/>
But then this &quot;All of the Camp Fire USA&#39;s curricula are outcome <br/>
based.  Forty Camp Fire outcomes were identified to develop these <br/>
assets.  These outcomes guide all projects, programs and <br/>
recognitions.  The outcomes are in the appendix and referenced <br/>
throughout the grade level program books.  This makes it easy to know <br/>
if you are using the Camp Fire activities and projects as designed, <br/>
the children will be experiencing the outcomes that will make them <br/>
caring, confident youth and future leaders.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As a passionate Unschooler/Natural Learner how many ways can I say <br/>
ick?  Curricula?  Grade levels?  Outcome based? Am I just looking at <br/>
this the wrong way or not understanding what they are trying to say?<br/>
<br/>
Elsewhere in the pages I received, it says &quot;When children and youth <br/>
join Camp Fire, they start at the level appropriate to their grade.&quot;  <br/>
Is this program totally geared toward the institutional schooling <br/>
system, and would we be totally out of place?  I don&#39;t really want to <br/>
separate my children out into narrow band age groups.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
it is socially good for them.  I am one of those who is of the <br/>
opinion that institutional schooling is intrinsically bad for the <br/>
human mind and spirit, and that the institutional educational model <br/>
can never be made healthy enough to be effective or positive.<br/>
<br/>
After I read the pages to my husband, he said &quot;Well I have heard <br/>
enough.  YUCK!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I have Unschooling friends with a teenager who refer to their <br/>
experiences with &quot;the Cult of Camp Fire&quot; with a shudder.  Perhaps <br/>
that was just their local group or council, or is that indicative of <br/>
the general atmosphere?<br/>
