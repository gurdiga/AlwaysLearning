<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605196352">-=-=-=-HOW ON EARTH could *ANY* semester of any school at any level begin to  compare to a trip to another continent to do something real with and for adults AND kids, something life-changing...  ?  And how could those kids&#39; parents have bowed down to the school?-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
When I was 16, I was asked by a trainer in VA to move up there with her and train for the Olympic trials. I&#39;d have to live at her farm and train every day. Ride and ride and ride.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was all for it. Thought it would look good on my resume/college application. I was too afraid of missing so much school work and being &quot;behind&quot; in getting into college/vet school. Daddy thought *any* vet school would be delighted to have an Olympian attend its classes.<br/>
<br/>
Bummer.<br/>
