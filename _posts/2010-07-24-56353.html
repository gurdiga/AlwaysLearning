<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710484581">It&#39;s after midnight in Europe and it&#39;s July 24th, Learn Nothing Day!<br/>
Is it possible to go through a whole day without learning anything?<br/>
I can&#39;t wait for the day to really start in a few hours so I can find out!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966434298">I did learn a few new things today, and so did the kids!<br/>
Our Learn Nothing Day failed:<br/>
<br/>
I learned a new, cool shortcut on my computer!<br/>
I learned that they used to drive on the left side of the road in Sweden<br/>
until 1967.<br/>
My oldest son got a fever and he now knows more about Celsius since we&#39;re<br/>
currently in Europe.<br/>
My younger son told me he saw tadpoles at the beach and we had to look up if<br/>
that was possible. Nope, frogs/amphibians (learned a new word too) don&#39;t<br/>
live in the ocean because it&#39;s salty so what he saw must have been some<br/>
small fish? We have to go there together tomorrow and check it out!<br/>
The boys started to play a new PS3 game today and had to figure out how to<br/>
play it!<br/>
I gave them some money to go to the store and buy ice cream/ candy and they<br/>
figured out how to share it equitably.<br/>
They wondered about what immigration means, and we talked about that;<br/>
They are building a tree house with their cousins and are learning to work<br/>
together getting material, hammering, sawing...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, we&#39;re learning so much every day, it&#39;s just not possible to stop it from<br/>
happening!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thankful for finding unschooling, it has opened my eyes for what&#39;s going<br/>
on right now right here with my kids.<br/>
And I&#39;m excited about all the learning and discovering we are going to do<br/>
together!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755041614">The group I am listed on in India got too heavily into who they should admit<br/>
who they shoud not. I learnt after reading too much on the group in one day,<br/>
that I need to get dettached from this idea and that idea. And just get back<br/>
to my children. because that is the only sane thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
And guess what my daughter was explaining to her little brother. she is<br/>
into computer games. she loves girlsgogames. She recently payed a 3D game on<br/>
that and she was telling her brother &quot;you know what I think Ishaan, God is<br/>
probably playing a 3D computer game with the Universe. Just like me he<br/>
chooses the level and space and then starts picking and choosing and starts<br/>
putting things i their place and then just moves them around.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I listened and smiled. I learnt how she is learning to correlate.<br/>
