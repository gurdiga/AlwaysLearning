<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806396662">I&#39;m struggling with the mixed feelings I get from trying to stay in the present moment and stay connected with my family, especially my 3 year old daughter.  On the days that I do the best at being in the moment, I find that those are also the days that I am the most irritable.  The day will often start wonderfully, and I&#39;ll feel like the best mom in the world.  We&#39;ll really connect and it feels so good.  I love seeing her joy at the connection as well.  But as the day goes on I feel drained and snappy, and it usually ends with me not being very nice.  <br/>
<br/>
This happens with my husband too.  After a good, heartfelt talk or a nice day spent together, I&#39;m soon feeling angry and nagging about stupid things.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I know what the problem is.  I have a hard time getting close to anyone and it takes a lot of energy out of me to put forth that effort.  It&#39;s much easier for me to shut down, close everyone off, and live like an emotional hermit.  But I don&#39;t *want* to live that way.  I want to be close to my family.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice on connecting, opening up, and working through the hard emotions that come with the territory?  <br/>

Maybe instead of seeing it as one long day with grouchiness at the  <br/>
end, see it as a series of choices, and if you can make each choice  <br/>
consciously and lovingly, you&#39;ll be living in EACH moment.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s something from Scott Noel today that might help. -- Joyce<br/>
<br/>
:: The Love Game ::<br/>
<br/>
Think about how good you feel when someone tells you<br/>
they love you -- *really* love you. Wouldn&#39;t you like<br/>
to feel that way more often?<br/>
<br/>
The object of today&#39;s game is to rekindle that feeling<br/>
*all day long!* Here&#39;s how:<br/>
<br/>
     No matter what your child does or says to you<br/>
     today, *interpret* every expression as if s/he<br/>
     said &quot;I love you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This may seem frivolous or even crazy, but don&#39;t knock<br/>
it &#39;til you&#39;ve tried it! :-)<br/>
<br/>
You can make up reasons if you like. (Example: &quot;My<br/>
child loves me so much, s/he&#39;ll do *anything* to get<br/>
my attention.&quot;) But there&#39;s even more power in<br/>
perceiving love for no reason at all.<br/>
<br/>
Immense power and pleasure are available to you by<br/>
deliberately choosing interpretations that feel good<br/>
*to you*. Before long, you may discover more Love than<br/>
you know how to let in.<br/>
<br/>
Remember that love is your birthright. You don&#39;t need<br/>
an excuse to let it in. Love is always there for you.<br/>
<br/>
Just breathe and let it in!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can so relate.  I don&#39;t have a solution on this.  I just want to let  <br/>
you know I have been working on the same issue lately.  When someone  <br/>
was talking about benign neglect in this group it really touched me  <br/>
because it feels like sometimes that is all I have to offer.  To  <br/>
connect deeply for an entire day is intense and tiring for me.  When I  <br/>
was a child teachers called me a &quot;daydreamer.&quot;  I was the kid in the  <br/>
back twisting her hair and gazing out the window.  Always in trouble  <br/>
for not being mentally in the room with the other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I have what we would call today an auditory processing  <br/>
issue.  When people speak to me I have learned to wait for the words  <br/>
to crowd around in my head and then line up and make sense.  This  <br/>
process is experienced by me as trying to decode the message.  Others  <br/>
experience it as a blank stare or stupidity or worst of all- me  <br/>
ignoring them.  I experience sadness when my daughter gets frustrated  <br/>
with this.  And she gets so frustrated.  She keeps elaborating on what  <br/>
she said- adding more words for my poor brain to process.  I get brain  <br/>
lock and feel like I have to re-boot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that after a day of fully connecting I just want to veg.  <br/>
I want to read or just lie with my eyes closed, or have my daughter  <br/>
play with someone else for awhile.  And I get cranky and tired.<br/>
<br/>
Meditation and mindfulness are helping so far in identifying what is  <br/>
happening.  I&#39;ll let you know when the solution begins to bubble up.   <br/>
So far, being mindful helps me to be more compassionate with my  <br/>
daughter and myself.  I want to be able to be close and to endure the  <br/>
intensity of joy and love.  I want my daughter to feel every day just  <br/>
how much I love her.  So I need to patient with both of us.<br/>
<br/>
Plus one of the reasons I took my daughter out of school is that her  <br/>
kinder teacher placed her at the table with the other &quot;cadets&quot; as she  <br/>
put it.  I didn&#39;t like that the kids were being divided up that way.   <br/>
I saw all the &quot;smart&quot; kids at another table.  I saw the writing on the  <br/>
wall.  I know my daughter is bright, but she does &quot;think different&quot;  <br/>
and I wanted her to have the experience of having that embraced.  One  <br/>
way I can help her love her self is to embrace the way I think and  <br/>
feel and make it work for me so that she has a model to follow.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451911510">I think this is true for many people (but not all).  With children I <br/>
think it&#39;s almost always true.  The expression may even be annoying and <br/>
worrisome but the intent is love.  I didn&#39;t recognize what my parents&#39; <br/>
expressions meant when I was a kid, when the realization could have <br/>
done me a lot more good.  But I&#39;m glad I understand their intentions <br/>
now even at this late date.  I still think they could have been less <br/>
worrisome about how they expressed their love but they didn&#39;t know and <br/>
I am no longer just taking it at face value anymore, so it&#39;s ok.<br/>
<br/>
When a child --full of tension and anxiety-- is expressing love, it&#39;s a <br/>
good hint that the parent could go further in making things more <br/>
comfortable.  And that helps more with connection both before and after <br/>
a parent realizes the intent is love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1323713399">The things that make the biggest difference to my mood are little. Things like having a beautiful glass to drink from, or a song that I really like to dance to, or finding a dead mole while walking the dog and looking a the way it&#39;s front paws arc out, clearly being used for digging more than for walking, or discovering that there is a website on flotsam (www.flostametrics.com), or finding an Edith Blyton mystery puzzle at a charity shop in Diss (I scoped them out Sandra, there are quite a few with puzzles and one with a troll plate that I&#39;m going back for) for 1 pound. The little things, the little moments of pleasure refill my mood gauge. It takes looking for them. Moving with an eye for pleasure. If I&#39;m standing in the kitchen doing the dishes I enjoy the bubbles on the water or the plates that we got from Habitat or the one red glass that I got when it was marked down at Waitrose or the much cheaper on I got when I spotted it at Morrison&#39;s because it<br/>
 reminds me of Target&#39;s logo with its embossed bullseyes. And I listen to the other things going on in the house: Simon and Linnaea negotiating their way through a game or laughing at something they found on lol cats and calling me in to share it or David coming in and chatting with me about the costs of renting a cottage in Norway versus one in France with a pool or playing a song on Rock Band that I haven&#39;t heard in a long, long time. <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of other ways that I can find of enjoying something. It is very much recognizing that it is this moment, not the whole day, not the whole hour, but this moment that is the important one. And once it&#39;s gone it&#39;s the next moment that counts. When I start feeling overwhelmed or grouchy or tired or lousy it&#39;s important to recognize that and do the things that change how I feel. Eat, or sit and watch a movie, or take a nap, or go to bed earlier or go for a walk when David gets home, pet the cats or play with the dog, have a cup of tea in a favorite mug, make candy (I did that for the first time yesterday, I can now make traditional British candy so if there isn&#39;t a penny candy place that I can find for you Sandra I can make you stuff and you can give me pence for it, or not. Do whatever it is that you know helps you to feel better. And if that doesn&#39;t work do something different and keep doing different things until you feel so silly it makes<br/>
 you laugh or something works. <br/>

whether because of school&#39;s striation of being forbidden to interact  <br/>
with older and younger people, we have a long tradition of self  <br/>

immature people will play with children&#39;s toys, others will assure  <br/>
us.  The goal is to have everyone be equally staid and boring.<br/>

If you decide that those people are wounded and wrong and would like  <br/>
to wrongly wound you too, it becomes much easier to ignore their  <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I had friends when I was young--13, 15--who would question or  <br/>
criticize or comment with that icy tone of voice that makes  <br/>
unoffensive words offensive, when I read Dr. Seuss books, or colored  <br/>
with crayons, or did art just do do art, or learned funny songs just  <br/>
to learn them.   I was criticized, but I was pretty confident and able  <br/>
to answer the questions and ask them why they were NOT interested.      <br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of it before, but surely this is one other reason  <br/>
unschooling was easy for me.  I KNEW it was healthier to keep playing  <br/>
and exploring even though most other people stop doing that, for some  <br/>
odd posing-as-adults reasons.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t indicate maturity to stop laughing at jokes and to start  <br/>
saying &quot;That&#39;s not funny&quot; to everything.   It doesn&#39;t indicate  <br/>
adulthood to consider music and art and everyday storytelling to a few  <br/>
special museum or dinner party or family reunion days every year.<br/>
<br/>
People can calcify.  Their potential for joy can die inside them.   <br/>
They can turn to stone trolls before they die.<br/>
Those people cannot be unschoolers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1171119129"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; It is very much recognizing that it is this moment, not the whole <br/>
 </span></blockquote>day, not the whole hour, but this moment that is the important one. And <br/>
once it&#39;s gone it&#39;s the next moment that counts. When I start feeling <br/>
overwhelmed or grouchy or tired or lousy it&#39;s important to recognize <br/>
that and do the things that change how I feel. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes... and this is one of the reasons I&#39;ve been enjoying chats so much <br/>
recently.  Chats live within the space of those moments of real time <br/>
that they&#39;re taking place in.  The kinds of questions to clarify things <br/>
and communicate on lists are extremely valuable and also very different <br/>
from the kinds of things said to connect and converse during chats.<br/>
<br/>
If at all possible even for just a few moments, for those who like to <br/>
talk that is, I think chats from unschooler to unschooler can be direct <br/>
ways to increase our ability to connect with our children, our <br/>
families, and other people as well as other unschoolers.  Unschooling <br/>
chats are frequently interspersed with comments about how to connect <br/>
more deeply and authentically with our children, how to take up the <br/>
opportunities we have to embrace the moments and not allow the moments <br/>
with others to slip away.  They have been very inspirational to me and <br/>
enlarged my appreciation and heart of gratitude.  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chat">http://sandradodd.com/chat</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very easy for me to feel deprived of time to myself, and really it <br/>
hasn&#39;t been an epiphany for me but I&#39;ve discovered that it&#39;s a gradual <br/>
growing, a living and breathing give and take and back and forth kind <br/>
of thing, depending on how I behave and feel.  Time is made up of many <br/>
more opportunities to connect and to take breaks for ourselves than we <br/>
realize when we think in moments instead of those bigger chunks of time <br/>
(hours, days).  If we store up both connection moments and (not <br/>
disconnection but) alone moments then we don&#39;t feel as deprived of <br/>
time.  Really it&#39;s very like not feeling deprived of food, love, or <br/>
anything else.  When we ration time and separate things up and dole out <br/>
time with no feeling of the generosity of all the time of our lives <br/>
together, time feels conflicted.  When we say yes to more time for our <br/>
children and for ourselves, so that we and our children have all the <br/>
time we need, then we are less conflicted about time.<br/>
<br/>
We were talking briefly elsewhere in other threads about instinct... <br/>
that humans haven&#39;t overcome or outgrown instinct.  And rather than <br/>
ignore or deny instinct, we could accommodate for instinctive behavior <br/>
and thereby raise the level of peace in our lives.  If we need more <br/>
connection and more solitude than we feel we have, it&#39;s great to really <br/>
*see* it more simply by looking at moments.  We might feel that just <br/>
because humans can see time by the clock and look over the millions of <br/>
years of existence that have passed long ages ago, we could surely <br/>
overcome our instinctive need to live in the moment.  But I think it&#39;s <br/>
better to realize that our bodies feel differently than logic might <br/>
lead us to believe, and make changes for peace and happiness.  It&#39;s not <br/>
stupid or illogical to do so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385626686">When our family goes out to dinner, the host(ess)<br/>
will look at the seven of us and ask, &quot;How many<br/>
children&#39;s menus would you like?&quot;  And I respond,<br/>
&quot;We&#39;ll all be eating off the full menu, but five<br/>
of us would like the children&#39;s menus and<br/>
crayons, please, not to order from, but to<br/>
play with.&quot;  The host(ess) will then hand the<br/>
children&#39;s menus and crayons to our five children, <br/>
assuming that they are the five who want to play.<br/>
But my teen does not want to color or do word searches.<br/>
(That would be me!)  He is interested in working in the food <br/>
industry, and he is fascinated with watching everybody in the <br/>
restaurant doing their work.  So, smiling, he accepts the children&#39;s<br/>
menu and box of crayons, and then turns and very sweetly offers<br/>
them to me.<br/>

I love to sketch people as I chat while waiting for the food to<br/>

You could go into the story and buy it.  <br/>
Another thought:  Would your daughter feel embarrassed<br/>
to go into a story and buy a toy or a game to give to a <br/>
younger friend or younger sib?  Because if the clerk<br/>
has age-related ideas about what people &quot;should&quot; be<br/>
playing with, wouldn&#39;t the clerk likely assume that the<br/>
game is being purchased as a gift for someone younger?<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to imply that one should lie and say, &quot;Oh,<br/>
I&#39;m buying this for my younger friend.&quot;  But the fact<br/>
is that people *do* buy things for other people, and <br/>
clerks I&#39;ve met don&#39;t ask me whether my purchase is<br/>
for me or for somebody else.  This is not meant to<br/>
make light of your daughter&#39;s feelings about making<br/>
the purchase.  And of course, sometimes, we get<br/>
to be &quot;regulars&quot; at stores, and the clerks know us<br/>
and do make friendly inquiries about our purchases,<br/>
and I suppose your DD could feel on the spot in <br/>
a situation like that.  Which would bring you back to,<br/>
buy the game for her!  <br/>
