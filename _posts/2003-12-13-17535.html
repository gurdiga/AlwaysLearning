<div id="ygrps-yiv-34938731">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I wanna send the below to our Educational person for our charter <br/>
school.  I&#39;ve just noticed that she keeps harping Janene on &quot;what she <br/>
learned this last month&quot; or pointing out when Janene has done something <br/>
like add, or read a double digit number or whatever.  I don&#39;t want her <br/>
to do that anymore.  Starlene, our old EA, didn&#39;t ask questions like <br/>
that.  She basically just asked Lexie (at this age) what Lexie had been <br/>
doing, what she was reading, what projects she&#39;d done, what she was <br/>
doing in gymanstics or soccer or whatever.  But JoAnne, our new EA, is <br/>
asking a lot about &quot;learning&quot; or pointing out that Janene is doing <br/>
&quot;Adding&quot; or &quot;Math&quot;, etc.  Anyway, I need some help being more clear.... <br/>
can you help?<br/>
<br/>
Here is my rough draft....<br/>
<br/>
JoAnne, I was thinking today after you left that I think I&#39;d like for <br/>
you not to ask Janene about what she&#39;s learning.  Lexie is old enough <br/>
and smart enough to understand why we are asking those questions, and <br/>
she&#39;s very involved in the idea of and immerced in the joy of <br/>
unschooling.  She knows that we are just writing reports for the school <br/>
and that it has nothing to do with what she needs to do as a life long <br/>
learned.  She probably understands better than I do that this is what we <br/>
do so gymnastics is paid. <br/>
<br/>
 Janene is not at that point yet (and probably won&#39;t be for a few years) <br/>
and I think the questions are interfering with the ideas of what I want <br/>
Janene to embrace--that learning is something that happens all of the <br/>
time, just by living life.  I don&#39;t want her to start thinking &quot;what <br/>
learning did I do today?&quot; or &quot;am I learning something right now.&quot;  I&#39;m <br/>
not really explaining it correctly, or the way I want to explain it, <br/>
I&#39;ll think more on it and see if I can say it better.  I guess that <br/>
right now Janene is really wanting to learn to read and is wanting to do <br/>
&quot;lessons&quot; to learn to read.  She has even said she wants to go to 1st <br/>
grade so she can learn to read and then homeschool after that.  This <br/>
tells me that she has the idea that one can only learn to read if one is <br/>
in school.  I think that to help her grasp that learning and life are <br/>
not seperate and that everything she does helps move her toward reading <br/>
and that reading will come for her when it comes and that when that does <br/>
that will be the perfect time for her.  I just don&#39;t want to point out <br/>
&quot;learning&quot; to her.  If we point out learning then it becomes seperate <br/>
from daily life.  Let&#39;s see if I can explain it.  A few months ago <br/>
Janene was counting kids in Lexie&#39;s line.  She said there wer 3 kid in <br/>
front of Lexie, and four behind.  You asked her how many in all and she <br/>
said &quot;3 and 4 and 1 is 8.&quot;  You then asked if she knew she was adding.  <br/>
She said she didn&#39;t know what adding was, but you told her what she was <br/>
doing was learning to add.  There will be years enough for Janene to <br/>
learn that she was adding numbers.  She doesn&#39;t need to label that <br/>
&quot;learning to add&quot; right now.  Right now she needs to enjoy that process.<br/>
<br/>
any ideas?<br/>

I think it will be helpful to the person you&#39;re writing to, but I don&#39;t know <br/>
if you&#39;ll be able to change her thinking sufficiently to save your kids from <br/>
the downside of being involved in that program.<br/>
<br/>
What you&#39;re concerned about it one of the casualties of school-involvement at <br/>
any level.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612672904">Hey Joylyn,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re new to the whole charter school thing, but I finally seem to be <br/>
getting into a good rhythm with our ES. I email her a list of things <br/>
that we&#39;ve done during the month. I try to make it as detailed as <br/>
possible so she has very few questions for us when she is actually <br/>
here for her visit. This has cut her visits down to 15 minutes, <br/>
versus the hour that she used to spend here. I&#39;ve found that when <br/>
I&#39;ve taken the time to do this, she is less inclined to put Gavin on <br/>
the spot and ask him questions. I also try to have something for <br/>
Gavin to do (like a favorite movie that I know will suck him right <br/>
in...lol) while she&#39;s here, so he&#39;s not usually sitting next to me <br/>
when she visits. She also knows that he doesn&#39;t enjoy being quizzed, <br/>
and I am quick to tell him that he doesn&#39;t have to answer her <br/>
questions if he doesn&#39;t feel like it. Our ES is brand new, but very <br/>
receptive to learning about unschooling and accomodating us even <br/>
though we differ greatly from the rest of her families, who all <br/>
school-at-home. Oh, and our best visit happened when Gavin and I <br/>
stayed up late the night before and he slept in, missing her visit <br/>
entirely...lol ;)<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I forgot to ask...is Starlene her advisor? Maybe she could give <br/>
your new ES a better idea of unschooling philosophy that could help <br/>
her be more effective with her families. Starlene joined a parenting <br/>
group that I belong to and as soon as I identified myself as a parent <br/>
of the charter school, she emailed me privately saying that any and <br/>
all feedback on our ES (be it good or bad) would be greatly <br/>
appreciated. <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
Brandy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-342211663">Thank you so much for your reply Sandra! That was what I thought <br/>
about the puter & TV but after a solid week of Rescue Heroes & Tonka <br/>
I felt a bit weak, as far as a kid who about this time last year I <br/>
had someone tell me he was ADD he is doing what he usualy does - <br/>
playing the puter games until he can complete every last detail, <br/>
along the way memorizing every last line of each character is <br/>
saying, he will play until he absolutely has to go to the bathroom <br/>
or hunger overtakes him (okey sometimes I sneak him a sandwich at <br/>
the desk which I do get a big thanks mom for). I think it is just me <br/>
becoming irritated at listening to the same things over and over <br/>
again, I need to move on and let him move on when he&#39;s ready. <br/>
Since I wrote the post I also started my period so I thankfully can <br/>
also blame my PMS for some of my feelings and know I think that I <br/>
can deal with things again...<br/>
As for me walking around the room cheerfully picking up things, I&#39;ll <br/>
try, perhaps that is the reason he doesn&#39;t like to pick things up - <br/>
I don&#39;t either, LOL! At the store the other day he saw a box on the <br/>
floor and immediately picked it up and put it perfectly in it&#39;s <br/>
proper spot. ?? In the family room he has lots of toys in there all <br/>
the time, but I just don&#39;t like having them on the floor all the <br/>
time because it&#39;s hard for people to walk over them, or hurt or <br/>
break when people walk on them or the dog could chew on them also, <br/>
he has lots many toys to the dog and I&#39;m not sure if he <br/>
understands?? He is almost 6 btw. I have made it a point to have <br/>
several tables of different heights in the family room to encourage <br/>
him to keep things off of the floor, I don&#39;t leave my things on the <br/>
floor, etc. But I will try your suggestion for the next few weeks <br/>
and cheerfully pick up what is left on the floor - should I make it <br/>
a point to do this in front of him? Should I say anything or just <br/>
let the actions speak for themselves? <br/>
Now as far as &quot;offering of consequences&quot; let me ask you what you do <br/>
as this is an example of what we do in a family meeting. DS is <br/>
brought up for hitting mom because she asked for a turn at the <br/>
computer to check her email for a few minutes then he could return <br/>
to his game, DS did you hit mom? DS says yes, so we ask him what he <br/>
thinks he should do? He says &quot;Say I&#39;m Sorry&quot;, okey does Mom accept <br/>
the appology? Mom say&#39;s Yes, then we ask DS why it&#39;s not okey to hit <br/>
and he says because it hurts and isn&#39;t nice, then we ask if he could <br/>
find a better way to express himself next time? He says yes he could <br/>
tell Mom she could have a turn after he finishes this level. Okey, <br/>
what do you think should happen if you hit mom again? DS says that <br/>
he should have to have a time out (which we used to use for <br/>
discipline but haven&#39;t for more than a year but he still refers to <br/>
it) or perhaps he could not play any computer time for an hour. So <br/>
we agree that hitting hurt and it&#39;s better to use words than hitting <br/>
and if it happens again then ds will have to go for an hour without <br/>
computer. So in my opinion &quot;going for an hour without computer&quot; is a <br/>
consequence that he offered and which we will use if it happens <br/>
again. But sometimes he gets somewhere he says he doesn&#39;t know what <br/>
should happen, like if he leaves his toys on the floor in the living <br/>
room, I bring up that the dog might chew on them, but he still <br/>
leaves them there, what am I missing???   <br/>

pick up things on the floor when either I can&#39;t stand it anymore or someone<br/>
is coming over and we need the room.  When I have a little more time I can<br/>
then go through the baskets and put things away.  Some things now belong in<br/>
their own baskets, so we can easily just scoop the stuff into it&#39;s storage<br/>
place quickly when we need to.  This makes it really easy to allow the<br/>
place to be a mess, but also have it get picked up quickly when needed.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why isn&#39;t this resolved between Mom and DS at the time it occurs?  That&#39;s<br/>
what we do in our family (of 3 - dh, dd, and I.)  Sometimes if dd (who is<br/>
5) has a problem with her Dad she will tell me and I will help facilitate,<br/>
and visa-versa.  But, we do it at the time it comes up.  Sometimes if I<br/>
don&#39;t handle it well because of whatever reason (like PMS), I will bring it<br/>
up again afterward to say that I&#39;m sorry and to try to come to a mutual<br/>
resolution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;then we ask DS why it&#39;s not okey to hit<br/>
&gt;and he says because it hurts and isn&#39;t nice, then we ask if he could<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you asking him these questions because you want to test him to make<br/>
sure he knows the right answer?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when my dd is having a problem getting along with one of her<br/>
friends she will discuss it with me.  I usually ask her if she needs some<br/>
ideas for new ways of resolving it, and if she says yes then we will<br/>
brainstorm together.  I will suggest something, she might not like it, but<br/>
then she will come up with and idea, then I might expand on it, etc...<br/>
Sometimes she just wants to dump her feelings with me and not try to fix<br/>
the problem.  That&#39;s OK too, because I often feel that way as well.  But I<br/>
don&#39;t expect her to answer me in any certain way.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That sounds like a rule... what if it happens and it doesn&#39;t hurt you?<br/>
Back to my first question - can you resolve it next time it happens in the<br/>
moment, without some sort of penalty that he must pay?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d clean up when it was convenient for me. If you clean up when he&#39;s around<br/>
you can ask him for help and he&#39;ll get to absorb the process even if he isnt<br/>
participating. But I wouldn&#39;t do it around him as a way of changing him into<br/>
someone who will clean up after himself.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Dawn Adams wrote on the UnschoolingDiscussion list:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Ok, I think I&#39;ll share my newly thought of philosophy of housework here. It<br/>
&gt;&gt; started when my sister was over and chasing the kids around. I was<br/>
&gt;&gt; straightening up the livingroom and had just finished piling up blocks (Big<br/>
&gt;&gt; cardboard ones. We have, in all, 10 or eleven different kinds of wood,<br/>
&gt;&gt; plastic and cardboard blocks. I feel so wealthy. :) ) when my son (2) ran<br/>
&gt;&gt; into the room, saw the blocks and immediatly tore down the pile. I smiled and<br/>
&gt;&gt; shook my head. My sister, who&#39;d arrived in time to see this, sternly said,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Harry! Your mother just finished putting those away!&quot; When she said that I<br/>
&gt;&gt; felt offended. Didn&#39;t she know I only pile those blocks so that Harry can<br/>
&gt;&gt; knock them down? And there was the Aha! I looked around the room at the clean<br/>
&gt;&gt; living room and realized that was why I did any cleaning.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; We don&#39;t clean up messes to have a clean house. We clean up messes so there<br/>
&gt;&gt; is room for more mess!<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; Now I think of cleaning up after my kids as replacing a canvas. I do it with<br/>
&gt;&gt; the thought that by giving them room again and a bare floor and organized<br/>
&gt;&gt; toys to pick from I&#39;m handing them the tools to write another mess onto our<br/>
&gt;&gt; house. It&#39;s meant that at the end of a day, or sometimes a few days in a row,<br/>
&gt;&gt; I just let the mess stay, because really, it&#39;s a work of art or a story.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Maybe it isn&#39;t finished. Maybe it&#39;s too interesting to be gotten rid of so<br/>
&gt;&gt; soon. It also clears up my feelings of resentment about doing the bulk of it.<br/>
&gt;&gt; I like being the one to reset the house so that we all can live another,<br/>
&gt;&gt; different mess the next day.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; At the store the other day he saw a box on the<br/>
&gt; floor and immediately picked it up and put it perfectly in it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; proper spot. ??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because that&#39;s where they belong in the store :-) Organizing and cleaning<br/>
can be very satisfying.<br/>
<br/>
But at home toys weren&#39;t bought to be stored neatly on the shelves. That&#39;s<br/>
what nick nacks are for ;-) Their purpose is to be out being played with.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In the family room he has lots of toys in there all<br/>
&gt; the time, but I just don&#39;t like having them on the floor all the<br/>
&gt; time because it&#39;s hard for people to walk over them<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You have two people with wants that conflict. So the way you&#39;re modeling<br/>
that conflicting needs are to be resolved is that the person who is bigger<br/>
and stronger gets to make the little person do what the bigger person wants.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; he has lots many toys to the dog and I&#39;m not sure if he<br/>
&gt; understands?? He is almost 6 btw.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. But perhaps between cleaning up and losing toys, losing toys is the<br/>
lesser evil.<br/>
<br/>
Up until my daughter was 11/12 cleaning up even a little mess was<br/>
overwhelming to her. It would look like she&#39;d be cleaning forever. She<br/>
didn&#39;t know where to start. She didn&#39;t know where to put things, even the<br/>
obvious things. She didn&#39;t want me to keep telling her what to do next and<br/>
didn&#39;t want to decide on her own what to do next.<br/>
<br/>
You can fight with him for the next 6 years (or 12 years if he&#39;s a late<br/>
bloomer ;-). Or you can cheerfully accept that you&#39;ll have to be the one<br/>
cleaning -- as you accept that you&#39;re the one who needs to take<br/>
responsibility for meals.<br/>
<br/>
Ask for his help. And be very appreciative that he&#39;s interrupted something<br/>
that to him is a lot more important to do something for you. Even and<br/>
especially if you feel he&#39;s doing something trivial or he could have helped<br/>
a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Who would you rather help: someone who hovered over you, nagging you for not<br/>
doing the job the way they thought it should be done, or someone who asked<br/>
you to help and thanked you for what you could do?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have made it a point to have<br/>
&gt; several tables of different heights in the family room to encourage<br/>
&gt; him to keep things off of the floor, I don&#39;t leave my things on the<br/>
&gt; floor, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Some people eat at the kitchen table. Some people eat in front of the TV.<br/>
It&#39;s personal preference.<br/>
<br/>
We can model what works for us. But modeling isn&#39;t a sneaky way of making<br/>
someone do something your way. It&#39;s an idea that they can check out to see<br/>
if it might work for them. They can take it or leave it if something else<br/>
would work better.<br/>
<br/>
For most of my daughter&#39;s life she has drawn and eaten sprawled out on the<br/>
floor. She even ate lunch sprawled on the kitchen table a few times. I<br/>
always used the couch drawing, reading and watching TV and sat &quot;properly&quot; in<br/>
a chair to eat. She&#39;s now more likely to sit on the couch for drawing and<br/>
sits in a chair for eating. Not because she&#39;s finally picked up on my model<br/>
and is doing it right, but because her body needs different things than it<br/>
did before and that&#39;s what works better for her now.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this was turned into a way bigger deal than it needed to be.<br/>
<br/>
It was treated as though his reaction were coldly calculated, as though he<br/>
sat there poised between &quot;Okay&quot; and hitting mom and chose hitting mom. I<br/>
don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case.<br/>
<br/>
He might know what to do, but doing it isn&#39;t as easy. I think of it as like<br/>
taking a second piece of cheesecake. I might know that one is enough but do<br/>
I as an adult with a lifetime experience of putting knowledge into practice<br/>
always stop with one?<br/>
<br/>
He has the knowledge but he also has emotions swirling around in him that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t know what to do with. (Lots of adults never master that!) He will<br/>
eventually be able to become aware of his emotions and stop before he reacts<br/>
to them. But it takes time. Patience. And help and understanding from you.<br/>
<br/>
Assume that it&#39;s like riding a bike. He may know to keep pedaling and keep<br/>
the wheel straight but it takes time for him to master it.<br/>
<br/>
In the above example when he hit you, you could have calmly said &quot;Use words<br/>
please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So in my opinion &quot;going for an hour without computer&quot; is a<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even self chosen punishment is punishment. The consequence of consequences<br/>
is that he&#39;ll avoid hitting someone because he doesn&#39;t want to lose computer<br/>
time, not because it hurts someone.<br/>
<br/>
Is that what you want him to learn? It&#39;s silly to project that into the<br/>
future and imagine that once he&#39;s on his own with no one to take away<br/>
computer privileges that he&#39;ll hit people! But it isn&#39;t so far fetched that<br/>
kids will do that with other actions that are limited by fear of<br/>
consequences rather than because they aren&#39;t a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But sometimes he gets somewhere he says he doesn&#39;t know what<br/>
&gt; should happen, like if he leaves his toys on the floor in the living<br/>

&gt; leaves them there, what am I missing???<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That he&#39;s 6 and has hardly any experience in the world and is<br/>
developmentally not an adult.<br/>
<br/>
We see them acting fairly competently as though they were thinking and<br/>
feeling as adults but their brains don&#39;t work the way adult brains do. They<br/>
don&#39;t have the same understanding, don&#39;t have the same capacities for<br/>
figuring things out, don&#39;t have the same mastery over their emotions that<br/>
adults do. They have different needs than we do.<br/>
<br/>
If we treat them as doing the best they can -- even if we think they can do<br/>
better -- they will do the best they can. If we treat them as incompetent,<br/>
they&#39;ll feel incompetent and respond incompetently.<br/>

as far as a kid who about this time last year I <br/>
had someone tell me he was ADD he is doing what he usualy does - <br/>
playing the puter games until he can complete every last detail, <br/>
along the way memorizing every last line of each character is <br/>
saying, he will play until he absolutely has to go to the bathroom <br/>
or hunger overtakes him (okey sometimes I sneak him a sandwich at <br/>
the desk which I do get a big thanks mom for). I think it is just me <br/>
becoming irritated at listening to the same things over and over <br/>
again, I need to move on and let him move on when he&#39;s ready. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I play Spider Solitaire. It&#39;s a rather repetitive/non-strategy game compared <br/>
to the video games Duncan plays, and I can do it almost mindlessly. I *see* <br/>
plays while doing something else. I&#39;m engaged, but not &quot;all there&quot;. Hard to <br/>
explain. Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
I used to just try to win. By the rules. You can&#39;t really cheat with computer <br/>
solitaitre because you can&#39;t steal cards from underneath or &quot;mis-shuffle,&quot; <br/>
but you can back up a bit and &quot;re-do&quot; a play or two.  I&#39;m pretty good. I have an <br/>
82% win rate. I *used* to have a 94% win rate! But that was before I started <br/>
to &quot;mess&quot; with the game.<br/>
<br/>
Now sometimes I&#39;ll deal three rows at first or deal two rows at a time after <br/>
the first move. I&#39;ll try to leave more cards on the board so I can make fewer <br/>
moves. By changing *my* rules, it makes the play harder, so I lose more. But <br/>
that&#39;s OK.<br/>
<br/>
Before I found Spider Solitaire, I played regular old computer solitaire. My <br/>
goal was SPEEEED! I wanted to finish a game in less and less time. I got <br/>
pretty good at that too.<br/>
<br/>
My point: &lt;g&gt; When you get really good at a game, you&#39;ll start changing the <br/>
real rules to satisfy another part of you. These kids on the video/computer <br/>
games will start changing strategies----maybe they&#39;ll purposefully try to be <br/>
killed in a lower level so that they can see *exactly* how far they can go before <br/>
losing a life. Or how far can I take this guy *really* before he becomes so <br/>
weak as to be ineffective----what&#39;s the DEPTH of the game, *really*? They&#39;ll <br/>
start pushing themselves further and further and dying sooner and sooner so that <br/>
they can see the LEAST amount they can do to win. When they can do *THAT*, <br/>
they&#39;ve &quot;mastered&quot; it. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a neat plan. And it&#39;s an awesome progression. I LOVE watching *that* <br/>
happen , in particular. The &quot;regular, normal&quot; games rules aren&#39;t interesting to <br/>
me anymore, but I LOVE to watch Duncan when he&#39;s moving on to the next phase <br/>
and can show me how much further he can take the character (or how *little* he <br/>
can do with him). That shows me that he&#39;s thinking BEYOND the &quot;game&quot;----he&#39;s <br/>
strategizing further and further! That&#39;s SO neat!<br/>
<br/>
You kind of have to tie me up for the beginning phases of the  games, as he&#39;s <br/>
trying to figure out the real rules, but when he&#39;s in the &quot;zone&quot; of mastery, <br/>
I&#39;m glued! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we agree that hitting hurt and it&#39;s better to use words than hitting<br/>
&gt; and if it happens again then ds will have to go for an hour without<br/>
&gt; computer. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps Mom could not attempt to interrupt a 5yo doing something he likes<br/>
just so she can do something she likes.  Why can&#39;t we agree that Mom will<br/>
just wait until he is finished? &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have hitters in my family (2 to be exact and 3 screamers).  It has more<br/>
to do with their natures and the difficulties they have expressing<br/>
themselves in words, dealing with frustration in the heat of the moment,<br/>
etc. than it does with not knowing that hitting and screaming are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
5yo is still very young.  I would suggest working on not overloading him<br/>
with frustration so that he is able to handle what is on his plate rather<br/>
than to punish him (or have him punish himself which seems slightly twisted<br/>
&lt;grin&gt; to me).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;like if he leaves his toys on the floor in the living<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; room, I bring up that the dog might chew on them, but he still<br/>
&gt; leaves them there, what am I missing???  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That loss of toys is more important to you than to him?  That he is 5yo and<br/>
stopping doing something he likes to do now and do something he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
just so that perhaps some bad thing in the future won&#39;t happen is not a<br/>
likely scenario?<br/>
<br/>
I have 5 kids and none of them are neat freaks and floors covered with toys,<br/>
paper, crayolas, cars, clothes, etc. is the norm around here.  Last year the<br/>
then 4yo tripped over a toy, fell and hit the bridge of his nose on the<br/>
bedframe and broke it.  So the kids are well aware that bad stuff really,<br/>
truly can happen if the floor is covered in stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t make them clean it up for the same reason that knowing eating<br/>
cake makes my butt bigger doesn&#39;t make me not eat that last piece.<br/>
<br/>
So we work together, I gather all their stuff from downstairs and put it on<br/>
the stair well, they take it up.  They take turns picking up the floors in<br/>
their rooms so at night at least nobody is tripping in the dark.  Find a way<br/>
to work WITH your son, not against him.<br/>

I love the way this sounds and would love to embrace it. But when I think of being at a store with 5 little kids all acting their age it makes me want to stay home forever.  How do you handle times when the actions of your family directly impact other people, such as at a store, at church, or at someone else&#39;s home?<br/>

I think it&#39;s noble for a mother to deliver food to a child&#39;s worksite.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to a ballad-singing party tonight and am really excited about it.  <br/>
I was thinking of doing a ballad called &quot;The FFV,&quot; a trainwreck song.    One <br/>
line is &quot;Georgie&#39;s mother came to him with a bucket on her arm; saying, &#39;my <br/>
darling son, be careful how you run&#39;...&quot;  but I thought people nowadays won&#39;t <br/>
know what that bucket was.  It was a lunch-bucket.  Maybe a lard can with a bale. <br/>
 Maybe a manufactured lunch-box.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve been thinking about mothers delivering lunches already today &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
-=-DS is <br/>
<br/>
brought up for hitting mom because she asked for a turn at the <br/>
<br/>
computer to check her email for a few minutes then he could return <br/>
<br/>
to his game, DS did you hit mom? DS says yes, so we ask him what he <br/>
<br/>
thinks he should do? He says &quot;Say I&#39;m Sorry&quot;. . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should stop having family meetings and start living in the moment.<br/>
Maybe if you ask if you could check your mail when he gets to a good stopping <br/>
place, to please call you when it&#39;s your turn, he won&#39;t feel like hitting.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Okey, <br/>
<br/>
what do you think should happen if you hit mom again? DS says that <br/>
<br/>
he should have to have a time out (which we used to use for <br/>
<br/>
discipline but haven&#39;t for more than a year but he still refers to <br/>
<br/>
it) or perhaps he could not play any computer time for an hour. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This sounds so contrived to me, and so too late.  Why wait for a meeting?  <br/>
It&#39;s so...  bureaucratic or legalistic or something.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So <br/>
<br/>
we agree that hitting hurt and it&#39;s better to use words than hitting <br/>
<br/>
and if it happens again then ds will have to go for an hour without <br/>
<br/>
computer. So in my opinion &quot;going for an hour without computer&quot; is a <br/>
<br/>
consequence that he offered and which we will use if it happens <br/>
<br/>
again. -=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems that it doesn&#39;t take a meeting to remind someone that using words is <br/>
better than hitting, but maybe there should be a meeting for parents to <br/>
discuss that if a child wants to hit the parents might need to change their <br/>
approach.  Is he going to lose an hour of computer time because parents would rather <br/>
blame a child than change their own awareness and respect-leve for him?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not likely that the mother&#39;s e-mail can&#39;t wait.  If she&#39;s expecting a <br/>
note about something that&#39;s happening in the next half hour, that&#39;s a good thing <br/>
to push, but if waiting for the child&#39;s good pausing place is a possibility, <br/>
then the respect shown to that child will be returned up the line.  Treating <br/>
him like his needs and rights are small will make him feel and be smaller than <br/>
he needs to be.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-like if he leaves his toys on the floor in the living <br/>
<br/>
room, I bring up that the dog might chew on them, but he still <br/>
<br/>
leaves them there, what am I missing???   -=-<br/>
<br/>
That he&#39;s little and you&#39;re expecting him to understand more than he does.<br/>
That he&#39;s little and if the toys are important to him, you should love him <br/>
enough to take care of his toys for him, rather than secretly hope the dog will <br/>
teach him a lesson.<br/>
<br/>
If you treat his things that way, how will he treat your things when you&#39;re <br/>
old and need his help?   <br/>
<br/>
When I was on the couch for two months with a broken leg, I really needed my <br/>
kids to cover me up, bring me food, keep the fire burning, change the tape, <br/>
bring me water.  I was pretty glad in those days that I have willingly done <br/>
things like that for them over the years instead of saying &quot;Get it yourself,&quot; or <br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t need to watch another video, you just watched one.&quot;  When friends of <br/>
mine are that way to their children I cringe, especially if I&#39;m close enough <br/>
to see the veil go down over the light in the kids&#39; eyes.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That he is only 6? :o) My just turned 7 yo does the same things. As far<br/>
as the hitting...I would handle it when it happens and not look for a<br/>
punishment (even if he comes up with it). I have noticed that Jason hits<br/>
me (not as often lately though) if he gets totally overwhelmed and does<br/>
not feel that I am listening to him. I rarely interrupt him when he is<br/>
on the computer, most of the time checking my email can wait until he is<br/>
done. He does wait for me to check my email in the morning, we have<br/>
talked about it and pretty much agreed that it is ok for me to check in<br/>
the morning then I won&#39;t have to bug him about it later and he can<br/>
actually play longer. Sometimes he will come up to me while I am on the<br/>
computer and want to use it...in this case I ask him to wait until I am<br/>
done reading the email or checking the website that I am on. When he has<br/>
gotten impatient, I usually remind him that I do wait for him to get to<br/>
a good stopping point on his games and that helps. I also try not to<br/>
take too long getting off...realizing that he has less patience then I<br/>
do, I can check my email later, and that I want to positively reinforce<br/>
him asking nicely and waiting.<br/>
<br/>
I have found lately that Jason responds very well to logical<br/>
explanations. If he is hitting his brother (or me), I do stop it<br/>
immediately. We have been having conversations lately about whether<br/>
hitting is effective at getting what he wants...if he wants something<br/>
from Kyle, it definitely isn&#39;t...Kyle only holds on tighter. So I will<br/>
help him ask Kyle for things or find an alternative. Often he will hit<br/>
Kyle when he is frustrated at his video game...in talking about this, I<br/>
found out that he does not like it when Kyle is watching if he is trying<br/>
to solve a new part of the game...he likes to be alone so if he makes<br/>
mistakes there is no one around. I have made more of a point to keep<br/>
Kyle (who is 4) occupied during these times and to keep an ear out for<br/>
signs that Jason might be getting frustrated so I can lure Kyle away (or<br/>
just go sit with them which helps protect Kyle and helps calm Jason).<br/>
The point is to look at what is causing the hitting and realizing that<br/>
there are different solutions to the different reasons. Yes, hitting is<br/>
unacceptable, but my focus has been on identifying why he hits and<br/>
helping him come up with better ways to handle those situations (more<br/>
then just &quot;use your words&quot;). <br/>
<br/>
As far as the toys...I honestly think that there is a &quot;clean gene&quot;. My<br/>
dh and youngest have it, my oldest and I do not LOL! Honestly...dh can<br/>
clean the kitchen or make a few piles in the living room and the room<br/>
*looks* clean. I can spend half an hour and just manage to move things<br/>
around a bit. My youngest always helps me clean up without asking (he<br/>
actually got really mad when he was 2 and I wouldn&#39;t let him help me<br/>
clean up the cat throw up!) My oldest does not really do much. Basically<br/>
I have lots of baskets in the family room and it really does not take<br/>
much to get the toys off the ground. The boys chip in and help if they<br/>
want to. Often I will suggest a quick clean up (less then 5 mins) before<br/>
we play a board game or build legos (usually because we need the room to<br/>
play!) In these instances, Jason is very willing to help.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! Jason does this all the time with his games. He will play the same<br/>
level with a different character or by taking a different path or trying<br/>
a new strategy and see how this affects the outcome. I think schools<br/>
call it the scientific method?? ;o)<br/>
<br/>
I have been amazed at the depth of these computer games...there are SO<br/>
many layers and I am amazed at how quickly Jason figures out where to go<br/>
or what to do with only the bare minimum directions. These are big,<br/>
interactive, fun puzzles that really build their critical thinking and<br/>
problem solving skills as well as totally engage their minds on all<br/>
levels.<br/>
<br/>
I really feel sorry for our neighbor&#39;s little boy...he has 30 min chips<br/>
for computer and tv time..he is allowed 2/day. That is no where near<br/>
enough time to really get any kind of enjoyment. And I am sure that his<br/>
mom does not get involved in the computer games...I just think about all<br/>
that great learning he is missing out on because video games/tv have<br/>
been demonized.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230880256">Friday: I sent this last night, but the message bounced.  Many of these<br/>
points have been made, but I decided to send it again for more feedback.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have made it a point to have<br/>
&gt;several tables of different heights in the family room to encourage<br/>
&gt;him to keep things off of the floor<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have large baskets (sometimes just grocery bags) that I use to quickly<br/>
pick up things on the floor when either I can&#39;t stand it anymore or someone<br/>
is coming over and we need the room.  When I have a little more time I can<br/>
then go through the baskets and put things away.  Some things now belong in<br/>
their own baskets, so we can easily just scoop the stuff into it&#39;s storage<br/>
place quickly when we need to.  This makes it really easy to allow the<br/>
place to be a mess, but also have it get picked up quickly when needed.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Now as far as &quot;offering of consequences&quot; let me ask you what you do<br/>
&gt;as this is an example of what we do in a family meeting. DS is<br/>
&gt;brought up for hitting mom because she asked for a turn<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why isn&#39;t this resolved between Mom and DS at the time it occurs?  That&#39;s<br/>
what we do in our family (of 3 - dh, dd, and I.)  Sometimes if dd (who is<br/>
5) has a problem with her Dad she will tell me and I will help facilitate,<br/>
and visa-versa.  But, we do it at the time it comes up.  Sometimes if I<br/>
don&#39;t handle it well because of whatever reason, I will bring it up again<br/>
afterward to say that I&#39;m sorry and to try to come to a mutual resolution.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;then we ask DS why it&#39;s not okey to hit<br/>
&gt;and he says because it hurts and isn&#39;t nice, then we ask if he could<br/>
&gt;find a better way to express himself next time?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Are you asking him these questions because you want to test him to make<br/>
sure he knows the right answer?<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when my dd is having a problem getting along with one of her<br/>
friends she will discuss it with me.  I usually ask her if she needs some<br/>
ideas for new ways of resolving it, and if she says yes then we will<br/>
brainstorm together.  I will suggest something, she might not like it, but<br/>
then she will come up with and idea, then I might expand on it, etc...<br/>
Sometimes she just wants to dump her feelings with me and not try to fix<br/>
the problem.  That&#39;s OK too, because I often feel that way as well.  But I<br/>
don&#39;t expect her to answer me in any certain way.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;we agree that hitting hurt and it&#39;s better to use words than hitting<br/>
&gt;and if it happens again then ds will have to go for an hour without<br/>
&gt;computer.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That sounds like a rule... what if it happens and it doesn&#39;t hurt you?<br/>
Back to my first question - can you resolve it next time it happens in the<br/>
moment, without some sort of penalty that he must pay?<br/>
<br/>
You could ask him to let you know when it would be a good time for you to<br/>
have your turn and then trust that he will (at first, he might really test<br/>
you to see if you are serious about this new approach... does he *really*<br/>
get to use it until he&#39;s ready to let you have your turn?)  You could, in<br/>
the moment, say calmly &quot;please use words instead of hitting.&quot;  Try to see<br/>
that something deeper is going on within himself that he is struggling with<br/>
and can not articulate, and maybe you could say &quot;I can see that you&#39;re<br/>
struggling to find the right words, perhaps it&#39;s not a good time for you to<br/>
stop what you are doing.  Please let me know when it is so I can check my<br/>
email.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005665586">Thank you everyone for your attempts at helping me to <br/>
understand this more thourally (spelling). Actually I do already do <br/>
most of the picking up without complaint, I was just searching for <br/>
clarification, I have to admit that Sandra&#39;s use of &quot;Cheerfully&quot; <br/>
made me a bit sarcastic in reply :). It&#39;s just that of the children <br/>
I know (I should know better than compare children) that they almost <br/>
always seem to be able to pick up after themselves starting at about <br/>
3 years of age - NO KIDDING! But you also need to understand that I <br/>
am considered pretty much a &quot;Revolutionist&quot; in my neighborhood that <br/>
I don&#39;t spank my child! Very sad but true!!! I am trying so hard to <br/>
overcome the social roadblocks for freedom for my family. <br/>
     Also when I said my ds hit me when I ask for a turn at the <br/>
puter - I was asking for a turn, not saying &quot;give me a turn right <br/>
now!&quot; we are getting a 3rd computer for a 3 person household so at <br/>
least soon we wont have that argument! Can someone point me to some <br/>
good beginner books on game programming? I was thinking about <br/>
getting a clue about some of the basics and I think ds would enjoy <br/>
some as well (if not then that is fine also.) We do have family <br/>
meetings here and the reason it was brought up at the meeting was <br/>
because it had happened several times before and that was what we <br/>
had agreed to do so we could wait until dad got home to talk more <br/>
about it, It&#39;s suppossed to be democratic and is highly suggested in <br/>
a lot of the books I&#39;ve read about unschooling. So that&#39;s where I <br/>
get it from and we&#39;re still new at family meetings but working on <br/>
them, like I said I&#39;m just learning, like the name of the board - <br/>
Always Learning! So when kids in your families continually do <br/>
something inappropriate what do you do to stop them? <br/>
     Anyhow we have been having a blast around here lately - No <br/>
public school 4 out of 5 days this week. Which means that most of <br/>
the neighbor kids are visiting my house, since we always <br/>
never &quot;seem&quot; to have school, I think it&#39;s crazy that they&#39;ve been <br/>
learning so much over here - most of them are ADHD (our PS&#39;s <br/>
favorite label for extra goverment money) and their parents are very <br/>
happy not to deal with them, it&#39;s crazy that they come to my house <br/>
and WANT to work on math, research reports, solar system and <br/>
astrology, paint, etc. etc. Because they know they are free here to <br/>
do just about anything they want and I&#39;ll help them answer what <br/>
questions they have, plus we have a huge library they can use. It <br/>
has been great having so much energy in the house!</div>

Why?<br/>
<br/>
Happiness is worth MUCH more than any clean floor.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re cynical about the idea of cheerfulness, you&#39;ll have problems here.<br/>

<br/>
Well if he doesn&#39;t have the skills to reason with you yet, don&#39;t stand so <br/>
close when you ask so nicely.    Did you interrupt him in the middle of <br/>
something?  Is he thinking better than he&#39;s speaking?  It&#39;s VERY common for kids&#39; <br/>
intellect and their vocabulary and speaking ability to leapfrog one another through <br/>
the years.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;We do have family <br/>

<br/>
About unschooling? <br/>
Books about unschooling talk about democratic family meetings?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So when kids in your families continually do <br/>
<br/>
something inappropriate what do you do to stop them? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Talk to them.  But it&#39;s rare.  My husband and I try to model &quot;appropriate&quot; <br/>
and we try to be so generous with our kids that the kids are so far from <br/>
neediness that there&#39;s no advantage to &quot;inappropriate&quot; behavior, and by seeing our <br/>
children as whole beings who are already living their lives (as opposed to <br/>
preparing to live their lives sometime in the future when we release them), <br/>
&quot;inappropriate&quot; is not a term that comes up very often at all.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you give us examples of inappropriate behavior people can give you <br/>
more specific examples of how they&#39;ve dealt with their own real children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-577157373">Sandra I&#39;m not cynical about cheerfullness and I definately agree <br/>
that happiness is much better than a clean floor - I live it every <br/>
day! When I saw your post I just see me hopping around and singing <br/>
something like the Barney &quot;clean up&quot; song and for me it&#39;s more like <br/>
sweeping everything under the carpet as the in laws pull into the <br/>
drive. When I first started doing daycare more than 5 years ago I <br/>
used to tell everyone I loved my job because I got to play all day - <br/>
and everyone used to comment how untrue that must be because I had <br/>
to spend all the time picking up, changing diapers, feeding, etc. I <br/>
didn&#39;t see it that way at all! Perhaps some of everyone else&#39;s <br/>
cynacism has seeped into me over the years, I&#39;m not sure - I <br/>
certainly hope not. And I certainly hope that I don&#39;t have problems <br/>
here - this is the first busy board on this subject that I have <br/>
found and I am so interested in learning more about it! Although, <br/>

advocate&quot;  because I like to hear what people think about all side <br/>
of the situation, please just me know if my horns are showing too <br/>
much! <br/>
    I&#39;ll try to make a list of the books I have read about <br/>
unschooling so I can reference them better. I&#39;ll start with having <br/>
read several by Holt(How Children Fail, How Children Learn, Learning <br/>
All the Time), Neill&#39;s Summerhill, Several about Sudbury Schools, <br/>
Albany Free school, Unschooling our children (deschooling <br/>
ourselves), the Happy Child, No Homework and Recess all Day, any <br/>
many more.<br/>
   Actually it is rare that we have disagreements with ds, but <br/>
unfortunately it is rare also that we have a long conversation <br/>
either, which is something I would like to encourage but am unsure <br/>
where to start other than just &quot;being there&quot; for him if he needs me, <br/>
I am apparently going to have to rethink the &quot;natural consequences&quot; <br/>
way of childrearing which is what we prettymuch what we used instead <br/>
of kinds of punishements our parents and community use, please <br/>
excuse me that I don&#39;t understand all of this yet as I am still <br/>
learning! Do you recommend a particular book that I haven&#39;t read <br/>
yet? <br/>

for: the AlwaysLearning list is for list members, and list members here are<br/>
already unschooling*, thus &quot;unschooling speak&quot; is indeed everyone&#39;s (who is<br/>
here) language.<br/>
<br/>
When posting here, I&#39;ve always found it a good idea to post real and honest<br/>
examples from my real and honest life or to ask real and honest questions<br/>
about others real and honest lives. &quot;Playing devil&#39;s advocate&quot; (i.e, making<br/>
up hypotheticals for the sake of argument) is less useful than reality.<br/>

myself thinking about something my dd does as being &quot;inappropriate&quot;, but<br/>
then I usually try to ask &quot;what need isn&#39;t being met&quot; in order to help sort<br/>
it out, or I&#39;ll question my own expectations.  But it&#39;s still a struggle, I<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids tend to be loud and rambunctious.  At home it means that I have to change rooms when I talk on the phone.  But when we aren&#39;t home it can be disturbing to others.  I also struggle with frustration that I can&#39;t control them better when they begin to feed off on another&#39;s energy.  They tend to make happy noise but it can be a lot of noise.<br/>

full of unschoolers who already get it so we don&#39;t hash out the details as<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand what you&#39;re saying. But it&#39;s also respectful to be aware that<br/>
people on the list are willing taking family time to answer questions.<br/>
People feel good about answering sincere questions. Questions meant just to<br/>
sound things out can feel like someone&#39;s just toying with our time and feel<br/>
the answer to a pretend question is more important than the time people will<br/>
give up from their lives to answer it.<br/>

I&#39;ve noticed that since my daughter turned 12 that she&#39;s much better at<br/>
self-reflection than she used to be. I used to ask her how she felt about<br/>
something or what she thought was wrong and all she could say was &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
know.&quot; More questioning didn&#39;t help her see any clearer. It just irritated<br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; please <br/>
&gt; excuse me that I don&#39;t understand all of this yet<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We kind of expect that people don&#39;t understand! If people understood then we<br/>
wouldn&#39;t need to offer advice and suggestions on ways that might work<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps to see that you make the best choice you can with the<br/>
knowledge you have at the time. Like a family meeting is better than a swat.<br/>
But *expect* that you won&#39;t be making the best choice that anyone could have<br/>
made. Maybe the best choice hasn&#39;t been thought up yet! We&#39;re pointing to a<br/>
place that&#39;s better than where you are because we have different knowledge<br/>
than you do. It shouldn&#39;t be seen as criticizing where you are.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s just that of the children<br/>
&gt; I know (I should know better than compare children) that they almost<br/>
&gt; always seem to be able to pick up after themselves starting at about<br/>
&gt; 3 years of age - NO KIDDING!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What has been done to them that they do that though?<br/>
<br/>
And my daughter has always been more conscious of cleaning up behind heself<br/>
and other matters of politeness when at other peoples&#39; houses.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But you also need to understand that I<br/>
&gt; am considered pretty much a &quot;Revolutionist&quot; in my neighborhood that<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t spank my child!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it will be even more helpful for you to understand that being<br/>
revolutionary *is* a relative term. Slapping a child&#39;s hand instead of a<br/>
thrashing may be revolutionary and a better choice, but there are *even<br/>
better* choices than that.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;Look how far I&#39;ve come!&quot; is comforting and supportive of yourself<br/>
for doing something better. But it will hinder you from growing even<br/>
*further*.<br/>
<br/>
In a way it&#39;s like feeling that by turning a cold shoulder to a Jew you&#39;re<br/>
doing much better than the Nazis around who you are doing even worse. It&#39;s a<br/>
way to stay stuck.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can someone point me to some<br/>

&gt; getting a clue about some of the basics and I think ds would enjoy<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Dark Basic I&#39;ve heard is good. I don&#39;t know if it will work for a 6 yo.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So when kids in your families continually do<br/>
&gt; something inappropriate what do you do to stop them?<br/>

<br/>
With the hitting situation I&#39;d assume that despite knowing better that he<br/>
just wasn&#39;t able to put it into practice. I&#39;d continue giving him the<br/>
information he needed. I&#39;d give him the chance to do it again, like saying<br/>
&quot;Hitting hurts. Could you use words please.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If it were something more serious like hitting a sibling, that would call<br/>
for different reaction. But real examples are easier to offer suggestions to<br/>
because it&#39;s *why* something is happening that&#39;s important, not *what*<br/>
happened.<br/>
