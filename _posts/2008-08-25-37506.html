<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630137633">My son J is almost 7.  He has so many interests and loves to be out <br/>
and about and playing with friends.  When he was younger we lived in <br/>
a house that backed up to another house where his friend Eli lived.  <br/>
The boys didnt play together all that often as Eli was in school and <br/>
split his time at his dads house but when they could they got <br/>
together and really always had a connection.  The other family moved <br/>
away in the  spring and in the summer we moved.  J still talks about <br/>
Eli alot.  They have seen each other once or twice last summer but <br/>
not any in about a year.  I tried to keep in touch but his mother <br/>
works full time, lives about 1 1/2 hours away and has to commute an <br/>
hour to work etc...has 4 kids under 8.  Every so often J asks about <br/>
Eli, will he ever see him again.. I breaks my heart but I dont know <br/>
really what to do.  I asked him tonight, what about Eli made him <br/>
special?  thinking maybe I could help him find another friend like <br/>
that.  But, he just looked like he was going to cry and said, &quot;he is <br/>
Eli&quot;.  He says he has no other friends like him.  It breaks my heart <br/>
that I havnt been able to help him find other friends that he has <br/>
that connection with, feels that comfortable with etc.. I guess I <br/>
dont really know what my question is.  It is just hard to see him so <br/>
sad and I feel like I am not doing enough.  <br/>
I will try to get in touch with Eli&#39;s mother again but havnt had much <br/>
luck the last few times.  She is very scattered and busy.</div>

 </span></blockquote>If you are able to make the drive, and if the Mom would be okay with<br/>
it, then you could drive out there, pick up Eli and take the boys to<br/>
the park for a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
This would lower the time investment for Eli&#39;s Mom. She wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
to worry about transportation or entertaining another adult.<br/>
<br/>
If that worked, then you could set up a preplanned playdate for once a<br/>
month - weather permitting.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you can only manage a meeting like that once, bring a camera<br/>
and take lots of photos.<br/>

<br/>
I like that idea.  In the meantime, maybe you could send him a card  <br/>
or letter with photos so he knows J is still thinking of him.<br/>
