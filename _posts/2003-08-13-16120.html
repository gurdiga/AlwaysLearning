<div id="ygrps-yiv-1326404110">&quot;So someone<br/>
take pity on me and pull me into the group if I&#39;m standing there like a deer<br/>
in headlights, ok?   ~Rue (lover of cheap champagne)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh C&#39;mon Rue...ya really think Dagny will let you do THAT? :)<br/>
Don&#39;t worry, one of us extroverts will grab your butt and haul you along.<br/>
<br/>
I think Pam G&#39;s wine sounds GREAT!! I&#39;ve never had homemade wine before. You think I would&#39;ve tried making it myself by now, what with my interest in medieval times.<br/>
<br/>
And Diane, I&#39;ll probably have all four of mine with...so it&#39;s not exactly a ladies night out, more like a clan get together!!<br/>
I&#39;m not even going to ask Trevor to watch Jalen, he&#39;ll be too busy with all the online-turned-irl friends he&#39;s made. So we just have to find a spot that will accomodate some wine imbibing mums with some velcro-like kids attached. Maybe a conference room? Kelly?<br/>

(Jackie Chan, Samurai Jack, that kinda stuff), but he&#39;s may not want to be <br/>
too far from me either, so if someone has a suite there might be room <br/>
enough for the young&#39;uns to be in one part of the suite and us moms in <br/>
another.  Just a thought.<br/>

wining---as long as a couple are just whining and not imbibing.<br/>

home swimming pool.  My pool is only 15 x 30 feet, so it&#39;s easy to watch <br/>
everyone in it.<br/>

I can swish and spit &lt;g&gt;  (although I&#39;ve never been to an official wine<br/>

IS THIS AN INSIDE JOKE???<br/>
