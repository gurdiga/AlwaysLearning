<div id="ygrps-yiv-693075581">Hi,<br/>
   I was reading the bible thread. The ancient Hebrew laws are way out there! <br/>
&quot;one can beat his Hebrew slave, and kill him, but not be put to death.&quot; &quot;one will be put to death if they kill another Hebrew who is not a slave&quot;. <br/>
And, racy, &quot; I can not bear thee a child, please take my servant woman&quot;.<br/>
 &quot;hey, sis, we won&#39;t have any men to care for us once dad is gone, lets get dad drunk, so we can get pregnant&quot;, etc., etc. <br/>
Also, Genesis chapters one and two really contradict each other. <br/>
I like to think that Jesus brought patience, forgiveness, do unto others, etc. to the harsh Hebrew laws, but many other religions and cultures offer similar modes of thought.<br/>
I really enjoyed reading about Zen, thanks for sending it. <br/>
