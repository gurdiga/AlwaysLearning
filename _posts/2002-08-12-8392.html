&lt;&lt; I&#39;m wondering about carrier pigeons...Were they used before the middle<br/>
ages?? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A clue from a quiz for kids from the Bath Postal Museum:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bathpostalmuseum.org/Schools/Key_Stage_2/ks2_quiz/ks2_quiz.html">http://www.bathpostalmuseum.org/Schools/Key_Stage_2/ks2_quiz/ks2_quiz.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The carrier pigeon question was in the 1840 and after section.<br/>
<br/>
Just reading the quiz without knowing the answers or clicking on links for <br/>
promised illustrations was pretty educational!<br/>
<br/>
Still looking.<br/>

Sez that site: <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The carrier pigeon is known to have been used by the Roman army during the <br/>
conquest of Gaul. <br/>
<br/>
Woohoo!<br/>
<br/>
and of Egyptian pigeon keeping:<br/>
<br/>
Pigeons were kept in ancient Egypt as early as 1000  B.C.  Their ability to <br/>
return home over strange terrain has long made them valued for carrying <br/>
messages.</div>

Those crafty Egyptians were brewing beer too.  How do you suppose someone<br/>
figured out about the pigeons??<br/>
Did some guy get stinking drunk and decide to strap a love note to some<br/>
poor bird and launch him off?   <br/>
<br/>
I can tell I&#39;m going to have to look into this.  Living with a pigeon and<br/>
all...<br/>
