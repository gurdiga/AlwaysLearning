<div id="ygrps-yiv-1062170453"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; -=-But that evening, she asked to sleep with us.Â  She told<br/>
&gt; me, &quot;I&#39;ve missed a whole day of hugs with you, Mommy. I&#39;ve got to<br/>
&gt; catch up!&quot; :) -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is feeling sick so he&#39;s not going to his job today.   He works alone, <br/>
doing some of the gruntwork of bootmaking for a friend of ours.    Lately he&#39;s <br/>
skated down there and taken the bus back, because we&#39;re down one car, but <br/>
today he just doesn&#39;t feel like it.    <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s talked about finding another job.   Sadie, a homeschooled 20 year old <br/>
who&#39;s been staying with us, is looking for a restaurant job.   I&#39;ve joked (kind <br/>
of joking) about them infiltrating the Albuquerque Old Town hotel so we&#39;ll <br/>
have people on the inside before next year&#39;s conference.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1483756210">music from the Flintstones:<br/>
<br/>
(Homer sings as he is driving his car)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Simpson, Homer Simpson<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s the greatest guy in history<br/>

From the town of Springfield<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s about to hit a chestnut tree&quot;<br/>
<br/>
DH, DS and I have been falling off the couch with laughter watching season 4<br/>
of the Simpsons. I had forgotten how funny that show was/is.<br/>
<br/>
We have season one as well - first disk is not very funny but the other 2<br/>
are alright (not fall-off-the-couch funny, but you can tell they are only<br/>
going to get funnier)<br/>
<br/>
looking forward to getting season 5<br/>
