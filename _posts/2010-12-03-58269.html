<div id="ygrps-yiv-1399257816">I just finished a new page.  I usually announce those here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a><br/>
and I will, still, <br/>
but I really like the layout and each photo is a link so I was excited to share it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Also, please, if you&#39;ve thought of buying one of my books or you might want to buy one as a gift for someone else, now would be a great time for it!   (We have a new shipment, and I&#39;m home for the next two weeks; not in India as I was, not in Texas as I will be...)<br/>

<br/>
Also:  Holly did that art, and I&#39;m giddy/happy about Holly&#39;s ability to do photoshop stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
More personal art of hers (and fancier) is here:<br/>

(and those are a few years old, too)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for being a part of this list, which is such a big part of my life for over nine years now.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  To the trolls who hang out and scavenge unhappy posters and invite them to other lists, I hope that for Christmas you get your own life and interests, and that you might become so happy and whole that you stop living in the shadow of a list you profess to despise.  Merry Christmas!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481279141">Isn&#39;t it funny how trolls try to get travelers to pay up or convince the<br/>
trolls of the trickery in their riddles in order to use unschooling or books<br/>
or movies or computer games or any number of those kinds of bridges as<br/>
diverse paths to learning? In a way, trolls are amazingly unintentionally<br/>
insightful and inciteful. Oh my god! Instead of being bound within the<br/>
covers of books and the confines of school, there it is: instructions and<br/>
directions and arrows point to all sorts of things.<br/>
<br/>
How about the sign that says &quot;This way to Toledo&quot; and at the end of the<br/>
arrow there&#39;s a huge truck in the way from the viewer&#39;s vantage point? Is<br/>
the viewer seeing in two dimensions or three (or more)? Or how about<br/>
handmaking the binding and covering of a book rather than limiting oneself<br/>
to the reading of the pages within? Or writing (or re-writing) the story<br/>
yourself? Or how about reading between the lines? I like all of those. I am<br/>
a book or perhaps I am a whole library of the things. Some are still in the<br/>
midst (the mists?) of production.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I woke up thinking that the number of choices is always (not<br/>
just sometimes) more than I think. And as we might not always remember,<br/>
numbers are not finite. They just keep going. Rhetorial counting; Tell me<br/>
the last number of the choices we have, the total quantity of choices<br/>
available.<br/>
