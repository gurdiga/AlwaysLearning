<div id="ygrps-yiv-148749054">Looking for an opinion - I tutor a 5th grade Special Education student twice a<br/>
week. I kind of half-jokingly said that I could homeschool him, and he mentioned<br/>
it to his mom. She&#39;s actually interested in the idea (but wants to do some<br/>
research)! Have you ever heard of someone paying someone else to homeschool<br/>
their kid? Do you think it could work out? I am intrigued with the idea!<br/>

P.S. - I plan to unschool my own child, but she is only 17 months old!</div>

<br/>
This is going to be a question about laws, and not ideal for this list.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of it is as &quot;enrichment,&quot; but the parents have the  <br/>
responsibility for the homeschooling, maybe it could work.  In some  <br/>
states it might not matter.  In New Mexico, homeschooling needs to be  <br/>
the parents.  It would be better to say you were doing day care and  <br/>
have whatever arrangements you want with the parents.   If you have  <br/>
special ed credentials, that would help (in some jurisdictions maybe).<br/>
<br/>
This is another of those &quot;responsibility&quot; things.   If there is a  <br/>
compulsory attendance law, the state has taken responsibility for  <br/>
providing education for kids.  If there&#39;s an exception to that law in  <br/>
a certain state or country or province, then what&#39;s happening is  <br/>
someone else is saying &quot;I&#39;ll take responsibility.&quot;   It might not be  <br/>
legal for just anyone to take responsibility for someone&#39;s education.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another consideration is that unless a child will be with you twenty- <br/>
four hours a day so that you created a relationship and an environment  <br/>
conducive to a full life of learning, what would you provide?  Six or  <br/>
eight hours a day some days a week isn&#39;t the same as unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s going to depend on the education statutes in your state. Local groups <br/>
would be a better source of information.<br/>
<br/>
You were joking and are intrigued, but assuming it is legal, you would be <br/>
responsible (in that answering to someone else sense from the other thread) <br/>
for the 5th grader for all school hours of all school days (as defined by <br/>
your state DOE). How would that jive with being a present, mindful mom for <br/>
your 17 month old? Maybe it would work out, but that would be my first <br/>
consideration in your position.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH lots of homeschooling moms in my area offer individual classes in <br/>
different areas of their expertise to other home schooling families. They <br/>
range from very schooly in structure, to relatively relaxed, and usually <br/>
there is some kind of small fee. Others coordinate official clubs like 4H or <br/>
Lego or Robotics, or use their memberships with museums to create classes or <br/>
activities.<br/>
<br/>
However the majority of these offerings are parent attendance as well, <br/>
rather than drop-off situations. The responsibility for the children remains <br/>
with their own parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039502968">Hi Jennie.  I know two families that do that in NC.  One of the drawbacks I&#39;ve heard mentioned are that the parents have such a big say in WHAT and HOW you teach their children.  With the one family, they tried it for a year, then stopped.  I don&#39;t know why they stopped.  The other family I know has done it for around 8 years now, and they are all happy with the arrangement.  The teacher is certified and uses a very structured curriculum, just like school.  I&#39;m sure unschooling would be a different story.  Jimi Ann</div>
