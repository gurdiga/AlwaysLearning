How about one about school?  I just read the eye-opening, appalling &quot;What<br/>
Happened to Recess and Why Are Our Children Struggling in Kindergarten?&quot; by<br/>
Susan Ohanian.  It&#39;s about those great tests your sister is so worked up<br/>
about. **<br/>
<br/>
I also like Alfie Kohn&#39;s book, The Schools Our Children Deserve.  The <br/>
things he recommends, like following a child&#39;s interests, are easy to do <br/>
at home and hard to do in the classroom.  And he backs up everything he <br/>
says with research.<br/>
