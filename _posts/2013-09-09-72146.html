Like you do... <br/>
:-)<br/>
<br/>
Like school kids don&#39;t, if it&#39;s not on the homework or going to be on a test.  Even if it&#39;s to be on a test, they&#39;ll just look in the book.<br/>
<br/>
I do love stories like that.<br/>

I remember back in our early days of unschooling, of worrying about how she would &quot;learn math&quot; since I have such anxiety surrounding anything math or numbers related. She doesn&#39;t have that anxiety. No one judging her for not &quot;getting it&quot; or trying to show her the &quot;best&quot; way to arrive at an answer. Instead she&#39;s had the space to learn in her time and her way, and as she needs it. Today we were playing Animal Jam together and she needed about 2000 points to be able to buy something for her animal. She was somewhere in the neighborhood of 1150 already and so she asked me to play the &quot;dress-up&quot; game which gets 200 0points each time you win. Without even hesitating she said, if you can win at least 5 times I&#39;ll have enough plus some extra.&quot;. It&#39;s just a part of everyday use, not some abstract calculation that someone else thinks is important to figure out :)</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-305346003ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;blossomholly@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-305346003ygrps-yiv-420424986"><p>My six year old needs to crack a code (he calls it) for an ipad game.

<br/>
J:&#39;Mum! Is four sixteens sixty-four?&#39;<br/>
Me: &#39;Yup. How did you figure that out?&#39;<br/>
J: &#39;from quivers&#39;<br/>
<br/>
And yesterday:<br/>
J: &#39;Look! A &#39;V&#39;, I&#39;ve got five of something&#39; (enchantments are represented by roman numerals in minecraft).<br/>
<br/>
And other things like noticing that the most of anything you can collect in one [minecraft inventory] square is 64, and using symmetry in his minecraft building and calculations like &#39;if one iron ingot makes 20 bullets then how many will I need to make 48?&#39; (that&#39;s one he asked me rather than working it out himself).<br/>
<br/>
I figure he might be interested in more roman numerals and multiplication table type stuff so I&#39;ll print a couple of charts out and leave them about somewhere.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-237447566">My 10 year old daughter and I were watching Brat Camp UK on Youtube.   She is fascinated by these sorts of &#39;kids behaving badly&#39; programmes.    I mentioned that soon I would have to go out and shut the chickens away.   She looked at the progress bar, which showed that we were something like 26.45 minutes into a 47.24 programme.   &quot;We&#39;re over half way,&quot; she said.  &quot;There&#39;s only just over 20 minutes to go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mental subtraction of decimals, conversion to fractions AND estimating all in one go.   I remember estimation tripped me up for *ages* in school ... couldn&#39;t understand why we were being asked to &#39;guess&#39; something when they&#39;d already shown us how to work it out exactly.   It never made sense for me until I actually had to estimate something out in the real world.    By starting off with the real world applications, hopefully my daughters will never have to suffer the general foggy confusion over maths that I did.<br/>

Later she was making a list in one of those &quot;composition&quot; notebooks - in the back they have all kinds of references, like grammar or math facts.  She finds this interesting.  In this one it explained how much wood is in a &quot;cord of wood&quot;. She thought this was pretty cool - She got to relate this knowledge to something she did herself and we discussed whether she thought the amount of wood she unloaded was a cord, how 3D dimensions work, etc.</span><br style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-size:10.909090995788574px;line-height:12.727272033691406px;background-color:rgb(237,239,244);">

She said very matter-of-fact - &quot;Mom, four 16s is 64&quot;. Then showed me how she found out. She had 64 total of cobblestone, and in the graph they use to create in the game, she had 4 blocks worth 16 each.  </span><br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971966859"><div dir="ltr">My son (17) learned to calculate thrust ratios for a rocketry simulation game.  Gerber Space something or other... <div><br></div><div>When he was working on it, I asked if he wanted any help (his father was a math minor and I took lots of math in school/college) and he replied that he felt it was easier to find resources on the net because even if he couldn&#39;t articulate the exact question, he would know which information was useful when he saw it.   </div>
<div><br></div><div>I have to admit that a small part of me felt disappointed (I enjoyed when we would team up to find answers or I could explain something or other to him), but a larger part was immensely happy that my son is such a confident living-learning-living guy.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>I have adult friends who are very intelligent and can pinpoint the exact moment when they became fearful of math in school because of &#39;failure&#39; in a math class.  An unschooled person learns what they want when they want to, and not a minute sooner; and this usually follows some perceived need or desire to get the answer to a particular question... </div>
<div><br></div><div>My daughter (15) has recently decided that she will get a GED in the future (she doesn&#39;t have to, but feels it will be the easiest path to her goals).  She did some research and found some prep tests and these indicated that her math skills needed some improvement.  She did some more research and found Kahn academy and has been working through that to get to whatever level will enable her to pass the math portion of the GED.  </div>
<div><br></div><div>I found out all of this when I saw her writing out long division problems and asked what she was working on.  Her plan, her research, her success.  I love it when a plan comes together.... :)</div><div>
