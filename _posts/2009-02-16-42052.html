<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666119221">My dd16, Claire, lived with her dad & stepmom and attended public <br/>
school until she was 14.  They are both school teachers.  She moved <br/>
in with me just before high school began and finished 2 years of high <br/>
school.  They were completely against her quitting school to <br/>
homeschool.  She chose to enroll in an accredited correspondence <br/>
program to finish her diploma because she knew they wanted her to <br/>
have a diploma.  But she has not done much school work this year.  We <br/>
were talking and I suggested she post to this list if she wanted to <br/>
hear from real unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
From Claire:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling very frustrated and angry because I feel everyone around <br/>
me expects me to do school and go on to college.  I don&#39;t know if I <br/>
want to go to college.  It makes no sense to me that something that <br/>
seems so useless right now is so important to everyone else.  My mom <br/>
has mixed feelings about it.  She talks to me about unschooling but <br/>
it is such a weird idea to me that I don&#39;t know what to think.  My <br/>
step dad feels I should at least finish my high school diploma <br/>
because I&#39;m so close and mom agrees sometimes.  At the same time, I <br/>
know I do not want to finish this stupid coursework I have and I <br/>
don&#39;t want to even think about anything to do with school.  <br/>
<br/>
What do unschooling teens do?  How do they learn?  Do they plan to go <br/>
to college?  How do they answer questions about what is going on in <br/>
their lives?  My dad, stepmom, friends and some relatives are <br/>
constantly asking me what courses I&#39;m taking, how my grades are, when <br/>
I will graduate, have I taken the SAT, what colleges am I applying <br/>
to, what major I want to be, where will I live, will I get a drivers <br/>
license and car, how will I get to school if I don&#39;t drive, and lots <br/>
of other stupid questions I don&#39;t have answers for right now.  I just <br/>
want to scream I DON&#39;T KNOW and DON&#39;T CARE RIGHT NOW.  Why do I have <br/>
to make these decisions right now?<br/>
<br/>
All I want to do right now is hang out with my friends, play World of <br/>
Warcraft, and work 2 days a week at my part-time job that I love.  I <br/>
work at a gelato and chocolates place and love making the <br/>
chocolates.  I&#39;ve thought about culinary school but my dad went with <br/>
me to visit one a couple of weeks ago and now he and my stepmom are <br/>
all into it and I don&#39;t know if I want to do it.  It&#39;s really <br/>
expensive and of course they told me they&#39;d be willing to help me pay <br/>
for school if I would live with them.  I really do not want to live <br/>
with them again.  My mom keeps asking me if I&#39;m going to finish my <br/>
high school classes and I don&#39;t know that either.  I just really <br/>
don&#39;t know what to do right now.<br/>
<br/>
Back to beth again:<br/>
<br/>
I know I&#39;ve not been helpful because of my mixed messages.  I really <br/>
would be supportive of her unschooling but I feel like she should <br/>
make a decision rather than waffling back and forth.  I think she is <br/>
scared to not do school so she just keeps putting the schoolwork <br/>
off.  Her dad has a similar problem solving method.  It&#39;s like she <br/>
just wants the whole topic to go away, but then she goes to her dad&#39;s <br/>
house and they talk incessantly about school & college.  Part of me <br/>
thinks she should just finish the diploma because she can show it to <br/>
them and prove she can do it.  They told her if she quit school, <br/>
she&#39;d never graduate and would be a failure.  Their opinion seems <br/>
really important to her.  She&#39;s also told me that when she turns 18, <br/>
she wants to move to another state so she doesn&#39;t have to deal with <br/>
them.  I don&#39;t know what to do or what to say to her anymore.  Most <br/>
of the time I leave her alone and/or tell her it&#39;s always her choice, <br/>
but her visits with her dad put us both on edge.  Argh!  But she also <br/>
refuses to stop visiting her dad because she really loves her dad <br/>
even though she&#39;s always uncomfortable at their house.<br/>
<br/>
How do I help her when she doesn&#39;t even know what she wants?  I am <br/>
not surprised that she doesn&#39;t want to make such big decisions now <br/>
but she&#39;s being pressured on a daily basis by someone or other.  She <br/>
tries to hide away in her room but at some point she&#39;s going to have <br/>
to tell her dad about what she is doing or not doing.  How do I <br/>
advise her?<br/>

<br/>
If the conditions under which she was allowed to live with you were  <br/>
that she would finish that coursework and you all agreed to it, can  <br/>
you help her with it?  Can you sit and have your hand on the pencil  <br/>
and talk her through it as quickly as possible and just get it done?<br/>
<br/>
This is an out-there idea, but maybe you could look into the cost of  <br/>
in-patient treatment for teen angst and depression (whatever those  <br/>
hospitals are where families put teens they can&#39;t deal with) and get  <br/>
prices.  Then tell him she needs a mental health break of at least six  <br/>
months, and if she goes to the treatment place it will be umpty- <br/>
thousand dollars and she&#39;ll always have to list that on resumes and  <br/>
questionnaires forever, OR she could have a break at your house, a  <br/>
REAL break from school and talking about school, SOLID, and the break  <br/>
starts over everyone someone breaks school-subject silence.<br/>
<br/>
If you sell it well, it might sound inexpensive and easy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1019352736">The pressure expressed in this post is incredible.  My reaction is, like Sandra&#39;s, to arrange <br/>
for some kind of a break.  Is it possible to take some amount of time off from school, and <br/>
then to go back to it if that is Claire&#39;s decision?  Is the time pressure real or imagined?<br/>
<br/>
To Claire:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What do unschooling teens do?  <br/>
<br/>
My unschooling teen does what he wants to do most of the time.  He is 13 1/2, which is <br/>
different than 16, but I&#39;m still going back to the question in my mind, which is why is a 16 <br/>
year old experiencing this much pressure from parents regarding the future?  Where is the <br/>
support and space for Claire to figure out what she would like to do?<br/>
<br/>
The moment Claire expressed an interest in cooking, a whole future was laid out for <br/>
culinary school.  There just needs to be more breathing room in the whole situation!<br/>
<br/>
How do they learn?  <br/>
<br/>
By following his own interests.  By having ideas and then doing them, or not.  By spending <br/>
lots of time on the computer with the resources of the world at his fingertips.  By <br/>
conversing with adults and other kids, and reading and listening and watching, and <br/>
watching t.v.  By going places.  By me and others helping to draw historical connections to <br/>
current events.<br/>
<br/>
Do they plan to go <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to college?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He is planning that he will go to college, because all of his major fields of interest are <br/>
pretty academic.  We won&#39;t know about my daughter because her interests have always <br/>
been very different.  It will largely depend on what she wants to do, and whether college <br/>
can support that or not.<br/>
<br/>
My own experience is that my own interests weren&#39;t particularly supported, but I was <br/>
&quot;required&quot; to go to college.  I wish that I had worked for a few years and just lived my life, <br/>
because I never found what I really wanted to do that was college related.  I ended up with <br/>
two degrees that I have kind of used, but not really.<br/>
<br/>
My take away message was that college needs to serve us.  College necessarily lead to an <br/>
end in and of itself--it is a tool for furthering goals.<br/>
<br/>
How do they answer questions about what is going on in <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; their lives?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t even aware that 16 year olds are already applying to colleges.  It seems too soon <br/>
to have answers to all this stuff.  If they are just trying to make conversation, maybe you <br/>
can be more proactive and talk about a hobby or interest you are into right now.  Or <br/>
perhaps you can come up with a good answer that would stop questions, like, &quot;I am going <br/>
to take classes at the JC until I decide for sure.&quot;  And that can be a good way to try some <br/>
different things, like cooking classes, without all the hefty financial commitment.  And, <br/>
although I wouldn&#39;t want to be quoted about this, I think that once you have a JC <br/>
background, many colleges don&#39;t care much about whether you have a diploma or not, <br/>
because you&#39;d be a transfer student rather than an incoming freshman.<br/>
<br/>
To Mom:<br/>
Can you talk with your ex and try get the &quot;heat&quot; off?  Maybe explaining that this is causing <br/>
depression or nervous condition, or something along those lines?<br/>
<br/>
It just really feels like she needs more space, and to not feel like there is a race that she is <br/>
constantly losing.  It&#39;s not true, you know.  There is no race.  If she doesn&#39;t go to college <br/>
now, now, now, she could choose to go later.  The money could be put aside for her for <br/>
when she is ready--or as a down payment on a house is she chooses not to go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1900913687">-=-If they are just trying to make conversation-=-<br/>
<br/>
And they probably are--it&#39;s another version of &quot;what grade are you  <br/>
in?  Do you like your teacher? What&#39;s your favorite subject?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-...maybe you<br/>
can be more proactive and talk about a hobby or interest you are into  <br/>
right now.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, or maybe practice a serene smile and say &quot;I&#39;m still thinking  <br/>
about it.  What would you do in my situation? &quot; and smile.  Put THEM  <br/>
on the spot.  Or maybe say &quot;What were you doing when you were 16?&quot;   <br/>
Make it an honest question.  My mom was working in a cafe in Carlsbad,  <br/>
New Mexico.   My dad, at that age (not the same year, because he&#39;s  <br/>
five years older) was working in a shipyard in San Francisco, a long  <br/>
way from his home in Rotan, Texas.  The next year he joined the army.   <br/>
When my mom was 17, she got married.<br/>
<br/>
If you can get older people telling those kinds of stories, it will  <br/>
totally take some heat off you.   And say you asked me.  Ask me.    <br/>
(pretending to hear it)<br/>
<br/>
When I was sixteen I was graduating from high school a year early so I  <br/>
could go to college.  I was smoking a lot of dope, playing guitar a  <br/>
lot and ditching class.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you do get them talking and they talk about college, ask them what  <br/>
was the most fun about it.  Ask if they still work in the field they  <br/>
studied.  If not, JUMP ON THAT!  Ask why not, or if they ever did.<br/>
<br/>
The holy grail of college isn&#39;t made of anything very solid at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, on this:<br/>

<br/>
Yep.  If you have good grades from any school and you&#39;re over 18,  <br/>
hardly anyone will ever care again whether you started as a freshman  <br/>
at a hoity school after a perfect high school stint.    And more than  <br/>
that, if you&#39;ve gone to some college, then forever more on  <br/>
applications for jobs when it says &quot;highest level of education,&quot; you  <br/>
can skip by the question of high school and mark (or write) &quot;some  <br/>
college.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What about a GED?  That would take all the pressure off.  Here&#39;s a list<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbceducator.net/ged/famouspeople.htm">http://www.pbceducator.net/ged/famouspeople.htm</a>&gt;   of famous folks with<br/>
a GED.  Not that you want to pressure her into fame, it&#39;s just a nice<br/>
validation that a GED isn&#39;t failure, and that it doesn&#39;t create failure<br/>
to quit school.<br/>
<br/>
Without knowing how school decisions are made within your custody<br/>
arrangements, I would say that you could be the one to take the pressure<br/>
off.  Don&#39;t talk about it anymore.  Have a conversation, list all the<br/>
options, maybe write them down, then leave it alone and leave her alone.<br/>
<br/>
Kids will do what they do, wether we want them to or not.  The best<br/>
thing a parent can do, IMO, is to be there to help when they need it. <br/>
Even if she were to live with her father and step mom, and they made her<br/>
go to school, it won&#39;t garauntee that she will go to school, or get good<br/>
grades or a diploma.  I would even argue that going to school and<br/>
getting bad grades is probably more harmful than dropping out and<br/>
getting a GED or taking classes at community college while<br/>
homeschooling.  The state universities around here, for example have a<br/>
minimum GPA for entrance, but if you don&#39;t have a GPA, they go by other<br/>
measures.  So, she could totally screw up her chances at going to<br/>
college by being forced to finish highschool just for graduating and<br/>
receiving a dimploma.<br/>
<br/>
Has she ever read The Teenage Liberation Handbook?  It&#39;s a good book,<br/>
very inspirational!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are absolutely no conditions. I pursued custody via an attorney <br/>
following the Georgia laws.  At age 14, she was deemed old enough to <br/>
choose where to live.  I have primary custody and while I am supposed <br/>
to discuss things with her father first, I have the ultimate decision <br/>
if we disagree.  He hated that she started homeschooling but there <br/>
wasn&#39;t anything legal he could do to stop her.  Compulsory school age <br/>
in Georgia is through the 16th birthday, which she has reached.  She <br/>
was attempting to homeschool with a structured program to pacify her <br/>
father&#39;s disappointment.  Of the 6 courses she&#39;s enrolled in, she&#39;s <br/>
halfway through 2 of them and has turned in a few assignments in 2 <br/>
others.  She&#39;s hated every moment of it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is an out-there idea, but maybe you could look into the cost<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The sad, ironic reality is that public school stressed her out so <br/>
much that she was put on medication for anxiety.  As the year has <br/>
gone on and she&#39;s attended some counseling, we&#39;ve (my dh, myself, and <br/>
her psychiatrist) have learned that a great deal of that anxiety is <br/>
because of her dad and stepmom, specifically their disappointment in <br/>
her not being what they want her to be and their really high <br/>
expectations for every aspect of her life.<br/>
<br/>
They also have another daughter who has been in a residential <br/>
hospital.  I won&#39;t go into details as it isn&#39;t my place but I do what <br/>
I can to help Claire not fall into that same mess.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the links.  I&#39;ve been reading the Teenage Liberation <br/>
Handbook today so she and I can go through it without her having to <br/>
read every page.  I&#39;m betting that once she hears what the book&#39;s <br/>
message is, she will be interested enough in reading some on her <br/>
own.  But I&#39;m all too happy to read it with her if she needs me to.  <br/>
I feel like I&#39;m having to help her undo so much damage done by her <br/>
other family.  :(<br/>

(California High School Proficiency Exam) which tests only English and math.<br/>
<br/>
Another option is to go through Beach High School. You could tell her <br/>
father that she is enrolled in Beach High School and Wes will help you <br/>
think about what you want to do and give you a diploma when you feel <br/>
you&#39;re ready to move beyond high school. I really recommend this - Wes <br/>
started out many years ago helping kids who were, for various reasons, <br/>
sick of school and knows what he&#39;s doing! Wes works with kids all over <br/>
the country. Here is his website - I&#39;d suggest that Claire take a look <br/>
at it herself. &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html">http://www2.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html</a>&gt;<br/>

started taking some community college classes when they were young <br/>
teens. They weren&#39;t really &quot;going to college&quot; in the sense of taking <br/>
regular general education courses, but they took voice class, ceramics, <br/>
drama, beginning guitar, photography, dance, and other fun activity <br/>
classes. When people talked to them about school, they could say, &#39;I go <br/>
to Cypress College.&quot; People assumed they were geniuses. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<h4>emiLy Q.</h4>
<time>16 Feb 2009, at 10:42pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746226293">When I was 16, I was going into my junior year of high school.  I did all<br/>
the high school / college thinking stuff, but the coolest thing I did when I<br/>
was 16 is that in June (after junior year) my best friend and I moved from<br/>
Tampa, Florida to Charlotte, NC and lived with her dad for the summer while<br/>
we worked at an amusement park.  After working for a few months, we set off<br/>
on a road trip that took us southwest to the US/Mexico border in Texas and<br/>
then back east home to Tampa.  That trip was easily the best two weeks of my<br/>
life so far, and I&#39;m SO glad I did it.  I&#39;m so glad my parents happily let<br/>
me do it.  This was in 1994, we had no cell phones or anything.  We were two<br/>
16 year old girls driving a 1978 VW Bus.  I&#39;m kind of amazed my parents let<br/>
me do that.   (I&#39;d put MY daughter in a more reliable vehicle and make sure<br/>
she has a phone! :) And if my daughter wants to do that, I wouldn&#39;t call HER<br/>
too often I hope.  We called home every few days if I recall correctly, I<br/>
think maybe my friend needed to call every day.)  But the fact that they<br/>
trusted us is amazing.  And we did have a great trip - the flat tire that<br/>
drove us to hitchhike and the blown starter that forced me to drive from<br/>
Louisiana to Florida without turning the engine off AT ALL just add to the<br/>
adventure... <br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ve gotten good ideas from others on this list, and I think if I<br/>
were you I&#39;d take a break and then maybe try to get through the coursework<br/>
to get the diploma.  Maybe find something else to talk to your dad about --<br/>
my dad sounds similar to yours but during high school it was easy for us to<br/>
connect by doing projects together.  Maybe if there is something for you and<br/>
he to do together, or talk about, he won&#39;t be so caught up in school?  I am<br/>
sure you know this, but he&#39;s just trying to help and do what he thinks is<br/>
best.<br/>

  &gt; validation that a GED isn&#39;t failure, and that it doesn&#39;t create failure<br/>
  &gt; to quit school.<br/>
  &gt; <br/>
<br/>
  Really good idea. If you happen to be in California, we have the CHSPE <br/>
  (California High School Proficiency Exam) which tests only English and math.<br/>
<br/>
  Another option is to go through Beach High School. You could tell her <br/>
  father that she is enrolled in Beach High School and Wes will help you <br/>
  think about what you want to do and give you a diploma when you feel <br/>
  you&#39;re ready to move beyond high school. I really recommend this - Wes <br/>
  started out many years ago helping kids who were, for various reasons, <br/>
  sick of school and knows what he&#39;s doing! Wes works with kids all over <br/>
  the country. Here is his website - I&#39;d suggest that Claire take a look <br/>
  at it herself. &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www2.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html">http://www2.cruzio.com/~beachhi/home.html</a>&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758541717">&lt;&lt;If you can get older people telling those kinds of stories, it will<br/>
totally take some heat off you. And say you asked me. Ask me.<br/>
(pretending to hear it)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I dropped out of high school about 3 weeks before my 16 birthday (which<br/>
would have been 1983) .  I also left home to live with my boyfriend (where I<br/>
could have more freedom).  I proceeded to smoke dope in freedom for the next<br/>
2 years.  I left the boyfriend when I was 18 and went back home and got my<br/>
GED.  Then partied for another 2 years until I hit rock-bottom and proceeded<br/>
to get sober.  Four years later I decided to go to college part-time.  I<br/>
finished my Assoc. degree with a 4.0 (I probably had a 2.something or lower<br/>
in high school and my ACT scores were horrible) . That GPA allowed me to<br/>
attend & recieve 75% of tuiton paid at a private college. While at this<br/>
college I recieved a Howard Hughes Grant that allowed me to work on a<br/>
project in the Biochemistry department at the University of Mississippi<br/>
Medical Center.  And I&#39;m a High School drop out.<br/>
<br/>
College is over rated.  While I was at this private college that happened to<br/>
be christian (not why i went btw) I had a friend that was pre-med and when<br/>
it was time for him to graduate they wouldn&#39;t let him b/c he hadn&#39;t taken<br/>
the required Old & New Testament and gone to chapel.  He had record hign<br/>
scores on the MCAT and UMC accetped him without a college degree.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570503036">Thanks for sharing your unconventional story!  It&#39;s more confirmation<br/>
for what I&#39;ve been thinking about all this stuff for a while.  You can<br/>
choose to jump through the hoops, but if you don&#39;t, it seems that you<br/>
can get to where you want to go anyway--and maybe be better off in the<br/>
long run for having forged your own path!<br/>
