living in Florida, it was nostalgic for us in a nice way, also very<br/>
encouraging to know that unschooling is accepted in the UK; as before<br/>
we left 6 years ago, I had never even heard of homeschooling being<br/>
very acceptable, much less unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What I liked most of all in the video was to see children and <br/>
parents, being together, naturally - not children playing with <br/>
children whilst parents sat at a safe distance away talking about <br/>
whatever it is they talk about .......school? grades? plans for <br/>
summer camp?  Excuse my cynicism. (Think I got that word right.) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1442831500">Yes, actually, people seem to be much more on the unschooling end of the spectrum here (Norfolk) than they are on the school-at-home end. Although when we lived near Newcastle it was definitely the reverse. My perception is that people here spend far less time researching the kind of home-education they want to do than people do in the U.S. Or maybe that is just me. I spend a lot of time reading and thinking and writing about how I want to home-educate. <br/>

lived in Brighton (&#39;97 to 2000) when I found out about homeschooling.  <br/>
The only homeschooler&#39;s I knew were attachment parenting unschoolers,  <br/>
so that&#39;s what I thought all homeschooling was like &lt;g&gt;. Little did I  <br/>
know...until I came to the US that there were all different kinds of  <br/>
homeschooling, and I was an unschooler.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know where Canada, Australia or New Zealand would fall in  <br/>
this comparison.  I&#39;m only talking UK and US here.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Helena was near York and then near London, for eight years  <br/>
or so.  Being American and knowing my family, she knew more of the  <br/>
differences in the U.S. but she wasn&#39;t aware that unschooling was the  <br/>
small minority method.<br/>
<br/>
There, for several reasons it seems to me (from the outside, from  <br/>
correspondence and comments and stories) the mainstream is more like  <br/>
unschooling, although it&#39;s called autonomous education.<br/>
<br/>
Because the Church of England is both state church and kind of  <br/>
secular religion, they don&#39;t have the focus on &quot;what church do you go  <br/>
to&quot; that so much of the U.S. has.  Those who were unschooling in the  <br/>
70&#39;s were doing it pretty quietly, and scattered out except for  <br/>
contact through  Growing Without Schooling, John Holt&#39;s publication  <br/>
(a newsletter, more than anything).   When the fundamentalists got  <br/>
separatist enough to want to pull their kids out of school, a whole  <br/>
industry sprang up of Christian curriculae, materials, a &quot;legal  <br/>
protection&quot; company (HSLDA), then rival publications and conferences,  <br/>
and politics, and a college or two for homeschooled Christian kids  <br/>
who want to take over the government...  all of that VERY loud and  <br/>
threatening and in the faces of lots of people, including secular  <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
The UK doesn&#39;t seem to have that.<br/>
<br/>
Parents aren&#39;t as awful to their kids in England as American parents  <br/>
became in the course of the growth of the U.S.  The protestant  <br/>
beliefs and prejudices that came from the colonists linger still.    <br/>
There is something concerning children&#39;s safety and rights on which  <br/>
the U.S. agrees only with Somalia.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a> <br/>
Convention_on_the_Rights_of_the_Child<br/>
<br/>
Another American friend of mine attended school in England  <br/>
(Cambridge) when she was 15, in the late 1970&#39;s.  Her dad was there  <br/>
on sabbatical and the family went.  She felt the teaching was much  <br/>
friendlier and more creative, and they weren&#39;t assuming everyone  <br/>
wanted to grow up to have a PhD (although this friend was  <br/>
exceptionally scholastic and her dad was a professor).   In her art  <br/>
class, there was a project to design a store logo and shopping bags  <br/>
to go with it.  I think the sign for the store, a logo, and a bag.   <br/>
That&#39;s cool, and useful.  Those skills are all over the internet now,  <br/>
the design of sets of elements for websites.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Meghan,<br/>
<br/>
That is funny! Maybe I had my head stuck in the sand, (not that <br/>
there is much sand near Birmingham in the Midlands, where we came <br/>
from).  It just never occurred to me that there was an alternative <br/>
to the schooling production line that I was so used to.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
until they were a little older (aged 6 and 8),and we were living in <br/>
the US, that they started to really show signs of being <br/>
uncomfortable and unhappy with school; and the more I looked into <br/>
it, the more unacceptable it seemed to be to me too.  Then, the very <br/>
first example of homeschooling we were exposed to appeared to be <br/>
just as controlling and offensive as being in school, so we just <br/>
stopped doing it.  Then, as if by magic, my kids just started to do <br/>
interesting and worthwhile things, having fun and being natural, <br/>
without any intervention from me other than taking them places and <br/>
providing answers to questions etc.  Feeling guilty, and as if I was <br/>
doing them a disservice, I did plenty of internet research and <br/>
discovered that this was unschooling - and even better, it was <br/>
perfectly legal and &quot;allowed&quot;.  I couldn&#39;t believe our luck!! I <br/>
still can&#39;t, pinch me, I must be dreaming.We haven&#39;t looked back <br/>
since.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, thank you Sandra, I should definitely have worded that better. <br/>
<br/>
At the time that I discovered that unschooling existed, it appeared <br/>
to me from all the various websites, blogs and lists I had come <br/>
across, that as many families are living this way of life, it must <br/>
of course be something that is &quot;perfectly legal&quot; and &quot;allowed&quot;.  On <br/>
looking deeper into it, of course, I soon realised that we still had <br/>
to abide by our school district&#39;s requirements and laws concerning <br/>
homeschool reporting etc.  I simply found the easiest way for our <br/>
family to do that, in line with Florida&#39;s laws, and subsequently, <br/>
the wonderful natural life we dreamed of did come into our reach in <br/>
a &quot;perfectly legal&quot; manner.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Doable&quot; is a much better word to have used, and I fully understand <br/>
the need to be accurate with our words on this list, so as not to <br/>
give out the wrong impression.<br/>
<br/>
Forgive me for my exuberance, I just still get so excited when I <br/>
wake up most days, and remember that we don&#39;t have to go to school <br/>
to learn, and I don&#39;t have to inflict that on my children.<br/>
<br/>
I assure you our family does get it, never needing to stand in any <br/>
other family&#39;s shadow, and it&#39;s mostly thanks to you, your essays <br/>
and blogs, and also writings by Joyce Fetteroll and Pam Sorooshian, <br/>
plus earlier contact with a great lady, Nance Confer who first <br/>
explained it all to me.<br/>
<br/>
Having been unschooling for a short while, it just seems so natural, <br/>
and when I look at the quality of the things my girls choose to do <br/>
with their time now, I know it works.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you once again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-778572013">Hi Folks!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Michelle and I&#39;m a WAHM considering unschooling my 5 year old <br/>
- he started K this year and is having a rough time.  I also have a 1 <br/>
year old at home, and a husband who is an artist / gardening / plant <br/>
guy.  Husband spends most of his daytime with the baby, while I work.  I <br/>
am the sole income provider - husband&#39;s art & plant stuff have been put <br/>
on the back burner while our little one is so tiny and needs more care.  <br/>
When he&#39;s able to get back to his businesses, it&#39;ll probably only amount <br/>
for 10% of our income.  So my working is entirely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
To add to the story, my 5 year old is not my husband&#39;s son, he is from a <br/>
previous relationship.  My husband loves him and treats him as his own, <br/>
which is wonderful, but he doesn&#39;t have the same *knowing* of my boy <br/>
that a parent-from-birth does.  My husband isn&#39;t into school or <br/>
bookwork, and sees much more value in day-to-day learning by doing, <br/>
which is awesome.  But I also feel like it&#39;ll be more my job (and <br/>
reasonably so) to be with the 5 year old, encouraging, strewing about <br/>
interesting things, being with him and helping him...  He&#39;d been in <br/>
preschool before K, and needs guidance to find things to do.  I think <br/>
he&#39;s somewhat used to having an adult saying, &quot;Now we&#39;re coloring.  Now <br/>
we&#39;re doing worksheets.&quot; etc. and isn&#39;t as able to entertain himself.<br/>
<br/>
So I will need to be there with him, for him, to keep his days <br/>
interesting and entertaining and full of life.<br/>
<br/>
I also just feel like it&#39;s so not right - not sending a good message - <br/>
that my husband, myself and the littlest one stay home and the oldest <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to do unschooling while also working at home.  I <br/>
already don&#39;t get enough done with my husband and the baby needing me <br/>
throughout the day.  But sometimes I feel like I&#39;d get so much more done <br/>
if they would just LEAVE ME ALONE for a few uninterrupted hours.  I feel <br/>
like if I had a few hours, no interruptions, I could get the day&#39;s work <br/>
done and I would then have the rest of the day to focus on my family, <br/>
exploring, .<br/>
<br/>
I work on the computer, it&#39;s very solo work and not something I can do <br/>
*with* anyone.<br/>
<br/>
So, what I&#39;m asking for is any experience or stories from BTDT <br/>
unschooling moms who are also engaged in a home business.  How do you <br/>
balance being with your kids with your work?  Is it possible?  I see <br/>
this as our biggest obstacle to unschooling, so I would appreciate any <br/>
thoughts you can give.  I&#39;m terrified that I&#39;ll make the leap - with a <br/>
&quot;We&#39;ll make it work&quot; attitude, and I&#39;ll find I&#39;m NOT getting work done, <br/>
NOT making money, and, well, we won&#39;t be able to pay the bills.<br/>
<br/>
Also, because I did work outside the home for a long time, as a single <br/>
parent, (that&#39;s why the oldest started preschool originally) I&#39;m <br/>
honestly totally confused as to what the heck we would do all day.  Most <br/>
of our weekend time is relaxed, spent decompressing from the week.  We <br/>
sometimes go on a little day trip to somewhere interesting.  But I&#39;m at <br/>
a loss as to what my 5 year old would DO all day.  He has games, toys, <br/>
books, TV, 5 acres to run around on.  But even on a weekend - or, heck, <br/>
an evening - he gets bored.  So I really don&#39;t know how I would fill his <br/>
day - or help him fill it with stuff he&#39;s interested in, for that <br/>
matter.  Again, any tips/ideas would be so appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s VERY social, loves to be with other children, but there are no <br/>
homeschooling groups in our area (although I&#39;m sure there are <br/>
homeschoolers... I just don&#39;t know where to find them).  We would have <br/>
to drive about an hour to find one.  Plus, we live in a fairly remote <br/>
area, so access to zoos, &quot;field trip&quot; kind of places, is limited without <br/>
a long drive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-293285104">Wow Michelle Thanks for asking this!!!<br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m so glad you asked this question because I&#39;m in the same situation.  I&#39;m trying to get out of the whole workbook/curriculum thing and not sure how to work in the unschooling and still have time to work my business.  Obviously that is important to me too and allows me to stay home with my 3 kids (6, 4 3/4 and 1yr old).  I have talked to a few people from my company and team that WAH but they do a specific schedule and curriculum.<br/>
   <br/>
  I look forward to many ideas!<br/>

          Hi Folks!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Michelle and I&#39;m a WAHM considering unschooling my 5 year old <br/>
- he started K this year and is having a rough time. I also have a 1 <br/>
year old at home, and a husband who is an artist / gardening / plant <br/>
guy. Husband spends most of his daytime with the baby, while I work. I <br/>
am the sole income provider - husband&#39;s art & plant stuff have been put <br/>
on the back burner while our little one is so tiny and needs more care. <br/>
When he&#39;s able to get back to his businesses, it&#39;ll probably only amount <br/>
for 10% of our income. So my working is entirely necessary.<br/>
<br/>
To add to the story, my 5 year old is not my husband&#39;s son, he is from a <br/>
previous relationship. My husband loves him and treats him as his own, <br/>
which is wonderful, but he doesn&#39;t have the same *knowing* of my boy <br/>
that a parent-from-birth does. My husband isn&#39;t into school or <br/>
bookwork, and sees much more value in day-to-day learning by doing, <br/>
which is awesome. But I also feel like it&#39;ll be more my job (and <br/>
reasonably so) to be with the 5 year old, encouraging, strewing about <br/>
interesting things, being with him and helping him... He&#39;d been in <br/>
preschool before K, and needs guidance to find things to do. I think <br/>
he&#39;s somewhat used to having an adult saying, &quot;Now we&#39;re coloring. Now <br/>
we&#39;re doing worksheets.&quot; etc. and isn&#39;t as able to entertain himself.<br/>
<br/>
So I will need to be there with him, for him, to keep his days <br/>
interesting and entertaining and full of life.<br/>
<br/>
I also just feel like it&#39;s so not right - not sending a good message - <br/>
that my husband, myself and the littlest one stay home and the oldest <br/>
gets trucked off to school. It feels separate, icky.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287462196">Heya!<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t necessarily address your whole post, but bits of it... I am a<br/>
fulltime telecommuting, primary-breadwinning member of my family. My<br/>
husband is a occasionally-working-for-pay, primary-fathering, member<br/>
of the family. And my brother in law lives with us too, pitching in<br/>
here and there. We have a five year old, a two year old, and I&#39;m<br/>
pregnant with #3. We&#39;re not officially anything-schooling, yet.<br/>

Gotcha. Yeah, so is mine. We made the decision for me to be the<br/>
primary, because 1) I telecommute, so I have maximal flexibility, 2) I<br/>
can make more than DH, and 3) my work isn&#39;t as hard on my body as his<br/>
is (he&#39;s a general contractor by training).<br/>
<br/>
&gt; that a parent-from-birth does.  My husband isn&#39;t into school or<br/>
&gt; bookwork, and sees much more value in day-to-day learning by doing,<br/>
&gt; which is awesome.  But I also feel like it&#39;ll be more my job (and<br/>
&gt; reasonably so) to be with the 5 year old, encouraging, strewing about<br/>
&gt; interesting things, being with him and helping him...<br/>
<br/>
It tends to be more my job to find opportunities. Free museum days,<br/>
nature walks, festivals and presentations and park days and that kind<br/>
of thing. But finding formal stuff to do, isn&#39;t nearly as important as<br/>
paying enough attention to see what sparks there are *in them*.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;d been in<br/>
&gt; preschool before K, and needs guidance to find things to do.<br/>
<br/>
That may well be an assumption that needs questioning.<br/>
<br/>
 I think<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s somewhat used to having an adult saying, &quot;Now we&#39;re coloring.  Now<br/>
&gt; we&#39;re doing worksheets.&quot; etc. and isn&#39;t as able to entertain himself.<br/>
<br/>
Have you given him that space?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So I will need to be there with him, for him, to keep his days<br/>
&gt; interesting and entertaining and full of life.<br/>
<br/>
You might really want to step back from that. Kids learn so many<br/>
implicit lessons, just by being, and one of the things you&#39;re showing<br/>
him is that you don&#39;t necessarily trust your husband to be a competent<br/>
nurturer/role model, and that your work isn&#39;t something worthy of<br/>
focus.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also just feel like it&#39;s so not right - not sending a good message -<br/>
&gt; that my husband, myself and the littlest one stay home and the oldest<br/>
&gt; gets trucked off to school.  It feels separate, icky.<br/>
<br/>
I hear that. I have been snarling at people who insist I send Rowan to<br/>
preschool for over two years now.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to do unschooling while also working at home.  I<br/>
&gt; already don&#39;t get enough done with my husband and the baby needing me<br/>
&gt; throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
When my boys were tiny, I had office space away from the main room of<br/>
the house, and I was offlimits for 45 minutes of the hour. I&#39;d come<br/>
check in every 45, nurse, potty, etc. Then back to the grind. If<br/>
you&#39;re the breadwinner, you have to focus.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But sometimes I feel like I&#39;d get so much more done<br/>
&gt; if they would just LEAVE ME ALONE for a few uninterrupted hours.<br/>
<br/>
Grin. I hear that one. At this stage, Rowan and Kestrel both recognize<br/>
that if I have a headset on, it means I&#39;m in a meeting and they need<br/>
to be quiet. I know another telecommuting mama who wears her badge,<br/>
and that&#39;s her children&#39;s signal that Mama is working, and to be<br/>
interrupted only in direst emergency.<br/>
<br/>
All of this presupposes total trust in the child&#39;s caregiver, though.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I feel<br/>
&gt; like if I had a few hours, no interruptions, I could get the day&#39;s work<br/>
&gt; done and I would then have the rest of the day to focus on my family,<br/>
&gt; exploring, .<br/>
<br/>
So why can&#39;t you? Is your baby still nursing?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I work on the computer, it&#39;s very solo work and not something I can do<br/>
&gt; *with* anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I hear that. I&#39;m a technical editor, and that&#39;s work that doesn&#39;t<br/>
share well. On the other hand, I&#39;ve had great success in setting up<br/>
another laptop right next to mine, and putting games, youtube, and<br/>
DVDs on it. Sometimes, what they want is to do what you&#39;re doing. So<br/>
you enable that. Rowan&#39;s learned most of what he knows about typing by<br/>
sitting next to me with a blank word processing document in front of<br/>
him, trying to do what I do.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; So, what I&#39;m asking for is any experience or stories from BTDT<br/>
&gt; unschooling moms who are also engaged in a home business.  How do you<br/>
&gt; balance being with your kids with your work?  Is it possible?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something I wrote on this:<br/>

<br/>
 I see<br/>
&gt; this as our biggest obstacle to unschooling, so I would appreciate any<br/>
&gt; thoughts you can give.  I&#39;m terrified that I&#39;ll make the leap - with a<br/>
&gt; &quot;We&#39;ll make it work&quot; attitude, and I&#39;ll find I&#39;m NOT getting work done,<br/>
&gt; NOT making money, and, well, we won&#39;t be able to pay the bills.<br/>
<br/>
You totally need spousal support and communication, and it helps if<br/>
you guys are wired in parallel with regards to your priorities. Mutual<br/>
respect is absolutely critical. And here&#39;s something I wrote on that:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/lifewithoutschool/2007/02/the_crooked_law.html">http://lifewithoutschool.typepad.com/lifewithoutschool/2007/02/the_crooked_law.html</a><br/>
<br/>
&gt; Also, because I did work outside the home for a long time, as a single<br/>
&gt; parent, (that&#39;s why the oldest started preschool originally) I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; honestly totally confused as to what the heck we would do all day.<br/>
<br/>
Oh my gosh. Calvin (and Hobbes) was right... the days are just packed.<br/>
Follow an interest, see where it takes you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Most<br/>
&gt; of our weekend time is relaxed, spent decompressing from the week.  We<br/>
&gt; sometimes go on a little day trip to somewhere interesting.  But I&#39;m at<br/>
&gt; a loss as to what my 5 year old would DO all day.  He has games, toys,<br/>
&gt; books, TV, 5 acres to run around on.  But even on a weekend - or, heck,<br/>
&gt; an evening - he gets bored.  So I really don&#39;t know how I would fill his<br/>
&gt; day - or help him fill it with stuff he&#39;s interested in, for that<br/>
&gt; matter.  Again, any tips/ideas would be so appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
What exactly is your husband doing with them? Does he understand strewing?<br/>
<br/>
The other thing that might be helpful, at least from where I sit, is<br/>
that our culture is very into the idea that every moment must be spent<br/>
in doing, rather than just in being. Sometimes, Rowan wants to be left<br/>
alone, to sit on his bunk and stare at the ceiling. He&#39;s not<br/>
interested in toys, games, movies, walks, anything. He needs time to<br/>
decompress, to think, to integrate. It&#39;s easy for a schoolish brain to<br/>
panic at that point. But inevitably, he&#39;s processing big stuff, and<br/>
comes out wanting to talk about whatever he&#39;s been pondering. It&#39;s<br/>
critical time for him, that looks very much like &quot;nothing&quot; but is in<br/>
fact everything.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; He&#39;s VERY social, loves to be with other children, but there are no<br/>
&gt; homeschooling groups in our area (although I&#39;m sure there are<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers... I just don&#39;t know where to find them).  We would have<br/>
&gt; to drive about an hour to find one.  Plus, we live in a fairly remote<br/>
&gt; area, so access to zoos, &quot;field trip&quot; kind of places, is limited without<br/>
&gt; a long drive.<br/>
<br/>
There are tons of resources out there to help you find homeschooling groups.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m finding that formal &quot;field trip&quot; stuff is not where it&#39;s at, with<br/>
my kids. There&#39;s a place out behind the local racetrack where a bunch<br/>
of folks have made found-material sculpture. You&#39;d never know it was<br/>
there unless you stumbled into it, which is what my brother in law<br/>
did, while looking for a good place to let the dog run free. He took<br/>
the kids there yesterday, and they spent probably six straight hours<br/>
exploring sculpture, how it was put together, which ones were stable,<br/>
which fell down and why, how people picked what they were going to<br/>
make, what kinds of stuff the boys wanted to make, what materials were<br/>
around, where they might scrounge other materials, why people made<br/>
stuff like that (what motivates art), why there&#39;s driftwood and<br/>
flotsam and jetsam right there on that beach anyway (which apparently<br/>
led to a discussion of Bay currents)... on and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s totally doable. You just need the right infrastructure. =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-961371790">I work out of the home full time - dad/hubby is the stay at home person but we all live life as it is together as a family every day.  Dad and son - Zachariah age 13 - have been home together for almost 5 years.<br/>
<br/>
I must say that there have been times I was envious of dear dad for being the one to stay home but when I come home (as in yesterday) and my son tells me about a hole they dug, poured in a bit of gasoline and lit it to make it burn and how they were digging the hole deeper while it burned, and it kept poofing, but they had a really long handled shovel, etc.  I knew it was right that dear ol&#39; dad was at home and not I ;)  Zac just kept going on and on about how &quot;COOL&quot; it was and then went off on various tangents about what else they could do.  He was sooooooo excited and I know I would not have facilitated such an experiment - I would have said wait for your dad ;)<br/>
<br/>
They have had many great adventures together - they have even gone on trips without me.  They went crystal digging in Arkansas and brought back huge crystals, trips with other homeschoolers, etc.  I come home to dear skulls in my family room, bird nest (full of bugs) on my kitchen counter, &quot;treasures&quot; they found in the creek on our property, science experiment in the bathroom (one lasted a couple of years - he took a bottle of water and filled it with various objects, sealed it and then observed for changes - he kept it in the hall bath)<br/>
<br/>
This is not to say I am not involved - we do most things as a family but I don&#39;t expect them to wait for me.  Often they will return with some found treasure or experience and they joyfully share with me. I still help strew, we go on family outings, vacations, watch movies/shows together, have discussions, etc.  This is a family adventure living life the fullest we can as a family and as individuals at times as he gets older.  I don&#39;t feel that it is my job to do this or that or my husband&#39;s - we do it together - team work.  What one does not think of the other tends to think of so it just all flows and happens.<br/>
<br/>
I know this does not actually help you figure out how to work from home - but if dad is there maybe you could have a few hours of privacy to get the work done so you&#39;d have more time in the long run?  Some people cannot be interrupted and get anything done - others can be.  If you had to have the few hours off by yourself - is there a way you could shut yourself away as if you had left the house to go to work?<br/>

The idea is to find interesting things and leave them where they can  <br/>
be discovered and experimented with, examined, played with, or  <br/>
not.    If you leave shells out the kids might get really excited,  <br/>
might make up a game with them, might want to know where they came  <br/>
from, or might not much care.  Leave other things out, put things in  <br/>
the sunshine that are sparkly or reflective.  Find pretty rocks and  <br/>
put them in a bowl of water to see how different they look.   <br/>
Rearrange the world a little.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t want to come up with this great &quot;idea&quot; of unschooling, convince <br/>
my husband it&#39;s the thing to do, and then leave him to it all while I&#39;m <br/>
working.  Particurally since my 5 y/o isn&#39;t his son.  It&#39;s like, &quot;Here, <br/>
this is cool - you do it, I have other things to do.&quot;  That&#39;s not nice. <br/>
  I want to find a way - schedule-wise - that we&#39;re partners.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, part of the goal, to me, is being with my boy more.  I missed a <br/>
lot of him when he was younger because I had no choice but to go the <br/>
daycare/preschool route.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest thing is that I need to get DH on board giving me <br/>
uninterrupted work time each day.<br/>
<br/>
If I accomplish just a bit, I&#39;d feel much more comfortable leaving for <br/>
the day and being really *with* them.  I often find myself trying to <br/>
enjoy a book, movie, whatever as a family and instead thinking of all <br/>
the stuff left undone that day.  So I&#39;m not really as present as I&#39;d <br/>
like to be.<br/>
<br/>
I think my 5 y/o (and husband) sense that.<br/>
<br/>
I should add my 5 y/o has an in-and-out biological dad who comes and <br/>
goes, like the wind... DS is going through a tough emotional time about <br/>
that right now, he&#39;s recently developed a much keener sense of time and <br/>
realizes when Dad doesn&#39;t call, or that&#39;s it&#39;s been months since he&#39;s <br/>
seen him.  It&#39;s making him a lot more needy of me, the security he gets <br/>
from mom, so what I&#39;m experiencing with him RIGHT NOW - the every 10 <br/>
minutes needing me thing, isn&#39;t the norm that I will have to deal with <br/>
in terms of working forever...<br/>
<br/>
Laureen, I really appreciate your input - sounds like we&#39;re in similar <br/>
situations.  My DH just can&#39;t make as much as I do, and now that we&#39;ve <br/>
moved rural, can&#39;t make much at all (until we get his independent <br/>
business going more).  And that&#39;s fine - I&#39;ve no problem with the <br/>
role-reversal, I like my job, that&#39;s why I picked it.<br/>
<br/>
You have my highest respect for doing all that you do!  I&#39;ll get there <br/>
too, soon enough!<br/>

&gt; The idea is to find interesting things and leave them where they can<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1204158768">Oh yes!  I so agree!  Having met my husband has been one of the best <br/>
things for DS, as I wasn&#39;t really keen on all the cool boy things.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
They go out on weekends hunting for gold (we live in California Gold <br/>
Country) or looking for cool streams and waterfalls.  Dh really like <br/>
rocks, mining history, geology, so they explore like that a lot.  We go <br/>
on trips to historical mines and the like.<br/>
<br/>
Now - digging a hole to put gas in it - that sounds fun!!!  I want to see!<br/>
<br/>
DH also really like keeping out 5 acres from growing right up into the <br/>
house, so he&#39;s walways got burn piles going during burn season, hauling <br/>
branches and cutting down sick trees, and DS loves that stuff.  Even <br/>
stacking wood, he loves it.  He&#39;s a very outdoorsy, active boy, and I <br/>
like to sit and read, LOL.  So I am so grateful to have such an amazing <br/>
man to help my boy grow into a man in a way I never could.<br/>
<br/>
DH often talks about how he can&#39;t wait for our 1 y/o DS to get just a <br/>
bit bigger so he can come on their outing more often, and they can do <br/>
more things together.<br/>
<br/>
I think I just need to sit down with DH and draw up a schedule.  We&#39;ve <br/>
talked about, &quot;I need more uninterrupted work time,&quot; but I think his <br/>
idea of that and mine are vastly different.  Or, sometimes, he&#39;ll go <br/>
overboard and leave me be for 10 hours of the day, and then next day <br/>
really need my support/help parenting.  I don&#39;t need all that.  Just a <br/>
few hours each day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Lisa - this did help remind me a lot of the cool stuff they <br/>
already do together, and how important that is for them.<br/>

&gt; I work out of the home full time - dad/hubby is the stay at home person <br/>
&gt; but we all live life as it is together as a family every day. Dad and <br/>
&gt; son - Zachariah age 13 - have been home together for almost 5 years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I must say that there have been times I was envious of dear dad for <br/>
&gt; being the one to stay home but when I come home (as in yesterday) and my <br/>
&gt; son tells me about a hole they dug, poured in a bit of gasoline and lit <br/>
&gt; it to make it burn and how they were digging the hole deeper while it <br/>
&gt; burned, and it kept poofing, but they had a really long handled shovel, <br/>
&gt; etc. I knew it was right that dear ol&#39; dad was at home and not I ;) Zac <br/>
&gt; just kept going on and on about how &quot;COOL&quot; it was and then went off on <br/>
&gt; various tangents about what else they could do. He was sooooooo excited <br/>
&gt; and I know I would not have facilitated such an experiment - I would <br/>
&gt; have said wait for your dad ;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They have had many great adventures together - they have even gone on <br/>
&gt; trips without me. They went crystal digging in Arkansas and brought back <br/>
&gt; huge crystals, trips with other homeschoolers, etc. I come home to dear <br/>
&gt; skulls in my family room, bird nest (full of bugs) on my kitchen <br/>
&gt; counter, &quot;treasures&quot; they found in the creek on our property, science <br/>
&gt; experiment in the bathroom (one lasted a couple of years - he took a <br/>
&gt; bottle of water and filled it with various objects, sealed it and then <br/>
&gt; observed for changes - he kept it in the hall bath)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is not to say I am not involved - we do most things as a family but <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t expect them to wait for me. Often they will return with some <br/>
&gt; found treasure or experience and they joyfully share with me. I still <br/>
&gt; help strew, we go on family outings, vacations, watch movies/shows <br/>
&gt; together, have discussions, etc. This is a family adventure living life <br/>
&gt; the fullest we can as a family and as individuals at times as he gets <br/>
&gt; older. I don&#39;t feel that it is my job to do this or that or my husband&#39;s <br/>
&gt; - we do it together - team work. What one does not think of the other <br/>
&gt; tends to think of so it just all flows and happens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know this does not actually help you figure out how to work from home <br/>
&gt; - but if dad is there maybe you could have a few hours of privacy to get <br/>
&gt; the work done so you&#39;d have more time in the long run? Some people <br/>
&gt; cannot be interrupted and get anything done - others can be. If you had <br/>
&gt; to have the few hours off by yourself - is there a way you could shut <br/>
&gt; yourself away as if you had left the house to go to work?<br/>

Get him a back-carry sling, pronto. We have Ergos, but due to some<br/>
uncool business practices, we&#39;re recommending other variations on that<br/>
theme these days. Anyway... Jason was taking Rowan and Kestrel out to<br/>
jobsites, on hikes, just generally doing whatever he normally does,<br/>
from the time they had head control. When a little one is in a sling<br/>
like that, their head is right by whoever&#39;s wearing them, and they<br/>
have a birds&#39; eye view of the goings on, with the safety of being all<br/>
bundled up next to an adult body.<br/>
<br/>
I think that especially for male caregivers, who are more used to an<br/>
active model of &quot;doing stuff&quot;, it&#39;s critical. It nicely sets the stage<br/>
for &quot;just involve them in what is naturally going on around them, and<br/>
let them see what passion and enthusiasm look like in their native<br/>
environment&quot;.<br/>

&gt; Sandra&#39;s site about it (again).  But I want to be available for him when<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s bored and asks for a little inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; is a really fashionable thing to say in the<br/>
conventionally-schooled set. After one play session with their<br/>
preschooled/daycared cousin, both my boys were doing the full on &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
booooooooooooored!&quot;, complete with flounce to indicate the depth of<br/>
the feeling. Totally ruined the effect when they then charged off to<br/>
have a pillow fight. =)  Rowan and I discussed what &quot;bored&quot; actually<br/>
means, and he was surprised. He was using the term because he liked<br/>
the feeling, the word sound, but didn&#39;t understand the implications.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I feel like if I have an open-door policy while I&#39;m working, then I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; never going to get any work done because I&#39;ll be interrupted every 10<br/>

&gt; very unschooling, from my understanding.<br/>
<br/>
With age and practice, there gets to be a rhythm. But if your spouse<br/>
respects your space, the kids will pick up on it, and model it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Yes, baby is still nursing on demand.  Husband is bored to death,<br/>
<br/>
So the husband is the problem.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; watches TV all day while baby crawls about and explores,<br/>
<br/>
So the husband isn&#39;t actually interacting with the kids?<br/>
<br/>
comes upstairs<br/>
&gt; and wants to talk to me to get some adult interaction.<br/>
<br/>
Oh. Yeah, I see where you&#39;re having issues. He needs to do what SAHMs<br/>
have done since time immemorial; reach out, go to parks and<br/>
playgroups, and not lay *everything* on your shoulders. It&#39;s a gift<br/>
that you&#39;re able to be there at all, and when everyone sees that, it<br/>
changes the tone and flavor of the whole thing to be a more mutually<br/>
assistive kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
Or baby gets a<br/>
&gt; bit cranky and husband brings him up to nurse even though he&#39;s not<br/>
&gt; really hungry, DH just wants a few minutes to himself to regroup or<br/>
&gt; whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Does he understand that he&#39;s putting you in the position of having to<br/>
do everything? That&#39;s not real respectful.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t want to come up with this great &quot;idea&quot; of unschooling, convince<br/>
&gt; my husband it&#39;s the thing to do, and then leave him to it all while I&#39;m<br/>

&gt; this is cool - you do it, I have other things to do.&quot;  That&#39;s not nice.<br/>
&gt;   I want to find a way - schedule-wise - that we&#39;re partners.<br/>
<br/>
I am really really confused here. I could be totally wrong, since the<br/>
whole unschooling mindset is pretty new for me, but it seems to me<br/>
that either you&#39;re a family all pulling together, or you are not, and<br/>
if you aren&#39;t, there are a number of things that won&#39;t work optimally.<br/>
<br/>
Someone&#39;s got to make money. Implicit in the decision for that someone<br/>
to be you is the decision that someone needs to be primary caregiver<br/>
to the children, and that someone is him. If he isn&#39;t stepping up to<br/>
the plate, that&#39;s a huge problem.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Besides, part of the goal, to me, is being with my boy more.  I missed a<br/>
&gt; lot of him when he was younger because I had no choice but to go the<br/>
&gt; daycare/preschool route.<br/>
<br/>
Gotcha.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think the biggest thing is that I need to get DH on board giving me<br/>
&gt; uninterrupted work time each day.<br/>
<br/>
The 45 minute thing worked well for us when Kestrel was nursing (his<br/>
natural interval was longer than that, so I was offering before<br/>
hunger), and then it gradually increased over time.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; If I accomplish just a bit, I&#39;d feel much more comfortable leaving for<br/>
&gt; the day and being really *with* them.  I often find myself trying to<br/>
&gt; enjoy a book, movie, whatever as a family and instead thinking of all<br/>
&gt; the stuff left undone that day.  So I&#39;m not really as present as I&#39;d<br/>
&gt; like to be.<br/>
<br/>
::nodding:: Of course. I find it to be an excellent exercise in<br/>
mindfulness. Be here now... whether here is with my work when I&#39;m<br/>
working, or with my kids when I&#39;m not.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think my 5 y/o (and husband) sense that.<br/>
<br/>
how could they not? most likely the baby does too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I should add my 5 y/o has an in-and-out biological dad who comes and<br/>
&gt; goes, like the wind... DS is going through a tough emotional time about<br/>
&gt; that right now, he&#39;s recently developed a much keener sense of time and<br/>
&gt; realizes when Dad doesn&#39;t call, or that&#39;s it&#39;s been months since he&#39;s<br/>
&gt; seen him.  It&#39;s making him a lot more needy of me, the security he gets<br/>

&gt; in terms of working forever...<br/>
<br/>
Try for mental isolation rather than physical, then. Try setting up a<br/>
&quot;workstation&quot; right next to you, or in your office space, where<br/>
there&#39;s a laptop, or pens, pencils, crayons, paper, a stapler, paper<br/>
clips, other cool office supply things. Let him know that you need to<br/>
focus on work but you&#39;d love having him with you. I got interrupted a<br/>
ton in the beginning, but now, the boys totally get the difference<br/>
between &quot;head down&quot; and &quot;available for stuff&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; You have my highest respect for doing all that you do!  I&#39;ll get there<br/>
&gt; too, soon enough!<br/>
<br/>
It can be a little hard to start. Also, don&#39;t overlook the fact that<br/>
society at large makes it tough for men to be primaries. My DH is very<br/>
comfortable in his role, and was pretty much born to be a father, but<br/>
the unconscious and pretty unbelievable comments people have made to<br/>
him sometimes knock him pretty hard. I like to think that some day,<br/>
equality and respect will be givens. But right now, like it or not,<br/>
men as primaries are really unusual, and are going to take some knocks<br/>
for it.<br/>

as a Graco (or whatever brand) carrier.  DH uses these for shorter trips <br/>
out and about, but the baby gets HEAVY after a while - he&#39;s already 27 <br/>
lbs, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s just looking forward to having the option of setting him <br/>
down - but he does take them on shorter outings most weekends.<br/>
<br/>
And I totally agree - &quot;doing stuff&quot; - like real, concrete things - &quot;We <br/>
built a fort&quot; or &quot;We raked leaves&quot; or &quot;We dug up quartz crystals&quot; is <br/>
where my husband shines most, and where his enthusiasm spreads easily to <br/>
Rory.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear from others as well how dads involve themselves - <br/>
of course, the &quot;everyday&quot; stuff.  But what kind of fun do your kids have <br/>

that&#39;s totally a part of unschooling life - living life, learning from <br/>
it...  I think he&#39;s unclear on clear on how that &quot;works&quot; so taking <br/>
examples from our own life, as well as others, will be helpful for him - <br/>
or, should I say, for me clarifying to him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-659859617"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  &gt; Yes, baby is still nursing on demand. Husband is bored to death,<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; So the husband is the problem.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt;  &gt; watches TV all day while baby crawls about and explores,<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; So the husband isn&#39;t actually interacting with the kids?<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; comes upstairs<br/>
 &gt;  &gt; and wants to talk to me to get some adult interaction.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Oh. Yeah, I see where you&#39;re having issues. He needs to do what SAHMs<br/>
 &gt; have done since time immemorial; reach out, go to parks and<br/>
 &gt; playgroups, and not lay *everything* on your shoulders. It&#39;s a gift<br/>
 &gt; that you&#39;re able to be there at all, and when everyone sees that, it<br/>
 &gt; changes the tone and flavor of the whole thing to be a more mutually<br/>
 &gt; assistive kind of thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  He&#39;s the problem in that, while Rory is at school, he interrupts <br/>
me, is needy, etc.  The baby really only needs me, on most days, once <br/>
before school is out for a snack.<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s having a tough time adjusting to being a SAH dad, to losing <br/>
a certain amount of freedom, to not having as much time as he&#39;d like for <br/>
his interests.  I think he&#39;s also suffering from a case of &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; - I <br/>
can&#39;t do x because the baby.<br/>
<br/>
We need a better rhythm to our days to free us *both* up to have <br/>
individual time to work on our stuff, as well as be with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
He does interact with Colum (the 1 year old) and I&#39;m sorry I didn&#39;t make <br/>
it sound so.  They talk and play and eat and laugh and all those <br/>
wonderful things babies need.  They do do it in front of the TV about <br/>
85% of the time.  Colum is getting what he needs - adult attention and <br/>
play -  but I think DH is not, and I think he doesn&#39;t see other options.<br/>
<br/>
To be honest, I don&#39;t see many others either.  We are somewhat new to <br/>
where we live so don&#39;t have friends around, it&#39;s a very small community <br/>
and the one &quot;moms&quot; group that used to meet up is now defunct.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think he&#39;d be comfortable going to a moms group anyway.<br/>
<br/>
DH goes out to the store with Colum and runs errands a couple mornings a <br/>
week, does general housework.  When Rory gets home from school the TV <br/>
usually goes off for a bit and DH goes outside with Rory and they do <br/>
some property maintenance things; they both enjoy that.  After that I do <br/>
homework with Rory, DH has baby, and then we settle in for dinner time, <br/>
evening plans, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s my dilemma, I guess.  I feel like, for unscholing to work, DH <br/>
needs to do something other then watch TV in the morning hours while I <br/>
work, so that Rory has a better...  example?  model?  more stimulating <br/>
environment?<br/>
<br/>
I think he looks at things - we&#39;ll, he&#39;s said this, - that it&#39;s nice for <br/>
me because I get to work and have &quot;me&quot; or &quot;alone&quot; time, and he doesn&#39;t. <br/>
  But I can&#39;t help that.  Someone has to work, it&#39;s clearly going to be <br/>
me, and that leaves, as you said, the other parent as a caregiver during <br/>
that time.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; I am really really confused here. I could be totally wrong, since the<br/>
 &gt; whole unschooling mindset is pretty new for me, but it seems to me<br/>
 &gt; that either you&#39;re a family all pulling together, or you are not, and<br/>
 &gt; if you aren&#39;t, there are a number of things that won&#39;t work optimally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes...  I feel like we&#39;re not working together as well as we could - <br/>
although I know we&#39;re trying!  And it&#39;s all on the &quot;he&#39;s with the baby <br/>
all morning and I&#39;m off working&quot; thing.  I feel guilty, he feels lonely, <br/>
there&#39;s an amount of resentment on both sides, rinse, repeat.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it would be helpful for DH to have an afternoon each week, or <br/>
whatever amount of time, where he had all the time to himself to do <br/>
whatever he wanted all on his own.  I know there are SAHM&#39;s who do that <br/>
and come back a bit more refreshed.<br/>
<br/>
You know what I want?<br/>
<br/>
JOY<br/>
<br/>
I want DH to be joyous, to see possibility each day.  From his time with <br/>
the boys, that will spread to them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s me putting expectations on DH that aren&#39;t appropriate - <br/>
maybe the way he is with them is exactly what they all need at that <br/>
time.  He is a good man, he listens to them, he does do things with them <br/>
and shares his own interests and passions with them.  It&#39;s just the darn <br/>
TV seems to take precedence on most days.<br/>
<br/>
When I think of us unschooling, I don&#39;t see the way our days are now as <br/>
being at all enriching and fun and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe that&#39;s my perception, maybe that&#39;s MY being school-y (or, uh, <br/>
controlling).  I.E. &quot;I would do a craft and read books and bake bread&quot; <br/>
or whatever if I was with them in the morning, and DH doesn&#39;t, so I&#39;m <br/>
thinking DH&#39;s way is &quot;wrong.&quot;  In reality, Rory may have no interest on <br/>
doing those things with me on any particular day...  And in reality, I&#39;d <br/>
probably never get as much done as I think or fantasize that I could, LOL.<br/>
<br/>
They watch movies and talk about them.  They play video games sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should relax a bit on the whole, &quot;What&#39;s DH going to *do* with <br/>
Rory all day if we unschooled?&quot; and focus on getting a decent workflow <br/>
scheduled with DH so he and I are working together well in that <br/>
department... and perhaps once that&#39;s where it should be, the rest will <br/>
fall into place.<br/>
<br/>
I worry that Rory won&#39;t be &quot;doing&quot; enough during his time with DH if we <br/>
were unschooling.  But in writing this, I see that they do... It just <br/>
isn&#39;t necessarily the stuff *I* would pick.<br/>
<br/>
Am I headed in a reasonable direction here, or am I getting off course?<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t overlook the fact that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; society at large makes it tough for men to be primaries. My DH is very<br/>
 &gt; comfortable in his role, and was pretty much born to be a father, but<br/>
 &gt; the unconscious and pretty unbelievable comments people have made to<br/>
 &gt; him sometimes knock him pretty hard.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes... everytime they go out there are rude comments - &quot;Where&#39;s mom?  Is <br/>
it&#39;s mom&#39;s day off?  I think the baby is hungry.&quot; As if he&#39;s not capable <br/>
of telling when his own child is hungry/needs changing/needs love etc. <br/>
it&#39;s very disheartening, and I know it gets to him, especially when he <br/>
hears similar things from his own family.<br/>
<br/>
SAHM&#39;s - how does your husband, if he&#39;s working, make you feel <br/>
appreciated for all you do in the home and with the kids?  I know DH <br/>
could use more appreciation from me, but I&#39;m not sure how to give it.<br/>
<br/>
Much food for thought here.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your insights!<br/>

<br/>
You keep telling us about homework, but that won&#39;t exist if you&#39;re  <br/>

If you&#39;re thinking you won&#39;t be happy until the boys are happy and  <br/>

and allow me to get those hours in (although I probably don&#39;t even need <br/>
40) without interruption.  That&#39;s the biggest obstacle, as I see it.<br/>

year old?  If so, I&#39;m not worried about him, he&#39;s a happy little man.  I <br/>
think all my worry about DH being with Rory, the one who is currently in <br/>
K, while I work, is that DH doesn&#39;t, at times, seem to *do* much.  He <br/>
watches a lot of TV these days. I don&#39;t want Rory to be bored to death <br/>
at home because mom is working for, say, 5 hours a day and DH is <br/>
watching TV during that time.  That was my initial fear.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe it&#39;s unfounded???  Maybe the &quot;I&#39;m bored&quot; will disappear with <br/>
unschooling.  Maybe DH will get out of his funk and do more stuff. <br/>
Maybe Rory will just really need to veg out too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, I have the utmost respect for you and your list and your <br/>
experience and wisdom, and I mean that 100% - but perhaps you misread <br/>
this one.  I mentioned it once in paragraph about how we spend our day, <br/>
how DH and I get things done together with the boys.  It went, &quot;...After <br/>
that I do homework with Rory, DH has baby, and then we settle in for <br/>
dinner time, evening plans, etc.&quot;  I wasn&#39;t discussing homework at all, <br/>
I was discussing who does what with the kids, how our days flow, and <br/>
finding a *NEW* rhythm to our day that works for *everyone*.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; So why can&#39;t he have &quot;me&quot; and &quot;alone time&quot; while you&#39;re not working?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He mostly chooses not to.  Maybe he feels like he can&#39;t, which is why I <br/>
thought maybe having it be a bit more formal would help him feel ok <br/>
leaving us.  Maybe I should just start saying, &quot;If you want some free <br/>
time to work on your art this afternoon, I&#39;ve got you covered.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; If you&#39;re thinking you won&#39;t be happy until the boys are happy and<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!  So true!  They do, in most ways, take their cues from me.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much!  I&#39;m getting clearer....  (I think, LOL).<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
Here is a short list of the things my DH does with our girls<br/>
when he gets chance, (he works from home sometimes, works on-site <br/>
sometimes and so our routine is never quite the same):<br/>
<br/>
Plays video games,<br/>
Takes them to the park for rc helicopter flying,<br/>
Walks the dog, and talks with them,<br/>
Builds computers and downloads software,<br/>
Surprises them with K&#39;nex motorised kits, then helps them<br/>
build them,<br/>
Cleans the swimming pool and the back yard,<br/>
Most important of all is that when they ask him questions he<br/>
just has this amazing wealth of knowledge and takes a long<br/>
time giving them really thorough answers.<br/>
<br/>
None of the above takes a long time out of his day, but it means a<br/>
lot to them and encourages enriching experiences and questions that<br/>
lead to learning naturally.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So that&#39;s my dilemma, I guess. I feel like, for unscholing to work, <br/>
DH <br/>
needs to do something other then watch TV in the morning hours while <br/>
I <br/>
work, so that Rory has a better... example? model? more stimulating <br/>
environment?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest not to worry about how much TV is watched, TV<br/>
itself can be really stimulating and lead to lots of conversations<br/>
and other activities.  With Rory being only 5, that seems very young<br/>
to be worrying so much about what he fills his time with, as long as<br/>
he is happy. Have you read Sandra&#39;s pages regarding &quot;strewing&quot;.  I<br/>
strongly suggest you do that; you see you could &quot;strew&quot; lots of <br/>
interesting things around the room where your DH is watching<br/>
TV and if Rory takes interest in them, surely your DH will then<br/>
notice that spark of interest and build conversation around that, <br/>
answering his questions and you may be surprised just where this <br/>
could lead them.<br/>
After all, the important thing to note here is that unschooling is<br/>
all about what Rory chooses to do with his time and, like you said, <br/>
he may not want to bake bread, do crafts or read at this stage - <br/>
then again, he might and are you sure your DH wouldn&#39;t want to do <br/>
these things with him? Have you asked him?  <br/>
<br/>
How does Rory spend his time during school holidays and weekends?  <br/>
That is good clue to what interests him.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could change your working hours so that you got up early <br/>
and worked for a few hours, then had a large portion of time during <br/>
the middle of the day where you could take Rory out places, and then <br/>
finish your work in the evening when it usually seems quite <br/>
the &quot;norm&quot; for Dads and kids to be watching TV.  That all depends of <br/>
course on how much work you have to do.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, hope something helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-656975213">Michelle,<br/>
<br/>
I just thought of one other thing which may help as the main<br/>
issue here seems to be time to spend with Rory.<br/>
<br/>
When my girls were at school it would take on average 45 minutes to <br/>
find school uniform, get dressed, prepare packed lunch, get things <br/>
together in backpack, brush hair, remember to take all the things <br/>
you mustn&#39;t forget and get into the car.  Then it would take another <br/>
30 minutes to drive to school, through school traffic and join car <br/>
line.<br/>
Another 30 minutes to drop off children, get out of school zone and <br/>
drive home.  That&#39;s another hour at the end of the school day to <br/>
drive there, collect them and bring them home, plus at least an hour <br/>
and a half for discussing the days activities, reading all the blurb <br/>
sent home by the teacher and getting homework done.  We lost a <br/>
couple of hours at the end of each day because they had to go to bed <br/>
early, to be able to get up so early the next morning to do it all <br/>
again, and none of that includes washing and ironing the school <br/>
uniforms at the weekiend so they were ready on a Monday.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously, everyone&#39;s routine is different, and maybe Rory catches <br/>
the school bus, but I&#39;ll bet if you sat and calculated how much time <br/>
you were already giving between you and DH in just getting Rory to <br/>
school and back each day with everything he needs to have with him; <br/>
it would be lovely to think you would be gaining that amount of time <br/>
each day just to spend with him, if he no longer went to school.<br/>
<br/>
My calculations come to approx. 4 hours and 15 minutes!!<br/>
<br/>
Try it, just a thought.<br/>
