If one is lucky, a solitary fantasy can  totally transform one<br/>
million realities.<br/>
~Maya Angelou~<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;<br/>
<br/>
John Holt&#39;s fantasy transformed schools, still inspires radical<br/>
teachers and reformers, and helps thousands and thousands of<br/>
unschoolers find inspiration and confidence.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--=-=-<br/>
<br/>
And some of those millions *he* were inspired were inspired enough to <br/>
transform their own unschooling millions: Sandra and Joyce inspire <br/>
others everyday with their websites. The Live and Learn and other <br/>
conferences touch whole families for days at a time.  We have Life <br/>
Learning, Life Free, Learn Free, and Connections e-zine.There are those <br/>
that own and moderate and participate on the message boards and elists! <br/>
And even something as simple  (although not to *ME* &lt;g&gt;)---all the <br/>
incredible bloggers who share their lives and thoughts with us.<br/>
<br/>
SOOO many realities have been changed and are changing every day due to <br/>
John Holt&#39;s fantasy. But it certainly could have died wih him---if not <br/>
for those of us who choose to continue his work.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m grateful for John Holt&#39;s solitary fantasy, but I&#39;m more grateful <br/>
still for those who continue to transform realities!<br/>
