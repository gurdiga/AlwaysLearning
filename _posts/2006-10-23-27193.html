<div id="ygrps-yiv-585339379">I am new to this board, and i am very interested about home shcooling. <br/>
Is there any good books to use. I know very little about this subject. <br/>
My 2 1/2 yr old twins are due to start nursery next april. I do not <br/>
agree with punishments and work hard to try and acheive discipline <br/>
through other positive methods. I am not sure what descision i will <br/>
make but i know that if the local nursery/school does not treat my <br/>
children in a way i would like then i would prefer to home teach. can <br/>
any one give me info on this subject ie how to go about it, where to <br/>
get all the info etc thanks<br/>

to delete it from the queue, but I forgot and went away for the  <br/>
weekend and another moderator let it through.<br/>

This isn&#39;t really a good topic for this list, and I&#39;ve already sent  <br/>
the mom lots of links to information that&#39;s more appropriate.<br/>
