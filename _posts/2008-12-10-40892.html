<div id="ygrps-yiv-286428047">i am cross posting this two unschooling lists.<br/>
<br/>
i have a question that i just feel quite stuck with, and am hoping to get some perspective and experience.<br/>
<br/>
i have two children - my son is 10 and my daughter is 13.<br/>
<br/>
my son  has been out of school for nearly a year and my daughter just decided about 6 weeks ago to leave school.  she is thinking it is just for the semester or maybe the year, but i could imagine her choosing to stay home beyond that, especially if we can solve this dilemma...<br/>
<br/>
here it is:  <br/>
<br/>
my kids have *very* different temperaments, and always have.  they share some traits of course - sensitivity, passion, creativity...<br/>
<br/>
but in terms of how they interact with the world and other people, they are sooooo different.  my son is quite introverted, prefering the company of his close family and an occasional friend, lots of time alone, and a focused hobbies for activities, which very from week to week or month to month, but are focused on pretty intensely for however long they hold his interest.  right now he is into jewelry making (beading) and baking. he gets quite stressed by too much activity, doesn&#39;t care for much travel, crowds, groups (even of familiar people), etc.  and has very little tolerance for activities that he isn&#39;t personally interested in.<br/>
<br/>
my daughter on the other hand is *very* extraverted, and if she could design her life exactly as she wanted it, it&#39;d be full of spontaneous mother-daughter adventures, activities, and explorations, including time with me and my women friends (who she loves to hang out with), time together with just me, and time with our whole family, or just the three of us, while my husband is working, but only if my son would be a willing and fun participant.<br/>
<br/>
expecting him to go along on stuff he isn&#39;t up for is a lose-lose situation, as it becomes miserable for everyone.  bringing stuff along is no longer helpful - there is nothing portable that is interesting enough to him to help him get through an unpalatable situation.<br/>
<br/>
he can stay home alone for a few hours at a time, once or twice a week, but that is not enough time to really get the kind of experiences my daughter is craving....and i can&#39;t fully relax or go far from home, so there are limitations there.  i could of course drive her places and pick her up, and i facilitate any social activites she wants to be part of, but what she is really craving is that &quot;unschooling family adventure experience&quot;!  <br/>
<br/>
my husband works long hours, so time together is hard to come by, and time for him to stay with our son is limited too,although he does it frequently for parties, short trips, and events.  there just doesn&#39;t seem to be enough hours in the day to meet everyone&#39;s needs for attention, activites, sleep, and connection.<br/>
<br/>
as i was writing this, i was talking with a friend online and the only idea we came up with is to take my daughter out at night, after my son is asleep (around 10:30 or so) maybe once a week or so - to hear music, watch belly dancing, or something fun and &quot;night lifey&quot;.  that sounds great, and i think it will help (if i can stay awake!) but it still leaves all day every day with a fairly understimulated child who wants to get OUT and another to whom going out to do ANYTHING almost never sounds good, and mostly sounds torturous.<br/>
<br/>
anyone else been there, done that?  any ideas for how to &quot;do&quot; unschooling with two such very different kids without one kid feeling like an unwilling third wheel or the other feeling tormented with restlessness and understimulation?<br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677210538">I feel so unqualified to add much of value to your question.  I have a 5<br/>
year old only son.<br/>
<br/>
However, this stuck out to me and I found myself scratching my head over it:<br/>
&quot;unschooling family adventure experience&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That as an expectation sounds quite torturous to *me* and I&#39;m an adult not a<br/>
teen or a child.<br/>
<br/>
Having some conversations about expectations in general might clear the way<br/>
to some understanding what it looks and feels like to others to have<br/>
expectations laid on them.  What if the situation were in reverse... if the<br/>
daughter were expected to behave contrary to her nature?  To stay at home<br/>
continually and *not* be very social?<br/>
<br/>
There may be something that can ease the situation or there may not be much<br/>
beyond acceptance of differences in people.<br/>

<br/>
You haven&#39;t mentioned finances here.  Since you are uncomfortable leaving your son alone, have you considered finding a sitter?  I know you&#39;d like to be with both kids all the time, but having an older &quot;grandma&quot; type lady hanging out with her knitting or whatever while your son happily engages in his own thing at home might not be so bad, if it gives you some extra going-out time with your daughter that she craves.   And if she happens to have an interest in baking or jewelry making herself, maybe he finds an interested mentor as well.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are young yet, and the couple of non-family member sitters we&#39;ve found that the kids really enjoy spending time with are older women with grown kids of their own.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2008680750">-=-i am cross posting this two unschooling lists.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know people join the list all the time and can&#39;t have read  <br/>
everything, but every time someone cross posts, I ask them not to.   <br/>
Pick a place.  Or post separately and don&#39;t tell us about the other one.<br/>
<br/>
If this list isn&#39;t really the place you want to discuss something,  <br/>
don&#39;t bring it to the list.  It&#39;s like bulk mail then, and people  <br/>
feel less responsibility to help.  Bring special things to this list  <br/>
if you want to, anytime.<br/>

<br/>
Your husband doesn&#39;t work seven days a week, does he?   When he&#39;s  <br/>
home, take off.  Or does your son have a friend he could stay with or  <br/>
have over who also likes being fairly still?   Or do you have a  <br/>
friend who would stay over with him for you to take your daughter on  <br/>
overnight trips to visit female friends in other towns?<br/>
<br/>
Holly loves to be with my friends, too, just to hear us talk or be in  <br/>
on those conversations.  Last week we visited a college friend of  <br/>
mine I hadn&#39;t seen for years, but I had talked about, and Holly  <br/>
reminded me several times she wanted to meet her, so we went and it  <br/>
was great.  Last year we drove 100 miles to see a cousin who grew up  <br/>
with me, and we tried to go again in November, but logistics didn&#39;t  <br/>
work out.   There would have been no benefit at all in trying to  <br/>
include Marty in those things.  It was about Holly&#39;s desire to know  <br/>
more about me as a person outside of just being her mom.<br/>
<br/>

unschooling with two such very different kids without one kid feeling  <br/>
like an unwilling third wheel or the other feeling tormented with  <br/>
restlessness and understimulation?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have one introvert and two extrovert kids.  We&#39;ve found things to  <br/>
do with one or two of them that didn&#39;t involve the others, and found  <br/>
places or people for the others.  Twice we&#39;ve left Kirby and Holly  <br/>
and taken Marty (the introvert) with us to do something.  It might  <br/>
seem backwards, but once we dropped Kirby and Holly off at a May Day  <br/>
festival at which several friends and relatives were, partway between  <br/>
Albuquerque and Denver, and took Marty with us to see a King Tut  <br/>
exhibit at the museum up there, and to visit friends overnight.  We  <br/>
picked the other two up on the way home, and everyone had had a great  <br/>
time.  Another time, when Keith was living in Minneapolis, I got  <br/>
friends to stay at my house and Marty and I went to MN for Marty&#39;s  <br/>
birthday.   He and Keith went snowboarding and ice skating and to  <br/>
movies they would like, and I stayed at the apartment and talked to  <br/>
friends on the phone and slept and watched movies.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with mixing it up that way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1277021863">&quot; it&#39;s the day to day every day, every week thing i am struggling with.<br/>
if she only has &#39;special&quot; things to look forward to, what would ever<br/>
keep her from wanting to go back to school? she is bored and disatisfied<br/>
at home during the week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What about something like The Boys and Girls Club?  You live pretty<br/>
urban, so there are probably several things of that nature around you. <br/>
Does she have interest in classes of any sort?<br/>
<br/>
Chamille went through what you&#39;ve described, and still occasionally<br/>
does.  Taking off, when my husband came home helped a lot.  We could<br/>
leave little sister at home and go do stuff for a few hours.  Sometimes<br/>
we just walked around downtown PDX and looked a window displays,<br/>
sometimes we&#39;d go out for coffee or a movie or the mall.<br/>
<br/>
Doing FrightTown was a huge big deal thing that helped A LOT!  It was 2<br/>
long days a week doing something hugely focused that lasted about 2<br/>
months.  We did it just long enough to be ready to stop doing it by the<br/>
last day.  Now a month out, we miss it.  I try to take Chamille to the<br/>
grocery store with me while leaving Margaux behind with dad.  It&#39;s not<br/>
totally exciting, yet it&#39;s time away from home getting stuff done, and<br/>
time to talk and listen to music together and check stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
I try to be available for any and all chances of outings with friends,<br/>
and Chamille knows that, yet she&#39;s been reluctant to set stuff up<br/>
herself, until VERY recently.<br/>
<br/>
I have very similar issues in regards to meeting the needs of both my<br/>
kids.  Margaux doesn&#39;t like to be pressured to go out and do things,<br/>
expecially if it&#39;s so her sister can get out.  If I set up stuff for<br/>
Margaux without her sister, she&#39;s very into it.  So, unlike you, I have<br/>
to kids that like to get out and about, but mostly not together, and the<br/>
younger one can&#39;t stay home alone yet, and my older one doesn&#39;t really<br/>
like to stay home alone all the time, sometimes, but not always. <br/>
Finding things they both like, is hard because of the huge age<br/>
difference, and it&#39;s only getting more and more that way!<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has a newish friend that has a car, so she may go do something<br/>
today while Margaux and I are out doing Margaux stuff.  It&#39;s interesting<br/>
that Chamille has a friend with a car.  I have mixed feelings about it,<br/>
but it&#39;s a first and it could turn out great for everyone.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-196037200">This was just a movie and maybe not very real life.  It&#39;s not an obscure<br/>
movie and maybe someone else remembers the title.  I forget the name of it.<br/>
The plot is a young boy goes to a park where old guys play chess and joins<br/>
them, and it becomes something the kid does a lot.  I think he&#39;s supposed to<br/>
be about 10 or 11.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine has a loner-ish type child who likes having friends to hang<br/>
out with but not often.  He will occasionally (once or so a week) hang out<br/>
with others (then it was in the afternoon to do some skateboarding and catch<br/>
up with them).  Sometimes he goes to their parties, sometimes he&#39;d rather be<br/>
home.  He uses the cell phone a lot.  He&#39;s not crazy about being around<br/>
people much.  At that time in his life, he was a lot older than your son<br/>
though (16).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was the times and maybe it was the circumstances.  When I was ten,<br/>
my mom would often take the kids with her to grocery or thrift shop and<br/>
leave other kids at home who would rather watch TV or read.  One of my aunts<br/>
who lived next door (there were one on each side of us) was invariably home<br/>
and never checked on us.  Yet we knew we could go over to their house if we<br/>
needed to while our parents were out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I tried to respond to your first post about this, Lyla, but my  <br/>
response seemed overly harsh. Now that you&#39;ve gotten lots of other  <br/>
ideas and posted again, dismissing them, I&#39;m going to say it anyway.  <br/>
You sound like people I know who aren&#39;t really looking for solutions,  <br/>
but who are really wanting to complain about how impossible their   <br/>
particular situation is. I&#39;m not entirely sure why they want to do  <br/>
that - but I&#39;m suggesting that you examine that possibility in yourself.<br/>
<br/>
The best solution I can offer (and I have one extreme extrovert and  <br/>
one extreme introvert and another in-between) is to change your way of  <br/>
thinking about it. Decide to think of this as an amazingly wonderful  <br/>
incredibly positive aspect of your family and treat it that way. How  <br/>
WONDERFUL that you have a child of each temperament. How wonderful  <br/>
that you are able and willing to find ways to nurture both of them in  <br/>
their own ways. How wonderful that they (and you) learn to enjoy and  <br/>
appreciate the diversity of human temperament. How wonderful that your  <br/>
daughter and son provide YOU with such a variety of life experiences.<br/>
<br/>
In practice, multiple people living together ALWAYS have to &quot;work  <br/>
things out&quot; between them. That is a process that goes on and on -  <br/>
always changing in its dynamics, but never stopping. We all have that.  <br/>
There is no &quot;answer to the problem,&quot; there is only the day-to-day  <br/>
thinking of each others&#39; needs as we go about living our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Reading your post, the one thing I kept thinking was that you&#39;re  <br/>
looking too hard at the conflicts, too hard at how hard this is. You  <br/>
can&#39;t &quot;see&quot; the solutions when your eyes are focused on the problem.  <br/>
You have to look at it a little more &quot;sideways&quot; - by that I mean,  <br/>
don&#39;t see it so black and white. Take bits of it and combine things.<br/>
<br/>
For example, your daughter likes to hang out with you and your women  <br/>
friends. Start a book club - once a month you have a group of women  <br/>
friends come over and everybody has read the same book. You have food  <br/>
(everyone contributes) based on a theme related to the book you all  <br/>
read. You might have a little related game, some decorations, people  <br/>
might even dress up. You spend a bit of time talking about the book,  <br/>
most of the time is socializing. (You can google how to run book  <br/>
clubs, but do keep it casual and be creative with it.) Now you have  <br/>
one thing - once a month - that is a big social activity for you and  <br/>
your daughter, and your son can be home, in his room, doing what he  <br/>
feels like doing (if he&#39;s into it, he could help with the food,  <br/>
decorations, etc, beforehand, then disappear during the get-together).<br/>
<br/>
Another thing you could add to the mix - a weekly &quot;game day&quot; at your  <br/>
house. Invite a group of kids to come to play RISK or some other  <br/>
particular game that your daughter might enjoy. Make cookies, provide  <br/>
a good nice clear comfy space and some background music. All you need  <br/>
is a couple of kids and she&#39;s in a &quot;group.&quot; You could do this at your  <br/>
house, so your son can, again, just hang out where he wants and you  <br/>
can be with him while you still hostess the game-players.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you&#39;re going to say - you were looking for how to pattern  <br/>
your day-to-day existence, not for ideas of one-time activities.<br/>
<br/>
My answer is that that IS how your day-to-day existence gets its  <br/>
&quot;pattern,&quot; it is nothing more than the accumulation of all your plans.<br/>
<br/>
Your daughter wants more activity? Help her get that by setting up  <br/>
activities for her and helping her with transportation. Can you  <br/>
provide as much of YOUR time in all these social activities as you  <br/>
think she wants? Probably not - you have time constraints as real as  <br/>
budget constraints. You have another child with different needs.  <br/>
That&#39;s just a flat-out reality that your whole family can accept and  <br/>
adjust to in the exact same way you adjust to whatever your particular  <br/>
income level and standard of living are. You don&#39;t gain anything by  <br/>
wishing it was different, you work it out - not by constantly  <br/>
bemoaning how you don&#39;t have enough money, but by constantly focusing  <br/>
on spending it on what will give you the most satisfaction. Do the  <br/>
same with the kids. Spend your time with a positive energy, just like  <br/>
you do your money.<br/>
<br/>
When your daughter wants to do two or three social outings in one day,  <br/>
one right on top of the other, and seems disappointed that you can&#39;t  <br/>
manage that because you feel the need to be there for your home-loving  <br/>
son, don&#39;t focus on how you&#39;re not able to 100 percent meet all of  <br/>
both kids&#39; immediate desires. Focus on overall meeting their needs -  <br/>
hers for more social life and his for more home life. Point out to her  <br/>
what you WILL be doing.<br/>
<br/>
I had this scenario in my family, quite often.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve spent hours at the beach with a large group of families. Roya is  <br/>
energized and happy and excited and doesn&#39;t want it to end, wants to  <br/>
start something else immediately with some of the people we just spent  <br/>
a lot of time with. Roxana is worn out, had enough, desperately wants  <br/>
to go home and curl up with a book all by herself and recuperate.<br/>
<br/>
I might arrange for Roya to go with some of the other people there and  <br/>
have dinner and spend the evening with them. I might invite a couple  <br/>
of her friends to go home with us to watch a movie or something.<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes I would not be able to arrange something and we&#39;d go home.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d pull into the driveway of our house and Roya would be, in her  <br/>
very high energy and demanding way, asking, &quot;What now?&quot; I&#39;d say,  <br/>
&quot;Right now we go in the house and you find something to do on your own  <br/>
for a while because the rest of us need some down time.&quot; I&#39;d be  <br/>
sympathetic, but I&#39;d feel okay about this because we DID spend the day  <br/>
in a big social situation and Roxana really DID need the down time.  <br/>
I&#39;d feel okay about it the same way I&#39;d feel okay about saying, &quot;Right  <br/>
now we can&#39;t buy a new American Girl doll, but we will do our best to  <br/>
figure out a way to get one for you.&quot; Meeting our kids needs doesn&#39;t  <br/>
mean we can (magically) overcome all real constraints - it means we  <br/>
are willing to consider and be creative and try to do our best to  <br/>
support our kids&#39; interests.<br/>
<br/>
The nice thing about this is that the kids will, over time, realize  <br/>
how we are truly trying to make life good for them and they will  <br/>
appreciate it. My kids, at 17, 21, and 24, look around at how parents  <br/>
generally are so very uncaring about children&#39;s needs and interests,  <br/>
and they mention all the time how differently we treated them. This in  <br/>
SPITE of the fact that I could not possibly claim that I could always  <br/>
do exactly what every kid wanted exactly when they wanted. It was  <br/>
always a matter of doing our best to balance what different people  <br/>
wanted.<br/>

interesting - that is not at all what i was going to say! i do find that i am pretty creative about one time activities, although new ideas are always great to hear.  but  really appreciated your detailed descriptions of how you responded to different situations and your inventive ways for addressing the different needs.  i guess i wasn&#39;t clear enough about all we DO do in that vein, in an effort to be brief.<br/>
<br/>
i have done almost ALL the things you mention, and many of them work well, for sure!  inviting folks into our home doesn&#39;t work well, unfortunately, as my son finds that very stressful (at least other kids).  i have definitely had adult women parties/focused groups/activities and that works well.  but everything else you mentioned is great, and a good reminder to just do more of that.  <br/>
<br/>
i am not &quot;not looking for solutions&quot; - but i am not really lookng for solutions, either, just ideas/experiences that might contrinbute to broadening my perspective on how to meet everyone&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
i *defintitely* try to focus on all of the ways in which things *are* working and all of the gifts that come with having different temperaments in the family - all the value gained for everyone and i DO appreciate all of that.  i was just looking for some inspiration into how things look for similar folks with a similar constitution in their family.<br/>
<br/>
i am sorry if i came across as &quot;yes-butting&quot; - i really do appreciate the ideas i got, and i will absolutely think about how things that might not first appear to have worked might actually work!<br/>

  Does she have interest in classes of any sort?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  yeah - she&#39;d LOVE to take a writing class and we are both bummed and frustrated about that.  she attended a local young writers group, but all the kids there were there for extra credit not because they actually like writing.  so i found a &quot;writer&#39;s haven&quot; place that has a ton of awesome sounding classes - geared toward adults, but she was very excited about the prospect of takign a novel writing class there, as she is deep in the midst of writing her second novel...it says on the site to write for special permission to let a teen into the class - so we did.  she was denied.  the reason given was that teens usually need support and affirmation, while adults are given brutal honesty about their writing.  we have written back asking for reconsideration, saying brutal honesty is what she really wants - have yet to hear back...<br/>
<br/>
  i also looked into community college classes, and may need to go that route again, but if you are under 16 it requires an exemption from compsulsory education letter from the district, and that would require registration, i assume...<br/>

  leave little sister at home and go do stuff for a few hours. Sometimes<br/>
  we just walked around downtown PDX and looked a window displays,<br/>
  sometimes we&#39;d go out for coffee or a movie or the mall.<br/>

  months. We did it just long enough to be ready to stop doing it by the<br/>
  last day. Now a month out, we miss it. I try to take Chamille to the<br/>
  grocery store with me while leaving Margaux behind with dad. It&#39;s not<br/>
  totally exciting, yet it&#39;s time away from home getting stuff done, and<br/>
  time to talk and listen to music together and check stuff out.<br/>
<br/>
  yes!  we do this kidn of thing often and it does help a  lot!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

  and Chamille knows that, yet she&#39;s been reluctant to set stuff up<br/>
  herself, until VERY recently.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  yes, i am always available for transportation, and yet, because she is recently unschooling, most of her friends are in school (that&#39;s why we started the teen unschoolers yahoo group! - hopefully that will turn into something!)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;I have very similar issues in regards to meeting the needs of both my<br/>

  expecially if it&#39;s so her sister can get out. If I set up stuff for<br/>
  Margaux without her sister, she&#39;s very into it. So, unlike you, I have<br/>
  to kids that like to get out and about, but mostly not together, and the<br/>
  younger one can&#39;t stay home alone yet, and my older one doesn&#39;t really<br/>
  like to stay home alone all the time, sometimes, but not always. <br/>
  Finding things they both like, is hard because of the huge age<br/>
  difference, and it&#39;s only getting more and more that way!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  thanks for that - it&#39;s nice to hear others find it challenging at times.<br/>

  that Chamille has a friend with a car. I have mixed feelings about it,<br/>
  but it&#39;s a first and it could turn out great for everyone.&gt;&gt;<br/>

  wow yeah that is rather terrifying and liberating at the same time, i&#39;d imagine!  my daughter often dreams of when she can drive!<br/>

On this list, no matter what you thought you were &quot;just looking for,&quot;  <br/>

It seems you&#39;re blaming your son for your daughter&#39;s unhappiness, and  <br/>
blaming her personality and needs for his frustration.   There were  <br/>
more negative phrases than I bet you realized you used.  Neither of  <br/>
your kids seems to be blind or physically disabled or deaf or  <br/>
seriously ill.  The tone of the post seemed to suggest things were  <br/>
dire, though, and hopeless.  It did sound like you wanted solutions.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce only has one child, but her ideas might be worth ten times that  <br/>
of someone with children almost exactly like yours, so please don&#39;t  <br/>
try to limit your feedback to just similar folks with a similar  <br/>
constitution in their similar family.  The principles of unschooling  <br/>
are larger than any one family&#39;s personal experience.<br/>

wow really??  Interesting.... I am definitely noticing that my DAUGHTER is blaming my son, but I really don&#39;t blame him at all..i was trying to find ways to honor his temperament while meeting her needs so maybe it wouldn&#39;t feel so &#39;limited because of him&#39; to my daughter...<br/>

I don&#39;t think I blame my daughter at all for his experience as she and I are more similar twmperament wise....<br/>

I am definitely interested in the principles of unschooling and I do recognize that &#39;similar experience&#39; can look lots of different ways and doesn&#39;t have to mean same number of children or same exact experience.<br/>

suppose there&#39;s no getting around occasional boredom.  In writer&#39;s groups<br/>

of writers.. ;).  And so you&#39;ll have that where the person leading the group<br/>
is holding a group/class in order to have an audience.<br/>

It could still be a place to meet others who *are* interested in writing.<br/>
Encourage your daughter to consider the possibilities of others in the<br/>
class/group besides the leader/teacher as avenues of interest for her to<br/>
pursue with those who are likeminded, rather than seeing the class/group<br/>
only for the specified purpose of the activity it&#39;s supposed to be for.<br/>
Yes, your daughter may have clear expectations yet she might glean many more<br/>
social and critiquing/writing/collaborative opportunities by focusing on any<br/>
positives she can find rather than tunneling in on what was boring her to<br/>

<br/>
I rarely post because I feel I must still learn so much, it&#39;s probably <br/>
better to keep my mouth quiet and my ears and eyes open, but I felt I <br/>
simply must.  And ordinarily I would not post about an individual on any <br/>
list, because I know it&#39;s not the point of the list.  I&#39;m going to, <br/>
though, because it felt very personally as though it was more about Lyla <br/>
herself than what she asked.<br/>
<br/>
In defense of Lyla, I&#39;ve known her for almost 10 years personally, <br/>
spoken with her every day, been to gatherings with her, gotten together <br/>
as often as the divergent characters of our children have allowed us to. <br/>
  I can say with all assuredness that Lyla is one of the most positive, <br/>
loving, supportive people I know.  Her children love her, MY children <br/>
love her, all the children she knows love her.<br/>
<br/>
She is the antithesis of a complainer.  She is fiercely in love with her <br/>
children (all children, frankly), constantly seeking ideas and <br/>
perspective to become an even better Mama than the amazing Mama she <br/>
already is.  She is also one of my most valued and loved friends.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing Lyla, I know she was genuinely seeking advice/input/ideas, and <br/>
many of the ideas she was presented with were ones she had already <br/>
tried.  She is a scientist of human nature and was looking for new ideas <br/>
that she might be able to adapt to her situation.  I also know her <br/>
children well -- the question made perfect sense to me.  She has never <br/>
blamed her children for anything.  On the contrary.  She was one of <br/>
those wise women that taught me through modeling really early on not to <br/>
blame my own children (as my parents had blamed me).<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps there was more read into her post than she ever intended? <br/>
Perhaps it was a miscommunication?  Perhaps she didn&#39;t word it properly? <br/>
  Or there was a misunderstanding of what she was seeking?<br/>
<br/>
When I first read her post, my thoughts were &quot;wow, what a great post for <br/>
this list&quot;.  Was it not a bit of valuable piece of information she was <br/>
seeking from those further on in the journey than herself?  I was <br/>
interested in hearing the answers.  I was very surprised at the above <br/>
response, particularly as I know her.  Perhaps tough love is a good <br/>
thing, in some regards.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to put that out there.  Don&#39;t mean to open up wounds, or <br/>
anything, or criticize anyone on the list.  Just to publicly affirm <br/>
someone who I respect, admire and cherish.<br/>
<br/>
And believe me, Lyla started examining that possibility in herself the <br/>
moment she read the above response.  :/  Thing is, she&#39;s not like that.<br/>
<br/>
Very best,<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Properly&quot; isn&#39;t  a good measure.  There&#39;s more than one way to work  <br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone who reads  anything reads it from inside herself (or himself).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people communicate more than they intended, or more than  <br/>
than they knew they knew.  It&#39;s part of the value of journals.<br/>
<br/>
For the purposes of this list, it&#39;s okay for there to be  <br/>
misunderstandings about what people were seeking.  As Joyce wrote once:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>

way toward becoming a La Leche League leader (though I dropped that  <br/>
to do cesarean prevention support).  Holly wasn&#39;t nursing right.   <br/>
Something was wrong.  I  had read everything LLL had readily  <br/>
available, including a few years&#39; worth of the publication for  <br/>
leaders, and the leaders&#39; handbook.  I asked several of my friends  <br/>
who were leaders.  Some of their advice was elementary and basic and  <br/>
I was frustrated, because of course I had tried all the easy stuff.   <br/>
I ended up getting help from an outside lactation consultant, and  <br/>
renting and electric pump, and feeding Holly with a tube on my finger  <br/>
for a bit until the suck was established.<br/>
<br/>
What turned out to be the deal was that she was sucking her tongue up  <br/>
against the roof of her mouth.  It was her own little comfort thing.   <br/>
But it kept her from sucking after the first suck.  She was a preemie  <br/>
and the hospital hadn&#39;t noted her as such.  Another friend who was a  <br/>
neonatal nurse pointed that out as though I had known, but I hadn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Long story to say that sometimes a situation IS very unusual, and  <br/>
volunteers can&#39;t help.  But there will be others who learn just from  <br/>
being around the attempt to help, and from hearing of the problem and  <br/>
comparing it to their own experience.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re all adding to our body of knowledge about parenting and  <br/>
unschooling and communications.   It&#39;s okay that not every exchange  <br/>
or discussion is as perfect as if the greatest scriptwriters designed  <br/>
it.  Once in a while one DOES seem perfect, and we should appreciate  <br/>
those more, and regret the imperfections less.<br/>

&gt; Oh sorry I thought you were talking about the class. She was bored to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>tears at the group, the facilitator talked about her arthritis for 30<br/>
minutes, the writing exercise was very juvelile for her, and my daughter<br/>
so nothing there to go back for unfortunately.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, we&#39;ve gone through similar things.  About a year and a half ago,<br/>
Chamille, wanting to find like minded friends, signed up for a library<br/>
anime/manga club.  She was really excited about going and it was geared<br/>
to kids specifically her age.  She went to one meeting and it was a<br/>
horrible experience for her.  All the other kids had come with at least<br/>
one other friend, it was in a large space and everyone sat seperately,<br/>
leaving Chamille sitting by herself, and the leader of the group didn&#39;t<br/>
gather everyone up to do introductions or any other group cohesive<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
I called the library and told them what happened and how dissappointed<br/>
we were that a leader at the library would allow for any kid to feel<br/>
left out in a group dynamic and start a meetup without at least informal<br/>
friendly introductions.  It was set up like a classroom, the leader<br/>
standing in front and all the kids sitting there listening.  They<br/>
assured me that they&#39;d talk with the leader of the group, did so, and<br/>
got back to me to let me know that they&#39;d be doing introductions and<br/>
more casual friendliness at the next meetup.  However, Chamille refused<br/>
to go again because the first experience was so yucky for her, after she<br/>
had bravely got up the nerve to jump into a potential social situation.<br/>
<br/>
There was no amount of convincing her that it would be different the<br/>
next time, that made her want to give it another go.  In general with<br/>
these sorts of things, the person leading the group is a volunteer,<br/>
generously giving of their time wether they know what they are doing or<br/>
not, so I&#39;ve always figured that feedback was important.  It never<br/>
gauranteed that my kids would give it another chance, but knowing that I<br/>
was trying to help the situation be better, has always helped them feel<br/>
better, especially for Chamille because she cares about people and was<br/>
happy that it wouldn&#39;t happen to another kid like her.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943770973"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; well, she did stay for the whole 2 hours. i agree the that the people<br/>
 </span></blockquote>who show up might vary from month to month, and her original intention<br/>
*was* to meet other kids interested in writing, but that just did not<br/>
seem to be the case to her, at least that one evening. she may agree to<br/>
give it another try, although i think at this point she tends to enjoy<br/>
the company of older teens and adults more than younger or same age<br/>
teens, which is what this group appeared to be comprised of...<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been true for Chamille too!  Something that I&#39;ve had to let go,<br/>
is the idea of giving it another go, because, in general, Chamille gets<br/>
a really good feel for the situation and sizing it up and knows almost<br/>
immediately wether or not she&#39;ll like something based on the initial<br/>
sense for it.  If she&#39;s unsure, she&#39;ll continue until she knows.  It&#39;s<br/>
been hugely frustrating at times for me, because I&#39;m accustomed to<br/>
sticking something through, even if I don&#39;t initially like it.  Chamille<br/>
is just so not that way and everything I set up for her, I do so knowing<br/>
that she may want to back out after the first time.  The absolute<br/>
exception to that has been the haunted house thing, even though, she<br/>
really made no lasting social contacts which we were hoping for.  She<br/>
would go again in a heart beat tomorrow with or without time to do her<br/>
hair first!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Even looking at how we miscommunicate or are misunderstood can be  <br/>
really helpful to us.<br/>
<br/>
LIke I said, I didn&#39;t say anything the first time, but there was a  <br/>
second post that gave the same impression. So - what I said was, as  <br/>
quoted, &quot;You sound like people I know who aren&#39;t really looking for  <br/>
solutions,...&quot;  The reason I worded it that way was because that had  <br/>
NOT been the impression I had from other posts, but in those TWO  <br/>
posts, that&#39;s how it sounded. So I said she might want to examine that  <br/>
in herself. None of us is perfect - we have our &quot;issues&quot; - our hot  <br/>
spots - our blind spots. I suggested she consider it and I still  <br/>
think, upon rereading those posts, that might be something to consider.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see the need for a response to that which defends Lyla in any  <br/>
way - this comment was in no way at all a comment on what kind of  <br/>
person she is, it was pointing out what she was sounding like in those  <br/>
two posts as being something worth looking at.<br/>
<br/>
Are we not all here to try to be better? Sometimes people will post  <br/>
things that we don&#39;t feel great about hearing, sometimes they&#39;ll touch  <br/>
on something we didn&#39;t expect to be so tender about, sometimes people  <br/>
will be way off-base and we&#39;ll shake our heads and wonder how they  <br/>
possibly got THAT out of what we said. It&#39;s all in the interest of  <br/>
helping each other out.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps there was more read into her post than she ever intended?<br/>
Perhaps it was a miscommunication?  Perhaps she didn&#39;t word it properly?<br/>
  Or there was a misunderstanding of what she was seeking?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I first read her post, my thoughts were &quot;wow, what a great post for<br/>
this list&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It was. And it got a lot of good responses and I&#39;m sure a lot of  <br/>
people got good ideas from it. But none of the ideas seemed to be  <br/>
useful to Lyla, really.<br/>
<br/>
  Was it not a bit of valuable piece of information she was seeking  <br/>
from those further on in the journey than herself?<br/>
<br/>
Did you mistake my comments as complaints about her post? Not at all.  <br/>
Great post - it got feedback that was probably very useful to others,  <br/>
but it didn&#39;t seem that Lyla was getting what she was hoping for.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I was very surprised at the above response, particularly as I know  <br/>
her.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if those two posts reflected some deeper-than-usual  <br/>
frustration with this one issue - that would possibly explain  <br/>
uncharacteristic negativity.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps tough love is a good thing, in some regards.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tough love&quot; is a specific kind of parenting that I would NEVER ever  <br/>
want to be associated with. But sometimes hearing the perspective of  <br/>
someone who doesn&#39;t know you at all, is responding entirely to what  <br/>
you say in a post, is surprising and at least worth thinking about.  <br/>
Like Sandra mentioned, sometimes we say more in a post than we intend  <br/>
to say. Sometimes strangers will see underlying stuff that those who  <br/>
know us overlook.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Just wanted to put that out there.  Don&#39;t mean to open up wounds, or<br/>
anything, or criticize anyone on the list.  Just to publicly affirm<br/>
someone who I respect, admire and cherish.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If Lyla had her feelings hurt, then I&#39;m really really sorry. I didn&#39;t  <br/>
get the feeling that she would - I thought she&#39;d think about how she  <br/>
was thinking about the issue and that it might give her a way to shift  <br/>
her thinking into a new direction.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And believe me, Lyla started examining that possibility in herself the<br/>
moment she read the above response.  :/  Thing is, she&#39;s not like  <br/>
that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ummm - she was like that in those posts. So - it wasn&#39;t typical of  <br/>
her. And I imagine she doesn&#39;t want to be like that. So why did it  <br/>
come across that way in those posts?  Not a real question that you  <br/>
need to answer here - something for her - and maybe others - to  <br/>
consider.<br/>
