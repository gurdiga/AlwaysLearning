<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357721751">My daughter has always liked cat and dog food -- the dry kind.  Before learning about <br/>
unschooling or attachment parenting (ten years ago or so) I told her no, she couldn&#39;t eat it.  Then when I was cleaning, I would find it behind chairs and under the bed, little caches of the <br/>
stuff, ready for her to enjoy.  But she had to hide it from me and sneak to eat it.  (She ate <br/>
sand, too, when we went to the beach.)  I&#39;ve noticed a couple times over the years, she&#39;ll <br/>
taste a little  dog food and laugh to herself.        She&#39;s 14 now and doesn&#39;t make it a regular <br/>
part of her diet.   <br/>
<br/>
Happy Anniversary to this brilliant list.<br/>
