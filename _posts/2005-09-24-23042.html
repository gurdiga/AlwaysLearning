<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302064774">Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to stop in and say hello...<br/>
<br/>
Hello!!!<br/>
<br/>
I have been pretty busy lately working with a project<br/>
in the state of Connecticut - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://freedomcycle.org">http://freedomcycle.org</a><br/>
- as well as a Global Project -<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://recyclecentral.org">http://recyclecentral.org</a> - both Online Recycling<br/>
Communities.<br/>
<br/>
It is a lot of fun, and something to consider getting<br/>
involved in. Even children and teens can participate<br/>
in online recycling and it can be a great (and fun)<br/>
way to save our environment and learn about recycling,<br/>
the environment and consumerism.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great weekend!<br/>
Deanna.<br/>
