Someone found a link to that page and sent me a note, so I&#39;ve gone in  <br/>
and cleaned it up, replaced the broken George Carlin link with an  <br/>
embedded video (I love the internet).    He&#39;s being crass and harsh  <br/>
and rude, and also as usual funny and profound.  So watch that at  <br/>
your own risk, but anyone new(ish) to the question of the damage of  <br/>
labels might want to read there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
