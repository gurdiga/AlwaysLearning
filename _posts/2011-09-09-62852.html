<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512555219">I&#39;m listening to Ronnie Maier&#39;s talk &quot;Roadblocks and Roundabouts&quot;<br/>
<br/>
RIDE<br/>
<br/>
  After a story about how when driving in England, Ronnie figured out you can stay on the roundabout until you decide which exit to take, she came up with a little system for dealing with panic about which direction to take.<br/>
<br/>
Recognize your triggers.  Tension?  Queasiness?  What are your clues?<br/>
<br/>
Identify the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Decide what to do, or how to react, or how to respond.<br/>
<br/>
Explore together.  Get off the roundabout and get back on.  Find alternatives.</div>
