old who&#39;s not reading. I can see how he&#39;s progressing toward reading, but to <br/>
most of the world he&#39;s just &quot;NOT READING. &quot;<br/>

LOL, LOL!! I am not sure if you meant it to be funny or not but I <br/>
enjoyed it.  And I know what you mean because as much as I just want <br/>
to trust in the internal stuff it is reassuring to see some external <br/>
stuff sometimes (at least for newbies like me).  It just goes to <br/>
prove that kids will do things when they have a good reason!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-777826108">Great story Julie, and funny! Just like my 2 boys - always playing pranks on each other. Thanks for sharing that. I have an 8 yo son too and I love spontaneously noticing things that he does (that I&#39;m so proud of) all on his own. It&#39;s great that the pressure is finally off him - and me, to read and write at a certain age. I love unschooling.<br/>

  Neatest thing is happening.  Zach is 8 and while he is tremendously gifted athletically, has always struggled tremendously at anything academic.  He is tremendously active, gregarious and emotionally intense.  But things seem to be jelling, something neurological.  For the first time, Zach is able to draw pictures, control his coloring, attempting to read things in the environment (he had tried that a couple of years ago, and then stopped).  <br/>
<br/>
  Then today, he WROTE.  For the very first time, Zach CHOSE to voluntarily sit down with pen and paper and sound out WORDS!!!!!!  I am so excited.  Of course, what he wrote was a &quot;kick me&quot; sign that he put on his little sister&#39;s back.  It is so reassuring to see him maturing, becoming more comfortable in his own skin.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-35945423"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Not here, isn&#39;t that nice?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah it is nice, and along that vein, I have a concern about my own 8 yo <br/>
boy, Will.<br/>
<br/>
He can read and write (all caps only--refuses to use lined <br/>
paper----spells phonetically but remembers if you spell for him <br/>
once--still sounds out a lot of words).  He&#39;s bright and talented and <br/>
into reptiles and baseball.  The homeschool Zoo Academy is coming up in <br/>
February, which he is incredibly excited about.  The problem is they <br/>
sent a &quot;pre-activity&quot; along with the registration confirmation.  For <br/>
some reason I put him in 2nd grade, not thinking...Anyway, the <br/>
pre-activity was to write two sentences using each vocabulary word and <br/>
to fill in the blanks on a set of animal descriptions.  <br/>
<br/>
If Zoo Academy is going to be like this, it might just ruin everything <br/>
for him.  He doesn&#39;t understand the school paradigm at all.  He didn&#39;t <br/>
know what fill in the blank was.  He didn&#39;t even register what a <br/>
sentence was (but I know he knows it in another context).  He picked up <br/>
the fill in the blanks thing and answered all the questions correctly. <br/>
 (big whoop)  And as soon as I told him he could type the sentences, he <br/>
was eager to do them.  It took him a long time to do one set of <br/>
sentences.  (Of course, he wrote one sentence for each word and plans to <br/>
write a second set with each word, which is what a person in school <br/>
would know is the &quot;wrong&quot; way.)  Some of his sentences do not make sense <br/>
(ie., A bat is echolocation.--he learned how to do the &quot;underline the <br/>
vocabulary word&quot; part on the computer.  lol.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m trying to figure out a way to let him know that there is a <br/>
chance his sentences will not fit their mold, will be odd to them--you <br/>
folks know what I mean...I&#39;m afraid someone will say something to him <br/>
about his abilities (I&#39;m afraid it will be another homeschooler, too. <br/>
:P).  And that the Zoo Academy is going to have more writing than last <br/>
year.  These are other homeschoolers, but not unschoolers (I guarantee <br/>
it).  And the zoo staff won&#39;t get it either.  I won&#39;t tell him it&#39;s time <br/>
for him to learn to write &quot;properly&quot; before he gets to Zoo Academy. My <br/>
natural reaction is to volunteer for the class (they only allow two <br/>
parents), and he wants me there.  I could run interference for him if I <br/>
were there.  But I didn&#39;t get a volunteer form with my registration (I&#39;m <br/>
calling tomorrow to volunteer, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a responsive kid and I can see that he could fall either way on <br/>
this issue.  There has already been some frustration with the writing <br/>
and the sentences.  Either the week will cause him to get completely <br/>
frustrated, or it could be a spark that leads him into his next phase of <br/>
literacy.<br/>
<br/>
I need a pep talk.<br/>
