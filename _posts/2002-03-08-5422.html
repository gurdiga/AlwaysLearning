<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302853157">I&#39;ve never been to a convention.  A woman from our local unschooling list<br/>
went to one a few years ago and ended up walking out when the speaker<br/>
said there was no point in educating girls too much because then they<br/>
wouldn&#39;t want to serve God or their husbands.  <br/>
We few brave Montana unschoolers are planning to go to the convention in<br/>
June here,  to listen to John Taylor Gatto, and I&#39;m embarrassed to say,<br/>
or maybe not, that his was the only name I recognized.   I don&#39;t know<br/>
what to expect regarding the rest of the convention.   Wish I had<br/>
something really good to look forward to.  I have this horrible feeling<br/>
I&#39;ll spend the money and be sorry I did.  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s too much dread to overcome!  If you look forward to it, you&#39;ll at <br/>
least break even.<br/>
<br/>
Unless it&#39;s a really Christian conference, I know what to expect in <br/>
general--there will be experienced homeschoolers who are all calm and you can <br/>
borrow some of their energy, and some newcomers who are afraid, and you could <br/>
cheer them up, and lots of cool stuff to look at in the vendor room (and some <br/>
scary stuff to make you glad you&#39;re an unschooler), and as the weekend goes <br/>
on you&#39;ll know some people and be having a good time.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my experience.  It&#39;s probably about the same at a Christian <br/>
conference, except starts with a prayer and more of the speeches would be by <br/>
men who were saying America needed to get back to its Christian purpose, and <br/>
the family was the model of the nation and of the church, and men were the <br/>
head of the family.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-856566096">In our area the christian homeschool community adn teh inclusive secular<br/>
side don&#39;t mix too much. I tend to not go to any HS conferences that are<br/>
sponsored by a christian group. I&#39;m not christian for one, and I don&#39;t<br/>
school at home for the other. Nothing for me there. The unschooling<br/>
conference coming up is the first one I&#39;ll be attending out of my local<br/>
area. I may not even go to the local one this year, I might spend the money<br/>
taking my daughter to a feminist radical type music festival in Michigan<br/>
this summer. We can walk around topless and paint flowers on our breasts.<br/>
Sounds like more fun and She&#39;ll get much more out of that than looking at<br/>
various curriculums in the junior college cafeteria!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes!  I&#39;ve never been myself, but I&#39;ve heard so much about it.  I know women <br/>
who go every year. I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s something every woman should attend at <br/>
least once.  I would like to go, I think, but I&#39;m such not the camper.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
