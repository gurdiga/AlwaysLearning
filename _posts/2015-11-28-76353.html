<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109116338"><p>Looking for some advice in regards to siblings hitting/getting phyiscal each other. My kids are 8,6,4 and almost 2 (the 2 year old isn&#39;t hitting...yet). The hitting seems to stem from the oldest. I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out for a while now, recently we were able to talk about it and it seems like the hitting stems from 3 things: 1: he&#39;s annoyed/frustrated by his brothers and can&#39;t stop himself in the heat of the moment 2: he&#39;s bored so he starts trouble, and 3: he&#39;s trying to get a raise out of the younger ones cause he thinks the way they screech is funny. Often it starts #2 or 3 and the younger ones get frustrated with him and we end up with #1. I admit that I used to use time outs, I was raised being spanked so I thought it was a good alternative but we no longer do that. I&#39;ve been trying to offer alternative things to do when he is feeling bored or needs some amusement and he did come up with a short list of things he might rather do and that has helped some. Yet everyday they&#39;re still at it. &nbsp;To the folks I know &nbsp;IRL the hitting seems minor (they&#39;re advice is the typical spank, yell, take stuff away) but I believe we all have the right to live here without being hit or harassed by someone else (including me) even if it is &quot;minor&quot; &nbsp;I&#39;ve been reading here for a while now and find the advice to be so helpful and insightful. &nbsp;So with hope and an open heart &amp; mind I ask for your advice. Thank you!</p></div>

<br/>
Be with them more.<br/>
Don’t leave them all together as much.<br/>
<br/>
More details on how I dealt with my kids is at the link below, but I said “you can hit IF…”<br/>
That seemed easier thatn “You can never hit.”  And don’t tell a child NEVER to hit, because he might need to defend himself someday.<br/>
<br/>
Our “you can hit if” was<br/>
First, talk about it.  <br/>
If talking doesn’t help, get a grown-up’s help.<br/>
If that doesn’t help, you can hit him.<br/>
<br/>
It never got to that point, but the kids didn’t know it wouldn’t, when they were little.<br/>

<div>
<div>-=-&nbsp; recently we were able to talk about it and it seems like the 
hitting stems from 3 things-=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are nearby, noticing what is going on, you will not have to ask your 
son what is going on with him because you will know by your own 
observation.&nbsp; Most people, especially young people, are often not very good 
at understanding why they feel the way they do, especially when&nbsp;they&#39;re 
upset.&nbsp; Asking your son is not as useful as being present.&nbsp; Once you 
start to understand through your own observation&nbsp;what is triggering these 
moments you will have more information on how to proceed.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are present, you will feel the energy changing in the room 
and&nbsp;can look for&nbsp;ways&nbsp;to diffuse&nbsp;negative 
emotions&nbsp;before they get to the level of physical aggression.&nbsp; You can 
help your son before he gets to a point where he feels pushed beyond his limits. 
Little things like doing something goofy, offering ice cream, distracting the 
little ones to another space - aimed at changing the dynamic in that moment in a 
light hearted, positive way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>My son, now 11, used to get quite aggressive with his sister.&nbsp; She is 
a little older but he is stronger and it became a scary thing for her.&nbsp; 
Before learning from this group, I would get mad at my son for his physical 
aggression toward her.&nbsp; Instead of trying to get to the source of 
the&nbsp;problem I&nbsp;would put him in time out or send him to his room to 
&quot;think about it&quot;. All very humiliating and isolating for him, in 
hindsight.&nbsp; I was trying to change a behavior instead of trying to 
understand my son.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I learned from this group to be more present and aware so that I could 
intervene sooner. I learned to look right at him and try to understand what he 
was thinking and feeling.&nbsp; I softened toward him. I became more patient, 
more compassionate about what he was feeling, thinking, needing. He was not able 
to verbalize what he needed &amp; felt so he let things build up inside of him 
until something triggered it and he exploded.&nbsp; It was really important for 
me to tune in to what was going on with him and patiently figure it out 
together. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I realized that when I would ask him things like &quot;how could you do that to 
your sister?&quot; he didn&#39;t understand why and&nbsp;he began to think&nbsp;that he 
was a&nbsp;bad person with &quot;an anger problem&quot;. He didn&#39;t want to hurt her but he 
couldn&#39;t control himself so he was a bad, angry kid. That&#39;s what he 
thought.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>When I first started to change my approach, there were times that he would 
seem to quickly snap, become very angry&nbsp;and charge at her.&nbsp; I stayed 
close enough that I could physically intervene to protect my daughter and also 
understand the nuance of what had triggered it.&nbsp; There were times that I 
would literally leap between them.&nbsp; For a time, after he started trusting 
me but before he knew what else to do with his big emotions, I would leap 
between them &amp; he would physically crash/collapse into me and 
discharge&nbsp;much of that pent up anger.&nbsp; I could tell that he was trying 
not to hurt me and would&nbsp;try to have us tumble onto the couch or somewhere 
safe together&nbsp;that we could land in a big, angry, confused hug.&nbsp; Then 
I would separate them to different rooms and listen to both sides.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Because I was there and saw the build up there was no he said/she 
said.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was&nbsp;able to have deeper, more meaningful conversations 
with them about what had happened and try to encourage empathy, 
understanding,&nbsp;patience and forgiveness&nbsp;on both sides. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>One thing that came to light was that he was frustrated that I was always 
taking his sister&#39;s side.&nbsp; I saw it as&nbsp;protecting her, he saw it as me 
taking her side and him getting in trouble/her winning.&nbsp;We 
talked&nbsp;about that, at quiet times when no one was upset.&nbsp; I made more 
effort to help him&nbsp;feel that I am always on his side and here to support 
and protect him as well.&nbsp; I listened to him, tried to make him feel 
important &amp; understood, did special things with him just the two of 
us.&nbsp; I still do those things.&nbsp; We have almost no fighting in our house 
now.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can imagine that if I were 8 and I had a 6, 4 and 2 year old always 
messing up my stuff and getting in my way that it would be very 
frustrating.&nbsp; I imagine that if my mom didn&#39;t understand my frustration but 
instead got angry at me and &quot;took sides&quot; with the other children (from his 
perspective) that would make me sad and mad.&nbsp; I might feel misunderstood, 
alone.&nbsp; I might wonder what was wrong with me for not being a better 
child.&nbsp; I might long for a closer connection with my parents and siblings 
but I might not know how to get there.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I can imagine how grateful I&#39;d be for a mom who took the time to stop and 
understand me, help me find some space of my own, love me through my imperfect 
moments.&nbsp; I can imagine how hopeful that would make me feel.&nbsp; </div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27291331">I deleted a post from the queue, from  mom with very young children.  It was linking a blog post on a site that wasn’t about unschooling.  Unless there’s no equivalent or better unschooling resource, outside links can be a problem.  First problem is the thousands (maybe only hundreds are reading) of members of this group who might provide hits to a commercial site<br/>
<br/>
Second problem is that the advice might not be great, and I don’t want us to spend much time analyzing things that weren’t by and for unschoolers anyway.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, it matches a post I returned from here yesterday, though in another topic, so I’m going to bring two things here as bad examples.<br/>
<br/>
A quote from the article I didn’t love (sorry, to the mom who brought it; I hope you’ll understand):<br/>
_________<br/>
<br/>
I gently acknowledged that they both seemed upset and wanted the bean bag. I then allowed the scuffle to proceed with the repeated use of the phrase:<br/>
<br/>
“I won’t let you touch her. I need to keep you safe!”<br/>
<br/>
This meant ensuring they had no physical contact with each other. They could struggle as much as they liked over the actual bean bag but were not permitted to touch each other.<br/>
_____________<br/>
<br/>
The title of the article talked about “one simple phrase,” but that’s two phrases, and not simple and in kid-world, it’s a long speech.<br/>
-=-“I won’t let you touch her. I need to keep you safe!”-=-<br/>
<br/>
But meanwhile they can tussle over physical property?  And struggle as much as they like?  WHY?  They can still get hurt without physical contact with each other.  Sticks, rocks, snowballs, guns… that’s no physical contact.<br/>
<br/>
Two days ago, I returned a post that had this advice (though in another topic).  I will post my response to the author below that.  It only went to her and the moderators at the time.<br/>
________________________<br/>
<br/>
-=-I refuse to get involved in squabbles unless someone has done something to harm another or is doing something that will keep them out of heaven.  Everything else I allow them to resolve.  If it&#39;s too contentious, they are idle, tired, or being selfish. -=-<br/>
<br/>
________________<br/>
My response:<br/>
________________<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It’s not a safe environment if the children are left to squabble, and then insulted as “idle, tired or selfish” if they DO squabble.  MANY adults have reported serious emotional, physical and sexual abuse from siblings whose parents had policies like “work it out” and “don’t tattle.”  I will never let advice like that stand in any discussion I’ve organized and provided a space for.  Those traditional, harmful philosophies are available in a million other places.  The Always Learning discussion will not be one of them.<br/>
<br/>
___________end of quote________<br/>
<br/>
Had the person actually been interested in polishing her approach to unschooling (she didn’t seem to have one to polish), I would have pointed out the negativity and rejection in &quot;I refuse to get involved in squabbles…”<br/>
One can’t “refuse” without having had a request.  So if one of her children asked for help, or a rescue, or intervention, she would refuse?<br/>
How does that create safety, trust, partnership or learning?<br/>
<br/>
There is a sea of information just a few cicks away from here—to any search engine and there you are, overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
For here, let’s only bring things that have to do with principles that will help unschooling to thrive.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-617884000"><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">A few thoughts:<br><br>&quot;(the 2 year old isn&#39;t hitting...yet).&quot;<br><br>You definitely need to change your thinking. This will make a difference to the way you see your children and, therefore, how you approach supporting them with conflict. Children often hit when they are lost for any other way to manage the situation. Tempers flare and they are relatively immature so lack the resources older children and adults have to reach for before hitting out. Our job as parents is to be present enough to help them use those other tools before hitting begins. So don&#39;t see your children as having something wrong with them for using hitting as a tool when they lose their tempers - see them as young, wonderful beings that, like all young people, need help from an adult to figure out dealing with anger and frustration. Talk, at other times, about how violence and anger get in your way; describe examples of when hitting out makes a situation worse; talk about how situations escalate and how to recognise when that&#39;s starting to happen and to consider if stepping away will be the most productive, helpful thing he can do at that point. If you see it happening, say things like &#39;I can see you&#39;re all starting to get a bit wound up. Do you want some help? Shall we do something different?&#39;<br><br>&quot;</span><span style="font-size:12.8px;"> I admit that I used to use time outs&quot;<br></span><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br>This will take a long time to deschool from, I imagine.

Boredom is an emotion. Instead, offer your presence. Relate to his feeling of boredom. Before long, a loving, snuggly chat will soon lead to something fun. I think many children feel a sense of shame or incapability when we offer long lists of things to do when they say they&#39;re bored and none of them are attractive to them (at the time). It&#39;s easy to feel like your whole life is boring and nothing is fun and that can lead to a feeling of hopelessness - never a good path to go down! If I&#39;m bored, ideas thrown at me by my well-meaning husband never help me. I&#39;m feeling a sense of ennui rather than not having anything to do. Nothing feels attractive. I simply have to find out how to be at peace with that feeling of ennui and, usually, it then passes. Calling a friend for a chat usually shifts the feeling, or surfing the net.

How do Christian unschoolers manage such things? I&#39;m not really interested in whether or not a thing is counted as a &#39;sin&#39; but I am interested in whether or not it hurts or harms someone or something else either physically or emotionally. <br><br>&quot;Everything else I allow them to resolve.&quot;<br><br>Children learn how to do things by being shown how to do them. They learn from the people around them doing those things and helping the them do the things when needed. How likely is it that a child in the heat of a squabble will have the ability to break away and ask an adult to step in? If they can do that, it&#39;s likely they&#39;ll have learned good ways of resolving a dispute themselves already. As parents, it&#39;s our job to help our children when they need it *even* if they&#39;re not in a place to be able to ask for that help, surely? If I was asked explicitly not to (it has happened!) of course I would step away (not too far, though ;) ) - I&#39;m not talking about imposing unwanted help. But when you are close with your children and know them well, knowing when they need help and when they don&#39;t isn&#39;t so difficult and children often *do* need help at times they&#39;re not able to ask for it.  <br><br>&quot;If it&#39;s too contentious, they are idle, tired, or being selfish.&quot;<br><br>:( That&#39;s just a nasty way to talk about children. Unschooling is bound to be really tricky to do well if you have ideas like that in your head, let alone coming out of your mouth/keyboard.</span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-521786081gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-521786081gmail_quote">On 29 November 2015 at 15:55, Clare Kirkpatrick <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:claremkirkpatrick@...">claremkirkpatrick@...</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-521786081gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">A few thoughts:<span class="ygrps-yiv-521786081"><br><br>&quot;(the 2 year old isn&#39;t hitting...yet).&quot;<br><br></span>You definitely need to change your thinking.

      <p></p><p>Looking for some advice in regards to siblings hitting/getting phyiscal each other. My kids are 8,6,4 and almost 2 (the 2 year old isn&#39;t hitting...yet). The hitting seems to stem from the oldest. I&#39;ve been trying to figure this out for a while now, recently we were able to talk about it and it seems like the hitting stems from 3 things: 1: he&#39;s annoyed/frustrated by his brothers and can&#39;t stop himself in the heat of the moment 2: he&#39;s bored so he starts trouble, and 3: he&#39;s trying to get a raise out of the younger ones cause he thinks the way they screech is funny. Often it starts #2 or 3 and the younger ones get frustrated with him and we end up with #1. I admit that I used to use time outs, I was raised being spanked so I thought it was a good alternative but we no longer do that. I&#39;ve been trying to offer alternative things to do when he is feeling bored or needs some amusement and he did come up with a short list of things he might rather do and that has helped some. Yet everyday they&#39;re still at it.  To the folks I know  IRL the hitting seems minor (they&#39;re advice is the typical spank, yell, take stuff away) but I believe we all have the right to live here without being hit or harassed by someone else (including me) even if it is &quot;minor&quot;  I&#39;ve been reading here for a while now and find the advice to be so helpful and insightful.  So with hope and an open heart &amp; mind I ask for your advice. Thank you!</p><p></p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026225959">-=-. If you see it happening, say things like &#39;I can see you&#39;re all starting to get a bit wound up. Do you want some help? Shall we do something different?’-=-<br/>
<br/>
But not all of that.<br/>
And maybe much less.<br/>
<br/>
If being nearer and making a light suggestion doesn’t help, maybe gently and naturally (for a legitimate reason) remove one person (to go to the toilet, or get a drink, or go with you to check the mail, or something), as a pressure-release.  If it doesn’t seem like a simple single change will help, maybe pause the video for a moment and ask if anyone’s ready for lunch, or introduce something into the mix—paper and pens, playdoh…..   but sometimes a single element changing will defuse and diffuse things.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot; I admit that I used to use time outs”<br/>
**This will take a long time to deschool from, I imagine.**<br/>
<br/>
Recovery, more than “deschooling.” <br/>
When a family has spanked, or punished, or required chores, they’re not starting from the beginning to create a new way of being.  First the child will need time to trust that the parents have really changed.  The children’s reactions will be to the spanking or new lack, or the time out or new lack, and it will take a while for them to trust the parents to be different.  Any relapse or steps back on the part of the parent will solidify the lack of trust even longer.  It’s not easy to change, but there are solid ideas for it here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully">http://sandradodd.com/parentingpeacefully</a><br/>
<br/>
-=- If he needs some physical contact, why not go for some rough and tumble play (I think it&#39;s known as rough-housing to some?).-=-<br/>
Many moms (especially) underestimate the amount of physical activity boys (especially) need.  Some kids (girls or boys) need and want to move much more than older, sedate parents might feel like facilitating.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/physicality">http://sandradodd.com/physicality</a><br/>
Maybe hire an older-child neighbor/friend to play with that child, like a run in the park, or to play ball outside, if the mom has younger kids who are better staying in.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Clare’s ideas are good ones, and I’m glad she brought the links to pages about boredom.  There are other ideas collected there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;2: he&#39;s bored so he starts trouble”-=-<br/>
<br/>
When a parent can really begin to see and develop a better partnership with each child, it might look more like the “trouble” was created by the parent leaving the child alone too long.  Children shouldn’t be taking care of themselves, nor wholly entertaining themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
One reason I bristle when I read other people’s/places’ statements like “He will be in charge of his own education” or “He will be in charge of his own learning” is that it seems harsh and lonely and lazy, on the parents’ part.  It doesn’t encourage interaction.  The parents shouldn’t be waiting for a child to ask questions, or to declare an interest or a need.<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian’s article about unschooling NOT being “child led” might be helpful.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/">https://learninghappens.wordpress.com/2011/09/24/unschooling-is-not-child-led-learning/</a><br/>
<br/>
In an enriched and attentive environment there will be more learning and less fighting.<br/>

<div>
<div>-=- Many moms (especially) underestimate the amount of physical activity 
boys (especially) need. Some kids (girls or boys) need and want to move much 
more than older, sedate parents might feel like facilitating. -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I was thinking about this aspect, too.&nbsp; This was an important piece 
for finding a peaceful balance in our home.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you are taking the&nbsp;younger kids&nbsp;to the park&nbsp;maybe the 8 
year old would&nbsp;enjoy things&nbsp;for older kids&nbsp;like parkour, 
skateboarding/razor riding, climbing type activities, larping.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I do play some tackling games with him but at this point we are almost the 
same size so he has to be careful with me.&nbsp; We also do larping on the 
trampoline and I try to throw the ball for him.&nbsp;(I remind him that he needs 
practice&nbsp;catching poorly thrown balls too!)&nbsp;I drag him&nbsp;through 
the snow&nbsp;on a sled with our 4 wheeler for hours in the winter. He has his 
own chainsaw and he enjoys things like&nbsp;cutting down small, dead trees or 
cutting firewood on our property when the weather is warm -&nbsp;with me 
there.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div>I talked to my husband at one point about Ben&#39;s need for more physical 
activities and he makes an effort to do tickling/tackling/ball throwing 
activities with him. Even though my husband is sometimes tired in the evenings 
he reminds himself that it&#39;s important for our son&#39;s happiness and their 
relationship and that this time they have together is fleeting. It is healing 
for him to do things with our son that he wished his dad would have done with 
him.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div></div>
<div>Ben&nbsp;has gotten into football in the past couple of years and that has 
been a great outlet.&nbsp; He plays&nbsp;on a team&nbsp;seasonally and 
also&nbsp;enjoys playing football with Dad or friends, football video games, 
reading sports magazines, memorizing tons of information &amp; then patiently 
trying to explain things to me, watching football&nbsp;with Dad.&nbsp; Lots of 
different interests that have sprung up around that one topic.&nbsp; Now that 
our son is older he is developing a different relationship with his dad and 
that&#39;s been pretty cool.&nbsp; Those are activities between just the two of 
them, no sister involved, and that is nice.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-=- My oldest is 11 and when he&#39;s complaining of being bored, it often 
means he wants someone to hang out with (usually me). -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-=-&nbsp; Boredom is an emotion. Instead, offer your presence. Relate to 
his feeling of boredom. Before long, a loving, snuggly chat will soon lead to 
something fun.-=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I guess I haven&#39;t&nbsp;really thought of boredom as an emotion and I like 
that idea.&nbsp; I have noticed that both of&nbsp;my kids,&nbsp;but especially 
my daughter (13), will sometimes come to me and say she&#39;s bored.&nbsp; She seems 
sort of stuck and dissatisfied.&nbsp;&nbsp;Many times we&#39;ll just talk for awhile 
and then she&#39;ll remember something that she had wanted to do and go off 
happily.&nbsp; Other times&nbsp;we will do something together, like go to the 
grocery&nbsp;store or&nbsp;work on decorating her room,&nbsp;and then she pops 
out of it and feels inspired again.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>-=-Perhaps your oldest son needs some more special attention from you. You 
have a 2 year old, so I&#39;m sure you&#39;re busy with that child, but can you find a 
way to spend more one on one time with your oldest?-=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have found that special attention can&nbsp;sometimes&nbsp;be&nbsp;as 
simple and fast as a loving look, a long hug, rubbing a head or back.&nbsp; Just 
taking a&nbsp;moment to notice each child and send them little loving looks, 
gestures, words goes a long way.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>One special thing that has developed between my son and I is the bond we 
share in caring for our animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Currently we&nbsp;have dogs, cats, 
goats, chickens and ducks.&nbsp; One day, while Ben was in this healing period 
and&nbsp;toward the beginning of our journey with farm animals, -&nbsp;(which, 
I&#39;d say both of my kids are still - 3 years later -&nbsp;healing from 
their&nbsp;years of being sent to school and being over socialized/under 
supported with peers&nbsp;outside of school. On top of&nbsp;having parents who 
lacked skills in fully supporting them) - one of our sweet, shy little ducks 
started limping.&nbsp; I examined her and saw that she had a cut between her leg 
and her body.&nbsp; I wanted to spray some&nbsp;medicine on it but I couldn&#39;t 
hold her and spray it at the same time.&nbsp; I went in the house and asked the 
kids if one of them would help.&nbsp; Jade said &quot;eww&quot; and Ben said &quot;sure&quot;.&nbsp; 
He came out there with me twice a day for about a week, never a complaint, and 
sprayed that medicine on the little duck&#39;s body.&nbsp; As he did this task I 
could see and feel a sense of gentleness &amp; protectiveness rise in him.&nbsp; 
Also a sense of pride and confidence in himself that he was able to help both 
his mom and this duck in a meaningful way.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>That&nbsp;precious kid&nbsp;has become&nbsp;a huge help to me!&nbsp; He 
enjoys it and I see him swell with pride and this sense of feeling his own power 
and ability to be helpful, do good.&nbsp; Protect innocence.&nbsp; He is a 
steady, clear thinking assistant and I am so proud of him.&nbsp;&nbsp;And 
grateful for his help!!&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Recently we have been rehoming some of our young goats from last spring in 
an effort to make room for the next round of babies (we have a few dairy goats 
and they need to breed each year in order to provide milk).&nbsp; I wanted to 
vaccinate them before sending them out into the world but I was not sure how to 
pull off this task.&nbsp; I asked Ben if he would mind helping me and he said 
&quot;Mind helping?&nbsp; I&#39;d LOVE to do that!&nbsp; Sounds fun!&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has 
been completely unplanned and very healing for him.&nbsp; For us.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The point of that story is that&nbsp;#1 - you never know where learning 
&amp; healing will come from.&nbsp; And&nbsp;#2 -&nbsp;right now it may seem 
like you are&nbsp;the one doing most of the giving to your family.&nbsp; But 
when you take the time to put love and patience in you will end up being on the 
receiving end of that love and patience.&nbsp; Kids are not like a slot machine 
where you put your money in and take your chances.&nbsp; What you put in is what 
you will get out. &lt;3</div>

<div>
<div>-=- This was an important piece for finding a peaceful balance in our 
home.&nbsp; -=-</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I sometimes&nbsp;think of that peaceful, joyful balance found in an 
unschooling home as being like Disneyland.&nbsp; If you decide you want to go to 
Disneyland you have to start where you are and head in that direction.&nbsp; 
Maybe you&#39;ve never seen Disneyland but you&#39;ve heard about it or seen the travel 
brochure and you&#39;ve decided you&#39;d like to take your family there.&nbsp; Previous 
unschoolers have left maps for you to follow, there are various routes of 
transportation.&nbsp; But you have to start where you are and begin moving 
toward your goal.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Maybe you&#39;ll see signs along the way that indicate that you are heading in 
the right direction but if you&#39;re busy and distracted it is easy to miss those 
little signs.&nbsp; But no matter where you&#39;re starting or what means of 
transportation you have, you&#39;ve got to keep moving toward Disneyland.&nbsp; If 
you drive toward Disneyland for awhile, get frustrated and lose faith that you 
will ever get there or doubt it&#39;s existence&nbsp;and retreat to old ways that is 
like turning your car around and driving back toward home.&nbsp; Then you decide 
to try again for awhile so you turn your car around and drive back toward 
Disneyland.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Every time you go back to old ways or veer off into hurtful habits it&#39;s 
like getting lost in a residential neighborhood or a mall parking lot.&nbsp; 
Like heading for the highway and ending up in a parking garage.&nbsp; But if you 
stay the course, trust the map, you can get there.&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&nbsp;drive 
straight for Disneyland and try avoid detours you will get there much 
faster.&nbsp; The trip will also be easier if you pack&nbsp;yummy snacks and fun 
games!&nbsp; Look for the joy, laughter and learning&nbsp;along the 
journey.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Now I feel like every day with my family is better than Disneyland.&nbsp; 
The best part is that now that&nbsp;we&#39;re here&nbsp;we don&#39;t have to 
turn&nbsp;our car around and go back home.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re already home 
and&nbsp;we can take&nbsp;our Disneyland with&nbsp;us where ever&nbsp;we 
go!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2459708">-=- I sometimes think of that peaceful, joyful balance found in an unschooling home as being like Disneyland. -=-<br/>
 <br/>
She clarified:  -=-Found in SOME unschooling homes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Cass’s new Disneyland analogy!  (Or new to this group discussion anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
I have this to say about that:<br/>
Unschooling is not as expensive as Disneyland and not as tiring, and you can drink water from the tap instead of $3 a bottle or some such<br/>
<br/>
Otherwise, it’s a pretty great analogy, especialy about getting lost in parking lots and neighborhoods. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I liked -=-  If you drive toward Disneyland for awhile, get frustrated and lose faith that you will ever get there or doubt its existence and retreat to old ways that is like turning your car around and driving back toward home. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Most people never go to Disneyland.  Some never wanted to.  Some live on continents without one, some go to Disney World or Lego Land.  That’s not the point, though. :-)<br/>
<br/>
IF people DO want something (a peaceful family) and they doubt the existence of such a thing, I have a few things they might want to look at, in secret, in private:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/feedback">http://sandradodd.com/feedback</a><br/>
The lefthand column has a dozen new reports I’ve collected in the past week.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gettingit">http://sandradodd.com/gettingit</a><br/>
People said they thought they were unschooling, but they reached another, better level that they hadn’t expected.<br/>
<br/>
And if that’s not enough to persuade you the reader, here’s a page about how unschooling changes people:<br/>

<br/>
And for the more advanced unschoolers:<br/>

<br/>
But mostly, do what Cass suggested.  Approach it as if you’re going somewhere, and don’t keep turning back around and going home. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834941819">Thank you for all your insightful responses. I had to take a few days to really read/listen and process them but now I see the light! The trouble was with me. I had fallen into a habit of getting things done and parenting from the sidelines while they seemed engaged in an activity rather than being WITH them. &nbsp;I also was focusing too much on asking why he did X rather than understanding where he was coming from. I&#39;m sure he did feel as if I was taking the younger kids side as he told me how they were annoying him yet all I focused on was pointing out how much more (to my perspective) he was annoying them. My expectations were off too. Just because he is older or &quot;should know better&quot; doesn&#39;t give him self control or the skills to deal with his frustrations. &nbsp;<div>Over the last few days I have done better at being WITH them, playing with them (encouraging physical activity rather than telling them to calm down and be quieter cause it gets a bit loud for me). Being an active participant makes it easier to intervene at an early stage and when that isn&#39;t working well &nbsp;one of them will come with me which also gives them some 1 on 1 time which has historically been in short supply. &nbsp;Things have turned around &nbsp;already and that feeling I had of missing something has gone away. Thank you! Thank you!&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1834941819ygroups-quoted"><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1834941819ygrps-yiv-116881205"><div><div>&nbsp;</div></div></div></div><style></style></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1385004051">I’m glad things are going well.  Here’s another step toward peace and prosperity for you:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Being an active participant makes it easier to intervene at an early stage-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don’t think of it as “intervening.’<br/>
You’re helping them get along.  You should be doing that before there’s anything to “intervene” about!<br/>
<br/>
Setting up the room, choosing a movie, making sure they’ve eaten—all of that helps with peace and harmony.<br/>
<br/>
If you think or speak a negative word, try to rephrase (in your thoughts) to something more positive, and the next time you might be a step closer to being relaxed and to feeling confident and competent being a partner to each of your children.<br/>
