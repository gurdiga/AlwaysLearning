<div id="ygrps-yiv-349869180">James [3]...you gotta love this boy.  He&#39;s funny as all heck.  I love<br/>
him and his enormous personality.  And yet there are moments I&#39;d like<br/>
to throttle his preciousness.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m struggling a bit.  We were at a restaurant last night when James<br/>
started saying &quot;f****er&quot;.  Not out of anger but simply with a smirk on<br/>
his face and clearly to get our attention.  Though I felt like we were<br/>
giving him a lot of focus and attention previous to the language.<br/>
<br/>
How do you approach things like this?  He does know swearing is not<br/>
ok.   We&#39;ve talked about how words bother other people. I&#39;m trying to<br/>
approach this with him both respectfully and in way that he can<br/>
understand at 3, that swearing isn&#39;t cool or even harsh words like<br/>
meanie, stupid, etc.  Do I just keep working at my ability to not pay<br/>
value to them?  Is there something that worked for anyone in the<br/>
group?  Is it a age thing?<br/>

are different needs.  This helps me to better focus how to<br/>

by asking him if he&#39;d rather get takeout or eat there.<br/>

<br/>
Another way to give a three year old power is to let him choose the  <br/>
table, and choose where people sit, or make the conversation more  <br/>
about him.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday there was a chat on being with children.   There&#39;s a  <br/>
transcript up here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chats/being">http://sandradodd.com/chats/being</a><br/>
<br/>
But we didn&#39;t talk about being with a child in a group, and sometimes  <br/>
focussing on the one who seems the most impatient or needy can make  <br/>
everyone&#39;s time more fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1101346050"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Is it a age thing? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes in a manner of thinking.  More accurately I would say it&#39;s a development<br/>
thing.  It&#39;s an important part of their development.<br/>
<br/>
It also pushes our own assumptions about language.  Or it did mine.  It<br/>
helped me to see it (somewhat) as colorful language and pithy sounds for<br/>
effect.  That&#39;s what cussing really is.  We could say other words that have<br/>
the same effect ... (*Frack*) or (Oh Bean Pips! ... not very imaginative but<br/>
I just made that one up).<br/>
<br/>
Not to sidetrack you...  consider also the difference between cussing (f**k)<br/>
and swearing (as G*d is my witness!).  There was a thread not too long ago<br/>
(a couple months I think) which was very helpful to me in thinking through<br/>
this whole thing.  I think it was on this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-963811843">LOL - really, seriously, I would have been cracking up over it. I might, <br/>
if there were people at other tables who were being disturbed by it, <br/>
gather him up (happily) and use an excuse to take him outdoors for a few <br/>
minutes. But, really, c&#39;mon - you can&#39;t see the humor in it?<br/>
<br/>
Respond to the reality - not to some voice in your head that says kids <br/>
should not say bad words. He was having fun with shocking you - not <br/>
understanding why it shocks you, but really it must be quite a thing for <br/>
a 3 year old to be able to get his mom and other adults all flustered by <br/>
just making certain sounds. I think it is funny - and he was doing it <br/>
himself and in his 3 year old mind it must have been hilarious. Remember <br/>
that 3 year olds LOVE to &quot;make things happen.&quot; They like toys where they <br/>
can do things and make things happen, too.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about swearing - if your family isn&#39;t big on using &quot;bad&quot; <br/>
words, he won&#39;t make them part of his everyday vocabulary.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to have a lot of emotion around this issue, though, so you <br/>
might dig within and think about why.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t swear almost at all - very very very rarely. It doesn&#39;t come <br/>
naturally to me. My parents didn&#39;t swear. My kids don&#39;t do it a lot - <br/>
the do it appropriately, with friends in certain circumstances, but not <br/>
around strangers or in venues that would be inappropriate. We never made <br/>
ANY kind of deal about it if they did. &quot;I&quot; personally find it cute when <br/>
little kids do it.<br/>
<br/>
But, still, respond to the real need being expressed, don&#39;t be <br/>
sidetracked by the means of expression.<br/>
<br/>
I was at someone&#39;s house and a little boy - under 5 - called another <br/>
little boy - same age - a &quot;dick.&quot; The other kid said it back. The mom <br/>
freaked out. She scared ME. I was giggling to myself and she made me <br/>
almost jump out of my chair. They were not even saying it meanly, it was <br/>
just obviously something the one kid had heard others say and was <br/>
repeating it very conversationally.<br/>
<br/>
Its okay - I still know that kid and he&#39;s 16 now and he knows when and <br/>
when not to call someone a dick.&lt;G&gt;<br/>

The difference between curses and insults and swearing.<br/>
Some people call them all &quot;bad words,&quot; but they&#39;re not all cussing and  <br/>
they&#39;re not all swearing.<br/>

my boys (ages 10 and 7) have 2 friends their ages who are not permitted to watch movies with language, because the mom has experienced her sons repeating the words in play and also using &quot;bad words&quot; to get under her skin.  i&#39;m talking pg-13 rated movies!<br/>
she aso believes in &quot;shielding&quot; them from &quot;horrific images&quot; because &quot;once they are seen, they cannot be removed from the child&#39;s memory.&quot;<br/>
with this level of the parent controlling what the child is exposed to,  i&#39;ve spent some  time (on several occasions) discussing and reminding with my boys what is and is not appropriate to say in front of their friends.  they value these friends immensely, and they understand if their friends repeat certain words in front of their mother, they will have fewer opportunities to spend time with each other.  i am cetain my kids would be seen as a threat to her childrens&#39; &quot;innocence.&quot;  <br/>
i have an unschooling friend who has expressed that maybe i shouldn&#39;t &quot;work so hard&quot; with that situation, but i don&#39;t feel i am imposing myself in any way on my children by helping them to understand the parameters this other family is willing to work within.  my kids make the decision whether THEY want to work so hard, and, for right now, they do.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When my kids started experimenting with cuss words, exactly for the reasons Pam was describing, my DH had the hardest time seeing any humor in it and so they kept at it (I mean it was pretty funny to watch my DH lose it when they would use a cuss word).  So my mom and I started making a game out of it which took the attention off DH&#39;s response and allowed him to regroup -- good Catholic school boy that he wasn&#39;t.  One of them would cuss, who knows what would bring it on, and then it would lead to some very silly name calling/cussing.  In the restaurant, it might have looked like my 3 year old saying &quot;F***&quot; (moment of silence -- because it would have shocked me in the moment), and then maybe I would say, &quot;oh yeh, well, Brocoli!&quot;  and we would all chime in trying to come up with crazier and crazier words.  This helped my DH embrace the humor, helped dissapate the discomfort created if we were in public, and changed the power of the word into something more lighthearted, after all it is just another collection of vowel and consonant sounds. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PS you have older kids so you are undoubtedly familiar with Captain Underpants, but I always thought those books were great therapy for any adults who needed to lighted up about cuss words and swearing.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Reminds me of the song &quot;Bulbous Bouffant&quot; which is a <br/>
favorite around here.  Many of us love to play with words.<br/>
<br/>
When one of my DDs was 4, she discovered and just<br/>
absolutely LOVED the &quot;F&quot; word.  And the way she would<br/>
use it was so context-appropriate.  Like, if I asked her,<br/>
&quot;How would you feel about washing the dishes with me?&quot;<br/>
she might respond, &quot;F--- that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I said, &quot;I notice you really like saying that word and<br/>
I am wondering why you like it so much.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She replied, &quot;It is a really powerful word.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It is, absolutely.&quot; I couldn&#39;t help but agree.  &quot;But I feel like<br/>
it loses a lot of its power if it is overused.&quot;  And then<br/>
the conversation turned in a different direction.<br/>
<br/>
By the next year, when she&#39;d hear a group of older kids talking <br/>
amongst themselves, a very expletive laced conversation, she <br/>
mentioned to me that they could be more imaginative in expressing <br/>
themselves.  &quot;Everybody knows those words.  Can&#39;t they think<br/>
of any others?&quot;<br/>

might/could happen if they make a particular choice.  I even might<br/>
relate a similar situation I&#39;ve encountered and how it turned out for<br/>
me.  I always tell them they have to do what feels right to them and<br/>

times they don&#39;t.  I respect that and allow them to make the choices<br/>

&gt; his face and clearly to get our attention.  Though I felt like we were<br/>
&gt; giving him a lot of focus and attention previous to the language.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How do you approach things like this?  He does know swearing is not<br/>
&gt; ok.   We&#39;ve talked about how words bother other people. I&#39;m trying to<br/>
&gt; approach this with him both respectfully and in way that he can<br/>
&gt; understand at 3, that swearing isn&#39;t cool or even harsh words like<br/>
&gt; meanie, stupid, etc.  Do I just keep working at my ability to not pay<br/>
&gt; value to them?  Is there something that worked for anyone in the<br/>
&gt; group?  Is it a age thing?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t like profanity, simply because it&#39;s mentally lazy. So when the<br/>
&quot;let&#39;s see what shocks and provokes!&quot; stage hit both my boys (because it<br/>
did), we discussed context and vocabulary. So an outburst of &quot;f***er!&quot; would<br/>
have been met by the question &quot;what&#39;s the context? Are you upset about<br/>
something? What are some other words you could use there? Wonder if that&#39;s<br/>
in the thesaurus? Let&#39;s go look it up!&quot; and so on. We play word games with<br/>
streams of opprobrium sometimes. Sometimes we&#39;d burst into the Schoolhouse<br/>
Rock song &quot;Interjections&quot; which was always great fun. Nothing distracts a<br/>
three year old like both their parents singing &quot;Innnnnnnnnnnterjections!<br/>
Show excitement! And emotion! They&#39;re generally set apart from a sentence by<br/>
an exclamation point, or by a comma when the feeeeeeeeling&#39;s not as<br/>
strroooooooooooong! oooooooooh!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Once they get older, explorations of classical insults (Shakespeare was a<br/>
total winner in the creative insult department) can yield some fabulous<br/>
vocabulary. Try saying those words in different languages, or explore the<br/>
fact that different cultures have different insults (english is obsessed<br/>
with sex and elimination, but other cultures talk about the bottom of your<br/>
foot or your thumbs or whatever... it&#39;s kind of fascinating...)<br/>
<br/>
Cartoon insults are also mines of creativity. Kestrel, who is about to turn<br/>
four, adopted &quot;Holy clam and cuttlefish!&quot; as his exclamation of choice. I<br/>
think it&#39;s from Lilo and Stitch, but I&#39;m not positive. And Kim Possible&#39;s<br/>
Dad says &quot;Good Garden Party!&quot; which just sends the boys into hysterics.<br/>
Waaaaaay more reaction, and attention, than a mere bit of profanity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I already said I don&#39;t use profanity but it isn&#39;t because I&#39;m not <br/>
mentally lazy. It is because it doesn&#39;t come naturally to me - my <br/>
parents didn&#39;t use it so I didn&#39;t internalize it as part of my regular <br/>
vocabulary.  But I don&#39;t see how it is more lazy than saying, &quot;How are <br/>
you?&quot; or &quot;Nice to meet you?&quot; or &quot;Thank you&quot; or lots of other rather <br/>
automatic kinds of responses.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard people give this reason before, but I think it is a reason <br/>
that doesn&#39;t really hold up, but seems like a good one, on the surface. <br/>
Seems like if it was just that it is &quot;lazy&quot; then there are lots of other <br/>
lazy speech habits that you&#39;d dislike, too. Seems like not wanting to <br/>
think more deeply about what bothers you about it.<br/>
<br/>
Seems like banging your thumb with a hammer isn&#39;t a time to worry about <br/>
using particularly creative language, anyway, but more appropriately a <br/>
time for a well-known common expletive.<br/>

Well I like using &quot;those&quot; words because they feel good when they rolo out my tongue ( in context usually)<br/>
One more thing that I am lazy about then...<br/>
&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
I don&#39;t make a big deal out of it. I do explain to my 6 year old that he may want to refrain from saying then in certain places and in front of certain people and why.<br/>

People say that, but it&#39;s not necessarily true.<br/>
It&#39;s pretty lazy to have a prescripted set of stock responses.<br/>
<br/>
My fourth grade teacher, Sally Gonzales, my favorite teacher of all  <br/>
time, said that when people write they use combinations of words that  <br/>
no one has ever used before.   I didn&#39;t think she could be right about  <br/>
that, but I do it every day.   Some people rarely do.  They say safe,  <br/>
easy, lazy things.   And some of them have rules against profanity,  <br/>
which further limits them.<br/>
<br/>
Creativity is neither proven nor disproven by vocabulary.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s different than the other automatics (like &quot;Nice to meet you&quot;)<br/>
because there isn&#39;t really a better way to say that or indicate the degree<br/>
or intensity of your feeling that doesn&#39;t also involve pretty standard<br/>
expression. But when the majority of a person&#39;s adjectives are &quot;f***ing&quot;,<br/>
it&#39;s lazy.<br/>
<br/>
My stepfather swears so much I don&#39;t think he even realizes he&#39;s doing it<br/>
any more. Meaningful descriptions have vanished from lack of use. It&#39;s not a<br/>
blue car, it&#39;s the &quot;f***ing car&quot;. He&#39;s not thoroughly surprised, he&#39;s<br/>
&quot;f***ing astonished&quot;. When he&#39;s searching for a noun, it&#39;s not &quot;that thing&quot;<br/>
it&#39;s &quot;some s***&quot;. And so on. All the depth and breadth of descriptive and<br/>
informative language choices have devolved into a handful of words that have<br/>
become both meaningless and powerless from overuse.<br/>
<br/>
My brother in law is the same way. The entire range of description of<br/>
emotion is translated by him as &quot;d***&quot;. Surprise is nearly always &quot;WTF?&quot; Any<br/>
female that disagrees with him or fails to do as he&#39;d do is a &quot;B****&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the reduction that I think of as lazy. Could a female person who was<br/>
mean to him be a b****? Sure. But she could be so many other things as well.<br/>
But that word has become verbal shorthand.<br/>
<br/>
I had a grandmother who excelled at strings of opprobrium. The woman had the<br/>
most amazing ability to string together creative insult. She&#39;d get a rhythm<br/>
going, and sound like a drumbeat. When she was angry, whomever she was angry<br/>
at knew it, and knew precisely what she was upset about. &quot;You a**hole&quot;<br/>
really doesn&#39;t give a lot of good information.<br/>
<br/>
Naturally, I&#39;ve gone the lazy route. Slamming my hand in the car door got a<br/>
one-syllable expletive, and no creativity.<br/>
<br/>

Not everyone has the gift of verbal gymnastics.   Some do.    <br/>
Appreciating those who do and hoping those who don&#39;t find things  <br/>
they&#39;re good at might be the way to go.<br/>
