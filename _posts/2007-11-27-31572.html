<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716205493">Anyone with curiosity and free time is invited to help me edit a page  <br/>
I&#39;m working on here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/world">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m combining two pages, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/local">http://sandradodd.com/local</a> and http:// <br/>
sandradodd.com/unschoolingotherwise<br/>
That second one is one of my oldest pages, and it doesn&#39;t make sense  <br/>
to have it separate from local U.S. listings anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Is Unschoolers of the Ozarks defunct or moved?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Are there other Canadian groups I should name, or are they all linked  <br/>
through what&#39;s there?<br/>
<br/>
And this:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-LDS unschooling is well represented on the web. The best and  <br/>
friendliest link-rich portals I found were &lt;A HREF=&quot;http:// <br/>
home.rmci.net/abell/&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;Amy Bell&#39;s page&lt;/A&gt; and a sort of  <br/>
online &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lds.about.com/religion/lds/library/conference/">http://lds.about.com/religion/lds/library/conference/</a> <br/>
blchildledlearning.htm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;conference&lt;/A&gt;.   &lt;p&gt;<br/>
There is an &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ldslearn&quot;">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ldslearn&quot;</a>  <br/>
target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;LDS discussion list&lt;/A&gt;:  &quot;LDSLearn is a forum for  <br/>
Latter-day Saint homelearners, natural learners, and others  <br/>
interested in alternative learning approaches.  All are welcome, but  <br/>
be aware that most members of this list lean toward child-led  <br/>
learning and attachment parenting.&quot;	-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Only the first link is still good.<br/>
Does anyone know of any LDS (Latter-Day Saints / Mormon) unschooling  <br/>
sites or lists that are current?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind discussing it on this list, or you can e-mail me on the  <br/>
side, either way.<br/>

===================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The help I&#39;m hoping for is more links, better links to those that are  <br/>
moved, and so forth.<br/>
<br/>
Updating, I should&#39;ve said, probably instead of editing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
