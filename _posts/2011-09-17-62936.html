<div id="ygrps-yiv-176337122">What about a garden shed type of shop? Ie. A garden shed you could cut a shop window in for him to dress and kit it out with shelves for his stock.... Do you have room? - it wouldn&#39;t need to be big. I know a really good seafood restaurant in Norfolk which started out in a garden shed. Be careful, business could grow! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
What kind of shop? A store? A workshop? What kind of bricks? The little red kind or concrete blocks? Ask him for details, if that&#39;s not too frustrating for him. Sometimes people (kids And adults) get half-ideas, inspiration without any real sense of the details.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t bog down too much wondering &quot;how are we going to do this?&quot; and don&#39;t let yourself get stressed over the chance that he&#39;s going to be disappointed. If he reeeaaaalllllly wants to do this and do it a certain way... probably he&#39;s going to end up disappointed. Constructing a real brick building isn&#39;t the sort of thing which happens on a 7yo&#39;s timetable. <br/>
<br/>
But maybe he just wants to play with the idea for awhile, as far as he can, so keep talking with him and tossing out ideas. Does it have to be a Brick shop? Wood is faster. A pre-fab metal building is faster still. It might help to look at different kinds of buildings and even different kinds of wall facings. You can have a faux brick exterior over wood or metal or... straw bales if you wanted ;)<br/>
<br/>
 If what he wants is to sell things - that kind of shop - you could  go to a farmers market or craft show and see what people use for booths. A little awning and a table set up on the sidewalk is a lovely &quot;shop&quot; which can be taken down at the end of the day. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
So, er, construction experience, here - for an actual building you start with the foundation, which can be the most tedious part of the whole process, but it could be fun, too. Do you need a patio? Having a concrete slab poured can be fascinating for kids, and then you can build something on top of it later if you want. But in the time it takes to build the forms, get it poured and wait for the concrete to cure your guy could lose interest, too, or get really disappointed with the amount of time it&#39;s taking. He doesn&#39;t want a concrete slab, after all, he wants a shop! and he&#39;s going to be running up against some real life limits in that sense. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763540628">This is such a helpful reminder! I have a daughter that is full of ideas, all of the time...and they are involved, intricate, &quot;real-world&quot; interests vs. the watered-down versions that sometimes cater to kids. If I am being honest, I admit to being overwhelmed fairly regularly. As an option to communicating this feeling to my daughter, I really like the idea of &quot;exploring what is possible&quot; together, regardless of the project that is wished for...I imagine that sometimes she would follow through with tenacity...and sometimes she may turn to something else when she sees the level of involvement required (if, in fact, she is not interested in this level of involvement)...but that either way, support is offered for these  ideas vs. a kid simply seeing her mom in an overwhelmed state...or   a mom who is attempting to limit her!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2005849446">When my uncle was 14 he wanted to open up a candy store.  His Mom (my grandmother) let him use the garage. That&#39;s was over 45 years ago.  He just closed it down two years ago.  Times have changed but maybe it&#39;s something you can suggest if you have a garage ?<br/>
<br/>
The question I had was is it a shop that he wants or is it to build or both?  Maybe the shop is just a destination but what he is really interested in is the design and building up.  It may be out of his reach right now ( permits etc ) but maybe a virtual store?  Maybe he could set up a shop in eBay or Etsy and sell stuff or maybe he could design and build a virtual place in Minecraft.  <br/>

<br/>
It might be worth exploring the idea that nobody ever builds a skyscraper on his own, either.  <br/>
<br/>
Are there current kids&#39; books or videos or websites about what it takes to create a skyscraper (or a house or whatever)?  Site analysis, surveying, proposal, financing, architectural plans, revisions, excavation, foundations, plumbing, and I get lost in there, but walls (steel frame?  stone?  windows?  floors and elevators, stairs, safety/escape/fire retardant, heating, cooling, electrical contracting to figure out all the controls for all that, natural gas, or whatever else besides electricity.  <br/>
<br/>
In the 1960&#39;s, my uncle worked on the electrical contract for the Holly Sugar Building in Colorado Springs.  Before it opened, he took us up and showed us some of what they had designed and installed--dimmers in conference rooms (new technology at the time) and how the fixtures and features were nicer the higher in the building we went. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe exploring buildings, shops, brick construction either online or out in the world with a camera would be interesting, too.<br/>

<br/>
Visit a lumber yard and ask to pick through their scrap wood pile.  Stock up on nails, screws, hinges, wheels, whatever.  Let him pick some stuff out at the hardware store.  Get a little tool box for him and stock it with safe but useable tools.<br/>
<br/>
There is a great little wood working kit with lathe, saw, drill and sander for kids:<br/>

<br/>
Visit a shoe store and ask for their empty shoe boxes.  They are great for building walls, fun to knock down!<br/>
<br/>
Build structures with fallen branches.  We have built toad houses, log cabins, and many other structures in our back yard using just some branches, nails and mud.  <br/>

And, of course, Lego and Minecraft are great building tools as well.</div>

That may be a bit pricey(around $800 and up i think) but it would be a building of sorts and not so difficult that it would be impossible, and they usually don&#39;t need a permit if they are under a certain size in most areas.<br/>

A kid wants to build a shop (for what?  Not specified) with bricks (specified) and people are wildly brainstorming.   <br/>
<br/>
The was sent, and I&#39;m only posting the middle part:  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Not sure where you are located but my husband has a sawmill if you wanted to pursue the idea of visiting a lumber yard.  Big lumber yards may not be too kid friendly - but we are just a small operation working out of our home (our 10 year old daughter is unschooled).  My husband built his woodshop mainly out of the resources we had to hand:  wood and stones from the creek.  He even made dowels to hold the floor down instead of opting for extortionate imported nails.  You are very welcome to visit.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
The first poster is in the UK.  Other list members are all over Canada and the U.S., Europe, New Zealand, Australia and India.   The post above had a phone number.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to be giving phone numbers to thousands of people, really.   But the description of the sawmill and the shop does sound cool.   And if it had been a UK phone number, I would&#39;ve sent it on the side to Michelle whose boy has the desire.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131457724">Maybe he would be interested in working with the building kits if he learned that some architects build miniature models of their buildings before they build full size versions. Perhaps you could find these scale models somewhere in your city and visit with your son - at a local university, or architecture office, or maybe you even have a tourist attraction close by like this one:<br/>

When I was a child, I volunteered with my parents on a community project where people were working together to build a structure. If you could find something like this in your area, maybe they would let him volunteer with you.<br/>
<br/>
We recently built a foundation for a garden shed using sand and tiles. Both those materials can be reused for other projects if he lost interest. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a children&#39;s book about a creative child architect that he might like:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619771879">Big ideas are great and this one could go everywhere and occupy quite a bit of time, if he continues to purpue it.  What type of bricks?  From where in the world?  What type of products?  Offer geometric information so he can work on that.  Geometer&#39;s sketchpad has a free downloadable version.  Also, help him find your local ordinances on buildings; some areas require permits for constructing anything that can&#39;t be moved.  As far as business end of things, point out accounting information, maybe talking to small business owners about inventory, business plan, and product ideas.  It&#39;s a testament to the beauty of unschooling that he is willing to have such big ideas at any age, and especially at an age that&#39;s traditionally only supposed to be interested in maybe Erector sets.<br/>
<br/>
(I could inappropriate to chime in here, especially since my lifelong learners aged 14 months and 3 years and I&#39;m officially new to unschooling and still reading through Sandra&#39;s blog and several others.  That said, there is so much to be covered here and I felt inspired to respond because my 3 year old thinks like this.  I think we can all learn more from how this turns out.)<br/>

&gt; hi all,<br/>
&gt; my son, 7,  woke up this morning and announced he wants to build a shop.  with real bricks.  i said we would look into this.  i offered to call local builders and see if we could go and watch them and maybe help a bit (health and safety allowing).  this is not what he wants. i looked up building kits with the small, realistic bricks and mortar.  this is not what he wants.  he wants to build a shop.  i showed him the instructions for building a wall and explained simply what we would need to do and said we could start with a wall.  he still wants to build the shop. a shop to fit people in like a real shop  anymore ideas out there please? .<br/>
