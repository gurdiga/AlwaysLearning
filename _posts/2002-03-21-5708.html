<div id="ygrps-yiv-931873833">I have wanted to see Apollo 13 for a while and finally I listened to what<br/>
many of your unschoolers have said since I joined this list; do something<br/>
you want to do and see what happens.... Well Max was down for a nap and I<br/>
told Zak the movie I was going to watch and what it was about.  He sat with<br/>
me for about 1 1/2 hour of the movie (that much took me nearly 3 hours to<br/>
watch as I had to stop and start it every few minutes to answer<br/>
questions)... I always thought I was a mind of useless information... I know<br/>
a little about a lot of different things...  I didn&#39;t know I knew so much<br/>
about the space mission, considering I would have been 11 at the time and<br/>
lived in England, and I don&#39;t think I even knew anything about America<br/>
accept that it was the place we sent felons too (or was that Austrailia)...<br/>
(You can tell how much I listened in school).... Anyway I digress....  It<br/>
was wonderful to sit with my first born and answer his questions as he fired<br/>
them at me one after the other....  After he&#39;d finished watching he built a<br/>
spaceship in the living room, using jelly beans for the controls (which of<br/>
course he eventually ate)... He then branched out and built a more elaborate<br/>
one in the garden and we all had to come and ride on the space ship.  It<br/>
happened to be a very cold day in Tucson (if that&#39;s possible) and so he gave<br/>
us blankets to keep up warm and toasty...  I was going to suggest a hot<br/>
toddy but decided 4pm was probably not the time for that (LOL.... just a<br/>
joke we don&#39;t drink)....  We talked about going to different planets and who<br/>
had walked on the moon, about another movie Mission to Mars that Zak caught<br/>
a glimse of, how many planets, their astrological significance and their<br/>
astronomy significance...<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful experience it was and all because I decided to do something<br/>
that I&#39;m interested in....<br/>

watch it!  (Sandra Dodd)<br/>

Both! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like you had a blast!<br/>
<br/>
You  never know about movies.  They don&#39;t have to be &quot;educational&quot; or weighty <br/>
or &quot;classical.&quot;  We&#39;ve gotten some great insights and connections from the <br/>
silliest and goofiest stuff.  One non-goofy example though:<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was into a kind of Shakespeare phase a couple of years ago, and I <br/>
rented the Romeo+Juliet with the guns.  I watched some with him, and I was <br/>
folding laundry and this and that, in and out.  When it was in Act III or <br/>
other mid-parts, I suggested maybe he should watch the next another day.   <br/>
Partly I was getting antsy because I&#39;d seen it already, and partly I was <br/>
afraid it was too long a stretch for him, and didn&#39;t want him to feel <br/>
obligated.  He said &quot;No, it&#39;s good.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
And he watched it to the end, with rapt attention.  And we discussed it off <br/>
and on in little spurts for the next couple of days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is on my top 5 movies list.  We saw it in the theater with dh, and I<br/>
loved it so much I took just me and the kids to a matinee a few days later<br/>
(dh was jealous!).  Owned the CD of the soundtrack, then the video, then the<br/>
DVD  :-)  If Ron Howard wins the Oscar for &quot;A Beautiful Mind,&quot; it will be<br/>
justice -- he should have won for &quot;Apollo 13.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I should add, I guess, that I grew up a &quot;space geek&quot;; my dad was an<br/>
aerospace engineer.  Dh and I even went to Edwards AFB to witness the first<br/>
nighttime space shuttle landing.  The technogeeks in Mission Control<br/>
reminded me of my dad  :-)))<br/>
