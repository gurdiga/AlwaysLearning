<div id="ygrps-yiv-548989440"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;It seems to me that you had to talk him into it a<br/>
&gt;little.  Could you have just dropped it altogether<br/>
&gt;at some point in the conversation and would he have <br/>
&gt;been okay with that?  Is this something he could<br/>
&gt;easily forget before you go to the library? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, I must not have done a good job at explaining<br/>
this.  I don&#39;t actually want him to do it.  I was<br/>
hesitant to mention it to him actually.  After<br/>
discussing it here and with my husband I decided to go<br/>
the route of honesty and let him make his own choice<br/>
about whether he wanted to do it, regardless of my own<br/>
judgements about such schoolastically manipulative<br/>
rewards programs.  <br/>
<br/>
So I told him about it, as briefly and concisely as I<br/>
could.  Something like this: &quot;The library is doing<br/>
this reading program where you keep track of how much<br/>
time you read/are read to/look at books and then you<br/>
get to pick prizes from their box after each 4 hours<br/>
of reading.  You can do it if you want, or not.&quot;  I<br/>
keep reminding him that he doesn&#39;t have to keep doing<br/>
it, that he can stop whenever he wants, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I would have left it at that, but he kept hounding me<br/>
for several days &quot;Tell me again how it works.&quot;  &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t understand, explain it again.&quot;  &quot;What are the<br/>
prizes like?&quot;  &quot;I still don&#39;t understand, what do you<br/>
mean keep track of your reading?  What do mean, mark<br/>
it in a booklet?&quot;  So that&#39;s why I had to repeatedly<br/>
explain it to him.<br/>
<br/>
I finally showed him using the booklet at the library<br/>
as a visual aid and he seemed to be satisfied after<br/>
that.  He carefully collected his booklet and the<br/>
bookmark they gave him, carries it around with him,<br/>
constantly asks if we can mark out time and asks if<br/>
it&#39;s been enough time to mark another 1/2 hour square.<br/>
 He even marks his brother Alex&#39;s book for him, since<br/>
Alex doesn&#39;t care much himself. <br/>
<br/>
He woke up this morning literally saying &quot;I feel like<br/>
singing!  La La La!&quot; and was hopping around and giving<br/>
spontaneous kisses and hugs to everyone, which is a<br/>
big deal for him.  He packed everything and everyone<br/>
eagerly in the car to go to the library this morning<br/>
to collect on his prize, as he had enough reading<br/>
since yesterday afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
The prizes this week were stamps from various<br/>
countries and I could tell he was disappointed, but<br/>
thankfully he didn&#39;t say anything.  I was very<br/>
relieved.  He did ask the children&#39;s librarian to tell<br/>
him what the prizes were going to be for the next few<br/>
weeks.  When she listed that near the end of summer<br/>
they were going to do little toys his interest was<br/>
immediately caught.  I mentioned that he could just<br/>
save up his prize collection to come in when they had<br/>
the toys.  I&#39;m not sure he understood what I meant, he<br/>
looked confused but he nodded when I mentioned coming<br/>
in when they had the toys.<br/>
<br/>
Library visits, like trips to the store, museums, and<br/>
other events, are difficult.  We were in the library<br/>
all told for about 15 minutes and here&#39;s a recap of<br/>
it, part vent, part to help others understand what<br/>
it&#39;s like to live with a high funcitoning autistic<br/>
child.  Thomas has Asperger&#39;s syndrome, Oppositional<br/>
Defiance, Sensory Integration Dysfunction, Dyslexia,<br/>
and has various serious allergies.  We don&#39;t like<br/>
labels and are glad that keeping him home has helped<br/>
us avoid a lot of damage to his self esteem and myriad<br/>
other problems trying to fit into a world where he is<br/>
a square peg.  Knowing where to draw the line bewteen<br/>
my unschooling principles guiding me to back off and<br/>
not interfere where my son&#39;s needs often conflict with<br/>
this and require me to step in a manage him is a<br/>
constant struggle.<br/>
<br/>
I was not going to sit and read to them in the library<br/>
today, which can usually keep him focused and quiet<br/>
while we were there, because I was only going to be<br/>
there a few minutes and then we had to get the car<br/>
home for his dad to get to work.  I needed to use the<br/>
library computer for 10 minutes to look something up,<br/>
request a book in library loan and put a hold on<br/>
another book (some of the book suggestions given to me<br/>
here this week.)  I would have done it from home, but<br/>
the website was acting weird.  I do as much as I can<br/>
from home.  <br/>
<br/>
I repeatedly had to explain to Thomas what I was going<br/>
to do, where and for how long, telling him his library<br/>
acceptable options for while I was doing that, which<br/>
were to stay with me quietly, or to look at books or<br/>
do games and puzles or play quietly a few feet away<br/>
from me in the children&#39;s library area where he could<br/>
easily see me or come to me if he needed me.  He could<br/>
not focus enough to acknowledge my comments.  He ran<br/>
to get books he wanted while I was talking to him. <br/>
<br/>
After that he was running in circles between several<br/>
rooms with adjoining doors (children&#39;s library room,<br/>
empty conference room, main library area) and not<br/>
responding to or able to acknowledge my communication<br/>
with him about stopping or slowing down, even when I<br/>
physically stopped him or slowed him down as he ran<br/>
past the stand up computer work station where I was. <br/>
His younger brother Alex (7yrs), who often gets roped<br/>
into his games, I was able to corral and get to stay<br/>
by me willingly.  That didn&#39;t stop Thomas though and<br/>
soon he was getting several preschool kids in the<br/>
children&#39;s area riled up and rowdy as well.  <br/>
<br/>
Thomas was not able to make eye contact even when I<br/>
held his face with my hands blindering him on either<br/>
side.  His eyes were shooting everywhere but at me. <br/>
When I repeatedly asked him to acknowledge that he<br/>
must quiet down in the library and stop the running he<br/>
shouted in my face &quot;OK! OK!&quot; and immediately began<br/>
manically giggling and running again when I let him<br/>
go.  When I finally wrapped my arms around him,<br/>
recognizing his inability to calm himself, he let<br/>
himself lean so far and heavily that he fell over and<br/>
began to cry.  When I scooped him into my lap on the<br/>
floor, he was still pushing me away absently and began<br/>
giggling again and his eyes were rolling everywhere. <br/>
When I stood him up again he was immediately pulling<br/>
and leaning so far he was going to fall if I let him<br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
This took place all within the span of a few minutes<br/>
and I decided we needed to leave.  I closed out the<br/>
computer I was working on and went across to check out<br/>
Thomas&#39; books.  He climbed onto the step at the<br/>
counter for kids to use and started fingering the<br/>
inkpad and trying to lift the laser scanner wand off<br/>
the counter and asking if he could check out the books<br/>
with it himself and just talking and moving a million<br/>
miles a minute, as well as shoving his brother and<br/>
trying to occupy whatever space he was in each time he<br/>
moved out of Thomas&#39; way.  <br/>
<br/>
The librarian kindly offered Thomas a stamp and pad<br/>
and suggested he stamp his hand.  He was horrified at<br/>
this idea, but I turned over his reading program<br/>
booklet and suggested he stamp and blank back side of<br/>
it.  In the time it took her to check out his three<br/>
books while I filled out a very short book request<br/>
form (name, phone #, book title and author, check a<br/>
couple other boxes)  he had stamped his booklet 30<br/>
some times.<br/>
<br/>
Then of course he had a little ink on his hands and<br/>
was loudly complaining about that and shuddering.  I<br/>
took him to the restroom where he frantically scrubbed<br/>
his hand and 4 changes of liquid soap before being<br/>
satisfied that it was clean.  Alex meanwhile casually<br/>
browsed books near the restroom and commented to me on<br/>
the cover art.<br/>
<br/>
I hustled them into the car and collapsed frazzledly<br/>
into the driver&#39;s seat to breath for a minute before<br/>
heading home.  I was just thankful that all this was<br/>
happy manic behavior and there had been no explosions.<br/>
 This was not at all an unusual outing.  Thomas has<br/>
improved and progressed amazingly in the last 2 years<br/>
in many ways, and we used to avoid the library and<br/>
similar enclosed quiet places completely.  Now he can<br/>
stay there quietly for as long as I am reading to him,<br/>
but if I try to do anything for myself (like today)<br/>
it&#39;s another story.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting recent telltale exchange of<br/>
Thomas&#39; developmental and neurological differences was<br/>
that I began reading The Explosive Child by Ross W.<br/>
Greene (which by the way so far seems pricelessly<br/>
accurate of Thomas) yesterday.  Here is a link to the<br/>
cover art, which plays a part in this anecdote.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0060931027/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-6223567-7142404#readerpage">http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0060931027/ref=sib_dp_pt/002-6223567-7142404#readerpage</a><br/>
<br/>
Alex walked into the kitchen, glanced at the book on<br/>
the table and said &quot;Awww, poor little bomb kid.&quot;  This<br/>
seemed a cute but not noteworthy statement at first. <br/>
Later I realized the implications of it.  It meant<br/>
that Alex recognized that the art was representative<br/>
of both an abstract drawing of a child, AND an<br/>
abstract drawing of a bomb.  He also immediately<br/>
recognized that the child-bomb had a facial expression<br/>
and that that expression was a sad/unhappy one.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas, hearing Alex&#39; comment, came in and looked at<br/>
the book as well.  After a moment and with a blank<br/>
expression he said &quot;Why did Alex say that?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Me: &quot;Why did Alex say what?&quot;<br/>
T: &quot;Why did he say that was a kid?&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;His large head and smaller body indicate that he<br/>
is a child, as well as his playing with blocks.&quot;<br/>
T: &quot;Why did he say &#39;poor bomb kid&#39; like that?  Is it<br/>
because he has that fire thing in his head like a<br/>
bomb.&quot;<br/>
Me: &quot;Well the round red head and the fuse are what<br/>
made Alex say he was a bomb kid, yes.  I think Alex<br/>
displayed sympathy for him because of his facial<br/>
features, which show sadness.  The way his eyebrows<br/>
and mouth are drawn, the way his head is tilted and<br/>
the way his eyes are so small and seem almost teary<br/>
show his sadness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thomas looked again carefully for a minute, then went<br/>
about his business.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling these two so radically different children<br/>
is often a challenge, always an adventure and<br/>
definitely a learning experience for me every day.<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone else here unschooling a special needs child?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You may know of this already, but there&#39;s a Yahoo group devoted to<br/>
radically unschooling atypical and special needs child.  Explosive,<br/>
out -of-sync, sensory integration dysfunction, autism and autistic<br/>
spectrum disorders, highly sensitive, and more -- all of these are<br/>
terms that are regularly discussed on the Shine With Unschooling list.<br/>
 There are definitely moms who would be able to relate to your library<br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
The focus is on letting each child shine for who they are.  Anne Ohman<br/>
is the listowner, and she is wonderfully positive and, well,<br/>
wonderful. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
