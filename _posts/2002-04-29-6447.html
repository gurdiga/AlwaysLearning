<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464222358">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
Been following and did actually find my printout of Sandra&#39;s list.<br/>
<br/>
Here goes:<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers need to be:<br/>
Flexible<br/>
Creative<br/>
Energetic<br/>
Trusting<br/>
Knowledgeable and willing to learn more<br/>
Interested in how people learn<br/>
Happy in their lives - optimistic to peaceful<br/>
Aware of the joy in small things<br/>
<br/>
What will work against unschooling:<br/>
Cynicism<br/>
Impatience<br/>
Meanness<br/>
Jealousy (of your children&#39;s happiness, of your friend&#39;s reports of success)<br/>
Bad parental voices in your head<br/>
Violence, drug use, alcoholism (anything making the parents unsafe or <br/>
unreliable)<br/>
Priority given to spotless, quiet, orderly house<br/>
Agoraphobia on the part of the mom (if the kids are stuck home, they&#39;re very <br/>
limited)<br/>
Prejudice against modern media (computers, TV, videos)<br/>
Book-worship<br/>
Hope to find a full school curriculum buried in everyday life<br/>
Desire to TEACH<br/>
Desire to control the child&#39;s thoughts and beliefs<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Sandra, for this list.  It really makes clear the way we&#39;ve <br/>
chosen.<br/>
<br/>

PS  Sesame Street is on right now and Nelson Mandela is singing the ABC song <br/>
with the monsters.  My favorite part was on Friday when Robert DeNiro <br/>
demonstrated what a great actor he is by turning himself into a dog, a <br/>
cabbage and Elmo.  True imagination at work!</div>

<br/>
OOOH!!!!!<br/>
Sorry I missed that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really looking forward to getting to see &quot;Showtime,&quot; which has the <br/>
previews showing William Shatner&#39;s character saying, of Robert De Niro&#39;s <br/>
character, something like &quot;This guy can&#39;t act&quot; (or some such).  And THAT <br/>
reminds me of Wayne&#39;s World II, which I watch just for the scene in which <br/>
Mike Meyers turns to the director and says, while asking a gas-station <br/>
attendant for directions,  &quot;I know this is a small part, but couldn&#39;t we get <br/>
a better actor?&quot;  and the scene continues, with Charlton Heston doing the gas <br/>
station attendant, giving directions that make Mike Meyers get tears in his <br/>
eyes.  <br/>

I&#39;ve put up several new pages on my website, and have added a speaking <br/>
engagement, but I&#39;ve been increasingly self-conscious about saying even on a <br/>
list <br/>
like this &quot;I have a new page, go look!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve made a list for updates and announcements.  It will just be an <br/>
occasional e-mail with &quot;what&#39;s new&quot; for those who have sometimes gone to my <br/>
site and <br/>
seen what a rabbit-warren maze it is.<br/>
<br/>
You can send an e-mail to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sandradodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">sandradodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Or go to:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandradodd/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/sandradodd/</a><br/>
<br/>
Not all the new pages are things by me.  Lots of times they&#39;re great &quot;typical <br/>
days&quot; of other families, or something profoundly insightful someone has <br/>
posted at the unschooling.com forum, or this list or unschoolingdiscussion.   <br/>
Lots <br/>
of good stuff, but I don&#39;t want to jam this list with stuff that&#39;s only of <br/>
interest to a few.<br/>
***********************<br/>
But, Sandra...updates on your site are likely to be of interest to the vast <br/>
majority of people on this list. You could certainly start an announcement list <br/>
if you like, but I don&#39;t think announcing stuff here would be considered by <br/>
anyone (or most, anyway...that anyone could come back and bite me in the ass) a <br/>
disruption.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well maybe I wouldn&#39;t mind putting it on this list, but I hate to keep saying <br/>
on UnschoolingDiscussion and unschooling.com &quot;I put up another &#39;typical day&#39;!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone here who knows how to lift a background tile from a page?<br/>
There&#39;s a cool background that shows on my food page when I&#39;m in the editor, <br/>
but doesn&#39;t come up when I go to the page.   It was from a page designed to <br/>
let people use their art free, but for some reason it&#39;s not working.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone could advise me on the side, I&#39;d really appreciate it.<br/>

I&#39;ve always been glad to get the updates and have already joined the update list.<br/>
<br/>
I am curious though - what are you self conscious about?  I&#39;m envious of your pages, not to mention that I&#39;ve been helped by the info.  I&#39;m trying to learn some html, but my pages are all so far behind yours.<br/>

I feel like a loudmouth braggart sometimes and I don&#39;t want  to.<br/>
<br/>
I LIKE doing those pages and I learn a lot (and thanks for advice today,  <br/>
Joyce and Pam&#39;s-husband-Wally), but *I* even get tired of hearing me say &quot;lookie <br/>
my WEBPAGE!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But if I don&#39;t say &quot;Here are two new essays by me which I had lost, and two <br/>
new other-people pages,&quot; then it&#39;s hard for people who&#39;ve already been there to <br/>
come by them.<br/>
