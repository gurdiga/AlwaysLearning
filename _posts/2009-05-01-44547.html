<div id="ygrps-yiv-2102816418">A couple ideas on the sleep issue-<br/>
     Let me preface this with the fact that all my children go to sleep when they are ready to (nine of them ranging in age from 16 mos to almost 16). Rarely do they stay up too late, and they are always looking forward to bed time.It is a peaceful time where they usually drift off after reading or just thinking quietly. My seven year old still puts himself down for naps each day. This is not<br/>
to say that it has always been so smooth, but I have learned a couple of things along the way.<br/>
     First of all, I would suggest to a parent of a child who is not a big sleeper to really be active during the day! Take your daughter to the park, or on a long walk. Have her play chase with you and spend lots of time outdoors playing. I am sure you probably do many of these things already! My three year old spends so much time outside that usually at about 8:30 or 9:00 he will say, &quot;Mommy, I&#39;m ready for bed now...&quot; I kiss him goodnight, and that&#39;s it. But he is sooo tired from actively playing all day. Sleep comes much easier when you are tired!!<br/>
     Second of all, my experience with using TV as a sleeping aid has been negative. I think TV at that time of night stirs up children&#39;s brains and gets them reved up. I can&#39;t make that judgement<br/>
for you and your situation, but I think it is better to fall asleep to quiet-maybe soft music, or the sound of your voice singing to her. Those can be very special times. A good resource for nightly routines is a book called &quot;Seven Times The Sun,&quot; by Shea Darian. She suggests ideas to help children have a peaceful sleep.<br/>
    We have had some very crazy sleeping arrangements in our home, but the bottom line is for everyone to sleep!!At one point we had our five year old sleeping on a mattress on the floor of our room-we had one child in bed with us, and another one in the crib in our room! But everyone had a good night&#39;s sleep, and that&#39;s the bottom line! I get so crabby when I haven&#39;t had sleep, and I can&#39;t be a very nice mom when I am tired!! So think of helping your daughter finding a sleeping routine that works for your faily the same way you would plan any other major area in your home life(meals, outings, etc...) The trick is not to impose bed time; you want to make going to sleep feel as natural as going to the bathroom or eating a good meal. It&#39;s a reilef and a peaceful part of the day!<br/>
Hope this helps.-<br/>
