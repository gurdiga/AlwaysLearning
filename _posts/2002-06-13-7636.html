The Internet just makes it possible for them to find each other and <br/>
organize.  lol.<br/>

&gt;About the address and &#39;phone number.   I think everyone agrees for safety<br/>
&gt;reasons kids need to know these, but young unschoolers are always with a<br/>
&gt;parent.  At these ages, they probably can&#39;t even be at the public pool<br/>
&gt;without a parent, so from the parent&#39;s perspective, short of abduction,<br/>
&gt;these kids won&#39;t be in a situation where they need to find their way home<br/>
&gt;by themselves.   And let&#39;s face it, how many abducted kids get the chance<br/>
&gt;to &#39;phone home?  Knowing address and &#39;phone number can&#39;t keep kids safe<br/>
&gt;from bad guys.  Good guys would look it up for a kid.  This is one more<br/>
&gt;thing someone else says is important, and we all jump on.  When our kids<br/>
&gt;are out by themselves, then yes, it&#39;s good to know, but at young ages,<br/>
&gt;when they&#39;re always with a parent?   <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do a lot of travelling, just Will and I.  It has occurred to me at <br/>
certain times that he didn&#39;t know his own parent&#39;s full names, or our <br/>
phone number, or he knew it once and and we moved or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m thinking that when just the two of us are out hoboing around, <br/>
turning down the wrong street in Chicago or whatever, and I happened to <br/>
get my purse snatched or I get mugged and knocked unconscious and he&#39;s <br/>
there with me but I&#39;m incapacitated somehow...it would be very useful if <br/>
he knew all the pertinent information to get us help and help the <br/>
rescuers help us.  My name, Dad&#39;s name, his own full name (names are not <br/>
an issue now that he&#39;s 8), our phone number including area code, our <br/>
address, our city, what hotel we&#39;re staying in, the room number, Dad&#39;s <br/>
cell phone number, the name of the company he works for, his <br/>
grandparents names and the cities in which they live, yada, yada.  All <br/>
very useful information in that situation. And he knows most of it <br/>
without even having to be &quot;taught&quot;.  But like the kids quizzed by <br/>
grandma, he might not be so willing to fork over that information to a <br/>
rescuer, if it hasn&#39;t been specifically discussed about why he would <br/>
want to do so.<br/>
<br/>
So, occasionally we go over it.  It&#39;s good airplane or train <br/>
conversation, done casually and not worriedly.  We put phone numbers and <br/>
addresses to music, and that helps him remember.  <br/>
