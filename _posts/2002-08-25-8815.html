<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I would hesitate to &quot;make&quot; anyone do anything even if they asked me to,<br/>
&gt; not because I&#39;m devoted to being non coercive (you should see me trying<br/>
&gt; to get my mother out of Wal-mart)  but because I think if they wanted the<br/>
&gt; thing truly, they wouldn&#39;t need the poke. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Rox is here on this list --- she&#39;s asked me before to sort of &quot;nudge&quot; her to <br/>
practice music - I&#39;m not very good at such nudging, though, so I forget to <br/>
nudge and she forgets that she really wanted to practice more regularly. I <br/>
feel bad about that - I do think it is fair for a kid to ask her mom to push <br/>
her a little. I sometimes want my husband or my friends to push me a bit, <br/>
too.   Heck, I wouldn&#39;t like an aerobics instructor who stood up at the front <br/>
and said, &quot;Don&#39;t expect me to try to talk you into hard physical exercise, <br/>
you just do what you feel like doing right now.&quot; There is a place in our <br/>
lives for other people who give us a little shove here and there.<br/>
