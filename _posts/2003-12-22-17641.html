<div id="ygrps-yiv-2032060545">Hello,<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted in a long time sooo HI!  I have a question again <br/>
about reading and unschooling in general.  My four year old daughter <br/>
loves to do worksheets.  She will do like 20 of them in a row with my <br/>
help (I read the directions and explain to her what needs to be <br/>
done.)  The other day we made a book together. Very simple.  I read <br/>
it to her and then had her read it to me.  Then wrote the words down <br/>
and added different words to make a different sentence.  She was able <br/>
to read and recognize the changes.  My question is..  unschooling <br/>
to me is about helping my child to learn their way on their terms,  <br/>
BUT can teaching them through worksheets, phonics, or repetition ( <br/>
Chelsea likes this and we stop when she wants to) prevent them from <br/>
learning how to read or slow them down?  I remember in a book by John <br/>
Holt he talked about how teaching a child through the conventional <br/>
methods leads to a disinterest in learning, confusion, and lower self-<br/>
esteem.  <br/>
<br/>
Some one mentioned a book called `How to teach your kids to read in <br/>
100 lessons&#39;???? What is the title, the author and can you give me an <br/>
example of a &quot;lesson&quot; ?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>

schedule, and competition with other kids (with the unavoidable shaming for<br/>
failure, or boredom for success).  The workbooks are irrelevant.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>It sounds to me like your child is teaching herself to read; why bother with<br/>
someone else&#39;s method?<br/>
<br/>
This is an excerpt from an article I wrote many years ago (linked from<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site - thanks, Sandra!):<br/>
It&#39;s so tempting to think we can teach kids, but the fact is, we present,<br/>
and they learn. If she wasn&#39;t ready, she wouldn&#39;t have been interested and<br/>
she wouldn&#39;t have learned. Reading aloud is the start; demonstrating that<br/>
reading is normal and interesting by reading yourself is part of the<br/>
process, too. My own son, Alex &quot;broke the code&quot; for himself at about age 5,<br/>
by typing a caption from National Geographic on the computer; he opened a<br/>
word processing program, got a new document, chose a typeface and size, and<br/>
started copying this rather lengthy photo caption about sea stars. He was so<br/>
intent on what he was doing! He looked from the magazine, written in italics<br/>
and upper and lower case, to the keyboard to find the matching letter, to<br/>
the screen, where he saw the connection between the printed magazine&#39;s words<br/>
and the ones he was typing. You couldn&#39;t make a curriculum or a lesson or a<br/>
method out of that; it was his way, in his time. Not too much later, he was<br/>
reading aloud from Calvin and Hobbes into a tape recorder; his idea, not<br/>
mine! <br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
Keep providing the things that interest her.  My son wouldn&#39;t sit still for<br/>
phonics, but once he understood the connection between letters on the page<br/>
and what he heard, he could read any word already in his vocabulary.  He did<br/>
the same typing thing with the entire book, &quot;Ferdinand.&quot;  He got tired,<br/>
though, and had me finish it - then print it - in 40 point all caps.<br/>
Between the National Geographic and Ferdinand, he learned to read.  For<br/>
&quot;sounding out,&quot; Dr. Suess&#39;s made-up words and names can&#39;t be beat.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re &quot;getting it&quot; to me :-)))<br/>
<br/>
Nancy<br/>
<br/>
BTW, did you (the List You) know &quot;Suess&quot; should be pronounced &quot;Zoice&quot; (like<br/>
voice with a Z)?  Always Learning ;-)</div>

<br/>
Do you feel that you&#39;re teaching her?<br/>
<br/>
If you do, I think that could slow down your own understanding of natural <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
If what you&#39;re doing seems like fun for both of you whether she&#39;s learning or <br/>
not, then I don&#39;t think it can slow her down.  If it seems like work or <br/>
important teaching, it could.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-941160041">Thanks for the replies.  I do need to slow down.  I feel I am trying <br/>
to teach her.  Must be time for me to break out a John Holt book and <br/>
start reading.  I need to be reminded about what natural learning is <br/>
and so forth....<br/>
