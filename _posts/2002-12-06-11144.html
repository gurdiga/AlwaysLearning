Ivan Illich died this week, at the age of 74. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.austin360.com/aas/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V8504.AP-">http://www.austin360.com/aas/news/ap/ap_story.html/Intl/AP.V8504.AP-</a><br/>

<br/>
Illich was involved in early education reform, author of The<br/>
Deschooling Society that influenced the thinking of John Holt, John <br/>
Taylor Gatto and many others, and had some thought provoking ideas <br/>
about health care and other social issues.<br/>
<br/>
Ivan Illich on Schools:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Many students, especially those who are poor, intuitively know what <br/>
the schools do for them. They school them to confuse process and <br/>
substance. Once these become blurred, a new logic is assumed: the <br/>
more treatment there is, the better are the results; or, escalation <br/>
leads to success. The pupil is thereby &quot;schooled&quot; to confuse teaching <br/>
with learning, grade advancement with education, a diploma with <br/>
competence, and fluency with the ability to say something new. His <br/>
imagination is &quot;schooled&quot; to accept service in place of value. <br/>
Medical treatment is mistaken for health care, social work for the <br/>
improvement of community life, police protection for safety, military <br/>
poise for national security, the rat race for productive work. <br/>
Health, learning, dignity, independence, and creative endeavour are <br/>
defined as little more than the performance of the institutions which <br/>
claim to serve these ends, and their improvement is made to depend on <br/>
allocating more resources to the management of hospitals, schools, <br/>
and other agencies in question.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137786408">So Sad.  Before I even knew of home education, John Holt and GWS,  I <br/>
read The Deschooling Society (life way before children).  I feel I am <br/>
mourning a friend.  He touched people all over the world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-699442681">Wow this is spooky. Just this morning I was reading A Gentle Birth and<br/>
there was a reference to Illich that I hadn&#39;t heard of (he wrote a<br/>
medical/birth book). I stuck the book on the computer meaning to search for<br/>
the book later today and now this email!<br/>
<br/>
His was one of the first books along with Holts that I read years ago on<br/>
this quest.<br/>
