&lt;&lt; Maybe we are just very compatible when it comes to<br/>
our belief systems about the kids and that doesn&#39;t seem to be such a bad<br/>
thing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
True, but it&#39;s not a help to someone whose husband isn&#39;t as compatible to say <br/>
&quot;Just do what we do.&quot;  (I know, it&#39;s easy for me too--my husband and I have <br/>
been together for 24 years, and he trusts me in ways that newer couples would <br/>
have a hard time getting to.) <br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s try to avoid this here:  -=-As usual what I said was twisted and <br/>
turned....-=-<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s avoid the twisting and turning AND the blanket &quot;as usual&quot; kinds of <br/>
statements if possible.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;sorry don&#39;t know who wrote it, I respond to e-mails and don&#39;t<br/>
usually look at who wrote it&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do this too, and I respond to the ideas and what they trigger in me, not <br/>
always to specific questions, limited to JUST what the poster said.  So for <br/>
me, the philosophical exchange is more important than the factual exchange.<br/>
<br/>
If because of the way I read and post I&#39;m missing a pattern of one poster <br/>
repeatedly misinterpretting, someone should let me know privately on the side <br/>
and I&#39;ll pay better attention.<br/>
<br/>
This medium works best when it works like a think-tank and brainstorm, I <br/>
think, than when it&#39;s expected to be simply question and answer or &quot;personal <br/>
support.&quot;  If ideas and experiences and opinions (about the theories and <br/>
practices, not about the people themselves) are swirling, we can pick up <br/>
patterns and ideas we can use without regard to which people contributed <br/>
them.  <br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Be good and let&#39;s keep this list sweet and peaceful.  That is not directed to <br/>
any one person at all, so don&#39;t anybody say &quot;She singled me out and told me <br/>
to be good!!&quot; because if you do, then I&#39;m going to say &quot;I wasn&#39;t talking <br/>
about you then, but I am now!&quot;<br/>
