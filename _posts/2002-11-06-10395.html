&lt;&lt; Yeah but that&#39;s because 100 miles in the UK can take 5 hours if they are<br/>
doing those damned road works! Everytime I hit the M-1  &gt;&gt;<br/>

When we were driving from York to London, it was stressful.  Seemed others <br/>
were stressed, and rushing, and stopping and starting.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe, for me, it&#39;s just that they were all driving on the wrong side of the <br/>
road and every truck seemed like imminent death.   Then we stopped at a <br/>
restaurant, somewhere around Lincoln or south of there? and then I discovered <br/>
clotted cream, having missed it somehow before.  Then I wanted to stay <br/>
another week and eat clotted cream.   I&#39;ve found they sell little glass jars <br/>
of it at the health food store three blocks from my house.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in England the first time I was young and alone and homesick, and <br/>
was downtown London, walking around alone, and I went to the Twinings Tea <br/>
shop (VERY small shop), and there was a little alley to the left of there, <br/>
toward Picadilly Square, I think.  There was an Indian wedding in the <br/>
neighborhood, and LOTS of couple went by with the women all in gold-thread <br/>
saris.  And then I turned and saw a tiny travel agency.  The entire business <br/>
was probably no bigger than one of my childrens&#39; bedrooms.   But the window <br/>
by the front door was ENTIRELY taken up with a poster of the Grand Canyon.  <br/>
No words, just the photo.  At least six feet high, from about my knee level <br/>
up.  As wide as the reach of my arms.  And I stayed still in front of that.<br/>
<br/>
I was 24 and had lived  all my life in Texas and in New Mexico.  I was at the <br/>
Grand Canyon when I was two.  There are photographs.  But not since.  And it <br/>
didnt&#39; matter.  MUCH of New Mexico is that big, that awesome, that quiet.<br/>
<br/>
But I stood in front of that poster and KNEW, deeper than my gut, why that <br/>
was so wonderful to people who had always been in England, where houses are <br/>
small, cars are small, roads are small, shops are small, things are busy and <br/>
tended.  Back yard &quot;gardens&quot; are gorgeous lawns surrounded by wonderful <br/>
flowers, put in artfully, reproducing themselves heartily year after year.  <br/>
Most of what is seen is touched and tended by man.  And what isn&#39;t has a <br/>
human history.  Sherwood Forest.  Lincoln Forest.   Even a kid from New <br/>
Mexico can know tales of life and death in those places.  Some fields were <br/>
cleared a thousand years ago, and copses of trees stand like little islands <br/>
in some of the larger ones.  Maybe those trees have never been cleared, ever. <br/>
 And exotic (to me) birds, and hedgehogs, and foxes might live in there.  but <br/>
the whole little tree-island might not be bigger than an American house and <br/>
yard, or a little shopping center we&#39;re so used to.  And it is surrounded by <br/>
man.<br/>
<br/>
But the Grand Canyon stretches for hundreds of untended, un-looked at miles <br/>
on either side of the visitor&#39;s centers.  <br/>
<br/>
It would be interesing to overlay a same-scale map of the grand canyon on <br/>
England.<br/>
