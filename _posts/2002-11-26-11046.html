<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778578858"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I don&#39;t know what it is, but whenever I see an<br/>
&gt;interracial couple (sometimes I dont&#39; even notice,<br/>
&gt;but when I do--) it makes me smile.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am the same way, but I think I know &quot;what it is.&quot; <br/>
It&#39;s a combination of things.  One is that I grew up<br/>
in a very diverse and integrated area and it reminds<br/>
me of my childhood home.  The other thing is that,<br/>
when I see an interracial couple I feel like I am<br/>
watching the most real and meaningful progress of<br/>
tolerance.  They have to put up with a lot of crap and<br/>
beat a lot of odds to be together, and they are<br/>
expanding the tolerance of their friends and families,<br/>
and people around them, just by being who they are. <br/>
They are a visual indication of our culture&#39;s<br/>
tolerance level.<br/>
