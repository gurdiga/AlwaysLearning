What are some of your favorite books to jumpstart homeschooling?  I liked that somebody stated to find books on parenting, rather than &quot;how to school&quot;.  I want to spend time this summer (hopefully!) in some good, inspiring books.

What is a good plan for a day for a family just starting to unschool?  I have been trying to just de-brief, relax, look for signals from the kids of what their direction of interest might be, etc.  I think they are struggling to figure out what REALLY is an interest to them.  <br/>

Used to be Teach Your Own by John Holt, but it&#39;s quite outdated now, and the updated one (reedited by someone else) isn&#39;t better than the original.<br/>
<br/>
I think the webpages are better than any one book.  Joyce&#39;s, mine, blogs of unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
For beginners I have a couple of starting places:<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s not reason for anyone to identify a &quot;real&quot; interest or a direction.  Explore the things, places, ideas, tastes, smells and sounds around you right now.  Make connections.  Someone with no &quot;direction of interest&quot; can still learn a million things without struggle.  Don&#39;t leave your children to  struggle.<br/>

<br/>
Don&#39;t try to interest them in learning new things.<br/>
Make life peaceful and interesting.  You learn with them, rather than you having your own activities, looking over your shoulder wishing they would have their own.<br/>

Watch movies together, surf YouTube for funny videos, cute animal videos, old music videos -- whatever they might enjoy.  Go places together -- Is it spring weather where you are?  Get out together -- take a hike, go to public gardens, do geocaching, go to science centers/museums, spring festivals, concerts, farmer&#39;s markets etc.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Be aware that some kids need some time to cocoon, hang out at home and decompress, especially if they&#39;re just coming out of school.  They may need some time to deschool - the general rule thumb is at least one month for each year they were schooled -- even counting structured HOME schooling.  During this time is a good time for you to read and research about unschooling, find other local unschoolers to connect with, make easy-to-eat, tasty foods for your kids to enjoy when their hungry.  Work on finding ways to say &quot;yes&quot; more to your kids and yourself for that matter.  &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-35069038"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What are some of your favorite books to jumpstart homeschooling? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A couple of my favourite books have been:<br/>
Sandra&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling and Rue Kream&#39;s Parenting a Free Child.  Blogs are really great too.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; What is a good plan for a day for a family just starting to unschool?

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think choosing to be with your children is really important in building a connection that allows learning to happen without much effort.  I don&#39;t mean leading your children&#39;s play, or leaving your children to play while you make yourself available while you pursue your interests.  I tried both of those and found I lost my connection with my son each time.  What works well for me, is to really get in there and be with him...play his games with him the way he likes to play them, so that I can understand what he is doing and why.  Then I can add to our days things that might lead us on tangents relative to where we are.  For example, recently we have been playing Minecraft together.  He loves the mining.  He gets so excited when he finds gold, diamond and obsidian.  The next time we stopped briefly at the library, I asked if he wanted to look at books with gold, diamond and obsidian in them.  He literally jumped up and down with excitement at that idea, and we ended up taking out a huge stack of books on all kinds of mining and earth related topics.  He picked them all out, although we searched for them together.  At home I left them on tables, where he and I look at them when we were eating, or transitioning, or whatever.  Later, we watched a video about volcanos, and looked through a collection of rocks in a box that I have been adding to over the years which included lava rock, basalt, obsidian and pumice.  Again, he was thrilled, but none of  this wouldn&#39;t have worked if I had chosen some topic without knowing where his interests were.  This also wouldn&#39;t have happened if I hadn&#39;t spent a good amount of time mining with him :) <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What has been difficult for me is to accept that the things I find really interesting might not interest my son in the same way they do me.  I love painting and drawing, and for a long time I would try to get him to join me, my way, in these activities.  It never really worked.  Recently, my son went into my art room and sat at the table drawing pages of game tiles and plans for a game he was making up.  Again, there were many different kinds of rocks and minerals and textures related to our recent interests.  The tiles were so detailed and interestingly laid out on the page.  He saw me, and excitedly asked me if I wanted to draw with him - his way.  In accepting this, I learned more about what he was seeing and thinking than I ever could have (or did) trying to get him to draw or paint something I planned for him.  And, I discovered he does like to draw - his things, his way!  I suspect the same is very true for your kids.  They will really enjoy what *they* really enjoy, especially when they know you support them and might even join them!  <br/>

<br/>
Yes, especially if you don&#39;t have a lot of time to read.   Look around for unschooling blogs and bookmark the ones you really like.   You don&#39;t need to spend extra money or remember where you left the book!    <br/>
<br/>
If you must have a book in your hands, &quot;Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life&quot;, by Rue Kream is very nice.   Easy to read in snippets and easy to jump around in and not get lost. <br/>
<br/>
***What is a good plan for a day for a family just starting to unschool?***<br/>
<br/>
Do things you already know your kids like to do.  Play in the yard?  Do that.   Ride bikes?  Do that.  Bake cookies?  Do that. <br/>
<br/>
Offer other fun things related to what they already like, give them more of what they love.  <br/>
<br/>
***I love to learn new things. Now, if I can interest my KIDS to feel that way without being suspicious! LOL!***<br/>
<br/>
Your kids already love to learn!   Your challenge (if you choose to accept it&lt;g&gt;) will be to not squelch that love.   Don&#39;t create stress.  Don&#39;t turn life into lessons.  Don&#39;t push them toward things they clearly don&#39;t want or stand between them and the things they love.   Be positive and interested and help them have fun. <br/>

It&#39;s okay to suggest things, too, but fun things. Have a movie marathon. Go window shopping. Go skating or bowling or to a pool (or pool hall... hard to find any in my area that aren&#39;t bars, but maybe you&#39;ll have better luck). Play miniature golf. Look around for touristy things to do in your area and do them for the fun of it. Go to a coffee-shop and people watch. Go to a pet shop and look at all the exotic fish and birds and snakes and creepy-crawlies. Get a new Lego kit. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about &quot;what Really is an interest&quot; - interests can be big and deep and passionate but they can also be fleeting. Its not bad to dabble. If your kids have been stuck in school they may need time to dabble with the assurance they don&#39;t need to finish what they start or stick something through. <br/>

<br/>
What do you read for entertainment? That seems like its a non-sequitur, but it could be better to step away from &quot;how to&quot; and touch base with your own personal interests. I like to read trashy fantasy novels and it took me awhile to feel good about that - in a sense, I had to &quot;deschool&quot; that part of me that believed &quot;smart girls read serious literature&quot;. But letting go of that idea helped me let go of wanting to push &quot;literature&quot; at my kids and instead value what They want to read or watch or play. <br/>
<br/>
But all that being said, Sandra Dodd&#39;s Big Book of Unschooling is a good one to pick up and put down *and* a great source of ideas, information and inspiration. <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
What I meant to say was not that my children have the same interests in me, but that they see that I like to look for things that interest me--my wish would be that they saw that when I had an interest, I worked on it, and that if they found an interest, they&#39;d put some time into it.  I don&#39;t at all feel they should have the same interests as me, or even as each other.  <br/>
 <br/>
I liked your comment about the Minecraft, and that this led to more interests that tied into that.  I guess to some degree we have already been doing this somewhat, but usually they really need me to help them continue with that little path off their project (in this case, Minecraft and the little paths that led to mining).  What I see is that I have been happy when they have found something to do, but I haven&#39;t helped them find the little paths that led off.  So that suggestion is really good.  We have always followed attachment parenting with our babies and toddlers, but I think because my parents were pretty uninvolved once we got school age, I have done the same thing, hoping to lead them to be more independent.  Funny, because I see as an adult, sometimes my own independence (think of a 2 year old:  &quot;MY way!&quot;  LOL!) has not always been positive in the way that I don&#39;t allow too many people into my world (okay, I admit I ran into trust issues as a child, and that didn&#39;t help!  LOL!).  I really enjoyed the comments, and that helps me to understand how to be a better parent and encourager!  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004349774">Meredith--you touched on something that our family ran into about &quot;literature&quot;.  I used to be a branch librarian until the kids started getting older and we needed to focus more on the older kids&#39; education (ha ha!).  Anyway, at that time we were in a school group that was basically &quot;run&quot; by one very vocal woman, and her similarly very local children.  Not only were they unhappy that the librarians of our county hadn&#39;t read EVERY book in the buildings (seriously??  Do all patrons believe that??), but they really felt they were far superior because they read all the &quot;great&quot; books of the ages.  When my kids balked at deep reading--it hurt me on two levels at first:  being a librarian, I was exposed to so much I THOUGHT they&#39;d love at the time!  LOL!  The other reason:  my pride in having to admit to this very vocal, very arrogant woman that my kids didn&#39;t love to read at every spare moment.  This family actually did base their &quot;friends&quot; on how much they read.  Now, I have come to the conclusion that it is okay that some of my kids learn by doing, seeing, hearing rather than by reading each book--&quot;fine literature&quot; or not.  But that line in &quot;Matilda&quot; (the movie--gasp!), where Danny Devito says, &quot;There is nothing in a book you can&#39;t learn faster from TV&quot;, does haunt me sometimes--ha ha!  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe the adage, &quot;get anything in a kid&#39;s hand to get them reading&quot;, but I do believe that it is okay if the newer titles feed their reading interests.  I try to do the read-alouds with books my kids may have actually shied away from reading, due to the topic or even how the book looks.  <br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for the wonderful comments.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yet that&#39;s wishing they were someone different than who they are.<br/>
<br/>
It seems a positive thing to want a trait that someone admires for her  <br/>
kids. And yet, is the above any different than wishing a pink princess  <br/>
girl were more rough and tumble? Or a meat loving kid would understand  <br/>
the suffering of animals? Or an ultra energetic kid would sit down and  <br/>
read just one book with you? Or an atheist would find Jesus or a God  <br/>
believer would let go of that delusion?<br/>
<br/>
Can you embrace the way they do approach life? It may be temporary --  <br/>
an aspect of their age -- or part of who they are and how they&#39;ll  <br/>
always do things. Either way, it will be relationship building to  <br/>
accept all of who they are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I haven&#39;t helped them find the little paths that led off.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is subtle, but what if they don&#39;t want the paths? What if they  <br/>
enjoy what they enjoy?<br/>
<br/>
Rather than showing them paths that lead elsewhere, show them other  <br/>
fun things. Things that connect to what they&#39;re interested in. Things  <br/>
that you think they might enjoy. Things you think are cool -- just  <br/>
because you want to share what you enjoy not because you think it  <br/>
would be good for them to enjoy too.<br/>
<br/>
If *they* take the paths, help them. If they don&#39;t take the paths,  <br/>
that&#39;s cool too. Be the opener of doors rather than the one standing  <br/>
beside the doors wishing they&#39;d step through. Look at your kids rather  <br/>
than where you wish they&#39;d be. Be the provider of the rich environment  <br/>
and then focus on them, helping them pull toward them what they enjoy  <br/>
rather than focusing on the environment trying to figure out how to  <br/>
engage them with it.<br/>

You don&#39;t need to be looking for &quot;little paths that lead off&quot; so much as looking for what interests your kids right now. If its Minecraft that&#39;s fine. It doesn&#39;t have to &quot;lead&quot; to something that looks educational for your kids to be learning a whole lot from what they&#39;re doing. They might find Minecraft inspires them to do something else or not. You might find a related game or movie or graphic novel they enjoy. Or Minecraft might be enough in and of itself. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where unschooling is different from an educational method, per se. An interest or passion doesn&#39;t have to have &quot;tie ins&quot; to other &quot;subjects&quot; in order to be valuable. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t believe the adage, &quot;get anything in a kid&#39;s hand to get them reading&quot;,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but I do believe that it is okay if the newer titles feed their reading<br/>
interests<br/>
****************<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to shock you - reading is a useful skill, but that&#39;s all. It doesn&#39;t matter if kids or adults enjoy it, if they ever want to read for fun. Not important. Kids will learn to read for the utility of it the same way Americans learn to drive for the utility of it. I drive almost every day, but I can&#39;t say I enjoy it. It&#39;s a useful skill. <br/>
<br/>
So in that sense, it really doesn&#39;t matter what they read so long as they are reading for their own reasons. Forget &quot;newer titles&quot; - I&#39;m talking about letting go of the idea that the purpose of reading is to read books. Plenty of adults live happy, meaningful, culturally rich lives without touching books - but they may read magazines, instructions, and web pages. They may go to plays, concerts and poetry slams. They may be artists, themselves - all without ever diving into a book for pleasure. <br/>
<br/>
Which isn&#39;t to say books are somehow evil - no more than is tv ;) And there&#39;s nothing *wrong* with reading for pleasure. Hanging on to the idea that people *should* read books in general and certain books in particular is limiting, though. The world of knowledge and artistry is much, much bigger than that. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-215756331">This is a bit from an offlist reply to a returned post that I wanted  <br/>
to pull out for the list.<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Me: Yet that&#39;s wishing they were someone different than who they are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You: Not really--I am wishing that they find other interests. We  <br/>
&gt; want our kids to be<br/>
&gt; who they want to be, and we are fine if the autistic guy or the FASD  <br/>
&gt; guy never<br/>
&gt; change.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The wish you wrote is something people say casually about their kids  <br/>
(and spouses). It&#39;s a thought that influences their actions. But they  <br/>
haven&#39;t pulled that thought apart and looked at what it feels like  <br/>
from the point of view of person the wish is directed at.<br/>
<br/>
Someone&#39;s interests *are* who they are. As are their choices. As is  <br/>
their approach to life. As are their reactions to the world.<br/>
<br/>
What if your husband wished you had different interests than you do?<br/>
<br/>
You disagreed with my statement with a statement that confirms what I  <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
You want to accept your kids but, unconsciously to you but clearly  <br/>
from the outside -- which is where your kids are! -- you&#39;re not  <br/>
accepting them. Those unconscious wishes will affect how you relate to  <br/>
their interests -- which are part of who they are.<br/>
<br/>
The type of wish you originally wrote -- &quot;my wish would be that they  <br/>
saw that when I had an interest, I worked on it, and that if they  <br/>
found an interest, they&#39;d put some time into it.&quot; --  is common. It  <br/>
sounds loving. Every caring parent wants better for their kids. But  <br/>
from the point of view of the child it can feel like a dissatisfaction  <br/>
with and unacceptance of who they are.<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
New stuff:<br/>
<br/>
First problem: Whenever I throw the idea of &quot;accepting who kids are&quot;  <br/>
onto the list, I know I&#39;m also unintentionally creating the idea of  <br/>
accepting that your kids are people who hit, or are thoughtless of  <br/>
others, or who will melt down in social situations. And I&#39;m not sure  <br/>
how to get across the one idea without the other!<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;accept&quot; is the problem word. &quot;Accept&quot; suggests giving up  <br/>
doing anything about the situation.<br/>
<br/>
Second problem: If I say that acceptance doesn&#39;t mean not doing  <br/>
anything, that creates the idea that everything a child isn&#39;t doing  <br/>
the best way is a problem to be tackled.<br/>
<br/>
I want a succinct way of saying &quot;accept your child&quot; without the side  <br/>
problems that causes. -) I want &quot;Accept that you can&#39;t change who your  <br/>
child is today. If they&#39;re unhappy, find ways to make their lives more  <br/>
joyful. If they&#39;re happy, focus on their happiness. :-)&quot; to be enough,  <br/>
but it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
ONE:<br/>
*If they are happy*, examine why you want them to change. Who are they  <br/>
hurting right now, this moment? If the answer is no one, then accept  <br/>
who they are right now. They are works in progress. Their focus may be  <br/>
elsewhere and what you see as a fault may be something that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
bother them *right now*. Or it&#39;s something they&#39;re willing to put up  <br/>
with while they&#39;re working on something that&#39;s important to them.<br/>
<br/>
Or it&#39;s their right-now approach to life. Accept the rightness of  <br/>
their approach for their right-now selves. Every solution, every  <br/>
approach has its positives and negatives. The negative you see may --  <br/>
for now -- be outweighed by a positive you don&#39;t see. What they&#39;re  <br/>
trying to get from a situation may be totally different than what you  <br/>
think they &quot;should&quot; be getting.<br/>
<br/>
If you fear that if they continue doing as they are -- even if it&#39;s  <br/>
not hurting them obviously now -- will hurt them in the future, that&#39;s  <br/>
something to bring to the list to get some distanced views on it! :-)  <br/>
(Examples are TV and eating. Those kinds of fears are too big to  <br/>
summarize and 1000s of words are collected on Sandra&#39;s and my sites.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Some examples (that aren&#39;t Big Fear based):<br/>
<br/>
1) When Kathryn was young, she formed some of her letters in what  <br/>
looked like painful ways. ;-) Watching her made me clench my teeth.  <br/>
And I offered lots of opportunities to see the &quot;right&quot; -- less painful  <br/>
-- ways like drawing on a Magna doodle and Italic handwriting  <br/>
examples. She went to 2nd grade for 2 months and her handwriting  <br/>
improved but when she quit, her handwriting went back to the way she  <br/>
was familiar with. Fortunately it didn&#39;t make me think she was now  <br/>
stuck with bad habits and I was bad for not correcting her earlier ;-)  <br/>
It made me realize that what was important to her was getting the  <br/>
words in her head down on paper. What she needed was for the process  <br/>
(of writing) not to get in the way. And what didn&#39;t get in the way was  <br/>
*her* way of writing. It was familiar and didn&#39;t intrude on her  <br/>
consciousness. And I knew when *she* needed to form letters more  <br/>
efficiently, she&#39;d seek out how to do that.<br/>
<br/>
2) On a walk one day -- years before I found unschooling -- a mom was  <br/>
following her child on his tricycle. He was sitting and scooting  <br/>
along, pushing with his feet rather than using the pedals. She made  <br/>
the comment as I strolled by that she wished he would use the pedals.  <br/>
She was watching him do what to her looked unnecessarily hard and  <br/>
wanted him to have a better way. But for *him* that was a better way.  <br/>
Or funner :-) (Which can be the same thing!) It could be his legs were  <br/>
too short to use the pedals well. It could be scooting was what felt  <br/>
right. I don&#39;t think I said anything wise but it was one of those  <br/>
defining moments that sowed the seeds of understanding how two people  <br/>
can have different views and yet both be right -- right for themselves  <br/>
but wrong for the other person.<br/>
<br/>
3) Kathryn was on the high school cross country team. She loves  <br/>
running and has a lot of natural talent, meaning she did well without  <br/>
pushing herself. From Carl&#39;s point of view, anyone with what she had  <br/>
obviously wanted to shoot for beating her own and others&#39; times. He  <br/>
wanted the best for her :-) So he helped her train. If someone has a  <br/>
goal it can help to have someone pushing you *in ways you want to go*.  <br/>
She didn&#39;t know what she loved about running so his goal for her felt  <br/>
like a good idea. His enthusiasm was infectious. But as she went  <br/>
along, she realized that *for her* the goal was a run that felt good.  <br/>
If she was running for the sake of times, then a good run might  <br/>
actually be a failure. For her father, not hitting the mark meant  <br/>
figuring out how to do better next time. For Kathryn, the mark was an  <br/>
enjoyable run. Even though Carl wanted the &quot;best&quot; for her, what she  <br/>
really needed was help with *her* definition of best, not *his*  <br/>
definition of best.<br/>
<br/>
Accept that your &quot;right&quot; way may be wrong for them. Then it will be  <br/>
easier to make suggestions of a way that might be helpful or easier  <br/>
but  also help you detach from your way being THE right way, help you  <br/>
not be invested in they adopting your &quot;right&quot; way. One day it may be  <br/>
right for them. Or it may not be because they want something different  <br/>
that your way won&#39;t help them get but their way will.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
TWO:<br/>
*If they are unhappy*, focus on what the child&#39;s trying to do rather  <br/>
than on the child. Look at yourself and how your reactions might be  <br/>
making it worse. Look at the environment and whether that can be  <br/>
changed for avoided. What can you change? What obstacles can you  <br/>
remove? What can you bring to them? How can you avoid adding further  <br/>
negative emotion? If it&#39;s an ongoing problem, ask on the list for some  <br/>
objectivity :-) If it&#39;s in the moment and you can&#39;t figure out how to  <br/>
do better, being there for a hug of understanding and acceptance that  <br/>
this is difficult is a really great response and may be all they need.<br/>
<br/>
Some examples:<br/>
Sometimes kids get wound up by intense hours of video games. The  <br/>
conventional approach is cut short the video games. But that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
help kids be happier in what their doing. (How to help them depends on  <br/>
the child. It might be bringing them food. Being aware of stopping  <br/>
points and offering physical movement. Part is offering ideas. Part is  <br/>
trusting they want to be happy.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids are highly sensitive. It seems loving to wish they were less  <br/>
sensitive. It seems loving to want to work on decreasing their  <br/>
sensitivity. But that sensitivity is part of who they are right now.  <br/>
What they need are ways to live as sensitive people in the world.  <br/>
Think about how frustrating it would be if your arm were broken and  <br/>
your husband&#39;s &quot;solution&quot; was to wish your arm weren&#39;t broken! Well,  <br/>
yeah, gee, big help there! ;-) But what if, instead, he did for you  <br/>
what you couldn&#39;t right now? What if he found clever ways to make what  <br/>
you wanted to do easy to do with a broken arm?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
THREE:<br/>
*If they are making others unhappy*, stop the child! Kids need a big  <br/>
clear message of &quot;No, not good.&quot; They don&#39;t necessarily need to  <br/>
understand why! They won&#39;t necessarily not do it again. But they need  <br/>
to feel &quot;That&#39;s not an acceptable solution. Let&#39;s try something else.&quot;  <br/>
And then move on to the *real* problem. Rather than focus on them  <br/>
understanding why those solutions are bad, focus on what your child is  <br/>
trying to do and help them. Assume that your child is doing the best  <br/>
they can and come up with *better* solutions than the ones your child  <br/>
is trying. *Be* the better solution. (Eg, say &quot;Thank you&quot; for them  <br/>
instead of making them.) Also accept that your child may not be ready  <br/>
for the situation. If they keep making choices that upset others,  <br/>
they&#39;re not ready. And they need to be kept out of the situation until  <br/>
they&#39;re older and you can try again.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are better examples and more that can be said about 2 and  <br/>
3 but I&#39;ve run out of time! Hopefully others can flesh them out. :-)<br/>

but it isn&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Something that has helped me a great deal here is differentiating between <br/>
acceptance and tolerance.  Scott Noelle has a Daily Groove about this (below): <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.enjoyparenting.com/daily-groove/acceptance-vs-tolerance">http://www.enjoyparenting.com/daily-groove/acceptance-vs-tolerance</a><br/>
<br/>
 Noelle wrote: &quot;Acceptance is one of your greatest sources of Power. Without it, <br/>
you couldn&#39;t receive or own anything, handle unexpected change, or listen <br/>
effectively.<br/>
In general, acceptance means being at peace with What Is. When you refuse to <br/>
accept something, you sacrifice your peace.<br/>
Non-acceptance creates resistance and shifts your focus away from what you want, <br/>
toward what you don&#39;t want.<br/>
Can you see, then, how you disempower and undermine yourself when you deem your <br/>
child&#39;s behavior &quot;unacceptable&quot;?<br/>
But acceptance is not the same as tolerance. It&#39;s entirely possible to accept <br/>
something while choosing not to tolerate it. For example, if your child were <br/>
trying to hit you, you could accept (make peace with) that — even while using <br/>
protective force to prevent the hitting.<br/>
The difference is how you feel in the process:<br/>
	* Tolerance without acceptance leads to resentment.<br/>
	* Tolerance with acceptance leads to appreciation.<br/>
	* INtolerance without acceptance leads to conflict.<br/>
	* INtolerance with acceptance leads to creativity.<br/>
In other words, when you accept What Is — AND you&#39;re clear that you want a <br/>
change — it&#39;s easy to solve problems creatively.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So, for example, I have decided to accept (rather than not accept) that my 5yo <br/>
daughter has a volatile temper and work with her on better ways to respond to <br/>
upsetting situations. However, I don&#39;t/will not tolerate her hitting, pushing, <br/>
biting her brothers or me when she is angry, frustrated, or feeling anxious. My <br/>
intolerance leads to finding different ways for both of us to respond, yet I am <br/>
not judging her temper.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe using these two words would help parents struggling with accepting their <br/>
children for who they are better deal with such feelings of wanting to change <br/>
what is. For the parent that wants their child to have other interests, they <br/>
could accept their child&#39;s interests without tolerating certain manifestations <br/>
of those interests, for example.<br/>

***************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
I read Meredith’s post to mean that finding the little path’s that lead off is not helpful if you are not looking for what actually interests your child. If somebody is sitting around waiting for their kids to find things to do and are happy when the kids succeed, that isn’t finding little paths and it also isn’t looking at current interests. It is letting the kids fumble around without any input or help.<br/>
<br/>
I think more information is necessary to determine whether the original poster is being passive or not. I do lots of strewing and have lots of cool stuff around my house. I give them lots of opportunities to do stuff but I am not necessarily looking for little paths. My 6 year old is really interested in Pokemon so I get everything that I can find related to Pokemon. I try to keep track of the time so that I can tell her when it will be on TV because she gets busy and forgets. If a new game comes out, we get it for her. I am very happy when my child discovers the cool stuff and plays with it or uses it. I feel like a lot of my time and energy is put into making sure that there are lots of things around the house that the kids will like and enjoy. In order to do that, I need to know what their interests are. There are some things that I would not get because I know that my kids do not like those things and would be offended if I brought them into the house because it would mean that I had completely ignored who they are and what their interests are.<br/>

Interesting and fun, yes! But at first, it could be better to avoid anything &quot;little paths&quot; that have an educational look or feel to them. Don&#39;t go from Minecraft to books about geology or documentaries about the mining industry, go from Minecraft to Roblox or Lego Star Wars or playing hide and seek. <br/>

Someone&#39;s interests *are* who they are. As are their choices. As is <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m just pulling out this section right here and I&#39;m going to share a story.<br/>
<br/>
This weekend, as a lot of you know, was the Life is Good Unschooling Conference <br/>
in Vancouver WA.  I ended up hosting the teen chat this year because the person <br/>
running it stayed home with a sick kid.  We opted for a chat rather than a <br/>
panel, so it was more informal and there were more ways to bounce back and forth <br/>
with questions and answers.  For those that don&#39;t know about what this is, it&#39;s <br/>
where parents can ask unschooled teens questions about their unschooling lives, <br/>
what they plan for the future, etc, so that parents with younger kids relax a <br/>
little bit about how kids &quot;turn out&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up on the topic of supporting passions, which started out being about <br/>
what these teens plans are for the near future.  One teen said that parents <br/>
should support their children&#39;s passions even if they are uncomfortable with <br/>
that passion, even if the kid wants to be a tattoo artist or a burlesque dancer <br/>
and went on to expand on how a parent who might be uncomfortable with those <br/>
passions could find value in them and be supportive.  One parent in the audience <br/>
firmly stated that she didn&#39;t agree with that at all, that as a parent, she had <br/>
the right and responsibility to not support a passion she didn&#39;t agree with and <br/>
that she, as that parent, should make sure that her child knew why she wasn&#39;t <br/>
supportive of it.<br/>
<br/>
There was almost an audible gasp from the row of teens, the tension immediately <br/>
sky rocketed.  You could FEEL IT.  The rest of the discussion went in the <br/>
direction of trusting and supporting passions.  These kids had no attachment to <br/>
that parent, yet each and everyone one of those teens could feel what that <br/>
feeling was so intensely that every person in that entire room could feel it. <br/>
 Imagine if that were you and your child.<br/>
<br/>
In that moment where you choose to devalue your child&#39;s interest, FEEL what that <br/>
might feel like to that child.  Even if you, as the parent, believe that you are <br/>
very very right about what you believe, your child is a different person who <br/>
just might have other ideas of what is right.  Even if they decide that they <br/>
weren&#39;t right, it is so much better to find that out for oneself than to have <br/>
someone else say or even think &quot;I told you so&quot;.  As a parent knowing that you <br/>
&quot;told them so&quot; feels awful, it just does.  Sometimes feeling or being right <br/>
about something sucks.  <br/>
<br/>
If there is a possibility that it just might suck in the end, wouldn&#39;t it be <br/>
better that the one part about it that doesn&#39;t suck is your relationship with <br/>
your kid?  The teens were awesome at talking about this topic!  They very <br/>
bluntly said that, sure any parent can tell their kid that they won&#39;t support <br/>
something, but what gets lost is the trust in the relationship.  We get to make <br/>
choices.  Parents can make choices about whether or not they will support <br/>
something or not, but in the end, the part that really makes the difference is <br/>
the relationship.  There were 2 teens there, whose father was in the audience, <br/>
so they put him on the spot a little bit (it was their mom that was supposed to <br/>
have hosted the chat) and brought up one time that one of them hadn&#39;t felt <br/>
supported in something and why and how and all 3 of them explained how that <br/>
worked, how they handled that and how they do better with it now.  He was very <br/>
gracious about it.<br/>
<br/>
Gracious is a good word there!  We WANT to be gracious with our kids!  Finding <br/>
ways to support our kids in what they want to do, even if it makes us terribly <br/>
uncomfortable, is so earth shatteringly mind changing that you can&#39;t help but <br/>
grow as a person to do it.  We get to learn how to be better people because of <br/>
our kids and that is awesome and our kids can reap the benefits of that in huge <br/>
life transforming ways.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read what led up to this conversation, so I hope that I haven&#39;t taken <br/>
this totally off topic here!  I will go back and read now!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-64769197">***I have been trying to just de-brief, relax, look for signals from the kids of <br/>
what their direction of interest might be, etc. I think they are struggling to <br/>
figure out what REALLY is an interest to them.***<br/>
<br/>
Kids have all kinds of interests all the time, it&#39;s usually the adults that <br/>
can&#39;t see them through their narrow tunnel vision.  For most kids, the world is <br/>
expansive and interesting and as long as the adults around them continually make <br/>
the world expansive and interesting, there is no way that you won&#39;t see what <br/>
they find interesting.<br/>
<br/>
In other words, right now, you aren&#39;t finding the world interesting so you <br/>
aren&#39;t seeing what your kids are interested in.  What do they DO?  Watch TV? <br/>
 Play games?  What?  There&#39;s your answer.  That&#39;s what they find interesting, <br/>
that&#39;s what interests them, really.  See what they like about it, find out <br/>
interesting those things are and make it more interesting.  Do that more.  If <br/>
they like music, look it up on Youtube and then do video chasing, follow the <br/>
next most interesting thing on that list on the right.  THAT is how you find <br/>
interesting rabbit trails and expand and learn more and more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546123683">***He loves the mining. He gets so excited when he finds gold, diamond and <br/>
obsidian. The next time we stopped briefly at the library, I asked if he wanted <br/>
to look at books with gold, diamond and obsidian in them. He literally jumped up <br/>
and down with excitement at that idea, and we ended up taking out a huge stack <br/>
of books on all kinds of mining and earth related topics. He picked them all <br/>
out, although we searched for them together. At home I left them on tables, <br/>
where he and I look at them when we were eating, or transitioning, or whatever. <br/>
Later, we watched a video about volcanos, and looked through a collection of <br/>
rocks in a box that I have been adding to over the years which included lava <br/>
rock, basalt, obsidian and pumice. Again, he was thrilled, but none of this <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have worked if I had chosen some topic without knowing where his <br/>
interests were.***<br/>
<br/>
Books and videos are great!  There is also the real world!  Go to cool rock and <br/>
mineral shows!  Find obsidian fields and explore them.  Go mining!  There are <br/>
lots of places to do that!  Go to mining museums.  Go to jewelry stores, go to <br/>
jewelry supply stores.  Explore geology in all kinds of ways that connect with <br/>
that!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how it works... one little seemingly insignificant interest, that leads <br/>
to one thing, find a book or video, go and do and be around, explore.  One <br/>
little thing can lead to lots of little things or other big huge things, but you <br/>
won&#39;t know unless you try it.  You won&#39;t know unless you find something <br/>
interesting in the seemingly insignificant!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544157861">***my wish would be that they saw that when I had an interest, I worked on it, <br/>
and that if they found an interest, they&#39;d put some time into it.***<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s assuming that each and every interest has a value attachment to it.  Not <br/>
all interests are going to be as valuable as the next, or other interest.  Time <br/>
isn&#39;t an investment.  It&#39;s hard to see it that way in a culture steeped in time <br/>
and value.  One small passing interest, one moment of finger knitting in one <br/>
work shop when a child is 8, need not lead to knitting and felting delicious <br/>
bags and shawls to be sold at the local art market.  That one moment can lead to <br/>
nothing for 7 yrs and rediscovered in a conversation that connects with a person <br/>
who knows how to also fix cars and you were just exactly at that moment also <br/>
interested in fixing cars.<br/>
<br/>
Each person spends exactly the amount of time they want to spend on each thing <br/>
in each given moment.  Sometimes I spend exactly 20 minutes doing dishes because <br/>
I want time to do something else within an hour that I have free to do as I <br/>
please.  I have a child who can spend many hours building with legos on one day <br/>
and not touch them in a month, then pick up that same lego creation and continue <br/>
on as if no time had lapsed in between.  Should I not keep legos around because <br/>
she doesn&#39;t play with them much?  After all, once a month isn&#39;t much and legos <br/>
are just toys.  Guess how she learned to multiply?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1498960469">-=-So, for example, I have decided to accept (rather than not accept) that my 5yo <br/>
daughter has a volatile temper and work with her on better ways to respond to <br/>
upsetting situations. However, I don&#39;t/will not tolerate her hitting, pushing, <br/>
biting her brothers or me when she is angry, frustrated, or feeling anxious. My <br/>
intolerance leads to finding different ways for both of us to respond, yet I am <br/>
not judging her temper.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you think of it as helping her live peacefully in the world, you don&#39;t need &quot;intolerance.&quot;<br/>
Being a child&#39;s partner covers the problem in the idea of &quot;acceptance,&quot; I think.  <br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m realistic about my partner&#39;s abilities and personality traits, I can cover and compensate for those in particular situations, or know when to retreat to some privacy, or to regroup and refuel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe using these two words...-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;accept&quot; and &quot;tolerate&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe using these two words would help parents struggling with accepting their <br/>
children for who they are better deal with such feelings of wanting to change <br/>
what is. For the parent that wants their child to have other interests, they <br/>
could accept their child&#39;s interests without tolerating certain manifestations <br/>
of those interests, for example.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any child has an interest in having a volatile temper, so I don&#39;t understand that paragraph in light of the one before it.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of interest would have aspects that needed to be tolerated or not tolerated?  Playing ball in the house?  Unauthorized body piercings?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Manifestations&quot; isn&#39;t a good word to use when &quot;action&quot; or &quot;choice&quot; would be clearer and more helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I agree absolutely that some people &quot;accept&quot; bad behavior and call it &quot;accepting their child as he is.&quot;   But I don&#39;t thin &quot;intolerance&quot; is a good counter-balance to that.  Being a good partner is more peaceful and more loving than whether to tolerate or to be intolerant, I think.   &quot;Tolerate&quot; suggests a painful, forced patience, while &quot;acceptance&quot; is more peaceful and centering.<br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t need to know anything more about the original poster, because once the idea is out on the list, we&#39;re playing with the idea itself.   Joyce wrote this great description years ago, and it&#39;s linked from the intro page:<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

------------<br/>
<br/>
-=-. I feel like a lot of my time and energy is put into making sure that there are lots of things around the house that the kids will like and enjoy. In order to do that, I need to know what their interests are. There are some things that I would not get because I know that my kids do not like those things and would be offended if I brought them into the house because it would mean that I had completely ignored who they are and what their interests are.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too inflexible and too &quot;child led&quot; to be expansive.  I don&#39;t think they would be offended, and I don&#39;t think you would have &quot;completely ignored&quot; them by bringing something new into the house.   Strewing isn&#39;t about &quot;complete the set&quot; of Pokemon or another already-known interest.  It&#39;s about bringing something new and different and intriguing in and not worrying whether they jump on it and play for hours, or whether they don&#39;t even notice it.  There&#39;s nothing on earth to be offended about there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210505690">-=- it&#39;s <br/>
where parents can ask unschooled teens questions about their unschooling lives, <br/>
what they plan for the future, etc, so that parents with younger kids relax a <br/>
little bit about how kids &quot;turn out&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard from two different people that on facebook there&#39;s a &quot;group&quot; (a page) where someone is badmouthing at least two of my kids by name--Holly and Kirby.  I&#39;m not going to go and look at it (at least not today), because I&#39;m in Durham and tomorrow I&#39;ll be in Sheffield, and I&#39;m not sitting around in Albuquerque as I more usually am.   But it&#39;s stunning to me that adults would be badmouthing my now-grown offspring by name in an attempt to discredit unschooling and unschoolers.  My kids are fine, they&#39;re happy, they&#39;re healthy, they&#39;re cool people.   <br/>
<br/>
-=-even if the kid wants to be a tattoo artist or a burlesque dancer <br/>
and went on to expand on how a parent who might be uncomfortable with those <br/>
passions could find value in them and be supportive. One parent in the audience <br/>
firmly stated that she didn&#39;t agree with that at all, that as a parent, she had <br/>
the right and responsibility to not support a passion she didn&#39;t agree with and <br/>
that she, as that parent, should make sure that her child knew why she wasn&#39;t <br/>
supportive of it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I could be supportive of future tattoo interests or burlesque dancing aspirations, but wouldn&#39;t encourage an underage child to do anything that was illegal.  So although I understand the gasp of the crowd, I also understand (maybe; I wasn&#39;t there) the sentiment that not all things can or should be equally supported.<br/>
<br/>
That said, though, when I was fourteen or so my mom said that I could probably do/be anything I wanted to and that she didn&#39;t care what I did when I grew up, as long as it wasn&#39;t prostitution.  Of course that stuck in the not-so-distant back of my mind as a possible career path, but I never had the requisite talent or personality for it.<br/>
<br/>
So I never told any of my children &quot;never work as a prostitute,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean I accept or tolerate or am supportive of Future Hookers of America. The more general ideas about being honest, responsible, safe and helping make the world a better place tend to cover those things without the specifics.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Gracious is a good word there! We WANT to be gracious with our kids! Finding <br/>
ways to support our kids in what they want to do, even if it makes us terribly <br/>
uncomfortable, is so earth shatteringly mind changing that you can&#39;t help but <br/>
grow as a person to do it. We get to learn how to be better people because of <br/>
our kids and that is awesome and our kids can reap the benefits of that in huge <br/>
life transforming ways.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I hope I could be gracious about &quot;I want to be a tattoo artist&quot; or &quot;I can dance!  I have a nice bod!  They pay for this sort of thing!&quot;   (Marty did go as a Chippendale dancer one Halloween and I did make the tear-off dress shirt that leaves the cuffs and collars.  Robyn Coburn helped me design it, at a distance. :-)   So maybe I have supported burlesque dancing more than most parents. :-)<br/>

allowing whatever.....<br/>
<br/>
I liked more what Sandra said about being realistic - maybe the kind of <br/>
accepting meant is &quot;accepting reality.&quot; That does seem, to me, to be <br/>
peaceful and centering, even when the reality being accepted is not, <br/>
itself, peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little bothered by what seems sometimes an over-emphasis on <br/>
accepting a child for who he is....that phrase worries me a bit. I&#39;d <br/>
rather think of parents as supporting their child to become who he wants <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter once said that one of the necessary qualities she <br/>
would require in a spouse would be that he&#39;d be into always becoming a <br/>
better person, a more interesting person, a kinder person, etc. I <br/>
realize this can go too far and such a person could never feel okay <br/>
about themselves, but I think what she meant was that she wanted a <br/>
spouse who wasn&#39;t complacent and self-satisfied as if he was &quot;done&quot; with <br/>
developing himself, but who wanted to live an examined life and <br/>
consciously think about his own behavior and his character, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can sometimes be too accepting, I think, in the sense that they <br/>
don&#39;t even offer their kids support to improve their own behaviors and <br/>
character. If a child is kicking the parent and screaming at the parent, <br/>
the parent can &quot;accept&quot; it by completely ignoring the behavior and never <br/>
helping the child consider other options. Or the parent can accept the <br/>
reality that the child is sensitive or volatile and set up an <br/>
environment to make the child and others safer and happier and the <br/>
parent can, over time, help the child find more productive and happier <br/>
ways to react. How the parent approaches it will depend on the child and <br/>
the circumstances, but I worry that &quot;accept&quot; is sometimes heard as &quot;do <br/>
nothing.&quot;<br/>

buying one of the pocket books which had all the pictures and maps he<br/>
wanted. Then on his own he picked up another one of New York.<br/>
<br/>
He was so happy and has been going through them since last evening. we also<br/>
picked up some picture flash cards for French, He cannot read but we are<br/>
still having fun.<br/>
<br/>
We navigate a lot on Google Earth to see all the cities he likes....<br/>

All that he wanted is available on the net too...but he wanted books...<br/>

I thought a while before using &#39;intolerance&#39;. I was looking at Scott Noelle&#39;s <br/>
way of using tolerance and INtolerance (that&#39;s how he wrote it), and I decided <br/>
to attempt to apply it.  It certainly sounds ugly to me now.  What I mean is <br/>
that when I am am not tolerating a particular action (my daughter hurting others <br/>
when she is angry), I choose to find a creative solution to respond to her <br/>
(rather than using traditionally accepted top-down parenting practices like <br/>
punishment) as well as help her find creative alternatives to being hurtful when <br/>
she is angry. So, in effect, I am not tolerating the chosen expression of her <br/>
anger (hitting), and I accept that she is angry and needs to express it. This <br/>
combo leads to both of us finding creative ways to work with expressing anger. <br/>
<br/>
-=Being a child&#39;s partner covers the problem in the idea of &quot;acceptance,&quot; I <br/>

<br/>
Maybe to you.  But Joyce, I think it was, was claiming that she was having a <br/>
challenging time with the use of the word &quot;acceptance&quot; when working with other <br/>
parents struggling with being acceptant of their child&#39;s interests.  My <br/>
understanding of her dilemma was that saying, &quot;accept your child&quot; means to such <br/>
parents that they are being asked to support all that a child does or wants to <br/>
explore.  So, I offered that I think one can accept without necessarily <br/>
tolerating.<br/>
<br/>
-=What sort of interest would have aspects that needed to be tolerated or not <br/>
tolerated? Playing ball in the house? Unauthorized body piercings?-=<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking more along the lines of actual physical violence to hurt others, <br/>
watching or participating in pornography, illegal street racing, using drugs <br/>
without guidance...  I had a boyfriend who enjoyed getting drunk and beating the <br/>
hell out of people. If my teen son enjoyed fighting, I could attempt to support <br/>
that interest by getting him involved in boxing, for example. But I would not <br/>
support/tolerate him going out and beating people up on the street. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ok.   Revision: For the parent that wants their child to have other interests, <br/>
they could instead accept their child&#39;s interests without tolerating certain <br/>
choices or ways of acting out those interests.<br/>

-=-So, for example, I have decided to accept (rather than not accept) that my <br/>
5yo <br/>
<br/>
daughter has a volatile temper and work with her on better ways to respond to <br/>
upsetting situations. However, I don&#39;t/will not tolerate her hitting, pushing, <br/>
biting her brothers or me when she is angry, frustrated, or feeling anxious. My <br/>
intolerance leads to finding different ways for both of us to respond, yet I am <br/>
not judging her temper.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you think of it as helping her live peacefully in the world, you don&#39;t need <br/>
&quot;intolerance.&quot;<br/>
Being a child&#39;s partner covers the problem in the idea of &quot;acceptance,&quot; I think. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m realistic about my partner&#39;s abilities and personality traits, I can <br/>
cover and compensate for those in particular situations, or know when to retreat <br/>
to some privacy, or to regroup and refuel.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe using these two words...-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;accept&quot; and &quot;tolerate&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe using these two words would help parents struggling with accepting <br/>
their <br/>
<br/>
children for who they are better deal with such feelings of wanting to change <br/>
what is. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think any child has an interest in having a volatile temper, so I don&#39;t <br/>
understand that paragraph in light of the one before it.<br/>
<br/>
What sort of interest would have aspects that needed to be tolerated or not <br/>
tolerated?  Playing ball in the house?  Unauthorized body piercings?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Manifestations&quot; isn&#39;t a good word to use when &quot;action&quot; or &quot;choice&quot; would be <br/>
clearer and more helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I agree absolutely that some people &quot;accept&quot; bad behavior and call it &quot;accepting <br/>
their child as he is.&quot;   But I don&#39;t thin &quot;intolerance&quot; is a good <br/>
counter-balance to that.  Being a good partner is more peaceful and more loving <br/>
than whether to tolerate or to be intolerant, I think.   &quot;Tolerate&quot; suggests a <br/>
painful, forced patience, while &quot;acceptance&quot; is more peaceful and centering.<br/>
