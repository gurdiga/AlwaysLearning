with my chorus teacher when he was teaching us &quot;Blowing in the Wind&quot; when it <br/>
was a really TRULY new song, that he must be wrong, the guy who wrote must be <br/>
Bob DYElin because it was spelled that way.   I was 13 or 14, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of the huge emphasis on phonics I wish people/teachers/readers would <br/>
just be honest and tell kids &quot;You don&#39;t know for sure until you hear it.&quot;   <br/>
Not just about names, about any words, especially in English.   <br/>
