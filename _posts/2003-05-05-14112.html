<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550176175">Hi Laura.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the particulars about your case and it would depend on why you had cesareans, but I was told all those horror stories too and they were outright lies. At least it is far less likely to kill you or the baby than a cesarean. I know that there are many cases where medical interventions save lives, but most cesareans are unnecessary. Having had a cesarean is not a good reason to have another...and another. It is a huge scam. Doctors make a lot more money out of surgery than normal birth. there is no statistical evidence that a scarred uterus is more likely to rupture than an unscarred one in an otherwise healthy woman.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend that you read everything you can find on the topic to help with your decision. Get informed.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Kerrin.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rupture than an unscarred one in an otherwise healthy woman. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And it doesn&#39;t even make plain sense.  Scar tissue is stronger than regular <br/>
skin.  The idea that a new incision might open up before it&#39;s grown back is <br/>
real.  The idea that a healed incision would is nuts.  Nobody has another <br/>
baby within two or three months of a cesarean.  If it&#39;s been a year or two, <br/>
that place is TOTALLY healed and the more scarred the stronger, it seems to <br/>
me.  Stretch marks seem more dangerous than scars (but then they&#39;re probably <br/>
some kind of scars too).<br/>
<br/>
Another woman and I were the organizers of the New Mexico chapter of Cesarean <br/>
Prevention Movement in 1988 or so.  She had a [what&#39;s the term?] scar, <br/>
vertical, really big scar.  I had a transverse not-much-showing scar.  She <br/>
had two v-bacs just fine.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Had pitocin with my first. Had reduced heart rate almost went section and it <br/>
was awful on me. Really ruined the birthing experience. After that mess I was <br/>
glad my next was a section but now that I have had a second section I wish I <br/>
would have pushed for a vbac on the last one.  Plus on both sections I was <br/>
kept at the hospital three additional days due to illious (sp) and on the <br/>
last one I was back at the hospital a month later for a possible intestine <br/>
blockage.  The worst part a year later I still have this pouch that is <br/>
driving me insane!<br/>
Here they tell Vbac Moms that they have to go to the Major hospitals and they <br/>
are both over an hour away. Not something I wanted to attempt in labor.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A great place to start is with the International Cesarean Awareness Network (ICAN). They have<br/>
a great website and an AWESOME email list. Great supportive women...some are trying<br/>
for vbac, some are just processing their sections, some are midwives, some are doulas.<br/>
<br/>
here is their blurb:<br/>
<br/>
The ICAN email list is an online support group for anyone wishing to discuss birth and cesarean issues. Topics of discussion frequently include how to avoid an unnecessary cesarean, preparing for VBAC (Vaginal Birth After Cesarean), healing and grieving from a difficult or traumatic previous birth, how to find a caregiver who is supportive of vaginal birth and VBAC, informed consent, childbirth education, the role of doulas and midwives, birth stories, etc. The list is made up primarily of mothers, in addition to some doulas, midwives, childbirth educators, and occasionally fathers. You can choose to receive all messages posted to the group as individual emails, or grouped together in digests. When you join the list, please offer an introduction to the group, perhaps through telling your birth stories or explaining your interest in ICAN. We look forward to chatting with you! <br/>
<br/>
To join go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ican-online.org/">http://www.ican-online.org/</a> and click on community, then ICAN news group.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Scar tissue is tough. But it isn&#39;t as stretchy. I have a great big scar on<br/>
my stomach. If I pull on the unscarred skin it just stretches. If I pull on<br/>
the scar it indents, like the impression a string would make.<br/>
