<div id="ygrps-yiv-963137834">I am not sure what you mean by pointing in the right direction, do you mean<br/>
how does it work, or how do you find a chiro?  My understanding of why it<br/>
works is because when you adjust the neck and head areas (for lack of the<br/>
technical term) that allows the ear tubes to drain and then the<br/>
infection/inflamation to recede.  His ears were coated in yeast, and that<br/>
was part of what was causing the inflamation and pain.  The antibiotics<br/>
would have made that worse.  Her other recommendations were to candle his<br/>
ears, somthing I can describe later.<br/>
<br/>
To find a good chiro I would ask around and see who you can find.  We found<br/>
a chiro who specializes in kids and is truly wonderful with them and has a<br/>
lot of experience with dealing with fears and tears.<br/>
<br/>
I have to go, but if I didn&#39;t answer your question or if you have more let<br/>
me know.<br/>

&gt; Carrie,<br/>
&gt; This is the first I&#39;ve heard of a chirp for infection! Can you point me in<br/>
the right direction? Brianna is having big trouble w/ antibiotics.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
