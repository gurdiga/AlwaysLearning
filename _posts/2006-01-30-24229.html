<div id="ygrps-yiv-1063799086">Tonight a friend of Kirby&#39;s was here.  I don&#39;t know her very well;  <br/>
I&#39;ve just met her once before.  She came down to watch Desperate  <br/>
Housewives with me and Holly, until time for her to go out to eat  <br/>
with some of the other older kids.<br/>
<br/>
At the commercial, she said &quot;I&#39;m in love with your house!&quot;  I thanked  <br/>
her, and asked if she had seen the whole thing, seen the back, and  <br/>
she said yes, she had gotten the full tour.  She was all big smiles  <br/>
and said &quot;It&#39;s the Weasley&#39;s House!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had a twinge of shame at the jumbliness of it all, but honestly I  <br/>
love the Weasley house and wouldn&#39;t want to live in a Dursley house.   <br/>
(I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever have to worry about that.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  When they went out to eat, at Bennigan&#39;s, they took Holly with  <br/>
them.  That&#39;s pretty sweet.  Marty was already in bed before 8:00.   <br/>
He works early and hasn&#39;t been feeling well.</div>

&gt;&gt;also a Dursley house?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Weasley house was the house with a large family full of love, diversity,<br/>
and dissheveledness in Harry Potter stories.<br/>
<br/>
The Dursley house was Harry&#39;s aunt and uncle with whom he lived and it was<br/>
neat and snobbish and full of meanness.<br/>

You should watch the DVDs, or better even read the books!<br/>

Harry has to live with his aunt, uncle and cousin, the Dursleys.<br/>
Sometimes he gets to visit his friend Ron Weasley&#39;s family at their  <br/>
house.<br/>
