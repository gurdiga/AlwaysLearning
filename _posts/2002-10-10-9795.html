<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044861237">Dylan and I drove to Anaconda, about twenty eight miles away, for lunch<br/>
today.  It was partly to get a sandwich and partly to see all the<br/>
beautiful colors and mostly because we know there won&#39;t be too many more<br/>
days of nice weather.  The tires on our car aren&#39;t very good and we may<br/>
be staying home a lot this winter.<br/>
   <br/>
So we had this beautiful drive, and stopped here and there to look at<br/>
geese and deer and a dead coyote, who&#39;d been hit by a car.  We moved him<br/>
off the road and put a ring of rocks around him.  It was Dylan&#39;s idea. <br/>
We didn&#39;t have any way to bury him but Dylan thought we should show our<br/>
respect. <br/>
 <br/>
We watched some remodeling work on an old building and stopped to see<br/>
where a big fire had been last month, and found a new building there, not<br/>
finished yet, but up and looking official.   We took our sandwiches to<br/>
the cemetery and looked at the old Russian graves.  Some of the granite<br/>
on the stones has worn away and we couldn&#39;t see the writing, but we could<br/>
feel it.  It was in Russian, so we don&#39;t know what it said, but we<br/>
imagined.  <br/>
<br/>
We walked. <br/>
<br/>
We came home and Dylan had a Karate class.  There were only two students<br/>
tonight including Dylan,  and the assistant instructor, Forest.   Forest<br/>
was homeschooled and is twenty two.  His brother Willow was the other<br/>
student.  They are wonderful  young men and I love their mom.  She told<br/>
me a story once about killing a pack rat that had gotten into her house<br/>
while she was away.  Her husband took his sleeping bag down to the creek<br/>
to get some sleep while she stalked this poor creature with a hunting<br/>
knife and slashed it to death in her bedroom in the middle of the night. <br/>
A gruesome tale.  She is my philosophical discussion partner.  You can<br/>
probably guess her philosophy of pack rats.   Today was Willow&#39;s 14th<br/>
birthday.   After Karate we went to the bowling alley for Willow&#39;s party.<br/>
 I am not a bowler.   Dylan got a little better tonight and had fun with<br/>
some other kids that came to the party.  I received much instruction from<br/>
people half my size who launched their bowling balls from a squatting<br/>
position, swinging them back between their legs and then down the alley. <br/>
One must yell &quot;knock &#39;em all down!&quot; as the ball inches it&#39;s way to the<br/>
pins.  I  actually tried this technique but I didn&#39;t improve any.  Next<br/>
time maybe.  There was food and cake and soda and fun and then we rushed<br/>
home in time to get a call from David who is working out of town.   Dylan<br/>
is watching Monty Python&#39;s Holy Grail right now,  -- You tiny brained<br/>
wipers of other people&#39;s bottoms!--  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a good day... Dylan is going to sleep with me tonight he<br/>
says, because I can keep his feet warm. = )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-531841200">VERY nice day!<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow early Marty and I are leaving for South Carolina, so I&#39;ll be gone <br/>
from here for six days.  Holly isn&#39;t very happy with me about it.  She&#39;s <br/>
going to miss me.  It&#39;s too long.  I feel bad.<br/>
<br/>
Her dad has to work tomorrow but not Friday, and then Monday and Tuesday <br/>
he&#39;ll be working again.  <br/>
<br/>
Sorry to zoom away, but I&#39;m already down below five hours of sleep tonight.  <br/>
I did want to say goodbye.  I know this list is quiet, but it&#39;s my favorite.<br/>

Seriously! <br/>
<br/>
People are constantly asking what an unschooling day looks like. Deb, if you <br/>
would compile all these wonderful daily stories, it would be THE book <br/>
unschoolers would recommend to wannabees!<br/>
<br/>
Think about it! Hard!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950415649">Deb:<br/>
<br/>
I loved reading about your day with Dylan.  Sometimes I forget it&#39;s the<br/>
small things that make the difference.  The discovering of something<br/>
simple.  Yesterday I picked up my best friend&#39;s son from school (wow<br/>
those places are noises)..  He had a half day and she&#39;s out of town in<br/>
Kansas for a week.  My boys couldn&#39;t get over the amount of school buses<br/>
in one place!!  Zak and Eliott played together for about 6 hours and had<br/>
a great time.  They dug up the back garden and built a moat and a<br/>
castle.  It was fascinating to watch them on and off.  Soccer practice<br/>
came later, followed by a stop at grandma and grandpas and then DH<br/>
decided to take both sons to Peter Piper Pizza.  Needless to say my baby<br/>
(Max aged 3) didn&#39;t go to bed till I think 11:30pm.  He was in bed with<br/>
me and I think I fell asleep about 11:30pm.<br/>
<br/>
What  a great day was had by all...<br/>

 It&#39;s beautiful here and interesting, geographically, but I&#39;ve never fit<br/>
in, personally.   I&#39;m a granola in a meat and potatoes town.  I used to<br/>
kind of hide out, but now I flaunt it.  I figure every little cowboy town<br/>
needs a character!  Dylan loves it here.<br/>
He thinks small town life is perfect.  He wouldn&#39;t mind though, if we&#39;d<br/>
get a good toy store.<br/>

participated in the stories and adventures was grown up and doing<br/>
something people consider &quot;real&quot;.   <br/>
*I* don&#39;t believe that&#39;s the only thing that would give these stories<br/>
value, but I think nervous parents want a blueprint AND a guarantee. <br/>
Without it people would still have panic attacks, but with it they could<br/>
say to worried husbands and relatives,  other kids lived this way and<br/>
they turned out ok...<br/>
There will be lots and lots of those stories before too long.  = )<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-863519706">Dawn, when Dylan five we had a friend here who&#39;s children were in<br/>
Kindergarten and second grade.  We&#39;d pick them up after school three days<br/>
a week and they&#39;d play at our house for a couple of hours while their mom<br/>
was at work.  Dylan thought the school was really interesting and we&#39;d go<br/>
a little early so he could climb on the playground equipment while we<br/>
waited.   <br/>
The thing was, after picking up the kids they would always have something<br/>
to say about their day.  The little girl, Morgan, always had a headache,<br/>
always had been hit or pushed or otherwise assaulted or offended and the<br/>
older boy Jared was being bullied by some mean kid.  I never worried that<br/>
Dylan would want to go to school because he felt so sorry for his friends<br/>
who had to go.  <br/>
<br/>
He hears all the time at Karate and Tae Kwon Do that he&#39;s lucky he<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to go to school, but we still sneak in and climb that jungle<br/>
gym thing once in awhile.  I expect we&#39;ll get busted someday...but I<br/>
figure, hey, I paid for it, right? <br/>
