<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091236402">This is sad, I think...our neighbors just had their 3rd dd the other <br/>
day.  Yesterday, we went to visit and see the baby.  Their oldest dd  is <br/>
6, next is 3.  Neither sister likes or is excited about the baby. And my <br/>
neighbor said they are trying not to hold the baby too much because the <br/>
other girls get jealous.  It&#39;s so hard for me to keep my mouth shut <br/>
sometimes, but I did.  How sad for that baby and for the older girls.<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;ve always included my girls in my pregnancy, home birth, <br/>
breastfeeding, all of it.  I always told them that it was &quot;our&quot; baby. <br/>
 The day after my 4th dd was born, the 2 yr old sat and held her on the <br/>
couch for almost 2 hrs.  When the 2 yr old was born, my 5 yr old (2 at <br/>
the time) held her for the first time and wouldn&#39;t give her back.  The <br/>
same when the second was born and my first tried to nurse her so she <br/>
could be her mommy, too.  It&#39;s been 5 months now and they still fight <br/>
over who&#39;s turn it  is to hold our newest.  Some might think I&#39;m just <br/>
lucky that they all like each other, but I think the parents need to let <br/>
the older children know how important they are to a new siblings life.<br/>
<br/>
We are right next door to each other, us with four girls 7,5,2 1/2, and <br/>
5 mnths, and them with three girls, 6, 3, and 2 days.  And I don&#39;t like <br/>
my girls to play with theirs too much.  The 6 year old is violent. <br/>
 Every summer they take her out into the woods and catch big toads and <br/>
let her take them home.  She kills them within one day.  Swings them by <br/>
the legs, throws them in the air.  Last summer I called my girls to come <br/>
home when she did this and explained to them that the frog was alive and <br/>
could feel pain and what that little girl was doing was cruel.  Then <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t go back over.  They wanted me to make her stop, but her <br/>
mother was right there and she wasn&#39;t saying anything.  I didn&#39;t feel it <br/>
was my place, although maybe I should have.  And the 3 yr old is <br/>
painfully shy and hardly ever even outside.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  I&#39;m just rambling.  I feel so sad for those girls because <br/>
children need touching and affection. All the toads and toys (which they <br/>
have tons) in the world won&#39;t make up for the simplest and most basic <br/>
need they have, the love of each other.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to go hug my girls now.  Have a great day, everyone!   HeidiC.</div>

I don&#39;t like them playing together too much.  Or, I want to be right there.  <br/>
This is one angry child who whispers things about rotting in hell in my son&#39;s <br/>

I agree with you on siblings holding babies!  My two are 53 weeks apart and <br/>
my oldest held my youngest when she was about 4 weeks old.  Lots of pillows, <br/>
some hovering, but it really helped form their bond.<br/>
