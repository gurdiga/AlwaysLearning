 </span></blockquote>How exciting for you!  We considered relocating to New Mexico.  But now<br/>
we have a place we love here in CA on the outskirts of the Bay Area.<br/>
I live with a lot of trees around and on really clear days I can see<br/>
a peak of the ocean!<br/>
<br/>
It snowed here today!  It snowed overnight and was mostly melted by<br/>
morning.  Then at 1 this afternoon it started  and in a matter of<br/>
minutes the deck was covered.  It was a hail/snow combo - little <br/>
balls of ice.  So my children quickly got dressed and went outside.<br/>
They had a blast and came in when they got too cold!  I want to go<br/>
to the snow later this year but it&#39;s really neat for them to watch<br/>
it come down.  The dog had been napping and woke up when it was<br/>
coming down.  She had to go outside and bark at it a bit.  She was<br/>
very happy to come back inside.<br/>
