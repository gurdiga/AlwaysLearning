Would it be in bad taste to email a &quot;thank you&quot; off-list?<br/>

<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine someone being upset for a personal thank-you offlist.  I&#39;ve received a few nasty grams along the way that I would have rather just had onlist -- but I can&#39;t see someone being distressed or put out for a thank you.<br/>

When I get a thank you note, it sometimes starts additional  <br/>
conversation on the side. Ideas get clarified even further for the  <br/>
note-sender. Sometimes, I can give additional information that might  <br/>
clog up the list (local stuff, state-specific info).<br/>
<br/>
It can be mutually beneficial in unrelated-to-unschooling ways;  <br/>
finding common interest on other subjects, making plans to visit,  <br/>
becoming Facebook friends &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1167857519">-=-Sometimes I read things that make me think differently or realize  <br/>
something I had never previously considered. My gut instant reaction  <br/>
in that moment is to say, &quot;wow, thanks!&quot; ... then I remember that  <br/>
that&#39;s a no-no for this list. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind anyone saying &quot;Wow, thanks!&quot; as long as they go on to  <br/>
write things that will be beneficial to others.   &quot;Thanks&quot; can be  <br/>
incorporated into some details or an interesting story--some specifics  <br/>
about why it&#39;s a &quot;wow, thanks&quot; situation.   (Not &quot;wow, thanks; I  <br/>
didn&#39;t know that; this is very interesting.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on lists where people post whole posts, with appended other  <br/>
posts, that say &quot;OMG&quot; or WTF!? or LOL or My Dog just FARTED!!<br/>
<br/>
I got a note a bit ago that said &quot;You have created a clear, deep lake  <br/>
of unschooling knowledge...&quot;  and that&#39;s pretty sweet.<br/>
What makes it clear is that it&#39;s not muddied up with chit-chat.<br/>
<br/>
Writing to someone on the side of a list isn&#39;t about list etiquette so  <br/>
much as about real-world etiquette, with an exception I&#39;ll mention in  <br/>
a minute.<br/>
<br/>
If after someone gives a speech in public you want to sidle up to him  <br/>
or her and shake hands and say &quot;That was a really great speech,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m so glad you mentioned... [something specific] that&#39;s cool.    <br/>
Following that same person home and threatening him is NOT at all cool.<br/>
<br/>
In between those two are a range of possibilities.  Offering to take  <br/>
him for coffee; handing him a business card; introducing him to  <br/>
friends of yours (which he might appreciate or might be bugging him;  <br/>
depends, and some people can read that better than others).<br/>
<br/>
Some lists are just for chit chat and dog farts and recipes and &quot;So...  <br/>
what are you making for dinner?&quot; kinds of conversations.   In those  <br/>
cases, if two people disagree about something, it&#39;s accepted for the  <br/>
list owner to suggest that if they want to discuss that (politics/ <br/>
religion/ethics) they should take it off list.  It&#39;s like sending  <br/>
teenaged boys out of of the bar if they want to fight.  It&#39;s so the  <br/>
glassware and chairs won&#39;t get broken.<br/>
<br/>
This particular room/list is designed for discussions of ethics and  <br/>
principles, so it&#39;s more appropriate to keep the discussions of those  <br/>
things on the list, because others came here to read those things.    <br/>
If someone asks a question and one list member answers it offline  <br/>
rather than on the list,  that&#39;s suspicious to me.<br/>
<br/>
But if someone says &quot;I&#39;m in Albuquerque, and...&quot; I&#39;m likely to write  <br/>
and try to hook her up with something or someone local!<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s quite an &quot;it depends&quot; situation.<br/>
Will the communication be welcome?  Will it help or hurt the  <br/>
discussion and purpose of the list to take the discussion away?<br/>
<br/>
There have been times in the past when the moderator of a discussion  <br/>
list has said &quot;you two should take this off list&quot; when someone else  <br/>
was being insanely abusive of me.   I had way less interest in being  <br/>
abused and insulted in private than I did in public.<br/>
<br/>
If I find out anyone has gone off list here to be abusive, I would be  <br/>
glad to throw the abuser off the list.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone would mind a thank-you note.<br/>
I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary.  When people write here I&#39;m pretty  <br/>
sure they know people are grateful for good ideas!<br/>

<br/>
Me neither, but if it goes on from thank you to request lengthy  <br/>
discussion or personal answers, that can be a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Joining this list isn&#39;t an agreement to answer questions privately.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s back to everyday, real-life courtesy.<br/>
