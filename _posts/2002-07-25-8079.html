 </span></blockquote>I think they&#39;re pretty okay - not like airplaines, at least - get the ones <br/>
that face each other with a table between - The armrests come up - small <br/>
people can probably lay across two seats. The seat backs go back pretty far. <br/>
You can put your head on the table - more options. And on long trips there <br/>
are observation cars. Cool.<br/>

A couple of us moms folded origami for the couple of hours it took us on a <br/>
recent train ride between Orange County, CA and San Diego. The kids sat at <br/>
another table and played some kind of elaborate card and character game.<br/>
