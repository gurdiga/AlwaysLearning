<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930172892">One of Howard Gardner&#39;s findings was that there is a talent (an intelligence, <br/>
in his terminology) some people have more of than others, and it is <br/>
&quot;intrapersonal awareness.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I do find myself curious about why, considering the several anecdotes that <br/>
were posted in this thread, you decided that I, and only I, was making <br/>
excuses for not writing.  I found it startling and, well, high-handed.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If a person doesn&#39;t want commentary, then sharing in a forum with a couple of <br/>
hundred people isn&#39;t probably the best idea for her.<br/>
<br/>
The more self knowledge one has, the better her thinking will be, and as <br/>
unschoolers our awareness of what can make or break confidence is important <br/>
to our relationships with our children and their confidence-building.<br/>
<br/>
People come here voluntarily, and tell us about their experiences.  We don&#39;t <br/>
spy on people.  Readers here commented on what had been offered up freely.<br/>
<br/>
I have a young friend who is very self-assured.  She has more assurance than <br/>
actual self, sometimes, as she is in many ways a follower, although she <br/>
denies it (loud and long). <br/>
<br/>
One day several of us were out of state visiting a friend we only see <br/>
infrequently, who reads tarot cards.  Some of us had already had cards read, <br/>
and it was one of those days and sessions in which LOTS of really profound <br/>
and useful things are being said.    The one newer, younger, member of the <br/>
group was unknown to the reader, but the rest of us were long friends.<br/>
<br/>
During the last reading, that of the younger girl, the other traveling <br/>
companions were glancing at each other with amazement and appreciation for <br/>
how on-target and clear the reading was in relation to that girl&#39;s <br/>
personality and immediate life situation.  Her reading seemed as good as all <br/>
ours put together, and ours weren&#39;t shabby!<br/>
<br/>
At the end, the girl said &quot;It sounded like you were reading for someone else <br/>
entirely.  None of that is applicable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just like her, in tone.  Very formal and distant.<br/>
<br/>
So our friend did another kind of reading, which was cold and not too <br/>
interesting, and the confident skeptical friend kinda grunted thanks, and we <br/>
all knew more about her after that day, but she didn&#39;t know any more about us <br/>
OR herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245982764">Athena, I read Joyce&#39;s comments as nurturing and caring. I&#39;ve read her posts<br/>
for awhile now, and she is one of the least snarky people around. I think<br/>
she was trying to help you see what you wrote that may have been<br/>
contributing to what sounded like a writer&#39;s block. If it wasn&#39;t helpful, it<br/>
is your right to pass on it, but she wasn&#39;t being tacky or singling you out<br/>
intentionally.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, I am here voluntarily.  I told you all about my experience with Mrs. <br/>
Andersen.  I shared my frustration at the time, and how I remember it when I <br/>
think about writing.  I didn&#39;t share any of the other things that are keeping <br/>
me from writing.  I&#39;m not sure how that invited a comment that I&#39;m looking <br/>
for an excuse not to write.  If, indeed, readers were &quot;spying&quot; (what a <br/>
strange word to use here), they would see that there is much, much more to me <br/>
than what I shared here.  They may actually have made a relevant comment, <br/>
instead of the odd armchair psychotherapy that was offered.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If I were to assume (and I&#39;m not, necessarily) that your story is supposed to <br/>
be similar to this situation, I would say this:  the difference is that you <br/>
all knew your friend.  You knew her personality, her circumstances, her <br/>
habits, her way of behaving and relating.  Whereas the person who speculated <br/>
on my &quot;excuse&quot; doesn&#39;t know me.  I&#39;m new to the group.  No one here has met <br/>
me.  No one here knows much of anything about me, except what I have shared.  <br/>
No one here knows my circumstances, my family, my resources, my personality, <br/>
my motives, or my stressors.  That&#39;s quite a big difference.  <br/>
<br/>
Those who know me have often commented that one trait I possess to a <br/>
startling degree is self-knowledge.  I&#39;m quite sure that the person who <br/>
posted about my &quot;excuse&quot; doesn&#39;t have any insight into my character that I <br/>
don&#39;t already possess.  If she were a close friend, or even just someone with <br/>
whom I interact frequently, perhaps she would.  But that&#39;s not the case.  I&#39;m <br/>
puzzled as to why she felt the need to delve into my psyche.  How odd.  <br/>

Well, we know you&#39;re defensive and you don&#39;t like other people speculating on <br/>
what you write, no matter how blatantly it seems to show something important <br/>
to you.<br/>
<br/>
We know you&#39;re willing to keep arguing in the face of calming responses.<br/>

<br/>
If you want your psyche undelved, don&#39;t share anything emotional or real.<br/>
<br/>
If you share something emotional or real, be willing to admit it after it has <br/>
spilled out!<br/>

<br/>
Yes, this is what I was thinking, only not so succinctly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When we write, or speak, we are giving other people insights into our<br/>
characters. And, self-deception being an unfortunate by-product of<br/>
membership in the human clan, there&#39;s no way to be &quot;quite sure&quot; someone<br/>
perceptive (hello, Joyce &lt;g&gt;) won&#39;t discover many things unknown to the<br/>
owner of the character in question.<br/>
