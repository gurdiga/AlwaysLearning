<div id="ygrps-yiv-934566437">Hello,<br/>
My name is Sharon.  I have been on this list for a while but I never<br/>
posted.  I was wondering if you all could help me sort something in my<br/>
head.<br/>
<br/>
I have always homeschooled.  Nine children, 26 years.  I have really<br/>
vaccilated back and forth, thinking I should DO more and then buying<br/>
some stupid cirriculum and then never using it...defaulting back to<br/>
the natural flow of our lives, facilitating the children&#39;s interest to<br/>
the best of my ability....most of the time.  My oldest at home right<br/>
now is 17 and is taking 3 classes at the high school, which she<br/>
absolutely loves and wanted to do.  She is not interested in attending<br/>
full time.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that I have experience alot more freedom the last few<br/>
years.  Most of that freedom has been letting go of religious<br/>
expectations of myself and my children AND my husband.  Even though I<br/>
would have been considered an &quot;unschooler&quot;, I was still an<br/>
authoritarian parent.  That is another story.  That has changed also.<br/>
<br/>
It is the challenge in my head right now...that I deal with.  I had to<br/>
go back to work. I drop my daughter off at school, workout, deliver<br/>
mail, pick my daughter up from school and we are home at about 11:00.<br/>
(I leave at 7:00)  My other children at home are 15, 12, 10, 6.  They<br/>
usually sleep or get up and get on the computer or play Wii.  When I<br/>
get home we read outloud (something we all enjoy and have agreed on<br/>
together) and then everyone does there own thing.  Everyone buzzes<br/>
around all day.  My &quot;job&quot; is to run here and there responding to<br/>
&quot;mommy come here&quot;, &quot;mommy come and see&quot;, &quot;mommy, look what I made&quot;,<br/>
&quot;mommy can you help with this&quot; and then all the other<br/>
mommy/wife/homemaker/home business responsibilities require.<br/>
<br/>
My question is;  Can you be a true radical unschooler and not be<br/>
available to your children all the time?  Are there things I might<br/>
consider with this type of situation?  Maybe there is no need to be<br/>
concerned at all?  Maybe part of the challenge is that I am not<br/>
&quot;needed&quot; as much as my children have grown older.  The 17, 15, and 12<br/>
year olds are avid readers.  You might get a chuckle or a sigh out of<br/>
the fact that they are enjoying the Harry Potter series on tape for<br/>
the first time because I would NOT ALLOW them when it first came out.<br/>
 They have read the Twilight series and just seem to always be DOING<br/>
something.  My 10 year old is in the VERY beginning stages of reading<br/>
and has NO interest in writing at all.  Does math in his head<br/>
amazingly.  My 17 year old is a very good writer.  Doesn&#39;t have all<br/>
the &quot;formal&quot; stuff down, but I am sure after you are done reading<br/>
this, you will see I do not either and I am a college graduate! LOL. <br/>
She is taking Japanese and loves it..  I think I am writing all this<br/>
out as part of my processing and you all, if you have read this far,<br/>
are part of it.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the listening eyes.<br/>
Sharon<br/>

just need different kinds of attention.  They are 14 and 7.<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered having official mom/child times for each individual<br/>
child?  It helps to really connect with each individual child and may<br/>
ease your mind about wether or not you are providing for each child,<br/>
what they want and need because they will have a chance to tell you.</div>

watching younger ones while you&#39;re gone.  Maybe cater to them  <br/>
sometimes too--their favorite foods, or gifts, or clean their rooms or  <br/>
do their laundry in extra nice ways, as they&#39;re making it possible for  <br/>
you to work without paying for a babysitter.<br/>
<br/>
As to learning, with that many kids there, the kids will be learning  <br/>
all kinds of things and there will be helpers if they need assistance  <br/>
or answers.<br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re busy and happy, maybe there&#39;s nothing to worry about.<br/>
The relief I feel as my children get older is balanced by regret that  <br/>
I can&#39;t spend more time with them as little kids.  (That&#39;s not very  <br/>
clearly worded, but moms of older kids might be able to rephrase for  <br/>
me.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a chart here of my careful analysis (ahem...) of how much time  <br/>
a mom should spend with a child:<br/>

<br/>
Do you have a blog?  No pressure, just thinking if writing helps you  <br/>
process, they can be wonderful, and by linking to other unschoolers&#39;  <br/>
blogs, you&#39;ll have other &quot;listening eyes.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re thinking about blogs and you want ideas or inspiration,  <br/>
there are quite a few linked on the lefthand column here:<br/>

she&#39;s independent for sure, much more than Margaux.  I would be easy to<br/>
let her be and go and do, but conscious connection makes such a big<br/>
difference in which direction she goes to do and be.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing her grow more independent really does cause me to pause and turn<br/>
toward my younger daughter and get involved in whatever she&#39;s doing,<br/>
since those young childhood years really are fleeting!  Margaux is 7<br/>
1/2, but before I know it she&#39;ll be 10 and then almost 15 and soon to be<br/>
driving like her sister.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easy to miss all those moments!  I love how unschooling gives me a<br/>
reason to really be present for all those moments, to live for them and<br/>
just really BE there!</div>

 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t have to be formally scheduled.  It could be casual, like<br/>
going on a 15 min walk, or asking one to go to the store with you.  Just<br/>
small one on one things help to check in with an individual child.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know your kids, but I know this has been really helpful to both of<br/>
my kids.  When my time and energy is split, they don&#39;t necessarily tell<br/>
me their heart and mind in those moments.  It&#39;s when I have just one<br/>
with me, that they talk and talk and talk.</div>
