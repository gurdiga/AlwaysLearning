<div id="ygrps-yiv-1667688822">this go along the lines of what you mentioned &quot;runing in the house and <br/>
getting hurt&quot;  <br/>
We were at the baseball field the other day and my 3yo was playing on <br/>
the blechers now I don&#39;t think this is a good idea but instead of <br/>
telling her this I just turned around saw what she was doing and told <br/>
her that there was cement under the blechers and if she fell she would <br/>
get hurt so be carefull. (may I add that the other mom there just <br/>
rolled her eyes at me and looked real nerous)  I stood near my <br/>
daughter and watched her but she was fine she didn&#39;t fall and was <br/>
carful.  An exsample of something that could have been a fight but <br/>
turned out to be just her plsying and having fun.  Now she could have <br/>
fallen and has on other occasions and she is helped up by me and <br/>
offered some help.  I&#39;m thinking the risk is sometime worth it to take <br/>
KWIM.  granted not always but more times than you think !<br/>
