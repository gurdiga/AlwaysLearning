 </span></blockquote>Well, when we moved last fall, we finally decided<br/>
(after one finger painting + rug incident during<br/>
bedroom painting, and several other mishaps) to move<br/>
the kids and I first.  DH finished up the painting,<br/>
repairs, cleaning, and packing, and then came along a<br/>
few weeks later.  We canped out in the apartment at<br/>
our new town with some air mattresses and folding<br/>
chairs, kids table to eat on, folding bookcase and a<br/>
few essentials until he arrived.<br/>
