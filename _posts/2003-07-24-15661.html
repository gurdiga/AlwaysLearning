<div id="ygrps-yiv-563236814">Thank you all for the post-reply to my request.<br/>
<br/>
So it was all a dream on my part.  I wonder where I picked up that idea that<br/>
there were a movie where the &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; resumed it.  Maybe I was in<br/>
a group and someone were talking about an unforgettable movie while the<br/>
&quot;Monkees&quot; songs were on.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!  At least I have one of my&quot; longing&quot;  satisfied.<br/>
<br/>
love and peace</div>
