<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801863954">Say your kid falls at the ice rink and needs a few stitches in his chin.  You <br/>
go to the ER at 9 p.m. and do the admission thing and sign the releases, pay <br/>
the co-pay and hand over your insurance card.  A few weeks later you get a <br/>
statement for the total amount.  When you call to inquire if insurance has been <br/>
filed, you find it has not.  Furthermore, because of the new &quot;HIPA&quot; policy, <br/>
they cannot send you a detailed bill because they are protecting your privacy! <br/>
<br/>
However, you can *come into the office* and sign yet another RELEASE, that <br/>
authorizes them to give you the information you&#39;re entitled to and that you <br/>
should be provided upon exit from the ER!  <br/>
<br/>
They expect me to pay for service ($378) and I don&#39;t even know what they&#39;re <br/>
charging me for.  Remember when the health insurance companies were imploring <br/>
everyone to check their hospital bills because they were often overcharged or <br/>
outright wrong?  I don&#39;t even pay for car repairs until I see an itemized bill! <br/>

you see a detailed bill?  and save a copy for the credit bureau in case it <br/>
comes to that, and to return with EACH payment you make in case they charge you <br/>
late fees down the line.<br/>
