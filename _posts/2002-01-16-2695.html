<div id="ygrps-yiv-1226698549">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; We had a baby try to nurse on my  husband.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter once latched onto dh&#39;s collar bone and<br/>
gave him a hickey.  <br/>
He<br/>
called her rooting when he held her &quot;Looking for lunch<br/>
in all the wrong<br/>
places.&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>

LOL!! I have a great photo of Tamzin sucking on Chris&#39;<br/>
nose! She looks thoroughly perplexed, like, &quot;How come<br/>
