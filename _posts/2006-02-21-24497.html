<br/>
I have cause to sell my remaining book stock, and some of you have  <br/>
said you wanted to get a copy of Moving a Puddle for friends or  <br/>
relatives.  This would be a good time to do that.   Write to me,  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a> if you&#39;ve been meaning to buy one but  <br/>
haven&#39;t.   Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
The book is described here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook">http://sandradodd.com/puddlebook</a><br/>
<br/>
For people who already have this, that page also has a link to Rue  <br/>
Kream&#39;s book.<br/>
Some people who won&#39;t read webpages, or consider webages to be less  <br/>
&quot;real,&quot; books of real paper sometime carry more weight (physically,  <br/>
literally &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
For those who are fine with websites and want to see what&#39;s new on  <br/>
mine, the last several newly-unveiled or in-progress pages are linked  <br/>
here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/blog">http://sandradodd.com/blog</a><br/>
also there are links to some other people&#39;s unschooling pages<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1262403779">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering whether the Puddles book of articles are different to the articles on your website?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much<br/>
