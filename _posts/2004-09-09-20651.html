  I was contacted to day by a mom in SC who wants to learn more about  <br/>
  unschooling. Her issue is that her family is Muslim. She&#39;s looking to  connect with <br/>
  other Muslim unschooling families. The only one I know is  Asmaa---where are you?<br/>
<br/>
  If there&#39;s someone els willing to talk with her, I&#39;ll forward you her info.  <br/>
  Please let me know!<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks!<br/>
