<div id="ygrps-yiv-1196418451">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been home schooling(borderline relaxed/unschooling)my kids- 16,<br/>
14, & 11 (I have a 3yo and 1 yo also) for 6 yrs. We have always been<br/>
relaxed in our philosophy of &quot;true education&quot; and have been drifting<br/>
more and more towards unschooling (mostly by default-----hence my 2<br/>
toddlers!)I&#39;ve read tons of great books on unschooling and I just<br/>
love how it all comes together.<br/>
<br/>
I think I must be in &quot;panic mode&quot; though..... my daughter&#39;s in the<br/>
middle of doing her &quot;Key to Algebra&quot; book 4 (almost done----there are<br/>
6 to go)and although she is capable of doing the<br/>
algebra(getting almost all, if not all of the answers correct---when<br/>
she gets it), she<br/>
keeps telling me she doesn&#39;t care about it and doesn&#39;t see why she<br/>
needs to do it. As I said, she can do it, but doesn&#39;t seem to retain<br/>
it well either . I guess I&#39;m wondering if she&#39;s right and I should<br/>
just let her quit the algebra. Maybe I&#39;m just paranoid about it<br/>
because I HAD to do it in high school and I feel like she should do<br/>
it too, just in case she needs it---I know----stupid!. We are going<br/>
to put together a homebrewed (sorta traditional--<br/>
--how it&#39;s presented, at least) transcript at the end. So far she&#39;s<br/>
accrued about 1-1/4 credits worth of math----pre-algebra and algebra<br/>
combined (in 2 years).<br/>
<br/>
Her interests are:photography, cooking, irish<br/>
dancing,cats,and piano. I doubt highly she&#39;s going to a 4 yr <br/>
university---<br/>
-probably either a trade school, apprenticeship, or possibly<br/>
community college at some point.She probably won&#39;t be taking SAT&#39;s or<br/>
ACT tests either (it would MAJORLY stress her out anyway-----<br/>
-she&#39;s a very high-strung,emotional,sensitive kid who also has <br/>
Asperger&#39;s Syndrome....and she&#39;s 16....that&#39;s hard enough ). <br/>
So.....tell me why I&#39;m torturing her<br/>
with this math?? (We live in Idaho too, which is completely hands-off<br/>
when it comes to homeschoolers)<br/>
<br/>
Someone knock some sense into me...please!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
God bless,<br/>

<br/>
Please let her quit the algebra if that is what she wants!  If she is<br/>
getting the right answers and not &quot;retaining&quot;, then she will be able<br/>
to jump through this hoop later in life when/if she chooses a<br/>
degree/apprenticeship/training program where this is required.<br/>

math education (go figure...).  There are plenty of kids who have been<br/>
through the traditional 13 years of public school and still cannot do<br/>
basic math.  I figure in a cynical kind of way that I certainly cannot<br/>
do any worse with unschooling and in a more practical way, that my<br/>
children will certainly do better through acquiring mathematical<br/>
concepts through living.  A concrete example: by knitting, you will<br/>
learn the types of patterns and logical thinking skills that are<br/>
associated with algebra.  Does that mean I will make all my children<br/>
learn knitting? Nope.  But it is sure a part of why I like knitting as<br/>
a math geek - I love to sort out the patterns and create something.  I<br/>
LOVE math, my husband is a physicist by degree and software developer<br/>
by trade - it is hard to let go of what WE thought our children NEEDED<br/>
to learn.<br/>

alternatives to admission for the SAT/ACT. Just wanted to show there<br/>
are other options even if she chooses to go the 4 year college route<br/>
some day.<br/>

<br/>

concepts in everything you listed as her interests.  If you let go of<br/>
the textbook math, she will have more time to pursue the real life<br/>
versions of it.<br/>

<br/>
It was written: &quot;I guess I&#39;m wondering if she&#39;s right and I should just let her quit the algebra. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
To me, it&#39;s not a matter of &#39;letting her quit Algebra&#39;... it&#39;s a matter of stopping the pressure, harrassment, etc. However your &#39;not letting her quit&#39; is showing up....   To me, you don&#39;t get to decide how things go for her... but you do get to decide how you&#39;re going to treat her... <br/>
<br/>
So, why are you &#39;torturing&#39; her?  It&#39;s my guess that you&#39;re afraid.... and it could be that you&#39;re afraid for her future or afraid of criticism or afraid of failing her or afraid of losing praise... OR, as has been true in my case, afraid of something totally unrelated and am thus exercising control in an area that is much simpler than facing the other difficulty....<br/>
<br/>
All just guesses and projections... : )<br/>
<br/>
And, the solution?  Breathe... chill... do something fun together... and put the books away for a while.... when she&#39;s interested/motivate, she can finish those books in a week....or never touch them again....   it&#39;s not a big deal.... <br/>

Good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-282456476">Thank you all so much....especially for being pretty &quot;gentle&quot; with me <br/>
in your responses.<br/>
<br/>
Yes....I think a lot of the reasons why I suggest she do algebra <br/>
(among other things----although I really don&#39;t pressure her, I am <br/>
pretty low key) is just fear. Math is a huge one for me too. I spent <br/>
2 years doing algebra in high school and finally passed with a &quot;B&quot;. <br/>
Do I remember most of it?? NO WAY!!! So, I had my dh show her how to <br/>
do some of it. I think some of the fear, too, is that she doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to pursue a lot of &quot;intellectual&quot; kinds of things.....please <br/>
don&#39;t misunderstand me.....my daughter is very smart, but she just <br/>
doesn&#39;t pursue things such as history, science, etc (totally <br/>
uninterested in most of it). She&#39;s content just cooking different <br/>
things for our family (which is wonderful), reading magazines & teen <br/>
christian fiction,shoppping for clothes, and practicing her irish <br/>
dancing. That being said though....she begins comparing herself to <br/>
her friends who are homeschooled very traditionally, who are studying <br/>
for PSAT&#39;s, doing high level math, etc, etc and she starts stressing <br/>
out because she&#39;s constantly comparing herself to everyone else (and <br/>
saying she feels stupid). She has a huge self-confidence problem as <br/>
well. I try hard to tell her that she&#39;s very smart and that there are <br/>
different kinds of smart. Everyone has their own unique and God-given <br/>
abilities.<br/>
<br/>
She decided to go ahead and finish her book 4 of her algebra (they <br/>
are only about 30-40 pgs long)because she doesn&#39;t like to leave <br/>
things unfinished. I&#39;ll ask her if she wants to take a break after <br/>
that and perhaps reevalute in the fall (maybe do some consumer math <br/>
or something like that,if she&#39;s interested). Maybe I&#39;ll sit down with <br/>
her and talk to her about what she can see herself doing later on in <br/>
her life. <br/>
<br/>
This is the 1st time I will have &quot;graduated&quot; any child of mine and so <br/>
I guess I&#39;m a bit nervous, especially if my relatives ask what <br/>
college she&#39;ll be going to and what not.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thank you for your advice....feel free to jump in and add any <br/>
more....I could use it.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
Danielle<br/>

intellectual things she isn&#39;t pursuing. It&#39;s things that resemble  <br/>
school that she isn&#39;t pursuing.<br/>
<br/>
Your homework assignment ;-) is to see the intellectual, the  <br/>
creative, the life skills in what your daughter *is* pursuing.  <br/>
Creative people people created the things she&#39;s interested in.<br/>

&gt; doesn&#39;t pursue things such as history, science, etc (totally<br/>
&gt; uninterested in most of it)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why should she? That&#39;s an honest question. How would it enhance her  <br/>
right now life? How would a more *academic* pursuit of those enhance  <br/>
even her future life? I&#39;ve blissfully forgotten most of what they  <br/>
tried to cram into me about history in school. I&#39;m fairly confident  <br/>
that 99% of what I remember of history comes from living life, just  <br/>
absorbing it from movies and books and jokes and cartoons.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t make them learn history (or math or science or literature  <br/>
or ...) but by forcing it on them we can make them avoid it in real  <br/>
life.<br/>

but suspect it might be because *you* don&#39;t trust the unschooling  <br/>
process.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes people are asking for reassurance but if that&#39;s not  <br/>
working, rather than arguing with her -- which tends to make people  <br/>
hold onto what they believe even tighter -- ask her why. Ask her if  <br/>
she can think of ways to help her feel better. And *you* find ways to  <br/>
help her feel better. Cooking classes? Offering cooking classes  <br/>
herself to younger homeschoolers?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It may be a personality thing but it&#39;s reinforced in this society  <br/>
that finishing is good and quitting is bad.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a much more useful life skill to learn to assess when something  <br/>
is taking more from us than it&#39;s giving back.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (maybe do some consumer math<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That will just reinforce that she&#39;s inadequate. Drop the idea of a  <br/>
chunk of information you need to get into her. Did you need to get  <br/>
English  into her or did she pull it into her because it was useful  <br/>
for her in pursuing what she was interested in as a child?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832892989">Thank you for your very insightful response!<br/>
<br/>
Ughhhhh.....<br/>
it&#39;s just so conflicting in my mind though. I guess, with my kids, I <br/>
want<br/>
them to at least know the basics, ie: math (not necessarily algebra),<br/>
grammar, spelling, etc. (tools, as I see them)so they CAN pursue<br/>
their interests. Does that make sense? I guess, with some kids, they<br/>
might pursue the basics on their own, but my kids always needed a<br/>
little &quot;push.&quot; (doing a spelling and grammar workbook).<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s a matter of trust and maybe I&#39;m not there completely<br/>
because my kids don&#39;t always seem motivated by more &quot;academic&quot;<br/>
things (or how I perceive as academic). I&#39;ve been reading more and<br/>
more books on unschooling, so<br/>
perhaps I&#39;ll relax a bit more (which I thought I already was).<br/>
<br/>
This will be the 1st time I will have &quot;graduated&quot; a child of mine and <br/>
so I guess this whole thing just makes me nervous. You look at all <br/>
the moms who are having their kids preparing to take SAT&#39;s and all <br/>
the other standardized tests and such (and I know....deep down they <br/>
are a bunch of bolony....for lack of a better word)and maybe it makes <br/>
me feel like my kids should be doing the same thing(although I don&#39;t <br/>
tell my kids this). Maybe I&#39;M the one feeling inadaquate and I&#39;m <br/>
subconciously passing it on to my kids.<br/>
<br/>
As I said earlier, I will be putting a transcript together (probably <br/>
along with a narrative) for her and just wondering what I&#39;ll put on <br/>
it, if she doesn&#39;t complete more &quot;traditional&quot; classes. I know, not <br/>
very unschooly of me, but I just think that a more traditional route <br/>
might be easier for school people to understand if she does decide to <br/>
pursue college at some point. I have read some of Alison Mckee&#39;s <br/>
books on how to put together portfolios..... but with 5 kids, I don&#39;t <br/>
know how easy this would be for me to do. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, sorry for rambling here. I&#39;m just trying to do what&#39;s best <br/>
for her and just don&#39;t know how to go about it all.<br/>
<br/>
Please set my mind straight, because obviously, I still have a lot to <br/>
learn. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466691640">-=-I guess, with my kids, I<br/>
want<br/>
them to at least know the basics, ie: math (not necessarily algebra),<br/>
grammar, spelling, etc. (tools, as I see them)so they CAN pursue<br/>
their interests. Does that make sense? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense that you would state that you guess (with your kids)  <br/>
you want them (at least)...<br/>
<br/>
Look how qualified that statement was.  It just goes on and on.  When  <br/>
one&#39;s writing is very tentative and qualified, it probably  means her  <br/>
thought and understanding are even MORE tentative and qualified.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what you mean to ask is whether you need to give them tools or  <br/>
whether they can create and discover their own.<br/>
<br/>
Pretend you asked that.<br/>
<br/>
The answer to to the first part is no, you don&#39;t need to give them  <br/>
tools.  They can create and discover them on their own.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;ve been reading more and more books on unschooling, so perhaps  <br/>
I&#39;ll relax a bit more (which I thought I already was).-=-<br/>

There&#39;s the beginning of an unfinished page.  I&#39;m glad you reminded  <br/>
me of it.<br/>
<br/>

The two pages above are provided in response to this:  &quot;I&#39;ve been  <br/>
reading more and more books on unschooling, so perhaps I&#39;ll relax a  <br/>
bit more (which I thought I already was).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you should read fewer books on unschooling and try the things  <br/>
they recommend.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t an academic subject that can be learned from  <br/>
books.  There will be a test, but it&#39;s a practical test of action and  <br/>
attitude over a period of time.  It&#39;s not an easy test; most people  <br/>
fail, honestly.  So if you want a good challenge, see how you can do  <br/>
at unschooling *really* and not just at reading about it.<br/>
<br/>
If you wanted to dance, how many books about dance would you read  <br/>
before you started moving around in dancer-like ways?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270561527">I guess, with some kids, they<br/>
might pursue the basics on their own, but my kids always needed a<br/>
little &quot;push.&quot; (doing a spelling and grammar workbook).<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yo son, who has not &quot;pursued the basics on his own,&quot; was watching t.v. with us the <br/>
other night, and after seeing some text on the screen paused the show and, out of the blue <br/>
said, &quot;Oh, I get it--if a name ends in an &quot;s&quot; then you just add an apostrophe at the end <br/>
instead of &quot;apostrophe s.&quot;  No grammar workbooks or lessons or even a discussion of <br/>
possessive anything or other, just life.  I can still remember the multiple, boring worksheets I <br/>
had to fill out on the very subject!<br/>
<br/>
And the t.v. show we were watching was a reality t.v. show--bottom of the barrel in many <br/>
people&#39;s books. lol<br/>
