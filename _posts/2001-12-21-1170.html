&lt;&lt; According to the Catholic Church, ... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
She already qualified it as &quot;according to the Catholic Church.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In the medieval literature, poetry, epiphany carols (epiphany is all rolled <br/>
into Christmas for us, but it was celebrated in late Spring, I think--when <br/>
Gabriel came to tell Mary she was pregnant), Mary is referred to a a &quot;pure <br/>
virgin&quot; and &quot;virgin most pure.&quot;  Maybe the purity was generalized to her <br/>
whole life.  I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I think the immaculate part developed gradually to explain why Jesus could be <br/>
perfect if he were half real human.  So they downgrade Mary from full human <br/>
status to a clean vessel used by God to deliver his package to mankind.<br/>
<br/>
The Marianist Movement in medieval Europe was in some ways the birth of Mary. <br/>
 In the Bible she&#39;s not a major character, but in Europe for all kinds of <br/>
reasons people stab guesses at there came a movement to elevate Mary and so <br/>
stories were added for various reasons (revelations from God and other kinds <br/>
of miracles).<br/>
<br/>
I just happen to have read this this morning, on a trivia calendar (Forgotten <br/>
English, which is never on the right page, and today was on October 23):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Feast Day of St. Elfelda, who was called upon in the tenth century to <br/>
provide breakfast for the traveling Saxon King Athelstan and his men.  She <br/>
had enough beer to fill their horn cups only once, but miraculously, after <br/>
praying to the Virgin, she was able to give them each as much morning <br/>
libation as they could drink, which not infrequently amounted to half a <br/>
gallon per person.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I need to forward this to the mom who complained that it was anti-Christian <br/>
to say the Catholics took, rights away from the Viking women.  These are the <br/>
same times and the same Christians she was defending--those who pray to the <br/>
Virgin Mary so that soldiers can drink half a gallon of miracle beer for <br/>
breakfast.  Baptists would love to hate THAT.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re going to a Viking exhibit at the Los Angeles County Natural History <br/>
Museum. This woman did us a favor - we got hooked, looking up some of the <br/>
(mis)information she passed on. She said, &quot;OKay, so maybe women lost some of <br/>
their power when Christianity took over, but at least the could SURVIVE since <br/>
the Christians got rid of human sacrifice.&quot; She repeated that a bunch of <br/>
times- implying that women were routinely in danger of being sacrificed to <br/>
the heathen gods. <br/>
<br/>
We haven&#39;t found any information to support that at all. Even animal <br/>
sacrifice seems to have been rare - and the only mention of human sacrifice <br/>
we&#39;ve found is that sometimes a King might have been killed when things <br/>
weren&#39;t going well. Seems like women had it pretty good in that culture - <br/>
could own property, had basic civil rights, took their own dowry back with <br/>
them if they left their husbands, could choose themselves to leave their <br/>
husbands. <br/>
<br/>
It is just amazing how we humans can delude ourselves and close our minds and <br/>
just choose to believe things in spite of evidence to the contrary or in the <br/>
absence of any actual information. Just amazing. I&#39;m sure we&#39;re all doing it, <br/>
to some extent or another. <br/>

<br/>
Christianity is BASED on human sacrifice.  <br/>
And cannibalism.<br/>
And they are more adept than should be believed at covering that over with a <br/>
veil (a little white veil over a box on an altar) and pointing the <br/>
human-sacrifice and cannibalistic blood-drinking at OTHER people--Mayans, <br/>
vague African tribes, vague South Pacific Islanders.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m being facetious, but sex is SO tied up with sin in the Catholic church, <br/>
especially the medieval church we&#39;re talking about, that monks have been <br/>
known to cut their parts off, and fathers have killed daughters for not being <br/>
virgins.  And when the topic is virgin birth, but only the Catholics believe <br/>
in Mary&#39;s immaculate condition, it&#39;s not obvious to the protestants what you <br/>
could be talking about.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not that much about Mary in the Bible, but there is probably more <br/>
about Mary in  Catholic church lore and belief than there is about Jesus.   <br/>

What are the words to the rosary then, if not a prayer to Mary??  Some big <br/>
beads get &quot;Our Father&quot; (that&#39;s the Lord&#39;s Prayer, for Protestants), but the <br/>
little beads are &quot;Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee, blessed <br/>

Mother of God, pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death. Amen.&quot;<br/>

One prays to Mary or the saints to ask them to sort of pass your message<br/>
along, at least according to the Catholicism I grew up in. I was with the<br/>

high school.<br/>

asking for assistance on a less important issue.  When anything is lost, I<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787074932">Maybe the language is a bit of a technicality...though it breeds<br/>
misunderstanding.  I know the Hail, Mary is often thought of as a prayer.<br/>
But what does hail mean...isn&#39;t  it merely a greeting.  Catholics do believe<br/>
in having a special &#39;devotion&#39; to Mary,  but prayer and &#39;adoration&#39; are for<br/>
God alone.<br/>
    Other faiths that believe in eternal life speak with those passed on,<br/>
don&#39;t they.  And does anyone consider it prayer when they &quot;talk with&quot;<br/>
deceased loved ones,  or encounter them in a dream,  or feel their presence?<br/>
S<br/>
PS.  I know this may be somewhat sensitive  for you at this time. I mean no<br/>
offense and sincerely hope you are doing well with recent personal events.<br/>
