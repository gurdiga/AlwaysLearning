&lt;&lt; &gt;Choose Your Own Damned Harry Potter Adventure isn&#39;t too bad, as I recall.<br/>

Where is this? &gt;&gt;<br/>

There are more sordid things you might want to avoid.  The first page of <br/>
choose your own sex act is this, and having an iMac, I like the second pickup <br/>
line :<br/>
<br/>
Your saga begins in a commercial establishment licensed for beverages, <br/>
alcholic, the sale of; and intended for socialization, interpersonal, leading <br/>
to sexual encounters, classification desperate, sub-classification shameful. <br/>
In other words, a pick-up bar. And lo! There&#39;s a member of the appropriate <br/>
sex who fits your minimal standards of attractiveness and personal hygiene <br/>
now! What well-practiced opening line do you use on him or her? <br/>
<br/>
*   &quot;If I made an obnoxious, sophomoric pun about your body, would you hold <br/>
it against me?&quot; <br/>
*   &quot;Much like the iMac, I come in five colors.&quot; <br/>
*   &quot;You look like you need a friend&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, that&#39;s not as bad as the first page of the Pokemon <br/>
adventure:<br/>
<br/>
     <br/>
You are Big Bertha, novice Pokémon trainer. Yous is your life&#39;s ambition. You <br/>
don&#39;t have many friends. You have arrived with two Pokémon of your own, <br/>
Legless (a squirrel-like thing with no legs) and Yuckipoo (a rabbit-shaped <br/>
creature who likes to fling poo). You are standing on the beach, what would <br/>
you like to do first? <br/>
<br/>
*   Dig randomly in the sand <br/>
*   Look under that out-of-place rock <br/>
*   Go back to the ship and see if anything&#39;s hiding on board<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They also have the Alanis Morisette Lyric generator, which isn&#39;t nasty <br/>
(unless you fill it in as such; it&#39;s a kind of sort of MadLibs situation):   <br/>
