<div id="ygrps-yiv-253807890">&quot;They type not very grammarifically.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was Holly, of some adult friends of hers who never punctuate and  <br/>
aren&#39;t particular about spelling.  Holly writes better than they do.  <br/>
She didn&#39;t have the word &quot;grammatically&quot; at hand, maybe, or maybe  <br/>
&quot;grammarifically&quot; stated exactly what she was feeling.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
A follow-up on a comment on someone we know with a PhD who is quite  <br/>
clueless about a lot of things (mother of an ex boyfriend of hers).<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re not smart, all the school in the world won&#39;t make you smart.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Neither of these is important, just half funny and half profound.<br/>
