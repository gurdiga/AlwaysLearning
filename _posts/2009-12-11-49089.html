<div id="ygrps-yiv-477011000">Hi there!<br/>
<br/>
My name is Nicole and I have one child, a son named Fisher, who is going to<br/>
be three years old next month. The issue that has been bothering me lately<br/>
concerns my wanting him to finally ditch the diapers and use the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I am fully aware that the desire for him to use the toilet instead of<br/>
wearing diapers is really all about my wish to stop changing diapers. He&#39;s<br/>
perfectly content wearing them (and has said so to me all along), despite<br/>
resisting having them changed pretty much every time. He has sat on the<br/>
toilet a number of times, and even peed on occasion without noticing or<br/>
thinking about it. Other than using it to avoid getting in the bath, though,<br/>
Fisher has no interest in using the toilet to eliminate.<br/>
<br/>
I know I can&#39;t &quot;train&quot; him to go and that it&#39;s really just a waiting game.<br/>
But I was wondering if anyone here had some advice on how to cope with the<br/>
waiting.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time :).<br/>

<br/>
Would more baths help?  More water play?  Would it help to put a video  <br/>
player in there or let him take a gameboy or whatever might keep him  <br/>
sitting longer?<br/>
<br/>
I know when a child is three a month can seem forever to the mom, but  <br/>
to a kid the day seems like a month, so he won&#39;t understand your  <br/>
anxiety.  The more you relax, the more relaxation there will be on  <br/>
your team--between you and the child.<br/>
<br/>
One of mine was in diapers at night for nine years, but not in the  <br/>
daytime.  Don&#39;t aim at &quot;no diapers&quot; so much as at peace and love.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-538332196">Is your wish about you having to change diapers or about him still wearing<br/>
diapers?<br/>
Get some pull-ups and let him dress himself (maybe coming to you to request<br/>
a diaper if he is having a BM).<br/>
He might like pull-ups if that gives him more control ............if he can<br/>
pull them off and replace on his own.<br/>
Would that meet your need of having him ditch the diapers?<br/>
If he expresses that he is content with diapers and he resists pull ups then<br/>
perhaps speak to yourself that parenting a three year old (next month)<br/>
includes helping with dressing and bathing just as much as helping with food<br/>
and shelter.<br/>
<br/>
If it bothers you immensely, then perhaps target age 3 as a time to talk<br/>
about being &quot;partners&quot; and working together for solutions that work for both<br/>
of you.    Some of the same ideas used when wanting to stop suckling might<br/>
be helpful in stopping changing diapers.<br/>
<br/>
You might also consider that &quot;ditch the diapers&quot;  and &quot;use the toilet&quot;  are<br/>
two separate conditions.   Both of my now adult sons were &quot;house broken&quot;<br/>
long before they were &quot;toilet trained&quot;.   We lived rurally and they treated<br/>
the outdoors as one large litter box......until older boys showed them about<br/>
using hay bales for &quot;targets&quot;  or using leaves to cover up turds!   They did<br/>
listen and understand that behaviors that were okay on the farm might not be<br/>
okay at a shopping mall or at someone else&#39;s suburban house.<br/>

I used to make that distinction because a newly 2 is very different than an almost 3, they change so much in that year.  It&#39;s also true that a newly 3 is very different from and almost 4. It doesn&#39;t change the fact that a 2 yr old or a 3 yr old that is wearing a diaper and not ready to use the toilet should be wearing a diaper and not forced to use the toilet.  <br/>

<br/>
You know when I read the post I really got the feeling that the OP is not <br/>
really looking for strategies to get her toddler on to the potty. Certainly <br/>
some good ideas on that have been forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
However, what I read she was looking for was strategies for building up her <br/>
own patience, and perhaps some reassurance that yes, the end of diapers will <br/>
come one day. I really don&#39;t think she plans on pushing him or forcing the <br/>
issue, and I would discourage any moves in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding of potty learning is that the boys generally, on average, <br/>
stay in diapers a little longer than girls generally, on average. Almost <br/>
three is not remotely &quot;late&quot; or abnormal. Almost 4 is not particularly or <br/>
extremely &quot;late&quot; or abnormal either.<br/>
<br/>
I increase my patience with breathing and by pausing to think through the <br/>
possible (probable) consequences of not choosing patience in that moment - <br/>
usually an angry and disappointed child. I even think about how much I would <br/>
miss her if she weren&#39;t with me any more.<br/>
<br/>
What happens if you make a concious effort to embrace patience? Even post <br/>
some little notes about it around. A mantra may help.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Jayn is 10 I can barely remember the days of diapers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1993111165">When I&#39;ve been frustrated with one of my kids for something I imagined  <br/>
they should do better or faster or sooner, my best &quot;mantra&quot; was more a  <br/>
vision, and a reminder to myself that they could walk. They could  <br/>
hear.  They could see.  There are parents whose kids will be in  <br/>
diapers for life.  And that pause helped me chill right out.  Still  <br/>
does sometimes, same kinds of thoughts.  Now sometimes it&#39;s something  <br/>
like &quot;Oh, Marty doesn&#39;t have a job...&quot;  but he&#39;s not in Afghanistan as  <br/>
his friend Liam is.  Kirby didn&#39;t get as big a raise as he had thought  <br/>
he might.  But Kirby has a job.<br/>
<br/>
Gratitude and reality check, in whatever form they might take in  <br/>
whichever life, can be good tools to keep handy.<br/>

<br/>
I was saying that my kids used the potty very early but had many accidents along the way.<br/>
My sister&#39;s boys  started using when they were 4 and older and  it was a like one day they woke up and decided they were done and never had accidents.<br/>
So you maybe be done with diapers but running around  with extra clothes and worried about accidents that can happen anywhere!. <br/>
Hope this helps your perspective!<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think kids &quot;decide&quot; this.  I think they develop an awareness  <br/>
of their bodies signals at some point and then know what to do.  And  <br/>
if it seems to be something people do, they want to do it.  Sometimes  <br/>
if the kids have never seen an adult go to the bathroom it&#39;s going to  <br/>
be harder, I think.  And if the parents treat the kids &quot;like kids,&quot;  <br/>
like babies, sometimes it makes them want to remain babies in some  <br/>
ways, and if the diaper is the symbol of babyhood some kids stall  <br/>
about letting it go.<br/>
<br/>
If kids WANT to be like the parents (which I think is natural, if it&#39;s  <br/>
not screwed up somehow) that can make it easier.<br/>
<br/>
But no matter what kids want or &quot;decide,&quot; there needs to be a certain  <br/>
maturity and awareness, for potty, reading, bike riding...<br/>

Yes you are right. Decide is not the word I should have used. I was just thinking about my nephew that at 4 one day turned to his mother and said he was done with diapers and never looked back.<br/>
I am sure he saw his parents using the bathroom many times. Being that my sister and I are Brazilians and  there are not as many hang ups about naked bodies in our culture as I see in  the US were we live.<br/>
So when my nephew was ready to used the potty  there was no looking back for him.<br/>

You could be right!  What increased my patience in this area, was buying pull ups.  I had been using cloth diapers and then went on to using the thick cotton training pants with the rubber pant liners.  I was frustrated with how long it was taking and having to wash those things long after I &quot;thought&quot; she (Margaux) should be using regular underwear and the toilet.  I didn&#39;t want to feel frustrated with her, so I switched to pull ups, something that I could throw away.  It was miraculous!  The ones that could be re-attatched at the side were the best.<br/>
 <br/>
I never had this issue with Chamille, she was completely out of diapers just before she turned 2.  She was so tiny her pants had a hard time staying up without those diapers!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.   And also think it worth pointing out to both parents and kids<br/>
that the certain maturity varies greatly even when there are shared<br/>
genetics.    With toilet activities there is also a difference between<br/>
waking and sleeping.   Like Sandra I had one boy who would pee in his sleep<br/>
past age 10.   We made nighttime adjustments since this was before the<br/>
marketing of  larger pull-ups. The only time he had &quot;accidents&quot; in the<br/>
daytime was when he was asleep or so sick and feverish that he might as well<br/>
have been sleeping.     I had another son who stayed dry at night before age<br/>
two.  If he was wearing a diaper it would be dry when he awoke but within 20<br/>
minutes it would be saggingly soggy.     When I remembered, I would suggest<br/>
that he try to empty his bladder into the toilet or outside but it was more<br/>
my knowing that the flood was coming than him being able to control it or<br/>
recognizing when he &quot;needed to go&quot;.     Both those boys were handling ALL<br/>
their toileting issues long before they were teenagers :-).<br/>
<br/>
Early bike rider might be late or early pottier.   Early pottier might be<br/>
late or early reader.   Endless (or almost) variations and permutations when<br/>
it comes to attaining developmental &quot;milestones&quot;.<br/>

Yes, it&#39;s funny, too, how they find their own schedule for this kind of  <br/>
thing.  Jess was just not interested in the potty and I must admit I was  <br/>
starting to be concerned when she turned 3.  She was about 3-and-a-half  when <br/>
she changed - literally overnight - from nappies/diapers to using  the toilet. <br/>
 She had quite a nasty bout of flu, and the  fever meant that the nappies <br/>
were particularly uncomfortable and chafing.   So she got rid of them, <br/>
decided to use the toilet from then on and was  immediately dry even through the <br/>
night.   Since then, I&#39;ve  heard similar stories from other mothers, so I <br/>
suppose some kids just prefer to  be absolutely ready before they&#39;re willing to <br/>
even engage with the  process.<br/>

Might it be a perfectionism thing?  That never occurred to me until  <br/>
reading Jude&#39;s post, but Holly read kinda that way too:  Can&#39;t read;  <br/>
can&#39;t read a word; oh!  Judy Blume.  Next?  Stephen King.<br/>
<br/>
Some kids don&#39;t try to ride a bike until they are able to do all the  <br/>
bike riding bits, and basically get on and go.  Others will try early  <br/>
and fall a lot.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the important thing for unschooling is to know it&#39;s different  <br/>
for different people and not to be too proud or too discouraged, but  <br/>
to be that child&#39;s supportive partner and ally.<br/>

I have one son who was 10 years old before he could ride a bike. Then his younger brother was 4 with training wheels when he saw the teens down the street ramping their bikes. He was determined to ramp his bike. I told him that he could not ramp a bike with training wheels. So he told me to take them off. I tried to talk him out of it but he insisted I take them off. And you know with in 1 hour of removing the training wheels he could ramp his bike. The same kid can read and spell anything but writing is like torture. I am slowly learning to let go and trust my kidlets to learn what they need when they need it. <br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about waiting for the potty training. All but one of my kids was a full 3 years old when they potty trained and for all of them it happened over a couple of days. I have lots of friends who pushed it on their kids and they and their kids were miserable. My Mantra over the years for things that I do not have much control over is &quot;This to shall pass&quot; before you know it this thing that is frustrating you will have passed and you will not even realize it. And your baby boy will be 16 and about to take his driving test you wont even remember his potty training days. <br/>

I was seeking advice in September about my just-turned 4 year old because I had a baby in July and 3 kids in diapers.  I thought I was going to go nuts with impatience and couldn&#39;t figure out why he wasn&#39;t ready? what would ready look like? what was my role? etc etc.  Then, a few weeks after his fourth birthday, he spent most of the day with a 3 year old friend of his and came home that day and was done with diapers completely. He then had 2 weeks of daily pants-pooping which almost drove me over the edge since I was dealing with a colicky (5-6 hours a day of inconsolable screaming) baby. One morning I watched him like a hawk for signs he needed to poop, then went to make lunch and he pooped the minute I left the room.  I didn&#39;t handle it well and got very upset, but something clicked in him and he &quot;got it&quot; about pooping in the toilet too.  Now it&#39;s been 3ish months and he hasn&#39;t had a single day time accident and only one night time accident.<br/>
<br/>
So, in short, I will feel more comfortable about letting my next 2 do it in their own time because once it happened, it was effortless and free of accidents and trauma.<br/>

&gt; Sorry Gigi hijacked and sent my message !<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I was saying that my kids used the potty very early but had many accidents along the way.<br/>
&gt; My sister&#39;s boys  started using when they were 4 and older and  it was a like one day they woke up and decided they were done and never had accidents.<br/>
&gt; So you maybe be done with diapers but running around  with extra clothes and worried about accidents that can happen anywhere!. <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps your perspective!<br/>

&quot;Training&quot; is probably not the word to use for being supportive while  <br/>
children learn naturally.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480851399">Hi Nicole,<br/>
<br/>
Each of my children has a different story, just as Fisher&#39;s story of going to the potty will be his own. <br/>
<br/>
I was divorced from my oldest child father when his father took it upon himself to &quot;teach&quot; him to use the toilet. In one weekend, he was toilet trained, terrified and continued to have issues demonstrated in bedwetting, etc into his teens. <br/>
<br/>
10 years later, I married my husband and dad to my 3 homesechoolers. <br/>
<br/>
The oldest of 3 wasn&#39;t interested until his younger sister went potty. He was 4. Over night he was diaper-free.<br/>
<br/>
Daughter was 2 when she said &quot;this is yucky&quot; and that was it. <br/>
<br/>
My last was 18 months and in love with Winnie-the-Pooh. I off handedly said one time that if he went potty by himself we would take him to meet Pooh-Bear. Before he was about 22 months he was completely diaper-free and reminding me of what I had said daily until I figured out how to get to meet Pooh. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just different from child to child. <br/>
<br/>
Warmly,<br/>
Kate<br/>

I agree with this!  I never had the chance to &quot;train&quot; Chamille when she was little.  I had always assumed that little ones use the toilet around the age of 3, but she was completely without diapers and accidents by the time she reached her 2nd birthday.  It wasn&#39;t coached by me in any way.  <br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t an easy memory for me because it involves me getting very upset, but I&#39;ll tell it anyway.  About a month before she turned 2, Chamille started taking her diapers off and running around with a bare bottom.  One time she kind of disappeared and I finally found her in my closet squatting on my ballet shoes and peeing.  I was very very upset about it.  They were my only ballet shoes and they were VERY expensive and I couldn&#39;t afford to replace them, but there was no way I could clean them either.  She had a look of shock and horror on her face that I would be so mad and so upset, but from that point forward she only used the toilet.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bittersweet memory for me.  Remembering that look on my sweet little girl&#39;s face is yucky for me, but it was really great to not have to change diapers any more.  My best advice is to be sweet and kind and gentle to little kids and their toileting.  Margaux took forever to use the toilet, not too long after she turned 4, but I don&#39;t have any memories of being horrible to her while she was figuring it all out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582989792">My 4-year old still uses diapers to poop. When she was 3 she told me she would start using the potty to poop. Her 4th birthday came and went in October, and she still will poop only in a diaper. Now she tells me she will poop in the potty before she turns 5. Of course, I am hopeful!  I have bit my tongue more times than I care for so that I don&#39;t say all the variety of things I could say to her regarding pooping in the potty. On occasion, I have let her know that I look forward to the day I don&#39;t have to wipe her bum in the way that I must when she poops in a diaper, which requires more effort than pooping in the potty. She tells me she likes to poop in the diaper because she still wants to be a baby.<br/>
<br/>
I cope with this by knowing that she won&#39;t be pooping in a diaper for much longer. As many have told me, she won&#39;t be dating in diapers.<br/>
<br/>
The only advice I can offer is to just know it won&#39;t last forever.  If you work hard at not pushing the issue, he will transition to the potty in his own way and without long-standing issues.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!</div>
