discovered this. Deb went to the bank (Fleet, mind you) to open a new bank <br/>
account. She was asked for her green card or some other form of ID proving <br/>
that she was in the states legally.<br/>
<br/>
Deb moved to Massachusetts from Cleveland, where she had lived her entire <br/>
life. The guy wouldn&#39;t believe her.<br/>
<br/>
Later the Bank Manager worked VERY hard to make Deb feel better, including <br/>
buying her dinner and offering her free banking for the rest of her life.<br/>
