<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425351602">&lt;&lt;Have you guys got the manga comics? There&#39;s a new one about Tigerstar and <br/>
Sasha coming out soon.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorscha is reading over my shoulder and says to type, &quot;Tell Michelle, HI. <br/>
And yes, I have the manga but what is the Tigerstar & Sasha? I know Sasha is <br/>
Hawkfrost and Mothwings Mother and Tigerstar is their Father - it&#39;s kind of <br/>
weird but Tigerstar is also Brambleclaw & Tawnypelts Father too - so their <br/>
kin. But is that the new book that is coming out on September 2nd?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Okay Crystal&#39;s back here, &#39;sidetrack&#39; on that thread but I do have input <br/>
about &#39;no desire&#39;.  Sorscha just finished going through a &#39;no desire&#39; period <br/>
that lasted about a year.  I also just finished a good 7-month period where <br/>
I VANISHED!  Yup, I&#39;m magic like that.  Both Sorscha & I are now, &#39;back in <br/>
the saddle of life&#39; and exploring passion after passion.  I find it is a <br/>
normal rhythm for me and her - on / off, on /off, etc. etc.  Cocooning is a <br/>
time of processing for us.  We need a good long time to detox after periods <br/>
of excitement.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141609715">Crystal, thanks for the blog link too.  I ordered the freekids book <br/>
that you mentioned in the blog about bullying.  Unschooling is such a <br/>
radical thing in the area that I live in.  It helps me to have books <br/>
around that will remind me that we&#39;re not alone.  Caitlin does read the <br/>
mangas.  She usually reads them in the bookstore so we don&#39;t have to <br/>
buy a copy!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270172879">Janene&#39;s jeans all have holes in the knees because she plays Warriors, all the time!  She has read every book out.  <br/>
<br/>
She plays the game on the computer, as well.  <br/>
