<div id="ygrps-yiv-1991054298">I just wanted to throw some info out here. My oldest son is 11 and has been homeschooled until about a year ago and then we started unschooling. I had to let go of a lot of fear surrounding him not reading yet. Well at Christmas time he got a new iPod touch. Now with the new iPod touches you can text message anyone who has another touch, iPhone or iPad. Almost all his friends and most of our family have these devises. For the first time in his 11 years he said &quot;I&#39;m going to learn how to read so I can text&quot; and since Christmas day he is actually typing and reading words! Everyday he texts me the words he knows like &quot;hi, mom, love ect&quot; and just yesterday he put his sentence together. &quot;hi mom, I love you&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Happy new year!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1757188045">I&#39;ve never posted but wanted to reply because your post reminds me<br/>
of my daughter.  I have two girls 9 and 11.  The 11 year old, Brooke,<br/>
has had much difficulty reading in school.  They left in March mostly<br/>
because of Brooke&#39;s stress in an environment that pushed many things<br/>
before she was ready.  The last couple years she kept saying, &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t like to read.&quot;  It wasn&#39;t entirely true as I&#39;d<br/>
seen her enthusiastically read (or attempt to) things that interested<br/>
her.  It was the *required* reading that made her believe she didn&#39;t<br/>
like it.<br/>
<br/>
They discovered an online game Wizard101 and have been playing intensely<br/>
for months.  In it you text other players in a virtual world.  You must<br/>
spell correctly (mostly) or your text won&#39;t go through.  Many of<br/>
their skills have skyrocketed from this game.  Typing, spelling,<br/>
reading, managing virtual money, etc.  They&#39;re learning because they<br/>
want to and are having a blast.<br/>
<br/>
The other night Brooke found a book she&#39;d lost and plopped down next<br/>
to me and started reading it to me.  I was surprised and delighted to<br/>
hear her reading not only fluently, but with wonderful inflection.  She<br/>
missed words here and there but I never said so.  I was engrossed and<br/>
she had me laughing and it was so much fun.<br/>
<br/>
Yet just a month ago she was skimming a game manual and I asked<br/>
something about it and she said, &quot;I don&#39;t know, mom.  You know I<br/>
don&#39;t like to read.&quot;  She doesn&#39;t realize how untrue that<br/>
actually is, and someday I may say so if she doesn&#39;t discover it<br/>
herself.  But right now I&#39;m just thrilled with where she is.<br/>
