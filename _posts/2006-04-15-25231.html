<div id="ygrps-yiv-703702827">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m newish too and my opinions are probably not that relevant. I don&#39;t really know what the differences would be (have been lazy and not looked up relevant things you&#39;ve sited) so my vote probably doesn&#39;t count now anyway but I like it here. I like the group dynamics. I&#39;d like to  stay as we are but if we move then I&#39;m going with you all to google (is that where we&#39;d go???)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I&#39;m abit duh....<br/>

I am fine with moving to Google.  But i am in a group  that moved to google <br/>
and well over half the people have left because of the  move.  Just something <br/>
to think about.  But i am for  whatever.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1109315531">Just curious: has anyone looked at the Topica email list structure? <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lists.topica.com/">http://lists.topica.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t gotten any mail from my topica lists in a while, but I remember them being fairly easy to use... something to look at & think about... (I like yahoogroups best in digest format... I like what y&#39;all have said about the google groups web format, but don&#39;t like their digest format at all: can&#39;t email people from the digests if you want to because there&#39;s no email information, though I kind of like that the topics are bunched together...)<br/>
<br/>
Just my 2 cents! :)<br/>
