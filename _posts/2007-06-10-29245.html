<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590156501">A list-owner moment:<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked earlier about putting up an announcement of get- <br/>
togethers.  Because we have readers in half a dozen countries around  <br/>
the world, it&#39;s not a good place to discuss a picnic in Vancouver or  <br/>
the laws of Mississippi.<br/>
<br/>
If one can write something interesting enough and useful enough to  <br/>
members in France and New Zealand and Ohio, and then also throw in a  <br/>
link to something local, you earned that moment at the microphone, as  <br/>
it were.  But first you need to provide something useful or  <br/>
interesting to people thousands of miles away.<br/>
<br/>
And on a more personal note, I really dislike seeing this list as one  <br/>
of several lists something is sent to.  Please don&#39;t include this  <br/>
list when you&#39;re mailing every list you&#39;re on (or even every  <br/>
homeschooling list you&#39;re on).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Sandra</div>
