<div id="ygrps-yiv-643176090">I am not of a Christian belief system nor do I shun it or any other belief<br/>
system.  However, I am finding myself facing my son (age 13) wanting to go<br/>
to a church service/cook-out with apprehension and worry - okay I will admit<br/>
fear.  I have raised him, since age 3, with a Religious Science philosophy<br/>
(with a smattering of Nature-based beliefs for a while)- one of openness and<br/>
embracing all belief systems.  Though my parenting has not always been<br/>
respectful (was pretty mainstream until he was about 9 or 10 and discovered<br/>
unschooling), I have always been open with him about beliefs and wanting him<br/>
to follow his heart and explore his beliefs, as his own.  I did not want him<br/>
to grow up &#39;believing&#39; what I do just because he grew up with it.  I really<br/>
do want him to explore and find his own way, what his heart tells him is<br/>
true for him.  And it is really not so much that I fear him becoming/being<br/>
Christian or any other faith label, it is the fact that there are some<br/>
churches (at least in Oklahoma) that aren&#39;t fully open about who they are<br/>
and what their true beliefs are until you are really feeling secure and have<br/>
connections/friends within the church.and even then it is questionable of<br/>
whether they are being truthful (this happened to me during my exploring and<br/>
one of my friends just a few years ago).<br/>
 <br/>
Part of me just tells me I need to just let go of the fear and trust that he<br/>
has a good head on his shoulders to make the right decisions for himself yet<br/>
there is the protector part of me that sees him attending this church<br/>
service because of a new girlfriend (showed no interest of exploring until<br/>
yesterday, after they became gf/bf) and not wanting him to get hurt.  He has<br/>
a wealth of information at his fingertips (many of my friends are Christian,<br/>
the ministers at our Spiritual center are well versed in all types of<br/>
beliefs, and of course there are books and internet) so there are other ways<br/>
for him to explore Christianity w/o going to a church.<br/>
 <br/>
I am sure this has been approached before and welcome references of where I<br/>
might find unbiased information to 1)help my son discover and 2) help me get<br/>
through this.<br/>
 <br/>

This is **so cute**!!<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be  more critical because of your beliefs and of having been at  <br/>
home so long, and of all the people who joined churches as adults (or  <br/>
teens), the damage seems much less than those who grew up with it and  <br/>
extricated themselves later.<br/>
<br/>
Of all the worries adults have ever expressed about teens, &quot;a church  <br/>
service/cook-out&quot; is the best I&#39;ve heard.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am sure this has been approached before-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So do you want to just spill it and let us advise you or find links?   <br/>
What church?  If it&#39;s Baptist, don&#39;t worry.  Methodist, ditto.  Is is  <br/>
some independent snake-healing church?  (If you don&#39;t want to tell,  <br/>
that&#39;s fine.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Part of me just tells me I need to just let go of the fear-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not considering an attempt to &quot;forbid it,&quot; I don&#39;t think, so  <br/>
trusting him seems the best-to-only option.  If you try to talk him  <br/>
out of it, you&#39;ll set  yourself up against the allure of the  <br/>
girlfriend.  Try not to do that.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695948411">Every family i have ever known has had some sort of beliefs wether it be athiest, buddism, baptist, catholocism, wiccan , and on and on. Some families put their religion at a higher priority than others. <br/>
   <br/>
  I realize at 13 this may not/ probably wont be the girl he marries/has a life long relationship with. Teen boys and girls have always bought new things, tried new roles , etc mainly to impress the other. A great side effect though is they get to experience more and find out what they really like , want and believe in before making a life long commitment to someone. <br/>

It wasn&#39;t very long after I&#39;d decided I was not a Christian that my<br/>
daughter decided she wanted to go to vacation bible school. Ack.<br/>
I was very nervous about some of the same issues you mentioned. <br/>
<br/>
I basically just prepped her with information about the kind of music<br/>
they would sing, that they might tell her Jesus is her saviour etc...<br/>
She looked at me funny and said &quot;So?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was truly no big deal. She had a ball and all my fears about<br/>
judgmental people and the possibility of evangalizing did not come true.<br/>
<br/>
I would trust him and also arm him with what he MAY encounter. If he<br/>
goes in knowing what it&#39;s about, he&#39;ll learn what he needs and leave<br/>
the rest alone. Whether he&#39;s doing it for a friend or simple<br/>
curiosity, it&#39;s something he needs to explore right now. I&#39;ve found<br/>
children raised to question things to be very good at seeing through<br/>
any falseness in religion.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  This makes me think of something that happened a couple of months ago. My 8 year old dd goes to awanas on Wed nights and has a blast. She has been around friends and family members in the past that said grace at every meal and had picked it up and said it herself for about 6 months . One eve she just started eating her food and I asked no grace tonight? <br/>
  She said nah I figure of god expected everyone to thank him for food every day he would have quit giving us food a long time ago . <br/>

******Hi Ren<br/>
I can identify with the *fear*  thing.<br/>
 <br/>
My kids have expressed  interest in going to a weekly kids club ,which is the <br/>
youth grp religion  class held at the church where our co-op is held.<br/>
 <br/>
Because of fear I haven&#39;t brought  it up again .  But really,  fear of <br/>
what????<br/>
 <br/>
We already talk about different  beliefs alot from all the different people <br/>
in the cop and also us being the  only unschoolers.  They  already realize *so <br/>
and so believes  this*  and not view it as *this is the way it is*.<br/>
 <br/>
So perhaps i don&#39;t need to fear  anything after all. I think the main reason <br/>
they want to go is to connect with  their friends and have fun anyway.  And  <br/>
the  people  involved are kind people.<br/>
 <br/>
You have made me think more on  this issue. Thanks<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

What church?<br/>
 <br/>
It is one of those Mega-Churches ___.tv that don&#39;t openly say they are any<br/>
denomination.  I looked up their site and it is so sunshine and roses with<br/>
no real statement of faith so it is hard for me to be able to tell him what<br/>
he might encounter or not.  Which is another reason I am hesitant.  He *did*<br/>
go last night and it wasn&#39;t a big deal, in the grand scheme of things. I<br/>
know I make it out to be bigger in my mind so reading others replies really<br/>
has helped.  I have enjoyed reading others experiences and it is inspiring<br/>
to hear about successes (in support and in results of strengthening<br/>
relationships)!  Thanks to everyone!<br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
WELL, then.  Mega-Churches tend to believe they need to keep their  <br/>
mega-church open, so they won&#39;t press many views that might run  <br/>
people off.  Tell him they&#39;ll want him to put money in the collection  <br/>
plate (or to give them a pledge of regular direct withdrawals &lt;g&gt;.   <br/>
Non-denominational mega-churches can bend the way the cash-bearing  <br/>
wind blows.  They seem to want to make people feel cheery, supported,  <br/>
self-righteous and eager to return.<br/>
<br/>
Three friends of mine who were from different backgrounds used to go  <br/>
together to the biggest local church here, and they all loved it, and  <br/>
none seemed to feel it went against their beliefs.  Way to be vague  <br/>
and inspiring and make a bunch of money!  (Not my friends, the  <br/>
ministerial staff.)<br/>
