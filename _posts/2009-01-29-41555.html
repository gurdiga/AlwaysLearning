<div id="ygrps-yiv-1176807334">Some unschoolers got together in a place where there was a fridge  <br/>
magnet that said &quot;fat=happy&quot; and the discussion went this way and that  <br/>
and then:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;[S]omeone said they&#39;d talked to a family who &#39;cannot unschool&#39;  <br/>
because of you; well, more specifically because your talk of food  <br/>
freedoms is bullshit because your family is fat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
#1, my family isn&#39;t fat.<br/>
#2, my husband has been fat since infancy, and his mother has limited  <br/>
and measured and shamed since before he understood English.  We did go  <br/>
out to lunch with them so Holly&#39;s boyfriend could meet them, and she  <br/>
asked Keith at the table &quot;How much do you weigh?&quot;  This suprised  <br/>
Holly&#39;s boyfriend.<br/>
#3 I weighed 167 pounds or so before I was pregnant, and I was going  <br/>
to weight watchers and then I broke my leg.  Then I got pregnant.   <br/>
Then over the next five years I had three babies, all (sadly and  <br/>
frustratingly) by cesarean, and a few years later I broke my other leg.<br/>
#4  I weigh as much as Oprah Winfrey.  She&#39;s wildly ashamed and noisy  <br/>
about it.  I&#39;m busy helping people unschool.<br/>
#5  There are current photos of my kids at the bottom of this page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/kids">http://sandradodd.com/kids</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Both Marty and Kirby have at one time or another been pudgier, and  <br/>
then got tall.  So what?<br/>
<br/>
WHAT IF my kids were &quot;fat&quot;?  They aren&#39;t.<br/>
If they were, would that &quot;prove&quot; unschooling didn&#39;t work?<br/>
<br/>
When a kid is thin, is it because parents limit foods or force them to  <br/>
eat certain foods or any other thing like that?<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t want to unschool, it&#39;s easier for them to look  <br/>
around and blame something or someone, than to say &quot;I&#39;ve thought about  <br/>
it but I don&#39;t want to,&quot; or &quot;I tried to understand it, but I can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is Holly:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Holly/2009/kdk_0253.jpg">http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Holly/2009/kdk_0253.jpg</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Holly/2009/martyparty049.jpg">http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/Holly/2009/martyparty049.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
She has larger breasts than I had when I was her age. She&#39;s wearing  <br/>
smaller jeans than I wore at her age. When I was her age I weighed 120  <br/>
lbs. MAYBE that means she&#39;ll gain weight when she&#39;s in her 30&#39;s and  <br/>
older too. Maybe it doesn&#39;t. What I DO know is that she eats better  <br/>
than I ever ate in my life, and she knows what foods do what to her.  <br/>
She never eats just because it&#39;s time. She doesn&#39;t eat things she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t like. She likes things many adults don&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
One of my lunatic stalkers (or my lunatic stalker, if they&#39;re all the  <br/>
same person) once got angry and wrote that Keith was an ogre and Kirby  <br/>
was a blimp. Somehow I guess that made her feel better.   But  <br/>
anyway...  it seemed silly and it seemed very false, seeing as how  <br/>
especially Marty and Holly are pretty lithe.<br/>

<br/>
I think everyone has very different energy levels depending on how their<br/>
bodies function best.  I do well to be thinner than I am right now if I want<br/>
to be little more energetic and actually make it on time to things .... but<br/>
that&#39;s not true of everyone.  Brian works for long long hours, and has for<br/>
over a decade, at the same job.  At my most energetic I might be able to do<br/>
that for a time but nowhere near over a decade... I&#39;m not as hardy as he<br/>
is.  He&#39;s overweight by probably anyone&#39;s standards, but I personally don&#39;t<br/>
think he&#39;d do well if he didn&#39;t have that stored energy to burn, all the<br/>
better to keep that job for years on end.  I believe he needs it to<br/>
survive.  He is rarely ever sick.  Maybe once a year.  I can&#39;t say that<br/>
though I&#39;m not sick very much.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for the links to the fourlittlebirds blog!  Very timely.<br/>

people who unschooled (my dd was 11 months at the time) I went camping<br/>
with some alternative group in France (that&#39;s where I&#39;m from.)  A lady<br/>
who unschools academically told me she limited TV because &quot;one of the<br/>
big unschooling advocates in the US&quot; had unlimited TV and her kid(s?)<br/>
was (were?) fat.  (I guess she associated TV watching with being a<br/>
couch potato.)  I don&#39;t know who she was talking about (she didn&#39;t<br/>
remember their name.) At the time I wasn&#39;t convinced not limiting TV<br/>
was the best thing to do (I am now) but I didn&#39;t buy into her argument<br/>
even then.   <br/>
<br/>
I totally agree with you Sandra: it&#39;s easy to blame others and dismiss<br/>
ideas one is afraid of because of them than it is to look at one&#39;s<br/>
fears and face them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035758709">Hi there -- I saw on my blog stats that someone linked from here so I<br/>
thought I&#39;d check it out. The story you mentioned, Sandra, originated<br/>
with me. The &quot;fat=happy&quot; magnet is actually an insert from a Tasty<br/>
Bite Indian food package, and it&#39;s referring to studies that have<br/>
shown that low-fat diets correlate with depression. Originally it was<br/>
titled &quot;fat=happy?&quot; but my awesome friend whited-out the question<br/>
mark. :p <br/>
<br/>
The story I told was of reading a blog post by an unschooler about her<br/>
skepticism about intuitive eating or &quot;unfooding&quot; as I&#39;ve heard some<br/>
unschoolers call it. I hear this in RU circles occasionally, this idea<br/>
(Alfie Kohn talks about it in his video Unconditional Parenting) that<br/>
people are fat because their food intake was controlled when they were<br/>
kids, ergo if you don&#39;t control kids&#39; food intake, they won&#39;t be fat.<br/>
Well, the reason for this blogger&#39;s skepticism, she wrote, is that<br/>
Sandra Dodd doesn&#39;t control her kids&#39; eating, and look at how fat they<br/>
are!<br/>
<br/>
What I was dismayed by on reading this was the range of unthinking and<br/>
disturbing assumptions implied, that I would expect from a mainstream<br/>
source, but am always disappointed to find among people who seem to be<br/>
able to think critically about other issues. Like: Adipose tissue in<br/>
areas other than women&#39;s breasts is the result of uncontrolled and<br/>
unhealthy and psychologically dysfunctional eating. Thin people do not<br/>
eat unhealthily and do not exhibit psychologically dysfunctional<br/>
eating. &quot;Fat&quot; is defined as anything but stick thin. Children are<br/>
inherently bad and self-destructive and have no self-knowledge. I&#39;m<br/>
sure you could come up with some more. <br/>
<br/>
The ridiculousness of her targeting your family as evidence for her<br/>
theory aside, she&#39;s right that intuitive eating doesn&#39;t guarantee thin<br/>
children, although she&#39;s wrong about why that is, and she&#39;s wrong to<br/>
assume that the opposite -- controlling food -- will necessarily<br/>
result in thin, healthy people. <br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn is wrong too. Yes, there is such a thing as psychologically<br/>
dysfunctional eating behavior that is caused by control and<br/>
expectations and judgment. But even in the absence of those things,<br/>
people will still not all look exactly like the current cultural<br/>
aesthetic ideal. The fact that he&#39;s wrong *doesn&#39;t make food freedom<br/>
and intuitive eating wrong*. <br/>
<br/>
The truth is that controlling someone&#39;s food source doesn&#39;t (except by<br/>
starvation) guarantee thinness -- or any shape or size for that matter<br/>
-- and intuitive eating doesn&#39;t guarantee it either. But control<br/>
*will* guarantee mental and emotional issues with food to some degree,<br/>
and intuitive eating will make a normal relationship with food much<br/>
easier to achieve. <br/>

Wow.  I wonder if &quot;the word&quot; out there is that my kids are fat?  It&#39;s  <br/>
not like I&#39;ve been stingy with photos of them.  It&#39;s not like I  <br/>
haven&#39;t taken them with me to conferences.  And as usual, nobody&#39;s  <br/>
watching TV in my house right now except my husband who&#39;s working a  <br/>
jigsaw puzzle and listening to the news.  Holly watched an hour and a  <br/>
half of sitcoms last night while she worked on shrinky dinks.  But  <br/>
what a deeply lame thing, to say &quot;I will limit my children because I  <br/>
heard someone who doesn&#39;t limit has fat kids.  That&#39;s not even  <br/>
statistics or correlation, that&#39;s just superstition or bullshit.<br/>

post?  This is fun. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
There&#39;s someone who was writing a lot at unschooling.info/forum for a  <br/>
while.  Her name was Danielle and she was in Texas and didn&#39;t have any  <br/>
children, but she wrote with vigor.  Then she had a baby and wrote  <br/>
with crazed vigor.  She&#39;s the one,  I think, who wrote (in a comment  <br/>
on my blog, I think) that Keith was an ogre and Kirby was a blimp.  It  <br/>
was just vitriolic lashing out.  If there&#39;s something else out there  <br/>
about my allegedly fat family, I&#39;d like to see it!<br/>

ridiculous thing is that she wasn&#39;t even eating much but enjoying herself<br/>

incredibly snide and so totally unnecessary.<br/>

I don&#39;t like it when people call themselves fat.  When people have done<br/>

they&#39;d like to be or not, it makes no difference.  What makes a<br/>

are happy in their own skin.<br/>

One could be a very skinny and very miserable person.  I know without a<br/>

exercises regularly who will never in a million years be skinny.  She&#39;s<br/>
beautiful and I&#39;m sure her husband and her kids find her so, as well as<br/>
most people that meet her.  She&#39;s perfectly comfortable with who she is<br/>

I love people who are comfortable with who they are as people, no matter<br/>
what they look like.  I&#39;ve found that the more a like a person, the more<br/>
beautiful they become.  I&#39;ve met people that appear beautiful, and after<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten to know them, they become much less so, simply because they<br/>
aren&#39;t nice.</div>

Which is why this woman (who thought that Sandra&#39;s family was such<br/>
good evidence that food freedom/intuitive eating is not a healthy<br/>
practice) and people who think like her are not going to be swayed by<br/>
photographic evidence or anyone&#39;s opinions. Besides, even if Sandra&#39;s<br/>
kids could be objectively deemed &quot;not fat&quot;, there are still people who<br/>
*are* fat who practice food freedom and intuitive eating. What of<br/>
that? Does that invalidate it? They think so.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t like it either when people disparage themselves or others. But<br/>
something to think about is that not all people who are fat see their<br/>
fatness as a bad thing or see the descriptor &quot;fat&quot; as necessarily a<br/>
bad thing. :) In fact, the size acceptance movement has been more than<br/>
happy to reclaim that word.<br/>

I think many people believe &quot;getting overweight&quot; happens by eating what you<br/>
want and not *controlling* it.  The main terrific selling point for diet<br/>
products/ advice, etc.  What doesn&#39;t seem to make a dent in the argument is<br/>
that people *are* controlling (or trying to) what they eat and still not in<br/>
the &quot;ideal&quot; weight range for their height.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I have stopped cringing at the word fat since I saw a teen<br/>
friend wearing a hoodie that says &quot;Fattie&#39;s Club&quot; on the back alongside a<br/>
playboy bunny ...  so fat is sexy to boot.  ;)  Counterculture sells too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>***************************************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not only did my parents control every bite of food that went into my <br/>
mouth, they constantly made comments about my &quot;huge butt&quot; and called <br/>
me &quot;Baby Huey&quot;.  Even now they say they were just trying to help me!  <br/>
(Yeah, thanks! =oP)<br/>
<br/>
Everytime we&#39;d go out to eat they&#39;s say &quot;God, look at that---Shannon <br/>
always orders the biggest thing on the menu!&quot;<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter how small my meal was, they always said that---they <br/>
still do! <br/>
<br/>
I would never put my son through what I had to put up with.  I have <br/>
food issues---he doesn&#39;t.  We have never limited him in any way.  If he <br/>
wants to try something (including wasabi!) he does.  And we never force <br/>
him to eat something he doesn&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
He makes really great choices.  He likes to eat candy & cookies---but <br/>
his favorite thing is salad.  He&#39;s a pescatarian  (vegetarian who eats <br/>
fish).  He loves yougurt, carrots, shrimp, and Miso soup.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and he&#39;s thin & healthy!  <br/>

know he has genes on both sides of the family to be much heavier than he is<br/>
now, and the last thing anybody needs is the idea that as long as one is<br/>
young and thin, one is healthy by default.  He *is* healthy but he may or<br/>
may not always be thin and definitely won&#39;t always be young.  Dunno.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321733610">food freedom is a no-brainer for me because of my upbringing as well.  my parents would <br/>
leave the room and go watch TV and i wasn&#39;t allowed to leave the table until my plate was <br/>
clean.  they would yell, &quot;eat, dina eat!&quot; from the other room.  i was only allowed 1 glass of <br/>
water/juice with dinner and since i never liked the taste of meat, i would wash it down <br/>
with my drink.  when my drink ran out i would chew on a piece of meat for a REALLY long <br/>
time but i HAD to eat it or i would still be sitting there. i told my mom over and over again <br/>
that i hated ham but it wasn&#39;t until i actually threw up on my plate during easter dinner <br/>
that she didn&#39;t force me to eat it anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
and they were shocked when i left for college and became a vegetarian!  think they would <br/>
be surprised that i grew up and had an eating disorder in my early twenties?  no WAY am i <br/>
doing that to my kid.  no-brainer.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; intuitive eating. What of that? Does that invalidate it? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Or conversely, if food freedom and intuitive eating were the cause of excess <br/>
weight then surely all or almost all unschoolers would then be overweight, <br/>
and that is not the case at all. Any crowd of unschoolers shows the same <br/>
wide variation in physique that any other crowd of the general population. I <br/>
suppose if we were being compared to a crowd of Olympic runners or fashion <br/>
models or Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, then we might be showing more mass <br/>
but so would any crowd of ordinary parents, kids and teenagers.<br/>
<br/>
I think that sometimes people suspect that we ignore or hide problems, that <br/>
the whole unschooling thing is too good to be true. Then when we do report <br/>
how we manage problems, tough moments, the times when our kids baffle or <br/>
distress us, in ways that do not resort to controlling or limiting or <br/>
turning away from unschooling, the reaction can be unnecessarily &quot;just as I <br/>
thought&quot; viscious - as if the absence of perfection equals complete failure.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to be slimmer, but I can tell you it&#39;s not what or how I eat. <br/>
It&#39;s how I don&#39;t exercise enough to overcome my genetics. I have been within <br/>
three pounds of the same weight, other than pregnancy, for around 12 years, <br/>
which I slowly arrived at over three years after I quit going to the gym for <br/>
(at least) 2 hours every single live long day. I think if I were simply <br/>
consuming too many calories, surely my weight would continue to rise. Jayn <br/>
has gotten pretty plump over the last year, and that follows the pattern <br/>
that both my mother and I did at that age - only Jayn is less plump and <br/>
started older than either of us were if photos are any evidence. If she <br/>
continues to follow the pattern she will lose it all over the course of <br/>
puberty, especially if she continues to swim and dance.<br/>

so say the rules of classic logic, yeah?<br/>

I&#39;m sure we could probably pick out other fallacies if we put our<br/>

obtuseness so thick it makes me gasp, I use the tools of logic to pull<br/>
myself back off the edge. Before I learned that trick, I used to be so<br/>

out with the pretty brightly-colored decorated food -- dessert. They<br/>
don&#39;t see this kind of stuff often, so of course they would be<br/>
attracted to that first. Well, they picked at it a bit, and pretty<br/>
soon put those plates aside and ran off to get the more boring-looking<br/>
protein-based foods my husband and I had on our plates. Last of all?<br/>
Salad. They all had to have salad. All this is really unremarkable as<br/>
far as they are concerned, but to me, with my past of food issues and<br/>
being aware of the wider society&#39;s beliefs about why people eat the<br/>
way they do, it&#39;s both hilarious and affirming.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1510820215">i just realized i am something of an adult case study of 1 wrt to uncontrolled food and choices throughout life.<br/>
<br/>
i never had ANY food controls on me at all.  in fact, other than school (lol) my parents&#39; approach was somewhat &quot;unschooly&quot; mixed with &quot;continuum&quot; style.  none of it intentional!<br/>
<br/>
i wonder how much of how kid approach eating throughout their lives has to do with what they *observe* in terms of eating habits and choices and reasons with their parents or caregivers.  although i had no controls or even intentional influences/opinions imposed on me wrt food, my dad, in particular, was an over-eater (he had TONS of icky childhood experiences wrt food) and ate for many other reasons besides how his body felt at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
i have done pretty well in my life wrt food, although certainly went through phases where i was eating for comfort not hunger, eating to the point of being overly full, or, for instance, in 6th grade, gorging on candy after school every single day. <br/>
<br/>
but i have always liked and chosen a variety of foods, and been healthy both mentally and physically wrt food, and fairly contented with my own relationship with food.<br/>
<br/>
i wonder if those phases i went through would be gone through by unschooled kids whose parents *don&#39;t* have a negative or unhealthy relationship *themselves* with food....impossible to know for sure, but otherwise it&#39;s hard for  me to understand why i&#39;d have had any issues at all.  and worth it i think to inspect our own issues with food (as with anything) even if we think we are not burdening our children with our &quot;stuff.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-525179029">I saw a TV show, here in the UK, a week or two back that seemed to think<br/>
that there is something in the brain that says when to stop eating and it&#39;s<br/>
different for people where that point is - determining our point of<br/>
satisfied hunger and how much we weigh.   They started out with only 20?<br/>
thinnish looking 20 something&#39;s and gave all them equal numbers of calories<br/>
that would cause them to gain weight.  3 of those people couldn&#39;t eat past<br/>
that full feeling and therefore did not gain weight.  All the rest did.<br/>
They showed us side profiles of the little bit of extra they&#39;d gain.  After<br/>
that trial, they let them get back to their lives and normal eating habits<br/>
to see what would happen.  All of them went back to their weights of before,<br/>
over different amounts of time.  Everyone they interviewed said they did not<br/>
do any dieting.  <br/>
 <br/>
My own experience agrees with this idea but it also tells me that maybe if<br/>
weight gain goes on for a certain amount of time (longer than this trial)<br/>
then the brain &#39;thinks&#39; that is what the body then needs.  And maybe that<br/>
amount of time is different for some, like women who bounce back to their<br/>
old weight before childbirth while others carry more and more weight after<br/>
each birth.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have a very, very similar story to Dina though and noticed just recently<br/>
in a photo from around the &#39;actually getting sick because I had to eat Fish&#39;<br/>
time that I wasn&#39;t my usual thin self.  It was right about then, if I<br/>
remember correctly my parents stopped making me eat certain things on a<br/>
daily basis, that rule continued on the holidays though.  I had to have a<br/>
tablespoon size of everything.  My mother has told me she wanted me to try<br/>
things that she didn&#39;t make at home - thinking I then wouldn&#39;t be a picky<br/>
eater.  All my growing up years there was still the &#39;have to finish what you<br/>
took to eat&#39; rule.  I still slimmed down back down though.  From photos I<br/>
have I&#39;d say I was at my thinnest at around 16.  I don&#39;t know my fathers<br/>
side of the family but my mothers side are all obviously on the thin side<br/>
and still are.    <br/>
 <br/>
I have not been what one would call thin since my first child was born when<br/>
I was 28 (almost 14 yrs ago now).  I&#39;ve not worried over much about my<br/>
weight gain but it still doesn&#39;t feel right to me and every once in awhile<br/>
I&#39;ve exercised more to try to shift the weight which has never worked for<br/>
very long.  Around 10 years ago I started joining homeschool lists and the<br/>
subject of weight and health came up.  I realized then that this, what I<br/>
felt, extra weight I had was most probably a psychological issue from my<br/>
childhood and not because I wasn&#39;t eating right or getting enough exercise.<br/>
All my life before children my weight had been able to self regulate.  So<br/>
for me that show made a lot of sense too.  <br/>

It&#39;s been known for some time that there are hormones that regulate<br/>

I really got the idea that this show was trying very hard to say that we are<br/>
not all made to be thin or skinny.   It was a good show imo because that<br/>
