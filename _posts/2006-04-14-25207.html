<br/>
&gt; Sometimes I&#39;ve been guilty of doing this exact<br/>
&gt; mental checking of the <br/>
&gt; chore list when spending special romantic time with<br/>
&gt; my husband.  Really <br/>
&gt; not a good habit, as it certainly erodes the quality<br/>
&gt; of attention he is <br/>
&gt; getting from me.  Ahem. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ROFLOL! :D and I thought I was the only one!!<br/>
HAhahahahahahahaha!<br/>
