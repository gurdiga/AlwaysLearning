<br/>
That&#39;s a strong word, &quot;saturated.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I also realize that even &quot;touched&quot; is a problem, but overstatement isn&#39;t good <br/>
for the argument.<br/>
<br/>
People say stuff about apple spraying, but if they said an apple was <br/>
saturated with pesticide, it would be goofy, as it&#39;s the blossoms people <br/>
spray, not the apples.  Those worms came from eggs which were laid before <br/>
there was an apple.  A hole means a worm is gone, not a worm got in.<br/>
<br/>
Grapes are different, I&#39;m sure, but still... their skins might be sprayed but <br/>
their insides?  Saturated?<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong.  (About the pesticides, not about the reminder about not <br/>
exaggerating. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
