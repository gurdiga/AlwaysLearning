<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425024226">From the time my daughters were born, I&#39;ve tried to keep two thoughts in my<br/>
mind: treat them with kindness, and treat them with respect.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it will come as a shock to most people on this list that the<br/>
result of keeping those two prime directives in my head is: my daughters<br/>
treat me with kindness and respect.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about being on the street myself in my old age. Not that<br/>
financial planning is a bad idea, but I have no fears I won&#39;t have two<br/>
daughters, treating me with kindness and respect, until I die.<br/>

&gt; - you betcha&#39;!  I hope I get to that point.  But they  understand now that<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m trying to establish a life where I won&#39;t be on the  street myself in<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &quot;old&quot; age.<br/>
