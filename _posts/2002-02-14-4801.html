&lt;&lt; What is a sopapilla?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
It&#39;s spelled variably with or without an &quot;i&quot; and I&#39;m looking for a photo, but <br/>
here&#39;s for starters:<br/>
<br/>
        Encyclopedia<br/>
sopaipilla   <br/>
 <br/>
soh-pi-PEE-yuh This crisp, puffy, deep-fried pastry resembles an air-filled <br/>
pillow. The sopaipilla is thought to have originated in Albuquerque, New <br/>
Mexico, more than 200 years ago. It&#39;s a favorite Southwestern U.S. dessert, <br/>
usually served with honey or syrup flavored with anise or cinnamon. <br/>
Sopaipillas are also sometimes filled with savory ingredients like REFRIED <br/>
BEANS.  <br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I need to say a couple of things about that definition I found online &lt;g&gt;:  <br/>
They are NOT &quot;usually served with...&quot; anything except honey except outside <br/>
New Mexico.  There are Mexican restaurants in other parts of the country  <br/>
(California, I know) that use them as dessert, with powdered sugar on the <br/>
outside.  And &quot;crisp&quot; is not good. Crisp is overcooked.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re New Mexican, not &quot;Mexican,&quot; and while it&#39;s true that leftovers (when <br/>
they&#39;re cold) can be filled with beans for kids to eat, and there&#39;s a dish <br/>
called &quot;stuffed sopaipilla&quot; but that&#39;s covered with sauce and eaten with a <br/>
fork, the proper use in a New Mexican restaurant is this:<br/>
<br/>
Tear off a corner, and pour just a little honey inside--about a teaspoon or <br/>
two, depending on the size of the bread.  Tilt it so the honey&#39;s distributed <br/>
around inside.  Eat the bread with the meal (biting off, not tearing off) to <br/>
keep the chile-heat from burning your mouth too much.  The bread and honey <br/>
will cut the burn.<br/>
<br/>
I had two last  night. &lt;g&gt;  Elissa and Joe are great people and talkative, <br/>
and we had a good time, but they were exhausted from being awake so long, and <br/>
they missed the tour from car rental taking a long time.  That was pretty <br/>
good, because the tour was terrible.  We&#39;d hoped they could meet Dave and <br/>
Nancy Martinez (who are quietly on this list, and not so quietly active at <br/>
unschooling.com, but there were two near-meetings and none successful.  The <br/>
homeschoolers were swimming on the West Mesa last night, at a pool with <br/>
slides and kid-stuff, and Holly was with them, and Dave and Nancy stayed <br/>
until the little kids were through having fun. And Joe and Elissa stayed here <br/>
(WAY across the valley, by the mountains) until they were too sleepy.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; What is a sopapilla?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a good description from someone&#39;s travel diary online, someone biking <br/>
in southern Utah/Colorado (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mikebentley.com/bike/harry/19-21.htm)">http://www.mikebentley.com/bike/harry/19-21.htm)</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
     A sopapilla (so-pah-PEE-yah) is a type of bread served in most <br/>
Mexican restaurants in the New Mexico area. The dough is rolled thin, <br/>
and pieces (usually rectangular or triangular, perhaps three inches across) <br/>
are placed in hot deep fat. After a few minutes they are removed, with the <br/>
cooking having puffed them up like a small pillow, ideally with a golden <br/>
brown crust. They are served with a squeeze-bottle of honey. You bite <br/>
off a corner, pour honey into the cavity, swirl it around to spread the <br/>
sweetness, and consume. The best Mexican restaurants keep the <br/>
basket of sopapillas filled as they would your water glass. The stingier <br/>
places make it very clear that you will get one and only one sopapilla <br/>
with your order. Extras might cost as much as a dollar apiece.<br/>
 <br/>
     Well, this place had an enchilada plate that came with a choice of a <br/>
tortilla or a sopapilla, which is about like giving you a choice between water<br/>
 <br/>
and wine. I ordered the enchiladas, and specified the sopapilla. My <br/>
enchiladas arrived, but I had to repeat my request for my sopapilla well <br/>
into my meal. They had been hoping I&#39;d forgotten, for evidently I was the <br/>
only customer that had ordered one, and heating up the fat was a bother. <br/>
But by the time I finished my meal, along came a generous-sized sopapilla <br/>
and I had it for desert.<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes restaurants here will do a sopaipilla-and-ice-cream dessert, but <br/>
it&#39;s always a restaurant that used them during the meal too.  Those desserts <br/>
just started being made within the last 20 years.  It&#39;s no traditional thing, <br/>
but restaurant art.  It&#39;s usually got a drizzle of maple or chocolate, and <br/>
pinones (pine nuts).  I never see locals eat that much--maybe buying one for <br/>
kids to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1296187326">Oh my goodness.  I love sopapillas.  Never had the New Mexican authentic<br/>
version, but have had the midwest interpretation (i.e. - poor excuse for<br/>
what a true sopapilla sounds like).  There is a family owned mexican<br/>
restaurant near us that serves the best midwest sopapillas.  They deep<br/>
fry(not to crispy) a large flour tortilla, sprinkle on sugar and cinnamon,<br/>
slather it with honey and will put Redi Whip on top if desired.  Some of the<br/>
other mexican joints serve the little triangle ones, but they are so crispy<br/>
you could crack a tooth.  Sopapillas are always desserts here.<br/>
<br/>
I need to make a food road trip.  The food here in michigan is, well -<br/>
stinky.  I find it hard to find really good food in affordable restaurants.<br/>
Everything is meat and potatoes - crappy gravy(not the real stuff, just the<br/>
beef or chicken base blech).  I love really good food, but usually that is<br/>
something homemade or super expensive at a fancy chic chic pooh pooh place<br/>
that I can only afford once a year(at the most).  Sometimes the real<br/>
expensive stuff tastes like crap too.  The family restaurant I work at now<br/>
serves mostly swill(canned, fake or just crappy), except for a couple of<br/>
items.  When I worked at the country club, I became a food snob, because our<br/>
chef took such pride in his work( and made the most fantastic food, soups,<br/>
real gravies, sauces, etc).  Now, if I want something good, I search the web<br/>
for recipes, watch PBS or FoodTV shows or ask my sister to cook.<br/>

Probably the same dough,  just prepared differently.<br/>
<br/>
Sopapillas are smaller, and cooked in hotter, deeper grease.  You slip the <br/>
thin, flat raw thing sideways into the grease so it sinks.  It puffs up and <br/>
rises.  You turn it over when one side&#39;s cooked, and drain it on a towel.<br/>
<br/>
Cooking more than one at a time is a problem, at home.  In restaurants with <br/>
wide, dangerous deep fryers and a person JUST making sopaipillas, they can <br/>
operate more than one.  But it they&#39;re close enough to bump each other it&#39;s <br/>
not as good.<br/>

aren&#39;t as puffy but taste pretty close....<br/>
<br/>
Maybe fried bread-like stuff is one of those universal foods. Cacie loves<br/>
pooris at Indian restaurants, they&#39;re not sweet but otherwie similar.<br/>

surface area to cook a few, but you don&#39;t need huge amounts of oil.  And<br/>
slipping them in is also important because if you just drop them in the<br/>
hot grease splashes up on you... this we learned the hard way.<br/>

I was driving through Long Beach recently and noticed a New Mexican<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; What is a sopapilla?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s spelled variably with or without an &quot;i&quot; and I&#39;m looking for a<br/>
&gt; photo, but<br/>
&gt; here&#39;s for starters:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;         Encyclopedia<br/>
&gt; sopaipilla<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; soh-pi-PEE-yuh This crisp, puffy, deep-fried pastry resembles an<br/>
&gt; air-filled<br/>
&gt; pillow. The sopaipilla is thought to have originated in Albuquerque,<br/>
&gt; New<br/>
&gt; Mexico, more than 200 years ago. It&#39;s a favorite Southwestern U.S.<br/>
&gt; dessert,<br/>
&gt; usually served with honey or syrup flavored with anise or cinnamon.<br/>
&gt; Sopaipillas are also sometimes filled with savory ingredients like<br/>
&gt; REFRIED<br/>
&gt; BEANS.<br/>
&gt; ------------------------<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I need to say a couple of things about that definition I found online<br/>
&gt; &lt;g&gt;:<br/>
&gt; They are NOT &quot;usually served with...&quot; anything except honey except<br/>
&gt; outside<br/>
&gt; New Mexico.  There are Mexican restaurants in other parts of the<br/>
&gt; country<br/>
&gt; (California, I know) that use them as dessert, with powdered sugar on<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; outside.  And &quot;crisp&quot; is not good. Crisp is overcooked.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They&#39;re New Mexican, not &quot;Mexican,&quot; and while it&#39;s true that leftovers<br/>
&gt; (when<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re cold) can be filled with beans for kids to eat, and there&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; dish<br/>
&gt; called &quot;stuffed sopaipilla&quot; but that&#39;s covered with sauce and eaten<br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt; fork, the proper use in a New Mexican restaurant is this:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tear off a corner, and pour just a little honey inside--about a<br/>
&gt; teaspoon or<br/>
&gt; two, depending on the size of the bread.  Tilt it so the honey&#39;s<br/>
&gt; distributed<br/>
&gt; around inside.  Eat the bread with the meal (biting off, not tearing<br/>
&gt; off) to<br/>
&gt; keep the chile-heat from burning your mouth too much.  The bread and<br/>
&gt; honey<br/>
&gt; will cut the burn.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I had two last  night. &lt;g&gt;  Elissa and Joe are great people and<br/>
&gt; talkative,<br/>
&gt; and we had a good time, but they were exhausted from being awake so<br/>
&gt; long, and<br/>
&gt; they missed the tour from car rental taking a long time.  That was<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; good, because the tour was terrible.  We&#39;d hoped they could meet Dave<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; Nancy Martinez (who are quietly on this list, and not so quietly<br/>
&gt; active at<br/>
&gt; unschooling.com, but there were two near-meetings and none<br/>
&gt; successful.  The<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers were swimming on the West Mesa last night, at a pool<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; slides and kid-stuff, and Holly was with them, and Dave and Nancy<br/>
&gt; stayed<br/>
&gt; until the little kids were through having fun. And Joe and Elissa<br/>
&gt; stayed here<br/>
&gt; (WAY across the valley, by the mountains) until they were too sleepy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-551777676">fry bread and sopapillas are two different things.  Fry bread is larger,<br/>
flatter, but it is also served with honey.  I love fry bread and when we go<br/>
up past red rock mall in the Jemez I alway stop and get some.  I&#39;ll evne have<br/>
an Indian Taco (Meat, beans, cheese, etc. on fry bread) but sopapillas are a<br/>
side dish, the bread of the meal, not a desert (oh yuck ;-) ).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1768818708">Yes, I saw that a few weeks ago.  We need to go try it.  Also, Little<br/>
Anitas has a restaurant in Fullerton.  LIttle Anitas is a chain in New<br/>
Mexico, started by a family with a daughter by the name of Anita.  I<br/>
actually taught Anita for a few years.  Anyway, we&#39;ve been to this<br/>
Anitas a few times, and confirmed it is owned by the same family but the<br/>
food is not quite the same. The chili is much more bland, and it just<br/>
isn&#39;t the same, I don&#39;t know why.  The sopapillas taste really good<br/>
though.  I will have to try the one up in long beach though.  Mark and I<br/>
have been meaning to do that.<br/>
