I think it would be easier to lighten up if children weren&#39;t already the brunt of so much disrespect. I&#39;m a bit full up on jokes that involve children...even analogies that are basically harmless. My hackles raise when I hear &quot;training&quot; in relationship to raising children.

I guess the analogy wouldn&#39;t bug me so much if the author wasn&#39;t so obviously playing into the biases that society holds against children. yuck.<br/>
I&#39;m not some humorless blob. I get Blonde jokes sent to me occasionally, yeah, their funny (if untrue). I tend to like analogies that are goofy....but I didn&#39;t like this one. I don&#39;t like my children being compared to some loyal, slobbering dog I suppose.:)<br/>
They&#39;re intelligent, capable human beings that like me because I like them.<br/>

When Lars seemed to start pushing me away, I thought I should just go with <br/>
it, since he &quot;needed to separate&quot;. I suspect it surprised and bothered him <br/>
that I let him go so easily, so to speak. I almost completely stopped <br/>
touching him, because he seemed to want me to. If I had it to do again, I <br/>
would have pulled him back a bit, gently, to let him know it wasn&#39;t me who <br/>
wanted the closeness to stop. I&#39;m not sure I&#39;m wording this right.<br/>

My reaction is still &quot;lighten up, y&#39;all.&quot;  :)  <br/>
<br/>
We already know most of society is this way towards children.  Take it for <br/>
what&#39;s worth and don&#39;t get so &quot;rabid&quot; over it.  ;)<br/>

If nobody ever objectedto humor they deemed offensive, though, we&#39;d still be <br/>
awash in Rastus and Liza jokes, and the kinds of nasty sexist stuff that <br/>
hasn&#39;t been around in polite company since the 1970&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not worth having a heart attack about, but it might be worth seeing it <br/>
as something to avoid.  I&#39;ve had a link set up but haven&#39;t filled it in yet for <br/>
just such things (linked from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/life,">http://sandradodd.com/life,</a> something about <br/>
humor that demeans children.<br/>
<br/>
I have one MUCH worse example (I&#39;ll put it up there at some point) which was <br/>
sent to me by a teacher in Salt Lake City.  She never had children of her own, <br/>
never married (bad by Mormon standards) and adopted a set of three sisters <br/>
from Russia, proceeding to &quot;raise&quot; them (they were already 11-15) extremely <br/>
traditionally and strictly.   The others on that list I knew were childless public <br/>
school teachers.    I wrote an objected to the tone  of the jokes, and a <br/>
couple of people on the list complained that I should lighten up or leave them <br/>
alone.  They didn&#39;t want e-mail from me.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.  I didn&#39;t order child-insulting e-mail. They didn&#39;t see it as insulting <br/>
children, it seems; they saw it as sympathy for poor adults who have to DEAL <br/>
with children (that mysterious unreasonable other species).<br/>
<br/>
The dog and cat thing was QUITE mild compared to other things I&#39;ve seen.<br/>

<br/>
One of the many things that pushed me out of teaching were the <br/>
tasteless jokes about children, men, women, ethnicities, animals, you <br/>
name it, heard in the teacher&#39;s lounge.  And then there were the non-<br/>
jokes, the comments teachers made about students.  Some were really <br/>
shocking to me.  Since I was not known for keeping my mouth shut I <br/>
often did not make it past the first year of teaching.  I remember <br/>
like it was yesterday the superintendent who informed me that he was <br/>
not renewing my contract because I &quot;rocked the boat,&quot; and, he <br/>
said, &quot;in our town we just don&#39;t need that!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
What had I done?  When I discovered that the social studies and <br/>
history teachers were telling kids that the display they had just <br/>
seen, sent out by the state in a tractor-trailer rig displaying <br/>
blacks who were important to history and their accomplishments, was <br/>
just a pack of lies put out to appease the blacks, I decided to pull <br/>
the blue-eyed/brown-eyed thing in my classes.  If you are not <br/>
familiar with this you can read about it at the PBS site on <br/>
Frontline:  A Class Divided, about Jane Elliot&#39;s 1968 experiment:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/divided/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/divided/</a><br/>
It was very effective, created quite a ruckus among students, then <br/>
among teachers and parents.  So effective that word got back to the <br/>
super that &quot;that&quot; English teacher, yes, the same one who was having <br/>
their sons write poetry, was &quot;rocking the boat.&quot;  In that little <br/>
haven of lily-whitedom the boat definitely needed rocking!    <br/>
<br/>
Of course that was 1969, the year after Jane Elliot first conducted <br/>
her experiement in Iowa.  But I can&#39;t say that things look very <br/>
different now in the classrooms where I currently live.  Racial <br/>
prejudice does seem to thrive heartily in the midwest.  As do bigoted <br/>
jokes.  I sub now and then, to keep my credentials active, but have <br/>
never regreted stepping away from teaching as a &quot;profession.&quot; <br/>

yikes!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I taught where I had gone to school, and I really liked most of my teachers, <br/>
so maybe my experience isn&#39;t typical.   <br/>
<br/>
The ethnicity stuff wasn&#39;t a problem at our school.  I heard the most <br/>
offensive jokes from relatives in Texas when I would go home for reunions.  Horrible <br/>
people.  Casually bigotted and SO unlike the people in Northern New Mexico I <br/>
was used to.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes kids were badmouthed in the teacher&#39;s lounge, but some of the <br/>
cuttingest comments were about parents and other teachers.  We had a couple of <br/>
looney teachers.  Kids knew it, and other teachers knew it.  Loons.  Esther <br/>
Pfiester.  Probably if her parents had named her better she&#39;d&#39;ve done better.   Poor <br/>
thing.   She hated pubescent boys.  Maybe one had attacked her one time.  <br/>
That&#39;s my best guess, but she would never in a million years have discussed it <br/>
with me.    I would trade her a smaller pre-pubescent boy for one of her <br/>
&quot;trouble makers&quot; (meaning gotten-tall, voice-changed, hairy boys).   <br/>
<br/>
She should have been teaching 7th grade instead of 9th, but there it was.<br/>
<br/>
One kid was a bully and a liar.  When he set fire to a poster in the gym <br/>
right in front of me, his dad came to school to discuss it.  The dad was JUST LIKE <br/>
HIM.  He lied too.  He weasled and wiggled &quot;Did you SEE him light the <br/>
lighter?&quot;  &quot;No, I saw him look around too see whether anyone was watching, stand <br/>
facing the door a bit, and walk away from a flaming poster, and he had the lighter <br/>
in his pocket.&quot;    &quot;But you didn&#39;t see him set it on fire?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dumbass.<br/>
<br/>
So we laughed later, and said &quot;Well, that&#39;s where he gets it,&quot; and decided it <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to be worth appealing to the dad to help us out if there were <br/>
problems.<br/>
<br/>
But another thing I remember happening LOTS and lots of times was one of us <br/>
telling the other teachers about something we knew about a kid that the others <br/>
didn&#39;t know.  That his mom was in the hospital for a mental breakdown, or that <br/>
a girl had broken up with her boyfriend so we should give her a break for <br/>
another week or so, or that one kid who seemed mousy had done something <br/>
brilliant.  We shared hopeful stories and compassionate stuff.<br/>

<br/>
Nancy:<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for this site. This is exactly what I was talking <br/>
about.  The children were marked, they were marked by one teacher and <br/>
their marking was passed along to the other teachers.  So the child <br/>
could not be who he or she was, but in the eyes of the teachers the <br/>
child was marked.  <br/>
<br/>
Today in the district where I sub they do it differently.  In one <br/>
school where I subbed they hand you a clipboard first thing.  On the <br/>
clipboard are the names of all the elementary children in your <br/>
class.  Next to their names are columns for each day of the week, <br/>
each week of the marking period.  At the bottom of the sheet are 10 <br/>
numbered items, demerits, 10 things for which the teacher must write <br/>
a number if the child is caught doing these things.  If any child <br/>
gets 4 or more demerits in a day he or she must go to &quot;detention&quot; <br/>
after school.  And if he or she gets 5 or more &quot;detentions&quot; in one <br/>
marking period then they are labeled as chronic problems and further <br/>
steps are taken to reprimand and punish them.  So now they are <br/>
labeled on little clipboards as &quot;bad&quot; kids for doing &quot;bad&quot; things.  <br/>
Over 50% of the students in some classes go to &quot;detention.&quot;  Shows <br/>
you how well that system works!  <br/>
<br/>
And just what are these terrible offenses that these elementary <br/>
students are committing?  Talking.  Getting out of his or her seat.  <br/>
Going to the pencil sharpener.  Disobeying the teacher.  Leaving the <br/>
room without permission.  Not sitting quietly in his or her seat, <br/>
doing what they were told.  And so on.  Terrible offenses!!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
My husband, a ten year veteran corrections officer in a state pen, <br/>
said that the language was exactly that used in prison systems.  So <br/>
these children, from age 3 on (Head Start), are being labeled <br/>
as &quot;bad,&quot; as offenders, as needing &quot;detention.&quot;  To me this makes the <br/>
schools and the teachers recruiters and trainers for the FFA, the <br/>
Future Felons of America.  For if you tell children repeatedly how <br/>
bad they are, they will surely someday prove you right.  By the way, <br/>
did I say that this particular school was 99% black?  I guess I <br/>
forgot to mention that.  And then we wonder why so many end up in <br/>
jail or prison later?  I wonder how so many escape and manage to stay <br/>
out of jail or prison.  I think it&#39;s amazing that only about 25% are <br/>
incarcerated when far more have been programmed from a very early age <br/>
for that fate.<br/>
<br/>
Surely all schools are not like this, but even if only one is like <br/>
this, it is one too many.  And, sadly, I am sure that this is not the <br/>
only one.  <br/>

It&#39;s okay not to discuss school-related sites. here.<br/>
It&#39;s really best to just read or not read them on the side, process within <br/>
yourself how that will help you unschool, and then tell us your final thoughts.<br/>
