*************************************************<br/>
          The &quot;OCTA-TETRA Construction Set&quot; is a hands-on, low-tech, <br/>
geometric construction set teaching 3-D geometry, design principles, <br/>
the discovery process, manual dexterity, and more and more.  It is <br/>
designed for kids of about 10-11 years old and on upwards.<br/>
       First visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyclassroom.net/hsboys/articles/octa-">http://familyclassroom.net/hsboys/articles/octa-</a><br/>
tetra.html for an introduction to &quot;The OCTA-TETRA Club&quot;.  This page <br/>
was made over two years ago; the project has progressed by light-<br/>
years since then.<br/>

 The OCTA-TETRA Club  Update - June 2004<br/>
       I have made major breakthroughs with the OCTA-TETRA <br/>
Construction Set.  The &quot;bugs&quot; are now taken out of it, and I have <br/>
built some amazing and beautiful structures.  After years <br/>
of &quot;Research and Development&quot;, I&#39;m finally ready to &quot;go public&quot;.<br/>
      OCTA-TETRA recently made its official debut at the &quot;Rethinking <br/>
Education Conference&quot; in Dallas on May 28-31 where I had been invited <br/>
to exhibit both my &quot;Uncle Dan&#39;s Algebra Videos&quot; and the &quot;OCTA-TETRA <br/>
Construction Set&quot;.  Hundreds saw the spectacular OCTA-TETRA <br/>
demonstration model as it developed there in the lobby of the Harvey <br/>
Hotel in Irving, Texas.  One after another, first they said, &quot;Wow!&quot;, <br/>
and then after a closer look they said, &quot;Cool!&quot;<br/>
     The &quot;Instruction Booklet&quot; is now finished through Section 19.  I <br/>
am happy to send it out to anyone for free by e-mail attachment a <br/>
section at a time.  It&#39;s so much more than just an instruction <br/>
booklet.  You get to come along with me as I proceed by trial and <br/>
error, finding out what will work or not work, making the impossible <br/>
to be possible.  Who would think one could make cutting-edge <br/>
discoveries in today&#39;s hi-tech world using only paper and paper <br/>
clips?  <br/>
      If you would like to receive for Free the &quot;Instruction <br/>
Booklet&quot;, just e-mail me at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:uncledan@...">uncledan@...</a> and <br/>
request that I begin to send you the &quot;OCTA-TETRA Instruction Booklet&quot; <br/>
files.  If you would like to see pictures of the &quot;demonstration <br/>
model&quot;, ask for that too.  Of course, if you just see the demo pics, <br/>
and don&#39;t read the &quot;Instruction Booklet&quot;, you&#39;ll be putting the &quot;cart <br/>
before the horse&quot; and missing out on the journey of discovery.  <br/>
      I am buying the &quot;Accu-cut&quot; die-cutting machine to make pre-cut <br/>
and pre-scored pieces available soon, hopefully in early July.  <br/>
Please let me know if you think you might be interested in eventually <br/>
ordering pieces.  Sections 17 and 18 of the &quot;Instruction Booklet&quot; are <br/>
the &quot;Catalog and Price List&quot; and explain exactly how much the pieces <br/>
will cost, and make recommendations about how many are needed to <br/>
build particular projects, and what would be needed for a &quot;starter <br/>
set&quot; on up to a &quot;super-duper builder set&quot;.<br/>
             Hope to hear back from you soon,<br/>
             Dan<br/>

UPDATE - July 15, 2004:  &quot;Grand Opening&quot;  pieces NOW available for <br/>
ordering, but you need &quot;Instruction Booklet&quot; first, at least through <br/>
Section 21.</div>
