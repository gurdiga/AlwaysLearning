I&#39;m assuming the teacher is white, but what<br/>
is the race of the child?  Is it OK for the<br/>
child to have contact with a racist person if<br/>
the child is of the same race, but it would<br/>
be wrong if the child was black or another<br/>
race? Isn&#39;t that idea racist? &gt;&gt;<br/>

We are friends with an African American family.  The dad is pretty <br/>
prejudiced.  The mom and dad met at a meeting of the Afro-American Student <br/>
Union in the early 1970&#39;s, in college.  The dad can thereby assume the mother <br/>
will not be too stunned by a fairly separatist attitude.  <br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for him, they moved to Albuquerque, and the kids have all white <br/>
friends so far.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be okay for another Black family to hang around with them?  (I think <br/>
it&#39;s okay for us to, but I know it&#39;s not as pleasant for the dad as we&#39;d all <br/>
like for it to be, that his kids like me and mine so much.)  Should only <br/>
other prejudiced people hang around with him?<br/>
<br/>
I think we&#39;re softening him up.  (Not just our family, but Albuquerque in <br/>
general--before they had lived in NYC, Detroit and Houston, that I can <br/>
remember.)<br/>

Your story reminded me of a guy I dated seriously shortly before I met<br/>
my husband.  He was black, but had no dialect whatsoever, and<br/>
continually experienced surprise from people he&#39;d spoken to on the phone<br/>
when he showed up in person and was black.  The reason for he and his<br/>
brother&#39;s nonexistent dialect was that his mother had told both boys<br/>
when they were children that they must work on speaking with a more<br/>
&quot;white&quot; dialect so they would be discriminated against less as adults by<br/>
white people.  Funny thing about this was that both boys grew up to<br/>
marry white women, and then their mom was furious that they married<br/>
outside their race!  I always thought that was pretty funny.  Be careful<br/>
what you wish for!  G<br/>
