<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145419626">This kind of goes along with the discussion of some of our kids <br/>
&#39;wanting&#39; to try out school.  <br/>
<br/>
I had lunch with two of my best friends today, each of which have 2 kids <br/>
in the local ps.  One of my friends just got a job there working as an <br/>
aid to the Heads-Start pre-k program.  She was telling us about some of <br/>
their rules.  I&#39;ll share two:  NEVER any coloring pages or books to be <br/>
used under any circumstances and there should be no recognition or <br/>
celebration of any holiday be it religious or historical (Thanksgiving).  <br/>
<br/>
Most of my strong memories of elementary school are the holiday crafts. <br/>
 I think those are the only ones my mom ever held onto, so she could <br/>
haul them out every holiday to decorate the house.<br/>
<br/>
I really had to bite my tongue because both of my friends are pretty <br/>
much pro-school education and I don&#39;t want to lose them as friends <br/>
becuase of my growing passion about unschooling, but good grief.  How <br/>
can they just accept all this ridiculous crap being forced (or in this <br/>
case, withheld) from their kids everyday? It&#39;s just like the parents who <br/>
got upset when their kids were pretending to be pregnant by putting <br/>
pillows up their shirts.  Is it that impossible to teach/share <br/>
information objectively just for the joy of watching our children learn <br/>
about the real world we live in so they can decide for themselves where <br/>
they fit into it?  Honestly, if you can&#39;t bring up religion, then forget <br/>
talking about world history.  And if you can&#39;t color in a <br/>
picture...well, hell, that&#39;s just plain fun to do AND really does help <br/>
one become a better artist.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just rambling...avoiding things I really should be working on. So <br/>
anyway...<br/>
Night, all.<br/>
