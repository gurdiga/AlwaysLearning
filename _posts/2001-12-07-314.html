Why were they supposed to take Micro. Flight Sim off the shelfs? Because of the WTT visuals? I think I might have heard something about that, too. I know that there is a new version out (2002) and the WTT are not in that version. <br/>

  The other day the kids and I were in KMart and they had this software title <br/>
  (98) for sale. The reason I remember is that my daughter pointed it out <br/>
  saying, I thought they were suppose to take these off the shelf. Is KMart in <br/>
  your area?<br/>

into the towers.  There was a news report showing how you could crash your<br/>
&quot;plane&quot; into them, and I assume into other landmarks as well.<br/>
<br/>
Woo hoo, what fun.<br/>
