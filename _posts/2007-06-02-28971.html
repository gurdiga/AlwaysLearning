<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I also work. I write for a variety of clients, edit a magazine for a<br/>
nonprofit and do rather time-consuming volunteer work for that same<br/>
nonprofit.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just what I do. I also talk to the kids *a lot,* take them all sorts of<br/>
places, read them all kinds of things, help them find things they&#39;d like to<br/>
read, help them find movies they&#39;d like to watch, supervise them while<br/>
they&#39;re swimming (or swim with them). I don&#39;t feel guilty for the time I<br/>
spend on my business or my volunteer work because their needs are met.<br/>
<br/>
Also, frequently, my for-pay and volunteer work has advantages for them.<br/>
They have friends they&#39;ve met through my volunteer work, and some of my work<br/>
pays rather well. So, when I have a lucrative assignment, the older ones<br/>
know it means good things for them. The younger ones don&#39;t understand -- but<br/>
as a business owner, I have a lot of flexibility. My older children are<br/>
interested in my work (both for-pay and volunteer), and they hear about what<br/>
I&#39;m doing and ask questions about it.<br/>
<br/>
I also do a lot of my work before they wake up or once they&#39;re asleep (right<br/>
now, it&#39;s mostly before they wake up, since they&#39;re on a late-to-bed,<br/>
late-to-rise schedule right now. I do work while they&#39;re awake, but in my<br/>
family it&#39;s just like housework -- I can stop and start as needed.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t do a lot of things that some people consider mandatory. I don&#39;t do<br/>
full makeup every morning or blow-dry or straighten or curl my hair. My<br/>
house isn&#39;t immaculate. I don&#39;t cook fancy meals.<br/>
<br/>
I also am pretty passionate about being with my kids, and that&#39;s more<br/>
important to me than my work -- even though I&#39;m passionate about that, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-826236486">I&#39;ve been thinking some about the threads this week regarding <br/>
housekeeping and meal provision and unschooling. I understand the <br/>
sentiment: lower  the &quot;standard&quot; a bit, be flexible on what is truly <br/>
&quot;need&quot; and whose it is, give moms a break, etc. I guess it&#39;s meant to <br/>
make us all feel better when we can&#39;t give the supposed unschooling <br/>
lifestyle our full attention, keep the house clean, the laundry done, <br/>
and nutritious meals on the table 3x a day all at once.<br/>
<br/>
I think why it nags me is because this idea, while maybe meaning more <br/>
grace and relaxation for some, also promotes an idea that a natural, <br/>
&quot;unschooled&quot; approach to education has to mean a dishelved home and <br/>
convenience foods served on paper plates. This scenario is EXACTLY why <br/>
my husband was at first resistant to unschooling and also many critics <br/>
in our friend/family circle hesitate. It&#39;s taken living it out to show <br/>
dh first, and then the ripples widened to others, that an unschooled <br/>
environment is possible AND my home can be clean/declutttered AND we can <br/>
eat healthy, scratch meals 3x a day, 7 days a week.<br/>
<br/>
The reason for that is that eating and cleaning are a part of our life <br/>
and natural rhythm every bit as much as learning is.  We live clean. We <br/>
live healthy. We learn. One reason we gave up teacher&#39;s manuals and <br/>
canned curriculum is because I was pressured to do what it said rather <br/>
than get dinner on the table or wash a load of clothes. Unschooling <br/>
/hel/ps/ /us be cleaner and eat better because it&#39;s freedom...not the <br/>
other way around.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, these were my thoughts today and I wondered if anyone else <br/>
shares them. We are more physically fit, more active, more healthy, <br/>
better read, more creative, cleaner... (see a pattern here) because of <br/>
the unschooling emphasis in our lives. And I wish I saw more of this in <br/>
others, rather than a pervasive imagery that implies unschoolers are <br/>
messy, tv-watchin&#39;, gaming, chubbies (what I&#39;ve heard about it irl and <br/>
the image I most come into contact with in conversations with others).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299610516">More power to you, Tia!<br/>
<br/>
But, my reality was that the time I spent in the kitchen or cleaning  <br/>
house was time away from my kids unless it just happened to be a time  <br/>
when they felt like joining me in the kitchen. And, when I had three  <br/>
kids under 6 years old, I was tired a lot. When the kids didn&#39;t need  <br/>
me, I needed to sit and rest.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it was also that our kitchen was isolated and tiny - no table,  <br/>
not a comfortable place to hang out.<br/>
<br/>
I do think, looking back, that I could have done a lot better with  <br/>
housework - I just didn&#39;t realize how it works. Now I know - it is  <br/>
really composed of a lot of little habits - picking up things as you  <br/>
move around the house, rinsing dishes, throwing out trash, rummaging  <br/>
through the refrigerator and tossing old stuff as you do, moving a  <br/>
load of laundry in the 2 minutes the microwave is going, and so on.  <br/>
If someone can develop a lot of little habits like that, they don&#39;t  <br/>
so often end up with huge overwhelming messes and a house that is  <br/>
terribly dirty.<br/>
<br/>
Still, I think a happy unschooling home is more likely than not to be  <br/>
a messy one. And I think anybody with a bunch of little children  <br/>
should give themselves permission to use disposable dishes,  <br/>
convenience foods, and household help. And they should not feel  <br/>
guilty about needing these things.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Supposed unschooling lifestyle? Make us feel better?<br/>
<br/>
Sounds a little sarcastic. But...<br/>
<br/>
For me, it was impossible to have a very tidy space AND give my kids the<br/>
attention (4 of them ages 5 and under) they needed. I&#39;m not trying to make<br/>
people feel better, but if that is a side effect, then great.<br/>
<br/>
It was my choice to have the number of children I had at the times I did. A<br/>
messy house came with this choice and I wouldn&#39;t have had it any other way.<br/>
Not because I support messiness or dirtiness. But because it was just a<br/>
process...we eventually got to the clean house part. But the kids needs, and<br/>
my health, came first every time. Maybe it is easier with less children, but<br/>
I do hear people with fewer children saying similar things.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My house now with all teenagers is clean whenever we want it to be (still<br/>
not on the top of the list of important things in life for us, but we&#39;re<br/>
each pretty clean...except one, and that&#39;s just him), and we have a<br/>
generally neat house. It was a process over a few years to move past paper<br/>
ware and real messiness. But everyone came out happy, feeling respected,<br/>
healthier (I definitely got more essential rest than I would have if I added<br/>
a very clean house to the list).<br/>
<br/>
I think the important piece is to step back and look at the essentials. If a<br/>
clean home and 3 meals from scratch is one of those essentials, then that<br/>
will take the attention.<br/>
<br/>
I thanked God for paper plates back in the day, even though I considered<br/>
myself environmentally thoughtful. But now, meals are cooked by any one of<br/>
us, when it works, and two of my kids are much better cooks than I am. We<br/>
now use glassware, ceramic dishes and metal utensils. For the most part, our<br/>
ingredients are whole grain and often organic. Two of us are vegetarians,<br/>
four are omnivores. I think each member of my family individually knows what<br/>
they like and believe based on having freedom with just about everything,<br/>
including housecleaning and cooking.<br/>

our passions often took us in many places away from cleaning...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Us too. Are you associating messy house when kids are very young with<br/>
dirtiness in general? You say &quot;see a pattern here&quot; as if these are the<br/>
&quot;shoulds&quot; of life. Are you unschooling, or do you have an &quot;unschooling<br/>
emphasis&quot;? I think there is probably a difference.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not that size is important, but your mention of &quot;chubby&quot; along with<br/>
tv-watchin&#39; and gaming doesn&#39;t fit us. I go to a gym everyday. Every member<br/>
of my family is thin. Three of my kids are active in a different physical<br/>
activity regularly. The other is still thin. I don&#39;t think these images you<br/>
have created in your thinking are very helpful for unschooling. If &quot;clean&quot;<br/>
living is important to you, and you have made that a priority, and it is<br/>
working for you. But it certainly isn&#39;t an end-all, in my opinion.<br/>

I guess we do some of each.  Sometimes we&#39;ll use use paper plates, sometimes we&#39;ll get fast food.  We&#39;ll make homemade from scratch meals and we&#39;ll do convenience things too. <br/>
<br/>
We watch TV, play games and video games, read, bike ride, walk--do all sorts of things. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s how our unschooling life works,  we do it all.   And we sometimes choose to have a tidy house and sometimes there are more important things to do.<br/>

And that&#39;s cool if that&#39;s what&#39;s important to the kids too. :)  I guess for me its hard/sad to see some families where the cleanliness,  more reading and being more active/healthy outweighs the kid&#39;s happiness. (I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s what the poster was saying, just talking about other people I know, usually not unschoolers)<br/>

<br/>
I know in my case, having a large kitchen-room that includes our table <br/>

really ARE all together most of the time! :-)<br/>

<br/>
I agree. I have my days/times when we use paper stuff. I try to keep it <br/>
to a minimum out of expense and environmental concerns. My real intent <br/>
though was not to compare or start any kind of defensiveness, nor to <br/>
diminish anyone&#39;s real need for a break like that, now and then or <br/>
always if they need it. It was to represent my own reality which often <br/>
seems to stand in the face of a trend; a perception I regularly fight <br/>
against. Our home is creative and often &quot;messy&quot; but we stay on top of <br/>
clutter and I (not so much my children) keep the house pretty clean as <br/>
my husband and I prefer it that way. I don&#39;t think unschooling has to <br/>
mean a chaotic environment, though I&#39;ve had more than one person tell me <br/>
it would, and felt that even in last week&#39;s threads.<br/>

<br/>
Sounds a little sarcastic. But...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, no. Wasn&#39;t meant to be sarcastic at all. Is that not the intent of <br/>
telling someone to go ahead and let the house get messy? Switch to all <br/>
paper products? Eat frozen food rather than cook, as a habit, not an <br/>
occassion? It was to relieve any guilty feelings if I understood <br/>
correctly. I already tried to clarify what I meant by the words <br/>
&quot;supposed  unschooling lifestyle&quot; in another post.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think the important piece is to step back and look at the essentials. <br/>
If a<br/>
clean home and 3 meals from scratch is one of those essentials, then that<br/>
will take the attention.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In our home, it&#39;s important to myself and dh, and we both think our <br/>
children thrive and can concentrate better in an organized (not <br/>
immaculate) environment. I know I can&#39;t possibly be unique in that <br/>
feeling! My point was that I often feel like a weirdo for being neat and <br/>
organized AND an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How many children do you have? Do you all think the same way? I ask because<br/>
you have strong ideas and say &quot;we&quot; for them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have 5, 4 surviving. They are 11-2. I had the first 3 in 3 years and <br/>
our 4th also had critical medical issues. I say that to say I know what <br/>
&quot;busy&quot; is. Even now, we suburban homestead, I run a business, and am <br/>
writing a book. I could never, ever do all this if I had to do a canned <br/>
curriculum. I do indeed have strong ideas and one of them is to hike my <br/>
own hike. I want a clean house so I clean the house. Our kids don&#39;t have <br/>
assigned chores but I do ask them to help with stuff through the day. I <br/>
should qualify that because at our house, a question is a question if <br/>
one can answer &quot;no&quot; and it be okay. If I ask, they can say no and often <br/>
do! We talk a lot about being a team (everyone makes the mess, everyone <br/>
cleans the mess) and are admittedly raising them with the idea of being <br/>
responsible for their own mess. But that also looks different for <br/>
everyone. The little one, for instance, isn&#39;t responsible a bit ;-). And <br/>
my oldest two are very different: one is a neatnic and the other is a <br/>
free spirit. She helps with communal spaces but her own space is her own <br/>
space.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Us too. Are you associating messy house when kids are very young with<br/>
dirtiness in general?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh gee...if I am, then I&#39;m in trouble! :-) No. There is a difference <br/>
between what I call &quot;the signs of life&quot; and filth.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; You say &quot;see a pattern here&quot; as if these are the<br/>
&quot;shoulds&quot; of life. Are you unschooling, or do you have an &quot;unschooling<br/>
emphasis&quot;? I think there is probably a difference.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Not that size is important, but your mention of &quot;chubby&quot; along with<br/>
tv-watchin&#39; and gaming doesn&#39;t fit us. I go to a gym everyday. Every member<br/>
of my family is thin. Three of my kids are active in a different physical<br/>
activity regularly. The other is still thin. I don&#39;t think these images you<br/>
have created in your thinking are very helpful for unschooling. If &quot;clean&quot;<br/>
living is important to you, and you have made that a priority, and it is<br/>
working for you. But it certainly isn&#39;t an end-all, in my opinion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No, it&#39;s not an end-all. Just a part of my life. I sometimes wonder if <br/>
it&#39;s as valid as the mom who desperately needs take-out and paper <br/>
plates. Are we both unschoolers or not?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The point was practical advice on how we were able to really devote  <br/>
ourselves to meeting our kids&#39; needs and supporting their interests  <br/>
and being fully available to them, even when we had a number of young  <br/>
ones and we were stretched thin, tired and, sometimes, overwhelmed.<br/>
<br/>
Conscious living is what it is all about. There is a big difference  <br/>
in attitude between slothfulness versus choosing to lower the  <br/>
priorities of housecleaning, cooking from scratch, eating off nice  <br/>
dishes, and so on, in order to spend your time and energy in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
People have different kinds of intelligences, ala Howard Gardner. I  <br/>
think some kind of space and time &quot;orderliness&quot; might be one of the  <br/>
so-far undefined ones. I don&#39;t have much natural &quot;orderliness&quot;  <br/>
intelligence and had to learn and practice it over years. By the time  <br/>
I figured out how to do some of what relatively neat people seem to  <br/>
do naturally, my kids were in their teens and my house was way  <br/>
overloaded and disorganized.  In place of &quot;orderliness,&quot; I have  <br/>
tremendous energy, enthusiasm, and multi-tasking abilities, plus  <br/>
flexibility and tolerance and appreciation of a lot of swirling chaos  <br/>
around me.<br/>
<br/>
In my family, the very same way of &quot;being&quot; that left my house  <br/>
overloaded and disorganized was what made our unschooling lives  <br/>
endlessly exciting and rich with much variety of experience. I was  <br/>
the epitome of the &quot;side-tracked home executive,&quot; but another way to  <br/>
see it would be that I was the person who was always following some  <br/>
side track to make new discoveries and connections and it was all  <br/>
those side tracks that created the rich texture of our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Another point of view: I am an economist and our mantra is, of  <br/>
course, &quot;There is no such thing as a free lunch.&quot; This means that  <br/>
every time you make a choice, you give up something else - the next- <br/>
best alternative is the cost of what you do choose. If you choose to  <br/>
spend time cooking dinner, from scratch, that is time you are not  <br/>
spending playing Monopoly with a child or holding the hose while the  <br/>
children run through the water or snuggling up on the couch to watch  <br/>
yet another episode of Sponge Bob. This is a fact of life - when you  <br/>
choose vacuuming, you&#39;re &quot;not choosing&quot; something else and that  <br/>
&quot;something else&quot; could have been time connecting with a child. There  <br/>
is always a cost. Always something else you could have done, instead,  <br/>
always a next-best alternative. What we were suggesting was to take a  <br/>
realistic look at the cost of trying to keep the house very clean,  <br/>
eat off real dishes, cook from scratch - what is being given up? Make  <br/>
a choice based on what has the most value to you.<br/>
<br/>
The point isn&#39;t so much to relieve guilt as to relieve exhaustion and  <br/>
support unschooling, which requires that parents mostly put  <br/>
children&#39;s needs and interests at the top of their priorities.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the people who ask questions aren&#39;t the ones who have it all  <br/>
together. ;-) The first most helpful step for people who can&#39;t figure  <br/>
out how to do it all is being aware of what&#39;s important: the kids and  <br/>
family. Focus there first. Everything else is a choice.<br/>
<br/>
After that I think the most helpful thing we can do about the extras  <br/>
is help people find ways to make them 1) less time consuming and 2)  <br/>
choices rather than necessities, to help them again focus on what&#39;s  <br/>
important. 3 meals from scratch a day isn&#39;t important. It *is*  <br/>
helpful to see 3 meals from scratch as a gift someone wants -- freely  <br/>
*chooses* -- to give their family rather than something the family  <br/>
needs. It&#39;s a present, not a necessity. If someone is taking from the  <br/>
family (time, sending negativity into the environment) to give the  <br/>
family a gift that the family doesn&#39;t necessarily want, then it&#39;s  <br/>
helpful to see it clearly in that light that it isn&#39;t a gift. It&#39;s a  <br/>
vision of perfect homelife mom&#39;s trying to impose on the family.<br/>
<br/>
I think tips on how people do family maintenance is great. (There&#39;s a  <br/>
useful thread at UnschoolingDiscussion on storage.) I think too much  <br/>
moves the focus away from the kids onto the extras. The extras are  <br/>
advanced unschooling ;-) They&#39;re only for after people have fully  <br/>
embraced putting kids and family first.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; rather than a pervasive imagery that implies unschoolers are<br/>
&gt; messy, tv-watchin&#39;, gaming, chubbies (what I&#39;ve heard about it irl and<br/>
&gt; the image I most come into contact with in conversations with others).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>People whose kids choose not to watch TV, don&#39;t like video games, who  <br/>
are active, only eat organic food by choice don&#39;t write in to ask for  <br/>
helpful suggestions!<br/>
<br/>
The advice obviously does skew towards helping people be comfortable  <br/>
with what they perceive as problems. The picture we paint on lists  <br/>
and boards tends to be skewed because we&#39;re dealing with problems.  <br/>
Just as a dermatologist&#39;s office tends to be skewed towards people  <br/>
with skin problems, totally ignoring the majority of the population  <br/>
who doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
There are Days In the Life collections. Sandra has one. There&#39;s one  <br/>
at the Unschooling.info boards. But they&#39;re fairly skewed too ;-)  <br/>
People tend to write about extraordinary days because those fill them  <br/>
with a passion to write. People don&#39;t write about the days their kids  <br/>
spent playing video games for 8 hours (if they&#39;re comfortable with  <br/>
that); they don&#39;t write about the days they spent shopping, coloring,  <br/>
managing disagrements; because the thought of taking the time to  <br/>
write about them is more likely to fill them with an urge to clean a  <br/>

see it would be that I was the person who was always following some<br/>
side track to make new discoveries and connections and it was all<br/>
those side tracks that created the rich texture of our lives.-=-<br/>
<br/>
All three of my kids (15, 18, 20) hang out with a social group, and  <br/>
most of the people in that group are equally friendly with all three  <br/>
of them.<br/>
Last night that group had &quot;a prom.&quot;  There were mostly-randomly  <br/>
assigned couples (eleven couples).  The girls got fancy dresses from  <br/>
thrift stores and the boys wore suits.  The couples were drawn with  <br/>
rejections on sibling draws or already-couples.  Some of the girls  <br/>
got together Thursday night and made corsages and boutonneires from  <br/>
roses and greens they&#39;d bought at a flower shop.   They were going to  <br/>
one of the boys&#39; parents&#39; house for photos, then to an Italian  <br/>
restaurant, then back to the house to dance and swim.   They&#39;re all  <br/>
still asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Of that group, five were unschoolers, and the rest &quot;school kids,&quot; but  <br/>
theatre and gaming and fantasy kids mostly.  Holly says lots of them  <br/>
are easily discouraged about their creative bursts by other kids  <br/>
saying &quot;dumb,&quot; but not as bad as most groups she&#39;s been around.<br/>
<br/>
The point of this story was going to be this:  Beth, the organizer,  <br/>
who is a regular in local theatre stuff, came into my den when she  <br/>
came to pick Holly up for flower arranging.  She said &quot;I LOVE this  <br/>
room!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My den is not my best room.  I had been making costumes for weeks,  <br/>
and never cleaned up after it.  There was laundry all over the couch,  <br/>
and baskets of sorted laundry various places on the floor.  There&#39;s a  <br/>
shelf of DVD&#39;s and tapes nearly as big as a wall, and books about  <br/>
movies and TV shows there.  There&#39;s another shelf of games, with  <br/>
stuffed monkeys (dusty stuffed monkeys) on the top.  The ironing  <br/>
board was up with piles of ironed napkins and sewing supplies on it.<br/>
<br/>
But she loves that room.   And here&#39;s one reason why:  I asked what  <br/>
supplies they had, and she said she got florists&#39; tape and roses and  <br/>
greens.  I said &quot;Are you using wires?&quot;  She looked blank, so I opened  <br/>
a drawer, in that room, and pulled out a pack of florists&#39; wire and  <br/>
handed it to her.  I said maybe they&#39;re using something else more  <br/>
high-tech these days; if so, bring these back and let me know what  <br/>
the deal is (because one of the girls had worked for a florist).<br/>
<br/>
Holly said the next day that the florist girl was embarrassed and  <br/>
worried because she hadn&#39;t said &quot;and buy wire,&quot; and Beth was happy to  <br/>
be able to hand the wires over, and say to Holly several times that  <br/>
night &quot;I&#39;m so glad your mom gave us wire!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My house is cluttered, but I had florist&#39;s wire in the room where  <br/>
someone mentioned flower arranging.<br/>
<br/>
The other extreme of that is a house so sterile that there is nothing  <br/>
with which to create or from which to learn.  Holly had a best  <br/>
friend, when she was four and five and six.  The girl LOVED to come  <br/>
across the street to our house, and she loved to paint.  We had all  <br/>
kinds of paints and paper, and she did different kinds of painting  <br/>
different days, and sometimes would come in the door saying &quot;Can I  <br/>
paint?&quot;   For her birthday we gave her a how-to-paint book with the  <br/>
water colors built into it, and pages right there to paint on, all  <br/>
self-contained, with a storage space for the brush.  Her mother was  <br/>
NOT happy at all.  She said she didn&#39;t want her painting in the  <br/>
house, that she could paint at school.<br/>
<br/>
Paint at school!?  Not for many years, and even then, once a week  <br/>
*maybe* unless one was in an art class in high school, and even then,  <br/>
painting would only be one small part of the years&#39; media experiences.<br/>
<br/>
If my house is going to be a school too, I want it to be a GREAT  <br/>
school where kids can paint every day if they want to.  I want it to  <br/>
be the best school, where there are things to discover and use  <br/>
independently or share or take outside into the sunlight and rain  <br/>
(not musical instruments, but most other things), and I want a  <br/>
microscope, but they take room.  And I want adult-reading-level pop- <br/>
up books about physics and Egypt, but they take room.  And I want  <br/>
LOTS of recorded music and movies and books, but they do certainly  <br/>
and absolutely take a lot of room.<br/>

<br/>
Some people will write about ANYthing, I guess. &lt;g&gt;  That would be me.<br/>
In a published collection called &quot;Patchwork of Days,&quot; I wrote about  <br/>
going shopping because the kids were coloring and ran out of pink  <br/>
crayons.  We went to an educational supply shop that used to be used  <br/>
by all the teachers in the state, but has long ago closed.  They sold  <br/>
individual crayons.  Of course, we couldn&#39;t just go in and get  <br/>
crayons. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My urge to write is MUCH more present than my urge to clean closets,  <br/>
which is good for people who come here to read, but not as good for  <br/>
finding things in my closets.  On the other hand, I have years of  <br/>
experience with packrattery and clutter, and am really very good at  <br/>
finding something I know I have within half an hour or so of being  <br/>
asked for it.  More often I know right where it is,  in a box under  <br/>
other boxes, in the back of a closet.   (I did fail to find one dress  <br/>
pattern from the 70&#39;s last month, and so I think I must have given it  <br/>
away or loaned it out.)<br/>
<br/>
My priorities are to collect and provide and facilitate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very grateful to others who write, too, even when they&#39;re not  <br/>
having a remarkable day, and for letting me collect and provide and  <br/>
facilitate getting that writing out in public where others can find it.<br/>

wasn&#39;t your experience, or that of some others, it must not be possible <br/>
or valid.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny to me, because in the classical/traditional realm, I&#39;m not <br/>
valid either. Too much mess, creativity, disorder, flexibilty, children <br/>
who speak for themselves... in short, child neglect. And in the <br/>
unschooling realm...too much order, strong ideas, selfish choices...in <br/>

put my children in the kinds of boxes adults try to put one another in.<br/>

family (time, sending negativity into the environment) to give the<br/>

helpful to see it clearly in that light that it isn&#39;t a gift. It&#39;s a<br/>
vision of perfect homelife mom&#39;s trying to impose on the family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh? I can promise you that my family needs to eat at least 3x a day. I <br/>
can promise that they need that food to be free from allergens, <br/>
preservatives, additives, and chemicals. It&#39;s a gift that I provide I <br/>
suppose...of course, it would be cruel deprivation not to give/provide <br/>
it. It would also be an abdication of my role as their mother/provider. <br/>
They do trust I will feed them and that the food I serve will do no harm.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;They&#39;re only for after people have fully<br/>
embraced putting kids and family first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not new to the unschooling life. Not even new to the list. I can say <br/>
in our household, we have fully embraced putting kids and family first. <br/>
But organization and useful storage was not something I did only after <br/>
this...it&#39;s quite necessary when living in small living spaces, which we <br/>
always have done, and surely, surely I can not be only unschooler out <br/>
there that likes to maintain, for the good of the entire family, a neat <br/>
environment that promotes creativity.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;they don&#39;t write about the days they spent shopping, coloring,<br/>
managing disagrements; because the thought of taking the time to<br/>
write about them is more likely to fill them with an urge to clean a<br/>
closet or something ;-)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I both write about this kind of day and clean my closets :-). I must be <br/>
a freak. :-)<br/>

&gt; Well, the people who ask questions aren&#39;t the ones who have it all<br/>
&gt; together. ;-) The first most helpful step for people who can&#39;t figure<br/>

&gt; family. Focus there first. Everything else is a choice.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think tips on how people do family maintenance is great. (There&#39;s a<br/>
&gt; useful thread at UnschoolingDiscussion on storage.) I think too much<br/>
&gt; moves the focus away from the kids onto the extras. The extras are<br/>
&gt; advanced unschooling ;-) They&#39;re only for after people have fully<br/>
&gt; embraced putting kids and family first.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; rather than a pervasive imagery that implies unschoolers are<br/>
&gt; &gt; messy, tv-watchin&#39;, gaming, chubbies (what I&#39;ve heard about it irl and<br/>
&gt; &gt; the image I most come into contact with in conversations with others).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People whose kids choose not to watch TV, don&#39;t like video games, who<br/>
&gt; are active, only eat organic food by choice don&#39;t write in to ask for<br/>
&gt; helpful suggestions!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The advice obviously does skew towards helping people be comfortable<br/>
&gt; with what they perceive as problems. The picture we paint on lists<br/>
&gt; and boards tends to be skewed because we&#39;re dealing with problems.<br/>
&gt; Just as a dermatologist&#39;s office tends to be skewed towards people<br/>
&gt; with skin problems, totally ignoring the majority of the population<br/>
&gt; who doesn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are Days In the Life collections. Sandra has one. There&#39;s one<br/>
&gt; at the Unschooling.info boards. But they&#39;re fairly skewed too ;-)<br/>
&gt; People tend to write about extraordinary days because those fill them<br/>
&gt; with a passion to write. People don&#39;t write about the days their kids<br/>
&gt; spent playing video games for 8 hours (if they&#39;re comfortable with<br/>
&gt; that); they don&#39;t write about the days they spent shopping, coloring,<br/>
&gt; managing disagrements; because the thought of taking the time to<br/>
&gt; write about them is more likely to fill them with an urge to clean a<br/>
&gt; closet or something ;-)<br/>

If you&#39;re getting a hostile message, and you were unaware of having  <br/>
sent one in the first place,  maybe you should get a friend to read  <br/>
your e-mails with you for a while, and read yours before you send  <br/>
them to make sure you haven&#39;t written something to trigger  <br/>
defensiveness like &quot;supposed unschooling lifestyle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the medium, it&#39;s your word choices.<br/>
<br/>
Please just state your own beliefs (without insulting others, if  <br/>
possible) and then let the rebuttal go without taking it personally.<br/>

I&#39;m writing this now as listowner.  Let&#39;s keep the tone friendlier  <br/>

If you&#39;re seeing others accusing you of child neglect, that&#39;s your  <br/>

The purpose of the list is to give people a chance to see what will  <br/>

time when all three of my little ones were choosing to go off and do  <br/>
something on their own. And if I did have such a moment, it was short- <br/>
lived and I needed the sit-down rest. I almost always had to be  <br/>
present - I remember once I was on the phone with my mom (those days  <br/>
the phone was attached by a wire to the wall, remember that? &lt;G&gt;). I  <br/>
said, &quot;Mom, I really need to go, Roya has been out in the back yard  <br/>
on her own for five minutes.&quot; She said, &quot;She ought to be able to play  <br/>
in the back yard without you for longer than that.&quot; &quot;Maybe she  <br/>
should,&quot; I said, &quot;But I&#39;m not comfortable with it.&quot; For good reason -  <br/>
she was beyond high energy - there was no down time with her, ever.  <br/>
There was always something, some big plan she was engaged in, and she  <br/>
really needed my help to be able to safely do whatever she wanted to do.<br/>

but I don&#39;t think it is reasonable to expect that to be the  <br/>
experience of others. If it is, they know it, they aren&#39;t asking for  <br/>
help, they&#39;re fine, right? When someone writes to the list about  <br/>
being completely overwhelmed with several young children and feeling  <br/>
like they can&#39;t do everything, what good does it do to tell them, &quot;It  <br/>
IS possible to do it all - you ought to be keeping your house clean  <br/>
and cooking three meals a day from scratch and, in fact, doing it  <br/>
happily and easily while the kids go off and take some pleasant alone- <br/>
time of their own just when you happen to need them to do that so  <br/>
that you can do housework or cook.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The message from your post was that the advice on alternative ways to  <br/>
deal with and avoid housework and cooking was just to let people feel  <br/>
less guilty about their failures as cooks and housekeepers. You  <br/>
implied that the rest of us give unschooling a bad name because of  <br/>
our slothfulness. I&#39;m not insulted or anything (I&#39;m way past that  <br/>
stage of needy little ones and my house is nice and neat and clean  <br/>
and I cook when and what I want), I&#39;m saying that it doesn&#39;t help  <br/>
those who are asking for help to tell them that settling for less  <br/>
that a clean house and 3 times a day cooking is what gives  <br/>
unschooling a negative image.<br/>

It is difficult sometimes to separate ourselves from the responses that are<br/>

<br/>
Well that explains part of it I guess. I don&#39;t think everyone should <br/>
live like I do. I don&#39;t think most people should live like I do! I have <br/>
a hyper energy and get stuff done that others are often tired just <br/>
thinking about. My reality though, is that unschooling fasciliates this <br/>
in my life. I am proof-positive that one can unschool and keep clutter <br/>
down and cook healthy meals. My life often goes against a percieved idea <br/>
of unschoolers; it&#39;s an idea I hear propogated even by other unschoolers <br/>
as /necessity for all/. It is that contrast that triggered my initial <br/>
thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; what good does it do to tell them, &quot;It<br/>
IS possible to do it all - you ought to be keeping your house clean<br/>
and cooking three meals a day from scratch and, in fact, doing it<br/>
happily and easily while the kids go off and take some pleasant alone-<br/>
time of their own just when you happen to need them to do that so<br/>
that you can do housework or cook.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These aren&#39;t my words. It would have to be qualilfied with, &quot;it is <br/>
possible for /some/ because it is indeed possible for me, at least right <br/>
now.&quot; I&quot;m not super woman. I wasn&#39;t trying to discourage anyone. I want <br/>
to know if I&#39;m alone in the unschooling world or if anyone shares a <br/>
similar experience.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m saying that it doesn&#39;t help<br/>
those who are asking for help to tell them that settling for less<br/>
that a clean house and 3 times a day cooking is what gives<br/>
unschooling a negative image.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sigh. This is why I started a new thread. I wasn&#39;t wanting to &quot;tell them <br/>
that settling for less...etc&quot;.  I was wanting to discuss a contrasting <br/>
thought triggered by the first thread. For example: there was a need and <br/>
discussion expressed in one thread. I even contributed some helpful <br/>
hints to that thread, knowing all too well the need for a break or a <br/>
&quot;down&quot; kind of time to recharge. I know in my life though, that a <br/>
converse truth also exists. I wanted to discuss that. I didn&#39;t do so in <br/>
reply to the tired moms needing helpful suggestions; I started a new <br/>
thread.<br/>
<br/>
If any tired mom from last week&#39;s thread has felt offended by my desire <br/>
to talk about this contrasting idea, I sincerely apologize and ask your <br/>
forgiveness.<br/>

&gt; lived and I needed the sit-down rest. I almost always had to be<br/>
&gt; present - I remember once I was on the phone with my mom (those days<br/>
&gt; the phone was attached by a wire to the wall, remember that? &lt;G&gt;). I<br/>
&gt; said, &quot;Mom, I really need to go, Roya has been out in the back yard<br/>
&gt; on her own for five minutes.&quot; She said, &quot;She ought to be able to play<br/>
&gt; in the back yard without you for longer than that.&quot; &quot;Maybe she<br/>
&gt; should,&quot; I said, &quot;But I&#39;m not comfortable with it.&quot; For good reason -<br/>
&gt; she was beyond high energy - there was no down time with her, ever.<br/>
&gt; There was always something, some big plan she was engaged in, and she<br/>
&gt; really needed my help to be able to safely do whatever she wanted to do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &quot;I&#39;m not saying you are neglecting your kids to do it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you may be far more efficient and skilled at this kind of thing that<br/>
&gt; &gt; I ever was or am, and maybe your kids keep themselves busier on their<br/>
&gt; &gt; own than mine did, but if I&#39;d spent my time preparing three meals per<br/>
&gt; &gt; day, from scratch, that would have taken considerable time away from<br/>
&gt; &gt; what I spent with my little children, for sure.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But you are, aren&#39;t you? The message I&#39;m getting is that &quot;mess is<br/>
&gt; &gt; evidence of unschooling and order is the evidence of child neglect<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a<br/>
&gt; &gt; mom who consistently chooses other things over her children&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Because it<br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn&#39;t your experience, or that of some others, it must not be<br/>
&gt; &gt; possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; or valid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You might want to reread what I really wrote. &quot;You may be far more<br/>
&gt; efficient and skilled at this kind of thing than I ever was or am,<br/>
&gt; and maybe your kids have always kept themselves busier on their own<br/>
&gt; than mine did.....&quot; Didn&#39;t doubt the truth of your own experience,<br/>
&gt; but I don&#39;t think it is reasonable to expect that to be the<br/>
&gt; experience of others. If it is, they know it, they aren&#39;t asking for<br/>
&gt; help, they&#39;re fine, right? When someone writes to the list about<br/>
&gt; being completely overwhelmed with several young children and feeling<br/>
&gt; like they can&#39;t do everything, what good does it do to tell them, &quot;It<br/>
&gt; IS possible to do it all - you ought to be keeping your house clean<br/>
&gt; and cooking three meals a day from scratch and, in fact, doing it<br/>
&gt; happily and easily while the kids go off and take some pleasant alone-<br/>
&gt; time of their own just when you happen to need them to do that so<br/>
&gt; that you can do housework or cook.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The message from your post was that the advice on alternative ways to<br/>
&gt; deal with and avoid housework and cooking was just to let people feel<br/>
&gt; less guilty about their failures as cooks and housekeepers. You<br/>
&gt; implied that the rest of us give unschooling a bad name because of<br/>
&gt; our slothfulness. I&#39;m not insulted or anything (I&#39;m way past that<br/>
&gt; stage of needy little ones and my house is nice and neat and clean<br/>
&gt; and I cook when and what I want), I&#39;m saying that it doesn&#39;t help<br/>
&gt; those who are asking for help to tell them that settling for less<br/>
&gt; that a clean house and 3 times a day cooking is what gives<br/>
&gt; unschooling a negative image.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-130824373">&quot; Let&#39;s talk about unschooling, not &quot;the unschooling life&quot; or<br/>
&quot;unschooling lifestyle.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That seems like a nuance to me but I&#39;m willing to examine it.<br/>
<br/>
One great way to cook scratch meals 3x a day and not neglect your <br/>
children is to  engage them about their favorite foods. Our kids help <br/>
grow the food, prepare the food (my oldest two beg to cook!). We have <br/>
gone through nutritional books together. We shop at a co-op together and <br/>
the kids have gotten to know the staff. We have what might be thought of <br/>
a &quot;dinner&quot; food for breakfast often, or vise versa, because that&#39;s what <br/>
the kids want to eat. It&#39;s a holistic approach towards eating.<br/>
<br/>
One great way to have a decluttered home and not neglect your children <br/>
is to talk to them about what kind of space they want for their own. <br/>
What does it look like? How do we make it that way? Sit and sort with <br/>
them, rather than &quot;tell&quot; them to clean it up. Go the home store together <br/>
to get the supplies; ask which parts (some, none, or all!) of the <br/>
process do they want to participate in (for instance, one of my children <br/>
is totally present in the design process but absent during demolition. <br/>
Another enjoys pulling out staples and knocking down walls but hates to <br/>
paint).<br/>
<br/>
Another thing we&#39;ve done to organize books to a certain extent is to <br/>
visit used book stores. The environment always stimulates the kids&#39; <br/>
minds to come home and see what they are no longer using to trade for <br/>
new ones! Their dad and I would probably just pile them up and build <br/>
more shelves :-). But our kids are more pragmatic...if they can get <br/>
something new for something they no longer use, they&#39;ll freely sort and <br/>
organize to make the trade.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve moved several times in the last few years. Keeping an eye on <br/>
layout is an important way to fascilitate a rich learning environment <br/>
that allows for both together and alone spaces. Our kitchen and eating <br/>
room is one big space and our library is just in the next room, through <br/>
a wide doorway.  We chose this over the very closed &quot;boxy&quot; other house <br/>
we were looking at when house shopping. The bedrooms are upstairs, which <br/>
has turned out to make a nice rhythm in the house.<br/>
<br/>
In our next house, we are considering a separate room  for clothing and <br/>
laundry...a sort of communal closet. It would eliminate the chore of <br/>
putting clothes  away and also clothing clutter in the bedrooms, freeing <br/>
them up for better sleep and private desk/studio space, something our <br/>
oldest two children want very much. Does anyone else do this in their home?<br/>

&gt; Yes, and it&#39;s fine that way. It&#39;s better that way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To discuss the ideas and not the people is way better.<br/>

&gt; Some I do know have very clean houses, and others don&#39;t, but when I<br/>
&gt; DO know someone in person, and know her kids and her house, it&#39;s that<br/>
&gt; much worse for me when someone newer, younger, cockier, is snarky to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-210195572">But many of us do not have introvert children.  Some children do not <br/>
want to be alone ever.  Some children are extremely high energy or <br/>
need a lot of assistance when playing with siblings or other kids.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s working out for you, that&#39;s wonderful.  But it just isn&#39;t <br/>
possible for some families to be engaged to the level that the <br/>
children need and also do a lot of cooking and cleaning.  Family <br/>
