<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862653996">We did lots of reading games to help my son. He desperately wanted to learn to read but has some issues that run in my family. My brother and I had both been labeled dyslexic and had gotten special help, back in the sixties and seventies. We were the only ones who were allowed to read anything we wanted, because the specialists told my mother that she had to let us choose the reading material. Out of five kids, the two dyslexics are voracious readers and the others don&#39;t read. It is wild. <br/>
<br/>
My older two sons picked up reading from being read to and from getting to read what they wanted but it was clear that my youngest one needed help because he really wanted to read. I hate and detest reading out loud and don&#39;t do it well. I am fine with little kiddy books that are fun and interesting but can&#39;t read chapter books out loud. I don&#39;t know if it a hang over from my dyslexia (along with the fact that I am the world&#39;s worst speller) but it is really hard for me. Anyway, I needed to help my youngest and we found some great options. <br/>
<br/>
We started off playing fun games like labeling items in the house with their names on sticky notes and then matching the names to cards. Kind of like a scavenger hunt and very active. So he would have a card and go find the sticky note with the word on it and then figure out what it was. He started figuring out words quicker and quicker. As soon as he mastered something and the game got boring, we would change it. He still loves to have me hide clues around as a hunt. Now I will describe something or make a riddle to figure out what it is and find the next clue. He loves doing them for friends and for me and will type them up on the computer. It is cute to see him go back and do easier versions for little kids. <br/>
<br/>
He also liked a game where I would put words on cards on the ground in front of him. He would jump to the word. We would also spread them out in a grid and I would say a word and he would jump to it etc. I would start by saying the word and pointing to it. He would read the word and jump to it. Then I would say the word without pointing. etc.<br/>
<br/>
Another favorite was short sentences on cards that he would act out. &quot;I can pat the cat. I can give mom a kiss. I can sit. I can stand. I can hop. I can jump.&quot; etc We would do individual words in the &#39;jump to&#39; game and then put them together. I would guess the sentence from what he would do. He would hand me the card after I guessed to make sure that he read the correct one. Of course, sometimes I would take the first turn etc. <br/>
<br/>
His older brothers always loved getting in on the games so sometimes they would go first to help demonstrate. <br/>
<br/>
He actually liked the Explode the Code workbook series. We did it together and he only did the fun pages that he wanted to do but it made a huge difference. After the first 2 books, he then started reading from the books that he liked to have read to him. I never had him read out loud but would sit next to him. When he had a word that he couldn&#39;t read, he would tap it and I would say the word. Now I will sometimes start new books for him until he gets a feel for them. <br/>
<br/>
Let me know if these appeal and if you want other similar ideas. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1354296298">With my oldest when he was four I played with a set of alphabet flash cards<br/>
and he learned the letters of the alphabet, and I think alphabetical order<br/>
from the song, and then he learned to read from whole word recognition<br/>
beginning with a book I read to him which had certain words repeating (and I<br/>
had been pointing to the words as I read).  He started recognising CAT in<br/>
other words and then his name and titles from computer games or TV shows and<br/>
I don&#39;t remember the rest, except writing or spelling the words he asked me<br/>
to.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest learned to write the letters of his name and a couple of others<br/>
when he was around 5 I guess, and then little else except some game title,<br/>
and function (PLAY, EXIT) or name recognition until he was around 8 and<br/>
wanted to do something more concentrated to learn to read.  Actually I guess<br/>
for some time he had been picking up some common words when I or his older<br/>
brother would type or spell for him the messages he wanted to send in games,<br/>
or perhaps from some pointing when reading together I don&#39;t remember.  Then<br/>
I began studying with him for maybe five minutes a day from a couple of<br/>
phonics books that demonstrated different combinations of letters that<br/>
create the same sounds and gave pictures and words using the different<br/>
combinations.  Within two months he was happily independently typing to<br/>
others in his online games and reading whatever he likes.<br/>
<br/>
The books we &#39;studied&#39; (a new page and refresh some old pages a day) were<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m confused!  First you said they know how to read and then you said<br/>
the youngest wants  you to teach him how to read.  My oldest is 14, she<br/>
learned how to read about 11/12.  Over the course of years she would<br/>
periodically want me to teach her how to read.  All of the books and<br/>
workbooks geared toward teaching reading are soooooo boring that my<br/>
daughter would toss the idea after a few minutes of some odd lesson or<br/>
other.  We found that it was simply better to read to her, listen to<br/>
books on tape/cd and play video games and such.<br/>
<br/>
I explained to her at the time that just because you sit down with<br/>
lessons and workbooks like they do in school, doesn&#39;t mean you will<br/>
magically figure it out.  It takes time and kids who do it with lessons<br/>
and workbooks are just memorizing and repeating things until they know<br/>
them, and they do it everyday for long periods of time.  I think because<br/>
she saw that to be true, she decided that other things were more<br/>
important to do with her time.  It really seems a waste of time when a<br/>
kid will figure it out anyway, eventually on their own terms in their<br/>
own time, in their own way.<br/>
<br/>
There are games you could play in the meantime that have a lot of words,<br/>
or you could write notes to him.  Something we did, was put the name of<br/>
things all over the house on little pieces of paper.  There were labels<br/>
for everything in our bathroom for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter attributes learning to read with playing toontown. <br/>
She says that it was the single most important thing she did that helped<br/>
her really learn to read and remember words.</div>

<br/>
Games are fun for sure and I&#39;m sure your kids liked them, but I&#39;m just<br/>
going to put this out there...<br/>
<br/>
If games are being played with the idea that you are secretly inserting<br/>
knowledge into them, then you are doing nothing more than being a<br/>
creative teacher.  The idea behind unschooling is to let go of<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;, let go of the ideas that kids need to learn this or that by<br/>
this or that time.<br/>
<br/>
There is something truly magical when a kid figures out how to read on<br/>
their own, in their own way, in their own time.  They own that process! <br/>
They don&#39;t give the credit to their teacher or their mom or some silly,<br/>
even fun, game.  They credit themselves and that goes a lllooonnnggg way<br/>
to giving them the confidence to discover everything else in the whole<br/>
wide world they may want or need to know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1777212643">&quot; Since my daughter was 2 1/2 she &#39;s been watching the leapfrog videos,<br/>
Letter factory and Talking words factory, I got fustrated last year<br/>
trying to teach her phonics even though she knew the letter sounds she<br/>
learned from the videos she just wasn&#39;t interested ,...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It might help you to know that some kids really don&#39;t &quot;get&quot; phonics, no<br/>
matter how hard a parent may try to implement it.  Phonics is but one<br/>
method of teaching reading to kids, and it&#39;s relatively new in the whole<br/>
scheme of things.  Personally, I think phonics does a lot of damage to<br/>
holistic reading.  When a kid learns how to read naturally, in their own<br/>
way and their own time, they are also learning how to spell, how to put<br/>
sentences together, how to use puncutation, how to put words together. <br/>
Phonics takes one little aspect of reading, called sounding out words,<br/>
and calls it reading.  Kids that I&#39;ve known that learned how to read<br/>
using phonics, have terrible spelling, and their spelling instinct is to<br/>
spell phonetically, which,within the english language, doesn&#39;t work most<br/>
of the time.  I think phonics does a terrible disservice to kids in many<br/>
many ways!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...so I decided to leave it alone at least until this year when she<br/>
will be in kindergartner, but a few months ago she started to read 3<br/>
letter words all by herself, it seem to be that some kids learn certain<br/>
things when they feel like at least that is the way my daughter learn so<br/>
I will just follow her clues and let her thrive at her own pace.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Why leave it along until this year, why not leave it alone for good?! <br/>
If your child is reading three letter words, then she&#39;s reading three<br/>
letter words.  Let it go, breathe, stop worrying about the big hairy<br/>
subject of READING.  So, yes, follow her clues and let her thrive at her<br/>
own pace.  Let go of bench marks and what a kid should know or be doing<br/>
at a certain age.  It&#39;s all very very contrived.<br/>

Adventures&quot; online.  (We started with the free trial, then bought it <br/>
cause he loved it.) <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.popcap.com/games/bookworm?s_kwcid=bookworm%20adventures|">http://www.popcap.com/games/bookworm?s_kwcid=bookworm%20adventures|</a>2243256468&gclid=CKKS4LGzkJQCFSgtagodClINeQ<br/>
It&#39;s a Boggle-like game with a worm who has battles against storybook <br/>
creatures.  Nicky wanted to play when he saw a friend playing it, but <br/>
he was afraid he couldn&#39;t do it.  I helped him by figuring out <br/>
phonetically spelled words that were there, simple at first and <br/>
helping him figure out how to spell them.  He quickly took over <br/>
figuring out how they were spelled.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of months he noticed that he could figure out a lot <br/>
of words on signs and such and then an occasional frame in a comic <br/>
strip.  The comic strips (and books, eventually) were great because <br/>
it&#39;s easy to take it one frame at a time and feel successful.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s key - feeling successful enough to be confident to try <br/>
a little more and then you learn to read more by reading.  I don&#39;t <br/>
think that success or confidence has to come from phonics at all - <br/>
that&#39;s just one way.  I&#39;ve been re-reading Frank Smith&#39;s &quot;Reading <br/>
Without <br/>
Nonsense.&quot; <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Without-Nonsense-Frank-Smith/dp/0807734721">http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Without-Nonsense-Frank-Smith/dp/0807734721</a> <br/>
What a fabulous book!  I liked it when I was a teacher and was <br/>
pleased to find it still spoke to me as an unschooling mom.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Getting&quot; reading comes from coming to see yourself as a member of <br/>
the reading club.  Some kids seem to get this when they think that <br/>
sitting down thumbing through picture books is reading; by <br/>
considering themselves to be able to do it, it opens the door for <br/>
them to make that print into meaning in their own way.  I think these <br/>
are often the ones who teach themselves young. Other kids get the <br/>
confidence by having someone help them until they realize that they <br/>
can do it themselves.  Nicky was in that group.<br/>
<br/>
I think we all have to come to realize that sense can be made of <br/>
what&#39;s on the page and that we have the ability to figure it <br/>
out.  And for each of us, it&#39;s a slightly different path, inspiration <br/>
or breakthrough.  The challenge for us unschooling parents is knowing <br/>
our kids well enough to make some good guesses as to where they will <br/>
find that path and help them toward it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-620073507">I didn&#39;t mention that my son was the one who came up with the game ideas. My son just loves games and is always trying to get people to play with him. He is also a fencer and is going to be fencing at Nationals in another week. He is so excited. He loves board games, computer games, sports, logic puzzles, etc. I said he loves sports, but only ones that are games. Is isn&#39;t the competition that he likes but the rules. I hate playing board games and would rather hike than do a sports game any day. Watching sports is torture for me. Any time that I can find games that are fun for he and I to do together, it is a big plus. It is not that I am trying to disguise learning as games but that all he wants to do is &quot;play games&quot;. Except reading. He loves to read now and it gives me a break when there aren&#39;t others around for him to play games with. <br/>
<br/>
Summer is bliss for him since he can do baseball, soccer, fencing, flag football and all his favorites. During the school year, he can only do sports after school or some rare homeschool sports activities during the day. Rather than homeschooling, he would much rather be at a school that had sports and games all day. Groups of kids with sports and games to choose from going from one activity to another. That is his idea of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Some of the logic puzzles and paper and pencil games that we do together in the winter are our compromise for the fact that he can&#39;t play flag football in our living room with 5-13 other kids. He has learned to make games out of going to stores, riding in the car, hiking, even brushing his teeth. <br/>
<br/>
Preventing him from turning everything that he wants to do or learn into a game would be on my list of &quot;how not to unschool&quot;. <br/>

Games are fun for sure and I&#39;m sure your kids liked them, but I&#39;m just<br/>
going to put this out there...<br/>
<br/>
If games are being played with the idea that you are secretly inserting<br/>
knowledge into them, then you are doing nothing more than being a<br/>
creative teacher. The idea behind unschooling is to let go of<br/>
&quot;teaching&quot;, let go of the ideas that kids need to learn this or that by<br/>
this or that time.<br/>
<br/>
There is something truly magical when a kid figures out how to read on<br/>
their own, in their own way, in their own time. They own that process! <br/>
They don&#39;t give the credit to their teacher or their mom or some silly,<br/>
even fun, game. They credit themselves and that goes a lllooonnnggg way<br/>
to giving them the confidence to discover everything else in the whole<br/>
wide world they may want or need to know.<br/>

Hey, if that&#39;s where a person is and they need to see learning happen  <br/>
without schoolishness, and a period of what could be interpretted as  <br/>
&quot;creative teaching&quot; passes, here&#39;s what matters:<br/>
<br/>
Were the kids having fun?  Did they have the option to wander off and  <br/>
do something else?  Was the mom willing to be redirected to other  <br/>
kinds of activities?  Were they really just (&quot;just&quot;) playing?<br/>
<br/>
If so, no harm/no foul.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The idea behind unschooling is to let go of &quot;teaching&quot;, let go of  <br/>
the ideas that kids need to learn this or that by this or that time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes, but some people take it too far.  People can create and  <br/>
encourage and provide learning environments like crazy and still  <br/>
maintain their unschooling integrity.  If that&#39;s not so, then  <br/>
unschooling could become the avoidance of anything that looks like or  <br/>
might lead to learning.<br/>
<br/>
Once in a discussion like this (on unschooling.com message board of  <br/>
olden days) I suggested that critical thinking would be good, for  <br/>
someone who was thrashing wildly from one extreme to another and  <br/>
being suspicious of others&#39; veracity and motives in writing and  <br/>
trying to help her.<br/>
<br/>
At the mention of &quot;critical thinking,&quot; she went crazy and said NO,  <br/>
she wasn&#39;t going to even consider critical thinking and no one should  <br/>
suggest it because it sounded like something they taught in school.<br/>
<br/>
Cripes, so is which way&#39;s north and that plants need water and sunshine.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t avoid learning.  Don&#39;t wait years and years for something to  <br/>
arise naturally without the mom&#39;s introducing it.  That&#39;s what  <br/>
strewing can be for.  If  you realize your child has never seen a  <br/>
bird&#39;s nest up close in person, and you find one, BRING IT IN!   <br/>
(unless it has mites on it or something gross)  If your child hasn&#39;t  <br/>
played with magnets or soap bubbles, GET SOME!<br/>
<br/>
Any creative teacher would do that. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
What kind of person would decide against doing that because it might  <br/>
lead directly to learning?<br/>

very early on, I decided that there were better ways.  It felt deceptive<br/>

she&#39;d probably play educational games disguised as &quot;just another fun<br/>

are fun.  All of those things can be really fun.  My objection, in<br/>
general, is that kids like all these fun things, and adults take these<br/>
fun things and turn them into &quot;teaching&quot; moments.<br/>
<br/>
I agree about bringing things in, and showing things to kids, and giving<br/>
kids ideas and opportunities that they otherwise wouldn&#39;t know existed. <br/>
That is largely what we do at our house.  If the whole wide world is for<br/>
learning from and exploring, then I&#39;ll try my very best to bring as much<br/>
of that to them, or them to it.<br/>
<br/>
I see homeschool moms spend loads of time making all that teaching<br/>
material &quot;fun&quot;, when really the kids just want to play.  I consciously<br/>
focus on the fun and tuck away the teachable moments.  People can&#39;t help<br/>
but learn things, especially when they are having fun.  I don&#39;t want all<br/>
those fun learning moments to be contrived teachable moments.  I could<br/>
easily go there, I&#39;ve done it, and I avoid it because I know I go there.</div>

Here I was, wanting to write something similar, but I was not sure I<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I LOVED map books we had when the kids were little.  Schools would  <br/>
have used them for geography.  I used them because maps are FUN.   <br/>
Maps are great.  Kirby learned maps from Super Mario, the game  <br/>
guide.  Marty learned from some school-supply kits of pictures of a  <br/>
zoo, with an aerial view,and then a map, and then a &quot;ground view&quot;  <br/>
like if you were in the parking lot, and then you&#39;re inside the zoo,  <br/>
and there are questions about where you go to get to the giraffe or  <br/>
the merry go round or whatever.   They were Great.  Nice art.<br/>
<br/>
There were books about kids&#39; maps of their neighborhoods (one  <br/>
Australian, one American).  There was a book from Discovery Toys  <br/>
showing different points of view of the same scene, with time passing  <br/>
in some of the small details, and an aerial view of the whole thing,  <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
The difference between me pulling that out to play with  Marty,  <br/>
KNOWING (not just hoping) he would learn from it and teachers using  <br/>
the same materials is that if the teachers had a requirement to  <br/>
&quot;cover maps&quot; they needed to do something with everyone in the room  <br/>
together (it came with ditto masters for making copies, which I threw  <br/>
away).  They would need to &quot;keep people on task.&quot;  Marty and I pulled  <br/>
that out five or six times  over a couple of  years.  If he wasn&#39;t in  <br/>
the mood, it didn&#39;t happen! If he was, cool.   He showed it to Holly  <br/>
and explained it to her one time.  He showed some friends of his.<br/>
<br/>
I was fine with it lasting a minute or an hour.  THAT is the big  <br/>
telling difference.<br/>
<br/>
My kids all drive.  They all have full licenses.  It&#39;s not okay with  <br/>
me for them to get old enough to drive and have no idea how to read a  <br/>
map.  When we&#39;ve had map needs, I&#39;ve shown them if they wanted to  <br/>
see.  They DID want to see most of the time.  And gradually they  <br/>
became competent with maps.  Marty drove to Kirby&#39;s apartment in  <br/>
Austin.  Holly knows parts of town I don&#39;t know, and she knows them  <br/>
well, with a map in her head she could write down well.<br/>
<br/>
There are things kids need to know, and there are fun and easy and  <br/>
maybe sneaky (I prefer to think of it as painless) ways to help them  <br/>
at least know the things exist.  We made a song of our address when  <br/>
Kirby was little so he could learn it.  I don&#39;t remember the song any  <br/>
more, but it worked and it took maybe four or five minutes.<br/>

Do you mean to sort your games out, educational and non-educational,  <br/>
and only play the not-overtly-educational games?<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps you were feeling deceptive, but there were ways to change  <br/>
your feelings (or rather there are ways to change the feelings of  <br/>
people who are on the list today trying to figure out how to proceed,  <br/>
and I don&#39;t want them to think that having educational games is  <br/>
something to feel &quot;guilty&quot; about.<br/>

<br/>
Some do, some don&#39;t, some just let them unfold however they unfold.   <br/>
That&#39;s a better goal, I think, than first reading the box to see  <br/>
whether the mom should feel sneaky, deceptive or guilty.<br/>
<br/>
Zoombinis, when it was new, was one of the coolest computer games  <br/>
that had ever been, but it was clearly covering mathematical  <br/>
concepts.  Not numbers, but patterns.  That&#39;s nothing to feel guilty  <br/>
about having and playing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you should go there with a new confidence and let it turn  <br/>
heavily educational or not.  Moments when kids really want to know  <br/>
something WILL start coming very naturally when the mom stops  <br/>
counting, sorting, agonizing and second guessing.  Learn to be the  <br/>
same calm way whether you&#39;re watching poop jokes or a presidential  <br/>
funeral.  That&#39;s progress. &lt;g&gt;  (And then if your kid&#39;s depressed,  <br/>
avoid watching the funeral, but I think that topic is on another  <br/>
list...)<br/>
<br/>
In the past week I&#39;ve had long conversations with my kids as follows,  <br/>
with no strewing on my part:<br/>
<br/>
Kirby, about political process and voter registration and changing  <br/>
states.<br/>
<br/>
Marty, about automobile registration realities, options, details;  <br/>
about comprehensive insurance.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, about female reproductive stuff and unusual spotty periods and  <br/>
social and physical aspects of teen pregnancy (she&#39;s not pregnant,  <br/>
but we talked about what ifs and who dids and what&#39;s whats).<br/>
<br/>
When unschooling gets working well, it will build on itself, like a  <br/>
siphon that keeps on going and going.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/stages">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/stages</a><br/>
<br/>
Kelly Lovejoy described this pretty well.  But when someone hasn&#39;t  <br/>
really started unschooling yet because there&#39;s no agreement, then  <br/>
doing educational things that are also fun is just fine.  If someone  <br/>
really wants to move toward unschooling fully, they might want to  <br/>
change the way they see things and move away from the known-to-be- <br/>
educational materials.<br/>
<br/>
Once they&#39;re fully confident, there might come a point where it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter anymore.  (I changed it from &quot;will&quot; to &quot;can&quot; to  <br/>

Okay, where was I going with that?  I guess I just feel like there <br/>
are many times everyday when we are having fun and the kids are <br/>
learning and I recognize that and try to capitalize on it a little.  <br/>
I even bought my DD print writing and cursive writing workbooks <br/>
because she loves writing letters so much and wants to learn to spell <br/>
things and write in a way that people can read easily.  And she wants <br/>
to write like a princess, which in her world is cursive writing.  She <br/>
pulls them out when she wants, I help her as requested, and she just <br/>
writes and writes.  For her this is fun, if I had my DS do the same <br/>
thing it would not be unscholing though because he would never (at <br/>
least at this point in his life) choose to sit and write things in <br/>
workbooks.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1746995978"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Do you mean to sort your games out, educational and non-educational,<br/>
&gt; and only play the not-overtly-educational games?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a kid is having fun with a game, so what if it was designed to be<br/>
&gt; &quot;about&quot; math or language or history? So what?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, not sort out our games, but play games for the sake of game play,<br/>
not for the sake of inserting knowledge.  A few years ago, my mom bought<br/>
an online subscription to a reading game thing.  We checked it out and<br/>
decided that we probably wouldn&#39;t use it and told her to get her money<br/>
back because it was really expensive.  I had to finally convince my dad<br/>
to return it since I knew his frugality would win out over my mom&#39;s<br/>
stubborn insistence on the value of learning how to read through an<br/>
online education game.<br/>
<br/>
The games were fun and the graphics were cool, but at the time my<br/>
daughter was more into playing toontown and would hands down choose to<br/>
play toontown over the reading games.  My mother had purchased it<br/>
because I had been telling her about how much Chamille was learning how<br/>
to read by playing toontown.  In her mind, she made the connection of<br/>
learning how to read through online game play and thought it would be a<br/>
good way to help Chamille along in her reading acquisition.  So while it<br/>
was a generous offer, it was meant to replace toontown with something<br/>
geared specifically towards learning how to read.  Toontown was a fun<br/>
game that we all enjoyed with the side effect of learning how to read.<br/>
<br/>
If Chamille had been totally into the reading games, we surely would&#39;ve<br/>
accepted the generous gift and played the fun games.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-I&#39;ve been guilty of doing the creative teaching thing. At some<br/>
&gt; point very early on, I decided that there were better ways. It felt<br/>
&gt; deceptive to me. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Perhaps you were feeling deceptive, but there were ways to change<br/>
&gt; your feelings (or rather there are ways to change the feelings of<br/>
&gt; people who are on the list today trying to figure out how to proceed,<br/>
&gt; and I don&#39;t want them to think that having educational games is<br/>
&gt; something to feel &quot;guilty&quot; about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have really given this a lot of thought!  Good thing it wasn&#39;t on<br/>
learn nothing day!  I think, for me, it goes back to when I was teaching<br/>
dance classes at preschools.  They wanted me to  include adding and<br/>
subtracting and the alphabet and all that.  I wanted to teach dance.  I<br/>
was able to do what they asked, but it felt deceptive to dance about the<br/>
alphabet and jump 3 + 3.  As if there is something inherintly not<br/>
valuable about dance in and of itself, and that somehow because dance<br/>
was fun and enjoyable, &quot;hey why not teach something at the same time&quot;,<br/>
because kids learn better when they are having fun.  My own thinking<br/>
was, &quot;why can&#39;t the kids learn about how their body moves, why can&#39;t<br/>
that be as valuable as learning the alphabet?&quot;.  That isn&#39;t the way our<br/>
culture thinks.  The arts are marginalized, not valuable in and of<br/>
themselves, but somehow we can use the arts to teach math and reading<br/>
and and and .... whatever else might be on the benchmark tests.<br/>
<br/>
In fact the local arts charter school uses that very logic to get<br/>
parents to send their kids to the arts school.  See, they can learn how<br/>
to dance which is something they want to do, but the parents can rest<br/>
assured knowing that their kids will be learning about math through the<br/>
angles of the bodies and the trajectory of the jump, etc.  GAG!<br/>
<br/>
I think about all those poor kids that I helped to corrupt in how they<br/>
viewed dance.  Okay, I do feel guilty of that!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-I don&#39;t want all those fun learning moments to be contrived<br/>
&gt; teachable moments. I could easily go there, I&#39;ve done it, and I avoid<br/>
&gt; it because I know I go there.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Maybe you should go there with a new confidence and let it turn<br/>
&gt; heavily educational or not. Moments when kids really want to know<br/>
&gt; something WILL start coming very naturally when the mom stops<br/>
&gt; counting, sorting, agonizing and second guessing. Learn to be the<br/>
&gt; same calm way whether you&#39;re watching poop jokes or a presidential<br/>
&gt; funeral. That&#39;s progress. &lt;g&gt; (And then if your kid&#39;s depressed,<br/>
&gt; avoid watching the funeral, but I think that topic is on another<br/>
&gt; list...)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe.  Knowing the difference helps, knowing that distinction helps. <br/>
Knowing that its all opportunity for learning helps.  Still I can&#39;t help<br/>
feeling that feeling of dishonesty when something is overtly<br/>
&quot;teacherly&quot;.  It gives me a feeling of being dishonest and perhaps that<br/>
is where I should dig deeper.<br/>
<br/>
It took a lot of thought to let go of learning objectives and to stop<br/>
viewing the world in that manner that school holds in such high regard. <br/>
I see my kids for who they are, not what they know, however what they<br/>
know is cool and ever expanding, largely because we don&#39;t squash it or<br/>
place values on it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Kelly Lovejoy described this pretty well. But when someone hasn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; really started unschooling yet because there&#39;s no agreement, then<br/>
&gt; doing educational things that are also fun is just fine. If someone<br/>
&gt; really wants to move toward unschooling fully, they might want to<br/>
&gt; change the way they see things and move away from the known-to-be-<br/>
&gt; educational materials.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, this is something that I used to do, mostly to quell the doubts of<br/>
others, including my husband.  Mostly, in the past few years, I don&#39;t<br/>
really care about the naysayers, and my husband is totally on board with<br/>
unschooling.  So, educational anything seems contrived, especially<br/>
educational for the sake of being educational, even if it happens to be<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
So for the sake of fun, would my kiddo enjoy a rousing game of hopscotch<br/>
or a game involving jumping and number manipulation for the sake of<br/>
learning number manipulation?  They could be one and the same!  It&#39;s my<br/>
distinction that makes the difference as well as how well my kid enjoys<br/>
the game.</div>

<br/>
Well that would be traumatizing.  I think kids will figure out a lot  <br/>
of math on their own from dance, because if it&#39;s in four, you&#39;re  <br/>
going to come up with 16s and 32s, and if in 3, you&#39;re not getting to  <br/>
any 16s.  And it will take two measures or four to get back to  <br/>
starting on the foot you started on (if you&#39;re in three).<br/>
<br/>
But I see the musical side of dancing (and the math side of music).   <br/>
I don&#39;t see the spelling side at all.<br/>
<br/>
We have overtly educational games--tons of them.  We didn&#39;t  <br/>
necessarily play them &quot;right.&quot;  We rarely felt obligated to play ANY  <br/>
game &quot;right.&quot;  We play encore without the game board, always team on  <br/>
team.  We&#39;ve made up house rules to lots of things.  A friend gave us  <br/>
a set of Cuisenaire (sp?) rods, and some laminated papers to go with  <br/>
them.  The papers were ***STUPID*** and I don&#39;t use that word  <br/>
lightly; I don&#39;t use that word much at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I woke up this morning thinking I really should&#39;ve put on the &quot;how to  <br/>
screw up unschooling&quot; list &quot;Call things &#39;stupid.&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t take this back.  With these very nice-to-feel  <br/>
proportional &quot;math manipulatives,&quot; they were forming letters by  <br/>
putting different rods on different outlined places on a laminated  <br/>
mat.  And the numbers were there.  On the P, there were some long  <br/>
pieces for the vertical line, and then on the round part there were  <br/>
some twos, and two threes and a four I think.  UNDOUBTEDLY some  poor  <br/>
kid (or a few hundred thousand) kept in mind that a P is made up of  <br/>
some threes and a four and... and it has nothing whatsoever on earth  <br/>
or in heaven (or hel) to do with it.  Nothing.<br/>
<br/>
So we didn&#39;t use those.  I showed them to my kids who said, &quot;WHAT!?&quot;  <br/>
and then went on doing something maybe as equally unrelated to the  <br/>
designer&#39;s intent, but of their own choosing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The things they learn with cuisenaire rods, they can learn with Lego,  <br/>
but still those rods are pretty and they sound good when they clink  <br/>
together, and we still have them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Still I can&#39;t help feeling that feeling of dishonesty when  <br/>
something is overtly &quot;teacherly&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think unschooled kids have the same responses to &quot;teacherly&quot;  <br/>
as those of us who were teachered nearly to death, though.  And  <br/>
things themselves aren&#39;t usually teacherly.  It&#39;s the way they&#39;re  <br/>
presented, valued, used...  Except video games.  They can be  <br/>
teacherly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I used to play a computer game called Math Arena.  It would  <br/>
clearly have thrilled teachers for kids to play it in their  <br/>
classrooms.  It was pretty fun, though.  It was about area and volume  <br/>
and shapes and estimations and things that can be done quickly and  <br/>
without many numbers involved.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So for the sake of fun, would my kiddo enjoy a rousing game of  <br/>
hopscotch or a game involving jumping and number manipulation for the  <br/>
sake of learning number manipulation? They could be one and the same!  <br/>
It&#39;s my distinction that makes the difference as well as how well my  <br/>
kid enjoys the game.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the mom&#39;s reaction makes a difference in their choice, then maybe  <br/>
that could be a problem.  If the mom is steering a kid away from  <br/>
something just because it reminds the mom of school or she thinks  <br/>
unschoolers are supposed to shun &quot;learning activities,&quot; that&#39;s not good.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I think the people who first came up with the idea DID intend for it  <br/>
to involve real-life situations.  There&#39;s an alternative school here,  <br/>
The Family School, that does half days of unit studies, but more like  <br/>
a theme for the year.  Once when I was paying attention, long ago,  <br/>
the theme was &quot;treasure.&quot;  The school was newer then.  When they were  <br/>
talking about something like the reclamation of a sunken ship, or  <br/>
something, they talked about real things--geography, history,  <br/>
politics (whose ship was it and why was it down there?) and such.   <br/>
That&#39;s cool.  It wasn&#39;t so contrived.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some abominable misses on unit studies, though, such as  <br/>
Joyce is referring to.  Instead of talking about how much wire it  <br/>
would take to fence a field, how many posts, how many brads (unless  <br/>
they&#39;re using steel poles, and maybe the expense of steel vs. wood  <br/>
could be discussed), no... it&#39;s if there are six horses in this field  <br/>
and thirteen in the other...  And they just stop with a total. They  <br/>
don&#39;t go on to how much feed they&#39;ll need or ANYthing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
