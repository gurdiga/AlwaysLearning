<div id="ygrps-yiv-39385522">&lt;&lt;In unschooling, how does one handle character issues?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I try to handle these situations with my kids the same way I would with an<br/>
adult, meaning whether or not I would say something to my dh about a<br/>
behavior tries to be my deciding line.  Sometimes I&#39;m really good at it.<br/>
Yesterday, I sucked  :(<br/>
<br/>
But I wouldn&#39;t let my dh say things that were mean to me, I wouldn&#39;t let it<br/>
just ride.  Even if he were having a bad day, I would say something like, &quot;I<br/>
know today isn&#39;t going the way you wanted, but it isn&#39;t my fault and the<br/>
things you are saying hurt my feelings.&quot;  I say the same kinds of things to<br/>
my kids.    A couple of days ago, Adriane (11) was really being snotty and<br/>
short tempered and I said something like the above to her.  In a little<br/>
while, she came to me and apologized, talked to me about what was stressing<br/>
her and we worked to fix the problem.<br/>
<br/>
I talked with my 3yo today about how it hurts people&#39;s feelings when they<br/>
are called stupid.  I didn&#39;t punish him or yell at him, but I talked with<br/>
him about it.  I don&#39;t think unschooling is about saying that mean behavior<br/>
or whatever is ok for children.  Only that because the kids are learning,<br/>
they are going to make mistakes (just like adults) and we need to know that<br/>
and expect it and not shame them because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Question--why is it &quot;indignation&quot; in an adult and a &quot;tantrum&quot; in a kid?<br/>
<br/>
Julie--who had a tantrum yesterday that would have made any 2yo proud  :(</div>
