<div id="ygrps-yiv-1946062472">the thread regarding badges and school reports brings another issue to mind for<br/>
me.  i&#39;m curious as to how you all feel about martial arts classes in general.<br/>
on son jake&#39;s request, we tried a kinder kung fu class, but i was very put off by<br/>
it.  i was prepared for the psuedo-uniform and even expected the teacher to bark<br/>
orders, but i couldn&#39;t handle the performance rewards and punishments, simple<br/>
though they were.  for example, if a child didn&#39;t listen to a direction, he or<br/>
she was required to do push-ups or some other extra (and harder) physical<br/>
activity.  if a child didn&#39;t perform a stance as quickly as the other kids, he or<br/>
she was &quot;out&quot; and benched for several minutes.  and here&#39;s what really got me:<br/>
if a child said that a certain move was uncomfortable or painful (such as bending<br/>
from the waist and touching the floor with flat palms, which all of the girls<br/>
could do but most of the boys could not), they were told that it &quot;doesn&#39;t really<br/>
hurt&quot; or that they &quot;aren&#39;t trying hard enough.&quot;  mind you, it was all done with a<br/>
smile and a laugh -- the teacher did not come across to the children as mean or<br/>
authoritarian -- but authoritarian it was, just the same.  for us, part of<br/>
unschooling is to encourage our child to question directions to ensure<br/>
understanding, go at his own pace, and listen to his own needs (including those<br/>
of his physical body), and i just can&#39;t seem to resolve the military style of<br/>
martial arts with a holistic unschooling approach to living and learning.  i know<br/>
this summer my son will ask to take the class again -- his enjoyment of the sheer<br/>
&quot;physicality&quot; of it overrides his frustration when the teacher tells him his legs<br/>
don&#39;t really hurt.  and, of course, being an unschooling family, shouldn&#39;t we<br/>
just follow his lead?!  what are your thoughts?<br/>

Try other schools.  They&#39;re not all as you describe.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t generalize what you saw there to all martial arts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-651230918">do you think differences are based mainly on type of martial art (kung fu vs.<br/>
karate vs. tai chi etc)?  or are the differences based mainly on teaching<br/>
style?<br/>

There are dojos where that is not the attitude -- where students are asked to <br/>
do their best, but not to exceed their physical/mental limits.  sheesh.<br/>

<br/>
Teaching style.<br/>
Partly the traditions of the schools themselves (schools within &quot;styles&quot;), <br/>
but I doubt it&#39;s the style itself.  I could be wrong.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198285562">thanks for the input.  i&#39;ll call around to the local schools and try to get a<br/>
feel for their teaching style.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-668049922">My boys are taking Tae-Kwon-Do classes through an organization called Young Olympians (kinda dorky name) and I&#39;m very impressed with the teachers attitude towards students. He is firm and demands respect (as a martial arts teacher should be) but is kind and relates well with the kids at the same time. My kids really enjoy taking classes from him. Sometimes I am amazed at the level of discipline they *take* from him when they do not handle this sort of discipline from me at all.<br/>
<br/>
I would tend to think that differences in martial arts classes commonly stem from different teaching styles and personalities of instructors and maybe how *they* were taught.<br/>
