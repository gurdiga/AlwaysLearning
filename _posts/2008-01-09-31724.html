<div id="ygrps-yiv-879938786">We&#39;ve been hm&#39;schoolers for about forever, unschooling for 10 yrs at least. My dilemma is how do you all handle helping your teens move out into the working world? It seems that a GED is required for almost any job around here except the food service industry.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest dd, now 23 and a mom herself took her GED test at age 18 and did very well. She regrets not pursing college tho, and now that she&#39;s a mom, really doesn&#39;t have the time or money. My middle daughter is 17 and has been going to GED classes for about 6 months, she really struggles with the math aspect and regrets not spending more time when she was younger preparing in that area. We&#39;ve never been a mathy family, my dd&#39;s always leaned more to the arts, music and writing. <br/>
<br/>
Ok.. so now I&#39;m wondering about my youngest dd, who&#39;s 12 yrs old.... her oldest sister is really against hm&#39;scooling now, and thinks I should require her sister to do more &#39;school&#39; type work. My middle dd, although she has no hm&#39;school regrets, thinks that it would be a good thing to not have to go thru the whole GED route, she feels it is a tough environment and embarrassing and hopes that her younger sister won&#39;t have to go though the same.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling pretty down these days, to say the least. <br/>

<br/>
We&#39;ve just said &quot;homeschooled throughout&quot; instead of GED when asked,  <br/>
and my kids have worked.<br/>
<br/>
Another friend of ours got a promotion at work for getting a GED.  He  <br/>
was working phone tech/help and was doing better than anyone else  <br/>
there, but they couldn&#39;t promote him over them because some were  <br/>
grumbling that he had &quot;never finished high school&quot; (true), so he got  <br/>
a GED for that purpose, and makes good money.<br/>
<br/>
Marty said something about a GED yesterday, for going to the  <br/>
university, but I told him he&#39;d just need to take an ACT test.  Then  <br/>
Keith reminded us both that he needed neither of those for the  <br/>
community college, and once he has &quot;some college,&quot; the rest will  <br/>
never matter again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343991982">I&#39;ve wondered about doing that, printing a certificate myself, <br/>
something to consider for my youngest maybe. So far both my older dd&#39;s <br/>
have only worked in food service type jobs.. with the exception of my <br/>
older dd teaching gymnastics for a year. <br/>
<br/>
Even the factory that my mom works at requires to see a diploma or GED. <br/>
I guess things have changed since I graduated, as I don&#39;t remember ever <br/>
having to actually &#39;show&#39; anyone my diploma, I just checked the box <br/>
that yes, I had graduated or completed 12 yrs or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also sad that my eldest daughter feels like she was &#39;cheated&#39; out <br/>
of an education. But I know there are other issues with her too, being <br/>
a new mom and maybe regreting things that she didn&#39;t do when she still <br/>
had no other responsiblites. Right now she plans to send her daughter <br/>
to preschool even..but that&#39;s still a couple yrs in the future, so <br/>
things could change. Thanks for your thots... julie<br/>

But  maybe she can to to the Vo-Tech school without the GED.<br/>

And maybe she could take the GED without so much study.  You don&#39;t  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424224329">There are some online colleges that are accredited and useful for <br/>
building credits for some future purpose.  <br/>
<br/>
Rio Salado Community College (riosalado.com) is located here in <br/>
Arizona, but they specialize in online education and anyone can take <br/>
an online class, not just Arizonans.  University of Phoenix <br/>
(www.phoenix.edu) is also mostly online.  Crazy prices on both <br/>
compared to local colleges, so maybe you can find a local online <br/>
college to at least save you on out of state/county tuition.<br/>
<br/>
DS(16) is taking English 101 at the local cc, starting next week.  <br/>
There was no problem signing him up. I enrolled him online, he went <br/>
on campus, took the placement test, filled out the registration for <br/>
the course, showed the counselor his test score paper, counselor <br/>
signed, registrar registered and bookstore and cashier took our <br/>
money. :)  No problem.  Oh, and prove his citizenship by signing a <br/>
paper...<br/>
<br/>
A friend had the same experience with her boys - no school until 16, <br/>
then community college with no problem and the older one will <br/>
graduate from Georgetown this year.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if she&#39;s interested in the vo-tech, check to see if it is free <br/>
for students under 21 without a diploma.  Vo-techs tend to be high <br/>
school supplements.  I taught at our local vo-tech and that was the <br/>
rule.  The one place it&#39;s good not to have a diploma - I had one <br/>
student that was purposely avoiding getting his diploma so that he <br/>
could take several classes at the vo-tech. :)  Smart, I thought.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241805089">I have a GED that I only studied for because my dad managed to pull a few strings and get me into a class in Omaha that paid me 10 dollars a day to go to. I&#39;d go twice a week &#39;cause 20 bucks was what I needed to buy a carton of cigarettes. It wasn&#39;t really that hard. And you can take it again and again and again. The trick is probably just familiarizing whomever is taking the test with the testing experience. So buy a GED practice book or go play through the test samples at a site like<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://steckvaughn.harcourtachieve.com/en-US/gedtestmenu.">http://steckvaughn.harcourtachieve.com/en-US/gedtestmenu.</a> I&#39;ve been fascinated with the difference in the U.S. exam system from the UK exam system all this morning taking different sample tests. It is kind of fun.<br/>

happier for it!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  We worked with the local community college last year and enrolled my <br/>
17 ds in vocational classes. However, the college told us they had many <br/>
other classes availible for homeschool or private schooled children, no <br/>
certificates or geds or whatever required. My ds has a job in the <br/>
automotive electronics industry and his company paid the tuition in <br/>
order for him to advance in his profssion. As a side note, Mchenry <br/>
community colleg is the only college in IL. that does not accept <br/>
funding help. <br/>
