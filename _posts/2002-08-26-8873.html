<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042159741">In the Sunday Globe magazine section, the weekly interview is with Joe Perry,<br/>
guitarist for Aerosmith.  The first question is &quot;How different are the<br/>
Perrys from the Osbournes?&quot;  Answer?  &quot;Ozzy goes on the road and the kids<br/>
stay home.  We all go.  We home-school our kids.&quot;<br/>
