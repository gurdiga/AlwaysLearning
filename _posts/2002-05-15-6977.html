<div id="ygrps-yiv-172201371">&lt;&lt;Another very reasonable fear I have is sharks.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter had this fear for years. When she was about 12 there <br/>
was a period of time in which she was afraid to get into the bathtub <br/>
(clear water, no bubbles) because of sharks! She&#39;d laugh about it, but <br/>
it was a real fear.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m afraid of dying while I&#39;m out of town, so I usually have a whole <br/>
day<br/>
before each out-of-town trip dedicated to doing little oddments of stuff <br/>
that<br/>
I&#39;d be really embarrassed to be caught not having done if I don&#39;t make it<br/>
back after the weekend or whatever.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t make it back, you couldn&#39;t be &quot;caught&quot;! Unless you hover <br/>
over your funeral and listen to people nudging each other, saying <br/>
&quot;Tsk-tsk! Did you hear she had the audacity to die without sweeping her <br/>
front step?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;m afraid of falling asleep while I&#39;m driving.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m driving from MN to NV in a couple weeks to meet my husband, who&#39;s <br/>
coming home from Australia. I have to schedule in an extra day just to <br/>
make sure I arrive alive, since I know all-too-well that feeling of <br/>
starting to nod off at the wheel.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Eric&#39;s coming home! When I meet him in Las Vegas (avoids me having to <br/>
driving into LA and gets us affordable loding and food) it will have <br/>
been three months since I last saw him. I can hardly wait. He wanted to <br/>
fly directly home, but our house (remember the overflowing upstairs <br/>
toilet and ensuing damage?) won&#39;t be ready yet, so I had to tell him I <br/>
wanted/needed a vacation.<br/>
<br/>
Oops, speaking of the house, the workmen are here and I need to talk to <br/>
them....<br/>

knows whose it is or that it&#39;s borrowed.  Mailing things I promised to mail.  <br/>
It&#39;s more along the lines of fulfilling verbal agreements and making sure <br/>
important things will be found and distributed or completed as they need to <br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
When I did big newsletters and other publications (board minutes) I was <br/>
careful to let someone else know where all the current parts and notes were.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m getting over it.<br/>
<br/>
Susan, I&#39;m glad you and Eric will get to hang out in Las Vegas some and drive <br/>
home together instead of him coming straight home while you want to get <br/>
straight out for a while!<br/>

crying.  I was in the living room and went running to the bathroom <br/>
(thinking she had hurt herself, soap in the eyes, etc.).  It turns out <br/>
she heard gurgling noises from under the bath and she thought <br/>
it was a whale!  I had to stifle my laughter big time!  She was <br/>
really freaked out about it, until I pointed out that there was <br/>
concrete and earth underneath the bath and that a whale needs <br/>
a very large body of water to live in and that a whale is a hell of a <br/>
lot bigger than our bathroom &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
