&lt;&lt; &lt; It is clear that obstetrics has a LOT to learn about how long it takes <br/>
to <br/>
 grow a baby in the womb.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
NO kidding!!<br/>
My last baby was a home birth. I was perfectly happy not knowing my exact due <br/>
date. I pieced together some information with a friend (we&#39;d had plans during <br/>
my last period) and with the midwife, got a rough due date of Jan. 29th.<br/>
My poor mother was beside herself that I wasn&#39;t going to have ANY tests, no <br/>
ultra-sound, nothing.<br/>
With our family history, she thought I really, really needed an ultra-sound <br/>
to confirm due date. Silly. I knew it was silly. But she had cancer and was <br/>
going to be my birth coach and I didn&#39;t want her stressing out, so stupidly, <br/>
I agreed to an ultra-sound.<br/>
I really wish I&#39;d trusted myself more and not let her pressure me.<br/>
<br/>
The ultra-sound gave us a due date of Jan. 15th.<br/>
By the end of January I was getting nervous. My mother had a history of not <br/>
going into labor until babies were WAY overdue. My sister had to be <br/>
resucitated because she really should have been born sooner. The placenta was <br/>
starting to calcify and such....and she&#39;d been induced as it was. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo......here I was getting worried, wanting this baby to be born RIGHT <br/>
NOW! And here he comes, perfect and healthy on Feb. 2nd. Right when he was <br/>
ready.<br/>
The midwife said there were absolutely NO signs that he was past due.<br/>
The placenta was healthy and viable, he had no waxiness or anything.<br/>
Feet weren&#39;t overly wrinkled. He was perfect!<br/>
<br/>
Trusting ourselves and our bodies goes right along with unschooling in my <br/>
mind.:)<br/>
Listening to the so called &quot;experts&quot; over our own intuition, gets us into <br/>
trouble in every aspect of life. &#39;Course some people have zero intuition left.<br/>
