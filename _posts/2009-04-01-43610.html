<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673215683">I deleted the posts about keeping children in programs, classes and school due to money and contractual obligation so I apologize for not being able to reference them.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say that I took those posts to heart and unenrolled my daughters from their gymanastic classes.  Anna, my oldest (age 6), has been fighting me about going for a while so I figured why continue that battle.  She loves playing outside on her new scooter and climbing the tree in our front yard so she is more or less practicing the same skills she would in the class and it is free.  My other daughter, Laura (age 2 1/2), has been fighting the structure of the class since day one (she has been in it for over a year).  I thought the structure was good for her, but it obviously it wasn&#39;t since she wasn&#39;t enjoying it and fought me tooth and nail the entire class (she did enjoy the free play time at the beginning of class but that was only 10-15 minutes).  I can&#39;t believe how ignorant I was!  I can take her to the park or other places where she is free to play how she wants to, oh yeah and it is FREE!!!  Thanks to everyone for teaching me a better and happier way to live and raise my girls.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>

All the posts ever are at the yahoogroups site.  It&#39;s not worth going  <br/>
back to find a phrase to cut and quote, usually, but just in case  <br/>
people feel bad for having deleted something they want, there are  <br/>
links at the bottoms of e-mails to the archives.<br/>

We helped you see what was already there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Don&#39;t think of it as &quot;teaching&quot;--we&#39;re sharing what we&#39;ve found to work!<br/>
