<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990471228">I really like that you brought the skeptics along on your own gradual  <br/>
journey as a skeptic yourself.  All that part is nicely phrased.<br/>
<br/>
I have two points to make for your future writings and thought.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My middle child has never been to school or even attempted anything  <br/>
remotely resembling school; yet, at 7 he can read because he wanted  <br/>
to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He can read because he was developmentally able to read.  Wanting to  <br/>
read doesn&#39;t enable reading.  Many seven year olds want to read but  <br/>
aren&#39;t ready yet (especially boys).  Many four year olds would LOVE to  <br/>
read, but very few are going to figure it out at that age, with or  <br/>
without help.  The danger of having statements like that out there an  <br/>
unchallenged is that some unschooling family with a seven or eight  <br/>
year old who isn&#39;t reading might say &quot;unschooling doesn&#39;t work because  <br/>
my child wants to read and can&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other thing is more minor.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;At this point I opened up my mind to the thoughts of unschooling and  <br/>
started reading book after book about it.  I realized that I needed to  <br/>
throw away conventional thinking and open up my mind to the  <br/>
possibility that what I thought of as learning may not be the only  <br/>
path to knowledge.   My discovery took place because of pioneers:  <br/>
Holt, Gatto, Kohn, and Sandra Dodd.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gatto and Kohn don&#39;t write about unschooling.  So their books are  <br/>
linked there but they&#39;re neither about unschooling.  Not that they  <br/>
won&#39;t help people move toward it; they can.  Just as a technicality,  <br/>
though...<br/>
