<div id="ygrps-yiv-203774679"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;you can let this woman know that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>there is an eclectic group of homeschoolers in<br/>
Asheville called H.O.M.E. (Homeschooling Opens Minds<br/>
Everyday) and she can try looking for their website or<br/>
emailing my friend Sarah Scott at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:sgss@...">sgss@...</a>. <br/>
You can tell her to tell Sarah that I referred her&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This is from DiAna, who lives in Asheville (and also Pagan/Wicca?). DiAna has <br/>
two delightful youngish girls. Her address is     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:seaturtles4@...">seaturtles4@...</a><br/>
<br/>
There is also the Upstate Homeschoolers Unlimited (UHU)---they &quot;cover&quot; <br/>
Greenville-Spartanburg and everywhere around there. Asheville would probably be <br/>
close enough. <br/>
They are a REALLY fun bunch of women--again inclusive, but a lot of <br/>
unschoolers in the bunch. Priss at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Priss1000@...">Priss1000@...</a> would be your contact person <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>
