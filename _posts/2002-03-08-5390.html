<div id="ygrps-yiv-1658865130"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Hey Julie,<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would love to learn to spin.  How do you get started?  Can you use<br/>
electric clippers to shear?  I know the 4-H kids use clippers to slick shear<br/>
for livestock shows but perhaps they can&#39;t be used for wool to spin, I don&#39;t<br/>
know.You raise goats too don&#39;t you?  My dd&#39;s doe is due any day now and she<br/>
is so scared something might happen to the new mom.  Any advice, comments,<br/>
encouragement would be greatly appreciated.<br/>

Oh, electric shears would be wonderful,  but I can&#39;t afford the ones that<br/>
are tough enough to cut through sheeps wool. I&#39;m still a beginner with<br/>
spinning.. my dh made a &#39;drop spindle&#39; for me..so finally I will be able to<br/>
really practice now that I have my own wool to experiment with.  I would<br/>
love a wheel, but also not something in my budget right now. ( I just spent<br/>
a bunch at Hoeggers for a stainless milk pail and strainer!)  My goats are<br/>
due to start kidding in April!  Email me sometime and we&#39;ll &#39;talk goat&#39;!<br/>
