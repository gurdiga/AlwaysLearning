Hi Pam (and Joylyn),<br/>
<br/>
I am going to try to make it to the park.  I think I can find it, but<br/>
where might I find you guys in the park?  Is it large? I&#39;ve been to<br/>
several park days in the past in my last area, and found out after that<br/>
there were actually others, but we didn&#39;t recognize each other.  Any<br/>
help?  I&#39;ll be there with a 7 year old boy (dark hair, probably a<br/>
baseball cap) and a 13 year old girl - long medium brown hair and<br/>
glasses and probably wearing a red plaid flannel shirt (about 75% of the<br/>
time) or a long dark grey cape.  lol.  If Lexie is there, I&#39;ll be able<br/>
to find you.  I know her from South Orange County park days.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
met Joylyn, but have met her husband and daughters. Thanks!  <br/>
<br/>
