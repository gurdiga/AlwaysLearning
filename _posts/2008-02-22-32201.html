<div id="ygrps-yiv-1232770617">This is compliment to my kind moderators (or one of them, whichever  <br/>
one dealt with this.<br/>
----------------------------------------<br/>
Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] Need some good responses to my  <br/>
husband&#39;s concerns<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, can you please take me off the list or tell me how to do so?<br/>
I do not belong here.&#39;<br/>
--------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The author, who had signed it, too, would have liked to have had the  <br/>
note appear on the list.<br/>
One of the other moderators probably very kindly removed her from the  <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
I would have pointed out that every e-mail has directions (or a link)  <br/>
for unsubscribing, and that the front page of every yahoogroup has  <br/>
the e-mail address for unsubscribing.  Each person&#39;s yahoo account  <br/>
gives them other kinds of options for leaving groups.<br/>
<br/>
If someone can&#39;t figure out how to get off a yahoo list with all that  <br/>
help right in front of them, should they really be homeschooling  <br/>
their kids?<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t about &quot;belonging to.&quot;   It&#39;s likely that very many  <br/>
moms come online to find a place to belong, people to affirm their  <br/>
existence and approve of their opinions.   It&#39;s likely that most of  <br/>
them are in their 20&#39;s or have had emotional setbacks and could use  <br/>
some bolstering.   That&#39;s understandable, but it&#39;s not what this list  <br/>
is about.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can learn a TON about unschooling by reading this list and  <br/>
never writing a word.<br/>
Someone can be confused about unschooling by reading things written  <br/>
by people who don&#39;t really know what they&#39;re writing about.<br/>
That&#39;s why there are several experienced old-time unschoolers and  <br/>
several perceptive, talented newer unschoolers who are fairly quick  <br/>
to clarify if things are going offsides.   Stay on the field and stay  <br/>
within the intent of the list&#39;s existence.  Unschooling involves a  <br/>
LOT of area and is a big field, but that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s  <br/>
everything.  Spark gap for a tune-up on a &#39;59 Chevy should be  <br/>
discussed on an automotive forum.  The difference in cookies from  <br/>
using margarine instead of butter should be on a cooking forum.  How  <br/>
a mom feels about the way another mom asked her about her first  <br/>
marriage and whether she still feels she *belongs* here...   that  <br/>
needs to stay home and be dealt with in some personal, emotional way.<br/>
<br/>
This list is for helping people understand how natural learning does  <br/>
and can work in the life of a family interested in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
How do people find this list?  I&#39;m curious.  If some of you who have  <br/>
joined lately could tell me how you found it and where and why you  <br/>
joined, that would be interesting.   I figure people usually get here  <br/>
from<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
or a search for John Holt and unschooling.<br/>
I further figure those who found either of those won&#39;t be too shocked  <br/>
at what we&#39;re discussing here, and how it&#39;s being discussed.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots and lots of places to discuss unschooling. There are  <br/>
very few as useful as this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026954197">This list was recommended on another list that I am on as a straight up no nonsense list.  I read around on your site before joining though, and read the instructions / recommendations for posting (such as reading for a minimum of 2 weeks, it is about ideas, not to pat people on the back, things will get picked apart, once the ball (idea) is in play it is no longer your ball and you cannot keep jumping in and snatching the ball back - once in play it evolves and is not about you personally, etc)<br/>
<br/>
I joined as I felt we (my family) was ready for the next level so to speak.  Our son had turned 13 and I was getting the &quot;yea but what if this or that never happens jitters&quot; now and then.  Plus we had some things going on that we needed to stretch and grow along with in our approach, we needed thoughts to stimulate our thoughts.<br/>

My family recently moved and we&#39;ve been making friends in our new <br/>
area.  One of the families we met mentioned this group, and Sandra&#39;s <br/>
website.  I checked them out and since they fit in with what we&#39;d <br/>
already been doing, I joined.<br/>
<br/>
I had actually happened upon Sandra&#39;s website years previous, when <br/>
first looking into hs&#39;ing.  &#39;Unschooling&#39; (foreign to me then) seemed <br/>
an obvious fit; hadn&#39;t we been unschooling since dd&#39;s birth?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t always keep up with the conversations, having two young ones <br/>
at home, but I learn new things just by reading what I can.<br/>

little ones in the future.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-601635642">Hi All,<br/>
  I am new to the list. Let me introduce myself quickly. I am Alex Polikowsky, I am originally from Brazil and I am  mom to MD ( 5 y o) and Gigi who just turned 2.<br/>
  I found unschooling reading Jan Hunt and her site The Natural Child when MD was a baby. I found SandraDodd.com about 3 years ago.<br/>
  Then I found the Yahoo Groups and joined Always Unschooled.<br/>
  Then I joined UnschoolingBasics, Unschoolind Discussion( where I just lurk-I just stay in up in the porch as the big dogs run!), shinewithunschooling and last year I joined Live and Learn when we registered for the Conference. The Conference was wonderful and I met wonderful families. I even met Holly  (Sandra&#39;s daughter) briefly while there.  I <br/>
  I joined this list maybe one or two months ago. I don&#39;t have much time to post with my active little one and a 5 year old.<br/>
  We live in a Dairy Farm in Minnesota. I have had the honor to have the Lovejoys and the Esembles-Waynforth in our home to visit.<br/>
  I love to read and I get so much out of reading here with all the wonderful people like Sandra, Joyce, Robyn just to name a few since there are many I still don&#39;t know well.<br/>
  There is really only one unschooling family in our town ( Sandra you met Christine Hall while in Minnesota with Kelli right?). <br/>
  I crave like minded parents to talk. I still have bumps that I have to work on. This lists help me. <br/>
  I have joined other unschooling list but I left as they are not right for me or my family.<br/>
  Those list where parents still think they need to make their kids do math to learn or say limit their TV or computer time.I much rather be here than those &quot;unschooling-whatever-works-for-your-family&quot;lists. I can&#39;t stand parents calling their children lazy or punishing them.<br/>
  So I like to hang out with parents like you.<br/>

instructions / recommendations for posting (such as reading for a  <br/>
minimum of 2 weeks-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s actually for the UnschoolingDiscussion list (inherited and co- <br/>
owned by Joyce Fetteroll, Pam Sorooshian and myself).  On that one I  <br/>
try to be nice and not draw crazy-fire.  On this one, because it&#39;s my  <br/>
own list and I&#39;m not representing other listowners, I don&#39;t have to  <br/>
be so careful.   That&#39;s the distinction I see between them, anyway.<br/>
<br/>
When I have some new topic to start and I&#39;m deciding which one to  <br/>
post it to, if it&#39;s something of interest to ALL kinds of people and  <br/>
if it has to do with news or international this&#39;n&#39;that, I go to  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion.  If it&#39;s more philosophical or esoteric or  <br/>
personal, I&#39;m more likely to bring it to AlwaysLearning.  (And  <br/>
sometimes I put it on the list that&#39;s quieter, just to &quot;get some  <br/>
business,&quot; conversationally speaking.)<br/>
<br/>
But it has never hurt my feelings if people mix them up and read for  <br/>
two weeks before posting!<br/>

a dear friend, who has provided me with much guidance, so here I am.  I find<br/>
myself *very* intrigued and yet terrified as well.<br/>
<br/>
Fwiw, perhaps my first real experience with my own unschooling, was the<br/>
journey to birth my last child.  It was the first time I didn&#39;t do what I<br/>
was &quot;supposed&quot; to do because someone said so.  Wow, that&#39;s strange to write,<br/>
but true.  My friend, who referred me here (hi L), was a huge part of that<br/>
journey.  When she realized I wasn&#39;t happy with institutionalized education,<br/>
she recommended this list, and here I am.<br/>
<br/>
Doors are opening for sure, and I&#39;m observing and making choices about which<br/>
ones to enter.  The journey continues.<br/>

<time>22 Feb 2008, at  6:54pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-198130365">I&#39;ve only been on this list a month or two.  I came here through  <br/>
Sandra&#39;s website.  I spent the previous year reading everything I  <br/>
could get my hands on, researching everything I could find and  <br/>
talking to anyone I thought could help me.  And a few that couldn&#39;t  <br/>
whom I have completely annoyed!  :)<br/>
<br/>
I am a member of several different yahoo groups with different topics  <br/>
of interest.  I have to admit, at first the &quot;tone&quot; of this group  <br/>
initially surprised me.  Other list seem to be more support group  <br/>
oriented, as you have stated before Sandra, this isn&#39;t one of those!   <br/>
I couple of times I have winced at the directness of a few comments  <br/>
and let out a little verbal &quot;ouch&quot;.  But the more I thought about it,  <br/>
the more I liked it.  I am a very straightforward person and find  <br/>
myself in constant trouble for speaking my mind.  So, for me, it  <br/>
makes sense that I would be drawn to a very straightforward group.<br/>
<br/>
I like to think deep thoughts and ponder big questions.  But  <br/>
sometimes I really do need someone to just take the hammer and hit me  <br/>
between the eyes.  So even if I didn&#39;t throw out the topic &quot;ball&quot; or  <br/>
respond to it, I have been hit many times since joining just by  <br/>
lurking and want to thank all of you for your clear and excellent  <br/>
responses.<br/>
<br/>
I had also joined another unschooling yahoo group (sorry can&#39;t  <br/>
remember the name at the moment) and it had way too high a volume of  <br/>
&quot;fluffy&quot; posts for me.  I like it just fine here.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It sounds so harsh and cold to say &quot;this isn&#39;t a support group,&quot;  <br/>
because in a way it is.  But in a big way, it&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
For someone who likes to learn (which would seem to me to be a pre- <br/>
requisite condition of wanting to be an unschooler), it&#39;s a good  <br/>
list.  And for someone who wants to be an unschooler, you need to  <br/>
learn how to do it.   You probably don&#39;t need to &quot;be taught&quot; how to  <br/>
do it, but it will help if others look over your shoulder and make  <br/>
tweak-suggestions.  It  helps to have experienced people nearby  <br/>
sometimes when you&#39;re trying to learn to do something you&#39;re not sure  <br/>
about.  I always want a witness when I&#39;m going to cut expensive  <br/>
cloth--someone to run it by as I&#39;m laying out the pieces or  <br/>
diagramming the pieces I&#39;m planning to cut, someone who knows enough  <br/>
to say &quot;Wouldn&#39;t this piece be better on the bias, maybe?&quot; or &quot;Did  <br/>
you save enough for the facing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The way in which this is not a support group is that it doesn&#39;t exist  <br/>
to be supportive of whatever a  mom wants to do.  We&#39;re not here to  <br/>
applaud and cheer like families on Family Feud who cheer and say  <br/>
&quot;good answer!&quot; no matter how lame the answer is.  I&#39;m more likely,  <br/>
here, to say &quot;There are better answers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
For those who want to be applauded, it&#39;s good for the moment, but how  <br/>
does it help you when the applause dies and your problems and  <br/>
confusion remain?   Having stranger-moms say &quot;Ooooh, what a good  <br/>
*mom* you are!&quot; while your children are crying or unhappy doesn&#39;t  <br/>
even start to begin to make you a good mom.  What will make you a  <br/>
good mom is going and trying to make your children happier.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll support anyone who really wants to understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone&#39;s welcome to help with that, and no one is welcome to impede  <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
No one &quot;belongs&quot; here but it can be a nice place to visit! We all  <br/>
belong with our families.<br/>

I got here from a discussion on Unschooling Discussion, where you invited  <br/>

 <br/>
I got to Unschooling Discussion from someone who was my first exposure to  <br/>
the idea of unschooling. She was a pretty laid back person, but was very  <br/>
agitated with someone named Sandra Dodd. She would get very heated talking about  <br/>
Sandra&#39;s list and couldn&#39;t seem to let it go. So I had to come see for myself.  <br/>
:: grin :: It took some thought-process adjusting (but doesn&#39;t many aspects of <br/>
 unschooling?), but I found this a great place to grow and learn.<br/>
 <br/>
I can&#39;t thank you veterans enough for your contributions to our lives. I  <br/>
admire your patience in answering the same questions repeatedly over the years,  <br/>
putting up with the &quot;heckling&quot;, as it were, and continuing to be here for <br/>
those  of us to have you &quot;looking over our shoulders and suggesting tweaks&quot;. THANK <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-394566872">I joined the list about a week ago.  I was a member for a couple of <br/>
months in the summer of 2006 when I last considered us to be <br/>
unschoolers.  (yes, there&#39;s a story there but I&#39;ll save that for <br/>
another time)  I found this list by searching yahoo groups for the <br/>
keyword unschooling.  As we try to get back into natural learning <br/>
and living, I felt the need to immerse myself in unschooling <br/>
discussions.  I joined several groups to read for a while and get a <br/>
feel for the lists to find the ones that would be most helpful for <br/>
me.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was on unschooling lists a couple of years ago, it was the <br/>
2nd time I had tried joining the unschooling world.  I remember <br/>
thinking it was a bit easier to get into but I was still in a <br/>
defensive mode.  I didn&#39;t feel I belonged on some of the groups.  I <br/>
even argued with veteran unschoolers.  We&#39;ll leave it at that.  <br/>
*laugh*  Since that time, I&#39;ve come to understand a bit more.  I&#39;m <br/>
looking at posts now with a new understanding that I didn&#39;t have a <br/>
couple of years ago.  But I still have questions and doubts.  I like <br/>
this list.  I do find it to be very helpful in answering questions <br/>
or concerns that I have had and even ones I didn&#39;t realize I had <br/>
yet.  :)<br/>

<br/>
This is a clue, maybe, to some of the disconnect in these discussions.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t a world to join, it&#39;s a way to be with one&#39;s own  <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
As part of it is giving up the school attachments and desires and  <br/>
focus, maybe it&#39;s a little (just kinda) like AA/Alcoholics  <br/>
Anonymous.   You can quit drinking without that organization maybe,  <br/>
and you can maybe join it and get help or motivation to stop  <br/>
drinking, but you can&#39;t keep drinking and keep going to AA meetings  <br/>
just for the social life.<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a &quot;social life&quot; list.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand the benefit of immersion in discussions, but if one&#39;s  <br/>
focus is whether he/she feels welcome and accepted and supported  <br/>
instead of whether one is picking up good ideas and tools to use in  <br/>
his/her relationship with children in the home, a point is being missed.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true.  As a person still learning about unschooling, I like <br/>
being a part of lots of people unschooling, which is why I referred <br/>
to it as a world.  The subject is certainly extremely different from <br/>
the homeschooling groups I&#39;ve been in.  Right now, the internet is <br/>
the best way to do that.  I can meet a few people from my state <br/>
unschoolers list but I can hear so much more discussion from large <br/>
groups such as this one.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I do understand the benefit of immersion in discussions, but<br/>

&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes I see your point.  Again, I won&#39;t speak for others but I prefer <br/>
company, preferably experienced, when trying something new.  My kids <br/>
went sledding in the snow for the first time this year.  Although <br/>
they saw lots of people around them doing it, they were still scared <br/>
until someone explained a few things to them and then helped them <br/>
down the hill the first time.  I imagine that many of the people who <br/>
feel offended, not welcome or not accepted in a group such as this <br/>
feel scared and lonely.  Sometimes it&#39;s hard to take the first step <br/>
without a smiling face nearby to walk the walk with me.  My husband <br/>
isn&#39;t the kind of person who needs such a thing, but I usually am.  <br/>
People who need such acceptance should surely join a more social <br/>
support group.  As you said, this group is for ideas.<br/>

<br/>
The best way that learning about unschooling is NOT like school is  <br/>
that you don&#39;t have to choose one school and go there and hope you  <br/>
don&#39;t flunk out or get expelled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A person doesn&#39;t *have* to join a group, and those who like groups  <br/>
can join three or ten at the same time.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I personally like the groups.  I&#39;ve been subbed on them for years, and  <br/>
just went no mail for a looonnnnggg time and realized how badly I  <br/>
missed and needed them.  These groups in particular (Always Learning,  <br/>
Always Unschooled, Shine) really push me to change and grow as a  <br/>
parent...which is what *I* want and is the reason I love them.  They  <br/>
are not &quot;pat you on the back&quot; support groups, but they are &quot;yeah you  <br/>
screwed up and yes you can do better&quot; groups.<br/>
<br/>
If someone does not want to be pushed, then no, they should not be here.<br/>
<br/>
Just my opinion.<br/>

&gt; How do  people find this list? I&#39;m curious. If some of you who have <br/>
&gt; joined lately  could tell me how you found it and where and why you <br/>
&gt; joined, that would be  interesting. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>So...I&#39;m letting you know how I found this list...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is only 2 1/2, so I guess I&#39;m not an unschooler yet. <br/>
However, I&#39;m learning so much and so glad I found this because I&#39;m <br/>
already applying so many new principles to the way I&#39;m parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking some time about home schooling, because having a <br/>
teaching credential, and having taught some and worked with children in <br/>
many settings, as soon as I had my daughter, I realized they can&#39;t be <br/>
tuaght in school in a way that fits how children learn and develop. <br/>
Already curious about ways I&#39;d go about getting into homeschooling <br/>
groups, I Googled UU homeschoolers because I&#39;ve been going to a <br/>
Unitarian Universalist church and thought I&#39;d find some groups we&#39;d fit <br/>
into some time. I found the UUHomeschoolers group and joined. Someone <br/>
sent a link to listen to Sandra&#39;s talk on peaceful parenting, which <br/>
linked me to your site. I listened to the talk and checked out all over <br/>
the site. I&#39;d never heard of unschooling before. I guess I found the <br/>
group through your site after that. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s probably too long of an explanation, but there it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-64709691">I think I get what you are saying about unschooling starting at school age. When my son was about 3 I joined a local small homeschooling group in town. THere where 4 families that consider themselves unschoolers counting mine. All four had kids younger or around five years old. One sent the kid to school because he was not being &quot;challenged enough&quot; when he turned 7. The other is ecletic with lots of siting down to &quot;learn&quot; when the kids reached seven. They are still relaxed but far from unschoolers. The third half is in school and the other half is at home because mom is ill and they want more friends ( a different situation). We get a lot of &quot;OH so he is in kinderganden now?&quot;. I just say no we homeschool. <br/>
  So yes I see people not trusting their kids anymore when they reach a certain age and should be in school.<br/>
