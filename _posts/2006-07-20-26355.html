<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598645284">Okay, have veered from unschooling discussion and I&#39;ll take any further info<br/>
off-line, but Max says the keyboard was used by Emerson Lake and Palmer, a<br/>
similar one was used by the Beatles, and the Cream connection was something<br/>
other than this particular organ.<br/>
<br/>
Jacki, looking forward to getting back into her own element :o}<br/>

    Well, I&#39;m going to have to go back to check my who&#39;s and whats as <br/>
well since<br/>
&quot;Ray&quot; was someone the guy talked about. And my friend just told me that<br/>

<br/>
Well, saying &quot;organ&quot; with Rock & Roll is equivalent to saying Ray <br/>
Manzerak! &lt;G&gt; That&#39;s immediately where my mind jumped.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember an organ with Cream; I guess that&#39;s why I jumped so <br/>
quickly to The Doors. There were only three in Cream, but maybe there <br/>
were session players I don&#39;t know about. (Wouldn&#39;t be a first! &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>
