&gt;Someone here had an e-mail addy that had &quot;truealaskans&quot; in it.<br/>
&gt;I am way too tired to go back and find it...forgive me.<br/>
&gt;Is there someone here from AK?<br/>
&gt;Ren, a former Northerner<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That would be me! We lived in Anchorage, AK (actually Elmendorf AFB) for 8<br/>
years. We have been in Clovis, NM (Cannon AFB) for almost 4 1/2 years, and<br/>
are now getting ready to head off to Columbus, MS (Columbus AFB) next month.<br/>
We will always be Alaskans at heart! Plan to move their when my hubby<br/>
retires.<br/>

Well you people are just plain crazy!! LOL<br/>
I love Alaska too, but have no desire to live there again....except maybe in <br/>
those wonderfully strange, light-all-night summers.<br/>
Anchorage is so much prettier than Fairbanks too!! That&#39;s where I was raised. <br/>
My entire family is still up there.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We never did make it up to Fairbanks. Loved the ocean too much, so most of<br/>
our exploration trips took us along the Kenai Penninsula. My husband lived<br/>
in Fairbanks for a few years as a child though. His dad was in the air<br/>
force, also. That&#39;s why we wound up going there, dh had fond memories from<br/>
his childhood. His parents really didn&#39;t like it up there though. His dad<br/>
refused to visit us the entire time we were there and his mom didn&#39;t visit<br/>
until just before we moved. They tell me that for the first few months after<br/>
they got to Fairbanks (when my dh was child) my mil would pack a suit case<br/>
everyday, and put it by the door and tell my fil  when he got home from work<br/>
that she was ready to move anywhere but there! She said that she absolutely<br/>
hated it there.<br/>
<br/>
I never saw any place in AK that I didn&#39;t like. We were just back there for<br/>
a visit the end of September, and fell in love all over again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825647178">My husband, before he was my husband, lived in Moose Creek (between the<br/>
AFB and North Pole) for a while when he was working in Fairbanks.   He&#39;s<br/>
been to North Pole, many times.   He worked in Ft. Yukon too and came<br/>
home with the most amazing tan I&#39;ve ever seen.  <br/>
I lived in Anchorage, Wasilla and Knik, and always dreamed (still do)<br/>
about living in Homer.<br/>
