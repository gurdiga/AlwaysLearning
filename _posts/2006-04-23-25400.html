<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364428730">I&#39;ve been lurking on this list for about a year, finding it extremely<br/>
thought provoking and interesting. My thinking has grown quite a bit as a<br/>
result of it. Thanks to you all for your earnest dedication and consistent<br/>
expression of clear thought.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
An issue that I am grappling with now is how to balance the self direction<br/>
and trust of my children with the needs of our family. I see people here say<br/>
unschooling is not the same as anarchy, but I&#39;m also seeing people say avoid<br/>
punitive measures, and rely on trust building. Both of these feel correct to<br/>
me. But how, especially given the inability for a young child to respond to<br/>
reason, do you enforce even a minimal set of principles?<br/>

One doesn&#39;t &quot;enforce&quot; principles. That&#39;s reserved for rules.<br/>
<br/>
I think a young child can be reasoned with---if you use reasoning from <br/>
the *child&#39;s* point of view.<br/>
<br/>
He may not understand if you explain from your PoV! &lt;g&gt; Try looking at <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;reason, do you enforce even a minimal set of principles?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Something that helps here is for me to not own the issue as my own. If my<br/>
kids are struggling with computer/tv time, it is not *my* problem to solve.<br/>
It is my job to assist my children in figuring out what works for them.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes that means saying, &quot;Oh, I see you both want the computer at the<br/>
same time...what can we do so everyone gets what they need?&quot; And see what<br/>
the kids come up with, and throw some of my own ideas into the pot too if it<br/>
seems useful. Then everyone is invested in the resolution and can follow it<br/>
more easily. And they can do this even at 5!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also said to the child on the computer, &quot;When you are done, would you<br/>
please let Sally know?&quot;. This usually always gets agreement from the<br/>
computer child and often works for Sally too, because now the computer child<br/>
knows Sally is waiting and chooses to get off sooner. At least that is what<br/>
happens here. I&#39;ve noticed that my kids are really thoughtful of things like<br/>
that, probably because they have been treated well that way themselves. They<br/>
really want to work things out for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Another thought I had for you...is it possible for you to get another<br/>
computer so that they each have free access?<br/>

I would have thought this would be tricky with under-5&#39;s and impossible with Under 3&#39;s. C is 2 and is the centre of her universe and she has no concept that other peple have feelings or needs. They exist to serve ;-)<br/>
  Which of course, makes punishment or bad feelings redundant. Any bad feelings you get about what a 2 yo does are *your* feelings and not to be blamed on the small child!<br/>

&gt; kids are struggling with computer/tv time, it is not *my* problem  <br/>
&gt; to solve.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I always saw it as my problem in that I was the one who had decided  <br/>
to go with something less measured and traditional, so it was my  <br/>
problem to figure out creative ways to make it work.<br/>
<br/>
To dump my kids in a situation most of the adults around me couldn&#39;t  <br/>
even begin to figure out wasn&#39;t fair, so I figured out new ways to  <br/>
try, and what worked we kept.  (I know Jacki wasn&#39;t advocating hands  <br/>
off,  but I&#39;m just working from the statement above about whose  <br/>
problem it is.)<br/>
<br/>
With computers, it was that a turn lasted as long as the person  <br/>
wanted to play, and it wasn&#39;t fair to stand there and say &quot;hurry&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;aren&#39;t you done yet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What worked well about it was sometimes a turn was very short, and  <br/>
the other kid could play longer, or sometimes one who had a favorite  <br/>
TV show or a playdate or an  outing coming up would play until that  <br/>
time, and the other had the whole time after.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wasn&#39;t as computer-drawn (bwg) as Kirby and Marty, so adding  <br/>
her to the mix wasn&#39;t too bad, and I would use it early before they  <br/>
got up, and when they were outside.<br/>
<br/>
By the time Holly was seven or eight we had two computers.  I HIGHLY  <br/>
recommend that.  Now they&#39;re all teens and we have four.  Kirby  <br/>
bought his own (friends helped cobble one of used this&#39;n&#39;that).  We  <br/>
got Marty a used one from the guy who fixes mine, and a used laptop  <br/>
later on which Holly uses.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving kids to solve their own problems is a traditional mom tool I  <br/>
think is cruel, having been one of those kids whose mom waited until  <br/>
we failed to figure out how to solve our own problems and then  <br/>
started punishing.    It&#39;s better to help them.  &quot;That&#39;s your  <br/>
problem&quot; just can&#39;t be said in a nice enough way to not be cruel.<br/>

<br/>
I was going to say &quot;the problem is that you&#39;re trying to &#39;enforce&#39;  <br/>
anything!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Force.  Putting something where it didn&#39;t naturally belong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do kind of enforce principles, but not on the people, on the  <br/>
environment.  I don&#39;t let people do things to my kids that are  <br/>
against my principles, so I will in a biological/mom way, shoo the  <br/>
dangerous other creatures away or squawk at them and warn them not to  <br/>
do that in my nest, as it were.  If I want my kids to grow up  <br/>
peacefully and unmolested, I need to keep others from doing violence  <br/>
or molestation (emotional or otherwise).<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/nest">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>
<br/>
Wanting them to grow up unjudged and unmeasured, I have discouraged  <br/>
those who start in on who&#39;s above or below &quot;grade level&quot; or  <br/>
whatever.  I nip it in the bud and explain why.<br/>
<br/>
With principles I create an environment for them in which there&#39;s  <br/>
very little need for enforcement of anything.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Interesting idea. It hadn&#39;t occurred to either of us. It is &#39;fair&#39; in a true<br/>
sense, avoiding the artificial fairness that we had tried to dole out (which<br/>
may in fact have exacerbated the situation). I&#39;ll throw that suggestion out<br/>
to them. I&#39;m still a little skeptical, because ds5 doesn&#39;t seem to get<br/>
fairness yet (or maybe, because he&#39;s the littler one and has food allergies,<br/>
life seems so unfair elsewhere that he takes what he can get). <br/>
<br/>
&quot;For as long they want&quot; raises my other question. How did you manage the<br/>
rest of the flow of your lives? I assume you didn&#39;t have one adult per child<br/>
available most of the time, so how did you manage situations where you were<br/>
the shared resource (e.g. one child wanted to go to park day and see other<br/>
kids, the other wanted to sit on the computer)? We&#39;ve tried &quot;today we&#39;ll do<br/>
what ds5 wants, and tomorrow what ds7 wants&quot;, but ds5 tends to be rather<br/>
intransigent on this.<br/>
<br/>
And for that matter, what about your own needs and desires? I understand the<br/>
idea of choosing your children&#39;s trust and happiness above other<br/>
alternatives, but certainly not to the point of martyrdom. My dw, for<br/>
example, likes to get outside when the sun is shining (which is rather<br/>
precious where we live), but ds5 would rather continue being screenbound.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know if this method would be fair at my house, but we struggle<br/>
with the turn taking delemma as well as the orginal poster. What<br/>
usually happens is that ds7 will stay on one game for hours when<br/>
allowed and ds4 will be wanting a turn for a very long time. By the<br/>
time he gets his turn he has lost interest, or losses interest soon. I<br/>
think he ends up feeling overshadowed by his brother&#39;s skills at<br/>
playing the games and has less of a desire to play when it is his turn<br/>
because he ends up feeling like he just isn&#39;t good at games.(I get<br/>
this idea from the things he says to me.)I think it is a self<br/>
confidence issue he has developed that gives him less desire to play<br/>
when it is his turn. But he will never get better at the games if he<br/>
doesn&#39;t play consistently. And i don&#39;t think he understands that the<br/>
reason his brother is better is because he plays more, and is older,<br/>
therefor has been building his skills longer. Encouraging him to<br/>
practice more if he wants to get better doesn&#39;t help much when he<br/>
plays against his brother and gets beat every time. Then he gets upset<br/>
and gives up and ds7 continues to play the game. I know ds4 wants to<br/>
play, and that he wants to get good at playing, so i feel like i need<br/>
to make sure they get equal time to play. For instance, the ds4 may<br/>
play for ten minutes and then get frustrated, but he might be ready to<br/>
try again five minutes later. Well he can&#39;t if i let his brother have<br/>
a two hour turn because he walked away for five minutes. He is<br/>
continually discouraged if i don&#39;t ensure them equal time. Any<br/>
suggestions about this? One positive thing to note is that ds4 has<br/>
recently gotton interested in a game that ds7 is not into. So he has<br/>
no one to compare his skills to and plays longer and enjoys it more.<br/>
Also, i do try explaining to them that it doesn&#39;t matter who is better<br/>
and what matters is having fun. But i just don&#39;t think it is fun for<br/>
ds4 when he feels overshadowed and his self esteem is suffering.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was the orgainzer of the park days, so we always went to the park.   <br/>
That was scheduled first and other things were scheduled around it.<br/>
<br/>
When we moved to a bigger house, we started just meeting here, and  <br/>
within about a year, the kids were tired of it. So I tried to get  <br/>
someone else to take it over and move it elsewhere, but nobody else  <br/>
wanted the responsibility of keeping the list and always showing up,  <br/>
rain or shine, and so the group died out.<br/>
<br/>
It would&#39;ve died out years sooner if it hadn&#39;t been such a priority.   <br/>
My kids always knew, from La Leche League days, though, when they  <br/>
were little, that some moms help other moms by always being there and  <br/>
letting others see how their family gets along.  So they were into  <br/>
it.  They just weren&#39;t, so much, when they were all eight and older  <br/>
and did want to do other things instead of modelling for other families.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We&#39;ve tried &quot;today we&#39;ll do<br/>
what ds5 wants, and tomorrow what ds7 wants&quot;, but ds5 tends to be rather<br/>
intransigent on this.-=-<br/>
<br/>
We went by events and appointments.  If the week had a zoo trip and  <br/>
Holly had dance two days (thinking back to when they were much  <br/>
younger), and Kirby had karate, those went on the schedule to be  <br/>
worked around.  The other kids (who weren&#39;t dancing or going to  <br/>
karate) might suggest things to do during the hour of the class— <br/>
shopping, or going to a park to play, or getting ice cream or  <br/>
something.   But we discussed things in advance, and they knew which  <br/>
commitments they needed to work around.  Then when we were home they  <br/>
&quot;did whatever,&quot; not 24 hours a day.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And for that matter, what about your own needs and desires?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you need and desire to have children?<br/>
You have them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I understand the<br/>

alternatives, but certainly not to the point of martyrdom-=-<br/>
<br/>
You can be a martyr if you want to be, but it&#39;s all in your head.   <br/>
It&#39;s a very bad attitude.  You&#39;ll get a lot of support for it, if you  <br/>
want, because you&#39;ll find LOTS of other parents to whine with, who  <br/>
are negative about kids and generally cynical and pessimistic, who  <br/>
will assure you that your life is more important than your children&#39;s  <br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could see all that you do as choices, and know that if you ARE  <br/>
a partner with each of your children, their happiness will add to  <br/>
your happiness in ways you probably can&#39;t imagine.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My dw, for<br/>
example, likes to get outside when the sun is shining (which is rather<br/>

<br/>
Watch the way you phrase things.  &quot;Screenbound&quot; seems judgmental, as  <br/>
as though he&#39;s somewhat powerless.<br/>
<br/>
A child who might not want to just go outside because mom wants to go  <br/>
outside might be lured by a more interesting plan.  Kites, bubbles,  <br/>
taking the dog to a new park and throwing a new dog toy... that  <br/>
involves sunshine, but doesn&#39;t SOUND like &quot;let&#39;s go outside because  <br/>
the sun is shining.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to say things like &quot;Get your nose out of that book and go  <br/>
outside and play.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No.  At that point, if I went out and played, I was a loser and she  <br/>
was a winner.   Bad tactics.  And usually she wanted me outside just  <br/>
so she would feel like a slightly better mom, while she was sitting  <br/>
at the kitchen table drinking beer and listening to the radio.   Or  <br/>
she was working outside getting sweaty and didn&#39;t want to think  <br/>
anyone was lounging.<br/>
<br/>
Sunshine isn&#39;t inherently better than playing a game or reading.  And  <br/>
I live where the combination of near-constant sunshine and elevation  <br/>
can make people immediately or long-term sick.  We tell kids to put  <br/>
on some sunscreen, and stand in the shade.<br/>

more call *my* situation rather than problem ;o) and *the kids&#39;* current<br/>
problem with using the computer at the same time, or whatever the struggle<br/>
is in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
If I jump into the computer problem acting like that problem is mine and get<br/>
emotionally involved, then it will be harder for me to help resolve it<br/>
pleasantly with the children, and probably won&#39;t be much fun for them.<br/>
<br/>
If I see the problem as one that they are having and I want to help them<br/>
with, then I have a better chance of thinking and feeling more clearly for<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Helping children with issues without getting negatively emotionally involved<br/>
in the issues is what I am/was suggesting. Didn&#39;t say it well though :o)<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not a matter of being detached emotionally...quite the opposite<br/>
really. It&#39;s being emotionally clear and connected so that the kids can feel<br/>
what they need to feel and think what they need to think to work through the<br/>
problem with you without having to worry about the parent&#39;s upset.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, we do get upset sometimes, and we need to be honest about that<br/>
too...<br/>
<br/>
But hopefully that can be minimal...breathing and releasing helps...as well<br/>
as a good cry every now and then...<br/>

a two hour turn because he walked away for five minutes.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You said &quot;if I let&quot; and &quot;two hour turn,&quot; neither of which are part of  <br/>
the &quot;it&#39;s your turn when he&#39;s done&quot; practice.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t work in the presence of much hostility.  Parents need to be  <br/>
soothing and encouraging and have other cool things going on in other  <br/>
parts of the house or the world.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He is<br/>
continually discouraged if i don&#39;t ensure them equal time. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you want to measure hours, do it.  There are other, better ways,  <br/>
though.  If you&#39;ve pushed equal as better, it will be a problem for  <br/>
you and them too.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid there were four girls at our house within four years  <br/>
of age—my sister and two cousins.  My mom was pretty cranky and had  <br/>
grown up during the depresson and WWII, and had no ideas at all for  <br/>
making lives more peaceful or flexible.  If she got grapes or M&Ms,  <br/>
she would COUNT THEM OUT in four bowls for us, counting pointedly and  <br/>
nearly sarcastically, like &quot;here&#39;s your share.&quot;  It was hard to eat  <br/>
happily when things were so...  mean.   Measuring exact minutes is  <br/>
like counting grapes.<br/>
<br/>
-=But i just don&#39;t think it is fun for<br/>
ds4 when he feels overshadowed and his self esteem is suffering.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Computer games should be a small part of a big busy life.  Be with  <br/>
him more, doing things with him, instead of leaving him to struggle,  <br/>
maybe.<br/>

&gt; as though he&#39;s somewhat powerless.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use that term with intent. My own experience with these games is that they<br/>
are immersive, and deeply engaging. I am not powerless, but I do feel the<br/>
influence on my behavior to be great. I&#39;ve been known to be late for an<br/>
appointment or not get enough sleep because of the deep draw.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; A child who might not want to just go outside because mom wants to go <br/>
&gt; outside might be lured by a more interesting plan.  Kites, bubbles, taking<br/>
&gt; the dog to a new park and throwing a new dog toy... that involves <br/>
&gt; sunshine, but doesn&#39;t SOUND like &quot;let&#39;s go outside because the sun is <br/>
&gt; shining.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This has been our approach. But we have been unable to come up with enticing<br/>
enough things for ds5. It may have something to do with our climate (the<br/>
pacific northwest).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My mom used to say things like &quot;Get your nose out of that book and go  <br/>
&gt; outside and play.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I completely agree with this, as I was the same way (and still am). My point<br/>
was not that sunshine is good and screen time is bad. It was that my wife<br/>
likes the sunshine for herself (in fact, has been diagnosed with SAD a few<br/>
times), and would like to have the need fed. <br/>
<br/>
We certainly have embraced the fact that we chose children (I actually went<br/>
along begrudgingly in the beginning, but have since changed dramatically).<br/>
They are the center of our universe, and most decisions are made around<br/>
them. But from a balance perspective, there are times when one&#39;s other<br/>
desires call. Yours, for example, to model to other families.<br/>

From: &quot;Ken Cooper&quot; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ken@...">ken@...</a>&gt;<br/>
 I&#39;m still a little skeptical, because ds5 doesn&#39;t seem to get<br/>
&gt; fairness yet (or maybe, because he&#39;s the littler one and has food <br/>
&gt; allergies,<br/>
&gt; life seems so unfair elsewhere that he takes what he can get).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I&#39;ve wondered about that, too.  From a small child&#39;s POV, in the short run, <br/>
life does not always look fair.   Or perhaps, fair is a learned concept and <br/>
the readiness only kicks in at a certain developmental level.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it would be helpful to work in a looser time frame with the <br/>
computer games?   Take turns by &quot;morning&quot; and &quot;afternoon&quot; say, rather than <br/>
hourly with a timer?  Those games do really require immersion and deep <br/>
engagement.   There may be more natural stopping points and rhythms than a <br/>
timer.   Sometimes the kids end up coming to a stopping point on their own <br/>
if they don&#39;t feel locked into a specific time frame.<br/>
<br/>
Slower transitions can be helpful too, with natural motivators to help with <br/>
the transitions.   Like mealtimes.   My kids can accept &quot;time to come to a <br/>
stopping point&quot; with computer games, IF they&#39;ve had enough time to make a <br/>
certain amount of progress during their game time.   The time it takes to <br/>
come to a stop varies from child to child.   It also varies with the point <br/>
they are at in the game.   There is some room for leeway and I don&#39;t like to <br/>
make it too arbitrary or they start being arbitrary about it, too.<br/>
<br/>
These kinds of solutions haven&#39;t stopped all conflict here but they&#39;ve <br/>
helped cut it down and take some of the  intensity out of it.   In my <br/>
experience, sometimes when the intensity has been lessened over time, the <br/>
kids are able to take over some of the &quot;fairness&quot; principle for themselves, <br/>
in their own way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1005592059">In my limited experience (I&#39;ve only had this gig for 8 years, now) the only<br/>
way my kids seem to really learn our values are through modeling them and<br/>
talking about them on a daily basis.  It doesn&#39;t happen overnight, or in the<br/>
course of a week or even a year.<br/>
<br/>
I talk to my kids about how I was parented and that when I&#39;m angry, I feel<br/>
like hitting, too, but I have to control that part of myself because I don&#39;t<br/>
want to hurt them and I don&#39;t want them to be afraid of me.  I want us to<br/>
have a peaceful household and I want them all to feel safe, even when<br/>
there&#39;s conflict.  I ask them how we can all feel safe when there&#39;s a<br/>
disagreement and they agree that controling our anger and expressing it with<br/>
words rather than our hands is the best way for everyone to feel safe and<br/>
secure.   We also talk about other ways to resolve conflict.  We talk about<br/>
how everyone&#39;s feeling and why in order to model empathy.  We brainstorm<br/>
about possible solutions.  I tell them, in the end, that if the only thing<br/>
they can think of in the moment is to hit or hit back, they should come to<br/>
me and I&#39;ll help them figure out how to resolve the conflict without<br/>
resorting to violence.  You know, when they do come to me, sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
hard for *me* to figure out a peaceful solution that satisfies everyone.  It<br/>
often seems impossible.  I don&#39;t know why we think kids should be able to do<br/>
it in every instance, if even we expert grown-ups can&#39;t :P<br/>
<br/>
Even with all we do to avoid it, hittting still happens.  My youngest is 4,<br/>
and he still lashes out when he&#39;s angry or in retalliation.  The good news<br/>
is that it happens less and less often.  My oldest is 8 and rarely hits or<br/>
lashes out physically anymore, even when his brothers hurt him.  He has to<br/>
be in major emotional upheaval to lash out, and, thankfully, those are very<br/>
few and far between these days.  I guess I&#39;ve come to an acceptance that<br/>
they will hit each other, and I count on our example (and now, the example<br/>
of our oldest) along with lots and lots of repetition and brainstorming to<br/>
eventually show them what we value and why.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest lesson I needed to learn in parenting is that it&#39;s less<br/>
important to know what the perfect solution is and more important to *not*<br/>
do what I know *doesn&#39;t* work and *isn&#39;t* right.  If that makes any sense.<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, we have computers all over the house, but the boys inevitably<br/>
all end up in front of one computer watching what big brother is doing.<br/>

you while you&#39;re throwing.  You guys stay back and let&#39;s see if he can hit<br/>
that big rock over there.  Here, you come down here and see if you can hit<br/>
that log.&quot;  Sometimes they&#39;re not *trying* to hurt one another, they&#39;re just<br/>
having fun. Sometimes they don&#39;t even care that their brothers are throwing<br/>
rocks at them.   I show them how to have fun safely.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it helps if I think of it as genetic, evolutionary behavior.<br/>
They&#39;re like lion cubs practicing their pouncing on one another.  They&#39;re<br/>
practicing to throw spears when they grow up to hunt those mammoths.<br/>
They&#39;re practicing their throw for when that other tribe attacks.  It&#39;s my<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When I was a young teacher of 9th graders, I broke up a fight between  <br/>
two boys bigger than I was.  It was scary and dangerous, and I got my  <br/>
own adrenaline up and started yelling.  An older male teacher (who  <br/>
had been my 9th grade science teacher when I was a kid) advised me  <br/>
later.  He said when you&#39;re breaking up a fight, grab the loser.   <br/>
He&#39;ll relax, because he wants to be rescued.  The winner can stop  <br/>
without losing face and feel he would&#39;ve won if you hadn&#39;t  <br/>
intervened.  The loser saves face because he *Might* have won if you  <br/>
hadn&#39;t prevented him.   He said if you grab the winner you&#39;ll get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of kids, I always picked up the one who was in danger or  <br/>
crying, and while I was holding that one, I talked to the other one  <br/>
about stopping.  I&#39;d get that one in a safe place playing with  <br/>
something or looking at something (distracted/elsewhere) and then go  <br/>
back and deal with the dangerous stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Repeatedly counseling isn&#39;t as good as saying &quot;NO!&quot; or &quot;Stop.&quot;  If  <br/>
you rarely ever say NO, that no becomes very powerful.  If you say it  <br/>
all the time, it&#39;s quite devalued.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been helpful to me lots of times to wonder what I would do if an  <br/>
adult guest was doing whatever this thing was—waving a burning stick,  <br/>
or throwing rocks.  I&#39;d say, &quot;Hey, don&#39;t,&quot; at least.<br/>
<br/>
But fire and rocks... those are elemental in the most elemental  <br/>
sense.  And kids NEED to mess with them.  So maybe help them be more  <br/>
safe instead of trying to forbid rocks and sticks.  What CAN the kid  <br/>
throw rocks at?  Make a target or something.  Go where you can skip  <br/>
stones on water, or throw rocks off a hill where nobody&#39;s around  <br/>
(that latter one&#39;s easy in New Mexico).   Play with fire WITH them,  <br/>
so that playing with fire doesn&#39;t become something to do when  <br/>
grownups aren&#39;t around.   Then they can learn what to do when embers  <br/>
fall, on what, and how to put the stick out safely, by watching you  <br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
The side yard of our house had a BUNCH of river rock—fist-sized  <br/>
rocks.  We wanted it out, but it got boring to dig it out, pick it  <br/>
up, take it away.  At a birthday party we made a game of it.  We set  <br/>
up those white plastic buckets that paint and drywall compound come  <br/>
in now (ten gallon?  Five gallon?) and if a kid threw five rocks in  <br/>
he got a prize.  The prizes were fast-food toys and other such  <br/>
trinkets.  So &quot;party favors&quot; were earned by picking up our rocks.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  But we didn&#39;t say it that way.  And even the rocks that didn&#39;t  <br/>
make the bucket were in an easier place for gathering up.<br/>
<br/>
If a kid wants to throw rocks, go there.  Throw more rocks.  If he  <br/>
wants to play with fire, get MORE fire.  Then he&#39;ll quit when he&#39;s  <br/>
through, or when he&#39;s tired of it, instead of feeling he wants more.   <br/>
&quot;Always keep &#39;em wanting more&quot; might be good for selling circus  <br/>
tickets, but it&#39;s not so good for helping kids learn.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Instead of a &quot;time is up,&quot; do you give him warnings, or can you say  <br/>
&gt; &quot;When you get to the end of this level,&quot; so that it&#39;s a natural  <br/>
&gt; pausing place of the game?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, frequently. The natural pause even became part of our agreement, but it<br/>
was abused by ds7, who likes to build his civilization veeeeerrrrry<br/>
slooooowly. <br/>
<br/>
But I agree the natural pause is key to the solution. Perhaps in lieu of<br/>
another computer, maybe we might try out making the TV more available to ds5<br/>
(his other passion is Disney movies). This might take some pressure off the<br/>
&#39;as long as you want&#39; approach to sharing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for the input, this is great.<br/>

Maybe take some food to the one who&#39;s playing, and have a wonderfully  <br/>

&#39;advice and counsel&#39; equated with limitation, and run the other way. Perhaps<br/>
this is again historical baggage. I&#39;m motivated to keep at it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you mean to say &quot;implemented&quot; instead of &quot;enforced&quot; maybe?<br/>

I&#39;m trying to get at the sticky situations where counsel has been exhausted,<br/>
primarily because of the lack of experience on the part of ds. I spend<br/>
considerable time playing the &#39;imagine you were in X&#39;s shoes&#39; game, but it<br/>
is frequently ignored.<br/>

quite reasonable. But your point is well taken.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Abused is another harsh word.<br/>

taking long periods of time isn&#39;t doing so with malice in mind. There are<br/>
times, though...<br/>
