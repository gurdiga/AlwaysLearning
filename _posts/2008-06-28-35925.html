Wow, this really caught my eye.  Do you unschool in Italy?  Do many others?  I actually have been calling it &#39;life learning,&#39; a term inspired by the Canadian magazine with that title. But for clarity here on these lists I say unschooling. Well, anyway, I lived in Italy as a child for 3 years and have visited twice as an adult.  We are working on plans to visit again in 2009 if we can manage it!  How fun it would be to find unschooling families there!  May I ask in what part of Italy you live, or would you prefer not to mention that? I&#39;d understand.  Anyway, thanks for this little taste of that lovely language.  Cameron   <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ive only just begun...we&#39;ve had one whole year of pure life learning<br/>
for my dd5 shanti 8yo (and her little bros too, but their not<br/>
schoolage yet)... 10yo raff is wavering one day yes one day no...maybe<br/>
hell be home for good, I hope so.<br/>
<br/>
I havent met anyone else that actually does unschooling here but a few<br/>
have mentioned it on the only homeschooling yahoo group here<br/>
(scuolafamigliare is its name - it works in all languages with a<br/>
preference for italian, obviously--come and visit us!)<br/>
<br/>
we live in the &quot;langhe&quot; which is piedmont (Piemonte) and we are very<br/>
near Alba, famous for their truffle and wine fair in October as well<br/>
as Barolo, famous for their wines...:o)<br/>
be sure to let me know you are on your way to italy! maybe we can meet<br/>
up some where.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; inspired by the Canadian magazine with that title.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>okay, i will admit it, Im getting really confused!<br/>
<br/>
I didnt like the sound of &quot;giornata&quot; because it sounds like &quot;party&quot;<br/>
kind of holiday, and frankly, trying to learn nothing is beginning to<br/>
feel like work! :oP ...so I changed it to &quot;giorno&quot; which is plain old Day.<br/>
<br/>
But now my ds3 matteo (14y) is telling me that really it could also be<br/>
&quot;festa&quot; as in Mothers day (festa della mamma)...<br/>
<br/>
so Im asking sandra and everyone else, what sort of DAy are we looking<br/>
for?  <br/>
<br/>
day for mothers day<br/>
day for no smoking day<br/>
day for pioneer day...<br/>
day for antivivisection day<br/>
<br/>
let me know because Im going nuts!<br/>
<br/>
melissa who really thinks that not learning will be a really nice<br/>
antidote for all this learning Im going thru right now...<br/>

<br/>
so what are our choice choices for alternative &quot;unschool&quot; terms?<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I have a moment I will go thru and pull them all out from the <br/>
&quot;other names for &quot;unschooling&quot; thread (#35337 and up) (actually I did<br/>
start that already but the list got longer and longer)<br/>
but if someone has a  moment, and wants to do some learning (;o)<br/>
please try your hand at it...<br/>

thanks <br/>

Please don&#39;t go nuts!  I think the plainest day would be good.<br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t use &quot;unschooling&quot; if you don&#39;t want to.  Go with more the  <br/>
&quot;natural learning&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
There is some discussion on a French site about what to call it in  <br/>
French.  That might help you more than what English speakers think.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a little in English:<br/>

[In France] it&#39;s called &quot;école à la maison&quot;. But, &quot;école à la maison&quot;  <br/>
is not unschooling, it&#39;s homeschooling.<br/>
We don&#39;t really have a word for &quot;unschooling&quot;. Sometimes, they say  <br/>
&quot;apprentissage autonome&quot;, it&#39;s better than &quot;école à la maison&quot;... for  <br/>
speaking about unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149267633">Love love LOVE the Piemonte region! I got to drive through it with dh<br/>
who is French the year we met...everyone should go there once in their<br/>
lives, how lucky your kids are to be experiencing life there! and<br/>
their cheese yuuuuummmy!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding there are French and Italian unschoolers out<br/>
there, I always forget to check the groups since we are looking more<br/>
towards central America, but who knows I&#39;ve been asking dh to go and<br/>
spend some time living in France so dd will really get the full<br/>
language not just daddy and grandma.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>aw, im just joking! but it is amazing how in one language one may have<br/>
5 ways to say something each with a slight difference in meaning, and<br/>
used in particular ways, and in another there will be no choice at<br/>
all, always the same one.  Now *usually* this issue comes up from<br/>
english to italian: english has to be one of the most expressive<br/>
languages adjective and adverbial wise...in italian I am always at a<br/>
loss as how to translate certain nuances, if they are important i need<br/>
to add a whole new phrase to capture the idea (making an already wordy<br/>
language wordier!)  This is the first time I was stumped by having too<br/>
many choices in italian, and only one to choose from in english...<br/>
<br/>
must have been because we are talking about holidays, lol.  Italians<br/>
love to celebrate!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the plainest day would be good.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so keep my &quot;giorno&quot; substitution for &quot;giornata&quot;...its more<br/>
serious, keeping in line with the effort we all will have to put out,<br/>
and most likely fail at, lol.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; And don&#39;t use &quot;unschooling&quot; if you don&#39;t want to.  Go with more the  <br/>
&gt; &quot;natural learning&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so my next question is this: if I take out the term &quot;unschooling, I<br/>
need to qualify as to what it is we are doing, to be able to give the<br/>
defining term-natural learning:  in italian we cannot just write<br/>
&quot;unschoolers&quot; as they dont understand what that would mean...I must<br/>
write &quot;those who practice &lt;unschooling&gt;&quot; so if I write &quot;those who<br/>
pratice &lt;natural learning&gt; it sounds a little strange (does this make<br/>
sense at all?).  I<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking along the lines of &quot;those who practice the homeschooling<br/>
philosophy of natural learning&quot;...it sounds unwieldy in english but<br/>
actually in italian, it works.  Italians love wordy bureoucratic<br/>
language, lol.<br/>
<br/>
though this is for a page like this one about the learn nothing day.<br/>
Usually while translating I could just refer to &quot;natural learning&quot; as<br/>
the definition would be reassumed at the beginning.<br/>

(or rather, family schooling)<br/>

&gt; speaking about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yes, I like &quot;apprendimento autonomo e naturale&quot; -(autonomous natural<br/>
learning).<br/>
<br/>
I like the website, and shared it with my AP project companions...no<br/>
one has let me know yet though if they are willing to make a space for<br/>
the Learning issues (Uschooling). <br/>
The french website is very similar in scope to what I was envisioning<br/>
before running into the project some italian ap forum friends are<br/>
working on...Im hoping this will let them see how it could fit in<br/>
without them having to decide to be &quot;unschoolers&quot; or should I say,<br/>
&quot;those who practice the homeschooling philosophy of natural learning&quot;, <br/>
<br/>
really laughing hard now!<br/>
<br/>
 So I will get to translating bits of your site so they can read and<br/>
decide--oh boy am I excited!<br/>
