<div id="ygrps-yiv-741165796">Hi! I am driving from Oviedo (near Orlando), FL to visit my mom and sister in Winston-Salem, NC where I grew up. My husband is doing Army reserve training so it&#39;ll be me with our three children (7, 5, 2). We&#39;d love to meet unschoolers in the area if anyone has any gatherings planned or would like to meet at a playground, Old Salem (my mom&#39;s a tour guide; we could have some fun!), or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, if anyone is headed to central Florida, we have lots going on and I can point you in some good directions.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
Jennifer<br/>
