<div id="ygrps-yiv-883171477">Religion occasionally comes up in our local inclusive homeschooling group.<br/>
Sometimes new people will assume everyone&#39;s Christian (I&#39;ve never seen<br/>
anyone of any other religion or non-religion assumes this in the same way,<br/>
which is one difference already). Usually it&#39;s just a matter of reminding or<br/>
informing them the group is inclusive and they either stay or go away once<br/>
they have that information, but there are a few atheists and agnostics in<br/>
our group who get *really* upset about the assumptions. I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve had<br/>
enough bad experiences that it&#39;s pardonable, but it does make them look<br/>
over-reactive (to most, including the other atheists and the Christian-Lites<br/>
like me &lt;g&gt;) in context.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Maybe you could tell your atheist members you&#39;ll keep praying that<br/>
they&#39;ll learn some manners. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe.  But if those manners involved crossing themselves when driving in<br/>
front of a church in a totally Catholic town, or saying &quot;Praise Jesus&quot; or<br/>
&quot;God willing,&quot; that would be past manners to dishonesty.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the atheists at Pam&#39;s meetings are saying, but I&#39;ve been<br/>
to<br/>
some of those meetings, knowing the theme of the group was diversity, and<br/>
figured there were various religions.  I don&#39;t remember being there when<br/>
religion was discussed.  I hope it&#39;s as rare for real as it seems to me from<br/>
a handful of visits.<br/>
