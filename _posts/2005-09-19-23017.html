How dare you insinuate I should put him in schoolÂ  ! You really should get <br/>
out of the answering business if you can&#39;t be supportive. WHat kind of example <br/>
did you just set for the unschooling community ? Not a nice one.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Had I &quot;been supportive&quot; of the idea of a child stealing his mother&#39;s free <br/>
time, I would not have been supportive of unschooling, or of that child.<br/>
<br/>
Had I &quot;been supportive&quot; of the idea that helping a child not need to be with <br/>
his mom is a path to unschooling what good would that do?   <br/>
<br/>
There is not &quot;an unschooling community.&quot;   There are lists, there are <br/>
websites, there are magazines and books and conferences.   There are hundreds of <br/>
people offering free FREEE and constant assistance, and if a parent wants to buy a <br/>
curriculum, lots of people will line up to sell you something.   If one wants <br/>
to learn about unschooling it takes some effort, research, and open <br/>
willingness to change.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m unschooling really happily.   I&#39;m continue to be willing to offer ideas <br/>
and links and help for others to do it too.<br/>
<br/>
It helps for new unschoolers to look at their expectations and the words they <br/>
choose to use.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1236530110">I have been on many,many unschooling lists and I have to say that this <br/>
is by far the best I have found.I have even been denied rejoining a <br/>
group that was started for parents with super sensitive kids after <br/>
finding the need for a group for these kids at the unschooling <br/>
conference last yr.I was 1 of the 1st to join that group.I tried to <br/>
rejoin after being unsubbed for awhile (because my child was in such <br/>
depression all of my attention was on him.)when I was asked why I <br/>
wanted to join and I told them that ds had tried to commit suicide,I <br/>
needed support,Iwas denied and told that the souls on that group were <br/>
just far too sensitive to deal with that.That he needed therapy.Well <br/>
he has always been in therapy!I needed the group!<br/>
I will just stay lurking in the background unless I feel a real need <br/>
to voice my oppinion such as now and say you want find a better group <br/>
than here.</div>

Not all groups are good for all people.<br/>
No one group is good for all people.<br/>
<br/>
No one should hope to find all the information she   needs from one source <br/>
anyway.   ANY sort of learning is best done by having several sources, by <br/>
browsing the world.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-850000853">You will not find a better group of folks than these in this unschooling group.<br/>
