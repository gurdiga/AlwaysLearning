<div id="ygrps-yiv-170834489">Hi all,<br/>
  You know how you hear about ps kids quizzing homeschoolers about what they <br/>
know? My son was playing at my friend&#39;s house yesterday with her daughter and <br/>
her daughter&#39;s 2 friends. Trevor will turn 6 next month and these girls are ps <br/>
kids age 10-12. <br/>
  After we went home, Trevor said, &quot;Mom, those big girls didn&#39;t even know <br/>
that Europe is a continent! I asked them and they didn&#39;t know!&quot; He&#39;s really into <br/>
geography, maps, etc...and was apparently quizzing THEM! I just found it kinda <br/>
ironic.<br/>
