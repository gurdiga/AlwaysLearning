<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145230706">I&#39;m hoping the collective, wonderful minds here can give me ideas or perspective.  Jack (13) loves anime.  He loves tv, but anime is a passion.  I&#39;ve found anime clubs at local libraries for him and graphic novels and basically support him however I can.  Any other ideas would be nice!  But his issue is with Saturday nights (actually Sun a.m.) midnight to 6 a.m. when his favorite shows come on. It&#39;s an anime marathon. So he is up all night and sleeps til the afternoon.  He&#39;s mostly fine with this, except that he has to get up for early things here and there and we have to spend about 3-4 days waking him up by noon, then 11am then 10am....He doesn&#39;t like it (neither do I), but understands that he would be exhausted and miserable with only 2-3 hour of sleep for an early in the day activity.  <br/>
I&#39;ve suggested getting TIVO or figuring out how to record it, but he says he knows he couldn&#39;t sleep, knowing the shows were on.<br/>
I&#39;m stumped.  What we are doing now, is only okay. I&#39;m wondering if there is something I haven&#39;t thought of.<br/>
Should we get tivo  or wire our dvd player to record anyway just to have as an option?<br/>
Any other ideas?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1601554237">I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re talking about the anime on Adult Swim? Adultswim.com puts the shows online, and if I&#39;m remembering right the episodes are up before they actually air on TV. If he could have already seen them by the time they show on TV, he&#39;d probably be able to sleep better. Maybe he could have a Saturday afternoon marathon instead.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ha! My daughter has many all nighters for anime shows, too (or WoW  <br/>
raids or something else that she can only do in those wee hours). We  <br/>
don&#39;t plan anything on the days she&#39;s up all night. And if there is  <br/>
something she *really* wants to do (for instance, we had a friend of  <br/>
hers coming to stay)  she adjusts her own sleep schedule.<br/>
<br/>
Is the early in the day activity something he really *has to get up  <br/>
for* or want to do? Could it be rescheduled to another day?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>FOMS (fear of missing something &lt;g&gt;). Sometimes it&#39;s only good when  <br/>
watched *right then* for some reason. It&#39;s the anticipation factor for  <br/>
me. I want to watch the next episode of &quot;Project Runway,&quot; for  <br/>
instance, the night it comes on. It loses its appeal, somehow, if I  <br/>
can watch it on On Demand the next day.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I guess you could do that. Is TIVO a good idea for anyone else in the  <br/>
family? It would be worth it to have for everyone, then, even if Jack  <br/>
still wanted to watch during the night.<br/>
<br/>
I just asked my daughter for her thoughts. She said &quot;you could buy  <br/>
DVD&#39;s of the shows, rent them from Netflix (better than buying, she  <br/>
opined), or watch the shows online.&quot;<br/>

There are cons all over the US that focus on anime and manga, most are quite inexpensive to register for. We just went to our first one a few weeks ago, Ohayocon in Columbus, OH. Love the play on words! It&#39;s in Ohio, and Ohayo is Japanese for &quot;Good morning&quot;. It won&#39;t be our last one for sure. Evan met up with online friends from all over the country, and Seth and I enjoyed just hanging at the Con, watching folks cosplaying (costume playing) all kinds of characters, and playing in the videogame room.<br/>
<br/>
We all had a great time. I found a site that has news about anime cons:<br/>

I&#39;d get him a nice warm bath and comfy pj&#39;s and a glass of warm milk &lt;g&gt; and<br/>
lower the lights and get him settled on a couch with blankets and a pillow<br/>
and turn the sound down so it is just audible enough to be comfortable and,<br/>
most of all, make sure he knows his shows are being recorded. Mention<br/>
casually that it is fine to fall asleep whenever he feels like it because he<br/>
will be able to watch his shows as soon as he wakes up.  After that, let him<br/>
decide. If he decides to stay up and watch, he&#39;ll experience the sleepiness.<br/>
He might need to do that, to really be able to decide if it is worth it or<br/>
not. Just keep making him comfy so that he can easily just fall asleep right<br/>
there, if he feels like it. <br/>

useful :-) and will give him another option.<br/>

If he hasn&#39;t discovered them yet, there are loads of anime  <br/>
legitimately on line. Full Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, the new one  <br/>
on Adult Swim is at their site, but it&#39;s all tangled up with the  <br/>

Wikipedia. (Though sometimes the titles are a bit different.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919623515">Wow!  I knew I came to the right place!  Thanks everyone!  I know he would rather watch in his room than on the computer, but for times like last Saturday when he did an all day 4-H program 9-3:30, it might be worth it to watch ahead on the computer and I will check into tivo. I&#39;m sure it will be something we cant imagine how we lived without.  The conferences sound cool. Another avenue to explore!  Thanks for all the links too.<br/>
You guys are the best!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493331392">One of our computers is hooked up to a big screen tv... it&#39;s the monitor.<br/>
And that&#39;s how we watch things online, Netflix or any online tv venue we<br/>
want to pull up. Ours is in the living room but it could easily be in a<br/>
bedroom of course. With remote in hand and anytime we want to change shows<br/>
the keyboard and mouse are there at the ready. It rocks!<br/>
