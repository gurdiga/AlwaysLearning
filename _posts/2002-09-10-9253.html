<div id="ygrps-yiv-677529176">I have a friend who homeschools her children.  She&#39;s not an unschooler<br/>
but she did let her daughter play and have fun until a few years ago when<br/>
they decided to get a little more serious about &quot;school&quot; work.  <br/>
Her daughter is now in her junior year and having a panic attack.  She&#39;s<br/>
shy, and blaming her parents for her awkwardness in social situations.<br/>
She does play sports, but doesn&#39;t otherwise socialize with other kids. <br/>
Her parents seem to be panic stricken too, feeling like they ruined her<br/>
life and are now thinking of putting their other kids in school. <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any thoughts on alternative choices for this girl<br/>
who&#39;s feeling like life is over if she can&#39;t go to college. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2097586377">Maybe someone else here has the patience and fortitude to explain that one <br/>
person cannot make another person gregarious, extroverted or a rocket <br/>
scientist unless the other person actively pursues being such <br/>
themselves...  Ahem.  If the teen wants to work on being more extroverted, <br/>
she can get her butt out in the community and help build a Humanity house <br/>
or work at a food bank.  It&#39;s super easy to meet people that way and the <br/>
whining will end because she&#39;ll be too tired or busy.  (sorry, attitude <br/>
slipped there...)<br/>
<br/>
On the college question, the short answer would be to have your friend <br/>
either issue a diploma to the daughter and start applying to 4 year <br/>
colleges (transcripts are easy to type up), or have her concurrently enroll <br/>
in a junior college (2 year college) to get the grunt courses out of the <br/>
way then transfer into a 4 year of her choice - or if they want some <br/>
hand-holding, call Wes Beach who&#39;s helped lots of homeschool kids get into <br/>
college (at least the ones who are enrolled in his private home school and <br/>
maybe even others.)  Wes can be reached at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:beachhi@...">beachhi@...</a><br/>
<br/>
Lots and lots of colleges love homeschooled kids, from Reed to Harvard to <br/>
Podunk U. so I would really suggest you get your friend a good <br/>
Scholarship-finding book and maybe some Valium because they&#39;re going to <br/>
need it when they see what tuitions are.<br/>

Well, I&#39;ve gotta figure that this is one of those programs where<br/>
distance learning over the internet wouldn&#39;t be quite the same as the<br/>
real thing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852441047">Speaking as an introvert, you can&#39;t make us extroverts!  I have just been<br/>
reading some diaries I wrote when I was 18 and living in Peru as an exchange<br/>
student.  The recurring theme was:  Why can&#39;t people accept me like I am?  I<br/>
should be more outgoing, friendly, yada yada yada.  No one had told me it<br/>
was OK to just be myself and that being an introvert was OK!!  I enjoy being<br/>
with people and having fun, but I reach my limit after a few hours and need<br/>
to be alone.  In fact, I wrote, &quot;I really just like to be by myself to read<br/>
and think my own thoughts.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was interesting to read that while my basic personality traits are still<br/>
the same, I accept myself for who I am and I am not afraid or ashamed of<br/>
needing my quiet times to recharge.<br/>
