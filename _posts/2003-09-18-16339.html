<div id="ygrps-yiv-281894188">My daughter Donika- almost 21 now - wore any  make-up she wanted to when she <br/>
wanted to - <br/>
<br/>
She did a moderate amount when she was about eight.  That was when she wanted <br/>
her ears pierced too.<br/>
<br/>
Now she is super conservative - no make-up at all - except when she has the <br/>
dance concerts on stage for school, and she complains about the make-up then- <br/>
she has just started wearing ear rings again after not for several years.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not real thrilled about the tattoos my son Devin got a couple years ago <br/>
at age 22, but---<br/>
<br/>
Shawn (age 28) did the tongue pierce - and then the eye brow, but the eye one <br/>
seems to be over - don&#39;t think he could wear that in his theatre productions, <br/>
or while doing his competitive diving in college. <br/>
<br/>
Trevor (age 15) has one ear pierced.  Says he wants a tattoo - <br/>
