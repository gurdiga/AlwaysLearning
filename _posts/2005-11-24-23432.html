 </span></blockquote>Even if you can pronounce it, others need to be able to do so.   You could <br/>
just pronounce it in English, and let the kid know it&#39;s pronounced a bit <br/>
diffently in different accents.   <br/>
<br/>
It happens a lot in New Mexico that there&#39;s a name (first name, surname, <br/>
placename) that&#39;s pronounced a little differently if you&#39;re speaking Spanish.   <br/>
English speakers pronounce French names one way in English and one way in <br/>
French.<br/>
<br/>
Those are pretty Aelwyn/ Aylwyn/ Eylwyn and the same name elements were in <br/>
English names 800, 1000 years ago.    Still, in Elsie, Alfred, Albert, which <br/>
used to be written with an æ   (combined letter like an a and e stuck together <br/>
and written all in one motion, when done by hand, and called &quot;ash&quot;/æsc).   My <br/>
SCA name is Ælflæd (Elf-led) but those vowels would be pronounced a little <br/>
differently in whatever dialect the speaker was speaking.<br/>
<br/>
A friend&#39;s name is French, &quot;Helene,&quot; with an accent on the middle syllable, <br/>
and it can&#39;t really be pronounced in running English text very well.   Sounds <br/>
like &quot;ehLYNN&quot; but the &quot;n&quot; is pronounced differently from English and it&#39;s kind <br/>
of a tongue-stopper, and awkward.   So she&#39;s gone by &quot;Helena&quot; most of her <br/>
life.   <br/>
<br/>
My neice&#39;s name is Eugenia--not in English, but in Spanish, so kind of <br/>
&quot;youHAINeeya&quot; sort of, and she&#39;s called Gina.    Less convenient for her than if <br/>
they had called her &quot;Gina,&quot; but her dad&#39;s name is Eugenio.   He goes by Gene too, <br/>
except to elderly relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I was interviewed for a BBC article on unpronounceable names a little while <br/>
back.   I&#39;m a&#39;gin &#39;em, and the guy found an article I&#39;d written for SCA <br/>
purposes and called me.   It&#39;s a short interview.   The way   he wrote out my <br/>
different pronunciations of &quot;Sandra&quot; aren&#39;t the way I would&#39;ve transcribed them, but <br/>
maybe they&#39;ll work for Brits.   And I said &quot;the northeastern U.S.,&quot; not New <br/>
York--he extrapolated that one.   <br/>
<br/>
news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/4180664.stm<br/>
<br/>
For those who&#39;d rather read it here (sorry for long, long post)<br/>
How are you spelling that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In death, as in life, when people spoke about Robert Moog, his name sounded <br/>
like the noise a cow makes.<br/>
<br/>
For a man who did so much to broaden the range of sounds available to the <br/>
human ear - from prog rock to electronica - it might have been something of an <br/>
irony that people couldn&#39;t get his name right.<br/>
<br/>
For Moog should not have rhymed with &quot;fugue&quot;. It&#39;s pronounced &quot;Mogue&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Moog was once asked by an interviewer for the definitive word on his name. He <br/>
was quite clear: &quot;It rhymes with vogue. That is the usual German <br/>
pronunciation. My father&#39;s grandfather came from Marburg, Germany. I like the way that <br/>
pronunciation sounds better than the way the cow&#39;s &#39;moo-g&#39; sounds.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Moog was not alone in having a name people couldn&#39;t pronounce properly. <br/>
People called Håkon, Jiye, Michi, Elissa, Asa, Nara and Laszlo have each written on <br/>
the web about going through life with people not knowing how to say their <br/>
names. Some have resorted to publishing MP3 files of the correct pronunciation.<br/>
<br/>
First-hand experience<br/>
<br/>
Psychologist Dr Mallory Wober (pronounced &quot;woe-ber&quot;) has been studying <br/>
people&#39;s names for nearly 40 years, fascinated among other things by how Zipf&#39;s law <br/>
on the &quot;principle of least effort&quot; results in names being abbreviated.<br/>
<br/>
But he knows from first hand experience what&#39;s it&#39;s like for people <br/>
constantly to mis-pronounce his name.<br/>
<br/>
 The way I react to how people say my name on the whole it depends what I <br/>
want from them<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My surname is terrible,&quot; he says. &quot;It results in all sorts of creative <br/>
interpretations, though it is not all bad - if for instance junk mail comes with my <br/>
name spelt wrongly, I feel absolute licence to throw it away.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But the way I react to how people say my name on the whole it depends what I <br/>
want from them, or from the relationship. If I need some help in a shop, and <br/>
someone mispronounces my name, then I am probably going to put up with it <br/>
since I need him to spend some time to talk to me.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s never happened, and as I&#39;m 69 it&#39;s a distant chance, but if an <br/>
attractive young woman insisted on mispronouncing my name, I might well end up finding <br/>
it charming.&quot;<br/>
But, he added, if someone rang him and used the correct pronunciation, then <br/>
automatically he would know where he stood with the other person and that it <br/>
was likely to be a conversation worth having.<br/>
<br/>
Fluency<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd from Albuquerque, New Mexico, calls herself &quot;Sanndra&quot;; people <br/>
from New York call her &quot;Sarndra&quot;, people from Texas call her &quot;Sa-endra&quot;. To some <br/>
of her friends, however, she is Ælflæd (pronounced &quot;Elf-led&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Dodd is a member of the Society for Creative Anachronism, whose members take <br/>
part in medieval and Renaissance role-play. This means taking on medieval <br/>
names - another name she considered was &quot;Wulfrun&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Having an unusual name in this context is obviously not a problem for her. <br/>
&quot;Anyone who is fluent in Middle English knows how to pronounce it,&quot; she says.<br/>
<br/>
The names of some of her fellow members have actually gone beyond role-play, <br/>
she says. Some have decided they actually prefer their medieval name in real <br/>
life - one member, previously known as Robert, changed his name to Cathyn, a <br/>
name which dates from the 1200s.<br/>
<br/>
Dr Wober has done much research into the assumptions people make based solely <br/>
on names - eg Antoinette is attractive and flighty, Susan is solid and <br/>
trustworthy.<br/>
Perhaps this is why persistent mis-pronunciation can be so frustrating to <br/>
people who suffer from it, as it could imply a different set of assumptions.<br/>
<br/>
Even the tendency Dr Wober has noted for people to gravitate towards <br/>
single-syllable - and thus straightforward - names does not always avoid <br/>
misunderstanding though.<br/>
Film-maker Tom Tanner - a man blessed with a simple, easily pronounceable <br/>
name - proudly recalls the occasion he answered his phone to a person wanting to <br/>
speak to &quot;Town Planner&quot;.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338672243">I shouldn&#39;t have said I *can&#39;t*. &lt;g&gt; I come from a long line of unpronounceable names. My Mom&#39;s family is mostly Swedish, Dad&#39;s family hails from England and Belgium. My maiden name is Edds not like *Ed&#39;s* but more like *Eadz* as in eat. The Edds line splits off from the Cazier&#39;s *Cashier* and the Soetaert&#39;s *Zo-dart*. Some of my family has actually changed to Eads as a spelling. My Mom&#39;s Mom is Illdean. I-La-dean. Moly&#39;s full name is Moly-Elspeth Jaine Owens. I think its funny when I see in Baby name books that Elspeth is a Scottish name and maybe it is, but it&#39;s an old Swedish name too.(or at least it is in my Swedish family &lt;bg&gt;) I&#39;ve got a couple great, great something or others with that name. Lots of people call her Moly-Elisabeth. And when people see how we spell her name they sometimes ask &#39;Is that Molly as in Molly or something else?&#39; (I was flower bulb shopping and saw some tulips called Moly&#39;s, and I was pregnant and emotional, and they were pretty, and...) <br/>

German-born parents, so Americans would pronounce it like with a long A <br/>
sound, closer to the German &quot;Eva,&quot; and not with a long E.  In class, <br/>
however, the teacher pronounced it &quot;ah-vah,&quot; as it would be if spelled <br/>
that way in German.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t remember how that was resolved, if the teacher pronounced it <br/>
incorrectly for German, or if Ava changed the spelling while in class <br/>

I would have guessed Mogue. I&#39;m still floored when people pronounce Cameron &quot;camRON&quot;---I thought that a pretty easy one! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
When I read Kelli & Tim Traaseth&#39;s name for the first time, I heard &quot;TRAHset&quot; (German pronunciation) in my head, but every one was saying TRAYseth, so I did too. Kelli never corrected me! So I figured that was right. Low and behold....&lt;g&gt;<br/>
