<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235740607">The current New Yorker (8-3 issue) has a wonderful and very positive<br/>
short piece in The Talk of the Town about four homeschooled siblings who<br/>
appeared recently in a musical production of &quot;Snoopy&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
From the children&#39;s descriptions, they seem pretty clearly to be<br/>
unschooling. The girl who played Snoopy said he represented the best of<br/>
the homeschooled person: &quot;He teaches himself everything, and he has so<br/>
many sides, and he has time to do all the things he wants to do, and<br/>
he&#39;s not ashamed of it.&quot; The one child who tried school for a year said<br/>
he left because &quot;I found myself being mean.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This should encourage a lot of parents who are considering unschooling.<br/>
