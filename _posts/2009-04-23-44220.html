<div id="ygrps-yiv-383949953">I just wanted to post my experience of the past couple days in helping my kids pursue an interest of theirs which led to ME learning stuff I didn&#39;t think was even remotely possible a week ago.  I have 2 boys, 10 and 7, who are INTENSELY interested in all things Pokemon.  This isn&#39;t a passing fancy, but has held their interest for at least 2 years.  It started with first watching the cartoon, then getting the GBA and then the Nintendo DS (we now have the newest DSIs as well), and finding as many used and new Pokemon games for Gameboy and DS as were available, playing those games for so many hours, that you might think that was all they did for 2 years :) Pouring through the manuals, collecting sticker books and cards, and all sorts of toys, etc.  Well, this week, suddenly it was proclaimed that it was finished, that all the games had been played to the furthest extent possible and nothing more could be done (one boy had obtained Action Replay, used all the cheats, all sorts of cheats had been researched on-line, including watching countless Youtube videos on this topic, etc.).  It was announced to me by youngest boy that the only thing to be done was for us to create our own Pokemon game!  He tells me &quot;hacking Pokemon&quot; must be learned immediately.  I am not a techie by any stretch.  The thought of figuring this out, for me, was daunting, to say the least.  Frankly, I was tempted to crawl under my chair and hide.  DH is the tech guy in this family, but he is at work during the day, and kids were chomping at the bit for this information early in the a.m.  I didn&#39;t think I would be able to make it through an entire day with their intense desire unless I figured out a way to get past my comfort zone.  I was really not sure at all that I would be able to figure out any of it, and I told them going in that I would try my best, but didn&#39;t think I could make any promises as to outcome.  Well, we all sat around the computer and for about 6 hours, we researched everything we could find on hacking Pokemon.  The kids mostly watched &quot;tutorial&quot; youtubes and helped me find sites, etc.  At the start, I seriously didn&#39;t even know what hacking was, much less think it was possible.  But, we now have quite a lot of folders with things called &quot;emulations,&quot; &quot;ROMs,&quot; &quot;ISP files, &quot;ISP patches&quot; and others called &quot;Advanced Map&quot; and &quot;Advanced Text.&quot;  We spent last night playing the hacks we could find (lots seem to be in Spanish and I was informed on one youtube tutorial that if we couldn&#39;t figure out the Spanish, then we were too stupid to attempt to make hacks :) ) to get a feel for what other people had done, and tonight the guys are writing their own versions using the map and text things we got, and we have offered to help 2 of their friends get started on this so we all have something to talk about.  By the end of my night last night, my brain felt so fried, I didn&#39;t think I could ever have another thought.  Anyway, I just wanted to say, for anyone who feels overwhelmed by their kids&#39; desire for more and more technical information, if you can be a little bit calm about it, it&#39;s amazing what you can find these days that didn&#39;t even exist, say, last year.  It&#39;s just amazing.  Not too long ago, I would have guaranteed you that there was no way possible I could figure any of this stuff out.  There are so many people willing to share their information via websites, youtubes, etc., that if your kids have an interest that is way out of your comfort zone, you can probably still figure out the basic stuff, and with that, the whole thing just explodes.  With the internet, there is certainly a lot of garbage out there, but there are also people, like people on this list, who are intensely interested in passing along the things that they are passionate about, have learned, the problems that they have encountered and roads not to take, intended to inform and take the scary stuff out of learning something new.  It&#39;s really, truly, amazing.  <br/>

The random quotes generators and the random link generators were all  <br/>

<br/>
There are all sorts of tutorials on making web pages do various  <br/>
things, and there&#39;s been clip art freely available since before  <br/>
websites did much at all.<br/>
<br/>
On YouTube there are also people showing how to play various  <br/>
instruments, which is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
There are cooking shows (small and large) out there too.   There&#39;s a  <br/>
series of depression-era recipes (anyone have that link or want to  <br/>
find it?) and I think it&#39;s about the coolest thing EVER that people  <br/>
can share their knowledge, large and small.<br/>

<br/>
I LOVE Pokemon stories!  Pokemon was so huge in my daughter&#39;s life.  It<br/>
led to everything that she&#39;s into now.  She still holds a special place<br/>
in her heart for all things Pokemon.  She seems to connect with others<br/>
that were the same way, even if they aren&#39;t now still into Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
Like your kids, Pokemon was such an intense passion for my daughter.  It<br/>
led to other anime, other manga, pets, video games, fashion, Japanese<br/>
culture, horror movies, make-up, music.  Like branches of a tree, it<br/>
kept sprouting out new ideas and interests.  That one passion evolved<br/>
and changed and grew up with my daughter.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing how one seemingly small passion can evolve into something<br/>
huge and life changing that leads to everything else in the world!  I<br/>
love this about unschooling, EVERYthing counts, especially the seemingly<br/>
small things!</div>

Sandra, speaking of -- when I go to your page and select &quot;randomize me&quot; I only get &quot;Art by Bo King,&quot; so either this is something I seriously need to be aware of (I&#39;m an artist, I have considered the possibility that this is true :) ) or there is a glitch?

I agree, though easy to find out about, and certainly EASIER to apply than years ago because of the above, but not ALWAYS EASY to apply, because, at least *I* am &quot;always learning&quot; :).  It can&#39;t be spoon fed to you.  You actually have to make the effort.  But thanks for being one of the 2 or 3 people whose pages I can resonnate with, for bothering at all (because you really don&#39;t HAVE to, right?) to put all that time and effort into conveying this information, bothering to learn how to put up a web page, making it usable and useful, and for inspiring other people to do the same.  I am not sure why people are willing to share all they know with the world, given the massive time expenditure involved, but I am glad and thankful that they do :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006842154">Deacon, who&#39;s four, just discovered Pokemon about two weeks ago. It&#39;s<br/>
fun for me, as I wasn&#39;t allowed tv, computers, video games, fiction (and<br/>
many other things) as a child. We played 20 hours of the gamecube<br/>
pokemon last week, some of which I would have had a hard time figuring<br/>
out if it weren&#39;t for wonderful people who write incredibly detailed<br/>
walkthroughs online. Right now we&#39;re watching the very first pokemon<br/>
series which we got from Netflix. In the first episode pikachu gets<br/>
injured, Deacon had to go hide in the bedroom while I waited to see if<br/>
Pikachu was going to be ok! I have to admit that I&#39;m hoping this<br/>
interest hangs on for awhile, because it&#39;s fun for me. Plus I&#39;ve wanted<br/>
to learn hacking ever since I read &#39;Little brother&#39; (great teen fiction<br/>
scifi)!  Trisha<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.  True, I don&#39;t have to, though the first few years (I forget  <br/>
if the deal I had made with myself was three years or four) I was  <br/>
doing as penance for having talked my cousin, Nada, out of  <br/>
homeschooling her oldest son, Paul.  I was studying to be a teacher  <br/>
and was SURE school was IT on a stick and that school reform was  <br/>
surely about to make the garden of Eden out of the wasteland that  <br/>
school was clearly becoming.<br/>
<br/>
ooops.<br/>
<br/>
So when I started unschooling I called Nada and said &quot;I was so wrong,  <br/>
and it&#39;s easy and it&#39;s legal.  Unfortunately, by then Paul was about  <br/>
to be out of school, or was out.   She took one of his younger  <br/>
brothers out that week.   I felt HORRIBLE, and rightly so.  So I  <br/>
resolved that as penance for having prevented a family of five kids  <br/>
from having been homeschooled, I had to go out and try to save at  <br/>
least five kids from being schooled.<br/>
<br/>
Then after a while I was just having fun, and meeting other  <br/>
unschoolers I really enjoyed working with (online, in our word-work),  <br/>
and  here I still am.<br/>
<br/>
When this year started I made a resolution to do more, and I have  <br/>
been.   I figure I should make my site really solid and useful enough  <br/>
that it will be helpful after I&#39;m gone, and I should encourage others  <br/>
to help freely too.  I don&#39;t want anyone to have to pay money to learn  <br/>
to unschool, nor to feel they have to give someone money to help them  <br/>
out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-21182750">Ooooo Lauren!  Thank you.  My grandmother was a depression era cook.  I <br/>
have always wished I could have learned more from her.  Her husband was <br/>
my Grandpa Hoyle who I&#39;ve talked about before.  He could cook simple <br/>
dishes yummy and it was always fun because he was such a hoot.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I loved that video about shelling eggs, Sandra.  Now I <br/>
know.  I did that for Karl tonight, and it was perfectly easy.  Talk <br/>
about take the chore out of boiled eggs.  It&#39;s fun.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Wow, no fiction?  That really fascinates me.  I&#39;m always surprised at<br/>
the things that parents have forbidden their children to know and be<br/>
exposed to.  I lived a pretty sheltered life growing up and consequently<br/>
was pretty naive about a lot of things.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that was very helpful for finding and marrying a partner. <br/>
I think perhaps it was assumed I&#39;d find a partner through the narrow<br/>
confines of the world that my parents had created for me, but that isn&#39;t<br/>
reality.  I went to college in an inner city university with thousands<br/>
of people that were different from me.  I met one person in all that<br/>
time in college that was like me and her father was a pastor.<br/>
<br/>
I love that my children get to meet lots of people and are used to being<br/>
around people that are different than them and know different things and<br/>
think differently and live differently.  They are much less judgemental<br/>
than I am!  It&#39;s something that I&#39;ve had to work hard to not be and it<br/>
still hangs over me from my own childhood sometimes.  Chamille is often<br/>
a compass for me about these things.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit that I&#39;m hoping this<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; interest hangs on for awhile, because it&#39;s fun for me. Plus I&#39;ve<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s fun when interests hang in for a while, and you can watch them<br/>
evolve and change and grow!  It may not turn into hacking at all, it<br/>
could evolve into some other cool interest.  I love how that works, to<br/>
see kids naturally absorb all that they love and add to it and gather<br/>
new ideas and pick up from this or that and pick up new interests from<br/>
the long time ones.  It&#39;s partly why I love Pokemon stories, because<br/>
they are all different, yet they have that one thing in common.</div>
