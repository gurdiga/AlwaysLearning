<div id="ygrps-yiv-831216425">Sort of intersecting your interest - I&#39;ve been obsessed with musicals lately.  The original Camelot features Julie Andrews and it is lovely.  My favorite song is Lusty Month of May.  This is a clip from the movie (which I haven&#39;t seen yet).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404678988">The Dark is Rising series of books by Susan Cooper makes many references to<br/>
Camelot (and even some visits!).<br/>
Wonderful books for children OR adults.   Since at least 2 received Newbery<br/>
recognition they should be readily available from the library if you wanted<br/>
to sample before buying.<br/>
Even though the title The Dark is Rising is #2 in the series, I recommend<br/>
starting with it and then going back to #1 Over Sea, Under Stone and then<br/>
doing the rest in order.<br/>
<br/>
I think that Marion Zimmer Bradley&#39;s  Mists of Avalon is Camelot based<br/>
although I have not read it.  I prefer her Darkover series.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535292316">The Once and Future King is fun, especially the early part when  <br/>
Arthur&#39;s a little boy.<br/>
<br/>
If you can find a copy with some of the classic illustrations, like  <br/>
The Romance of King Arthur with illustrations by Arthur Rackham, that  <br/>
might be good.<br/>
<br/>
Look at library copies before you buy one, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Or you could poke around Amazon or google images to see what grabs you:<br/>

the early days of the printing press and a search for the author and<br/>
complete text of an early King Arthur book. It&#39;s well worth reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-28719719">Mists of Avalon is a great suggestion.  It&#39;s been a while since I read  <br/>
it, but I remember it as being told mostly from the point of view of  <br/>
Arthur&#39;s older half-sister, who is portrayed as an evil sorceress in  <br/>
some of the more popular renditions of the story.  Not here.  It was  <br/>
made into a TV movie/miniseries, but I don&#39;t think it did justice to  <br/>
the book.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s definitely a different look at the Camelot story.<br/>
