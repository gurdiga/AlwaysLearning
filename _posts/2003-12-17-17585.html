<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  While at a friend&#39;s house, her 8 year old got out a loaded rifle and told my 4 year<br/>
old she&#39;d show her how to shoot birds.  Around here that&#39;s not out of the ordinary, but<br/>
it&#39;s not okay with me.  Sorry if that makes me small and controlling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t limit the stuff in my examples but I do not tell other parents how to parent<br/>
either, and I respect their wishes.  Apparently we differ in this.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They really happened.<br/>
&gt; The example the first poster gave was a true story, but you&#39;re defending a<br/>
&gt; hypothetical.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Um, no.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wouldn&#39;t be happy if someone let one of my kids drive a truck on mountain<br/>
&gt; roads, but how likely is that?   And if I had left my child with my dad...my dad would<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; said &quot;Okay,&quot; and he would have sat with him and let him hold an unloaded gun,<br/>
&gt; and it would have been safe and a good learning experience for my child....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My aunt was killed with the gun she owned for her own protection.  In the next town over<br/>
from us, a 4 y/o was killed last summer because she found a gun at her grandfather&#39;s<br/>
house.  Your late father sounds like a sensible man with guns, but I was not talking about<br/>
him.  Please do not lecture me on my small-mindedness with regards to decisions I make<br/>
about my small children and their safety.<br/>
<br/>
Parents very rarely agree on everything when it comes to rearing children.  I try to be<br/>
respectful of the differences between myself and other parents and still be supportive of<br/>
them.  Just because someone&#39;s values are not my own does not make them insignificant or<br/>
stupid.<br/>
<br/>
When I was a vegetarian, I did not keep my children from meat.  You seem to be assuming a<br/>
lot of things about me just because I stood up for this mother.  I try to see other<br/>
perspectives besides my own and honor them.  This apparently is not the forum for that and<br/>
I won&#39;t do it again.<br/>

Holly and I talked about this this afternoon.  She has a friend whose <br/>
religion keeps her from celebrating most holidays, and she doesn&#39;t want to even HEAR <br/>
about Harry Potter.  So Holly is just careful to find other things to talk <br/>
about when her friend is here.  It&#39;s not a big idea.  The girl has stayed here <br/>
overnight several times, and so have her brothers sometimes.  At their house <br/>
(Holly has stayed there too) they have Bible readings at night.  They have <br/>
prayers.  They pray before meals, always, even here or at fast food restaurants.   I <br/>
don&#39;t ask them to change anything because Holly will be there, and though I <br/>
know they do Bible readings, I don&#39;t do Bible readings when they&#39;re here.  I <br/>
don&#39;t lead prayers at meals when they&#39;re here.   If the parents asked me to, <br/>
that would be an imposition on MY family&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Holly won&#39;t watch Harry Potter while they&#39;re here, and she won&#39;t talk about <br/>
Harry Potter cards or books.  Not because her parents told Holly not to, but <br/>
because Holly is courteous.<br/>
<br/>
So I think the question is where one family&#39;s rights end and another family&#39;s <br/>
rights start.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Please do not lecture me on my small-mindedness with regards to decisions <br/>
I make<br/>
about my small children and their safety.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re very small, I expect that you might loosen up as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Parents very rarely agree on everything when it comes to rearing children.  <br/>
I try to be<br/>
respectful of the differences between myself and other parents and still be <br/>
supportive of them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Supportive&quot; in what way?<br/>
<br/>
Are you support my children from meat.  You seem to be assuming a<br/>
lot of things about me just because I stood up for this mother. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I was talking about any vegetarians.  I used to be vegetarian, but it was <br/>
before I had kids.  We have vegetarian and vegan friends we deal with <br/>
regularly.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I try to see other<br/>
perspectives besides my own and honor them. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you honor everything equally, the &quot;honor&quot; has no value.<br/>

I think I wrote &quot;are you supportive of my TV beliefs?  Did you read them?&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; Holly and I talked about this this afternoon.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Another story she told was about visiting a home (family A) where another <br/>
regular-visiting family (B) was present and their son is almost always grounded.  <br/>
  This day, the B parents were going to leave him with the family and the <br/>
parents were going to go and do something.  The A mom made a comment about it <br/>
being nice that the boy wasn&#39;t grounded for a change (or some such, lightly, as <br/>
Holly quoted it).  The mom said actually he WAS grounded, and couldn&#39;t play <br/>
video games or watch TV.   So Mom A said they were all going to the science <br/>
museum (family A was doing volunteer work) and there was no TV or video there.   <br/>
[Imax theatre, various videos around the museum, she didn&#39;t think of.)<br/>
<br/>
While the parents were still chit-chatting instead of leaving, boy-at-home A <br/>
turned on a video game to play while the adults were preventing family A from <br/>
leaving to the museum.   Boy B was in the room and saw the video game in <br/>
progress.  Parents saw him, got angry, and he said &quot;I wasn&#39;t playing it, I was <br/>
watching boy-A play it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly said a thing that made me laugh so hard she had to save the story a <br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;His parents looked at each other the way parents do when they want to make <br/>
up a new rule.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So they said that he wasn&#39;t going to get to go to the museum after all, he <br/>
had to go with them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t respect that.  A boy who is perpetually grounded is proof that the <br/>
parents&#39; methods are not working.<br/>
<br/>
I have never grounded any of my children, and they are very responsible about <br/>
letting me know where they are, who they&#39;re with, and when they&#39;ll be back.  <br/>
It&#39;s not fear, it&#39;s just returning the courtesy and respect they&#39;ve received <br/>
all their lives.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby just returned from a meeting he had at work.  There are four <br/>
guest-teens upstairs, talking about the arrival of a fifth.  They&#39;re going to see a <br/>
midnight Lord of the Rings showing.  They won&#39;t be back until after 4:00.  Kirby <br/>
has to be at work at 10:30 in the morning.  He&#39;ll make it.  He taught karate <br/>
earlier this afternoon, and then attended a karate class of his own.    Never <br/>
been grounded.  Doesn&#39;t have a bedtime.  Can watch all the TV and play all the <br/>
video games he wants.  Yet today he hasn&#39;t touched any.  And he probably won&#39;t <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>

This is so true in our family as well.  And I used to be very controlling<br/>
about many, many things.  The TV had to be turned off at 9am and not turned<br/>
back on until 5pm (what made those hours magical I don&#39;t know).  The kids<br/>
would sit glued to it when it was on.<br/>
<br/>
For about 3 years now, there have been no restrictions.  With 5 kids, the TV<br/>
is usually on but most times nobody is even in the room with it.  We have<br/>
several TVs, computer games, gameboys, PS2.....yesterday, the kids spent<br/>
most of the day sharing their Yu-Gi-Oh cards with the little kids and<br/>
helping them learn to play.  Go figure.<br/>
