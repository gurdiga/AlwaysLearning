<div id="ygrps-yiv-553328802"> I am in the process of reading this book. What an eye opener! I have learned so much from this book. The chapter titled &quot;Schooling: The Hidden Agenda&quot; by Daniel Quinn gave me such an awaking experience. It really made me think, look back on my son&#39;s learning as a small child, how we&#39;ve done things the past few years, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit 6 months ago I didn&#39;t know a thing about unschooling (I still am learning but know much more). I also must admit I assumed a lot...mostly things that fell under a negative light. Unschooling was nothing I thought it was. I was wrong to assume. Knowledge is power. I am now becoming knowledgeable. I realized that my son actually unschooled all his earlier life, up until 5 years and 1 week old, when he got on that bus for his first day of public school kindergarten (I lived in an area where homeschooling was not talked about and didn&#39;t even know there was such a thing - I wish I had). Actually he still carried on with an unschooling lifestyle outside of school. He carried on an unschooling lifestyle outside of our lessons we did when I started homeschooling him. Our lessons got less in the way then public school education did, but I have learned that he learns and grows much more through the unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
 <br/>
I was public schooled myself, so homeschooling in a way that was not school-at-home was something to get used to. Unschooling I feel will be even harder for me to get used to. I will just need to take a couple breaths in those hard moments and remind myself of all the things he taught himself (to sit-up, crawl, walk, read, use the potty, talk, etc, etc). For example right now he has a stack of books about South America he is reading. He also asked if I would buy him the evan-mor workbook on South America, and is doing lots of research on-line (he would like to learn more about each continent). I know what my boy was like before public school. I felt that pure enjoyment to soak up everything and anything was just not able to happen. It was much improved once homeschooling. I can see that in fact that joy can actually remain throughout life. He knows what he wants, along with God&#39;s help.  <br/>

practical suggestions.<br/>

equator, religions, languages?<br/>

He is doing so much more then a workbook, books, and research. He is taking *tours* of each area, finding recipes to make, etc, etc. I just didn&#39;t type it all. I didn&#39;t want to end up with an email that was a length of a story. ;-) Once my son gets going there is no stopping him, just like all children if they were given space to explore...as all of you quite well know.<br/>

The problem, though, was that you left it the length of a school-unit- <br/>
study.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s touring each area... you don&#39;t mean REAL touring, right?   <br/>
Because if you can afford to go to every continent, don&#39;t worry about  <br/>
finding recipes or workbooks at all.<br/>

And Holly&#39;s been to the UK twice, once with me and once without.  The  <br/>
&quot;without&quot; time, she also went to France, but many of the photos that  <br/>
used to be online have disappeared and we haven&#39;t located the disk to  <br/>
replace them all.  Someday...<br/>

My boys didn&#39;t go; Holly&#39;s good friend was living there, though, so it  <br/>
was a Holly deal.<br/>
<br/>
Even if you can&#39;t get your son to an exotic foreign land, there are  <br/>
places within a day&#39;s journey of you (within an hour&#39;s, maybe) he  <br/>
hasn&#39;t seen but that tourists DO go see.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget to see the beautiful and historical sites in your own  <br/>
region!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Some people will remember me celebrating Rosie&#39;s immersion in two TV <br/>
shows - Roseanne and The Cosby Show - when she was 10 or 11 years old.<br/>
<br/>
It was so great - she watched and watched and watched - for maybe a <br/>
year....lots of the same episodes over and over. And then she began to <br/>
talk about them and what she&#39;d been watching, very very carefully, was <br/>
how the parents treated the children, mostly, plus how the families <br/>
interacted with each other. Her conclusion was that Bill Cosby was <br/>
pretty heartless - that he pretended to love his kids, but never <br/>
hesitated to shame them or belittle them and NEVER asked what they <br/>
thought - always assumed he knew what was best for them, was pretty <br/>
controlling and sometimes mean. Roseanne and Dan, on the other hand, <br/>
were also sarcastic and funny, often at their kids&#39; expense, they talked <br/>
things out, they apologized, they changed their minds when they&#39;d <br/>
overreacted, they really listened hard to what the kids had to say, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We supported this interest EVEN before she started talking about it - <br/>
bought Roseanne and the Cosby Show on DVD so she could watch as much as <br/>
she wanted. Took her to see Bill Cosby, live, when he was on tour. The <br/>
whole experience gave us confidence that when the kids have interests <br/>
that we do NOT understand, there is really  likely something purposeful, <br/>
something imortant they are learning, even if we&#39;re not hearing about it.<br/>

why her &quot;Jenny C&quot; is not appearing on her posts.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1360118482">Michelle (14) is a skilled clay animal/Pokemon/WoW character model  <br/>
maker, a voracious reader of fiction and manga, keen watcher of anime,  <br/>
a fanfic writer (and like Chamille, she is good at spelling, grammar  <br/>
and punctuation, plus she likes wordplay including puns), a fast  <br/>
typist, an enthusiastic gamer (online and handheld) and a pretty good  <br/>
singer. She likes to help me identify birds that come to our feeder,  <br/>
is protective of the family of raccoons that live in our neighborhood  <br/>
(especially now that our backyard neighbor wants to cut down their  <br/>
favorite tree), and loves to go for a drive, just to look at the  <br/>
landscape. She&#39;s keen on learning archery this year.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot; fan, not to mention  <br/>
&quot;Mythbusters&quot; and &quot;Animal Cops.&quot;  She has one Level 80 (level cap),  <br/>
one level 77, one level 60 and a multitude of lower level characters  <br/>
in World of Warcraft. Her favorite is a hunter and she&#39;s very attached  <br/>
to her pets in the game. She and I made a costume for Blizzcon (the  <br/>
Blizzard gaming convention) last year, then buffed it up a bit for  <br/>
this year so she could enter the official costume contest. You can see  <br/>
her on stage at around the 6:17 mark in this YouTube video:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UDMYMd5izE">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UDMYMd5izE</a><br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s acquiring patience &lt;g&gt;, having been painted and costumed for  <br/>
about an hour, then standing around for 2 1/2 hours before she even  <br/>
made it to the stage.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle is a loyal friend, a gracious guest, a creative thinker; she  <br/>
has a keen sense of justice and a terrific sense of humor.<br/>
<br/>
I guess a couple of those would be considered &quot;scholastic&quot; but most  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I think it great, and all, that some of our children are excelling<br/>
&gt; at learning these scholastics young as they are, but I would like to  <br/>
&gt; ask<br/>
&gt; the group if we should only celebrate &quot;excelling&quot; in scholastics  <br/>
&gt; versus<br/>
&gt; the celebrating of &quot;excelling&quot; in other things they are engrossed by,<br/>
&gt; such as: mastering a video game, knowing every word of a favorite tv<br/>
&gt; show, being able to cook, teaching them self how to build a bike or<br/>
&gt; skateboard ramp, etc etc.. ?<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Chamille hasn&#39;t really excelled in anything &quot;scholastic&quot;.  She&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; good at making clothing, doing hair and make-up, giving advice, making<br/>
&gt; myspaces, photography, and many other things, but none of them things<br/>
&gt; that she would&#39;ve learned in school.  She is really good at spelling  <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; grammar though!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Scholastic is anything of or having to do with school, same root word.<br/>
&gt; So, in a sense UNschooling is the opposite of scholastic.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Howard Gardner has written about multiple intelligences and that  <br/>
&gt; makes a<br/>
&gt; lot of sense to me.  Some of those things are highly valued in the<br/>
&gt; school setting, but most of them aren&#39;t.  Sandra has a page on her  <br/>
&gt; site<br/>
&gt; about it... <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences/">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences/</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-566231263">Pam, I want to say THANK YOU! This post has really encouraged me. My two older boys (12 & 15) have been deeply immersed in the &quot;Friends&quot; sitcom for some time.  They&#39;ve watched and rewatched episode after episode after episode.  Sometimes I&#39;ve been fine with this, and sometimes I&#39;ve struggled.  I&#39;ve found it difficult to &quot;delight&quot; in it, though.  I&#39;ve found it hard to see much value in it, to be honest.  Your post has encouraged me to delight in THIS moment, but also to have faith and hope that something else may come out of it later.  I guess, really, even if its just pure enjoyment, that ain&#39;t a bad thing!<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I have noticed is that my 12yo seems to be very aware of various actors (and occasionally producers). He notices if an actor from one show or movie is in another one, and has enjoyed looking their info up on sites like IMDB to see what else they&#39;ve been in.  This has then led to him watching some of their other movies.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Friends&quot; is the definite main focus in terms of TV though.  Comedy, really, I&#39;d say, because he (the 12yo) also enjoys various other comedy shows. Perhaps it is an antidote to the depression he seems to sit in a lot of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks again for the encouragement to delight in their interests even if I can&#39;t see much of substance in them.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Some people will remember me celebrating Rosie&#39;s immersion in two TV <br/>
&gt; shows - Roseanne and The Cosby Show - when she was 10 or 11 years old.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was so great - she watched and watched and watched - for maybe a <br/>
&gt; year....lots of the same episodes over and over. And then she began to <br/>
&gt; talk about them <br/>
<br/>
&gt; We supported this interest EVEN before she started talking about it - <br/>
&gt; bought Roseanne and the Cosby Show on DVD so she could watch as much as <br/>
&gt; she wanted. Took her to see Bill Cosby, live, when he was on tour. The <br/>
&gt; whole experience gave us confidence that when the kids have interests <br/>
&gt; that we do NOT understand, there is really  likely something purposeful, <br/>
&gt; something imortant they are learning, even if we&#39;re not hearing about it.<br/>

It might be a love of language, and a curiosity about relationships,  <br/>
