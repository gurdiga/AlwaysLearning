<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219640350">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I have a friend who believes we all came from<br/>
outer space, some distant planet, as prisoners to<br/>
colonize planet Earth.  Essentially we are a<br/>
penal colony.  It might could explain a lot.  There<br/>
should be a church for this, I like this one.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know there&#39;s a church/commune(?) in Australia that<br/>
is something like this. They are building a landing<br/>
pad for the &#39;mothership&#39;, although when it is<br/>
arriving, I don&#39;t know &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Can the &quot;force&quot; be used for personal gain?  Or<br/>
revenge and retribution? I know people who think<br/>
prayer can.  How does one call upon the force? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I personally believe that the Universe will provide<br/>
what I &#39;need&#39; (not necessarily want). But I believe<br/>
that it will not aid in revenge or retribution. I<br/>
believe that people make their own choices, and the<br/>
Universe can either help, hinder or ignore depending<br/>
on the situation. As for calling upon the &#39;force&#39;...I<br/>
just ask in a respectful way (and include the phrase,<br/>
&quot;If it be the best thing for me&quot;).<br/>

the ceiling fan...&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
