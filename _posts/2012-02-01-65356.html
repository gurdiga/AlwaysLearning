<div id="ygrps-yiv-1335240569">My 3 year old is doing a few things that I need help figuring how solutions for.  <br/>
<br/>
I let her and my 6 year old get pretty much anything they want to eat that they are capable of getting themselves.  Things like fruit, raisins, peanuts, chocolate chips.  I want them to keep it in the kitchen though, at the table or counter, because my 1 year old or the dog will get into it if it&#39;s lower down in another room.  She keeps taking chocolate chips into her bedroom, and I find them later on the floor, melted on the furniture or in the baby&#39;s hands.    <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve shown her the mess it makes, I&#39;ve told her that if the dog gets chocolate she could get sick, and that the baby makes a mess with it.  She keeps doing it.  I like to keep the chocolate chips in the freezer, but for now I have them on a high shelf where she can&#39;t reach them.  I told her if she wants some to just let me know and I will sit in the kitchen with her, but she no longer has free access to them.  I also told her that as soon as we get a baby gate for their room (the door is broken) so the baby and dog can&#39;t get in, that I will let her do some picnics in the bedroom.  <br/>
<br/>
It will be a few weeks until I can afford the gate and I&#39;m having a hard time finding one that will fit such a narrow door.  In the meantime, I need some other ideas, because she will probably figure out how to get the chocolate chips down from the shelf they are on and/or take other foods in there.    <br/>
<br/>
The other thing she is doing is taking things out of her sister&#39;s special box.  Both girls have a box to keep things in that belong only to that girl, not to both of them.  For a long time this was working really well and they both respected the other one&#39;s space and things.  Lately, she keeps taking things out of my 6 year old&#39;s box and putting them in hers or hiding them or using them without permission.  This is really frustrating to my 6 year old.  The things she keeps taking are things that my 6 year old bought with her own money and my 3 year old could buy the same things with her money.  She chooses not to, but then takes her sisters stuff, so I don&#39;t understand that.  Any ideas?<br/>

<br/>
Why?  If eating in the bedroom is a bad idea, and if she somehow enjoys doing what you don&#39;t want her to do, why wouldn&#39;t she hide chocolate chips all over the place?  The gate isn&#39;t magic.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s three.  She&#39;s too young to be expected to make far-reaching decisions about how to spend money.  She probably has very little idea what money is.  Don&#39;t have a secret stash for the six year old&#39;s special food.  Don&#39;t HAVE special food.  It&#39;s clearly causing a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Have the older girl spend her money on non-food things, and YOU buy the foods she&#39;s wanting, and buy enough for both of them.<br/>
<br/>
The younger girl is hiding because you have rules.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve described all the explanations you&#39;ve made that are too much detail for a three year old.  They were too much detail for me.<br/>
<br/>
A few chocolate chips won&#39;t hurt your dog or your baby, though, will they?  If so, don&#39;t get chocolate chips for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-361103037">Hi there! This is my first time responding or posting though I hope to have some helpful ideas from my own experience. My kids, two boys 7, 4, and my girl 2. We also have a dog and two cats in our home.  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I let her and my 6 year old get pretty much anything they want to eat <br/>
that they are capable of getting themselves.  Things like fruit, <br/>
raisins, peanuts, chocolate chips.  I want them to keep it in the <br/>
kitchen though, at the table or counter, because my 1 year old or the <br/>
dog will get into it if it&#39;s lower down in another room.  She keeps <br/>
taking chocolate chips into her bedroom, and I find them later on the <br/>
floor, melted on the furniture or in the baby&#39;s hands.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is helpful and empowering for them and you when they have snacks in reach.  Setting the limits to the kitchen which I have done in my not so cool traditional mindset past days in my home created more stress for all involved.  Not everyone wants a snack at the same time and the others or one may be enjoying something different like tv, games, or toys elsewhere which looks appealing and easily to wander.  The toddler years here have been about wander. My idea was to make snacks and a little table accessible where the action may be.  I had a pup to train at the time too so I stayed present ate with them and cleaned up as I saw they weren&#39;t interested anymore.  Now the dog is trained and I can walk around about the room or still stay seated and they may even help in their own way clean up. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve shown her the mess it makes, I&#39;ve told her that if the dog gets <br/>
chocolate she could get sick, and that the baby makes a mess with it.  <br/>
She keeps doing it.  I like to keep the chocolate chips in the freezer, <br/>
but for now I have them on a high shelf where she can&#39;t reach them.  I <br/>
told her if she wants some to just let me know and I will sit in the <br/>
kitchen with her, but she no longer has free access to them.  I also <br/>
told her that as soon as we get a baby gate for their room (the door is <br/>
broken) so the baby and dog can&#39;t get in, that I will let her do some <br/>
picnics in the bedroom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Toddlers or even most young children I have observed don&#39;t see messes as how we may see them.  If the concern is centered around keeping it clean then maybe have some rags, wipes, and a spray bottle of your cleaning preference handy.  Hopefully something safe enough for the kids to help if they felt the urge. My 2 year old girl loves her spray bottle and rags.  She gets the down low places. <br/>
Anyways, I think you may be wasting your energy on a baby gate and it could possibly add more conflict being a restraint in this sense and not necessarily related to safety. This could make the youngest babes and dog feel restrained adding angst to them and those around.  Also, giving some sense of power to the oldest over the younger which may not be the healthy kind.  Maybe ask for her help to insure keeping the little pieces of food off the floor instead.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The other thing she is doing is taking things out of her sister&#39;s <br/>
special box.  Both girls have a box to keep things in that belong only <br/>
to that girl, not to both of them.  For a long time this was working <br/>
really well and they both respected the other one&#39;s space and things.  <br/>
Lately, she keeps taking things out of my 6 year old&#39;s box and putting <br/>
them in hers or hiding them or using them without permission.  This is <br/>
really frustrating to my 6 year old.  The things she keeps taking are <br/>
things that my 6 year old bought with her own money and my 3 year old <br/>
could buy the same things with her money.  She chooses not to, but then <br/>
takes her sisters stuff, so I don&#39;t understand that.  Any ideas?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sandra addressed this well of course but I&#39;ll add and agree the 3 year old may know money but not grasp how much or why or mine haven&#39;t.  My oldest has had his own stash of cash since he was 5 because he asked about money and wanted to know how to get it.  He keeps his birthday money and he&#39;ll do different things around the house he enjoys to earn some extra.  He spends it and the younger have helped pick things out with him.  I get them something small if they want to or we have enough family money to do it.  The younger have not asked about extra personal cash yet but when they see older brother having his out and wanted it I have a change jar or a few dollars to sit with them to experience playing.  We&#39;ve fortunately kept a good understanding and principle about personal property so far at each of their growth and development.  When they are so young things do get broken, they will get upset, but if talked about and expressed time will pass<br/>
 more things are bought and people grow to not break everything in site. :-) or make food messes as they do like to melt chocolate &#39;chippies&#39; in their little precious baby hands.<br/>
I hope all this has been helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Wow! my first post nerve racking and their is probably five or more ahead now that I&#39;ve scanned it oh a dozen or more times for typos and such. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207964044">A couple of practical suggestions to take or leave...<br/>
<br/>
**She keeps taking chocolate chips into her bedroom, and I find them later on the floor, melted on the furniture or in the baby&#39;s hands.**<br/>
<br/>
Switch the chocolate chips for other yummy treats that aren&#39;t quite as messy.  Gummy bears, small chocolate cookies, even smarties won&#39;t melt all over everything the same way.  My 2 year old&#39;s favorite treat is smarties.  We don&#39;t limit her to kitchen and, although we step on one here or there, don&#39;t have a mess problem.<br/>
<br/>
**Lately, she keeps taking things out of my 6 year old&#39;s box and putting them in hers or hiding them or using them without permission.**<br/>
<br/>
Try buying the same items for your younger one.  Then she&#39;ll have no need to want, take and try to keep her sister&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
Mairi.<br/>

<br/>
I think that helping your older daughter find a place for her box that the younger sister cannot get at would be extremely helpful. Help her keep her things safe; don&#39;t expect a three year old to act like anything other than a three year old.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s in the box that she spent her own money on? Get more of that, with your own money, for both girls.<br/>

Because I wouldn&#39;t mind them eating not-messy things in the bedroom occasionally with permission with the baby gate up to keep the dog and baby out.  I wanted her to know that I was working on a solution that would allow her to have food in the bedroom.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141839979">One thing I did to make room eating easier to handle was that all food in Xan&#39;s room was eaten at a kid sized table. He could still play and do what he wanted but all food sat on the table. I don&#39;t know if your daughter would be keen about this idea but it might solve the food everywhere issue. Her bowl of chocolate could be sitting there for her whenever she wants a little. No need to hide or sneak. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585141050">We have an issue in our house with the 3 year old touching and/or taking the 6 year old&#39;s things, causing the 6 year old to melt down completely, so our solution was essentially what Pam was suggesting - we put an exterior door lock on the bedroom closet and gave the 6 year old the key so that she could put anything special to her that she did not want touched in there.  It&#39;s not completely working yet as the 6 year old now sees this as a perfect clubhouse and so does not want to clutter it with &quot;things&quot; because then there wouldn&#39;t be any room for her to sit in there too, but, like everything else, it is a work in progress...:)<br/>
