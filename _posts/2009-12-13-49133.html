<div id="ygrps-yiv-643507380">Still deschooling, and finding that my expectations about<br/>
what my children &quot;should&quot; be doing with regards to taking<br/>
care of our home and our possessions have been getting in <br/>
the way of me appreciating my children who they are in<br/>
this moment.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind grocery shopping, even though I really, *really*,<br/>
REALLY don&#39;t like shopping, because I don&#39;t expect that the <br/>
kids, at their current ages, &quot;should&quot; be responsible for buying <br/>
their own groceries.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind laundering their clothes, because I don&#39;t think <br/>
that&#39;s an &quot;age-appropriate&quot; job for them, either.  They do like<br/>
to press the buttons on the machines, and so they do, and they <br/>
are willing to carry their dirty clothes down to the laundry <br/>
room in the basement, because they know my back hurts and that it <br/>
is a bit hard for me to get up and down four flights of stairs numerous times a day, and they do that for my happily, too.  But <br/>
I don&#39;t expect them to take it all on themselves, I don&#39;t even <br/>
expect them to carry the laundry up and down the stairs (although <br/>
I am grateful to them when they do, and I tell them so), and I <br/>
don&#39;t resent that I am the one who does the bulk of the washing.<br/>
<br/>
But I found I was stuck in resentment because they weren&#39;t <br/>
carrying plates to the sink, or wiping up spills, and they were leaving their toys and books just strewn everywhere, and then <br/>
were frustrated when they couldn&#39;t find their things, and the <br/>
things they weren&#39;t doing, I had chosen to classify in my mind<br/>
as &quot;things a child of age X should be doing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I dropped the expectations:  &quot;they should be doing <br/>
this; they are old enough to take on these responsibilities...&quot; <br/>
that freed me to lovingly take care of them, and even to help <br/>
them find a misplaced item for them, when they need that, without <br/>
any snide remarks about &quot;a place for everything and everything in <br/>
its place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read and re-read the pages about &quot;chores&quot; and choices and the<br/>
fact that I chose to bring these people into my life, and the <br/>
more I read, the more it sinks in.  No, they aren&#39;t trying to <br/>
enslave me with endless housework, and no, I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do <br/>
the housework. They are just having fun, and I can choose to facilitate that.  I WANT to make that happen!  <br/>
<br/>
I can remember as a kid, feeling like I had worked hard at home <br/>
to do everything right.  And I got it about 99% right, and I got <br/>
hell for the 1% that I hadn&#39;t gotten right.  I remember getting<br/>
yelled at for dripping water on the floor after a shower:  &quot;YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO DRY OFF COMPLETELY WHILE STANDING IN THAT SHOWER STALL!&quot;  I remember being shamed for not squeezing the toothpaste tube from the botton and flattening it as I went up.  (I guess that would be funny if it weren&#39;t sad.)  There was *always* something <br/>
like that I was forgetting, and I just don&#39;t want anything<br/>
resembling that for my children.  So I choose to drop the <br/>
expectations about what is &quot;age appropriate.&quot;  (It&#39;s easier said <br/>
than done, but that doesn&#39;t stop me from choosing and choosing <br/>
again, reminding myself that what I want is for my children to feel deeply loved for who they are right now.)<br/>
<br/>
I found myself in the mall recently, and one shop was selling<br/>
signs to hang in the home, and one of those signs read, &quot;Be kinder<br/>
than is necessary.&quot;  I like that.  I don&#39;t know if it is even<br/>
possible, but it is a nice guiding principle, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks to all of you.  Things get more and more peaceful, and<br/>
I am more and more the mother I want to be.<br/>

REALLY don&#39;t like shopping, because I don&#39;t expect that the<br/>

their own groceries. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Instead of think of it as &quot;grocery shopping,&quot; if you sometimes turn it  <br/>
to an outing with one (or more) of the kids, take your time, look at  <br/>
the odd vegetables, see what&#39;s on sale, say good morning to the  <br/>
butcher, get a donut...   Process over product means you can get both.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were young sometimes I&#39;d take two carts--the boys in one  <br/>
cart, and Holly the the baby seat of the other one.  I&#39;d put most of  <br/>
the groceries in the Holly-cart, but some of the interesting ones in  <br/>
with the boys, and I&#39;d talk to them, or we&#39;d sing or tell jokes.   <br/>
Sometimes I&#39;d only have two kids, one in the basket and one in the  <br/>
baby seat.  Sometimes if the store was really empty I&#39;d let them all  <br/>
down to walk, but it&#39;s kinda dangerous if it&#39;s crowded.<br/>
<br/>
The more you make it about the kids, the less it will seem like  <br/>
&quot;grocery shopping&quot; and will be part of the fabric of your  <br/>
relationships with your unschooled children.<br/>
<br/>
I used to think I&#39;d be taking my kids to the store with me until they  <br/>
were grown and gone, but that didn&#39;t happen at all.  When they&#39;re old  <br/>
enough not to go, it ends up being just me.  And some of my best times  <br/>
at the store then were when I wasn&#39;t in a hurry *and* I was by  <br/>
myself.  I can stall, I can think, I can listen to the music, i can  <br/>
let other people go ahead of me in the line, I can look at all the  <br/>
potted plants and cut flowers.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70002082">Yes, it is wonderful when shopping is a social activity, <br/>
and an exploration, and a chance to visit with people,<br/>
but the key word is &quot;sometimes.&quot;  It happens sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
I did this with the regular weekly shops when the kids <br/>
were younger and the family was smaller.  But now that we<br/>
are a family of seven, I find that, usually, the kids don&#39;t <br/>
want to accompany me on a &quot;big shop&quot; anymore.  Stocking the <br/>
pantry and the refigerators and freezers (yes we have multiple)<br/>
means filling two or three baskets full of groceries, <br/>
and it takes hours to do, and we run low again after 7-10 days,<br/>
even with a delivery truck bringing us non-perishables, so the<br/>
grocery store is a place everyone has a chance to explore <br/>
*frequently*.  These days, the kids usually want to do other <br/>
things more than they want to accompany me on a &quot;big shop&quot; to <br/>
restock the pantry and refrigerators/freezers.  The kids take sort <br/>
of a &quot;been there, done that&quot; attitude towards grocery shopping.<br/>
<br/>
My attitude is that I choose to shop because we enjoy cooking together, and that means we need ingredients.  Also, I like to <br/>
have lots of different sorts of interesting foods at home for the kids to eat whenever they happen to get hungry, along with a good supply of tried and true favorites and comfort foods.  But I sure like the food prep at home a lot more  than I like the going out alone and filling three carts. (Yes, having a large family was my<br/>
choice, and yes, I am very fortunate that I can feed them, but that knowledge still doesn&#39;t make the shopping all alone anything near to my favorite activity of the week.)<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, when we are doing a &quot;fill in&quot; shop, just getting a<br/>
few odds and ends, or shopping because somebody had an idea<br/>
for a recipe they&#39;d like to try, then we shop as an outing,<br/>
as an exploration, and that is fun.  Sometimes we all go,<br/>
and sometimes just one child will come with me; everybody<br/>
appreciates that everybody wants one-on-one time with Mom.<br/>
If I do have company on a shop, we&#39;ll usually get a snack in the <br/>
store, and definitely incorporate browsing and chatting with <br/>
other customers and with the people who work in the store.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were young, and I only had two of &#39;em, I&#39;d bring<br/>
my son&#39;s toy shopping cart, and he&#39;d push that around, acquire<br/>
items that interested him, and I&#39;d carry my daughter in a sling,<br/>
and she&#39;d reach for or point at items that interested her.  And<br/>
when each of my adoptive kids was new to the family, I&#39;d take &#39;em<br/>
to one of the local Asian grocery stores, to look for items that<br/>
would be comforting and familiar.  (They are all adopted from <br/>
China.) My biological children like the Asian grocery stores, too.<br/>
There are lots of different things to see and touch and<br/>
smell there.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953209551">I took my kids to an Asian grocery store recently, and as they are huge fans of noodles, it was wonderful for them to be able to pick out some noodles from such a wide selection!<br/>
<br/>
Kelly, could you just clarify, when you do a big shop, do the kids reluctantly accompany you, or do they stay home while you do the shopping alone? I can see that either way it is a big job, but one that would be much more arduous with 5 unwilling kids in tow! I now do most of my shopping in the evening while my partner stays home with the kids. Sandra, you look at plants - I sneak a look at the trashy magazines to see the latest doings of the Jolie-Pitt clan!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-599432665">I shop alone, except for those instances when somebody<br/>
specifically requests to come along; it&#39;s actually less<br/>
arduous when one (or more) of the kids want to come along; <br/>
it takes a lot longer, but we have fun exploring and socializing.<br/>
But I understand that there are other things that they would<br/>
