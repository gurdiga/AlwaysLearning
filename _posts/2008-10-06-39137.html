<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705774415">My 9 year old Courtney decided to try school this year. Because of some situations that were somewhat out of my control she wasn&#39;t getting what she needed at home.<br/>
Things have gotten better though some issues are still here like our barely running van, short on money as usual, and no bus service leaves us at home a lot. <br/>
<br/>
After a month she decided school was not for her so I withdrew her. Dad wasnt thrilled about that because he felt that she needed to stick with it. <br/>
Then she found an online accademy and said oh I want to do this!! Dad said ok . <br/>
Well after starting to go through the enrollment process and taking the placement tests we found out that since it was still considered a public school she would have to go take the taks test and I couldnt change her curriculum. She would be expected to do it &quot;by the book&quot;. She changed her mind ( wouldnt you lol?) <br/>
<br/>
Dad gets more upset and says well she needs to pick something and stick with it. <br/>
<br/>
He used to be a lot more supportive of unschooling so I dont get it . <br/>
<br/>
She found time4learning.com and wanted me to order that so I did .i look at it as another tool she can use in addition to researching on the net, playing wow, watching tv, exploring outside, etc etc. Now he is wanting to know how many lessons she did in a day because he dosent want to waste money on it if she isnt going to do it. <br/>
<br/>
Please excuse me .... Argh!!!!<br/>

If things are better, can you  move fully toward unschooling and not  <br/>
piddle in schoolish programs?<br/>

It seems the only way to help your husband&#39;s enthusiasm grow is to  <br/>
unschool happily and well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-96635130">May I also say on this subject, that it helped Brian tremendously to see<br/>
(through screwing up and being so uncomfortable and irked) that it&#39;s not the<br/>
kid&#39;s actions that cause the discomfort.  It&#39;s the divide and the lack of<br/>
trust coming from the kid after a parent gets forceful or figuratively gets<br/>
medieval on their heiny.<br/>
<br/>
A parent would *like* to believe that *any and all* kind of well meant<br/>
parenting is the responsible thing to do.  It&#39;s gauling to realize that<br/>
sometimes the parenting is lacking and results in that nasty uncomfortable<br/>
feeling of distance from the kid.  I think Karl and unschooled children are<br/>
much better able to notice and respond well to these social cues than many<br/>
adults who were literally trained to ignore many social cues.  Talk about<br/>
gaps in the education... I definitely have that one to a sometimes annoying<br/>
degree.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully he and Courtney won&#39;t be sitting with that feeling too long before<br/>
he realizes what the difference is and circles back around from being<br/>
knocked out of the unschooling groove by some errant thought process.  It&#39;s<br/>
lonely at the top saying you&#39;re &quot;right!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-505404152">I went to go read links for a while and off to clean and bit , then back and ended finding my day in the life page from last year . <br/>
<br/>
So I sent it to dh and wrote asking if we could talk about the sudden need to control. So he called me at lunch and we talked a bit. He said Im sorry Ive been really stressed about finals and afraid Im going to fail one of my classes and I am so sick of it I just want it to be done. I asked him why he kept going to school . He said because Im now 10 weeks away from finally getting my bachelors and that will hopefully get me more money in the future. <br/>
<br/>
So I asked him ..... Getting your bach was a goal you set for yourself right? yes <br/>
Courtney isnt getting a degree out of going to 3rd grade or doing 3rd grade lessons right? ok true  You made so many comments about all the things she was learning last year when we didnt do a single lesson right ? well yea <br/>
Judging from the papers she broght home and the things she said was she learning anything new? he laughed ok no she wasnt it was ridiculous she was having to do things she had already learned over and over again. <br/>
<br/>
He is still a bit anxious because she dosent seem to want to stick with anything and I said ok imagine that you were starving and someone took you to this room full of all different kinds of food some you know you like, some you have never had before but it looks tasty what are you going to do? You can have whatever you want what are you going to do just sit and eat the pot roast or go fill your plate up with a little bit of everything that looks good? ....everything that looks good   ........ok I see where you are going with this . She is a great kid and she is learning so Ill take a deep breath and relax now . <br/>
<br/>
So when you come home will you ask her what she has done today or if she wants to watch mythbusters with you but not what lessons did you do on time 4 learning? Its on for the month if she dosent use it all we have to do is cancell no big deal. ....ok Ill do that <br/>
<br/>
So hopefully the big must have structure and order and must stick to it monster has been evicted ....for a while at least :)<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549676618">You might really enjoy reading Barbara Sher&#39;s book, &quot;Refuse to  <br/>
Choose.&quot; I LOVE it. Here is the Amazon description:<br/>
<br/>
Don’t know what to do with your life? Drawn to so many things that you  <br/>
can’t choose just one? New York Times best-selling author Barbara Sher  <br/>
has the answer—do EVERYTHING!<br/>
<br/>
With her popular career counseling sessions, motivational speeches,  <br/>
workshops, and television specials, Barbara Sher has become famous for  <br/>
her extraordinary ability to help people define and achieve their  <br/>
goals. What Sher has discovered is that some individuals simply  <br/>
cannot, and should not, decide on a single path; they are genetically  <br/>
wired to pursue many areas. Sher calls them &quot;Scanners&quot;—people whose  <br/>
unique type of mind does not zero in on a single interest but rather  <br/>
scans the horizon, eager to explore everything they see.<br/>
<br/>
In this groundbreaking book, readers will learn:<br/>
<br/>
• what’s behind their &quot;hit and run&quot; obsessions<br/>
<br/>
• when (and how) to finish what they start<br/>
<br/>
• how to do everything they love<br/>
<br/>
• what type of Scanner they are (and which tools they need to do their  <br/>
very best work)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
About the Author<br/>
BARBARA SHER is a speaker, career/lifestyle coach, and the best- <br/>
selling author of eight books on goal achievement. Her books have sold  <br/>
millions of copies and been translated into dozens of languages. She  <br/>
has appeared on Oprah, Today, 60 Minutes, CNN, and Good Morning  <br/>
America, and her popular public television specials air nationally  <br/>
throughout the year. Barbara Sher lives in New York City.<br/>

I absolutely love this analogy between eating and learning.  Great!  It gets<br/>
across that both are all about FUN.  What we want in foods and knowledge is<br/>
what draws us to choose a particular thing to eat or learn.  I&#39;m so glad.<br/>

<br/>
Next time he&#39;s staring to lean toward schooling in a year or five,  <br/>
you could just say &quot;Remember how mean school can make even the nicest  <br/>
person?&quot; and hug him.<br/>
