<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538088161">I got really confused for a bit until I realized what<br/>
I was reading was untrimmed posts. please remember the<br/>
folks on digest! TIA! :)<br/>
<br/>
these all had me giggling:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You mean they&#39;re not carried by a swallow?  Not even<br/>
&gt; by two swallows, <br/>
&gt; carrying it on a line between them?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nancy  (tying the topic to film, comedy, Arthurian<br/>
&gt; legends, <br/>
&gt; geography...)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d take the good parts and turn away as blithe as a<br/>
&gt; woodland fairy  <br/>
&gt; from the nutty parts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and also the authority defiant in NYC, which I missed<br/>
in my copying and pasting somehow. ROFL!<br/>
<br/>
and this reminded me of something strange--<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;I&#39;m nobody, who are<br/>
&gt; you.  Are you nobody two?<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s the two of us.&quot;  Emily Dickinson&#39;s beautiful<br/>
&gt; poem...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wrote this poem standing waiting for the bus one<br/>
morning in 7th grade. really. I had never heard of<br/>
emily dickenson, never seen it, and totally recreated<br/>
the exact poem. I didn&#39;t know it was an emily<br/>
dickenson poem until I was in my twenties. freaked me<br/>
out! I think I must have been channeling her or<br/>
something :D<br/>
<br/>
I love this list!<br/>
Julia, also authority defiant, oppositional,<br/>
passive-aggressive, and just plain stubborn in NWGA</div>
