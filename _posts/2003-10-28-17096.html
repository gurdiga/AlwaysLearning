<div id="ygrps-yiv-1149628355">My son is in Babes in Toyland this fall.  I&#39;m sitting here trying to learn<br/>
the tunes to the songs he&#39;s in because he says he needs help with them.<br/>
<br/>
So, here&#39;s the first verse of &quot;I Can&#39;t do the Sum&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If a steamship weighed ten thousand tons and sailed five thousand miles,<br/>
with cargo large of overshoes and carving knives and files;<br/>
if the mates were almost six feet high and the boss&#39;n near the same,<br/>
would you subtract or mulitiply to find the captain&#39;s name?<br/>
<br/>
This is how story problems at school always sounded to me!  :)<br/>
