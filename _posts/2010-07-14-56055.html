<div id="ygrps-yiv-642693689">Why no one can honestly say whether some set of morals (vegetarianism,<br/>
gun play prohibition, religion) are evil or good for unschooling. Why<br/>
each situation is different. Why the answer is almost always &quot;it<br/>
depends!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the question that  masks covert rules in a parent&#39;s thinking<br/>
and, as Joyce Fetteroll mentioned, isn&#39;t the right question for<br/>
getting a good answer about unschooling: Can you simultaneously be a<br/>
good unschooler and stick to your moral of x, y or z?<br/>
<br/>
A better and more effective question to ask is: Does your moral trump<br/>
the relationship between parent and child? Knowing to ask such a<br/>
question though probably makes asking it moot since the question<br/>
itself is based on unschooling principles. People who aren&#39;t quite as<br/>
clear on unschooling principles are going to end up in conversations<br/>
like the following from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rulebound:">http://sandradodd.com/rulebound:</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
******************************<br/>
    The reason this conversation is really bothering me, is because<br/>
Sandra kept responding with other points that had nothing to do with<br/>
my one and only question. (Her points are GREAT ones, and ones I in<br/>
fact agree with, but they are points about something other that my one<br/>
question: Should I give my 4 & 7 year olds that particular game? She<br/>
never said Yes (and why) or NO (and why). You might ask yourself if<br/>
you were trying to have a conversation with someone and they were<br/>
skipping over your particular question, and making lots of other<br/>
points that had nothing to do with what you were still trying to talk<br/>
about!!! I&#39;m not wound up and defensive and angry. Although I find<br/>
myself frustrated, and now on the defense trying to tell you (and<br/>
Sandra) that I agree with all those points she made, BUT IT&#39;S NOT WHAT<br/>
I&#39;M TALKING ABOUT. That&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
A question like &quot;should I buy this, yes or no?&quot; isn&#39;t the kind of<br/>
questions others can answer very well. And if we did, we&#39;d need to say<br/>
WHY we thought so, which would involve explaining a principle. And<br/>
with all of the best answers, it needs to start, &quot;It depends.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If we answer questions with &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no,&quot; and give people what they<br/>
claim to want, or what they think they want, we are chucking fish out<br/>
instead of providing information on how to fish, how to make one&#39;s own<br/>
custom fishing equipment and when and where the fishing is great.<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t work as a series of yes/no questions.<br/>
<br/>
Another principle at work. Helping people learn to find their own<br/>
answers is vastly superior to distributing answers on demand. And<br/>
those who volunteer their time and experience are not willing to hold<br/>
other&#39;s hands for years or months. They want to empower others.<br/>
Empowerment is a principle, not a rule. Learning to examine one&#39;s own<br/>
life and needs and beliefs is necessary for unschooling to work. When<br/>
priorities and principles are coming clearer, such questions as<br/>
whether or not to buy a particular game or tool or movie or food are<br/>
EASY, simple, happy questions. That&#39;s why the mom quoted above didn&#39;t<br/>
get the simple straight answer she thought she needed. No one wanted<br/>
to waste time or energy sending her down the wrong path.  ~~Sandra<br/>
**************************************<br/>
<br/>
The pivot on which such conversations hinge are unschooling<br/>
principles. During my short bit on unschooling lists, the above has<br/>
appeared over and over. Unschooling principles are a cornerstone for<br/>
getting unschooling. As noted, the above conversation took place in<br/>
2004.<br/>
<br/>
In case anyone is wondering (because at one time I did wonder), here<br/>
are essential UNSCHOOLING PRINCIPLES. I don&#39;t see the date written but<br/>
it&#39;s been there a while because I read it a while back ... so Pam<br/>
wrote these some time ago: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles.html">http://sandradodd.com/pam/principles.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Principles are how something works. Unschooling principles are about<br/>
how learning works.<br/>
Rules are how someone outside something naturally occurring thinks it<br/>
works. As such it can be seen as an attempt to understand something<br/>
that occurs naturally on its own. Those who understand how something<br/>
works can support the working of it. That&#39;s where parents come into<br/>
the picture of how learning works; they facilitate the learning that&#39;s<br/>
naturally occurring in their children (and themselves too).<br/>
Another way to put it: Rules are external-- outside --naturally<br/>
occurring things. Principles are already there at work within a<br/>
naturally occurring thing; they&#39;re inborn and integral to the thing<br/>
itself.<br/>
<br/>
Using Pam&#39;s list of principles, learning is ...<br/>
<br/>
Continuous<br/>
Uncoerced<br/>
Fun<br/>
Self-correcting<br/>
Easy<br/>
Meaningful<br/>
Incidental<br/>
Connected<br/>
Unprovable<br/>
Nurtured<br/>

<br/>
For some people the ideas behind sharing their strong beliefs with children can be tied in with a desire to connect with their kids, and/or to create a strong sense of family identity. Those ideas aren&#39;t necessarily incompatible with unschooling. When they get in the way is when the parent&#39;s expression (of values, culture, etc) or the &quot;family identity&quot; override a child&#39;s interest in exploring other ideas about the world. <br/>

I think parents can stick to personal values all day long on a<br/>
personal basis and still make lots of room for children to explore<br/>
their own set of values, which if respected will probably look a lot<br/>
like their parent&#39;s with possibly some individual differences. I<br/>
already see this to some degree in Karl and this may change very<br/>

then, at whatever point one might think he&#39;s finished forming his<br/>
values, he can still change even more.<br/>

---------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering about this in another area.  For most areas of life, <br/>
morals, and belief, and faith, are mostly something in our heads (and in <br/>
our churches/synagogues/mosques, ect).  Two people can live together and <br/>
belive different things.  But, the religion that my husband practices, <br/>
dictates what kinds of foods he can eat, that he can&#39;t use electricity <br/>
on certain days, that he must pray at certain times, etc... and that he <br/>
shouldn&#39;t aid in someone of the same religion (whether they believe in <br/>
it or not) to do something counter to those rules (such as buying food <br/>
for that person which does not meet the religious dietary <br/>
requirements).   This seems like something more than a matter of <br/>
morality or faith.   When beliefs relate to specific actions (moral <br/>
veganism and not buying meat was mentioned in another thread) does this <br/>
reality preclude taking unschooling and applying it to every area of life? <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried to work it out in my head sometimes, but my logic hasn&#39;t <br/>
resonated with my husband as of yet.  One piece of logic goes like <br/>
this:  in X religion, a person is not religiously responsible for <br/>
themselves until they are 12/13 years old, so until that point they are <br/>
not obligated in performing XYZ requirements.  After that point, its <br/>
between them and God, and still doesn&#39;t really involve me.   And they of <br/>
course, always have the choice to believe or not in said system.  Thats <br/>
definitely not the religious community norm here. <br/>

<br/>
I think I&#39;m going to be thinking about this for a very long time <br/>
(considering my husbands commitment).  The religion itself is very <br/>
flexible in many ways, for every question there are many many opinions <br/>
one can follow.  And in some areas, the modern group of this religion, <br/>
view the old answers as out-of-date (in terms of changes in mathematics, <br/>
science, biology, etc).  I think there have been significant enough <br/>
changes in how we believe children learn these days... the tradition <br/>
says its okay to hit a child, but I&#39;ve yet to hear anyone of authority <br/>
say that is right anymore.  I think I&#39;m going to hold out hope that it <br/>
can be compatible with unschooling, and just keep doing what can be done.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
--- There may be an onus on the father as head of the family to maintain<br/>
those religious practices within his household. Bummer he married<br/>
you! (joking... except for his fulfilling his religious duties :-) ---<br/>
<br/>
In the traditional groups, definitely that is true.  I grew up with &#39;no <br/>
unkosher food allowed into this house.&#39;  But in reality, a piece of <br/>
unkosher food in the house is not going to make the kitchen become <br/>
unkosher.  I&#39;m trying to imagine interesting scenarios.   If my child <br/>
wanted to put cheese on their hamburger in our kosher kitchen... I could <br/>
offer a paper plate and ask that they inform me if any real utensils got <br/>
unkoshered so we could rekosher them.  If a teenager wanted to be really <br/>
unkosher, they could have a hotplate, microwave, etc, in their own room <br/>
- they would maybe understand if my husband wouldn&#39;t actually buy those <br/>
things for them.  But their allowance is theirs to use how they want, in <br/>
my head.  And they can get jobs. <br/>
<br/>
If there end up being some areas - such as husband not wanting to take <br/>
daughter to synagogue when dressed immodestly, I don&#39;t see there being <br/>
as much flexibility.  But if we can minimize those situations by being <br/>
the most flexible where we can, then we would be closer to the whole <br/>
&#39;array of benefits&#39; of unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I often think of what Sandra wrote about not signing the permission for <br/>
her daughter&#39;s tatoo (I think it was a tatoo?) out of respect for her <br/>
husbands dislike for them.  Is that not a comparable situation?  The <br/>
light in which that happened did not seem to affect the unschooling <br/>
relationship there (or did it?). <br/>

<br/>
My opinion is that if enough is flexible then trust can be established<br/>
in the relationship so that both parent and child can rely on that<br/>
trust. Some people can do most things without as much of a push (other<br/>
than the parent&#39;s own willingness/desire to move past old patterns).<br/>
Other people can do many things but not everything because it involves<br/>
more than old patterns a parent wants to drop anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that the religion is ok with hitting a child but that<br/>
people don&#39;t actually recommend it. That wasn&#39;t true in the religion I<br/>
grew up in. It was actually recommended, and for me I felt that it was<br/>
necessary to pretty much lose my religion in order not to mess up the<br/>
strong wonderful relationship we were lucky enough to establish in<br/>
Karl&#39;s infancy. What I&#39;m doing is simpler in most ways than making<br/>
unschooling fit that religion but the complexity of flexing here and<br/>
not there sounds just like life to me. I&#39;ve done that so long that<br/>
it&#39;s second nature since I&#39;ve never fit perfectly in prescribed roles<br/>
anywhere I&#39;ve been. And that&#39;s certainly true in the role of mother to<br/>
Karl and partner to both him and his dad.<br/>

It didn&#39;t, but it was all open and sweet and above-board, so that had  <br/>
to help.  She appreciates her dad.  He hasn&#39;t been mean, arbitrary or  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We had things like that --- we don&#39;t drink alcohol, for example, for <br/>
religious reasons (we are Baha&#39;is). The kids never rebelled against the <br/>
way we do things in our house. I expected they&#39;d drink alcohol, and two <br/>
of the three of them have done so or do so - but very little and rarely. <br/>
But they are discreet about it - they don&#39;t want to do it at home. I&#39;d <br/>
think if your kids wanted cheeseburgers, you could make sure they&#39;d have <br/>
plenty of chance to have one outside the house and maybe they wouldn&#39;t <br/>
need to even risk messing with your kosher kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
We had the same thing with more modest dress - my husband is from Iran <br/>
and there were times we&#39;d be going to have dinner or visit friends or <br/>
relatives of his and we&#39;d ask the kids to dress appropriately for that. <br/>
We didn&#39;t act like other things they wanted to wear were bad, just that <br/>
we dressed differently for different occasions. That wasn&#39;t hard and we <br/>
had very few times that we ever even had it come up. The only big thing <br/>
that&#39;s ever happened was recently - Roya is 25 and getting married and, <br/>
at first, we were thinking of having the wedding and reception at our <br/>
house. But my husband and I do not want to serve alcohol at our house <br/>
and they want to have alcohol at the reception. She was disappointed, <br/>
but we worked it out and we&#39;re having it in her backyard, but we&#39;re <br/>
doing a lot of work to fix it up and make it a beautiful location.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see unschooling as letting the kids do or have absolutely <br/>
everything that they might possibly desire, at the expense of their <br/>
parents&#39; feelings or interests. But there is always a sense of finding a <br/>
way for things to work out for the kids, too, as opposed to parental <br/>
absolutes. I don&#39;t think a vegetarian parent has to eat meat because <br/>
their kid wants to eat meat. But I think they should find a way for <br/>
their kid to eat it, if that&#39;s what they want. If they can&#39;t bear to <br/>
have it in the house, then arrange for their kid to eat out a time or <br/>
two a week. Find a way to support the kids&#39; interests. Usually small <br/>
children of vegetarians don&#39;t complain or want meat in the house - but <br/>
might want a piece of pepperoni pizza when they&#39;re at Chuck E Cheese or <br/>
something like that. So - that seems an easy way to support the kid <br/>
without the parent having to fix or cook the meat. When they&#39;re older, <br/>
they can choose to eat meat at friends&#39; houses and when out of the house <br/>
or make it themselves.<br/>
<br/>
If any unschooling vegetarians here are, in fact, having problems with <br/>
kids really wanting their mom to buy and cook meat to eat at home, they <br/>
can speak up, but I have never heard of anybody having that problem. It <br/>
has always been the kids wanting to eat meat elsewhere and the parent <br/>
having a problem with that.<br/>
<br/>
What conflicts with unschooling is the parent wanting to have total <br/>
control over a kid and be completely unwilling to compromise or even try <br/>
to find a way to support the child&#39;s interest. It is short-sighted on <br/>
the part of the parent to think they can control their kids for very <br/>
long, anyway. But, for a parent to want to have a kosher kitchen doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem unreasonable to me - what would be unreasonable would be to demand <br/>
that the kids keep kosher all the time, at home and outside the home.   <br/>
And, if something like using paper plates for nonkosher foods works - <br/>
that&#39;s a great solution. What a wonderful example for your kids - being <br/>
creative about meeting their own interests while being very considerate <br/>
of others&#39; interests. Really sweet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1287734510">I was actually thinking of this very thing yesterday as it relates to this thread. You are talking about keeping kosher and other tenants of &quot;observant&quot; Judaism, and I will talk in those terms, though as Pam and others pointed out, it could certainly apply to other faiths.<br/>
<br/>
Your point about a child being allowed to mix meat and milk on paper plates, etc. not making the home un-kosher, is a good one, but how does your husband feel about that? I could imagine that that might just be too much to ask of him right now. Or that even if he could accept that, ham or shrimp on paper plates might be too much. If not, then great! But perhaps the child could be given permission to explore dietary choices  when visiting friends&#39; homes, shopping at the supermarket, etc. Maybe in this case your husband wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable being present for that, at least not right now, but would he be comfortable allowing you to facilitate it?<br/>
<br/>
You described it as your &quot;husband&#39;s religion&quot;. Where do you fall in your level of observance and support of his, and how does he feel about that? Not a question you need to answer on list. It just jumped out at me.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in a home where my parents practiced two different religions, and while my parents thought they were raising us to &quot;choose  for ourselves&quot; when we got older, my mother&#39;s obvious feeling about my father&#39;s religion never really left it being open as a true choice for us. As a result my Methodist mother doesn&#39;t have the Mormon children I guess she was afraid she&#39;d have; what she has is two  Jews (or one Jew and one raising Jewish children) and an atheist. Her judgement didn&#39;t attract me to her religion either, and as a religious seeker (some kids are, some kids aren&#39;t) I sought something different.<br/>
<br/>
Several people have commented since I started typing this response. I agree with Sandra re appropriate dress for synagogue. Her going should be the choice, not how she dresses when she&#39;s there. We are not Orthodox, but even so, my kids get that there are clothes that are appropriate for synagogue, weddings, parties, etc. and don&#39;t mind because I&#39;m not judging what they want to wear and they otherwise have free reign over what they wear when. Is your daughter asking to wear sleeveless tops and miniskirts to synagogue or otherwise? Or is this just something you can imagine might happen sometime in the future? Is there a way she can be creative with her dress and him still be comfortable that she&#39;s not dressing too immodestly?<br/>
<br/>
My other thought is that we all know kids that were raised within a restrictive religion that shed the tenants just as soon as they were old enough to get out from under their parents&#39; control. If your kids view keeping Kosher as a set of restrictions rather than a positive practice to help them feel connected to their religion, their ancestors, their community, they will not be as likely to keep Kosher when they are adults raising their own families. Same with going to services, keeping the Sabbath, etc.<br/>
<br/>
If these are things that you and/or your husband find important and ideally want them to find important, too, then your best bet is to show them the joy in the religion, the holidays, the practices. Show them why it is important to you in your own life. They may or may not choose to be observant when they grow older, and you and/or your husband will have to figure out how to be ok with that. But a string of &quot;you can&#39;t eat that because it&#39;s not kosher,&quot; &quot;you can&#39;t do that because it&#39;s Shabbat&quot; etc. and mandating practice until they are 13/out of your house and then thinking it will suddenly have a positive meaning for them will likely backfire.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think those people could adapt as much of unschooling as they could<br/>

&gt; Some could be way better than none, though!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --------------------------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I&#39;m going to be thinking about this for a very long time <br/>
&gt; (considering my husbands commitment).  The religion itself is very <br/>
&gt; flexible in many ways, for every question there are many many opinions <br/>
&gt; one can follow.  And in some areas, the modern group of this religion, <br/>
&gt; view the old answers as out-of-date (in terms of changes in mathematics, <br/>
&gt; science, biology, etc).  I think there have been significant enough <br/>
&gt; changes in how we believe children learn these days... the tradition <br/>
&gt; says its okay to hit a child, but I&#39;ve yet to hear anyone of authority <br/>
&gt; say that is right anymore.  I think I&#39;m going to hold out hope that it <br/>
&gt; can be compatible with unschooling, and just keep doing what can be done.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; --- There may be an onus on the father as head of the family to maintain<br/>
&gt; those religious practices within his household. Bummer he married<br/>
&gt; you! (joking... except for his fulfilling his religious duties :-) ---<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the traditional groups, definitely that is true.  I grew up with &#39;no <br/>
&gt; unkosher food allowed into this house.&#39;  But in reality, a piece of <br/>
&gt; unkosher food in the house is not going to make the kitchen become <br/>
&gt; unkosher.  I&#39;m trying to imagine interesting scenarios.   If my child <br/>
&gt; wanted to put cheese on their hamburger in our kosher kitchen... I could <br/>
&gt; offer a paper plate and ask that they inform me if any real utensils got <br/>
&gt; unkoshered so we could rekosher them.  If a teenager wanted to be really <br/>
&gt; unkosher, they could have a hotplate, microwave, etc, in their own room <br/>
&gt; - they would maybe understand if my husband wouldn&#39;t actually buy those <br/>
&gt; things for them.  But their allowance is theirs to use how they want, in <br/>
&gt; my head.  And they can get jobs. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If there end up being some areas - such as husband not wanting to take <br/>
&gt; daughter to synagogue when dressed immodestly, I don&#39;t see there being <br/>
&gt; as much flexibility.  But if we can minimize those situations by being <br/>
&gt; the most flexible where we can, then we would be closer to the whole <br/>
&gt; &#39;array of benefits&#39; of unschooling. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I often think of what Sandra wrote about not signing the permission for <br/>
&gt; her daughter&#39;s tatoo (I think it was a tatoo?) out of respect for her <br/>
&gt; husbands dislike for them.  Is that not a comparable situation?  The <br/>
&gt; light in which that happened did not seem to affect the unschooling <br/>
&gt; relationship there (or did it?). <br/>

My apologies for a really brief post--on an iphone and not much of a &quot;connection&quot;---<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you can include ideas such as Shalom Biyat (Peaceful Home) and Chessed (Loving Kindness) as well as Tikkun Olam (literally, &quot;repairing the world) as stepping stones to conversation regarding Kashrut and Shabbat--in many ways, I think Halacha (Jewish Law) elevates *relationships* to a higher plane of priorities than simple, often unquestioning adherence to the other laws.<br/>
<br/>
My mother grew up in an orthodox home, yet could eat what she wanted when out of the house.....she grew up to keep a Kosher home, for most of my childhood. As kids, we were also allowed to eat what we wanted out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
I see Judaism as very supportive of unschooling because of Bar-Mitzvah: your young ones will get a chance at 12 and 13 to chose for themselves what path they want to follow--AND--how they want to follow it. Until that point, in my (non-Rabbinical) opinion, unschooling and Jewish principals such as practicing loving kindness and working toward a peace-filled home take center stage.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
In this example, your family aren&#39;t the only ones being asked to make adjustments--your daughter&#39;s choice of dress would be felt by all in the synagogue.  The rest of the congregation shouldn&#39;t *have to* be flexible!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184129572">***I&#39;ve tried to work it out in my head sometimes, but my logic hasn&#39;t <br/>
resonated with my husband as of yet. One piece of logic goes like <br/>
this: in X religion, a person is not religiously responsible for <br/>
themselves until they are 12/13 years old, so until that point they are <br/>
not obligated in performing XYZ requirements. After that point, its <br/>
between them and God, and still doesn&#39;t really involve me. And they of <br/>
course, always have the choice to believe or not in said system. Thats <br/>
definitely not the religious community norm here. ***<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a piece of logic that I find unsettling... &quot;After that point, its between <br/>
them and God...&quot;.  Well, NO it isn&#39;t.  Setting aside for a moment whether one <br/>
believes in God or not, those rules that define the religious practice have <br/>
little to do with God.  Those are long standing practices that came from <br/>
somewhere, have a historical context that may or may not apply to practices in <br/>
today&#39;s world, yet STILL are practiced as if they were meted out on a stone <br/>
tablet directly written by the hand of God via a mortal, just yesterday.  There <br/>
were very good reasons why pork wasn&#39;t consumed, and those same things applied <br/>
to other scavenger animals that people could consume.  Modern knowledge about <br/>
cooking and cleanliness makes those reasons almost obsolete.<br/>
<br/>
My dad grew up as a Seventh Day Adventist.  There are so many rule bound <br/>
obligations within that religion that have nothing whatsoever to do with the <br/>
belief in God, yet to not follow them makes one less godly.  Outside of that, my <br/>
dad decided that he did believe in God, but he wasn&#39;t going to follow rules that <br/>
didn&#39;t make sense, especially if they weren&#39;t in the bible, or rather the New <br/>
Testament, since the Old Testament has lots and lots of rules that were made <br/>
obsolete by the New!  One could make all kinds of logical assessments about that <br/>
even, but I&#39;ll stop there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149391957">***If any unschooling vegetarians here are, in fact, having problems with <br/>
kids really wanting their mom to buy and cook meat to eat at home, they <br/>
can speak up, but I have never heard of anybody having that problem. It <br/>
has always been the kids wanting to eat meat elsewhere and the parent <br/>
having a problem with that.***<br/>
<br/>
The last time I saw this issue come up was at the FamilyrunNing site.  The <br/>
issue, it turned out, wasn&#39;t so much about whether or not the mom would buy meat <br/>
for her kids when they asked, while out and about.  It turned out that one of <br/>
the 2 kids wanted to eat meat and the other kid was being cruel about it, <br/>
parroting things that had been said about eating meat.  <br/>
<br/>
That is where being kind and maybe not saying so much about &quot;meat is murder&quot;, <br/>
might really be better than giving a child a full account of how slaughter <br/>
houses kill animals.  It doesn&#39;t mean that mom has to go buy packages of meat to <br/>
cook up, it means lovingly feeding her children vegetarian food and IF they ask <br/>
to eat meat, finding ways to do that, that are respectful for the whole family. <br/>

<br/>
No, it isn&#39;t.  At least not for a non-unschooling family!<br/>
<br/>
But wouldn&#39;t an unschooling family who is also orthodox hope to foster an environment where such a choice would be acceptable?  I can think of a few ways, like having a Bar Mitzvah at a reform or conservative synagogue, that would enable a young person to both move into religious responsibility to a lesser-degree (if they so choose) and give the parents the &#39;nachas&#39; (pride) of the ceremony......<br/>
<br/>
I do know a few teens who&#39;ve decided not to have a Bar/Bat Mitzvah as well....<br/>
<br/>
On another note, it isn&#39;t that uncommon for people well into adulthood to have a Bar Mitzvah.  I&#39;ve seen quite a few for converts, Russian Jews who&#39;ve immigrated to Israel and older men and women who never had one as teens.  I&#39;m not sure how &quot;kosher&quot; is is, but waiting could be an option as well.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, it is very rare for orthodox Bar Mitzvahs to include showering the young teen with &quot;cash and valuable prizes.&quot;  Often there is a luncheon afterward, and sometimes,  it is fancy.  But the image I think you&#39;re conveying is one of secular American Jews for whom this ceremony is one of the few times they embrace anything having to do with religion.  A rite of passage, yes--but of a very different face!<br/>
<br/>
Also, it is very rare in secular Israel as well as in orthodox communities outside of Israel for girls to have a Bat Mitzvah at all. <br/>
<br/>
What I was wanting to convey is that the religion, in my opinion, supports individual responsibility/*choice*--and you are absolutely right--that choice must be supported by the parents for it to be a *real* choice on the part of the child.<br/>

<br/>
Where parents can get hung up on their kids trusting them is the  <br/>
parents feel the yeses more, especially the times they&#39;ve  <br/>
inconvenienced themselves, and the kids feel the noes more. *And* the  <br/>
parents include in the yeses the things they make sacrifices to give  <br/>
to the kids but the kids haven&#39;t asked for. (Big house, big yard, big  <br/>
vacations, full meals, clean laundry ...)<br/>
<br/>
It helps loads to feel how powerless kids are, to consciously lend  <br/>
them our power to help them get what they want. If a parent is  <br/>
disgusted by meat, and the kids like meat, it may not be enough to  <br/>
tell them they can have it anytime they want. If the kids are  <br/>
sensitive, they may assume even asking is bothersome. So put the  <br/>
offers out there. Make sure they&#39;re filled to overflowing with the  <br/>

with the preconceptions of modern culture looking at something founded <br/>
on different preconceptions.  The value of any tradition, new or old, <br/>

after the age of 12/13 children become responsible for their religious <br/>
choices. They can choose not to believe, or to believe, to whatever <br/>
extent (God, Torah, Rabbinical...) they choose.  But according to the <br/>
religion (from what I understand of it right now), its not my <br/>

they are not considered &#39;adults&#39; and the laws aren&#39;t binding on them at <br/>

<br/>
The issue, though, is what to do when there is a request for direct <br/>
support in doing something that is not &#39;allowed&#39; by the religion - since <br/>
part of the law is not to support someone Jewish in doing something <br/>
against that laws.  But what I&#39;m reading here is that its just going to <br/>
have to be a case by case scenerio, as each instance will be too <br/>
different for any blanket statement.  We&#39;ll have to judge the effect it <br/>
might have on the people around us (as in the modest dress at synagogue <br/>
example), my husband&#39;s and my comfort levels, how directly we would have <br/>
to be involved, etc.  Similar to Pam&#39;s example about alcohol and her <br/>
faith, I hope that we can maintain the choices that are important to us <br/>
while having respect for our children&#39;s choices.<br/>
<br/>
This thread has been very very helpful in clarifying for me how parent&#39;s <br/>
choices for themselves and allowing children to make their own choices, <br/>
in situations where it seems like there would be conflict, can not get <br/>
in the way of unschooling. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a Torah Observant Christian, this is my understanding as well.  I follow the Torah, because I believe it contains teachings about how to best show our love for others, our community, our bodies, ourselves and God.  The important thing is the relationships- with God and others.  I am not responsible for my children&#39;s decisions regarding their relationship with God or how they express it.  I am only responsible for how I live my life, how I treat others including my children, and for introducing my children to God.  <br/>
<br/>
The types of issues brought up in this thread don&#39;t come up very often in my house, partially because my children are so young and partially because I only follow the Torah, not the rabbinical laws, so there is a lot less.  On thing that has come up is the issue of eating Kosher, especially since my husband does not.  But again, Biblical Kosher is actually pretty easy to keep.  <br/>
<br/>
Last week, my daughter wanted marshmellows at the store and I said no.  But I also said that I will look for some Kosher ones somewhere else and she has a whole huge array of candy options that I do joyfully buy for her every time we go shopping.  So, it wasn&#39;t a big deal to her.  If it had been a big deal and that was what she really wanted right then and couldn&#39;t wait for me to find the Kosher ones, I would have bought them.  Then stocked up on Kosher ones for next time.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra has said many times here to make the better of two choices and that resonates with me on this level as well.  When I am in a dilemma of personal beliefs vs. possibly damaging a relationship I will pick the option that builds the relationship.  Then look for solutions that can accomodate both.  If that means I break Torah while I am at it, I am not concerned about God striking me with lightening.  I&#39;m always growing and learning, and since I believe Torah is about relationships anyway, I trust that he will help me find a way to keep relationships the priority while keeping Torah. <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Right.  It&#39;s not about persuading or manipulating someone into<br/>
&gt; trusting you.  It&#39;s about becoming trustworthy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I wanted to ask about &quot;covert rules&quot;--what was intended by that?<br/>
&gt; Sneaky rules?  Did the first poster define &quot;covert rules&quot; and I missed<br/>
&gt; it?  It&#39;s not a term that makes sense to me, and I&#39;d like that<br/>
&gt; clarified before it sits in the archives too long.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-323739002">-----An eleven or 12 year old isn&#39;t going to start thinking in advance about whether he would like to go against his parents and friends and relatives and refuse a Bar-Mitzvah at which people intend to shower him with cash and valuable prizes.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not very realistic.------<br/>
<br/>
We know a family whose twins had their Bat-mitzvah at age 13 but their younger sister elected to put it off a little.  She was not as interested as her sisters were in learning the Hebrew she&#39;d need to know and though she thinks she will do it eventually, no one is pressing her to do it and she&#39;s happy with her supportive parents.  She&#39;s 15 and hasn&#39;t made the decision to do it.  Her parents (and the Synagog) are OK with it if she decides never to do it.  Her sisters got a BIG party at their Bat-Mitzvah.  The parents are thinking of making a big deal out of the younger sister&#39;s 16th birthday party instead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041716159">I don&#39;t think it&#39;s for not thinking so much as not realizing what it<br/>
is that one is thinking in terms of how it effects others, especially<br/>
one&#39;s children. &quot;Not under my roof&quot; might come from a well-honed<br/>
individuality that has been hammered into the parent since childhood<br/>
onward, and there&#39;s a place for that kind of thinking that doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem harmful to one&#39;s children but is.<br/>
<br/>
Conditioned behavior is the exact thing that unschooling parents need<br/>
deschooling from, unless they were unschooled themselves, whether<br/>
their children ever attended school or not.<br/>

<br/>
Too bad they missed 15, they could&#39;ve done a quinceanera!  That idea really <br/>
fascinated me!  I&#39;d do one if I could be 15 again!  I love age celebrations! <br/>
 It&#39;s a coming of age thing that is sort of lost on our culture that keeps kids <br/>
as kids until the age of 18!<br/>
