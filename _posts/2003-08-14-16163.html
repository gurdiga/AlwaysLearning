<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574006551">I&#39;ve known one family, and they told me about another, where perfectly nice <br/>
pit bulls they&#39;d had for years, startled by a cat they&#39;d known for years, <br/>
killed the cats. I suppose other dogs could do the same thing, but both stories I <br/>
heard happened to be about pitbulls.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be nervous. But I also have to share that I&#39;m not really a dog person.<br/>
