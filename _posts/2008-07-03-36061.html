<div id="ygrps-yiv-1992067570">I&#39;m new to the group and to unschooling, but I&#39;ve read a month or so&#39;s<br/>
posts (ok, not *every* one!) and find this group thoughtful and<br/>
compassionate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like your views on deschooling in a situation where grandparents<br/>
are raising kids. My partner and I are raising 3 of her 7 grandkids.<br/>
Their young mother and aunts are all focused on looking &quot;sexy&quot;, hip<br/>
hop culture, TV and video games. Not much else interests them and they<br/>
find me weird because I want more for the kids I&#39;m raising. The mom<br/>
doesn&#39;t support homeschooling because she thinks the kids will miss<br/>
out on the fun of socializing at school (cutting classes, doing drugs,<br/>
PDAs with your boyfriend, etc). None of my partner&#39;s daughters<br/>
finished high school or even got a GED, nor have they experienced much<br/>
beyond &quot;consumer culture&quot;. They seem to me to have very limited lives<br/>
and outlooks, including a &quot;learning&#39;s not cool&quot; attitude.<br/>
<br/>
The kids we&#39;re raising are 13 (the boy), 11 and almost 9 (a couple<br/>
weeks). I&#39;ve been homeschooling them for about 2 years and they were<br/>
very receptive at first (I tried a Charlotte Mason/Robertson approach,<br/>
emphasizing reading and independent work), but then mom told them she<br/>
didn&#39;t want them to be homeschooled. They&#39;ve been less receptive since. <br/>
<br/>
I guess my question is how do you deal with family influence that<br/>
isn&#39;t abusive exactly but is not only unsupportive, it undermines.<br/>
<br/>
I am open to any and all thoughts, thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074692193">I forgot to add:<br/>
I want to transition to unschooling but fear that my kids will use their<br/>
mother as a model and watch sitcom reruns and horror movies all day<br/>
and not much else! Their extended family teases each other for showing<br/>
interest beyond a narrow definition of &quot;cool&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do when the kids you are trying to unschool have<br/>
significant role models that are counter to your values and what you<br/>
are trying to help them find in themselves?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112957456">I&#39;m reading Sandra Dodd&#39;s site on Unschooling and some other resources <br/>
(I haven&#39;t asked the working spouse to buy me--yet another!--book on how <br/>
to homeschool so I&#39;m reading everything I can find on the web, including <br/>
the &quot;course&quot; at the 101 site). I&#39;m finding it a powerful healing <br/>
process. It&#39;s like I *knew* all this stuff before I actually got <br/>
involved in kid&#39;s lives, then for various justifications (I&#39;m a &quot;step-&quot; <br/>
so there were family systems already in place...their &quot;real&quot; mom openly <br/>
&quot;hates&quot; me and actively undermines our solidity as a family...&quot;I&#39;m human <br/>
had have needs, too&quot;...etc.) I found it hard to practice. Just writing <br/>
my first post asking for advice I found myself re-wording three times as <br/>
I learned more about myself and the situation just trying to write about <br/>
it. I got to observe my part in the tangle trying to describe it. I <br/>
finally just stopped re-writing and sent it, possibly prematurely.<br/>
<br/>
I want to say &quot;thanks for being here!&quot; thanks for caring about kids and <br/>
how they really feel, thanks for reminding me who I am--or at least who <br/>
I&#39;ve always wanted to be--and for helping me become more that by helping <br/>
me see myself.<br/>
<br/>
I especially found this moving: &quot;I can now say that I will never say <br/>
anything like, &quot;I wish I&#39;d let them fight it out more,&quot; or &quot;I wish I&#39;d <br/>
punished them more,&quot; or &quot;I wish I&#39;d yelled at them more.&quot; I will only <br/>
ever say that I wish I&#39;d been more patient, more attentive, more calm <br/>
and accepting of the normal stresses of having young children.&quot; (from <br/>
Sandra Dodd&#39;s page on Parenting Peacefully)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
