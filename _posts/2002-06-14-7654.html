<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878840591">I know we had a brief discussion of Google many months ago. It is one of my<br/>
primary internet research tools, a gateway to all that good information on<br/>
the net.<br/>
<br/>
I ran across this article on how to sharpen your searches in Google. It<br/>
contains many search concepts and a lot of good simple information that I<br/>
often forget to use when I am Googling.<br/>
<br/>
I like the opening line of the article, &quot;You know your site has the right<br/>
stuff when its name becomes a verb.&quot;<br/>
