<div id="ygrps-yiv-451443302">I&#39;d say this is quite a creative idea!  <br/>
<br/>
What I hear is a Mom whos is tired of doing all the food work and who is <br/>
tired of the whining, disagreements, etc that go with wanting kids to make <br/>
better food choices....<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can apply your creativity to coming up with a plan that simply <br/>
relieves you of kitchen duty!<br/>
<br/>
Your two hopes are:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My two big hopes are that I&#39;ll eliminate the whining for expensive <br/>
&gt; cereals at the grocery store and that they will eventually choose to <br/>
&gt; eat their own fruits and veggies without me making them.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Re: Whining:<br/>
One strategy is to become more comfortable with the whining....don&#39;t hear it <br/>
as &quot;you&#39;re a bad mom bec. I&#39;m not happy&quot; (my baggage).....I have a child who <br/>
just seems to melt more easily....whose &#39;language of love&#39; is getting <br/>
things....whose reaction to &#39;pick a special food&#39; is to find 3 and whine/cry <br/>
bec. he can only get one.....when it is just the two of us, I can manage <br/>
okay...when all three are with me, the other 2 pick up on the &#39;I want&#39;s and <br/>
it&#39;s hellish.....I&#39;d say I&#39;m a pretty attentive Mom, too, I just think that <br/>
being in stores and seeing things that he doesnt have is very hard on him <br/>
specifically so I try not to go there.....<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t shop with the kids much anymore....<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a thought, may be the kids are bored when they go on big 1 hour <br/>
shopping sprees and the &#39;I want&#39;s are a reaction to the boredom....????<br/>
<br/>
Re: fruits and vegetables<br/>
There have been lots of ideas here about that....the biggest one, imo, is the <br/>
letting go....it seems you have the belief that if &#39;left to their own <br/>
devices&quot;, they will eventually pick the healthy food (&#39;healthy&#39; being defined <br/>
by whatever theory you hold!).....THEN, theoretically, you can similarly <br/>
trust them that they will pick the healthy foods eventually at home - all <br/>
things being equal...<br/>
<br/>
another anecdote:<br/>
I am exploring with new vegetables myself....so I&#39;m making eggplant dip <br/>
(which can be like a bean dip), squash, zucchini, and spinach.....I NEVER <br/>
EVER had these things before this year!  Going with the theory that you can <br/>
only change yourself, I decided to make myself healthier through a greater <br/>
variety of veggies....<br/>
<br/>
My theory (latest): what you wish for in someone else, do it yourself in <br/>
yourself.....<br/>
(eg.: want more loving?  give more loving.....want folks to be kinder and not <br/>
shout at each other?  then be kinder and don&#39;t shout......want folks to eat <br/>
better, then eat better....make sense?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, nuff said.....Thanks for throwing out the idea....gave me a lot to <br/>
think about..... (Now dd wants me to take her to the grocery store so she can <br/>
prepare a meal!  She likes your idea....You&#39;ve inspired her!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450909167">Thanks for the input everyone!  Here&#39;s what&#39;s up with our little food <br/>
experiment.  I took the kids shopping and wrote everything down they <br/>
bought.  I let them buy whatever they wanted.  I think it would have <br/>
worked in terms of money and stuff, but everyone quickly got sick of <br/>
opening the fridge and trying to remember whose stuff was whose.  So <br/>
we&#39;re just going to do what some have suggested and put a shopping <br/>
list up and anyone can write anything on it (or tell me to write <br/>
anything on it for the younger ones).  I promised I would buy <br/>
whatever was on the list that I could afford. <br/>
<br/>
I told them I would do the same thing with buying other stuff like <br/>
toys.  If it could fit into the budget I would buy it.  My 9 year old <br/>
can understand that we have X amount of dollars and can therefore <br/>
only afford to spend X amount of dollars.  I&#39;m not sure what other <br/>
way to do it...</div>

 </span></blockquote>This sounds like your way of making &quot;yes&quot; the default answer to a request. <br/>
This was a turnaround for me, in my own thinking, too.<br/>
