<div id="ygrps-yiv-1767364223">My son really likes the kind of logic puzzle where they give you just enough pieces of information about a situation, and you have to figure out the rest.<br/>

My son would like to get a puzzle book that has ONLY those types of puzzles. We have done Top Secret and Which Way USA from Highlights, and they would have maybe one of those types of puzzles per issue.<br/>

Those sound like one of the problem types on the LSAT.  You could browse <br/>
through an LSAT study guide at a bookstore, and see if it has what you <br/>
are looking for.  The guides have lots of sample problems from the <br/>
LSAT.  But, it wouldn&#39;t be ONLY logic problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871422143">We have a book with a fair number of them, mixed in with other  <br/>
things.  I&#39;ll ask Holly if she knows which and where it is.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;re deductive reasoning puzzles (as to how you could look  <br/>
them up, I mean).<br/>
On the Law School Aptitude test there are some things kinda like that,  <br/>
including numbers and interest or store rental rates (business  <br/>
aspects) mixed with information that&#39;s totally irrelevant, so part of  <br/>
the problem is reading the situation and figuring out what to ignore  <br/>
and what to pay attention to and use to find the best answer.   Maybe  <br/>
if they still have questions like that, a sample test of prep book for  <br/>
the law school test (LSAT in the U.S.) would net some fun stuff.<br/>

OH!! Anne, I wrote my notes before I saw yours.   &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In the late 1970&#39;s, I aced that test.  Did I go to law school?  I did  <br/>
not.  I had this boyfriend, younger than I was, who said he would help  <br/>
me through law school, support me while I went, give me a place to  <br/>
live.  Yeah, right, I&#39;m thinking.   AS IF.    So I did other stuff  <br/>
instead.   Turns out that Keith Dodd kid probably WOULD have helped me  <br/>
after all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-442172565">I have a game called Mindtrap with thousands of questions like that.<br/>
One quick example is:<br/>
Which of the four following words does not belong in this group and why?<br/>
Oriole<br/>
Orange<br/>
Month<br/>
Oil<br/>
<br/>
Answer: oil, it&#39;s the only one of the four that can rhyme with another word in the English language.<br/>
<br/>
That was short, some are a whole paragraph.<br/>
<br/>
Here I&#39;ll do one more.<br/>
 In Hawaii, if you drop a steel ball weighing 5 pounds from a height of 45 inches, will it fall more rapidly through water at 20*F or 40*F or will it make no difference?<br/>
<br/>
A: 40*F, at 20*F the water would be frozen.<br/>
<br/>
Not sure if this is exactly what you have in mind, but it&#39;s fun.  We never played it as a game (as it&#39;s sold as) we just ask the questions to each other.<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s one about what kind of cigarettes or cigars or tobacco the  <br/>
people use, and who has a fish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Question:<br/>
There are 5 houses in 5 different colors. In each house lives a person  <br/>
with a different nationality. The 5 owners drink a certain type of  <br/>
beverage, smoke a certain brand of cigar, and keep a certain pet. No  <br/>
owners have the same pet, smoke the same brand of cigar, or drink the  <br/>
same beverage.<br/>
<br/>
Somebody owns a fish. The question is: who?<br/>
<br/>
Hints:<br/>
The Brit lives in the red house.<br/>
The Swede keeps dogs as pets.<br/>
The Dane drinks tea.<br/>
The green house is on the left and next to the white house.<br/>
The green homeowner drinks coffee.<br/>
The person who smokes Pall Mall rears birds.<br/>
The owner of the yellow house smokes Dunhill.<br/>
The man living in the center house drinks milk.<br/>
The Norwegian lives in the first house.<br/>
The man who smokes Blends lives next to the one who keeps cats.<br/>
The man who keeps the horse lives next to the man who smokes Dunhill.<br/>
The owner who smokes Bluemaster drinks beer.<br/>
The German smokes Prince.<br/>
The Norwegian lives next to the blue house.<br/>
The man who smokes Blends has a neighbor who drinks water.<br/>
<br/>
Answer:<br/>
The German owns the fish.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508078959">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean! As a child I loved doing those puzzles. There was/is a magazin called PM logik trainer (german, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pm-magazin.de/de/aktuellehefte/pm_logiktrainer.htm)">http://www.pm-magazin.de/de/aktuellehefte/pm_logiktrainer.htm)</a> and they have only those puzzles. In fact they also have a grid that should help to solve the puzzle, but after a while practising it is also possible doing it without the grid. Check this site it has different puzzles maybe you find some intersting stuff for your son, even though it is not exactly what you are looking for: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.rinkworks.com/brainfood/">http://www.rinkworks.com/brainfood/</a><br/>

Example:  The Camels<br/>
Four tasmanian camels traveling on a very narrow ledge encounter four  <br/>
tasmanian camels coming the other way.<br/>
<br/>
Tasmanian camels never go backwards, especially when on a precarious  <br/>
ledge. The camels will climb over each other, but only if there is a  <br/>
camel sized space on the other side.<br/>
<br/>
The camels didn&#39;t see each other until there was only exactly one  <br/>
camel&#39;s width between the two groups.<br/>
<br/>
How can all camels pass, allowing both groups to go on their way,  <br/>
without any camel reversing?<br/>

Answer:  oil, it&#39;s the only one of the four that can rhyme with another <br/>
word in the  English language. <br/>
<br/>
That was short, some are a whole paragraph.  <br/>
<br/>
Here I&#39;ll do one more. <br/>
In Hawaii, if you drop a steel ball  weighing 5 pounds from a height of 45 <br/>
inches, will it fall more rapidly  through water at 20*F or 40*F or will it <br/>
make no difference? <br/>
<br/>
A: 40*F,  at 20*F the water would be frozen.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is why I almost failed Algebra-these aren&#39;t &quot;logical&quot; to  me in the <br/>
sense of most of them not being something you&#39;d run into in everyday  life <br/>
(like the &quot;Tasmanian Camel&quot; problem) but also because they present them as  if <br/>
there are only 1 right answer, and so many times, there are  more.<br/>
 <br/>
In the first example, Month doesn&#39;t fit, because the rest  start with O and <br/>
it starts with M, and also because the other 3 are  tangible items and <br/>
Month is an idea.<br/>
 <br/>
With the second example, there&#39;s the idea Robin mentioned that  things don&#39;<br/>
t freeze in Hawaii, but also that not all water freezes  at 32 (or 20) <br/>
degrees. It depends on salinity, how fast the water is  moving, how deep it is, <br/>
etc.<br/>
 <br/>
In school (well, I still do), I&#39;d get hung up on what was  &quot;wrong&quot; with the <br/>
problem/question and not even be able to *get* to the solving  of it! I <br/>
don&#39;t know that I could help my kids solve problems like this without  passing <br/>
along that idiosyncrasy of mine...<br/>

My son really likes the kind of logic puzzle where they give you just enough pieces of information about a situation, and you have to figure out the rest.<br/>
<br/>
For example, (I got this one from Professor Layton) you have 3 men and three women.  You have to figure out who is married to whom, and which women are sisters.  You get info like:  only one couple is sitting next to each other.  The man with glasses is married to one of the sisters.<br/>
<br/>
My son would like to get a puzzle book that has ONLY those types of puzzles. We have done Top Secret and Which Way USA from Highlights, and they would have maybe one of those types of puzzles per issue.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of a book or website of those types of puzzles?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know if those types of puzzles have a specific name?  If I knew what they were called, I might be able to track something down.<br/>

&gt; would have maybe one of those types of puzzles per issue.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know of a book or website of those types of puzzles?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Does anyone know if those types of puzzles have a specific name? If I knew<br/>
&gt; what they were called, I might be able to track something down.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; My son really likes the kind of logic puzzle where they give you just enough pieces of information about a situation, and you have to figure out the rest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example, (I got this one from Professor Layton) you have 3 men and three women.  You have to figure out who is married to whom, and which women are sisters.  You get info like:  only one couple is sitting next to each other.  The man with glasses is married to one of the sisters.<br/>

I&#39;m new to the group and haven&#39;t introduced myself yet, but my 11yo son LOVES these kinds of puzzles and could do them (and sometimes does do them) for hours. There is a series of books called &quot;Grid Perplexors&quot; which have 50 or so of these kinds of puzzles. The workbooks themselves are a series and incrementally more difficult, and the puzzles in each book get harder the farther you are in the book, too. They&#39;re nothing but those kinds of puzzles. They are great fun. :)<br/>

I used to have a couple of brain teaser books when I was a kid. They had puzzles like that in them.<br/>

<br/>
The reason you can&#39;t find them is Marilyn Vos Savant invented them  <br/>
and so far they&#39;re just on line.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an online widgit (that also can be downloaded for iPhone/iPod).<br/>

I could be wrong but it looks like they&#39;re handmade, a new one each  <br/>
week, so there may only be a limited number of them.<br/>

Master  Mind for Kids (it&#39;s slightly easier and much prettier than the  <br/>
