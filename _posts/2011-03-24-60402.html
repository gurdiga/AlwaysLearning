<div id="ygrps-yiv-674758753">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My son, who is almost 3, has recently begun playing online games on our computer. So far we have discovered the Sesame Street website. However, that seems very focused on &#39;teaching&#39; children about things like letters, numbers, sounds etc. and some of the games are beyond his understanding at the moment. I tried looking up toddler games on the internet but there seem to be a lot to choose from and I&#39;m not sure where to start!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any recommendations for online games their young children enjoy playing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1682454246">Poisson Rouge is fantastic!  There are no instructions how to do any of the <br/>
games or reasons to play them beyond simply playing them.  My daughter, now <br/>
almost 5 years old, started playing Poisson Rouge when she was around 2.5 years <br/>
old, and it is still one of her favorite websites.<br/>

Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
My son, who is almost 3, has recently begun playing online games on our <br/>
computer. So far we have discovered the Sesame Street website. However, that <br/>
seems very focused on &#39;teaching&#39; children about things like letters, numbers, <br/>
sounds etc. and some of the games are beyond his understanding at the moment. I <br/>
tried looking up toddler games on the internet but there seem to be a lot to <br/>
choose from and I&#39;m not sure where to start!<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any recommendations for online games their young children enjoy <br/>
playing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-467895017">Our daughter who is 3 likes the games at Nickjr.com. The Dora and Deigo ones are good, though the more recent ones are quite a bit harder (there&#39;s no real way to tell from the menus what is a newer or older game, sorry). They are really versatile in what they put into the game and the type of game it is. <br/>

But when she was a little younger, she liked:<br/>

Those are all just single games. We too had a hard time finding ones simple enough for her age then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1251956111">My 5 year old loves zoodles. which basically gives your kids their own virtual games HQ. You set it up with their age and then it gives them access to a huge selection of games from a wide variety of sites such as Nick jr and starfall and cbeebies etc. for my daughter its great because she really values her independence on the computer and loves clicking on loads of different games. This site doesn&#39;t show all the little ads for other games that she often clicks on and ends up at less suitable sites to say the least but at the same time there is a huge  choice of games from many of her favourite sites. Plus if there are sites not included that I know she loves there is  a way to add them to her zoodles set up. You can also add any of the other zoodles games to her account even if they are considered suitable for a different age.<br/>
You can get it as an app for your phone as well and when its on it locks your other keys so they can&#39;t accidentally ring out but you can answer the phone if it rings. Thats been great when we are out and about.<br/>
For us it answered her need for a wide range of games from all different places and her desire not to have us sitting there checking where she was clicking next.<br/>
It does offer reporting facilities to the parents for what sort of games they play on most each week but I never look at that. The ones she plays on most go into a favourites area.<br/>
There is a paid for version but we have only used the free one and its been great.<br/>
Other than that cbeebies, nick jr and poisson rouge have all been massive hits with her. <br/>
