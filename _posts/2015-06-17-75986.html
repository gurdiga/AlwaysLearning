Self Care<br/>
<br/>
As I understand it, for unschooling to work I need to be involved with my children. I have no issue with this and look forward to it. But, I&#39;m an introvert and being around people zaps my energy. I need time in quiet solitude to recharge the batteries. I&#39;ve learned that I&#39;m a much happier person and more attentive to my children when I&#39;ve had some time to regroup. How can I take care of my needs without hindering my daughters? How do I make my need and interests known and respected as well? Ex. If they want to go to the zoo, but I really need a day of rest and stay home.<br/>

-=- How do I make my need and interests known and respected as well? -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you demand respect you will not get any.<br/>
If you are respectful of THEIR needs and interests, eventually, they will be full of respect, with enough to share back out.<br/>
<br/>
-=- If they want to go to the zoo, but I really need a day of rest and stay home.-=-<br/>
Plan the zoo day yourself.  Plan around it.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe take another child with you, or meet another family there.  When you get home, maybe put on a long movie and make them soft places to sit or lie to watch it, and they might fall asleep, but you would have some quiet recovery time.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;ve been in daycare, it&#39;s likely that you&#39;re out of practice and need bonding.  Bonding with four year olds is easier than when theyr&#39;e older, and it&#39;s vital if you want the kind of success stories longtie unschoolers tell.  So don&#39;t schedule too much &quot;self care&quot; or it will do more damage than good.<br/>

I need time in quiet solitude to recharge the batteries.&quot;<br><br>In my experience, our thoughts really do become our reality. Try not to see time out with your children as energy-sapping. Instead, try telling yourself that you become energised by being with your children and actively trying to be of service to them; actively trying to help them do the things they want to do. But don&#39;t do these things with your mind thinking &#39;I can&#39;t wait until I can have my me time&#39; or with your thoughts on an economy of putting the &#39;work&#39; in now meaning you&#39;ll get your time later. Don&#39;t do things with any energy at all of self-sacrifice. Do it actively with love, with generosity. <br><br>You&#39;ll find your children learn that that is the way to be. You&#39;ll find they want, themselves, to help you too, in time. You&#39;ll overhear them a couple of years down the line saying on the phone to a caller: &quot;Mummy&#39;s having a nap. I&#39;ll get her to call you when she wakes up&quot;, without you having asked them to do so. You&#39;ll find them saying &quot;Of course!&quot; when you ask them if they&#39;ll make you a cup of tea while they&#39;re in the kitchen. You&#39;ll see them doing kind things for one another.<br><br>Of course, many of us feel we need some kind of balance in our lives, but, rather than it being &#39;kids things *or* my things&#39;, make it &#39;kids things when that&#39;s what they need *and* my things when it fits in well&#39; - this way of thinking is one of abundance rather than of scarcity. I have four children. We do some things together; my parents do some things with some of my children; their dad does some things with some children - different combinations. I also work two days a week (a career I love), I dance salsa one or two evenings per week, I knit and crochet and play piano. I&#39;m surprised when I look at the amount of things I do for me...but I&#39;ve never chosen those things over things/time my children need or want. We&#39;ve just grown into a family life and a family attitude of there being plenty - plenty of time, plenty of Mummy, plenty of Daddy, plenty of fun...as much as we need or want.<br><br>Clare <br></span></div></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496598728"><p dir="ltr">When kids are young, they take a lot of energy. Sometimes when they are older, too. Accepting that and embracing it goes a long way towards making attached and peaceful parenting, and unschooling, work.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rather than view yourself as trading off between what you need and what they need, try seeing that what they need *is* what you need, if your priority is an attached and connected relationship. I cannot over-emphasize the ways in which this attitude has paid immediate and longer-term dividends for me. When I see my kids priorities as my own, I&#39;m happy: it&#39;s easy to meet everyone&#39;s needs. Over time, I have seen that reciprocity from them. Not a long time, either; my boys are nine and five and they work with me towards solutions all the time, coordinate &quot;up-time&quot; and &quot;down-time&quot; activities (soccer vs.  a movie or a board game).</p>
<p dir="ltr">Go to where they are when they are little. It&#39;s the most powerful way to show them how a healthy relationship works. At some point, sooner than either of us realize, no one is going to ask us to go to the zoo anymore. Go now, when you have the chance. </p>

Let&#39;s not take it so far as &quot;law of attraction&quot; and calling down motorcycles and cash by envisioning them.<br/>

-=-How we speak about an activity (possibly more than how we think about it) is so very important. -=-<br/>

Hold on, though...<br/>
If the way you speak about it is not the way you think about it, that&#39;s a bad direction to go.  I&#39;m not recommending blurting out every tacky thought one has, but to think &quot;stupid&quot; and to say &quot;cool!&quot; isn&#39;t healthy for relationships, nor for mental health, trustworthiness or logic.<br/>

Avoiding negativity, and learning not to be whiney and cynical, will turn night to day, in someone&#39;s life.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m pretty heavily introverted as well. Here&#39;s some things that I&#39;ve<br/>
found helpful (my child Leon is 3; I imagine things will change as he<br/>
gets older):<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- my partner and Leon have breakfast together, and I get a bit of time<br/>
  to have a cup of tea, shower, read a bit in another room. As we&#39;re<br/>
  still co-sleeping and Leon often feeds a lot over the last couple of<br/>
  hours of the night I find this particularly useful.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- both my partner & I work part-time (I work from home). On the days<br/>
  when I&#39;m working, they usually go out for a bit (sometimes on a long<br/>
  trip to somewhere exciting, sometimes just out to the<br/>
  shops/playground). I make a point of taking a tea break and doing a<br/>
  bit of journalling while the house is empty. (In theory it could work<br/>
  the other way too -- I could go out to a cafe or whatever while they&#39;re<br/>
  at home.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- if I&#39;m feeling frazzled when it&#39;s one of my days with Leon, I will<br/>
  suggest quiet activities -- snuggling up on the sofa with his ipad, or<br/>
  to watch something, with a snack. I can read for a bit and still be<br/>
  with him. We often both read/play on tablets over lunch together, too. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- As he&#39;s getting older sometimes I&#39;ll go potter down in the kitchen for<br/>
  10 minutes if he&#39;s happy and busy. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- I have knitting around, and if he&#39;s happily occupied, I will sit<br/>
  nearby and knit. I&#39;m still paying attention but I find knitting<br/>
  calming. Sometimes I read but that can get a bit too engrossing!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- He is usually asleep early evening; I make sure I spend one or two<br/>
  evenings a week on my own / doing a project I enjoy / reading. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Mini meditation / mindfulness -- taking as little as thirty seconds to<br/>
  breathe slowly can be a break. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
- Not expecting too much of myself. I&#39;ve found that the more I have on<br/>
  my to-do list, the harder it is to cope with everything else and the<br/>
  harder it is to be present with Leon when I&#39;m with him. So I keep<br/>
  reminding myself that I can choose *not* to do other things :) And<br/>
  also that it&#39;s OK to do fun recharging things in the evenings and not<br/>
  &quot;ought to&quot; things.<br/>

<br/>
Yes.<br/>
But I&#39;ve spend very many years advising people to keep themselves from thinking &quot;stupid&quot; by changing the way they see their children, and interests, and learning, and unschooling, and relationships, and the contagious deadliness of habitual negativity.   So I don&#39;t want to leave recommendations of just speaking better than one thinks.  I want people to think better. :-)<br/>

Quoting the whole post is frowned upon.  As to just a line, or two, or more—mostly it depends what you&#39;re about to write.<br/>
It was my fault for reading backwards.<br/>
