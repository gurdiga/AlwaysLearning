<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134102804">My son chose to sign up for 4-H.  He likes going to the meetings, he loved entering things in the fair, he chose the projects he wanted to be in.  <br/>
<br/>
Here is the problem: Each project that he signed up for has certain requirements.  He did all the easy ones and then didn&#39;t want to finish.  None of them are too hard for him.  4-H is all or nothing, to finish it you have to complete all your projects that you are signed up for.  He has completed 8 or 9 and only has one to go.  He wants to continue in 4H, but he complains about doing one last project.  Do I make him do it?  Do I let him quit?  I try to talk to him but he just gets mad and says I just can&#39;t do it.  He always gets mad if something is not easy and he has never liked taking his time and working on something or doing something that is not really easy.  He has always done things fast and sloppy, not matter what it is.  Any suggestions?</div>

Help him do it.<br/>
Do it for him.<br/>

If the learning and participation are the important parts, there&#39;s no  <br/>
such thing as cheating.<br/>

Are you sure those are requirements?  I know it must be different by state<br/>
but I&#39;m a 4-H leader and there are no such requirements for our kids unless<br/>
I set up the rules to be that way.  Would the teacher work with you so he<br/>
isn&#39;t required to do as many as he signed up for?  <br/>

<br/>
I guess our 4H programs are run VERY differently.  What is the project that<br/>
he has not finished?  Maybe we can give you some ideas on how to help him<br/>
complete it.  It sounds like a very rigid program for small children.  Have<br/>
you looked into it to see if those requirements are just for the club you<br/>
are in or if it is a state rule?  There might be a way around it. They don&#39;t<br/>
want to lose children in a program like this.  It&#39;s government funded.  :-) <br/>

<br/>
Oh!<br/>
Right.<br/>
When I suggested helping him, I didn&#39;t mean if it was an item for  <br/>
entry in a competition of any sort, but there are ways parents can  <br/>
help even there.<br/>
<br/>
I did crops judging in 4-H (and some other things, but that was our  <br/>
club&#39;s regional contest-winning skill).  I  needed help studying.   <br/>
Other kids helped me, but my parents could have potentially done that.<br/>
<br/>
I could also have used going to feed stores and looking at the seed  <br/>
in the bins, but I didn&#39;t get that.  I didn&#39;t think of it.  I wish  <br/>
someone else had.  I was studying from samples in little pill  <br/>
bottles, but it would&#39;ve been fun (and more realistic) to go to look  <br/>
at feed and seed in its natural (well, at the feed store &lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
environment.  We lived in an apple-growing town, not where feed was  <br/>
grown (not counting alfalfa).<br/>
<br/>
If you want to talk about particulars of the project, I bet people  <br/>
here could brainstorm some good ways to approach it to make it a good  <br/>
and interesting learning experience instead of having the feeling of  <br/>
a dreaded checklist.<br/>

I can&#39;t vouch for any of the film adaptations, but the book is <br/>
wonderful -- the author spends much of his time trying not to be <br/>
schooled, except by the critters surrounding him on the Greek island of <br/>
Corfu.<br/>

Please be careful with the phrase &quot;has to.&quot;  Never use it when you  <br/>
can avoid it.  It fools you into thinking you and your child don&#39;t  <br/>
have choices.<br/>

Then 4-H should be great for him, and you can help it to be great by  <br/>

You could tell the leader that as an unschooler you&#39;d prefer your son  <br/>
be able to try things and drop them without penalty, maybe.  (That&#39;s  <br/>
what I would do, I think.)<br/>
