<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606230083">Here is a perfect example of the kind of name calling I am talking about:<br/>
we were driving home from town tonight. Two boys (7&8) were playing. Then they got carried away and the younger one accidentally hurt the older one-poked his eye, I think. The older one(who has the worst habit of this), said (in a knee-jerk response, almost like it was one word, &quot;Ow, you idiot!&quot;<br/>
The child he said it to couldn&#39;t have cared less-I truly think he just sees this as his brother&#39;s way of reacting(unfortunately), and he was laughing and carrying on just the same. It&#39;s all over in a few seconds with no hard feelings, but I simply don&#39;t like anyone talking like that in our family.<br/>
I really feel like it has become a bad habit rather than a malicious spirit. That&#39;s why I had tried to &quot;break&quot; the habit with consequences. For example, when he used that word he would lose the computer for a day. Now I can see why that doesn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; and how I have been much too behavior focused. I am going to read and reread all the great references you all have so graciously shared with me and begin anew!!!</div>

<br/>
I think I would have said (forcefully, in an &quot;I have the floor&quot; kind  <br/>
of voice) &quot;Was it an accident?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If either or both say &quot;yes,&quot; I might&#39;ve said &quot;Please be more careful,  <br/>
because eye injuries are really awful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay to divert from the moment rather than delving to the depths  <br/>
of what&#39;s happening.<br/>
<br/>
Say something useful and true while defusing the escalating  <br/>
situation.   Say something that brings gravity and a new mood.  (Or  <br/>
levity and a new mood, depending, but you said there was laughing and  <br/>
carrying on.)<br/>
<br/>
If it goes another direction, you could say the older one needs to  <br/>
play more gently, or that making a mistake doesn&#39;t make one &quot;an idiot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the interests of the kids, you might sometimes sit with  <br/>
the internet available and discuss the dictionary definitions of  <br/>
&quot;stupid&quot; and &quot;idiot.&quot;  That could help them see why it&#39;s hurtful to  <br/>
say those things, and wrong.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE things that are &quot;wrong.&quot;  Lots of them.   None of them, if  <br/>
you have no plans or directions or intent to stay alive, but assuming  <br/>
you want to reach a town or the top of the mountain or just a nice  <br/>
meadow for a day off from hiking, heading off a cliff into a deep  <br/>
fissure is &quot;wrong.&quot;   Climbing up when the destination is downhill is  <br/>
wrong.<br/>

<br/>
I would&#39;ve said &quot;whoa, stop a minute, everyone!&quot;  Then I would&#39;ve<br/>
pointed out that 1. someone got hurt by rowdy play, 2. older sibling<br/>
needs to get the attention of the younger one and say, you are being too<br/>
rowdy, you really did hurt me, 3. younger sibling needs to see that he<br/>
actually did hurt someone, even accidentally and should probably see if<br/>
the other person is ok, and 4. state clearly that it was an accident and<br/>
nobody is an idiot and please don&#39;t call anyone an idiot over rowdy play<br/>
that got carried away and caused someone to get hurt.  Then I would&#39;ve<br/>
said to carry on, but more gently please.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I would&#39;ve done in that situation.</div>
