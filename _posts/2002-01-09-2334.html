<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283777756">&lt;&lt;how long will it take me to deschool ?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hi Dawn,<br/>
<br/>
I remember you from the other list (that is currently discussing why bed<br/>
times are a good thing and why unschooling doesn&#39;t work for everyone<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
I believe we will be deschooling for the rest of our lives.  Basically, we<br/>
were brainwashed into seeing something normal and beautiful as something<br/>
artificial and coercive.  I&#39;m constantly catching myself thinking inside the<br/>
box, taking a close look, and realizing that particular box doesn&#39;t really<br/>
exist....I had just been programmed to think it does.<br/>
<br/>
It has been several years of radical unschooling and it is like I am<br/>
continually peeling an onion of false rules, false logic.  It is<br/>
exhilarating and sometimes terrifying and sometimes very sad.  What would<br/>
life be like if we were all free to simply be?  To be Buddha mind?  To be<br/>
what God created us to be?  To be our natural essence?  It blows me away to<br/>
think about.<br/>
<br/>
