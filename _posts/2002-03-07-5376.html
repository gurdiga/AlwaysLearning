<div id="ygrps-yiv-1119499542">Cris directed me to this article at USA Today.<br/>
It&#39;s called &quot;Charting the unchurched in America&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has interesting parallels to unschooling, I think.<br/>
Especially the tone of disdain from the ministers<br/>
remarking on the droves going off and doing<br/>
their own thing.  In places it was striking when<br/>
you replace the unchurching with unschooling<br/>
and see how strong the parallel is.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps these two demographic changes are <br/>
connected?<br/>

<br/>
A nice state by state graphic, too - Nathan wanted to<br/>
see where &quot;none of the above&quot; (us) was in<br/>
each of the states so we made a game out of it and<br/>
he clicked his way across a little geography/religion<br/>
lesson.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I figured out how to send mail to the<br/>
group as myself (yipee!) and not I&#39;m working on<br/>
not submitting neo-haiku format e-mails.  Wish<br/>
me luck!<br/>
