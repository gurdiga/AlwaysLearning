<div id="ygrps-yiv-82474260">Hi all,  I am having a hard time deciding what to do and thought others on this list may be able to offer some guidance.  My son who is 7 and has never been to school or any school type activity has decided that he really wants to go to school.  He has been playing recently with some children that do go to school, in fact that is all he plays with.  We live in Costa Rica where it is illegal to homeschool and so not many people do it.  I do not know of any others in our area.  Anyway, the only options are private schools here which will cost a bit of start up money.  That isn&#39;t even the issue I have really.  I am pretty sure, knowing my son, that he isn&#39;t going to like it at all.  He is used to very little control over his day and I do not think he will like it.  I also happen to feel that school is bad for children and has negative effects that I don&#39;t want him to experience.  On the other hand I want him to decide his path in life but he is 7<br/>
 and doesn&#39;t know what school is like nor does he understand the underlying issues I have with school.<br/>
Anyone here been in this situation?  Any advice?  I am looking into talking to the school director to see if he can shadow for a couple of days or a week so he can see what it is like before deciding to actually enroll him.  Thanks in advance.  Off to track down the howler monkeys we are hearing:)<br/>

Are you foreigners so that it&#39;s legal for you?<br/>
Or if he goes and then is registered, will it be a legal problem to  <br/>
take him out?<br/>
<br/>
If he can legally try it and come home, maybe let him.  He honestly   <br/>
might like it.  He would meet other kids, and that could be good.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could use school in such a way that it can&#39;t hurt him as  <br/>
much, but if you go with that option, maybe discuss with him not  <br/>
discouraging his friends from doing well.   Maybe he could be a bad  <br/>
student without being a bad influence, perhaps:<br/>

My son who is 7 and has never been to school or any school type activity has decided that he really wants to go to school. <br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was 6 (last year) she wanted to go to school fairly desperately.  Although, I didn&#39;t like the idea, I didn&#39;t feel right unschooling her &quot;against her will&quot; as it was.  I felt fairly hypocritical saying she could learn in all these interesting and life-inspiring ways, except for that one in a box that she really wanted.  So she attended 1st grade for 2 1/2 months.  The first month she really enjoyed it, it was novel.  After that it slid downhill in her opinion, but it took her awhile before she was ready to let it go.<br/>
<br/>
She is now enthusiastic unschooler, full of ideas and opinions and fun, but there was a transition period even after such a short schooling journey, where she really doubted herself.  I think her schooling experience made her self-conscious in a way she hadn&#39;t experienced yet, and very occasionally still she&#39;ll put herself down (mostly about her looks).  She also got teased often for having dreadlocks and was told once that a girl &quot;wouldn&#39;t be friends with her because she was white&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So, even though school brought up several issues we hadn&#39;t yet encountered and are still working through, I&#39;m happy with my decision to let her try it for herself for the sheer reason that now she wants to be where she is, instead of imagining how wonderful it would be to learn inside the box.  This was our experience with it, your son may have a totally different experience if he gives it a try.  It seems that a child who goes to school with full parental support for whatever he/she may choose next is probably better off than a child who doesn&#39;t want to be where they are at.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with you decision,<br/>

I agree.<br/>
<br/>
One of the worst aspects of school is the lack of choice.<br/>
Unschoolers can recreate that aspect of school if their kids don&#39;t  <br/>
have a choice about unschooling or homeschooling.<br/>

Not a good idea to say &quot;you have no choice&quot; about something that lasts  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2132711776">Yes, I agree too. Isn&#39;t unschooling about limitless choices and flexibility.<br/>
so if the child wants to go to school and one has the option, then it is a<br/>
better idea to let the child try out school. The support has to be within<br/>
and not with the intention &quot;he will find out soon how bad it is and then I<br/>
told you so&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Simply because a child might like school then the parent is in a fix. and if<br/>
the child comes back then &quot;i told you so&quot;. So keeping an open ended<br/>
situation from within is important here.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

That might be all if there weren&#39;t way over 2,000 people on the list.<br/>
If we say &quot;whatever&quot; or &quot;school is as good as unschooling,&quot; I might as  <br/>
well shut the list down today.<br/>

<br/>
If the child wants to go to school because he&#39;s bored or doesn&#39;t think  <br/>
he&#39;s learning, then the parent is not doing the right things to make  <br/>
unschooling work.<br/>
<br/>
If the child wants to go to school because he wants to see what school  <br/>
is like, or to be around other kids, or to be in orchestra or  <br/>
football, that&#39;s a whole different deal.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is it always fair to say ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Nothing&#39;s &quot;always fair.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The question for this list shouldn&#39;t be what&#39;s fair, but what helps  <br/>
people move toward unschooling IF that&#39;s where they want to go.  If  <br/>
they don&#39;t want to go toward unschooling, this won&#39;t be a very useful  <br/>
list for them, but the answers to their questions might help many  <br/>
others who are reading.<br/>

<br/>
If a child wants to go to school, that parent should talk to that  <br/>
child.  The parents feelings should be secondary.<br/>
<br/>
Not all people have an equal capacity to unschool.  Some are GREAT at  <br/>
it, because they&#39;re patient and imaginative and willing to do things  <br/>
on short notice.  Some have to work hard to be that way.  Some can&#39;t  <br/>
do it, and don&#39;t want to do it, so if they have any fear or  <br/>
insecurity, that&#39;s healthy.  We can&#39;t give anyone the capability to  <br/>
unschool.  We can help them discover whether they have any, and  <br/>
encourage them, and that happens every day here, and the archives are  <br/>
still here, and some of the best parts are here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94650011">My son has been unschooled from the start. He did, however, have a period of time where he was curious about attending formal school (his best friend attends public school). So, we talked about it and explained all of the various aspects. We also told him to think about his choice for a week. Having been a substitute teacher and also being the child of a teacher, I knew all of the aspects of formal schooling all too well. In the end my son was just lonely and wanted more friends and didn&#39;t really want to attend school. There might be an underlying issue like that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This isn&#39;t a support group. It&#39;s a discussion group to help people  <br/>
grasp unschooling so they can figure out how make it work in their  <br/>
families.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; we say hey if<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure what you&#39;re meaning by unfair. Not supportive?<br/>
<br/>
But if a child is curious about school -- which is natural since  <br/>
nearly everyone around them goes, since school figures in most kids&#39;  <br/>
and family shows -- it&#39;s supportive of the child&#39;s interest to let  <br/>
them try it. Unschooling against a child&#39;s will isn&#39;t much better than  <br/>
school against a child&#39;s will. At least if a child must go to school,  <br/>
they can escape home.<br/>
<br/>
But if a desire to go to school is because a mom isn&#39;t meeting the  <br/>
child&#39;s needs, then the mom needs to change if she wants to unschool  <br/>
successfully.<br/>

<br/>
My fear would be that if my child would be happy unschooling but my<br/>
efforts aren&#39;t what they could be due to my blindspots, I&#39;d rather<br/>
know what my uphold up is than to feel that this list is being unfair<br/>
to my reason for posting that might seem to me not to have anything to<br/>
do with me. But what if it is something I could change?<br/>
<br/>
I have sisters who aren&#39;t unschooling... they&#39;re doing school at home.<br/>
Most homeschoolers that I know in my area, well all of them that I<br/>
know, are doing the same. And they are constantly putting children in<br/>
and out of school. Sometimes I know why. Other times I don&#39;t. Of<br/>
course I&#39;m the crazy unschooler so my input is sort of beside their<br/>
point which is to do school at home.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is unschooling and need to step up a bit in strewing, going<br/>
out for playmates/dates, or in their own or their children&#39;s<br/>
deschooling needs a bit more attention.... that would be better to<br/>
know than if something is fair on the list.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; If the child wants to go to school because he&#39;s bored or doesn&#39;t think<br/>
&gt; he&#39;s learning, then the parent is not doing the right things to make<br/>
&gt; unschooling work.<br/>

&gt; If the child wants to go to school because he wants to see what school<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=-Is it always fair to say ...-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nothing&#39;s &quot;always fair.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The question for this list shouldn&#39;t be what&#39;s fair, but what helps<br/>
&gt; people move toward unschooling IF that&#39;s where they want to go. If<br/>
&gt; they don&#39;t want to go toward unschooling, this won&#39;t be a very useful<br/>
&gt; list for them, but the answers to their questions might help many<br/>
&gt; others who are reading.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; -=- I always feel when a parent asks this question there is a deep<br/>
&gt; down fear and insecurity that the parent<br/>
&gt; himself or herself feels about his or her own capability to unschool.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a child wants to go to school, that parent should talk to that<br/>
&gt; child. The parents feelings should be secondary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not all people have an equal capacity to unschool. Some are GREAT at<br/>
&gt; it, because they&#39;re patient and imaginative and willing to do things<br/>
&gt; on short notice. Some have to work hard to be that way. Some can&#39;t<br/>
&gt; do it, and don&#39;t want to do it, so if they have any fear or<br/>
&gt; insecurity, that&#39;s healthy. We can&#39;t give anyone the capability to<br/>
&gt; unschool. We can help them discover whether they have any, and<br/>
&gt; encourage them, and that happens every day here, and the archives are<br/>
&gt; still here, and some of the best parts are here:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote> This is our situation.<br/>
 The question was asked by my son last year. &quot;How do I know I don&#39;t like school if I have never been?&quot; and he said he wanted to go last year, but after the NorthEast Unschooling Conference he changed his mind. <br/>
<br/>
This year he is adament about trying high school (and he IS going to NEUC again this year!) and I have to honor his choice. All his close friends go to school and he wants to be *in the mix* of kids, day in and day out, and join clubs, especially drama. He knows he can take any class at the high school and even join any after school activities, but he says he wants *to be there and experience it all*.<br/>
<br/>
He also knows he can learn anything faster and delve deeper on his own, as he has done all these years, but that is not the reason for him trying school, to increase his knowledge of a subject. He realizes he *will* learn something just as we learn every day in all that we do, but it is the daily camaraderie that he wants to experience.<br/>
<br/>
I find it hard to believe that he can put up with the rules, etc that school brings since he has had choice and has been a freethinker all these years, but sometimes people are willing to put up with the *stuff* to be where they want to be. And you can&#39;t always tell someone what it is like or how bad it will be because we are all unique and one person can be happy when another person is not. They need to find it out on their own.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I was very sad about him wanting to go to school. This year I trust that he knows what he is doing and I actually feel the school would be very lucky to have such a child in their presence. He is a confident, intelligent young man with a good head on his shoulders. <br/>
<br/>
I am looking forward to see how it goes for him . He knows he is able to come home at any time and the school is well aware of that as well. If he does come home, he will re-join a weekly teen group and also wants to pursue internships in the music industry. And perhaps he will continue with any school clubs he has joined. <br/>
<br/>
Do I wish he didn&#39;t want to go school and would be happy with his life as it is? Of course I do, but he is not and we have exhausted all possibilities ( that are financially feasible, that is ) and I am here to support him in his new venture. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter,12 , says she will always unschool  :)<br/>

That was a good description of the difference between the way a  <br/>
confident unschooler will go to school (and see it, and act within it)  <br/>
and a child who never quite understood that he could learn things on  <br/>
his own.<br/>

Hi Sandra,<br/>
Just to be clear, his choices do NOT make ME feel helpless or trapped. <br/>
<br/>
 Perhaps I should have said I *choose* to honor his choice, instead of I have to, especially for new unschoolers.to understand.<br/>
<br/>
But within myself,  it IS a *have to* cuz that&#39;s how we live...I value choice and freedom and trust my child to know what he wants and needs. So in order for me to be the best parent for him, I do *have to* honor his choice and I am happy to do so.  It IS genuine not fake and I do not feel helpless or trapped.<br/>
