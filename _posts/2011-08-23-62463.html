<div id="ygrps-yiv-88771570">I just wrote something at facebook [trashy, creepy little facebook that changes nearly hourly and will be gone someday; I&#39;m a little mad at facebook this morning. :-) ] and thought it should be here where it might change maybe one single life a little bit.  Maybe six or eight lives a medium amount.  But it shouldn&#39;t be swept away like a blade of grass chucked into a flood.<br/>

=========<br/>
<br/>
Just before each of my kids read, they were calm and happy to have others read to them or for them, even if those other kids were younger, because I had talked to them about how differently different kids learn, even in school, and that there would always be some things they could do better than other people, so not to act smart or be mean about that, and some things others could do better or sooner than they could.  It&#39;s normal.   Humility.  I was helping my kids learn humility from a very young age.  I wrote about it a couple of times in discussions back then, 12-15 years ago, and each time another parent got QUITE huffy and said &quot;I don&#39;t WANT my child to be humble!&quot;   And I stopped writing about it.  But I learned over the years not to let someone&#39;s objections keep me from writing something I thought was important.  My kids at 19, 22 and 25 are still humble, not hateful, and open to the knowledge that others know things they don&#39;t, and rather than reject or resent that, they should use or appreciate it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-768989182"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; **<br/>
&gt; how differently different kids learn, even in school, and that there would<br/>
&gt; always be some things they could do better than other people, so not to act<br/>
&gt; smart or be mean about that, and some things others could do better or<br/>
&gt; sooner than they could. It&#39;s normal.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This really hit home for me as my biggest fear moving towards unschooling is<br/>
how we&#39;ll be able to handle the differences to schooled (including schooled<br/>
at home) children. I don&#39;t worry about the differences themselves but I<br/>
worry about how we&#39;d be able to interact with others when the subject of<br/>
differences comes up. I can see that I can really draw from the above in<br/>
those discussions not only with my dd but also with the adults that would<br/>
bring up the differences as a point of concern (it&#39;s happening already from<br/>
my dh&#39;s work colleagues and my dd is only 4yo!).<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; each time another parent got QUITE huffy and said &quot;I don&#39;t WANT my child to<br/>
&gt; be humble!&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder how much of this reaction is based on the parent not wanting or<br/>
knowing how to be humble him/herself, especially if they are invested in<br/>
their child&#39;s &quot;achievements&quot; for their own sense of self.<br/>
