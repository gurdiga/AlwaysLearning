day care center. I was getting ready to leave to have Julian, and was helping <br/>
to hire my replacement.  We got some awful applicants, but the one that stuck <br/>
in my mind was a woman who said that she&#39;d never worked with young children <br/>
before, but she&#39;d worked with adults with retardation, and it was more or <br/>
less the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Not only did we NOT want to hire her to be with the kids, but we also wanted <br/>
to make sure she was never hired to work with disabled adults.<br/>
