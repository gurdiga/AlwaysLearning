<div id="ygrps-yiv-1546445151">My oldest daughter (14) wants to hang out with &quot;cool&quot; teens virtually <br/>
every night. We&#39;ve come up with a couple of ways to help her do that, <br/>
but I&#39;m hoping you all can provide some more.<br/>
<br/>
Our ideas:<br/>
1) We&#39;ve started a local group for unschooled teens: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://teenunschoolers.blogspot.com">http://teenunschoolers.blogspot.com</a><br/>
2) She has a cousin who starts at the high school next fall, so she&#39;s <br/>
going to tag along to games and other events, hoping to make contact <br/>
with the cool people at school.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate any ideas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1711355714">My teens find friends mostly by being involved in specific activities  <br/>
that they loved. Roxana does musical theater and Rosie plays soccer  <br/>
and does karate - those are the source of their social life. When  <br/>
they meet kids at these activities, they make other plans to do  <br/>
things with them. Also, a lot of their plans are made through MySpace  <br/>
- kids send out bulletins announcing various activities/get-togehers  <br/>
to the other kids on their &quot;Friends&quot; list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281102434">We had a park day playgroup when my kids were younger, up until about  <br/>
when Kirby was 13.  It started as a La Leche League group, and as  <br/>
most of those kids went to school, became an unschooling group.    <br/>
They still know some of those families.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby started working at a gaming shop when he was 14, but had been  <br/>
doing role playing games and collectible card games before that (and  <br/>
during, and after) and lots of their current friends came from those  <br/>
days.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby went to work at a pizza place he picked up more friends  <br/>
(and got that job through gaming friends in the first place).<br/>
<br/>
Marty worked two jobs and picked up zero friends. &lt;g&gt;  The people he  <br/>
worked with liked him, but it didn&#39;t lead to hanging out with any  <br/>
other young co-workers.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Holly freely acknowledge and appreciate the fact that Kirby  <br/>
can make friends easily and has enough that there&#39;s spillover, and  <br/>
they all hang out with the same growing group, in various combinations.<br/>
<br/>
So that took years, the stability of their current group of friends,  <br/>
but it involved hobbies and gaming and social situations that grew  <br/>
from that (going out to IHOP after the gaming shop closed, going to  <br/>
Frontier Restaurant after they go to one of the kids&#39; dance recitals  <br/>
or plays or whatever...<br/>

their real names and connect to others through various activities  <br/>
they&#39;ve been involved with so, for instance, she can click on  <br/>
Medfield HS Cross Country Team and find all the people on the team  <br/>
who are on Facebook. And they can add their own connections.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s the same social stuff as on MySpace but it must have been  <br/>
designed by an engineer. All the organization is so cool :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1734860404">I like all the ideas so far.  I have to say that the biggest hurdle <br/>
that we&#39;ve had isn&#39;t so much the kids we meet and the desire to get <br/>
together, it&#39;s the parents.  Perhaps it&#39;s just where we live, not <br/>
sure, but it seems like all these neat kids we meet at homeschool <br/>
park day or the neighborhood, all have parents that greatly restrict <br/>
their kids&#39; time outside of the home.<br/>
<br/>
So, for instance, just going to the mall with a few friends is such <br/>
an intense negotiation with all the parents of these kids that <br/>
Chamille wants to invite.  They want down to the minute time slots <br/>
(and if I&#39;m late by 5 min, the child is grounded), one parent may <br/>
decide that the mall we&#39;ve picked isn&#39;t ok, or one kid has to be home <br/>
at 2, even though they have nothing going on, when all the other kids <br/>
can be there until 4, and some parents insist that I physically stay <br/>
at the mall to have check-ins with the kids, cell phones aren&#39;t good <br/>
enough.  It&#39;s tiring!  I do it, I jump through all those hoops, even <br/>
when they seem absurd to me, just because it means so much to <br/>
Chamille.  However, I&#39;m the only one doing the driving, and putting <br/>
in the time to do stuff so the kids can hang out and be kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same thing going on bike rides in the neighborhood.  All the <br/>
parents want their teens supervised at all times, so I go, for <br/>
Chamille because they are all unwilling to do it and just expect <br/>
their kids to stay home or ride their bikes in circles in the cul-de-<br/>
sac.  Yes, teenagers can&#39;t ride their bikes outside of the cul-de-<br/>
sac.  It&#39;s crazy!  Let&#39;s not even mention the 7-11 2 blks away, or <br/>
the swimming pool 3 blks away!  Here I was thinking how cool it would <br/>
be to live so close to a beautiful greenway with paths and trails, a <br/>
swimming pool and a convenience store.  How cool that would be for a <br/>
kid to go and explore.  Well it is cool and Chamille gets to go and <br/>
do that stuff, I just have to tag along.  It&#39;s a good thing she likes <br/>
me!<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t remember doing this kind of stuff when I was a kid.  <br/>
When we wanted to get together and go to the mall, one of the parents <br/>
would take us and drop us off, or we&#39;d take the bus.  We could <br/>
usually spend many hours there and then have to be home by dinner <br/>
time or whatever.  When I wanted to go get candy from the store, I <br/>
would hop on my bike and ride for a mile and be gone for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Is it just me, or have parents become a lot more restrictive with <br/>
their children&#39;s lives?  It is soooo hard to find times for Chamille <br/>
to hang out with friends because they are so busy or their parents <br/>
are just too weird.<br/>
<br/>
We keep trying to find more homeschool friends, but it takes so much <br/>
time!  I just keep plugging away at finding opportunities to meet <br/>
other teens.  I figure if I stopped trying, nothing would happen, and <br/>
even if I keep trying and nothing happens, at least we&#39;ve done some <br/>
fun stuff while trying!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny, I&#39;ve tried to keep in mind finding others that have <br/>
similar interests by doing those activities.  Right now, Chamille&#39;s <br/>
interests ARE meeting other kids, especially ones that like anime or <br/>
emo screamo music or wearing all black and looking cool.  However, <br/>
Chamille is an open minded individual and likes lots of different <br/>
people.</div>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what we tried first.  She went to an anime club at the library <br/>
and was disgusted with the way the kids treated each other and the way <br/>
the librarian volunteer handled it.  Other anime clubs we found were <br/>
all old men.  I&#39;ve tried making our own, but no responses.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has a really big network of similarly minded friends, but none <br/>
of them live anywhere near us.  We really struggle with finding like <br/>
minded individuals in our area.<br/>
<br/>
Keep the ideas coming though, because there has got to be something I <br/>
haven&#39;t tried yet!<br/>
<br/>
Well, like the kids music night.  Is there such a thing?  I will look <br/>
around for something like that.  There are all ages night clubs that <br/>
play music, but again it&#39;s the not wanting to go by herself and having <br/>
to find someone who&#39;s parents would allow something like that.  She <br/>
does like doing stuff with me, but it&#39;s just not the same as going with <br/>
a group of kids.  It&#39;s a sort of a catchy situation of wanting to find <br/>
friends but needing at least one already to find more.  She&#39;s really <br/>
shy by herself.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1052632196">A mom created a group just for teens in our area several years ago. <br/>
They do lots of activities together and have hang out days.  <br/>
<br/>
Typical month would be like this.<br/>
<br/>
There is a movie Friday.....where they all meet at one house, and it<br/>
varies from month to month and watch a movie....could be a documentary<br/>
or something fun...depends on who is showing the movie.<br/>
<br/>
There is ice skating a few times a year.<br/>
<br/>
Field trips geared just for teens..<br/>
<br/>
Ball room dancing every Thursday afternoon...Their lessons were very<br/>
easy on the wallet.......$5 weekly<br/>
<br/>
Drama every other Wednesday with a play at the end of the year....Lots<br/>
of fun there...my 15 year old was Santa in a very contemporary 10<br/>
minute 2 person play....<br/>
<br/>
One family hosted a all night movie fest at their home......co-ed<br/>
sleep over....It was great the teens were very mature and respectful.<br/>
<br/>
I hosted a Smore&#39;s Party at Halloween and they all had a great time<br/>
roasting marshmallows, and wearing costumes, playing silly games.<br/>
<br/>
One family hosted a corn maze tour....That was fun....they had a map<br/>
and had to use the map to get through a maze of corn.  They had a<br/>
blast.....<br/>
<br/>
They are very socialized in our area.  <br/>
<br/>
We live in a very rural area where there are not many homeschoolers so<br/>
we have to travel to anything they do.  But as I have encountered,<br/>
parents of homeschoolers will go TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH for their<br/>
children! :) I know I would!!!<br/>

fun music, and caters to the 10 - 15 yo crowd.  My kid has a blast  <br/>
there, and if she goes alone, usually finds someone to skate and have  <br/>
fun with.<br/>
