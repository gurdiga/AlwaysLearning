<div id="ygrps-yiv-703349465">A nice homeschooling mom is being harrassed because she invited me to speak <br/>
at a conference one state from where I live.  Those harrassing her are MANY <br/>
states away and weren&#39;t considering going to her conference anyway.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not right, but it happened.<br/>
<br/>
Now on a mailing list I had never heard of, someone has told a lie about me <br/>
and about THIS list.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not right, but it happened.<br/>
<br/>
I do not want this list to turn into a discussion of other lists.  That would <br/>
be a drag.  But I don&#39;t want this list providing fodder for lies for other <br/>
lists either.  That I can&#39;t control, but I can put forth the truth.  Holly <br/>
Furgason has been harrassed because another list or two has a very few people <br/>
who enjoy badmouthing me and wanting to &quot;get at&quot; me.  It&#39;s immature and <br/>
probably bordering on actionable by now.  I would like for it to stop.  If <br/>
anyone has ideas for a simple solution, please e-mail me on the side at <br/>
SandraDodd.com.  <br/>
<br/>
Below is the false report and then a letter which was mailed this morning <br/>
which can be quoted on any list people want to send it to.  I&#39;m tired of <br/>
being lied about.  If any of you are on lists where I&#39;m being badmouthed, <br/>
please ask the people to live their own lives and give their own best advice.<br/>

&gt; According to Sandra and which she has posted on her list, you did indeed<br/>
&gt; contact her and forward the letter.  Just a snip she posted from your e-mail<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;There&#39;s national movement to boycott my conference because of you.  I am<br/>
&gt; hearing a lot of good stuff about you too though.&gt;&gt;<br/>

Except for replacing DJ Brewer&#39;s business mail address with her personal one <br/>
at her request, this is untouched.  It is addressed to conference <br/>
coordinators, liasons, and those quoted and affected and was mailed because I <br/>
was sent a copy of Sarah&#39;s letter below.<br/>

<br/>
For the record, Holly Furgason neither sent me a copy of the letter NOR did <br/>
she tell me who wrote it.  She only told me that there was threat of a <br/>
national boycott, with no names.  These words exactly:  &quot; There&#39;s national <br/>
movement to boycott my conference because of you.  I am hearing a lot of good <br/>
stuff about you too<br/>
though.&quot;  I assumed wrongly that it had been Lynda until I saw a copy of what <br/>
had been posted to the unschooling families list.   It was shown to me by <br/>
other people, but MANY people have seen it.  As far as I know, Holly didn&#39;t <br/>
send it out to anyone.<br/>
<br/>
I was sent a copy of DJ Brewer&#39;s letter.  It was not hateful.  I&#39;ve included <br/>
it below for those who did not see it.  DJ knows me personally, and lives in <br/>
Houston.   For expressing her opinion directly to the one threatening <br/>
boycott, she has been falsely and cruelly depicted IN PUBLIC in the post <br/>
below.<br/>

With all the commotion over the boycott letter I sent to Holly (which she <br/>
forwarded to Sandra and apparently every Texas homeschooler she <br/>
knows...DJBrewer, Tanya, etc.), I&#39;m getting hateful mail from every fan of SD <br/>
on the planet. Rather than stick around and read these poslindly follow those <br/>
types as if they have a ring in their noses, WAITING to be led around. There <br/>
are way too many people supporting her to try to effect a change with just a <br/>
few of us willing to stick our necks out and speak up. So many people who <br/>
disagree with her and her tactics (and there ARE quite a few) would rather <br/>
just leave and go about unschooling solo.... forget about trying to help new <br/>
people to unschooling; forget about trying to create a movement that <br/>
represents ALL our voices, not just the loudest.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I guess these silent people have the right idea by just dropping out of <br/>
the picture because sticking my neck out hasn&#39;t done a bit of good. <br/>
<br/>
Wishing you all the best and lotsa luck in your endeavors~<br/>

DJ&#39;s letter to Sarah:<br/>

Subj:   howdy fellow homeschooler<br/>
Date:   Tuesday, July 23, 2002 12:19:13 AM<br/>
From:   [DJ of <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Texas@...">Texas@...</a>]<br/>
To:     <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Sarah,<br/>
Howdy.  I am a homeschooling mother of four in the Houston area.  I am<br/>
planning to attend the conference you were metioning, and I was very<br/>
surprised at your letter&#39;s description of Sandra Dodd. (it was sent to<br/>
me by another homeschooling friend who is attending the conference)<br/>
<br/>
I know Sandra Dodd personally, and have never found her to have an &quot;in<br/>
your face&quot; &quot;slap you upside the head&quot; approach at all.<br/>
<br/>
Did ya&#39;ll have some kind of run in or something?<br/>
<br/>
I personally was offended by you telling people that they should  not<br/>
attend -- it makes you sound like some sort of censor to what should or<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be done or learned or something.<br/>
<br/>
I have a sister in Lubbock.  I dont see how a trip there would in any<br/>
way facilitate a trip to Houston.  I am a 12 hour drive away from my<br/>
sister.  Of course, one could fly from Lubbock to Houston, but<br/>
thankfully, you wont need to.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry to have to say this, but I found your letter  nothing more<br/>
than a thinly veiled attempt to loose some vitriolic diatribe against a<br/>
very decent person.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, its fine if you dont like someone, but why use your own personal<br/>
<br/>
prejudice and foist it upon others, just because you dont like a<br/>
particular speaker&#39;s method.  Why not let others find out for<br/>
themselves.  If Sandra is truly as bad as you say, let her hang herself<br/>
with her own rope.  There is no need for you to waste time or energy on<br/>
such an endevor.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you have a wonderful homeschooling life.  Please allow others to<br/>
do so always.  Let&#39;s not block the path of learning with petty<br/>
personality differences.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely<br/>
DJ Brewer</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92116232">The mind just boggles at all of this.  Don&#39;t these people have anything<br/>
better to do with their time (like hang out with their kids!)?  It&#39;s so<br/>
incredibly petty and small minded.  Obviously, they&#39;re not big on letting go<br/>
of past resentments and getting on with their lives &lt;sarky grin&gt;.<br/>
Personally, I&#39;m so looking forward to meeting you in Sacramento!!  I can&#39;t<br/>
wait!  I&#39;m also looking forward to meeting some of you other list mates.<br/>
