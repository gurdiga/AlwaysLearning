<div id="ygrps-yiv-97889391">I moved back to CA (where I grew up) from England last<br/>
year (where I lived for 12 years). My dialect is still<br/>
peppered with Englishisms (I know that&#39;s not a word,<br/>
but couldn&#39;t think of another way to describe it &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
I constantly get people asking me where I&#39;m from and<br/>
Tamzin always gets asked to &#39;say something English&#39;<br/>
(LOL! We still don&#39;t know what to make of that one!).<br/>
The other day Tamzin&#39;s friend said to her mom that she<br/>
wants to learn how to speak English like Tamzin. Her<br/>
mom said, &quot;You do speak English&quot;. To which Sarah<br/>
replied, &quot;No I don&#39;t. I speak American&quot; (she&#39;s 5 & 1/2<br/>
and oh so wise!).<br/>
<br/>
Meghan<br/>
 <br/>
who still says BAA-zil (basil) and oRAY-gone-o<br/>
(oregano), as well as, chips, crisps, ice lollies,<br/>
biscuits, beef burgers (much more sensible IMO), etc.,<br/>
etc.<br/>
<br/>
I see there are some others in Northern Ca. I&#39;m up in<br/>
Paradise (I just love saying that &lt;bg&gt;), near Chico.<br/>
Any of you near here?<br/>
