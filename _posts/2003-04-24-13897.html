 But while we&#39;re on the subject - how old do you think a child should be <br/>
before being left alone.? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When they&#39;re comfortable with the idea and know how to handle themselves in <br/>
an emergency. Trevor was ready around 9 and 10 (for very short periods of <br/>
maybe 1/2 hour), and at 11 started babysitting his siblings for short periods <br/>
of time.<br/>
He is 13 now and watches them for longer periods, he likes getting paid.<br/>
<br/>
Jared likes being home alone at 9, if he didn&#39;t want to I wouldn&#39;t ever leave <br/>
him. But he likes it.  I let them decide when they&#39;re ready, and I consider <br/>
all the things they may have to deal with and prepare them for it.<br/>
Mainly, &quot;get to Wade and James house if there&#39;s an emergency&quot; is the big <br/>
instruction here. (our neighbors two doors down)<br/>

&quot;They dined on mince, and slices of quince, Which they ate with a runcible <br/>
spoon;<br/>
And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the <br/>
moon.&quot;<br/>
