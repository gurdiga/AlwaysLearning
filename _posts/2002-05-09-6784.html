&gt; I like to believe that if someone cares enough to ask about unschooling, <br/>
&gt; they have the ability to learn and grow and develop the awareness to do it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there are parents who like their kids okay - but have really specific <br/>
ways they want them to grow and unschooling will make it too obvious that <br/>
they can&#39;t &quot;train&quot; them so they may like the idea but they&#39;ll never be <br/>
comfortable. I think there are people who don&#39;t want to develop new interests <br/>
and look at the world as a huge giant museum and think that hard about what <br/>
might interest their kids and always be supportive of the kids&#39; interests <br/>
even when they don&#39;t look like standard academic stuff. I think there are <br/>
people who can&#39;t overcome their own negativity and cynicism and negativity <br/>
are not compatible with unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
I think that the &quot;idea&quot; of unschooling can appeal to those people, but that <br/>
they will never be happily joyfully able to do it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>But - don&#39;t you realize that while you were doing that experiment something <br/>
else was missed? There is ALWAYS something else they&#39;d be doing if you hadn&#39;t <br/>
made them do what you wanted them to do. Inertia would have come up some <br/>
other time, some other place. My kids probably know more interesting things <br/>
to say about it than I do &lt;G&gt;. I never planned an &quot;inertia&quot; experiment for <br/>
them, to make sure they knew about it. I took them to science museums though. <br/>
But even THERE I didn&#39;t make sure they learned about inertia. They could have <br/>
gone to the same science museum 20 times and ignored that topic altogether <br/>
because they were busy with other stuff. EVEN THEN it would have come up <br/>
someplace else. For sure. Some time. MAYBE NOT UNTIL THEY ARE 20 years old, <br/>
though. No guarantees that there won&#39;t be &quot;gaps.&quot; I&#39;m just not all that <br/>
worried about gaps. EVERYBODY has them - it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
