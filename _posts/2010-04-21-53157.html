<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758788298">hello, i found that with my young one(two) we stopped with pjs for a while<br/>
and just had her pick a new outfit to wear especially if we had an early<br/>
morning the next day.  She found it fun also to &quot;picnic&quot; in the car for<br/>
breakfast. I had a few foods easily consumed in the car and let her make<br/>
some choices from them. She thought it was fun:) and it saved us a half hour<br/>
when we needed to get somewhere like an apt. that did not allow us the<br/>
flexibility of time. Just a few ideas that have worked for us.<br/>
