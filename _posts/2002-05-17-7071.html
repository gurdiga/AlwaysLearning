<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474880355">Dd found the concept of this word this morning but she does not<br/>
the word yet know.<br/>
<br/>
Still in bed, this morning, dd asked for my hand and wrote in it;<br/>
AYA, and asked me  why she could not just  write her name as AY.<br/>
I made the sound of Y followed by Ye, yi, yo, yu and lastly<br/>
pronounced &quot;ya&quot;. Then I pronounced &quot;ay&quot; and &quot;aya&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Later, around 10.30AM I sat on the kitchen table, the place I sit<br/>
when I want to read or write, to see if she would quiet down and<br/>
do some Japanese Kanji or Portuguese.<br/>
<br/>
I sat and I wrote a message for D.  Dd asked me what I was doing<br/>
and as soon as she found out that I was writing a message to send<br/>
to D. and D&#39;s mother in USA, she run to write a message to D.<br/>
too. She wrote in Japanese and I translated it to English as  D.<br/>
might find dd &quot;hiragana and katakana&quot; too twisted to understand.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprized to see her writing &quot;katakanas&quot;.  I knew she could<br/>
copy them down, but I did not know she knew how to write in it.<br/>
She had signed her name in roman alphabet.<br/>
<br/>
This afternoon she gave me a card.  It said &quot;ai no mirumo de<br/>
pon&quot;.  &quot;ai&quot; written in roman alphabet and the rest in &quot;hiragana&quot;<br/>
(in the Japanese ps, they first teach this system of writing ).<br/>
&quot;ai&quot; means love in Japanese.  &quot;mirumo the pon&quot; is one the newest<br/>
comic book character dd is in love with.  The above frase means,<br/>
love from mirumo de pon. She could have written it all in<br/>
hiragana. But I feel that she wrote &quot;ai&quot; in roman alphabet to<br/>
please me.  Or to imitate me.  I rarely write in Japanese.<br/>
<br/>
I will date the card and keep it.  It is a landmark for me, for<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
I am now looking forward to the day that I can report that dd is<br/>
reading Portuguese.  I can hardly wait to see the lights of<br/>
delight in her words when she starts applying this new acquired<br/>
concept of syllable.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I went to dictionary two times before beginning this post. I<br/>
wanted to write &quot;syllable&quot; in the subject line of the post and<br/>
did not know how to spell it.  Looked for silabu, then went to<br/>
sillabu, then I remembered that I had seem it with &quot;y&quot;.   When I<br/>
tried to type it down I could not spell the end of the word.  Had<br/>
to open the dic. again.<br/>
<br/>
At least once a day I have to open the Eng. dic.  I should<br/>
consider upgrading my OS fm Win &#39;95 to 2000 and buy MS word 2000<br/>
that is said that has the thesaurus and spelling check in it.<br/>
But before that it might be wiser to look and see if MS outlook<br/>
fm MS Explorer 4.0 has a way to be configured so that I could use<br/>
Microsoft word 4.0 as its word processor software. At least it<br/>
has the spelling checker.<br/>
.............<br/>
It was in yesterday newspaper &quot;Asahi Shinbun&quot; one of the biggest<br/>
national newspaper of Japan that many families are choosing to<br/>
birth away fm the hospital.  These families are choosing to birth<br/>
at home with the assistance of midwives.  A friend of mine gave<br/>
birth to her now 10 yo with the assistance of a midwife.<br/>
Birthing at home is not prohibited by law neither here or in<br/>
Brazil.  It is only that the it is not popular with the MDs.<br/>
They want bithing in hospitals and preferably in the appointed<br/>
hours.  True, specially in Brazil, maybe the country that does<br/>
cesarean section the most.  (had to look up for the spelling of<br/>
cesarean.)<br/>
....................<br/>
love and peace.  noemi, unschooling fm raining Tokyo.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1877733459">Noemi, I just wanted to give you a belated welcome and let you know that I<br/>
love your posts! It&#39;s fascinating to get a glimpse into your life. I&#39;ve been<br/>
trying to explain the concept of syllables to my son and it&#39;s harder than I<br/>
thought. And really, once you understand the concept, why do you have to<br/>
know where to divide the word? (Unless you&#39;re writing songs for our hymnbook<br/>
in church, other than that I can&#39;t imagine!)<br/>
<br/>
The other thing I&#39;m working on is helping him distinguish between singing<br/>
and rap. To my astonishment (he just turned 11) he thought they were the<br/>
same thing. Now when a song comes on he can tell, although I think he&#39;s<br/>
using the trick of whether I like it or not (if I don&#39;t, it must be rap...)<br/>
Again, I had a hard time verbalizing what the difference is. Rap is talking<br/>
in rhythm to music, it usually rhymes, and singing is, um, singing. It<br/>
rhymes, it&#39;s in rhythm, but how do you express the difference? I told him it<br/>
follows the melody. He pointed out that rap does too. He finally said that<br/>
the syllables were held longer in singing and understood that. I still feel<br/>
something&#39;s missing but it&#39;s tough to define! He hears melody in drumming,<br/>
though, and I don&#39;t, so it may be a perceptual difference and I&#39;m the one<br/>
who&#39;s less perceptive!<br/>

With word processors it&#39;s not nearly as necessary.  We used to have to know <br/>
where to hyphenate, when typing.  Especially when justifying margins (by <br/>
hand, counting half-spaces, an archaic art I&#39;m glad to see go!!).<br/>
<br/>
It helps sometimes to be able to separate syllables to split the word out <br/>
into its meaningful parts (to figure out what a long word means), but the <br/>
hyphenation of words follows what will make it pronounceable for a reader, <br/>
not what its linguistic parts are.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m babbling, but as one who does kinda like to dissect words and sentences, <br/>
I know why *I* would like to know, but I agree that most people don&#39;t need to <br/>
know.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think rap has a very distinct beat (dada da DA) that is unique in itself.<br/>
Rap is very distinguishable from rock, jazz, country, soul, classical, etc..<br/>
Maybe you could have a variety of music to play all at once (one at a time)<br/>
and point out the differences.<br/>
Also, don&#39;t rap &quot;singers&quot; usually &quot;talk&quot; the lyrics instead of singing them<br/>
melodically?<br/>
That&#39;s the main difference that I think of.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619902923">Oh, I&#39;d forgotten about justifying margins by hand. What lovely memories...<br/>
not!<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean by your last sentence. I want to learn Spanish. There&#39;s<br/>
a free class (except for the book) offered at my church, so I&#39;ve gone twice<br/>
now. After last night, that&#39;s it. The teacher can&#39;t stand being interrupted<br/>
by questions. I&#39;m visual, so I have to know how to spell a word before I can<br/>
internalize it. I kept asking about grammar and verb tense when the others<br/>
were working on Como esta usted. I think I saw little wisps of steam coming<br/>
out her ears when I asked how about the inflection on a sentence. Apparently<br/>
her agenda doesn&#39;t include real students! So I&#39;ll continue to unschool<br/>
myself as I have so far, much more happily!<br/>

drumming.  Maybe that&#39;s why I&#39;m one of the few people I know at <br/>
my age who likes rave and rap music.  There&#39;s a song called <br/>
Phat Planet by Leftfield (they used it in a guiness advert in the <br/>
UK) that I find incredibly melodic and beautiful, and it&#39;s mostly <br/>
drumming.  Your son may like that one, although it&#39;s not rap, but <br/>
rave music.<br/>
