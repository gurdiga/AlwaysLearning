<div id="ygrps-yiv-529805270">I posted this at unschooling.com too.  Sorry for the doubles for some of you, <br/>

<br/>
An SCA guy in North Carolina has written up something about the benefits of <br/>
the SCA for his homeschooled kids.<br/>
<br/>
Home Schooling<br/>
<br/>
Here at St. Columban&#39;s College Preparatory Academy, we have been treating the <br/>
SCA as a big unit study, integrating books and art and dress-up on medieval <br/>
themes, Arthurian and Celtic legends, etc.  <br/>
But, unit studies are not meant to go on for years.   My wife and I were <br/>
talking and we realized we had no clear idea of what we wanted from the SCA <br/>
when it came to home schooling. So we wrote out this mission statement for <br/>
using &quot;living history&quot; in our home school.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.charlesfleming-sca.com/">http://www.charlesfleming-sca.com/</a> (and when you get there and click on <br/>
&quot;mission statement&quot; you get his long details about the benefits of the SCA, <br/>
and it mentions unschooling.<br/>

I&#39;m wondering if you knew Jay and Sonia Handel through your SCA <br/>
activities.  They were apparently quite active (at least he was) in SCA <br/>
activities when they lived near Victoria.  He has just been charged with <br/>
murdering their 6 kids in a fire.  They were separated.  The reason I heard <br/>
about it is that until very recently the older kids had been homeschooled.<br/>

WOW!  No, sorry.  That would be An Tir, and I don&#39;t know a single soul from <br/>
An Tir.  I&#39;ve met a couple, and two moved from New Mexico to there years ago, <br/>
but I&#39;m not in contact with them.<br/>
<br/>
How awful about the fire.  Yuck!!<br/>
