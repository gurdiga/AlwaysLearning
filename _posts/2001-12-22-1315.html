<div id="ygrps-yiv-1215392212">Epiphany is the last day of the 12 days of Christmas.  It commemorates the <br/>
visit of the three wise men to Jesus.  In the persons of the Magi, who were <br/>
not Jews, Jesus was manifested to all the nations of the Earth.  Epiphany <br/>
means &quot;manifestation&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Jesus wasn&#39;t baptised as a baby.  His cousin John (remember John the <br/>
Baptist?) baptised him as an adult.  I think Theophany does refer to Jesus&#39; <br/>
baptism, but it didn&#39;t happen when he was a baby, and it&#39;s not the same as <br/>
the Epiphany. He was circumcised, as all Jewish baby boys are, when he was 8 <br/>
days old. Maybe that&#39;s where the confusion comes in. <br/>
<br/>
After Jesus was baptised he went into the desert where he fasted for forty <br/>
days.  Lent is the season which commemorates this event.  Ash Wednesday is <br/>
the first day of Lent.  The day before Ash Wednesday is Mardi Gras (Fat <br/>
Tuesday in French).  Mardi Gras is only one day long.  Carnival is a <br/>
different story. The Lenten season lasts from Ash Wednesday until midnight of <br/>
Holy Saturday (the day before Easter).  It is 46 days long because Sundays <br/>
are not counted when adding up the 40 days.  It seems that Lent always begins <br/>
sometime in February.<br/>
