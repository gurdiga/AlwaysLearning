<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058991112">Hi~ I&#39; feeling very uneasy about the fact that my son is 11 and does <br/>

we talk about all the options and he still just says he does not want <br/>

World of Warcraft for example, but he does and has for many years. I <br/>
know he is smart and have always believed he will just one day be <br/>
reading...like all the stories I have read. Yet here I am worried, I <br/>
have started to write this e-mail more than once over the last few <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679299669">Ok I am coming out of hiding. I have only been unschooling a very short time but have been relaxed schooling a very long time. My children range in age from 4 through 28. I have had one read at 12 and one at one week short of thirteen and currently have a 12 yr old not reading. AND NOT interested in it. I also have had several read at 4 and at 5 and at 8..<br/>
There is a point when they start to read.. it happens.. Just be there to read for him till then.. I will even offer reading lessons to them.. and graciously accept a no or a maybe later or a reluctant OK. <br/>
<br/>
Each child is different and each child will learn to read. If they are not made to feel bad they will never know it is a problem. I will also reassure you that all of my children-- even the one who was PS till 12 and then learned to read despit it-- eventually came to a point where you couldn&#39;t tell which ones read at 4 and which ones read at 13.<br/>

Kat didn&#39;t read on her own, as in pick up a novel and read it to  <br/>
herself, until she was ... I don&#39;t even know now. 13?<br/>
<br/>
She could read. She chose not to because it was hard for her. She did  <br/>
the reading for video games but I read books to her.<br/>
<br/>
She wanted to read easily. And we did take her for some tests but the  <br/>
conclusion was she couldn&#39;t read easily because she didn&#39;t read  <br/>
enough. Kind of a Catch-22.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, through audio books, she found an adult author she loved  <br/>
and did finally read those. So they gave her a reason to read more  <br/>
and reading became easier.<br/>

Holly said just the other day that she likes to read books when she&#39;s  <br/>
already seen the movie.  She&#39;s read Snow Angels a couple of times,  <br/>
and some Stephen King stuff, What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape, and I&#39;m not  <br/>
sure what else.  She&#39;s not reading summaries of movies (as some kids  <br/>
do in school for &quot;book reports,&quot; but the stories or novels on which  <br/>
movies were based.<br/>
<br/>
She joked that she had no imagination and wanted their pictures in  <br/>
her head or something.  Her imagination is plenty healthy.  I think  <br/>
she likes to think about what makes a book interesting enough for  <br/>
someone to make a movie, and what parts and sorts of writing aren&#39;t  <br/>
then written up and filmed.<br/>

when you already have some of the structure and you&#39;re filling it in  <br/>
rather than trying to build everything from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
My husband hates seeing previews to movies and shows. I like them.  <br/>
And I think I like them because it gives me the beginning of a  <br/>

Yes, we have alot of game guides and he enjoys figuring out things on <br/>
his own with pics and such as much as possible. I also read to him <br/>
when asked :-)<br/>
Usually if he brings up the fact that he can&#39;t read and would like to <br/>
be able to I give him all the options...continueing on the way we are <br/>
going now and reassure him that he will learn to read, I even tell <br/>
him about all the other unschoolers who have learned to read at 13 or <br/>
14.I let him know that there are diffrent learn to read programs out <br/>
there, online and other wise. So, yes that is in the form of reading <br/>
lessons and when we first started &quot;homeschooling&quot; we did the 100 <br/>
lessons book and he did pretty well for awhile but as soon as he got <br/>
bored and did&#39;nt want to do it we stopped. That was like 5 years <br/>
ago.Do you think even offering &quot;lessons&quot; is bad as an unschooler?&lt;&lt;&lt;I <br/>
*really* would like to know your thoughts on this. I hesitate <br/>
everytime it starts to roll off my tounge and have only brought that <br/>
up maybe 2 or 3 times over the years.<br/>
Thanks for your input...I already feel better! ~Tracy<br/>

offer :-) (along with the freedom to play and mess around if that&#39;s  <br/>
what my daughter wanted.)<br/>
<br/>
The problem with reading lessons is the belief that lack of knowledge  <br/>
is the big obstacle between the child and reading. If that were true,  <br/>
then all kids in school would be reading.<br/>
<br/>
But if he is not developmentally ready to read -- meaning all the  <br/>
brain areas he needs to put it all together aren&#39;t mature yet -- then  <br/>
he really can&#39;t read. He&#39;s like a 6 mo old in terms of walking.  <br/>
Walking lessons won&#39;t help. He&#39;ll walk when he&#39;s developmentally  <br/>
ready to walk. And he&#39;ll read when he&#39;s developmentally ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re certain reading lessons will help and they don&#39;t, how will  <br/>
he feel? I think it&#39;s likely he&#39;ll feel he&#39;s dumb or there&#39;s  <br/>
something wrong with him.<br/>
<br/>
And if he ends up reading after reading lessons (because he was on  <br/>
the verge of reading), then it&#39;s possible he&#39;ll feel like you should  <br/>
have used them ages ago and be resentful.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not developmentally ready, reading lessons won&#39;t help. If he  <br/>
is developmentally ready, he&#39;s going to read anyway.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/r/deeper">http://sandradodd.com/r/deeper</a><br/>

If they think reading needs lessons, they&#39;ll think everything does.<br/>
If they learn to read without lessons, the confidence gained is  <br/>
immense (in the kids and parents too).<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve done when my kids ask a question about spelling or reading  <br/>
or grammar, I give the answer and then relate it to one more thing, if  <br/>
it&#39;s convenient.  It helps them to generalize it and to understand and  <br/>
remember it.   If someone says &quot;How do you spell &#39;cough&#39;?&quot; I might say  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235325560">Simon is 11, moving inexorably (I need to believe) toward 12.  He isn&#39;t among the literate, yet. It is becoming a part of who he is, but it isn&#39;t yet fully integrated. There is nothing I can do to stop or start the process that is already in motion. He is involved in a world with words. He is taking letters and recognizing them in sequences that are moving more often towards a correct interpretation of what they mean to be representing. Actually, that isn&#39;t true. I could pressure him. I could make him uncomfortable with words. I could tell him that he is being stubborn or stupid or lazy when it comes to reading. I could give him reading lessons, I could push phonics at him or whole word recognition. But I don&#39;t and there isn&#39;t a bone in his body that is resisting becoming literate. <br/>
<br/>
He isn&#39;t ready to read. Or, rather, he isn&#39;t ready to string words into sentences into books. He will be. I am not worried. I have been. I was when he was 4 and I needed him to validate my decision to homeschool. I was when Linnaea, his younger sister, started reading at 6 and he was 9 and I worried that it would hurt his ego, his sense of self, that she could read and that he couldn&#39;t and that it would be this story of how dumb he was. I was stunned to watch him come to her with words he didn&#39;t know. I was stunned to see how comfortable he was with who he was. I&#39;m 40 moving on toward 41 and I don&#39;t know that I have nearly as strong a sense of self. <br/>
<br/>
The fun thing, having an older not-yet-reader, is learning from him. He sees things I miss as I live in my fully literate world. He remembers details that I don&#39;t, he plays games with such skill, such ability, such a grasp for the non-reading clues and cues in so many different environments. It is amazing to see through his eyes. <br/>
<br/>
We lived in Japan for a year. A year when I was the illiterate. I speak and read almost no Japanese and I was relatively unhandicapped. Not because English was everywhere, but because it wasn&#39;t as hard as I think it ought to be, or thought it ought to be, to get along without being able to read. People helped us. If I lived in Japan today after 8 years of living there, I would be literate. I could pick the bus to get home without having to look at the note in my pocket, I could read the ingredients on a box of crackers, I could buy non-English language books from the bookstore and read them, and get the cultural references, or most of them. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what age the adults I know were when they learned to read. I don&#39;t know if they were older or younger than me, or than Simon. It doesn&#39;t come up in my interactions. And I&#39;m not worried. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Chamille learned to read at the age of 11/12.  It was seemingly<br/>
overnight, but it really wasn&#39;t.  It was years of word collecting.  She<br/>
had moments of self doubt before she was fluent.  Now she&#39;s incredibly<br/>
glad that she learned this on her own, in her own way.  She&#39;s a huge<br/>
advocate of non-coersive, no lesson, learning to read.<br/>
<br/>
Other kids have asked her how she learned to read without anyone<br/>
teaching her, and she says something like, &quot;I just learned it, the same<br/>
way I learn everything else.&quot;  What strikes me about it, is her clear<br/>
sense of ownership over it.  If I had gotten worried and implemented<br/>
some sort of reading lesson program she wouldn&#39;t have that wonderful<br/>
sense of ownership, that has spilled out into the whole rest of her<br/>
life.  The whole process was extremely empowering to her!<br/>
<br/>
Whenever kids learn new things they will come to a point of frustration<br/>
or some form of hurdle to be gone over.  It&#39;s the same for all people I<br/>
think, since I&#39;ve experienced this learning new crafts.  Once you get<br/>
over that hurdle, things start clicking and making sense.  During that<br/>
struggle though, sometimes the outcome may seem dire.  You could<br/>
potentially look at your son&#39;s current lack of reading as being in the<br/>
place of right before or during the hurdle to be gotten over, knowing<br/>
that it&#39;s temporary and will lead to a sense of accomplishment and<br/>
empowerment.</div>

loves to analyze them and compare them and pick them apart.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
really matter which she does first.  When she sees a really good movie,<br/>
she usually wonders if it was originally a book and looks into it. <br/>
She&#39;s found that often, the very best movies are the ones that were made<br/>
from books, and she finds that really fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
She was able to hold a very analytical intelligent conversation about<br/>
the movie Carrie in it&#39;s relation to the book, with another adult who<br/>
had seen the movie many times, but had never read the book.  I was<br/>
merely a bystander, as I truly had nothing to add!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971489941">Wow, I&#39;m so glad I opened up to talk about this. My beliefs have been <br/>
strengthened and my joy in unschooling renewed yet again :-) It&#39;s <br/>
interesting when you just go about living your life joyfully, no <br/>
longer reading the groups as much, no longer researching...time flies <br/>
by and all of a sudden I&#39;m like...wait...did I miss something <br/>
important. My first couple of years I was SO immersed in learning <br/>
about & talking about unschooling...now it is just our lives...how <br/>
wonderful! I&#39;m so glad I brought my worries here instead of <br/>
transfering them onto my son! I don&#39;t feel as though anything I have <br/>
done up until this point has harmed his sense of self which is <br/>
probably one of the main reasons I unschool in the first place! I <br/>
have not at all pressured him, just followed his lead and gave <br/>
information. I am glad to have your input about reading lessons, and <br/>
even more glad that I have not pressured him, again just responded to <br/>
him :-) <br/>
So, thanks again everyone who has contributed.<br/>

&gt; Do you think even offering &quot;lessons&quot; is bad as an unschooler?<br/>
<br/>
If they were ballet lessons or guitar lessons I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to <br/>
offer :-) (along with the freedom to play and mess around if that&#39;s <br/>
what my daughter wanted.)<br/>
<br/>
The problem with reading lessons is the belief that lack of knowledge <br/>
is the big obstacle between the child and reading. If that were true, <br/>
then all kids in school would be reading.<br/>
<br/>
But if he is not developmentally ready to read -- meaning all the <br/>
brain areas he needs to put it all together aren&#39;t mature yet -- then <br/>
he really can&#39;t read. He&#39;s like a 6 mo old in terms of walking. <br/>
Walking lessons won&#39;t help. He&#39;ll walk when he&#39;s developmentally <br/>
ready to walk. And he&#39;ll read when he&#39;s developmentally ready to read.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re certain reading lessons will help and they don&#39;t, how will <br/>
he feel? I think it&#39;s likely he&#39;ll feel he&#39;s dumb or there&#39;s <br/>
something wrong with him.<br/>
<br/>
And if he ends up reading after reading lessons (because he was on <br/>
the verge of reading), then it&#39;s possible he&#39;ll feel like you should <br/>
have used them ages ago and be resentful.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not developmentally ready, reading lessons won&#39;t help. If he <br/>
is developmentally ready, he&#39;s going to read anyway.<br/>

<br/>
It takes being read to. It takes immersion in a print rich  <br/>
environment. It takes pleasant experiences with the written word. It  <br/>
takes a personal need to read and things they want to read. It takes  <br/>
someone willing to answer questions.<br/>
<br/>
No one thing is key. Figuring out reading comes from a combination of  <br/>
many things.<br/>
<br/>
Illiterate adults either didn&#39;t have experience with reading, like  <br/>
immigrants or homes where the other members of the family don&#39;t read,  <br/>
or they were pressured to read before they were capable. That  <br/>
pressure to do what adults believe they can, when &quot;everyone&quot; else is  <br/>
doing it, can be demoralizing. To protect themselves they can give up  <br/>
and decide they&#39;re dumb so they expect the failure or decide reading  <br/>
is dumb so why bother.<br/>

Yes.  Whereas a fifth grader might be ashamed to ask for help from a  <br/>
second grader, my kids were never ANY-graders.<br/>

Marty and Kirby only read digital clocks for a long time.  For  <br/>
whatever reason, Holly learned analog first.  When they were out  <br/>
together one day, at a mall, the boys couldn&#39;t read the analog clock  <br/>
and Holly read it to them.  They didn&#39;t hesitate to ask her, and she  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-639461147">Hi tracy,<br/>
I havent been unschooling officially for much more than a year and a<br/>
half now (with my 5th dd who is 8.5yrs) but Im pretty sure that for<br/>
parenting we were in line, just our first 4 children have gone to<br/>
school (half days here in italy, tho--a big difference I expect from<br/>
the norm).<br/>
<br/>
What Ive come to notice is that learning to read is not much different<br/>
from weaning --it really is not a clean cut process.  Mainstream<br/>
culture tends to see weaning as something one decides to do to the<br/>
child (meaning stop breastfeeding and start feeding &quot;real&quot; food),<br/>
rather than seeing it as a slow, very slow process...the baby starts<br/>
to play and tast with food, if let to do so, for months and months<br/>
(years, lol).  My 3 year old is still nursing tons *and* eats<br/>
willingly, enthusiastically almost every day. If I were like most<br/>
mammas here in italy, Id be frantic that he &quot;wasnt eating&quot; but he is.<br/>
it just doesnt  look like how *i* eat.  <br/>
<br/>
What I have noticed is that reading, left alone, seems to be the same<br/>
thing.  A slow slow, very individual process...and that your llyr is<br/>
probably reading like my boy is eating, in his own way, how he likes<br/>
best when he feels like it, lol.  Naturally learning to read doesnt<br/>
look like &quot;real&quot; (as in mainstream) reading just as natural weaning<br/>
doesnt look like mainstream weaning.<br/>

<br/>
The above is a great synopsis comparing breastfeeding (and any other<br/>
attachment parenting we might be doing) with unschooling.  This is very much<br/>
how I see unschooling as an extension of the ways I&#39;ve practiced attachment<br/>
parenting, and in fact I see unschooling as another practice that continues<br/>
attachment between parent and child.  I&#39;m enjoying seeing what can be seen<br/>
of my child&#39;s progress and just enjoying my child.  That&#39;s a huge plus over<br/>
being relieved to be rid of what&#39;s often perceived as peskiness.  (Visiting<br/>
with my dad brings this into sharp focus, the fact that others see Karl as a<br/>
pesky childish nuisance rather than a interesting person who&#39;s interested in<br/>
others.  Gosh I so much prefer my own perception.  :D  )<br/>
<br/>
To many mainstream parents, me saying that unschooling is an extension of<br/>
attachment parenting may sound like I&#39;m a mama who can&#39;t &quot;cut the apron<br/>
strings&quot; and encourage my child to get independent within an appropriate<br/>
time frame.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, like Melissa says, I think children want independence much sooner<br/>
than the majority of parents want to see it, and that children want<br/>
independence not all at once but in that slow slow process of integration<br/>
over a period of years, during the entire time they live with their parents,<br/>
when and as they feel like it.  In what looks to many like &quot;slow&quot; or &quot;no&quot;<br/>
progress.  It&#39;s why unschooling is so friendly for all children regardless<br/>
of what categories the children fall into in the school environment, whether<br/>
overall they&#39;re perceived as slow, fast, or average.<br/>
<br/>
No wonder the kids gain confidence in who they are.  They never feel<br/>
pressured to pretend otherwise.<br/>
