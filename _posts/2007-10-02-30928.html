<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566047195">Kelly Lovejoy wrote something elegantly ambiguous:<br/>
  ========================<br/>
   <br/>
  Children are NOT learning when they are hungry, when they are full,<br/>
when they are tired, when they are rested, or when they are in need of<br/>
exercise.<br/>
<br/>
Because of *school*.<br/>
  ========================<br/>
   <br/>
  This says two different things, and both are absolutely crucial for unschooling parents to know.<br/>
   <br/>
  When a child is hungry or tired or in need of exercise, he cannot learn.<br/>
  Learning doesn&#39;t work when a child&#39;s basic needs haven&#39;t been met.<br/>
   <br/>
  And probably what Kelly meant to say and most teachers don&#39;t even know is possible is that if school with its schedules and rules and deprivations and requirements keeps children from ever being able to learn to feel their own natural needs and bodily rhythms, a child cannot learn to know when he&#39;s hungry or full, or tired or rested, or in need of exercise.<br/>
   <br/>
   <br/>
  And  what Kelly didn&#39;t say but I will is that most parents  don&#39;t even know that it is possible for children to learn those things.<br/>
   <br/>
  If a rules-bound home with its schedules and rules and deprivations and requirements keeps children from ever being able to learn to feel their own natural needs and bodily rhythms, a child cannot learn to know when he&#39;s hungry or full, or tired or rested, or in need of exercise.<br/>
