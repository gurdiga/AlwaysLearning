<div id="ygrps-yiv-170948570">There is hacktivist group called YESMEN that has successfully created <br/>
a WTO.ORG website that many people around the world believe is the <br/>
true World Trade Organization&#39;s official site. When I saw this <br/>
webpage at ANTIWAR.COM, I thought it was another hoax by the YesMen <br/>
but, lo and behold, it is not.<br/>
<br/>
The following is an actual GI JOE play set being sold by JC PENNEY&#39;S, <br/>
ETOYS (I thought they were dead!) and KBTOYS. It looks like TOYS &#39;R <br/>
US/AMAZON is not selling it (I checked and there is something with <br/>
similar wording but no image to identify it).<br/>
<br/>
Just one word --UNBELIEVABLE!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-779391558">I&#39;m wondering why this toy is considered offensive? Or more offensive than a <br/>
regular GI Joe?<br/>
<br/>
Modern warfare is street warfare, city warfare, house to house and building <br/>
to building.  This is exactly the face of war from the front page of the <br/>
newspapers. Better for boys to play fantasy war? Desensitization? What?<br/>
