Not rock.<br/>

He used to do Singout (local and convention, never a real up with people <br/>
cast, although I have other friends from Santa Clara Pueblo who toured), and <br/>
madrigal stuff.  He did musicals in high school but in college just <br/>
drama/comedy.  We&#39;ve done a couple of performance things, not lately--one <br/>
Shakespearean thing for the Albuquerque museum, and a Renaissance Christmas <br/>
trio (with Pati Nagle, who writes about the Civil War and plays Middle <br/>
Eastern with Sazlar now and is lost to us for Renaissance stuff) at a <br/>
now-defunct restaurant called Sadies.<br/>

<br/>
My husband is a muscian and played in<br/>
alb/nm/4 corners area, etc. for years, until<br/>
we moved out here. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So do you know John Truitt?<br/>
He was my recorder teacher.  <br/>
(He would laugh and say I taught myself, but he&#39;s not right.)<br/>
<br/>
He used to play in rock bands, and does woodwinds (sax, clarinet) and also <br/>
Flamenco guitar and jazz and Renaissance.   I had the biggest crush on him in <br/>
college...<br/>
