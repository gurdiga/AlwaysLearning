<div id="ygrps-yiv-873716203">Thank you for pointing out the RU vs Unschooling labeling I have used it and will not any more ---  I love the name of this list as it is the most accurate --Always Learning!  I used to say to family and friends we were Life Learners rather than unschoolers vs homeschoolers, but pedagogically that term has been picked up by traditional systems to use to validate curricula ( &quot;we are creating life learners with this new program&quot;... ---sigh --)  I will probably still fall back on Life Learners --but to say we are always learning is the most accurate --and it is not a label, but a statement! I like that.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you posted a potential new term &lt;g&gt; this week and I liked it a lot as I read it ---but can&#39;t find it again - lost on the list again!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Happy New Year.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1246713114">-=-but pedagogically that term has been picked up by traditional  <br/>
systems to use to validate curricula -=-<br/>
<br/>
But when the schools say &quot;life learners&quot; they mean people who won&#39;t be  <br/>
totally burned out on learning when they leave school--that they will  <br/>
learn for life.<br/>
<br/>
When unschoolers say &quot;life learners&quot; they might be more likely to mean  <br/>
learning FROM life (rather than learning for a lifetime, though  <br/>
learning from life doesn&#39;t have a graduation date!)<br/>

<br/>
I was on the NH State Dept. of Ed website a few days ago (homeschoolers are<br/>
going through another legislative challenge in January) and was amused to<br/>
see that one of the programs they&#39;re using  is called &quot;Authentic Education.&quot;<br/>
