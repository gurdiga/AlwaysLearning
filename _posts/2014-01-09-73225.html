<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090827891">I am a person who is very sensitive to sound.  I have had migraines because<br/>
of certain sounds that I couldn&#39;t escape.  Part of it is sensitive ears,<br/>
part of it is my somewhat &quot;different&quot; neurology.  I will NOT acclimate to<br/>
certain sounds, I can&#39;t make my brain not react.<br/>
<br/>
BUT, I can wear the squishy ear plugs that filter, but don&#39;t block, the<br/>
sound.  This lowers the level just enough that I can cope with MY issue<br/>
without it impacting the people around me.  My children are older now and<br/>
are somehow not as loud.  But when they were young, I had to make<br/>
adjustments so that I could be kind.  Not that I didn&#39;t sometimes say,<br/>
sweetly, &quot;Can that be less loud, please?&quot;  I would even say, &quot;I am finding<br/>
this same song/cartoon/ sound nerve wracking, can we play something else?&quot;,<br/>
especially when the same thing had been playing for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
But I would say it calmly, and with kindness.  Everyone in a home has a<br/>
right to be comfortable and happy, but not at the expense of someone else.<br/>
 We found balance by adjusting and compromise--mostly by the adults because<br/>
children learning and being joyful is important and fleeting.<br/>

&gt; It&#39;s true some sounds are irritating.<br/>
&gt; I can&#39;t think if I can hear two broadcasts at once, like a radio station<br/>
&gt; AND a TV show, or with two different pieces of music playing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In another discussion Meredith wrote to a sound-bothered mom:  &quot;Maybe in<br/>
&gt; good weather, with the windows open, the sound won&#39;t trouble you so much.<br/>
&gt; Maybe over time you&#39;ll get used to it...&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes a mom says she can&#39;t listen to cartoons or some such.  It can be<br/>
&gt; easier in a larger house than a smaller one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It can also help to remember that choosing to keep children home instead<br/>
&gt; of send them to school means all of their learning and experience, in early<br/>
&gt; years, is going to happen right where the mom is, and if the mom chooses<br/>
&gt; all the input and the schedule, the children will be limited.  If the mom<br/>
&gt; finds ways to appreciate life being stirred up, to see that as an advantage<br/>
&gt; rather than an inconvenience, the sounds should be happier and more welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Resentment sometimes comes from a thwarted desire to control, so any steps<br/>
&gt; taken to relax into giving children more choices and more options might<br/>
&gt; help.   Any irritant is worrse when the hearer is keyed up and tense than<br/>
&gt; if she&#39;s relaxed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When a child is home instead of at school, the mom doesn&#39;t get hours<br/>
&gt; alone, but she also avoids the right-after-school frenzy or doldrums, and<br/>
&gt; the early morning panicky rush of dressing and lunch prep or needing funds<br/>
&gt; or permissions slips or homework or special supplies or particular shoes<br/>
&gt; and where&#39;s the flute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes an inventory of what is gained can help sounds be a part of what<br/>
&gt; the parents have chosen�to create a learning environment that&#39;s different<br/>
&gt; than, better than, more individualized than school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If a child&#39;s presence is stressing a mom out to where she can&#39;t be kind<br/>
&gt; and sweet to him, it&#39;s possible school would be better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Homeschooling needs to be re-chosen and renewed.  It&#39;s not decided once<br/>
&gt; and then will coast.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling even moreso, because it&#39;s a constant state (unlike doing a<br/>
&gt; curriculum on a schoolish schedule).  This is from yesterday&#39;s chat:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sandra Dodd: When people think about &quot;making decisions,&quot; they think &quot;I<br/>
&gt; decided to be an unschooler, and nothing is going to change my mind.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Sandra Dodd: But then what?<br/>
&gt; Sandra Dodd: It&#39;s NOT a one-time decision, like deciding to move to<br/>
&gt; Chicago.<br/>
&gt; Sandra Dodd:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sandra Dodd: And when people see that unschooling only works if you make<br/>
&gt; twenty or fifty little decisions a day that lead you closer to doing it<br/>
&gt; better, they realize that the one decision they made to get married is<br/>
&gt; NOT enough. They need to make thirty decisions a day to stay married!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Deciding many times a day to be patient and accommodating will make it<br/>
&gt; easier to do that, as the relationship between the mom and child gets<br/>
&gt; calmer, and as unschooling works better.  Making lots of choices makes<br/>
&gt; making choices easier.<br/>
