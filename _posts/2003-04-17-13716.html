Once again, Holly ordered up a haircut I feared would be a disaster (the <br/>
backup plan was we would shave her whole head) and it was NOT a disaster.  <br/>
She has an artsiness and confidence about her I have never had.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993470113">Geeze, Sandra.  You could make a living doing hair.  It&#39;s amazing.  I <br/>
cut my girls&#39; hair too...straight across the bangs and straight across <br/>
the back!  I had to show them how cool it was and Elysia, the 5 yr old, <br/>
saw Holly&#39;s collection of My Little Ponies in the background.  She liked <br/>
Holly&#39;s hair but was REALLY impressed with so many little ponies.  So if <br/>
Holly&#39;s ever looking for a buyer... HeidiC.<br/>
