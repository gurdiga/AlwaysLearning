<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116559373">I know that sometimes kids have really negative reactions to sitting and <br/>
watching tv a lot. Some kids really seem to be just hooked and unable to tear <br/>
themselves away and when they finally do they seem to have an altered mood <br/>
that is not pleasant at all. I have friends whose kids reacted this way and <br/>
one of my kids went through  a period of time like this.<br/>
<br/>
It got me thinking harder about how it worked for us when my kids were <br/>
younger. We unschooling parents who say we give unlimited choice to our kids <br/>
may be really engaging in &quot;manipulating&quot; the situation more than we realize <br/>
or admit. When one of my kids went through a phase where watching too much tv <br/>
made her really really cranky for the rest of the day, I didn&#39;t respond by <br/>
setting limits on tv watching - but, in fact, in a way, I did.<br/>
<br/>
 I would notice to myself,  &quot;Hey, Roxana is watching tv,&quot; and I&#39;d be <br/>
automatically thinking of something I could entice her away with as soon as <br/>
that particular show ended. Sometimes I didn&#39;t - and then, later after she&#39;d <br/>
recovered and gotten her normal self back -- I&#39;d find some way to at least <br/>
casually mention that that kind of meltdown often happened after extensive tv <br/>
watching. Then - sometimes when I would entice her away - later, when we were <br/>
cooking or washing the dog or doing something else &quot;fun&quot; &lt;G&gt; -- I&#39;d say, <br/>
&quot;Today when you only watched one show, you didn&#39;t have that meltdown feeling, <br/>
huh?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She slowly learned to sense when it was too much for her. Too much computer <br/>
time had a similar effect -- but she knows how to handle both tv and computer <br/>
time now. <br/>
<br/>
So - it isn&#39;t like we ignored it when TV seemed to be having such a <br/>
deleterious effect on one child&#39;s mood and behavior that it was impacting the <br/>
whole family. It was that our response to it wasn&#39;t to just set some <br/>
arbitrary limit -- there was no specific limit and there was much more <br/>
involved in our response than just limiting tv to avoid the problems. It <br/>
didn&#39;t last that long - although it lasted longer with the computer time <br/>
issue - and she&#39;s had to experiment with that a lot. She spends a LOT of time <br/>
on the computer - and I think the way she&#39;s worked it out is by the <br/>
combination of different activities she does on there - not just doing one <br/>
thing for hours and hours. In this caes, I don&#39;t see how she&#39;d have ever <br/>
worked this out for herself if we&#39;d just arbitrarily said, &quot;One and one-half <br/>
hours a day is your limit.&quot; And I&#39;d have never been able to solve the <br/>
computer problems for her - it HAD to be her own trial and error solution in <br/>
order to work for her.<br/>
