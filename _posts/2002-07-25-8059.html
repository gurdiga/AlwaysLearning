Your reply has got me thinking...<br/>
What the heck am I saying?!?! I don&#39;t wanna &quot;go back&quot; and be younger.  That<br/>
would really hurt.<br/>
The good years are NOW and in the years to come<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892233175">Thanks, Sharon.  We just had a wonderful dinner at Red Lobster, one of<br/>
my kid&#39;s favorite places. We shocked the waitress and all the folks in<br/>
the waiting area.  Janene ordered lobster and vegitables, with a<br/>
specific request for brocoli.   Lexie the ultimate shrimp feast.  My<br/>
kids just won&#39;t order off the kid&#39;s menu at RL.  After Janene ordered,<br/>
we went in the waiting room. She saw the lobster and we had the<br/>
following conversation...<br/>
<br/>
Janene:  Are those the lobsters they serve?<br/>
Me: Yes.<br/>
J:  and they die, uh, kill them?<br/>
me:  yes (wondering if she was going to change her order).<br/>
J: and they cook them?<br/>
me. yes (becoming more worried)<br/>
J:  OK, can you have them kill and cook me THAT one (pointing to a<br/>
particular lobster)....<br/>
<br/>
not what I expected...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1054564145">Sandra, we celebrated your birthday at our park day on Wednesday. Pineapple<br/>
up-side-down cake was firmly in the minds of the bakers of Dutch oven cakes.<br/>
In our burning need to justify such extravagance, the only good excuse we<br/>
knew of was your birthday. Congratulations, the cake tasted great!<br/>
<br/>
We will gladly recreate the experience for the next time you visit &lt;G&gt;<br/>

I think the next time pineapple is on sale and plane tickets are on sale, <br/>
perhaps extravagance will be in order again.<br/>
