<div id="ygrps-yiv-547884273">I had an interesting conversation with my two boys (3 and 5) after supper while eating ice lollies...<br/>
<br/>
We got onto fart noises, as you do, and I showed them how to make a really loud noise on their arms.  Charlie (3) said &#39;that sounds like a trumpet&#39; and I commented that you actually play a trumpet by blowing a raspberry into the mouthpiece (I think you do anyway - more or less!).<br/>
<br/>
Jack (5) didn&#39;t believe me so I showed him footage of Louis Armstrong on YouTube.  We moved on to other brass instruments (seeing them in his band and through links to other videos) and then spotted a cartoon linked to the video.  <br/>
<br/>
It turned out to be an ancient &#39;Betty Boop&#39; cartoon  with the music done by a very young Louis Armstrong and band- very strange video where Ms Boop is in a jungle being chased by &#39;savages&#39; in grass skirts who try to cook her and her friends in a pot.  <br/>
<br/>
The &#39;savages&#39; are frequently inter-cut with live footage of Armstrong and his band (the canibal cook stirring the pot relates to the drummer playing his drum for example)- references to their skin colour I assumed.  He&#39;s singing &#39;I&#39;ll be glad when you&#39;re dead, you rascal you&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting talk about how ideas of what is acceptable/funny change over time.  Jack asking why Armstrong would let them make him look scary and stupid.<br/>
<br/>
So music, social history, ethics, humour... all from fart noises.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt many people would think that making fart noises could lead there, and second because I think even fewer would consider a five year old capable of talking intelligently about that sort of thing.<br/>
<br/>
It was nice, so I thought I&#39;d share it.<br/>

I can make a fart noise with the palms of my hand.  Some people can do  <br/>
it with a palm in the armpit, but I never could do that one...<br/>
<br/>
I think anything can lead to everything.   Nice story!!<br/>

Oh the gaps you find in your knowledge when you try to pass on your precious heritage to your children ;)<br/>
