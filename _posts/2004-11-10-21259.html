<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285538574">This is the name the media has given to the American Terrorist who released the terror tape a few weeks ago which threatened more attacks here.  Guess what?  CNN just did a story on him and he was homeschooled.  Wasn&#39;t it just a couple of months ago that there was a story somewhere that portrayed homeschoolers as terrorists?  I think we, normal homeschoolers, should be able to have equal time when there is a story like this, sort of like when the Democtats get equal time after the President speaks.<br/>

--------------------<br/>
<br/>
One of my fears since I ever had children was ending up in People Magazine <br/>
way down the line, being interviewed about why my child would have tried to kill <br/>
the president (or someone).   Just a vague fear, y&#39;know?<br/>
<br/>
Nothing is guaranteed.<br/>
<br/>
I could still end up in People Magazine.<br/>
<br/>
Then who would get equal time?  Other people who grew up in my hometown?  <br/>
Whose kids worked where Kirby works?  &quot;Normal homeschoolers&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Years ago when we would hear that an SCA member (medieval club I&#39;m in) had <br/>
committed a crime, or been on Jeopardy, or was interviewed about something <br/>
altogether unrelated and mentioned the SCA, we&#39;d get all excited, because the SCA <br/>
was a fairly new club then, and there weren&#39;t so many members.  <br/>
<br/>
Now so many people are or have been in the SCA, I hardly perk up.  Time was, <br/>
I would either have known the person or known someone who did.  Like the <br/>
difference between being in a small town and hearing an ambulance (just ask at the <br/>
store and someone will know who got hurt), and living in a city and hearing an <br/>
ambulance.  After a while you just don&#39;t hear them.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is a accused of a crime and belongs to an obscure little religion, <br/>
they&#39;ll mention it.  If he&#39;s Catholic or Presbyterian, it won&#39;t be <br/>
interesting, and they won&#39;t mention it.<br/>
