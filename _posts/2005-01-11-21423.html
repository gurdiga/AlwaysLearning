<div id="ygrps-yiv-551032581">-=-SCA is very low-cost or free.  (Is<br/>
this correct, Sandra?)               -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you just want to hang out on the edges it can be cheap to free.  If you want to really particate, memberships would be good (and for some things, required).  And costumes.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine I&#39;ve known through the SCA for 20 years lost her husband suddenly just a couple of months ago.  Duchess Melisande (Carol O&#39;Leary), in case you do get around there and so you might recognize the name.  She has one son, a bit older than my eldest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-575834475">-=-Roger just came in to say that one of the older kids in the<br/>
neighborhood is offering to show Roger everything he knows on guitar.<br/>
Which reminds me that we can also learn a lot from our peers. =&#92;=<br/>
<br/>
AHA!  JUST before this, I answered an e-mail from my friend Ymelda, who taught me to play guitar.  She was my friend&#39;s older sister (and we&#39;ve stayed friends since 1967).  She would say she didn&#39;t teach me, but she gave me one lesson, answered all my questions, and offered another lesson when I was ready. I just practiced on my own and showed her sometimes how I was doing.<br/>
