<div id="ygrps-yiv-158830103">My sixth grader is miserable, and we are either &quot;giving him a year off&quot; or leaving school entirely. <br/>
<br/>
I work full time, and my husband (who works from home and is primary caregiver) is not yet quite on board with taking our son out of school. He is more in line with &quot;giving him a break while we look for a better fit.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, my husband ended his formal schooling in 7th grade. He knows everything he knows thanks to teaching himself, but does feel &quot;less than&quot; due to not having formal credentials, so values them highly. Granted, he has been in positions where formal credentials seemed to determine or deny an opportunity. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m the one with formal credentials, but I also realize how arbirtrary the requirements can be. <br/>
<br/>
My thought is that we could subscribe to an online 7th grade course that my son could do in a short amount of time every day, and then he could do as he wishes the rest of the day.<br/>
<br/>
 I guess I have these visions of him learning to love books, indulging his enjoyment of building things and of doing art, cooking, etc. I guess I worry that instead, he&#39;s going to be spending his day on video games.<br/>
<br/>
Also, his brother is going into 11th grade and is fine. Does anyone else have the experience of getting one kid up early every day and having the other one stay home? Resentment there? The older kid (first born, very conventional) thinks we spoil his little brother as it is, though he loves him very much.<br/>
<br/>
Any words of wisdom appreciated from those who have taken a 10-13yo  out of school. I would do anything for my boys, but worry that what I would do... would be wrong. Books to read especially sought for. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

It would take at least six months for him to get to the point that he  <br/>
would fulfill your &quot;visions,&quot; and the danger of seeing what you want  <br/>
to see as success and what you DO see as failure, is that the kid is  <br/>
unlikely to become your imaginary successful homeschooler.<br/>

If you were to print out and bind the information on these two sites, <br/>
you&#39;d have a couple hefty books on unschooling.  Or you could do like I <br/>
do and just read them online:<br/>

<br/>
You could do this, but you wouldn&#39;t be unschooling.  I wouldn&#39;t describe <br/>
that as &quot;giving him a year off&quot; either. It&#39;s just doing school in a <br/>
different environment.<br/>
<br/>
If your dh is the person who would be facilitating your son&#39;s activities and <br/>
home schooling, or unschooling, perhaps he should be asking the questions. <br/>

<br/>
I suspect that you and your husband might have different ideas about what <br/>
&quot;do as he wishes&quot; would mean. Unschooling isn&#39;t leaving a child alone to do <br/>
as he wishes while you get your work done.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Books to read especially sought for.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Katherine already said the same thing I would say - there are some great <br/>
books, but the easiest and best source is www.sandradodd.com/unschooling .<br/>
Open 24 hours, no waiting.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; Ironically, my husband ended his formal schooling in 7th grade. He <br/>

<br/>
Deschooling is not just the child recovering from school damage. It&#39;s also <br/>
the parents exploring their own school and childhood damage and proactively <br/>
changing their thinking until the paradigm shift happens. It&#39;s great to <br/>
start with something really obvious like this pendulum swing/knee jerk, but <br/>
you may be sure there are more subconcious assumptions lurking there too.<br/>

<br/>
One of the easiest ways to kill someone else&#39;s passions is to have<br/>
visions and expectations for them.  Everytime you see it within your own<br/>
vision, you&#39;re missing the child&#39;s vision.  Kids will do what they love<br/>
to do, if given the freedom to do it.<br/>
<br/>
What they love may not look like anything schooly, or anything that you<br/>
might have expected.  What I&#39;ve come to understand, is that, there is<br/>
learning in everything!  What we do for enjoyment, the things we are<br/>
passionate about, will create more learning than anything else.  Kids<br/>
who are happy will learn easier and better than kids who aren&#39;t, and<br/>
kids who are trying to meet someone else&#39;s idea of what is happy making<br/>
and good for them won&#39;t be learning as easy as they would if they were<br/>
doing it for themselves, for their own personal reasons.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s passion for fashion and make-up has led her to all kinds<br/>
of learning, theatrical make-up, making her own clothing, cutting hair,<br/>
styling hair, dyeing hair, re-working old clothing, making hair<br/>
assessories, and all that stuff is really the surface of what she&#39;s<br/>
learned.<br/>
<br/>
Other people may come along and say &quot;what about math?&quot;.  My answer is<br/>
usually, &quot;what about it?&quot;.  She may not know algebraic formulas, but she<br/>
knows how to use money and time, and cut and sew and match shapes to do<br/>
so.  This is what she loves to do and she may do it for the rest of her<br/>
life and make a living out of it.  If that&#39;s the case, why would she<br/>
need to know what she&#39;ll never use?  And if she ever does need to, she&#39;s<br/>
pretty smart about figuring things out.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You could make it clear that he doesn&#39;t have to get up and go to school<br/>
if he doesn&#39;t want to.  Then there wouldn&#39;t be any resentment, only<br/>
choices, and the things that he needs to do or not based on his choices.</div>
