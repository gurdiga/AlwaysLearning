<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876866994">&quot;i have since been reminded that we can create the answers we seek. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is one part of a post that was returned, but this part might be  <br/>
good to look at.<br/>
<br/>
What answers might unschoolers be seeking that they would need to (or  <br/>
could) &quot;create&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I think there are about 2,000 answers here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
and parts from which answers, ideas, theories and party-days could be  <br/>
built, and I don&#39;t think &quot;creation&quot; is what answers need.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Although the phrase smells of a self-help manual, I would interpret it to mean that we can choose to change our parenting behaviour to make our relationships with our children more loving, peaceful and fulfilling. Through our own conscious efforts we can create a family life full of fun and learning.<br/>
<br/>
However, this is not done in isolation, which is why I would not say that we can simply create (as in conjure out of thin air) a solution to any issue that arises in our unschooling lives.  Without the example and experience of people on this list, I would not have been able to grasp the broad systematic philosophy of unschooling that guides me in any given situation in my daily family life.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the principles that have emerged from all my reading over the past two years are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
- my relationship with my child comes first (any act of mine should promote a loving and respectful relationship with my child)<br/>
<br/>
- arbitrary limits and controls do not promote such a relationship and should not be used<br/>
<br/>
- strewing things, activities and opportunities is vital to creating a rich and vibrant learning environment<br/>
<br/>
- I am my child&#39;s partner in negotiating the world; my child learns from my example<br/>
<br/>
- I am energised by making conscious choices; feeling that I &#39;have to&#39; do something drains my energy<br/>
<br/>
- each child is a precious, unique person; it is a parent&#39;s joy to be able to nuture and encourage their child&#39;s individual personality<br/>
<br/>
No doubt others can expand or modify this list.  However, the point remains that by adopting a coherent set of principles (tried and tested by years of collective experience), an unschooler is guided in any situation that arises in our daily lives.  We don&#39;t have to &#39;create&#39; answers, we can live them.</div>

That&#39;s what I hoped someone would say.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to quote your guiding statements on the affirmations page.   <br/>
If anyone has others that they use to focus on unschooling or peaceful  <br/>
parenting, I&#39;d love to add those.  Right now the affirmations are from  <br/>
adult children of alcoholics sources and maybe similar thing I wrote  <br/>
down in a notebook years back.  There are many books of affirmations  <br/>
available at book stores and often used book stores.  But a list of  <br/>
really-for-unschoolers affirmations would be awesome.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225883550">That was a GREAT list! A keeper. I&#39;ll be looking for a special <br/>
refrigerator magnet to hold it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Joking aside, seriously - great distillation - I don&#39;t remember ever <br/>
seeing such a nice, clear list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652749824">Thanks Pam and Sandra, wow it makes me feel pretty damn good if you two think I&#39;m on the right track! Please feel free to quote as desired from my post.<br/>
<br/>
Even today I have felt calmer during a busy morning with my 2 young daughters because that list of principles was fresh in my mind.<br/>
