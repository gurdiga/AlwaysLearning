<div id="ygrps-yiv-282935098">Please don&#39;t post &quot;me too&quot; and &quot;thank you&quot; posts.  We assume each  <br/>
time someone writes that many others agree, and that when someone  <br/>
receives requested help that they&#39;re grateful.<br/>
<br/>
With over a thousand list members, it&#39;s better without fluff.  it&#39;s a  <br/>
discussion list, not a social list.  If we&#39;re social in the course of  <br/>
discussing unschooling, no problem.<br/>
<br/>
I say over a thousand.  Yahoo lists 1659, but some are undoubtedly  <br/>
duplicates or bounces or people who have forgotten they&#39;re on the list.<br/>
This month so far there have been 1011 posts.  It&#39;s a very busy month.<br/>
<br/>
This came but I didn&#39;t let the post through.  Too much was quoted,  <br/>
for one thing (please also trim posts, only quoting the specific  <br/>
parts to which you&#39;re responding, when you can remember to do that).<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some appreciate more directness, some less, some get more stressed  <br/>
out by certain kinds of information while some thrive on it. Your  <br/>
words were an excellent reminder to adjust the message to the  <br/>
receiver, out of kindness and respect.&quot;   It was addressed to Joanna  <br/>
(the compliment) and obliquely not (the insult).<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t addressed to any one receiver.  It&#39;s addressed to the  <br/>
table, to the discussion, to the topic.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t thrive on  <br/>
this kind of information can leave the list or just read it quietly.   <br/>
It is not unkind to run the list as it has been run since November  <br/>
2001.  It is not disrespectful not to run it as 1600 one-on-ones.<br/>
<br/>
There are some other lists described here<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a> in case someone wants a list I&#39;m  <br/>
not on.  I&#39;m on Unschooling Discussion and this one.<br/>
<br/>
If you put unschooling in at the yahoogroups search, 864 lists come  <br/>
up.   Good!  No one is dependent on this one.<br/>
