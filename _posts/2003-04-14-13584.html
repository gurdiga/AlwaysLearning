 I found this poem in a journal I bought from Borders Bookstore Saturday <br/>
 night. It&#39;s unsigned, so I&#39;ll put the names of the people on the cover <br/>
 as the authors: Mark D. Sanders & Tia Sillers. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have that very same journal!  Dh bought it for me on my Birthday last May.<br/>
The names you listed are the songwriters actually, it was performed by a <br/>
country singer (was it Faith Hill? Can&#39;t remember who it was now) and was an <br/>
instant hit.<br/>
Great message.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt; It sounded familiar to me, so I googled.  The two you mentioned did<br/>
 write it.  It&#39;s a country song sung by Lee Ann Womack. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well there ya go!! And I was remembering Faith Hill.<br/>
Thanks for setting that straight Rue. That&#39;s what I get for firing off an <br/>
email before finishing the whole digest. :)<br/>
