She was pretty insistent that they weren&#39;t. It&#39;s funny now because now I<br/>
know she was right but at the time I sure thought they were. Couldn&#39;t figure<br/>
out why she wouldn&#39;t admit it. ;-)<br/>

PowerQuotes. Do you think I should?  :-)<br/>

&quot;To laugh often and much; to win the respect of intelligent people and the<br/>
affection of children; to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure<br/>
the betrayal of false friends; to appreciate beauty; to find the best on<br/>
others; to leave the world a bit better, whether by a healthy child, a<br/>
garden path, a redeemed social condition; to know even one life has breathed<br/>
easier because you have lives. This is to have Succeeded.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716220592">Yes I was surprised but I think it was the company we were in. ;-) I had<br/>
to travel an hour out of town to go. Very uptight group. There wasn&#39;t anyone<br/>
there that I knew but I was really quite new to even homeschooling. She was<br/>
nice but I felt I made her uncomfortable with my questions so I dropped it.<br/>

Read, every day, something that no one else is reading.<br/>
Think, every day, something that no one else is thinking.<br/>
Do, every day, something no one else would be silly enough to do.<br/>
It is bad for the mind to continually be part of unanimity.<br/>
