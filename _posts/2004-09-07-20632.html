<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949553052">A few years ago, I facilitated a parent group fro a place called the<br/>
Family Nurturing Center.  Several of our meetings were about spanking;<br/>

discipline.  One video focused on that particular quote, and dispelled<br/>
it very well.  I am trying to find the resource.  <br/>
