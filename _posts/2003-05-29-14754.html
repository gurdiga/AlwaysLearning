&gt; kids <br/>
&gt; that his partner should be in charge of names.<br/>

are some stuffed animal names) Sharkey, Snakey, Freddie, Brownie.  I get the <br/>
heebie-jeebies just calling out their names!<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, on the other hand, has named several of our animals: We&#39;ve had <br/>
Beeper (Electronic Page was her registered name), SodaPop, Tornado, Rosie,  Ali & <br/>
Dina (two hamsters, short for &quot;ALl&quot;igator and &quot;DINA&quot;saur), and my favorite, <br/>
Chase (short for Skirtchaser). His old, stuffed bunny is Charlotte, and he named <br/>
Duncan&#39;s stuffed kitty, Matilda (Tilly).<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE names and hate to see the same ones over and over. I&#39;m usually bored <br/>
to tears with dogs&#39; names (Sam, Bear, Ben, Schatzi, etc.). But I LOVE horse <br/>
names! Some of those guys are SOOO creative. Cracks me up!<br/>

She talked about twins today, as a way to avoid the firstborn feeling put <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-533645130">I didn&#39;t see this show but I have seen reports about the study. Supposedly<br/>
certain games (they were the very violent/shooting kind) enhance children&#39;s<br/>
ability to pay attention to multiple aspects of their environment. They are<br/>
more aware of what&#39;s going on around them so kind of hypersensitive to<br/>
environmental factors. The researchers speculate this could make them<br/>
better drivers in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting work but the games they used were the very violent ones and so<br/>
there are many factors that have to be taken into consideration and it&#39;s<br/>
possibly not all positive. Role playing games did not have the same effect.<br/>

Holly I&#39;m proud of her.  I&#39;m always a little horrified when I hear of <br/>

person&#39;s name is such a huge part of their lives.<br/>
<br/>
My girls like names like Crystal Star, Cinderella Rose, Crystal Diamond, <br/>
Buttercup, Pansy, Snowdrop, Diamond, and Snowflake.  Anything that could <br/>
be in a fairy tale, is great.   And lately they pick Leiren, too, in <br/>
honor of their baby sister.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always loved names.  I have many name books.  For my girls I went <br/>
through a whole naming process, which gets harder all the time.  The <br/>
first name must be different, but feminine with a strong meaning that&#39;s <br/>
a noun.  The middle name must be of the same language or ethnicity and <br/>
more usual, must start with a &quot;k&quot; sound to flow with our last name, <br/>
Case, and it&#39;s meaning must be an adjective for the first name&#39;s noun. <br/>
 So far I have:   Irish Gaelic - Aislinn Kathleen (a pure vision or <br/>
dream), Greek - Elysia Khloe (a blooming heaven, or a growing <br/>
happiness), French - Soleille Claire ( bright sunshine), and <br/>
Scandinavian - Leiren Cari (beloved of the earth).    If I have another <br/>
girl next, I&#39;m thinking about Latin - Quinn (queen, fifth).  The only <br/>
problem is a middle name with a &quot;k&quot; sound is too many &quot;k&quot; sounds.  Oh <br/>
well.  Leiren is only six months, so I guess I&#39;ve got some time to <br/>
figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always done the &quot;how will it sound if I&#39;m calling her at the park&quot; <br/>
test.  My husband liked the name Sijana or something like that, but for <br/>
the life of me, I just couldn&#39;t imagine calling that out at the park! <br/>
 He just liked it because it meant to harvest (he&#39;s a farmer).<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;ve rambled way too long.  I just love comming up with names! <br/>
 Good luck.  And by the way Sandra, no matter what she eventually <br/>
settles on, just smile even if you hate it.  It will mean a lot to her. <br/>

&gt;more aware of what&#39;s going on around them so kind of hypersensitive to<br/>
&gt;environmental factors. The researchers speculate this could make them<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Interesting work but the games they used were the very violent ones and so<br/>
&gt;there are many factors that have to be taken into consideration and it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;possibly not all positive. Role playing games did not have the same effect.<br/>

<br/>
I thought the shooting games WERE the role playing games. POV virtual <br/>
reality where you are the character and you try to get certain goals <br/>
accomplished.<br/>
<br/>
Any help would be great. What are the names of the &quot;very <br/>
violent/shooting kind&quot;. Are you talking about all shooting games <br/>
where you kill the enemy?<br/>

&gt;&gt;thought about a name yet.  How can anyone go a lifetime, let alone 9<br/>

&gt;&gt;person&#39;s name is such a huge part of their lives.<br/>

&gt;That&#39;ll be me then......<br/>
&gt;With number 3 I didn&#39;t actually think of any names and he wasn&#39;t named until he<br/>

Subject: the names of the future<br/>
<br/>
Well, her names are creative anyway!!<br/>
We have a furry little girl here named Luna, that was my favorite on her<br/>
list <br/>
of course. <br/>
Luna is a rattie, black with white markings and oh-so-sweet.<br/>
<br/>
I had started a childrens story with a character named Periwinkle. I&#39;m not <br/>
sure I like her &quot;booger&quot; name though. :)<br/>
<br/>
Sierra&#39;s middle name is Star. I like Azia, Connor, Donovan too. My dh liked<br/>
Biff, Turk and Astra. Hmmmmm.... I think he has issues.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When my strong-willed sister was having her first baby, she wanted the name<br/>
Esmerelde (Ez-mer-EL-duh) for a girl.<br/>
<br/>
My dear late grandmother smiled and told her she could name her child<br/>
anything she wanted, and doubtless she would.  However, she recommended that<br/>
she stand at the back door to her home and scream the name 30 times at the<br/>
top of her lungs, because that&#39;s how she was gonna hear it for the next 18<br/>
years of her life.<br/>
<br/>
Her sons are named Robert and Terry.<br/>

<br/>
are some stuffed animal names) Sharkey, Snakey, Freddie, Brownie.  I get the<br/>
<br/>
heebie-jeebies just calling out their names!<br/>
<br/>
Cameron, on the other hand, has named several of our animals: We&#39;ve had <br/>
Beeper (Electronic Page was her registered name), SodaPop, Tornado, Rosie,<br/>
Ali & <br/>
Dina (two hamsters, short for &quot;ALl&quot;igator and &quot;DINA&quot;saur), and my favorite, <br/>
Chase (short for Skirtchaser). His old, stuffed bunny is Charlotte, and he<br/>
named <br/>
Duncan&#39;s stuffed kitty, Matilda (Tilly).<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE names and hate to see the same ones over and over. I&#39;m usually bored <br/>
to tears with dogs&#39; names (Sam, Bear, Ben, Schatzi, etc.). But I LOVE horse <br/>
names! Some of those guys are SOOO creative. Cracks me up!<br/>

She talked about twins today, as a way to avoid the firstborn feeling put <br/>
out.  First twins, then a single birth.  She thinks that will solve all<br/>
problems. <br/>

She&#39;s wanting me to prove I care about my future grandchildren.  She used to<br/>

Subject: Re: The View<br/>

I didn&#39;t see this show but I have seen reports about the study. Supposedly<br/>
certain games (they were the very violent/shooting kind) enhance children&#39;s<br/>
ability to pay attention to multiple aspects of their environment. They are<br/>
more aware of what&#39;s going on around them so kind of hypersensitive to<br/>
environmental factors. The researchers speculate this could make them better<br/>
drivers in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting work but the games they used were the very violent ones and so<br/>
there are many factors that have to be taken into consideration and it&#39;s<br/>
possibly not all positive. Role playing games did not have the same effect.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Thanks Kate. Better drivers? Great!! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very seriously, not just because of video games, but also all the multi-rules <br/>
games Kirby plays, I feel extra confident in him as a driver.  Spatial isn&#39;t <br/>
his best thing, but he IS deeply aware of fifteen factors at once and how any <br/>
one of them can affect all the rest, and he HAS proven he can learn tons of <br/>
rules and follow them even if they seem arbitrary.<br/>
<br/>
He has had a learner&#39;s permit for a couple of months now, and he&#39;s doing <br/>
great!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I thought the shooting games WERE the role playing games. POV virtual <br/>
reality where you are the character and you try to get certain goals <br/>
accomplished.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, role-playing games you&#39;re a character on a quest or mission and you have <br/>
to gather information from other characters and places, you have &quot;stats&quot; (the <br/>
character has certain levels of strength, stamina, intelligence, &quot;life,&quot; or <br/>
other such factors which are randomly given or earned or chosen when the ch<br/>
aracter is created.<br/>
<br/>
In shooting games you&#39;re just &quot;it,&quot; and the course is the same every time.  <br/>
It&#39;s more like a target game.<br/>

I told her maybe she should name &quot;Booger&quot; &quot;Bogart&quot; instead, which will make <br/>
&quot;Rock&quot; seem like Rock Hudson, and the other be for Humphrey Bogart, and then <br/>
call him Bogey (Bogart&#39;s nickname) which only means booger in England.  (And <br/>
then keep him out of England, I guess.)<br/>

As far as multiple births go, it&#39;s so true that they are referred generally <br/>
as to which name flows in which order. i.e. Kass & Kree They even think it <br/>
sounds funny if someone says Kree and Kass. When the doctors told me that I would <br/>
probably have twins or trips the next time around, we decided on Koll and <br/>
Kaii. Then a lightbulb turned on in my head and said no, we&#39;ll stick with only <br/>
Kass & Kree.<br/>
<br/>
Their names were actually chosen for our boy names as we weren&#39;t sure of <br/>
their sexes. However, the girl names we had chosen seemed to get tossed out the <br/>
window, only moments before they arrived. Kass was supposed to be Natural Love <br/>
and Kree was supposed to be Precious Rose. My friends on this list can attest <br/>
to the fact that Kree is as far from fitting Precious Rose as could be <br/>
possible. She always thanx me for changing our minds. She much prefers being named <br/>
after a native tribe than some corny flower (her words). Kass is happy to be <br/>
short for the constellation, because she says she&#39;d be really mad if people <br/>
referred to her as &quot;Nat&quot;, because she is no bug (gnat), but thinks of herself as a <br/>
star.<br/>

Marty says yes.  It&#39;s an RPG.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Marty says RPGs are turn-based, as opposed to live action.  (** means I was <br/>
writing what Marty was saying)<br/>
<br/>
**In James Bond, you push the joy stick, your guy moves forward.  You pull <br/>
the trigger, he shoots his gun.  It&#39;s all immediate.<br/>
<br/>
**RPGs, this guy attacks (the computer&#39;s character) and it might come in <br/>
actions or might come in text/description.  Then you choose how to respond, and <br/>
sometimes your choices involve your list of stuff--spells, defenses, weapons  <br/>
(defense, attack, spells, flee).<br/>
<br/>
**Different RPGs have different formats, but basically it&#39;s more like <br/>
programming (than like driving).<br/>
<br/>
----<br/>
<br/>
So, I think, from talking to Marty and Holly about it just now, that the <br/>
shooter games are reflex games and point of view (what&#39;s behind you, what&#39;s to the <br/>
sides?  Where are you headed?) and RPGs are situational (who has what power, <br/>
who has what advantages, what&#39;s a good long-range plan?)  <br/>
<br/>
(I read that paragraph above to Marty, and he said, &quot;Right.  Very good, very <br/>
good.&quot;)<br/>
