<div id="ygrps-yiv-877918724">==When someone with a baby who hasn&#39;t been honest about her motivations for<br/>
being on the list ==<br/>
I&#39;m not used to seeing my name associated with not honest. I was going to let it go, thinking that any post trying to set the record straight would be banned. But it doesn&#39;t feel right.<br/>
On Jan 31, Sandra Dodd and I had an email exchange (about a banned post :) ) I wrote to Sandra that I was doing a documentary. Her response was:<br/>
&quot;There have been people who have done documentaries on unschooling before, and newspaper articles, and magazine articles, and when I saw their results I was stunned at how little they understood.  I have been thoroughly interviewed many times, and nobody has understood it yet without being around unschoolers for a long time and really seeing it work.&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t expect Sandra (or anybody) to remember every email you receive or write. But you can&#39;t accuse me now of having hidden something from you and I don&#39;t feel like i was treated with fairness by being repeatedly called not honest and not upfront when I was, in fact, upfront and honest with you.<br/>
<br/>
Also, the film I&#39;m working on is on Autonomous Learning, not on Radical Unschooling. I joined this list for personal reasons, for my growth and learning as a parent. It&#39;s helped a lot and I&#39;m grateful for that.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, the quote was accurate. I didn&#39;t botch it, it came in two separate emails. Sandra, and everybody, feel free to email Naomi Aldort if you&#39;d like to check the accuracy of the quote or discuss any part of this with her. Her email is on website naomialdort.com I agree with those who wrote that any conversation with her should be happening directly.<br/>
<br/>
I made a big mistake by posting a link to her article. I will avoid such mistakes in the future by not posting. There is enough info in the archives so that I don&#39;t need to ask my own questions. I apologize for any trouble I have caused here.<br/>
<br/>
Best,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566490048">But that was a private conversation (email) with Sandra - what about openness and clarity with the other posters on this list?<br/>
<br/>
You simply asked us to read the web site with Q&#39;s & A&#39;s and asked for our input for your better understanding.  Unless I missed something, I don&#39;t remember you stating to the group - posters that spend a huge part of their time reading and answering posts - that you were making a documentary.  I don&#39;t like feeling like a lab rat - when I&#39;m working a full time job AND unschooling my almost 16 year old son.  I feel like we were being observed through a one way window with questions meant only to pick our brains for a research project, not questions of a parent trying to understand how to be a better parent / have a better relationship with their child.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087515487">&quot;I made a big mistake by posting a link to her article. I will avoid such<br/>

<br/>
The mistake was not in asking questions. It was in asking questions<br/>
elsewhere and linking to the output here. So, in essence, you haven&#39;t asked<br/>
anything here other than opinions on your conversation with someone else.<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t help to say, &quot;Ok, so you didn&#39;t like me telling you that. I will not<br/>
tell you anything&quot; variety stuff. Might be better to look at how<br/>
conversations can be made to work. After all, isn&#39;t that what we learn to do<br/>
with our unschooling kids - to move away from all or none?<br/>
<br/>
I can speak for myself. It wasn&#39;t so much the asking as it was the way it<br/>
was asked, Though the documentary angle explains the &#39;tell me everything<br/>
about everything&#39; feeling I got when asked for opinions on an article that<br/>
says so many things. The conversation has already happened. The &#39;expert&#39;<br/>
sounds conclusive and unavailable for dialogue. There are people who hit<br/>
their kids in the world too. What can I do? I can only look and shrug and<br/>
not do those things myself. So I feel like a child asked to &quot;recite a poem&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I would have appreciated at least knowing anything specific *you* wanted a<br/>
conversation around out of that laundry list. If you had quoted what you<br/>
found interesting or would like opinions on; the link would have been a<br/>
reference rather than an assignment and not offensive at all. You are a<br/>
member here, and a dialogue is possible. That changes everything.<br/>
