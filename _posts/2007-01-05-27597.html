<div id="ygrps-yiv-825688079">Hello everyone, hope you can help me here.<br/>
I know I may incur everyone&#39;s wrath but my husband and I put the TV<br/>
away when we realised our then 2-year old son was wanting to do<br/>
nothing all day but watch it. It was an interesting experiment as we<br/>
ourselves had never been without TV and I noticed (a) that TV eats<br/>
time, which I no longer have in vast quantities as I did before having<br/>
children and (b) I missed surprisingly little of it... in fact I felt<br/>
relieved at no longer being tempted to watch trash.<br/>
Then my huband, suffering film withdrawal symptoms, bought a DVD<br/>
player meant just for the 2 of us. <br/>
A few months ago he showed it to my now 4-year old. <br/>
So the DVD player is now my son&#39;s favourite toy. He wakes up in the<br/>
morning, and asks to watch a DVD. He comes home after an outing, and<br/>
asks for it again. He won&#39;t eat, drink or do anything but watch. This<br/>
is worring because he is already a pretty thin boy.<br/>
He watches the same thing over and over again, studying it. OK, so<br/>
he&#39;s learning Hairy Mclairy off by heart and yes, having dipped into<br/>
your ideas, Sandra, though I admit I haven&#39;t had time to read your<br/>
work properly, we&#39;ve let him watch as unrestricted as we dare because<br/>
who are we to say what he is and isn&#39;t getting from it?<br/>
But it feels a bit like having offered my lovely boy an open Pandora&#39;s<br/>
box. Yesterday I cracked a bit, which I regret. (I guess I did an<br/>
impersonation of my own mother falling apart, although I didn&#39;t go as<br/>
far as to shove a sponge in his hand with instructions to do something<br/>
useful and wash the car, but perhaps that&#39;s because I don&#39;t have a car.)<br/>
I do need some advice from you about what you think is going to happen<br/>
to this obsessive viewing. He is only 4. I feel I am losing my son to<br/>
the screen. We used to play games together, but he&#39;s lost interest.<br/>
And don&#39;t say, &#39;he&#39;ll lose interest in what he&#39;s watching and want to<br/>
reconnect with you&#39;because he&#39;s smart enough to know there are lots<br/>
more DVDs in the library full of new interest. Each new DVD brings<br/>
about an 8-hour daily viewing schedule.<br/>
I am also worried about the effect on me. I&#39;m getting used to not<br/>
bothering looking after him any more.<br/>
I&#39;m not convinced he&#39;s going to regulate himself. Or at least, not to<br/>
anything less than hours a day.<br/>
And the other worry I have is that he prefers a life in front a screen<br/>
now than he does his life outdoors and interacting with his family.<br/>
Sorry if I sound grumpy. I&#39;m probably just a bit scared. Anyone with<br/>
experience of this issue?</div>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; experience of this issue?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We never got rid of TV, it has always been available.  My oldest <br/>
watched quite a bit.  She used to get that glazed look in her eyes.  <br/>
I restricted it here and there, but she loved it so much, she got <br/>
quite a bit of it.  My second wasn&#39;t into it too much.  My third son <br/>
Jack was the one I really worried about, but by that time I was full <br/>
on unschooling and kept my mouth shut.  He literally watched all day <br/>
long a lot of days.  He watched the same episodes on Nichelodeon <br/>
over and over.  I couldn&#39;t believe how much.  My oldest got <br/>
obesessed with musicals and she spent a lot of time renting and <br/>
watching the classics (Hello Dolly is her favorite). <br/>
Just when Jack seemed to be getting his fill and not watching so <br/>
much, our cable company added Cartoon Network.  That was a huge <br/>
challenge for me.  I really wanted to restrict it because I knew <br/>
with his personality it would atleast be a year before he wasn&#39;t so <br/>
obsessed.  It was probably longer now that I think about it.  <br/>
Ofcoarse we were doing other things through all that time.  Jack <br/>
loves to play games and sometimes an offer of Sorry or Hero Scape <br/>
won out.  Game Cube and Game Boy were available.  Books on tape in <br/>
the car.  Playing with friends.  Puzzles and crafts.....Lots <br/>
available.  But he loved tv.  <br/>
He is 10 now.  He got over Cartoon Network at around 7 or 8.  Now he <br/>
just watches the shows he really likes, like Avatar.  At around 8 <br/>
Animal Planet and Discovery Channel became the thing he watched <br/>
most.  We joined a 4-H group and the group is studying coastal <br/>
bays.  Jack adds lots of information to the discussions.  He&#39;s quite <br/>
impressive with all his knowledge.  <br/>
4 year old Jack found something in tv watching that met his needs.  <br/>
So did 8 year old Jack.  10 year old Jack does too but he is more <br/>
mature and has a lot of different needs and desires.  His way of <br/>
meeting them has expanded, which leaves a lot less time for tv.<br/>
It wasn&#39;t easy and I didn&#39;t always feel like I was doing the best <br/>
thing for him, but I did let him have the freedom and I can&#39;t see <br/>
any damage from all those years of hours and hours of watching.  I <br/>
also don&#39;t see any damage to our relationship that would have <br/>
suffered quite a bit had I tried to control his intense desire/need <br/>
to watch.  That&#39;s always the most important thing to me.<br/>

Why don&#39;t you take the time?  It&#39;s a better use of your time than  <br/>
hovering over a four year old, thinking bad things about his sincere  <br/>

<br/>
Instead of living on the edge of danger, read the TV parts on my site  <br/>
and Joyce&#39;s.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/tv">http://sandradodd.com/tv</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a>  (left column, 3/4 way down)<br/>
<br/>
Without that you won&#39;t be making a very informed choice, when you  <br/>
retrict.  You&#39;ll be operating from fear.<br/>
<br/>
Another good way to spend your time would be to watch WITH your son,  <br/>
uncritically, and see what he&#39;s seeing and why he likes it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to quote from Joyce&#39;s intro page, since I was just there,  <br/>
about finding more joyful ways to live:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The first step is finding something that&#39;s better than what you have.<br/>
The second step is wanting to change.<br/>
The third step is figuring out how to change.<br/>
So, as you read along, you may wonder why I suggest that parents  <br/>
basically make life more difficult for themselves. The reason is  <br/>
because I believe it leads to a much better place. And that better  <br/>
place is a more joyful life for our children and our families.<br/>

What if little kids watch TV all day?<br/>
<br/>
  What can happen?<br/>
<br/>
[From a discussion of whether young children would ever grow out of  <br/>
watching TV all day, a response to a response:]<br/>
I just can&#39;t imagine a three year old sitting still on the sofa  <br/>
through five movies. My last three year old was always doing  <br/>
something else AND watching movies. He always had a toy in his hand  <br/>
or something spread out on the floor. He listened to the movie with  <br/>
one ear while he made noises with his airplanes, or he glanced at the  <br/>
screen while he drew a picture, until his favorite part came on.<br/>
<br/>
My kids did exactly this when we first moved here in the middle of  <br/>
August and we got cable for the very first time (previously, we&#39;d  <br/>
gotten 2-3 channels in on our antenna at our old house and there were  <br/>
rarely shows of interest to them.) They were now exposed to cartoons  <br/>
24/7 (heaven of heavens to them!) and sometimes would even stay in  <br/>
front of the TV not only all day, but most of the night as well, only  <br/>
to wake again in the morning and ask first thing, &quot;Can I watch TV?&quot;  <br/>
It really irritated me. i worried for their health and my sanity.<br/>
<br/>

Snobbishness vs. Godzilla<br/>

<br/>
All this talk about television reminded me of something that happened  <br/>
several years ago with Colton, who was eight at the time. I am  <br/>
ashamed to say that I went through a period of extreme TV  <br/>
snobbishness. I felt that watching television was a waste of our  <br/>
time, so I got rid of cable. We only watched carefully chosen videos,  <br/>
designed to enrich and uplift us. (I cringe as I write this now!) I  <br/>
was totally obnoxious about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One day Colton and Bud returned from the library, thrilled with what  <br/>
they had found. A video copy of &quot;Godzilla!&quot; I snorted derisively and  <br/>
suggested that our time would be better spent with a book. I was  <br/>
ignored. They made some popcorn and started the movie. I sat with  <br/>
them on the couch, or to be more accurate, on my moral high horse,  <br/>
with an &quot;uplifting&quot; book in hand. I rolled my eyes and sighed with  <br/>
gusto to point out how they were wasting their time. Colton and Bud  <br/>
continued to ignore me.<br/>
<br/>
Something finally penetrated my self-imposed role as the chief of the  <br/>
culture police. A voice whispered in my ear: Look at them, Carol.  <br/>
Just LOOK at them! I studied my son and my husband for about five  <br/>
minutes. They were totally engrossed in the movie, yet they never  <br/>
stopped touching each other. Colton would lean against Bud&#39;s shoulder  <br/>
as he giggled helplessly, or Bud would squeeze Colton&#39;s leg during a  <br/>
particularly intense moment. They were totally connected to each  <br/>
other through their movie experience, and it was a joy to watch. I  <br/>
knew that they were making a memory together.<br/>
<br/>
We had cable reinstalled the next day, and we never looked back. We  <br/>
don&#39;t watch a lot of TV, but when we do, we do it together. We have  <br/>
laughed and cried together as we have watched, and we have wondered  <br/>
and marveled. Television has been a wonderful learning experience for  <br/>
me. It taught me to loosen up, and to appreciate those wonderful  <br/>
moments when I cocoon with my family. And when I watch my husband and  <br/>
son stomping around the house like Godzilla as they destroy Tokyo, I  <br/>
know that I am standing on holy ground.<br/>

favorite songs...she also loves to read books the are of the same<br/>
subject matter as the favorite shows and movies...so neither my<br/>
husband or I  feel she is being stunted, so we use TV as another<br/>
tool...it is a part of the culture around us...so we use it to our<br/>
advantage...This is just my thought on the TV issue...Take it as you<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Are you not interacting with him while he watches? I&#39;m often in the <br/>
same room with my dd (5) while she watches tv. Sometimes I watch <br/>
with her, sometimes I work on my own projects nearby. That lets me <br/>
follow along with her interests, answer her questions, recite the <br/>
appropriate lines when she wants to play a scene from a movie. We <br/>
sometimes play games while watching tv. Or she&#39;ll play or jump or <br/>
climb or spin while watching. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t always enjoy the same shows Mo does, but its worth it to me <br/>
to share her interests and discover ways to offer her more ideas and <br/>
options based on those interests. We have a whole set of board games <br/>
that she enjoys based on &quot;Diego&quot; now, and a stack of computer games <br/>
based on &quot;Dora&quot; - probably my two *least* favorite shows. We&#39;ve <br/>
talked about building new things for her to climb and swing on based <br/>
on watching those shows. That&#39;s a topic that wouldn&#39;t even have come <br/>
up if I hadn&#39;t been right there in the room during an episode, <br/>
though, or if I were thinking about them in terms of &quot;trash&quot; rather <br/>
than &quot;something my kid enjoys&quot;.<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he is choosing to watch tv instead of going outdoors or doing  <br/>
other things with his family then, yes indeedy, he DOES prefer it.<br/>
<br/>
So - join him in what HE chooses. All kinds of talk about how much he  <br/>
watches, but not a word about what he loves to watch? Get INTO it  <br/>
with him. Don&#39;t judge it - revel in it.<br/>
<br/>
When my now-about-to-turn-16-year-old was younger and madly in love  <br/>
with the Arthur tv show, she&#39;d watch for hours every day. I watched  <br/>
with her pretty often - we cuddled and sometimes she&#39;d tell me what  <br/>
was going to happen (Watch, Mommy, DW is going to tell a LIE!!!).  <br/>
Over a period of a couple of years, I bought her all the little  <br/>
Arthur books and an Arthur lunch box to keep them in. We bought the  <br/>
Arthur dolls. And we ran into a phone number for the author, Marc  <br/>
Brown, where he would leave a recorded message about how he got the  <br/>
ideas for his books or what books were coming up, etc. We got a  <br/>
cassette tape of music from the show.<br/>
<br/>
Guess what? I didn&#39;t really like the show all that much. I learned to  <br/>
see it through my daughters&#39; eyes and appreciate it, but it really  <br/>
didn&#39;t appeal to me, for various reasons. But, now, it is a sweet  <br/>
memory - those warm cuddly mornings together with Arthur and his  <br/>
friends. I&#39;d give a lot to get to have one of those mornings back,  <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
This is good practice for you -- learn to support your child where he  <br/>
is NOW. Support his interests with your whole heart and you&#39;ll be  <br/>
rewarded by your child growing into a person who HAS passions and  <br/>
interests and shares them with you.<br/>

as much as they do, but I do spend hours and hours at the computer.  I <br/>
don&#39;t see more screen time as less of anything else.  we like to go <br/>
outside and play sports, we live much of our lives outdoors.  Being <br/>
outside is fun, screens are fun, one is not better than the other.  We <br/>
played ultimate frisbee with 20 other people in the wind and rain last <br/>
night, it was really fun, it&#39;s not fun for people who don&#39;t like <br/>
frisbee, wind, rain, or night games, but as players we chose it and <br/>
that made all the difference.  The soccer guys who share the field with <br/>
us called off their game and I overheard swearing as they packed up and <br/>
left.  We stayed and had a blast.<br/>

&quot;Regulate&quot; in that context means to make rules and then follow them.<br/>
Making intelligent choices isn&#39;t the same as &quot;self regulation.&quot;<br/>
I think it&#39;s a much better goal, to be thoughtful and to consider  <br/>
factors.<br/>

When you&#39;re driving, the glass in front of you can be called a  <br/>
windscreen.  Americans usually call it &quot;wind shield.&quot;  But is that  <br/>
screen time?<br/>
<br/>
I think you should call things computer, tv, movie, etch-a-sketch.   <br/>
But even computer, sometimes I&#39;m watching movies, sometimes I&#39;m  <br/>
writing.  Sometimes I&#39;m reading e-mail or looking at  my kids&#39;  <br/>
MySpace.  Sometimes I&#39;m shopping.  Sometimes it&#39;s research (quite a  <br/>
bit lately, reading in and about 16th century Bibles in English,  <br/>
early editions of The Book of Common Prayer).  So I can&#39;t even call  <br/>
it &quot;computer time&quot; as though it&#39;s all the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Kirby is playing World of Warcraft.  It&#39;s partly keyboard,  <br/>
and partly talking to his team on a headset.<br/>
Sometimes he&#39;s playing Guitar Hero, with the guitar controller.<br/>
Sometimes he&#39;s playing stand-up-and-move Wii games.<br/>
<br/>
Are those three &quot;screen time&quot;?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; If he is choosing to watch tv instead of going outdoors or doing<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wanted to make a few comments on that general idea, and add some  <br/>
reminders.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Moms of young children are tired sometimes, and sometimes young  <br/>
themselves, and sometimes they&#39;re jealous of their children&#39;s  <br/>
happiness.  Occasionally a mom will have a little fit of petulance.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes moms say &quot;He prefers [something] to being with *moi*!&quot; and  <br/>
it can be an indicator of one or more things people have &#39;fessed up  <br/>
to in the past or that I&#39;ve felt myself.<br/>
<br/>
--The mom is remembering childhood &quot;NO&quot; and other shaming from her  <br/>
own life, and feeling the urge to channel that.<br/>
--The mom is avoiding feeling a little guilty because she hasn&#39;t  <br/>
thought of anything really cool to do for a while.<br/>
--The mom is feeling that unschooling might be a little harder than  <br/>
she&#39;d thought, and she really WILL have to be fun.<br/>
--The mom had a fantasy of how the child would be, and the child is  <br/>
RUDELY not reading her mind and complying.<br/>
--The mom is emotional about something altogether different and is in  <br/>
danger of taking it out on an innocent child.<br/>
<br/>
Little kids might not see &quot;going outdoors&quot; as a goal in and of  <br/>
itself.  They don&#39;t have the voices of grandmothers in them saying  <br/>
&quot;Get some fresh air,&quot; or whatever, and that&#39;s probably good.  If  <br/>
there&#39;s something very cool happening outside, they might want to go  <br/>
out for the cool thing, but not just for the sake of the outside.   <br/>
Sometimes moms have checklists and will feel like a better mom if the  <br/>
kid&#39;s &quot;had recess&quot; or maybe the mom is thinking &quot;PE&quot; (&quot;physical  <br/>
education,&quot; which was once a big deal in American schools, and now  <br/>
less so).<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere in there the mom&#39;s voices and visions are coming between  <br/>
her and her child&#39;s immediate interests and happiness.<br/>
<br/>
IF a mom tries to lure a child away from the TV just to do it, that  <br/>
can be good or bad.  If a refusal is going to make her feel rejected  <br/>
and angry, that&#39;s probably more about the mom&#39;s neediness than the  <br/>
child&#39;s.  If the mom wants to play outside and can make it aluring  <br/>
and fun, that&#39;s a great idea, unless the mom plans it to interrupt a  <br/>
child&#39;s favorite show, and will sulk and complain if the answer&#39;s  <br/>
no.    If the mom plans a really fantastic thing out of the house,  <br/>
that&#39;s really fantastic!  Ice skating, a movie, an amusement park,  <br/>
swimming!  But if the plan is about separating the child from a  <br/>
favorite show, and not about ice skating, movies, rides or swimming,  <br/>
then it&#39;s not fantastic, it&#39;s mean.<br/>
<br/>
Offer to record the favorite show, if you want to do something else.   <br/>
Sometimes the child won&#39;t even watch the recording, but you&#39;ve given  <br/>
him flexibility and respect.   Flexibility and respect are way better  <br/>
than &quot;outside&quot; for the sake of checklisting &quot;he went outside today.&quot;   <br/>
And with flexibility and respect, you&#39;ll get more &quot;outside&quot; and more  <br/>
happiness and joy than if you scheduled &quot;outside,&quot; and controlled the  <br/>
TV, because you can&#39;t schedule or control happiness or joy.<br/>
<br/>
You can work on your own happiness and joy, though. And moms who are  <br/>
short in that department shouldn&#39;t depend on their children to  <br/>
provide it. Some moms seem to act like if they&#39;re unhappy it&#39;s their  <br/>
children&#39;s fault.   If you have the least smidgen of that feeling,  <br/>
work to undo it.  It&#39;s a codependency that can drag your whole family  <br/>
into a hole, or worse, into individual and unconnected holes.<br/>

No one needs to direct the learning.   There are easy ways to make  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525192375">My daughter is almost four and has never had any television<br/>
restriction.   She likes to watch a lot of different things, but is<br/>
constantly in motion and playing games while it is on.  If she&#39;s<br/>
really into something, and would rather watch it than go out, we <br/>
bring the portable DVD player with us so she can finish up in the car<br/>
on the way.  By the time we get up to the car and buckled in, she&#39;s<br/>
usually forgotten or is not interested anymore.  But she has the<br/>
option. We&#39;ve started so many adventures with something gleaned from<br/>
watching tv together.  The discovery of falcons and getting to meet<br/>
one live came from a Stuart Little movie. <br/>
<br/>
I had big tv restrictions as a kid.  If I wanted to watch a show, I<br/>
had to have it pre-approved.  If it was approved, I had to give a<br/>
report on it afterwards.  So basically I snuck tv to avoid this.  I<br/>
probably should have all sorts of issues around tv but amazingly I<br/>
don&#39;t. Yay!  As a kid, I read a lot, but even that was restricted by<br/>
imposed bedtimes and school, which seriously got in the way.  My<br/>
issues seem to be centered around that restriction - If I like what<br/>
I&#39;m reading I can&#39;t put it down, as though I&#39;m afraid it will<br/>
disappear and I won&#39;t get a second chance to get to the end.  Yes, I<br/>
have MAJOR self-regulation issues regarding books.<br/>
<br/>
My husband had absolutely no restrictions whatsoever regarding<br/>
television or movies in his family.  He has a very strong desire to<br/>
watch television/movies and read books undistracted, but is super fun<br/>
to be around because he can quote from pretty much any movie ever<br/>
made. Like someone who has studied the Bible and has some scripture to<br/>
back up whatever he says. He has always listened to music a lot, too,<br/>
the same albums over and over.  He can sing songs he&#39;s heard just<br/>
once, pitch perfect without any musical training.  Someone<br/>
mentioned Christopher Lee, yep well DH has been reading The<br/>
Silmarillion at least once a year as long as I&#39;ve known him, probably<br/>
longer.  It really makes him happy.  He spends a lot of time staring<br/>
at strange holes in the ground and collects bits of rust.  If I only<br/>
saw that aspect of him I&#39;d think he might need psychological help. <br/>
But he&#39;s gathering information for the amazing art he makes. He loves<br/>
to play video games, which he claims give him a better sense of<br/>
direction.  (My thumbs hurt too much when I try to play so I don&#39;t,<br/>
and I have a terrible sense of direction.) He plays with legos a lot,<br/>
even as an adult, and claims that is why he took to Apple&#39;s GarageBand<br/>
software so quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the motion to sit down with your son and watch what he&#39;s<br/>
watching.  Talk about it.  See what interests him.  Make some<br/>
connections in the world from what he is watching. It will be really<br/>
rewarding.</div>

&gt; Hello everyone, hope you can help me here.<br/>
&gt;  I know I may incur everyone&#39;s wrath but my husband and I put the TV<br/>
&gt;  away when we realised our then 2-year old son was wanting to do<br/>
&gt;  nothing all day but watch it. It was an interesting experiment as we<br/>
&gt;  ourselves had never been without TV and I noticed (a) that TV eats<br/>
&gt;  time, which I no longer have in vast quantities as I did before having<br/>
&gt;  children and (b) I missed surprisingly little of it... in fact I felt<br/>
&gt;  relieved at no longer being tempted to watch trash.<br/>
&gt;  Then my huband, suffering film withdrawal symptoms, bought a DVD<br/>
&gt;  player meant just for the 2 of us.<br/>
&gt;  A few months ago he showed it to my now 4-year old.<br/>
&gt;  So the DVD player is now my son&#39;s favourite toy. He wakes up in the<br/>
&gt;  morning, and asks to watch a DVD. He comes home after an outing, and<br/>
&gt;  asks for it again. He won&#39;t eat, drink or do anything but watch. This<br/>
&gt;  is worring because he is already a pretty thin boy.<br/>
&gt;  He watches the same thing over and over again, studying it. OK, so<br/>
&gt;  he&#39;s learning Hairy Mclairy off by heart and yes, having dipped into<br/>
&gt;  your ideas, Sandra, though I admit I haven&#39;t had time to read your<br/>
&gt;  work properly, we&#39;ve let him watch as unrestricted as we dare because<br/>
&gt;  who are we to say what he is and isn&#39;t getting from it?<br/>
&gt;  But it feels a bit like having offered my lovely boy an open Pandora&#39;s<br/>
&gt;  box. Yesterday I cracked a bit, which I regret. (I guess I did an<br/>
&gt;  impersonation of my own mother falling apart, although I didn&#39;t go as<br/>
&gt;  far as to shove a sponge in his hand with instructions to do something<br/>
&gt;  useful and wash the car, but perhaps that&#39;s because I don&#39;t have a <br/>
&gt; car.)<br/>
&gt;  I do need some advice from you about what you think is going to happen<br/>
&gt;  to this obsessive viewing. He is only 4. I feel I am losing my son to<br/>
&gt;  the screen. We used to play games together, but he&#39;s lost interest.<br/>
&gt;  And don&#39;t say, &#39;he&#39;ll lose interest in what he&#39;s watching and want to<br/>
&gt;  reconnect with you&#39;because he&#39;s smart enough to know there are lots<br/>
&gt;  more DVDs in the library full of new interest. Each new DVD brings<br/>
&gt;  about an 8-hour daily viewing schedule.<br/>
&gt;  I am also worried about the effect on me. I&#39;m getting used to not<br/>
&gt;  bothering looking after him any more.<br/>
&gt;  I&#39;m not convinced he&#39;s going to regulate himself. Or at least, not to<br/>
&gt;  anything less than hours a day.<br/>
&gt;  And the other worry I have is that he prefers a life in front a screen<br/>
&gt;  now than he does his life outdoors and interacting with his family.<br/>
&gt;  Sorry if I sound grumpy. I&#39;m probably just a bit scared. Anyone with<br/>
&gt;  experience of this issue?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Thanks everyone for your views. I realise I have been quite unpopular<br/>
but I can take it!<br/>
Answers to a few questions:<br/>
- Why don&#39;t I study this issue in depth - because I have a baby and<br/>
time is very short esp on the computer. I figured a post to this group<br/>
wd be a quick way to get info and thanks to everyone who provided that<br/>
and useful links.<br/>
- do I consider looking after him a &#39;bother&#39; - not sure that&#39;s what I<br/>
implied when I wrote that I&#39;ve been tempted not to bother looking<br/>
after him. With a baby demanding all my attention it can be very<br/>
convenient to let the older child sit in front of TV.<br/>
- yes I bring him snacks and he doesn&#39;t eat them nor does he drink<br/>
water. He doesn&#39;t hear me when I speak to him. He is totally focused<br/>
on the DVD.<br/>
- he doesn&#39;t play and do other things while watching. It looks as if<br/>
some children do but my son doesn&#39;t multi-task in front of the DVD.<br/>
Someone said not believing a child could watch 3 films in a row - my<br/>
son will watch the same film again and again, as I said, studying it,<br/>
learning it by heart.<br/>
- Don&#39;t I sit and watch with him - yes, but not all afternoon.<br/>
- why haven&#39;t I mentioned any of the shows he loves - yes, I did,<br/>
Hairy McLairy, perhaps not familiar to you in the US?<br/>
<br/>
- I see the points being made about mother&#39;s resentment of a child&#39;s<br/>
pleasure/attention-seeking/ etc. These are all useful reminders, thank<br/>
you Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
- Any thoughts on the physical effects of watching lots of TV? I&#39;m<br/>
talking - posture, eyesight, exposure to electrical field, lack of<br/>
exercise/fresh air. When he&#39;s exhausted from hours of watching he lies<br/>
down and looks at the screen sideways and close up. He also won&#39;t go<br/>
to bed.<br/>
<br/>
I should probably add that he has been low-level ill for a while.<br/>
Whether he is ill because of this DVD regime or whether being ill has<br/>
made him more interested in watching the DVD is something I&#39;m<br/>
currently pondering. <br/>
<br/>
As for not asking him to switch off but doing something he finds such<br/>
fun he&#39;ll switch off on his own... fine, but what about going to bed?<br/>
If you say, just you go to bed and he&#39;ll go in his own time... fine<br/>
again, but what about brushing his teeth and putting his pyjamas on,<br/>
for which he needs us? At some point we just have to intervene. Or<br/>
don&#39;t we? <br/>

<br/>
Everyone here who has two or more children took care of an older  <br/>
child while there was a baby.<br/>
<br/>
If you think of his TV watching as being all about you though (your  <br/>
convenience, in the paragraph above), you&#39;re still not looking at him.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s enjoying what he&#39;s doing, don&#39;t feel guilty about it.  If he  <br/>
likes what he&#39;s watching, be glad of that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-f you say, just you go to bed and he&#39;ll go in his own time... fine<br/>

<br/>
Do that before you go to bed, and let him keep watching after his  <br/>
teeth are brushed and his pajamas are on, I&#39;d say.<br/>
<br/>
-=-At some point we just have to intervene. Or don&#39;t we? -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Intervene&quot; puts what he&#39;s doing in a bad light, and you&#39;re his  <br/>
savior from the bad thing.<br/>
If you were to think of it as &quot;At some point we can help him,&quot; I&#39;d  <br/>
think &quot;Sure, at EVERY point you can help him.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It seems you&#39;ve cast the situation in an antagonistic way instead of  <br/>
in a cooperative way.<br/>
<br/>
I have these further suggestions:<br/>

<br/>
The answer at our house is not intervening about tv. However Jayn is so<br/>
hugely busy all the time while watching, and so clearly &quot;cross-pollinating&quot;<br/>
what she sees and hears from tv into her other games. There were times when<br/>
she would watch the same thing over and over and over without respite when<br/>
younger, but she never had to fear that the tv would be off if she left the<br/>
room for a moment. <br/>
<br/>
In fact, as I now recall, she insisted that her program stay on if she<br/>
stepped out, so that she could come back to it at will, until with maturity<br/>
she started to understand the dvd/tivo technology and concept of &quot;pause&quot;<br/>
better. That let her relax a lot more. It seemed like her true internal<br/>
cognizance of what &quot;pausing a program&quot; meant to her freedom to do other<br/>
stuff came later than the superficial intellectual knowledge of it. Does<br/>
that make sense? <br/>
<br/>
Maybe the better question is &quot;how can mom accomplish the things that are<br/>
important to her while still supporting son&#39;s desire to watch with<br/>
concentration&quot;? If you really can&#39;t let go of the idea that pajamas are<br/>
essential for sleep (Jayn wears hers like clothes a lot of the time) maybe<br/>
helping him slip them on during the closing credits, or during a less<br/>
crucial montage earlier would help you relax.<br/>
<br/>
If he isn&#39;t eating the food you are bringing, maybe it is the wrong food. Is<br/>
it really easy to eat finger food, or does it require his attention to work<br/>
spoons and not drip? Is it what he really likes? My dd&#39;s preferences change<br/>
a lot. Is it stuff that can safely sit for a while and still be appetizing?<br/>
What about something other than water to drink, with some more nutrition in<br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
We have found that trying to control Jayn&#39;s tooth brushing results in less<br/>
tooth brushing. Maybe if you announce that you are going to do yours, and<br/>
invite him to do his again during the credits, between shows or at some time<br/>
that is easy to leave.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn likes the dolls, toys, books and activities that refer to her favorite<br/>
shows. In the absence of dolls of characters from movies Jayn plans on<br/>
modifying Barbies or other dolls to be those characters. Recently, for<br/>
example, I sewed dresses for one of her fashion dolls in the style of &quot;Room<br/>
With a View&quot; (early 1900&#39;s). Maybe he would feel really supported if he was<br/>
given an action figure, doll, picture book, whatever that referred to his<br/>
favorite program. <br/>
<br/>
When Jayn is focused and I need her to hear me, I put my hand on her<br/>
shoulder. I also ask her what she heard me say, especially if it is<br/>
important.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he is escaping from his real life to fantasy at the moment, perhaps<br/>
because of the new baby intruder. Even if this is the case being acceptant<br/>
of that need, painful as it may be to mom, can only be better than fighting<br/>
it which won&#39;t make it go away any quicker.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-788168957">What if you made a nest for him near the television? What if you waited <br/>
until whatever video he was watching had ended, or gotten to a lull and <br/>
asked him to come and brush his teeth and get his pyjamas on and then got <br/>
out a sleeping bag or a duvet or whatever and set up a little bed for him in <br/>
front of the television so that if he fell asleep in front of the television <br/>
he&#39;d be comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t going to last forever. I don&#39;t know how long it has been going on, <br/>
(the full 4 months since your partner showed your son the DVD player?), but <br/>
it isn&#39;t going to last forever. Nothing does &lt;g&gt;. But his enjoyment of <br/>
television and DVDs will probably also never go away (unless we are using a <br/>
geologic time frame). And if you can come to your son, if you can make the <br/>
effort to see this as a part of him and because it is a part of him <br/>
something that can only be good or loved or valuable, a point will come when <br/>
the 8 hour marathons will subside to 6 hour marathons or 4 hour marathons or <br/>
2 hour marathons. He will find other things to do while the Hairy Maclary <br/>
plays in the background, he will find the bathroom when he needs it. But <br/>
while he is focused on this thing, help him, pay attention to those things <br/>
that he is not.<br/>
<br/>
There was a post on unschoolingbasics the other day that talked about how <br/>
controlling/limiting access to world of warcraft was a parent reacting from <br/>
the belief that the world is a scary place and that parents need to run <br/>
interception to keep the world safe. You write a lot from a fearful place. <br/>
You talk about how your son is already a thin child and can&#39;t possibly <br/>
survive the television watching, as if he would choose to starve when you <br/>
placed yummy things near to hand. You talk about intervention as if this <br/>
were something from which he needs rescuing. This is Hairy Maclary, a video <br/>
about a dog and his dog friends and his enemy Scarface Claw, not heroin, not <br/>
a machine gun, not a pedophile. You talk about being fearful that his <br/>
enjoyment of this video will lead to you neglecting him. That is a really <br/>
telling thing that worry. To be afraid that because he has found something <br/>
that doesn&#39;t require your full attention that you will become a neglectful <br/>
parent. You can change. You can reach out to this son of yours and find a <br/>
way to mother him while he is fascinated. You can offer up food and drink <br/>
and bathroom breaks and bedding and cuddles and company. You can buy a gym <br/>
ball for him to sit on and play with while he watches so that he isn&#39;t all <br/>
still. If you see his neck is hurting you can get a little lotion and give <br/>
him a neck rub. You can find some toys he&#39;s always liked or coloring books <br/>
and put them where he is so that he can choose to muli-task if he so <br/>
desires. This is his passion at this moment. And it is your gift to him to <br/>
help him to follow his passion however intensely he desires in this moment. <br/>
And if you do that, he will trust that you will be there for him for all of <br/>
his passions and not be afraid that any thing he enjoys will be taken away <br/>
from him again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-700231432">Quoting Sandra Dodd &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a>&gt;:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Moms of young children are tired sometimes, and sometimes young  <br/>
&gt; themselves, and sometimes they&#39;re jealous of their children&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; happiness.  Occasionally a mom will have a little fit of petulance.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, Oh, Oh!! I remember being a kid, ordered around by my parents and the<br/>
longing to be the grownup, so I could sit in my LazyBoy and order around my<br/>
minions... sometimes Hayden&#39;s requests come into my head as my dad, ordering me<br/>
around and I get pissy about &quot;my turn to be waited upon&quot; -- THEN, because I&#39;ve<br/>
invited the voices of more experienced unschoolers/respectful mamas into my<br/>
head, I realize Hayden won&#39;t grow up with that resentment and THAT is the best<br/>
thing I can give to him & to his future chidren!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Offer to record the favorite show, if you want to do something else.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A Tivo/DVR has been a big sanity saver &#39;round here :)  TV shows can be watched<br/>
together while we snuggle up together (like last night) & they&#39;re completely<br/>
available to him when I&#39;ve got something else to do (like right now, I&#39;m on his<br/>
computer and he&#39;s watching Malcom in the Middle)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes the child won&#39;t even watch the recording, but you&#39;ve given  <br/>
&gt; him flexibility and respect.   Flexibility and respect are way better  <br/>
&gt; than &quot;outside&quot; for the sake of checklisting &quot;he went outside today.&quot;   <br/>
&gt; And with flexibility and respect, you&#39;ll get more &quot;outside&quot; and more  <br/>
&gt; happiness and joy than if you scheduled &quot;outside,&quot; and controlled the  <br/>
&gt; TV, because you can&#39;t schedule or control happiness or joy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unlike winters past, we&#39;ve got NO snow so riding his new bike from Santa is a<br/>
big treat :)  SpongeBob is recorded, so he doesn&#39;t feel like he&#39;s missing<br/>
anything by taking advantage of our miraculous brown outdoors :)  Mom being<br/>
supportive of both of those activities leaves a lot of room for Joy and less<br/>
room for Angst and Resentment.  <br/>
<br/>
My own recent confession: Hayden asked me to watch a Pooh movie and I said I&#39;d<br/>
rather pull out my teeth with pliers -- Luckily, he had more enthusiastic<br/>
company and I was with unschoolers who were quick to call me on my bad attitude.<br/>
 Hayden later brought it up to me (which could/should have been a complaint, but<br/>
was more of a commentary) on the long drive home -- the end result was a<br/>
reminder to us both that HE & US (our relationship) is FAR more important than<br/>
my pissy &#39;tude about new Pooh... Also a great reminder to me what a blessing it<br/>
is to have a kid who actually *does* want to hang out with me and share his Joy<br/>
with *me* -- I need to step back and see myself as the mom he loves to be with;<br/>
the mom who happily embraces what makes him smile and think and express himSelf.<br/>
 There are FAR too many mommies who don&#39;t like their kids and kids who don&#39;t<br/>
like their mommies -- We&#39;re not on that path, as long as I remember how easily<br/>
it is to go there AND how easily we can avoid it!  <br/>
