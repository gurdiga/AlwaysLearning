You are in luck.  The Explore-A-College program that my daughter <br/>
attended last summer was in Richmond, Indiana, at Earlham College.  <br/>
It was fabulous.  And it is a very homeschool friendly program for 14-<br/>
18 year olds who are thinking about going to college.  Here is the <br/>
url for more on this program: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.earlham.edu/~eac/">http://www.earlham.edu/~eac/</a><br/>
<br/>
And the camping area where our UU teens camped is also in Indiana, at <br/>
Whitewater Memorial State Park&#39;s reserved group camping area.  And <br/>
the great high ropes course the teens attended was just across the <br/>
border at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio.  You would have to <br/>
organize this yourself, but we found that it was easily done, far <br/>
more flexible and far less expensive than a week at that other camp. <br/>
Here are the urls:  <br/>

I am sure there are more opportunities in Indiana, but these are the <br/>
ones we have experienced.<br/>

The are in which we camped was the Youth Tent Area, which is very <br/>
nice and very economical:<br/>
<br/>
Youth Tent Areas /$2.00 per person - <br/>
* groups of 10 or more with campers under 21 years and their adult <br/>
leaders. <br/>
* available to public, semi-public and not-for-profit groups only. <br/>
* tent camping only <br/>
* fire rings/picnic tables <br/>
* pit toilets (no showers or restrooms) <br/>
* drinking water supply near campground <br/>
* $20.00 deposit which will be credited toward total bill.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s only $14 per camper for a full week!<br/>

The Outdoor Pursuit Center, for one full day, was also quite <br/>
reasonable with a group rate:<br/>

This would be a great campout for a homeschool group to put together, <br/>
or for someone to organize and just put on a bunch of lists, for a <br/>
long weekend, or a week, or whatever suits the group.  <br/>

You&#39;ve said your piece, several times. It made me think the first time. If <br/>
my son *wanted* to go, I&#39;d be looking more carefully at the whole thing. I <br/>
might not have before because I&#39;ve known and known about so many kids who <br/>
found it a wonderful experience. But reading essentially the same story the <br/>
third time in a few days, I started wondering about the other side of the <br/>
story because you&#39;ve been so strident about it. So flogging it the way you <br/>
have been here, and apparently elsewhere, is turning at least one person <br/>
away from your views.<br/>

Exactly which views are you referring to?  That folks should exercise <br/>
certain caution when they send their kids to camp?  That folks should <br/>
ascertain if there is any kind of safety net or process for problems <br/>
that arise at camp?  That folks can find many different options that <br/>
will suit many homeschoolers and unschoolers?  That just because a <br/>
camp calls itself an &quot;unschooling&quot; camp that it is not necessary the <br/>
right place for every unschooler?  Or that I question the authority <br/>
of someone who purports expertise in &quot;unschooling&quot; who has never <br/>
homeschooled, or unschooled, anyone?  <br/>

 I don&#39;t think any of Sandra&#39;s kids have ever been there, so I don&#39;t think <br/>
it&#39;s her cow.  She&#39;s the owner of the list, and I&#39;m a moderator.  I agree with <br/>
her that this issue has gone beyond what&#39;s appropriate for this list.  I was <br/>
interested in hearing yoru account, and had some non-burning questions, but I <br/>
