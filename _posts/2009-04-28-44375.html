<div id="ygrps-yiv-967858345">Jon Kream once wrote, &quot;The thing I like most about hanging out with  <br/>
unschoolers is we never<br/>
have &#39;small talk&#39; - there are never any  conversations about the  <br/>
price of<br/>
gas or when you last mowed your lawn, or the weather.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I like best about the Always Learning list, too.  I&#39;m  <br/>
grateful to all of you who help keep it so rich and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hosting a symposium on unschooling in Santa Fe in January 2010.   <br/>
I&#39;ve been hesitant on putting out a big push, because I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
create any conflict with other things that have already been  <br/>
planned.  I&#39;ve been &quot;laying low,&quot; but I do have a contract with the  <br/>
facility and a headful of ideas and plans.  The connection with this  <br/>
list is that although anyone who attends will get to participate, my  <br/>
main guests will be Pam Sorooshian, Joyce Fetteroll, and all of my  <br/>
family and theirs&#39;. The dads&#39; session will have Cyrus Sorooshian   <br/>
(his first name sounds like his last name, not like American &quot;Cyrus,&quot;  <br/>
but like SoROOS Sorooshian; it&#39;s pretty), Carl Fetteroll, and Keith  <br/>
Dodd.  Other dads too, with other experiences, but as a core group,  <br/>
this is good.<br/>
<br/>
Because space is limited, if you decide your family is serious about  <br/>
wanting to attend, please let me know.  It will help with planning.    <br/>
The site is a former time-share condominium complex on the north side  <br/>
of Santa Fe, on the road to the ski basin, within walking distance of  <br/>
the plaza, called Fort Marcy Condo Suites Hotel.     Please don&#39;t try  <br/>
to make reservations yet or you&#39;ll mess us up--they&#39;ll go through a  <br/>
link on my site when we&#39;re nearer the time, but I have a contract so  <br/>
don&#39;t worry.  We&#39;ll have 39 units, mostly two-bedrooms, with the  <br/>
possibility of adding a few more if those fill up.  There is an  <br/>
overflow hotel possibility at the same rates.<br/>
<br/>
It might seem ironic, but the site isn&#39;t an indoorsy carpeted hotel,  <br/>
and there are stairs, and there might be snow, and we only have  <br/>
smallish meeting spaces, so this isn&#39;t an ideal event for families  <br/>
with small children.   It&#39;s better for families with teens, or (yes,  <br/>
brace yourselves) for parents without their kids.   It might be great  <br/>
for a couple of dads, or a few moms, to come without the families.   <br/>
Or if you bring small children, plan to bring someone to do something  <br/>
fun with them during the sessions (or to stay in the condo with them  <br/>
or to go visit Kirby&#39;s place and play games or something).  There  <br/>
WILL be families, and lots of teens, but the focus is on exploring  <br/>
the ideas and philosophy of unschooling.  And the main attraction is  <br/>
Santa Fe itself.  I don&#39;t want to schedule so much that people don&#39;t  <br/>
get to explore the town some!  We&#39;ll be walking distance from the  <br/>
plaza.  Easy walk down there, not as easy coming back up the hill,  <br/>
but it&#39;s certainly doable for the  young and strong, and old folks  <br/>
like me might be able to call for a ride.  Driving, even easier.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m partly sorry to talk about this here because I know most of you  <br/>
won&#39;t go, but the benefit to this list should be noticeable.  Even  <br/>
though I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a better unschooling list available,  <br/>
after some of us get to share our very best ideas in person, and when  <br/>
dozens have had the experience of meeting some of the others who  <br/>
write here and getting to observe and speak with some of their teens,  <br/>
we&#39;ll all have more knowledge as it&#39;s shared back onto this list and  <br/>
discussed some more.<br/>
<br/>
Every conference has this effect, but this symposium will focus on  <br/>
the depth of why unschooling works, and on what has been learned by  <br/>
families with teens who were parented so differently.<br/>
<br/>
It is possible, but not definite, that Schuyler Waynforth and her  <br/>
husband David will also be guests of the conference.    When that&#39;s  <br/>
known for sure, it will be stated here, but I won&#39;t harp on the  <br/>
symposium on this list at all.  The gathering clues and details are  <br/>
here:<br/>

<br/>
While I&#39;m excited about the symposium (which I&#39;m calling &quot;suss&quot;-- <br/>
which can mean to figure something out in one&#39;s own way), I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to cause disappointment in those who can&#39;t even consider  <br/>
attending, and so I&#39;ll try to shush about it here now.<br/>
