New Mexico too!  I don&#39;t know the range of it, but in Albuquerque it&#39;s <br/>
between 9:15 and 11:00, the best parts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-696599679">I have been looking forward to this lunar eclipse for quite a while now, <br/>
and although the day dawned bright and clear (first time in a while), it&#39;s <br/>
now completely overcast and we&#39;re supposed to get a dunking.  But, I&#39;m <br/>
going out there anyway if it&#39;s not raining to see if there might be some <br/>
breaks in the clouds I can see our copper-colored moon through <br/>
tonight.  Last night, the moon was full and bright and completely <br/>
unobstructed.<br/>
<br/>
So, all you folks with clear skies tonight, enjoy the sky show tonight!  It <br/>
should be really pretty!<br/>

One year we drove and drove fast to see a comet because we were racing <br/>
clouds.  Drove about 60 miles into the darker country and saw it BEAUTIFULLY <br/>
and then saw the clouds come over it after a while.  Good memory.  Keith, me, <br/>
and three little-little kids.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, New Mexico rarely clouds over, and now that satellite photos are <br/>
quickly available online, we would know which way to drive without guessing!  <br/>
Good old dry skies with there clear delineations between clouds!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s overcast here today so we might just be looking at clouds.  We won&#39;t<br/>
get the full eclipse here but it still seems like a good reason to take<br/>
some cookies and hot chocolate,  drive up into the hills and find a good<br/>
place to watch the moon rise.<br/>
<br/>
I hope your clouds all blow away.<br/>

clear night so we&#39;ll just keep watching.<br/>

directly west of us (about a 10 minute walk away) so we went to <br/>
&#39;Look Out Point&#39; to see it.  There were about 50 or so people out <br/>
there!  It was a regular lunar party!  It was so incredibly beautiful.<br/>
