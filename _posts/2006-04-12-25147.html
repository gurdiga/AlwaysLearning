<div id="ygrps-yiv-1356592741">This isn&#39;t about unschooling here for a minute, it&#39;s a side issue of  <br/>
the list.<br/>
<br/>
-=-maybe it would make a good set of posts for  reference-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so hard to find old posts on this list, that&#39;s why I started  <br/>
saving things.  I save two for every one that ever gets onto a  <br/>
webpage.  I keep webpages of good posts because it&#39;s easier for  <br/>
people to find them then than go through the list.<br/>
<br/>
The Unschooling Discussion list moved to google.com so that people  <br/>
can read through the archives better.  Probably some-to-lots of you  <br/>
are on that list as well as this one.<br/>
<br/>
Those who aren&#39;t on that one can (if you&#39;re in the mood, have time,  <br/>
care) look at what those archives look like, and how these look.   <br/>
Maybe try searching for something in there, like something you  <br/>
remember writing or reading.<br/>
<br/>
And the question is... should we consider moving this list to  <br/>
googlegroups?<br/>
If you want to write to me on the side my address is  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a>, or you can write here, but try to keep it in  <br/>
this subject line so people can ignore it if they don&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
DEFINITELY I wouldn&#39;t just move the list.  We had some problems doing  <br/>
that.  I&#39;d probably set up a couple of easy ways to get there and let  <br/>
each reader make the move or not.<br/>
<br/>
If lots of people are comfortable here, we could just stay here.<br/>
<br/>
A related question is...<br/>
Is there really any reason to have this list separate from  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion? Originally, it was a list for people who did  <br/>
want to be on a list with me, and who didn&#39;t mind moderation.  Now  <br/>
that one&#39;s more moderated than this one.   But even though original  <br/>
intents change, current realities might be comfortable enough that we  <br/>
leave things as they are.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Stay here/leave it alone?<br/>
Move?<br/>
Let this list go?<br/>
<br/>
No one should feel obligated to vote or even to care. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

beginning info, or a list for younger kids, check here:<br/>

a little store in a little town in New Hampshire.  He was bored one <br/>
day so just to see what would happen, he took a coffee can, taped a <br/>
piece of paper on it that said only &quot;GIVE&quot; written by hand, and he <br/>
set it out on his front steps.  Sure enough, people walking by <br/>
dropped money into the can, even though there was absolutely no <br/>
indication of what the money was being collected for!<br/>

Knowing stuff like this, one can better understand how some people <br/>
get elected to office!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1040241558">Here&#39;s what I have to say about this:<br/>
<br/>
  I rather like this list being separate from UD.  The tone is different,<br/>
and while I don&#39;t think I can really explain HOW it&#39;s different, it is, and<br/>
I like it.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m fine with the list staying here, or moving.  I do like being able to<br/>
search the archives more easily, and the move to Google was not difficult<br/>
for me...but I&#39;m not a moderator and was able to just delete all the whiny<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t like this&quot; posts.<br/>
<br/>
  I have not read UD at Google, so I can&#39;t speak to that.  However, since we<br/>
will be moving to the states and losing our email address, I might well be<br/>
reading lists at the &quot;source&quot; during the move.  I get frustrated doing that<br/>
at Yahoo, but that could be just me.<br/>

third response I&#39;ve read to the original, but I&#39;ve yet to receive the <br/>
original itself.  The UD mail has been coming chronologically since the <br/>
move to google.  <br/>
This is a nice group, keeping it would be okay, it&#39;s smaller than UD, <br/>
even if it has the same feel, it&#39;s more intimate, and you&#39;ve got my <br/>
blessing on letting something leave your already-full plate.  So I leave <br/>
you as muddled as I found you &lt;g&gt;<br/>

other people had with the switch.  My emails kept coming into my inbox and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The move doesn&#39;t matter much if you get individual posts. If you want  <br/>
to read on digest, google sucks. Threading doesn&#39;t work well because  <br/>
we don&#39;t all respond nice and neatly to only the subject heading -  <br/>
discussions grow out of various ideas and much of the time the  <br/>
heading is meaningless.<br/>
<br/>
So for me, I get this list individually, so it would be fine, but  <br/>
I&#39;ve pretty much stopped reading UD :(<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1341180273">I basically agree with Joanna. All of my groups, except UD, are at <br/>
yahoo groups, and since i read online only i dont deal with email at <br/>
all. (Still gotta delete those hundreds of msgs that got sent to my <br/>
inbox from UD before i changed my settings though!)But if others feel <br/>
strongly about moving to google, i&#39;ll follow. <br/>
<br/>
I kinda like Always Learning being separate from UD...as someone else <br/>
mentioned, its different, though i can&#39;t put my finger on why.<br/>

drives me crazy that they do not arrive in my email in order.  <br/>
<br/>
Google arrives in order, and I love that, so I read UD in my email <br/>
(sorted into its neat little folder), and all yahoo stuff on the <br/>
site.  I like Google, I would tentatively vote for that, but would <br/>
not be unhappy if it stayed here.  <br/>
<br/>
I appreciate all of you list owners and moderators and all of the <br/>
work that you do, I think whatever you decide is great.  <br/>

I think for those who are reading just a bit and think there&#39;s too  <br/>
much, reading the google list online is good!  It&#39;s quite like a  <br/>
message board, and I&#39;ve used it a couple of times to respond to  <br/>
something a few days old.  I can respond to things WEEKS old if I  <br/>
want. &lt;g&gt;  Maybe the people who are reading e-mail will wonder what  <br/>
I&#39;m talking about, but those reading by topics won&#39;t.  You can  <br/>
subscribe to topics.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>To add my voice, for what it&#39;s worth, if no one minds...<br/>
<br/>
I am signed up for digest mode on most of my subscribed lists.<br/>
<br/>
I find the digest mode easier to read for Google Groups because the <br/>
replies are sorted according to topic.  Plus there&#39;s a link to the <br/>
entire thread so that I can go back and check previous posts or <br/>
check new posts in that thread, reply to others, etc.<br/>
I also find it easier to read at the website because you can view <br/>
the topics as in tree format which helps to know who replied to what <br/>
poster and when.<br/>
<br/>
However, this list is not as overwhelming in message traffic as some <br/>
of the other lists (although it&#39;s been busy the past few days! &lt;g&gt;), <br/>
so I don&#39;t mind if it stays at Yahoo.  <br/>
<br/>
But in either case, I vote to maintain this list seperate from UD.  <br/>
It has its own distinctive tone,  and to me there&#39;s definitely a <br/>
separate &quot;voice&quot; UD.  <br/>
UD seems to me to be more about discussing helping unschooling work <br/>
better, while AL is more people who are doing unschooling and <br/>
sharing their experiences in it.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, that was still pretty muddy in explanation.  I tried!  :)<br/>
<br/>
And a mini-intro from me.  Sorry to tack it on but I&#39;ve been on most <br/>
of these lists over a year already and have been reading, reading, <br/>
reading, implementing more and more of the unschooling lifestyle and <br/>
am just now tentatively posting....<br/>
I&#39;m Terri (my online handle is usually Loon, both meanings of that --<br/>
 &quot;crazy as a&quot; and the beautiful birds).  I&#39;m able to stay at home <br/>
with my daughter who&#39;s almost 4.  My DH is in the military <br/>
(currently in Iraq, but due home soon!)  I enjoy reading at these <br/>
lists and getting help to further our unschooling life.<br/>
