My question for you today, I&#39;ve seen alot of posts on video games. Basically he would play video games non-stop, not eat, not drink, not sleep if we didn&#39;t make him, only *very* quick bathroom breaks. **<br/>

I think that the kids whose parents restrict videogames, even inconsistently, end up more desperately attached to playing.  We made the mistake of visiting James&#39; cousins on Easter, when they were restarting school the next day, with no Nintendo allowed during the week.  Believe me, they played all day (the last day of spring vacation), and we never saw their faces, except for an abbreviated meal when they were called to the table.  This was different from previous visits where gaming play had been broken up with occasional other activities.<br/>
