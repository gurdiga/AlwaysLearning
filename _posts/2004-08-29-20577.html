<div id="ygrps-yiv-1876451854">[Isn&#39;t it funny how we lose the meaning and purpose<br/>
of things? Weren&#39;t research reports originally<br/>
designed<br/>
for doing...um...research on stuff? :-D ]<br/>
<br/>
The way I interpret &quot;research report&quot; is writing up a<br/>
report on your research findings after you&#39;re done<br/>
researching.  I think that&#39;s why you were questioned<br/>
-- on an unschooling list -- as to the point and<br/>
purpose of having him write a &quot;report&quot;.  You hadn&#39;t<br/>
clarified, at that point, that it was your DS who<br/>
wanted to do this . . . it sounded to me like you were<br/>
giving him an &quot;assignment&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I second the Consumer Reports suggestion.  Heck, you<br/>
might even find an issue that is fairly current that<br/>
already contains ratings on electric scooters!  heh<br/>
heh<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, in response to your question above . . .<br/>
no, research *reports* weren&#39;t invented for *doing*<br/>
research but to report on your findings.  Up until<br/>
that point you&#39;ve got research &quot;data&quot; compiled.  :&#39;) <br/>
