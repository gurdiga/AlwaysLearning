<div id="ygrps-yiv-1454414786">Yesterday a man in our small town killed himself.<br/>
He was the brother in law of my good friend, and a man I&#39;ve known for<br/>
thirty years.  He had a painful childhood, served in Viet nam, managed<br/>
his pain with alcohol, alienated his wife and children and grand children<br/>
and died yesterday at the age of 50 in the front yard of a little house<br/>
on Main street.  <br/>
<br/>
My son and I were driving to the store and I saw him standing in the yard<br/>
and waved but he didn&#39;t see me.  As we were walking across the parking<br/>
lot I heard the shot, saw the smoke and thought, &quot;he&#39;s drunk again and<br/>
shooting at someone&#39;s dog.&quot;  I drove home up Higgins street so as to<br/>
avoid a drunk with a gun, not knowing he was there in the yard, dead.  <br/>
<br/>
Hug your kids today and fill their lives with joy.   Will could never<br/>
chase away all the terrible things he heard about himself as a child.  He<br/>
never stopped hearing his mother tell him he was a mistake.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567558463">Yesterday turned out to be such a good day.  We were supposed to meet<br/>
friends at a drop off point and ride with them to the melodrama (Dr.<br/>
Jeykle & Mr. Hyde), they were running 1/2 an hour late so by the time we<br/>
left we weren&#39;t going to make it before the curtain rose.  So we decided<br/>
that was ok and we&#39;d drive up anyway.  30 minutes later we got there to<br/>
find that we had the wrong day.<br/>
<br/>
So we turned around and went to this cool little store we had just<br/>
passed with some walnut orchards next door.  We all shopped for birthday<br/>
presents for me and the other mom (both birthdays are this month).  Then<br/>
we went next door and the kids cracked and ate walnuts.  So peaceful and<br/>
fun.<br/>
<br/>
Then back in the car and off to the tide pools.  We played on the beach<br/>
and chased sea gulls, had a picnic, then went to the natural history<br/>
museum and played there.  Then a cool little cafe, with hundreds of<br/>
antique cookie jars in it, for a snack and off home.<br/>
<br/>
Now if we can just remember what day we were supposed to be at the<br/>
melodrama!<br/>
<br/>
I love this list, no arguing, just unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
YES!! This is the best unschooling list...everyone seems to understand<br/>
the<br/>
principles so well.<br/>
And thanks for sharing a lovely day! Hope you get to your melodrama.<br/>

We are going this morning, in about 15 minutes as a matter of fact.<br/>
I&#39;ll post on how it was, I&#39;ve never been and I&#39;m excited (well so are<br/>
the kids, they were up and dressed this morning before I was even out of<br/>
the shower - that&#39;s a new one).<br/>
