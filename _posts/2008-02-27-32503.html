<div id="ygrps-yiv-450479401">I  want to  answer this email to a friend with a good response but I have too <br/>
many emotions right  now.. &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;. (This is a friend who *thinks* she&#39;s has  <br/>
an unschooling philosophy). It&#39;s  about a dance/get together/social type of <br/>
thing . Kids bring their own  music. They rented out a place. My son 11 1/2 is <br/>
excited to go and yet  knows noone who is attending. I asked her if her son was <br/>
going. <br/>
And she  said : &quot;I know  the two families who planned it. They have older teen<br/>
’s 14-18 range and were  originally trying to lure out some older teens for <br/>
their kids to get acquainted  with…but the response was poor in that age range <br/>
so they opened it up to 10 and  up… <br/>
In  a nut shell, I just feel it is a bit soon for my two for a dance/social… <br/>
and I’m  not mentally prepared to go there at this very moment! LOL!!!! All in <br/>
good  time! Adam is just 12 and Brenda at just 10 is way to young for a real  <br/>
“teen setting” with low lights dancing etc…. so I haven’t even mentioned it <br/>
 again to them.  <br/>
I’m not  being prude about it, just doesn’t rank top of my list of things <br/>
for them to do  right now! I know one of the families’ whose son is 12 and I <br/>
guess he is the one  who asked if he could plan something to meet more kids his  <br/>
age.&quot; <br/>
My  thoughts are ..it&#39;s all about what SHE wants and what SHE feels is best <br/>
and no  CHOICE for  the kids!  <br/>
Part of  me WANTS to respond to her, the other part doesn&#39;t even want to <br/>
bother  &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;. <br/>
What  would you say? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-876076147">I might just say something simple like, &quot;Well shucks! My son is  <br/>
excited about the opportunity to meet other kids but was hoping he&#39;d  <br/>
get to see your son there too.  He&#39;s so excited about this fun  <br/>
opportunity and I&#39;ll be around to make sure he&#39;s comfortable and  <br/>
having fun so we&#39;re going for it!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A comment like this acknowledges that you heard her but that you are  <br/>
chosing to look at it from your child&#39;s point of view, honor his  <br/>
desire and approach it in a positive manner yet not sound like you&#39;re  <br/>
throwing your son to the wolves.<br/>
<br/>
Just an idea.<br/>

Thanks. I&#39;ve done that already, but I so wanted to bring up the importance  <br/>
of *choice* and *trust*, neither of which she gives her kids ..  sigh<br/>
 <br/>
And the fact she needs to look at *teens* in a positive light. Teens are  aw<br/>
esome!<br/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
-------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
This seems as good a time as any to mention that choice and trust can  <br/>
be a slippery slope. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly, who turned 16 in November, has a boyfriend who will turn 24 in  <br/>
April.<br/>
<br/>
This couldn&#39;t have happened if we had some RULES around here.  And  <br/>
we&#39;ve known him for three years, and he was a friend of Kirby&#39;s even  <br/>
before then.  So he&#39;s fully vetted by Kirby and Marty and Holly.   <br/>
She&#39;s known him since she was 13.  He&#39;s been to several parties  <br/>
here.  He came to my birthday party last summer.<br/>
<br/>
Holly wouldn&#39;t like him if he weren&#39;t pretty special, because the  <br/>
stream of friends of her brothers has been constant for years, and  <br/>
most of those guys weren&#39;t interesting to her.<br/>
<br/>
They flirted and talked, but he had two girlfriends in that time (the  <br/>
first one had been his girlfriend since they were 15), but it started  <br/>
looking to me a few months ago that it was inevitable that they would  <br/>
end up a couple.  I knew it before they did.<br/>
<br/>
We had never predicted that Holly would like someone older than  <br/>
either of her brothers, but for years we&#39;ve been happy with the fact  <br/>
that Kirby&#39;s friends were younger and older than he is, and Marty&#39;s,  <br/>
and...  well...<br/>
<br/>
I guess you should *not* tell this story to your friend with the ten  <br/>
year old.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and the young man are being open and he hangs around here, and  <br/>
has talked to everyone in the family and their friends, some of whom  <br/>
thought it might be illegal to even think about it.  A friend of mine  <br/>
is an assistant DA and I checked legalities with him just before  <br/>
Holly&#39;s 16th birthday.  It all varies state by state, but as long as  <br/>
the older male doesn&#39;t work at a school she attends or at a hospital  <br/>
in which she&#39;s being treated, it&#39;s her option.<br/>
<br/>
The coolest thing about it for me is that she is SO not in a hurry.   <br/>
It&#39;s very sweet and calm.  They hold hands.  They&#39;ve been listening  <br/>
to a lot of Donovan together.  They&#39;re going on a picnic tomorrow.   <br/>
He&#39;s in grad school and she insisted that he do his homework last  <br/>
night before they hung out.<br/>
<br/>
In high school if a boy would pay much attention to me I was  <br/>
immediately besotted.  And part of school&#39;s pressure is reporting  <br/>
each day to your friends what you&#39;ve done, or why not.  She has no  <br/>
such pressure at all, and the boy knows we would run him off if he  <br/>
were not treating her the way we wanted  him to.  He likes Kirby and  <br/>
Marty so much he would hate to lose those friendships.<br/>
<br/>
Holly said he told her yesterday that it was lucky for him the Dodd  <br/>
family had a girl.<br/>

Thanks<br/>
Now that I have calmed down &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;, I don&#39;t think I will  bother saying <br/>
anymore to her. She probably won&#39;t *internalize* it  and feel the need to *get it* <br/>
anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s frustrating because I can see how much better it *could* be . <br/>
 <br/>
A veteran unschooler friend said to me recently, &quot;I&#39;d love to tell you it  <br/>
won&#39;t bug you as time goes on but I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ve only gotten more  sensitive <br/>
to it&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
So true.<br/>

<br/>
I see Marty and Holly cringe at the way other people treat kids.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s the best argument for parents drinking and sending kids to  <br/>
school.  Numbing ourselves to acceptance of those around us.  It  <br/>
might be the more sociable, comfortable thing to do.   Ignorance is  <br/>
bliss, if you define it all right.<br/>

That is what is so awesome. Good for her!<br/>

The more knowledge and trust and communication and choice they have,  the <br/>
more empowered they are to do what THEY feel is right for them   :)<br/>
