Yes Pam...contrived is the word I tend to link with &quot;educational&quot;. Gag.<br/>
I am trying to explain to someone there how it isn&#39;t a great idea to label tv <br/>
shows educational or not. I can&#39;t get past Bart Simpson...how will I explain <br/>
Field trips? sheesh.<br/>
I have been told that has nothing to do with unschooling. But to me it has <br/>
everything to do with it.<br/>

What idiot told you the idea of categorizing (or not) things as educational <br/>
has nothing to do with unschooling!?!?  <br/>
<br/>
OH, never mind.  I don&#39;t want to know the answer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a shame and a horror when people who don&#39;t understand unschooling <br/>
discourage those who do understand it from trying to clarify.  And it cannot <br/>
just BE described and pre-scribed, each person has to really get it, gut <br/>
level, whether before, during or after it starts working at their house.  And <br/>
they only get it from turning their own ideas and observations around.  And <br/>
if they resist taking their own ideas out and looking at them, they cannot, <br/>
will not get it.  <br/>
