<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369640995">Nadine, Your assumption that people would be either mean or <br/>
unhelpful are totally insulting to many list members. Please do some <br/>
self examination or just drop it. Because at this point, you seem <br/>
unwilling to accept responsibility for your poorly worded post.<br/>
I have tried to point out gently, and clearly, exactly why it is <br/>
insulting. You don&#39;t want to get it. Ok, let&#39;s move on.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I know none of us will ever have to see one another<br/>
face to face and in that there is a security, one in which we can say<br/>
*anything* we want to each other,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No. None of us would have to. But many of us have, so there is <br/>
no &quot;security&quot; in saying anything we want to...most of us say what we <br/>
feel is true. We try to say it as clearly and truthfully as <br/>
possible. <br/>
That&#39;s it.<br/>
I have met Sandra and Kelly and Pam and AnneO and Joyce and Elissa <br/>
and Robyn and Rue and Karin and Shannon and many other fabulous <br/>
people from this list and other lists. I have stayed in other <br/>
unschoolers homes, I have talked to them on the phone, I have mailed <br/>
them things and had them stay in my home. I&#39;m hosting an unschoolers <br/>
beach party and will meet many more of them...many from this list.<br/>
I try really hard to say exactly what I mean, and I am not afraid to <br/>
meet people I have questioned on the internet.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to continue answering questions about unschooling. I am <br/>
not happy to hear more whining about the list, or Sandra (who has <br/>
changed many, many lives for the better) or how we are all so mean <br/>
for telling the truth.<br/>
<br/>
So please, ask your unschooling questions. Take what is useful, <br/>
don&#39;t whine about advice you can&#39;t use. Self examine when <br/>
something &quot;ouches&quot; but don&#39;t stress about it. It is what it is.<br/>
