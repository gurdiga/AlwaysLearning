These types of practices are exactly why I think I&#39;ll always rescue animals <br/>
rather than buy a purebred from a breeder. Not that I&#39;ve owned a dog in <br/>
years.....I&#39;d love to rescue a greyhound though, we&#39;ll see when dh has his <br/>
basement space done.<br/>
<br/>
Would a rat be happy enough if we just bought one? I know they&#39;re a communal <br/>
animal. <br/>
And how big of a space is necessary?<br/>
Also, can you keep the stink down? I remember my friend that owned a <br/>
rat...her room always smelled funny!!<br/>

female. They&#39;re lots more attractive from behind too ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744942795">Rats are only communal if you have girls. :) Most boy rats will fight, <br/>
bitterly, and if you get a boy/girl combo, well, in no time you&#39;ll have 33<br/>
or more rats! &lt;g&gt;. Also, if you have girls (or a girl) they aren&#39;t as smelly<br/>
as the boys (male urine in just about any species is more potent stuff,<br/>
useful for scent marking territory). Clean the cage often. We used rabbit<br/>
pellet feed for litter for a long time -- the rats don&#39;t care to eat it and<br/>
it absorbs very well. Cedar chips are a bad idea, pine chips get a bad rap,<br/>
too, but I&#39;ve always liked them (mixed with rabbit pellets they do very<br/>
nicely to both absorb and provide a softer surface for the rats) and never<br/>
had problems.<br/>
<br/>
As long as she gets lots of attention, you can keep one rat just fine.<br/>
You&#39;ll need a space about 18&quot; x 12&quot; (larger is fine, much smaller seems<br/>
cramped to me). I&#39;ve used everything from aquariums to wire cages to<br/>
Rubbermaid bins with home-made wire lids (they will chew plastic, but can&#39;t<br/>
seem to get a &quot;grip&quot; on the inside of the Rubbermaid-type storage containers<br/>
-- we used the clear ones of course -- but maybe I just had underachieving<br/>
rate. &lt;g&gt;). Rats are excellent escape artists, and catastrophically clever,<br/>
so make sure whatever you use can&#39;t be pushed open, chewed open, etc.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re happier with two, but one will be OK; we have a single now that her<br/>
buddy passed on.  We have a chinchilla cage with a plastic cat-box type<br/>
bottom; very easy to clean.  It&#39;s maybe 2ft by 18 inches by 2ft. high.  I<br/>
think male rats stink more than females, so I&#39;ve always owned females.  And<br/>
we&#39;ve decide aspen shaving are far and away the best bedding -- no allergies<br/>
or respiratory problems for the rats, and, though the bedding itself doesn&#39;t<br/>
have a strong odor, like cedar or pine, it keeps the rat odor to a minimum.<br/>
<br/>
We just replaced Arwen, the deceased mouse, with a little fancy male, a<br/>
&quot;dumbo&quot; this time (so-called for the big ears).  He&#39;s been named Legolas.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893468109">Wow!  It&#39;s like 6 degrees of separation!  Actually, Kathleen is here in<br/>
VA right now with us doing Fiddler.  She just got in town last week and<br/>
started rehearsing with us on Tuesday.  It was already so much fun with<br/>
Jeanne, the VA director, but now with Kathleen here too, it&#39;s so cool!<br/>
I mispoke in my last e-mail for the sake of conciseness.  Kathleen was<br/>
actually the only one who started YPT here, but Jeanne joined her the<br/>
first season and soon became her partner.  Since there are people on<br/>
this group who actually know these people, I thought I should state it<br/>
correctly!<br/>
