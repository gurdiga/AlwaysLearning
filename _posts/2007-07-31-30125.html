Fisher Price Little Village People<br/>
A joint project of Holly and Sandra, inspired by Marty&#39;s quote in the  <br/>
game when the word is &quot;West,&quot; and Holly&#39;s decision to play Fisher  <br/>
Price.  We got it out for a visiting three year old who decided not  <br/>
to stay and play, but Fisher Price town lives again, for a while,  <br/>
thanks to Holly.<br/>
