<div id="ygrps-yiv-533534671">&lt;&lt;but New Mexico&#39;s pretty cool to see&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Back when we only had 2 kids, we did a New Mexico vacation.  It was<br/>
wonderful.  We stayed in a little cabin not far from Ruidoso for a few<br/>
days....it rained so we played board games all day and went for ice cream in<br/>
town.  The kids still talk about Zach eating a scoop of ice cream that was<br/>
as big as his head. (he was 2).  We went to Carlsbad, and over to Lincoln.<br/>
We all imagined we were Billy the Kid escaping from jail.  We hit White<br/>
Sands and played and played and played.  On the way home we stopped in<br/>
Langtry and paid homage to my hero, Judge Roy Bean &quot;Law West of the Pecos.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was so fun and interesting and memorable.<br/>
