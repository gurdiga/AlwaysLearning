<div id="ygrps-yiv-549996502">I am currently learning about how my computer is put together. I had the case off last night and was moving my memory chips around. BOTH girls (5 and 2) were very interested in what I was doing. They asked many, many questions and even Annie understood what I was telling her. I guess this technically isn&#39;t &quot;child-led&quot; learning. Unless you consider me a child, which I guess I am! (giggle)<br/>
I have found an astounding hunger to learn about everything lately. I am sick of having problems with my &#39;puter and not knowing what to do about it- I am even considering building a new one (maybe----if $$ wasn&#39;t an issue!).<br/>
Eve said &quot;Mommy, when you are done building a new &#39;puter, will you build me a TV for my room?&quot; I just love the NO-LIMIT mentality they have!<br/>

Big day here- going to see &quot;Return to Neverland&quot;- utopia for a 5yo Peter Pan addict!<br/>
