Hi,<br/>
<br/>
In an effort to compile material for my next publishing efforts, I need your <br/>
help.  If you&#39;d like to share some of your un/homeschooling story but don&#39;t <br/>
wish to write an entire book perhaps you&#39;d like to contribute to my future <br/>
projects.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for stories from other families to share. Please let me know what <br/>
has worked for you and your children.  Your Stories:  Submit your story for <br/>
inclusion in further publications:<br/>
<br/>
1. Deciding to Homeschool/your family&#39;s style of homelearning <br/>
2. Tales from homeschooling the younger children (grade school age) <br/>
3. Tales from homeschooling high school age students <br/>
4. Young adults who have learned at home - telling how are they making their <br/>
way in the world now- by either the young person, or the parent. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to give your contact information: name, e-mail, phone, mailing <br/>
address. <br/>
<br/>
See the website - www.homeschoolingreflections.com, under the page &quot;submit <br/>
your story&quot; for snail mail, and e-mail addresses.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
Connie Colten<br/>
<br/>
