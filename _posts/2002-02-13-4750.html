<div id="ygrps-yiv-499489149">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
The following make me think of long ago when I read or heard John Holt tell <br/>
us as homeschooling parents to lead an interesting life, and let our children <br/>
be a part of it.  I have found that as the children get older, they then let <br/>
me be a part of their interesting lives - I&#39;ve gotten to see and do things <br/>
with them that never would have occured to me.<br/>

&gt; expect that they can throw the curriculum out the window and then they get <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; focus only on their OWN interests and let the children fend for themselves. <br/>
&gt; And certainly our detractors act like that is what they think we&#39;re doing.<br/>
