<div id="ygrps-yiv-1415852798">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
I have a question about freedom and choice, or what is related to it more to<br/>
the point.....<br/>
<br/>
I totally get what has been written here by Sandra and you all....<br/>
<br/>
Here is my question....<br/>
<br/>
How do you relate to others who just do not seem to get it?<br/>
<br/>
I ask this because I am this situation with two people in my life right now,<br/>
both whom do not get this concept of choice and freedom at all. It is<br/>
frustrating and I find myself distancing myself from them simply because<br/>
they do not get it! They do not understand that everything in their lives is<br/>
a choice, including as someone wrote, how they choose to feel and how they<br/>
choose to interrelate with myself and others.<br/>
<br/>
I so wish to be close to these two people in my life, but their negativity<br/>
and emotional and energy draining behaviors are making it next to impossible<br/>
 I know this is there choice, but I am not sure what my choices should be?<br/>
Do I keep trying to brainstorm with them in an attempt to &quot;convert&quot; them<br/>
over to choice and freedom? Or do I make the choice to give up these<br/>
relationships?<br/>
<br/>
Or are there other choices out there I may not be seeing?<br/>
<br/>
Any words of direction, would be of great help here! :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for this thread Sandra, it has been a great source of inspiration for<br/>
me! :) I am thoroughly enjoying reading all of the perspectives on this! It<br/>
is so ironically funny to me how anytime thee is something that I am<br/>
grappling with in my life or the kids are in their lives or just something<br/>
that is a matter of interest to me or my kids (i.e. when my middle son was<br/>
taking interest in the guitar, or egg hatching etc.) somehow, the same exact<br/>
thing that comes up in our lives here seems to pop up as a thread on one of<br/>
the many yahoo groups I am on! :)<br/>
<br/>
So thank you Sandra and everyone! :)<br/>
