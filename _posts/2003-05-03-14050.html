<div id="ygrps-yiv-2055282473">My laptop is broken - not the laptop itself but the AC adapter, so I&#39;m<br/>
back at the old desktop, which just happens to look out at the yard area<br/>
between our house and the neighbors. Rain was over there with Jamie,<br/>
Victor, and Alex, and I could see people running around with goggles so I<br/>
figured they were playing air soft, but Rain&#39;s gun was still here and I<br/>
know they only have 3 over there. So I was wondering, and when I went out<br/>
to tell Rain I was running to the post office I found her with goggles<br/>
and a white notepad and pencil. I asked her what she was doing. She gave<br/>
me a happy smile and said, &quot;I&#39;m an embedded reporter.&quot;<br/>

In second grade we played WWII.  It was 1961, but that was still the news, <br/>
and some people&#39;s relatives were still in Germany.   But I used to be a <br/>
nurse.  And my favorite guy was Joseph Polacco.  If Joseph was downed by the <br/>
Germans, I would cure him by taking a handful of sand and sprinkling it over <br/>
him.  He was resurrected and went back into the fray.  <br/>
