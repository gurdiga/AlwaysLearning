<div id="ygrps-yiv-1320997183">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I hope you&#39;re not saying it is normal to *not* feel like a man <br/>
until <br/>
you are 40 or 50. I&#39;ll have to ask dh when he finally knew he was <br/>
grown up. Gee, let me see, when did I finally know I was grown up?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Anyone else care to expound upon this thought.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I am 36, and I have, for the last couple of years referred to myself <br/>
and my same aged friends as &quot;baby adults&quot; and that is really the way <br/>
it feels.  My very dearest friend is 50, she is a bit more of <br/>
a &quot;grown-up&quot; then myself.  I hope to follow the good examples of the <br/>
kinder grown-ups;-)<br/>
<br/>
My dh is 40 and a wonderful provider for our family, but all grown <br/>
up? I do not think so....and that is a good thing.<br/>
