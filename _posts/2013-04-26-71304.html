<div id="ygrps-yiv-541732987">I was very interested in the article on food religion. It was something that I had never thought about in relation to our kids. I had never heard of orthorexia before so I had to look it up. Reading about it, I realize that society really fosters this idea with the new diets going on - the &quot;Paleo&quot; diet for example or the &quot;Daniel Diet&quot;. It made me want to work even harder to help my kids to not have the same issues later in life with food. <br/>
<br/>
My children are five and nine and are a true testament to how allowing them freedom of choice in food is working. Every day they get a monkey platter with a variety of things from fruit and veggies to crackers/chips, to cookies/marshmallows/sweets. Every day the fruit and veggies are the first to go. They eat the other things too, but they chose what they like best, first. I give them the other options too because the ONE day I didn&#39;t, they both asked where the Oreos went! LOL<br/>

<br/>
Those diets don&#39;t come from society. <br/>
They come from individuals who want to make money by creating a fear and then providing a talisman, a safety.  That&#39;s how many religions works.  Define the enemy, and collect money to defend from that enemy.  Make sacrifices, or else the enemy will destroy you.   (Some religions aren&#39;t so bad that way as others; some have very little outside of that &quot;SATAN!! saved&quot; cycle.)<br/>

I&#39;m guessing that you didn&#39;t have very strict rules around food before so your kids are pretty good at deciding what they really want.  Unfortunately, we had a lot of restrictions and pressure around food for many years so transitioning over to letting them make their own choices about food has been a rockier road.  Over the last 8 months my son, almost 9, has discovered that he&#39;s not a big fan of sweets but now that he can have whatever he wants he&#39;s having a hard time finding any food that he wants to eat at all!   My daughter, 10, has asthma & I thought for a long time that if I provided clean air, food and water her body would heal itself.  I went to great lengths to provide those things.  I should have been more focused on her emotions.  Now I&#39;m focusing on helping her feel safe and in control of her environment (including her food choices).  I think of it like helping her spend her days in a cloud of love & joy.  Her asthma symptoms, including chronically stuffy nose and tight feelings in her chest, have plummeted.  Her diet is mostly prepackaged sweets & snacks and she has never seemed healthier!  That&#39;s pretty ironic.  Sometimes when I&#39;ve been weak I&#39;ve tried to convince her to eat something &quot;healthy&quot;.  Every time I do it I feel her become defensive and cling to her boxes of food!  When those nervous feelings about her diet come to the surface I remind myself to release those judgments and be patient.  She is making the choices that feel right to her so as her understanding of what she really wants and needs develops her food choices will no doubt be influenced as well.<br/>
