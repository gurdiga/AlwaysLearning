<div id="ygrps-yiv-2085742130">I don&#39;t intend to announce all the chats on this list at all, but it&#39;s  <br/>
an hour before chat-time, I missed last Friday&#39;s chat for being on a  <br/>
train, and I do intend to chat tonight, my last night in Wales.    <br/>
Tomorrow I go to Julie Daniel&#39;s house in Ashford, Surrey (this side of  <br/>
London) and I fly home Thursday, so I&#39;ll be in the Friday chat from  <br/>
Albuquerque.<br/>
<br/>
I have a new little 13&quot; MacBook, because I dropped and broke the  <br/>
screen on my practically new MacBook I bought in January.  The  <br/>
keyboards aren&#39;t just the same, so you can see me make Many Typos!   <br/>
But I can type in � pounds and euros �.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The times:<br/>
<br/>
Two hours, beginning:<br/>
<br/>
Pacific: 2:00 pm Monday<br/>
Mountain: 3:00 pm<br/>
Central: 4:00 pm<br/>
Eastern: 5:00 pm<br/>
England: 10:00 pm Monday<br/>

<br/>
