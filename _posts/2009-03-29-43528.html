<div id="ygrps-yiv-593402641">my son saw a contest by blizzard entertainment to design a warcraft theme park.  he became quite excited, but then realized the deadline is tomorrow.  however, he has decided to do it just for fun, not for the contest.  any great sites or resources or experiences for doing this?  he wants to do it in many iterations - drawing, three dimensional, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
thanks!<br/>

My kids use the &quot;Roller Coaster Tycoon&quot; software by Atari for this.  If you<br/>
look online at the Atari site, under the forums, you&#39;ll see many people who<br/>
make custom scenery for the game which adds to the building possibilities.<br/>
My boys have made very complex parks over the years!<br/>
