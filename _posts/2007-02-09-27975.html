<div id="ygrps-yiv-213857090">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a Mom and a children&#39;s librarian and I&#39;m esp. interested in what <br/>
you would like to see libraries offer in the way of programs that <br/>
would best help you and your children.  Public libraries need to be <br/>
vital for children and parents using traditional and nontraditional <br/>
learning methods.<br/>
<br/>
Our main library is undergoing a major overhaul and when it reopens we <br/>
want to be able to reach out to the public and offer even more <br/>
programs.  Of course we want those programs to be things that are <br/>
truly needed by parents and children.  Are there programs your library <br/>
has offered that have been especially helpful?  Are there things you <br/>
always wished the library would do?  All suggestions and ideas welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks you,<br/>
Kate</div>
