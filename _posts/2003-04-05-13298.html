<div id="ygrps-yiv-957180572">We have been having adventures with Julian, ever seeking structure. A while <br/>
ago he developed &quot;study halls&quot; for himself, where 3 days a week he <br/>
concentrates for a couple hours on an academic subject: Monday: history, <br/>
Tuesday: Literature, Friday: Math. I don&#39;t even know where he heard the term <br/>
&quot;study hall.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
My role in this is I keep the days on my calendar as recurring appointments <br/>
and tell him. He has also asked me to make recommendations about things to <br/>
read, etc.  So I made a pile of stuff we had around the house I thought he&#39;d <br/>
like, and he plunged in. He spent one day going through centuries of poetry <br/>
from my old Norton Anthology of English literature.  (He really liked <br/>
Coleridge.) Another day he read parts of The Joy of Mathematics, by Theoni <br/>
Pappas. He didn&#39;t do problems or anything, just read, and had a good time. <br/>
Then on History day last week, he spent hours reading The Optimist&#39;s Guide to <br/>
History and The Pessimist&#39;s Guide to History. (He&#39;s as likely to pick these <br/>
things up at other times too, but likes to know there are times scheduled for <br/>
them.)<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been struggling as he&#39;s been learning guitar. He forgets to practice, <br/>
then he gets sad because he isn&#39;t making progress as fast as he&#39;d like. He <br/>
asked us to keep reminding him, but that felt awful to all of us, because no <br/>
matter what, it felt like nagging. Finally, I looked at him, so sad, and <br/>
said, &quot;Do you want to just schedule time every day for practice?&quot;  He looked <br/>
at me and his face GLOWED!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
So he now practices right after Study Hall on days he has that scheduled, or <br/>
right when he gets up on the other days. And when he went to his lesson the <br/>
other day, he teacher was impressed with how well he did.<br/>
<br/>
Now, this is not my style at all. (Is this his version of adolescent <br/>
rebellion?) But I am so impressed at Julian&#39;s ability to find what works for <br/>
him. He has no desire for a curriculum, and is so good at finding things that <br/>
interest him. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2039489474">Kathryn.... Is his Sun Sign in Virgo?  As you are probably aware there are<br/>
Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, Pluto and<br/>
North and South Node to take into consideration when you are looking at a<br/>
human beings charts. <br/>
<br/>
Zak has his first 4 planets I Virgo.  So he&#39;s very Virgo like.  You need to<br/>
have at least 4 planets in a sign in order to be considered &quot;that sign&quot;.<br/>
The majority of people are a combination.  Although you do get people who<br/>
are very dominant in one sign.  With Zak having so much Virgo (I&#39;m also a<br/>
Virgo Sun, Mercury, Venus & Pluto with an Aquarius Moon) it&#39;s easier for me<br/>
to deal with him than Steve (who only has 1 Virgo planet).  Talk, talk,<br/>
talk, answer, answer, answer, structure, structure, structure (they<br/>
structure not mine) is the key with Virgo children.  The more Virgo they<br/>
have in them the more talking they do.  Zak is very precise and logical and<br/>
will come up with solutions to problems very quickly.  For example.  Steve<br/>
and I were playing video poker the other day on the computer and Zak wanted<br/>
to learn how to play.  We told him this was a grown up game (not sure why we<br/>
did that actually) so he went into the kitchen and cut up tons of pieces of<br/>
paper and made his own card deck (even though he has tons of real card<br/>
decks).  He then came to me with a piece of paper and asked me to tell him<br/>
how many points things were worth.... I sat in the kitchen saying to myself<br/>
&quot;I cannot believe I&#39;m teaching my 7 year old how to play poker&quot;.  They learn<br/>
what they see!!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1085150863">In order to find out what someone&#39;s natal astrological chart looks like you<br/>
need date of birth, place of birth and time of birth.  Then an Astrologer<br/>
can create that chart and interpret it.<br/>
