<div id="ygrps-yiv-1382881457">&quot;This might not of<br/>
happened had we continued to try to curtail her cartoon interest. <br/>
With<br/>
acceptance, it has opened doors. :-) We are amazed!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I often refer to saying &quot;no&quot; as a closed door and a &quot;yes&quot; as an <br/>
avenue.  You found the avenue by saying &quot;yes&quot; to her interest! Cool.<br/>
<br/>
It IS amazing what our children will lead us to when we stay open, <br/>
when we stay curious and interested in EVERYTHING.:)<br/>
<br/>
If you have a Hot Topic store near you, you might check out their <br/>
stock. They often have Invader Zim shirts or buttons and such.  I <br/>
bet she&#39;d like that. Plus, the employees usually have colorful hair <br/>
and interesting styles. I&#39;ve also found very fun unschoolish bumper <br/>
stickers.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy wherever this cartoon path leads, I be you&#39;ll be amazed quite <br/>
often at the learning it swirls into your lives.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I think what Sandra way trying to say about not posting when <br/>
you&#39;re feeling negative, is simply to expect strong reactions. If <br/>
you can handle them (obviously you can!), then I suppose it&#39;s not a <br/>
problem....sometimes I stop to think a bit more before I hit &quot;send&quot; <br/>
these days. These lists cause you to do a lot of self <br/>
examination....a very good thing.<br/>
