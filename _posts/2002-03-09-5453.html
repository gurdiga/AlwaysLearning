&lt;&lt; Monday&#39;s a holiday. We can certainly plan something else for afterwards if <br/>
anyone&#39;s interested.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather hang around with other homeschoolers than go sightseeing (IF I&#39;ve <br/>
gotten to see some stuff Friday, and I hear that there are things within <br/>
walking distance of the hotel).  <br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s planning to go with me.  He&#39;s 13 and wants to go to the gaming shop <br/>
there in Columbia.  If anyone has a kid with a similar interest, that would <br/>
be great!  Since his main hangout is a gaming shop and he&#39;s only been to <br/>
three or four different ones, he wants to see more what the range is, and <br/>
maybe play against some new people.<br/>

(without kids that is). Now maybe I&#39;ll have Conor come with me. I&#39;m not sure <br/>
how well that would go over with Casey, though.<br/>
<br/>
I too would vote for just hanging out rather than sightseeing. Better to get <br/>
to know people that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about a picnic at the zoo or the lake? I might be able to wrangle a boat <br/>
even. At the OTHER lake, my brother-in-law has a house and a boat---that&#39;s <br/>
sounding even better. (Now I&#39;ll have to suck-up!).  Or we can just hang here.<br/>
