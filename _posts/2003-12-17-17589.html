<div id="ygrps-yiv-422164144">Hi, For some reason I never got this email in a digest. Maybe my <br/>
Filters were misbehaving. I went online to read messages today and <br/>
found it. Thanks  Sandra for your thoughtful reply. I will go visit <br/>
the site in the very near future.<br/>
Take Care,<br/>

<br/>
eyeing The Evergreen State Collge, from which my DH & I are both<br/>
<br/>
graduated. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet she can get in without &quot;an actual diploma.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most schools have a small quota to fill of alternative or special <br/>
students<br/>
who are brought in to enrich the student body. Maybe she could aim <br/>
for that<br/>
niche instead of just being another in the stream of &quot;actual diploma&quot;<br/>
applicants.<br/>
<br/>
A reall letter of application beats the heck out of filling in a form <br/>
and<br/>
attaching a transcript from a high school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She hasn&#39;t<br/>
<br/>
quite let go of the compliant model student persona that she had in<br/>
<br/>
school. She has feelings of failure for being unable to cope with the<br/>
<br/>
system.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are two short articles here I think will help you creatd a new <br/>
program<br/>
for her which could be the gateway to relaxation for all of you. They <br/>
are<br/>
&quot;Disposable Checklists for Unschoolers&quot; and &quot;Deschooling.&quot;<br/>
