<div id="ygrps-yiv-297329192">My daughter went to an all girls catholic school for 4 years.  This <br/>
year we began teaching her at home with a new on-line charter school.  <br/>
I thought this would be great for her so she can learn at her own <br/>
pace.  She also takes an on-line Math course called EPGY.  It is a good <br/>
program because she gets to work through things on her own, as fast or <br/>
as slow as she likes.  This year she has gone through all of the work <br/>
for her grade in the charter home school.  I have told her that she can <br/>
now learn whatever she wants to learn and that it is up to her.  I told <br/>
her that with all of her hard work this year, she has earned the right <br/>
to learn something on her own and to take a break and find new <br/>
interests.  The problem that I am having is that she WANTS direction.  <br/>
She tells me that if she is to be taught at home, then she wants me to <br/>
teach her and for me not to just sit there. My question is what should <br/>
I do?  How can make her be an unschooled student?  I am not looking for <br/>
support, I am looking for a way to make her want to be unschooled.<br/>
thank you,<br/>

<br/>
This doesn&#39;t really fit in with the whole unschooling principle.  With this <br/>
reasoning, you&#39;re using freedom and &quot;fun learning&quot; as dessert, and equating <br/>
what we do wholeheartedly and fully as &quot;taking a break.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While I think this list might be able to help you with practical ideas, a <br/>
philosophical basis would help you more in the longrun than practicalities.  <br/>
Still...<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
She&#39;s right.  If she&#39;s to be taught at home, you must teach her!<br/>
<br/>
If you change the way you&#39;re approaching learning, and you come to see <br/>
learning as a separate thing from teaching, you must DEFINITELY not just sit there.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s an intro to the importance of looking at &quot;learning&quot; as a whole <br/>
separate thing far from &quot;teaching.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-My question is what should <br/>
<br/>
I do?  How can make her be an unschooled student?  -=-<br/>
<br/>
#1, by not thinking of her as a student.<br/>
#2, by switching gears from thinking you can &quot;make her be&quot; anything (other <br/>
than maybe miserable)<br/>
#3, by spending a lot of your own time really looking at learning.  Think <br/>
back to how you have learned things in your life and what helped and what didn&#39;t. <br/>
 Look at how she learns things best and most happily.  What has she learned <br/>
in non-academic ways?  What does she love and what is she curious about?<br/>
<br/>

-=- This year she has gone through all of the work <br/>
<br/>
for her grade in the charter home school.  I have told her that she can <br/>
<br/>
now learn whatever she wants to learn and that it is up to her.-=-<br/>
<br/>
How old is she?<br/>
Do you intend to press her to learn what she wants just until next year when <br/>
she starts the next year&#39;s charter school work for her grade?  <br/>
<br/>
In either case, it&#39;s not a path to unschooling to say &quot;Okay, now learn!  Do <br/>
it now!  Are you doing it yet?  Is it fun?  What are you learning?  You should <br/>
learn whatever you want to learn.  It&#39;s up to you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here are some articles I think might help you change directions and get <br/>
involved with her in ways that are not what she&#39;s used to, and maybe she and you <br/>
will catch the spark of learning for fun.  But you need to stop looking for the <br/>
learning, and just look for the fun.  You&#39;ll see it out of the corner of your <br/>
eye, and eventually it might flood in, but it won&#39;t as long as you&#39;re really <br/>
dissecting your life to pull out the math and writing and history.   You have <br/>
to leave the seeds in the ground and just water them and let the sun shine.  <br/>
Don&#39;t dig them up to see if they&#39;re sprouting.<br/>
