<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998230711"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Are people supporting or validating Unitarian Universalist beliefs <br/>
&gt; by being<br/>
&gt; friendly with me? Unschooling? Star Trek?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What??? You UNSCHOOL??   gasp.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the difference is UU&#39;s and Unschoolers and Trekies aren&#39;t<br/>
advocating (as far as I know, don&#39;t correct me if I&#39;m wrong ) the notion<br/>
that the world would be a better place without someone because and only<br/>
because of the color of her skin.   UU&#39;s and unschoolers and Trekies<br/>
aren&#39;t a threat to anyone&#39;s safety, ( except maybe the Borg ).  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just plain hard to feel ok about someone who thinks like this.<br/>
But it&#39;s true, he won&#39;t be changed by righteous indignation.  <br/>
