Ratcheting up the nation&#39;s fear factor<br/>
<br/>
February 14, 2003<br/>
<br/>
By CHRIS COURSEY<br/>
THE PRESS DEMOCRAT<br/>
<br/>
Be afraid. Be very, very afraid.<br/>
<br/>
This message is brought to you this week by your federal government. <br/>
We&#39;re going to war, our leaders tell us. Or war is coming to us. Either <br/>
way, it&#39;s a dangerous, dangerous time.<br/>
<br/>
Baghdad has weapons of mass destruction. Pyongyang has missiles that can <br/>
reach Sonoma County. Agents of al-Qaida are loose in the land, the CIA <br/>
director says. Significant public buildings, bridges or landmarks may be <br/>
targets. But so might apartment buildings, hotels, schools or churches. <br/>
Key industries are asked to look for &quot;infiltrators.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
No one is safe.<br/>
<br/>
So duck and cover. Tape and seal. Lock and load, batten down the <br/>
hatches, praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.<br/>
<br/>
Or, take a deep breath and think.<br/>
<br/>
Why are we going into full panic mode now? Is the world any more <br/>
threatening than it has been since Sept. 11, 2001? And if so, what is <br/>
making it that way?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to dismiss the threat of terrorism. No one needs to be <br/>
reminded of the damage that a small group of determined people can <br/>
cause. That threat exists every day.<br/>
<br/>
But what happened to the post-Sept. 11 advice to &quot;live your lives; go <br/>
about your business&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly, our lives include stocking up on duct tape and our business is <br/>
to ferret out sleeper agents in the next cubicle.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing if you live in Manhattan or D.C., or if you work for <br/>
Lockheed or the National Security Agency. But the fact is, the vast <br/>
majority of Americans don&#39;t live or work in those places.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t argue with &quot;be prepared.&quot; It&#39;s good advice for earthquakes, for <br/>
power outages, for Boy Scouts and for days when you just can&#39;t get to <br/>
the store for groceries.<br/>
<br/>
But what are we preparing for now? Anthrax? Mustard gas? A radioactive <br/>
&quot;dirty bomb&quot;? Who is kidding whom? If I can&#39;t keep the moths and mice <br/>
out of my house, how is a little tape and plastic going to save me from <br/>
nerve gas or radioactive contamination?<br/>
<br/>
So I keep coming back to the same question: Why is my government <br/>
deliberately trying to scare me?<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the first time we&#39;ve heard from Osama bin Laden. He&#39;s popped <br/>
up on video and audio tapes several times since Sept. 11, each time <br/>
figuratively beating his chest and exhorting his followers to praise <br/>
Allah and kill the infidels.<br/>
<br/>
But each previous time, our government has downplayed the messages, <br/>
questioned their authenticity, warned that broadcasting them might help <br/>
bin Laden send secret messages to his al-Qaida operatives.<br/>
<br/>
Now, though, his message conveniently arrives at a time when it can mesh <br/>
well with our government&#39;s own message to its citizens. That being: War <br/>
in Iraq is imminent. Terrorism is still a threat. And the two are <br/>
somehow connected.<br/>
<br/>
There are many Americans who don&#39;t think the debate is that simple. But <br/>
it&#39;s a lot harder for them to argue their point of view when the <br/>
national fear factor is ratcheted up to code orange or code red or <br/>
whatever color Tom Ridge decides goes with his tie this morning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s difficult to second-guess these warnings. After all, they may be -- <br/>
and probably eventually will be -- right. We&#39;re not done with terrorism.<br/>
<br/>
But that doesn&#39;t mean we shouldn&#39;t question the purpose of the alerts. <br/>
Are they designed simply to cover the butts of the intelligence agencies <br/>
that dropped the ball before Sept. 11? Are they distractions to divert <br/>
the public debate from other issues? Are they an indication that our <br/>
leaders know that something terrible is going to happen, and they are <br/>
powerless to stop it?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have the answer. All I know is that my government wants me to be <br/>
afraid right now.<br/>
<br/>
And that, more than anything else, scares the heck out of me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559566427">Thanks for posting this interesting article today, Peggy.  I just got home <br/>
from today&#39;s pro-peace rally in NYC where I was joined by about 399,999 or <br/>
so other folks and uncountable policemen (although I&#39;m sure the City was <br/>
keeping track).  It was VERY cold today, and there were a few elderly, <br/>
unwell folks who had planned to come with us today but decided to <br/>
participate in a vigil closer to home owing to the long hours we&#39;d be out <br/>
in the elements and the amount of hoofing we had to do.  So, I wonder what <br/>
the turnout might have been if the conditions had been just slightly more <br/>
comfortable!<br/>
<br/>
We were also joined by millions (estimated by the corporate media at around <br/>
6 million) across the globe.  All these folks are not buying our <br/>
government&#39;s assertion the way to assuage our fears and *stop* terrorism is <br/>
raining terror down on the heads of the innocent PEOPLE of Iraq.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s rally was way different than the one I attended in D.C. about a <br/>
month ago.  The police were more *involved* shall we say, and there were <br/>
many arrests, I understand.  The police were a little frightening sometimes <br/>
in their riot gear.  One elderly lady who was with my informal group was <br/>
not permitted by the police to leave the rally so she could go into a <br/>
Starbucks, get out of the cold for a few minutes, have a seat, get some <br/>
java, and go to the bathroom.  She ended up having to climb over a metal <br/>
barrier, which she did with the help of some folks.<br/>
<br/>
I think that fear is a powerful motivator, but it is also one of the worst <br/>
reasons to do something (maybe if I weren&#39;t so dog-tired right now, I&#39;d be <br/>
able to think of worse reasons, so that&#39;s not really scientific).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I hope you won&#39;t mind my off-topic rambling.  Today was really <br/>
amazing and I wanted to share my experiences with some of my favorite minds.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet dreams, folks!<br/>

<br/>
When I went to the D.C. rally and march on January 18, I found myself <br/>
marching close to a small family (mom, dad, about a 10-yo son and a wee <br/>
toddler-type).  The son was wearing a very funny sandwich sign.  The back <br/>
of it said &quot;My parents made me come.&quot;  The front said &quot;Kids Against Forced <br/>
Protest Marches.&quot;  They looked like they were having a very good time.<br/>

U.N.  But, whether they&#39;re listening or not, I feel compelled to help <br/>
maintain the momentum of this movement.  So, I&#39;m making plans to go to D.C. <br/>
again on March 1.  I&#39;m hoping the weather warms up a tad by then.<br/>

people may feel powerless to do anything about it and not want to <br/>
acknowledge it.  But &quot;I dunno&quot; is the only *correct* answer I can come up <br/>
with.  I know that I feel sensitive about bringing this topic up on this <br/>
list and the unschooling list because I don&#39;t want to cause a diversion <br/>
from the unschooling topics.  But, in our lives anyway, my son sees what I <br/>
am doing, going to protests and peace vigils (the big ones and the local <br/>
ones, too).  He wants to come with me to most of them, but he backs out <br/>
when I tell him what he can expect.  He&#39;s been to a few of them though.  I <br/>
believe that when the weather gets a lot warmer he come to more of the <br/>
vigils with me, and he is, of course, welcome to join me at the bigger <br/>
marches and rallies.<br/>
<br/>
This, to me, is the Real Life that he got to rejoin when he left school a <br/>
year ago.  I&#39;m glad he wants to be a part of it.<br/>

Marji -- sounds like a great march. We watched them all on TV this morning<br/>
and I was so sad that we couldn&#39;t be a part of one. The only marches here<br/>
seem to have lots of US flag burning and &quot;down, down USA&quot; being chanted.<br/>

When I went to the D.C. rally and march on January 18, I found myself<br/>
marching close to a small family (mom, dad, about a 10-yo son and a wee<br/>
toddler-type).  The son was wearing a very funny sandwich sign.  The back<br/>
of it said &quot;My parents made me come.&quot;  The front said &quot;Kids Against Forced<br/>

U.N.  But, whether they&#39;re listening or not, I feel compelled to help<br/>
maintain the momentum of this movement.  So, I&#39;m making plans to go to D.C.<br/>
again on March 1.  I&#39;m hoping the weather warms up a tad by then.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669754226">The article was really interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in New Mexico.  During the Cuban Missile Crisis, we were a target.  I was <br/>
18 miles downhill from Los Alamos National Labs.  We were 80 miles north of <br/>
Sandia National Labs and Kirtland Air Force Base where lots of the nukes were <br/>
stored.<br/>
<br/>
Duck and cover drills were our lives.<br/>
<br/>
I was truly frightened.  I wanted my dad to build a bomb shelter.  I thought <br/>
he didn&#39;t love me because all I could get him to do was nail a quilt to the <br/>
door to a half-sunk canning room and put a radio and some batteries and a <br/>
blanket in there.<br/>
<br/>
My parents grew up with storm cellars in West Texas, and they went in on <br/>
tornado days.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing for a rabbit hole with a heavy door to protect a family from a <br/>
tornado.  It&#39;s another thing to pretend that will protect someone from a <br/>
nuclear bomb.<br/>
<br/>
So we were scared and given false hope and somewhat turned against our <br/>
parents when we couldn&#39;t get them as scared as elementary schoolkids.<br/>
<br/>
It sucked.<br/>
<br/>
So now, I think two things for my own family:<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in New Mexico which is NOT a target this round.<br/>
<br/>
IF war comes, I can&#39;t stop it.  I could get my kids all nightmarish and stock <br/>
up on duct tape and Spam, or I can continue to make today pleasant for them <br/>
and take the historic perspective about wars.   <br/>
<br/>
Some people might think that&#39;s irresponsible.  <br/>
<br/>
I think when a kid is down a well in Italy, it takes maybe 20 or 100 guys to <br/>
get him out.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t take a billion people glued to their TVs all getting emotional <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
Any kind of manipulation of emotions like that pisses me off.  Maybe because <br/>
I&#39;m more than halfway through with my life and I don&#39;t want to waste my <br/>
energy on worrying about things I can&#39;t change.<br/>
<br/>
Those who are young and want to protest wars should absolutely do so.<br/>
I was in college when Nixon resigned.  I hung out with war protesters AND <br/>
pissed-off vets.  It wasn&#39;t pretty.  It wasn&#39;t right.   The protests of the <br/>
60&#39;s and 70&#39;s will and do affect what&#39;s happening now.<br/>
<br/>
People who say the 60&#39;s never had any effect on our culture are wrong.<br/>

private schools weren&#39;t so panicked about doomsday.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you read a short story by Stephen Vincent Benet called &quot;By the <br/>
Waters of Babylon&quot;. It&#39;s one of my favorite short stories (and I have a lot <br/>
of favorites!). If you haven&#39;t read it, I know that you can find it <br/>
online---that&#39;s where I found it after years of looking for my old textbook! <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not really &#39;til the end that you get the full impact of the story---and <br/>
it was written---like YEARS before any superbomb was invented---like late <br/>
30&#39;s? But it&#39;s my &quot;doomsday story&quot;.<br/>
