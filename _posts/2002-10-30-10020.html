&gt; LOL!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s Britney Spears. My daughter is a fan. At 6 (with my youngest<br/>
&gt; daughter,<br/>
&gt; 3, singing right along with her) we endured:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whoops, I did it again! I played with your heart<br/>
&gt; Got lost in the game<br/>
&gt; Oh Baby Baby... Whoops! You think I&#39;m in love<br/>
&gt; Was sent from Above<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;m not that innocent<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s lucky we are hardy folk. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I got this a long time ago when Britney, and this song in particular, was<br/>
very popular.  Well ok, she could still be popular, but I in particular<br/>
don&#39;t care enough about her music to be following her career.  Anyway,<br/>
here are some better lyrics to her song.  If you are interested, I also<br/>
have the lyrics to the classic AC/DC, Dirty Deeds Done With Sheep.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

Oops I Farted Again <br/>

       OFFENDED MY FRIENDS<br/>
       OH BABY I JUST GAVE IT A PUSH<br/>
       BUT I DIDN&#39;T KNOW IT WAS THAT SERIOUS <br/>
<br/>
       I COULD KNOCK DOWN WILD HORSES<br/>
       BUT IT SMELLS SO FRAGRANT TO ME<br/>
       OH BABY BABY<br/>
<br/>
       OOPS I&#39;M BREAKIN SOME WIND<br/>
       I RIPPED A BIG FART<br/>
       I FEEL SO ASHAMED<br/>
       OOH BABY BABY<br/>

       I SWEAR IT&#39;S THE DOG<br/>
       HE&#39;S GOT BAD FLATULENCE<br/>
<br/>
       BRITNEY, BEFORE YOU GO THERE&#39;S SOMETHING I<br/>
       WANT YOU TO HAVE<br/>
       OH IT&#39;S BEAUTIFUL, BUT WAIT A MINUTE ISN&#39;T<br/>
       THIS?<br/>
       YES YES IT IS. GAS-X AND BEANO. I WENT DOWN<br/>
       TO THE PHARMACY AND GOT IT FOR YOU...<br/>
       YOU SHOULDN&#39;T HAVE..<br/>
       I HAD NO CHOICE BABY...<br/>
<br/>
       OOPS I FARTED AGAIN<br/>
       MY CHEEKS RIPPED APART<br/>
       THERE&#39;S NO ONE TO BLAME<br/>
       OH BABY BABY<br/>
       OOPS THERE&#39;S A SULPHUROUS GAS<br/>
       ESCAPING MY ASSSS<br/>
       I&#39;VE GOT BAD FLATULENCE<br/>
