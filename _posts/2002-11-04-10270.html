<div id="ygrps-yiv-359230617">Just thought I&#39;d share our candy experiences this year. We&#39;ve never limited or<br/>
controlled the Halloween candy thing here. This year both got a bunch. They<br/>
came home and spread it out, we checked it over, and then they spent quite a<br/>
bit of time trading off what they didn&#39;t want. I was proud of both of them,<br/>
the oldest restrained some of her overbearing ways and didn&#39;t take advantage<br/>
and the youngest was civil and generous with her trades too. They laid them<br/>
out and the youngest piled them up and made structures out of them (cuisenaire<br/>
training at work) and they ate -- a lot! More than I thought they should be I<br/>
kept my mouth shut. The youngest started feeling a bit sick. Not real bad. And<br/>
that was it. Next day a piece or two. And the same since... and I imagine,<br/>
just like years before, I will be throwing out Halloween candy around Easter<br/>
that just never got eaten. <br/>
<br/>
We did something fun this year too. For Fourth of July, I bought a bunch of<br/>
glow sticks on ebay for pretty cheap. They don&#39;t last forever and we still had<br/>
a lot left so as we walked around Trick or Treating I gave out glow sticks to<br/>
kids we saw or to the people handing out candy. It was fun and people enjoyed<br/>
getting something as they were handing out candy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-16034735">Just wanted to share this for those on the fence about the food/candy issue.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids went trick-or-treating Friday night and each came home with a<br/>
cauldron, filled to overflowing (the size of those plastic pumpkins).  They<br/>
ate a few pieces that night, swapped a few, shared a few with us, and put<br/>
them up.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, as both kids weren&#39;t feeling well (colds and coughs) they watched<br/>
a lot of Cartoon Network while eating, sorting, and trading candy.  For<br/>
breakfast, of course. ;).  By day&#39;s end, I put their cauldrons up (as in on<br/>
their bureaus so the dog doesn&#39;t get into it), and they were still nearly<br/>
full (way more than 3/4) and DH and I each had a few pieces, too.<br/>
<br/>
Today, no one has touched any.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227771777">Just a little unschooling observation this am: my six year old has eaten candy almost exclusively since Monday night, with the exception of a couple of carrots and half sandwich. He is in a good mood, acting like his normal self, and sleeping just fine at night. When there is no expectation that candy will equal negative outcomes, I don&#39;t see them.<div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div>
