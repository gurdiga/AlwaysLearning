<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966002174">I&#39;m reviving this from a June post about strewing for teens:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Marty suggests downloading more songs if he plays Rock Band or Guitar<br/>
Hero. Finance him some new music! Maybe it will be stuff you have<br/>
recordings of, or could get.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The world turns fast - at the time Zac had always said he was not interested in Guitar Hero - now he is.  I know nothing about it yet, so I&#39;m out to learn something, the day after Learn Nothing Day ;)  <br/>
<br/>
How do we download more music - or is it that you can &quot;play&quot; along with any music or does it have to be some type of software that is compatible with Guitar Hero (we&#39;ll be getting the Wii version).  We looked at Guitar Hero while out yesterday and we found two options for the Wii.  Legends of Rock and Aerosmith - He wants Legends of Rock - you can purchase the Guitar and software as a set and also purchase the software separately.<br/>
<br/>
So what are the options for downloading more songs?<br/>

This might already have been answered--I&#39;ve been away for a few hours.<br/>

Kirby looked online and it seems there will be a way in the future to  <br/>
add songs by Wii but there isn&#39;t yet.  It&#39;s Rock Band for which songs  <br/>
can be downloaded.  There was talk on a FAQ page about downloads  <br/>
being available next year, but it wasn&#39;t dated, so maybe next year is  <br/>
this year (!?).<br/>
<br/>
Kirby just brought the Aerosmith game to give to Holly and Marty  <br/>
because Activision and Blizzard merged, so the Blizzard employees  <br/>
were given Activision games as a &quot;hiya&quot; of some sort.  His roommate  <br/>
got the same game, so one came here.  Cool.  The guitar is reported  <br/>
to be particularly good.  They have it for XBox, but I think the  <br/>
guitar&#39;s the same.  (I think.)<br/>
