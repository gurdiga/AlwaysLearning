<div id="ygrps-yiv-374928226">I&#39;m fairly new to this group, though have been silently soaking <br/>
things in for 5-6 weeks or so.  My family is rather new to <br/>
unschooling, but I must admit the idea has been nudging around in my <br/>
brain for a couple of years.  We are lovin&#39; it.<br/>
<br/>
I did want to hear some of your thoughts on one thing.  I have an 8 <br/>
year old son who has never been to school.  He is happily <br/>
unschooling, with lots of interests including video gaming, reading, <br/>
spontaneous role play acting, music, his animals and any number of <br/>
other things.  He loves spending time playing and talking with his <br/>
dad and I, and occasionally hangs out with some of the neighbor kids <br/>
his age or older.  He knows he is welcome to invite someone over <br/>
anytime, and does this on occasion.  He did a lot more when he was 5-<br/>
6 or so; a couple of kids ended up practically living at our house <br/>
for a year.  We have participated in some homeschooling activities <br/>
over the past couple of years, mostly parties and bowling or roller <br/>
skating type of activities.  He is now not interested in going, for <br/>
the most part, to any group-type things, no matter what the activity <br/>
is.  I try to present them in a light manner, and accept his interest <br/>
level (or lack of).  Yet I worry that he is not interacting with <br/>
enough other people in the world.  (I know, what is &quot;enough&quot;?)  He is <br/>
at ease socially with family, friends, and even new people we meet, <br/>
no lack of social skills there.  We spend a lot of time at home, but <br/>
do go out on usually at least a weekly basis to the zoo or museums, <br/>
new restaurants, galleries, happenings around town....<br/>
<br/>
He is happy.  Maybe just a small group kind of guy?  Or should I be <br/>
nudging him out a bit more?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds great to me.<br/>
<br/>
He may have &quot;seasons&quot; in which he wants to socialize more. He may  <br/>
eventually develop an interest that requires that he go to some  <br/>
outside activity on a regular basis - karate, zoo-keeping, who knows?<br/>
<br/>
But if he&#39;s calm and happy now, hanging around with you and with the  <br/>
balance of time spent at home and out, then HURRAY! Enjoy it.<br/>

<br/>
Marty has gone back and forth over his life between having one best  <br/>
friend, having no real friends but immersing himself in Lego and  <br/>
games, and then having several friends, and then holing up again, but  <br/>
not in any kind of sad or needy way, just inward again.  Marty is  <br/>
also the kid of person who enjoys being alone.  He doesn&#39;t mind going  <br/>
to a movie alone or eating alone.  I find that horribly sad and  <br/>
WRONG, because I myself am needy. &lt;g&gt;  If I have to eat alone in  <br/>
public, the cost of the meal goes up $4 or so because if I don&#39;t have  <br/>
a book with me I will have to buy a magazine or I just cannot  <br/>
physically sit and eat.  I can get drive-through food, but still I  <br/>
have to read something (usually there&#39;s something in the car,  <br/>
though).  I have gone to movies alone twice in my life and both times  <br/>
felt pitifully alone and unloved.     Yeah, that is MY problem.    <br/>
Somewhere back there in the depths of my childhood I defined myself  <br/>
as &quot;right&quot; when I had a friend and &quot;loser&quot; when I wasn&#39;t with someone  <br/>
else, maybe.  Or maybe I&#39;m just a classic case of what they call  <br/>
&quot;extrovert.&quot;  I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s good or pathological that I can&#39;t  <br/>
go to lunch and a movie by myself.<br/>
<br/>
Keith, that person from whom Marty got so much of his genetic makeup,  <br/>
can very happily go to lunch by himself.  He can go to a movie alone  <br/>
and has done so LOTS of times, and very happily.   So I see it as  <br/>
fine in Keith (though it took a few years to really believe he wasn&#39;t  <br/>
hiding that he was feeling like me) but I still worry that Marty  <br/>
NEEDS more people.  He doesn&#39;t.   And on those occasions when he  <br/>
does, he makes a few phone calls and gets up a bowling party or movie- <br/>
and-dinner group, and goes.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t attach yourself to either stage of your son&#39;s activities, if  <br/>
you can help it, and accept (if you can) that he might go through  <br/>
year-or-two long periods of being one way or another.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Deanna.  I just thought I&#39;d let you know that my son took the whole <br/>
year off last year.  He is normally a very outgoing boy, but, for some <br/>
reason, he didn&#39;t really want to do much of anything last year.  So, <br/>
we stayed home.  He is 11 this year and he&#39;s decided he wants to do <br/>
more now.  So, we&#39;re looking into things that interest him.  For us, <br/>
it was just a break to recharge.  Your kid sounds great!<br/>
