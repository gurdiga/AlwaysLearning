&lt;&lt; My daughter, however, had no problem making that<br/>
 transission. As soon as she turned 18, she quit asking permission and just<br/>
 started announcing that she was going to do something or go somewhere. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm...my kids have already made THAT transition!!!!<br/>
My 12 y.o. left me a note a couple weeks ago....it detailed where he was <br/>
going (to Toys-R-Us) how he was getting there (on his bike) and when he would <br/>
be home (an hour).<br/>
He went shopping and came back when he was done.<br/>
I thanked him for leaving a detailed note so I wouldn&#39;t worry.<br/>
I think that is the great thing about unschooling....they don&#39;t have to make <br/>
unecessary transitions at 18. <br/>
