<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146365719">If you&#39;re reading this July 25, there is going to be (or is, or was) a chat for two hours on the topic of awe and wonder.<br/>
I won&#39;t put a weekly chat reminder on this list, but wanted to say a few things about these chats.<br/>
<br/>
I know the time is inconvenient for those in India, Australia and New Zealand; sorry about that.  If there comes enough interest, I&#39;m willing to do something late enough at my house that it&#39;s waking hours there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the chats work by people typing in, and it&#39;s all happening at once, which is too quick for some people&#39;s tastes.  No one really needs to write anything, though.  You can read, maybe ask a question and read some more.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing online chats since 1995, on and off. :-)   <br/>
Sometimes I save transcripts and sometimes I don&#39;t.  Sometimes the transcripts are fun to read and sometimes they aren&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
But being in a live chat is a different kind of experience, and I invite you to check it out if you want to.  It doesn&#39;t hurt anyone&#39;s feelings if you enter the room, find it&#39;s too fast, and leave.  <br/>
<br/>
I just took two months off for being in Europe (and travelling nearly every Wednesday, as it happened).  Now I&#39;m back!<br/>
<br/>
Except for the week of the conference in Florida ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://floridaunschoolingconference.com/">http://floridaunschoolingconference.com/</a> mid-October ) there will be a chat every Wednesday until Christmas.   The day after Christmas I&#39;ll be doing set up and ferrying speakers for a symposium here in Albuquerque ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/">http://allunschooling2012.blogspot.com/</a> , another thing you might want to consider attending).<br/>
<br/>
Information on the chats, and a way to subscribe to weekly reminders, is here: <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m taking this week to discuss something current, but generally we&#39;re going through The Big Book of Unschooling and we&#39;re up to page 83, Music, for August 1.<br/>
