<div id="ygrps-yiv-146767375">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 8 months pregnant, the weather has just turned really cold, and I&#39;m having a lot of difficulty getting my 2 year old to wear his winter gear and get him down the three flights of stairs (and back up) in order to go out.  Usually we really enjoy getting out a lot, so this is a challenging time for me.  I&#39;m finding I just don&#39;t have the strength to carry him with all of our winter gear on and those flights of stairs. <br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m imagining that the next two months or so are going to be spent more indoors - and I&#39;d love some more ideas for what to do.  We already watch lots of kids shows, and play games online.  I have arts and crafts supplies - and we paint and color and glue and cut.  Taking baths with toys helps the day flow too.  We bake, read books, sew a bit.  We&#39;re working on getting some new toys to liven things up as well - a trip to Value Village soon.  Even so, it seems like the two of them (2.5 and 5.5 years old) turn to the games on the internet, or TV shows, for much of the day.  Its great, and I watch with them.  But I feel that sometimes its out of boredom, because I&#39;ve run out of everything I can think of to make things sparkly.  I&#39;d like to choose from fun and fun, not things they are already bored of.  We seem to be getting one cold after another as well, which makes having friends over more difficult. <br/>
<br/>
So, I would love more ideas for stuff to do at home.  I think my 5.5 year old daughter would really like some more &#39;guided&#39; crafts to do, along with all the loose art we do.  And any ideas on what to do about toddlers and winter gear and stairs.  If there isn&#39;t snow, perhaps I can get him some warm long underwear and skip the snowpants.  He really hates the snowpants.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Snow or no snow, my kids have preferred wearing layers over winter gear.  They would rather get wet and change into dry things.  I remember being that way too!  The best winter item I ever got was a snug fitting thermal that repelled water, like wool, but it wasn&#39;t wool.  I got it when I was 15 and I still have it and it still works great.  I paid a LOT of money for it at the time, but given that I&#39;ve had it for over 20 yrs, I think it was worth it!<br/>
<br/>
If you can find wool leggings for kids, that seems ideal.  But really, a pair of thermals under sweat pants seems to work for a couple of hrs before they get too cold from being wet.  You can pack a set for changing into.  Snow pants are bulky and uncomfortable!  I&#39;ve also used garbage bags as clothing under sweat pants.  It&#39;s weird but it works.  I learned that trick from Girl Scout survival training.<br/>
<br/>
***So, I would love more ideas for stuff to do at home. I think my 5.5 year old daughter would really like some more &#39;guided&#39; crafts to do, along with all the loose art we do.***<br/>
<br/>
If she likes that sort of thing, why not just add something cool into the mix, like giant chenille craft sticks, or puff balls and googly eyes, or left over wrapping paper, or something more open ended like play dough, you can even make your own. <br/>
<br/>
***Even so, it seems like the two of them (2.5 and 5.5 years old) turn to the games on the internet, or TV shows, for much of the day. Its great, and I watch with them. But I feel that sometimes its out of boredom, because I&#39;ve run out of everything I can think of to make things sparkly.***<br/>
<br/>
Do the kids seem happy and getting along?  If so, I&#39;d leave it be.  You don&#39;t need to make everyday exceptional.  Some days can be average.  Bring interesting things in to add to average days.  It&#39;s that little bit of exceptional that can spark interest and excitement.  To do it everyday sounds exhausting!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My kids have rarely watched TV as a solo activity.  What do they do while watching?  Do they play with toys or build things, or move around?  Maybe think about adding to those things.<br/>

<h4>Rippy and Graham Dusseldorp</h4>
<time>28 Dec 2011, at  1:00pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-494086970">When the downstairs neighbour was on holiday a couple of winters ago, we turned our living room into a rollerblading ring and the children learned how to rollerblade. We play ball games such as throwing little basketballs in a hoop, bowling and playing baseball with a balloon. We like making and doing obstacle courses. We often have dance afternoons with different themes, our personal favourite being bhangra/bollywood dance music where we get all dressed up and jeweled up. Other favourites are Abba, Barbie and superhero dance afternoons, with appropriate costumes and accessories. We sing a lot too (while dancing or not), and I think the children would love a karaoke machine, but we don&#39;t have one yet. <br/>
<br/>
The children like to pretend to be Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson and I plant clues for them to solve a mystery. Or they plant clues or do something secretive and I have to figure out what it is. We like to make complicated marble runs with objects we have in the house and hang little bells and try to have the marbles ring the bell. We have a big kapla set that we sometimes build with and we also love trying to make contraptions with the kapla - this is an example: www.mindwarewholesale.com/Solutions/PDF/44156W.pdf<br/>
<br/>
With a two year old though, this might be difficult. When my daughter was younger, I used to sit in the middle and help the children each make their own buildings and simple contraptions. Otherwise it didn&#39;t work. Now they like to build things together.<br/>
<br/>
For crafts we often get inexpensive ideas from The Crafty Cow - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://belladia.typepad.com/crafty_crow/">http://belladia.typepad.com/crafty_crow/</a><br/>
<br/>
The kids love playing around with the camera and I&#39;m fine with it as long as I can see what they are doing. Sometimes I give them little assignments, such as take a picture of something that makes you happy, something green, something old, something that starts with the letter B, something stinky. They *love* making movies of themselves on photo booth on our mac computer. <br/>
<br/>
When I was low on energy and late in my pregnancy, my favourite thing to do was to take long baths with my toddler. I would bring books and toys and stay as long as we could. Then I&#39;d make a comfy nest on the sofa with popcorn and a mixed plate of food and we&#39;d watch movies and t.v. while we cuddled. And then I&#39;d repeat the whole thing (hopefully with a nap in between) until my husband came home and did more active stuff with our son. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1421037035">I agree that layers seem more tolerable oftentimes to young ones.  You can make wool or cashmere pants very easily and inexpensively from old wool sweater sleeves from the thrift store.  Here&#39;s a simple pattern: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.greenkitchen.com/blog/2008/09/sweater-sleeve-kid-pants-tutorial.html">http://www.greenkitchen.com/blog/2008/09/sweater-sleeve-kid-pants-tutorial.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Another option is to throw the sweater into a hot wash/cold rinse with some dish soap and then into the dryer to felt the wool which will make it thicker and more water resistant.  You can cut the sleeves off and use them as thigh-high e.g. warmers/gators without needing to sew them into pants. If the top part is too loose, thread a ribbon through the top with a wide-eyed needle.<br/>

to go to town with masking tape or washi tape, building tracks and roads<br/>

imagine it could be days worth of entertainment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332895689">My littles love lots of the activities mentioned as well repeating holidays<br/>
just for fun.  They like to play trick or treat when we get small toys or<br/>
bags of candy.  They also like to fill plastic eggs and hide them<br/>
throughout the house to gather with baskets.  We often t really busy around<br/>
Christmas, so we opt to make New Year and Valentines candy houses.  Dying<br/>
eggs is always fun too!<br/>
Sometimes we&#39;ll look up obscure or foreign holidays to see some of their<br/>
traditions as well.  I&#39;m pregnant with my 12th right now (9th pregnancy) so<br/>
I completely understand your exhaustion!  Try to take it easy, and don&#39;t<br/>
stress too much it the kids seem happy.  I second the thought that TV is<br/>
rarely a solo activity. This morning my 5yo daughter, Anja, was watching a<br/>
superhero movie, surrounded with her anime and graphic novels, drawing<br/>
alongside my husband, creating their own story lines, using the movie as<br/>
inspiration. You never know what those easy going days in front of the tv<br/>
or computer are going to lead to.<br/>
Take care,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re in the US, my 5.5 and 2.7 year old have been playing with this for DAYS now.  We got it on sale at Michaels for under $10 (I think it might have been $8)!<br/>

Messy magic wizard kit (basic chemistry) but that&#39;s when we pull out the shower curtain as our magic carpet.  I made a second wizard hat as the kit only comes with one.  My 5.5 year old LOVES TV but this kit has her enthralled.  There are plenty of materials to do the spells (experiments) over and over again.  The test tubes alone are going to be hours of fun even after the kit materials are all used.<br/>
<br/>
We also got a Smithsonian kit from Michaels on sale that simulates a dig for jewels.  The jewels are small, but my 5.5 year old LOVED this one, too.  We had extra goggles from a kids toolkit set so my 2.7 year old enjoyed discovering alongside her big sis.  I believe this one was under $10, too.<br/>

<br/>
This season, I&#39;ve made handrolled candles from sheets of beeswax with my girls.  They added ribbons to make them extra festive as well as just played with the beeswax.  We ate honeycomb alongside it for an extrasensory experience!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been saving empty toilet paper rolls and having a TON of them has made for interesting inventions by my girls -- instruments, fishing poles, binoculars, bowling pins, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I splurged at Michaels and bought a $4 hot glue gun (not for the kids to use) but I also got a 1 LB. bag of acrylic &quot;gems&quot; and my girls were entranced by their beauty and wanting to decorate their Xmas stockings with them. They laid them out and I glued them on.  I was wondering if they were going to want to bejewel their clothing -- not yet!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been beading jewelry necklaces and bracelets (make sure the beads are easy enough to thread -- my 2.7 needs bigger beads and bead holes than my 5.5 year old).<br/>
<br/>
I also gave the girls wool felt pieces and yarn needles (big, dull needles) to sew their own pointy hats for their dolls.  We made pom pom tops for the hats, too.  My 2.7 didn&#39;t really sew on her own, but she enjoyed pulling the needle once I had pushed it into the fabric.  My 5.5 year old sewed a good amount of her own hat.<br/>
<br/>
When my 5 year old was 2.7 and I was pregnant (in chilly wintry London) and directed to rest as much as possible, we baked sugar cookies, made all kinds of shapes and decorated with icing (from little squeeze tubes) and sprinkles.<br/>
<br/>
We made short books (4 or 6 pages) where I drew the images and my 2.7 year old painted them.  Some were short rhymes from a book we were reading and others we made up.  It&#39;s really nice to have these as a memory of the time!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; --- And any ideas on what to do about toddlers and winter gear and stairs. If there isn&#39;t snow, perhaps I can get him some warm long underwear and skip the snowpants. He really hates the snowpants. ---<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I could not get my then 2.7 to wear a thick coat in the London winter (we live in Los Angeles).  I would bring it with me and let her experience the cold and then suggest we either head home or she put the coat on.  She was running around so much at the playground that she was surprisingly relatively warm.  We also had bought expensive thermal underwear from Patagonia and layered it with regular clothing, a sweater and a fleece jacket.  My second daughter uses the flannel as PJs and they are still in almost new condition!  Having the right mittens (or gloves), a scarf and hat were key.  Having warm tea or soup to bring in a thermos also helps.  For us, making an adventure of the day -- planning on visiting a favorite toy store got us out the door which then could lead us to the park.<br/>
<br/>
If I had snow and bulky clothes to contend with now, I&#39;d probably talk about going to the moon, moonboots, spacesuits and needing protection (my kids pretend they are astronauts often).  The house could be the spaceship and the outside would be our moonscape to explore!<br/>
<br/>
For the colds -- I boost vitamin D3, elderberry syrup and try to keep physically active most winter days to support immunity.  Knock on wood that one daughter has not gotten sick and my other was only mildly ill.<br/>
<br/>
Impressed that you have one in the oven -- I feel I can barely keep up with 2!  Take good care of yourself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634199728">An idea for getting out the door ­ put all the winter gear in a plastic bag<br/>
and have the kids either bump it down the stairs or throw it down each<br/>
flight.  You can get dressed on the first floor inside the door to the<br/>
outside.  Maybe you could get an old chair to put by the door to the outside<br/>
so you&#39;d have a place to sit while helping them.  Then, when you come in you<br/>
can just leave everything in the bag and your husband/partner (if you have<br/>
one) could bring it upstairs when he/she gets home.  If you don&#39;t have one,<br/>
maybe you could enlist a neighbor to do it for you for the next couple of<br/>
months.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1945197304">Wow, thanks everyone.  There are some really great ideas here.  <br/>
<br/>
I know the questions about what my kids do while they are watching TV were for my self-reflection - but I am curious.  The 2 year old will go off and play with blocks or lego or train tracks while watching sometimes.  But overall they really do sit and watch intently with concentration and very little other activity/movement, both when using the TV/couch/floor, and when using the big computer/computer chair.  Are other&#39;s children this intent and not doing other things at the same time?<br/>
<br/>
We had tons of fun building a road around our floor with tape a few weeks back (one of the suggestions made here) - and it really was a great idea.  Just a warning... we&#39;re renters and it turned out that taking the tape up also pulled up some surface of the wood floor.  I thought masking tape wouldn&#39;t damage the floors.  Luckily, they are old floors in bad shape, so the landlord won&#39;t care.  But I&#39;d test the floors in a small place if I ever tried this again anywhere else - or find some special tape.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all of the ideas!  I especially like the one of giving the kids cameras and sending them on missions for what to photograph.  Kind of like a treasure hunt, which they love. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1650792710">There is painter&#39;s tape that removes extremely easily.  I&#39;m thinking the brand we&#39;ve used is blue.<br/>
<br/>
If you have carpeting - I&#39;ve used the non-sticky backed Velcro to make lines on the floor - I bought a huge roll of it on eBay - just the hook half as I didn&#39;t need the fuzzy (loop) half.  Test first of course to make sure it does not leave a visible mark when you pull it.  If you have carpet with a really short nap it might leave a visible mark.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s also drafting tape. It looks like masking tape but it doesn&#39;t have as much sticky stuff on it so it can be pulled off drafting paper.<br/>

Kathryn never played while she watched. She definitely drew as a teen but she may have just watched when she was younger.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1330061066">----I splurged at Michaels and bought a $4 hot glue gun (not for the kids to use)----<br/>
<br/>
You may want to reconsider this....it depends on what your child is comfortable with, of course, but Noor used a hot glue gun herself at five, maybe even a bit before that.  She burned herself a few times, but nothing serious, and for her, it was worth it to be able to make her creations without my help.<br/>
<br/>
For what it&#39;s worth, I found that the smaller glue guns run much hotter than the larger ones.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite creations from that time was this flamingo marionette:<br/>

<br/>
A huge roll of alumni foil was one of her main materials. She&#39;d use it for the core/body of her creations and glue fabric, felt, feathers, cardboard, etc onto the internal structure.  The flamingo in the picture was pipe cleaners, an old coffee can, and foil.  Craft stores have HUGE bags of feathers for a few bucks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830160007">-=-I know the questions about what my kids do while they are watching TV were for my self-reflection - but I am curious. The 2 year old will go off and play with blocks or lego or train tracks while watching sometimes. But overall they really do sit and watch intently with concentration and very little other activity/movement, both when using the TV/couch/floor, and when using the big computer/computer chair. Are other&#39;s children this intent and not doing other things at the same time?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Some are and some aren&#39;t, but when a mom is worried about lack of stimulation, it seems worth advising going for a two-for-one experience.<br/>

Did your spell check change &quot;aluminum&quot; to &quot;alumni&quot;?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I had a lot of fun with waxed paper and a pencil, aluminum foil and a pencil,  and all kinds of things involving those kinds of wrapping materials as art materials.<br/>

Mo&#39;s very intent when watching something new - she wants to soak in as much as possible. By the second or sometimes third viewing she&#39;s back to multi-tasking. So if you&#39;re offering a lot of new things to keep them interested, it&#39;s not unlikely they&#39;ll really hunker down and focus, even if they might do multi-task otherwise.<br/>

There are &quot;low melt&quot; hot glue guns and glue - hot but not enough to burn. The catch is, it dries much faster, so you have to be quick and really have your fingers right there in the glue.. but it doesn&#39;t burn. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1189252814">A few years ago we made a &quot;bean bin.&quot; Sort of a variation on the &quot;rice table.&quot; Just got a low tupperware (like you would store sweaters in under a bed) and filled it with a whole bunch of bags of 15 bean soup mix. Throw in scoops, toy cars, bowls, empty cans, paper towel tubes, etc. and you&#39;ve got hours of fun. <br/>
<br/>
We also do the same concept but with water. I just fill a big tupperware with warm water (sometimes soapy) and throw out a bunch of big bowls or pots and cups and funnels and egg beaters. Playmobil people get brought in and bath toys and boats and all manner of things.<br/>
<br/>
They key for me to make all of this easy is painter&#39;s plastic and beach towels. You can buy a roll of thin painter&#39;s dropcloth plastic at the hardware store for a few bucks, then just cut off a huge sqare and lay it on the kitchen floor. Throw down some beach towels or an old blanket or sheet and the mess is really contained. (Careful walking on it, though, it can be slippery!). <br/>
<br/>
Messy parties are also fun (and again, with the painters plastic, I just wad up the whole thing at the end and throw it all in the garbage). Make a few piles of flour, shaving cream, cooked pasta (leftovers work great!), food coloring, pudding...whatever. I fill a dishpan with warm soapy water and have a bunch of dishtowels on hand, too, for washing up. Makes it so much easier!<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-120590530">Did you all see this show that includes an unschooling family?<br/>
The show is &quot;Our America with Lisa Ling&quot; on Oprah&#39;s network and the episode is called &quot;Extreme Parenting,&quot; (whose title gave me the idea that unschooling would be involved..).<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how old it is - it seems to have just been posted this week.<br/>
Here is the link:<br/>

It seems that every news show I see about unschooling is pretty similar to this one....</div>
