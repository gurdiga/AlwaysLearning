<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918448614">Regarding the following (Sandra&#39;s quote from below)...would you be talking about the administration, or the peers, or both?  I was thinking about this powerful statement; thinking about my own experience in growing up in the system, thinking about current stories I hear about how some ps kids treat one another, and really feel sad at all that is lost with that environment.  I really like to be around my kids for more reasons than I am interested in writing right now, however, I will write about one of these.  I like being around them, so that when something is said to them, or within earshot, that is contrary to my &#39;good feelings?&#39;, I am there to talk about that with them.  For example, perhaps a weird example?, my son&#39;s in baseball, and I hang around by the dugout...seems the &quot;mean coach&quot; acts a bit nicer when I&#39;m so close.  Anyway, one day one of the boys tooted...to which many of the boys were saying &quot;ooohhh, who farted?&quot;  &quot;that&#39;s bad&quot;, etc...  Well, one of the coaches was<br/>
 standing there, and looked at me with embarrassment, (I was laughing)and spoke with them, kind of laughing, trying to get serious, saying, &quot;there is a lady out here, boys, we can&#39;t act like that around lady&#39;s!&quot;  My point of the story is, that I spoke with my son about it later, about the acting around lady&#39;s...to which I don&#39;t hold those values dear to my own.    <br/>

The whole environment. You&#39;re right, the kids do it to each other  too.  <br/>
Teachers and tests and grade/age/course, they all do it.  <br/>
