<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950525767">One good thing about New York:  It&#39;s close to Dean Sluyter, one of my very <br/>
favorite authors ever, so if any of you are near enough and have the <br/>
inclination and logistics to make this, go and tell me about it!    And if <br/>
you&#39;re interested in looking at sample passages from two GREAT books, look <br/>
