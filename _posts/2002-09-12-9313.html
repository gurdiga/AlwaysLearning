<div id="ygrps-yiv-756857522">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking at my little guy, 5.5, and wondering if he wants more time with<br/>
kids his own age. He plays often with the neighborhood kids, mostly older<br/>
kids, mixed genders, after school odf course He has his almost 3 sister he<br/>
plays with all day. We usually go to playgroup or parkday at least 1 time a<br/>
week and play for 2-4 hours with lots of kids. Occasionally I&#39;ll line up a<br/>
playtime with another family. My deal is I&#39;m not in a social mood these days.<br/>
So much so that I took a break from leading LLL meetings. I&#39;m growing I guess<br/>
and need some refective time. I also am not into hosting families at my house,<br/>
too messy, not enough room for big play. I&#39;ll meet people at the park. I<br/>
babysat for a while and I think I&#39;m burned out form taking care of even more<br/>
kids. I should be sending my kids to a baysitter. The other thing is my guy<br/>
does not really like alot of the other kids his age. He misses his friend who<br/>
moved to Texas, so whenever I ask who to invite over, I get the sobs for an<br/>
answer about his friend. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering what other families have done to satisfy the need for<br/>
unstructured group activity for the younger set. <br/>
