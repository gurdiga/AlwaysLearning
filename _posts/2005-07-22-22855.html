<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061281796">Hi,Roberta~<br/>
It was really nice to read your response to Sandra.You managed to <br/>
stay restrained&intelligent even though you felt that she was putting <br/>
you down.Thanks.<br/>
I haven&#39;t met Sandra,but the feeling I get after having read quite a <br/>
bit of what she&#39;s written is that she just very strongly believes in <br/>
unschooling&wants to make sure that all who say they&#39;re unschooling <br/>
are approaching it as a &#39;whole life&#39;,not just in the areas <br/>
involving &#39;book learning&#39;.She also seems to be very busy&comes off as <br/>
sharp when her words may just be more &#39;to the point&#39;(HER point~lol!)<br/>
than some of us are ready for!(throw in a LOT of &#39;caring&#39;&you&#39;ll be <br/>
able to see that her message is on your side)<br/>
Don&#39;t think I&#39;m expressing this very well~just wanted you to know <br/>
that I felt you&#39;d said it all when you explained that you&your <br/>
daughter had talked about your situation&it clearly showed me that <br/>
she wants to help so that you do have more time together&for <br/>
yourself.She sounds like such a sweetheart!You HAVE talked to her <br/>
about choices&she&#39;s making them every day~ <br/>
We&#39;ll be down in the spring but to Playa del Carmen~can&#39;t wait!<br/>
Terri<br/>
~&Sandra~my apologies in advance if I&#39;ve offended you or gotten it <br/>
wrong.My DH says I am the most blunt person on the face of the <br/>
Earth....</div>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m trying to make sure all who say they&#39;re unschooling are doing anything.   <br/>
Many don&#39;t even want to try to do more than just not have kids in school.<br/>
<br/>
What I am trying to do is make sure that this list (which is my list) isn&#39;t <br/>
diluted with an air of &quot;whatever.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Might sound close, but there are lots of unschooler&#39;s whove never heard of me <br/>
and I&#39;ll never hear of them.   That&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
I want to discuss unschooling, how it works, and how it can work better.   <br/>
<br/>
