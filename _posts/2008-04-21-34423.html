<div id="ygrps-yiv-309207313">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to spread the word about my Disney World trip this fall (Labor<br/>
Day week). Disney has finally confirmed they&#39;re offering free dining again<br/>
during the time we&#39;ll be there and we can start reserving the free dining<br/>
packages now. I&#39;m trying to reach as many homeschoolers as possible so they<br/>
can take advantage of it before availability runs out. (They said that there<br/>
would be fewer packages this year.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m located in South Carolina, but all homeschoolers are welcome to join us<br/>
on our trip. We&#39;re trying to get more older homeschoolers to join us this<br/>
year, if possible, so that we can reserve the higher level educational<br/>
programs (with more of a career and behind-the-scenes focus) in addition to<br/>
the elementary and middle school programs. We&#39;re not travel agents and don&#39;t<br/>
make a commission on rooms (as a matter of fact, all of our travelers choose<br/>
their own hotels and reserve themselves). We just want the opportunity to<br/>
enjoy more of the educational programs this year and need more older<br/>
homeschoolers to make the minimum for the programs.<br/>
<br/>
Our tickets will be heavily discounted, and will include theme parks, water<br/>
parks, Disney Quest, and special educational programs. The free dining just<br/>
makes the deal even better!<br/>
<br/>
