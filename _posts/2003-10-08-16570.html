Yeah, and any minute I&#39;ll be getting the &quot;unschoolier than thou -<br/>
unschooling dogmatist!!&quot;  note on the side ( or in public!) from you know<br/>
who. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

Sticking my nose in again. But what have I missed in the months I was off <br/>
list(s)? I know that unschoolingdiscussion changed names like two times and <br/>
owners too. (Thank goodness this one stayed the same!) And I was confused for a <br/>
time, but what is this about other lists? Why are there other lists? Rather, for <br/>
what reasons did other lists need/want/havetobe formed? Anyone care to catch <br/>
me up, or is it just too much to get into? And how exactly can a person be an <br/>
unschooling dogmatist? This isn&#39;t a religion, or do I really not know what the <br/>
word means?<br/>
<br/>
~Nancy~Full of questions today! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Helen said the plan all along for Unschooling.com was to have multiple<br/>
lists. There was sort of an expectation that the<br/>
Unschooling-dotcom/Unschooling-Discussion list should be everything to every<br/>
unschooler when it couldn&#39;t be.<br/>
<br/>
There was probably a blow up that prompted the effort to create more lists<br/>
but that&#39;s pretty much the whole boring story.<br/>

When a more radical unschooler tells someone who doesn&#39;t want to really <br/>
unschool that something or other isn&#39;t going to produce unschooling results, then <br/>
the less radical unschooler might upon occasion say to the more radical <br/>
unschooler something like<br/>
You think you own unschooling<br/>
or<br/>
Not everyone has to unschool the way you do<br/>
or<br/>
There are as many ways to unschool as there are unschoolers<br/>
or<br/>
Who died and made you god?<br/>
<br/>
or something suggesting that the person who honestly only really wanted to <br/>
help them be courageous and free is somehow trying to limit their unschooling to <br/>
just radical, actual, workable unschooling.<br/>
