<div id="ygrps-yiv-272897609">For those of you who have to comply by state requirements to <br/>
homeschool, how do you keep that separate of (even in your mind) <br/>
unschooling your kids?  What I mean is, if you have to translate <br/>
things your kids are doing into Schooly language for state <br/>
assessments, or if you are required to do portfolios or other such <br/>

I&#39;ve asked some of this here before, but it&#39;s a continuing problem <br/>
for me given the requirements of this state and I&#39;ll be needing to <br/>
do out first leagally offical assessment this fall (given that <br/>

I&#39;ve been trying to keep a small notebook journal of what they are <br/>
doing and label it with different &quot;subject&quot; headings so that I can <br/>
remember all they did when I have to write out a year end <br/>
assessment.  But it&#39;s hard to pull my head out of whatever fun thing <br/>
they or we are doing and translate that into schoolish language at <br/>
any given moment, even without them knowning anyting about what I&#39;m <br/>

defensive &quot;forgetting&quot; because it doesn&#39;t feel nice to do it.<br/>

your assessments and intend to use that as a model this fall, so <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799281118">Hi Nanci,<br/>
   <br/>
  I am new to this group and fairly new to unschooling although not to homeschooling. I would love to see what Mary Ellen has shared if she doesn&#39;t mind. :-)<br/>
   <br/>
  We live if Florida which requires a year-end evaluation. I have been very, very careful to choose an evaluator that is extremely child-friendly. She does not unschool but she does homeschool and is very accepting of different views. Of course, it helps that my boys are scoring extremely well each year. :-) <br/>
   <br/>
  My youngest has always been homeschooled and the last few years we have been leaning more and more to unschooling from necessity since I have been a single mom with two jobs. The longer we do child-led learning the more Daniel shows me that I should trust him to know what he needs to learn. I love his curiosity!<br/>
   <br/>
  This week we did his yearly evaluation  which is an individual test that is done in part verbally and in part written with the evaluator. I am able to sit next to Daniel and observe everything that he does so that I can see where he is strong in his abilities and where he is still learning. <br/>
   <br/>
  There were several problems that he knew how to do but he missed them because he was not familiar with the way the question was asked. However, our evaluator was very good about going back after each segment of questions and answering any questions that Daniel had so that the evaluation ended up being an awesome learning experience for all of us. Daniel told the evaluator how he figured all the math in his head. Some of the problems were difficult for the evaluator and me to do on paper. LOL<br/>
   <br/>
  Last year he scored well enough to go from 1st to 3rd grade so this year I had prepared all of us for a smaller improvement. However, Daniel blew us all away with another big jump. His reading is on an 8th grade level and math and spelling on a 6th grade level. He asked if he could be in 5th grade and when I asked him why he needed to have a grade level he said it was because people asked him all the time what grade he is in. We will be having a discussion about grade levels and what they are used for. :-) Definately not useful in our homeschool because we school year-round and just keep learning everyday.<br/>
   <br/>
  The other requirements for Florida are a portfolio and a list of books that are read and/or used for educational purposes. The list is easy enough, we just write down all the info of each book we read or use to learn about our interests. <br/>
   <br/>
  The portfolio is a little harder but I have the philosphy that as a former private and public school teacher, I never kept everything that each child in my classroom did so why should I keep everything my own child does. <br/>
   <br/>
  I just choose projects that give an overall view of what we do. Like today, we were on the city bus and Daniel was reading the book, Eldest, so I took a picture of him to add to his portfolio which is becoming more and more like a scrapbook. :-) It contains pictures of Daniel participating at library bookclubs, digging in the sand and exploring tidepools at the beach, visiting the aquarium and zoo, taking science classes with his friends, cooking with his brother, measuring the wall to see if it is long enough for his piano to be moved against it, learning fencing moves because he loves the swordfights in his latest book that he is reading, etc. <br/>
   <br/>
  Everything we do on any given day is a learning experience. We recently went to see a full-size replica of the Nina, one of the boats that Christopher Columbus sailed. What a way to explore some history hands-on! We were able to board the ship and explore everything. It was awesome and made for a wonderful photo op for the portfolio.<br/>
   <br/>
  I hope this helps you a little but since I don&#39;t know what your requirements are, it may not. :-) I think the most important thing is to be positive about all your child is doing. <br/>
   <br/>
  My favorite thought is: I KNOW that Daniel is getting a better education than he would be getting in the school system so... if anyone questions me about what is appropriate and what isn&#39;t for his education, I turn the tables and ask them some really tough questions about what the school system offers. What would he be getting in the school system that would be any better? Can they guarantee me that my child would be better treated or better repected as a person? Can they guarantee me that he will learn more than he is right now?? I KNOW the answer would be a resounding &quot;no!&quot; so I feel very confident that Daniel and I are meeting our obligations where his education is concerned.<br/>
   <br/>
  Sorry this was so long. :-) Have a good weekend. Krystal<br/>

It&#39;s very likely that if you talk to unschoolers in your state (on a  <br/>
local list) they&#39;ll have lots of ideas and shortcuts they&#39;ve  <br/>
developed, and it&#39;s likely you&#39;re thinking you need to do more than  <br/>
necessary in any case.<br/>

realized it would drive me crazy to catagorize something <br/>

could fall into EVERY subject (or none at all)so how would i even do <br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
What i thought might be neat, though, would just to take a lot of <br/>
pictures (digital cameras are great for this). My camera even has a <br/>
video function so i can take little movies too. I recently watched <br/>
some &quot;interviews&quot; i did of Seamus last January, so cool to see how <br/>
much he&#39;s changed. So you could take a couple pics of whatever they <br/>
do whether its some cool Lego construction, or baking cookies, or a <br/>
walk in the park, or a museum visit...and maybe at some point <br/>
compile a scrapbook. Then, if you HAD to make a list for your state <br/>
requirements (if a scrapbook wouldnt count as a portfolio),you could <br/>
just do it at the end of the year, and not drive yourself crazy <br/>
throughout the year. And taking pictures or making a scrapbook would <br/>
be more about preserving precious family memories for the future, <br/>
and less about figuring out what subject &quot;fits&quot; in order to please <br/>
some school official.<br/>

Hi Nanci,<br/>
<br/>
  I am new to this group and fairly new to unschooling although<br/>
not  to  homeschooling. I would love to see what Mary Ellen has<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1058886179">This list isn&#39;t the place to get into details about complying with  <br/>
state laws-- each state is too specific.<br/>
<br/>
To take Nanci&#39;s state/situation as an example -- if you do some  <br/>
googling, you&#39;ll quickly discover an organization (FLO - Family  <br/>
Learning Organization) in Washington State that provides services to  <br/>
unschoolers in that state to help them meet the state requirements  <br/>
with the minimal amount of intrusion. This is a state that requires  <br/>
either annual standardized testing or a assessment by a certified  <br/>
person. BUT - this organization considers the parent to be a  <br/>
qualified proctor - so if you want to test, you can do it yourself.  <br/>
If you want to do the alternative kind of assessment, the PARENT does  <br/>
it - the organization provides forms for you to use and signs them  <br/>
and submits them.<br/>
<br/>
To go into more details about what people in Washington need to do  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be helpful to most of the almost 1,000 people on this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To respond to the general question about recordkeeping - what I&#39;d  <br/>
recommend is keeping your notes in a form NOT broken down by school  <br/>
subject. Keep track of things like: Listening, Watching, Talking,  <br/>
Looking, Playing, Making, Visiting, and so on. Then once a month or  <br/>
however often you absolutely HAVE to - go through and translate some  <br/>
of that into school subjects. So you might have written down:  <br/>
&quot;Visiting - went to hands-on children&#39;s museum. Spent a lot of time  <br/>
on the stop-action movie-making stuff.&quot;  Then you&#39;re filling out some  <br/>
form for the state and that could go under science or art, for  <br/>
example. Your records are not in the form of school subjects, so you  <br/>
don&#39;t have to be in that frame of mind very often AND you can put  <br/>
things under whatever category you need to when you DO translate them  <br/>
into school subjects.<br/>
<br/>
There is an &quot;Unschoolers Recordkeeping Form&quot; in the files area of the  <br/>
UnschoolingDiscussion yahoogroups list which gives more details/ideas  <br/>
along these lines.<br/>

&gt; for me given the requirements of this state and I&#39;ll be needing to<br/>
&gt; do out first leagally offical assessment this fall (given that<br/>
&gt; Thomas is now over 8 yrs, our compulsory age in WA) and I want to<br/>
&gt; not let this affect how they interact with the world and go about<br/>
&gt; learning things, nor how I am able to think about it myself.<br/>

<br/>
Even before I began to homeschool I kept a standard wall calendar to keep track of activities and appointments.  When I do the evaluation, I refer to my calendar to jog my memory.  We certainly don&#39;t have to account for every moment of our child&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
Although I do sometimes think &quot;oh that is (fill in the subject)&quot; when I am with my kids, I find that way of thinking is so limiting, and rarely relevant outside of school.  Right now Jackie is playing SIMS on the computer beside me.  I could find a way to link her activity to each of the &quot;subjects&quot;.  But she is not doing subjects.  She is playing a game.<br/>

Thank you Pam, this is a helpful suggestion.  One of<br/>
the problems I have been having is deciding where in<br/>
the hell to put things, under which &quot;subjects&quot; when I<br/>
am jotting down a notation about an activity.  I mean,<br/>
everything can be placed in so many category boxes if<br/>
you really want to box things, which I don&#39;t, that I&#39;m<br/>
never really sure what goes where, as Mary Ellen said.<br/>
 With your suggestion however, I can kind of balance<br/>
out the activities listed out over time in terms of<br/>
making sure each &quot;subject&quot; has plenty of things listed<br/>
under it.  There are 11 Subjects we are required to<br/>
cover in WA (occupational education, science,<br/>
mathematics, language, social studies, history,<br/>

if I for instance might have put something under<br/>
Science but it can also be put under Social Studies or<br/>
Health I can put it there instead if Science is<br/>
already adequately represented.  Bleh.  It also as you<br/>
said helps me not to have to think in schooly terms<br/>
all the time.  Thanks.<br/>

<br/>
Now, I know how to compensate or translate in an<br/>
unschooling way for most of that, I hope, and the law<br/>
does make mention of liberally construing time and<br/>
instructional methods because of the &quot;experiential<br/>
nature of homeschooling&quot; so that&#39;s pretty much all ok,<br/>
but my kids are not up to par &quot;consistent with his or<br/>

If that seems more important to you than the principles of  <br/>
unschooling, then do it to look more like the law.  That&#39;s fine, but  <br/>
this isn&#39;t a good list to discuss it on.<br/>
<br/>
If your family stays intact and the kids aren&#39;t abused, you won&#39;t be  <br/>
asked.  That legalese will come into play only if there&#39;s social  <br/>
action or a legal challenge, such as a custody dispute.  The vast  <br/>
majority of homeschoolers just do school at home, and you can too if  <br/>
you want to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-but my kids are not up to par &quot;consistent with his or<br/>
her age or stage of development&quot; (whatever that means)<br/>
because they have some different challenges.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are they up to what special ed kids their age would be doing if they  <br/>
were at school?  Maybe look into that.<br/>
<br/>

ages.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to be following all the curriculum-based state  <br/>
formats, you SHOULD use labels so you can get exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
In discussions about unschooling and natural learning, theyr&#39;e not as  <br/>
useful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-.  For years I considered not registering at all<br/>
to avoid having to do this labeling and explaining why<br/>
they are where they are developmentally (as if I know<br/>
*why* they are where they are, but you know what I<br/>
mean.) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Every choice we make affects what our future choices will be.  If  <br/>
registering seems good, you might just need to go in another  <br/>
direction than pure radical unschooling.     But unschooling within  <br/>
the parameters of your registration and all is still a doable thing,  <br/>
it&#39;s just not going to be the full-on unschooling I&#39;d like for this  <br/>
list to be about.<br/>
<br/>
There are lots of excuses and many good reasons for people to decide  <br/>
radical unschooling won&#39;t work.<br/>

blah, blah, blah...<br/>

I do this backwards.  My child did &quot;x&quot; activity.  When I do the assessment I categorize that under &quot;z&quot; subject.  The powers that be have no idea whether I planned the activity in advance of its occurrence, or not.<br/>
<br/>
The powers that be will most likely never see the assessment anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Relax!  Washington state has plenty of unschoolers meeting the legal requirements and probably quite a few under the radar.  It really is not a big deal.  Really!<br/>
<br/>
Do a Google search for Kathleen McCurdy.  She started FLO, (and was also one of the people involved in forming WA state&#39;s homeschooling laws), then sold it and is now remarried and living in South America.<br/>

on.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem more important to me.  It&#39;s what the<br/>
law says.  I don&#39;t like it, and I wish it said a whole<br/>
lot less about homeschooling so we could be left more<br/>
to our own devices.  My concern is trying to maintain<br/>
our unschooling home while not running afoul of the<br/>
law.  It&#39;s not so much the mechanics of abiding the<br/>
spirit of the law if not the letter, but the<br/>
unschooling principles and philosophies that get<br/>
smudged or stepped on by my having to toe that line. <br/>
It&#39;s adds more aggravation and effort to my life to<br/>
have to live in two worlds in my head like that, but I<br/>
do believe that unschooling is worth it.  I was just<br/>
looking for support and advice from others on walking<br/>
that line.  If I ask this question on State<br/>
homeschooling lists, I will get a range of<br/>
school-at-home type answers about curriculums and<br/>
such, or details about state requirements, and that&#39;s<br/>
not at all what I am looking for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If your family stays intact and the kids aren&#39;t<br/>
 </span></blockquote>abused, you &gt;won&#39;t be asked.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not necessarily true.  If I need to take Thomas<br/>
for therapy or medication (there is a possibility we<br/>
will have to break down and get him some med. to<br/>
prevent aggression and violence as he gets older and<br/>
bigger although we&#39;re working hard to avoid that) than<br/>
they will very likely (&quot;they&quot; being Dr.s and other<br/>
officials who work with state Mental/Physical Health<br/>
programs) will be intrusive about our homeschooling,<br/>
and about a lot of other aspects of our lives, and<br/>
there might be problems, if our previous run ins with<br/>
such officials or the experience of others we know in<br/>
this area is any indication.  There are more ways to<br/>
come to the attention of officials than divorce or<br/>
abuse. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;The vast majority of homeschoolers just do school at<br/>
 </span></blockquote>home, and &gt;you can too if you want to.<br/>
<br/>
I never said that I wanted to do that.  In fact I said<br/>
a number of times that I didn&#39;t want to do that.  I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t have these questions or concerns if I wanted<br/>
to do that.  We unschool.  We want to unschool.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Are they up to what special ed kids their age would<br/>

<br/>
Look into what?  Putting them in school?  That&#39;s not<br/>
what they or I want to do.  I am not aware of special<br/>
caveats in the law for homeschoolers with &quot;special<br/>
needs&quot; if that&#39;s what youmeant, although I have been<br/>
asking around for years, and there is not anything<br/>
specific about it in the RCW (the legal code) which<br/>
addresses homeschooling.  I am not interested in<br/>
registering my children with distance learning through<br/>
schools, an IEP, or a similar program either.  <br/>
<br/>
I frankly don&#39;t care for ourselves what their &quot;level&quot;<br/>
or whatever is compared to other kids, I am only<br/>
concerned about it with regards to getting assessments<br/>
approved without being harrassed, as the assessments<br/>
do care.  I want to be prepared in that event.  Maybe<br/>
I will find the assessor is not so picky and we won&#39;t<br/>
have a concern, in which case I will be relieved and<br/>
pleasantly surprised.  But if it turns out otherwise,<br/>
I want to have some preparedness for that contingency.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If registering seems good, you might just need to go<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in another &gt;direction than pure radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Registering doesn&#39;t seem good, it seems intrusive and<br/>
big brotherish.  But registration is a legal<br/>
requirement, at least if I want to obey the law.  I<br/>
could not get anyone (WA homeschoolers, WA<br/>
unschoolers, FLO, school and state officals, and<br/>
others over the years) to discuss with me<br/>
pragmatically what the legal realities of not<br/>
registering would be, as in - what *could* they really<br/>
ever do to me if I didn&#39;t register and it came to<br/>
someone&#39;s attention later at some point?  Maybe I<br/>
should have put a lawyer on retainer just to get them<br/>
to answer that question realistically for me, but that<br/>
seemed a bit extreme.  Also since we&#39;re in such a very<br/>
rural area we can&#39;t just be invisible in the crowd,<br/>
trusting our anonymity to protect us.  Our school<br/>
district rep knows by name, face and family<br/>
associations who is homeschooling, so not registering<br/>
means we could never get involved in local activities<br/>
which might involve the school or be at the school or<br/>
that we&#39;d have to lie about being registered, and all<br/>
sorts of other sticky possibilities (the one k-12<br/>
school is a hub of local activity whether it&#39;s<br/>
officially school related or not at all.)  Everyone<br/>
knows everyone.  For example the local 4-H coordinator<br/>
for the entire county is a neighbor who also has<br/>
worked in the school district and has many connections<br/>
there still and is very pro schoolishness.  <br/>

they let it roll off their proverbial duck&#39;s back of<br/>
unschooling serenity.  I also want to thank all the<br/>

I know that people have written offlist to you to give you  <br/>
information, too.<br/>

month they sit down with their notes and fill out the required forms,  <br/>
or write up something in a format acceptable to their evaluator.<br/>

We were in a charter program for a few months and during that time I  <br/>

them and put them in a binder which sat out on a counter with a pen.  <br/>

up in the microwave or for a cup of tea to steep - I&#39;d just quickly  <br/>
glance at the page and it would remind me to write something down.  <br/>
The kids are doing something ALL the time - you can&#39;t keep records of  <br/>
all their learning. I&#39;d write: &quot;Talked about what kind of bird was on  <br/>
our patio,&quot; or &quot;Played new game - By Jove,&quot; or whatever I could  <br/>
remember that we&#39;d done that day. If it had been a few days since I&#39;d  <br/>
jotted down a note, I&#39;d think back whether there was anything  <br/>
especially  cool - like a visit to a museum or a walk in the woods -  <br/>
to write down.<br/>
<br/>
Once a month I&#39;d go find a quiet place for half an hour or an hour  <br/>
and translate the stuff I&#39;d written down into something to say under  <br/>
each subject area required to be covered.<br/>
<br/>
My understanding, though, Nanci, is that if you use FLO, you don&#39;t  <br/>
even have to meet with an evaluator - they just give you the forms.  <br/>
They consider you the expert and they take your word for whatever you  <br/>
put down.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be a person who takes things extremely literally and I  <br/>
think this is causing you to be a lot more concerned about all this  <br/>
than you need to be.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of taking this stuff so literally, others of us take it as a  <br/>
hoop to jump through by doing the minimum that will be accepted.<br/>
<br/>
ALL you need is to write up just enough that your evaluator will sign  <br/>
off on it. That makes you legal. No doctor is going to question that.<br/>
<br/>
So - I&#39;m asking directly. Do you have the forms from FLO? Do you know  <br/>
what THEY ask you to write down?<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t just talk to unschoolers across the country to find out how  <br/>
they handle their requirements, every state is too different. If you  <br/>
can&#39;t get the information you need from other Washington State  <br/>
unschoolers, you&#39;re not going to get it from someone from California  <br/>
or New Mexico or Illiniois or Massachusetts. When you ask questions  <br/>
on WA lists, and get lots of curriculum-related responses, you just  <br/>
need to ignore those that are irrelevant and sort through them to  <br/>
figure out what other unschoolers are doing. It doesn&#39;t hurt you to  <br/>
get the unhelpful responses as long as you&#39;re getting something else  <br/>
mixed in with it. There ARE other unschoolers in Washington so not  <br/>
everybody is doing curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to this page &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/</a> <br/>
WashingtonSupport.htm&gt;  you will find a list of a LOT of support  <br/>
groups in Washington. Some are specifically unschooling and quite a  <br/>
few are eclectic or inclusive. Even if you don&#39;t live in their area,  <br/>
you might email them and find out what they do to meet state  <br/>
requirements.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;That&#39;s your advice for maintaining unschooling purity<br/>
or serentiy or what have you in the face of this<br/>
obstacle?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Nanci - you&#39;re sort of doing some kind of &quot;Yes, but....&quot; thing. It  <br/>
feels like you are looking for there to be obstacles. Sandra&#39;s  <br/>
response was based on that - if it is going to be that hard and  <br/>
unworkable, maybe you should not do it. Better to do some simple  <br/>
curricular stuff than have a stressed out mom, I think, is the idea.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven&#39;t even tried to work with FLO, but are asking in advance  <br/>
of contacting them, then you are really overly anticipating  <br/>
difficulties. That is what they DO, they are there to do what you&#39;re  <br/>
asking people here to do - help you meet state requirements while not  <br/>
impinging on your daily lives.<br/>

You can&#39;t have two equal priorities.  One is more important than the  <br/>

We can&#39;t be everything to everyone.<br/>

Honestly, it HAS to be something the family can figure out and  <br/>

Nothing the rest of us can write can make unschooling work for  <br/>
another family.   It all has to be internal understanding and  <br/>
confidence on the part of the mom.  Saying &quot;I don&#39;t understand it,  <br/>

I hope you are right.  You most likely are.  I don&#39;t believe that I <br/>
am thinking I need to do more than I have to, I mean I even have <br/>
copies of the assessments of others as examples for what I need to <br/>
do.  I just can&#39;t perdict what other people will do once thrown into <br/>
that mix of our unschooling, and this will be the first year in <br/>
which we draw in an official assessor.  I recently had a not nice <br/>
run in with a local &quot;tutor who used to be a teacher&quot; who told me all <br/>
educators including homeschooling parents should be required to have <br/>
a masters degree in education and that it was &quot;assinine and criminal <br/>
that we (parents) were allowed to do our own assessments and if she <br/>
had anything to say about it....&quot; etc...<br/>
<br/>
Mostly though, I just wanted the practical advice about my being ZEN <br/>
about our unschooling while I have to do this secret schoolish crap <br/>
on the side for legal requirements.  I appreciate and am <br/>
assimilating what I&#39;ve been hearing on that topic.<br/>

to not let unavoidable schoolish stuff (whether it&#39;s grandma <br/>
quizzing Jr. or a child choosing to take a class of somet kind, or <br/>
state required stuff or whatever) affect your unschooling mindset, <br/>
how to let it roll off, tricks and tips for not letting that <br/>

anyone&#39;s mouth and forgive me if I am somehow remembering wrong) at <br/>
some time in the past on this list that if she had such requirements <br/>
it might be harder to stay in a purely unschooling mindset inside <br/>
herself.  Why is it wrong to ask for help, advice, experience of <br/>
others and so on, on that level?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Nanci - you&#39;re sort of doing some kind of &quot;Yes, but....&quot; thing. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because I didn&#39;t feel that I was getting answers to the questions I <br/>
was asking.  I was getting mainly answers to questions I wasn&#39;t <br/>
really asking.  That&#39;s probably my fault for not communicating <br/>
properly what I was trying to ask.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It feels like you are looking for there to be obstacles. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmmm...I&#39;ll think on that.  It doesn&#39;t feel that way to me.  Maybe <br/>
because I have run into so many obstacles already in my children&#39;s <br/>
lives I just expect that this new hurdle will come with obstacles <br/>
and I want to be prepared for them.  Maybe that&#39;s a wrong assumption <br/>
and I will be surprised at how easy and how much a non issue it <br/>
seems after the fact.  I certainly hope so.  That would be nice for <br/>
a change.  Me inability to get others to answer things over the <br/>
years, like for instance the possible repercussions of not <br/>
registering, has also made me more suspicious.<br/>
<br/>
I can see now that part of the problem for me is the unknown <br/>
quantity, not being able to predict what is coming.  This is causing <br/>
me a lot of stress.  There is also the element of interacting with <br/>
unknown people whom I cannot predict the responses of and who have <br/>
some power over my life that is upsetting and stressing me out.  I <br/>
see now that these are not things that any level of preparedness <br/>
will fix but just something I just need to deal with.<br/>

understand now what she was saying.  NO, I am not looking to do a <br/>
currcilum.  That would not make me feel better or happier or less <br/>
stressed or whatever.  Not being registered till this year was <br/>
better, but I didn&#39;t think it was possible in our situation to sail <br/>
under the radar anymore and I didn&#39;t want to have legal troubles.  <br/>
On the other hand, I have often heard that in some cases it is <br/>
better to ask for forgiveness than for permission and perhaps this <br/>
is one of those situations and I should not have let my resolve <br/>
waver enough to register but just kept sailing along happily <br/>
unschooling under the radar.  Too late now I think, unless we <br/>
move.  :-/<br/>
