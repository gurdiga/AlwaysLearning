<div id="ygrps-yiv-235712417">This came by e-mail from someone in my home town, someone younger  <br/>
than 50, and one interesting thing is that she&#39;s sitting at the  <br/>
computer cutting and pasting things she didn&#39;t even write and sending  <br/>
them out to her whole address book.<br/>
<br/>
How is that better than watching TV!?<br/>
But anyway, this is the propaganda of the day:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
=================================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Stranger<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A few years after I was born, my Dad met a stranger who was new to  <br/>
our small town.  From the beginning, Dad was fascinated with this  <br/>
enchanting newcomer and soon invited him to live with our family. The  <br/>
stranger was quickly accepted and was around from then on.  As I grew  <br/>
up, I never questioned his place in my family. In my young mind, he  <br/>
had a special niche. My parents were complementary instructors: Mom  <br/>
taught us good from evil, and Dad taught us to obey. But the  <br/>
stranger...he was our storyteller. He would keep us spellbound for  <br/>
hours on end with adventures, mysteries and comedies. If I wanted to  <br/>
know anything about politics, history or science, he always knew the  <br/>
answers about the past, understood the present and even seemed able  <br/>
to predict the future!  He took my family to the first major league  <br/>
ball game. He made us laugh, and he made us cry.  The stranger never  <br/>
stopped talking, but Dad didn&#39;t seem to mind.  Sometimes, Mom would  <br/>
get up quietly while the rest of us were shushing each other to  <br/>
listen to what he had to say,and she would go to the kitchen for  <br/>
peace and quiet.  I wonder now if she ever prayed for the stranger to  <br/>
leave.  Dad ruled our household with certain moral convictions, but  <br/>
the stranger never felt obligated to honor them. Profanity, for  <br/>
example, was not allowed in our home... Not from us, our friends or  <br/>
any visitors.  Our longtime visitor, however, got away with four- <br/>
letter words that burned my ears and made my dad squirm and my mother  <br/>
blush.  My Dad did permit the liberal use of alcohol. The stranger  <br/>
encouraged us to try it on a regular basis. He made cigarettes look  <br/>
cool,cigars manly and pipes distinguished.  He talked freely (much  <br/>
too freely!)about sex.  His comments were sometimes blatant,  <br/>
sometimes suggestive, and generally embarrassing.  I now know that my  <br/>
early concepts about relationships were influenced strongly by the  <br/>
stranger.  Time after time, he opposed the values of my parents, yet  <br/>
he was seldom rebuked... And NEVER asked to leave!!  More than fifty  <br/>
years have passed since the stranger moved in with our family.  He  <br/>
has blended right in and is not nearly as fascinating as he was at  <br/>
first.  Still, if you could walk into my parents&#39; house today, you  <br/>
would still find him sitting over in his corner, waiting for someone  <br/>
to listen to him talk and watch him draw his pictures. His  <br/>
name?..............<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
             We just call him, &quot;TV.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Note: This should be required reading for every household in America!<br/>
<br/>
=====================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps &quot;requirements&quot; of any sort are what makes TV so appealing.    <br/>
Again, none of my children is watching TV.  I&#39;m working through a DVD  <br/>
on my computer, but haven&#39;t had it on for two days.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The people who make the anti-TV sites think WAY more about TV than  <br/>
most people I know.<br/>
<br/>
I used to have a book (gave it to a DJ friend) detailing  <br/>
offensive/&quot;satanic&quot; lyrics in rock and roll songs.  Someone had spent  <br/>
hundreds of hours listening, transcribing, commenting, reviling...   <br/>
He could have just turned off the music!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1511750826">Well, there&#39;s hope for her.  This could have been me six or so months <br/>
ago, although I would&#39;ve only emailed it to people who agreed with me - <br/>
not because I&#39;m afraid to speak my mind, but I did realize it was a <br/>
personal choice.  I will admit though, I did think I was being a better <br/>
parent.  Now, I have to stop and laugh at myself for awhile...Okay, <br/>
done laughing.<br/>
<br/>
I have learned so much!  Thank you to everyone here.  <br/>
