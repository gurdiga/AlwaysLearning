<br/>
The fact that they&#39;re closing, and the fact that it&#39;s Learn Nothing  <br/>
Day creates a correlation.<br/>
Most research is based on correlation.<br/>
It seems you&#39;ve done research.<br/>
<br/>
We need more data points to &quot;prove&quot; that homeschooling-related  <br/>
businesses are starting to observe Learn Nothing Day, but this is a  <br/>
start.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
