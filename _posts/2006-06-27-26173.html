<div id="ygrps-yiv-1151088821">Entertainment Weekly which arrived yesterday announced an August 15  <br/>
DVD release of The Weird Al Show.  Anyone who doesn&#39;t know about  <br/>
Weird Al should just probably buy the CD Poodle Hat and that will be  <br/>
a good test of whether you&#39;d want more.  For those who have Poodle  <br/>
Hat and all the other music, and the movie, might care about this.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s cool is that the wrote a parody about Entertainment Weekly  <br/>
asking him to write a parody to go with the announcement.   It&#39;s  <br/>
called &quot;I will Comply&quot; and is to the tune of &quot;I will Survive.&quot; You  <br/>
have to sing it yourself; he didn&#39;t record it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here it is:<br/>
