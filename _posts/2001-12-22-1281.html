<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909662582">Dar, <br/>
Thank you for reminding me of a fabulous book!  Zen and The Art of Motorcycle <br/>
Maintanence was a life altering book for me. Certainly set me on the path of <br/>
adventure...he was such a COOL Dad!!<br/>
My dh recommended it to me when we were dating and loaned me his copy. I <br/>
think that&#39;s when I really fell for him.<br/>
Speaking of dh....he&#39;s been told (by perfect strangers) about four times in <br/>
the last month that he looks like Rick Springfield. I don&#39;t see it too much, <br/>
but it does wonders for his ego. He is a very good looking guy to moi, of <br/>
course. A total musician type. I love it when he has his &quot;winter&quot; look of <br/>
scruffy face and long hair. More typical is his business look though...short <br/>
hair and clean shaven....DARN IT!!<br/>
I liked the pretty boys when I had crushes. Luke, Scott Baio, Rick <br/>
Springfield definitely.<br/>
So what does that say about me?<br/>
yikes.<br/>
I love adventurous types in real life though, mountain climbing, skydiving <br/>
adventure seeking men.<br/>
Hey, Luke was adventurous...maybe there is a little insight there!!! haha<br/>

Your story parallels parts of mine. I was raised fairly conservative in many <br/>
ways. I&#39;ve always been fascinated with the whole homesteading thing. And I am <br/>
also a big Sandra fan!!!  <br/>
