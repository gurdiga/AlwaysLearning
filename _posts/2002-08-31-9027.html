&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have two kids that went through drivers ed in NM. Neither of them <br/>
&gt;took a single note! They passed the class and their tests, both <br/>
&gt;written and behind the wheel with no problem. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I made a bet with my son Jake, 16 at the time, that he could walk into <br/>
the driver&#39;s testing center and take the test and pass it without ever <br/>
having read the book.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew he was a good tester, like I was.  I knew he had been driven <br/>
around all his life and paid attention and learned a lot by osmosis, and <br/>
had common sense.  I was trying to teach him about unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
He passed.  Only missed about 3 questions.  <br/>
<br/>
His brother, 14 at the time, did the same thing about 3 months later. <br/>
 (In Arkansas you can get your learner&#39;s permit at 14.)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, now think about that.  I had to teach both of my teenage sons how <br/>
to drive during the same 6 month period.  = : O<br/>
<br/>
I learned that there is a physiological difference between the abilities <br/>
of 14 yo and a 16 yo drivers!  But I was comforted that my 14 yo had two <br/>
whole years to practice before he could drive alone.  Under the law at <br/>
the time, my 16 yo only got 6 months!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Today we were all at a friend&#39;s house for a couple<br/>
&gt; &gt; hours. My two daughters are seven and five, and their<br/>
&gt; &gt; friend is six.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; When it was time for us to leave, the friend&#39;s family<br/>
&gt; &gt; was getting ready to go run some errands, and her mom<br/>
&gt; &gt; asked her to tidy up her room a little (where all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; girls had been playing earlier.)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The friend asked my daughters if they would help her<br/>
&gt; &gt; tidy up. My seven year old said yes and went in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; room with her. My five year old simply said no and<br/>
&gt; &gt; continued playing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I didn&#39;t interfere.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; But I&#39;m wondering ... should I have done anything?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For example, tell her that she should help also, as<br/>
&gt; &gt; they were also using the stuff together? <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Should I have maybe said to her, &quot;Here, let&#39;s you and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I go help them together?&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Should I have told her it&#39;s not nice to go to someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; else&#39;s house and use their stuff, but then not help<br/>
&gt; &gt; put it away?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Or was it not a big deal that she didn&#39;t help?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks<br/>

You can&#39;t &quot;homeschool&quot; driver&#39;s ed, as far as I know, though there  <br/>
are some online schools that are legal in some places.<br/>
<br/>
My kids all went to drivers&#39; ed.  Some towns might not have it  <br/>
outside of school.  I took it in school myself, but Albuquerque has  <br/>
always depended on commercial schools (there are several here) and  <br/>
I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s not offered in school.  So in that case, my kids were  <br/>
just like all the other kids, only they really liked the classes!<br/>

In Ohio, people under 18 years old are required to have a driver&#39;s  education <br/>
course, over 18 they don&#39;t. At 18 you can just go in and take the  tests and <br/>
if you pass, you&#39;re licensed. I would call the licence bureau myself  and ask, <br/>
if it were me-they should know one way or the other if classes are  required <br/>

Yes.  But even at 18, insurance will be less for someone who had  <br/>
driver&#39;s ed.  My boys&#39; insurance will be high until they&#39;re 25, but  <br/>
it would be even more without driver&#39;s ed.<br/>

You can&#39;t totally stop it, but if you talk to them casually and  <br/>
calmly about why it concerns you, they can make a more informed  <br/>
decision.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s really bad, maybe you could tell your kids that if they&#39;re  <br/>
going to behave badly after guests leave, you might just want to stop  <br/>
having guests.<br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the way to go.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Texas  has recognized parent taught driver&#39;s ed which is utilized by<br/>
students of varying types of schools.  Teen drivers cannot be issued a<br/>
license (including getting a &quot;learners&#39; permit)  without taking both<br/>
classroom and behind the wheel training.  The state recognizes particular<br/>
commercial curriculum which can be taught by parents or one can buy a text<br/>
and instructors guide/notebook from the state.    The certificate  to be<br/>
filed with your auto insurance company for the discount (substantial even<br/>
for girls but for unmarried males under 25 even more) is issued by the state<br/>
and looks the same for all schools.  (Don&#39;t lose it, if you change insurance<br/>
companies the new one may wish to make another copy!  Maybe not in today&#39;s<br/>
world of easy info sharing.)<br/>
<br/>
I did a commercial program  (several hundred dollars even in 1994) with one<br/>
son and the $20 parent taught program with the other.  I had to buy an<br/>
approved student text but got that used and discounted from another<br/>
homeschooler.   Both got the same insurance discount until aging out.<br/>
Neither had to take the driving portion of the test at the DPS where a<br/>
trooper rides with the driver.    The school administrator;  whether the<br/>
school be a commercial entity, or taught through a government school, or<br/>
parent taught ; certifies that the student has &quot;passed&quot;  all areas of the<br/>
driving test.   My opinion is that provision is abused far less by parents<br/>
than by commercial schools.  I have heard of plenty of parents whose<br/>
decision was driven by the desire to &quot;know&quot; that their child was getting<br/>
lots of behind the wheel experience and was competent before being issued a<br/>
&quot;full&quot; license.<br/>
<br/>
Short version: Texas has a parent taught driver&#39;s ed; I thought other states<br/>
(Illinois? Oklahoma?) did also.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We always did this as well as simply not giving it a big response.  <br/>
When my oldest started name calling at first we responded all <br/>
apalled, &quot;don&#39;t do that, it hurts people&#39;s feelings, its nice&quot; etc.  <br/>
So, as the typical child scientist, he amped it up: what does it look <br/>
like when you hurt someone&#39;s feelings?!  How far can you go with the <br/>
name calling before something happens?!<br/>
<br/>
So we abandoned the reasonable conversation and just joined in, but <br/>
with more made up silly names.  He would call DH or I a &quot;stupid butt <br/>
head&quot; and we would respond with something like: &quot;oh yeah, well you <br/>
are a green brocoli head&quot;  and then he would say something like &quot;NO --<br/>
 you are a rat nose person&quot; -- and then it would get really crazy as <br/>
we all tried to come up with wilder combinations.  (Captain <br/>
Underpants book about Professor Poopypants is a very funny spin on <br/>
the crazy names game.)<br/>
<br/>
We also informed him of how there is kind of a time and a place for <br/>
everything.  But in the end, I think that kids often have to learn <br/>
the hard way that calling names doesn&#39;t go over well with friends or <br/>
siblings -- ie they called someone a name, the person cried, said <br/>
they didn&#39;t want to be their friend anymore; or they were called a <br/>
name, it made them cry, and then they had a chance to understand it <br/>
from an inside perspective.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve mediated a lot of name calling arguments, it seems like it is a <br/>
part of every child&#39;s journey.  And I always try to remember that <br/>
even as an adult there are times that _I_ want to call someone a <br/>
name, at some point along the way I learned how to hold my tongue and <br/>
I am sure that my children will too. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The original poster asked about unacceptable behaviour -- was it just <br/>
name calling or was there a *bad* words element to the question?  <br/>
<br/>
And the kicking?  Is someone getting hurt or is it just pretending?  <br/>
I mean, in general, we try to use a *people need to feel safe in our <br/>
home* guiding principle -- but if the kids are play fighting, it is <br/>
just what it is, playing (and someone may get hurt but there was no <br/>
intention to cause injury).  But if they are using kicking to hurt <br/>
someone they are mad at I just try to help them find a less injurious <br/>
way to solve the problem.  This is another time when I try to really <br/>
sink into my memories of being a child -- remembering how it felt to <br/>
be so mad or frustrated that I *had* to lash out, that feeling of <br/>
energy charging down my arm, knowing that I wasn&#39;t going to solve the <br/>
problem but not caring because in the moment I was my emotions.  This <br/>
allows me to empathize with both parties in a *fight* -- I don&#39;t want <br/>
anyone to get hurt, and I understand how hard it is in the moment to <br/>
keep it together enough to &quot;use your words.&quot;  Being available before <br/>
that moment occurs is good, key really -- guess that is all part of <br/>
being present -- when I feel the tension rising I can casually ask if <br/>
there is anything I can help with and that alone can go a long way to <br/>
averting the use of physical force.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, it really helps to think of it in other terms than simply<br/>
&quot;unacceptable&quot;.  &quot;Bad&quot; words, wether you use them or not, have been very<br/>
accepted in our culture wether we pretend that isn&#39;t so or not.  All<br/>
kinds of words, the good ones and the bad ones, have intent and meaning.<br/>
It has worked better for me to view them within that context rather<br/>
than, good/bad.<br/>
<br/>
I have a teen and a 6 yr old.  My 6 yr old is going to be exposed to big<br/>
kid things, that my oldest wasn&#39;t when she was 6.  There is little I can<br/>
do about that!  I think it&#39;s natural to explore all those cuss words, I<br/>
mean people use them all the time, it&#39;s part of our venacular, they are<br/>
in movies, and used in public spaces.<br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;ve done with our kids, if give them examples of when those words<br/>
really aren&#39;t acceptable.  Name calling, is mean, wether you call<br/>
someone &quot;stupid&quot; or &quot;**ithead&quot;, both of them hurt equally bad.  Our kids<br/>
understand the distinction of stubbing ones toe and hollering out<br/>
explatives and name calling, or name calling in fun or to be mean. <br/>
There are many subtle nuances to it, that some kids won&#39;t get unless an<br/>
adult helps them to use the language appropriately.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly hitting and name calling isn&#39;t nice, address that, not wether or<br/>
not the word would turn a PG film into a PG-13 or R.  If a parent is<br/>
shocked by bad words, and the kids are finding that fun, it really says<br/>
more about the parents than the kids.</div>

We do the same thing. At this point, namecalling is actually an invitation<br/>
to play word games, and it&#39;s delivered in that teasing kind of &quot;let&#39;s play!&quot;<br/>
kind of way, with no malice whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
We have no problems with the boys cussing... provided there&#39;s correct<br/>
context (not just profanity for profanity&#39;s sake), but we also suggest<br/>
stretching into more creative terms of opprobrium, which has led both to<br/>
some awesome vocabulary discussions, and also opened their eyes to how<br/>
people perceive you, and react to you, depending on your choice of<br/>
vocabulary. Words have power, and they&#39;ve figured that out. But it all<br/>
started with PoopyPantsHead. =)<br/>

No, Illinois law requires drivers ed for under 18&#39;s taught either by a public <br/>
high school or a commercial school. The high schools have to let private/home <br/>
schooled kids in but only when they have room so lots of kids take them over <br/>
the summer. In Illinois the issue for homeschoolers is getting their insurance <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>we do this too! I totally agree with the idea to let go of the<br/>
heaviness of a word or action and try to turn it around into playful<br/>
exploration...<br/>
<br/>
My ds6 Leo who just turned 5 in may has so many olders he has had so<br/>
many words and actions to try out that with my olders (when they were<br/>
young) just never came up...<br/>
<br/>
my favorite is when he started to experiement with spitting on people<br/>
to show his disfavor...we had to really search for the source as no<br/>
one here has ever used spitting except to clear their mucus from the<br/>
throat :oP. <br/>
<br/>
Turns out the little indian girl that spits on Captain Hook in Peter<br/>
pan  was his inspiration!  <br/>
<br/>
we started responding with &quot;oh its raining! Im getting my umbrella.&quot; <br/>
or I would grab him up with &quot;is this the slobber kiss? let me try!&quot;<br/>
and we would start to do really wet and spitty kisses till we were<br/>
laughing and icked by the slobber lol...I still laugh to remember, it<br/>
was such a beautiful way to connect. and after he was relaxed enough<br/>
to talk about what was really bothering him, and because the energy<br/>
had changed he would be really easy flowing with solutions.<br/>
<br/>
with hitting i would do the same sort of thing (because leo was also a<br/>
hitter) - id over react in play my pain, id roll about in agony...<br/>
(if it was me)<br/>
<br/>
then I d figure out what was going on.<br/>
<br/>
of course we  talk about these things outside of the situation, but<br/>
within the situation it is so very challenging at first to switch<br/>
gears and ive found to keep it light (with small children) the nicest way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064764789">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing your views.  When I talked with my elder son (10 yo), how he felt when someone suddenly called him in diff words & hitting him suddenly.  He said that he could understand how hard the parents feel when they were doing such things... Also said, he wants to take out those hard feelings on others (till completely he forgot the whole episode)...  We showed him some ways on how to &quot;take out&quot; the fire from him... This phase goes on and on for long time.<br/>
<br/>
While my elder son talks freely with us after such episodes, its hard for our younger one to forget or stop such behaviour.<br/>
<br/>
ok, i need to wait for this phase to go off...<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>

I would discuss with them why it is you do not want them to use certain<br/>
