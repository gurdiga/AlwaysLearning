&lt;&lt;&lt;What kinds of things do you see as disruptions, or do you  wish weren&#39;t <br/>
on the list?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Local stuff that&#39;s not labeled clearly in the subject line or  under the <br/>
subject line of another post is kind of bothersome. It&#39;s pretty easy  to just <br/>
delete stuff that&#39;s labeled clearly that I know I don&#39;t want to read,  but <br/>
when I&#39;m in the midst of going through a discussion under a certain subject  <br/>
heading, one of those is like hitting a speed bump in the middle of a <br/>
regular  road at 45 mph.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks, too, to everyone who continues to post and answer  here, despite <br/>
all the repetitious questions-I really appreciate the time you  take out to <br/>
help folks refine their unschooling and parenting. Thank  you  for all your <br/>
help!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
