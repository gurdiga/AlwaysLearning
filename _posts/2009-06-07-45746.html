<div id="ygrps-yiv-370557188">David Mitchell is a British comedian who has a column in The Observer. He is really good at ranting in the most wonderfully ascerbic way. I enjoyed his rant on television this week: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpeqPdVyQd0.">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpeqPdVyQd0.</a> It isn&#39;t an unschooling perspective, but he does talk about the guilt he felt at not experiencing childhood as intensely as he was exhorting to do. <br/>
<br/>
I thought others might enjoy it as well. <br/>
