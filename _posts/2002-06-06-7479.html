<div id="ygrps-yiv-924558092">My 10 year old who plays both a game cube and a playstation 2 suggests the<br/>
Playstation 2.  He says the likes the Playstation controller better than the<br/>
Game Cube and there are more games available on the Playstation. And the are<br/>
a lot of fun games for the Playstation.  One of his favorite games for<br/>
Playstation is SSX Tricky a snow boarding game.<br/>
My 11 year old also says Playstation2 because there are a lot of fun games<br/>
for the Playstation.  His favorite game at the moment is Tekkon Tag<br/>
tournament which is a fighting game so not sure how you feel about those.<br/>
My 10 year old said the most important things to look for are good graphics,<br/>
how smooth the game plays, the number of good games available and the size<br/>
of the controllers.<br/>
<br/>
He says to definitely not get the X-box (perhaps cos he doesn&#39;t have one) as<br/>
there controller is too big and there aren&#39;t so many good games available.<br/>
My 11 year old says the console is too big.<br/>
The Playstation 2 can also be used as a DVD player which is handy sometimes.<br/>
If you want the opinion of an adult my husband also plays these games for<br/>
hours and I can ask him when he comes home.<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>
