&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve just spent 20 mins shouting at my kids and I feel terrible. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Bad moment.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, the best thing I learned from another AOL homeschooling mom was <br/>
never curse a whole day &quot;bad day,&quot; just think &quot;I had a bad moment; the rest <br/>
will be better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; He cited all the homeschoolers we know who&#39;s <br/>
kids can&#39;t read by 8 or so, said I was ruining my children&#39;s life <br/>
through sticking to a philosophy that was &#39;unproven&#39; (he&#39;s a <br/>
scientist, can you tell?)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tell him to read the article by Carol Rice in the library at <br/>
www.unschooling.com.  I have known these kids since they were babies, and I <br/>
know them still--the three youngest are over here every week or two, <br/>
especially Renee (the older twin).<br/>
<br/>
Tell him only one of my kids was reading before nine, but the two older ones <br/>
are plenty fluent AND they know they can learn something as hard as reading <br/>
just because they want to.  They are NOT &quot;teacher-trained&quot; in any sense.  <br/>
They are not, as your husband is, convinced that they cannot learn without a <br/>
teacher.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Then he cited all the other homeschoolers who score in national <br/>
tests, who are building rockets by the time they are 6,&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Two of the three spelling bee champions were unschoolers, I read somewhere, <br/>
and now I&#39;ve heard that homeschoolers won&#39;t be eligible for the national <br/>
spelling bee.<br/>
<br/>
Read the test questions and put down the answer they say.  If you don&#39;t like <br/>
the answer they say, hesitate about putting the mark down, and that will be <br/>
their clue to choose another question.  It&#39;s subtle.  It&#39;s real.  Testing <br/>
should have a purpose, and these tests are more punitive than anything else.  <br/>
In the case of schools, the composite scores are used to snub other schools, <br/>
or to get federal funding.  In the case of individual scores, they&#39;re used to <br/>
put kids in special ed or gifted classes, to get federal funds.  <br/>
<br/>
Nobody&#39;s going to give you any federal funds.<br/>
<br/>
Just get the test answer sheets sent in and forget it.  God doesn&#39;t care <br/>
whose hand was on the pencil.<br/>

***<br/>
(7) they must not have eschewed normal school activity in favor of<br/>
preparation for spelling bees;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;snip&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
With regard to requirement (7), normal school activity shall be defined as<br/>
adherence to the full school schedule and varied academic course load<br/>
maintained by a majority of the speller&#39;s age-mates and grade-mates.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
The site has new rules marked in red; this is not new.  I would imagine<br/>
*un*schoolers would not qualify, and most homeschoolers using a curriculum<br/>
wouldn&#39;t, either, since you wouldn&#39;t have anything like a full school<br/>
time-wasting schedule.<br/>
