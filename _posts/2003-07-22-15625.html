<div id="ygrps-yiv-763978833">My snarky thought was &quot;spank the cats and that&#39;ll teach them not to run in<br/>
the street.&quot;<br/>

Okay, this made me think of Mr Popper&#39;s Penguins which a friend has just<br/>
lent us. The back cover says it&#39;s a classic of American humour. I&#39;d never<br/>
heard of it but that&#39;s not suprising  given where I live.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Maybe we can train him,&quot; said Mrs. Popper. &quot;Bad, naughty Captain,&quot; she said<br/>
to the penguin in a loud voice. &quot;Bad to eat the goldfish.&quot; And she spanked<br/>
him on his round, black head.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t read to see if he ate anymore goldfish. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
