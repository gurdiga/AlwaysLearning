<div id="ygrps-yiv-1610923731"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Today the pro-life ladies are marching&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I never understood this action. If they don&#39;t like abortions, they <br/>
don&#39;t have to get one. <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want one for my dw or for either of my dd. I would try to <br/>
support them in whatever decision they made though.  But then, if one <br/>
of my daughters turned out like Madonna, I would love them and I <br/>
think many parents might not.<br/>
<br/>
Abortions were &quot;outlawed&quot; by a Roman Catholic clergy in an attempt to <br/>
increase the number of members, I heard. So every anti-abortionist <br/>
who protests against others&#39; abortions is behaving as a Roman.<br/>
<br/>
What if there were anti-homeschoolers who protested against parents <br/>
who kept their kids at home for religious reasons?  Live and let <br/>
live, or suffer the consequences because what goes around comes <br/>
around.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t going to get into this one, but I have to respond to this. It&#39;s<br/>
just the stupidest argument, IMO. Would you tell someone &quot;If you don&#39;t<br/>
like child abuse, don&#39;t abuse your child?&quot; or &quot;If you don&#39;t like murders,<br/>
don&#39;t murder anyone&quot;? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If some clinic were euthanizing 2 year olds just because the mother asked it<br/>
to be done, would you try to stop it?<br/>
<br/>
From the point of view that life begins at conception, the two are<br/>
equivalent.<br/>
