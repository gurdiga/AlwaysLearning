&gt; How does Santa fit in with unschooling?<br/>
&gt; How many here have kids who believe in Santa?<br/>
&gt; What age, if any, should this belief stop?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids do believe in Santa. They are 8 & 10.<br/>
&gt; I am beginning to squirm.<br/>
&gt; I would love to hear how other&#39;s have handled this, and still managed to <br/>
&gt; maintain some dignity for their kids.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m beginning to wonder if we have handled this the wrong way.<br/>
&gt; My thinking has changed a lot since we&#39;ve started unschooling, including my <br/>
&gt; thoughts about Santa.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is my son&#39;s first year officially not believing in Santa. He&#39;s 12.<br/>
<br/>
Julian is a kid who has entered puberty relatively early for a boy, but is <br/>
kind of young for his age in some ways. (In conversation with adults he comes <br/>
off as VERY mature, but he is really into being a kid, and is not into common <br/>
middle-school-age things.)  Certainly Julin has had clues all over the place <br/>
that Santa might not be real, and he chose not to see them.  I think <br/>
continuing to believe in Santa was his way of staying a little kid that much <br/>
longer.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s done with it, and it feels right.  He wasn&#39;t upset or anything, because <br/>
he was ready to let it go. He still wants to leave cookies and carrots out-- <br/>
Just cuz. <br/>

<br/>
At 33, I believe that the animals/toys(real or plush) CAN talk at midnight<br/>
on christmas eve.   That my pets can understand and have a special language<br/>
only other animals can understand, including those in the forest.<br/>
<br/>
Who knows, maybe it was because I was WAAAAYY into Benji movies.  To this<br/>
day, I can&#39;t watch a talking animal movie without busting into tears at some<br/>
point (ie: Homeward Bound, Milo and Otis, etc.)  Ask my girls, I am famous<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626759653">&lt;&lt; I know people who say boys &quot;mature&quot; slowly. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think those who mature slowly mature best.<br/>
<br/>
For some reason I&#39;ve always been interested in boy-psychology, maybe because <br/>
I never had brothers, and because boys tended to confide in me early on--I <br/>
remember as early as when I was 13 being a counsellor for male friends in <br/>
their family and relationship problems and a philosophical sparring partner <br/>
with lots of them.  I was fascinated by their difference from girls.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;ve kept in contact with lots of those boys, over the years.  And I went <br/>
to my 30th high school reunion recently and saw a several I hadn&#39;t seen since <br/>
then.<br/>
<br/>
It all just confirmed my idea that those who zip toward maturity miss some of <br/>
the steps or learning or development or SOMEthing that they could have used <br/>
to be the strongest, calmest kinds of dads and husbands and centered adults.  <br/>
Truly, some of the most stunning examples of maturity and reliability are <br/>
those who were goofy at 17, and clueless at 19, while some of those around <br/>
them had reached their plateau already at 15 and were ACTING grown, and BEING <br/>
mature in a more surface way.  I don&#39;t know how much involves genetic package <br/>
and how much is the possibility that by self-induced maturity (i.e. deciding <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m grown now&quot;) one can turn off the process.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1918192627">Thanks to all of you responding about Santa. I love reading all your opinions and personal feelings regarding kids and believing.<br/>
One of the reasons I&#39;m getting a little uneasy is because as the boys get older, their list gets more elaborate and expensive!<br/>
Here is an example of my kids Christmas list word for word:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Santa,<br/>
Here is my Christmas list:<br/>
<br/>
40 gb hardrive<br/>
2 sticks 256 mg of ram<br/>
Computer Case with motherboard with pentium 1 ghz processor<br/>
CD burner<br/>
a 5 1/4&quot; & 3 1/2&quot; built in floppy drive<br/>
a 3D graphics card with 10 mega bytes<br/>
10 packs of Harry Potter cards<br/>
a camera<br/>
a mini-video camera<br/>
razor scooter<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is my 8yo list. <br/>
I told them that was a very tall order for Santa and ds would be lucky to get one or two items on his list.<br/>
This is getting out of hand! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
From a website on The Feast of the Nativity:<br/>
<br/>
No record is found as to the date when the Nativity Feast of our Lord began<br/>
to be celebrated as a separate feast. It is known, however, that in the<br/>
early Christian Church the Birth of Christ, Adoration of the Magi and<br/>
Theophany [western Epiphany] were celebrated on the same day, January 6. The<br/>
date of introduction of the Nativity Feast into the Church calendar was<br/>
different in all 5 Patriarchates (Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria,<br/>
Constantinople and Rome). The Church of Jerusalem was the last one to adopt<br/>
this feast in the 6th century.<br/>
<br/>
December the 25th, was the date of a pagan festival in Rome, originated in<br/>
274 by the emperor Aurelian, as the birthday of the &quot;unconquered sun&quot;<br/>
(natalis solis invicti). Sometime before 336, the Church of Rome established<br/>
a commemorative festival of the birth of Christ, the Son of Righteousness.<br/>
The first evidence of the Nativity celebration in the East, as a separate<br/>
feast, comes from Constantinople.<br/>
<br/>
In 381, Gregory the Theologian delivered his 39th sermon on the feast of<br/>
Theophany and called it the festival of lights, commemorating the Baptism of<br/>
Christ, the true light. He speaks of the Nativity as recently past and<br/>
reminds his audience that in the Nativity Feast they followed the star,<br/>
worshipped with the Magi, were bathed in light with shepherds, glorified God<br/>
with angels, took Christ in their arms with Simeon and confessed Him with<br/>
Anna. He continues: &quot;Now, however, at Theophany, this is another event and<br/>
another mystery, the Baptism.¹<br/>
<br/>
On December 20, 386, in his sermon on the martyr Philogonius, St. John<br/>
Chrysostom looks forward to the Nativity Feast as the Birthday of Christ and<br/>
the festival from which all the other come. He also mentions the visit of<br/>
the Magi as commemorated on the Nativity day. And then, five days later, in<br/>
his sermon delivered on the Feast of the Nativity, Chrysostom says that this<br/>
feast has been known to Antiochenes for less than 10 years, although it has<br/>
been known longer in the West.<br/>
<br/>
It is also known that the separation of the Nativity and the Baptism into<br/>
two different holy days occurred in Egypt (Patriarchate of Alexandria) in<br/>
the second half of the 5th century, shortly before the false teacher Arius<br/>
died.  <br/>
***<br/>
[me again]<br/>
<br/>
The early church didn&#39;t consider the whens and wheres of Christ&#39;s birth<br/>
important, although the New Testament church included the Virgin Mary among<br/>
its members; she knew when and where she gave birth, and probably passed on<br/>
the information.  That&#39;s why there&#39;s a church in a cave near Bethlehem.<br/>
Tradition holds that Luke, who records the event Linus recites in &quot;A Charlie<br/>
Brown Christmas,&quot; spent time with Mary, essentially interviewing her for his<br/>
gospel.  (Not being a disciple, he got his info. second hand.)  Caesar<br/>
Augustus would have had anarchy on his hands if he&#39;d demanded the entire<br/>
populace travel to their home towns in *December*; it had to have been<br/>
spring.  The lambs wouldn&#39;t have been born yet, and no sheep would have been<br/>
out on the hills at night.  (I think, though, that if you&#39;re going to<br/>
believe in a virgin birth, you might as well believe in angels, too.)<br/>
<br/>
The date for the feast WAS chosen to coincide with winter solstice, and yes,<br/>
there was a Roman holiday for the sun on that day.  If you&#39;ve seen<br/>
&quot;Gladiator,&quot; which takes place around 192, you&#39;ll get a good idea of what<br/>
Roman pagan festivals were like - it was Constantine who outlawed the<br/>
gladiatorial contests as barbaric, inhuman rituals.   The church did choose<br/>
the same day, since the newly Christian populace needed something more<br/>
civilized to do,  and created a feast to replace it.   The hymnography<br/>
emphasizes the &quot;Sun/Son of Righteousness,&quot; not the little baby away in a<br/>
manger.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your Nativity O Christ our God<br/>
Has shone to the world the light of wisdom<br/>
For by it those who worshipped the stars<br/>
Were taught by a star to adore you,<br/>
The Sun of Righteousness,<br/>
And to know you, the Orient from on High.<br/>
O Lord, glory to you!&quot;<br/>
(Orthodox troparion for the Nativity)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think you&#39;re right.  Your 15 year old steps out of one world and into<br/>
another.  To my nine year old it&#39;s just the one world where anything is<br/>
still possible.  <br/>
I like that.  I wish I could do it.<br/>
Haven&#39;t tried in awhile, I guess.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-828945992">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I told them that was a very tall order for Santa<br/>
and ds would be lucky <br/>
to get one or two items on his list.<br/>
This is getting out of hand! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Karin &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tamzin makes a list and gets one or two presents from<br/>
Santa (depending on the size and/or cost) from the<br/>
list. In our house she makes a list to give people<br/>
ideas for what she would like, not something to be<br/>
followed slavishly. Santa gets the same list that we<br/>
email to Granny and Grandpa. That way if the store is<br/>
all out of something (Baby Boo doll this year!) it&#39;s<br/>
not the end of the world on Christmas morning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-757772010"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;....due to the placement of the stars(comet with a<br/>
&gt;tail) and why the shepherds would be out in the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>fields&gt;(lambing), they came up with April, 5 B.C..  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;They also speculated that the Angels that told the<br/>
&gt;shepherds of the birth were actually family members<br/>
&gt;that came out into the fields to tell the kin <br/>
&gt;folk that mom and baby were doing fine.  The word for<br/>
&gt;messenger was Anglo (or something like that).  The 3<br/>
&gt;wise guys(as Dana calls them) were thought <br/>
&gt;to come from Babylon - they were magi, not<br/>
&gt;necessarily kings.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;Emperor Constantine picked Dec 25th so that it would<br/>
&gt;replace a pagan holiday.<br/>
&gt;Karen M.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>More accurately, Midwinter was picked to coincide the<br/>
birth of Christ with the brith of MANY, MANY gods<br/>
celebrated at the Midwinter Solstice throughout<br/>
history and many cultures.  Persian Mithras is one<br/>
example.<br/>
<br/>
St.Chrysostom, Archbishop of Constantinople said in<br/>
373, 100 years after the birth of Christ had been<br/>
fixed at Midwinter, the the Nativity of the &quot;Sun of<br/>
Righteousness&quot; had been fixed there so that &quot;while the<br/>
heathen were busied with their profane rights, the<br/>
Christians might perform their holy ones without<br/>
disturbance.&quot;  This sentiment stemming from the days<br/>
when Christians were the persecuted minority.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s me, heathen all the way, since heathen<br/>
originally meant the people of the heath, or the<br/>
people who live on the heath, referring to the Irish<br/>
by the Romans, and that is my line of descent.<br/>
