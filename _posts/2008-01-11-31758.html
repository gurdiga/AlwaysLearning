<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408438698">Greetings,<br/>
  I&#39;m part of a growing community with a focus on relationship (with <br/>
self, one another and our relations in the natural world) called the <br/>
Teaching Drum Outdoor School.  We are also home to a growing <br/>
children&#39;s culture and are passionate about providing the best <br/>
possible environment whereby children can discover themselves and in <br/>
the process share with us their gifts so vital to our own journeys <br/>
of self-discovery.  To this end we are seeking more children and <br/>
parents who would live to explore living as part of our circle and a <br/>
webpage <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.html">http://www.teachingdrum.org/childrensculture.html</a> <br/>
chronicling our vision of relationship (with children and <br/>
otherwise.)  As of now the page is still being woven together and is <br/>
crafted together with stories, pictures and quotes of our lives <br/>
here, with more to come.  To find out more about the school or to <br/>
schedule a visit e-mail <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:balance@...">balance@...</a>.<br/>
In gratitude for your own journeys,<br/>
-Marcus<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Let us put our heads together and see what life we will make for <br/>
our children.&quot;- Tatanka lotanka (Sitting Bull)</div>

To Marcus, can you explain more what you mean by &quot;a growing  <br/>
children&#39;s culture&quot;?<br/>

  I appreciate your being open to hosting my intro here.  I&#39;m <br/>
canvassing a lot of unschooling/natural parenting forums in an <br/>
attempt to get the word out about Teaching Drum.<br/>
  By &quot;children&#39;s culture&quot; I mean a group of children with their own <br/>
culture.  This happens wherever there are groups of children - they <br/>
have their own games, language, conflict-resolution techniques, ect.  <br/>
We are intentionally trying to foster this, and the difference <br/>
between saying &quot;we just want more kids&quot; is that we know it&#39;s what <br/>
our children need.  In school and in sports they are clustered into <br/>
peer groups where they learn they need to compete for <br/>
attention/acceptance.  But humans weren&#39;t evolved to learn this way.  <br/>
In the small clans where we evolved our natural learning styles <br/>
children would spend their days with those older and younger than <br/>
them, following in the example of the older and providing a bridge <br/>
for the younger.  <br/>
  Right now our school community (by the way - the &quot;school&quot; is quite <br/>
unique, I might call it the most radical facilitated-unschooling <br/>
experience for adults that exists on this planet) is home to 3 <br/>
children.  Already in their day-to-day play I can see how much more <br/>
tuned in to each other they are (the 5 year old wants to learn much <br/>
more from the 6 year old than from any of the adults).  Right now <br/>
there are big gaps 2years-&gt;5 years-&gt;6 years-&gt;21 years.  Filling in <br/>
those gaps is key for the children&#39;s own fulfillment (having someone <br/>
to guide and put their new learning to practice, and having guides <br/>
of their own) and for the maturation of the community (for our <br/>
future and because relationship with children brings us so much of <br/>
our own learning and example).<br/>
  The website I&#39;ve created goes into these concepts more, I <br/>
encourage anyone curious to check it out <br/>
