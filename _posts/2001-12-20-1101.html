<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260519248">pam,  here&#39;s what the  catholic catechism Catechism  says:<br/>
    The Eucharistic prescence of Christ begins at the moment of the<br/>
consecration and endures as long as the Eucharistic species  persist.<br/>
Christ is present whole and entire in each of the species and in each of<br/>
their parts,  in such a way that the breaking of the bread does not divide<br/>
Christ.<br/>
<br/>
me:  the consecration occurs during the eucharistic prayer.  When I was a<br/>
child,  a server jingled some bells after the words of consecration were<br/>
spoken.  During the prayer,  Jesus last supper is remembered and the priest<br/>
uses the words, &quot;This is my body &quot; and  &quot;This is my blood.&quot; - this is WHEN.<br/>
<br/>
At the council of Trent,  it was the chusrch theologians agreed that the in<br/>
the sacrament of the Eucharist, &quot; the body and blood, together with the soul<br/>
and divinity, of our Lord Jesus Christ and, therefore,  the whole of Christ<br/>
is truly, really,  and substantially contained.&quot;  &quot;This presence is also<br/>
called &#39;real&#39; - by which it is not intended to exclude the other types of<br/>
presence as if they could not be &#39;real&#39; too,  but because it is presence in<br/>
the fullest sense.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As to HOW it is changed (in case you&#39;re wondering :-) ),  St John Chrysostom<br/>
declares:<br/>
    It is not man that cause the things offered to become the Body and Blood<br/>
of Christ,  but he who was crucified for us,  Christ himself.  The priest,<br/>
in the role of Christ, pronounce these words, but their power and grace are<br/>
God&#39;s.  This is my body, he says.  This word transforms the things offered.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; Catholic theology does teach in transubstantiation (i.e., during Mass<br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt; actually the bread and wine actually become the blood and body of<br/>
Christ).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve always wondered exactly WHEN does this switch happen? I mean - if<br/>
&gt; someone stopped just short of swallowing the bread and wine, would it then<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; blood and flesh? Or does it change after it is swallowed? Or ??<br/>

Sorry, a little catholic humor moment.  By the by, I am gleaning more from<br/>
this thread than I ever had in all my years of catechism.  When I used to<br/>
asked questions my father and others regarding stuff like this I got the old<br/>
standby, &quot;because of faith and we believe it is happening&quot;.  I always<br/>
considered it to be a little catholic magic.<br/>

little boy. Magic. (And, of course, tragic at the same time.) My husband and <br/>
I find ourselves using phrases from that book all the time. &quot;Ahhh, he&#39;s got <br/>
Protestant hair.&quot;<br/>
