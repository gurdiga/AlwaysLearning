<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279272741">Ron(my dh) is always complaining about Lukas&#39; toys lying around. BUT,<br/>
there is NO space here!! He says he has too many but if he had a<br/>
normal room they wouldn&#39;t take up but a corner in it!<br/>
When I clean up Ron likes it but ya know it doesn&#39;t last. I am always<br/>
trying to think of solutions but come up emptyhanded.(619&#39; house) I<br/>
would like to have a big playroom outside,maybe a tent for his toys.<br/>
That would be good for the fall and winter. Maybe,too hot in the summer.<br/>
I feel Ron is also hating on Lukas a lot. For example, when he tells<br/>
Lukas to do something and he doesn&#39;t listen or&quot;obey&quot; him. Ron says he<br/>
needs a whipping.<br/>
No matter how it made him feel growing up with whippings or the info I<br/>
have provided about it. Lukas never has one and will not as long as<br/>
I&#39;m here.I tell Ron that when I want to get Lukas in I say: Hey,<br/>
Sweetheart,let&#39;s go in so I can eat or whatever and we can go back out<br/>
in awhile okay? Lukas mostly agrees and comes with me. Ron barks<br/>
orders at him then gets mad because he doesn&#39;t listen! Ron wants Lukas<br/>
to understand he is the authority figure. I tell him when I respect<br/>
Lukas he does me. But Ron won&#39;t try it...argh!! What to do????<br/>
sorry,if my problems seem redudant. Dh also says Lukas shouldn&#39;t be<br/>
eating sugar,it makes him hyper. Lukas is always in his way or will<br/>
not listen. Lukas is 6yo.<br/>
I want to add that we don&#39;t have &quot;normal bedrooms,you walk from the<br/>
living room into Lukas and my bedroom and you have to go thru that to<br/>
get to the kitchen/bathroom. there is a small bedroom that Ron sleeps in.<br/>
We can not sell yet. The home is owner finiaced,in little more then<br/>
two years we have it paid off. I did cross post this.</div>
