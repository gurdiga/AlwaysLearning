<div id="ygrps-yiv-1715696975">The following video is an excellent example that children neither need to be capable of reading nor indeed be proficient with a language to learn. It&#39;s approx. 20 mins long.<br/>

<br/>
for the project(Hole in the Wall) to work, the single most important factor was to keep adults from &#39;butting in&#39; this was done through a physical barrier which made the PC comfortable for children and uncomfortable for adults.<br/>
<br/>
For me, this is an example of stewing-in-action.<br/>
<br/>
Importantly, the children in the urban slums and in the rural areas were not left to work out for themselves how they would get a computer. The Computer was left &#39;lying around&#39; and from there the children were able to discover what they wanted to do with it. The children were also looked in on, to see how they were going, but without any expected outcomes being looked for.<br/>
