<div id="ygrps-yiv-719148729">I would like some discussion about how much prompting you think is<br/>
necessary with children. I&#39;m having an internal argument about it and<br/>
I would like to talk with others who have probably already been<br/>
through the same thing. Anyhow I have a 9yo who we have been life<br/>
learning with for about 4 years now, most of the time things are great<br/>
and I think we&#39;re both doing well. We talk and share as much as<br/>
possible in the time we have. I work part-time but my dh is thankfully<br/>
on board with unschooling and they spend more time together when I&#39;m<br/>
at work. <br/>
<br/>
    What I have problems with is how much of the reminding or<br/>
prompting should I be doing with him. For example after dinner I see<br/>
him walking straight to the computer and I may prompt with something<br/>
like &quot;you might want to wash your hands to keep any grease (or ketchup<br/>
usually) from getting the keyboard icky&quot;, or if I see that he&#39;s tired<br/>
and getting ready for bed I say something like &quot;do you want me to put<br/>
toothpaste on your toothbrush so it will be ready for you?&quot; as a<br/>
reminder to brush his teeth. I try not to remind about the teeth every<br/>
day, I&#39;m hoping sometime he will take over and remember himself but<br/>
I&#39;m not seeing that happen yet. Same thing with the hand washing he&#39;s<br/>
not remembering it on his own yet. As I write this out I realize I am<br/>
wanting him to remember these things on his own, perhaps am I wanting<br/>
too much out of him too soon, and when he is ready he will do these<br/>
things on his own? <br/>
<br/>
      I try not to prompt or remind unless it&#39;s something I really<br/>
feel is worth saying. For example a lot of days he forgets to brush<br/>
his hair but I only mention it if we&#39;re going out somewhere. Am I<br/>
doing the right thing with these occasional reminders? We do talk<br/>
about these things at other times he just hasn&#39;t caught on yet that he<br/>
needs to be the one responsible for doing them? Is there something<br/>
better I could be doing? And I should note that when i do make a<br/>
prompt he is almost always happy to comply. (That he is not just<br/>
growing dependent on me to remind him of these things? Is that the<br/>
schooly thought I am trying to get out of my head, or is that the<br/>
problem I&#39;m having is that he&#39;d too dependent on me to remind him?)<br/>
<br/>
    I have given up on his nail biting, he is like his dad and does it<br/>
in his sleep, it&#39;s not a voluntary thing on his part so I let it go<br/>
but I am unhappy inside that his nails will probably always look<br/>
terrible like his dads for the rest of his life, but I married his dad<br/>
anyway :) We have talked about it several times, about things he could<br/>
try, trying to let him come up with his own solutions. But I don&#39;t say<br/>
anything to him about it anymore as I figure if it is under his<br/>
control he will fix it eventually, that I would only be putting<br/>
unnecessary stress on him by saying something. So I&#39;m not sure it I&#39;m<br/>
doing the right thing there either.</div>

<br/>
Why not just ask him directly, &quot;Could you wash your hands before you  <br/>
use the computer?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This seems more like a kind of naggy hint:  &quot;I may prompt with something<br/>
like &quot;you might want to wash your hands&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d rather hear &quot;Hey, wash your hands&quot; than &quot;you might want to  <br/>
consider that maybe blah blah...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But what if you just call him over and wipe off his hands while  you  <br/>
say something nice to him?  You could get a warm, wet washcloth and  <br/>
say &quot;I saw ketchup and didn&#39;t want it on the keyboard,&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We do talk<br/>

needs to be the one responsible for doing them? Is there something<br/>
better I could be doing?-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Responsible&quot; is a harsh concept.  Ultimately you&#39;re &quot;responsible&quot;  <br/>
for your child&#39;s health and wellbeing.  &quot;Responsible&quot; means you have  <br/>
to answer for your decisions.  You might have to respond to a higher  <br/>
authority.   You can&#39;t really delegate that literal responsibility to  <br/>
your child.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am unhappy inside that his nails will probably always look<br/>
terrible like his dads for the rest of his life-=-<br/>
<br/>
Eeek!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s way to negative to think, and too negative to express.<br/>
Maybe your husband bit his nails from stress (maybe) and your son  <br/>
won&#39;t always, but it will help if you don&#39;t share your stress with  <br/>
him.  The calmer and more hopeful and joyful you the mom can be, the  <br/>
more hope and joy there is at your house.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe about teeth you could just ask &quot;Have you brushed your teeth yet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Pam Sorooshian might recommend saying no more than &quot;teeth.&quot;<br/>

and brush his teeth on his own.I think expectations are one of the  <br/>
biggest sources of stress for parents. When we starting thinking  <br/>
&quot;They&#39;re age x and should be doing y by now,&quot; it&#39;s hard not to see  <br/>
them and treat them as broken or lazy.<br/>
<br/>
If your goal is helping to keep the keyboard clean and helping him  <br/>
brush his teeth then I bet your stress level will go way down.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If someone is saying too much - repeatedly giving little mini- <br/>
lectures about why the teeth should be brushed or why the hands  <br/>
should be washed, as if THIS TIME the information is suddenly going  <br/>
to sink in. &quot;Use a word,&quot; helps short-circuit that habit and lets the  <br/>
kid think, &quot;Teeth? Oh, I should go brush them before bed,&quot; or &quot;Hands?  <br/>
Oh, I maybe should wash them before using the computer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I was thinking, though, that another good idea for the computer is  <br/>
to put a post-it note on it that says, &quot;Wash your hands.&quot; I have one  <br/>
on our pantry door, in the kitchen, that says, &quot;Close me.&quot; If we  <br/>
leave that door open, the dog gets in and takes boxes of food out to  <br/>
the back yard and tears them apart.<br/>
<br/>
I also have one on the toilet that says, &quot;If you poop, please flush  <br/>
twice,&quot; because our low-flow toilet is inadequate.<br/>
<br/>
Another suggestion I have is to not think about this as a big overall  <br/>
problem, think about only the specifics of what you actually want.  <br/>
Stop thinking about it as, &quot;He needs constant reminders,&quot; and,  <br/>
instead, think, &quot;I want him to wash his hands before using the  <br/>
computer.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Jayn (8) brushes her teeth way more often when no-one says anything to her <br/>
about it. When she visited the dentist recently (the beloved dentist btw) <br/>
and got something of a lecture about her teeth, she stopped brushing her <br/>
teeth completely for a few weeks, in the lead up to another filling visit. <br/>
Even hearing that her breath smelled bad from her friends had no good <br/>
effect.<br/>
<br/>
I talked to the dentist about the deleterious effect of giving lectures, but <br/>
I don&#39;t think that stopped her. We have simply decided to go for cleanings <br/>
at the dentist more often, and have Jayn&#39;s teeth sealed as they come in. The <br/>
receptionist told me that many of the kids with erratic brushing habits come <br/>
in extra often for cleanings.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Jayn how I could help, such as if she wanted to be reminded about <br/>
brushing, and she said she &quot;didn&#39;t mind&quot; being reminded, but I notice that <br/>
reminders created a resistance.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I stopped saying anything to her, she proudly announces her <br/>
brushing again. Protecting her own autonomy seems to be really important to <br/>
Jayn.<br/>

She also said not to worry about teeth brushing, he&#39;ll figure it out.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-883130177">My kids brush their own teeth.  They all went through a phase of not  <br/>
doing it much, and then they get older and hygiene becomes important,  <br/>
and they brush their teeth, change their socks lots, do their hair,  <br/>
take lots of showers, shave...<br/>
<br/>
Holly and Marty both had braces.  They both took good care of them.   <br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;make them.&quot; I hardly ever even inquired, because it was  <br/>
their choice to get those and they listened to the orthodontist and  <br/>
the technicians for feedback and ideas.  Marty didn&#39;t wear his rubber  <br/>
bands as much as they would have liked, but he had four, frequently,  <br/>
in odd configurations, and some days he&#39;d blow it off.  I didn&#39;t nag  <br/>
him.    Their teeth look great.  If after a few years they don&#39;t look  <br/>
as perfect as they do now, they&#39;ll still be better than if they  <br/>
hadn&#39;t had braces.<br/>

I keep in mind how I prefer his behaviour to be. When I&#39;M prompted <br/>
about something or other that doesn&#39;t match my preference, I prompt him <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t try to predict when I&#39;ll be prompted and I don&#39;t decide in <br/>

when the moment arises doesn&#39;t produce the desired outcome, I get on <br/>
with my life and come back to the subject when I&#39;m prompted again. <br/>
Maybe in the same way, maybe in a different way. I&#39;m the improv king. <br/>
So I&#39;m not any help to you with the details, unfortunately. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-346757840">Thomas (8) has hardly brushed since the L&L conference�we remind him but<br/>
it�s up to him if he does it or not, and I usually only mention it once a<br/>
week or so. He had a dentist appt last week and I told the hygienist about<br/>
this, and at the end, I asked if she�d noticed much difference in his teeth,<br/>
and she said there was just a little more build-up than previously. Of<br/>
course we go every 6 months, and this had been just about 8 wks of hardly<br/>
brushing. It�ll be interesting to see how it is in another 6 months. Also,<br/>
Thomas told me ahead of time he didn�t want to do the fluoride and I said<br/>
that was fine. So I told the hygienist and dentist, and they kind of tried<br/>
to push it, and commented that it�s important for emerging teeth. I said he<br/>
doesn�t have any right now, so how about we ask him next time we come? We<br/>
have well water, so no fluoride there. But I�ve heard different opinions on<br/>
the safety and need for it, so I�m really not bothered if he doesn�t get the<br/>
treatment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067248725">I have the opinion that needing fillings is not absolutely connected to<br/>
teeth brushing!  As a child I always felt it was terribly unfair that my<br/>
older brother brushed very seldom (even when reminded, nagged, threatened)<br/>
while I brushed at least twice daily;but I was the one who got cavities.<br/>
This was in the days before fluoride in city water or fluoride treatments at<br/>
the dentist and way before the use of sealants.     I think sealants for the<br/>
little crevices on the biting surfaces are a wonderful invention.<br/>
<br/>
My point is that I would not advise telling someone that it is their own<br/>
fault that they needed a filling. Besides, I also think the filling process<br/>
these days is a lot more refined and less stressful/painful than in the 50s.<br/>
