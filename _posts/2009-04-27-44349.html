Description<br/>
A total home based program for you to implement in your own home. Six  <br/>
different videos that you can watch that will assist you in setting  <br/>
better boundaries in your home and getting your child to earn what he  <br/>
receives instead of just receiving it.<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...and getting your child to earn what he receives instead of just  <br/>
receiving it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Like the bar-pressing rats of my psychology lab days in the 70&#39;s, I  <br/>
guess.  Think &quot;the Dharma Initiative&quot; and their training cages and  <br/>
buttons to push.  (or if you never watch Lost, never mind that part)<br/>
<br/>
The VIDEO 2 Using Effective Consequences<br/>
The description is &quot;Gives parents and arsenal of effective  <br/>
consequences they can use in practically any situation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;ARSENAL&quot;?  I do understand the use of simile, but arsenal is a very  <br/>
firepower-heavy word.  VERY antagonistic.  And people have arsenals in  <br/>
their own defense.   So to use that word, it seems he sees teens as  <br/>
enemies, to some extent.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still listening to the preview file of &quot;Using Effective  <br/>
Consequences&quot; and it&#39;s irritating me in a very specific way:  The guy  <br/>
is reading aloud, and not reading very well.   He&#39;s pronouncing &quot;a&quot;  <br/>
with a long &quot;a&quot; so that it sounds like a kid reading in school rather  <br/>
than an adult with a PhD imparting important information.   He reads  <br/>
as though he&#39;s reading this for the first time, too.<br/>
<br/>
But the content is interesting too.  Some quotes:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Rules are only effective when there are consequences to enforce them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How different that is from making choices.   The rule isn&#39;t that Keith  <br/>
goes to work and I stay home.  Keith went to work this morning because  <br/>
he would rather go to work than lose his job.  He would rather have  <br/>
money than lose our house.   I&#39;m home because I want to be; I chose it  <br/>
again today!   I&#39;m thinking now where else I could go.  Surely I have  <br/>
friends and relatives who would let me move in right now today.  I  <br/>
have a charge card and a car.  I could walk out of this house and  <br/>
never come back.  But I WANT to be here.  I like it here!<br/>
<br/>
This guy who wants me to put a link to his site on my parenting  <br/>
peacefull page says &quot;Without rules and consequences the family cannot  <br/>
properly function.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Properly function&quot;?<br/>
That&#39;s so different from &quot;live joyfully.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Home Contracts have been used for years to effectuate change in teens.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s from Video 4&#39;s description.   I hate words like &quot;effectuate.&quot;   <br/>
They&#39;re bullshit.   But who wants to buy videos or personal coaching  <br/>
from someone who doesn&#39;t know big words they don&#39;t understand?<br/>
<br/>
Video 5 promises help about this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Recognizing specific warning signs is essential to being an effective  <br/>
parent.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I bet nothing in there will suggest that parents might have done  <br/>
differently long before the kids were teens, unless it&#39;s to shame the  <br/>
parents for not having had stronger consequences years earlier.   And  <br/>
I suppose this guy could say &quot;Well my daughter never wrestled in  <br/>
pudding.&quot;   In the warning signs, in the one minute they give away,   <br/>
One of the sections is the effect of parents.   They seem to be seeing  <br/>
the kids as a total liability to parental peace and prosperity or  <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
Probably they do well with selling their assistance to families who&#39;ve  <br/>
botched the job and just want to make it through the last few years of  <br/>
the teen years before they can cut them off at 18.  It&#39;s as though  <br/>
they&#39;re raising wild mongooses and javelinas they don&#39;t recognize and  <br/>
they want an arsenal of tools to control them until they can release  <br/>
them into society at 18 or 21.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here who wants a glimpse of an extremely different view of  <br/>
teens might look at some of those little samples of the videos they&#39;re  <br/>
SELLING that lead up to suggesting kids can be put in &quot;structured  <br/>
schools&quot; (detainment centers) or boot camps.  And if the families  <br/>
can&#39;t afford the low monthly payments, they can be offset by community  <br/>
outreach (which I figure means they&#39;ll be out drumming up more  <br/>
business for the lock-up programs.   It&#39;s kinda horrible. (the sixth  <br/>
video).<br/>
<br/>
One of the stories in that 6th sample is a girl whose dad used to  <br/>
defend her from her stepmother, but now she&#39;s in a lockup.<br/>
<br/>
In the notes below one of the disturbing things is:<br/>
&quot; Almost without exception, just a few days or even a weekend at a  <br/>
highly structured, regimented, disciplined and supervised Intervention  <br/>
Center and Teens become highly motivated to cooperate with parents,  <br/>
show them respect, and follow all home rules in lieu of staying longer  <br/>
or returning. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I have an unreasonable prejudice, but without looking the guy  <br/>
up, I&#39;m guessing he&#39;s from Tennessee or Georgia or Alabama and that  <br/>
he&#39;s Baptist.    And if I go and read about him and find that I&#39;m true  <br/>
is it then &quot;unreasonable prejudice&quot; to think I know some more about  <br/>
his beliefs and upbringing?   And if I say that, then will some people  <br/>
not say &quot;See?  She&#39;s saying Christians can&#39;t be unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Certainly it&#39;s jumpy, jittery logic, but so is all of this &quot;worldview&quot;  <br/>
that considers obedience and being seen and not heard &quot;real world&quot; and  <br/>
honest communications and loving relationships to be bad and wrong.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s interesting!  I have recently done a search on teens ditching<br/>
school, since that was a recent event at our house.  If you do a google<br/>
search just on that, you come up with tons of sites like the one this<br/>
guy is promoting.  They are all geared to parents trying to control<br/>
their teens.  They have only a few years left and they need them to jump<br/>
through the hoops of school and getting a diploma and staying out of<br/>
trouble, just long enough to make it to adulthood.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote a little bit about it at my blog<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jenniferstar.blogspot.com/2009/04/aww-teens-ditching-school.html&#92;">http://jenniferstar.blogspot.com/2009/04/aww-teens-ditching-school.html&#92;</a><br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   and linked another of those horrid sites, with the same kind of<br/>
 </span></blockquote>philosophy, selling to scared parents.<br/>
<br/>
Clearly there is a market there for selling to scared parents that have<br/>
botched the job of raising their kids and suddenly have teens that<br/>
actually have a mind of their own, OMG, and are doing things that, in<br/>
light of reality, actually make sense, but go against all parental ideas<br/>
of what is acceptable for teens to do.  I wonder sometimes if parents<br/>
even remember what they themselves did as teens and how they felt about<br/>
life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m soooo glad that my kids don&#39;t live in reactionary land.  They do<br/>
things because they want to and it makes sense to do it and they get to<br/>
do it with my blessings!<br/>

really proves that a teen is doin well in life eh?  I like how the the<br/>

but that guy (and lots and lots of parenting &quot;experts&quot; would say - keith went to work this morning *because of the consdequences* if he didn&#39;t go. in fact, a dad in our connected parenting class last week said something specifically to that effect  - &quot;kids need to learn to live in the real world - to do a job - you don&#39;t work if you don&#39;t get paid, etc&quot;<br/>
<br/>
i am NOT defending that perspective above, i am just sayin&#39; - &quot;choices&quot; is the cornerstone to lots and lots of really pretty awful parenting &quot;techniques&quot; - but it is the parent offering the false array of choices:  do you want to stay at the boot camp, or come home and obey?  do you want to eat all your dinner, or sit at the table all night?  do you want to clean your room, or &#39;lose&#39; your ipod?<br/>
<br/>
so when talking about &quot;choices&quot; and &quot;consequences&quot; to most of the parenting world, those words mean something so different....<br/>

<br/>
  yes, and not just that - even more subtle, i think, are the ways in which parents &quot;allow&quot; the &quot;natural consequenecs&quot; of kids&#39; actions to fall squarely on the kids&#39; shoulders, in the name of &quot;tough love&quot; or &quot;learning a lesson&quot; - <br/>
<br/>
  it starts when kids are really little - a 3 year old refuses to put on a coat, so the parent doesn&#39;t even bring one along and when the 3 year old is cold, the parent says &quot;see, i told you so - now we need  to go home because you were too stupid to listen to mommy&quot; (well - not in those words, but...)<br/>
<br/>
  or when an older child mis-judges whether she/he will be hungry and the parent refuses to buy a snack, while out, because the kid didn&#39;t eat before leaving, as &quot;instructed&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  so even natural, related &quot;consequences&quot; can be used to manipulate, control, and send the message &quot;i am smart, you are dumb, and you&#39;d best learn to listen to me and not think for yourself&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Ok they were controlling but I still realized that they cared if I were <br/>
cold or hungry way way more than if I were obedient.  They made it <br/>
their responsibility to make sure.  Not mine.<br/>
<br/>
As annoying as it is to be controlled and coerced, being manipulated <br/>
comes off as frightening, chaotic and irresponsible.<br/>

It&#39;s amazing the degrees in better or worse ways to relate to people.<br/>

This reminds me of when my daughter and I were taking a long RV trip together, we were somewhere between TN and VA and listening to the radio.  This commercial came on:  Is your child obnoxious?  and went on to describe a &#39;program&#39; for kids who were rebellious, angry, disobedient, disregarded authority, etc, and guaranteed to get results (ie control over your kid).  Call for an initial consult and they guaranteed some sort of result in 3 minutes or less.<br/>
<br/>
We still laugh about that one.  I&#39;ve now seen similar ads on TV, and we crack up every time we see it.  It&#39;s nice to see my kids growing and making good decisions, because they WANT to, not because they fear me, or because I demand they be obedient.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Eew. That website sucks.<br/>
<br/>
I get that sometimes too. The first few link requests, I did write<br/>
back myself to suggest that if they&#39;d actually bothered to look at my<br/>
website they&#39;d know the answer was &quot;no&quot; before they emailed me. Now I<br/>
just ignore them. They&#39;re like those internet marketers on Facebook<br/>
who send out requests to everybody who shows up in their keyword<br/>
searches.<br/>

This was my first really disturbing one, so it was fun for me to write  <br/>
in such a way that maybe he will actually look at my page, and maybe  <br/>
have a bad dream or two.  If he&#39;s a little disturbed, that&#39;s good  <br/>
enough for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010363803">&lt;&lt;&lt; I think when parents use  a &quot;program&quot; like that  they can then say: &quot;We<br/>
tried everything and nothing worked&quot; Its a way of shifting the &quot;blame&quot;. It<br/>
was not their fault the kid turned out that way. It was the kid that was<br/>
rotten. Nothing they did helped. &quot;We did everything right and I don&#39;t know<br/>
what happened that they became like that&quot;              Alex Polikowsky&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
OMG!!! I have a friend like that! She has 4 kids and the oldest is 19. He<br/>
just got married to a girl who has a baby from her previous boyfriend, and<br/>
he has a baby from his previous girlfriend (the 2 girls were born on the<br/>
same day and turned 1 in Feb!), and now (actually before the wedding) they<br/>
are pregnant with their own baby due in July! This kid and his new wife live<br/>
in his parents&#39; home in a basement apartment. He sometimes has a job,<br/>
sometimes doesn&#39;t. Doesn&#39;t pay rent (or maybe sometimes pays half?) even<br/>
though they set it real cheap. He drives like a maniac and I think has<br/>
wrecked a car. His mom watches his daughter while that baby&#39;s mom goes to<br/>
college and plays volleyball (because her parents want her to have a life)<br/>
and he doesn&#39;t even come upstairs to see her. His mom is raising his baby!<br/>
When they get mad at the parents, they talk about moving out, but realized<br/>
they don&#39;t have any money to afford rent anywhere else so they are still<br/>
there.<br/>
 <br/>
And she swears she doesn&#39;t know what happened to him. No idea where she went<br/>
wrong. This kid was just a bad seed from the start. His whole life he gave<br/>
her trouble and she just can&#39;t figure out why he turned out this way. But<br/>
her other 3 kids are fine! So it can&#39;t be HER fault, right?! The other 2<br/>
teenage boys seem OK, but maybe just aren&#39;t as strong willed as the oldest<br/>
one. Maybe whatever techniques she used on him (that didn&#39;t work) were honed<br/>
by the time the next 2 came along. Maybe he was treated differently, maybe<br/>
not. Who knows?! Does it even matter? She acts like she did everything<br/>
right, but I don&#39;t think that attitude is helping her have a good adult<br/>
relationship with her son and his wife and kids. I feel for her situation,<br/>
but have no idea what sort of advice to offer so I don&#39;t!<br/>
 <br/>
She homeschools in a loose manner from what I&#39;ve seen, almost like<br/>
unschooling but more like unstructured home &quot;school,&quot; which is probably<br/>
worse than a stricter type of home school where at least the kids know what<br/>
to expect and what is expected of them.<br/>

Maybe he doesn&#39;t have the same dad?<br/>
Maybe he resented being displaced as the first/only child, and never  <br/>
recovered (maybe his mom didn&#39;t handle that well; my mom didn&#39;t).<br/>
