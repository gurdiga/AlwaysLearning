Imitation Learning<br/>
by Robert Genn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Researchers at the Volen Center for Complex Systems at Brandeis <br/>
University have taken a second look at &quot;imitation learning.&quot; It seems <br/>
that when natural talent is added to one&#39;s flagrant imitation of <br/>
others, what results may be the dual assets needed to gain proficiency. <br/>
Repeated practice and focused desire come into the equation as well. <br/>
&quot;We are trying to determine what strategies will optimize imitation <br/>
learning,&quot; says study co-author Robert Sekular. &quot;These strategies are <br/>
crucial for acquiring many of the skills needed in daily life. A lot of <br/>
what we do is learned by watching and imitating others.&quot; This includes <br/>
tying our shoes, feeding ourselves and, apparently, creating art.<br/>
<br/>
Humans have a natural tendency--in some cases a necessity--to do things <br/>
in the &quot;correct&quot; way. Much basic learning is done in &quot;monkey see, <br/>
monkey do&quot; methodology. This goes for sophisticated procedures as well. <br/>
Novice heart surgeons, for example, learn order, technique and <br/>
proficiency by watching seasoned pros. Golf swings are refined by <br/>
playing Tiger&#39;s videos. Complex ballet steps are mastered by observing <br/>
the legs and feet of expert ballet dancers. It&#39;s the honoured principle <br/>
of the &quot;demo.&quot; While some human activities are more formalized than <br/>
others, &quot;visual recipe gathering&quot; is part of our psyche.<br/>
<br/>
The visual arts present a problem in this area. Time-tested processes <br/>
and academic principles are, of course, valuable, but when large <br/>
numbers of artists begin to imitate one another a kind of rigor mortis <br/>
creeps into the creative landscape. Art often expects and demands that <br/>
one artist be unique from the next. Artists on a quest to find &quot;the <br/>
secret&quot; can easily fall into the imitation pit. In art, there&#39;s no <br/>
single, golden way.<br/>
Ideally, individualists need to sidestep imitation learning and instead <br/>
rely on direct observation of either the physical world or the universe <br/>
of the human mind. That&#39;s why self-education is so important in the <br/>
visual arts. Becoming a student of your own processes and following <br/>
your nose in the quietude of your workspace can be the most effective <br/>
route to private bliss and public success.<br/>
<br/>
Many art schools understand and exemplify this dichotomy by teaching <br/>
little but attitude. This is often a mistake. Those experts at Brandeis <br/>
say we grab our basics by imitation learning, but it seems it is only <br/>
later that we get a decent grab at attitude.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards,<br/>

PS: &quot;All education must be, in the end, self-education.&quot;<br/>
(Robert Henri)<br/>
<br/>
Esoterica: If you accept the proposition, as many do, that imitation <br/>
learning is the swiftest way to proficiency in the arts, a certain <br/>
obligation comes with your process. Sooner or later you must give a <br/>
personal spin and attempt to raise your standards beyond that of your <br/>
imitated master. Apart from being valuable in the building of <br/>
self-esteem, this move is vital to wider acceptance and is more in <br/>
harmony with the idealized wisdom of art history. There is a price to <br/>
pay if you don&#39;t. In the words of landscape painter A. Y. Jackson, <br/>
&quot;Those who follow are always behind.&quot;<br/>
