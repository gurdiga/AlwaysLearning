<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282880294">I&#39;m going to be on the radio tomorrow night (Tuesday) discussing  <br/>
unschooling.  There&#39;s no way to know in advance whether the tone and  <br/>
mood will be hostile or supportive or what.  I&#39;ve thought through  <br/>
possibilities, and I&#39;m prepared for just about any eventuality but am  <br/>
a little concerned about the idea of &quot;fairness,&quot; so I hoped to get  <br/>
help with that, and so it seemed a good first topic for a series of  <br/>
topics I&#39;d like to keep going.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;series&quot; I mean a random serial set.  By &quot;set&quot; I mean some subset  <br/>
of the universe, real and imagined.  The topics I have picked out for  <br/>
the first three are fairness, wood and bass [guitar or whatever  <br/>
musical bass].  Deborah Cunefare has suggested walls, ice and felt-- <br/>
all good wintery topics (with apologies to Australia and New Zealand).<br/>

(There&#39;s the topic blog.)<br/>

radio-interview.html<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be available to hear afterwards, and I&#39;m in the middle  <br/>
hour.  The website preserves the first hour of free-for-all call-in,  <br/>
but not the middle hour where the interviews are.<br/>
<br/>
Back to the topics blog, though, sometimes parents say they&#39;re at a  <br/>
loss for ideas for strewing, or that they don&#39;t feel creative.  This  <br/>
might be an aid in that area--strewing for the parents.  Some weeks  <br/>
you&#39;ll probably have no interest in the topic, but sometimes it might  <br/>
be a &quot;whole unit study&quot;!  (I&#39;m joking, but then again, a little  <br/>
obsession never hurt anybody.  Too much obsession, maybe so...)   <br/>
Invite the kids, invite the spouse, the inlaws, and neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

That will work better than the whole real blog link, which is (and  <br/>
might be cut off again):<br/>
