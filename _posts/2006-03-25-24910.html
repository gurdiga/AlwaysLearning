<div id="ygrps-yiv-1950103919">Sandra - I&#39;m sorry if I came across hostile - that&#39;s not my intent at all.  I&#39;ve been reading and re-reading your website, Joyce&#39;s, Danielle&#39;s,Ren&#39;s, and other sources.  I&#39;m trying to understand unschooling myself.  My husband doesn&#39;t know much about it.  He was raised in a house like most, where adults were the rule.  He is interested in learning, but has some concerns.  I&#39;m happy that he was interested in finding out more!    My husband doesn&#39;t think that going to Harvard or being a doctor is successful.  After all, he got a GED after being bored in high school.  His fears come more from the &quot;lack of control&quot; aspect than the unschooling aspect.  He has no problem with &quot;living and learning&quot;.  He was honestly wondering, though, if children who were unschooled were encouraged to go on to &quot;mainstream professions&quot;.  I tried to explain to him that I&#39;m sure some do, if that&#39;s what they are passionate about.  But I&#39;m still learning and unschooling myself, so I couldn&#39;t explain it well.  I guess he is worried that he didn&#39;t do much with his life because he wasn&#39;t encouraged, and he wants to be sure that his children (we have 5) reach whatever their potential is.  He just wants to be sure that he gives them all they need, and that they don&#39;t &quot;settle&quot; for something.  All of this is coming from his perspective, and the life that he has lived, which has been very rough, to say the least.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have many or any close &quot;professional&quot; friends, so we couldn&#39;t ask them about that.  He never went to college and I went to three different colleges and dropped out.  I&#39;m now going back to get my degree simply because I want to - not because I Have To.  And it will be much more exciting for me to finish because I&#39;m doing it just to learn more, and not for a &quot;career&quot; or to make money (such a lie they tell).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway....I&#39;m sorry again.  Hubby and I were kind of in the midst of an argument about parenting and such, and my angst probably came across in my writing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to those of you who answered.  I will continue to read and learn, and visit the links and read the books that have been mentioned.<br/>

<br/>
But I had the feeling (possibly unwarranted)that he wants to be  <br/>
taught about unschooling, to be spoonfed.   It seems he wants  <br/>
unschoolers to defend themselves for his benefit (or might actually  <br/>
want us to fail to defend ourselves, for his benefit, if he&#39;s in  <br/>
opposition to the idea of unschooling).   He&#39;s not our proctor and  <br/>
this isn&#39;t a test.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to go with unit studies or some easy curriculum for a  <br/>
while until you can BOTH read more about unschooling and see how  <br/>
other ways work, that might be better than having arguments about  <br/>
it.  You shouldn&#39;t have to take tests either.  And nobody here will  <br/>
make a commission if you decide to unschool.  It&#39;s not like we&#39;re  <br/>
selling water purifiers or cable TV or SUVs and have to answer a  <br/>
badillion questions from comparison-shopping customers to make our  <br/>
percentage.   We&#39;re people helping just to be nice, sharing our lives  <br/>
LOTS, openly, and freely.  He can stick his feet, his hand, his face,  <br/>
in that river of information, but he can&#39;t dam it up and divert it  <br/>
into his own stream.<br/>
<br/>
It might help, if his concerns are as you say, not to try to prove  <br/>
that unschooling will guarantee anything, but simply to show that  <br/>
school doesn&#39;t guarantee it AND school is known to cause other problems.<br/>

<br/>
 Actually, we were already unschoolers.  It&#39;s the &quot;radical unschooling&quot; that he was having issues with.  We have made the transition from using a curriculum, to living.  The issue is the bedtimes, the tv, computer, eating when they want, etc, etc.  He&#39;s just against it and just thinks I&#39;m being a &quot;crazy liberal&quot;  LOL.<br/>
<br/>
Now I think if we can somehow make it to the conference in September he&#39;ll see things differently.  He needs to meet radical unschoolers, and then maybe he&#39;ll understand.  It&#39;s a paradigm shift and one that I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ready to make yet.  It will take time.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m here to grow and learn, and do what I can with my children....before they &quot;have to&quot; go to bed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155106525">Melissa (and others with more than the &quot;average&quot; number of kids) how do you handle ru with all those folks running around?!  LOL  And how are you guys making it to the conference?  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a loner by nature, and prefer quiet to noise.  And when the kids are up they are screaming and stomping and jumping, and we live in an apartment.  I don&#39;t want our downstairs neighbors to complain about the noise.  3 complaints and we get booted out.  <br/>
<br/>
And what about little things like the food budget?  I don&#39;t mind my kids eating what they want - that&#39;s how I grew up.  I just don&#39;t know how I can afford a food bill that is more than my rent!  And with 7 ppl in a house, it can easily be more than $1000.  So I end up having to tell them that they can&#39;t eat all of such-and-such because it&#39;s not in the budget to buy anymore.  Or, once it&#39;s all gone there won&#39;t be anymore.  And I don&#39;t like having to do that.  I just don&#39;t know how to get around that particular issue.  Food is expensive.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so excited about ru, and so frustrated at the same time because I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m able to &quot;do it&quot; like I&#39;d like.  But that&#39;s my controlling Virgo nature - trying to get it &quot;right&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
Help me out guys!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207156843"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;(and others with more than the &quot;average&quot; number of kids) how do you handle<br/>
 </span></blockquote>ru with all those folks running around?!&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;And what about little things like the food budget?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are 7 people in our family (4 kids, 2 parents, 1 rather needy<br/>
grandmother). We&#39;ve unschooled with the label for almost 4 years, and<br/>
without the label for a few years before that. Our budget has varied from<br/>
below the poverty level to times of financial wealth. In any of those times,<br/>
we have just put the information out there to the whole family. &quot;This month<br/>
we have about $500 for food, what do you want to do?&quot; Ideas vary all the<br/>
time, but it is always a sure thing that we have an agreed upon plan in the<br/>
end. And I often have little to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we have plenty of money and I just ask what people want before I<br/>
go to the store. Sometimes people will get a list going on their own and<br/>
give it to me or post it. Sometimes I go to the grocery store twice in a<br/>
day, or three or more times in a week. It just depends on the time and the<br/>
needs and the wants.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we label food so that food that particular people pick out special<br/>
isn&#39;t eaten by someone else by mistake. We&#39;ve had almost no problem with<br/>
people eating someone else&#39;s labeled food or portion...everyone respects<br/>
everyone else&#39;s stuff. That comes with unschooling in general...everyone<br/>
feels respected and in turn respects others and their stuff.<br/>
<br/>
So for the food portion of your question, I would suggest sharing all the<br/>
information and talking about it together. If you take yourself out of the<br/>
control seat, the group will probably direct you on how to spend the food<br/>
money just fine. You of course have your own food choices to add into the<br/>
mix.<br/>
<br/>
I would also suggest that as much as possible the situation is set up so<br/>
that you don&#39;t control others&#39; food intake. If things are labeled in a way<br/>
that everyone can understand, that should take you out of that arena pretty<br/>
much. If someone wants to eat more than you think they should portion out,<br/>
give them the information about them eating the whole thing in one sitting,<br/>
and let them decide.<br/>
<br/>
People share their &quot;special&quot; foods with others pretty regularly around here.<br/>
That is always a beautiful thing to see. Even if we can&#39;t buy everything<br/>
everyone wanted, we all still feel like we have an abundance. That comes<br/>
from being listened to, and being part of the decision-making process, and<br/>
having control. We feel contentedly full.<br/>
<br/>
My 12 yo son wanted a new video game when we were at Universal Studios. I<br/>
had about $20 that I could spend on it...the rest was for gas and food. He<br/>
wanted one that just came out...it was $50. I literally took the cash out of<br/>
my pocket and we counted together. I never said no. We thought quietly for a<br/>
moment. Then he said, &quot;Do you think that Grammie will lend me $30 if I pay<br/>
her back from my money when we get home?&quot; She was with us and my answer was,<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t know...you want me to ask?&quot; He asked her himself, she said yes<br/>
(even though she struggles with the unlimited video game playing) and he<br/>
bought the game. He was SOO happy. He kept hugging us and thanking us...for<br/>
hours! As soon as we got home, he paid her back.<br/>
<br/>
He felt full...full of love, full of appreciation, full of abundance. Even<br/>
though it wasn&#39;t an automatic easy purchase.<br/>
<br/>
As far as &quot;all those folks running around&quot; state above, it is the life we<br/>
chose. It is work to make sure that you are paying attention to what each<br/>
child&#39;s experiences are each day, to be watchful for their individual tastes<br/>
and needs, while you are tending the whole group. This may be more work than<br/>
a family with one or two kids, but that doesn&#39;t matter. You may have to<br/>
expand yourself beyond what others do, but it&#39;s just your job. The question<br/>
of &quot;how do you handle ru...&quot; makes me think that you are &quot;handling&quot; things<br/>
rather than living life happily. Can you think of this very active time as<br/>
enjoyable? I think that would make a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
I have felt very s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with the activity of our lives at times,<br/>
but then I remember it is just a feeling. It can be released like every<br/>
other feeling so that I can be completely present in this moment with<br/>
whomever I am with, in joy.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are older now and I rather be with them than anyone else in the<br/>
world. I SO enjoy being with them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to share more about this but have to go. This was certainly long<br/>
enough!<br/>
<br/>
Jacki, off to sleep in a house where 3 are already asleep, 1 is about to be<br/>
asleep (me), and 3 will be active for a while longer...</div>

I realize some people do consider unschooling to be a thing to do  <br/>
during school hours, but without school, I don&#39;t believe there can be  <br/>
school hours, or subjects, or a separation between the breathing,  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe you&#39;ve looked at that already, but there might be some things  <br/>
you could quote for your husband.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to the conference with your kids who are used to being  <br/>
controlled, they might go wild and crazy and your husband won&#39;t be  <br/>
impressed.  If he believes kids should sit and clean their plates and  <br/>
then go to bed by the clock, he will be unimpressed.<br/>
<br/>
If there are too many people at the conference who aren&#39;t at that  <br/>
point yet, nobody will be very impressed.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have had problems in the past with kids who were brought  <br/>
there for their first taste of freedom.  People should probably  <br/>
practice their first tastes of freedom at home, and the younger the  <br/>
better.  Big, loud, dangerous teens who have been controlled and then  <br/>
are let loose can disturb the peace.  Little kids who are where  <br/>
others are free to run as they&#39;re used to can seem confused and  <br/>
unhappy if other kids are getting to do what they can&#39;t, yet if  <br/>
they&#39;re unaccustomed to making decisions and being responsible, the  <br/>
parents really can&#39;t let them go far.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about the conference, it&#39;s about a gradual transition and a  <br/>
belief that it can work.<br/>
<br/>
As to eating when one is hungry and not eating a single bite more  <br/>
than one wants, there are resources on that that are not at all based  <br/>
on unschooling.  And if that one is understood, bedtimes and watching  <br/>
DVDs will probably seem very similar.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a>  I  <br/>

If a family shows up here who&#39;s still doing school at home and wants  <br/>
to unschool, maybe the talk about food and chores and bedtimes is  <br/>
just going to overwhelm and confuse them. Because there CAN be  <br/>
unschooling in a family where kids also have chores and bedtimes and  <br/>
have to clean their plates. I don&#39;t personally think it will have the  <br/>
depth or benefit, ultimately, as a house where the children&#39;s  <br/>
preferences and freedoms have high priority, but it could still  <br/>
absolutely be, in homeschooling terms, unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Jacqueline (Ivorygrace7...) responded:<br/>
<br/>
I think this is a good point, and something I had been wondering  <br/>
about. We have unschooled for the past five years. My children had no  <br/>
assigned academic work; no TV, computer, or video game rules; and in  <br/>
general did what they wanted to when they wanted to. But they did  <br/>
have chores, and they did have regular meal and snack times and no  <br/>
food in between, and they did have bedtimes.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, after being on this list for only a few days, I  <br/>
started to get the point of doing away with bedtimes, food control,  <br/>
and chores. I saw the whole picture and respect my children a lot  <br/>
more because of it. We no longer have assigned chores and surprise,  <br/>
surprise, my children often are willing to help out anyways. We no  <br/>
longer have any food controls, and I ask my children what they would  <br/>
like before I go to the grocery store, and believe it or not, I think  <br/>
they eat healthier than before. We no longer have bedtimes, and the  <br/>
kids do stay up a lot later than they used to, and they&#39;re sometimes  <br/>
too noisy even when I tell them that I&#39;m trying to rest, but this is  <br/>
still new to them, and I think they&#39;ll settle down after a while when  <br/>
they trust the situation more.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s great that all these topics were discussed on this list.  <br/>
This is a great place for other unschoolers like myself to see that  <br/>
there can be so much more to unschooling than just not doing formal  <br/>
academics.<br/>

There are some circumstances in which radical unschooling can&#39;t and  <br/>
won&#39;t work.  It&#39;s not for everyone, and it does requlre that the  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s better to start with not making them eat what they don&#39;t want to  <br/>
eat, and figuring out how to make what they do want to eat more  <br/>
palatable and interesting.   Exaggerated thinking like  &quot;I just don&#39;t  <br/>
know how I can afford a food bill that is more than my rent! &quot; is a  <br/>
way of rejecting ideas.  Some people get into the habit of just  <br/>
rejecting ideas without really turning them over and examining them.   <br/>
That&#39;s okay, and sometimes the choices really aren&#39;t there.<br/>

-=-I&#39;m so excited about ru, and so frustrated at the same time  <br/>
because I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m able to &quot;do it&quot; like I&#39;d like.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You might not be able to do it with so many kids in so small a  <br/>
space.  Other considerations might win out.  And if your husband  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want it, you can&#39;t have it.  That&#39;s part of a partnership.   <br/>
One of you can&#39;t buy a yacht over the other&#39;s objections, and  <br/>
unschooling is a little like owning a yacht.  It takes a lot of  <br/>
planning and maintenance and it changes your whole life and not  <br/>
everyone can have or even wants a yacht.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could figure out ways to lighten up, though, and maybe you  <br/>
could persuade your husband to soften by showing him how the children  <br/>
are changing.  Show him with your children, though, not other  <br/>
people&#39;s, when you can.<br/>

It can seem out of control. I do &#39;breathe&#39; a lot.<br/>
We&#39;ll be driving to the conference.<br/>

&gt; complain about the noise.  3 complaints and we get booted out.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My question would be to ask why are the kids screaming and stomping  <br/>
and jumping inside? We go outside for that kind of play. If they get  <br/>
loud, I note aloud that things are getting wild and ask if they want  <br/>
to get somewhere that&#39;s it&#39;s easier to burn energy. Then we head  <br/>
outside. The kids know that too much noise makes it hard for anyone  <br/>
to hear someone else, so they are pretty considerate of that.  <br/>
Sometimes they just need to be loud! Another idea is to make good  <br/>
friends with your neighbor. Social capital is a good thing for  <br/>
anyone, and by getting to know them, they are a lot more  <br/>
understanding. Ask them what times of the day they&#39;re home, when  <br/>
they&#39;re gone, just be sure to tell them that you want to make living  <br/>
underneath you easier! It really worked well when we were in  <br/>
apartments. That way when the neighbors are at work or something, you  <br/>
can plan to instigate some noisy rambunctiousness.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; And what about little things like the food budget?  I don&#39;t mind my  <br/>
&gt; kids eating what they want - that&#39;s how I grew up.  I just don&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; know how I can afford a food bill that is more than my rent!  And  <br/>
&gt; with 7 ppl in a house, it can easily be more than $1000.  So I end  <br/>
&gt; up having to tell them that they can&#39;t eat all of such-and-such  <br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s not in the budget to buy anymore.  Or, once it&#39;s all  <br/>
&gt; gone there won&#39;t be anymore.  And I don&#39;t like having to do that.   <br/>
&gt; I just don&#39;t know how to get around that particular issue.  Food is  <br/>
&gt; expensive.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know that I&#39;m much help with the food. We have two kids with  <br/>
severe food allergies. They have their own bins with food that is  <br/>
just for them. The other kids understand that. They&#39;ve seen their  <br/>
siblings get very ill on other foods, and want to make their lives  <br/>
easier by not eating that food. WHen you can&#39;t have wheat or corn, it  <br/>
really limits what you can have store-bought, so I guess that they&#39;re  <br/>
fine with leaving those for the two.<br/>
What I can suggest is getting a club card. We shop at Sam&#39;s. WHile  <br/>
it&#39;s not always a deal, it really can help with most of it. We aren&#39;t  <br/>
spending money that other people would, by breast-feeding and using  <br/>
cloth products. We don&#39;t&#39; usually buy name brand anything. We buy  <br/>
cases of meat, because it&#39;s a lot cheaper by the pound. We joined a  <br/>
food coop. And always include the kids in budgeting and shopping. If  <br/>
you talk with them about how much money you have and what bills have  <br/>
to be paid, they&#39;re pretty cool about making choices that benefit  <br/>
everyone. At the beginning of the month, we pay all the bills, and  <br/>
then head to Sam&#39;s. The kids pick out cases of snacks, candy, fruit,  <br/>
etc. We store it up the cabinets, and it usually lasts throughout the  <br/>
month. We make a lot of snacks from scratch (it helps with the food  <br/>
issues) and that&#39;s a ton easier. $5 for 24# of flour, and another few  <br/>
dollars for eggs, chocolate chips and baking soda, butter, and you  <br/>
have enough cookies to feed the neighborhood. Or a $$$ of yeast is  <br/>
enough bread to keep the kids in for a month. There are innumerable  <br/>
ways to give your kids the food they want on a meager budget. Plus  <br/>
they get to make it and they love it.<br/>
Eh, i could go on and on. It all comes back to the fact that anything  <br/>
is possible.</div>

&gt; &gt;&gt;(and others with more than the &quot;average&quot; number of kids) how do<br/>
you handle<br/>
&gt; ru with all those folks running around?!&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;And what about little things like the food budget?&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are 7 people in our family (4 kids, 2 parents, 1 rather needy<br/>
&gt; grandmother). We&#39;ve unschooled with the label for almost 4 years, and<br/>
&gt; without the label for a few years before that. Our budget has varied<br/>
from<br/>
&gt; below the poverty level to times of financial wealth. In any of<br/>
those times,<br/>
&gt; we have just put the information out there to the whole family.<br/>
&quot;This month<br/>
&gt; we have about $500 for food, what do you want to do?&quot; Ideas vary all the<br/>
&gt; time, but it is always a sure thing that we have an agreed upon plan<br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; end. And I often have little to do with it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes we have plenty of money and I just ask what people want<br/>
before I<br/>
&gt; go to the store. Sometimes people will get a list going on their own and<br/>
&gt; give it to me or post it. Sometimes I go to the grocery store twice in a<br/>
&gt; day, or three or more times in a week. It just depends on the time<br/>
and the<br/>
&gt; needs and the wants.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes we label food so that food that particular people pick out<br/>
special<br/>
&gt; isn&#39;t eaten by someone else by mistake. We&#39;ve had almost no problem with<br/>
&gt; people eating someone else&#39;s labeled food or portion...everyone respects<br/>
&gt; everyone else&#39;s stuff. That comes with unschooling in general...everyone<br/>
&gt; feels respected and in turn respects others and their stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So for the food portion of your question, I would suggest sharing<br/>
all the<br/>
&gt; information and talking about it together. If you take yourself out<br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; control seat, the group will probably direct you on how to spend the<br/>
food<br/>
&gt; money just fine. You of course have your own food choices to add<br/>
into the<br/>
&gt; mix.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would also suggest that as much as possible the situation is set up so<br/>
&gt; that you don&#39;t control others&#39; food intake. If things are labeled in<br/>
a way<br/>
&gt; that everyone can understand, that should take you out of that arena<br/>
pretty<br/>
&gt; much. If someone wants to eat more than you think they should<br/>
portion out,<br/>
&gt; give them the information about them eating the whole thing in one<br/>
sitting,<br/>
&gt; and let them decide.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; People share their &quot;special&quot; foods with others pretty regularly<br/>
around here.<br/>
&gt; That is always a beautiful thing to see. Even if we can&#39;t buy everything<br/>
&gt; everyone wanted, we all still feel like we have an abundance. That comes<br/>
&gt; from being listened to, and being part of the decision-making<br/>
process, and<br/>
&gt; having control. We feel contentedly full.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My 12 yo son wanted a new video game when we were at Universal<br/>
Studios. I<br/>
&gt; had about $20 that I could spend on it...the rest was for gas and<br/>
food. He<br/>
&gt; wanted one that just came out...it was $50. I literally took the<br/>
cash out of<br/>
&gt; my pocket and we counted together. I never said no. We thought<br/>
quietly for a<br/>
&gt; moment. Then he said, &quot;Do you think that Grammie will lend me $30 if<br/>
I pay<br/>
&gt; her back from my money when we get home?&quot; She was with us and my<br/>
answer was,<br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t know...you want me to ask?&quot; He asked her himself, she said yes<br/>
&gt; (even though she struggles with the unlimited video game playing) and he<br/>
&gt; bought the game. He was SOO happy. He kept hugging us and thanking<br/>
us...for<br/>
&gt; hours! As soon as we got home, he paid her back.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He felt full...full of love, full of appreciation, full of<br/>
abundance. Even<br/>
&gt; though it wasn&#39;t an automatic easy purchase.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As far as &quot;all those folks running around&quot; state above, it is the<br/>
life we<br/>
&gt; chose. It is work to make sure that you are paying attention to what<br/>
each<br/>
&gt; child&#39;s experiences are each day, to be watchful for their<br/>
individual tastes<br/>
&gt; and needs, while you are tending the whole group. This may be more<br/>
work than<br/>
&gt; a family with one or two kids, but that doesn&#39;t matter. You may have to<br/>
&gt; expand yourself beyond what others do, but it&#39;s just your job. The<br/>
question<br/>
&gt; of &quot;how do you handle ru...&quot; makes me think that you are &quot;handling&quot;<br/>
things<br/>
&gt; rather than living life happily. Can you think of this very active<br/>
time as<br/>
&gt; enjoyable? I think that would make a big difference.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have felt very s-t-r-e-t-c-h-e-d with the activity of our lives at<br/>
times,<br/>
&gt; but then I remember it is just a feeling. It can be released like every<br/>
&gt; other feeling so that I can be completely present in this moment with<br/>
&gt; whomever I am with, in joy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids are older now and I rather be with them than anyone else in the<br/>
&gt; world. I SO enjoy being with them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wanted to share more about this but have to go. This was certainly<br/>
long<br/>
&gt; enough!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jacki, off to sleep in a house where 3 are already asleep, 1 is<br/>
about to be<br/>
&gt; asleep (me), and 3 will be active for a while longer...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a really good point.<br/>
<br/>
I was washing dishes and feeling content, and remembering times years  <br/>
ago when washing dishes could make me agitated and frustrated.  But I  <br/>
started being aware of my thoughts and attitudes and found that I  <br/>
could choose what to think.<br/>
<br/>
People whose thoughts wash over them, as mine did when I was young,  <br/>
like to think they have no choice, that they ARE unhappy.   My dad  <br/>
told me, when I was a teen, that I could choose to be happy.  I wish  <br/>
I had said &quot;What do you mean?&quot; and let him talk to me for a while,  <br/>
instead of bursting into tears and saying &quot;That&#39;s STUPID&quot; and running  <br/>
to my room.<br/>
<br/>
(I am, as usual, not talking about the first post or the issue  <br/>
originally brought up, but something connected, as all things are.)<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking how glad I was (this morning) to have enough spoons  <br/>
that we wouldn&#39;t run out of clean ones if I waited until morning to  <br/>
do the dishes.  I thought that I was glad we still had the plastic  <br/>
cup Kirby likes so much from when he was little, that he still  <br/>
chooses first, at the age of 19.  I like the enamelled steel  <br/>
casserole dish we&#39;ve had for over 20 years, that I got at the grocery  <br/>
store at one of those promotions where a different baking piece is on  <br/>
sale each week.  I think we paid $7 or $8 for it.   I use it ever  <br/>
week.  We have two smaller bowls that match it, which can be used to  <br/>
bake bread in, or as serving bowls.  And we have a skillet with a  <br/>
lid.   They have flowers on the sides.   We couldn&#39;t afford  <br/>
everything they had in that series, and we sacrificed to get those we  <br/>
got, because we were young and all that.  Tomorrow is our 21st  <br/>
wedding anniversary, and we were together six years before that.  Now  <br/>
we could afford a set of enamelware, but I couldn&#39;t buy something  <br/>
that we&#39;d had for 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
Things you get at a grocery store now might seem sweet and peaceful  <br/>
to you in twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
I *could* also have thought mean and irritating thoughts this  <br/>
morning.  Kirby didn&#39;t rinse his milk glass.  Someone else could have  <br/>
done the dishes last night, but Marty went to bed early so he could  <br/>
go to work early, and Kirby had a D&D game.  Holly was excited about  <br/>
some new photos she had taken of her newly-dyed hair, and was working  <br/>
on MySpace.  So I thought of what fun and fun they had had the night  <br/>
before, while I cleaned the kitchen, while my tea was brewing.<br/>
<br/>
It makes a big difference.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure some people think it&#39;s easy for me to say &quot;calm&quot; because my  <br/>
kids are teens.  But there are parents of three teens who spend a lot  <br/>
of energy nagging, fighting, pressuring and punishing.  We came to  <br/>
this calm from conscious direction and work.   And short of adoption  <br/>
or remarriage, people don&#39;t suddenly have three teens.  When Holly  <br/>
was born, Kirby was five. Marty was three.  I was already working on  <br/>
being a gentle parent.   If people take away the less gentle parts of  <br/>
modern family life and replace them with more gentle choices, life is  <br/>
more gentle already.<br/>
