<div id="ygrps-yiv-65653700">&lt;&lt;a sense of connectedness with all beings and things&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I stumbled across a book called &quot;Herbal Rituals&quot;.  This book is written<br/>
month by month.  The author talks almost poetically about the rhythms of<br/>
nature, noticing them, very intimate moments in her life with nature and<br/>
sharing her love of the earth with children.  She also mentions how several<br/>
religions interpret the changes of nature, from Paganism to Judaism.  In<br/>
each month/chapter, she talks about a particular herb and gives recipes for<br/>
various herbal mixtures.  I thought it was a wonderful book and gave me a<br/>
renewed way to look at our earth and how to share that with my kids.  We<br/>
made several of the herbal mixtures and continue to use them.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m Mary, mom to Ashley, Riley, and Tessa. 7, 5, 2. I would like to stay <br/>
here at the party. Could someone tell me how to put my mail on digest? I get <br/>
so much spam I prefer to read on digest. If someone can do it for me thank <br/>
you. If I need to do it, I work  well with simple, clear instructions. I&#39;m <br/>
living here in toddler zone and often have to put raging fires out moment by <br/>
moment. I long to think deeper with you all. I&#39;m very quick with a wash <br/>
cloth when milk spills and very slow in techno world. My hubby, Tim is a <br/>
self taught techno genius. We love nature, gardening and reading. Talk to <br/>
you all soon.<br/>
