she needs is the educrats out of her life and time to HEAL.   This is the <br/>
best opportunity you will ever have to give it to her.  It sounds to me like <br/>
she would be better off leaving school today and learning about herself and <br/>
not what a bunch of people who do not love her or have her best interests <br/>
think she should learn.  <br/>
<br/>
You have an amazing, unique and sterling opportunity to present an awesome <br/>
gift to her.  And that gift is simply time to BE.  Take her out of school <br/>
TODAY.  Bond with her by letting her be.  Give her freedom to be who she is.  <br/>
Let her be.<br/>

Good luck,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653768062">Dee,<br/>
I don&#39;t have the answers for you - except this.<br/>
My son can&#39;t spell. He&#39;s working on his Bachelors degree; he&#39;s a Staff Sgt in the USAF; he&#39;s a homeowner, he volunteers at Hospice - see where I&#39;m going w/ this??<br/>
You do not need to spell to home school.<br/>
<br/>
When I talked to the school dept. here in East Providence, RI, I was sent to the Director of Curriculum&#39;s office. She said that I was unqualified. She handed me a stack of papers, a report -  that report had to be 4&quot; high!!! <br/>
&quot;There - that&#39;s your daughters curriculum for this coming semester. Are you qualified to teach this?&quot; she said.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be honest, I was scared and I don&#39;t scare easy!!<br/>
 I was frightened that Brianna would end up working for minimum wage while writing, spelling and reading like a third grader. I was frightened that &quot;they&quot; would find out that I was frightened. I was frightened that I would fail, and in doing so, fail my wonderful daughter in one of the most horrible ways thinkable. <br/>
I was frightened - so I hesitated. <br/>
<br/>
Brianna pushed me. Brianna wanted to be home schooled. She talked about homeschooling; what she wanted to learn; where she would study- much as your daughter is talking to you.<br/>
Have you heard of the Ben Franklin Decision Making Graph??<br/>
Take a piece of paper <br/>
Draw a line down the center<br/>
One side is PRO<br/>
The other side is CON<br/>
<br/>
List everything.<br/>
Why should she homeschool?<br/>
What are the reasons you believe you folks should be a HS family?<br/>
<br/>
What are the reasons against it??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You aren&#39;t the worlds best speller and you say you&#39;re math dysfunctional (is that what you said??)<br/>
So what??<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; biology.<br/>
I&#39;m looking at a &quot;Rainforest Greenhouse&quot; - Brianna is growing butterflies,<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;know&quot; lots of stuff - how much of what I don&#39;t know does Brianna need to know to be a happy, well adjusted woman?<br/>
<br/>
Follow your heart, Princess Dee.<br/>
Take your wonderful daughter by the hand and step into your lives.<br/>
<br/>
Take your wonderful daughter away from the folks who are doing what they&#39;re doing for a paycheck. Take her away from the folks that won&#39;t know her next year. Take her away from the pencil pushers  that care about numbers - not lives. Take her home and both of you can learn to heal. While she&#39;s healing, while she&#39;s growing - you&#39;re going to lose your fears in the wake of such amazing joy!!<br/>
<br/>
Follow your heart.<br/>

  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] few questions<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  have a few questions  .<br/>
  first i want to say thank you. i have  spent the  3 hours  reading  <br/>
  from one link to the next on unschooling. I may have just stumbled <br/>
  on  what i have been looking for.<br/>
  We have a 12 (13 in two weeks))year old. That we have adopted last <br/>
  year.(she has lived with us for 3  1/2 years)who had sever pts. and <br/>
  adhd.she was  abused in every way and  under feed and  had been <br/>
  dionosed with reactive attachment disorder at the age of  five (we <br/>
  did not know this till she was almost 12). She has come a long long <br/>
  way and had grown  a lot as now she gets feed (she was 55 lbs and  <br/>
  wore a  6x in clouthing, when we got her and now wears a womans  6 <br/>
  tall and weighs 120.(giggle she wore a size 4 in childrens shoes then <br/>
  now a 10 in womans)she trys very very hard  and is  recently wanting <br/>
  to   frow more. she loves to learn and is determined to get past the  <br/>
  RAD (reactive attachment Disorder). her and I have both  desided we <br/>
  need to work harder on the  bonding as the theropist thinks we need <br/>
  to work  on the adhd part and  use more drug theropy.( we have tryed <br/>
  this over and overusuly makes it worse) we have agreed to try  time <br/>
  relised this may however   we have refused the if you want to give <br/>
  another to counter the first routine we wont do it)and we are both  <br/>
  asking why  is it more important to  do the  grade thing any way<br/>
  i have spent 3 years fighting the school. and trying to make them <br/>
  fallow the iep, They have  insisted that we fix the not turning in <br/>
  homework problem and fix the behavior also. The behavior is usuly  <br/>
  social problems and she is  the kid every one picks on the kids and <br/>
  teacher tell me this. Lisa  has very very poor social skills.so my <br/>
  question  this last year to them has beenyou belive i need to keep <br/>
  her in here for social reasons and what i see her learning is how to <br/>
  be a door mat and  you say she is eager to learn but you dont have <br/>
  time to teach her because she ask so many questions and  in the <br/>
  classes she has  only 3 other students  she does great even helps <br/>
  explain to others once she  has had all her questions answered. and <br/>
  she is still flunking because she dont turn in her homework and if <br/>
  she dont do the homework it is usualy because  the teaches have <br/>
  failed to expline it in small steps so she can understand. And i keep <br/>
  her in  school why? then they point out my spelling and  math  <br/>
  problem and math is one of her problems.We dont have a lot of money <br/>
  and they know it, know i could not afford to hire a bunch of tutors <br/>
  and they  said i would have to turn my home into a mini school  to <br/>
  make it work and hire  people to do it and if i didnt have the  <br/>
  money  no way i could do this. i have spent 6 mounths  looking. have <br/>
  found  that maybe they are wrong. there are lots of  places i could <br/>
  open enroll her and as close as  a 1/2 hour away there are  places <br/>
  that have  home school resorese rooms. and as for spelling  her and i <br/>
  decided together that it could be a game and we  write down words we <br/>
  spell wrong and  we keep list short  and  play a game to teach both <br/>
  of us.I stared  with telling her i think it might be a idea for us to <br/>
  do home  school stuff this summer when   u get out of school end of <br/>
  may and i expected the  school in summer thing. to my surprise she <br/>
  had ideas and  is excited about the idea and even said this is a way <br/>
  we can work on the bonding issue mom, but what about math i told her <br/>
  of the other types of school she said gee then  not every one will <br/>
  know me and maybe i could make friends?                        <br/>
    We make  biweekly trips to  junk stores usualy she hits the  <br/>
  clouthing fast last 2 times she has went to learning  area and found <br/>
  cd&#39;s  and books she would like to learn from.<br/>
    Her counsler  now says she will fall behind  and that there is not <br/>
  enough social interreaction  for her  . Her and I belive that  this <br/>
  can be handled and I think learning  low self esteem and flunking <br/>
  even though ya know the  materal is silly. The teacher dont fallow <br/>
  the iep at all  we once had it set up to sigh a paper if she had <br/>
  turned in home work and for every day she   got full day of <br/>
  signutures she got  computer time . if she didnt get them she  didnt <br/>
  and then if she missed 3 in a day she got a 1/2 hour in her roomthey <br/>
  all sighned  every day for months. then sent home a  your kid is <br/>
  flunking because she didnt turn in homework . The poor girl went into <br/>
  tears. they had told her she was doing fine and  this took us both  <br/>
  by surprise. i marched in to the school  and getting nothing but run <br/>
  around called a  iep meeting they told me they didnt have heart not <br/>
  to sighn the paper and as time went on  they  felt she handt turned  <br/>
  it in because they didnt have time to teach her in small steps and <br/>
  she was  behind/ I stoped the sighing thing told them what i was <br/>
  thinking about home school and they  told me i lacked the skills and <br/>
  that i would be doing  her a &quot;grave dis service&quot; if i did that and <br/>
  quoted both her poor social skills and  the time it would take to  do <br/>
  it. I shook my head  social skills? she is made fun of (granted <br/>
  sometimes she causes it) and has no friends (small small towns dont <br/>
  forgive and have long memorys) and as for my skills well i pionted <br/>
  out to them i took a kid they told me would neve bond and couldnt <br/>
  feel and that would end up in  instatutions the rest of her life and <br/>
  she not been in a single instution, and  now we are trying to get her <br/>
  to stop crying in school when she is made fun of.I think i keep <br/>
  hesatiting because  so many tell me i am wrong i cant do this one  <br/>
  that she will be at 7th grade level forever, if i do. except in <br/>
  reading  where she reads at level 12.I think they  dont know my kid <br/>
  and my determation. I think  ok so we both hate math and  have what <br/>
  they call a math disorder. so what  we are integelent and read well <br/>
  and she has so many questions and willness to find the answers. (oh i <br/>
  probley forgot to say this child is  related to me by blood and other <br/>
  reason they said with RAd kids bio related not a good idea asked me <br/>
  to give her to system after we found  out  after a year and a 1/2)<br/>
  So my questions are any one know if  this is bad idea for a teen Rad? <br/>
  and is it to late as she is  almost 13 to start ?if her and i choose  <br/>
  what  she does  why is that wrong? I kept saying so what she learns <br/>
  what she can or wants in  math and i dont turn my home into a mini <br/>
  school. we will find things she does want to learn. and she does want <br/>
  to learn . heck  she out and out flunking  sience and those are one <br/>
  the areas she keep picking up at the stores she wasnts to  do it on <br/>
  computer the  woman i  have do my taxes say in Iowa there is a tax <br/>
  break  and fed she says  if i keep track  what i spend for learning I <br/>
  can claim 25 hundred on taxes. I didnt know that. with that break why <br/>
  cant i hire out what she wants to learn?save 2 grand from income tax <br/>
  this year and use it and keep track?she wants to plant a flower bed <br/>
  this year want to learn about how the roots  work and wants to  read <br/>
  the books school wont  give her time to  she  reads there books and <br/>
  dont like them  and  when she dont do there  book it usualy because <br/>
  she been  reading her books.she is excited about summer school with <br/>
  mom and older sister says she will help her in oreas  and lisa is so <br/>
  excited . I however dont want a mini school setting have been looking <br/>
  for alternitives . hands on  lets learn this together ways of <br/>
  teaching.<br/>
  I stumbled on this site  when looking in yahoo groups for attacment <br/>
  disorders is there a reason it was listed here? are there others with <br/>
  a Rad child? Can someone that  has poor  math and grammer and <br/>
  spelling make this work?<br/>
  I have decided not to do spell check just to let you know how poor <br/>
  the spelling realy is. and  get advise from those that  live it. <br/>
  Thank you in advance for your advice and  I am sorry for the lenght <br/>
  of this post.<br/>

Dee,<br/>
I must have a math disorder too. I have a college degree and can&#39;t balance my checkbook. When she needs to learn some math, you can help her find the best way to learn what she needs. My daughter learned fractions mostly by baking cookies. &quot;Mini-school&quot;! Are they kidding? What on earth do they do that you would want to copy? :-p<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269392274">Yes, she was very insistent.<br/>
It was a curriculum...in a very broad sense of the word. It was more a table of contents w/ a listing of chapters and what each chapter contains and what/ how it would be taught.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up giving her a curriculum- I simply copied some of their books, added horse back riding and self defense, gardening, a couple of other things. I turned in a very &quot;good&quot; curriculum. I was turned down because I had turned in no curriculum. At the time, the only homeschoolers I knew were Christians and I was sent to HSLDA. At the time, 14 families were either applying to HS for the first time or re-applying to continue. 11 were turned down...for failing to turn in any curriculum. HSLDA represented us. As a matter of fact, we were mentioned in an article. They were very nice,  esp. since we never became members.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you can find us in an online site of HSLDA.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know biology, either.  I took science every year in high school,<br/>
but because I went to three different high schools with &quot;unaligned<br/>
curricula&quot;  (gasp!) I ended up completely missing biology.  And I stayed<br/>
away from it in college as well.<br/>

Now I think I have a really fun opportunity to learn biology for my own<br/>

I would definitely agree with you and not the counselor.  I think it&#39;s<br/>
really lame that the worst criticism they can come up with about<br/>
homeschooling is &quot;you won&#39;t be able to have 30 other kids the same age<br/>

Again, I don&#39;t agree with the school.  It sounds like, more than<br/>
anything, your daughter needs time and patience, which the school<br/>
clearly cannot provide.<br/>
<br/>
**if her and i choose  <br/>
what  she does  why is that wrong?**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it is wrong.  It&#39;s just different from what the majority<br/>
of people do.  But it&#39;s what I do with my child, too.<br/>
<br/>
**she wants to plant a flower bed <br/>
this year want to learn about how the roots  work **<br/>
<br/>
I love to garden!  It&#39;s so rewarding and there is always more that you<br/>
can learn.  &quot;Doing it&quot; is so different from just reading about it and<br/>
passing a test about it.<br/>
<br/>
**I however dont want a mini school setting have been looking <br/>
for alternitives . hands on  lets learn this together ways of <br/>
teaching.**<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;unschooling&quot; IS what you want.  To unschool, just do real<br/>
things (like gardening) and go places and watch movies and read books<br/>
and talk and think and look for answers on the internet and in the<br/>
library.  That&#39;s a richer education than any classroom experience.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-892744904">Thank you so very much . I came home from yet another  meeting with <br/>
the  counsler and  she  decided to  see me and talk about my conserns <br/>
and  try and talk me out of  homeschooling. begged me to  give the <br/>
drugs a chance and i told her i will allow her to  stay in till the <br/>
end of this year and  see if her mircle cure  drug fixes every thing <br/>
we talked about  social skills she recited  one of her other <br/>
patients  also from a small rual town after  a few years the 9 year <br/>
old was able to make friends. and that  yet another example of  one <br/>
her patients is home schooledand spends most of his time in day care <br/>
as the non wotking mother does not have the time  I told her  I am <br/>
not her and talked about bonding she told me I was  trying to bond <br/>
with a Rad that was a  Teen during the time when most  Teens pull <br/>
away from parents and was afraid I  would do damage devemently if i <br/>
didnt allow her to  pull away and that maybe I need to look at geting <br/>
another theropist and reminded me that  the bio partents didnt get  <br/>
her treatment and this is considered  neglet and to home school might <br/>
be also. I cant wait till  school is over. in  end of may think i <br/>
will get the homeschool papers  and get a diff counsler and  raise my <br/>
child the way i see fit.<br/>

&gt; to sighn the paper and as time went on  they  felt she handt <br/>
turned  <br/>
&gt; it in because they didnt have time to teach her in small steps and <br/>
&gt; she was  behind/ I stoped the sighing thing told them what i was <br/>
&gt; thinking about home school and they  told me i lacked the skills <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; that i would be doing  her a &quot;grave dis service&quot;**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Again, I don&#39;t agree with the school.  It sounds like, more than<br/>
&gt; anything, your daughter needs time and patience, which the school<br/>
&gt; clearly cannot provide.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **if her and i choose  <br/>
&gt; what  she does  why is that wrong?**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think it is wrong.  It&#39;s just different from what the <br/>
majority<br/>
&gt; of people do.  But it&#39;s what I do with my child, too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **she wants to plant a flower bed <br/>
&gt; this year want to learn about how the roots  work **<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I love to garden!  It&#39;s so rewarding and there is always more that <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; can learn.  &quot;Doing it&quot; is so different from just reading about it <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; passing a test about it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; **I however dont want a mini school setting have been looking <br/>
&gt; for alternitives . hands on  lets learn this together ways of <br/>
&gt; teaching.**<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think &quot;unschooling&quot; IS what you want.  To unschool, just do real<br/>
&gt; things (like gardening) and go places and watch movies and read <br/>
books<br/>
&gt; and talk and think and look for answers on the internet and in the<br/>
&gt; library.  That&#39;s a richer education than any classroom experience.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best wishes,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1580292788">-<br/>
Thank you so very much  but  for the next few weeks i will be working <br/>
60 to 70 hours a week and she wants to finish this year out as is <br/>
and  I told her today stop worring about the dang grades  you get <br/>
the  matreal and   we will work on  what you want to this summer. <br/>
after her counsler apt. she asked if she could go to salvation army <br/>
and get some books on plays because her teacher told her she was to <br/>
young for shakespear and  would cover it in a few years I told her  <br/>
teacher was wrong if she wanted to try  it  we will find it. she <br/>
found 2 books decided one looked  chalanging and the other was to  <br/>
young for her and got both any way and looked at me and said  you <br/>
sure mom The teacher said I repeted if she wants to try it then we <br/>
can try it together.  she then asked if she could study  <br/>
aboutchemestry and my insides panticed lol I told her if she wants <br/>
then we will study it together or find some one that could  help us. <br/>
I had some doubts again  but then rembered what I had read last <br/>
nightit was me that needed to change  my way of thinking and some how <br/>
I will build a net work and find ways to let her learn what she  <br/>
desires .if she desires.<br/>
my 18 year old and I dissused  unschooling and she was  very learie <br/>
said ya know mom  the teacher I hated the most I learned the most <br/>
from and I wouldnt had known I wanted to learn in these diff areas <br/>
had he not shown me a different way of looking at things. Then I <br/>
asked her  dont every one  you incounter have diff ways and did you  <br/>
think about how tradinal school  works for one than  maybe not <br/>
another. we talked about lisas needs and so forth she said can she go <br/>
back if she want to latter  my answer was sure  we can  try it what <br/>
she got to loose and what to gain .  she said well she wont  miss <br/>
being teased and pittied and  she will gain time with the faimly she <br/>
needs and well if she flunking any way what diff it make they   <br/>
talking about passing her  because of what she can do in class and <br/>
flunking because of homework this is dumb mom we need to get her oput <br/>
of school. she needs to learn about life  and bond closer to give her <br/>
a greater chance at life and build more self confadence. <br/>
When  we can afford it I will buy  books recomened by this group and  <br/>
as soon as I can I will fill out the paper work on home schooling. it <br/>
is time we as a family  do not fail this child and   thru this i pray <br/>
she will heal. <br/>
Thank you again for your suport,<br/>
Dee<br/>

ok now this answer just made me cry.<br/>
I think I want this as bad as she does . that some how  these people <br/>
are telling me  I would be ruing her life if i do this and yet I feel <br/>
I would be losing the greatest opertuiny she ever had or me for that <br/>
matter. one of the tings my 18 year old said was what about dances <br/>
ext. i nearly laffed  told her  well lets see the boys are setting <br/>
her up  with i like you now and then  when she reacts the ridacule <br/>
her  dances  well i see carrie in my head and say hun  not every lil <br/>
girl is prom queen and homecoming quen. it very very hard on those <br/>
that  arent.maybe when we cross that bridge there are other <br/>
homeschooled that  can advise and if that the best reason not to <br/>
then  we have no reason not to . and giggle we did the pros and cons <br/>
and   the reasons  not to dont seem like reasons they seem like <br/>
others  telling me to put a  round peg in a square  hole.the way i <br/>
feeling is ok people  if i do this and gain even just a year then i <br/>
have gained and so has she and if she ends up back in there then  has <br/>
to be behind a year  so be it. it a year you cant take from her or <br/>
me. from what i  been reading they cant forse me just the brow <br/>
beating i have been getting so far. and there reasons seen silly to <br/>
me  make her conform give her lots of drugs to do it and  lose lose <br/>
lose. i waiting for some one to tell me I am wrong . they just tell <br/>
me  she will come out of it and if i am not doing it for deep <br/>
religious reasons then there is no reason and  I keep telling them <br/>
you dont seem to understand I belive you  people are the problem.<br/>
Thank you again  for  touching my heart.<br/>

You&#39;re not talking about trying to forcibly hold this child back from her <br/>
life, you&#39;re talking about helping to build her a road into a real life, <br/>
which the school is definitely not doing for her, from your description.<br/>

You may not overcome the RAD but it sounds like you have a good chance of it. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154413710">--Giggling here in Iowa. ya sound like  I did today.said gee  I have <br/>
a 18 year old that just dont understand why other kids cant or wont <br/>
talk to there parents  she recently wrote a paper for the  local new <br/>
paper on  my hero and  realy i was suprised her hero was me she  <br/>
stated in there  it is because my mom was  always there and  never <br/>
judged me and gentaly nudged me  thru my life i go into this world <br/>
feeling loved and confedent that i can handle what ever life throw my <br/>
way. I asked the  counsler today so is my 18 year old hurt in any way <br/>
because she is attached to me and   that by no means we havent had <br/>
our problems  her answer was  some kids get it  most dont. and  that  <br/>
my 18 year old was  stright A student and  popular ext. and  my <br/>
answer  may seem dumb but  i said yea  and that means what? what i am <br/>
most proud of is her ability to love and to see thru  crap and to <br/>
stand up for her self and her insite and her inner beauty. her ways <br/>
of life this is the child who worked hard to be what she choose to be <br/>
and to be a member of a family. and  every chid is not the same and <br/>
lisa has different need.  and a 25 year old (bi-poler) that tell me <br/>
if mom ever gave up on  me and didnt always look for ways to help me. <br/>
I wonder where i would be now.she was  different than the other also <br/>
she  was board with school showed up for test and turned in home work <br/>
got stright a&#39;s and never went  we found a school that allowed her to <br/>
do that.I wish I had found or looked into home schooling with her <br/>
then. <br/>

and I took him out of school and wrapped my arms around him and held him <br/>
close.  It was one of the best things I ever did.  He&#39;ll tell you that today. <br/>

of school, get her off the drugs, and love her.  Oh, you already do, and I <br/>
can see by your posts that she loves and trusts you too.<br/>
<br/>
She may or may not ever be good at math. If you care about your own math or <br/>
spelling, you can learn that stuff in fun ways....but if she&#39;s a good reader <br/>
and cares about learning, she&#39;s going to be okay. Get her out of there and <br/>
let her play and explore and be with you and your family. <br/>

<br/>
Your messages are breaking my heart. As far as the religious thing goes, use <br/>
it! Even if it is not your premise for wanting her out, is it a <br/>
constitutional right and the bases on which many a homeschool family has won <br/>
their cases. Just say you have prayed hard on it and God has showed you this <br/>
is the road you must take. You also want her to have a stronger relationship <br/>
with the Lord because all she&#39;s getting at school is evil hateful rejection <br/>
by other children. She needs to be encompassed in love so Bye Bye. They <br/>
obviously don&#39;t get the thoery that they are the issue and drugs are not the <br/>
miracle answer to all questions. They work for some families and not for <br/>
others, but that has to remain your decision. I would also say that you <br/>
should add God to not wanting Lisa on drug therapy, because her body is not <br/>
done developing and she needs much more than a pill, she needs love and <br/>
faith, something the school by law cannot give her.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought, from a not religious person.<br/>
Take care and best wishes to you and Lisa,<br/>

And emotionally strong and healthy person can do ANYTHING and any time in <br/>

If your dd learned not one single thing more for many years, I still think <br/>
she&#39;d be far better off at home, loved, safe and nurtured.<br/>

&gt; of school, get her off the drugs, and love her.  Oh, you already do, and I <br/>
&gt; can see by your posts that she loves and trusts you too. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes!!<br/>
&gt; Your posts have been very heartfelt Dee, I feel for ya.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Why, oh why, is SO much emphasis placed on grades and academics at the risk <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; of a persons emotional health?<br/>
&gt; And emotionally strong and healthy person can do ANYTHING and any time in <br/>
&gt; their lives. It should be the pillar that all other decisions are based <br/>
&gt; on,....is this good for the persons being/soul?<br/>
&gt; THAT should be the defining factor in decisions, not all this BS that the <br/>
&gt; schools think is so important.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If your dd learned not one single thing more for many years, I still think <br/>
&gt; she&#39;d be far better off at home, loved, safe and nurtured.<br/>
&gt; And the thing of it is, she WILL learn, you can&#39;t stop it. (oh, unless you <br/>
&gt; force it and make learning a chore that is:)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, something else occurred to me. The school system is focused on <br/>
taking your presently high-needs daughter and turning her into a Useful Adult <br/>
Member of Society by the time she&#39;s 18 or so, where they will send her into <br/>
The Real World. So they&#39;ve got a bit of a time crunch here. They&#39;ve gotta get <br/>
going on this stuff, and they haven&#39;t got time to deal with this namby-pamby <br/>
emotional stuff.<br/>
<br/>
You, on the other hand, can acknowledge that your daughter&#39;s had a hard life, <br/>
and that there&#39;s no earthly reason why she&#39;s gotta be ready to go when she&#39;s <br/>
18. You&#39;re in this for the long haul. So if you focus on her feelings and <br/>
happiness exclusively for a bit, even if she didn&#39;t learn ANYTHING ELSE <br/>
(which, of course, we all know is BS), she&#39;d still be ahead of the game.<br/>
<br/>
So, it&#39;s not really that the school is evil or anything...they&#39;re just <br/>
task-oriented. You can be kid-oriented.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-195169887">I started talking about home schooling on another list i am on for  parents of <br/>
Rad children and  saw some one else on yet another list asking about it seems I <br/>
don&#39;t have the only rad that wants to be home schooled and seems that others <br/>
are having the same problems and  I can tell you I am so very very happy to <br/>
have found you all . my child and I both are looking forward to more time <br/>
together. you are right of coarse they have told me look she has this many <br/>
years to learn and we don&#39;t want her to fall behind. my answer is  i have this <br/>
many years before I have a child leaves the nest not understanding  how life <br/>
can be happy and full of self esteem and hope for her future. I was told i was <br/>
being simplistic. if I am oh well. lol<br/>

smiled.  I then asked her, &quot;Jamie, what does I love you mean?&quot;<br/>
and she said, without  missing a beat, &quot;You want to live with someone <br/>
forever.&quot;  I can&#39;t think of a better definition.  We wont always live <br/>
under the same roof (probably), but we will always &quot;live&quot; with each <br/>
other forever.<br/>
