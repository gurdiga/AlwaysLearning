&lt;&lt; Have you heard the Hardware Store song?  He lists at a very fast pace <br/>
<br/>
all the things you can find in a hardware store.  It&#39;s great. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s on the new CD, Poodle Hat.<br/>
<br/>
They didn&#39;t do that last night.  I think it&#39;s a studio-only situation, same <br/>
as &quot;Everything you Know is Wrong.&quot;  I think it&#39;s two tracks and he stops a line <br/>
to breathe, and the final is both sets of every other line, put together to <br/>
seem he could go 90 seconds without breathing.  Though I will say he&#39;s got a <br/>
TON of stamina and strength, and dances and jumps and sings and acts for nearly <br/>
two hours straight.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She&#39;s trying to master that one.  Very difficult.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s doable.  I know the words to &quot;Everything You Know is <br/>
Wrong,&quot; but it can&#39;t really be sung.  Not by me, anyway, and I don&#39;t think by Al <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I love Omish Paradise. (sung to Gangters Paradise).&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Amish. &lt;g&gt; He did that last night.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And the Emminem one about watching TV til your brain turns to mush is <br/>
<br/>
really funny.&gt;&gt; <br/>
<br/>
He did that too, after an &quot;Al TV&quot; video interview with Emminem.  He had <br/>
several of those:  Avril Lavigne,  Justin Timberlake, Celine Dion.  It would be <br/>
clips of them answering questions from interviews, or saying something inane, <br/>
intercut with him asking questions to SEEM they were responding to him.  <br/>
HILARIOUS.  So with Emminem, he had lots of statements about artistic freedom, and <br/>
then said &quot;So you think someone should be able to do a parody of a video?&quot;  and <br/>
like that, then came out and did the song.<br/>
<br/>
They have videos on big screens (and some nice smaller TVs between the <br/>
speakers and the audience, for anyone who can&#39;t see well) to cover for costume <br/>
changes, of which there were many.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;He came to our area about 5 years ago, but we weren&#39;t into him at the <br/>
<br/>
time.  I hope he comes back soon!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
His shows are definitely worth seeing.<br/>
