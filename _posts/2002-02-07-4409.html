 </span></blockquote>I am amazed whenever I see an article in a magazine<br/>
about making your furniture look old and worn.  Huh? <br/>
Just buy old stuff!  LOL  I am not surprised about<br/>
people in the bay area paying a lot of money for new<br/>
furniture made to look old.  They pay a lot of money<br/>
for EVERYTHING, housing, parking, food.  <br/>
<br/>
About the only thing in San Francisco that is NOT<br/>
really expensive is good ethnic resturant food.  You<br/>
can find expensive places, sure, but the quality at<br/>
cheapo mom and pop places is inceredible.  There is<br/>
too much competition for high prices.  Growing up<br/>
there really spoiled me about eating out.  I still<br/>
love to eat out, but am slowly learning (through<br/>
disillusionment) that most places are just not worth<br/>
the money.  I can make better food at home.  I can<br/>
find cheaper distressed furniture at swap meets, flea<br/>
markets and second hand stores too....<br/>
