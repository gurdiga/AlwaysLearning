&gt; Then I would have felt I was manipulating his choices by not<br/>
&gt; presenting to him any options that &#39;I&#39; thought too schooly.  I tell<br/>
&gt; the boys about all kinds of things which they show interest in or<br/>
&gt; not.  Do you limit what you tell your kids about by what you want them<br/>
&gt; to do, or let them look at all the options or information and make<br/>
&gt; their own choices?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are millions of things in the world and I don&#39;t tell my kids about all <br/>
of them. That is not the same as not letting them look at &quot;all the options.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If a parent asks whether a child wants to go to school or stay home, is the <br/>
parent obligated to describe every possible school, affordable or not, near or <br/>
not?   <br/>
<br/>
If you didn&#39;t think the program was a good match for unschooling or the <br/>
child, then describing and explaining until he could understand even though he <br/>
didn&#39;t understand it goes beyond telling him about it, I think.   It sounded like <br/>
pressure to participate, from your description, and it seemed you were <br/>
frustrated, and he was frustrated, so that&#39;s why I pointed out that not mentioning it <br/>
might&#39;ve been a good option.<br/>
