<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805546815">Hi Alyce,<br/>
I lived in Las Vegas for the past three years, until recently moving an hour north to a ranch (we are still in Clark County as Vegas is). There are some Unschoolers, and I belong to a group called the Melting Pot and joined three years ago. It is an all inclusive group of many different types of homeschoolers, but there are some unschoolers as well. You can join the loop to get a feel for how they are:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:homeschoolmeltingpot@yahoogroups.com">homeschoolmeltingpot@yahoogroups.com</a> There are many, many activities, classes, playgroups, you can look at the calendar at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hsmplv.tripod.com/">http://hsmplv.tripod.com/</a> . There are many other groups in Vegas for different religions, and the newest group <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:freespirithomeschoolers@yahoogroups.com">freespirithomeschoolers@yahoogroups.com</a> is a totally secular group of homeschoolers who do not belong to any organized religion.  <br/>
Homeschooling in Vegas is easy and the numbers of homeschoolers are fairly large and growing each day!<br/>
As for living in Vegas, away from the strip there are some beautiful communities. If you are looking for brand new expensive homes look in the NW (summerlin) area, if you are looking for a brand new, not as expensive, but still large home look to North Las Vegas. My girlfriend bought a new 3800 sq foot home two years ago for 220,000. It is beautiful! The same new home in Summerlin would come with a high association payment each month, but gates and police guarding the many parks. Honestly, they are not needed in these areas. You will be 20 - 25 minutes away from the strip. The landscaping is beautiful in these areas, the parks unbelievable with pools and waterparks, skateboard parks, doggie parks and community centers with much to offer! I lived in the NW area very near Summerlin without the summerlin expense (the lakes) and it was touted as the safest place in Vegas to live. <br/>
<br/>
So, why did we move? I love the country and we have longed for it since leaving our Ranch in CA 6 years ago. We have 3 acres and room to breath, have horses, chickens big dogs and what ever else strikes our fancy! I do admit we gave up many conveniences leaving the city, but this is our lifestyle. Vegas offers a ton for families these days and is very homeschooling friendly! <br/>
Please let me know if I can answer any more questions!<br/>

  Hi all - Is anyone on this list from or living in Las Vegas?  We&#39;re<br/>
  loosely considering a move and I could really use some input from a<br/>
