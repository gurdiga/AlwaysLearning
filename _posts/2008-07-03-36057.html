<div id="ygrps-yiv-527445220">I&#39;d love to hear from those of you who successfully homeschool more than 2<br/>
children and also work at home. <br/>
<br/>
I have four daughters and will likely be homeschooling the youngest three.<br/>
I have been running a part-time childcare program three days per week out of<br/>
my home. I also write and publish a monthly program for providers and<br/>
homeschoolers.  I am considering stopping the childcare but will definitely<br/>
continue the writing. I worry that I will be taking on too much and I do not<br/>
want the girls to feel like I am not focused on them or their schooling.<br/>

I look forward to hearing any pearls of wisdom.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right.  It&#39;s possible that those who are working and  <br/>
unschooling would have ideas for someone working and homeschooling  <br/>
more formally.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s worth leaving it to see, but it&#39;s also worth the reminder that  <br/>
the discussion should lean toward unschooling and not toward  <br/>
curriculum-talk.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-119102096">I can describe a bit how my unschooling WAHD action goes, with a 3yr old & a<br/>
5 yr old:<br/>
<br/>
1) Realize that getting more than 4 hours of actual work done is near<br/>
impossible<br/>
2) Being requested to come see something or read a book is to be expected,<br/>
at least twice an hour at minimum<br/>
3) If the kids are asleep or engaged in an activity, get as much work done<br/>
as possible!<br/>
4) Count my blessings that my wonderful wife helps to engage the kids and<br/>
allow me to work<br/>

&gt; children and also work at home.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just had my third child 2 weeks ago so I&#39;m a little shy of your<br/>
requirement. But I have six year old and three year old boys...<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have four daughters and will likely be homeschooling the youngest three.<br/>
&gt; I have been running a part-time childcare program three days per week out<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; my home. I also write and publish a monthly program for providers and<br/>
&gt; homeschoolers.  I am considering stopping the childcare but will definitely<br/>
&gt; continue the writing. I worry that I will be taking on too much and I do<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; want the girls to feel like I am not focused on them or their schooling.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I look forward to hearing any pearls of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ha! don&#39;t know if I have pearls, but here are some tips. These are from many<br/>
of my coworkers as well. I work for Sun Microsystems, which has an<br/>
aggressive work-from-home policy. Veeeeeeeeery family friendly, I totally<br/>
love it. Also, my DH is a SAHD so that changes the dynamic a bit from where<br/>
you are. But here we go...<br/>
<br/>
* Show the kids what you&#39;re doing, how you&#39;re doing it, and why you&#39;re doing<br/>
it. Let them sit on your lap or around you while you type, read what you&#39;re<br/>
writing to them, explain what you&#39;re thinking, ask them for their thoughts.<br/>
My kids now know about Java programming, about Duke the Java mascot, and<br/>
about Sun&#39;s dismal stock price (although they have no idea what that means,<br/>
only that today&#39;s number is smaller and we wish it were bigger...)<br/>
<br/>
* If you have the option, set it up so they can &quot;work&quot; while you work. The<br/>
boys have their own laptop which we are helping them learn to navigate. Most<br/>
of the time they watch videos while I work, if they&#39;re in the room with me.<br/>
But sometimes Rowan will ask for a blank sheet in a word processor<br/>
(OpenOffice) and type while I type. Lots of great opportunities there.<br/>
<br/>
* For times when you need to focus... wear a badge. My kids know that when<br/>
the badge is on, I really have to focus, that it will be for a very short<br/>
time, and that I am available to them right after. I try to plan ahead and<br/>
doublecheck that they are involved in something entertaining (coloring, leap<br/>
pad, computer, playdough) and have eaten or have food available before I go<br/>
turtle.<br/>
<br/>
* They know that a headset means I&#39;m in a meeting. We&#39;ve played with the<br/>
headset for calling Grandma, played with the mute button, etc. They know<br/>
they can come in and cuddle or whatever, but that they have to be really<br/>
quiet. It&#39;s almost a game to them.<br/>
<br/>
* Jason tends to take them out to the park or whatever when I have big<br/>
projects and big deadlines. If I don&#39;t, they do whatever they do. If they&#39;ve<br/>
got awesome plans, I move my work schedule around and go with.<br/>
<br/>
* I have gotten really used to working in 10 minute focused bursts with<br/>
stories, snacks, and whatnot inbetween.<br/>
<br/>
HTH!<br/>
