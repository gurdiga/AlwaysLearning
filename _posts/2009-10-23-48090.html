<div id="ygrps-yiv-978540918">I just got a happy e-mail that I&#39;m sure the author didn&#39;t know would  <br/>

those of you who sent suggestions and photos for the monkey platters  <br/>
page are too.<br/>

The mom told me she had just discovered monkey platters and she and  <br/>
her kids loved them.  She was so excited she blogged about it!<br/>
<br/>
I read the blog post and there&#39;s a photo, even, and yet I&#39;m hesitant  <br/>
to link it on the monkey platter page. I don&#39;t want to frustrate her.   <br/>

I hope you&#39;ll like some other parts of my site too.  Much of your blog  <br/>

homeschool that pretty much eliminate both of those.<br/>

She&#39;s using the monkey platters to keep her kids at the table for  <br/>
schoolwork, and limiting the food.  Well...  Still, it&#39;s better than  <br/>
the situation before that (for her, maybe not for the girls! &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

you do write.  Maybe she&#39;ll read the links I sent and soften up some.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2130878328">I can understand why it would distress you. She&#39;s using monkey platters as a means to keeping butts on seats. I&#39;m sure more people than Crazy in Alaska take away a moment&#39;s idea from your wonderful labyrinth of a website and ignore the hours and days of ideas that could also make their lives and their children&#39;s lives better. Because of your easily accessible webpage her children are getting in less trouble with their mom. That&#39;s a good thing. Because of a tool you made available, the mom is looking to solutions outside of shouting and time outs and contracts, or at least so many contracts, for any behavioural problems she may feel her daughters are exhibiting. That&#39;s a really good thing. Maybe looking once outside the behaviour she&#39;ll look again later. Maybe she&#39;ll open her mind even more. She knows where your site is now, maybe she&#39;ll come back looking for more ideas over time. <br/>
<br/>
I would let this one slide off your back a little. 20 minutes of agitation may be more than it is worth. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-891165188">I find that a lot of people do what this blogger did - they pick up a little<br/>
bit that they integrate into their lives. It&#39;s not a bad thing - if she has<br/>
success with monkey platters, she may revisit your site for more &quot;cute<br/>
ideas&quot; and become interested in your other writing. Monkey platters may be<br/>
the thin edge of the wedge for that mom&#39;s understanding, or it may just make<br/>
those kids lives more pleasant in a small way.<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Because of a tool you made available, the mom is looking to solutions<br/>
outside of shouting and time outs and contracts, or at least so many<br/>
contracts, for any behavioral problems she may feel her daughters are<br/>
exhibiting. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There was an article in the NYT a few days ago about parents shouting.<br/>
For Some Parents, Shouting Is the New<br/>
Spanking&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/fashion/22yell.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=parents%20shouting&st=cse%3E">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/22/fashion/22yell.html?_r=1&scp=1&sq=parents%20shouting&st=cse%3E</a>&gt;I<br/>
have a friend who&#39;s a child therapist, and she occasionally implies<br/>
that<br/>
I&#39;m &quot;repressed&quot; because I don&#39;t shout at my children or create a lot of<br/>
drama. At first I was offended, but then I noticed that when she makes<br/>
comments like that, it usually means she&#39;s recently yelled at her kids.<br/>

I&#39;m sure you&#39;re right.<br/>
<br/>
We have problematical neighbors behind us.  There are elderly  <br/>
grandparents (or one grandparent maybe now) and for a while one of  <br/>
their grown sons, his several sons who grew to teens and started  <br/>
having live-in girlfriends and their offspring, it seemed, were  <br/>
violent and loud and awful.  They were selling drugs out the back  <br/>
corner of their yard (one or two of the teens), which is also the back  <br/>
corner of our yard.  The police were there a lot.<br/>
<br/>
They were evicted.  Not the grandparent owners, but finally after many  <br/>
years the rest of them were scattered and told they couldn&#39;t live  <br/>
there.  A daughter came, the sister of the man who was there before.   <br/>
She talked to Holly, was very apologetic about her awful other  <br/>
relatives, and told Holly to feel free to call the police if she ever  <br/>
saw any of the nephews/cousins/others from the last batch.<br/>
<br/>
The house is way cleaner, they planted some garden, they cleaned out  <br/>
the swimming pool which had become kind of a dump and rat den.   <br/>
They&#39;ve had garage sales and moved a junker car away.<br/>
<br/>
She yells.  LOUDLY.<br/>
She yells long.  At her husband/partner, and at a kid who&#39;s there.  So  <br/>
the male people yell at the dog (a pitbull puppy, natch).<br/>
Yell, harangue, LOUD, shame, yell, &quot;YOU NEVER...&quot; and &quot;YOU ALWAYS...&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;WHY DON&#39;T YOU...&quot; and &quot;I HAVE TO...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t called the police, because yelling &quot;I&#39;ll kill you&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll  <br/>
hit you&quot; is illegal, but yelling that someone else is stupid and lazy  <br/>
and a screw-up isn&#39;t yet illegal, I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
She can go on at the same volume for like ten or fifteen minutes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563646075">Dear son William is turning six on the second of November and does not have many friends. <br/>
We are pretty isolated, having moved recently to Stansted Mountfitchett, near Bishop Stortford, in the uk and i was wondering how I could make his birthday &#39;&#39;memorable&#39;&#39; without a birthday party full of people ? I must admit that the idea of a intimate birthday with just us is a warm thought but i keep thinking about it wondering how to make it special.The first year of his life I had made a &#39;&#39;pièce montée&#39;&#39; (tall cake) and partied with his friends in South Africa, the second year was similiar and since then we have had no birthday party. Inviting a few friends that we know is possible but i am afraid they might not come and William might be desappointed because they live quite far. I also am afraid to ask them as they are without car for most of them.<br/>
My concern is that i want to make a beautiful house, decor, cake and mini fête or even a party, but the date is coming and I am not sure to get everything done; while nursing William and his sister Julia and I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.<br/>
If other families could share their expertise with me it would be great :-))<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1434957971">Maybe a child would want to visit friends for his birthday and if the  <br/>
other mom&#39;s willing, they could have the party at her house.  So the  <br/>
travel obligation falls on the birthdaying mom, not the &quot;guest mom,&quot;  <br/>
and she can be at the party without needing to drive.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe for an only or isolated child a good celebration could be going  <br/>
to another town to go to a movie (or two!) and dinner at a kid- <br/>
interesting place (Casa Bonita, in Denver, for example), or maybe a  <br/>
museum or a musical or an amusement park (harder in January) or big  <br/>
indoor play place or just somewhere (even in your own town) to stay at  <br/>
a hotel with an indoor pool.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised and impressed the last time I was in Minnesota.  Holly  <br/>
and I stayed in two different hotels, neither very expensive at all,  <br/>
but they had kitchens with microwaves, stoves, ovens, pans and dishes  <br/>
and a dishwasher.  They were set up to really, truly cook!!  And  <br/>
indoor pools and indoor gathering places with trees.   So that&#39;s a  <br/>
January possibility.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, three hotels.  One didn&#39;t have a kitchen, but it had an indoor  <br/>
water park.  That one was in Duluth.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a hotel in Albuquerque that&#39;s slowly (TOO slowly) creating an  <br/>
indoor water park.  They&#39;re taking forever.  It was to  have been one  <br/>
of the activities for my &quot;coming soon&quot; Monkey Platter festival.  We&#39;ll  <br/>
settle for a pool party, but someday...<br/>

<br/>
Though he may not be the kind of kid who enjoys big parties, you can  <br/>
make his day extra-special for him, on his terms. You still could have  <br/>
a celebration in July - make it his &quot;half-birthday.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seeing Jesse as a person whose needs are different from your  <br/>
daughter&#39;s means you can find what is dear to him and do it. Maybe  <br/>
it&#39;s a day playing golf with his family. Maybe it&#39;s a concert  <br/>
featuring his favorite artist. There are *so* many possibilities other  <br/>
than a party.<br/>
<br/>
It would help not to label your son with &quot;antisocial.&quot; It shuts down  <br/>
all sorts of possibilities for who he might become.<br/>

You could take him to his favorite restaurant and then on a fun shopping adventure to pick out his birthday gift, or you could plan an all day outing of biking and picnicing, or take him somewhere to do something he&#39;s never done before, like ice skating or archery, or some other thing that he&#39;s seen or heard of but never tried.  <br/>

I had to get over thinking in terms of big party with lots of friends and start thinking about a special day just for the birthday person.<br/>

When I was growing up, school &#39;&#39;friends&#39;&#39; in primary school were used to very special parties, in large homes, unlike our tiny appartment in old Paris.I grew up thinking it was me whom was not popular but looking back it was more likely the area was populated with a different kind of crowd.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Back in my early school-at-home days, I did something similar.  I needed to keep the kids interested in staying at the table to do all their worksheets, so I purposefully told them to stay in their pjs, gave them a drink, and made up silly names for myself as their teacher.  I&#39;d adopt another persona so they didn&#39;t see me as &#39;mom&#39; but rather as &#39;teacher&#39;.  I wouldn&#39;t let them eat during school-time because it was too distracting.  Instead, I used food as a reward for completing their work.  I felt it was so different from traditional school and thought it was great homeschooling. Schools use gold stars, stickers, recess, and all kinds of little rewards for good behavior.  I wish I had made that connection at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Bribery is thought of as bad.  Rewards are good.  In this situation, is there a difference between the two?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823581984">-=-Bribery is thought of as bad. Rewards are good. In this situation,  <br/>
is there a difference between the two?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Bribery can be a crime, and the word has a bad connotation.<br/>
<br/>
Withholding food as punishment or providing food as reward is the way  <br/>
they trained lab rats in the 1970&#39;s when operant conditioning was all  <br/>
the rage (as on Lost, with the bear cages).   Because we&#39;re hoping our  <br/>
children grow up and become adults and parents (unlike those bar- <br/>
pressing trained rats, which moved on to some other lab after the  <br/>
psych 102 students had circussed them up some), creating issues about  <br/>
food is a Bad Idea. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of what people call &quot;bribery&quot; is absolutely normal and sensible  <br/>
behavior.  If I want Marty to drive me somewhere because my leg is  <br/>
hurt, I&#39;ll offer to take him to lunch, or to make a dinner he  <br/>
especially likes.   If one of you gave me a ride somewhere, I would  <br/>
probably offer to pay for gasoline.  I don&#39;t see that as bribery.<br/>

was fantastic, she loved it.  We stayed overnight the night before her<br/>

at Red Lobster (she wanted seafood).  That night at home we carved pumpkins<br/>
and had a cake.<br/>

kinda drifted away from the friends he has had.  Interestingly, most of them<br/>
have ended up back in school.  Anyway, he has become passionate about<br/>
speedcubing over the last 6 months.  So for his birthday we planned a<br/>
rubik&#39;s cube meetup in Phoenix.  We live in Tucson so its about a 2 hr<br/>
drive, but we haven&#39;t found any &quot;cubers&quot; in Tucson yet.  We made a rubik&#39;s<br/>
cube birthday cake.  It turned out very cool (but was hugely time<br/>
consuming).  Only a couple people ended up coming to the meetup, but it<br/>
didn&#39;t matter.  They still had a blast solving rubik&#39;s cubes for several<br/>
hours.<br/>

That&#39;s one reason I stopped focusing on having a big bash and doing something that is more about the individual child and what might feel special to them.  I&#39;ve met families that only do family parties for religious reasons, no presents, no big hoo haa, maybe a special meal as acknowledgement.  <br/>

It&#39;s about what your family creates for special moments that your kids will remember, not necessarily what you think they will be missing based on a preconceived notion of what you think it should be. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-720619698">Most of our kids&#39; birthdays involved parties.  It helped that they  <br/>
shared friends pretty much.  And there were some adults who would come  <br/>
(godparents and my regular friends of the season like SCA students, or  <br/>
parents of their friends).    Still, sometimes one of them (Holly  <br/>
usually) would opt for a day with a friend instead.  And a couple of  <br/>
times Holly was the chosen friend for another kid&#39;s birthday, and they  <br/>
would spend the day at the mall or at Cliff&#39;s Amusement Park.<br/>

parties, and people came. Granted, christmas eve is not a good party  <br/>
night, but to say that NO ONE, not one person, not ever, wants to go  <br/>
to a party during the holidays, is flat out wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Then you say that that even if you held a party another time of the  <br/>
year, who would you invite?<br/>
<br/>
A better question is: Who would HE invite? maybe one  person? maybe  <br/>
his guitar teacher? maybe you could offer to host a dinner with any 3  <br/>
people (or more) he want to invite and it could be any meal he wants.  <br/>
maybe hed invite a teacher, a friend and a relative? maybe hed want  <br/>
to help plan the menu? maybe you could take him for a golf lesson at  <br/>
a special place with a pro or maybe ask HIM what his fantasy birthday  <br/>
would be like and find a way to make it happen or a version of that  <br/>
happen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1648555398">When i was a kid, my parents planned a special day for the birthday child. It could be a party if we wanted, but more often it was an outing of our choosing that we all would participate in (a hike, apple picking, trip to a museum, favorite restaurant...) and would include some fun extras, like a stop at a favorite bakery on the way or at a great look out point off the road.  If we wanted to, we could invite a friend or two. This special day could happen any time near the birthday day -- it needn&#39;t fall of the day itself, which made scheduling easier.  On our actual birthday day, we could choose our favorite meal for dinner and would open family presents. Birthdays always felt special and fun, and truly reflected who we each were at any given time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-835859086">and don&#39;t stop just because your child is a teen ;)  I remember being sooooooo disappointed when I was a teen and I came home from school and my mom had decided I was old enough (14 or 15?) to not have to have a celebration / recognition  - no &quot;Happy Birthday&quot; ;(  she was a stay at home farm wife - she could have baked a cake or fixed my favorite supper.  I kept waiting for her to say something but she never did, so when I finally dropped a huge hint she made light of it.<br/>
<br/>
We do special things for each other on our birthdays.  Not grandious but special in some way - this year for me it was a musical card with a certain song that had a special memory connection to it for us.<br/>
<br/>
We have had a couple of parties here at the house for Zac but mostly it is a family affair.<br/>
