Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Allyson<br/>

Audio books on tape that may address a new perspective.  Free from the<br/>
library.  She can listen to them at her leisure.  This is a technique that<br/>
worked for my partner.  It also gives us something to talk about.  Sometimes<br/>
a plain old good novel that has a subject matter of life&#39;s challenges or<br/>
struggles can help too.<br/>
