<div id="ygrps-yiv-1924064030"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;The homeschool Zoo Academy is coming up in<br/>
&gt; February, which he is incredibly excited about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Karen, is there a lot of writing planned for his day at the Zoo Academy? Do<br/>
you get to know in advance what the schedule is like?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He didn&#39;t even register what a<br/>
&gt; sentence was (but I know he knows it in another context).  He picked up<br/>
&gt; the fill in the blanks thing and answered all the questions correctly.<br/>
&gt;  (big whoop)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, most of that stuff - stuff schools spend a LONG time teaching (ie. how<br/>
to fill in the circle completely for that multiple choice question,<br/>
&quot;test-taking&quot; skills) - the kids I know pick it up quickly. It&#39;s not a<br/>
content question they don&#39;t know, it&#39;s simply the way it&#39;s posed to them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;And as soon as I told him he could type the sentences, he<br/>
&gt; was eager to do them.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which I think would be totally impressive to them. Although, they may think<br/>
*you* did it for him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It took him a long time to do one set of<br/>
&gt; sentences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It takes me a long time too!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (Of course, he wrote one sentence for each word and plans to<br/>
&gt; write a second set with each word, which is what a person in school<br/>
&gt; would know is the &quot;wrong&quot; way.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he&#39;s typing them, you can just show him how to group the sentences<br/>
together - two sentences for each vocab word. Right? Or am I doing it the<br/>
wrong way too?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Some of his sentences do not make sense<br/>
&gt; (ie., A bat is echolocation.--he learned how to do the &quot;underline the<br/>
&gt; vocabulary word&quot; part on the computer.  lol.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But he wanted to let them know he knew about echolocation! I&#39;m sure there<br/>
will be others that don&#39;t have the sentences done perfectly. Think of that<br/>
ole bell curve. Are at least half of his sentences done ok? Then it&#39;s<br/>
probably fine. At least they&#39;ll know he did it. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Anyway, I&#39;m trying to figure out a way to let him know that there is a<br/>
&gt; chance his sentences will not fit their mold, will be odd to them--you<br/>
&gt; folks know what I mean...I&#39;m afraid someone will say something to him<br/>
&gt; about his abilities (I&#39;m afraid it will be another homeschooler, too.<br/>
&gt; :P).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Bummer that it would be a homeschooler. :-(<br/>
My kids are pretty aware that this grammar/writing thing is not their<br/>
strength right now. We talk about it. They don&#39;t want to put a lot of time<br/>
into rectifying it, so they live with it. They know, otoh, that the<br/>
information *is* their strength. They know that they know TONS about<br/>
animals. That&#39;s what I&#39;d remind Will. He may not be great at writing it all<br/>
out, but *he knows about animals!* I&#39;m not sure what the goal is for going<br/>
to the zoo academy, but I&#39;d imagine getting hands on experience with the<br/>
animals is the biggie. And regardless of his writing skills, he&#39;ll get to do<br/>
that. I&#39;d emphasize that with him.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My<br/>
&gt; natural reaction is to volunteer for the class (they only allow two<br/>
&gt; parents), and he wants me there.  I could run interference for him if I<br/>
&gt; were there.  But I didn&#39;t get a volunteer form with my registration (I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; calling tomorrow to volunteer, of course.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would do this too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He&#39;s a responsive kid and I can see that he could fall either way on<br/>
&gt; this issue.  There has already been some frustration with the writing<br/>
&gt; and the sentences.  Either the week will cause him to get completely<br/>
&gt; frustrated, or it could be a spark that leads him into his next phase of<br/>
&gt; literacy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe. Nevertheless, he&#39;ll have fun with the animals!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Why don&#39;t you do it for him?  The &quot;rules&quot; about not helping and not <br/>
&gt; cheating<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t apply to unschoolers.  If there&#39;s no grade and no competition, <br/>
&gt; IF the<br/>
&gt; zoo thinks they need sentences (WE know they don&#39;t, and THEY think <br/>
&gt; they&#39;re<br/>
&gt; testing the kids&#39; abilities to... to do what?  Schoolwork!?) then give <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; zoo some sentences.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand what you&#39;re saying, and that&#39;s exactly what we did last <br/>
year when he was an newborn reader (I read everything to him if he <br/>
needed it).  There wasn&#39;t a whole lot of writing though...lots of <br/>
coloring pages and cutting.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll be happy with me doing <br/>
the sentences for him, now that he&#39;s begun it.  He wants to do it and I <br/>
don&#39;t stand in his way in anything, and I just ask him if he wants me to <br/>
show him tips on what he&#39;s attempting and never criticise it or grade it <br/>
or anything like that.  <br/>
<br/>
I think this is about me witnessing him losing his innoncence of all <br/>
things schooly, and I&#39;m JUST NOT READY!  It&#39;s bad enough that the boy <br/>
next door is a &quot;star&quot; student at his school and fills Will&#39;s head with <br/>
stuff about it, and because the boy is highly intelligent and likes to <br/>
read, etc., Will is very attracted by what he says.  :P  I just see this <br/>
Zoo thing could go either way--he could love it, or hate it.  I&#39;m trying <br/>
to make sure he loves it.  <br/>

the animals and touch them and stuff.  There was a lot of seatwork last <br/>
year, but it was mostly for crowd control purposes.  No writing, though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh no, that&#39;s the &quot;right&quot; way!  He printed out the first set and then he <br/>
was going to do the other set on a second sheet.  Now that I think about <br/>
it, my other son, who was in school at this age, was always doing stuff <br/>
like that.  If someone can fit this into a &quot;learning style&quot; or <br/>
&quot;intelligence&quot; thing I&#39;d sure like to know.  I need a hook to hang it on.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah, but there is something interesting in this whole deal.  Something <br/>
schooly he hasn&#39;t learned yet.  Two sets of directions on the page, <br/>
activity 1 and 2.  I&#39;m holding the paper up and he keys in on activity <br/>
2, the fill in the blank one.  All the clues are such:  A mammal which <br/>
is spotted.  [blank].  He does activity 2 first and enjoys it.  I help <br/>
him spell porcupine  Then we talked about activity 1, which is the <br/>
sentences...and he really thought that all his sentences should start <br/>
like the clues in activity 2. He wrote them all like the bat one.  It&#39;s <br/>
like he doesn&#39;t realize that the two activities are unrelated.  Maybe <br/>
that&#39;s a good thing?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right of course, but he is really into this activity and feels he <br/>
*should* do it. Like he would be breaking the rules if he didn&#39;t. <br/>
 Oooooooh, *that&#39;s* what I don&#39;t like about all this!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a little boy in our Campfire club who is special needs, but <br/>
extremely intelligent, probably a genius.  We were painting picture <br/>
frames and he kept asking me, &quot;Can I paint here?&quot;  &quot;Can I paint this <br/>
side?&quot;.  He asked me and asked me (which is one of his special traits) <br/>
and I realized he needed &quot;permission&quot; to go ahead and be creative.  So I <br/>
finally stopped and held up his picture frame and showed him every <br/>
portion that he was &quot;allowed&quot; to paint, which of course, was every <br/>
portion of the frame, and I showed which colors he could use, which of <br/>
course, was every color.  He went happily on his way.  I understand that <br/>
Connor needs some kind of special handling, and that this is probably <br/>
more normal than not for a kid in school, but I don&#39;t want Will to have <br/>
even an *inkling* of that.  <br/>
<br/>
Okay, I feel all pepped up, listened to, and understood right now. <br/>
 Thanks for helping!  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, yeah, Quinn is the same way. I would do all the things suggested so far. <br/>
I&#39;d tell him how the zoo wants the sentences - and I&#39;d probably say something <br/>
like: &quot; you know how in school there is only one right way to do <br/>
something.....&quot; But maybe first you could call and ask what it will really be <br/>
like when he goes. When we sent pre-show materials with our theater company, <br/>
they were kinda like that (a little more fun, I hope). And I would volunteer, <br/>
and I would let him opt out if it wasn&#39;t going well.<br/>
<br/>
Are you pepped now?<br/>

Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
Two years after Nick came home from second grade (it had taken him 18 months <br/>
to recover) -- he signed up for a NASA space camp.  We&#39;d thought NASA-type <br/>
people would be there to run it, but no -- they provided the syllabus and the <br/>
local elementary school librarian took charge.<br/>
<br/>
The first day -- while parents and children were milling about in the hallway <br/>
-- she stalked in, put hands on hips, shrieked at the children, &quot;Be quiet and <br/>
get in line!&quot;  Then she looked with knowing amusement at the parents and <br/>
said, &quot;Got to take charge right away!&quot;  Uh huh.  She termed herself, <br/>
&quot;Captain&quot; and did indeed order the kids through each activity.  Nick lasted <br/>
two days.  If there&#39;d been materials with which he was unfamiliar, he might <br/>
have stuck it out longer, but as it was, he knew the material, and was <br/>
unhappy with the whole &quot;I&#39;m large and in charge&quot; attitude.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the Zoo Academy is much different.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Sharon.  I think it will be.  All the educators at the zoo are <br/>
much younger than me, most with no children.  I can talk circles around <br/>
them and deflect them before they even know what happened.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
And I let my 17 yo opt out of public high school again so he could go <br/>
back to college...I guess Zoo Academy won&#39;t be any trouble.  lol.<br/>
