<div id="ygrps-yiv-646007547">ah,here&#39;s another one for you all. I know we talked about running<br/>
around naked inside/outside but how about our son (6yo.) touching<br/>
himself all day. I told him that&#39;s his private parts and he should do<br/>
that when he&#39;s alone. It doesn&#39;t bother me when he does it in the<br/>
house, it really bothers DH. DH says i gotta put some clothes on him<br/>
so he wont do that all the time. Well...he does it with his clothes on<br/>
too. DH took him to the playground today and he son our son was doing<br/>
it there and some girls were looking at him,pointing and laughing. Our<br/>
son is so stubborn about this. He&#39;s very animated doing it in the<br/>
house,flipping it,bending it when he talking to us. Is this a guy<br/>
thing that they all do?<br/>
thanks again<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys did it when they were young.<br/>
<br/>
My advice for your son is to talk to him about it as you would about  <br/>
eating boogers or scratching his ass.   if he chooses to do that  <br/>
where nobody else sees or knows, it&#39;s his private business, but it&#39;s  <br/>
not to be done in front of ANYbody else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I were with him in public and he did it I would say &quot;stop,&quot; and  <br/>
just mean it.<br/>
<br/>
If he didn&#39;t stop I&#39;d say &quot;Hey,  it&#39;s time to go eat (or something  <br/>
real)&quot; and get him out of there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to mention is that at some point it becomes illegal.   <br/>
If an adult were doing it the police could come and take him away  <br/>
from the park.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501757633">Our son is 6 years old too and has always pulled, etc on his penis a lot.  He doesn&#39;t tend to do it anymore out in public...he does it some at home (he still loves to be naked at home...as did our daughter until she was 7 or 8) and we&#39;ve just recently started to tell him that he needs to do it when we&#39;re not around or that he needs to put some pants on.  He seems kind of oblivious when he&#39;s doing it.  Anyway, we have not made a big deal about it at all...just casually explained why its best not to do that around others...and he doesn&#39;t seem to mind when we ask him to put pants on or whatever.  It definitely seems to be something that (with a little prodding from us) he&#39;s growing out of, if it makes you feel better.  He&#39;ll be 7 soon, by the way.  :)  Good luck!<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s different, then.  But for a kid of normal ability and  <br/>
awareness, they should be talked to way sooner than then about why  <br/>
and where.<br/>
<br/>
But when IS too old, even for developmentally delayed kids?  Some  <br/>
things really can&#39;t be done in public.<br/>
<br/>
It used to be common for parents to say &quot;NEVER&quot; touch yourself.<br/>
Saying &quot;Do it in private&quot; isn&#39;t very oppressive.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1048868326">My daughter has &quot;enjoyed&quot; herself since she could crawl.  She is now  <br/>
8.  When she was about 2-3 we basically said that it was fine that  <br/>
she do it, but it needed to be done in the privacy of her own room.<br/>
<br/>
My boys?  They are 6 & 9 and touch themselves also, but in a more  <br/>
normal way - whatever that means.  Lets say that they don&#39;t touch  <br/>
themselves anymore than my husband does! lol<br/>
<br/>
Funny story - we were at Epcot center on Friday and at night before  <br/>
the fireworks be bought them these obnoxious lighted, glow in the  <br/>
dark, spinning Mickey things.  Well all of them spin in circles in  <br/>
crazy ways.  We were walking along trying to find a place for the  <br/>
fireworks and look back at the boys and they are standing there,  <br/>
arched back with their new toys firmly smashed up against their  <br/>
private parts with the lights a-goin&#39; and the top a-spinnin&#39;,  <br/>
laughing and grinning ear to ear.  It was one of those moments where  <br/>
as a parent you know you need to put an immediate stop to what is  <br/>
happening, but it was so damn funny AND mortifying at the same time  <br/>
all we could do is laugh.  We did make them stop, but then they were  <br/>
trying to stick the end of it up their nose and in their ears....boys  <br/>
are really gross sometimes ya know!<br/>

pockets out of his pants.  I did that when ds was 4.  We still had to<br/>
deal with keeping his hands clean, but he was happy enough with the<br/>
free access to be pretty cooperative about that.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;d be quite as discreet with the flipping and<br/>
bending stuff though. :-)<br/>

An eight year old of either gender touching private parts in public  <br/>
is an invitation for child protective services to see what&#39;s up.<br/>
<br/>
It really, honestly, needs to stop.   Unless you&#39;re hoping someone  <br/>
will take the child away so you won&#39;t have to deal with the probelm  <br/>
anymore, it&#39;s not really a matter for &quot;please&quot; and to share ideas  <br/>
