<div id="ygrps-yiv-117359171">My 4 1/2 y.o. loves gun play, from Star Wars to Revolutionary War to<br/>
police chase. Heck, even a postcard of this guy<br/>

em_type=PHOTOGRAPH&searchdata1=hiram%20pistol&gt;   recently inspired a<br/>
car-ride&#39;s worth of pistol play.<br/>
I will admit that I had to come to terms with this, but an article from<br/>
Mothering magazine from a few years back plus a lot of looking inward<br/>
and talking to my husband, who was also a gun-loving youth, made my<br/>
embrace of my son&#39;s passion complete.<br/>
But many--in fact, almost all--of the other parents we know eschew gun<br/>
play. They not only don&#39;t play along, they say things like, &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
want to play guns.  Guns hurt,&quot; and quickly try to distract the children<br/>
with a new activity. I can tell my son is confused. I can tell he&#39;s even<br/>
a little annoyed. What I have so far told him is that gun play makes<br/>
some people uncomfortable, and that it&#39;s a good idea to ask them if they<br/>
want to play guns first. But he doesn&#39;t yet remember this, and anyway,<br/>
it feels like a lame suggestion since we both know the parents will say<br/>
no anyway.<br/>
<br/>
We have a friend, with whom I had not previously discussed this, whose<br/>
son is turning five this week. My son wanted to get her son two<br/>
cork-tipped pop guns, the kind he has and loves so much. I called her<br/>
ahead of time to see if this would be OK. She said no, kindly, but no.<br/>
So now I am feeling a little angry and upset, and my thinking is cloudy,<br/>
so I&#39;m asking for some help.<br/>
<br/>
What I don&#39;t want to happen is for my son to think that something is<br/>
wrong with him since he loves playing with guns. He is a pretty keen kid<br/>
socially, and I know he&#39;s already feeling something a little &quot;off.&quot;<br/>
What can I do? It feels like one of those personal parenting choice<br/>
things, something I&#39;d feel funny asking a parent friend to indulge in my<br/>
child. Anyway, that wouldn&#39;t be where their hearts were, and he&#39;d know<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading, and for any insights.<br/>

you do that&#39;s your choice but you need to realize and deal with the  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s okay not to like gun play, but it&#39;s not right to claim that a gun  <br/>
is &quot;designed for murder.&quot;  That&#39;s not true.<br/>
<br/>
And no one is suggesting that a child should play with an actual gun;  <br/>
you do know that, right?<br/>
<br/>
One of my close friends, whom I&#39;ve known since he was 20, is a police  <br/>
officer.  He saves lives.  He carries a handgun and a shotgun in the  <br/>
trunk of the patrol car.  Those were not designed for murder.   He  <br/>
saves young children from abusive parents.  Would you want those  <br/>
children to fear this man because he has something &quot;designed for  <br/>
murder&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Propaganda and emotional-appeal arguments are not a good way to help  <br/>
children learn about the world around them.<br/>
If you want your children to be afraid, then that&#39;s a good way to  <br/>
create fear in them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Try explaining to your son that most people are afraid of this kind  <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;most people.&quot;   And &quot;this kind of thing&quot; was a toy  <br/>
gun that shoots a cork.<br/>
<br/>
Boys have played with weapons and tools all throughout history.  Girls  <br/>
too, probably, but it&#39;s part of the way a boy learns to be a man.  If  <br/>
boys are prevented from having wooden or plastic toy guns or swords,  <br/>
they&#39;ll make them out of lego or tree branches or their fingers.  It&#39;s  <br/>
nothing new at all.<br/>
<br/>
My middle son, Marty, was planning for a couple of years to be a  <br/>
police officer.  When he was 14 he went to a junior police academy.   <br/>
He has a certificate for being the best marksman there.  They were  <br/>
using simulators (practice guns that work like a video game) and paint  <br/>
ball guns.  His experience before then was Duck Hunt on the Nintendo.   <br/>
It has a toy gun as a controller.  No ducks were harmed.  No actual  <br/>
dogs giggled.  There was no gun.<br/>
<br/>
Marty had not fired a real gun before that academy week.  He hasn&#39;t  <br/>
fired a real gun ever.  We have friends who collect guns, who hunt (my  <br/>
dad was a hunter-safety instructor, but I never used guns myself), and  <br/>
who have offered to take Marty shooting, but he&#39;s not interested.<br/>
<br/>
There is more violence in a mother shaming a little boy and suggesting  <br/>
he wants to have fun with murder than there is in all the boys in the  <br/>
world pointing their fingers and saying &quot;bang.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Toy guns are designed for play, not for murder. The purpose is to play with them in a way that you cannot play with a real gun. <br/>
<br/>
Real guns are to be respected . . . much as real knives and real cars (also things that can be used to cause injury or death) should be respected. Learning to respect the harm something can cause doesn&#39;t happen by *not* playing with the toy versions of those things.<br/>
<br/>
My son has had a toy weapons collection since he was quite young, and it&#39;s invariably something other kids gravitate towards when they&#39;re over. Some of those kids are not allowed toy guns at home.<br/>
<br/>
My son has an air pistol and goes to the gun range with my husband from time to time to shoot that pistol and my hubby&#39;s shotgun. The kid is a good shot and proudly brings home the targets each time they go, but my hubby says Andrew loses interest out there pretty quickly. He&#39;s content going only 3 or 4 times a year; the rest of the time he has no interest in the real guns. He has no interest in hunting, either. <br/>
<br/>
What he likes about toy guns is the very fact that *they are toys*!! Toy guns allow him to play in ways that he has no interest whatsoever in replicating in real life.<br/>
<br/>
Interest in toy guns, or even in real guns, does not mean that interest will develop into wanting to kill people or animals. My husband, my dad, and my brother all own guns, but all three of them hone their marksmanship skills at target practice, period. They love the history of guns, they love the old (long!) rifles that used to belong to my great-grandpa that now hang in my dad&#39;s study, they love the skill that goes into making a gun, and they love the skill it takes to become a good marksman. There is *so much more* to guns than &quot;weapons for murder&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And I think people could be more objective if they&#39;d read stories of  <br/>
*unschooled* kids and now grown kids who are treated respectfully who  <br/>
also play with guns. While it *sounds* like a good theory that playing  <br/>
with guns leads to &quot;stronger stuff&quot; it helps us be kinder to our  <br/>
children to treat it as a theory rather than a fact and investigate it  <br/>
to find out what *really* happens in respectful families.<br/>
<br/>
*Is* the only difference between a gun toting gang member and a  <br/>
nonviolent suburban child, the fact that the gang member played with  <br/>
guns as a child?<br/>
<br/>
There are loads of stories from unschooling parents of kids who&#39;ve  <br/>
grown up playing with guns, playing violent video games who are  <br/>
peaceful and joyful. It&#39;s not the guns or lack of guns that creates  <br/>
that joy. It&#39;s being treated with respect and trusted and loved for  <br/>
who they are.<br/>
<br/>
I think the world would be a more peaceful place if people didn&#39;t  <br/>
think it was okay to use force and shame to make others comply with  <br/>
their beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
Just because a mom believes she&#39;s right, if she shames her child or  <br/>
makes him feel wrong or guilty for believing something different, it&#39;s  <br/>
no different than being pressured by a fundamentalist or militant  <br/>
vegan or PETA advocate. Pressure to believe and change is far more  <br/>
likely to make someone angry (and respond violently!) than respectful  <br/>
acceptance of who they are and their different beliefs.<br/>

When he was around 2.5-3 we found him playing with a neighborhood friend and shooting him...with the attachment from her breast pump!  My oldest, now going on 26, once chewed a piece of toast into the shape of a gun and shot his cousin!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239077252">When my brother was 5 my parents got him a BB gun. They had friends who were so <br/>
angry at them because Martin Luther King Jr. had just been assassinated and they <br/>
saw Sam&#39;s gun as a step towards an adulthood of vigilante violence. It was nuts. <br/>
It is nuts. My brother, as far as I know, has never killed anyone. Although he <br/>
did write a lot of Beavis and Butthead, so maybe he encouraged some questionable <br/>
behaviour. It takes so much more than access guns to make a murderer. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That said, part of being social is accomodation. It is in your and your son&#39;s <br/>
interest that you accomodate your friends&#39; &quot;no gun&quot; policies. Talk to him, tell <br/>
him that some parents don&#39;t like guns and when you are around those kids playing <br/>
with guns isn&#39;t something their parents want. And do other things, offer other <br/>
things, be rich and engaging within the framework of those friendships. <br/>

I&#39;m not suggesting that a parent feel compelled to play along if my son&#39;s gun play upsets him or her, but there are subtle ways to communicate disapproval, and don&#39;t these do some damage, too? <br/>
<br/>
For example, if a vegetarian parent, when offered a meatball from a child, were to say, &quot;No, I don&#39;t eat meat. Meat is killing innocent animals,&quot; wouldn&#39;t that be a little heavy? I can get that not everyone else is going to embrace gun play, but I think I need a little help framing the disconnect for my son and for the other parents. Or maybe not; maybe, like you also mentioned, he&#39;s only 4 1/2, and this will pass soon enough, and telling him that other people can be uncomfortable with it is enough. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, too, for the other responses with stories of parents at peace with kids playing guns.<br/>
<br/>
I think I need to thicken my skin a bit, practice the old invisible eye-roll while I walk away with my child, shooting our hot fingers at the Western horizon... :)<br/>

He&#39;s in his mid- to late-sixties and in fairly poor health (diabetes and bad feet).  One night he had been working late, and was on the freeway on the way home, when a group of young men kept pulling up next to him, checking him out, then pulling back again.  After a while, my uncle decided to pull over to a rest stop.  The other car followed him and pulled up along side him.  At that point my uncle reached under his seat, pulled out his gun, and showed it to them.  They got out of there as fast as they could.  I don&#39;t like guns myself and never plan to own one, but I&#39;m glad when guns (carried by cops or by law-abiding citizens) are able to prevent violence.<br/>
<br/>
Also, a professor once told our class that his sister was a Quaker and would not allow her sons to play with guns because they promote violence.  But, he said, she forgets that when SHE was a kid she was armed to the teeth!<br/>

Real world &quot;turn the fire hose on them&quot; isn&#39;t fun.  That&#39;s riot  <br/>
control.  It&#39;s not safe.  Kids learn that from playing with water guns  <br/>
and garden  hoses.<br/>
<br/>
In the realm of such play, I&#39;d like to point this out:  A very cool  <br/>
tool for filling small balloons with water (or air, but there are  <br/>
already ways to fill balloons with air) is now available and was  <br/>
invented by a little girl.  We&#39;ve used a brass nozzle on the end of a  <br/>
hose, but that&#39;s not portable, and turning it off at the nozzle puts  <br/>
pressure on the hose.<br/>

I got Kirby one when he first moved to Austin, so he could defend  <br/>
himself from his roommate.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are not the least bit violent or mean.  Kirby studied karate;  <br/>
he could kill someone.  Kirby and Marty both did armored combat with  <br/>
rattan weapons, but they&#39;ve messed with real swords enough to know the  <br/>
difference; they could kill someone.    The thing is, they won&#39;t WANT  <br/>
to kill someone.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who has been controlled, shamed and lied to for years and  <br/>
years might want to kill someone, but he won&#39;t need a gun to do that.   <br/>
Notable murder weapons of the past ten of fifteen years, thinking just  <br/>
of fundamentalist homeschoolers and other crazy parents and their  <br/>
children:  rock, bathtub, car-into-lake, pillow, exhaust, drug  <br/>
overdose.  I&#39;m not going to keep my kids from using pillows just  <br/>
because some people are so unhappy they&#39;ve killed someone with a  <br/>
pillow. I couldn&#39;t possibly take all the rocks out of my yard; I&#39;m in  <br/>
New Mexico.<br/>

I was thinking of some of those listed by Saundra and I also thought of baseball bats, a rope (you can strangle someone with just about anything - even a cloth diaper), an ax, a kitchen knife, concrete, vomit - if someone lets them lay in it and suffocate, I could probably bash someone over the head with our laptop ;)  fireworks, fire, Medications - overdose. For my husband, I could slip him some peanut butter or fish and not get him help / hide all the epi-pens.  <br/>
<br/>
I really do love my husband beyond reason - I almost slipped and said I love him to death &lt;BWG&gt; - but wanted to throw out how absurd it can get.  Anything can become a murder weapon - even a dog.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011472783">-=-That said, part of being social is accomodation. It is in your and  <br/>
your son&#39;s<br/>
interest that you accomodate your friends&#39; &quot;no gun&quot; policies. Talk to  <br/>
him, tell<br/>
him that some parents don&#39;t like guns and when you are around those  <br/>
kids playing<br/>
with guns isn&#39;t something their parents want-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids, from earliest ages, asked &quot;Why not?&quot;<br/>
They were better, even when they were toddlers, at understanding that  <br/>
guns were just toys than many grown women, some with college degrees.<br/>
<br/>
Same with video games.  They could never really fathom why some  <br/>
parents were so stridently afraid of video games.<br/>
<br/>
The effect on my kids, without me adding any extreme commentary of my  <br/>
own (I would try to explain from the other person&#39;s point of view,  <br/>
because that&#39;s really what they were asking for), was that they  <br/>
figured out early on that many rules in other families are irrational,  <br/>
and many parents care more about appearances than about their  <br/>
children&#39;s wellbeing and joy.<br/>
<br/>
Something I wrote  in 1998 has this near the beginning:<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------<br/>
One day we were watering the back yard and talking about flow  <br/>
dynamics, although we didn&#39;t use that term. We were observing the  <br/>
speed of the flow, and the swirls, and the &quot;materials&quot; (type and  <br/>
condition of soil, angle of the hill, all that stuff). I told my  <br/>
husband he would have LOVED to have grown up in a place where he&#39;d  <br/>
needed to irrigate. Irrigating an orchard or field is a huge thrill  <br/>
for those who like to play in the water.<br/>
<br/>
A few days later the kids and I were on the way to the unschoolers&#39;  <br/>
meeting place, and Kirby (11) had a small water pistol with him. &quot;Is  <br/>
that empty?&quot; I asked.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well please empty it, because some of the other moms won&#39;t want their  <br/>
kids to get wet, and it&#39;s not a good idea to have water fights where  <br/>
we don&#39;t have towels or other clothes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ooh, I heard that mom voice and looked at the squirt gun, and it was a  <br/>
five ounce insignificant little thing, but still... So Kirby said he  <br/>
would empty it out the window, which he proceeded to do, squirting it  <br/>
on his hand and discussing how much colder it was to have a wet hand  <br/>
in the wind than dry.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-610954783">I grew up on a farm and was taught how to shoot - I&#39;ve never killed a thing in my life even though I went hunting with family - they shot for food and I went along for the social aspect - me the only girl with the men and boys ;)  I do remember carrying the rabbits and fowl for them though.  Frog gigging too.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was a police officer for a while when we first got married - then he switched to being an EMT (emergency medical tech) and driving an ambulance.  Never has he killed anyone.  His hand gun from when he was an officer is locked away for safety reasons.  I have my dad&#39;s two guns from when he was a teen some day they will belong to Zac.<br/>
<br/>
Our son who is now 16 has always loved guns / weapons - in the beginning we had a no play/fake gun policy for the first 4 to 5 years - and he always made his own play guns with sticks, legos, fingers, anything!   We even took him out and showed him what a real gun would do because we have guns in the house - we shot oranges and apples - I don&#39;t remember the age but probably 4 or 5.  We were not trying to scare him but to show him the real danger of what a real gun would do.  Our thought was no play guns - only real guns when he gets old enough. ????  ANYWAY around age 4 or 5 we gave up when it was obvious that a no play guns policy was not diminishing his passion.  We gave up when relatives took him shopping for his birthday and they let him pick out what he wanted and of course he came home with an arsenal!!!!  &lt;BWG&gt; He soon had swords, dart guns, squirt guns, cork guns, rubber band guns, pop guns, nerf, etc.<br/>
<br/>
All that is to say he is 16 and he and his dad are off playing Airsoft today.  Military simulation airsoft.  They get dressed up in complete outfits and replay tactical events.  There is a lot of history involved too - they do research on the event, etc.  For example last fall they re-enacted the event that the movie &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; is based upon .  They ended up going to multiple thrift stores to get the right type of clothing after researching Somoli type dress for those years.  Today they are wearing full military multicam (not allowed to wear current fatigues - just the discarded styles for safety).  Their guns are exact replicas - with orange tips of course. They wear authentic uniforms.<br/>
<br/>
Last week we drove across the state to go to a state park and on the way I was looking at a book about the state and found that there was a really good museum on a military base we would be within an hour drive of (actually 3 museums within one building).  We went to the park, enjoyed the park, got a hotel room for the night and then drove another hour to the base the next day and enjoyed a day of military museums.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Zac is also very knowledgable about any aspect of most wars throughout time and the world.   He knows social and economic causes of wars and results of war.  Inventions that were brought about because of wars and how the invention of a particular weapon advanced society, etc.  Yesterday we were at a book store and he found a book on Samuri swords that he bought - he loves anything to do with the Samuri and Japan.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about the killing to him - though a few good explosions in a game or a movie is thrilling to him ;)  We just went to see &quot;The A-Team&quot; and he loved it!<br/>
<br/>
He went through a stage for 2 years where he made wooden swords with a piece of wood, a carving knife and some fine grit sand paper.  His best ones hang on his bedroom wall.<br/>
<br/>
His love of weapons and warfare have led to knowledge and a passion for:<br/>
<br/>
   Roman, Greek, Norse mythology.<br/>
<br/>
   Knights Templar and other knights, Scotish, Celts, Picts, Saxon, Norman, Brits, Viking, Roman, Mongol, Chinese, Japanese,<br/>
   European - not so much but a little, Egyptian, USA, etc.     <br/>
<br/>
   American history - social and economic as well as wars and weapons.<br/>
<br/>
   Carving, flinting, making chain mail, dioramas, making stop motion films, action film making, still life photography, drawing, map making, hand made a Samuri warrior costume for himself and his horse for a Halloween contest/party and won first place, etc. <br/>
<br/>
  Various music from various time periods: calssical, bagpipes, Scotish / Irish / Celtic, African drumming, Swing, Big Band, <br/>
<br/>
  Movies - and READING :)<br/>
<br/>
  Martial arts - he took HapKiDo for 5 years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I could go on and on as his web of interests are so inter woven with history and warfare but I&#39;ll end with - our son is one of the most kind and gentle souls.  He has never hurt a living thing.  He goes out of his way to help those in need, etc.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Afraid&quot; is a really strong word. So is the idea that kids with popguns are playing with a weapon designed for murder. My brother collects guns, including, I recently learned, a semi-automatic machine gun which my 14-year-old nephew has fired. Nobody mistakes the machine gun for a pop-gun, I don&#39;t imagine. But it seems like some people mistake the pop-gun for the machine-gun! Nobody takes the pop-gun to the firing range, and kids don&#39;t run around the woods at my brother&#39;s house jumping out from behind trees and aiming machine guns at each other. If you think about it for a bit, the differences are pretty obvious.<br/>

<br/>
 But statements of opinion as if they&#39;re fact, that kind of thing, I&#39;d challenge. And if it got to be too much, I&#39;d step back from the relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be part of a homeschool group that included a mom who was so anti-sweets she wouldn&#39;t let her son keep a stick of sugarless gum someone had given him. She was always telling him that sugar was poison and she didn&#39;t let him have it because she loved him and all that kind of thing. When Eric was 3 or 4, we were at park day and her son was saying, &quot;Why is Su letting Eric eat that? Doesn&#39;t she know how bad it is? Doesn&#39;t she love him?&quot; We don&#39;t see much of them anymore ;-)<br/>
<br/>

Eric, at 9, has become interested in bigger, deeper conversations about this kind of thing, and how people decide what&#39;s right for them, and so on, but at 4, 5, 6? &quot;Your friend&#39;s mom doesn&#39;t want him to have pop-guns, let&#39;s pick something else,&quot; really is probably enough.<br/>

another&#39;s self-esteem end and treating children disrespectfully begin?- <br/>
=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a very confusing question. :-)<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t change the world to meet your need to have others treat  <br/>
children respectfully.<br/>
You can treat your own child more respectfully.<br/>
<br/>
-=I&#39;m not suggesting that a parent feel compelled to play along if my  <br/>
son&#39;s gun play upsets him or her, but there are subtle ways to  <br/>
communicate disapproval, and don&#39;t these do some damage, too? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  And your disapproval of the friend&#39;s mother is going to do  <br/>
damage too.<br/>
<br/>
Find the positive, uplifting, happy part of the friendship.  Help  <br/>
brainstorm other gifts that the mother will think are awesome.<br/>
<br/>
She might change her mind in a year or five, about toy guns.  It&#39;s  <br/>
probably worth maintaining the friendship.<br/>
<br/>
-=-For example, if a vegetarian parent, when offered a meatball from a  <br/>
child, were to say, &quot;No, I don&#39;t eat meat. Meat is killing innocent  <br/>
animals,&quot; wouldn&#39;t that be a little heavy? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think so.  I think even telling a child &quot;That show is stupid&quot; is too  <br/>
heavy.  I think &quot;That&#39;s not music&quot; is a horrible insult, and for kids  <br/>
who are musical, it can be the first step in a separation between  <br/>
parent and child, emotionally and psychologically.<br/>
<br/>
There are parents changing their children&#39;s lives in uncomfortable  <br/>
ways to prevent global warming.  I think that&#39;s on past &quot;a little  <br/>
heavy&quot; to insanity.  Making a child feel responsible for the  <br/>
destruction of a planet if he wants to play with Silly String, or for  <br/>
the extinction of a species because he wants a helium balloon is, in  <br/>
my view of the world, abusive.  Illogical and abusive.   Building a  <br/>
warm relationship within which learning can flourish requires first  <br/>
that the parents try to see where they&#39;re being reactionary and  <br/>
speaking in slogans rather than in their own phrases and thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I can get that not everyone else is going to embrace gun play, but  <br/>
I think I need a little help framing the disconnect for my son and for  <br/>
the other parents. Or maybe not; maybe, like you also mentioned, he&#39;s  <br/>
only 4 1/2, and this will pass soon enough, and telling him that other  <br/>
people can be uncomfortable with it is enough. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If he ONLY loves toy guns and that&#39;s all, then it would be easier to  <br/>
get new friends.  If toy guns are only one thing of many, then help  <br/>
him see that different people have different favorite things, and  <br/>
different &#39;disturbances&#39; and it&#39;s polite to do what your guests like  <br/>
to do, and even more polite not to disturb your hosts.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m a Quaker, and really struggle with not-fitting-in with other Quaker parents. Once at our Yearly Meeting (what it sounds like--an annual gathering of Quakers from a certain region) we were gathering to take the kids to the lake for the afternoon. One boy snapped another boy with a towel, and his father went off on him, towering over him, screaming into his face: &quot;ANYTHING CAN BE A WEAPON! YOU HAVE TO BE MORE PEACEFUL!&quot; Scared the bejeesus out of every kid in the room. He went on and on until a Friend took him by the arm and led him out the door.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the idea that anything can be a weapon was a really scary one to plant in a kid&#39;s mind, it was so paranoid. I also thought getting up into a frothing rage and terrifying 20 children over a snapped towel was, as Sandra pointed out up-thread, way more violent than anything those kids were getting up to with their towels and water guns. It was this twisted example of how extreme thinking--in this case, about peace and pacifism--can get all tangled up and lead to the opposite of what you want. In this case, this dad&#39;s commitment to peace in the world was a big part of why he didn&#39;t have peace in his family. Which is heart-breaking because you can help a family be peaceful much more easily than you can bring peace to the world. He was so caught up in an ideal that he gave up the power he had to influence his little corner of things.<br/>

When I was vegetarian, it was for moral reasons.  I figured if I could  <br/>
not, myself, kill a cow and process the meat and deal with the hide  <br/>
and all, then I had no business having a hamburger.  I was caught up  <br/>
in the Diet for a Small Planet fears of the early 1970&#39;s, that assured  <br/>
people that by the 21st century there would be mass starvation if we  <br/>
didn&#39;t all turn vegetarian RIGHT THEN.    And I thought I was too  <br/>
wimpy to even kill a chicken, so I had no business eating chicken.<br/>
<br/>
During those same two years, though, I was studying archeology and  <br/>
religion and history and geology and....   I started to see that there  <br/>
has never, ever been a time in any human culture, EVER, when each  <br/>
person who ate also had to kill and slaughter animals.   Even among  <br/>
lions, the males don&#39;t hunt.  They hang out and eat after the females  <br/>
kill something.  They&#39;re going to guard, though, and risk their lives  <br/>
protecting the pregnant females.<br/>
<br/>
In any social group I&#39;ve been in, any group of ten or twenty people  <br/>
who end up being friends, I&#39;ve looked sometimes at who would be the  <br/>
hunters, if we were isolated and had to revert to &quot;natural&quot; life.  No  <br/>
grocery stores.  Create a shelter.  In any group of a dozen or so, I  <br/>
usually see two or three who would be willing to hunt (or trap, or  <br/>
fish) and be good at it.  There are quite a few 5,000 year old  <br/>
religions on the planet, and I don&#39;t think any of them of them are  <br/>
expressly vegetarian except the Jains.  Hindus and Buddhists go by  <br/>
class and station.  Higher classes and religious figured are more  <br/>
likely to be vegetarian.  Monks and nuns, among Catholics, are mostly  <br/>
likely to be vegetarian.<br/>
<br/>
People in modern cultures can eat meat at every meal.  That&#39;s not  <br/>
ideal, and it&#39;s not &quot;natural.&quot;  But never eating meat at all under any  <br/>
circumstances isn&#39;t natural either.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too much information to give a little kid, but it&#39;s not too  <br/>
much for parents to be aware that such ideas and evidence exists in  <br/>
abundance all over the place.  There&#39;s no one simple &quot;right answer.&quot;   <br/>
There&#39;s the whole world, all of history, biology, philosophy and  <br/>
practicality.  Parents who pretend there IS one simple right answer  <br/>
are not being honest.<br/>

on him, towering over him, screaming into his face: &quot;ANYTHING CAN BE A  <br/>
WEAPON! YOU HAVE TO BE MORE PEACEFUL!&quot; Scared the bejeesus out of  <br/>
every kid in the room. He went on and on until a Friend took him by  <br/>
the arm and led him out the door.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I hope the one who escorted him away pointed out that voices and  <br/>
posture can be pretty non-peaceful!!<br/>
<br/>
-=- In this case, this dad&#39;s commitment to peace in the world was a  <br/>
big part of why he didn&#39;t have peace in his family. Which is heart- <br/>
breaking because you can help a family be peaceful much more easily  <br/>
than you can bring peace to the world. He was so caught up in an ideal  <br/>
that he gave up the power he had to influence his little corner of  <br/>
things.-=-<br/>
<br/>
He probably thought he WAS using his power to create more peace in the  <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
Having a peaceful family does add to the peace of the world.  Some  <br/>
adults with young children think they&#39;re doing their children a favor  <br/>
by working to stop wars in foreign lands.  Meanwhile, their child is  <br/>
home alone because the parents are at political rallies.  Or the  <br/>
parents are filling their own heads to the overflow point with images  <br/>
and details of death and suffering.  That&#39;s not peace for their child.<br/>
<br/>
People fight.  They always have.  They probably always will.  All the  <br/>
idealistic kumbaya in the world won&#39;t change that.  We can choose to  <br/>
ALL be miserably unhappy because those in warzones are.  Some people  <br/>
do choose that. Some people do want to have fraternity with the most  <br/>
downtrodden.   I think that activity should be reserved to childless  <br/>
idealists or to those whose own children are grown, not the parents of  <br/>
young children.  I don&#39;t get to control that any more than those  <br/>
people get to control the religious or political thoughts and actions  <br/>
of people they have never and will never meet.   But I can bring that  <br/>
recommendation here for those who want to create a natural-learning  <br/>
safe-space for their children.<br/>

If she can get that ore smelting thing set up, I can make pottery.   I  <br/>

we could bypass that and just sing to you all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1218426620">I would recommend &#39;Killing Monsters&#39; by Gerard Jones (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Monsters-Children-Make-Believe-Violence/dp/0465036953)">http://www.amazon.com/Killing-Monsters-Children-Make-Believe-Violence/dp/0465036953)</a><br/>
<br/>
I came to unschooling come via ideas like attachment parenting and from a philosophy of non-violence.  In this context I found that the intrinsic violence of &#39;violent&#39; play was difficult to question and I found the book very helpful in this.  <br/>
<br/>
I think also that bringing up boys I didn&#39;t want to restrict them to male-violent stereotypes, I wanted them to feel free to nurture and express emotions.  That too can lead to trying to suppress &#39;violent&#39; play - even though it is in no way limited to boys/men and even though it can build and nurture relationships.  You don&#39;t encourage or enable boys to nurture and love freely by pathologising their desire to make things explode.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t remember the book clearly enough to comment on it&#39;s general unschooling-friendliness but I think Gerard Jones remembers what it is like to try to play with a grown up and have them react as if you&#39;re dangerous.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a five year old and a three year old (boys), when Jack hits Charlie with a book that is violence (...anger, frustration, failure of situation-reading on my part), when he points a gun and says &#39;bang&#39; that is usually play, friendship, social skills and a whole bunch of other great stuff.<br/>

Our son has had all sorts of toy guns over the years, but when he was about 2.5 years I made a list of some of the things he had turned into guns during his short lifetime.<br/>

I came up with over twenty items, including some unlikely things such as a shoe, a can opener, and a pair of lemons.<br/>
<br/>
My girls also like playing with swords and guns, but it has definitely been a stronger passion in my son.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533303630">Just today, on a fellow unschooler facebook wall, another unschooling mom made a <br/>
very strong<br/>
  comment against a book series.<br/>
I asked why was she so against it. She went on and on. She never read the books <br/>
or seen the movies about it<br/>
but she was &quot; against &quot; them. Her own words.<br/>
I did not know she was an unschooling mom at that point and was surprised to <br/>
find out later that she was.<br/>
Of course she has the right  not to like them. People like different things.<br/>
What if one of her kids would read them in the future and love them?<br/>
Would they feel wrong for enjoying something their mother  is &quot;against&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Last week my niece flew in from NC and me and Gigi, my 4 year old , went to pick <br/>
her and her boyfriend up.<br/>
Gigi loves her and was really happy to see her. <br/>
Gigi asked her if she liked McDonalds. <br/>
My niece , who was not unschooled and is a history teacher, said &quot;Ewwww, it is <br/>
horrible and really bad for you, yuck.&quot;<br/>
She then, went on and on how it was &quot;disgusting&quot; and bad for your health, yadda <br/>
yadda.<br/>
She could have said: &quot; No I don;&#39;t like it.&quot;<br/>
That would have been enough.<br/>
 Why make a person, in this case, a 4 year old, feel like they are wrong  <br/>
because they like something you don&#39;t.<br/>
She could have even said she does not like it because the food is not as fresh, <br/>
or they use some things she does not thing are healthy.<br/>
But &quot;EWWWWWW&quot; and &quot;yuck&quot; and  going on and on how it is bad and poison for your <br/>
body???<br/>
<br/>
I used to be the very opinionated person who did those things. Even not long <br/>
ago!<br/>
But I have come a long way to accept and respect people&#39;s different likes and <br/>
dislikes.<br/>
I was the mom , who when my son was a baby, thought video games were silly and a <br/>
waste.<br/>
Fast forward and today I am the one playing and supporting my son&#39;s video game  <br/>
passion.<br/>
