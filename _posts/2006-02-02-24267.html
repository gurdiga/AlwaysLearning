&gt; Subject: Religion and unschooling<br/>
&gt; As unschoolers, how do you handle your religion and your kids? Does <br/>
&gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; impart your spiritual wisdom to your family? If yes, how do you go <br/>
&gt; about it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>BE:<br/>
You just live YOUR religion.<br/>
And let them explore theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Mine are all grown not and living &quot;good&quot; lives.<br/>
But we explored with them Catholic, Christian Fundamentalist.<br/>
Bahai, Unitarian, and others. We even taught Sunday School<br/>
and led workshops on science (our fields) and religion.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is unschooling.  Even in religion.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO<br/>
