<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; Zak has a magazine called Kids Discovery and on the back of it each<br/>
&gt; month are close ups of animals and you have to guess what they are<br/>
&gt; and unscramble the names below. &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; National Geographic World used to have them (maybe still, we don&#39;t get it now)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They still usually do, but it&#39;s called National Geographic KIDS now, if<br/>
you&#39;re looking for it.<br/>
