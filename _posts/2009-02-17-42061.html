<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004965692">i am wondering if anyone has any interesting ideas or experiences to share for helping a teen girl navigate strong feelings about beauty and body image, in an unschooly way - either from personal experience or with your own teen daughters...<br/>
<br/>
i think i may have posted about this before, but she was still in school, and so still &quot;under the influence&quot; on a daily basis, and i can only find a couple responses in the archives, so maybe there are more ideas out there? we both (she and i) feel fairly certain that her 9-12 year old school experiences really influenced her self image/struggle with this issue. she&#39;s almost 14 now and has been out of school for only 5 months.<br/>
<br/>
we already have lots of books, she&#39;s savvy about web sites and media messages on both &quot;sides&quot;- she has the intellectual understanding wrt to acceptance and inner beauty, etc., and applies it to *other* girls and women - in fact she started &quot;the modeling project&quot; to communicate to clothing companies that REAL women with real bodies buy their clothes - but internalizing self acceptance and even better, self love, is sooooooo much  harder.  <br/>
<br/>
i can give more info if that would be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My first thought is that if she has an obsession, it will be hard for  <br/>
her to see the rest of the world.  Obsessions can be wonderfully  <br/>
useful, but if she&#39;s feeling self-conscious physically and there&#39;s no  <br/>
good way to know how her physicality might change just from being away  <br/>
from the pressure of school, and from growing past the age of 13,  <br/>
maybe she should do a dozen other things before she even turns in the  <br/>
direction of anything about the fashion industry.<br/>
