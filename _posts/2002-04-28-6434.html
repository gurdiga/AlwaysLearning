<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600718257">&lt;&lt;&lt;I want to talk about my hardest thing ever to talk about.  That is this:  how <br/>
many integrity points do I lose (or does anyone lose) by saying &quot;Oh, anyone <br/>
can unschool&quot; when that truly seems NOT to be the case?  I still don&#39;t know a <br/>
way to preface the unschooling intro to weed out people who might possibly <br/>
be... (glancing around and not actually seeing any eyes to gauge by, and so <br/>
risking insult to an unknown reader; I hope not)  ...   *dull*. &gt;&gt;&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
As I took the first steps towards changing our lifestyle to encompass unschooling a few months ago, there was a discussion going on either at the unschooling.com message boards or here, can&#39;t remember exactly where, but you made a list, Sandra, of personal qualities that would be required to be an unschooling parent.  As simplistic as it might seem to some seasoned unschoolers, it was extremely helpful to me. I had to take a hard look at myself to determine if it would be feasible, and thankfully it is!  I haven&#39;t read the current intro, but I don&#39;t believe there is anything wrong in being straight forward and honest about what it takes, and even using the word, &quot;dull.&quot;  Assuming most parents want to make the best decision for their family, those reading the intro would appreciate knowing they were/were not cut out for it.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is to put that list in the intro, if you can remember or find it.<br/>

I didn&#39;t find the recent list, but while looking I found what follows AND <br/>
something I started for a column for HEM which I never finished (GOOD!)  <br/>
<br/>
So...  this is old, from AOL forum days, and some blasts from the past for <br/>
some folks here (or maybe might BE some folks here! &lt;g&gt;):<br/>

&lt;&lt;I&#39;m working on (goofing around with) the possibility of a &quot;test&quot; to give <br/>
people (a checklist, or list of questions, or something) so that they can <br/>
start to figure out what they have that they can use to unschool, or whether <br/>
the whole thing is too foreign and odious to them (and if the latter, why).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You guys want to contribute to it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t resist.  For the math portion of the quiz: &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
1.  Estimate the number of cleaning products in your home (x).  Compare to <br/>
the number of books (y).<br/>
<br/>
2.  Estimate the number of times per week you say: &quot;Don&#39;t touch.&quot;  (a).<br/>
<br/>
3.  Do a probability analysis of the likelihood that you will be playing <br/>
outside on any given day. Label the result (z). <br/>
<br/>
4.  Chart the number of pairs of comfortable shoes you own (b).  Compare to <br/>
the number of umbrellas (c).<br/>
<br/>
5.  If you were a geometric figure, which would you be?  Write a brief essay <br/>
explaining why.<br/>
<br/>
Scoring:<br/>
1.  If x&gt;y, deduct one point.  If x&lt;y, add one point.<br/>
2.  If a&gt;5, deduct one point. If a&lt;5, add one point.  If a&lt;0, add two points.<br/>
3.  If z&gt;2:4, add one point. If z&lt;2:4, deduct one point.<br/>
4.  If b&gt;c, add one point.  If b&lt;c, deduct one point.<br/>
5.  Add one point for each dimension included in your figure beyond 2. Add <br/>
two points for each dimension beyond 4.  Essays will be graded at a later <br/>
date and returned to you.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your attention and good luck with your homeschooling decision.<br/>
<br/>

Sandra, I think that a test is sure to make a lot of people mad.  Maybe a <br/>
list of personal attributes would be more helpful.  Something like...<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents tend to have:<br/>
<br/>
1.)  A stronge sense of curiousity<br/>
<br/>
2.)  A love of life<br/>
<br/>
3.)  A love of learning that supercedes their love of order<br/>
<br/>
4.)  A high tolerance for noise<br/>
<br/>
5.)  Access to lots of children&#39;s books and resources...etc.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the &#39;right&#39; answer for leaving the house is.  If we&#39;re <br/>
going to the park, I need to pack diapers, wipes, extra clothes for my <br/>
potty-training daycare kiddo, sunscreen, sunhat, water, cups, snacks, <br/>
blanket, toys for the baby...so it takes me quite a while.  Also, whenever we <br/>
leave the house I wear makeup (3 minutes, tops) and my kids have their long <br/>
hair brushed and pulled back, and their faces and hands clean.  But at the <br/>
park I don&#39;t tell my kids what to play or bore them with lectures on botany, <br/>
so I guess we&#39;re still unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t think you have to be contantly on the go in order to unschool, and <br/>
I think you can unschool and still be clean and neat.  (But nobody would get <br/>
that idea from looking at my house.  &lt;g&gt;)  I have a fairly low tolerance for <br/>
noise so either I stay away from the area where my kids are being noisy or <br/>
they go to another area.  (That&#39;s why God created basements and back yards.)<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah, a few things I would add are <br/>
<br/>
6.)  Ability to withstand criticism from friends and relatives.  <br/>
<br/>
7.)  Ability to trust children&#39;s innate capacity for natural learning.  <br/>
<br/>
8.)  A loving, non-adversarial relationship with their children.  <br/>

&lt;&lt;What other kinds of factors should I be considering? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget my personal favorite. A sense of humor.<br/>

I&#39;m not sure how to put this as a &quot;test&quot; question, but I think one factor <br/>
might have to do with how naturally interactive a person is. That is, Sandra <br/>
frequently describes the way she uses whatever&#39;s on the radio or TV or a <br/>
billboard or whatever in talking to her kids, throwing out interesting <br/>
historical tidbits all the time, for example. I&#39;m guessing that Sandra sees <br/>
and thinks and talks, involving her kids in her own thought processes, <br/>
without conciously trying to. I think that must make it easier to unschool <br/>
for her than it is for me, a natural introvert, because my thinking and <br/>
talking are all more deliberate. I don&#39;t speak off the top of my head, <br/>
typically; I see and think and think some more, and it may not occur to me to <br/>
tell the kids what I&#39;m seeing and how I&#39;m thinking about it. Doesn&#39;t mean I <br/>
can&#39;t unschool (I am!), but it may mean I need to be more deliberate about <br/>
it. Does this make any sense?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was one of the most un-cut-out-for-it people you could imagine. <br/>
 Former military, you know?  Authoritarian, yada, yada, yada.  I was <br/>
almost as bad as Pat.  (If I didn&#39;t like you, Pat, I wouldn&#39;t kid you, <br/>
Pat.  I think you&#39;ve come a long way since I&#39;ve been on this list.)<br/>
<br/>
But one thing I did have going for me that some people don&#39;t have.  The <br/>
willingness to try new things.  I was willing to change.  <br/>
<br/>
Can you be an unschooler without that?  I don&#39;t think so.  (Pat, I think <br/>
you have it.  &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
