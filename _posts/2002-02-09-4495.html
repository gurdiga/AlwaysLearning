 </span></blockquote>Jeffrey Dahmer started with animals.  He tortured<br/>
them, killed them and messed with the bodies.  These<br/>
boys have serious mental and emotional problems. <br/>
Either it&#39;s genetics, or they have a secret abuse<br/>
somewhere that no one knows about (maybe not even the<br/>
parents.)  It&#39;s possible that someone hurt the oldest<br/>
boy (like sexual abuse or something) and he in turn<br/>
passed the favor on to his younger siblings.  Are<br/>
their parents asleep at the wheel or what?  These kids<br/>
need some intervention.  Do them a favor and stir<br/>
things up before it&#39;s too late.  They have already<br/>
moved on to abusing people.<br/>
