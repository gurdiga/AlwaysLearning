just WATCH IT, and the whole thing, too.  I mean it.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote> I must watch that movie again. Rickman has some classic lines.<br/>
But then he always gets the good ones. I remeber Robin Hood <br/>
(man oh man Costner was terrible in that), some of the Sheriffs <br/>
lines were hysterical. He was the only thing worth watching in the <br/>
entire movie.<br/>
