<div id="ygrps-yiv-820930919">My 10 year old daughter loves animation. She gone through every drawing and animation book in every library in our county that interested her. She&#39;d really like to watch some instructional videos or take an online class (as long as it didn&#39;t require too much independent reading) about animation. <br/>
<br/>
Does anyone here know of any good resources for someone who does not like to read (even 3 paragraphs is frustrating for her), but wants to learn more about animation by watching or looking at pictures?<br/>
<br/>
TIA for any suggestions you all may have!<br/>

Maybe you could get a copy of Photoshop Elements (a home version of  <br/>
Photoshop) and she could practice with moving gifs.  She could find  <br/>
some of those online (any google search for animated gif).  They were  <br/>
once the epitome of webpage art!  But they can be really fancy  <br/>
animation.   Or they can be simple toggles.     She could use photos  <br/>
or line drawings (scanned or done with a draw/paint program maybe).<br/>

Those don&#39;t take reading.  You could do the reading, if creating an  <br/>
animated gif doesn&#39;t come naturally to you, within a program like that.<br/>

Flash movies are related to that.  Those are easy to find too.<br/>
<br/>
OH!  Definitely show her Trogdor.  It&#39;s linked on this page:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-922275771">Thanks! I showed her Holly&#39;s pictures and she was really excited. We already had Adobe Fireworks and found out tonight that you can make animated gifs with it. Apparently you can also import everything into Flash (which we are saving up for). She&#39;s hard at work creating new images right now :)<br/>

<br/>
Oh, cool!!<br/>
<br/>
If she wants a place to display them and you don&#39;t have a blog or a  <br/>
page to put them on, I&#39;d be glad to host them on my unschooling  <br/>
pages.   If she wants to make a title for a page sometime, Holly&#39;s  <br/>
done some.  She could find a boring-looking page and fix something  <br/>
up.  Not all are animated.  An assortment of media is fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
Most of Holly&#39;s examples are here, and a couple are animated-ish (one  <br/>
is inexplicable... had to do with erasing one image and taking  <br/>
pictures as she did...)<br/>

That offer goes for others, too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
