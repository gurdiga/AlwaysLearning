<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672736684">Just wanted to say hi and touch base. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It is SO good to hear from you Alice!!<br/>
We miss you terrible down here...your name comes up often.<br/>
The first time we went to the park after you moved, the kids were all excited <br/>
until we got there and they realized you guys weren&#39;t coming.<br/>
Sierra was talking about &quot;my other friend Rachel&quot; a few days ago.<br/>
Sigh....<br/>
<br/>
The group has taken off. We have new folks almost weekly some months. Radical <br/>
unschoolers among them, some with young children that the unschooling <br/>
resonates with and they&#39;re thrilled to find a group that understands.<br/>
A few school at home types mixed in to keep things interesting. :)<br/>
<br/>
You met Theresa right? I met her at the conference and we talked about her <br/>
meeting you but I can&#39;t remember if you actually met or she was planning it.<br/>
??<br/>
Hope you&#39;ll be around more....we sure miss ya!<br/>
<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
