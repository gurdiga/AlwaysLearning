<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093220827">Hi--I&#39;ve been lurking for ages (been really busy with<br/>
kids, work, etc) but now wonder if I can ask for some<br/>
feedback on unschooling in New Mexico.  We&#39;ve been<br/>
overseas with the Foreign Service in Vienna, Austria<br/>
for three years, will be returning to the States this<br/>
July and transferring to Albuquerque.  We&#39;re<br/>
experienced unschoolers (the only ones in Vienna,<br/>
Austria!) Family includes SAHD, WM, DS (9), DD (5),<br/>
and DS (2).  Would welcome (via list or offline, as<br/>
appropriate) info/advice on reacclimating to the<br/>
States and/or continuing unschooling in New Mexico. <br/>
I&#39;ve already checked out the laws but would welcome<br/>
practical advice, as well as info from any other<br/>
unschoolers out there (we&#39;re Catholic, but welcome<br/>
advice from any quarter) on group events,<br/>
associations, etc, as well as general info on moving<br/>
to Albuquerque (such as, where NOT to buy a house!). <br/>
TIA.  Lisa<br/>
<br/>

You don&#39;t need to register if you&#39;d prefer not to.  Nobody will know or care <br/>
as long as you don&#39;t have evil in-laws who don&#39;t want you to homeschool.   I <br/>
haven&#39;t registered for ten years or so, and I&#39;m not sneaky and nobody&#39;s said a <br/>
word.<br/>
<br/>
If you looked online at the state&#39;s website they haven&#39;t updated that for <br/>
three years.  They&#39;re goobers.  There are no more testing requirements.<br/>
<br/>

associations, etc,-=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a mailing list for unschoolers which is *very quiet* but you&#39;re <br/>
welcome to stir it up.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Unschoolarama@yahoogroups.com">Unschoolarama@yahoogroups.com</a> and some of the people are <br/>
from other parts of New Mexico and southern Colorado.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a Friday playgroup with lots of kids your kids&#39; ages and in warm <br/>
seasons they meet at the park closest to my house.  I&#39;m not one of the organizers <br/>
and I don&#39;t even go, but Holly&#39;s a regular.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; as well as general info on moving<br/>
to Albuquerque (such as, where NOT to buy a house!).  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are just a couple of &quot;bad neighborhoods,&quot; both near the airbase.  <br/>
Renting first might be good so you can learn the town and figure out where your <br/>
likely trails will be.  And lots depends on where your husband&#39;s going to work.  <br/>
