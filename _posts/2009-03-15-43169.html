<div id="ygrps-yiv-882950693">My son has taken a recent interest in gothic art, literature, and decor.  He has found some really cool stuff.  We are re-doing his bedroom this summer, and he wants it goth.  We are waiting on a library book on goth decor called &quot;Paint it Black&quot;  and are looking for any other suggestions anyone might have.  He has found a few websites with suggestions, but not many really good pictures.<br/>
<br/>
I realize as I am writing this how unschooling in our household has brought me more interesting learning adventures than I ever would have had in the mindset of my &quot;previous life&quot;.  Having a child whom I chose not to send to school has slowly brought back my own excitement for learning.  Cool.<br/>

Real gothic?  Historical gothic?  Or &quot;goth&quot;?  Maybe the comparison of  <br/>
the two would be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Cher used to have a catalog of Goth decor that did both.  If he could  <br/>
find one of those catalogs that would be cool.  I wish I&#39;d never  <br/>
thrown them away!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339772">--Real gothic? Historical gothic? Or &quot;goth&quot;?--<br/>
<br/>
What is your distinction between real gothic and historical gothic?  Or are you meaning &#39;real historical&#39;?  I know he loves the historical gothic architecture, medieval castles and stone spires....Castles and dragons and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
Goth?  Yes, maybe in a &#39;light goth&#39; sort of way, if there is such a thing.  He likes the macabre, as long as it is not too scary (he&#39;s 11).  Even at 2 years old, watching Fantasia, his favorite scenes were to the score of &quot;Night on Bald Mountain&quot;, and to this day he loves that piece of music.  He likes the artwork of Brom, rather macabre/horror/sci-fi kind of stuff, very detailed and other-worldly.<br/>
<br/>
He also has a passion for the Japanese culture, and would like to mix in some eastern influences - ninja-type stuff, earth elements...At first I saw goth and eastern as opposite ends of the spectrum, but the more he talks about it, the more I can see them blending together in an interesting way.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll maybe spend some more time checking out the historical *and* the pop-culture goth.  Cher had a catalog?!  I&#39;ll have to keep my eyes open for that!  I&#39;d love to see it.<br/>

Gothic as the term existed in 1960, say.  Untainted by goth (&quot;goth&quot;  <br/>
not &quot;gothic&quot;) stuff that was added on by vampire fans later.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh yes!  This is what Chamille is all about!  She started with ninja<br/>
stuff, anime, all of that.  Then she incorporated more blood and more<br/>
gore and other elements.  She loves anime that is gorey, the more blood,<br/>
the better.  Then she added rainbows and blood together.  She sort of<br/>
tossed the black for neon and rainbows.  Now she&#39;s adding the black with<br/>
the neon.<br/>
<br/>
Currently she&#39;s really into Japanese and Korean horror flicks (if you<br/>
know any good ones, let us know!).  Her clothing is inspired by Japanese<br/>
counter culture fashion.   She&#39;s working on cyber goth right now.  We&#39;ve<br/>
been making dread locks with tubular crinolin, and we are about to put<br/>
it into a wig piece.   Here&#39;s a picture of what it hopefully will look<br/>
like....<br/>

<br/>
The thing is, although it doesn&#39;t necessarily originate from Japan, it&#39;s<br/>
been incorporated into cosplay stuff, which Chamille is really fond of,<br/>
and it all started with her love of Pokemon years and years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are others that can make a timeline starting with<br/>
Pokemon!  That would be interesting to see where other kids have gone<br/>
with that.<br/>

<br/>
Reminds me of an episode of SouthPark where the Goth kids are appalled  <br/>
that Twilight fans are stealing their look.<br/>
And I never would have known that in my pre unschooling days.   <br/>
SouthPark used to be Verboten in our  house.  I was very happy to  <br/>
discover it after the limits  dissolved.<br/>
