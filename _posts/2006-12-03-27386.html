My kids have learned to read on their own.  Kirby is fluent and uses  <br/>
reading for all kinds of things.  Marty is irritatingly phonetic, but  <br/>
will become fluid with more practice.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, Pam Sorooshian and such folk would probably be able to  <br/>
point out or draw out dozens of things I did with/to/for my  kids  <br/>
that helped them learn to read, but I didn&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them to read,  <br/>
and more than I taught them to play Nintendo (although I did buy them  <br/>
a Nintendo, let them rent games, and bought some game guides and  <br/>
magazines).   I didn&#39;t teach them to do tricks on the swing set, but  <br/>
we did put the swing set up and maintain it and keep it clean and  <br/>
available.   I didn&#39;t teach them to ride bikes, but I did make sure  <br/>
they had bikes and opportunities to ride places other than just right  <br/>
in front of the house.   I didn&#39;t teach them to sing, but I did sing  <br/>
to and with them a lot, take them places to hear others sing, play  <br/>
videos and recordings of different kinds of singing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
They read.<br/>
They know that something as hard as reading can be learned without  <br/>
formal lessons.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a heck of a thing for kids their age to know.  There are  <br/>
adults who don&#39;t know it.<br/>

I found it tonight, looking for something on the computer before  <br/>
last.  Thought I might as well run it through here.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1593824662">reminds me of the John Holt quote, to the effect that if we taught kids to<br/>
walk the way we teach them to read, most kids would learn to walk, but most<br/>
would grow up to hate walking, and do it badly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125831802">Thanks for posting this!  I think it all just comes down to enjoying your children and <br/>
helping them to facilitate what they are interested in, not having an alterior motive of <br/>
&quot;teaching&quot; them something while doing it.<br/>
