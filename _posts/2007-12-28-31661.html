<div id="ygrps-yiv-1088710557">I got this last week. It may be of interest.<br/>
<br/>
From the Alternative Education Resource Organization (AERO):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are now putting on an international organization, network, and <br/>
group search for those connected with alternative education / learner-<br/>
centered approach to education in some capacity. This search will <br/>
eventually yield in a brand new free resource to be offered on our <br/>
website. Please help this resource become one of the most powerful <br/>
research and informational tools online today in the world of <br/>
educational alternatives by e-mailing all of the contact information <br/>
you have for every organization, network, or group connected you know <br/>
of!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The e-mail address to send the organizations to is: <br/>
