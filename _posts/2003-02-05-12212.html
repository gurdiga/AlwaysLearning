&lt;&lt; This is really a list for folks who already &quot;get it&quot;---veteran <br/>
unschoolers. <br/>
You&#39;re certainly welcome here, but there are a couple of other places where <br/>
you might feel a bit more comfortable with a lot of questions. The essays and <br/>
message boards at unschooling.com and the e-list, <br/>

<br/>
OH!<br/>
I was SO on automatic pilot that I responded to the new member as though we <br/>
were on unschooling-dotcom.<br/>
<br/>
The other stuff I said was true except for www.unschooling.com being the <br/>
parent forum of this list.  I guess it&#39;s the grandparent forum. &lt;g&gt;  Or the <br/>
kindly neighbor forum.<br/>
