<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112823928">The thread on &quot;handling disrespect respectfully&quot; is disturbing me,  <br/>
and I&#39;m trying to figure out why.  I want to bring the ideas away  <br/>
from the particulars/individuals.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m very grateful to those who have patiently tried to explain the  <br/>
hows and whys of what seems, to some, like limits and &quot;no&quot; and  <br/>
punishment, but it really the compassionate assistance of one human  <br/>
by a loving other.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is just in general to any mom involved who&#39;s questioning advice  <br/>
that seems harsher than &quot;non-coercion.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Did you tell your child &quot;I will never punish you&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Did you tell your child &quot;I will protect you from any consequences of  <br/>
your actions, no matter how harmful&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If you did, you shouldn&#39;t have.  If you didn&#39;t, what do you care if  <br/>
it feels like a punishment?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not hitting him or shaming him or &quot;grounding him&quot; or  <br/>
forcing him to eat spinach or to go to bed and stay there at 8:00 at  <br/>
night, good.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re indicating to him by word and deed that he&#39;s free to do any  <br/>
damned thing he can think up and you&#39;ll stand there smiling and  <br/>
saying &quot;I love you,&quot; NOT good.<br/>
<br/>
In  the vast space between those things are many good, thoughtful,  <br/>
mindful, rational options.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s my same old concern:  Some people take a  <br/>
misunderstanding of something they half read or didn&#39;t consider  <br/>
carefully enough, they move too far too fast without understanding  <br/>
the principles involved, and then blame unschooling for bad results.<br/>

This NOT the same as &quot;I will always love you, no matter what you <br/>
do&quot;  which is what I felt was being discussed in the other posts.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>if it feels like a punishment?<br/>
<br/>
I care because communication takes two people, and my message (and <br/>
actions) only mean what others take them to mean.  If they don&#39;t <br/>
take it as I intended it, it doesn&#39;t make me right and them wrong, <br/>
but it does mean that communication between us has failed.  I care <br/>
how they feel because I love them and I want them to learn, not feel <br/>
punished. I don&#39;t think people learn from punishment or rather, they <br/>
learn things you didn&#39;t intend.  What they learn is important to me.<br/>

<br/>
I see the question of `Will you still love me no matter what I do?&#39; <br/>
as looking for *reassurance* of my love, not permission <br/>
for `misbehavior&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem with standing there angry looking and saying, &quot;I <br/>
love you, but I am NOT happy right now!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Loving someone does not equal tolerating all behaviors.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The example wasn&#39;t talking about behavior that could be &quot;tolerated&quot; or not--she was <br/>
using a more extreme example of one child killing another child.  With that example, I <br/>
would be way beyond thoughts of whether I could tolerate the behavior.<br/>
<br/>
In a certain sense I think there is a semantics issue going on.  A person&#39;s behavior IS part <br/>
of them--it&#39;s the visible manifested part of their personality acting in/on the world.  To <br/>
separate a person from their behavior is just as off-base as it is to assume that a person is <br/>
only the sum of their behavior.<br/>
<br/>
To say either that you won&#39;t love a child in the same way who commits an atrocity or to <br/>
say you will continue to love them, but not love their behavior may, in effect, amount to <br/>
the same thing--both statements are a rejection of the antisocial behavior--which stems <br/>
from thoughts and feelings within the person that caused the behavior.  Either statement <br/>
is a rejection, to some extent, of the person.  I&#39;ve been in the situation of having my <br/>
&quot;behavior not liked&quot; but been told that the person &quot;loved me,&quot; and I didn&#39;t actually feel <br/>
loved, because my behavior WAS an expression of ME.<br/>
<br/>
I think the second statement is a more politically correct one, but the first strikes me as <br/>
more upfront and honest.  That&#39;s not to say I would verbalize that at anytime, and <br/>
especially in the midst of a conflict with my kids, or anyone, but when that love bond is <br/>
weakened, the person can usually feel it anyway.<br/>

****<br/>
yes i see it too. and it&#39;s for those reasons why unschooling kids have had  a <br/>
bad rap, of being disrepectful , rude kids. <br/>
 People *are* becomig more aware but that&#39;s the picture many people  still <br/>
have, and it&#39;s probably from those families that think it&#39;s ok for their  kids <br/>
to do anything they want, total freedom no matter how it affects  others.<br/>
 <br/>
And when life caves in on them they blame unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand, but I disagree.  I don&#39;t think it is rejection of the <br/>
person as I don&#39;t equate people as identical to their actions. <br/>
<br/>
Actions are fleeting and can not match all of a person&#39;s values and <br/>
intentions.  Internal conflicts in conjunction with external <br/>
situations can cause odd or tragic actions.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re getting deep into hypothicals here, since the question was a <br/>
broad statement of one sibling killing another.  I would guess you&#39;d <br/>
have different feelings if a sibling hit another with a car versus <br/>
snuck up on them at night, but then what if they have developed a <br/>
mental defect, such as schizophrenia, would you love them less? <br/>
<br/>
I took the original point as a query along the lines of:<br/>
Does loving someone unconditionally give tacit approval of their <br/>
behavior?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so. <br/>
<br/>
I still care for people who have hurt me very deeply.  I feel loss, <br/>
confusion, sadness, disappointment, anger and many other emotions, <br/>
but I also feel love and caring.  To me, it is a parallel system, <br/>
rather than a sum of the feelings into one numerical type value on a <br/>
scale of Love - Hate.  I go back and forth or hold both at once.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been in the situation of having my <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;behavior not liked&quot; but been told that the person &quot;loved me,&quot; and <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t actually feel <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; loved, because my behavior WAS an expression of ME.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I too have had this experience, but in my experience, the tone of <br/>
voice was saying something different than the words and what I felt <br/>
was the disconnect between the words and the acutal feelings of the <br/>
speaker. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think the second statement is a more politically correct one, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>but the first strikes me as <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more upfront and honest.  <br/>
<br/>

&quot;love&quot; even means - and final deleted my whole post, unsent, because I  <br/>
thought we&#39;d really gone beyond what is useful. Let me just say that  <br/>
if my child committed a horrible act - a rape, torture, murder, for  <br/>
example - there would still be an aspect of mother&#39;s love somewhere in  <br/>
me, but it would be a desperate kind of wishful love - wishing my  <br/>
child could be a person I could truly feel good about loving. So -  <br/>
there ya go - i used the word multiple times in the same sentence -  <br/>
meaning different things - and I think most people probably &quot;get&quot; the  <br/>
difference, so I&#39;m going to stop now.<br/>
<br/>
I think the point Sandra is making is that parents sometimes think  <br/>
unschooling means not showing any kind of disapproval of anything  <br/>
their children do, and sometimes they do absolutely everything they  <br/>
can to keep the child from actually experiencing any kind of bad  <br/>
feelings as a result of their own behavior.<br/>
<br/>
This is really not fair to the child. It is in the child&#39;s best  <br/>
interest to feel those bad feelings that arise when they do mean,  <br/>
thoughtless, out-of-control things, for example. The parents don&#39;t  <br/>
need to ADD to it by punishing the child, but they ought to help the  <br/>
child connect with that part of themselves that feels empathy for the  <br/>
person they&#39;ve hurt. And therefore parents ought to be clear about the  <br/>
behavior being problematic. Don&#39;t sit there and be all sweetness and  <br/>
smiles, saying, &quot;I love you no matter what you do,&quot; as if everything  <br/>
is just fine, when it is not.<br/>

It happens outside of homeschooling, too.  I know someone who&#39;s full- <br/>
on obnoxious, and her parents used to tell her that any problems she  <br/>
had were because she was smarter than the other kids and they were  <br/>
&quot;just jealous.&quot;    I&#39;ve had the urge to smack her, seriously.  I  <br/>
finally ran her out of my life.  I&#39;m glad she doesn&#39;t have children  <br/>
and I hope she never does.<br/>
<br/>
Her adult life would be immensely better if her parents had helped  <br/>
her learn to be nice rather than telling her there was no reason for  <br/>
her to even bother to try, because the rest of the people in the  <br/>
world were simply inferior beings.  YUCK!!<br/>

Holly  mentioned, unrelated to any of this, the other day that she&#39;s  <br/>
sorry so many parents want their kids to be diagnosed with problems  <br/>
so the parents don&#39;t have to learn to be better parents, and then the  <br/>
kids will act however they want to and say &quot;Oh, I didn&#39;t take my   <br/>
meds today&quot; as an excuse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-842738913">I agree completely, Pam.  Clearly, there&#39;s a big difference between <br/>
responding to a child when he is actually mean and thoughtless and <br/>
conversing with a child about what would happen if her were to be mean <br/>
and thoughtless.  In my own case, my child (6 y/o ds) is a boy who can <br/>
spiral into extreme emotions that are distressing to him afterward if I <br/>
do not perceive the triggers in time, though I&#39;ve now become fairly <br/>
good at that (after much trial by fire!).  As far as when he poses <br/>
hypotheticals about doing rude stuff, I will give much thought to <br/>
Sandra&#39;s opinion that these are not good conversations to have, at <br/>
least in the way we are having them.  The reason I&#39;ve thought these <br/>
conversations with ds were, at worst, neutral is that they allow him to <br/>
discuss thoughts that he might otherwise hide and/or feel guily about.  <br/>
I do not require that my child share all of his thoughts, but if the <br/>
thoughts are troubling him, and he brings them to me, I feel honored <br/>
that he would share them with me, in calm moments, for discussion.  We <br/>
also discuss the very important line between thoughts and actions.  <br/>
I&#39;ve told him many times that we&#39;d all be in jail at one time or <br/>
another if we could be arrested for our thoughts.   My childhood <br/>
contained an over-abundance of guilt, which is baggage I do not want my <br/>
child to carry.  But I also do not want to overcompensate and leave my <br/>
child feeling adrift.<br/>
I know the original topic in this thread concerned actual deeds as <br/>
opposed to thoughts, but the unconditional love aspect caught my <br/>
attention, and I&#39;m always open to fine tuning my thinking.<br/>

This pretty much sums things up for me and our situation.  We took ds <br/>
out of school because they demanded that we get a diagnosis so that <br/>
they would be ABLE to treat him the way that he needed to be treated.  <br/>
With a diagnosis they would be ABLE to make allowances for his needs <br/>
(standing and moving instead of sitting quietly, thinking out-loud <br/>
instead of silently....).  There were other factors as well, but the <br/>
point was that they were unwilling/unable to allow him to learn in the <br/>
way that best suited him; THEY needed an &quot;excuse&quot; to meet his needs and <br/>
be able to justify treating him differently.<br/>
<br/>
This also goes toward our interactions with others.  I absolutely know <br/>
that if I was to throw a diagnosis word around with other people they <br/>
would &quot;make allowances&quot; for ds&#39;s behavior at times -- which would make <br/>
things more comfortable for *ME* but would not be helpful to ds or his <br/>
process of learning respectful appropriate behavior.  I really debate <br/>
at times if getting a &quot;label&quot; would be helpful for *him* but ultimately <br/>
the goal is to be able to interact with people in meaningful and <br/>
appropriate ways and having an &quot;label&quot; wouldn&#39;t teach him anything <br/>
other than that he&#39;s &quot;different&quot; and therefore he isn&#39;t &quot;able&quot; to <br/>
control his actions.  It would go a long way toward improving *MY* <br/>
relationships with others, and maybe if others thought he had a label <br/>
they would temper their interactions which might not put him in <br/>
situations in which he feels his back is against the wall.  I really <br/>
don&#39;t know what is the &quot;right&quot; thing to do, but I DO know that by <br/>
changing my behavior and embracing unschooling principles things have <br/>
been MUCH better.  Changing the way *I* interact with him has helped to <br/>
model much more respectful behavior for him which he can take into his <br/>
own interactions and relationships.  Like I said a few days ago, it&#39;s a <br/>
lot better but still has a long way to go.<br/>

I also wanted to point out that by giving you more information here <br/>
and providing context you perhaps understand where I&#39;m coming from in <br/>
better ways.  In that way, the information (label?) is more <br/>
understandable and you can see the improvements instead of just the <br/>
problems.  So is the label useful/helpful/needed?  Would it be <br/>
helpful for us in society in general?  Perhaps.  I really don&#39;t <br/>
know.  But it would probably &quot;protect&quot; the reputation of unschooling <br/>
from those who see us and assume that it&#39;s the unschooling that has <br/>
created these issues.  I imagine that there are quite a few of us in <br/>
a similar situation who arrived at unschooling because of its <br/>
benefits, and not as an excuse for our parenting.  <br/>

Depends on the label, but I had to choose yes or no, I&#39;d say &quot;NO,&quot;  <br/>
it&#39;s better to treat Bobby as Bobby, not Bobby who&#39;s dyslexic and ADD  <br/>
or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
More damage would be done to unschooling by the labeling, I think.<br/>

behavior.<br/>
<br/>
I never had doubt of my mother&#39;s love, no matter my actions or <br/>
appearance (which can be a result of actions or non-actions). She <br/>
absolutely showed disapproval for inappropriate actions, but I felt <br/>
more that she was surprised or shocked by the action and that it was <br/>
not in line with how she viewed me.  That she thought better of me <br/>
than that and I could show her by my actions in the future.  Thus I <br/>
felt her disappointment, trust and belief.  Tools to learn from.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, my father&#39;s love was definately conditional and I <br/>
never felt any expectations, just demands, with little expectation <br/>
of success.  It was almost as if I had failed before I had started <br/>
simply because of his judgements of my behavior or appearance as all <br/>
that I was. <br/>
<br/>
I do not approve of all behavior and I express such, but I trust <br/>
that the person is doing their best at the time and given time and <br/>
information, they will improve.  I learned this first with my father.<br/>

ate a candy bar.  Lydia said she was just awful that day, pulling the<br/>

compliance?Then you are adversaries not partners. Now you have a <br/>
battle of wills ,a powerplay weather you wanted it or not. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am starting to see that a blanket statement of :when safety of the <br/>
child or another person is threatened that use of force is OK? <br/>
<br/>
What about just plain old disrespect or hurtful words like &quot;shut up&quot; <br/>
or namecalling? Does that justify force or just plain old disapproval?<br/>
<br/>
I see this as the same problem lawmakers have in our country. Laws <br/>
are made to protect everyone&#39;s civil liberties, but at some point <br/>
protecting one person&#39;s civil liberty often means stepping on <br/>
another&#39;s. At what point does a racial insult become freedom of <br/>
speach and vice versa?  When does that become any insult against a <br/>
person is illegal, especially the president? At what point does a <br/>
person take responsibility for falling of a curb and breaking thier <br/>
ankle or should the town be held accountable? <br/>
<br/>
It really seems to get down to no more than a personal judgement <br/>
call, and yes that does leave the book wide open to interpret it just <br/>
about any way you like. I know someone who believes it is an unloving <br/>
act NOT to punish her children with a paddle because they must learn <br/>
obiedience to their parents and to God.Is that child abuse or her <br/>
civil right to choose as her religon dictates, especially if she <br/>
truly believes not spanking them will send both them and her to hell. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748417540">i am not sure what this means, and still haven&#39;t really figured out what *i* think about how i&#39;d like to translate this into action, but several years ago, my daughter (now 13) said to me &quot;i don&#39;t WANT you to love me just because you&#39;re my mom - i want you to love me because i am ME!&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
she was basically wanting to know how i saw HER - WHAT i loved about HER.  and she specifically challenged me with &quot;what if i killed someone?!&quot; (not something she would ever do, not even a guilty thought, i am sure - just that she was trying to think of the most horrendous thing she could to challenge my (perhaps misplaced, still not sure what i think about that) unconditional love....)<br/>
<br/>
i have been mulling those sentiments over for 2-3 years now!  and trying to be very aware of showing her my love in personal ways - unconditional in the sense of reaching through her anger, or other &quot;difficult&quot; emotions, when those occur- not rejecting the &quot;dark side&quot;  - but reaching through it - not around it, not ignoring it - and still trying to make sure that my love is expressed (and felt) as personal/connected to her as an individual, not just &quot;my daughter.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
just thought i&#39;d share that perspective from her when she was about 10-11 - i had never really scrutinized the concept of unconditional love before she brought it up, so insightfully...<br/>

That doesn&#39;t answer the question.<br/>
<br/>
If someone never told a child he could do anything on earth he wanted  <br/>
to, then he should have no expectation that he can.<br/>
<br/>
If someone DID tell a child something like that, then she&#39;s created  <br/>
her own terrible problem and it&#39;s going to need some repair that  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have been necessary if she&#39;d been her child&#39;s partner in the  <br/>

personal/connected to her as an individual, not just &quot;my daughter.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is a perfect window into the problem of &quot;unconditional love,&quot;  <br/>
expressed as it sometimes is, discussed as it often is.<br/>
<br/>
Then come other reactionary things to that concept, like &quot;tough  <br/>
love.&quot;  When there&#39;s a theory or movement that gets a name like that,  <br/>
people start looking at the name instead of the feelings and responses.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like the problem with pointing and saying look, and people are  <br/>
looking at your finger.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents say, out loud in words, &quot;I love all my children  <br/>
equally.&quot;   Why say something like that?  It invites challenge.<br/>
Some parents say &quot;I loved you before you were born and I&#39;ll always  <br/>
love you.&quot;  Maybe that&#39;s an attempt to express the biochemical  <br/>
changes that come upon a pregnant woman (and they&#39;re BIGtime real,  <br/>
when they work well) and that infuse a healthy relationship with a  <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it gets confused with Bible ideas, like &quot;I love you as  <br/>
Christ love the church&quot; (marriage problem sometimes).  If a couple  <br/>
has a fullblown Baptist wedding and then they stop being religious,  <br/>
THEN what is the basis of the relationship?  And DOES Christ love the  <br/>
church?  (And which church? &lt;bwg&gt;)  Unconditionally?  &lt;HUGEbwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If when a child wants reassurance of love the parent quotes the  <br/>
Bible, the condition seems to be &quot;If the Bible is true, then I love  <br/>
you.&quot;<br/>

not understand that, though. That&#39;s when I think it&#39;s important that <br/>

<br/>
BTW, I want to make it clear that I was not disagreeing that a child <br/>

I agree.<br/>
<br/>
There is an element of  &quot;you&#39;re getting warm&quot; and &quot;you&#39;re getting  <br/>
cold,&quot; though.  And some parents DO have a way of rejecting a child  <br/>
outright for small offenses.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With me and my friends, it&#39;s like warm and cold have 100 little  <br/>
steps.  I can be really angry that Ben stood me up, but still love  <br/>
Ben.  I know him; he forgets.  If I get really mad, it&#39;s because I  <br/>
had unrealistic expectations of Ben.  If Keith stood me up, I&#39;d be  <br/>
sure he was in an accident, because I know Keith and he&#39;ll be where  <br/>
he says he&#39;ll be, when he said he would be.  It&#39;s one of his best  <br/>
traits.<br/>
<br/>
And so with our children, if we know them well, we can know what to  <br/>
expect, know their strengths and weaknesses.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No--if you follow the line of reasoning, then if you disapprove of or reject a behavior, you <br/>
are rejecting that behavior--which is an extension of that personality acting on the world.  <br/>
It doesn&#39;t represent the whole person--just a part.  My point was that you can&#39;t separate <br/>
behavior from the person as though the behavior was just some random event, just as <br/>
likely to occur as not occur.  The behavior came from thoughts and feelings and is an <br/>
expression of those.  Sometimes we even behave in ways that don&#39;t work on purpose in <br/>
order to call attention to those thoughts and feelings and get help and support in letting <br/>
them go.  Sometimes we just can&#39;t figure out a better way.<br/>
<br/>
If there is motivation in the relationship, then the person will adjust their behavior to find <br/>
ways of expressing themselves that work better in the social world in which they live.  It&#39;s <br/>
just what we do as humans who have bonds with others and wish to maintain and <br/>
strenghten those bonds.<br/>

families do things.  In the home of one family we know, kids are not allowed<br/>
to stand up on any furniture, including the couch.  In our home, she is<br/>
basically allowed to stand on any piece of furniture (including the dining<br/>
table, which I&#39;ve seen appall and offend some people), as long as it seems<br/>
safe.  She actually likes knowing that at their house no one stands on the<br/>
couch, and very carefully doesn&#39;t do it there, and then talks about how she<br/>
didn&#39;t.<br/>
In another family we know, even the littlest children drink coffee, whereas<br/>
in our family, children don&#39;t.<br/>

this.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>random event, just as <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; likely to occur as not occur.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not sure I totally agree with this. I think there might be many <br/>
behaviors that are basic human nature that don&#39;t have anything to do <br/>
with the individual person or personality. One type of personality <br/>
may be more likely to exhibit the behavior sooner but that doesn&#39;t <br/>
make the behavior, itself, part of the personality. <br/>
<br/>
Take hitting, for example. I&#39;ve never known or heard of a child who <br/>
never hit anyone or anything. Hitting is basic defense mechanism. <br/>
The ability and feeling of need to hit is in us all. I have seen <br/>
with my own children that some are more quick to hit than others. <br/>
That&#39;s part of the child&#39;s personality, the impulsiveness about it. <br/>
So, I accept the child&#39;s impulsiveness. I don&#39;t reject that. I don&#39;t <br/>
compare him to his brother (I have all boys) and tell him he should <br/>
be more like the brother who&#39;s not as quick to hit. I understand <br/>
that he may need more of my time and attention and energy to find <br/>
ways to deal without hitting. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just thinking out loud here so I&#39;m not sure I agree totally with <br/>
what I&#39;m saying here, either. It&#39;s all very complex. I appreciate <br/>
the discussion of ideas.<br/>

&gt; i have been mulling those sentiments over for 2-3 years now!  and trying to<br/>

&gt; those occur- not rejecting the &quot;dark side&quot;  - but reaching through it - not<br/>

&gt; expressed (and felt) as personal/connected to her as an individual, not just<br/>
&gt; &quot;my daughter.&quot;<br/>

Horrendous tempers run in both my and DH&#39;s families. People who break<br/>
things, throw things, get in fights, end up in jail. Clearly, not a lot of<br/>
good management skills there. =)<br/>
<br/>
When DH and I met, he was considered by our mutual social group to be<br/>
&quot;scary&quot;. And having grown up in a very rough neighborhood, he projected<br/>
that, as a &quot;leave me alone&quot; thing. &quot;Fear me!&quot; was the message. And because<br/>
of my own history, I wasn&#39;t a lot different. People were... concerned, when<br/>
we got together. &quot;It&#39;s like nitro dating glycerine!&quot; one friend exclaimed,<br/>
&quot;and this can&#39;t end well!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The first time we had a squabble, sure enough, we both puffed like prairie<br/>
chickens. I imagine it was pretty funny from the outside. And what we both<br/>
realized was that it was a test... sure, I&#39;m playing scary, but do *you*<br/>
fear me? Am I really scary? Have I scared you? And then we realized that you<br/>
don&#39;t test the people you love. When you love people, you just say &quot;I feel<br/>
scary and mean and I need reassuring&quot; and the people who love you say &quot;well<br/>
sure you&#39;re stomping around and acting fearsome; how can I help? What do you<br/>
really need?&quot; and usually, it&#39;s just a matter of a clearly-stated need, and<br/>
a heartfelt response.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve both mellowed hugely, just because finally, we don&#39;t have to escallate<br/>
just to be heard. The trust about being really listened to is there, so<br/>
neither of us feel the need to reach for the antics of our<br/>
emotionally-fraught youths.<br/>
<br/>
The first time Rowan &quot;threw a tantrum&quot; (I hate that word, but I&#39;m not sure<br/>
what else to call it), we hung out with him, reassured him that we were<br/>
right there for him once he worked out the crazies, and just stayed in the<br/>
space. He wasn&#39;t scary, he was just having big emotions. I think he had one<br/>
other tantrum, ever. Same deal with Kestrel... his first major tantrum (he<br/>
was little, probably 18-19 months or so), my MiL was visiting. Kes is a far<br/>
more intense kid than Rowan, and his tantrum was pretty spectacular. I took<br/>
him into a quiet, darkened room, removed sharp objects and corners, and let<br/>
him go for it, while sitting quietly with him until he wound down. He threw<br/>
things (I handed him stuffed animals and pillows and stuff), he headbanged<br/>
into the bed, he screamed like he was being tortured. That took about 20<br/>
minutes. He eventually sobbed to a stop, crawled into my lap, and wanted to<br/>
nurse and just be held and reassured. My MiL commented &quot;I don&#39;t know how you<br/>
didn&#39;t hit him.&quot; And yet... here we were, totally together, trust intact.<br/>
She couldn&#39;t see it. Go fig. Kes had I think two or three more of those, but<br/>
at nearly three, seems to be pretty much done.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re just big emotions, and everyone feels big and ugly and scary and<br/>
mean sometimes. I think that if we, as parents and partners, can just hold<br/>
the attitude that &quot;you&#39;re not scary, you&#39;re just moving through the big<br/>
stuff, and I&#39;m here for you, cause I did exactly the same thing once and<br/>
here I am on the other side&quot;, the whole thing loses its power.<br/>

I think it&#39;s that biochemisty is fast on the adrenaline surge.  I  <br/>
know people that way.  I&#39;m not as bad as some, but bad.  Kirby is  <br/>
too.  So we helped Kirby, specifically, learn ways to feel it and  <br/>
counteract it.  I guess that&#39;s a self-management skill.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have some other friends that you could be poking their faces and  <br/>
insulting their mothers and stepping on their toes and they&#39;d still  <br/>
be totally rational and non-emotional.   One is an assistant district  <br/>
attorney.  GOOD TRAIT for that job!!! Perfect.  One used to be an air  <br/>
traffic controller.  Now he works at the post office.  No danger of  <br/>
him shooting the joint up.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve had two tantrums as an adult.  Both had witnesses.  Nobody hit  <br/>
me, thank God, and they were both for good reasons, and everyone  <br/>
involved knew it, and they stayed close and listened but let me yell  <br/>
it out and I cried until my abdomen ached all kinds of ways, and then  <br/>
I was all better.  It was a little like puking when you&#39;re food  <br/>
poisoned.  It was like my biochemistry was all filled up with  <br/>
poisonous overload and I had to get it out.<br/>
<br/>
Once was before I had kids, and I drove home three miles or so and  <br/>
then came in screaming and crying, and Keith followed me into the  <br/>
bedroom where I throw myself across and wailed.  I hadn&#39;t taken five  <br/>
or six breaths deep enough to wail again when I heard the friend  who  <br/>
had pissed me off come to the door.  He had jumped in the car and  <br/>
followed me, to apologize and to make sure I was okay.  That didn&#39;t  <br/>
suck.  And he had grabbed a rose from the big rosebush by his door, too.<br/>
<br/>
I heard Keith say &quot;I don&#39;t think she wants to talk yet,&quot; or some  <br/>
such, and I heard their voices through my crying and (literally)  <br/>
biting the edge of the mattress because I didn&#39;t want him to hear me  <br/>
crying but I was still seriously furious.  Keith brought me the  <br/>
rose.  It was white, and big.  And I&#39;m still friends with the guy to  <br/>
this day.<br/>
<br/>
The second time was after I had kids, but they weren&#39;t home.  Two  <br/>
friends were with me, cooking, and a third came to tell me something  <br/>
because she wanted me to know as soon as possible.  It was a social  <br/>
think, unrecoverable, very frustrating for me, and she knew I would  <br/>
be crushed.  She didn&#39;t come to crush me, she came to let me get it  <br/>
out while I was home, before the three of us drove over to the site  <br/>
and I found out in front of 150 people.  It was good.  The three  <br/>
people who saw me blow totally understood.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases, had I had someone there to say &quot;breathe&quot; in the moment  <br/>
I was processing the information before I went into &quot;kill&quot; mode (or  <br/>
if I had thought to breathe myself) and thought to take a really long  <br/>
slow deep-as-possible breath, I wouldn&#39;t have had the toxic  <br/>
uncontrollable overload.<br/>
<br/>
So with younger kids who don&#39;t know the world so well, whose time  <br/>
perspective is still like a day is a year and a week is forever, who  <br/>
aren&#39;t quite sure of permanence and frequency and distance, little  <br/>
things can easily be overwhelming.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is good for me to hear right now ... about two weeks ago we were <br/>
at an open gym and another couple of kids were there that my son has a <br/>
*history* with, one in particular that has pretty consistently started <br/>
things with my son and then, in my opinion, played innocent so that his <br/>
mom sided with him.  I have tried to keep an open mind and walk the <br/>
fine line of validating my son&#39;s feelings and not being okay with <br/>
aggressive/violent actions and trying to keep the other boy&#39;s <br/>
perspective in mind.  At this open gym event however the boy and <br/>
another child were really antagonizing my son and his friends, I tried <br/>
to give my son some coaching, and I started sticking close by as it <br/>
seemed like things were getting more heated, but the other kids just <br/>
kept running up and randomly hitting them with these foam things until <br/>
my son actually got hurt when one got him in the eye.  When my son got <br/>
hurt he flew into a rage and I had to physically hold him back as he <br/>
flailed and screamed (I have never seen him get mad like that at <br/>
someone outside of our immediate family).  If I hadn&#39;t held him back he <br/>
would have physically injured the other boy ... it would not have been <br/>
helpful to either one of them if I had stood aside and let that <br/>
happen.  So, yes, I used force on my child.  But after he had calmed <br/>
down enough, and we talked a little and he was able to walk away and go <br/>
back to playing with his friends, then I went over to the other two <br/>
kids, and in a voice I rarely even use with my own children told them <br/>
that what they were doing was not cool and it had to stop now, and it <br/>
was NOT okay to keep hitting and antagonizing my son and his friends.  <br/>
I do not like to step in for another child&#39;s parent, but I felt that I <br/>
really needed to let my son know that even though it wasn&#39;t okay to <br/>
physically fight with or scream abuse at the other boy, I was still on <br/>
his side, I wasn&#39;t going to just sit there and keep telling him to turn <br/>
the other cheek, in essence saying that it was okay for the other kids <br/>
to behave and treat him inappropriately / disrespectfully.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, these threads have been so perfect for me, because I have found <br/>
myself over the last couple of weeks realiving the entire episode, <br/>
wondering over and over if it happened again would I handle it the same <br/>
way?  Of course, I can&#39;t know for sure, but reading other folks <br/>
thoughts on these subjects has really helped me to clarify my own <br/>
thinking and feel more okay with the force I did use on my child and <br/>
way I talked to the other kids.  I can&#39;t imagine that I ever would just <br/>
let my kid beat another kid up because he *deserved* it, but I have to <br/>
admit that thought came to me often ... My son has a good heart though, <br/>
I don&#39;t think that he would have been very happy with himself if I had <br/>
let him do that.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, I guess that I am still mulling it over ... thinking <br/>
about how things played out, if there was anything I could have done to <br/>
keep it from happening, etc.  No real questions, but I get such great <br/>
insight from these lists, from folks who see things that I haven&#39;t <br/>
noticed, that I felt compelled to post.  <br/>

How was that &quot;stepping in for another child&#39;s parent&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I was with you until you started to explain (I think) that you did it  <br/>
so your son would see that you weren&#39;t approving of the other boys&#39;  <br/>
behavior.  Is that why you talked to them?<br/>
<br/>
(You don&#39;t have to answer.   I&#39;m asking more so you&#39;ll think about  <br/>
it, but if you want to clarify, that&#39;s cool too.)<br/>
