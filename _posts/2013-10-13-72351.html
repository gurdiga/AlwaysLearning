<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039246260">Each Wednesday (most Wednesdays) there is a chat on a particular topic.  They go fast, they tumble and roll over, we keep them on topic, and some people don&#39;t like the speed or the focus.   Other people LOVE it.<br/>
<br/>
The chats are saved and edited and are (kind of obscure) resources for years to come. which is another reason to keep them on topic.  Ideas are examined quickly. :-)<br/>

There&#39;s the announcement for October 16th&#39;s chat.  It&#39;s noon to 2:00 pm at my house (Mountain Standard time, usually GMT+7) so it&#39;s a bad time some places and a great time for others. <br/>
<br/>
If you think you might be interested in a future chat, when you&#39;re at the blog linked above, you can subscribe to announcements of chats.  <br/>
<br/>
You can read transcripts of some former chats, which are being gathered into one big list, gradually, but aren&#39;t finished yet, if you want a peek at what they can be like.<br/>
