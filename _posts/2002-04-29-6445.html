 </span></blockquote>I am a closet &quot;Oprah&quot; fan -- if I can get the kids off the Game Cube, that<br/>
is &lt;g&gt;  Awhile back, she had a show about careers, following dreams, etc.,<br/>
which included Dawna Markova on the panel of experts.  That caught my<br/>
attention, since she&#39;d been a keynote speaker at a homeschooling conference<br/>
I attended.  She or one of the other guests suggested you think about what<br/>
you wanted to be when you grew up when you were 10 years old, that that<br/>
would give you the best idea of what you truly should do.<br/>
<br/>
I was obsessed with horses from birth, it seems, but as far as 10-y.o.<br/>
vocations, I wanted to be a Seeing Eye Dog trainer.  At 12, I wanted to be<br/>
either a vet or a jockey.  My loathing of math (prerequisite for all the<br/>
science classes) killed the vet idea, and I&#39;m so danged old, no women WERE<br/>
jockeys back then.  Besides, my mom wouldn&#39;t let me.<br/>
<br/>
My dh wanted to be an astronaut &lt;g&gt;  (When he graduated from high school, he<br/>
wanted to be a rock star.  He&#39;s now back in community college, working on an<br/>
AA in anything.  Reality bites.  He *is* doing stuff with music still, but<br/>
not on the rock star level.)<br/>
<br/>
I went to college as an English major, immediately switched to<br/>
Communications (which seemed to lead to jobs other than teaching &lt;g&gt;), and a<br/>
year and a half later, switched to Art/graphic design.  I didn&#39;t keep pace<br/>
with the Computer Revolution, so I&#39;m a cut-and-paste dinosaur.  I have a Mac<br/>
G4 computer as of yesterday, so I have no more excuses.<br/>
<br/>
At 43, I&#39;ve come back &#39;round in some ways; though I don&#39;t train Seeing Eye<br/>
dogs, I do train my pet dogs.  I&#39;m back with horses now, as well: I work for<br/>
an equestrian therapy program 3 days a week.  Somebody *pays* me to ride<br/>
:-)))  <br/>
<br/>
If I had to guess what my kids will do, based on their current interests, it<br/>
would involve staring at a screen all day pushing buttons.  Wait, that&#39;s<br/>
what *I&#39;m* doing -- although their buttons are making virtual skateboarders<br/>
wipe out.<br/>

At ten I wanted to be a teacher.  I had decided four years prior to that.  <br/>

by far the oldest employee there).  I made straight A&#39;s, but don&#39;t remember <br/>
learning one single thing all year.  I remember much quiet and stillness.<br/>

Holly&#39;s ten.  She says she wants to make balloon animals at Ci-Ci&#39;s pizza.  <br/>
(She already has a pump, and knows how to make several kinds of balloon <br/>
animals and hats.)   She says she wants to do that when she&#39;s a teenager.  <br/>

 <br/>
I just had to respond to this because all of my kids spent time in a<br/>
circus club locally.  At some point someone in the club gave me a phone<br/>
number for a local clown who had some unicycles for sale.  We didn&#39;t buy<br/>
the unicyles, but got the best advice from this clown regarding face<br/>
painting and balloon sculptures.  Thought I&#39;d pass it on to you if you<br/>
don&#39;t already know.  The absolute best balloon sculpture books are the<br/>
Captain Visual books, especially the first one (not the holiday one).<br/>
There is also a best brand of balloons, but I don&#39;t have the name off<br/>
hand.  Face painting, which my 10 yo daughter likes even better, was<br/>
where we really got the best stuff.  She sold us an ungodly expensive<br/>
set of Snazaroo face paints, but my daughter now does the most amazing<br/>
full-face painting jobs.  People are amazed when they see what she can<br/>
do, and I always tell them it&#39;s not that she&#39;s that talented - the<br/>
secret is in the high quality face paints.  Your daughter might really<br/>
enjoy their website:  HYPERLINK<br/>
&quot;http://www.snazaroo.com&quot;www.snazaroo.com  But be warned, once you go on<br/>
this web site, expect to be there a long time!<br/>

shipping (the Torker is the best buy), and there&#39;s no point in worrying<br/>
about having anybody teach her how.  You pretty much have to figure it<br/>
out.  I did find with all of my kids that they were likely to give up on<br/>
learning and say they just didn&#39;t really like unicycling until they had<br/>
a breakthrough and got the hang of it.  Then they all LOVED to unicycle!<br/>
