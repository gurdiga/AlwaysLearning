<div id="ygrps-yiv-2127272084">Hello, all.  First of all, I&#39;m speaking from the heart and I hope <br/>
someone out there in the homeschool community has walked in my shoes <br/>
and I&#39;m hoping can give me some incredible words of wisdom to help me <br/>
deal with my inner conflict.  I have a 9 year-old dyslexic son who is <br/>
really having an obvious difficult time in reading.  I have a 12 year-<br/>
old austic son who at times can be extremely overwhelming with his <br/>
needs.  I also have a 2 year old toddler whom I can&#39;t devote that <br/>
much time too because I have my hands full with my autistic son.  I <br/>
am unschooling them but at the same time I find myself so conflicted <br/>
with their needs and the way I&#39;m dealing with getting their needs <br/>
met.  I am paying out of pocket for my dyslexic son to learn how to <br/>
read and it&#39;s costing me a fortune but I find I have no choice or do <br/>
I?  How do unschoolers deal with dyslexic children?  I&#39;m just <br/>
wondering if parents with children with special disabilities <br/>
unschool, and how they go about dealing with their special needs.  I <br/>
find myself so conflicted thinking about what I could do if I enroll <br/>
them in the public school system but don&#39;t want to because I choose <br/>
unschool.  Any words of wisdom please would be greatly appreciated.  <br/>
No browbeating please as I find I do that myself repeatedly with my <br/>
inner conflict.  I apologize in advance if I offend anyone b ut I <br/>
simply need wisdom from parents who have been in this situation.  <br/>
Thank you.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; really having an obvious difficult time in reading. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry you are having such a hard time.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that you pull your 9 yo out of what ever reading program he is in <br/>
today, even if you can&#39;t get a refund. Not one single more class. I would go <br/>
so far as to apologise to him for not trusting him to come to reading on his <br/>
own terms, at his own pace. Let him know that it was your mistake, not his, <br/>
to put him into that class.<br/>
<br/>
Surely you know that we will tell you to let go of the label of dyslexic as <br/>
irrelevant to unschooling. Dyslexia is only relevant within a schooling <br/>
timetable. Reading at any age is only relevant withing a schooling <br/>
timetable.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you are paying for your son to learn to read. You are paying <br/>
someone to engage in a daily (or whenever the lessons are) struggle with <br/>
your son, a daily message for him that there is something wrong with him.<br/>
<br/>
Just letting go of that fear, and being ready just to read to him whenever <br/>
he wants it, when you can, including quickly translating the message on the <br/>
computer screen of his game, will go a long way towards lifing some of your <br/>
stress. It will take a while, but eventually the &quot;I&#39;m stupid/reading sucks&quot; <br/>
feelings he probably lives with in his heart will fade away. The experience <br/>
of unschoolers is that damage heals, and reading happens.<br/>
<br/>
Watching a child learning to read in their own way is fascinating. Is my <br/>
daughter dyslexic? I honestly don&#39;t know and couldn&#39;t care less. But she is <br/>
9 in 9 days, and on her merry way to reading.<br/>

you&#39;re asking him to be able to read now with a reading difference  <br/>
when many 9 yos can&#39;t without.<br/>

from the atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
Dyslexic kids tend to take longer to figure out reading in their own  <br/>
unique way. If he were in school, that would be a problem. Schools  <br/>
want everyone reading independently by 4th grade so of course schools  <br/>
channel kids who aren&#39;t on that track into special programs. (That  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean the programs get the kids reading by 4th grade of course!)<br/>

But you can also try typing in autistic/autism and dyslexic/dyslexia  <br/>
into the archives of several unschooling lists to see how unschoolers  <br/>
approach differences. I&#39;m sorry some of the more intense issues can&#39;t  <br/>
get lots of immediate responses, but the archives should help:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784578263">-=-How do unschoolers deal with dyslexic children? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t &quot;deal with&quot; any of my children.  One would&#39;ve been called  <br/>
dyslexic if a school could get some money out of doing that or a  <br/>
teacher could count him in a different category so her stats looked  <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t ever use the term dyslexic (he heard it a couple of  years  <br/>
ago and said &quot;you think I am?&quot; when he was 17 years old or so).  He  <br/>
learned to read and write the same way any other unschooled child  <br/>
did--gradually and in his own way.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/reading">http://sandradodd.com/reading</a><br/>
Lots of people&#39;s stories are there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am paying out of pocket for my dyslexic son to learn how to<br/>
read and it&#39;s costing me a fortune but I find I have no choice or do<br/>
I?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly not unschooling to do that.  I hope you&#39;ll stop right  <br/>
away, as Robyn recommended.  If you bought a dozen donuts and decided  <br/>
you only wanted three, would you finish the others off anyway?   It&#39;s  <br/>
already cost you the same as a dozen.  Eating more would be  <br/>
harmful.   Let it go.<br/>
<br/>
As to whether you have a choice or not, yes.  You *always* have a  <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I hope someone out there in the homeschool community has walked in  <br/>
my shoes and I&#39;m hoping can give me some incredible words of wisdom  <br/>
to help me -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are over 1000 people on this list.  Don&#39;t limit yourself to  <br/>
asking for feedback just from those who have &quot;walked in your shoes.&quot;   <br/>
Perhaps there were better ways to have walked, and you could do  <br/>
better with your third child.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I simply need wisdom from parents who have been in this situation.  <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
It very often happens that people come to lists like this thinking  <br/>
they know exactly what they need, and thinking it will be simple, but  <br/>
what they need  more than anything is to move more surely toward  <br/>
unschooling, and other things will fall into place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386827224">You think I should apologize for not trusting him?  Wow.  I love my <br/>
son with all of my heart, and I really want the best for him.  When <br/>
he writes me notes and writes everything backwards, and when I read <br/>
to him and he asks me why he can&#39;t read it, saying he wants to learn <br/>
to read and that I do something to help him, what can I do as a <br/>
parent?  I try to do the best I can for him and read constantly to <br/>
him as much as I can, but I&#39;m frankly overwhelmed and I don&#39;t know <br/>
how to teach someone to not read backwards.  I&#39;m not specialized in <br/>
that area and I can&#39;t apologize for seeking help for him when it&#39;s <br/>
something he wants and is requesting.  Yeah, maybe you&#39;re suggestion <br/>
is correct and I should take him out of his tutoring and I guess I&#39;ll <br/>
just have to see what happens with time that everything will fall <br/>
into place naturally as everything is a learning experience even <br/>
writing on this board and learning different perspectives is an <br/>
incredible mind opening experience.  My main goal as his parent is <br/>
that I simply don&#39;t want him stressing out, but I can&#39;t help feeling <br/>
internally stressed seeing him unhappy, but I guess that&#39;s where my <br/>
conflict is. I want to let things be and come naturally but when he <br/>
seems so upset with himself, I want to help him in any way I can.  I <br/>
was simply seeking a perspective from a parent who has been in this <br/>
situation. I will do research on the suggestions provided by Ms. Dodd <br/>
as well as others who have posted to my post, which I appreciate and <br/>
thank you in advance.  <br/>

Here&#39;s another thing.  Channel some of that money that would have gone<br/>
toward academic stuff (unless it&#39;s completely gone) toward finding a<br/>
teenager who could be a mom&#39;s helper (like 1 or 2 days a week) with your 2<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-428460896">Since Zac did go to school and did receive a diagnosis of Severe Dyslexia - the whole reason we pulled him out of school at age 8.5 and chose to home school was to give him the gift of time.  <br/>
<br/>
I would say that total unschooling was the key to helping our (dyslexic) son. We gave him many opportunities for rich and varied experiences as well supporting any passions or interests - strewing was also important.<br/>
<br/>
He is 14 now and it seems that he is reading well.  I can say that he reads what he wants to.  He can read and play games and very lengthy game guides.  He is passionate about Japanese Manga - this was the door to reading books for him.  They are books written in a comic book fashion.  He can read the backs of movies to rent.  He has begun reading the intro news page to Road Runner our internet provider - I know this because he will often mention some news item he has read.  He can look things up on eBay, the internet, Google for information, etc.  The other day he rented a movie at Block Buster - watched it in the middle of the night and told me later that it was in Japanese and he had to keep pausing it to read the sub-titles.  So given that, I would say he can read.  I never ask him to read to me, so to say he can read such and such - I really have no idea. ;)   I just see it (reading) in his everyday living.<br/>
<br/>
He may never read a novel - who knows?  My 2 sisters who are not dyslexic in any way, never read novels - they love magazines.  One is a pediatric head nurse at a children&#39;s hospital and one is an interior architect.<br/>
<br/>
Games were the first lead into his desire to read.  RuneScape was the beginning of his working at it because he wanted to.  His dad and I spent hours sitting close by so we could spell for him when he asked.  We&#39;d sit in a chair and read close to where he was playing and he would ask when he wanted help.  Eventually he got into various other games where he wanted independence and would work at the reading - that led to reading game guides, etc.  We got him an item called a Spelling Ace that gave him more independence. Then he found the Manga books and became passionate about reading those.  The manga fits with his passion for the Anime shows and movies he likes.  He is making a Japanese Samurai armor for his Halloween costume this year.<br/>
<br/>
I keep talking about his independence - that came from within himself not something we forced upon him.  He just began to stay home more to play games when we ran errands, etc. and that led to his wanting to be more successful on his own.  He will still call us on our cell phones to ask how to spell a word. ;)<br/>

<br/>
Granted, Rowan is six, not nine, but the principle applies.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I try to do the best I can for him and read constantly to<br/>
&gt; him as much as I can, but I&#39;m frankly overwhelmed and I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; how to teach someone to not read backwards.<br/>
<br/>
Stop teaching. Breathe. Start just enjoying together. Who says he has<br/>
to read now?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I&#39;m not specialized in<br/>
&gt; that area and I can&#39;t apologize for seeking help for him when it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; something he wants and is requesting.<br/>
<br/>
Why does he think he needs it? Why isn&#39;t he comfy learning in his own time?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; incredible mind opening experience.  My main goal as his parent is<br/>
&gt; that I simply don&#39;t want him stressing out, but I can&#39;t help feeling<br/>
&gt; internally stressed seeing him unhappy, but I guess that&#39;s where my<br/>
&gt; conflict is. I want to let things be and come naturally but when he<br/>
&gt; seems so upset with himself, I want to help him in any way I can.<br/>
<br/>
Why is he upset with himself? Maybe sharing stories of other kids who<br/>
learned later, and just fine, might help.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 I<br/>
&gt; was simply seeking a perspective from a parent who has been in this<br/>
&gt; situation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m entirely positive Rowan would get a diagnosis if I subjected him<br/>
to people who did things like diagnose kids, instead of recognizing<br/>
their strengths and not worrying so much about their weaknesses.<br/>

Good idea!<br/>

Doesn&#39;t even need to be a teenager, if there&#39;s a ten or twelve year  <br/>
old girl who likes kids, or a boy who could come and hang around with  <br/>
your middle kid and play.  Pay them $3 or $4 an hour to be there  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-451241003">It sounds like your son has a preconceived idea that he should be<br/>
reading right now.  It&#39;s worth examining.  Exactly why does he stress<br/>
so much about not being able to read?  What are the outside stressors<br/>
that are causing him negative feelings?  I doubt he came to those on<br/>
his own.  I&#39;m guessing if the tutoring isn&#39;t helping his reading, then<br/>
it isn&#39;t helping his emotional state either.  Who is he comparing<br/>
himself to?  If there is no basis for comparison than there is no<br/>
reason to feel badly not reading.  <br/>
<br/>
He may have asked for tutoring because it may have been the only<br/>
option presented to him.  If you trust him to come to reading on his<br/>
own, he may in turn trust himself to come to reading on his own.  If<br/>
you stop stressing out over it, it would help him to stop stressing<br/>
out over it.  Reading to him is one of the best and most enjoyable<br/>
things you can do to help him.  I&#39;m sure a search of the archives will<br/>
give you lots of other ideas to.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that the term dyslexia has no merit in unschooling.  However,<br/>
not all agree.  Even further, I tend to not use labels at all.  But if<br/>
you must, I think saying he is dyslexic child sounds permanent and<br/>
judging.  It sounds like you are saying that he is dyslexia, and that<br/>
the dyslexia owns him.  But if you said he is a child who happens to<br/>
have dyslexia, it gives a whole new connotation.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sorry you are having such a hard time.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I suggest that you pull your 9 yo out of what ever reading program <br/>
&gt; he is in <br/>
&gt; &gt; today, even if you can&#39;t get a refund. Not one single more class. I <br/>
&gt; would go <br/>
&gt; &gt; so far as to apologise to him for not trusting him to come to <br/>
&gt; reading on his <br/>
&gt; &gt; own terms, at his own pace. Let him know that it was your mistake, <br/>
&gt; not his, <br/>
&gt; &gt; to put him into that class.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Surely you know that we will tell you to let go of the label of <br/>
&gt; dyslexic as <br/>
&gt; &gt; irrelevant to unschooling. Dyslexia is only relevant within a <br/>
&gt; schooling <br/>
&gt; &gt; timetable. Reading at any age is only relevant withing a schooling <br/>
&gt; &gt; timetable.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think you are paying for your son to learn to read. You are <br/>
&gt; paying <br/>
&gt; &gt; someone to engage in a daily (or whenever the lessons are) struggle <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; your son, a daily message for him that there is something wrong <br/>
&gt; with him.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just letting go of that fear, and being ready just to read to him <br/>
&gt; whenever <br/>
&gt; &gt; he wants it, when you can, including quickly translating the <br/>
&gt; message on the <br/>
&gt; &gt; computer screen of his game, will go a long way towards lifing some <br/>
&gt; of your <br/>
&gt; &gt; stress. It will take a while, but eventually the &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; stupid/reading sucks&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; feelings he probably lives with in his heart will fade away. The <br/>
&gt; experience <br/>
&gt; &gt; of unschoolers is that damage heals, and reading happens.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Watching a child learning to read in their own way is fascinating. <br/>
&gt; Is my <br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter dyslexic? I honestly don&#39;t know and couldn&#39;t care less. <br/>
&gt; But she is <br/>
&gt; &gt; 9 in 9 days, and on her merry way to reading.<br/>

There are many ways where a parent believes they are showing love, many <br/>

are not moving towards unschooling.<br/>

What matters for the purpose of discussion here is whether a parent is <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1604209084">Ok Im sorry I havent read all of the replies . How old is your autistic child? <br/>
<br/>
I have dyslexia and my 9 year old has signs of having dyslexia. I also have 7 seven year old severly autistic, non verbal son. .... an incredibly cute 5 year old daughter, who was born premature and according to her kindergarten teacher has issues with listening and following directions the first time lol . <br/>
<br/>
As far as your dyslexic son. Ive seen many replies already that gave good advice. <br/>
My daughter is reading but has tons of trouble reading out loud and with writing and spelling . As she asks I spell things or write things down for her. When Im not sure if something is right I use tools like dictionary.com and spell checker on the computer. Ive seen her use these before after watching me use them. <br/>
<br/>
I want to ask you to think about something and try something. There are illiterate adults and literacy programs for illiterate adults. These programs generaly get an adult reading within 3-4 months. <br/>
<br/>
He is only 9 right? Can you try just making his life rich and full of fun stuff to do and stop the reading lessons. Dont mention reading just be with him. watch movies, go skateboard, tv shows, pokemon tournaments, dragon, con play world of warcraft or the x-box, whatever his intrests are go do it. <br/>
<br/>
Dd and I sometimes play &quot;reading vacation&quot; we try to go throught our day without reading ..............its really hard to do lol. <br/>
<br/>
If he asks you to read to him real to him same for spelling or writing for him. <br/>
<br/>
Whats the worst thing that can happen after 9 years of no reading instruction??<br/>

<h4>Harold & Melissa Ross at 2008-10-08 08:08:16 +0300 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021271368">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
	First, a brief intro.  I am a 2nd generation homeschooler of five <br/>
children ranging in ages 5-14.  I was homeschooled with the traditional <br/>
method (Abeka, Bob Jones, Alpha Omega, etc.) and make my parents a bit <br/>
nervous by unschooling :)  I joined this e-group recently and have <br/>
enjoyed reading the conversations.  I esp. like Sandra&#39;s &#39;shoot from <br/>
the hip/straightforward&#39; style of &quot;talking&quot;. Ha, ha.  She usually says <br/>
what I&#39;m thinking, lol.<br/>
<br/>
	My 12 year old son didn&#39;t learn to read until 10ish but he knew easy <br/>
words like &#39;cat&#39;, &#39;hat&#39;, &#39;open&#39;, &#39;closed&#39;, &#39;mom&#39;, dad&#39; and such before <br/>
that. He is dyslexic as is my husband.  I did a little bit of <br/>
Alphaphonics and McGuffy&#39;s readers with our son when he was young but <br/>
not much. He just got too frustrated.  He loves graphic novels (comic <br/>
book style) and there are so many of them these days on a variety of <br/>
subjects!  They&#39;re not all about superheros, lol.  My kids have checked <br/>
out graphic biographies on George Washington and Paul Revere for <br/>
example.   He has a very good memory and memorizes a lot.<br/>
<br/>
	I have helped my husband learn to read and write better too.  I knew <br/>
nothing about dyslexia 15 years ago other than people saw and wrote <br/>
letters and numbers backwards.  I had no idea how help someone with <br/>
dyslexia.  I had no idea my husband was dyslexic when I married him.  <br/>
He didn&#39;t either.  He was almost done with college and just thought he <br/>
was stupid in that area.  So I taught myself all about it.  I read <br/>
books, articles, websites, talked to people, etc. over the years and <br/>
have learned.  I am still learning but along the way I have been able <br/>
to help my husband and son.  Plus they have educated themselves more <br/>
about dyslexia so they can help themselves.  One thing I learned last <br/>
year was using colored page protectors.  Wish I had found that out at <br/>
the beginning, lol.  Anyway, the point is, you CAN teach someone with <br/>
dyslexia.  Don&#39;t use &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; as an excuse!  I always tell my husband <br/>
and 12 year old that dyslexia is not an excuse, it just means they have <br/>
to work a little harder or different.<br/>
<br/>
	I also have a 7 year old son with Aspeager&#39;s (in the autism spectrum) <br/>
that takes up a lot of time and attention but is reading very well.  <br/>
Never used Alphaphonics or any special reading program with him.  He is <br/>
also excellent with numbers and remembering dates and details.  Again, <br/>
nothing that I taught him.  Our family works together to understand <br/>
autism and learn how we can help our 7 year old.  It helps when the <br/>
other kids in the family are on board, imo.<br/>
<br/>
	I like what Lisa W. said about her son finding the &quot;door to reading <br/>
books&quot;.  I would suggest you find what interests your children and <br/>
spend your money in those areas :)  Allow them to find their door, so <br/>
to speak.  Also, accentuate the positive.  Focus on your children&#39;s <br/>
strength&#39;s and natural inclinations.<br/>
<br/>
	My 12 year old son is a very talented artist and uses just about any <br/>
medium for his projects.  We have a nice homeschool co-op in the next <br/>
town over with good art classes that I make sure we offer to him.  He <br/>
loves the outdoors and natural science.  He will read just about <br/>
anything related to art and nature on his own, even if he has <br/>
difficulty with the words because it interests him.  This is his door.  <br/>
He also likes audio books on a variety of subjects :)<br/>
<br/>
	My 7 year old son focuses intently on something for a few months and <br/>
then, after learning all he can on a subject, moves on to another one.  <br/>
Lately it has been Mesopotamia/Babylon and before that it was owls, <br/>
specifically barn owls.   There is no rhyme, reason or specific order <br/>
in his choosing but we have learned to go with the flow with him.  He <br/>
likes to make books on whatever he&#39;s studying and uses copy paper <br/>
stapled together to draw and write.  He dictates what he wants to say, <br/>
I write it down and he copies it.  We go through a lot of packages of <br/>
copy paper and blue, black, red and green pens.  A lot!  I could <br/>
probably fill a whole room with all the books he&#39;s made.  He will do <br/>
this for hours at a time some days.  This is his door.<br/>
<br/>
	My job with these two and all the other children is to provide the <br/>
means, resources and time for them to explore the things that interest <br/>
them.  I would encourage you to do the same and not worry too much.  <br/>
Educate yourself on unschooling, dyslexia and such.  Slow down and <br/>
enjoy your children and their interests during these years.  They grow <br/>
up all too soon.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>But sometimes our actions send a different -- sometimes opposite! --  <br/>
message than what we intend. All the things Robyn mentioned are  <br/>
things the parents are doing to their kids with a message of love.  <br/>
The kids aren&#39;t getting that message though! The actions, to the  <br/>
kids, are over riding the words. If the parent truly meant the words,  <br/>
the kids feel, they wouldn&#39;t be doing the actions.<br/>
<br/>
How many kids have been spanked with &quot;I&#39;m doing this because I love  <br/>
you.&quot; And how many kids think, &quot;No, you don&#39;t like or understand who  <br/>
I am. That&#39;s  why you&#39;re hitting me. If you loved me, you wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
hitting me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Think about it this way: If your husband felt you had gourmet cook in  <br/>
you because you enjoyed cooking and decided since you weren&#39;t moving  <br/>
in that direction on your own,  he started signing you up for cooking  <br/>
classes and making you go, bringing home cooking books and videos,  <br/>
how would you feel? Wouldn&#39;t it feel like he was watching and judging  <br/>
you and you were coming up short in his eyes? Otherwise why would he  <br/>
be trying to change you? No matter how well meaning he was, no matter  <br/>
that he wanted the best for you, if he&#39;s pressuring you to be  <br/>
something different than you are, his actions can&#39;t help but come  <br/>
across as who you are isn&#39;t good enough and you&#39;re failing in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When<br/>
&gt; he writes me notes and writes everything backwards,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is very typical, especially with dyslexic kids. My daughter  <br/>
wrote lots of stuff backwards too.<br/>
<br/>
It does add an extra decoding step for some kids and so takes them a  <br/>
bit longer to figure reading out. But, given time and no pressure,  <br/>
they *do* figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and when I read<br/>
&gt; to him and he asks me why he can&#39;t read it,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The real, true answer is: he&#39;s not yet ready.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s *not* the answer schools will give. That&#39;s *not* the answer  <br/>
reading specialists (who will take your money) will give.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that they&#39;re lying. It&#39;s that they have zero experience (&lt;--  <br/>
important! *zero* experience!) with kids who are allowed to read in  <br/>
their own time. Not only don&#39;t they know what a child is like who is  <br/>
given freedom to read, but they don&#39;t know that they don&#39;t know!<br/>
<br/>
And, worse, they truly believe what they&#39;re doing causes a child to  <br/>
read when really the primary factor is time and waiting until all the  <br/>
brain areas needed for reading are fully mature.<br/>
<br/>
In scientific experiments, it&#39;s important to have a control group: a  <br/>
group that you do exactly the same things to *except* the special  <br/>
thing you&#39;re testing. Without the control group, you can&#39;t know if  <br/>
it&#39;s the special thing or some other factor.<br/>
<br/>
For reading -- in fact for all of school -- there is no control  <br/>
group. Reading instructors have no clue whether what they&#39;re doing is  <br/>
actually working better than time in a print rich, encouraging  <br/>
environment.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are the control group. We know, because our children do  <br/>
demonstrate it, that reading instruction is not only unnecessary, in  <br/>
some cases it can be harmful to the child&#39;s sense of self worth. The  <br/>
child comes to believe they&#39;re failing at something mom believes they  <br/>
can do. When the truth is, they just aren&#39;t ready.<br/>
<br/>
What unschoolers do instead of instruction is read to them, answer  <br/>
their questions, listen to books on tape, watch related movies,  <br/>
provide access to things they want to read (video games and guides  <br/>
have helped lots of unschooling kids but wouldn&#39;t even be on the  <br/>
radar of reading instructors!) Whatever the child enjoys.<br/>
<br/>
(None of those should be seen as necessary to reading. Those are all  <br/>
just part of the chaos that kids pull order from. Follow your child&#39;s  <br/>
lead in what he enjoys. Try other things out and drop them if he  <br/>
doesn&#39;t like them.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; saying he wants to learn<br/>
&gt; to read and that I do something to help him, what can I do as a<br/>
&gt; parent?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If he were six and couldn&#39;t ride a two wheeler after much trying, the  <br/>
best and honest -- though frustrating! -- answer for a child is that  <br/>
his body isn&#39;t ready and that it will be ready when it&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
It *is* frustrating. And lots of dyslexic and nondyslexic kids have  <br/>
gone through wanting to read but can&#39;t when they want to. Time fixes  <br/>
it. I wouldn&#39;t stop a child from trying, but I would make it known  <br/>
his brain is getting ready but it just isn&#39;t there yet. And help him  <br/>
think up lots of things he can do now but couldn&#39;t a year or two or 5  <br/>
ago.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try to do the best I can for him and read constantly to<br/>
&gt; him as much as I can, but I&#39;m frankly overwhelmed and I don&#39;t know<br/>
&gt; how to teach someone to not read backwards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because you can&#39;t. Really. He has to figure it out. It *sounds*  <br/>
cruel, and would be if people knew some simple things to help, but  <br/>
they don&#39;t. The easiest way for kids to learn to read is to give them  <br/>
time in a supportive print rich environment. Help them be happy.  <br/>
(Though we can&#39;t remove all unhappiness, we can be aware where we&#39;re  <br/>
causing it. Kids can get frustrated and unhappy when they&#39;re trying  <br/>
to master *anything*: a Lego creation, a skateboarding trick, a video  <br/>
game level, making pie crust. But when they master it, the feeling of  <br/>
having done it yourself is priceless :-)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, though, that nearly everyone believes we can teach  <br/>
kids to read. Teachers are going through that motion all across the  <br/>
world, putting children through their paces and by the end of the  <br/>
first year, a predictable chunk of them are reading.<br/>
<br/>
But given the same group who were raised in unschooling homes, the  <br/>
results would be the same. Unschooled kids read on the same schedule  <br/>
as schooled kids. The only difference is the naturally later readers  <br/>
come to eventually read intact. They don&#39;t pick up the idea from  <br/>
reading programs that there&#39;s something wrong with them.<br/>
<br/>
The additional factor in your son&#39;s instance is that he too believes  <br/>
he can be taught to read but that there&#39;s something wrong and just  <br/>
needs to try harder. All the adults around him have been telling him  <br/>
that in words and actions for years.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s why an apology could help.<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Surely you know that we will tell you to let go of the label of<br/>
&gt; dyslexic as<br/>
&gt; &gt; irrelevant to unschooling. Dyslexia is only relevant within a<br/>

&gt; &gt; timetable. Reading at any age is only relevant withing a schooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; timetable.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t think you are paying for your son to learn to read. You are<br/>
&gt; paying<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone to engage in a daily (or whenever the lessons are) struggle<br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; your son, a daily message for him that there is something wrong<br/>
&gt; with him.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just letting go of that fear, and being ready just to read to him<br/>
&gt; whenever<br/>
&gt; &gt; he wants it, when you can, including quickly translating the<br/>
&gt; message on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; computer screen of his game, will go a long way towards lifing some<br/>
&gt; of your<br/>
&gt; &gt; stress. It will take a while, but eventually the &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; stupid/reading sucks&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; feelings he probably lives with in his heart will fade away. The<br/>
&gt; experience<br/>
&gt; &gt; of unschoolers is that damage heals, and reading happens.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Watching a child learning to read in their own way is fascinating.<br/>
&gt; Is my<br/>
&gt; &gt; daughter dyslexic? I honestly don&#39;t know and couldn&#39;t care less.<br/>
&gt; But she is<br/>
&gt; &gt; 9 in 9 days, and on her merry way to reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1835012613">Karl has quite a vocabulary and is very verbal.  If I tried to make him<br/>
learn to read and used grade level stuff, I feel sure he could do it but it<br/>
would limit his time to do all the tons of things he&#39;s already doing and<br/>
increasing his understanding with all the time.  It would limit some of that<br/>
wild vocabulary accumulation by presenting him with grade level stuff, and<br/>
sort of saying &quot;here, this is all you&#39;re *supposed* to be able to know at<br/>
your age.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is seeing the learning, then eventually knowing that the<br/>
learning is happening without looking, letting go of the focus on learning<br/>
and just living and breathing without thinking that our children are<br/>
learning.  Knowing it.  It takes time to come to that but start now, and<br/>
when just a little time has passed it will be less and less of a worry, and<br/>
then a little more time will pass and it&#39;ll be even less of a concern.  One<br/>
day, you&#39;ll turn around and wonder why you ever worried about it.  You&#39;ll<br/>
just know.<br/>
<br/>
So basically, unschooling is learning that our kids are learning.  It&#39;s like<br/>
learning to ride a bike.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m disagreeing, but something there seems wrong.  We  <br/>
probably agree and I&#39;m quibbling about words, and probably mostly the  <br/>
word &quot;reading.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I spent a year being a reading teacher.  I wasn&#39;t specially trained,  <br/>
but the first year I taught they put me in as the remedial reading  <br/>
teacher.  It was legal for one year without me being certified.  The  <br/>
principal told me I  needed to go back and start getting certified.   <br/>
I said no, I wasn&#39;t going back to school that summer (I was 21 and  <br/>
had been in school with summers since I was 14, having taken only one  <br/>
summer off the year I turned 18).  I told him I was certified to  <br/>
teach English and he needed to put me in a language arts position, so  <br/>
he did.  Those kids were 12, or should&#39;ve been, but there were  <br/>
several boys in there who turned 14 that year because they had failed  <br/>
first or second grade.  Poor guys!  They were sweet.  They were  <br/>
hopeful.  They were crushed, though, and had been being told for six  <br/>
or seven years that they couldn&#39;t read.  They were just resigned to  <br/>
that &quot;fact.&quot;  It was criminal.  That was 1975, but  it&#39;s happening  <br/>
worse than ever.<br/>
<br/>
What I wanted to say was that I think unschooled kids read later than  <br/>
schooled kids in many cases, but our kids are REALLY reading, like  <br/>
people, not doing school-tricks so teachers can give them good grades  <br/>
in reading so schools can meet their test-score quotas, maintain  <br/>
their progress rates and curves and stats.<br/>
<br/>
While kids at school are being pressed and bullied and bribed to  <br/>
read, our kids are learning way  more than those kids would be  <br/>
capable of reading about, and when unschooled kids learn to read  <br/>
naturally they do it filled with peace and a sense of accomplishment  <br/>
and real purposes in mind.  Reading means they can use YouTube  <br/>
better, and play video games better, and find out which movies are  <br/>
playing.  They read like adults (not meaning &quot;at a college level,&quot;  <br/>
because all that is bogus too--it has to do with the lengths of words  <br/>
and sentences and of the odd way in which tests are calibrated)--they  <br/>
read in the real world, not in &quot;readers&quot; carefully chosen for  <br/>
simplicity, short words, and unnaturally short sentences.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think &quot;the same schedule as schooled kids&quot; is necessarily  <br/>
true, and I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s not desirable.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the deal:   Some kids, school or no school, read at three  <br/>
and four.  And schools don&#39;t like it one bit.  They criticize the  <br/>
parents for it, because those kids are trouble in school.  They&#39;re  <br/>
bored and critical and cause unrest.  But one advantage is they raise  <br/>
the average reading level and so there is the appearance that the  <br/>
school taught them to read.  Schools and teachers took tons of credit  <br/>
for things I learned outside of school.  I didn&#39;t read until I was  <br/>
six, so they took full credit for that!   Most kids in school don&#39;t  <br/>
become fluent readers until they&#39;re nine or ten.   That is the same  <br/>
with unschoolers.   Some kids in school (many) still aren&#39;t fluent  <br/>
readers at ten, and they get shunted into classes that don&#39;t lead to  <br/>
&quot;college bound&quot; or more academic fields.  And the worst thing is that  <br/>
the school itself caused some of the problem, or spotlighted it and  <br/>
made it worse.<br/>
<br/>
So to Joyce&#39;s clear statement, I add six paragraphs of &quot;yes,  <br/>
but...&quot;  (Sorry.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-715276015">-=-Like.... he could draw mandalas (which is anything drawn in the  <br/>
shape of a<br/>
circle).-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He could color.  At the mall here now there&#39;s a stand with &quot;Adult  <br/>
coloring books,&quot; and they&#39;re mandala patterns.  There have been some  <br/>
for a long time through Dover coloring books, and there&#39;s a Japanese  <br/>
company that does mazes and dot-to-dot and pattern art for coloring.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are some that are printable<br/>

if you google it you can find others to print for free.  Buying  <br/>
coloring books might get nicer paper, but loose pages are easier than  <br/>
books, for something you&#39;re going to turn around anyway.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-4216188">-=-I am still learning but along the way I have been able<br/>
to help my husband and son. Plus they have educated themselves more<br/>
about dyslexia so they can help themselves.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husband knew about dyslexia and that didn&#39;t help.<br/>
<br/>
My son didn&#39;t have any idea, and his reading and writing are both WAY  <br/>
better than my public schooled, college educated husband.<br/>
<br/>
When the goal is learning to read in one&#39;s own way, learning about  <br/>
dyslexia isn&#39;t so great a plan.<br/>
<br/>
This is not good advice for helping people understand unschooling  <br/>
better:<br/>
<br/>
-=-  Anyway, the point is, you CAN teach someone with dyslexia. Don&#39;t  <br/>
use &quot;I can&#39;t&quot; as an excuse! I always tell my husband and 12 year old  <br/>
that dyslexia is not an excuse, it just means they have to work a  <br/>
little harder or different.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t have to &quot;work&quot; at all to learn to read.  it came to  <br/>
them naturally.   Teaching people isn&#39;t part of the unschooling this  <br/>
list exists to promote.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I like what Lisa W. said about her son finding the &quot;door to  <br/>
reading books&quot;. I would suggest you find what interests your children  <br/>
and spend your money in those areas :) Allow them to find their door,  <br/>
so to speak. Also, accentuate the positive. Focus on your children&#39;s  <br/>
strength&#39;s and natural inclinations.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree that providing kids with lots of whatever they&#39;re interested  <br/>
in is good.  In natural-learning terms, though, there isn&#39;t a door to  <br/>
reading because reading isn&#39;t in another room or another place.  It&#39;s  <br/>
all around us and kids will figure it out in their own way, in their  <br/>
own time, not from any one source/door.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He dictates what he wants to say,<br/>
<br/>
I write it down and he copies it. We go through a lot of packages of<br/>
copy paper and blue, black, red and green pens. A lot! I could<br/>
probably fill a whole room with all the books he&#39;s made. He will do<br/>
this for hours at a time some days. This is his door.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Things like that are very cool.  Holly used to make books, too, in  <br/>
her own writing, before she could read. I would either write it all  <br/>
down, or spell each word to her as she called them out.  It wasn&#39;t a  <br/>
door.  It was the creation of books.  It, along with every single  <br/>
other thing in her life, led her to writing and reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1759670757">-=-One of the things I did is to tell Karl that he *is* reading  <br/>
already, and<br/>
that when he is finished learning it will be just everybody else who  <br/>
learns<br/>
to read.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem with telling a child he can read, when he looks  <br/>
at words and they&#39;re just marks, is that you mislead him about his  <br/>
own knowledge of what reading is.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to tell me I wasn&#39;t hungry when I was. It didn&#39;t help the  <br/>
relationship.<br/>
<br/>
Many parents tell a kid &quot;YES YOU CAN&quot; when the kid says &quot;I can&#39;t do  <br/>
this.&quot;  It&#39;s not very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-and that when he is finished learning...-=-<br/>
<br/>
I still come across words I hadn&#39;t known before.  I don&#39;t know that  <br/>
people &quot;finish learning&quot; (to read or anything else).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe saying that would be good.  Tell him you come across words you   <br/>
haven&#39;t seen before, and some you can sound out and some you might  <br/>
have to look up or ask about.<br/>
<br/>
To say &quot;This is reading&quot; about a few dozen scattered short words  <br/>
might be less helpful than it sounds.  It&#39;s &quot;supportive,&quot; but is it  <br/>
informative?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s something else too.  I was reading very well --on my own for<br/>
pleasure-- books that would have been considered out of my range, starting<br/>
in 5th grade...  like all the Brontes, Jane Austens and anything Emily<br/>
Dickinson.  For me, it was the equivalent of angst ridden yum, like grunge<br/>
was when I was in college.  School placed me in remedial reading and made<br/>
noises about putting me in special ed because I have profound hearing loss.<br/>
Because I am nuts for words and learned very early to disrespect school<br/>
authorities and their test results, my reading comprehension tested low all<br/>
through high school.  I used the broadest sense and strrrrretched the<br/>
meanings of words to the nth degree.  I didn&#39;t even bother to learn what<br/>
teachers wanted me to do.  I felt it was all hoop jumping.<br/>
<br/>
However because I was a student in school, the judgment of the great Tests<br/>
still influenced my path.  I didn&#39;t get the privilege of signing up for<br/>
college bound classes.  ;)  Ah well.  I have a BA in art, which I don&#39;t<br/>
consider to be an academic field anyway. Being highly hands on, dense with<br/>
meaning and symbolism of countless types.  You could make art be academic if<br/>
you wanted to but WHY?  It&#39;s abundantly flexible and demands a great deal of<br/>
devotion, attention and motivation.  That&#39;s enough, more than plenty.<br/>
<br/>
My sister who got in all the college bound classes and did exactly what the<br/>
teachers wanted her to do and studied hard and took it all very seriously<br/>
(unlike me) got an associated degree, which I feel is as valuable as what I<br/>
got.  She was a paralegal for a number of years before she moved on to<br/>
motherhood.<br/>
