<div id="ygrps-yiv-995427878">i found this article really interesting right now as i am starting to question mainstream ideas such as rules (no dessert till after dinner, having curfews, no TV till after homework is done etc etc) and of course the idea that parents and teachers need to TEACH kids how to be in the world so that they will be successful adults. <br/>
<br/>
it really got me thinking about how some (most?) parents send their kids to school to learn &quot;how to be&quot; in the world. i think there are schools out there that try to create an enriched, stimulating environment for the kids to learn in. and there are parents who work 9-5 everyday away from their kids and then at home things are in fact LESS interesting than at school (often just a routine of eating dinner, doing homework, getting ready for bed + maybe some fun/family time on the weekend).... i know i used to be a part of that rat race myself.<br/>
<br/>
it seems to me that the daycare mentioned in the article has some positive ideas, such as cue cards that remind the kids how to get along (instead of constant verbal directives or reprimands from teachers) and involving the kids in the solutions to problems that arise (instead of time-outs and forced apologies). those things seem to me very different than blanket rules, like what is suggested for parents to do at home. <br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s a bit frightening to hear such messages about future success depending on self control when you don&#39;t feel like you have enough tools to help your kids learn. i think some parents probably read this and think they need to force their kids to clean up their blocks &quot;or else&quot; at a young age...<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;d also like to read the actual study and see how they measured all those variables such as self control and success, and whether they investigated how this was &quot;taught to&quot; (ie learned by) the kids. and whether success = happiness.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, i would love to hear a bit about what your take is on this article and the message. here is the link:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939726043">The author is trying to pin the work being done in the Clara Barton daycare on <br/>
the findings being presented in Terrie Moffitt&#39;s study. Terrie Moffitt says at <br/>
the beginning of the article &quot;Children who had the greatest self-control in <br/>
primary school and  preschool ages were most likely to have fewer health <br/>
problems when they  reached their 30s.&quot; She doesn&#39;t say where they got their <br/>
self-control. She doesn&#39;t say what helps or hinders the production of <br/>
self-control. She says those folks who have self control at age x do better at <br/>
age y. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the abstract of the paper the authors state their findings have sweeping <br/>
benefits for the public. It is important to know that funding for research in <br/>
the UK (apparently the U.S. started it, so there too) is demanding that there be <br/>
a public good outcome. Blue sky research is not considered valuable. Only that <br/>
research which will have public policy contributions will go more easily to <br/>
being funded. In the face of that researchers may be prone to overstating the <br/>
applicability to the individual and the group when writing up their findings. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the abstract, in direct contradiction of the idea that learning is what is <br/>
key to self control, the authors write: &quot;In another cohort of 500 sibling-pairs, <br/>
the sibling with                      lower self-control had poorer outcomes, <br/>
despite  shared family background.&quot; It argues that shared environment isn&#39;t what <br/>
produces self-control. It argues that it is something genetic and on a spectrum, <br/>
or gradient as the authors term it. I don&#39;t know if they did any birth order <br/>
analyses, but I think those kinds of analyses may be relatively unlikely to come <br/>
to significance anyhow. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the daycare setup sounds more like operant conditioning than it  sounds <br/>
like working to create an environment where learning self control  is more <br/>
likely. &quot;The two teachers give the children multiple cues when it&#39;s time to <br/>
clean  up: Lights flash, a bell rings and the children clap and count to 100.  <br/>
That makes it easier to switch gears without a meltdown.&quot; That just speaks of <br/>
Skinnerian psychological practices. Maybe that is what they mean by <br/>
self-control, maybe if you haven&#39;t got it you should fake it is the model that <br/>
they are hoping will work. If you can be given rituals to perform that get you <br/>
to wait for 100 seconds you, too, can have self control?<br/>
<br/>
Then the end of the article makes no sense at all:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parents can help teenagers learn  self-control by making sure the family has <br/>
clear rules for things like  curfew or finishing homework before they have <br/>
screen time. Teenager who  have problems with impulsivity may benefit from <br/>
special driving classes  that let them practice controlling the car in difficult <br/>
conditions on a  racetrack. For all teens, clear rules such as curfews help them <br/>
regulate  themselves.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How is that about self-control? How is that about anything other than <br/>
traditional parenting practices. Other than the racetrack thing, which sounds <br/>
like fun. The article just went from external control methods being used in <br/>
daycare to external control methods being used with teenagers. Nothing <br/>
particularly valuable. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One of the problems with the belief that if you don&#39;t have it by preschool age <br/>
you won&#39;t get it is that school is a huge culturally defining factor in many <br/>
societies&#39; group experiences. Linnaea may (or may not) have looked as though she <br/>
didn&#39;t have much self-control by the age of 3 or 4. She wanted what she wanted <br/>
when she wanted it. At 10 she looks very different. Having had her needs met and <br/>
her interests supported she&#39;s very capable of really examining what she wants <br/>
and how long she&#39;s willing to wait for something or how much she&#39;s willing to <br/>
pay. She hasn&#39;t had to compete with 20 to 30 other children on a daily basis to <br/>
get her needs met. She hasn&#39;t had a life that is largely not about her needs <br/>
being met. The children in the Clara Barton daycare in Cabin John, MD may be <br/>
better off than the children at a less enlightened and modern daycare down the <br/>
road, or in the next town, but they aren&#39;t better off than their unschooled <br/>
peers who are being supported and nurtured and not pushed to independent hand <br/>
washing with pictorial guide by age 4. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re defining self control as doing what you&#39;re  <br/>
supposed to rather than what you want to.<br/>
<br/>
But adults get to choose what &quot;supposed tos&quot; they&#39;re willing to put up  <br/>
with to get what they want. For one adult, being expected to wear a  <br/>
suit everyday for a great job might be worth it. For another adult, it  <br/>
might not and they&#39;d turn the job down.<br/>
<br/>
Why would someone take a suit-expected job and then fight against the  <br/>
suit?<br/>
<br/>
Some people do! And they do it not because they lack self control or  <br/>
discipline but because they&#39;ve felt controlled all their lives and  <br/>
they&#39;re, in a knee jerk way, fighting anything that feels like  <br/>
control. People who feel they have control in their lives don&#39;t need  <br/>
to constantly fight for it or fight against other people having some.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Director Linda Owen says the children are expected to be responsible  <br/>
&gt; for a series of actions when they arrive at school each morning,  <br/>
&gt; without help from Mom and Dad. The children sign in, put away their  <br/>
&gt; lunches, hang up their own clothes, wash their hands before they can  <br/>
&gt; play, and then choose activities in the classroom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;All those things help with self-management,&quot; Owen says.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suspect the kids are experiencing a much different reality!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they were driven by a lofty desire for self control but  <br/>
by a desire to be competent.<br/>
<br/>
At 4 being able to follow rules like in a game can feel like an  <br/>
accomplishment. It&#39;s like needing to jump Mario from the box to the  <br/>
ledge while missing the cactus each time you enter a particular level.<br/>
<br/>
But also, emotions are powerful and it feels like they make you do  <br/>
things you don&#39;t necessarily want to. At 4 experiencing the ability to  <br/>
seize control from an emotion is undoubtedly a big deal. Being able to  <br/>
stop that impulse to rush into the room in order to do something first  <br/>
-- as, importantly, other kids were doing -- might feel like a  <br/>
discovery of power for some kids.<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s not a drive to *self* control but a broader more general drive  <br/>
to feel more competent and more in control. (Or less out of control. A  <br/>
feeling of not always needing to be a slave to the whims of emotion.)<br/>
<br/>
This has been going around for a while, and if you haven&#39;t taken the  <br/>
time to watch it, you&#39;ve been missing something good! And helpful for  <br/>
unschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
But imposing expectations and then making kids comply with them is  <br/>
likely to make them feel *less* in control! And that&#39;s how undoubtedly  <br/>
most schools would end up implementing such ideas. The goal would be  <br/>
to make kids obey rules instead of their inner voice. To do what  <br/>
someone else tells them to instead of what they want to do.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For example, preschoolers can learn that they don&#39;t always get what  <br/>
&gt; they want immediately; they may need to wait for that treat.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Preschoolers can have reinforced how little power they have in the  <br/>
world and how it must rock to be big so you can make other people do  <br/>
what you want them to do. Or even go so far as to make them jump  <br/>
through hoops that make no sense.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Parents can help teenagers learn self-control by making sure the  <br/>
&gt; family has clear rules for things like curfew or finishing homework  <br/>
&gt; before they have screen time.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the choice is &quot;Do whatever,&quot; or &quot;Here&#39;s a few clear expectations  <br/>
and the consequences,&quot; then &quot;Here&#39;s our expectations,&quot; will have more  <br/>
positive effects.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not optimal. It doesn&#39;t help kids make better decisions. It  <br/>
just controls them until they&#39;re older and their point of view and  <br/>
emotions become more adult like. (And for some kids who feel even a  <br/>
little control strongly, it can have relationship damaging  <br/>
consequences. And make them fight against suits ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Teenager who have problems with impulsivity may benefit from special  <br/>
&gt; driving classes that let them practice controlling the car in  <br/>
&gt; difficult conditions on a racetrack.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Teens who feel they don&#39;t have control in their lives can feel more in  <br/>
control if they are given the opportunity to acquire skills to feel  <br/>
more in control.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; For all teens, clear rules such as curfews help them regulate  <br/>
&gt; themselves.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Stated as if it were a fact.<br/>
<br/>
Without rules life can feel like no one&#39;s in control. It feels unsafe  <br/>
and like no one cares if you&#39;re safe.<br/>
<br/>
But better than rules is someone being there for you to be your  <br/>
partner, mentor and guide. Someone who is there to support your drive  <br/>
to be more competent in life.<br/>

I don&#39;t know if this helps anyone else, but it reminded me of when I&#39;ve been asked about unschooling (by those who probably will never unschool, but who are interested in learning about new things - so not diabolically opposed to the ideas)... and one response I&#39;ve gotten, that being a &#39;friend&#39; to your child is damaging.  That children need you to &#39;parent&#39; them, which for them means rules or boundaries or something.  So, I really liked seeing this idea of being a &#39;partner, mentor and guide,&#39; and I think I&#39;ll use it in the future to describe what I do.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93777095">Pam Sorooshian posted about being a friend to your child here, back in May of 2009. Here&#39;s the link to the original post:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/45495">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/message/45495</a><br/>
<br/>
I love what she said:<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-<br/>
Something that has rattled around in my head for years is the line,<br/>
&quot;You&#39;re the parent, not their friend.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was just reading a news article and someone was quoted as saying:<br/>
&quot;&quot;Your kids donât need a 40-year-old friend. They need a parent,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What a tragic dichotomy that one little line sets up!<br/>
<br/>
Every single time that line has ever entered my head, it was leading me<br/>
in the wrong direction. Every time.<br/>
<br/>
What is a friend? I&#39;m not talking about the schoolmates teenagers go out<br/>
partying and drinking with. Not talking about the 5 year old kid your<br/>
child happens to play with at the park that day. I&#39;m talking about real<br/>
friendship.<br/>
<br/>
1 a*:* one attached to another by affection or esteem<br/>
<br/>
Knowing what I know now, with my kids grown, I strongly feel that that<br/>
that one line, which permeates parental consciousnesses, should be<br/>
quickly and actively contradicted and rooted out like a pernicious weed<br/>
every single time it sprouts up.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of &quot;You&#39;re the parent, not their friend,&quot; substitute, &quot;Be the<br/>
very very best friend to them you can possibly be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do your kids need you to be their &quot;40 year old friend?&quot; YES! Children do<br/>
need to feel attached to their parents &quot;by affection or esteem.&quot; What<br/>
better connection is there than by affection and esteem?<br/>
<br/>
AND, what&#39;s more, parents need their children&#39;s friendship, too. Some<br/>
people seem to think there is something wrong with parents &quot;needing&quot;<br/>
their children. They act like being mutually attached to each other<br/>
means children have not become independent enough and parents are being<br/>
a &quot;burden to their children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A 40 year old friend isn&#39;t going to have the same relationship with a 5<br/>
year old as his/her 5 year old friends or 10 year old friends. And<br/>
parent-child friendships evolve over the years until they are,<br/>
eventually, adult-with-adult friendships.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing wrong with wanting to be your child&#39;s friend. Do what<br/>
it takes to earn their friendship - be supportive and kind and honest<br/>
and trustworthy and caring and generous and loyal and fun and<br/>
interesting and interested in them and all the other things that good<br/>
friends are to each other. Be the best 40 year old friend you can be (or<br/>
whatever age you are).<br/>
<br/>
People use &quot;I&#39;m the parent, not a friend,&quot; as an excuse to be mean,<br/>
selfish, and lazy. Instead, be the adult in the friendship. Be mature.<br/>
You&#39;ve BEEN a five-year-old and your child has not been a<br/>
forty-year-old, so you have an advantage in terms of long-term and wider<br/>
perspective. Use that advantage to be an even better friend. You know<br/>
how to be kinder and less self-centered and you know how beneficial it<br/>
is to put forth the effort.<br/>
<br/>
I can honestly say that my children and I are friends. I know they&#39;d say<br/>
the same. I&#39;m not trying to act like I&#39;m 18 or 21 or 24 -- I am 57 years<br/>
old. They&#39;re having a &quot;Halo&quot; party at someone else&#39;s house tonight and<br/>
will stay up all night playing video games and I&#39;m not going to go and<br/>
hang out with them all night and play Halo. I&#39;m going to make a huge<br/>
platter of deviled eggs for them to take over there, but I&#39;m going to<br/>
stay home and watch a movie with my husband and go to bed early enough<br/>
that I&#39;ll feel good tomorrow. I&#39;m not 18 and I don&#39;t recover as quickly<br/>
as they do from a night with no sleep. I didn&#39;t go to the midnight<br/>
showing of the Terminator movie the other night, for the same reason.<br/>
But I was certainly invited and welcome.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are not spoiled brats because I&#39;ve tried to be their friend.<br/>
They hold jobs, they manage money, they make good and responsible<br/>
decisions. We are very strongly &quot;attached by affection and esteem.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could wipe that expression out of everybody&#39;s minds and replace<br/>
it with &quot;Be the best friend to your children that you can be.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
You could say that AND friend!  If you asked my 16 yr old about it, she&#39;d say <br/>
that I&#39;m her friend.  She likes being friends with me.  I&#39;m not a &quot;peer&quot; friend. <br/>
 I&#39;m an adult friend, not unlike some of her other adult friends, but I have a <br/>
lot more influence because I&#39;m also her parent.<br/>
<br/>
I just took her and some of her friends to the light rail to get into the city <br/>
to go and play.  She said, &quot;hey you could just take us all the way and stay and <br/>
hang out with us.  I would love it if you did, and not just the drive us there <br/>
part, but if you actually came and played with us.&quot;  It was sweet, but I had to <br/>
decline because we were almost to the transit center and I wasn&#39;t at all <br/>
prepared to spend the evening in a chilly city for hours.  That, and I&#39;d already <br/>
told my younger daughter that I&#39;d spend the evening with her.  None of her <br/>
friends objected to the idea of me hanging out, in fact they tried to convince <br/>
me.  It made me feel loved!<br/>
<br/>
I like my kids, often more than I like some of my adult friends!  They are <br/>
interesting and fun to be around.  I think our culture, in general, has been so <br/>
ingrained with thinking that friends can only be one&#39;s own age that parents <br/>
don&#39;t befriend younger people much.  It&#39;s so separated.  Like when, at family <br/>
gatherings, all the kids disappear away from the adults.  Not that kids <br/>
shouldn&#39;t or don&#39;t want kid time, it just so often feels artificial, or that, <br/>
for kids, adults aren&#39;t all that great to be around.  Since so many adults <br/>
aren&#39;t all that great to be around, it doesn&#39;t surprise me that kids are wary of <br/>
adults, and adults accept that role as being more adult.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1673696482">***How is that about self-control? How is that about anything other than <br/>
traditional parenting practices. Other than the racetrack thing, which sounds <br/>
like fun. The article just went from external control methods being used in <br/>
daycare to external control methods being used with teenagers. Nothing <br/>
particularly valuable.***<br/>
<br/>
And not only not particularly valuable, erroneous.  External control methods are <br/>
a crap shoot anyway.  Sometimes they work, and I guess the outcomes of external <br/>
control methods that worked, could be pointed to as examples that they work. <br/>
 That&#39;s the same thing schools do when they count all the kids with good grades. <br/>
 All the kids without good grades are still products of school, just like all <br/>
the kids who have had external controls foisted upon them who have rejected it, <br/>
are also products of that same system.<br/>
<br/>
Unless it had a 99% rate of kids who grew into adults who exhibited a great deal <br/>
of self control in all aspects of their lives, I wouldn&#39;t put much stock in it. <br/>
 Women who don&#39;t want to get pregnant aren&#39;t going to go for the contraceptive <br/>
that claims 50% effectiveness....  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1044398068">Yes, I remember reading Pam&#39;s post, I think.  It sounds very familiar.  Thanks for reposting it.  <br/>

Reading this made me remember how when I met my husband, I thought he was very strange... like something must be wrong with him.  He didn&#39;t have any close, long-term, friends in his own age group!  Every time he talked about &#39;his friend,&#39; and then I&#39;d meet them, they were old! They were actually his parents best friends (they had good taste in friends), and it was a very small town, and he made them his friends too.  And it was so good for him, probably exactly the types of friends he needed growing up.  I&#39;m glad I remembered that.<br/>
