<div id="ygrps-yiv-2025409425">Hi all,<br/>
 It&#39;s been a whirlwind since I got home from the conference. We&#39;ve found our<br/>
house and they have excepted our offer so I must leave for now. There is so<br/>
much to do to move and also to get our house ready to sell. I&#39;ll be back as<br/>
soon as we get settled. I&#39;m sure it will be a while. Thanks you all for the<br/>
wonderful outlook on life. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Unschooling,<br/>

&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>
of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>
