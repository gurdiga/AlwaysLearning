<div id="ygrps-yiv-1057671343">Hello group. I was a member and I unsubscribed for a while and am back for more inspiration. <br/>
<br/>
I just got a kindle fire for my three year old son. Any suggested apps, free is best, but also ones with a small charge? He loves superheroes, LOVES trucks and skulls on daddy&#39;s ipad, and enjoys paint programs. he is very responsive to sound. Any experience with amazon prime&#39;s movie selection?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-109706250">Try libraries - I saw that my local library is offering a few items to check out (for free) for Kindles.<br/>
<br/>
Amazon also has really cheap movies / TV shows to purchase.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
AND for those that don&#39;t know ;)   Amazon has free downloadable apps for iPhone, Windows PC, Mac, Blackberry, iPad, Android, Windows Phone 7      so you can purchase their downloadable items without having to purchase a Kindle.  I got free apps for our lap tops and our tower last winter.  <br/>
