<div>My daughter (11) has a best buddy that she&#39;s been pals with for several 
years.&nbsp;&nbsp;The friend&nbsp;has a little brother who was born on my 
birthday 2 1/2 years ago.&nbsp; Sadly, the little brother has recently been 
diagnosed with a very aggressive form of brain cancer.&nbsp; He is in the 
hospital 2 hours away.&nbsp; The family&nbsp;plans to&nbsp;be down there for 6 
months for his treatments.&nbsp; The survival rate is very low for a child of 
his age so he may very well pass away. &nbsp;We want to support the friend 
through this as much as we can.&nbsp;&nbsp;My top priority is to support my 
kids&nbsp;through this.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The friend stayed with us for 3 days/nights last week &amp; they all had a 
great time (including my&nbsp;son who is almost 10).&nbsp; The girls pretended 
they were roommates and they were so cute.&nbsp; Like a miniature version of 
Laverne &amp; Shirley.&nbsp; I gave them lots of support to be independent &amp; 
happily occupied.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I have two concerns that are causing me to reach out for support.&nbsp; 
First, the girls have a pattern of being besties for awhile &amp; then needing a 
break from each other.&nbsp; Sometimes my daughter needs a&nbsp;LONG 
break.&nbsp; I want to be a safe place for the friend, who is sweet and 
adorable, but I don&#39;t want to push her on my daughter. &nbsp;I want the stays to 
be a positive experience for all of us.&nbsp; So far they&#39;re in a good place 
&amp; I hope to keep it there so that we can continue to be a safe retreat for 
the friend.&nbsp; I think the best way to support long stays is to have 
interesting &amp; fun things available for them.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s when they 
get a little bored&nbsp;that they start&nbsp;to turn on each other.&nbsp; I am 
looking for fun ideas for them.&nbsp; Things that make them feel grown &amp; 
responsible.&nbsp;&nbsp;They like to cook &amp; I let them take over the kitchen 
&amp; clean it up for them.&nbsp; They both like creating things.&nbsp; I&#39;ve 
ordered some popin&#39; cookin&#39; kits &amp; candle making supplies, when the weather 
gets nice enough we can set up our camper, they can have camp fires outside near 
our trampoline (with me quietly checking in through the window)...</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The other thing I&#39;m looking for is thoughts on how to support the kids 
emotionally.&nbsp; My kids and I have babysat the little brother numerous times 
in the past &amp; we all feel pretty close to him.&nbsp; It&#39;s just unbelievable 
that he is going through this.&nbsp; How can I best help my kids (&amp; my 
husband &amp; I) to process this experience in a healthy way?&nbsp;&nbsp;We 
are&nbsp;helping with 2 fund raisers which does help us feel like we are doing 
something proactive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks so much you guys,</div>
