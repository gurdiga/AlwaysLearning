 </span></blockquote>Pat -- this unschooling stuff is not a &quot;method.&quot; THAT is the problem I think, <br/>
for people who feel like they can&#39;t get a grip on how to USE what all the <br/>
unschoolers are saying.<br/>
<br/>
It is a philosophy of how to live life. But not an educational method. <br/>
<br/>
You have to read and think and observe (other unschoolers, yourself, your <br/>
kids, other families, etc.) and begin to understand the principles involved <br/>
in unschooling. And then you just live your life according to those <br/>
principles. They aren&#39;t &quot;rules&quot; -- they are general principles that we live <br/>
by.<br/>
<br/>
So - maybe we&#39;d be more helpful if we were more explicit about our own <br/>
underyling beliefs/principles:<br/>
<br/>
For me, number one is that humans learn. (Remember the John Holt quote - Fish <br/>
fly, etc.? ---somebody repost that, please?) <br/>
<br/>
Because I believe this, that humans are hardwired to be learning machines, I <br/>
don&#39;t have to worry about motivating the kids to want to learn. I just have <br/>
to be there to provide help and support and create an enriching environment. <br/>
They&#39;ll take care of the learning part themselves. <br/>
<br/>
And, if they didn&#39;t appear to be wanting to learn stuff, what I&#39;d do is look <br/>
for what was BLOCKING that NATURAL aspect of their human nature. I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
think I needed to make them learn. I might, however, look at my own behavior <br/>
to see if I was doing something that they were resisting against. Or if there <br/>
was something else going on in their lives like that.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just my number one principle of unschooling. A LOT flows from that one <br/>
thing. Maybe other people could come up with others.<br/>

Yes. And also - and I think this is another fundamental of unschooling - is <br/>
to remember that they are discovering things EVEN IF you don&#39;t see it.<br/>

there is to be exposed to.  Even if you classify stuff as good or bad and <br/>
only expose them to the good, you can&#39;t do it.  The reason we help them to <br/>
learn the stuff that interests them is that what interests them always <br/>
leads to something else, and that to something else, and on and on.  Nobody <br/>
can possibly learn everything, but this way they learn what *they* need to <br/>
know.  And in doing so, they learn *how* to learn.<br/>

life would say he isn&#39;t learning much.  I&#39;ve even gone through stages where <br/>
I agreed with them.  Lately I&#39;ve really been able to step back and see just <br/>
how much he&#39;s learning.  It&#39;s wonderful.  It doesn&#39;t look at all like <br/>
school.  It doesn&#39;t even look much like most of the unschoolers I <br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well - there&#39;s the crux of it -- you believe they&#39;ll SOMETIMES be motivated <br/>
to learn some stuff when it interests them, but that that is not enough. That <br/>
is not any different than any curriculum-user or school-teacher believes. <br/>
They believe that kids will learn all kinds of stuff on their own when <br/>
they&#39;re interested, but that they need to be forced to learn some things that <br/>
they won&#39;t choose to learn about on their own. <br/>
<br/>
That is really different than what I believe.<br/>
<br/>
First - there are going to be very cool things that they&#39;ll never learn <br/>
anything about. That&#39;s reality. NONE of us are going to learn much about most <br/>
stuff in the world...there is only so much time. So - another principle of <br/>
unschooling --- &quot;There will be gaps. Let &#39;em be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Second - Kids want to be competent and if there are things they really do <br/>
need to learn, to help them join the adult world, to help them feel competent <br/>
in their world, they will be interested EVENTUALLY.  It helps to make a list, <br/>
for yourself, of what you really truly think is ESSENTIAL for them to learn. <br/>
Make the list and write a justification for everything on the list. If you <br/>
really do have things on that list that you really don&#39;t think your kid will <br/>
ever be interested in - then I guess that&#39;s the stuff you have to insist on, <br/>
eventually. But - remember - they don&#39;t have to learn it when they&#39;re young. <br/>
Roxana is 14 and had NO interest in math for years. None. But now she likes <br/>
it and is learning algebra with no problem at all. <br/>
<br/>
Third - everything is connected. An interest in musical theater can lead to <br/>
an interest in CATS which can lead to an interest in cats (the actual <br/>
animals) which can lead to an interest in cat breeding which can lead to an <br/>
interest in genetics which can lead to an interest in DNA which can lead to <br/>
an interest in Jurassic Park books which can lead to an interest in dinosaurs <br/>
which can lead to an interest in whatever happens to come up when we go to <br/>
the Natural History Museum sometime in the next few weeks.  One thing leads <br/>
to another. There is no way to plan that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; There could be a *method* to making an enriched environment.  It doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; change the basic *philosophy* of how to *use* the environment, however, <br/>

&gt; is outlined it can be improved upon.  I think that is really what I am <br/>
&gt; looking for.  A method or outline to an enriched environment and enriching <br/>
&gt; experiences.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay - a method for creating an enriched environment is to be very observant <br/>
of and responsive to your own kids.  It means, for example, noticing that <br/>
your child REALLY likes to build stuff -- and providing materials for that. <br/>
It means learning to stay out of the way when a child is exploring and <br/>
investigating and learning to step in and offer new ideas, information, or <br/>
advice when the time is right. It means keeping an eye out for things that <br/>
the kids might like to have or do or see or places to go. <br/>
<br/>
I have an idea. Make an &quot;idea book&quot; yourself. Maybe a set of index cards is a <br/>
good way to start. You write all your ideas of cool things the kids could do <br/>
- each on a card. You and the kids could go through the cards and pick out <br/>
cool things to do this week or today. Let the kids make cards too.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re at all imaginative, you&#39;ll need to buy your index cards at an <br/>
office supply warehouse store -- you&#39;ll have thousands of idea cards within a <br/>
few months. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1332208248">snip&gt;&gt;&gt;A method or outline to an enriched environment and enriching<br/>
experiences&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What is enriching?  Is it better to play with cuisennaire blocks than to<br/>
play Candy Land?  Is it better to do something than to do nothing?<br/>
<br/>
At one time I would have said &quot;yes&quot;, but now I say &quot;it depends&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I think I understand what you are asking re: enriched, but I&#39;m beginning<br/>
to think there is a lot of value judgement in that question.  Not picking<br/>
on you, this is something I&#39;ve been thinking about.  For example, playing<br/>
classical music in order to &quot;enrich&quot; my child&#39;s life rather than singing<br/>
along with the Beattle&#39;s and telling my kids things that I know about<br/>
them and their music, because I&#39;m more familiar with the Beattle&#39;s than<br/>
with classical.  I&#39;m not sure that we can really say that one of those<br/>
activities would be more enriching than the other.  I do believe that<br/>
classical music has value and we do listen to it as well, but is it<br/>
really more &quot;enriching&quot; than modern popular music?  Or maybe you mean<br/>
something else by that term?<br/>
<br/>
For me, unschooling feels a little like &quot;learning how to live&quot; after<br/>
decades of school and paid workforce determining how I spent the majority<br/>
of my time.  Now I&#39;m SAHM with SAHK&#39;s (stay at home kids :-)and I have to<br/>
figure out how to live (spend my time).  I got some good ideas from a<br/>
book called Wishcraft.  The author has exercises that helped me figure<br/>
out some of the things I want to be doing and I have/am doing some of<br/>
them.  Isn&#39;t it enriching for a child to be around adults who are really<br/>
living?<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go help 9yo make slice and bake cookies (which I don&#39;t like but<br/>
that&#39;s OK, it&#39;s easy for me to not eat them) but she really wanted me to<br/>
buy them for her to make and I remember that I learned how to bake with<br/>
Betty Crocker and can cook pretty well now.  Oh, and she just gave me a<br/>
lesson on how to eat miniature reeses pb cups.  The old me would have<br/>
been horrified that she&#39;s eating candy and not making cookies from<br/>
scratch but the new me is trying to just revel in how she goes about<br/>
things!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-776501854"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:megates@...">megates@...</a> made some good points but still I&#39;m inspired to play devil&#39;s <br/>
advocate:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ?  Is it better to play with cuisennaire blocks than to<br/>
&gt; play Candy Land?  Is it better to do something than to do nothing?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think so.  I think Candy Land is a cheap, foul little piece of bad art.  <br/>
I&#39;ve played, and we have one ($2 from a thrift store), but there&#39;s nothing to <br/>
it but matching unattractive colors and taking turns.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;doing nothing&quot; is daydreaming, planning or meditation, nothing&#39;s fine.  <br/>
If nothing is NOTHING, wishing to be in school instead of home bored, wishing <br/>
there was something interesting to do instead of watching the same video <br/>
*again,* I vote YES.<br/>
<br/>
Listening to classical isn&#39;t better than the Beatles.  But listening to BOTH <br/>
of them is better than listening to neither of them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Isn&#39;t it enriching for a child to be around adults who are really<br/>
living?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think so.  But some adults live at the expense of children.  They spend <br/>
money on themselves but tell the kids &quot;we can&#39;t afford it&quot; about things the <br/>
kids REALLY might like to have, and could use--back yard play equipment, or <br/>
bikes, or whatever those kids would spend hours with if they had them.   Some <br/>
adults feel they can only live when the kids are doing something somewhere <br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
I think stuff, activities and interactions are better than the lack of them.  <br/>
<br/>
I do agree, though, that it&#39;s likely that new unschoolers will think <br/>
&quot;enriched&quot; has to do with leaning toward schoolishness or &quot;value.&quot;  But I <br/>
think a globe is more important that the current issue of Tiger Beat.  Of <br/>
these four things: nothing, tiger beat, a globe, both--I&#39;d rather have both!  <br/>
Second choice, a globe.  Last choice, nothing.<br/>
<br/>
There is a value judgment, I suppose.  I would never banish the Beatles.  But <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;Tiger Beat is as good as a globe, so I&#39;m not buying a globe.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

apparently some kind of globe-worshiping Beatles fan<br/>

&gt; I have actually always liked Candy Land. I thought playing the actual<br/>
&gt; game<br/>
&gt; was boring, but my little sister and I liked (and still like) to make<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; stories about the characters in the game.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I rather like the graphics, myself.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; --Roxana<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I think so.  I think Candy Land is a cheap, foul little piece of<br/>
&gt; bad art.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;I&#39;ve played, and we have one ($2 from a thrift store), but there&#39;s<br/>
&gt; nothing<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;it but matching unattractive colors and taking turns.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My daughter used to like to stack the deck for Candy Land. Then see<br/>
&gt; if it<br/>
&gt; &gt; worked out the way she thought it would.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; She wanted to play yesterday but realized that she had taken out all<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; picture cards for something else and couldn&#39;t remember where they<br/>
&gt; were. So<br/>
&gt; &gt; she decided that the first time someone drew a double, that person<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; move to any candy space on the board. That was pretty boring. Next<br/>
&gt; she made<br/>
&gt; &gt; a chart matching each color to one of the candy spaces. When we drew<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; doubles, we moved to the corresponding candy spaces.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think the graphics have gotten even uglier over the years. My mom<br/>
&gt; gave<br/>
&gt; &gt; the kids the game and told me that now I would have to suffer like<br/>
&gt; she did.<br/>
&gt; &gt; That&#39;s my mom!<br/>

Hearthsong.  My boys have little patience for games<br/>

reversible boards) in one box for 20 bucks.  There is<br/>
matching, memory, colors, counting, etc, in the<br/>
various games.  The die in the set is a 6 sided one<br/>
with different colors on every side rather than<br/>
numbers.  Check out the other games at Hearthsong too,<br/>
as they have some really awesome ones for younger<br/>
kids.<br/>

We have that too, and it is so much sweeter, maybe that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t have <br/>
sufficient need for the benefits of Candyland.<br/>

and it&#39;s been a huge hit. All the kids we hang out with from 3 1/2 <br/>
to 10 have liked to play it (over and over!). It&#39;s a game *I* actually <br/>
enjoyed playing as well. Also it&#39;s a cooperative game, so winning <br/>
and losing isn&#39;t an issue.<br/>
