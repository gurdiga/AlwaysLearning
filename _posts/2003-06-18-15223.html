hey tammy<br/>
<br/>
what part of mississippi are ya&#39;ll in? I&#39;m having the same trouble<br/>
finding like-minded people here in Long Beach on the coast.  Honestly it<br/>
was more inclusive in Alabama where we had to homeschool under a church<br/>
school law, but there were non-religous inclusive groups all over the<br/>
place. Down here if your not military (or have access to the bases) or<br/>
willing to put in an application and sign a statement of faith, your<br/>
pretty much on your own. There HAS to be more of us that want inclusive<br/>
groups.. I really should put some effort into a new group but its been<br/>
hectic with me going back to college. .. maybe this fall.. hopefully<br/>
<br/>
kendra.. humidity? what humidity? it was only 75% today&gt;&gt;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845646053">Hey Alyce.<br/>
<br/>
DragonTree HomeLearners meets weekly for play and conversation. Our  <br/>
primary goal, as a group, is to provide plenty of freedom for our  <br/>
children to have time to develop their own games, make complex  <br/>
creations, explore new relationships, and develop close friendships. We  <br/>
believe strongly in the value of free play and we try not to schedule  <br/>
too many activities for the children on park days so that they can have  <br/>
long uninterrupted hours to play. However, some of the activities that  <br/>
have been offered, at the urging of the children, are: candlemaking,  <br/>
papermaking, bubble shapes, origami, woodworking , electronics, and  <br/>
soldering. We meet every Wednesday at El Dorado Park in Long Beach. We  <br/>
generally meet from around noon until dark during the winter and we  <br/>
often stay late and have an evening cookout and campfire during the  <br/>
summer.  For further information,  contact Pam Sorooshian at  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:pamsoroosh@...">pamsoroosh@...</a> or Jocelyn Vilter at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jocelyn@...">jocelyn@...</a> .<br/>

miss other park days but NEVER (ok rarely) dragontree.  I even went <br/>
today for a bit without children.  I thought they&#39;d be there, but my <br/>

&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; confusion<br/>

&gt; &gt; CA .. I could find an exclusive one here today.. but I&#39;m a hardass :)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Working on a webpage today as it is :) Gonna make a group &lt;G&gt; there <br/>
&gt; &gt; HAVE<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be more people around here unhappy with the current situation :)..<br/>
&gt; &gt; next stop.. flyers for the libraries!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; moment&gt;&gt;<br/>
