<br/>
The teachers can do it as well as the doctors, seeing as how there&#39;s  <br/>
no such &quot;disease.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of people are that way.<br/>
School doesn&#39;t LIKE people who are that way (unless they can be  <br/>
charming and make A&#39;s, as did moi and many others).<br/>
<br/>
So if school is the priority and children are expendable and TV can  <br/>
be blamed...<br/>
There it is!<br/>
