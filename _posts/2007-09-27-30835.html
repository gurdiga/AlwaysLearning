<div id="ygrps-yiv-1355860107">I need some help getting my (and DH&#39;s) concerns under control.<br/>
 <br/>
Before we found whole-life unschooling, Wyl was restricted with regard to  <br/>
sugar when he was young (though he didn&#39;t really seem to care or ask for much),  <br/>
and very restricted in/to &quot;non-organic&quot; foods up until he was about 4, then <br/>
it  was &quot;controlled&quot;. About the time that I had so much trouble with my <br/>
pregnancy  with Storm (Wyl was about 5) and after he was born, attempts at  <br/>
regulation/control were gone out the window (5 1/2 years old).<br/>
 <br/>
When we first started unschooling throughout our lives (instead of just  <br/>
academically), I would buy candy, kind of based on a serving size (from the  <br/>
package nutrition list) and doubling it, so he had 2 servings of candy per day  *at <br/>
least*-if it went over, that was fine, but it had to be a minimum of 2 daily  <br/>
servings until we went shopping again. We did this with snack foods (chips,  <br/>
pretzels, etc.), candy, cookies and whatever other &quot;not really nutritious&quot; <br/>
foods  he picked out at the store. Many of them were organic, and we (parents) <br/>
were  cool with whatever he chose. He has a shelf (well, now its more than just <br/>
&quot;a  shelf&quot;) that it was all on, accessible whenever he wanted, no asking  <br/>
required-BUT, if he ran out before grocery day, there was no more until we went  <br/>
shopping. He ate everything in the first hours we got home, at first. Then, as  <br/>
the weeks passed, it slowed down to where it was lasting until shopping day, <br/>
and  sometimes even beyond, so I thought we had found our balance, there. Then <br/>
 pop came into it (soda, soda pop, cola, carbonated drinks, fizzies-whatever <br/>
you  call it where you are). It was limited to one a week. Then, I saw how it <br/>
started  figuring largely in his life, and so we expanded that to a 4 pack per <br/>
shopping  trip. Sometime within this period, we discovered his allergy to <br/>
HFCS, and so we  have to make sure to buy things without it-sugar based soda <br/>
seems to be in the  &quot;all natural&quot; realm and is very expensive, and expense had <br/>
figured largely into  things in certain periods of our lives.<br/>
 <br/>
At least a year ago, we removed all non-money restrictions on candy (I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking its more like 2 years, but I&#39;m not positive). I&#39;m not sure  when the <br/>
upswing in candy consumption began, but I&#39;m  thinking 6-9 months. Candy does not <br/>
last a week in our house, no matter how  much we buy. There&#39;s been weeks when <br/>
we could afford it, that I&#39;ve bought 2  of the biggest packages of candy he <br/>
could find (his choice) at the warehouse  club-we&#39;re talking about $25 just in <br/>
candy, so they were very large-I didn&#39;t  even check the servings. Sometimes <br/>
we&#39;d add a small item or two that he  requested while shopping at another store <br/>
as well. Still, gone within a  week. It concerns me because he truly fills up <br/>
on it and isn&#39;t hungry for  nutritious food. Some days I can manage to get <br/>
breakfast to him before he&#39;s had  more than 1 or 2 pieces of candy, and then he at <br/>
least gets one full meal in,  but he seems to &quot;live for candy&quot;. I&#39;ve tried <br/>
big bags of candy, large portions,  individual little packages (snack size, fun <br/>
size-like for Halloween). I&#39;ve tried  designating &quot;Wyl&#39;s candy&quot; and &quot;family <br/>
candy&quot; (he eats all his and  then starts asking for the small bit that is <br/>
&quot;family candy&quot;). I&#39;ve  tried putting it all out in a large bowl right on their table <br/>
so it is always in  arm&#39;s reach, on the shelves they can reach and up high <br/>
where I can only  reach-well, until Wyl started climbing-so I could get it for <br/>
them and say &quot;yes&quot;  every time they asked. He seems to get some nutrition, <br/>
because he has energy and  looks healthy, but I do have a *very* slight concern <br/>
that he&#39;s starting to get  winded while playing and he&#39;s starting to look a wee <br/>
bit flabby around the  torso. Nothing I&#39;m highly concerned about, just <br/>
*noticing*. Its mostly the  volume of consumption and the possible lack of nutrition <br/>
that I&#39;m mildly  concerned about. And slightly annoyed at the constant layer <br/>
of candy wrappers  all over the house, as well as discarded/dropped sticky <br/>
candy bits in the couch  and carpet. (Storm tends to put a piece in his mouth, <br/>
bite down, decide he  doesn&#39;t like it and then deposit it in the most convenient <br/>
place-for him.)<br/>
 <br/>
Pop, however, is a biggie for me. He often drinks so much, he hasn&#39;t room  to <br/>
eat anything nutritious. I was really excited last week to find sugar-pop at  <br/>
Super Walmart! It was 2 days after we had done our grocery shopping, so I had <br/>
 already gotten his 4 pack of bottles and 6 pack of cans (probably $10-13 for <br/>
 both), but I was just SO excited finding it somewhere more accessible than <br/>
our  organic market AND under $3 for an 8-pack of cans that I bought it, too. <br/>
Within  5 days (I don&#39;t pay close attention to how much he drinks by the day, <br/>
because it  would freak me out, so I try to ignore it as much as humanly <br/>
possible), all 18  containers of pop were gone. Add to that the minor annoyance of <br/>
pop cans that he  likes to bend and twist apart and leave lying on the floor <br/>
all sharp and pointy,  pop tabs torn off & bottle caps and left everywhere, and <br/>
whole  cans and bottles tossed on the floor, behind the couch, on the <br/>
furniture, in the  yard-wherever it lands. I&#39;m NOT comfortable with chemical <br/>
sugar-substitute  sweeteners, but he&#39;s found a flavored water that has aspartame in it, <br/>
and I will  buy him one a week-no more. He&#39;s not offered to buy any pop on <br/>
his own with his  allowance, but I certainly couldn&#39;t say no to that... (He does <br/>
 occasionally insist on buying candy with his allowance, even when we  offer <br/>
to buy it for him.) I also have serious concerns about the  phosphorous and <br/>
its affect on the calcium in bones-especially growing bones, and  that is really <br/>
the &quot;big green monster&quot; of my worry about pop. I&#39;ve talked to DH  about <br/>
brewing pop at home so we can avoid that all together, and he&#39;s got the  equipment <br/>
and is willing, but his work just doesn&#39;t allow him much time for  stuff like <br/>
that. I can&#39;t find a brewed soda anywhere to buy.<br/>
 <br/>
This is worrying both DH *AND* I, and sometimes DH will gripe to Wyl about  <br/>
it. Every once in a while (like last week with the 18 pops), I will casually  <br/>
comment on the amount/time period. I know sometimes I&#39;m just not aware of my  <br/>
consumption of a thing until its brought to my attention, so I&#39;ll mention <br/>
it-but  without judgment. Occasionally (every 3 months or so?? not sure), I will <br/>
mention  my concern over calcium, and more often, I will put in my 2 cents worth <br/>
about  chemical sweeteners-though not while he&#39;s enjoying his flavored water, <br/>
or near  that time... usually when he&#39;s asking for the second one in a week.<br/>
 <br/>
What&#39;s worse is that DH keeps some diet pop in the house for when he&#39;s home  <br/>
(even though I express my concerns to him about chemical sweeteners, too-he  <br/>
choses to keep drinking it) in 20 oz bottles and Wyl has started drinking DH&#39;s  <br/>
pop. He&#39;ll take one DH hasn&#39;t finished and finish it, and last week, he <br/>
opened  all 5 of the bottles DH had here and took even amounts out of them, so they <br/>
all  looked equal, but the pop level was below the label. The &quot;sneaking&quot; is <br/>
my alarm  bell-we definitely need to adjust something somewhere.<br/>
 <br/>
Oddly enough, sometimes, its not the *consumption* that seems to be the big  <br/>
thing. He&#39;ll swish it in his mouth a long time before drinking it. Or he&#39;ll <br/>
put  some in his mouth and spit it in cool arcs in the yard or make wet patterns <br/>
on  the porch or sidewalk. Sometimes, he&#39;ll shake one up and open it just to <br/>
watch  the fizz go all over. Or just pour it out of the can/bottle to make <br/>
neat  patterns. He must have used half his pop in this way about 3 weeks ago. <br/>
Last  week, it was all drunk and drunk one right after the other, fast. Sometimes <br/>
it  makes me think of chain-smoking... He chugs one down, leaves the can on <br/>
the  table and goes for another-sometimes 3-5 in a row like this (not <br/>
sure-again, I  try not to notice too much).<br/>
 <br/>
I know there&#39;s a line there somewhere between trust and protection and with  <br/>
some things I&#39;m good and I know that line, but with internal things like  <br/>
nutrition and healthy bones that you can&#39;t *measure* damage or lack thereof, I  <br/>
have a hard time with finding that line. Things that cause bone breakage,  <br/>
sprains, scrapes, bruises, splinters, punctures, cuts, rashes, etc. I&#39;m  very good <br/>
at balancing information given and trusting that if something *does*  happen, <br/>
I can cope, assess, do damage control, and reassure. I have loads of  <br/>
information/experience tucked away in my head about that, having had a large  share of <br/>
injuries as a kid (and since) and dealing with them. I&#39;m sure a good  portion <br/>
of this whole thing is we parents needing to relax a bit and deal, but I  <br/>
don&#39;t know *how* to do that.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Sang<br/>
<br/>
Wyl 4/99 and Storm 10/04<br/>
 <br/>
Oh, an afterthought-we have parades here where they throw candy to the kids  <br/>
along the parade route and tootsie rolls are very cheap and most parade units  <br/>
throw those. Both boys *have* had their fill of tootsie rolls (at least the  <br/>
chocolate ones), and neither will eat them  anymore.<br/>
<br/>

Your post was kind of exhausting.  It felt like a flood of  pressure,  <br/>
counting, measurements, lack of approval and paranoia and allergy and  <br/>
ingredients.<br/>
<br/>
You wrote &quot;I can cope, assess, do damage control, and reassure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That sounds exhausting, too.<br/>
<br/>

of this whole thing is we parents needing to relax a bit and deal, but I<br/>
don&#39;t know *how* to do that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
By breathing more slowly and deeply.  By looking at your child  <br/>
directly and gently and quietly, I think.  There seems to be a load  <br/>
of noise and activity and you seem to be seeing him through a filter  <br/>
crowded with the names of ingredients, and of dangers about damage.   <br/>
That in itself is guaranteed to be damaging.  The other damage is  <br/>
theoretical.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Things that cause bone breakage,<br/>
sprains, scrapes, bruises, splinters, punctures, cuts, rashes, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Things like playing?  Running?<br/>
<br/>
My husband had several broken bones as a kid, was kicked by a horse  <br/>
(stepped on, on his calf, actually, and it stayed funky), was on a  <br/>
bike that had the brakes go out and he ended up under a bus and in  <br/>
the hospital where he knew nothing of where he was but that they were  <br/>
staying with &quot;Uncle Ed&quot; (his mom&#39;s brother, so different last name).<br/>
<br/>
Marty was so much like him and so brave that we feared--or rather  <br/>
*expected*--that Marty would be in the hospital, but he never has  <br/>
been.  We expected, and predicted, that Marty would be in jail for  <br/>
reckless behavior.  He&#39;s a good guy. He&#39;s 18 and no such thing.   <br/>
Those predictions and fears did more damage to our view of him than  <br/>
should have been done.  We wasted our worrying.<br/>
<br/>
But more, in general:<br/>
<br/>
Limitations and labels, on the part of the parents, can make things  <br/>
turn valuable and desirable.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/respect">http://sandradodd.com/respect</a><br/>
That&#39;s been our experience.<br/>
<br/>
Give them so much of everything you have (especially attention and  <br/>
trust) that they&#39;re not needy.  If they seem needy, provide  <br/>
lovingly,  not grudgingly.   Try not to send them the bill.   <br/>
Sometimes I remind someone how much he has or what it cost, and just  <br/>
about every time I regret it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-94386246">Dear Sang~<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t misunderstand me here but I really don&#39;t understand what on<br/>
earth this has to do with unschooling other than the fact that you feel<br/>
unable/guilty to take hold of the situation in fear that taking charge<br/>
would somehow harm your son&#39;s self esteem or cause him to question<br/>
himself which in turn might have some future negative consequence that<br/>
he will be unable to work through.  I have read enough other posts to<br/>
see that some people believe unschooling to mean we should place no<br/>
boundaries  or restrictions on our children but I do not agree<br/>
completely with that thinking. Children need to know how to make a good<br/>
decision. I will go as far as to say they look for that direction and<br/>
leadership in parents at times.<br/>
<br/>
Your child is addicted to sugar, colorings, additives etc.. Can&#39;t you<br/>
see that? I mean no disrespect but you are the parent and when a child<br/>
is in danger we as parents are to intercede on their behalf- protect<br/>
them. Perhaps you do not see the gravity of the situation. This is not<br/>
the occasional treat this is a huge problem. He can not make a good<br/>
choice for himself at this point. Something bigger than himself is now<br/>
in control- the sugar, etc.  The whole situation has consumed you and<br/>
your family! You are spending a small fortune on this stuff. What are<br/>
you teaching him about proper money management and have you considered<br/>
the fact that you are supporting a terrible industry who&#39;s main<br/>
objective is to make money and create a generation of people addicted to<br/>
their products?<br/>
<br/>
I understand this problem came on gradually but the mentality in the<br/>
beginning was wrong- IMO of course. There will be people who will<br/>
disagree with me but what I think you should do is 1st educate yourself<br/>
on the addictive/harmful nature of the ingredients within the candy,<br/>
soda etc- what you will find, among other things, is that when one is<br/>
consuming these products  the brain & body in turn suffers greatly<br/>
rendering cognitive problems as well as a host of other terrible<br/>
symptoms of the addiction. I am not exaggerating here.  What does<br/>
someone do when dealing with a person who is addicted to a substance-<br/>
well they certainly don&#39;t encourage and support it. When you are<br/>
educated you will be able to share the information with your DH and your<br/>
son. And when you have sat down and spoken with them you should try to<br/>
push off the fear that you can&#39;t place a boundary. Why not? You love him<br/>
and sometimes that means you have to step in. I have a friend who was<br/>
raised in a vegetarian household. Her parents never bought meat and<br/>
would not allow it in the home but would not restrict her when outside<br/>
the home. She had her carnivorous moments/ years when curiosity or just<br/>
plain convenience took over but has come back to her roots and she<br/>
respects her parents for there stand. It was their home after all. They<br/>
respected her and vise versa. Your stand will matter to him eventually.<br/>
He may be mad now but it is for his greater good.<br/>
<br/>
I do understand the concern of many that if I place any restrictions<br/>
etc... that my kids will suffer but there are times, occasions when<br/>
someone has to take the helm. This, I believe, is one of those times.<br/>
Your concern should not be taken under control but rather the behavior.<br/>
&quot; Before we found whole-life unschooling, Wyl was restricted with regard<br/>
to<br/>
  sugar when he was young (though he didn&#39;t really seem to care or ask<br/>
for much),<br/>
  and very restricted in/to &quot;non-organic&quot; foods up until he was about 4,<br/>
then<br/>
  it  was &quot;controlled&quot;.<br/>

&gt; all sharp and pointy,  pop tabs torn off & bottle caps and left<br/>
everywhere, and<br/>
&gt; whole  cans and bottles tossed on the floor, behind the couch, on the<br/>
&gt; furniture, in the  yard-wherever it lands. I&#39;m NOT comfortable with<br/>
chemical<br/>
&gt; sugar-substitute  sweeteners, but he&#39;s found a flavored water that has<br/>
aspartame in it,<br/>
&gt; and I will  buy him one a week-no more. He&#39;s not offered to buy any<br/>
pop on<br/>
&gt; his own with his  allowance, but I certainly couldn&#39;t say no to<br/>
that... (He does<br/>
&gt;  occasionally insist on buying candy with his allowance, even when we <br/>
offer<br/>
&gt; to buy it for him.) I also have serious concerns about the <br/>
phosphorous and<br/>
&gt; its affect on the calcium in bones-especially growing bones, and  that<br/>
is really<br/>
&gt; the &quot;big green monster&quot; of my worry about pop. I&#39;ve talked to DH <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; brewing pop at home so we can avoid that all together, and he&#39;s got<br/>
the  equipment<br/>
&gt; and is willing, but his work just doesn&#39;t allow him much time for <br/>
stuff like<br/>
&gt; that. I can&#39;t find a brewed soda anywhere to buy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is worrying both DH *AND* I, and sometimes DH will gripe to Wyl<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; it. Every once in a while (like last week with the 18 pops), I will<br/>
casually<br/>
&gt; comment on the amount/time period. I know sometimes I&#39;m just not aware<br/>
of my<br/>
&gt; consumption of a thing until its brought to my attention, so I&#39;ll<br/>
mention<br/>
&gt; it-but  without judgment. Occasionally (every 3 months or so?? not<br/>
sure), I will<br/>
&gt; mention  my concern over calcium, and more often, I will put in my 2<br/>
cents worth<br/>
&gt; about  chemical sweeteners-though not while he&#39;s enjoying his flavored<br/>
water,<br/>
&gt; or near  that time... usually when he&#39;s asking for the second one in a<br/>
week.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What&#39;s worse is that DH keeps some diet pop in the house for when he&#39;s<br/>
home<br/>
&gt; (even though I express my concerns to him about chemical sweeteners,<br/>
too-he<br/>
&gt; choses to keep drinking it) in 20 oz bottles and Wyl has started<br/>
drinking DH&#39;s<br/>
&gt; pop. He&#39;ll take one DH hasn&#39;t finished and finish it, and last week,<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; opened  all 5 of the bottles DH had here and took even amounts out of<br/>
them, so they<br/>
&gt; all  looked equal, but the pop level was below the label. The<br/>
&quot;sneaking&quot; is<br/>
&gt; my alarm  bell-we definitely need to adjust something somewhere.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oddly enough, sometimes, its not the *consumption* that seems to be<br/>
the big<br/>
&gt; thing. He&#39;ll swish it in his mouth a long time before drinking it. Or<br/>
he&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; put  some in his mouth and spit it in cool arcs in the yard or make<br/>
wet patterns<br/>
&gt; on  the porch or sidewalk. Sometimes, he&#39;ll shake one up and open it<br/>
just to<br/>
&gt; watch  the fizz go all over. Or just pour it out of the can/bottle to<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; neat  patterns. He must have used half his pop in this way about 3<br/>
weeks ago.<br/>
&gt; Last  week, it was all drunk and drunk one right after the other,<br/>
fast. Sometimes<br/>
&gt; it  makes me think of chain-smoking... He chugs one down, leaves the<br/>
can on<br/>
&gt; the  table and goes for another-sometimes 3-5 in a row like this (not<br/>
&gt; sure-again, I  try not to notice too much).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know there&#39;s a line there somewhere between trust and protection and<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; some things I&#39;m good and I know that line, but with internal things<br/>
like<br/>
&gt; nutrition and healthy bones that you can&#39;t *measure* damage or lack<br/>
thereof, I<br/>
&gt; have a hard time with finding that line. Things that cause bone<br/>
breakage,<br/>
&gt; sprains, scrapes, bruises, splinters, punctures, cuts, rashes, etc.<br/>
I&#39;m  very good<br/>
&gt; at balancing information given and trusting that if something *does* <br/>
happen,<br/>
&gt; I can cope, assess, do damage control, and reassure. I have loads of<br/>
&gt; information/experience tucked away in my head about that, having had a<br/>
large  share of<br/>
&gt; injuries as a kid (and since) and dealing with them. I&#39;m sure a good <br/>
portion<br/>
&gt; of this whole thing is we parents needing to relax a bit and deal, but<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know *how* to do that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Peace,<br/>
&gt; Sang<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Wyl 4/99 and Storm 10/04<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Oh, an afterthought-we have parades here where they throw candy to the<br/>
kids<br/>
&gt; along the parade route and tootsie rolls are very cheap and most<br/>
parade units<br/>
&gt; throw those. Both boys *have* had their fill of tootsie rolls (at<br/>
least the<br/>
&gt; chocolate ones), and neither will eat them  anymore.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1499890742">I hesitated and considered rejecting the post to which I&#39;m responding  <br/>
below, but decided it was worth responses (and I figure there will be  <br/>
several).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Please don&#39;t misunderstand me here but I really don&#39;t understand  <br/>
what on<br/>
earth this has to do with unschooling other than the fact that you feel<br/>
unable/guilty to take hold of the situation in fear that taking charge<br/>
would somehow harm your son&#39;s self esteem or cause him to question<br/>
himself which in turn might have some future negative consequence that<br/>
he will be unable to work through.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That is one LONG, long sentence to say &quot;I really don&#39;t understand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To add &quot;...what on earth&quot; to it is an insult to the writer and to   <br/>
unschoolers who do understand.<br/>
<br/>
-=-...other than the fact that you feel unable/guilty to take hold of  <br/>
the situation in fear that taking charge...-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Taking charge&quot; is not the premise of what will make natural learning  <br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have read enough other posts to<br/>
see that some people believe unschooling to mean we should place no<br/>
boundaries or restrictions on our children but I do not agree<br/>
completely with that thinking.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You haven&#39;t read enough.<br/>
There isn&#39;t a family here with NO boundaries or restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
There are hundreds of families here with fewer arbitrary and  <br/>
controlling boundaries and restrictions than they once had.<br/>
There are many families here who have more restrictions now than they  <br/>
will have later.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Children need to know how to make a good decision. I will go as  <br/>
far as to say they look for that direction and<br/>
leadership in parents at times.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Please read MUCH more before you go so far as to say something that  <br/>
is SO totally obvious.  Yes, children need to learn how to  make good  <br/>
decisions, and if they trust their parents and like them, they will  <br/>
look for direction and leadership from their parents just about ALL  <br/>
the time.  My 21 year old has called me several times since he moved  <br/>
out to discuss decisions, procedures, and to get advice on all kinds  <br/>
of things.  He has been learning how to make good decisions his whole  <br/>
life, and without a lot of boundaries and restrictions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Your child is addicted to sugar, colorings, additives etc.. Can&#39;t you<br/>
see that? I mean no disrespect but...-=-<br/>
<br/>
NO OFFENSE, but (another phrase that always precedes something  <br/>
offensive)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Your child is addicted to sugar, colorings, additives etc.. Can&#39;t you<br/>
see that?-=-<br/>
<br/>
YOU can&#39;t see that from where you are.  To declare an addiction is  <br/>
wrong.  To look for and hope for addictions is wrong, but parents all  <br/>
over the place are EAGER to find out what their child is allergic to  <br/>
or addicted to so the parents can (they hope) magically change the  <br/>
child&#39;s behavior and attitude by withholding or requiring foods.   <br/>
It&#39;s an epidemic, and it&#39;s embarrassing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Something bigger than himself is now in control- the sugar, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If we were in person I would have done a stage shriek, but someone  <br/>
else would have beat me to it.  &quot;Something bigger than himself is now  <br/>
in control&quot; sounds like what fundamentalist say about Satan and the  <br/>
devil&#39;s control of children through video games, cartoons, rock and/ <br/>
or roll...<br/>
<br/>
What is bigger than compassion, mindfulness  and logic?  Not sugar.   <br/>
Not TV.<br/>
<br/>
-=Your stand will matter to him eventually.<br/>
He may be mad now but it is for his greater good.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what they say about school, you know.<br/>
That&#39;s what they say about every single parental abuse from spanking  <br/>
to grounding to forbidding friends to visit.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Your concern should not be taken under control but rather the  <br/>
behavior.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re spending time trying to decide where the control should be  <br/>
placed, and that missed the whole point of parents being their  <br/>
children&#39;s partners and advocates.<br/>
<br/>
-=when one is<br/>
consuming these products the brain & body in turn suffers greatly<br/>
rendering cognitive problems as well as a host of other terrible<br/>
symptoms of the addiction. I am not exaggerating here. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes you are.  In some people&#39;s world the sky is falling, and they&#39;re  <br/>
responding to that, and glad it&#39;s falling, I think, because that  <br/>
justifies control.  I think the president is kinda glad there are  <br/>
terrorists because it feels good to control people and tell them it&#39;s  <br/>
for their own good.<br/>
<br/>
People have priorities in their lives.  Their beliefs and concerns  <br/>
are ranked.  Their desires are ranked.<br/>
<br/>
Families in which their children aren&#39;t right up there in the top  <br/>
three or so will not succeed at unschooling, I don&#39;t think.  If the  <br/>
fear of sugar has a greater priority than helping children learn,  <br/>
then that family is a sugar-activist family, more than an unschooling  <br/>
family.  There are lots of issues and concerns that can come before  <br/>
children in a family&#39;s life.  If children are too far down the line,  <br/>
this list won&#39;t be a good place for them to learn about what&#39;s  <br/>
important to them.<br/>
<br/>
All over the world you can find &quot;proof&quot; and &quot;evidence&quot; that the sky  <br/>
is falling.  This list isn&#39;t intended to be everything to everybody,  <br/>
nor everything to anyone.  It&#39;s intended to discuss unschooling in  <br/>
light of the experiences of those who have done it long and  <br/>
successfully.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
listowner<br/>
unschooling mother of Kirby (21), Marty (18), and Holly (15) who are  <br/>
NOT sugar addicts, who are not addicted to anything, who have not had  <br/>
their foods counted or measured nor their lives controlled, who have  <br/>
been making good decisions since they were little kids, based on  <br/>
principles and not rules<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744056218"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I need some help getting my (and DH&#39;s) concerns under control.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First of all, it is good that you are asking for help for your own concerns.<br/>
That is the place to start. I&#39;m glad you aren&#39;t asking (at least up front)<br/>
how to change your son&#39;s behavior. That needs to come from him, if it is<br/>
going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to mention that nowhere in your post did I see how you share<br/>
information with your son. One part of his decision-making comes from<br/>
information he has...not information given with tainted view or desperate<br/>
feelings, but straight-forward information. Ask him how he feels after he&#39;s<br/>
consumed a large amount of sugar. Maybe he feels great. Maybe he really is<br/>
physically suffering but isn&#39;t paying attention to it, and a simple question<br/>
about it will connect him. You can share information of studies and such but<br/>
with the highlight that studies are often conducted or financed by the<br/>
organization who will benefit most from the findings. Maybe you have sources<br/>
you trust and can share that as well.<br/>
<br/>
He is on a journey and it can be a lot different from what you think it<br/>
should be. Your role in this is to share information,   support, engage in<br/>
joyful activities and be joyful. This issue does seem to be a focus for you,<br/>
based on the amount you wrote about it, and that is surely loud and clear to<br/>
your son. Find some great and surprising stuff to do...take your (and his)<br/>
attention to great places.<br/>

addicted. People do not crave unhealthy foods naturally. There is proof<br/>
that these substances are addictive and very unhealthy and the food<br/>
manufactures know this. I am not HOPING there is a problem- just like<br/>

<br/>
-=-Well thank you. I appreciate the freedom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It was more license than freedom.  You have TONS of freedom, but not  <br/>
in my house, and this list is pretty much an extension of my house.<br/>
<br/>
If you make your own yahoo list, you can (and would have to) decide  <br/>
the topic and who could join and post, and when what they posted was  <br/>
sufficiently off topic or irritating to need to be prevented.<br/>
<br/>
-=-You can be rather blunt yourself, I feel this is serious and am<br/>
expressing my viewpoint- as everyone else does here.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I can be blunt in my own home, certainly.  And I&#39;m blunt in defense  <br/>
of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I just told some technicians who are here that it was fine with me if  <br/>
they drilled a hole from one room to another.  I can tell them that.   <br/>
They can do that because it&#39;s my house and I agreed to it.    If  <br/>
anyone else here drills holes in my house or gives anyone else the go- <br/>
ahead to drill holes in my house, I&#39;ll either throw you out or call  <br/>
the police.  Maybe both.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; &quot;Taking charge&quot; is not the premise of what will make natural  <br/>
learning<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; work.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-I am not talking about removing basic human rights here or rendering<br/>
null a learning environment- I am talking about protection.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If the learning environment involves a child learning about his own  <br/>
needs and desires and the effects of different foods, then  <br/>
&quot;protection&quot; renders null that learning environment.   The controls  <br/>
that were on the child when he was  younger created the desire, quite  <br/>
likely.  Countless adults, when discussing their eating habits talk  <br/>
about desires they had as children that were unfulfilled, and  <br/>
shamings they received.  My own parents drank and smoked and wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
let my cousin have seconds on milk.  When we had grapes my mother  <br/>
counted them out.  If there were donuts, and six of us, each person  <br/>
got two.  The taking of a third donut was like a huge family  <br/>
felony.   I don&#39;t want to even start on my husband&#39;s mothers creepy  <br/>
food &quot;protections&quot; and rules.  He binges to this day, and he&#39;s 51  <br/>
years old, and it is totally due to her shaming, which still continues.<br/>
<br/>
There are many unschooling families and other families not  <br/>
unschooling who have, from exposure through La Leche League or  <br/>
overeaters&#39; recovery groups, who have shown with their own children  <br/>
that gentle freedom is a world apart from measuring and shaming and  <br/>
blaming behaviors on foods.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m in my 50&#39;s too, and have lived through many fads and assurances  <br/>
of what&#39;s better than other things, and what will surely kill.   If  <br/>
there were no alcoholics or smokers my age or older, I might start to  <br/>
seriously consider the dire &quot;it will kill you&quot; warnings.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gone through &quot;margarine is better for you than butter&quot; and &quot;I  <br/>
can&#39;t believe we were eating margarine.&quot;   Hamburgers have gone  <br/>
through every permutation of which part is healthy and which will  <br/>
kill you.  Every part except the pickles and the tomato have been  <br/>
reviled and then praised.  I&#39;ve seen people ask for just the meat and  <br/>
cheese and I&#39;ve seen people ask for all BUT the meat and cheese, in  <br/>
the name of &quot;protection.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The most valuable thing about margarine, hamburgers, alcohol and  <br/>
tobacco might be the lessons to be learned from listening to the  <br/>
propaganda, and then learning to look with our own eyes at what  <br/>
actually *is* in the absence of frightful warnings and unproven  <br/>
claims and chic fads.<br/>
<br/>
-=-All I as saying is that how can a child respect a parent who  <br/>
allows such<br/>
irresponsible behavior, who fears using there own knowledge to make a<br/>
situation better for everyone involved?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I know dozens of unschooled teens and young adults who respect their  <br/>
parents greatly, AND whose parents never did fear using their own  <br/>
knowledge to make a situation better.<br/>
<br/>
You seem to want someone to use what you read somewhere else to make  <br/>
a situation more like your own.<br/>
<br/>
This list is for sharing personal experiences with natural learning,  <br/>
not for sharing scary websites.  Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
-=- People do not crave unhealthy foods naturally.-=-<br/>
They don&#39;t crave foods unnaturally, do they?<br/>
<br/>
People crave freedom and choice.  When that&#39;s removed, there is a  <br/>
reaction.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am not HOPING there is a problem- just like<br/>
you Sandra I state it the way I see it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you aren&#39;t stating things that will help others unschool, then  <br/>
you&#39;re not doing just like I am.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Changing what we put into our<br/>
bodies will change our behavior- absolutely! The opposite hold true- why<br/>
do people choose to put there children on mind altering medications?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t put  my children on mind-altering medications; do you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-To control the child- healthy food, free of junk will pull out  <br/>
peoples<br/>
potential- free them.-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
Did the first part of that sentence refer to the mind-altering  <br/>
medications?<br/>

I can  very honestly say regarding this<br/>
situation and from the original post that  it appears to me he is<br/>
addicted. People do not crave unhealthy foods  naturally. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere did I say he &quot;craved&quot; these things. He turns pop down for other  <br/>
drink choices occasionally. He doesn&#39;t even consume all the pop he gets-he spits  <br/>
some out, pours some out, freezes some into pleasing shapes, then lets them  <br/>
melt. Before I posted, I had an inkling far hidden that it was likely the input <br/>
 from his parents that was helping this &quot;intense interest&quot; in pop along, but <br/>
it  is more clear now that I have, and since I&#39;ve gotten responses. My child <br/>
is not  addicted to anything.<br/>
 <br/>
&lt;The sky is falling- for her- she is seeking help-&gt;<br/>
No, I think its more of a case of having bought into &quot;the sky is falling&quot;  <br/>
that is probably at the crux of my fears. I guess I&#39;ll have to keep searching  <br/>
for unbiased information on phosphorous and calcium loss. I&#39;m seeking help to  <br/>
get over the input from Chicken Little.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just gotta point out how enlightened this ^ above sentence is!!<br/>
The very best place to begin is my own thoughts that stand in my way --<br/>
somehow it&#39;s never about the kid, is it? ::bg::<br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;d recommend losing (internal *&* external) judgment over what&#39;s<br/>
nutritious and what isn&#39;t. Even candy nourishes. For me, there is something<br/>
soulful in the eating of my favorite sweet. I&#39;ve worked hard to quiet the<br/>
voice telling *me* I&#39;m creating another dimple on my ass and to focus on the<br/>
voice that&#39;s saying &quot;thanks, that&#39;s just what I needed, right here, right<br/>
now&quot;  Personally, I really don&#39;t like sundrops over M&Ms, so sometimes the<br/>
*organic* or *healthier* options just don&#39;t taste good. Organic Coca-Cola<br/>
that actually tastes good??? &#39;twould be my dream come true!!! (as a second,<br/>
better option I sometimes treat myself to an imported from Mexico coke, as<br/>
it&#39;s still made with cane sugar :::vbg:::)<br/>
<br/>
Is there a fear in him that you&#39;re going to begin restricting his candy?? Is<br/>
he feeling your disapproval and thereby binging before it&#39;s taken away?? Can<br/>
you bring more chocolate, maybe more chocolate with nuts, so you&#39;re able to<br/>
see some nutritive benefits while he enjoys? How about *making* candy<br/>
together? Bringing candy in as a worthy member of the tribe might help him<br/>
see the permanence of the availability.<br/>
Can you shift your perspective to one of 1-year or 5-years and see the<br/>
spikes and dips in his sweet consumption? there&#39;s a natural ebb and flow...<br/>
Hayden does sugar spikes and also does protein spikes, where he&#39;ll only eat<br/>
meat (no veggies, no fruit, no breads) for a week or longer. I&#39;m cooking<br/>
burger after burger and steak after steak and chicken breast after chicken<br/>
breast and then --suddenly-- he wants a spinach salad. I&#39;ve been concerned<br/>
about his size, and knowing how incredibly UNHELPFUL it was to have family<br/>
make comment on my body as a child (gotta love it when morbidly obese folks<br/>
call a gangly 14-year old &quot;Thunder Thighs&quot;) I&#39;ve made sure not to comment to<br/>
him. HE has made comment to me about his own comfort with his body<br/>
style/shape and what can be done about it. We&#39;ll talk lightly about food<br/>
choices, mostly focusing on &quot;moving more&quot; not on good vs bad foods.<br/>
Sometimes we talk about the &quot;why&quot; of eating and what leads to the obesity we<br/>
see so prevalent in my family; after he asks or comments, not in response to<br/>
*his* eating.<br/>
<br/>
Add to that the minor annoyance of<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pop cans that he likes to bend and twist apart and leave lying on the<br/>
&gt; floor<br/>
&gt; all sharp and pointy, pop tabs torn off & bottle caps and left everywhere,<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; whole cans and bottles tossed on the floor, behind the couch, on the<br/>
&gt; furniture, in the yard-wherever it lands.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does he know cans=cash? This helped with Hayden (who loves all things<br/>
money!) keeping cans collected in one spot so we can cash them in (a big<br/>
bonus in our move to OR is the machines where we put the can in and get a<br/>
nickel each). We also have a little container for our tabs to help the<br/>
Ronald McDonald house. I found putting a small garbage can near the candy<br/>
eating section helps -- maybe not him, but I don&#39;t have so far to go when<br/>
I&#39;m picking them up!! Our cousin made long chains from starburst and mamba<br/>
wrappers (I think I saw Abbi doing that at L&L??) which is another great<br/>
incentive to collect the wrappers and keep them from getting thrown/blown<br/>
away.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m NOT comfortable with chemical sugar-substitute sweeteners,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I confess this is a *BIG* one with me!! We do read labels, definitely as an<br/>
&quot;informed consent&quot; not restriction. Hayden knows his dad had a brain tumor.<br/>
Hayden knows dad&#39;s doctors told him *never* to have nutrasweet. Hayden knows<br/>
it freaks me out. Hayden knows he has choice about what happens to his body.<br/>
<br/>
Just last night he bought a big pack of Juicy Fruit (it now has sugar, HFCS<br/>
*&* aspartame, oh wait, AND most recently added yellow food coloring!!!)...<br/>
I didn&#39;t have to say anything except YES with a smile! I didn&#39;t have a<br/>
reaction, he already knows what he needs to know to make his choices. So<br/>
we&#39;re pulling out of the parking lot and he says, &quot;I think it&#39;s okay for me<br/>
to have nutrasweet as I&#39;m just a kid and it&#39;s not as dangerous because I&#39;m<br/>
still growing and changing&quot; &quot;Well,&quot; I said, &quot;I think it&#39;s maybe more<br/>
dangerous for you, as your brain is still developing, building bridges<br/>
between connections and maybe the excitement that nutrasweet causes may<br/>
interfere with that, so it should be safer for me... oh wait, maybe not! at<br/>
my age, the bridges are collapsing and maybe that excitement might cause the<br/>
bridges to crumble more quickly and easily. I don&#39;t know, really, I don&#39;t<br/>
think anyone really does&quot; And that is the truth, we don&#39;t know. For me<br/>
that&#39;s the scary part. For Hayden it&#39;s not. He happily chewed his gum, guilt<br/>
free. It&#39;d sure be nice if Wrigley&#39;s had remained aspartame free, but it<br/>
didn&#39;t. It&#39;s nice my kid can remain food-guilt free.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but he&#39;s found a flavored water that has aspartame in it,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is flavored water with Splenda. Artificial yeah, but not a<br/>
neuroexciter :) Still has an aftertaste to my sugared tongue, not nearly as<br/>
bad as nutrasweet!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Oddly enough, sometimes, its not the *consumption* that seems to be the<br/>
&gt; big<br/>
&gt; thing. He&#39;ll swish it in his mouth a long time before drinking it. Or<br/>
&gt; he&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; put some in his mouth and spit it in cool arcs in the yard or make wet<br/>
&gt; patterns<br/>
&gt; on the porch or sidewalk. Sometimes, he&#39;ll shake one up and open it just<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; watch the fizz go all over. Or just pour it out of the can/bottle to make<br/>
&gt; neat patterns. He must have used half his pop in this way about 3 weeks<br/>
&gt; ago.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve purchased flats of storebrand soda specifically for this purpose!! I&#39;ve<br/>
run over cans with my car, they&#39;ve slammed cans on the ground (which is<br/>
really cool to see!) they&#39;ve shaken and squirted to their hearts delight and<br/>
at less than 10 cents per can, I have no justifiable complaints! Full cans<br/>
of soda on dry ice make really, really cool sounds!!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure a good portion<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; of this whole thing is we parents needing to relax a bit and deal, but I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know *how* to do that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure ya do!! Breathe, baby, breathe!! Smile and love and don&#39;t dwell.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, an afterthought-we have parades here where they throw candy to the kids<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; along the parade route and tootsie rolls are very cheap and most parade<br/>
&gt; units<br/>
&gt; throw those. Both boys *have* had their fill of tootsie rolls (at least<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; chocolate ones), and neither will eat them anymore.<br/>
&gt; .__,_.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re so lucky!! We can&#39;t have candy thrown at our local parades (city<br/>
ordinance!)... they must figger the kids &#39;round here aren&#39;t smart enough to<br/>
distinguish between running in the street at a parade for candy vs running<br/>
into traffic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296244810">I was going to cut and paste and respond, but it just seemed <br/>
overwhelming to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Instead I am going to just give some ideas of which direction I would <br/>
go, if this was my situation.<br/>
<br/>
As for breakfast, I would make a great effort to have food out and <br/>
ready in the kitchen for him when he gets up.  Candy is still an <br/>
option, but other things will be there just as accessible.  One of my <br/>
kids will often eat candy first thing in the morning, then an hour or <br/>
two later is ready for food of another sort.<br/>
<br/>
I have another kid who loves pop very much.  I buy as much as I can <br/>
afford.  She is pretty much the only one who drinks it in the house.  I <br/>
don&#39;t often, my dh sometimes, and the other kid will rarely drink a <br/>
full one and generally wants other things instead.<br/>
<br/>
It seems in your description that it isn&#39;t necessarily about drinking <br/>
it, but about exploring it.  There are so many cool things that you can <br/>
do with pop, like putting calcium vitamins in a glass of it, or putting <br/>
a newly lost tooth, or money, or whatever and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
The history of pop is kinda cool too.  It really was addicting to begin <br/>
with, but it&#39;s not now and that&#39;s cool too.  Go check out some local <br/>
pop breweries if you have some around.  We do here in OR, so that would <br/>
be feasible if you live in the right place.  <br/>
<br/>
Do propulsion expiriments with the carbonation, balloons or rockets or <br/>
whatever.  Use the pop containers for cool things.  Make bowling pins <br/>
out of them or those whirl pool things where you connect two together.<br/>
<br/>
Just explore pop together.  Make side by side blind taste tests with <br/>
varying brands.  Forget about the HFCS for a while and just play around <br/>
with all kinds of pop.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra said something in another post about allergies becoming a new <br/>
fad epidemic.  I would say that seems to be true based on my own <br/>
experiences.  I have always been allergic to dairy, it makes me really <br/>
sick, always has, there&#39;s a genetic component to that.  When I was a <br/>
kid, my sister and I were the only people I knew that were allergic to <br/>
dairy, or anything for that matter, except the occasional kid who was <br/>
allergic to bees or peanuts.  It seems that nowdays, tons of kids have <br/>
allergies to all kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
I have one child who got the dairy allergy passed down.  It makes her <br/>
sick, she knows it and avoids it on her own terms.  I don&#39;t tell her <br/>
that she can&#39;t eat it, I just inform her what has dairy in it and how <br/>
much.  She makes her own decisions and it&#39;s not all or none, and we <br/>
help her when she decides to eat it and feels yucky.  She&#39;s 6.  She <br/>
will more often than not, avoid the offending item altogether.<br/>
<br/>
As for the candy, pop and other even, go to odd stores, foreign stores <br/>
where you can&#39;t read the ingredients and buy unusual stuff.  Mix it up, <br/>
make it an interesting exploration.  Go to Asian markets, or German <br/>
stores or whatever you have near you and buy whatever looks <br/>
interesting.  Make it fun, not about gorging, but more about <br/>
exploration of food that is tasty!</div>

Maybe not &quot;stupid&quot;--they were doing what they had been told and had  <br/>
read was right and healthy and good and right.  They were trying to  <br/>
protect him and help him grow up healthy.<br/>
<br/>
I was told I was allergic to chocolate when I was little, and not to  <br/>
wear nylon underwear.   So I pined for nylon underwear, and when I  <br/>
was older got a bunch of it.  I didn&#39;t like it, it wasn&#39;t good for  <br/>
me.  So I quit wearing it.  Maybe I could&#39;ve figured that out on my  <br/>
own with cheap little-kid panties. &lt;g&gt;  But no, I was made to wear  <br/>
cotton without choosing to, and kept thinking it and feeling deprived.<br/>
<br/>
And the chocolate, that was just nonsense, villifying something they  <br/>
didn&#39;t want kids to have anyway.  The doctor said &quot;She&#39;s allergic to  <br/>
chocolate&quot; and collected his $50 or whatever it was in the &#39;50&#39;s, and  <br/>
that was that for me, for years.  Other kids had chocolate cookies in  <br/>
front of me while I had some crummy substitute, until nobody was  <br/>
looking and then I sneaked it, felt guilty, &quot;knew&quot; I was BAD.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t help my health, physical or mental.  It didn&#39;t help my self  <br/>
image.  It didn&#39;t help the relationship between my parents and me.<br/>
<br/>
We have a drawer in our bedroom with a bunch of dark chocolate.  My  <br/>
husband puts it there.  It stays a long, long time.  Good for us.   <br/>
Chocolate is not all that, but for me it was the forbidden, heavenly,  <br/>
all-important glory that hated me (said a doctor) and I had to live  <br/>
in its shadow, smelling its wondrous scent and knowing I was an  <br/>
inferior, imperfect person.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s too much power to give chocolate, and doctors, and parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747493950">Hi. <br/>
I&#39;ve been lurking here for a while and have now felt moved enough to<br/>
respond to a post.  I feel that there is an important issue here that<br/>
hasn&#39;t been brought up yet, and that is of your son&#39;s health. Here in<br/>
Australia the childhood obesity rate is soaring, and children as young<br/>
as 10 years old are developing type 2 diabetes. It all comes down to<br/>
poor diet and lack of education. Some people here think nothing of<br/>
sending their kids off to school/pre-school with lunch boxes filled<br/>
with sweet sugary foods and even bags of McDonalds!<br/>
I know this forum is all about freedom of choice in life, but when it<br/>
comes to the health of our children I think that some boundaries need<br/>
to be drawn, at least until the child can make an informed decision on<br/>
their own. We brought our children into the world and it is our<br/>
responsibility to look after them, to make sure that they are on the<br/>
right path to a healthy future.<br/>
If I have offended anyone, or inadvertantly critized anyone then I am<br/>
sorry, I really haven&#39;t meant to. <br/>
I love the unschooling philosophy. DH and I just don&#39;t agree with too<br/>
much junk food for anyone. I have had gestational diabetes twice so I<br/>
know the effects and dangers of this disease.<br/>
<br/>
cheers,<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I need some help getting my (and DH&#39;s) concerns under control.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Before we found whole-life unschooling, Wyl was restricted with<br/>
regard to  <br/>
&gt; sugar when he was young (though he didn&#39;t really seem to care or ask<br/>
for much),  <br/>
&gt; and very restricted in/to &quot;non-organic&quot; foods up until he was about<br/>
4, then <br/>
&gt; it  was &quot;controlled&quot;. About the time that I had so much trouble with my <br/>
&gt; pregnancy  with Storm (Wyl was about 5) and after he was born,<br/>
attempts at  <br/>
&gt; regulation/control were gone out the window (5 1/2 years old).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; When we first started unschooling throughout our lives (instead of<br/>
just  <br/>
&gt; academically), I would buy candy, kind of based on a serving size<br/>
(from the  <br/>
&gt; package nutrition list) and doubling it, so he had 2 servings of<br/>
candy per day  *at <br/>
&gt; least*-if it went over, that was fine, but it had to be a minimum of<br/>
2 daily  <br/>
&gt; servings until we went shopping again. We did this with snack foods<br/>
(chips,  <br/>
&gt; pretzels, etc.), candy, cookies and whatever other &quot;not really<br/>
nutritious&quot; <br/>
&gt; foods  he picked out at the store. Many of them were organic, and we<br/>
(parents) <br/>
&gt; were  cool with whatever he chose. He has a shelf (well, now its<br/>
more than just <br/>
&gt; &quot;a  shelf&quot;) that it was all on, accessible whenever he wanted, no<br/>
asking  <br/>
&gt; required-BUT, if he ran out before grocery day, there was no more<br/>
until we went  <br/>
&gt; shopping. He ate everything in the first hours we got home, at<br/>
first. Then, as  <br/>
&gt; the weeks passed, it slowed down to where it was lasting until<br/>
shopping day, <br/>
&gt; and  sometimes even beyond, so I thought we had found our balance,<br/>
there. Then <br/>
&gt;  pop came into it (soda, soda pop, cola, carbonated drinks,<br/>
fizzies-whatever <br/>
&gt; you  call it where you are). It was limited to one a week. Then, I<br/>
saw how it <br/>
&gt; started  figuring largely in his life, and so we expanded that to a<br/>
4 pack per <br/>
&gt; shopping  trip. Sometime within this period, we discovered his<br/>
allergy to <br/>
&gt; HFCS, and so we  have to make sure to buy things without it-sugar<br/>
based soda <br/>
&gt; seems to be in the  &quot;all natural&quot; realm and is very expensive, and<br/>
expense had <br/>
&gt; figured largely into  things in certain periods of our lives.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; At least a year ago, we removed all non-money restrictions on candy<br/>
(I&#39;m  <br/>
&gt; thinking its more like 2 years, but I&#39;m not positive). I&#39;m not sure<br/>
 when the <br/>
&gt; upswing in candy consumption began, but I&#39;m  thinking 6-9 months.<br/>
Candy does not <br/>
&gt; last a week in our house, no matter how  much we buy. There&#39;s been<br/>
weeks when <br/>
&gt; we could afford it, that I&#39;ve bought 2  of the biggest packages of<br/>
candy he <br/>
&gt; could find (his choice) at the warehouse  club-we&#39;re talking about<br/>
$25 just in <br/>
&gt; candy, so they were very large-I didn&#39;t  even check the servings.<br/>
Sometimes <br/>
&gt; we&#39;d add a small item or two that he  requested while shopping at<br/>
another store <br/>
&gt; as well. Still, gone within a  week. It concerns me because he truly<br/>
fills up <br/>
&gt; on it and isn&#39;t hungry for  nutritious food. Some days I can manage<br/>
to get <br/>
&gt; breakfast to him before he&#39;s had  more than 1 or 2 pieces of candy,<br/>
and then he at <br/>
&gt; least gets one full meal in,  but he seems to &quot;live for candy&quot;. I&#39;ve<br/>
tried <br/>
&gt; big bags of candy, large portions,  individual little packages<br/>
(snack size, fun <br/>
&gt; size-like for Halloween). I&#39;ve tried  designating &quot;Wyl&#39;s candy&quot; and<br/>
&quot;family <br/>
&gt; candy&quot; (he eats all his and  then starts asking for the small bit<br/>
that is <br/>
&gt; &quot;family candy&quot;). I&#39;ve  tried putting it all out in a large bowl<br/>
right on their table <br/>
&gt; so it is always in  arm&#39;s reach, on the shelves they can reach and<br/>
up high <br/>
&gt; where I can only  reach-well, until Wyl started climbing-so I could<br/>
get it for <br/>
&gt; them and say &quot;yes&quot;  every time they asked. He seems to get some<br/>
nutrition, <br/>
&gt; because he has energy and  looks healthy, but I do have a *very*<br/>
slight concern <br/>
&gt; that he&#39;s starting to get  winded while playing and he&#39;s starting to<br/>
look a wee <br/>
&gt; bit flabby around the  torso. Nothing I&#39;m highly concerned about, just <br/>
&gt; *noticing*. Its mostly the  volume of consumption and the possible<br/>
lack of nutrition <br/>
&gt; that I&#39;m mildly  concerned about. And slightly annoyed at the<br/>
constant layer <br/>
&gt; of candy wrappers  all over the house, as well as discarded/dropped<br/>
sticky <br/>
&gt; candy bits in the couch  and carpet. (Storm tends to put a piece in<br/>
his mouth, <br/>
&gt; bite down, decide he  doesn&#39;t like it and then deposit it in the<br/>
most convenient <br/>
&gt; place-for him.)<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Pop, however, is a biggie for me. He often drinks so much, he hasn&#39;t<br/>
room  to <br/>
&gt; eat anything nutritious. I was really excited last week to find<br/>
sugar-pop at  <br/>
&gt; Super Walmart! It was 2 days after we had done our grocery shopping,<br/>
so I had <br/>
&gt;  already gotten his 4 pack of bottles and 6 pack of cans (probably<br/>
$10-13 for <br/>
&gt;  both), but I was just SO excited finding it somewhere more<br/>
accessible than <br/>
&gt; our  organic market AND under $3 for an 8-pack of cans that I bought<br/>
it, too. <br/>
&gt; Within  5 days (I don&#39;t pay close attention to how much he drinks by<br/>
the day, <br/>
&gt; because it  would freak me out, so I try to ignore it as much as<br/>
humanly <br/>
&gt; possible), all 18  containers of pop were gone. Add to that the<br/>
minor annoyance of <br/>
&gt; pop cans that he  likes to bend and twist apart and leave lying on<br/>
the floor <br/>
&gt; all sharp and pointy,  pop tabs torn off & bottle caps and left<br/>
everywhere, and <br/>
&gt; whole  cans and bottles tossed on the floor, behind the couch, on the <br/>
&gt; furniture, in the  yard-wherever it lands. I&#39;m NOT comfortable with<br/>
chemical <br/>
&gt; sugar-substitute  sweeteners, but he&#39;s found a flavored water that<br/>
has aspartame in it, <br/>
&gt; and I will  buy him one a week-no more. He&#39;s not offered to buy any<br/>
pop on <br/>
&gt; his own with his  allowance, but I certainly couldn&#39;t say no to<br/>
that... (He does <br/>
&gt;  occasionally insist on buying candy with his allowance, even when<br/>
we  offer <br/>
&gt; to buy it for him.) I also have serious concerns about the <br/>
phosphorous and <br/>
&gt; its affect on the calcium in bones-especially growing bones, and <br/>
that is really <br/>
&gt; the &quot;big green monster&quot; of my worry about pop. I&#39;ve talked to DH  about <br/>
&gt; brewing pop at home so we can avoid that all together, and he&#39;s got<br/>
the  equipment <br/>
&gt; and is willing, but his work just doesn&#39;t allow him much time for <br/>
stuff like <br/>
&gt; that. I can&#39;t find a brewed soda anywhere to buy.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; This is worrying both DH *AND* I, and sometimes DH will gripe to Wyl<br/>
about  <br/>
&gt; it. Every once in a while (like last week with the 18 pops), I will<br/>
casually  <br/>
&gt; comment on the amount/time period. I know sometimes I&#39;m just not<br/>
aware of my  <br/>
&gt; consumption of a thing until its brought to my attention, so I&#39;ll<br/>
mention <br/>
&gt; it-but  without judgment. Occasionally (every 3 months or so?? not<br/>
sure), I will <br/>
&gt; mention  my concern over calcium, and more often, I will put in my 2<br/>
cents worth <br/>
&gt; about  chemical sweeteners-though not while he&#39;s enjoying his<br/>
flavored water, <br/>
&gt; or near  that time... usually when he&#39;s asking for the second one in<br/>
a week.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; What&#39;s worse is that DH keeps some diet pop in the house for when<br/>
he&#39;s home  <br/>
&gt; (even though I express my concerns to him about chemical sweeteners,<br/>
too-he  <br/>
&gt; choses to keep drinking it) in 20 oz bottles and Wyl has started<br/>
drinking DH&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; pop. He&#39;ll take one DH hasn&#39;t finished and finish it, and last week, he <br/>
&gt; opened  all 5 of the bottles DH had here and took even amounts out<br/>
of them, so they <br/>
&gt; all  looked equal, but the pop level was below the label. The<br/>
&quot;sneaking&quot; is <br/>
&gt; my alarm  bell-we definitely need to adjust something somewhere.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Oddly enough, sometimes, its not the *consumption* that seems to be<br/>
the big  <br/>
&gt; thing. He&#39;ll swish it in his mouth a long time before drinking it.<br/>
Or he&#39;ll <br/>
&gt; put  some in his mouth and spit it in cool arcs in the yard or make<br/>
wet patterns <br/>
&gt; on  the porch or sidewalk. Sometimes, he&#39;ll shake one up and open it<br/>
just to <br/>
&gt; watch  the fizz go all over. Or just pour it out of the can/bottle<br/>
to make <br/>
&gt; neat  patterns. He must have used half his pop in this way about 3<br/>
weeks ago. <br/>
&gt; Last  week, it was all drunk and drunk one right after the other,<br/>
fast. Sometimes <br/>
&gt; it  makes me think of chain-smoking... He chugs one down, leaves the<br/>
can on <br/>
&gt; the  table and goes for another-sometimes 3-5 in a row like this (not <br/>
&gt; sure-again, I  try not to notice too much).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I know there&#39;s a line there somewhere between trust and protection<br/>
and with  <br/>
&gt; some things I&#39;m good and I know that line, but with internal things<br/>
like  <br/>
&gt; nutrition and healthy bones that you can&#39;t *measure* damage or lack<br/>
thereof, I  <br/>
&gt; have a hard time with finding that line. Things that cause bone<br/>
breakage,  <br/>
&gt; sprains, scrapes, bruises, splinters, punctures, cuts, rashes, etc.<br/>
I&#39;m  very good <br/>
&gt; at balancing information given and trusting that if something *does*<br/>
 happen, <br/>
&gt; I can cope, assess, do damage control, and reassure. I have loads of  <br/>
&gt; information/experience tucked away in my head about that, having had<br/>
a large  share of <br/>
&gt; injuries as a kid (and since) and dealing with them. I&#39;m sure a good<br/>
 portion <br/>
&gt; of this whole thing is we parents needing to relax a bit and deal,<br/>
but I  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know *how* to do that.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Peace,<br/>
&gt; Sang<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wyl 4/99 and Storm 10/04<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Oh, an afterthought-we have parades here where they throw candy to<br/>
the kids  <br/>
&gt; along the parade route and tootsie rolls are very cheap and most<br/>
parade units  <br/>
&gt; throw those. Both boys *have* had their fill of tootsie rolls (at<br/>
least the  <br/>
&gt; chocolate ones), and neither will eat them  anymore.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

more nutrition. Just thinking it might help you and your dh relax  <br/>

he&#39;s used to store-bought candy. But, things like homemade rice  <br/>
crispy treats, oatmeal chocolate chip cookies or peanut-butter balls  <br/>
or banana slices dipped in chocolate and frozen. Nuts - every sauteed  <br/>
raw almonds with a little butter and cinnamon? Heavenly. Or, ice  <br/>
cream with nut toppings, smoothies, frozen yogurt, frozen grapes,  <br/>
baked apple slices with cinnamon, apple or pear slices dipped in  <br/>
melted chocolate or caramel. Seems like you can indulge his sweet  <br/>
tooth and increase the nutrition content. Maybe if you focus on  <br/>
finding somewhat more nutritious stuff that he enjoys and then repeat  <br/>
those, it&#39;ll take your mind off the other stuff and I bet that&#39;ll  <br/>
take the pressure off. Of COURSE, don&#39;t present these as substitutes,  <br/>
present them as your own new hobby of cooking/making yummy stuff.<br/>

Peanut butter balls are especially wonderful - here is a really  <br/>
simple and really good recipe. We freeze them, too.<br/>
1 1/4 cup peanut butter (either smooth or crunchy)<br/>
1 1/4 cup dry milk<br/>
3/4 cup honey<br/>
Mix all three ingredients best you can. Then use your hands and mix  <br/>
all the way. Make little one inch balls. Put the balls on waxed  <br/>
paper. Put in fridge for about half hour (or freeze some, too).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-212022582"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I need some help getting my (and DH&#39;s) concerns under control.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yay! What a nice preface to a lot of concern.<br/>
<br/>
Within your very long list of worries the picture you paint is one of you <br/>
working very hard to make sure that he has easy access to the foods you are <br/>
most uncomfortable with him eating and not quite necessarily such easy <br/>
access to other foods. Today Simon went and grabbed candy that was in the <br/>
easiest place for there to be food. I realized, watching him, that I was <br/>
hungry but that there wasn&#39;t anything easy to get at except chips and candy, <br/>
so I got some matzo and buttered and vegemited it and offered some to both <br/>
Simon and Linnaea. I also offered them some new flavor of cranberry juice <br/>
David had gotten from the store. They both were hungry and wanted to be <br/>
catered to. They both took a glass of juice and a matzo. Because I made <br/>
something appealling to them more accesible, or not any effort for them, it <br/>
was a nice option.<br/>
<br/>
Occassionally I feel like their diet isn&#39;t filled with as much diversity as <br/>
usual and that is my cue to step up my efforts to make sure there are lots <br/>
of yummy options easily available. I wasn&#39;t concerned that Simon was having <br/>
candy, I was concerned that he was having candy because anything else was <br/>
more effort than he wanted to put out (even as little effort as asking <br/>
me--often just thinking about what you want to eat to ask for it is more <br/>
effort than he or Linnaea really want to take away from whatever else it is <br/>
they are doing).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could start putting together platters. Offer Wyl and Storm <br/>
platters of food filled with cheese cubes and olives on sticks and maybe <br/>
some cubed fruit and crisps and chocolates, lots of variety. Bring it to <br/>
wherever they are, so they don&#39;t have to make the effort. Don&#39;t worry about <br/>
what gets eaten and what doesn&#39;t. See it as a gift that they get to choose <br/>
what they do with it. About the soda consumption, try making your own. Not <br/>
as an alternative, but as something else to offer. Get some soda water and <br/>
yummy flavors like coconut or banana or caramel or whatever and let Wyl mix <br/>
up what he wants and see what he thinks of that. Or brew some root beer and <br/>
ginger ale. We&#39;ve done it a couple of times, it hasn&#39;t come out right yet, <br/>
but it is fun trying. (if you google soda flavors there are some cool <br/>
sites). You could set up your own soda fountain and get those really cool <br/>
old fashioned soda glasses and make creamed soda and your own cokes and lots <br/>
of different flavored sodas. Oof, that sounds fun, maybe I need to get some <br/>
more flavors. The syrup stuff is also really yummy on shaved ice. Really <br/>
jazz up the whole soda experience!!!<br/>
<br/>
I would also not put a time limit on the stuff in the cupboard. It could set <br/>
up two things, one a sense that he needs to eat everything on his shelf by <br/>
the next time you go to the store so that he can get his allotted amount, <br/>
and two, a sense that you aren&#39;t willing to help him get the things that he <br/>
wants when he wants them, if at all possible. We only have one car, so today <br/>
Simon and Linnaea and I are housebound. However, Linnaea wants some more Dr. <br/>
Pepper. So, rather than tell her she has to wait until tomorrow when we&#39;ll <br/>
have the car, I e-mailed David and asked him to pick up a bottle. I think, <br/>
to some extent, by honoring her desire for Dr. Pepper by getting it for her, <br/>
I&#39;m not making her feel desperate or discounted. It isn&#39;t a rare good, nor <br/>
is it something that is charged with shame or excitement, or a treat. It <br/>
just is a food item. If they wanted eggs to scramble or pears, or whatever <br/>
I&#39;d do the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1113514248">I&#39;m trying really hard to stay out of this discussion because health IS <br/>
my area, and I really don&#39;t think this is the list to get advice from <br/>
about food choices, but this statement that someone made:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Nuts - every sauteed raw almonds with a little butter and cinnamon?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
is inaccurate. If nuts are &quot;sauteed&quot; they are no longer &quot;raw&quot;. It would <br/>
be good to also point out that all almonds are now pasteurized, so <br/>
there really isn&#39;t anything left in them that is nutritious, but then <br/>
you guys think candy is &quot;nutritious,&quot; so I guess there&#39;s no reason to <br/>
point that out to you.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL - okay, first, is it not obvious that I meant that you START with  <br/>
raw almonds. After you saute them a bit, they&#39;re clearly not raw  <br/>
anymore. As opposed to the usual roasted, salted ones that you get in  <br/>
the grocery store that have a lot of oil already.<br/>
<br/>
Plus, &quot;you guys think&quot; is pretty much guaranteed to be wrong - how  <br/>
can you expect your own information to be credible when we can see  <br/>
right up front that you read one person&#39;s post and attribute it to  <br/>
&quot;you guys,&quot; as if everyone here is in agreement?<br/>
<br/>
With two examples of you not appearing to be clear in your own  <br/>
thinking, why should we just take your word for what the outcome of  <br/>
pasteurization is?<br/>
<br/>
So far, by the way, it is still possible to buy unpasteurized raw  <br/>
almonds, they will be less and less available as the new mandate  <br/>
started just this month.<br/>
<br/>
There isn&#39;t good evidence that pasteurization eliminates nutritional  <br/>
value, much less absolutely all nutrition. If nothing else it leaves  <br/>
dietary fiber, which, itself, is something valuable.<br/>

&lt;I  feel that there is an important issue here that<br/>
hasn&#39;t been brought up yet,  and that is of your son&#39;s health. Here in<br/>
Australia the childhood obesity  rate is soaring,&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t realize I had given the impression that Wyl was obese-just the  <br/>
opposite, really. He has just recently stopped looking like he&#39;s &quot;too thin&quot;, as  <br/>
he gets older and fills out. For his first 6 years, we had varying concerns  <br/>
about his thinness.<br/>
 <br/>
To be clear, its not the *sugar* that concerns me. He will learn his  balance <br/>
with that. Keeping him sugar-free certainly isn&#39;t any sort of guarantee  that <br/>
he won&#39;t end up with diabetes-how betrayed would he feel if I justified  <br/>
controlling his food for his &quot;safety&quot; because of diabetes and he ended up with  it <br/>
anyway? Would he think I was trustworthy then?<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t post here to this group for &quot;help&quot; finding ways to control, I  <br/>
wanted help finding ways to help adjust my thinking so I could *relax* the  control <br/>
I now feel I need. Sort of feel I need.... maybe know I don&#39;t really  *need* <br/>
it, but am needing help in finding my way out of control. Control seems  to <br/>
not only control the controllee, but also the controller!<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-330428399">Since Sandra is adamant about saying exactly what you mean, I thought <br/>
it was appropriate to clarify what you said about raw almonds. You <br/>
implied (by adding &quot;raw&quot; to &quot;almonds&quot;) that this was something of <br/>
importance, but indeed the result of what you suggested is NOT raw, <br/>
so it was very ambiguous. Why would it be important to use &quot;raw&quot; <br/>
almonds in your recipe if you were just going to sautee them anyway? <br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to take my word for anything (since I&#39;m apparently, <br/>
according to you, too &quot;inconsistent&quot; to trust). All you have to do is <br/>
a little research about almonds and pasteurization. It&#39;s easy to <br/>
verify what I have posted. Very easy.<br/>

&lt;Maybe just consider adding more options - put more things on his  <br/>
&quot;shelf&quot;-- like really amazingly wonderful homemade goodies that have  <br/>
more nutrition. Just thinking it might help you and your dh relax <br/>
more  and maybe he&#39;ll develop a taste for yummy and more healthy <br/>
stuff.  &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! Reading some of the things here folks have posted about &quot;more  <br/>
nutritious options&quot; has made me realize my focus was off. Really off. Both boys  <br/>
like nutritious foods; broccoli, whole wheat bread (they will often chose it  <br/>
over the white bread and I end up tossing most of the loaf!), whole wheat pasta,  <br/>
milk and cheeses, peanut butter, cashews, brussels sprouts, asparagus, raw  <br/>
fruits and veggies of all kinds... The upswing in candy consumption just stuck  <br/>
out in my mind like a sore thumb, but all the conversation here has helped  <br/>
me re-focus and look *beyond* the candy and pop and see that they really do <br/>
have  a good *base*. Wyl just wanders away for a while, but he always dabbles and <br/>
so  far has always returned to the nutritious &quot;base&quot;. <br/>
 <br/>
Whew.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

A bit of chemicals while joyfully enjoying some fresh roasted sweet almonds<br/>
with happy and free kids -OR- fear of chemicals and a mama who controls food<br/>
choices to avoid what *could* hurt later??<br/>
<br/>
Having lost a child at 9.5 (nope, not due to chemicals in her food!) I&#39;d say<br/>
that everyday we lived in Trust & Love, without fear were days I&#39;ll hold in<br/>
my heart without ANY regret. Thankfully the times I said NO out of fear were<br/>
few and far between and we all learned from those experiences and I&#39;m not in<br/>
any way trapped there.<br/>
<br/>
My main goal for supporting Hayden and his food choices/autonomy is to have<br/>
an amazing *relationship* with him that leads directly to his having a great<br/>
relationship with himself and his environment. He counts on me to be honest<br/>
with information and honest with my opinion and honest in my trust in him.<br/>
*This* is the component I see missing from the morbidly obese folks in my<br/>
own family - food is more comforting than mama; not at my house!<br/>
