<div id="ygrps-yiv-42649702">I just got this quote attached to a weekly newsletter.  I am not sure which bit rankles the most.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Teachers who educate children deserve more honor than parents who merely gave birth; for bare life is furnished by the one, the other ensures a good life.&quot;<br/>
~ Aristotle ~<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t find that, but found a different translation, and note a telling <br/>
difference:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those who educate children well are more to be honored than they who produce <br/>
them; for these only gave them life, those the art of living well.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL! I was going to look up the Greek because (a) I didn&#39;t think he&#39;d used<br/>
the word &quot;teacher&quot; and (b) the translation didn&#39;t sound like the Aristotle<br/>
that I had read/translated when I was in college (I still have all of my<br/>
books up in the attic!)  Thanks for finding this alternative translation.<br/>
