<div id="ygrps-yiv-1806630695">I smoked pot, smoked crank and crack (not nearly as often as pot) and <br/>
drank.  I can&#39;t say wether or not thier is any evidence that smoking <br/>
pot effects your short term memory because I havne&#39;t researched it <br/>
myself.  What I do know is that when you smoke pot your brain <br/>
releases lots of seritonin (?).  What you see becomes amplified, what <br/>
hear is amplified, what you taste is amplified.  You have major <br/>
stimulation going on and the result is you start to block certain <br/>
stuff out. It&#39;s like your brain can&#39;t take all the pleasure and <br/>
intensity of everything.  When you sober up it takes a while for your <br/>
brain to stop doing this.  I don&#39;t hear names.  People will introduce <br/>
themselves to me and I can almost gaurantee I will not remember it.  <br/>
It&#39;s something I don&#39;t absorb into my brain.  When I was high, <br/>
looking at  green lushes trees blowing in the warm wind would amaze <br/>
me.  The colors and sounds felt like they were running through me and <br/>
I was apart of the *energy* the tree was giving.  Now when I look at <br/>
a tree I barely even notice it because I am sober and it isn&#39;t as <br/>
intense as when I was high.  This leads me to not notice what I see, <br/>
hear, taste and etc.  Maybe saying that I forget stuff is wrong.  <br/>
Maybe what I should say is that I don&#39;t notice my environment like I <br/>
should or like I did before I had my 4 years of drug abuse.  It would <br/>
be like going from Breyers Ice cream to a popsicle.  Know what I mean?<br/>

____________<br/>
 <br/>
This has come up in our family lately.  I am hyper aware of my  inanimate <br/>
surroundings--the way a candle is placed on the table, a piece of fuzz  on the <br/>
floor, the way the waves look as we drive across the river.  My  husband, on the <br/>
other hand notices what people are wearing and always remembers  their name.  <br/>
He&#39;ll say things like, &quot;Do you remember that women with the  pale blue shirt <br/>
with a stripe on the pocket standing by the pool?&quot;  I  struggle with names but <br/>
often remember a story a person has told in  conversation.  He has few <br/>
childhood memories while I seem to remember the  past in often painful detail. <br/>
 <br/>
.  My 15 year old daughter remembers what she ate after most  significant <br/>
events in her life.  She will say things like, &quot; I got  that scar on my toe when <br/>
it got caught under the door when I was 3.  I ate  macaroni and cheese out of <br/>
that red plastic bowl that night.&quot; Always the event  is associated with food.  <br/>
Very weird!<br/>
 <br/>
  I find it all fascinating and sometimes  frustrating.  I often think I <br/>
don&#39;t remember names because I&#39;m  not comfortable meeting new people and just am <br/>
trying to be composed and not say  anything inane. He is very comfortable in <br/>
social settings so he is able to  concentrate on their names and clothes.  I&#39;m <br/>
better noticing things  when no people are involved.<br/>

I just read in the current issue of Prevention that rats fed trans-fats (like partially hydrogenated soybean oil found in common snack foods) get stupider and perform more poorly on maze tests.  I&#39;ve indulged far more in snacks than in drugs over my lifetime, so maybe that&#39;s what happened to my brain.<br/>

I used drugs AND ate Fritos and donuts, but I can still remember who I did  <br/>
all with, and can remember some of their phone numbers even. &lt;g&gt;   Okay, their <br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I too do not notice<br/>
things.  I never notice my environment, which leads to getting lost all<br/>
the time.  I never notice what people look like, or what they&#39;re<br/>
wearing. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Most moms over 40 I know have these issues whether they did drugs or<br/>
not.  I <br/>
think it has to do with scattered attention rather than drug-induced<br/>
brain <br/>
trauma.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>People of any age who find themselves lost, seem to be wandering in a fog,<br/>
maybe have put on some extra weight or notice their hair is kind of dry<br/>
might want to ask their doctor for a thyroid function test.  Same goes for<br/>
those who feel agitated all the time, have trouble sleeping, have lost<br/>
weight or think their heart is racing.<br/>

in the last 5 months.<br/>
