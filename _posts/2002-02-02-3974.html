<div id="ygrps-yiv-798799775">Kathryn, may I ask what it is that troubles you about PETA ?    Do you<br/>
and Julian ever talk about that?  Kids who become vegetarians are often<br/>
very passionate in the beginning.   I quit eating meat when I was ten,<br/>
and really felt like I wanted to convert everyone.   Kind of like new<br/>
Christians, or new unschoolers.&lt;g&gt;   My son is a vegetarian now, but he<br/>
may change his mind later.   We talk about things that trouble him all<br/>
the time.  He gets two perspectives as my husband still eats meat<br/>
occasionally and eats cheese and eggs, etc.  <br/>
We have many troubling animal rights issues here in MT.  Yellowstone<br/>
Bison being only one.   <br/>
I remember your story about all the little critters that live in Julian&#39;s<br/>
hair and (I love that!) he sounds like a very sensitive kid.  <br/>
Just curious.<br/>

terrified of the then burgeoning  Lesbian groups in the 70&#39;s, but has, over <br/>
time, learned from, and GOTTEN it. I doubt there&#39;s a rights movement that <br/>
hasn&#39;t had a radical fringe that the mainstream has learned from. <br/>
<br/>
And every day I find myself being more THERE on unschooling, etc. Which, of <br/>
course, is why that other list is bugging me so much! LOL<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The main thing that exhausts me about PETA is that often their public <br/>
statements seem politically naive, and I think the message gets watered down. <br/>
Example: When, I think, Timothy McVeigh was being executed, they sent out <br/>
press releases suggesting that his Last Meal be a vegan one, so that he <br/>
couldn&#39;t be responsible for any more deaths. Now, I am anti-death penalty, <br/>
and I can see where they&#39;re coming from -- And that statement made them sound <br/>
silly even to people inclined to be on their side. There seem to be a lot of <br/>
instances like that. I remember someone saying once: Communicate in a way <br/>
that wins support. PETA rarely does that.<br/>
<br/>
Julian and I HAVE talked about PETA, and he&#39;s gotten a lot out of the kid&#39;s <br/>
stuff. He&#39;s joined other organizations that support animal rights, and <br/>
donated money. So far he has chosen not to with PETA.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure Julian is a lifer on the vegetarian front, and I wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
surprised if he decides to be a vegan at some point. He decided a few years <br/>
ago he wouldn&#39;t use leather, which makes buying shoes (someday I&#39;ll share the <br/>
tap shoe saga) a pain in the butt. But he&#39;s also pretty polite to me, the <br/>
Family Carnivore. <br/>
<br/>
The critters still live in his head. Recently a vampire bat moved in, who is <br/>
not so pleasant. <br/>
<br/>
Julian IS a VERY cool person though.<br/>
