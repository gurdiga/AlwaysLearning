<div id="ygrps-yiv-420976129">My DD did the same. We were on an out of state trip. The entire ride <br/>
home, she insisted that we needed to get home as fast as possible so <br/>
she could take training wheels off her bike. She &quot;Knew&quot; that she&#39;d be <br/>
able to ride it. Shw was right of course. Amazing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1032055669">Maybe you should take your mom aside and tell her that you have some <br/>
long-term goals for your girls.  That your methods might not look <br/>
like what she&#39;s used to but that it&#39;s all part of your plan.  Let her <br/>
know that when she does what she&#39;s doing that it causes your plan to <br/>
backslide and then tell her what she can do INSTEAD.  And then <br/>
reassure her by saying that you KNOW lots of unschoolers with older <br/>
children and you hear from EVERY single one (whether you do or not ;-<br/>
)) that unschooled children turn out in the long run to be MORE <br/>
helpful than their peers, MORE gracious and polite and giving...etc.  <br/>
Heap it on, because that&#39;s what her interfering is really about; her <br/>
GOOD desire for the children to develop good character.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  A little of both. I couldnt find a babysitter for Nate and Courtney. Its really hard to find people willing to watch my autistic child. I couldnt take them to surgery with me and dh has had to take so much time off work because of Nate&#39;s numerous dr visits, er visits etc lately and really couldnt take anymore time off. So having someone to watch him during Alyssa&#39;s surgery is a big help. <br/>
   <br/>
  I tried to talk to her . I was trying to choose my words carefully but be honest with her. I told her it seemed like my kids esp Nate stressed her out and I need her to b honest with me aout it. This upset her and she took it like i didnt want to come on and started going on about how she WAS going to come see her grandchildren. I never once said she couldnt or shouldnt come I simply wanted to know if babysitting them was to much for her. <br/>
   <br/>
  Then she told me that all the stuff that Nate was picking up and throwing and all the stuff he was picking up and throwing him out could b prevented and I needed to be more strict with him. So I asked hr what this lookd like and she basicly said following him around and telling him no or swatting him. I told her a long time ago out of desperation I tried this for over a month , There was no improvement in his behavior and I was hitting my child and needed to be put in jail. I also explained that the girls already loose a lot of attention from be because Im caring for Nate and that I choose to tolerate a house far messier than Id like in order to try to make my children feel wanted and loved instead of pushed aside all the time. She didnt have much to say to this. <br/>
   <br/>
  Then i asked her if she would please, instead of jumping my children about things come and talk to me if it bothered her. I didnt promise to remedy the situation to her liking but perhaps she at least hae an understanding of why Im doing what Im doing. She got upset about supposedly not allowing her to have an opinion. I said no but there was no need to get all upset at a little girl who is 9 tomorrow because she made a choice you dont like.. This basicly ended with her telling me that I shouldnt ruin their lives because they were the ones that were going to have to live with it. <br/>
   <br/>
  I just dont know how to talk to her. <br/>
