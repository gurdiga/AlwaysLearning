<br/>
If you are a HP fan, some of us are meeting at the Barnes and Noble in <br/>
Huntington Beach, which is on Beach right off the 405 freeway.  Tonight,<br/>
<br/>
till a bit after midnight.  Look for the blue haired child.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ah I didn&#39;t get this til today (Saturday)  We did go to the one on PCH<br/>
in Long Beach though.  Got there around 9:30, did the HP stuff, browsed,<br/>
hung out... You know.  Pretty cool.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310980175">We strolled into our local Wal-mart around 2 pm today.  No <br/>
standing/waiting in line.  No costumes.  There was a cart of HP books <br/>
parked near the entrance.  We picked one up and headed on our way. It <br/>
was $16.17.   We did watch the HP parties on the News last night.  It <br/>
was weird, most of the kids at the parties looked under 6.. uhmm, not <br/>
really old enough to read Harry Potter, not for content, but for <br/>
reading ability.   Maybe thier parents read it to them.  My anxious <br/>
HP readers are 16 and 13.. I have an 11 yo who has read the first book<br/>

<br/>
Maybe the littlest ones made more of a visual impact on TV.<br/>
<br/>
The party at the B&N we went to had kids of all ages. Even the older ones<br/>
and some adults were dressed up.<br/>

dressed up. I kind of wished I could gather all the teens together <br/>
somehow and introduce them to each other - seemed like they might be <br/>
kindred spirits.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1669952102">We are definitely addicted here.  We&#39;ve been through the first four books individually and then together and then together again on audio.  Jim Dale may very well be my hero.  I am reading this one aloud to my kids.  My littlest guy is the only one not interested.  My 10 and 8 year olds girls have read the first four twice and listened to the audio and to me read them aloud.  My 6 year old hasn&#39;t read them independently yet.<br/>

another copy &lt;G&gt; and I went out searching. Started at Walmart - no <br/>
luck. Tried FIVE different bookstores - no luck. Gave up.<br/>
<br/>
Today I stumbled across a big stack of them at a bargain book sale. <br/>
They were $2 MORE than at the regular bookstores &lt;G&gt;.<br/>

awesome cape and he made his wand.   The teens that get into HP ARE <br/>
kindred spirits.   My son is involved in several online groups and <br/>

did do that with HP 1-4.  This time, the 15 y.o. bought her own copy, while<br/>
ds reads the family copy.  They are reading at the same time, so neither<br/>
gets ahead of the other.  Dh *tried* to take a candid photo of the two of<br/>
them lying on ds&#39;s bed, one at the head, one at the foot, totally absorbed<br/>
in reading, but they wouldn&#39;t allow it :-)  I get to read when they are<br/>
doing something else, but have been firmly warned not to read ahead of them;<br/>
I caught up when they were both sleeping late yesterday morning!  Hmmm,<br/>
they&#39;re still sleeping now......<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably having it read aloud to them!<br/>
<br/>
But don&#39;t underestimate some kids&#39; reading ability.  <br/>
Brenda&#39;s Tim (they&#39;re off in Greece and Turkey I think) can read like crazy!<br/>
Pam Sorooshian&#39;s Rosie could when she was little too.<br/>
My friend Cathyn could&#39;ve read it when he was &quot;too little to read.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone I&#39;ve known since she was little named her puppies Sam and Pippin in <br/>
1972.  She was eight or nine.  I asked her if her dad had read her The Lord of <br/>
the Rings.  She said &quot;I&#39;ve read all the books twice, myself.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ooops. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, her name came up last month.  Kirby went to the prom with the <br/>
stepdaughter of her cousin; we stayed at their house.  We were talking about <br/>
now knowing how to prounce words we had only seen in print, and our hostess <br/>
said her cousin had always had &quot;severe reader&#39;s vocabulary.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good question. I didn&#39;t even KNOW she was learning to read. She has an <br/>
older sister - 3 years older. They shared a bedroom. Turns out that <br/>
every night they were laying around in their beds and roxana was <br/>
pestering her sister with: &quot;What does this say?&quot; &quot;What does this say?&quot; <br/>
Somehow she asked enough questions to learn to read - and then just <br/>
exploded with it - learned really really fast. First I heard of it, she <br/>
was already reading very very fluently.<br/>
<br/>
We live in what you might call a &quot;print-rich environment.&quot; (Books to <br/>
the ceiling, books to the sky. My pile of books is a mile high. How I <br/>
love them. How I need them. I&#39;ll be an old lady by the time I read <br/>
them. --- from Whiskers and Rhymes, approximately - from memory so <br/>
might be slightly off)<br/>
