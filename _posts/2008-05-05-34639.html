<br/>
There is a wonderful mythical law of nature that the three things we  <br/>
crave<br/>
most in life -- happiness, freedom, and peace of mind -- are always<br/>
attained by giving them to someone else. -General Peyton C. March  <br/>
(1864-1955)<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a link won&#39;t light up (be active) because of the line  <br/>
wrapping around or something.<br/>
<br/>
In such cases, cut and paste the whole thing into the finder.<br/>

<br/>
It wrapped, the first time, and there were spaces inserted where  <br/>
there shouldn&#39;t have been.  I cut and pasted it, so I don&#39;t know how  <br/>
the spaces got there, but maybe this one will work, and if not, try  <br/>
the bare blog and go to 5/5 if it&#39;s not still at the top.<br/>
