<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010092003">HI all -<br/>
I&#39;m Jane in Maryland... haven&#39;t been on this list in a long long <br/>
while but I hope you&#39;ll address my question with your creative <br/>
thinking!<br/>
<br/>
My 13yo daughter wants to earn a Biology &#39;credit&#39; for high school <br/>
which means 120 hours of &#39;biology&#39;....<br/>
<br/>
What are some interesting ways that she could do that?  <br/>
<br/>
Any recommended books (anyone know &#39;Instant Biology&#39; or &#39;Cartoon <br/>
Guide to Genetics&#39;?, movies, programs, kits, other activities would <br/>
be greatly appreciated....  Where we are &#39;lacking&#39; (if there is such <br/>
a thing) is in the area of microscopic stuff....  She&#39;s a &#39;self <br/>
teacher&#39; so she prefers to have stuff to do on her own and then be <br/>
able to ask me questions as she needs to.... <br/>
<br/>
Her horse is about to have a baby in a few months so that&#39;ll be a lot <br/>
of it.  We have animals and, if she had the time between her horse, <br/>
working to pay for the horse, karate, swimteam, friends, guitar, <br/>
friends, skiing, and watching football (altho that&#39;s almost over :), <br/>
she&#39;d volunteer at the animal shelter.   Then there&#39;s the dvds at <br/>
Netflix.....any specific titles you recommend?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time and your responses!  And, if there is something <br/>
here that suggests that there&#39;s another view I could use, I&#39;d <br/>
appreciate hearing that, too....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-784149461">Asking, on an unschooling list, how to get a high school &quot;credit&quot; is a  <br/>
little weird - so it might have helped to explain why she needs or  <br/>
wants it.<br/>
<br/>
If, on the other hand, you&#39;d said she&#39;s interested in biology and  <br/>
wants to learn more about what it typically includes, we could make  <br/>
some suggestions.<br/>
You seem to have a lot of options already, though, for some great  <br/>
natural learning opportunities. If you are looking for something that  <br/>
covers more conventional biology topics, you might get the Standard  <br/>
Deviants Biology DVDs - you can order them online and I&#39;ve even seen  <br/>
them at bookstores. Very traditional material presented in a  <br/>
slapstick, low-humor way. The content is what is typically included in  <br/>
an introductory college-level course.<br/>
<br/>
I like the Cartoon Guides, myself. Again, they are just standard  <br/>
content in a comic strip format - just a little irreverent, enough to  <br/>
giggle at once in a while.<br/>

Pam, thank you very much for your ideas!  I&#39;ll pass them along to <br/>
her....<br/>
<br/>
I asked her again why she wants the &#39;credit&#39;.... she says she is <br/>
interested in animal rehab therapy and will need biology for that so <br/>
she wants to start now and wants to have the &#39;documented credit&#39; <br/>
believing that that will make things easier later when she goes to <br/>
take formal classes in her field....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
What are some interesting ways that she could do that?-=-<br/>
<br/>
This part wasn&#39;t addressed much.<br/>
Do you mean to ask how you can justify &quot;giving her credit&quot; as a homeschooling mom?  Or <br/>
does she want &quot;real&quot; credit (from a correspondence school or something)?<br/>
<br/>
With school, the goal is grades and credits and certificates, so it is possible to cheat.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, the goal is learning, and there is no way to cheat.  Learning is learning.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could sign up for an online biology class, and do it together, not for credit (or <br/>
without regard to whether she does it alone or you do it alone, or what &quot;grade&quot; you get.  You <br/>
could learn together and one thing she will learn is that counting hours and &quot;getting credit&quot; <br/>
isn&#39;t as cool as learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279126979">My  13yo daughter wants to earn a Biology &#39;credit&#39; for high school<br/>
which means  120 hours of &#39;biology&#39;...w<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
___<br/>
 <br/>
We didn&#39;t pay much attention to &quot;credits&quot; the past few years  unschooling.  <br/>
However, when Brenna decided to apply to some colleges  we needed to make a <br/>
transcript so that she might qualify for some  Florida scholarships especially <br/>
one that could pay 100% of her  tuition if she goes in state. <br/>
 <br/>
She needed three sciences and two of those with labs.  Florida has a  website <br/>
where you can research the accepted high school classes and we  looked <br/>
through them and found several that she could use just from some of her  interests <br/>
the past few years.  <br/>
 <br/>
She built a compost system for our family and planted an organic garden  last <br/>
year.  She spent way more than 120 hours buying seeds,  building raised beds <br/>
from wood, and then working on her composting and  garden through the spring <br/>
and summer.   She learned way more  than the objectives listed for the subject <br/>
&quot;Environmental Science with  Lab&quot; so it was very easy to count that as a <br/>
credit.  The cool thing was  that she didn&#39;t do it to earn a credit.  It was all <br/>
because she thought it  would be fun.  She loved every little plant that <br/>
sprouted and we now have a  little garden area and compost system....and she in a <br/>
roundabout way it paid for  itself and way more if she decides to use that <br/>
scholarship money.  The  value of it was in the learning for her and our entire <br/>
family as well as  the enjoyment of eating the food she had grown.  <br/>
 <br/>
 We found that we could do this for many things.  We included  some narrative <br/>
descriptions as well as a letter of our unschooling learning  approach.  It <br/>
took some time and creativity but it was well worth it.<br/>
 <br/>
She&#39;s been accepted at her two top college choices plus received the  full <br/>
tuition scholarship as well as some others.<br/>
 <br/>
If your daughter wants to explore Biology,  I&#39;d recommend  watching some <br/>
DVD&#39;s or just looking at the areas that Biology  encompasses and see if some of it <br/>
does interest her.  Branch out from  there and something might just be a <br/>
spark that leads to other things.  120  hours is not much if she finds something <br/>
she enjoys and loves learning  about .  Don&#39;t obsess about the hours  So many <br/>
things to explore and  learn about under the very broad topic of Biology.<br/>
