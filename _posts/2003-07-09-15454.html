<div id="ygrps-yiv-417405848">We just got a new puppy today.  The puppy is so cute and on the way home my <br/>
youngest, Phillip, said something so cute.  The boys were sitting in the back <br/>
seat with the puppy on their laps.  The puppy fell asleep and Phillip pipes <br/>
up.....&quot;Mom...we loved the puppy to sleep.&quot;<br/>
I thought that was so cute, had to share.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343266201">And this is exactly how babies and puppies should go to sleep--loved to <br/>
sleep, what a great saying.  I think I&#39;ll steal it if Phillip doesn&#39;t mind.<br/>
