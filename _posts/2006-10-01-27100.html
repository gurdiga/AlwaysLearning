<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402527743">Hi All~<br/>
<br/>
We have been unschooling for the past couple of years. This morning I <br/>
mention this gal who has created her own college and in doing <br/>
uncollege. This is what he says &quot;like thats gonna get you a good job&quot; <br/>
So it goes...THEN...he says &quot;like there has been alot of unschooling <br/>
going on around here lately, playing computer games all day long, like <br/>
thats really unschooling&quot; At that point I&#39;m getting kind of pissed, <br/>
because I am thinking we have had like a million conversations about <br/>
this, I can&#39;t believe we have to go there again. My guestion is...how <br/>
would you respond, my kids do lots of things other than games...but <br/>
they love their games...and I believe there is plenty of value in them.<br/>
Thanks for any insight...Tracy</div>

I wouldn&#39;t argue with him.  Maybe show him some of the bits on the  <br/>
teen page, or maybe tell him college is changing.<br/>
<br/>
But honestly, &quot;uncollege&quot; is nonsense.   She can be learning on her  <br/>
own, but to call it anything related to college doesn&#39;t make sense as  <br/>
college pre-dates public school by hundreds of years, and it&#39;s never  <br/>
been compulsory.<br/>
<br/>
What unschoolers do is an alternative to compulsory schooling.<br/>
What adults do is learn, or not.<br/>

I would keep talking with him about it.  When we first started unschooling I printed out little bits of conversations that would address my husbands concerns.  Ones that really went &quot;ah ha!&quot; to me too.  He&#39;s obviously missing some pretty important points about unschooling if he doesn&#39;t see that playing games is unschooling, which you&#39;re seeing.  <br/>
<br/>
What about Pam L.&#39;s article about gaming:<br/>

<br/>
That touches on a lot of other unschooling points too, not just gaming.  When we were starting,  I printed out a lot of these types of articles.  I&#39;d leave them around and make some comment like, &quot; Wow, these are really interesting.  They make a lot of sense to me.&quot;<br/>

I left the most important readings in the bathroom in reach of the toilet.<br/>
Those were always read.<br/>
<br/>
I also forward posts to him that particularly touch on any issues we may be<br/>
having. Since he reads all his emails, I know he&#39;s read it and most times it<br/>
makes a difference. He pretty unconditionally supports unschooling now.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018655586">Thanks Kelli~<br/>
<br/>
We have the CD version of the video gaming talk...love it! I printed <br/>
it from the link you gave, sometimes it&#39;s helpful to read something, <br/>
instead of listen...so thanks. I don&#39;t know if he will take the time <br/>
to download the Dad panel, but great suggestion!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra~ Luckily I did&#39;nt argue with him, and thanks for your point <br/>
about college being around alot longer than compulsory schooling. <br/>
<br/>
We are all a work in progress, but because I am the one always <br/>
connected to the kids and he works/plays alot he gets disconnected. <br/>
Staying connected to them is how I know they are learning and happy <br/>
and thats all I need to know! Thanks for the replies...it helped me <br/>
calm down! Tracy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993532404">Tracy, I have a few responses to this. Some of them, or parts of them are <br/>
more useful to building relationships than others...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just stop right now! I&#39;m feeling really good about the decision to <br/>
homeschool our children. Perhaps if you are concerned you might consider <br/>
reading some of the literature on the subject. Maybe you want to talk with <br/>
other homeschooling parents (on-line or whatever). The children and I really <br/>
appreciate you being a supporter in this journey, even being a partner. It <br/>
is painful to hear your criticisms, espcially since they are in the face of <br/>
the previous conversations we&#39;ve had. Please create and emit some positive <br/>
energy on this important subject.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lil, sharing and caring<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an interesting perspective.  I always took &#39;un&#39; just to <br/>
mean &#39;not&#39; or &#39;opposite of&#39; and I see a whole litany of things <br/>
that &#39;school&#39; does in addition to the mandatory part.<br/>
<br/>
In another thought, many people do seem to assume that college is <br/>
mandatory and some professions require degrees.  If you find an <br/>
alternate way to achieve that is it uncollege then?<br/>
<br/>
I have also seen &#39;unjobbing&#39; which also makes sense to me.  The <br/>
control is there, even though people can &#39;technically&#39; leave at any <br/>
point.  Here&#39;s some of the stuff I was already familiar with unjobbing:<br/>

And the relationship to unschooling is just the next steps in life. :)<br/>

<br/>
No, then it&#39;s finding an alternative way to achieve a goal.<br/>
<br/>
Why call it something irritating and nonsensical?<br/>
<br/>
Home schooling gets kids through the compulsory education years.<br/>
Unschooling is a form of homeschooling.<br/>
After compulsory education, there&#39;s no reason for designations.<br/>

What control?<br/>
<br/>
People can leave any job at any point.<br/>

Absolutely.<br/>
Playing with words where there aren&#39;t clear terms already in place  <br/>
can be fun and sometimes useful.  But making up sub-group terminology  <br/>
for things English already names is jargon.  Jargon is often for the  <br/>
purpose of making outsiders feel like outsiders.  Let&#39;s try not to do  <br/>
that.  Our kids can&#39;t be living in the world if we create a world  <br/>
apart, with terminology only we &quot;get.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Already we have the difference between deschooling and unschooling,  <br/>
which baffles others.  That seems to be lots.<br/>
