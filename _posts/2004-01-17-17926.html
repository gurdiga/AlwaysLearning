<h4>Jennifer and Scott Lynch at 2004-01-17 04:06:08 +0200 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713983938">Hi all!  I am new to this list but after reading for a week or so I feel<br/>
like I have found my long-lost family!!!  Finally a group with whom I don&#39;t<br/>
have to explain EVERYTHING!!!  My name is Jen, my husband is Scott and we<br/>
have a dd who is three and three quarters (she ALWAYS adds the<br/>
&quot;three-quarters&quot;  part.)  My husband works our of our house, I do not work<br/>
for pay.  I always knew I would unschool although I had a very positive,<br/>
very alternative (radical Montessori) school experience myself.  I won&#39;t get<br/>
into our life details here, I hope to get to know all of you better in the<br/>
future.  My questions are as follows:<br/>
<br/>
1) Evie will be our only child.  I am interested in hearing from others who<br/>
have only children (I am an &quot;only&quot; myself.)<br/>
<br/>
2)  I am interested in hearing about the things you all do with your young<br/>
kids.  I am especially interested in hearing about situations when your kids<br/>
are clamoring to learn something specific and yet tend to lose interest if<br/>
they are explicitly &quot;taught&quot; one way.<br/>
<br/>
3) What does &quot;strewing&quot; look like in your house with young kids?<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I have been dying to share the following anecdote with a group who<br/>
would appreciate it.  My daughter was jumping on our bed with her closest<br/>
neighborhood friend.  This friend is in daycare all week and has an older<br/>
sister who is in &quot;away school&quot; as Evie calls it (as opposed to<br/>
&quot;homeschool&quot;).  Evie loves to count and so she was counting their jumps.<br/>
She was up to about 124 (I don&#39;t really know how or when she learned to<br/>
count that high) when her friend asked &quot;how do keep all those numbers in the<br/>
right order?&quot;  I was downstairs, I couldn&#39;t wait to hear Evie&#39;s answer.  She<br/>
stopped jumping, thought for a minute and then said, &quot;You just let them leak<br/>
out of your head!&quot;  She then resumed jumping as if that were a perfectly<br/>
logical explanation.  I smiled and thought &quot;you got it kid!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to learn and share more with all of you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007941518">Hi Jen,<br/>
<br/>
I am an only and I have an only, he is older though, 14.  He likes me to <br/>
learn things with him, which I don&#39;t mind.  We have some great groups where we <br/>
are, too, and he has friends that go to school that he sees on weekends.<br/>
<br/>
I strew (strow?) a lot, probably too much.  I love books and fortunately he <br/>
loves books as well. <br/>
<br/>
Great to have you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1090305984">I have to second Jen from WI, I too feel very &quot;at home&quot; here.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
lurking for a few days since I joined the group and boy have I come to feel<br/>
better about the TV and consumerism around this place.<br/>
<br/>
I have three boys, all under five, and I feel sometimes I just let them have<br/>
whatever it is they&#39;re asking for, cartoons, ridiculously shaped and colored<br/>
macaroni, or even, God forbid, candy-to keep the peace.  Following that<br/>
thread rescued from certain doom I&#39;m sure!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;d love some great children&#39;s book recommendations.  My four year<br/>
old loves to read and be read to, but we are having a hard time coming up<br/>
with new &quot;now that was a GREAT book&quot; books.  I&#39;ve read everything Chinaberry<br/>
sells and asked the children&#39;s librarian locally for help.  I was given the<br/>
Newberry and Caldecott winners list, but sadly they are far from a great<br/>
recommended read list.  ANY suggestions are welcome and thank you in<br/>
advance.<br/>

I have a few books recommendations.  My daughter is almost four.  I HATE<br/>
that so many books for kids are really thinly disguised how-to manuals about<br/>
how to act in school.  I have resorted to mostly books from the 30s and 40s,<br/>
1939 seems to have been a particularly good year!<br/>
<br/>
The Enchanted Wood series by Enid Blyton (actually almost anything by Enid<br/>
Blyton, the whole family is riveted by these)<br/>
Twig by Elizabeth Orton Jones<br/>
The Flicka, Ricka, Dicka and Snipp, Snap and Snurr books by Maj Lindman<br/>
Pippi Longstocking<br/>
The Little House Books<br/>
The Oz books<br/>
Beatrix Potter<br/>
The Tarzan Books (not great for wee ones, at least not mine)<br/>
<br/>
Just a few suggestions, good luck.  I am personally craving a good story to<br/>
read to my daughter, these days it is ALL non-fiction, mostly dinosaurs.  I<br/>
am almost ready to claim that my tongue can&#39;t say &quot;protoceratops&quot; one more<br/>
time or it might fall out!!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-57930473">For book suggestions I really like Jim Trelease&#39;s The Read Aloud<br/>
Handbook...great info on reading to kids etc and a wonderful collection<br/>
of titles and little bits of info on bunches of books for all ages.<br/>
<br/>
One book that my older son really enjoyed around 4 was My Father&#39;s<br/>
Dragon (actually is a series of 3 books that were fun). Let&#39;s see...the<br/>
Wizard of Oz series (did you know that here are over 10 books!) really<br/>
hit his funny bone...they have all sorts of neat, funny characters,<br/>
Jason would just die laughing. I think that we did Little House around 4<br/>
or maybe closer to 5. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone have any suggestions for a 7 yo? We just finished the Redwall<br/>
series (and we both absolutely loved it). Right now we are reading<br/>
Calvin and Hobbes. I was thinking about starting King Arthur stories...<br/>
anyone recommend a particular author? Any other good books? <br/>

really liked it. We also liked his version of Robin Hood &quot;Robin of Sherwood.&quot; <br/>
Here is a short snip from an interview with Michael;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;What are the three most important tips you can give to young writers?<br/>
1. Drink in the world around you.<br/>
2. Dream your dream until it becomes so involving you can’t stop dreaming it.<br/>
3. Tell it from the heart, as you feel your story, as you see it.&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about a fiction about dinosaurs?  There&#39;s &quot;The Enormous Egg,&quot; which I<br/>
loved as a kid and passed on to my two.  And there&#39;s my 13 y.o. son&#39;s<br/>
favorite book, &quot;Raptor Red,&quot; by paleontologist Robert Bakker, a novel<br/>
written in present tense about the life of a female Utahraptor.  I&#39;m unclear<br/>
from your post just what you were replying to, and what was your reply; is<br/>
your child four, or the original poster&#39;s?  &quot;Enormous Egg&quot; could be read<br/>
aloud to a young child, but &quot;Raptor Red&quot; is older child/teen material (it&#39;s<br/>
pretty realistic, and raptors are, well, raptors...)<br/>
<br/>
BTW, don&#39;t knock dino books -- the above 13 y.o. boy taught himself to read<br/>
with Eyewitness Dinosaur at around age 4.  He had no interest in phonics,<br/>
but sounded out multisyllabic dinosaur names with ease &lt;g&gt;  I was all set to<br/>
use some reading program or other, but the kid beat me to it!<br/>
