<div id="ygrps-yiv-858980334">&quot;We pulled up big radishes today and picked the first peas from our<br/>
little garden.  I have too many zucchini and will have to sneak around<br/>
the neighborhood tonight in my jammies leaving unwanted squashes on the<br/>
neighbor&#39;s door steps. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Man, I want to be your neighbor!! For more than the squash of course...:) Wah.<br/>
I loved reading about all of your gardens. Inspirational!<br/>
We have a few little raised beds that I built earlier this year. So far the beans have not produced anything edible, but they&#39;ve climbed all over and look really cool. I think our lousy weather this summer kept them from getting pollinated.<br/>
We do have a few little watermelons though, something I&#39;ve never grown before! The kids excitedly check their little beds every so often and then have to bring Daddy to see the progress. What fun! We even have a couple of eggplants growing, no eggplant yet though.<br/>
It&#39;s rained every single day for so long I can&#39;t remember...poor tourists are getting gyped. It&#39;s sunny most of the day, but we get a good downpour almost daily this year.<br/>
I&#39;m afraid the watermelons will crack if this keeps up!<br/>
