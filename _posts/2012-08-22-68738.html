The building behind my family in that first photo is *not* my house. :-)  We visited Jihong in Texas a while back.    But that is my family.  Keith, Holly, Kirby, me and Marty.  And Jill Parmer took the photo (or one of her kids did, but I think Jill did).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307782934">Great interview and what a nice collection of pictures..<br/>
Also especially loved the Navaratri bit :)..<br/>
This year Veda is 3 and I have already bought a set of mud dolls for her<br/>
that she can have all for herself..<br/>
Thanks Sandra for the simple but great idea!<br/>

<br/>
Sandra, what an exchange it was! I&#39;m so grateful to you for your time and<br/>
thoughts to those dozen and more questions! I&#39;m looking forward to<br/>
continuing this for the second part of the interview :-)<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
