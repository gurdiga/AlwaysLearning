they attended? What did your Japanese students think of unschoolers? I have<br/>
an almost 8 year old dd that is a non reader..something that I am totally<br/>
comfortable with. but I&#39;m alittle bit afraid of being put on the<br/>
spot..trying to decide if the risks would be worth it. They are really<br/>
encouraging us to do this..as we are a farm/country family and several of<br/>
these girls are really wanting to experience farm life.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
