<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121823592">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
My unschooled 8 year old went to school today. I&#39;m trying to let it be, see<br/>
what she wants to see. Her teacher is friendly, she has a piano in the class,<br/>
and plants. Though I have one pursuing a formal acedemic path, I have 2 babes<br/>
home, and I will always believe being home is best. How strange it was to get<br/>
up and find shoes and make a pb and j sando. Ashley was very helpful, getting<br/>
the 2 year old dressed and the 5 year old&#39;s shoes on. This is a grand thing in<br/>
our house. Helpful attitudes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503185026">Hi:  I have an eight year old at home today and who did not start<br/>
school.  That classroom sounds nice, though.  Nate has no desire to<br/>
return after a year and half.  Lisa of Great Falls.  <br/>
