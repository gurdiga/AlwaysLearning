<div id="ygrps-yiv-896192020">My son have mates on roblox (a video game online) and they are often grounded (banned? not sure of the word in English) or allowed to play only for a short time by their parents who believe that to get good grades in school, they can&#39;t play video games but study AND because parents believe that playing video games is addictive. It&#39;s so sad ... What could I do to be a best friend during those difficult moments ?<br/>
