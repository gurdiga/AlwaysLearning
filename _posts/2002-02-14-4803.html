<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250809366">&lt;&lt;Humans have wanted to fly always.  They dream about it.  They can&#39;t fly.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;&quot;My oldest daughter was passionate about wanting to fly when she was little.<br/>
She&#39;d tape feathers all over her body and then jump off the steps, sincerely<br/>
believing she&#39;d get it right if she&#39;d just practice.&quot;&quot;<br/>

My 5yo Eve wants to fly like Peter Pan- She is constantly trying to think her way around it. Her daddy &quot;flys&quot; her around- Passionate is a good word- I used &quot;obsessed&quot;, but it sounds so negative. Eve is &quot;passionate&quot; about Peter Pan. She is convinced he is real- (even though she told me she knows he&#39;s pretend). she put a letter in the tree outside for him- she said that if he is real, he&#39;ll take the letter. The first night he did not come- she was a bit disapointed, but not upset- I told her we could pretend he is real if she wanted to put the note back tonight. The next morning there was a little pouch tied to the tree with mentos in it- (Daddy&#39;s favorite mints). She was tickled, and whispered to me that she thinks her daddy is Peter Pan. We have had a lot of fun with this- <br/>
I wish I could fly too!<br/>
