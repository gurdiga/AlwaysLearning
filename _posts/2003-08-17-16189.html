<div id="ygrps-yiv-614661053"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &lt;&lt; Other than food, how do you determine when they should use their own<br/>
&gt; money? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No one particular way.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s money they can spend however they want to.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are very young, and I started them on allowances because I absolutely refuse to spend my money in vending<br/>
machines. While I refuse to do so, I figured they could use that experience, so I started giving them 75 cents a week.<br/>
I figured they didn&#39;t know what it was to have &quot;enough&quot; or &quot;not enough&quot; for something. The checkbook always seems<br/>
bottomless. They both have automatic deposit--I keep a piece of paper in my purse that says how much they have and I<br/>
(theoretically) update it every Monday.and when they buy something.<br/>
<br/>
Brian&#39;s five, and he won&#39;t buy stuff from vending machines; he says he&#39;s saving for train stuff. Katherine&#39;s three,<br/>
and she&#39;ll often get them each one from the vending machine. The last time he wanted a train car and didn&#39;t have<br/>
enough he convinced Katherine to kick in on that, too.<br/>
<br/>
Basically I determine when *I* am going to buy something, and they determine if they want it enough for *them* to buy<br/>
something. For instance, this last train purchase, I was buying $60 worth of track and stuff and he wanted a third<br/>
Thomas (in addition to 3-4 other engines plus cars). I wasn&#39;t going to buy another engine. Sometimes when I say no<br/>
they want to pick it up and sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
Basically they&#39;re both broke now. Maybe I&#39;ll have to give them a conference bonus--is there likely to be small stuff<br/>
kids are likely to want to buy for themselves?<br/>
