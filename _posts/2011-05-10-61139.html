<div id="ygrps-yiv-848183238">After my daughter and I discussed her hair options, she thought long and hard about it and then asked me to cut it.  We put in the movie &quot;Coraline&quot; (awesome flick!), and I spent the entire hour and forty minutes of the movie snipping and combing.  It looks so much better now, and solves the most pressing problem my daughter had with it, which was being unable to get her riding helmet to fit correctly and comfortably.  So we&#39;re good for now, and as it grows back out again I can investigate products, You Tube videos and braiding techniques.  Now that it&#39;s all said and done, I&#39;m glad that the solution came from her and wasn&#39;t something I &quot;made&quot; her do.  It was actually a fun time for us together, which it certainly wouldn&#39;t have been if I had made the decision for her.<br/>

Thanks again,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1526917759">I&#39;m a redhead and as a kid I *hated* my hair (it was different and made me<br/>
stand out). I also remember lots of unhappy times when my hair was being<br/>
combed. And lots of times I got in trouble for being told to comb it and<br/>
then not doing a good enough job.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m always positive about Megan&#39;s hair because I want her to be<br/>
proud of it. We&#39;ve come up with the word &quot;floof-i-tude&quot; to describe her<br/>
hair. It is floofy and bouncy. :-)<br/>

There&#39;s a story of when Marty and Kirby were little, before I knew what I know now.  They they were already bright and thoughtful.  I&#39;m glad I was able to become a better mom than I might have been, and than I sometimes lapsed toward.<br/>
<br/>
That matches today&#39;s &quot;Just Add Light and Stir&quot; post, in a way:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sometimes, I think that the main difference between unschoolers and other<br/>
parents is that we are more willing to learn from our children.  I am so<br/>
often amazed and grateful for the natural wisdom that comes out of my<br/>
children.<br/>
