<div id="ygrps-yiv-866826881">&lt;&lt;How&#39;s the Australia-trek going?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great! He&#39;s now in Tasmania and planning to stay a couple weeks in <br/>
Hobart, which is down south. He called last night, in fact, and said <br/>
that he had been driving in a brutal rain storm the night before and the <br/>
car had gone out of control, spinning one-and-a-half times around and <br/>
landing in a ditch! One of the those I want to know about AFTER it&#39;s <br/>
happened and I know he&#39;s safe!<br/>
<br/>
Under that heading, we came home a couple nights ago to find the kitchen <br/>
ceiling raining! Water was just POURING out of the recessed lights--all <br/>
over the kitchen island, the (hardwood) floors, the counters, etc., <br/>
etc., etc. My daughter&#39;s boyfriend (manfriend) leaped onto the island <br/>
and pulled out the recessed lights, dumping the stored-up water <br/>
out--something I wouldn&#39;t have thought to do, bless his heart. An <br/>
overflowing toilet upstairs caused the problem. My other daughter was in <br/>
the basement and didn&#39;t do anything &#39;cause she thought it was raining <br/>
outside!<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m dealing with insurance estimators and contractors and what-all. <br/>
I&#39;m not telling Eric about this until it&#39;s all been taken care of, since <br/>
he can&#39;t do anything from 10,000 miles away. He&#39;ll come home to a <br/>
stronger, more independent wife, that&#39;s for sure!<br/>
<br/>
Oh, one other thing--we turned onto our street last night and saw a <br/>
police car at the neighbor&#39;s house. I pulled up in front of our house <br/>
and realized that our neighbor and a policeman were heading toward us <br/>
with really concerned looks on their faces. I assumed we had been <br/>
burgled (spell check didn&#39;t have anything to say about that!) or <br/>
something, but what they told us was that our dog had been outside <br/>
(about 20 degrees and snowing here last night) for hours and wouldn&#39;t <br/>
let anyone come near her! Poor little baby cockapoo. Apparently my <br/>
daughter had let her out and forgotten to let her in. It&#39;s illegal to <br/>
have dogs loose here--a policy I totally agree with--but we let ours out <br/>
in back and she pees (spellcheck did get that one-?!) and comes right <br/>
back in with use watching the whole time. The poor thing was cold and <br/>
thirsty and terrified and just yelped and yelped when she saw us. After <br/>
determining that we aren&#39;t deadbeats, the police guy left, but I thought <br/>
our neighbors acted a little strange (after all, they had been cajoling <br/>
our dog for hours before calling for help). I&#39;m going to make soup and <br/>
bake cookies for them today.<br/>
<br/>
I guess all&#39;s well that end&#39;s well! And NO one will EVER forget about <br/>
the dog again!<br/>
