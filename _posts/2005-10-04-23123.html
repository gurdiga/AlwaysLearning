<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318052127">I&#39;m leaving for a week and might or might not get to check back, but I did <br/>
change the list&#39;s settings so that new members&#39; posts don&#39;t have to be screened. <br/>
  That means you might get spam.<br/>
<br/>
IF THERE IS SPAM, let it go by without comment, please.   Comments just end <br/>
up jamming the list up worse.   Thanks.   There might not be any; if there is, <br/>
I hope it&#39;s not too irritating.<br/>
<br/>
Someone on another list deposited a pack of lies, and I have refuted the one <br/>
that was about one of my kids here:<br/>

Okay, back to the other things!   Have a good week.<br/>
