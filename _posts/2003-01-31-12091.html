<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;&gt;I worry about this for Julian. For those of you who don&#39;t know, he has<br/>
&gt; &gt;three<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;parents: Me (biological mother), my partner Beth, and his father, Perry.<br/>
&gt; &gt;We<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;have an excellent relationship with Perry, but the truth is, that if<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;something happened to me, whatever Julian needed or Beth wanted, Perry<br/>
&gt; &gt;could<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;call all the shots. I THINK he would want to do what&#39;s best for Julian,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;including NOT sending him to school, but I am not certain. It&#39;s scary. <br/>
&gt; And<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;Julian HAS thought about it, and has talked about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;Would it help for him to talk about his worries with Perry?<br/>
&gt; &gt;Tia<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; He tends not to find talking to Perry useful. Perry means well, but <br/>
&gt; sometimes <br/>
&gt; does not respond as well as he could, and Julian does not like talking <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; his feelings very much. I think the best thing to do would have me talk to <br/>
&gt; Perry when he&#39;s in a good mood.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I talked with perry this morning about this, and Julian&#39;s (and our) concerns. <br/>
He reassured me that it&#39;s not even a question. When Juls got up he told him <br/>
we&#39;re all going to write out some stuff that addresses this. He said that <br/>
unfortunately they only allow him to have two legal parents but if anything <br/>
happened to me or Perry, Beth would adopt him. And that they would do <br/>
anything they could to make sure he was well cared for and his life would be <br/>
stable, including continuing learning at home.<br/>
<br/>
Julian was very happy, and it reminded me that we are VERY lucky that Perry <br/>
is really a very good person.<br/>

happy and feels safe.  And, it&#39;s good to know that you and Beth feel safe, <br/>
too.  This must be a tremendous relief for all of you!<br/>
