<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014003978">Hi,<br/>
I am planning my fall schedule for lessons;<br/>
Tick Nock Farm<br/>
Lessons in Horsemanship<br/>
 <br/>
I start all my students out in private lessons and then move them to semi-private lessons when I feel they can <br/>
safely handle a horse in a small group. <br/>
 <br/>
 I teach them groom and tack-up the horse and then we work <br/>
on yoga type exercises to improve strength, flexibility <br/>
and effectiveness as a rider.<br/>
 <br/>
I am located in the south valley about ten minutes from the Big-I.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My rates are $25.00 per lesson during prime time and<br/>
$20.00 per lesson during non-prime hours.<br/>
Prime Time = all day Saturday and Sunday and weekdays after 3:00.<br/>
I currently have openings on Thursdays and Fridays.<br/>
 <br/>
For more information please call Tere @ 452-9591.<br/>
Please leave a message as I am outside most of the time.<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

And it&#39;s not even about unschooling! That&#39;s the shocking part. <br/>
<br/>
He found something in the SCA section of my website about it being rude to <br/>
come up with an unpronounceable SCA name and then to expect people to know how <br/>
to pronounce it. <br/>
<br/>
I was interviewed yesterday morning (Tuesday). Wednesday mid-afternoon I <br/>
get a call from my friend Cathyn asking if I had been interviewed by the BBC <br/>
recently. Yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Well his wife got e-mail from her friend in Minnesota...<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was interviewed two other times, one by someone writing a <br/>
technology and business article on TVs in kids&#39; rooms, and then later in the week by <br/>
someone from Salon.com. THAT one was about unschooling, and when that <br/>
article is available I&#39;ll let you know.<br/>
<br/>
Busy strangers-on-the-phone week. Fun. <br/>

Subject: Rue&#39;s new book<br/>
<br/>
Rue Kream is ready to take orders for her new book. She&#39;s not <br/>
comfortable blowing her own horn, but *I* am delighted to! <br/>
<br/>
Entitled _Parenting a Free Child: An Unschooled Life_, it is in a Q&A <br/>
format where Rue answers most, if not all , of the questions we all <br/>
have heard or will hear as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sweet, gentle book---just like Rue! And self-published!<br/>
<br/>
I hope she will be flooded with your orders!<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s her new website to promote the book---go judge this book by its <br/>
lovely cover! <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.freechild.info/">http://www.freechild.info/</a><br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s Rue&#39;s cute little butt! <br/>
<br/>
~Kelly, tickled to death to announce this!<br/>

Thank you, Kelly, queen of the plug . And thanks so much for mentioning<br/>
my butt :o).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to save on shipping you can order now and I can bring the<br/>
books to the conference. So if any of those who have ordered already (man,<br/>
you&#39;re fast!) will be there, let me know if you&#39;d rather do it that way and<br/>
I&#39;ll refund your shipping charges.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to your regularly scheduled program. ~Rue<br/>

How cool! And a good article -- what fun to be in it. I constantly deal with people mispronouncing our last name: Valenzuela -- and our daughter, Noelle, is constantly called Nicole by people. I can understand the hard time with Valenzuela, but calling Noelle by the name Nicole? I don&#39;t get that.<br/>

<br/>
That was an interesting article. And the comments from some people were <br/>
funny. <br/>
<br/>
My dad told me that &quot;life is hard enough, without saddling your kid with a <br/>
hard name.&quot; His kids are named John, Steve and Karen. Believe it or not, <br/>
lots of people think Karen is spelled with a C, and it&#39;s mostly men who make <br/>
that error. I guess it reminds them of Carol. My kids are Jake, Jon and Will. <br/>
Jake was pretty exotic for rural Arkansas in 1982, but turned out to be <br/>
pretty popular! 3 Jakes one baseball team when he was 8!<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it&#39;s because it&#39;s in Britian, but I thought it odd that it said <br/>
&#39;people from New York call her &quot;Sarndra&quot;,&#39; and they spelled with that extra R <br/>
in the middle. I would have spelled it Sahndra. Later or in the comments <br/>
they use an AR in another word where I would have put an AH to denote that <br/>
sound. R is more of a hard consonant to me, than H.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up in Chicago, with a lot of Irish around me. I&#39;ve been interested <br/>
in dialect and pronunciation ever since I moved from there to Arkansas when I <br/>
was 11. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too. <br/>
And I&#39;d&#39;ve spelled the southern way &quot;Say-en dra&quot; but I guess he was writing <br/>
what Brits would pronounce.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about some of the kids in England not hearing the different between <br/>
the way they pronounced &quot;Holly&quot; and the way she did. He couldn&#39;t hear it <br/>
either at first, but we talked about it and he pronounced the two different <br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
What he said was clear and true, but over-simplified (but it was a REALLY <br/>
short article so that&#39;s understandable). I said older relatives from Texas <br/>
pronounced it all stretched out, and older people from the NE U.S. tended toward <br/>
the &quot;Sahndra&quot; version. He left out it being older people. I had said <br/>
people younger go with the way I say it maybe because of Sandra Bullock or other <br/>
Sandras being out there and having their names pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
The way he found me was googling &quot;unpronounceable names&quot; and he got an <br/>
article I wrote years ago about SCA naming practices, mostly of local groups, but <br/>
the last paragraph was:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Personal names are absolutely more personal. If an individual wants to have <br/>
an unpronounceable name, it&#39;s his or her own business. If an individual wants <br/>
to have an unpronounceable name and then expect every herald to magically <br/>
deduce it and every chronicler to unfailingly spell it, this is about like putting <br/>
a chip on your shoulder and then knocking it off yourself. If your name is odd <br/>
or foreign, you must graciously live with the inconvenience and you should be <br/>
the one to apologize if a herald mispronounces it.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Oh. And I had said &quot;Anyone who can read Middle English,&quot; and he said &quot;fluent&quot; <br/>
because I guess it&#39;s funnier. <br/>
