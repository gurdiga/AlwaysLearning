&gt;<br/>
&gt;or that 2 + 2 doesn&#39;t always equal four<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, my almost 20 yo who went to public school save for 9th grade <br/>
always likes to start these heated debates with me, and he said <br/>
such-and-such was fact just like &quot;2+2=4&quot;.  Of course, I had to mention <br/>
that 2+2 doesn&#39;t ALWAYS equal 4 and he called me on it.  Not being a <br/>
mathhead, I could only vaguely remember Pam S posting about it long ago <br/>
in the AOL math folder and that it had something to do with base 8.  I <br/>
googled but couldn&#39;t find anything and we moved on in our silly debate, <br/>
he believing that he&#39;d won a point, when he still hasn&#39;t figured out <br/>
that I&#39;m humoring his youthful arrogance.  (And I can&#39;t even REMEMBER <br/>
what the debate was about in the first place!)<br/>
<br/>
So, when doesn&#39;t 2+2 equal 4 again?  &lt;sheepish grin&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No need to be sheepish about it! Not too many people need to think in other<br/>
bases during the course of daily life so the explanations, just as in<br/>
school, go in but don&#39;t have anything to stick to os eventually fade away.<br/>
As far as I know the only people who put bases to practical use are computer<br/>
scientists.<br/>
<br/>
It *can* lead to an &quot;aha&quot; moment of why numbers are represented the way they<br/>
are for some people. And for others it can just be a lot of seemingly<br/>
useless mathematical noise. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
In base 3 2+2 would equal 11.<br/>
<br/>
But calling it base &quot;3&quot; is confusing since there wouldn&#39;t be a single digit<br/>
for three. It would be represented as 1 followed by a 0 meaning 1 set of<br/>
three and 0 sets of units. So counting in base 3 would go:<br/>
<br/>
01<br/>
02<br/>
10<br/>
11<br/>
12<br/>
20<br/>
21<br/>
22<br/>
100<br/>
101 &lt;- that represents 1 set of 3x3 and 1 set of units or 10 in base ten.<br/>
<br/>
and so on.<br/>
<br/>
So 1202 would represent:<br/>
<br/>
1 set of 3x3x3 = 27<br/>
2 sets of 3x3 = 18<br/>
0 sets of 3 = 0<br/>
2 sets of 1&#39;s = 2<br/>
which all adds up to and is 47 in base 10.<br/>
<br/>
In base 4 2+2 would equal 10. (1 set of 4 and 0 sets of units.)<br/>
<br/>
In base 5 and all bases above 2+2 would equal 4.<br/>
<br/>
In any base the columns represent how many of that power of that number you<br/>
have so:<br/>
<br/>
2345 in base 10 is:<br/>
<br/>
2 x 10x10x10 (10 to the 3rd power which I would write as 10 with a 3 up in<br/>
the air if I could!)<br/>
3 x 10x10    (10 to the 2nd power)<br/>
4 x 10       (10 to the 1st power)<br/>
5 x 1        (10 to the 0th power)<br/>
<br/>
2345 in base 8 is<br/>
<br/>
2 x 8x8x8 = 2 x 512 = 1024<br/>
3 x 8x8   = 3 x 64  =  192<br/>
4 x 8     = 4 x 8   =   32<br/>
5 x 1     = 5 x 1   =    5<br/>
<br/>
which in base 10 is 1253.<br/>
<br/>
Every time you write down a number you&#39;re doing addition, multiplication and<br/>
powers :-) In fact when you write down money, you&#39;re using negative powers:<br/>
<br/>
$1.67 is<br/>
<br/>
1 x 1   (10 to the 0th power)<br/>
6 x .1  (10 to the -1 power)<br/>
7 x .01 (10 to the -2 power)<br/>
<br/>
Things get interesting in bases above 10 since we don&#39;t have single digits<br/>
for numbers above 9. As far as I know, the only base that gets used is base<br/>
16 for computer work and computer scientists use letters:<br/>
<br/>
base 8  base 10<br/>
1    =    1<br/>
2    =    2<br/>
3    =    3<br/>
4    =    4<br/>
5    =    5<br/>
6    =    6<br/>
7    =    7<br/>
8    =    8<br/>
9    =    9<br/>
0A    =    10<br/>
0B    =    11<br/>
0C    =    12<br/>
0D    =    13<br/>
0E    =    14<br/>
0F    =    15<br/>
10    =    16<br/>
11    =    17<br/>
12    =    18<br/>
13    =    19<br/>
14    =    20<br/>
15    =    21<br/>
16    =    22<br/>
17    =    23<br/>
18    =    24<br/>
19    =    25<br/>
1A    =    26<br/>
1B    =    27<br/>
<br/>
and so on.<br/>
<br/>
So in base 16 8+8 is 10. (1 set of 16 and zero units.)<br/>
A+A = 14 (10+10 = 1 set of 16 plus 4 sets of units)<br/>
D+D = 1A (13+13 = 1 set of 16 plus 10 sets of units)<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is curious why anyone would want to do such nonsense, it&#39;s because<br/>
computers at one time sent information in chunks of 16 bits. (You may have<br/>
heard the term 16 bit addressing. I think they&#39;re up to 32 bit addressing<br/>
now.) Computers, of course, use base 2 arithmetic. (Each bit (physically a<br/>
wire or some channel carrying electricity or, now, light) can only exist in<br/>
one of two states, either on or off, represented by 1 and 0). To talk about<br/>
a 16 bit number you need a string of 16 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s. So to talk about a<br/>
particular location (address) in a computer, you&#39;d need to write out 16 1&#39;s<br/>
and 0&#39;s. It&#39;s a lot easier to compress that into a single digit that not<br/>
only represents that string of 16 but can also be easily expanded back into<br/>
the string of 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Which is probably way more than anyone wanted to know ;-)<br/>

Nevertheless, it WAS interesting (when I wasn&#39;t glazed over). <br/>
<br/>
At least I know where to send my children when they ask! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
