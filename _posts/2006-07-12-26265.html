reminded I told Sandra I&#39;d try to find the Ambigram Generator I&#39;d  <br/>
stumbled across once. I figured I might as well share it here :-)<br/>

Ambigrams are words written in such a way that they read the same  <br/>
right side up and upside down. NOON is a natural ambigram.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s *very* clever that they could design a program to do that.  <br/>
Though they aren&#39;t nearly as elegant as the human generated ones! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Scott Kim is a master at them. His book Inversions is *very* cool and  <br/>
includes words that turn into other words when turned upside down.  <br/>
His website is:<br/>

If you type ambigrams into Google Image search you&#39;ll see over 2000  <br/>
of them:<br/>
