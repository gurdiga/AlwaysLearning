<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101006540">I was responding to an e-mail and decided to bring it here for more ideas.  A four-year-old (recently turned four) wants to learn cursive writing as the mom writes.<br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think she sees handwriting right now as an art form and not as a means of communication. I could be wrong, but that&#39;s the sense I get.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
If she wants cursive penmanship, that&#39;s not the same as writing for communication, which is nowadays done just as I&#39;m communicating with you (or by phone texts).<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/writing">http://sandradodd.com/writing</a> talks about the different aspects of &quot;writing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t show you what I think might help her here, but loops---the loops that eventually become small &quot;e&quot; and &quot;l&quot; in cursive.  If you and she can practice making those in succession, so her hand can travel to the right and she can practice being consistent in size and spacing, that&#39;s a good practice.  My granny who had been born in 1902 or so, showed me those.  And another one was drawing ocean waves (small &quot;i&quot; but without dots) across a page.  <br/>
<br/>
Then I would decorate those, turn them into flowers or a fence or something.  Color in the loops.<br/>
<br/>
There were the fancy ocean waves, too, for &quot;c&quot; or &quot;o&quot;, but those are difficult and frustrating.  I would stick with &quot;i&quot; &quot;e&quot; and &quot;l&quot; now, connected up all across a row.<br/>
<br/>
But if your daughter were saying she wanted to drive a car, you might give her a toy car to play with, and tell her someday she can drive.<br/>
<br/>
Would she like to put her hand on your hand as you write?  Maybe she could close her eyes and put her hand over yours and just feel the movement.<br/>
<br/>
-=-My concern is that she has voiced a desire to learn cursive several times and I feel that I&#39;m failing to provide an environment or the right tools for her to learn how to do it.=-<br/>
<br/>
If when she voices a desire you offer a tool, that&#39;s all you can do right now.  Be sweet and encouraging, don&#39;t tell her she&#39;s too little, don&#39;t say &quot;you can&#39;t&quot; or &quot;you can.&quot;  She can&#39;t until she can, but there&#39;s no sense saying so. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Holly had a little electronic spelling tool the size of a calculator when she was young, and if you put in a word (on the little keyboard) it showed the word, and then wrote it in cursive, slowly, and showed it again.   <br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Other ideas?  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-476274175">Sandra&#39;s idea of her putting her hand over yours, and sticking with i,l,c sound like a nice way for her to literally &#39;get a feel&quot; for it and not become too frustrated.  If it seems like she&#39;s wanting to explore more independently, perhaps bring home something like this erasable placemat:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Painless-Learning-SSR1-Cursive-Placemat/dp/B000J2GX4Q">http://www.amazon.com/Painless-Learning-SSR1-Cursive-Placemat/dp/B000J2GX4Q</a><br/>
<br/>
We have a ton of these with various themes, like the human body and maps, and Noor loved writing/drawing on them.  They come with a crayon type of writing tool, but we found *washable* markers work better and clean up easily.  Test whatever you use on a small corner first.<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading (a looooong time ago) that cursive is more difficult with a pencil, because of drag/friction, I guess. So maybe using something where a pen really glides, like a dry earase board, would be fun too.<br/>
<br/>
When Noor was that age she loved Sagwa, a cartoon by Amy Tan about Chinese cats who were court caligraphers.  She spent a few months drawing caligraphy.  She would even find all kinds of things non-pen-like to use to draw because Sagwa used her tail. I brought home books on Chinese symbols and caligraphy and sometimes she would ask me to help her find a specific symbol and then she&#39;d copy it, but mostly she made it up as she went along.  She was, for the most part, wholy interested in it for the art form.<br/>
<br/>
But......not knowing where your daughter is on her journey with reading/writing, I also wonder if she may be curious about what your writing says.  About a year ago, I started writing my grocery lists and other &quot;public&quot; text in print because I knew Noor wanted, sometimes, to be able to work out the words (on her own, without having to ask).  That may or may not be something to think about with your daughter too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-591375907">I&#39;ve seen laminated sheets for &quot;handwriting practice&quot; in shops - dollar store type places, but also office supply stores, too. Those could be fun. <br/>
<br/>
Mo loved stencils when she was 4-5 and wanted to write but couldn&#39;t make the letters independently. I haven&#39;t seen stencils for cursive, but if you&#39;re handy you can make stencils - look in craft and fabric shops for the supplies or you can make simple ones with posterboard and a razor blade. For that matter, if you look in the quilting and home decor sections you&#39;ll find stencils of loops and waves, although the loops are awkward to trace as they&#39;re all broken up to keep the stencil together. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also a kind of doodling that she might enjoy, where you draw random lines without lifting your pen or pencil. I think of it as an exercise for machine-quilters, since that&#39;s what I do ;) and you may find good ideas if you look in quilting books under &quot;fill patterns&quot;. All over squiggles, wave patterns, and loops are standard fill patterns, and they&#39;re fun to draw, too and then go back and color. <br/>
<br/>
Whatever you do, it could help to start Big rather than small, although that will depend a lot on your daughter. But if she likes get her some big paper or a big dry-erase board where she can draw giant loops and waves and great big letters. Some people find it easier to learn large. <br/>

My daughter, 4 this week, likes to play with shaving cream on the windows and writing with a brush or finger in that would be a nice way to practice loops too. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344095715">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
In Australia you can buy books which show the cursive letters and then have dotted letters which you can write over, then space below to practise them again on your own. The books range in levels so the letters are bigger for younger childern. Letters are grouped according to how they are made (i.e. similar shapes such as a, e, c, d, g and q) and there are patterns to write over and practisewhich flow in the same way as the letters to enable the writer to get the &#39;feel&#39; of them.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you get something like that. Not sure if they are available in the states or online.<br/>

Sumi-e embodies concepts that can lead to all sorts of interesting things --<br/>
negative vs positive tones and spaces, perspective, fine motor skills,<br/>
learning about the Asian cultures that are represented by sumi-e, and more.<br/>
You could go on to such things as paper making, using other materials to<br/>
create sumi-e art (we used the bark from birch and sycamore trees, with some<br/>
lovely results).<br/>

Kids&#39; artwork naturally employs some of the characteristics of abstract art.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t have to &quot;lead&quot; anywhere, though. We&#39;re talking about a young child wanting to play with the pretty, loopy shapes of mommy&#39;s best handwriting - just that is enough. Maybe the same child would like to paint or draw, play with stencils or color in all the letter Os on a page... and maybe she&#39;s just fascinated by mommy&#39;s pretty loops. There&#39;s no need to turn this into a series of &quot;teachable moments&quot; or create a &quot;learning experience&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
There are a gazillion ways in which children play which &quot;improve fine motor skills&quot; - they do those things naturally, as they are ready, given the time and lots of little things to manipulate. It&#39;s good to bring lots of exciting, rich things into the house and its good to keep the needs of young children in mind. It&#39;s not necessary to start breaking everything a child does down into skills and subject-matter, though. Playing with loops can be fun for its own sake, nevermind pre-this and building good that and practicing the other thing. <br/>

We had a box, with coloring books, stained-glass-window coloring sets, workbooks, mazes, connect-the-dots...<br/>

There was an Animaniacs workbook on math that both Marty and Holly really liked.  They would pick it up and do a page or two.  They finished most of it, but not all, after a few years. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That program looked interesting, but $40 is a lot to pay.  Still it&#39;s an interesting idea to have something that can create cursive &quot;worksheets&quot; from one&#39;s own texts.   Not the greatest thing for deschooling purposes, but cool from a &quot;how did they program that&quot; point of view.<br/>
<br/>
Reading fancy cursive writing might be the art that will be lost next after producing fancy cursive. :-)<br/>
Many people can&#39;t read cursive already, and that&#39;s not a huge loss to the world.  Smaller loss.<br/>

I think what that program does (and I&#39;m not saying anyone should buy it) is makes a trace-the-cursive &quot;lesson&quot; from whatever text a person enters.  So no doubt ten-year-old boys would have a field day figuring out whether there were blocks on &quot;bad words.&quot;    I thought it was an interesting idea, so I let the post through even though it was slightly toward the curriculum end of the world. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But sure, a mom could write something in cursive with a light-colored pen and the child could trace over that and it would be similar.   But very young children (barely four) probably can&#39;t trace cursive.  So it was more a brainstorming &quot;oh cool&quot; response on my part, and I would hate for the original poster to feel obligated to defend it.<br/>

Getting a bit OT of the original question, but just thought I&#39;d point that out, for anyone who is interested in that sort of thing, save the $40.  You can find similiar sites that offer the same for print writing instead of cursive.<br/>

&gt; person enters.  So no doubt ten-year-old boys would have a field day  <br/>
&gt; figuring out whether there were blocks on &quot;bad words.&quot;    I thought  <br/>
&gt; it was an interesting idea, so I let the post through even though it  <br/>
&gt; was slightly toward the curriculum end of the world. :-)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But sure, a mom could write something in cursive with a light- <br/>
&gt; colored pen and the child could trace over that and it would be  <br/>
&gt; similar.   But very young children (barely four) probably can&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; trace cursive.  So it was more a brainstorming &quot;oh cool&quot; response on  <br/>
&gt; my part, and I would hate for the original poster to feel obligated  <br/>
&gt; to defend it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was probably responding more to the language that popped out at me:<br/>
<br/>
-=- I think both my children would love to create their own messages to<br/>
practice their writing. They love when we are all doing the same thing  <br/>
together<br/>
and I thought I could practice my cursive writing, while they practice  <br/>
whatever<br/>
they choose to do.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The word &quot;practice&quot; stood out and made me wonder why 4- and 6-year- <br/>
olds were &quot;practicing&quot; writing? Whatever they&#39;re doing, they&#39;re  <br/>
actually *doing* it!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Practice&quot; makes me think of enforcing something for an end result  <br/>
envisioned by an adult &lt;g&gt;. However, it could be want the kids want to  <br/>
do it of their own volition (like one might &quot;practice&quot; piano or guitar  <br/>
to get better at it), so in that case, never mind!<br/>

Good point, but tracing handwriting isn&#39;t writing, either.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe &quot;play with it&quot; would solve both problems.<br/>

If I sit and write the same letters or words over and over, I&#39;m practicing.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of handwriting or calligraphy.   Really *doing* it should produce something someone else could read.<br/>
<br/>
Similarly with music, if I&#39;m trying to get a certain interval or alternate fingering or phrase smooth and right, or I&#39;m trying to figure out chords or fingerpicking on a guitar song, and am diddling around for a comfortable, fast way to change from one chord to another, with a few good strings to hit in the passage from one chord to another, that&#39;s not &quot;playing guitar&quot; or &quot;playing recorder&quot; just for that time I&#39;m figuring something out or repeating it to gain confidence.   <br/>
<br/>
But I don&#39;t think someone should call ALL of what they do with an instrument at home &quot;practice,&quot; because sometimes they&#39;re all the way to playing music, even if it&#39;s not full-length performance style, or full volume.<br/>

do it. I don&#39;t think of either of them as &quot;practicing&quot; for some reason.<br/>
