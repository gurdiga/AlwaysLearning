<div id="ygrps-yiv-164602591">How would you go about helping your child to learn about roller coasters?  <br/>
<br/>
After we looked at pictures of roller coasters online and went to various amusement park sites, I remembered hearing about a game called Roller Coaster Tycoon, wherein you can make your own roller coasters.  We got the game and then Margaux&#39;s computer crashed.  So, we will probably install it tomorrow.  We&#39;ve talked a little about centrifugal force and we swung buckets of water upside down in a circle so Margaux (7) could see how the water stays in the bucket just like people stay in the roller coaster when it goes upside down.  What else can we do?  <br/>
<br/>
All ideas greatly appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance,<br/>

You can go ride rollercoasters!  My son has been riding them since he  was <br/>
about 4.  He can&#39;t work up the courage go to on the really big ones,  like <br/>
Raptor or Top-Thrill Dragster at Cedar Point.  He is very fascinated  by them, <br/>
though.  He avoided ones that made you go upside down until last  year (he&#39;s <br/>
almost 11) and now he avoids really high ones.<br/>
 <br/>
He builds mondo roller-coasters on RCT, as well. He knows all about how  they <br/>
are built and how they work, just because of RCT.  Sometimes that  hasn&#39;t <br/>
been helpful when he&#39;s trying to work up his courage to ride a new  one, though.<br/>
 <br/>
RCT is kind of buggy, though.  It has crashed various of our computers  as <br/>
well, and it matters about what kind of processor, etc., of the  computer.  On <br/>
this newest computer we have no problems.  It&#39;s a great  program otherwise, <br/>
though.  He has learned so much about money and managing  things from that <br/>
program.  I posted once about the words he has learned  from RCT.  I wonder if I can <br/>
find that?  If I do, I&#39;ll repost.  <br/>

about them...is it overcoming a fear, wanting to know about the physics,<br/>
interested in construction, preparing for a vacation at Disneyland (go to<br/>
the little one in Toontown first!), some other reason I&#39;m not thinking<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565273992">She&#39;s not quite there, yet, but I&#39;m hoping next season she will be after finding out more about them and talking to friends.  We&#39;re going to be writing letters to all Margaux&#39;s friends and some relatives asking about their roller coaster experiences.  :o)  And when Margaux&#39;s done playing some roller coaster game on the net (she&#39;s doing that right now), we&#39;re going to try to install RCT.  Yippee!  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the great info about it.  :o)<br/>
