<div id="ygrps-yiv-416052754">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let you know how very much I appreciate the way you respond <br/>
to everyone at this group. I lvoe that you don&#39;t beat around the bush - <br/>
there&#39;s not enough time to waste when it comes to helping others understand <br/>
unschooling better. I thank you for the way you stand up for our children <br/>
and the lifestyle we are all aspiring to. I have come to a much, much better <br/>
understanding of many, many thnigs since being in this group and hearing <br/>
your words of wisdom. I think there&#39;s much to be said about having mentors <br/>
and I for one, feel that in many ways you are mine.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that you&#39;re in a position where you feel under attack at <br/>
times - that&#39;s because you say it how it is and say it so well. I so <br/>
appreciate your stance and I hope that you can continue to be exactly who <br/>
you are.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I think about why people get so defensive, but I don&#39;t lose  <br/>
sleep over it.  I might&#39;ve when I was in my 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s, but with  <br/>
age comes confidence and focus, I think.<br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s probably instinctive with many women to try to make  <br/>
friends with other women (in gatherer terms, I guess, they don&#39;t want  <br/>
to be shunned when root gathering trips come or some damned thing),  <br/>
but we&#39;re on the internet, google can be used for gathering, and I  <br/>
only want friendships with those who are as eager about radical  <br/>
unschooling as I am.<br/>
<br/>
I already know what I want to do and have been doing it for a while.   <br/>
I don&#39;t want to help  moms feel better about being angsty, indecisive  <br/>
moms.  I want kids to feel better, be freer, feel more empowered.<br/>
<br/>
I do realize that many moms are not themselves whole enough not to be  <br/>
needy of attention and mothering, but there are codependency and  <br/>
inner child sites for that.  It&#39;s not my direct interest to soothe  <br/>
and groom moms and hear their tales of woe.  I&#39;m VERY willing to  <br/>
soothe and groom parents whose goal is to unschool and who aren&#39;t  <br/>
just around to get the kind of attention they should be giving to  <br/>
their children.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone can unschool.  I feel no duty or obligation to comfort  <br/>
those who can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to.  It&#39;s not a party, but some people  <br/>
see the discussions as a party instead of as people processing  <br/>
information they need for the task at hand.<br/>
<br/>
Although it can be really fun to discuss it, that doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re  <br/>
just goofing around discussing whatever.  Because we can talk about  <br/>
what SEEMS like all kinds of things, doesn&#39;t mean that every single  <br/>
thing is appropriate.  And lots of people think education-related is  <br/>
more &quot;on topic&quot; than things like...  once we discussed Alan Rickman  <br/>
for a while. That&#39;s more on topic, to my thinking, than justification  <br/>
of labelling kids ADHD.   With ADHD, you wound children.  With Alan  <br/>
Rickman movies, you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I could give lots of examples, and some people reading what&#39;s above   <br/>
might be less clear about my intentions for this list and others  <br/>
might be less clear.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
