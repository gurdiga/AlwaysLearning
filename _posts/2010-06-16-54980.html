Thanks, Robin.  I deleted the original but left your note.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime there&#39;s a link without some substantial discussion of what it  <br/>
might have to do with unschooling, don&#39;t click it.   When people send  <br/>
a post that seems to be nothing but a link, I return it if they&#39;re on  <br/>
moderation.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll put Amy on moderation, too, just in case there&#39;s a repeat.<br/>
