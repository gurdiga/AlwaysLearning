<div id="ygrps-yiv-11104060">I&#39;ve been unschooling for about 5-6 years now.  Homeschooling 7years.<br/>
I&#39;ve rarely worried about my older two with learning what they <br/>
needed, except for a little with math with my oldest.  Still find <br/>
myself needing to let go and trust, but it can be hard when she is <br/>
concerned herself.  I usually end up offering to help her learn some <br/>
basic math stuff, I buy or remind her of games we have.  I print out <br/>
work sheets and help her through them, talk about concepts and ideas <br/>
of real life math and try to help her relax and not worry if she <br/>
isn&#39;t doing algebra like kids in school.  I took it in high school <br/>
and college and can&#39;t do it either.  She really isn&#39;t into math.  She <br/>
doesn&#39;t enjoy trying to figure things out, though she completely <br/>
understands all the math that comes with her bass lessons or  when <br/>
she took a fashion design class and had to figure measurments.<br/>
I wish we could surround ourselves with unschoolers, but like I&#39;ve <br/>
complained before, I&#39;ve been searching for years in my area, with no <br/>
luck.<br/>
Jack is my real issue for this post.  I never had to deal with <br/>
reading with Carly or Sam.  Carly learned while she was in 1st grade <br/>
and Sam went to pre school and k and while not fully reading after k, <br/>
he steadily figured it out within the next year.  I gave full credit <br/>
to his game boy, but he probably did get a lot of basic ideas while <br/>
in school, to help him build on.<br/>
So Jack&#39;s not reading at 7.  No big deal....  <br/>
But, it is a big deal.<br/>
Like I said, we know no unschoolers in our area.  His buddies, who go <br/>
to school, have learned to read.  Hooked on Phonics commercials show <br/>
worried parents and sad kids until they found HOP.  Now they are <br/>
joyful!<br/>
He loves playing Game Cube games, but mostly bypasses the reading <br/>
stuff or has me read things when he realizes the info. must be <br/>
important.  He plays computer games like Reader Rabbit, and lots of <br/>
other software meant to help kids learn to read.  We read books <br/>
together.  <br/>
I don&#39;t doubt he&#39;ll learn eventually, but I&#39;m finding it hard not to <br/>
help him along, with my main thought being, I don&#39;t want him to feel <br/>
like he&#39;s lacking.  I don&#39;t see how he wouldn&#39;t feel that way, when <br/>
even his 4 yo cousin, who we will be seeing this summer can read.<br/>
Telling him that kids learn at all different ages, while true, seems <br/>
like lip service, when everyone he knows except for a few kids <br/>
younger than him, can read.<br/>
He came to me and asked for HOP.  I told him I could help him learn <br/>
if he wanted some help.  &quot;No&quot;, HOP had a video that would show him <br/>
how to read.  I told him to give me 5 minutes a day to show him stuff <br/>
about letters and words that might help him learn, and if by the <br/>
summer he wasn&#39;t reading, and he still wanted HOP, we would get it.<br/>
So here I am giving my kid reading lessons!  <br/>
He wasn&#39;t too into the idea of it being me and not HOP that would <br/>
help him learn, so I offered an incentive.  A quarter for each word <br/>
he learns.  He already knew a few, like MOM, DAD, NO, so we listed <br/>
those, and that instant money gave him some motivation to learn some <br/>
more.<br/>
We started off with vowel sounds.  Long and short.  That one little <br/>
lesson opened up a doorway of &quot;Aha!&quot; for him.  He can figure out <br/>
words like t-o-p, and t-a-p-e, now.<br/>
Whenever I read about unschooling, it&#39;s always to trust your kids, <br/>
they will learn.  I&#39;ve always agreed with that, but sometimes there <br/>
are outside forces that you can&#39;t shield them from that have an <br/>
effect on them.  <br/>
I felt like I had to make a choice between, trying to help him not be <br/>
influenced by our world, for what was the right time for him to read, <br/>
and me not being too influence by the unschooling world and help him <br/>
learn, now.<br/>
So, have I lapsed from unschooling, or did I just trust in my child <br/>
in a different way.  I feel like I was hearing his concerns about not <br/>
reading in the things he said (not just the asking for HOP).<br/>
I do feel like my own fears were mixed in as well, so it&#39;s a little <br/>
murky for me as to weather I&#39;m on the right path.<br/>
He&#39;s not initiating the lessons and he only lasts a few minutes with <br/>
them, but he is learning from them.  We can both see that.<br/>
Any thought?<br/>
Joanna<br/>
<br/>
Oh, a little side note.  I am now having to take Game Cube lessons <br/>
from him.  I didn&#39;t put it together til just now, but maybe he is <br/>
trying to restore some balance by being my teacher is something he&#39;s <br/>
good at.  Interesting....</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-310695208">Hi Joanna,<br/>
<br/>
Would it help Jack if he knew more about HOP?  Folks at this house also <br/>
found the commercials very compelling.  :-)  I think it could be helpful <br/>
for kids to know that commercials are designed to make something appear <br/>
attractive so we will want it.  I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a bad thing, just <br/>
that it might be useful information to understand that things aren&#39;t <br/>
always as great as they sound on the commercials.  Then there is the <br/>
idea that the reason the product may work for some people, is that the <br/>
people with those results probably sit down and work on it every day in <br/>
some kind of rigorous way.  So it&#39;s not the product per se but the daily <br/>
practice perhaps. <br/>
<br/>
Then the product itself.  As you know, it is very expensive.  And <br/>
frankly not all that innovative.  We borrowed it from a friend.  It is a <br/>
series of workbooks, flash cards, and simple reading books.  It is <br/>
organized by color (five different levels) and there are a couple of <br/>
music tapes.  But I&#39;m sure you can find a few workbooks and simple <br/>
reading books for each level for a lot less money.  We still have them <br/>
on loan and have had them for about 5 months.  They were much sought <br/>
after but in reality have been used 2 or 3 times in this house.  I could <br/>
bring a box or two of them to camp in May if he wants to look at it.  <br/>
The whole set is 6 boxes!  The person I am borrowing them from is in no <br/>
rush to get them back.  See how useful they are?!<br/>
<br/>
In any case, regarding the unschooling part, which was what you were <br/>
asking about.  Some times our kids may just want to try classes, the <br/>
learning tools, even school.  They may work for them and they may not.  <br/>
The beauty is that they can try it and step away if it isn&#39;t what they <br/>
thought it would be or what they want.   You&#39;ve asked him to trust you <br/>
with your idea to work for 5 minutes a day.  If he really doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to do it, you&#39;ll stop right?  One thing maybe Jack doesn&#39;t realize is <br/>
that you&#39;ll still be working with him for the 5 minutes, just using the <br/>
HOP tools.  It&#39;s not HOP instead of you.  Unless there is some new thing <br/>
I don&#39;t know about???   My feeling is that we can&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t <br/>
protect them from the outside influences.  We can help them negotiate <br/>
them but ultimately it&#39;s up to them whether or not to be influenced.  I <br/>
guess we can only let them know that it is OK with us that they learn at <br/>
their own pace but if they want to pick up the pace (for whatever <br/>
reason) we will try to help.  Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
I always get confused about adding money into the mix.  I have a lot of <br/>
entrenched ideas on that topic!  Anway, hope some of this helpful. <br/>
