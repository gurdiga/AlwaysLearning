<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096141225">Some families look for joy in being different for the sake of being different, or in adopting radical philosophies to who how &quot;out there&quot; they are.   Unschooling works better when it&#39;s &quot;in here&quot; (in the family, in the soul, in the relationship) than when it&#39;s &quot;out there&quot; (about &quot;the system,&quot; or belonging to a movement, or impressing other parents).  It&#39;s better when it&#39;s about one&#39;s own child, rather than the idea of  wild, &quot;free&quot; child.  <br/>
<br/>
The radical in radical unschooling isn&#39;t fringe, opposite-of-conservative &quot;radical.&quot;  <br/>
It is unschooling from the roots.  It is behavior radiating out from knowledge and belief.<br/>
It can grow and blossom from strong roots.<br/>
<br/>
I hope someday there will be a recording available, but here&#39;s the outline of a talk I gave last year about this.  People might be able to glean something new-to-them from the notes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301735189">I wrote today a long post on the Radical Unschooling Facebook page and at the end I wrote this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; But for some unschooling is all about freedom and that can translate to people and kids who are not mindful of other people. Making our kids aware of social norms, peoples feelings and being mindful of others does not take away our freedom . It just makes us better, nicer and more mindful people.&quot;<br/>
