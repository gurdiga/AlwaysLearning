&lt;&lt; My Dad&#39;s office number was MEtropolitan 8-6103! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first phone number I learned, when I was little and lived in Fort Worth, <br/>
was JEfferson 5-5888<br/>
Pretty easy!!<br/>
<br/>
When we moved to Espanola, we only had to learn the last four numbers, <br/>
because we were on such a small phone exchange we didn&#39;t even have to use <br/>
FIVE numbers, and it was (753)-4104.<br/>
<br/>
Before my time, that prefix had been &quot;PLaza3-<br/>
<br/>
Santa Fe&#39;s were YUcca2 and YUcca3 (still 982 and 983).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what Albuquerque&#39;s were.  I should ask my local historian friend.<br/>
<br/>
Last Thursday my college boyfriend called me.  I had thought he was dead, <br/>
because I couldn&#39;t find him on the internet and he hadn&#39;t contacted me or any <br/>
of our friends for over 20 years.  He called me by finding an old letter from <br/>
1980 and calling the number there.  That was our old house, before I was <br/>
married to Keith (so Keith&#39;s old phone number, when he was living in Salt <br/>
Lake City and I was living in the house he was buying from his parents).  <br/>
When we moved we kept the same phone number, so when my friend Dev called to <br/>
see whether someone at that number might possibly know where I was, I <br/>
answered.<br/>
<br/>
When Keith was working in Minneapolis for six months (which turned into three <br/>
years and some) I could talk to him just about anytime of the day or night.<br/>
<br/>
I like telephones!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1779978540">We had a heavy, hard-wired rotary phone at our old house (black desk model, <br/>
in the bedroom).  Keith and I used it but the kids always used the touch-tone.<br/>

At a thrift store I found a MODERN version (meaning 1960&#39;s or early 70&#39;s) of <br/>
that model, with a jack outlet (whatever the hole is called for a modular <br/>
cord) and it&#39;s plastic more than metal, but still same heavyness and shape <br/>
and dial.  The kids are fine to answer it but not so good at dialing out!  <br/>
Holly&#39;s better than the boys, and we have company sometimes who, asking for a <br/>
phone and having that antique pointed out, get big eyes.   <br/>
<br/>
We have four other phones on that line that don&#39;t involve special arcane <br/>
skills. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1861869713">Well, I was born in &#39;61 and we had the rotary phones. I can remember my<br/>
first number too:<br/>
Willow2-2264....Kansas City, Mo.<br/>
Although, we still had the rotary phones until the &#39;70&#39;s. We thought we were<br/>
pretty cool when we got the rotary princess phone. And once we even had a<br/>
rotary PINK phone.  How fancy is THAT??? LOL<br/>
<br/>
As for kids knowing phone numbers...sorry to mix threads, but since I&#39;m here<br/>
&lt;g&gt;...<br/>
We move a lot. My kids never know their phone numbers until about 6 months<br/>
after moving. And that usually comes because they&#39;re going to be somewhere<br/>
else and I&#39;ve asked them to call home. And, one solution that we use is that<br/>
I write it on a piece of paper and stick it in their pocket. I&#39;m not sure if<br/>
Alyssa (8) every learned our last number.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I don&#39;t really think of it as a big deal if a kid doesn&#39;t know<br/>
their phone number.<br/>

brain, hearing 4 numbers and expecting 7.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m pretty sure when I first met my husband in college, that people only<br/>
needed 4 digits to dial in town here. Then it moved up to the standard 7<br/>
even though people only told each other 4. But within the past year with all<br/>
the faxes and business lines and so forth, we have two exchanges and not<br/>
only that but we need to dial the area code even to call in town.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1976895060">I grew up with the old hard wired phones and when the<br/>
phone company converted so that you could buy your own<br/>
phone  we had to drive 150 miles to get a new phone<br/>
because where we lived didn&#39;t have any.   That must<br/>
have been in the late 70&#39;s or early 80&#39;s  but it was a<br/>
big deal because we got a white phone  instead of<br/>
black.  I remember being frightened that my finger<br/>
would get stuck in the dial and would get hurt.  (yes<br/>
i thought i would go down the drain too)    Anyway I<br/>
used to babysit at this house where everything was<br/>
antique.   They had the phone that was a box on the<br/>
wall and the ear piece had a wire  but you had to talk<br/>
to the wall.   Well for the first few times I babysat<br/>
I never could find the phone because I didn&#39;t even<br/>
know it was a phone.  I finally found how to answer<br/>
it.<br/>
Where I live we always had to use all 10 digits <br/>
atleast as long as I used the phone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is our issue. My poor kids have had to learn about 10-15 different<br/>
numbers and addresses. Here we don&#39;t have an address as there are no proper<br/>
street names and buildings are not numbered. Mail only goes to PO boxes at<br/>
your work. So when you go somewhere and have to tell drivers you ask for<br/>
specific buildings or places that are next to it. So for instance our<br/>
doctor is on electra street near mafreq bank. But the street is actually<br/>
now called Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Bin..... but no one knows that name and<br/>
still uses electra street because the first building (long since torn down)<br/>
was called the electrical building. It can be extremely confusing when you<br/>
first get here or for tourists but somehow you kind of get into the swing<br/>
of it.<br/>

and both are phonographs from different manufacturers (gramophone from<br/>
Edison, Victrola from the Victor Talking Machine company).  I *think* the<br/>
gramophone used wax cylinders and the Victrola flat records, but the<br/>
gramophone might have advanced to models that played flat records, and the<br/>
Victrola may have started with cylinders.  I haven&#39;t got ALL day to read<br/>
about them &lt;g&gt;<br/>
