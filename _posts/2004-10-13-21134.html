Millie&#39;s Math House and Sammie&#39;s Science House if they still make them. (If<br/>

<br/>
At that age I think my son liked Putt Putt Joins the Parade and Putt Putt Saves the Zoo.  The games are puzzles, but don&#39;t aggresively push any educational content.  (A plus, from my POV.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564493820">PuttPutt, Freddie Fish, Scooby-Doo, I Spy, some WInnie the Pooh games (but not as much as the other one&#39;s I&#39;ve mentioned). She didn&#39;t like Arthur or the one Magic School Bus (solar system) that we tried.  We have an IBM, so I don&#39;t know whether those come for Mac or not. <br/>

  I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for software for a 4 <br/>
  yr. old - we have Reader Rabbit, but not much else.  He has played <br/>
  Curious George at the library and liked that quite a bit but I&#39;d like <br/>
  to buy him something that he doesn&#39;t have access to from the library.  <br/>
  Any suggestions?  Thanks so much,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764632112">Pat and Sarah really loved &quot;Infinity City&quot; which is very mathy fun. (As a <br/>
matter of fact, they recently (age 12) asked me to make sure I get it back from <br/>
the folks we loaned it to)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen it in stores for awhile, but I found it online here <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.kidsclick.com/descrip/infinity_city.htm">http://www.kidsclick.com/descrip/infinity_city.htm</a><br/>
It might be available in bargain racks.<br/>
<br/>
They liked Putt Putt and all the Humongous titles so much that they&#39;re still <br/>
in our active racks. Reader Rabbit, Jumpstart and the like have long since <br/>
been given away or sold. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711481764">My 5 yo son loves Freddi Fish, the Disney Channel games online, especially Lilo and Stitch and the Tonka games.  His favorite games of all time are the Magic School bus games.  We have them all and he spends at least an hour a day playing them.  His favorite is Animals if you are looking for one to start with.<br/>

That was also popular here.  (At the 4-5 age, I think.)<br/>
