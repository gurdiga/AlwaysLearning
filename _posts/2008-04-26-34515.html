<div id="ygrps-yiv-2067378906">We&#39;re going to see Kirby, in Austin!  We&#39;re leaving in four hours.  I  <br/>
wish I were sleeping, but then again I&#39;m not driving, so I can sleep  <br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Holly is taking her laptop, but other than putting up pre-prepared  <br/>
lyrics game entries, I might not be online much or at all.<br/>
<br/>
If you send a post and don&#39;t see it, give it many hours or a day.  It  <br/>
might just be waiting for a moderator.<br/>
<br/>
We should be home last Tuesday.  If it looks like I&#39;m being accused  <br/>
of being a slacker or of ignoring people somewhere or other on the  <br/>
internet, please explain my absence.   Someday I will have a laptop,  <br/>
but today I don&#39;t.<br/>
