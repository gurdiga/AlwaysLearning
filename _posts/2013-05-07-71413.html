<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603842188">I just wanted to say that I got a chance to read Sandra Dodd&#39;s interview on Unschooling at Successful Homeschooling and it was very encouraging, thank you :)<br/>
I have been watching video clips and reading articles from many places and most have been helpful in our unschooling journey...it is finding the balance that seems to be my stumbling block...not just in this but in almost anything I ever need to make a decision on in life.  My personality seems to be one that is either doing things all the way to the right or all the way to the left and finding the middle is for some reason overwhelming.  I don&#39;t know if that makes sense or if anyone can relate, but it can cause such anxiety sometimes.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1055591001">We&#39;ve been unschooling for nearly 3 years now and the one thing I really wish I had done differently was to ease into it. I had a tendency to be all-or-nothing, and that way of doing things really created some struggles that I think could have been avoided if, instead of dropping all rules, we had simply started to say yes more while I continued to read here and get a better understanding of how to apply the principles of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Because of my all-or-nothing approach, we made too many big changes way too fast, and then had to come back toward the middle and find balance, which was very difficult for our whole family, but especially for my now 7 year old, who I think felt very confused and angry for quite some time, as she felt that her world was in turmoil.<br/>
<br/>
If I could give you any advice it would be to hear what Sandra means when she says, &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot; Small changes seem to lend themselves to the ability to find balance and harmony in family and life, without causing unnecessary pain. Big changes can make everyone feel off-balance and frightened.<br/>
