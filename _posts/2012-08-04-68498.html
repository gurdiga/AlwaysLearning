<div id="ygrps-yiv-1550234243">My daughter won&#39;t be 5 till March of next year, but for xmas hubby and I<br/>
would like to get her set up with her own computer, laptop, or tablet. My<br/>
son will be turning 3, so he will be able to use a computer mouse, so I&#39;d<br/>
like to have a set up where they both can play on the computer at the same<br/>
time without fighting. Right now we only have one computer, but I have an<br/>
Ipad, and hubby has two work tablets and a laptop.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Recommendations for if we should buy a computer or a laptop or a tablet?<br/>
Right now our current house is small, but we will be moving into a bigger<br/>
space in about 2.5 years (or as soon as I am up to a move after my third<br/>
baby comes). In our newer space, we will have a large shared office,  so we<br/>
would be able to handle multiple computers with large screens, etc. My hubby<br/>
is thinking we should buy my daughter an actual computer, but I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if that won&#39;t be too limiting. My daughter wants a LeapPad, but I think that<br/>
will be too limiting.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I guess I am just curious what people have found to work for getting their<br/>
kids set-up with computers. I want to be preventative as much as possible<br/>
here.<br/>

There are many advantages to buying her what she wants.<br/>
Maybe next year you could get her an iPad or something.  I read recently that there will be unbreakable screens in some upcoming version.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Has she played with other kids&#39; Leap Pads? We got one after my daughter played with a friend&#39;s and she loved it for a couple years. They have some nice advantages in that they&#39;re designed with little kids in mind - little people who aren&#39;t always gentle or squeaky clean ;)<br/>
<br/>
Just because she has a Leap Pad, that doesn&#39;t bar her from ever using other computers, too. Get a couple games for your regular computer. Maybe look into a used console system (Playstation, Wii...those kinds of things) and some games for little kids - there will be more two-player options available, too. <br/>
<br/>
It definitely helps to think about What people are going to be doing and then see which devices will support that activity. If it&#39;s read-aloud sorts of things, a Leap Pad is fantastic. If it&#39;s games you&#39;d do better with a system especially designed for games. If you have a kid who likes to write or draw on-screen, then a designated computer may be your best bet. But any of those have limitations. If nothing else, kids grow and their interests change. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re really unsure or in a money crunch, buy used and upgrade later. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080604962">In my experience, a desktop computer at that age is very limiting. We had desktop computers for our girls, but they were bouncing all over the place. Then we got them Leapster Explorers and they were in heaven. LeapPads may feel limiting to you, but there are lots of games on them, they&#39;re portable, she can curl up away from little brother, or by you, or in the car ... they&#39;re smaller, not really breakable. Our girls really enjoyed theirs. <br/>
<br/>
Our eight year old has passed hers down to her little brother and almost exclusively uses her laptop now but our 5 year old (almost 6) uses her Leapster still when we travel - she uses her laptop at home more. Laptops are bigger and more clunky for little ones to handle unless you get her a netbook type laptop, but she won&#39;t be able to watch dvds on that.<br/>
<br/>
I find it funny that I can contribute to a thread like this since when my oldest was born I was not going to allow electronics. What a difference.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693620086">Thanks  everyone! I spent all day yesterday thinking about this and I think<br/>
I&#39;m going to propose to hubby that we get my almost 5 year old a leappad,<br/>
and my almost 3 year old something similar. I then think we should buy a<br/>
laptop, for computer games.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My daughter loves playing games on my computer, and she does so every<br/>
morning, and once my son is able to work a mouse, I have no doubt he will<br/>
want to join in on the fun &quot;all by himself.&quot; So I really think we need a<br/>
regular old computer of some sort, and I&#39;m liking the idea of a laptop we<br/>
can take on vacations with us, etc.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We have a PlayStation (bought it to stream Netflix a few years ago), so we<br/>
have a good gaming system already in place, I just need to solve the problem<br/>
of both kids wanting to play computer games in the morning at the same time,<br/>
with only one computer. And while I let them play on my Ipad, they prefer<br/>
the computer.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This has been helpful! I thought we&#39;d just buy one thing, but after reading<br/>
everyone suggestions, I think I will try to find the money to give them<br/>
multiple options  --especially since my husband and I enjoy our multiple<br/>
options ;-)<br/>

 We bought each of our four children a netbook when our youngest was only<br/>
just 3; they still had use of my laptop and a desktop and we also got a<br/>
separate DVD drive which they could all use.<br/>
<br/>
Emily (now 6) still mostly uses her netbook to watch iPlayer and play games<br/>
and occasionally watch DVDs - she&#39;s used it almost every day for three and<br/>
a half years so it was definitely worth getting. The older three use their<br/>
netbooks sometimes but prefer more powerful computers now with larger<br/>
screens. You can&#39;t play Minecraft on a Netbook!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1482907579">we bought our 7 year old a kurio 7 which is android based. it was his <br/>
request to buy a tablet for his birthday so he paid for half.<br/>
<br/>
we really like the kurio as it comes with a parental area so you can <br/>
determine setting, wifi access, etc. we put accounts for each of our <br/>
kids on it so baby girl (2) doesn&#39;t have the same things as eldest (7). <br/>
it has a bumper that comes with it.<br/>
<br/>
what we loved the most was it comes preloaded with educational content, <br/>
games, books, and a wifi accessible cartoon section that made it so <br/>
easy, otherwise we would have had to search and find all the apps, and <br/>
honestly I wouldn&#39;t have picked all that is on there, but my kids love <br/>
some of the ones I wouldn&#39;t have picked. =)<br/>

they have a good deal to buy them at toys-r-us.<br/>

Don&#39;t do it as Christmas gifts, then.<br/>
<br/>
Get her what she wants without undermining or sabotaging her joy.  After a while (weeks, months, a year) then get her a Kindle or iPad or something (maybe the new Google tablet) but don&#39;t wait for a birthday or Christmas.  Do it as an educational expense, sometime when she seems to need something new and exciting.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to buy us school supplies for Christmas gifts.  I liked those things, and was glad to have them, but I wish she had bought them when we needed them, middle of any old week, instead of it being &quot;a Christmas thing.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Not all unschooling parents can afford a computer for each child, nor even a Leap Pad.  Those who can, though, should (in my opinion) not hold out. :-)<br/>

Maybe you should buy her the Leap Pad now, and then see in December whether she might be ready for a tablet computer.<br/>

No, I didn&#39;t. I was very supportive of the idea. In fact, I was surprised<br/>

up with the money, and I don&#39;t think I would be as willing to unschool if I<br/>
didn&#39;t know I had a large budget to work with. I love being able to get<br/>
memberships to museums and arboretums and things without it impacted my<br/>
budget. My kids have no idea these regular activities cost big bucks, and I<br/>
get teary eyed sometimes when we can invite friends along for free.  We are<br/>
very fortunate, and my hubby works very hard to give us more than enough.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That might be a good idea. My daughter was going through a phrase, however,<br/>
where she just wanted me to buy her everything under the sun. I&#39;ve been<br/>
trying to curb this  back, some, getting her to use her money for certain<br/>
things (gum balls out of those machines at the grocery store)..I&#39;d like<br/>
personalized big items  she is requesting to be holiday or bday presents,<br/>
while more general things (a tablet or computer), to be regular educational<br/>
expenses.<br/>

Keep in mind you can buy really good desktop computers for very very little on craigslist!!!<br/>
I have seen awesome ones for around $100!!!<br/>

I am always looking because we plan to build a gaming one , my son and I.<br/>

But for your regular gaming  there very cheap options. You could get her a leap pad and a cheap computer!<br/>

Oh and the other day there was an awesome laptop for $300 at Office Depot sale that I would have taken if I could for my daughter. <br/>

Centuries ago, some northwestern Europeans (maybe others, too, but that&#39;s what I&#39;ve paid attention to) had livestock below and people above.  It helped with heat, in really cold places.  It probably didn&#39;t help with smell.    But GLASS! If only they&#39;d had big sheets of glass. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t have had the same house-warming and livestock-warming effect, though, as having them stacked up. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630426637">Oh gosh Sandra. I am going to tell Gigi that!. We had , two winter ago, three baby calves in our basement. It was fun having them there!!! They bellowed in the morning and evening waiting for their milk and that was so cute! <br/>
<br/>
The barn in the winter is a lot warmer because the cows are in. They run hot those girls. We had barn cats that used to sleep on top of cows to keep warm. Dairy cows love temperatures between 30 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit.<br/>

rooms, maybe) all in a big square with a courtyard in the middle - with a<br/>
little creek that ran under the house, up in the courtyard and back under<br/>
the house. They had a lot of fruit trees in the courtyard. Some rooms of<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-717549860">Our girls each have macminis, I like it because the box is small, and I can<br/>
keep it off of an area that may get spilled & they are virus-free. We got<br/>
the mini&#39;s for about $250 used on ebay. We have gone through keyboards<br/>
faster than adults do, mice seem to last longer.<br/>
<br/>
We travel a LOT, so we need to have something for the car. I really like<br/>
the look of that nabi 2, but we have leappads (4 and 6 years old) they<br/>
really love them. Though we have been though 2 for one of our girls, for<br/>
some reason one just stopped working so leapfrog replaced it, and she chews<br/>
on things so the stylus broke on the other, and when it did she still used<br/>
it on the screen (metal was showing) and scratched the screen so it no<br/>
longer works correctly. I am going to try to replace the screen with the<br/>
old one. But the games seem to be stimulating enough, the only aspects I<br/>
really don&#39;t like is that it advertises to the kids so then they want more<br/>
games, and the computer interface for uploading their work is slow, and the<br/>
batteries aren&#39;t rechargable (yes I should buy rechargable batteries).<br/>
