&gt; I don&#39;t like the time out recommendation.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not an unschooling page...or even, I think, necessarily about <br/>
anti-spanking....it&#39;s a page for parents who either have been or believe they <br/>
are in danger of being child abusers.  Mostly they are targeting parents who <br/>
aren&#39;t even up to Parenting 101... it&#39;s pretty remedial. From that <br/>
perspective, it&#39;s probably useful. <br/>
<br/>
I think you could include it with an explanation of that. Time Out sucks, but <br/>
it VASTLY beats the risk of battering. <br/>
<br/>
The question is, are you likely to get people who are at risk of battering <br/>
their children looking for links. Probably not if they&#39;re coming from an <br/>
Unschooling page....but you never know.<br/>
