&lt;&lt; ~Nancy~ Who is having a hard time reconciling these new ideas with her <br/>
 patriotism and being a Republican. Not to say that Democrats are <br/>
unpatriotic, <br/>
 and not to say I am ready to shed my GOP affiliation just yet either. &lt;veg&gt; <br/>

join me on the &quot;I don&#39;t know what the h*** political party to support <br/>
anymore&quot; one!! LOL<br/>
I think I&#39;m only Republican in that I agree with less government (not that <br/>
they truly believe that) but I lean somewhat to Libertarian (just not enough) <br/>
too.<br/>
I&#39;m somewhere in the seeking process and at this point am too cynical to <br/>
support any political party right now. I like a LOT about the green party, <br/>
but like I said, too cynical right now. :)<br/>
sigh......and so it goes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think we must be twins separated at birth! &lt;g&gt; Less government is probably <br/>
the only reason I stay with the GOP too, although, like you I have absolutely <br/>
no clue where else to go. I&#39;m not a big Dem fan, I don&#39;t know beans about the <br/>
Libertarians... Maybe I will try being independent for a while. The thing is, <br/>
I&#39;m not apolitical. I have very firm beliefs about certain things. It just <br/>
seems no one stands for them all in one party.<br/>
