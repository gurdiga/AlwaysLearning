<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816887556">Lukas plays with guns(toy guns of course) My older neighbor said to me<br/>
one day....I let him play with them? I said sure,why? She said:well,<br/>
with all the violence out there going on. I didn&#39;t have a good<br/>
answer...still don&#39;t...I only said that i think there are more factors<br/>
involved then just playing with guns. My other neighbor said she<br/>
doesn&#39;t allow her son to play with toy guns either.<br/>
I need more info and your opinions on this subject,please.<br/>
I am finding people quite opposed to &quot;letting&quot; their children play<br/>
with toy guns. Why do they feel that is going to make a kid prone to<br/>
do something bad?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290384270">This is a subject that is near and dear to my heart but I don&#39;t have the<br/>
time to talk about it in the depth it deserves right now. I would point out,<br/>
though, that if playing with guns made you grow up to shoot people or do<br/>
violent things, we&#39;d ALL be dead because there was a time when no one ever<br/>
thought anything of it and every little boy in America had a toy Lone Ranger<br/>
revolver and that bb gun that the kid in Christmas Story wanted (my husband<br/>
can recite that little blurb about the Daisy rifle, LOL).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not playing with guns that makes you think it&#39;s okay to shoot people<br/>
because you got picked on at school or work.  Kids don&#39;t shoot up their<br/>
school because they got confused between a chicken finger and a real gun.<br/>
Kids shoot up their school because of deep disconnection from people around<br/>
them and a lack of coping skills.  They don&#39;t need anger management and gun<br/>
free zones, they need someone to really behave as if they give a rat&#39;s ass<br/>
about them and it wouldn&#39;t hurt if it started with their parents, because<br/>
you don&#39;t get a basis for that kind of connection from daycare or school or<br/>
Marilyn Manson (who also doesn&#39;t make kids shoot up their school, btw).  ; )<br/>
<br/>
Okay, sorry, I got on a rant there.  I got this list confused with my blog,<br/>
I suppose.  I will post some coherent comments in the morning when I have<br/>
more time.  =)<br/>

Girls too, had guns.  I had a Dale Evans outfit (Roy Rogers&#39; wife)  <br/>
with a fringy cowgirl skirt and shirt and holsters and all.<br/>

I&#39;ve never wanted a real gun.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a Man from U.N.C.L.E. gun. (Actually still do!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve shot real guns.<br/>
<br/>
I have no desire to shoot people with them. Or even animals.<br/>
<br/>
I think the biggest problem is that people see children as broken and  <br/>
evil. That the only reason that we&#39;re all not running amok is because  <br/>
someone squashed the evil in us by making us go through the motions  <br/>
of being good (no candy, no guns, no TV) until it was so ingrained  <br/>
and we were old enough to tell ourselves to stop with the evil  <br/>
thoughts that we wouldn&#39;t slip back.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very comforting to think that we can prevent our children from  <br/>
becoming murderers by never letting them play with a plastic gun. But  <br/>
it also shows that they haven&#39;t really thought about it much. It&#39;s  <br/>
just too darn comforting to grasp an idea like that and implement it,  <br/>
even be blind to evidence to the contrary (telling ourselves that  <br/>
there are just too many complicating factors that only experts could  <br/>
understand).<br/>
<br/>
Do they really think the *only* difference between a gang member and  <br/>
their own child is because the people in ghettos allow their kids to  <br/>
play with toy guns?<br/>
<br/>
And how *do* they explain adults who played with guns as kids and  <br/>
never shot anyone?<br/>
<br/>
The people who are the *least* likely to beat you up are the people  <br/>
who could mash you to a pulp. Just ask anyone with a black belt ;-)  <br/>
When you have the confidence that you&#39;re powerful, there&#39;s no reason  <br/>
to go around proving it.<br/>
<br/>
Powerlessness is what causes people to shoot others, not guns. (And  <br/>
using ones power to prevent kids from playing with guns is pretty  <br/>
disempowering! Or gives them the opportunity to learn to be sneaky.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537095671">When our son was born we decided that he would not have any toy guns as we wanted him to learn respect for real guns - not because we were afraid he would grow up to do something awful on purpose with a real gun.  As he grew we showed him what a real gun would do - no we did not shoot people nor animals. ;)   We shot various types of guns we owned at fruit and various other things on our property to demonstrate the power of a gun and why it was not to be played with.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short - he was obsessed with guns - and obtaining a toy one - LOL - he made them out of sticks, legos, fingers, etc.<br/>
We soon figured out that there really was no stopping the fascination so we chose to ditch the &quot;rule&quot;   He is 13 now and still fascinated with guns and various types of weapons - he knows all types of weapons and war history as well as strategy from the beginning of time to present.<br/>
<br/>
Connection: a couple of days ago he was watching a show about the Moghuls in India and how they invented a rocket that tumbled - then when the British took over India they acquired the knowledge and then used it against us in the Revolutionary War.  AND those are the rockets that Francis Scott Key wrote about the &quot;Rocket&#39;s Red Glare&quot; in the Star Spangled Banner.  So Zachariah finished the show and then literally ran upstairs to put on his CD of the song to listen to it.<br/>
<br/>
He has a full arsenal of toy guns and weapons.  Right now he is into making wooden swords based upon historical records and imaginary from his Manga books.  He has also made a few wooden guns.   He has an air soft gun and a BB gun.  We found that the air soft gun seemed to be more dangerous because it tended to ricochet off of even a cardboard box.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and his latest acquisition is a small machette - from the camping department - he wanted to wack weeds on one of our lots.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807839998">I think forbidding toy guns is another instance of superstitious  <br/>
magic practiced unwittingly by parents.<br/>
<br/>
The idea that one can make a sacrifice to assure future success is  <br/>
ancient among humans, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
Deprivation doesn&#39;t create appreciation.  It creates some or all of  <br/>
desire, neediness, curiosity, fascination, resentment, obsession,  <br/>
anger...<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the real sacrifice parents make too often is their  <br/>
child&#39;s happiness and their own hope of a full and healthy  <br/>
relationship with that chid and future adult.<br/>

I am finding people quite opposed to &quot;letting&quot; their children play<br/>
with toy guns. Why do they feel that is going to make a kid prone to<br/>
do something bad?<br/>
<br/>
*****<br/>
My Mom was one who never allowed my brother to play with guns -- toy <br/>
or real. We lived in the country until he was 10, and every other boy <br/>
he knew had a pellet gun.  By high school, my brother&#39;s life dream <br/>
was to be a Marine Recon Ranger (he ultimately got 4-F&#39;d) and he <br/>
could field-strip and reassemble a M-I in under a minute.  As an <br/>
adult, he keeps a gun in the house and shoots at a target range, but <br/>
has never shot anyone.  <br/>
<br/>
When oldest son was young, I &#39;allowed&#39; gunplay.  He had nerf guns, <br/>
noisy machine guns, a paintball gun at 15, and spent two years of <br/>
high school in ROTC.  He, too, announced his desire to become a <br/>
Marine.  At 16, he quit all that, and explained that while he still <br/>
enjoys target practice with real guns, he doesn&#39;t believe he could <br/>
ever kill another human being. <br/>
<br/>
Both my son and brother are decent human beings, with no violent <br/>
tendencies.  My son does seem a gentler soul than my brother -- or <br/>
maybe just less battered by life, so less angry.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe kids are smarter than many adults give them credit for. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;. I know mine are.  As unschoolers, we know our kids are bright <br/>
enough to figure out there&#39;s a difference between real violence and <br/>
game playing.  I&#39;d bet that as free children living more autonomous <br/>
lives, they understand that you don&#39;t have to have a gun to be <br/>
violent towards someone else.  That violence isn&#39;t about guns <br/>
(they&#39;re just tools, after all) -- violence is about power and <br/>
control over other people. My instincts tell me that people who have <br/>
been controlled, limited or denied by other (more powerful) people <br/>
are more likely to be violent, than those who have been respected and <br/>
supported in pursuit of their own lives. <br/>

I&#39;ve made a page from this question, and am willing to expand it over the months and years.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you remember any particularly good toy gun discussions or responses or quotes, I <br/>
can add those (or links), and if anyone wants to send a photo of a child playing or in costume <br/>
or whatever, I&#39;ll consider adding those too.<br/>
<br/>
I put in a few outside links, for a bit of balance (and some of those reading here might not <br/>
have read any recent anti-toy-gun arguments), so if anyone here has a good one of those, <br/>
send that to me too.  I wouldn&#39;t mind having two or three more.<br/>
