<div id="ygrps-yiv-190840766"><html><font FACE="arial,helvetica"><font COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="2" FAMILY="SANSSERIF" FACE="Century Gothic">Just wanted to add my thoughts to this. . . I have the same kind of issues with Quinton who is 2. . . I get the same really uncomfortableness when I am on my cycles and he nurses. Usually its at night, and sometimes he will go with his Papa if I ask him, albeit a bit grudgingly. When my cycle stops, it is fine again, and we are back to both enjoying nursing. If we can try to get more food in him on those days it helps a lot. I have the low shelf for him and he usually gets what he wants snack wise. He has even gone into the fridge to fix himself some chocolate milk when we didnt hear his request. After he spilled on the floor he came and asked us for a napkin. :)

<br>On the tantrum thing. . . &lt;sigh&gt;. Today it was just he and I gone Christmas shopping, something I am usually not crazy about doing alone with him, because of the frequent meltdowns when he doesn&#39;t get exactly what he wants exactly when he wants it. Right before we went into the mall I bent down with him and asked him if he could listen when I called him and not run away from me. I told him that it would really be nice if we could do all those things and we could stay longer if he could help me out with that. He smiled and said okay, I can do that. And he was absolutely wonderful. . . we stayed out almost all day, had a great time together, came home, he nursed and is now asleep. And now I am reading some suggestions about tantrums that I happened to have implemented today and am so happy to say they worked great!! I get so frustrated sometimes because he is sooooooooo different from Lelia . . . who was just so agreeable about everything at that age. I have had a hard time having enough patience. . . I suspect that is the gift he brings to me. . . the opportunity to have more patience. 
<br>
<br>One other thing is I want to say how pleased I am to be on this list. It &quot;feels&quot; really good. It feels like people here are really committed to unschooling and I am so looking forward to sharing and learning with all of you.
