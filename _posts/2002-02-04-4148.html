<div id="ygrps-yiv-194782979">A good friend of mine....<br/>
<br/>
she has a 5 year old, Kinder.  She would love<br/>
to homeschool but both she and her husband<br/>
MUST work.  They have asked us to watch the<br/>
child after Kindergarden.  We have said no,<br/>
because it would interfer with Mark and the<br/>
girls going to park day, etc.  However, we<br/>
said we would take her 2 days a week, on the<br/>
days that there are generally no activities<br/>
with homeschooling groups or with Mark&#39;s stay<br/>
at home dad group.  It&#39;ll be good for both<br/>
girls to have a regular playmate.  And I feel<br/>
bad for the child, who goes to this kids club<br/>
after school, which is basically glorified<br/>
baby sitting in a large very large group<br/>
environment.  When I picked the child up the<br/>
other day she was sitting with a bunch of<br/>
other K-1st graders zoning at tv.   the<br/>
employees are all high school or college age<br/>
students who get paid, I&#39;m sure, min wage. I<br/>
walked in, found Clarissa, walked across 4<br/>
large rooms to where they store the<br/>
backpacks, got her back pack and then walked<br/>
across four rooms again to the exit.  No one<br/>
once asked me who I was or if I had the right<br/>
to pick up this child.  Anyway... We&#39;ll take<br/>
her 2 times a week, it&#39;ll be good for all the<br/>
kids, and I&#39;ll pick her up each day on my way<br/>
home (it is right on my way home).  But<br/>
anyway, I almost wanted to scream at the<br/>
mom.  She said she can&#39;t afford a better<br/>
after school place for her child, because the<br/>
really good ones cost $400 or more a month,<br/>
and this one is only $120 a month.  Yesterday<br/>
we drove with the girl scouts to snow in<br/>
Palmsprings (that was fun!) in her brand new,<br/>
$650 a month, leather seat, drop down tv/vcr<br/>
combo, automatic everything, two sliding<br/>
door, bigger engine van.   some people just<br/>
don&#39;t get it.<br/>
<br/>
ok vent over.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123602049">I picked up a friend&#39;s child from daycare a couple of times.  I WISH they had <br/>
had a TV.  Kids had NOTHING good to play with.  They were sitting around, <br/>
talking to each other, sadly.<br/>
<br/>
They did make me enter the last four digits of my phone number into a little <br/>
checker-thing, which had to match what the dad had entered when he left her <br/>
that morning.  <br/>
<br/>
Kids weren&#39;t allowed to bring their own toys.<br/>
<br/>
The place was quiet.  Lots of kids, and it&#39;s *quiet.*<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe I only went at naptime.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>kids shouldn&#39;t be quiet.  At least not that<br/>
many kids.  This place had many rooms.  The<br/>
big room had a bunch of table top games,<br/>
foozeball, etc.  And a lot of older kids,<br/>
like late elementary and jr high age.  It was<br/>
very noisy.  I don&#39;t mind picking this child<br/>
up and having her around.  I think it&#39;s sad<br/>
that so many kids have substandard day care<br/>
like this though.  It is also amusing that<br/>
when this child first started going there,<br/>
this mom said that Lexie could go in the<br/>
afternoons for a few hours too!  She talked<br/>
about how wonderful it was.  Now she has<br/>
realized not only that the place is not<br/>
wonderful and that she wants her child out of<br/>
there, but that we would never in a million<br/>
years have our children go there.<br/>

three afternoons? Might be more comfortable.<br/>
