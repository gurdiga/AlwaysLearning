<div id="ygrps-yiv-91140298">My 9 year old son has been bragging about accomplishments that aren&#39;t true. There is also a lot of sel-promoting going on. We are deschooling so maybe he is just shedding or working through some self -esteem issues developed under the school experience and our previously rigid existence. A while back -months ago - a friend of his was in the car and the topic of motorcycles came up.  My son said yeah our motorcycle is not working right now right mom?  I didn&#39;t respond- thankfully the baby started fussing so I acted like I didn&#39;t hear. Later, I tried to bring it up to discuss lying and involving other to lie for him.  He denied saying anything.  With unschooling and some of the threads I have read, I have not challenged him again though he continues to brag and exaggerate and sometimes outright lie.  He has not once attempted to involve me in the lie again. <br/>
<br/>
My question is how should I handle this?  I liked the poop in the lemonade analogy Sandra suggested once but my gut tells me any diect discussion will only shut him down. I would like to help him not have a need to do this -ultimately it seems to be reflective of low self-esteem. It is affecting his credibility with friends, family and online peers.  Thank you in advance. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1302542404">Sounds like you read the string where I asked similar questions about my 10 year old son. Interestingly, since then my son has decreased this on his own.  In fact I can&#39;t remember the last time I said &quot;really??&quot; with a raised eyebrow (to him anyway).<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t really make it a point to talk to him other than when he would get mad at me for questioning the validity of a statement, I would talk to him about credibility (I think I tried the lemonade analogy but totally messed it up, we had a pretty good laugh over that one ;&gt;), and how telling one untruth could easily make people assume that he never tells the truth.  <br/>
<br/>
It may depend on your relationship with your son how easy it is for you to have these kinds of discussions.  If he shuts down it&#39;s probably not worth harming your relationship with him right now.  Maybe you could find a way to casually bring up an example of someone else that made a false statement to you and now you&#39;re not sure if anything he tells you is true, and you could add, &quot;what do you think?  Do you think I should believe him?&quot;.  Of course this could turn in unexpected ways, but the seed will have been planted. <br/>
<br/>
I do think knowing that others had a similar experience was enough to help me relax a little. I frankly think it&#39;s a 9/10 year old boy thing - they are just trying to establish their place in the big old world.  <br/>
<br/>
Also my son does hang around with two kids that are &quot;schooled&quot;, one traditionally and the other homeschooled (school at home).  Both parented in a very &quot;traditional&quot; way. <br/>
<br/>
I overheard many a conversation where these boys were one upping my son at every turn.  It pained me and I usually talked about it to my son after the fact (and amazingly he never did the one upmanship thing).  But I&#39;m sure this may have influenced my son&#39;s need to appear to have all the answers. If your son was in school I bet this influence is even stronger with him, so you may need to give him a little slack - it make take a little while for him to realize he doesn&#39;t have to prove himself all the time.   <br/>
<br/>
Good luck and try to talk to him about it without too much judgement.  My son will always let me know when I&#39;m crossing that line ;&gt;<br/>
