<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685279208">We had a Nojo Sling when mine were little that worked<br/>
well for us.  It was denim with a stuffed flannel edge<br/>
(softer for baby&#39;s sticky-out parts like legs and<br/>
head) so I liked the look of it.  It was pretty easy<br/>
to adjust, because my husband and I are totally<br/>
different shapes and sizes and we had to adjust it a<br/>
lot back and forth.<br/>
