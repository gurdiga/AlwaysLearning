  Nanci I think you handled that situation very competently, IMHO it would take an almost-saint to do any better. So in this case I doubt bringing out the label would be helpful. The woman at the cinema sounds like perhaps some label would fit her- perhaps &quot;borderline personality disorder&quot;? (I&#39;m not trying to make a diagnosis here, just illustrating how we all have traits that when viewed in a certain context, could lead to a diagnosis by an overzealous doctor or therapist, lol!)<br/>
  Imagine this woman announcing first to every customer &quot;I have *****&quot;(not a very likely scenario) Would it be helpful? I have my doubts. If someone chooses a job that involves dealing with a lot of people they should at least bring a &quot;service heart&quot; or so it seems to me. Then, if they have a minor slip in etiquette now and then it is likely to be forgiven by all but the most rigid of customers.<br/>
  (To clarify: I don&#39;t think this woman was having a minor slip, I think she was forgetting what she was there for, and also her manager may have taught her some bad habits with regard to that.)<br/>
  IMO good manners are a means, not a goal in itself. The goal is to help people interact and communicate more smoothly. The moment that function is no longer being fulfilled, they need to be dropped in favor of plain, straight-shooting communication.<br/>
  You didn&#39;t get rude. You didn&#39;t start attacking the woman personally. You just tried to communicate plainly where that was in order. If the other wasn&#39;t listening, that&#39;s not your problem.<br/>
  I love the way people with autistic traits often say what they mean and mean what they say- I think there is something for all of humanity to learn from it regarding honesty, sense of humor and sense of life. Nurturing the &quot;Inner Court Jester&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
I would tend to automatically agree with this too Nanci, if it weren&#39;t for<br/>
the many times I&#39;ve seen dh and ds in scenarios where they see themselves as<br/>
being really reasonable, and explain it as such, yet from my being there and<br/>
seeing the scenario unfold with the other person just becoming incensed, I<br/>
can see that dh and/or ds are behaving in a way that is seen as very rude,<br/>
even though they are just &quot;being logical&quot; or &quot;being honest&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So the way you describe it does sound like you were reasonable and the<br/>
ticket taker was off her rocker. And that certainly may be the case. But I<br/>
also wonder if there might have been more nuanced things going on that you<br/>
missed.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen people who are typically very courteous get very mad at dh. And he<br/>
needs a debriefing to see where the breakdown happened.<br/>
<br/>
Just another thought :o)<br/>

THIS is what I was talking about - doesn&#39;t it seem FAR more accurate  <br/>

I suppose some of you might think this is splitting hairs - but it  <br/>
seems like a very significant difference to me. The first statement  <br/>
sounds like autistic traits are among the many traits that person  <br/>
has, but the second sounds like it defines the entire person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430014624">Because I&#39;ve spent most of my adult life working with people who have various exceptionalities, both in and out of schools, the whole &quot;person first&quot; thing is second-nature to me. I cringe when I hear people referred to as &quot;the autistic kid&quot; or worse, &quot;the autistic&quot;. I&#39;m not sure traits is always accurate, because it implies that the person doesn&#39;t have all of the characteristics usually associated with a condition, although he has some - but &quot;person with autism&quot;  makes it clear that the person comes first, and autism doesn&#39;t define a person any more than does red hair or a penchant for mystery novels.<br/>

This isn&#39;t cool.<br/>
<br/>
Especially if there was a line at the ticket office, taking her word  <br/>
for it, giving her the amount of money she asked for and going on  <br/>
into the theatre would&#39;ve been better for all concerned.  If it  <br/>
seemed really wrong and you wanted more information you could have  <br/>
asked a manager inside.   To justify drawn out questions of a bottom- <br/>
rung employee while insulting that same employee has no place on this  <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>

The story sounded to me more like an attempt at long analysis of some  <br/>
little policy that isn&#39;t worth arguing about.<br/>
There are times and places to interrogate employees and at the ticket  <br/>
office in January probably isn&#39;t the best time.<br/>

might be &quot;a person who used a wheelchair&quot; instead of a &quot;wheelchair <br/>
bound person&quot;, or an &quot;individual dealing with bipolar disorder&quot; <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t say it (what you said), but I do have those traits.<br/>
When I was in school I was gifted instead of hyperactive because I  <br/>
got good grades.  Had I acted JUST as I did and gotten bad grades, I  <br/>
would have been hyperactive.  As it was, they just said I was bored  <br/>
because the classwork was too easy.  If I&#39;d been getting bad grades,  <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have said bored, they would have said I was  <br/>
undisciplined, lazy, inattentive, uncooperative.  I was all those  <br/>
things but I was able to pull an A in a short sprint of filling in  <br/>
forms or tossing off an essay at the last minute.<br/>
<br/>
I had other friends who could have done that--spent five minutes of  <br/>
each classtime doing A work--but at some point they had become so  <br/>
resentful of teachers and of school that they just refused to  <br/>
cooperate.  Sometimes they would make their point by asking the  <br/>
teacher a difficult question about the lesson, giving her a withering  <br/>
look if her answer was lame, looking away dramatically, and not  <br/>
turning in the assignment.   That was some impressive passive  <br/>
resistence. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should add that to my list of things that made me confident  <br/>
about unschooling.  Most of us (&quot;us&quot; being the curious and talkative  <br/>
musician-kids I hung out with) learned the really good things we knew  <br/>
outside of school anyway.  The reason we could ask such probing  <br/>
questions was that by the time we got the geography or history lesson  <br/>
the school was doling out, we already knew something of the place and  <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
So with the removal of ALL of that schedule/school/textbook/grade- <br/>
level monstrosity from the horizon, it doesn&#39;t matter if my kids (or  <br/>
any of yours) learn quickly or slowly, or if they avoid a subject or  <br/>
they&#39;re &quot;behind&quot; or &quot;ahead,&quot; because without &quot;subjects&quot; and  <br/>
deadlines, they&#39;re learning right now the same way they will learn  <br/>
when they&#39;re 30 and 50.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re already living lives of learning, and learning life.<br/>
