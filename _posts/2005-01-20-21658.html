Lost art of penmanship<br/>
By Natalie Troyer<br/>
THE WASHINGTON  TIMES<br/>
Published January 18,  2005<br/>
<br/>
----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
----<br/>
Like  8-track tapes, Atari video games and the rotary-dial phone, cursive<br/>
writing  may soon become a casualty of technological advance, as the word<br/>
processor  squeezes penmanship lessons from schools nationwide.<br/>
Learning  the loops of cursive writing might seem like a waste of time to<br/>
students and  teachers who are accustomed to the computer as the principal<br/>
tool of  communication. The National Cursive Handwriting Test -- a<br/>
75-year-old  tradition -- recently was canceled because of a lack of entries.<br/>
But  educators say cursive writing is a communication tool that deserves to<br/>
be  upheld in elementary schools today.<br/>
Students still need to know  how to communicate effectively through good<br/>
handwriting skills, said Charles  B. Pyle, director of communication at the<br/>
Virginia State Department of  Education.<br/>
&quot;There will still be occasions when students need to  express themselves<br/>
with pen and paper, and what they write should be read and  understood<br/>
without a lot of difficulty,&quot; he said.<br/>
Both  Maryland and Virginia&#39;s state curriculum for elementary schools<br/>
indicate  that, by second grade, students should begin making the transition<br/>
to cursive  writing, using connecting strokes to write continuous text. By<br/>
third grade,  students are expected to write legibly in cursive, moving from<br/>
the  instruction level in the classroom to a more independent level.<br/>
&quot;The long-term goal is to develop neat, legible and rapid handwriting,&quot;<br/>
Mr.  Pyle said. &quot;Our standards don&#39;t emphasize a method, but expect  an<br/>
outcome.&quot;<br/>
Advocates say teaching penmanship has benefits,  citing research evidence<br/>
of a direct link between the process of learning to  write and developing the<br/>
ability to read fluently.<br/>
&quot;Cursive  writing itself was developed because connected strokes help<br/>
create a  continuous stream of writing,&quot; said Dixie Stack, director of<br/>
curriculum at  Maryland State Department of Education. &quot;When you first look<br/>
at cursive  writing, it&#39;s like trying to interpret a foreign language.<br/>
Working at it --  and practicing it yourself -- though, helps you to read<br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
Roger Vanderhye, principal of Spring Hill Elementary School in McLean,<br/>
said  cursive writing is &quot;not a lost art quite yet.&quot;<br/>
&quot;We still  believe that fluid writing leads itself to thinking ... we&#39;ve<br/>
seen that  students&#39; ideas start to flow better when they learn cursive,&quot;  he<br/>
said.<br/>
Heidi Hogan, reading and writing specialist at  Spring Hill, agrees.<br/>
&quot;Keyboarding hasn&#39;t replaced cursive,&quot;  Mrs. Hogan said. &quot;Even with<br/>
technological developments, we still feel it&#39;s  important for students to<br/>
know how to write. Most children actually enjoy  cursive ... they see it as a<br/>
rite of passage or a &#39;grown-up thing to do.&#39;  &quot;<br/>
The process also helps students who have problems with  reversed letters<br/>
in their handwriting.<br/>
&quot;Once students make  the transition to cursive, they don&#39;t make the same<br/>
kind of mistakes,&quot; Mrs.  Hogan said.<br/>
Some say reliance on computers is hurting the art  of penmanship,<br/>
however. According to the National Telecommunications and  Information<br/>
Administration, 90 percent of Americans children ages 5 to 17 use  computers.<br/>
Charles Trafford, chief executive of Peterson  Directed Handwriting, a<br/>
Pennsylvania-based instruction company that sponsored  the recently canceled<br/>
cursive writing contest, said he was appalled by the  quality of entries that<br/>
he received from teachers across the country who felt  the entries were<br/>
examples of good handwriting.<br/>
&quot;We had  thousands of teachers sending in handwriting samples that could<br/>
only be  described as garbage,&quot; he said. &quot;They were just terrible.&quot;<br/>
Teacher-education programs might be one cause, instructors say,  because<br/>
minimal time is spent teaching cursive to future teachers.<br/>
&quot;There&#39;s just so much content to be taught to future educators  that<br/>
cursive writing is simply not emphasized in teacher education,&quot;  said<br/>
Patricia Young, assistant elementary-education professor at the  University<br/>
of Maryland.<br/>
More emphasis is placed on using the  computer as a tool to aid the<br/>
writing process, ultimately placing more  emphasis on what students are<br/>
writing, rather than how they are writing it,  Mrs. Young said.<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re simply evolving in terms of education  ... . We have a more<br/>
contemporary tool in computer technology, and we&#39;re  using that to develop a<br/>
child&#39;s writing.&quot;<br/>
Rosa Trapp-Dail,  chairman of the elementary-education department of<br/>
curriculum and instruction  at Howard University, said she doesn&#39;t want the<br/>
university students to be  overly dependent on technology, though.<br/>
&quot;Writing is one  of the ways you influence the acquisition of early<br/>
literary skills to  children,&quot; she said. &quot;Computers have begun to share<br/>
significance. But few  urban classrooms have computers for every student ...<br/>
penmanship is a  conceptual, hand-eye coordination skill, which also needs to<br/>
be a part of  learning.&quot;<br/>
Mrs. Young suggests that handwriting basics need to  be taught alongside<br/>
computer technology.<br/>
&quot;When students  submit an exam, it&#39;ll be handwritten,&quot; she said.<br/>
&quot;Penmanship and computer  skills, therefore, need to run side by side.&quot;<br/>
Even the SAT  college-admissions test still requires each student, at the<br/>
end of the test,  to copy several paragraphs stating that he or she did not<br/>
cheat.<br/>
Rather than simply signing a written statement, students are asked  to<br/>
write out the paragraphs so that the College Board -- which gives  the<br/>
test -- has a copy of the student&#39;s handwriting in case verification of  the<br/>
student&#39;s handwriting is needed later.<br/>
Some educators  say that the problem with teaching cursive writing today<br/>
is that it tends to  come behind other curriculum priorities, such as<br/>
preparation for standardized  tests. Others blame it on the American culture<br/>
as a whole.<br/>
&quot;We just don&#39;t emphasize the importance of handwriting as a  culture,&quot;<br/>
said Gail McEachron, a professor at the College of William &  Mary. &quot;In<br/>
England, there is a much bigger emphasis placed on penmanship ...  in India<br/>
and Great Britain, they don&#39;t have as much in technological uses, so  more<br/>
pride is taken in one&#39;s written work and how it is conveyed.&quot;<br/>
Although the future of cursive writing is not known, some say there  will<br/>
always be value in learning the old-fashioned art. James Beers, reading  and<br/>
language-arts professor at the College of William & Mary, said that  although<br/>
penmanship may be declining, it&#39;s not going to disappear.<br/>
&quot;Not all forms can be filled out online. Many must be done by hand,&quot;  Mr.<br/>
Beers said. &quot;And, even though more and more people are using e-mail  to<br/>
communicate with each other, there&#39;s still much value to the personal  letter<br/>
... and that will never go away.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>They could print.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;The long-term goal is to develop neat, legible and rapid handwriting,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>John Holt showed printing was faster.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; research evidence<br/>
&gt; of a direct link between the process of learning to  write and developing the<br/>
&gt; ability to read fluently.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter was writing well before she was reading fluently. But she<br/>
*chose* to write (because she had the freedom to choose).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;Cursive  writing itself was developed because connected strokes help<br/>
&gt; create a  continuous stream of writing,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because people were using dip pens at the time which work better the less<br/>
you lift the pen. Pencils and ballpoint (etc.) pens don&#39;t have the problem.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;When you first look<br/>

&gt; Working at it --  and practicing it yourself -- though, helps you to read<br/>
&gt; it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, yeah.<br/>
<br/>
And the more I read anything, the better I understand it. But do I *need*<br/>
it? And if I need it then I&#39;ll learn it. *If* I have the freedom to do that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;We still  believe that fluid writing leads itself to thinking ... we&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; seen that  students&#39; ideas start to flow better when they learn cursive,&quot;  he<br/>
&gt; said.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s his basis for this conclusion? Did they have control groups where<br/>
cursive wasn&#39;t taught?<br/>
<br/>
(And does it have anything to do with unschooled kids? Or only kids who are<br/>
made to write?)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Even with<br/>
&gt; technological developments, we still feel it&#39;s  important for students to<br/>
&gt; know how to write.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Cuz we&#39;re experts and that should be enough for you to accept what we feel<br/>
is important.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Most children actually enjoy  cursive ... they see it as a<br/>
&gt; rite of passage or a &#39;grown-up thing to do.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And the kids who don&#39;t enjoy it?<br/>
<br/>
So therefore anything that&#39;s seen as a rite of passage, even if it&#39;s not<br/>
enjoyed by all nor is actually useful for all, should be imposed on all?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The process also helps students who have problems with  reversed letters<br/>
&gt; in their handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So does givig them time.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s only important to keep them on track when there&#39;s a track that needs<br/>
followed. When there is no track, then there&#39;s no need for techniques that<br/>
would have kept them on the track.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Some say reliance on computers is hurting the art  of penmanship,<br/>
&gt; however.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And reliance on cars has &quot;hurt the art&quot; of carriage building and driving.<br/>
<br/>
And reliance on central heat has &quot;hurt the art&quot; of fire building.<br/>
<br/>
And reliance on refrigerators has &quot;hurt the art&quot; of home canning.<br/>
<br/>
No, all that&#39;s false. It&#39;s just that the art isn&#39;t as widely practiced or<br/>
mastered. Those who enjoy it are good at it and do it. (Assuming they have<br/>
the freedom to do so.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We had  thousands of teachers sending in handwriting samples that could<br/>
&gt; only be  described as garbage<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is sad when other people don&#39;t appreciate something we care a lot about.<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s even sadder to make people practice and pretend they care about<br/>
something they&#39;re increasingly finding less use for.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But few  urban classrooms have computers for every student ...<br/>
&gt; penmanship is a  conceptual, hand-eye coordination skill, which also needs to<br/>
&gt; be a part of  learning.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hey, video games are *great* for hand-eye coordination! And video game<br/>
systems are *lots* cheaper than computers. For the price of one computer you<br/>
could have an great set up of game systems and games. And for the price of<br/>
one computer lab you could have an awesome set up! :-)<br/>
<br/>
So because not all students have access to computers the ones that do should<br/>
not be dependent? So because not everyone can afford a car, every person<br/>
should make sure he can always travel by means that are affordable by all.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; When students  submit an exam, it&#39;ll be handwritten<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many colleges are experimenting with no paper. Homework and exams are all<br/>
done on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
Or is she saying because there are fewer reasons to handwrite that she&#39;ll<br/>
make sure she holds onto reasons even if better ways come along?<br/>
<br/>
But they could still print.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the arguments are confusing handwriting and cursive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Even the SAT  college-admissions test still requires each student, at the<br/>
&gt; end of the test,  to copy several paragraphs stating that he or she did not<br/>
&gt; cheat.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m betting it&#39;s not required to use cursive. In fact *most* forms ask for<br/>
printing.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Rather than simply signing a written statement, students are asked  to<br/>
&gt; write out the paragraphs so that the College Board -- which gives  the<br/>
&gt; test -- has a copy of the student&#39;s handwriting in case verification of  the<br/>
&gt; student&#39;s handwriting is needed later.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So it&#39;s like a fingerprint. It doesn&#39;t make any difference if it&#39;s readable<br/>
or not, just so that it can be compared to another sample of the student&#39;s<br/>
handwriting.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We just don&#39;t emphasize the importance of handwriting as a  culture<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Again sad when people don&#39;t like what we like. It&#39;s sad when parts of what<br/>
defined the past fade away because they aren&#39;t as useful anymore. There used<br/>
to be far more people who could plant a garden, sew clothes, cook from<br/>
scratch, butcher a hog, prime a pump, crank an engine ... The time spent<br/>
with those things is replaced with other more currently useful things. It&#39;s<br/>
a *lot* more useful to know how to search with Google than to crank an<br/>
engine! Or even write a legible paragraph in cursive.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; in India<br/>
&gt; and Great Britain, they don&#39;t have as much in technological uses, so  more<br/>
&gt; pride is taken in one&#39;s written work and how it is conveyed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And in India they can cook curry better than most people in America. And in<br/>
England most people will recognize the names of the kings and queens better<br/>
than most people in America. Different cultures have different needs.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Although the future of cursive writing is not known, some say there  will<br/>
&gt; always be value in learning the old-fashioned art<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Calligraphy is alive and well among those who love the art of it even though<br/>
most people don&#39;t even own dip pens!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;And, even though more and more people are using e-mail  to<br/>
&gt; communicate with each other, there&#39;s still much value to the personal  letter<br/>
&gt; ... and that will never go away.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s a whole lot more value in anything when it&#39;s a choice rather than<br/>
done because others want everyone to hold onto the past.<br/>

Holly was standing behind me the other night while I was playing a timed game <br/>
on the computer, and said &quot;Will you read this to me?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;When I&#39;m through.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Before my three-minute game was up, she said, &quot;Never mind, I can read it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I felt really bad, and turned and said, &quot;No, wait, I can help you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had thought it was some passage with lots of names or big words, but it was <br/>
two lines of my own cursive handwriting I had thrown onto the back of <br/>
something she was considering throwing away but didn&#39;t know whether the note was <br/>
important.  It hadn&#39;t been written carefully, just for my own use.  But she did <br/>
figure it out, and it wasn&#39;t important.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Right, but they said nothing about fountain pens.  The need for connected <br/>
strokes has been gone in the public schools since the ballpoint pen became cheap <br/>
and commonly available in the 1950&#39;s or 60&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Weird.  It&#39;s poetic, but weird.<br/>
If kids start to learn cursive at the same point in their lives that Piaget <br/>
noticed they started to become analytical, it&#39;s just a developmental thing <br/>
unrelated.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Well make it illegal for anyone under 21 to do and then kids will be sneaking <br/>
to learn it in droves.<br/>

THIS IS COOL!:<br/>

<br/>
We saw Alexander last night.  The narrator was speaking and his scribe and a <br/>
couple of scribe&#39;s assistants were following him around, parking their stuff <br/>
again, and taking dictation.  Just thought I&#39;d throw that in.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how Jesus&#39;s penmanship was?  He got published without having to sit <br/>
down and prepare some papyrus or velum.<br/>
<br/>
-=-penmanship is a  conceptual, hand-eye coordination skill, which also needs <br/>
to<br/>
be a part of  learning.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
OOOOOoooooh, &quot;conceptual hand-eye coordination *skill*!!!!<br/>
Many many syllables for &quot;a thing you do.&quot;<br/>
They could just play Mario if &quot;conceptual hand-eye-coordination skill&quot; is a <br/>
valued goal in itself.  They could throw rocks at soda cans.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;When students  submit an exam, it&#39;ll be handwritten,&quot; she said.<br/>
&quot;Penmanship and computer  skills, therefore, need to run side by side.&quot;<br/>
Even the SAT  college-admissions test still requires each student, at the<br/>
end of the test,  to copy several paragraphs stating that he or she did not<br/>
cheat.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Didn&#39;t when I took it.  Kirby took a test the other day that was all on the <br/>
computer.  Every standardized test I ever took in school involved coloring in <br/>
my chosen circle with a #2 pencil and not making any stray marks.  Even that <br/>
was a conceptual hand-eye coordination skill.  If only I could do THAT for a <br/>
living, I&#39;d be rich!<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;In<br/>
England, there is a much bigger emphasis placed on penmanship ...  in India<br/>
and Great Britain, they don&#39;t have as much in technological uses, so  more<br/>
pride is taken in one&#39;s written work and how it is conveyed.&quot;<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
I see the ellipses there, but there is information missing.  They don&#39;t have <br/>
as much WHAT in technological uses?  In India maybe she&#39;s talking about <br/>
handwritten English.  There are MANY different languages in India, with entirely <br/>
different writing systems.  I don&#39;t know if there are &quot;keyboarding&quot; opportunities <br/>
to write in Hindi or Tamil.<br/>
<br/>
Hey! I went looking to see if I could find online samples of the scripts, but <br/>
found this.  Some really cool links at the bottom (LOTS, from all over the <br/>
world) about writing systems reforms in various countries, lots of Asian and <br/>
European, but others too.)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/windref.htm">http://home.vicnet.net.au/~ozideas/windref.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
There must be typesetting machines.  And maybe the computers work with <br/>
pull-down menus, as Chinese does.  But Tamil is lots of separate little round <br/>
things, cute little curlies.  And I don&#39;t know the name of the script they write <br/>
Hindi in, but each word is connected with a line across the top and there are <br/>
hangy-down hook-looking things for consonates, and sticky-up little curly <br/>
feathery things for vowels (I think).<br/>
<br/>
And though I don&#39;t know how emphasized handwriting is in English schools, <br/>
their writing is not all involved like our Palmer cursive.  It&#39;s much more like <br/>
our printing, connected a little bit, like italic calligraphy.  They called it <br/>
&quot;connected up writing&quot; or something.  (There are Brits here; help!)<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Not all forms can be filled out online. Many must be done by hand,&quot;  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes!  And every one of them says PRINT CLEARLY right up top.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Didn&#39;t when I took it.  Kirby took a test the other day that was all on the <br/>
&gt;computer.  Every standardized test I ever took in school involved coloring in <br/>
&gt;my chosen circle with a #2 pencil and not making any stray marks.  Even that <br/>
&gt;was a conceptual hand-eye coordination skill.  If only I could do THAT for a <br/>
&gt;living, I&#39;d be rich!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortunately the SAT&#39;s will be requiring a handwritten essay which, <br/>
from what I understand, is very hard to get around and use a laptop if <br/>
you have disabilities...that could be overreaction on some of the LD <br/>
sites I frequent.<br/>

Though the collegeboard site does list computer without spell <br/>
check/grammar/cut & paste features as an accommodation.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.collegeboard.com/ssd/student/accom.html">http://www.collegeboard.com/ssd/student/accom.html</a><br/>
They also have scribe and reader listed. Of course it looks like you <br/>
need to have documented disabilities and had have to have used the <br/>
accommodations in school. I wonder what they do with homeschoolers who <br/>
have neither had IEPs nor been tested for disabilities.<br/>
But one does not need to take the SATs to go to college anyway right?<br/>

For some you do, but you can go to another college first and get some <br/>
practice.<br/>
<br/>
I know they&#39;ve added an essay, but the article wasn&#39;t talking about that.  <br/>
The article seemed to be suggesting a writing sample/affidavit had always been <br/>
part of it and it hasn&#39;t, and that tests are always handwritten, and many <br/>
aren&#39;t.<br/>
