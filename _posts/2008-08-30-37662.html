<div id="ygrps-yiv-1432427600">I&#39;ve been thinking about this situation and what I can learn from it about<br/>
healthy email list etiquette.<br/>
It felt creepy to get that private email from someone I didn&#39;t know inviting<br/>
me to an alternate Yahoo list based on dissatisfaction with the original<br/>
list.  And it made me wonder - if *I* got one, unsolicited, how many other<br/>
people did too?<br/>
I think even if a member of a list wanted to create a more specific email<br/>
list for any sort of sub-group, say unschoolers who like to draw, it still<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be effective to write individual emails that said, &quot;Hey, I&#39;ve<br/>
noticed in your posts that your child likes to draw, would you like to join<br/>
the new UnschoolersWhoDraw list?&quot; because that would miss all the other<br/>
parents of unschoolers who draw, but who have just never mentioned it on the<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
Also, since the new list&#39;s entire basis for existence is dissatisfaction<br/>
with the original list (which can certainly happen, and is a legitimate<br/>
reason for starting a new list, in my opinion), I think it would have have<br/>
been an important courtesy to notify the owner of the original list that the<br/>
new list owner planned to invite members of the original list to join her<br/>
new list.  That this notification didn&#39;t happen doesn&#39;t smell good.<br/>
<br/>
I am on three unschooling and/or homeschooling local email lists in my<br/>
state.  I recently wanted to let members of each list know that the other<br/>
lists exist, so everyone could have more choices.  In that case, there was<br/>
no dissatisfaction on my part, just more of a sense of bringing together.<br/>
 Each list has a different slant, and a different flavor, and I&#39;m a member<br/>
of them all.  I am very glad that I posted my info about the other groups,<br/>
in each case, to the whole list.  I wouldn&#39;t have wanted to make the same<br/>
mistake that happened here, seeing how strong the icky factor is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-359867840">***As I have indicated, these were *not* &quot;uninvited&quot; emails whatsoever. ***<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted to Always Learning in awhile so I&#39;m fair certain I was not part of any discussion here about disordered anything or anybody.   <br/>
<br/>
I did not invite you to contact me.  The email you sent me *twice* was most definitely uninvited.  <br/>
<br/>
I like this list and I like it because I don&#39;t have to sift through stuff like this:   <br/>
<br/>
***My DD had severe ADHD.  Her symptoms included severe hyperactivity<br/>
dangerously combined with impulsivity (such as no thought or care<br/>
before running into a busy street), inability to focus and related<br/>
frustration with herself, very oppositional behavior, poor eye<br/>
contact, difficulty listening, emotional hypersensitivity, social<br/>
anxiety, overwhelmed by clean-up projects.  She would say very<br/>
negative things about herself and had chronic headaches.  Her ADHD<br/>
counterpart of autistic &quot;flapping&quot; was endless somersaulting on our<br/>
ottoman just to keep herself in motion.  Sometimes she would launch<br/>
herself into belly-flops onto the ottoman or a bed just to keep<br/>
herself in motion.  Another repetitive type of behavior would be<br/>
continuous rewinding to listen to a tiny segment of music or a DVD<br/>
over and over again. ***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When kids are throwing themselves on ottomans or tumbling on furniture that&#39;s not a problem with the kid&#39;s behavior that&#39;s an indication that the mom needs to take that kid to the park or to the pool or to the back yard and PLAY with him.   Get a tumbling mat if the sofa&#39;s about worn out.  Get a trampoline.  Get a punching bag.    Get at least as interested in helping your kid do those things (she&#39;s clearly telling you) she wants and needs to do as you are in telling us why she needs fixing.<br/>
  <br/>
 And this: ***Another repetitive type of behavior would be<br/>
continuous rewinding to listen to a tiny segment of music or a DVD<br/>
over and over again.***<br/>
<br/>
Everyone who was ever young and loved music rewound their favorite parts of songs eight billion times.  Jeezy Creezy.   These days if I don&#39;t understand lyrics I can get information online.  In the old days, it was rewind, rewind, rewind, rewind.   My son&#39;s big old Wurlitzer organ has a built in tape player so he can listen to tiny segments as many times as he wants.   Why do you suppose cd players and dvd players have those search features?  If you could know that in twenty years she&#39;d be a sought after sound editor, or breaker of secret codes would you think of these behaviors as negative things?   <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a sign of a pretty smart kid who becomes oppositional when adults want to pick apart every thing they do.  I think it&#39;s psychologically healthy to oppose those who want to control us.   I would avoid eye contact when I knew that someone was going to tell me all the stuff I *needed* to do or not do in order to win their approval.  When a parent says to a kid &quot;Look at me.&quot;  They intend the  power of their eye contact to have a controlling influence on that child and the purpose is to make the child behave the way the parent wants.   Kids aren&#39;t idiots.  They know what &quot;Look at me&quot; means.   They know they&#39;re being bullied.  I looked at a bunch of youtube videos of kids with autism after one thread on another list and what I came away thinking was that any kid who has such annoying parents as those in the video is doing pretty well to find a way to cope.  One video about avoidance of eye contact was a person repeatedly asking her kid to look at her while she filmed him when he was busy doing something he found very interesting.   An adult would have told her to take a flying leap.   Her child was more polite.  That video would have been better titled, &quot;Thoughtless Mom Pestering Busy Kid.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Experts&quot; for awhile (and maybe still) told parents to look their kid in the eye when they wanted to convey something important.  That was so the parent could be sure the kid heard (as we all know we hear through our eyeballs) and so the parents could tag that kid as &quot;not listening&quot; if he still did the thing after having had the eyeball treatment.   We don&#39;t do that to adults.  If your boss said, &quot;Look at me, LOOK AT ME, I want you to take these papers to Fred.&quot;  You&#39;d think the guy was an A hole.  Well guess what? &lt;g&gt;   And if you met someone who got in your face and maybe grabbed your shoulders or chin  to force eye contact how often would you want to hang around that person?   Let&#39;s not do that rude and creepy thing to our kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I never knew a kid who didn&#39;t flap or flop or fling or flail or twirl, hop, wiggle or engage in repetitive behaviors. Is a baby dropping a toy over and over again and watching it fall engaging in abnormal repetitive behaviors? Of course not.   As our kids grow there is so much for them to learn and we really don&#39;t have to see their experimentation with sound, motion and sensation as defective or abnormal.    Kids learn and grow better when they get to decide when they&#39;re ready to use the potty, dress themselves, use a fork, read, spell, ride a bike...and they are the only ones who can decide when an experiment in squeaking or flapping is over.  <br/>
If it bugs you, go into the other room or find a place for them to flop or bark or hop where they won&#39;t bug or hurt anybody else.  <br/>
<br/>
The problem is the behaviors annoy and/or embarrass parents and when parents are annoyed or embarrassed or frustrated we know that can&#39;t be a problem with the parents...that&#39;s a problem with that disordered kid.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also seen parents  ignore really socially unacceptable behaviors in a child.  The bigger problem is they also mostly ignore the kid and his needs.   Maybe they&#39;re busy with other easier kids or a job or a sick mom and that different kid gets brushed off because it seems like he just takes up so much precious time.  So when a kid gets ignored and his behaviors get ignored the problem can get big.  That&#39;s still not a problem with the kid.  That&#39;s a problem with the parenting.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not interested in a list where parents whine about their difficult kids and make up excuses and justifications for labeling and controlling. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When parents call me on the phone about taking their kids out of  <br/>
school, the first thing they usually want to do is tell me ALL about  <br/>
the problems at school. They don&#39;t believe I truly understand if I  <br/>
don&#39;t let them tell me, so usually I listen. At some point in their  <br/>
recital of how horrific the school situation has been, they&#39;ll almost  <br/>
always mention something that elicits my admiration of the child for  <br/>
resisting some kind of adult attempt to control him. The minute I say,  <br/>
&quot;Well, good for him, sounds like he has a strong sense of justice,&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;Good for him, glad to hear he still has a strong sense of self. He  <br/>
must be incredibly resilient.&quot; the mom usually starts to cry and says  <br/>
that&#39;s the first positive thing she&#39;s heard anybody say about her son  <br/>
for years.<br/>
<br/>
A large percentage of the people who call me for new homeschooler  <br/>
information are considering taking 12 to 16 year old boys out of  <br/>
school. Those are the kids for whom it becomes SO apparent that school  <br/>
is not working that they consider homeschooling even though that is  <br/>
something they never ever thought they&#39;d do.<br/>

something they never ever thought they&#39;d do.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t have to imagine how different those boys&#39; lives would be  <br/>
if they hadn&#39;t been in school.  Kirby is 22 and Marty is 19 and I see  <br/>
them in contrast to the other young men around them all the time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one current story:  Kirby and his roommate and some others who  <br/>
work with them at Blizzard in Austin all talked about using a bonus  <br/>
they thought they were getting (still might) to go to Las Vegas to be  <br/>
there on Talk Like a Pirate Day, at Treasure Island (or stay  <br/>
somewhere, but to be there that weekend).  The bonus hasn&#39;t come  <br/>
through as they thought it would yet, so some of them can&#39;t afford to  <br/>
go and others are going.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s roommate has also invited a lot of his high school friends  <br/>
from here to meet them there.  They all plan to drink and gamble.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby (22) told me he&#39;s still planning to go, but he&#39;s not wanting to  <br/>
gamble any more than some small limited amount, if any, and doesn&#39;t  <br/>
much like to drink.  One other guy who&#39;s going is kind of that way so  <br/>
Kirby figures some of the time he&#39;ll only have that one other guy to  <br/>
hang out with.  He knows there&#39;s still lots of stuff to do there, and  <br/>
I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll have fun, but I think most 22 year olds with a healthy  <br/>
bank account and a trip to Las Vegas booked already would not be  <br/>
calling their moms to say it doesn&#39;t sound all that fun or productive.<br/>
<br/>
And lest anyone think that means Kirby&#39;s a shy mama&#39;s boy, he is not.<br/>
<br/>
Marty (19) is working at a restaurant so most of his income is cash  <br/>
every day after the shift, his percentage of the waiters&#39; tips (he&#39;s  <br/>
bussing tables at a Persian restaurant).  He comes home, counts it,  <br/>
writes the amount in a notebook, and then I&#39;m not sure exactly what,  <br/>
but sometimes he gives Keith a pile of bills and Keith electronically  <br/>
transfers that amount from our account to Marty&#39;s savings.<br/>
<br/>
The other day someone was playing Rock Band with Marty and wanted to  <br/>
download Metallica or some such.  Marty said &quot;I don&#39;t have $15.&quot;  I  <br/>
objected to the lie, but what Marty meant was he didn&#39;t have $15 in  <br/>
his video game/entertainment budget.  He&#39;s making payments on his  <br/>
jeep and putting half his pay in savings.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was making fun of him behind his back the other day, but in a  <br/>
pretty complimentary way.  She said it was interesting that Marty had  <br/>
the Dodd-family genes (remember I&#39;m only a Dodd by marriage; she&#39;s  <br/>
not talking about me!) and would say &quot;I can&#39;t spend that money, it&#39;s  <br/>
for my grandchildren&#39;s college fund!&quot;  She was making up a humorous  <br/>
example, but he really, truly, at the age of 19, is thinking of his  <br/>
distant future.<br/>
<br/>
Kids their age in school have many other things to think about.  More  <br/>
&quot;real life&quot;?  Some would claim so.  Things like exams, homework,  <br/>
reports, a &quot;healthy&quot; social life (drinking and gambling and running  <br/>
around).  My kids have lots of social life--enough that they&#39;re not  <br/>
desperate for attention or getting out of the house.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253490757">Ed and Zac (14) are downstairs watching Muppets Christmas Carol - go figure - :)   -   We were at Block Buster yesterday and Muppets movies were what he rented.   He did not care that it was Labor Day weekend and one of his choices was a Christmas movie and all his choices came from the &quot;kiddy isle&quot; at Block Buster.   Yesterday he climbed into my lap (he is taller than I am) and snuggled for a couple of minutes.   The laughter coming from the family room is great.  He did need us with him for &quot;The Muppet Caper&quot; because some of the jokes are so 1970&#39;s-80&#39;s oriented sometimes we have to pause the CD and explain - Same for MASH and Hogan&#39;s Heroes which he likes.<br/>
<br/>
Least people think he always chooses from the kiddy isle - so not true - War movies with fantastic battle scenes are his most favorite.<br/>
<br/>
He is very secure in what he likes and does not like - he does not do something just because everyone else does it / likes it.<br/>
<br/>
I could focus on his (what do I call them? society would call them problems? Dyslexia/Dysgraphia/slow processing speed but with profound Giftedness) - for example he wrote us a note the other day saying &quot;ant jane sid Hi&quot;  what he was saying was &quot;Aunt Janny said hi.&quot;  I chose to just read it / decipher it and say thank you for giving us the message.  It was actually amazing that he wrote it in the first place.  He usually never writes.  Plus his spelling is really improving as he goes along.  Oh and the other amazing thing was he had been on My Space chatting with her - this was a first for him - to chat in writing / typing with anyone.  He is more and more asking how do you spell - wanting to get it correct.  We were not at home when he did the chat with his Aunt Janny so we were not available - though he has called us on our cell phones to ask how to spell something in the past.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday he was talking about going to college.  How he will need to go to get a decent paying job - I chose to discuss with him that there are many paths in life that lead to joy and making enough money to be comfortable.  We gave examples of various trades and self-owned businesses that people do.  Then he talked about how college will be so hard for him because he does not read and write well nor is he good at math (THANK YOU SCHOOL FOR THAT PART OF HIS LIFE - we pulled him from mid-third grade) anyway his father and I talked with him about how things change and he might be good at it by then or if he really wants to go to college then he would have the drive and passion to figure it out at that point in time.  AND if he chooses to go to college we will be there to help if he wants us to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095410965">The e-mail below the line was sent to me instead of to the list, but  <br/>
it&#39;s not about me privately.  I&#39;ll comment in another post.<br/>
<br/>
Anytime I get insulting private mail, I&#39;m glad to share it publicly.   <br/>
Those who think I shouldn&#39;t should stay far away from me, because I&#39;m  <br/>
telling you now, I don&#39;t want to be assaulted without feeling I have  <br/>
the right to report it, so anyone who likes private attacks and wants  <br/>
to hold me to some kind of secrecy about it can just forget it.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re not teaching.  We&#39;re not attacking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
People on the list ARE attacking, and incredibly offensive, twisting  <br/>
words and meanings!<br/>
If you really wanted to get the unschooling message out, perhaps you  <br/>
and your listmates should consider guiding others rather than  <br/>
expecting them to know all of your rules.  Sharing experiences goes  <br/>
so much further than nasty attacks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nobody&#39;s asking anyone to accept anything. It&#39;s a big wide world,  <br/>
and a DAMNED big internet. Nobody in any way has tried to keep<br/>
people on this list. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say anyone told me to stay.  I am telling you why I left,  <br/>
though I am sure you could care less.  But I care and it needed to be  <br/>
said, even if on deaf ears.<br/>
<br/>
Also, anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with you gets attacked.  If they try  <br/>
to start their own list, that idea and list is attacked.  Talk about  <br/>
being &quot;an adult.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You must not have unschooled long enough to see the proof in your  <br/>
own family, but hundreds of families here have done so. It doesn&#39;t  <br/>
take a lifetime to &quot;prove&quot; the benefit. People can benefit within an  <br/>
hour of seeing a different way and just lightening up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The point about unschooling being unproven was not that it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
work, just that it&#39;s not the only unproven thing that does work.<br/>
<br/>
&quot; You, whoever you are reading this, joined this list. Be adult about  <br/>
it. If you go into a bar or restaurant and you decide to leave, do<br/>
you make an tacky insulting speech on the way out? If you start  <br/>
reading a book and decide not to finish it, do you call the author<br/>
and say &quot;Your book sucks!&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If I read a book as offensive as the list has been, I would contact  <br/>
the writer.  Though most of the offensive statements came not from  <br/>
you, but other members.  Since it is your list, the complaint goes to  <br/>
you.  At a restuarant. if I got horrible service or food, or the  <br/>
staff was offensive, I&#39;d alert the manager.  This is adult behavior.   <br/>
Your desire to undermine me is not.<br/>
<br/>
If I owned a list that was alienating people, offending them, I&#39;d  <br/>
want to know.  I certainly wouldn&#39;t try to slam them, or take their  <br/>
energy!  Take your own advise, be adult about it.  Remember all of us  <br/>
are someone&#39;s child, all worthy of respect and honesty and kindness.   <br/>
We are worthy of the same kindness we&#39;d want for our children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 From one person who was once a child to another, I hope your list  <br/>
fills your needs, and I shall look to fill my needs elsewhere.<br/>

If I and my listmates really want to get the unschooling message  <br/>

<br/>
Well we&#39;re up into message numbers like 37747 today, and will pass  <br/>
into the 40 thousands before the end of the year.  And I&#39;m pretty  <br/>
careful to keep those posts from being local or chit-chat so the vast  <br/>
majority of them are solid, serious discussion of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And there are other lists too:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
one that I&#39;m also on (UnschoolingDiscussion@googlegroups) and several  <br/>
I&#39;m not on, and they&#39;re in the tens of thousands of posts, too, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
and I post here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschoolinginfo.com/forum">http://unschoolinginfo.com/forum</a><br/>
<br/>
and lately<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/">http://familyrun.ning.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and another listmate maintains this collection:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Trying to guide people away from divisive lists and bad advice gets  <br/>
me insulting side mail, and yet I do not run off crying, partly  <br/>
because several of those who slapped me with a &quot;you suck&quot; message  <br/>
before storming out have come back and said &quot;So... I looked around  <br/>
and discovered the other resources aren&#39;t very good and I thought  <br/>
about what you said and I&#39;m back because our lives are better because  <br/>
of what I read on this list&quot; (or forum, or another list, or whatever).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those who can do better should go and do it, but starting and then  <br/>
abandoning a list that says labels won&#39;t hurt isn&#39;t better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1953467719">-=-Also, anyone who doesn&#39;t agree with you gets attacked. If they try<br/>
to start their own list, that idea and list is attacked. Talk about<br/>
being &quot;an adult.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think &quot;attacked&quot; is the word.  Someone spammed members of  <br/>
this list with a lie.  It&#39;s okay for me to object to that.<br/>
<br/>
Someone tried to use my list&#39;s reputation in the name of another list  <br/>
to gain members.  It&#39;s GOOD for me to object to that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The tense used above is a present conditional (it&#39;s not present  <br/>
progressive, but close), I think (spot me, Ren) which carries the  <br/>
implication that it is an ongoing, regular occurence that there are  <br/>
other lists created by people who are attacked here and that then  <br/>
their ideas and their new lists are attacked.  Plural and present and  <br/>
continuing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind if people don&#39;t care about verb tenses or the  <br/>
technicalities of language, but if someone is going to use English,  <br/>
use it carefully and honestly.  If the writer accidentally accused me  <br/>
of continuously doing something that wasn&#39;t even done once, it&#39;s like  <br/>
using a gun carelessly,  shooting something, and saying &quot;Well I don&#39;t  <br/>
know how to use a gun anyway.&quot;  Either use English carefully or don&#39;t  <br/>
point it at me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1230569848">-=-If I read a book as offensive as the list has been, I would contact<br/>
the writer. Though most of the offensive statements came not from<br/>
you, but other members.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The first is ridiculous and the second is false.  I&#39;m sure most of  <br/>
the alleged offense comes from me, because I&#39;m the bravest and it&#39;s  <br/>
my list so I&#39;m the least likely to tiptoe.<br/>
<br/>
I already have enemies and stalkers and a few people whose only claim  <br/>
to fame is their assertions that I have it in for them or something  <br/>
(and when I&#39;m shown the report of how I really don&#39;t like them, I  <br/>
don&#39;t recognize their names).  There was one, once on AOL.  She was  <br/>
always up and noisy about how people should ignore me because I was  <br/>
awful, and her ideas were just as good as anyone&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
A few years later I had e-mail from someone who had met her at a park  <br/>
day wherever she lived (not around here; she had never met me) and  <br/>
she was going on about how when she was on AOL she butted heads with  <br/>
me or whatever.  AND the crowning glory of the story was that her  <br/>
kids had never yet finished a whole year at home.  Every year they&#39;d  <br/>
gone back to school.  Each year she would change and change her  <br/>
unschooling methods or theories and her kids would want to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
If her theory was &quot;never decide and let life be ever-changing and  <br/>
chaotic,&quot; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a better idea than mine.  If her idea  <br/>
was to spend hours of energy (many hours) concentrating on me and  <br/>
talking about me instead of being with her kids, that&#39;s a really bad  <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
Negativity isn&#39;t as good as joy and happiness.  I&#39;m sure someone will  <br/>
want to argue with that, but I&#39;m a pretty good shot with English and  <br/>
I&#39;m sure that happiness is happier than unhappiness.<br/>

If you really wanted to get the unschooling message out, perhaps  you <br/>

so  much further than nasty attacks.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

Reading responses like this makes me so sad. And a bit frustrated. It  <br/>
reminds me of my attitude when I first came to unschooling *discussion* boards  <br/>
(namely, Unschooling Discussion). If people who felt so offended and so attacked  <br/>
would just quit making *so much noise* and *listen*, they would get <br/>
unschooling  so much quicker. But, I think that&#39;s a process... Folks who like to <br/>
&quot;harrumph&quot;  and bluster and take offense need to run out of steam and ammunition <br/>
before they  can pause a moment to breathe, and in *that* process, the listening <br/>
*just*  starts to happen. If luck holds, they&#39;ll continue to listen....<br/>

it&#39;, every bit as much as they need me. Scientists mostly learn<br/>

fit their  theories, they think up new theories, not cling to the old<br/>
ones & try to twist the experiment to make it fit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448306447">Hi,<br/>
Karen&#39;s invite to join another list is not the only invite I have <br/>
received from those on this list; however, it was the most disturbing.  <br/>
I read through (my own mistake) all the info on labels and the <br/>
description of Karen&#39;s child and a few other descriptions of behaviors <br/>
and started to think--that sounds just like my son and I got an <br/>
uncomfortable feeling in the pit of my stomach--not appreciated.  You <br/>
know, desire to discuss labels is one thing, but to promote their use <br/>
is quite another.  Karen implied that there was no free discussion of <br/>
labels on this list and that she wanted this topic to be discussed--<br/>
well, labels is about all that has been written about lately so I would <br/>
say that she got her wish.  Unfortunately harm can come from putting <br/>
your personal needs above the needs of others. <br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, the only place labels belong are on the backs of <br/>
clothing and even those scratch, irritate, and leave marks a lot of the <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
Going back to not thinking about labels!<br/>

clothes.  The 12 year old has been known to wear his underwear inside<br/>
out to avoid those tags because they are more difficult to remove.  <br/>
