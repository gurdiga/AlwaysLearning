<div id="ygrps-yiv-1907245604">Thanks, Pam, for that website (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.shout.net/~mathman/)">http://www.shout.net/~mathman/)</a>. This is an <br/>
interesting guy, fasure. I&#39;m not certain about everything there, but Ledlie <br/>
liked the problems he presented in his examples (and now we must go buy a <br/>
pineapple;^).<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
