&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think this is a yes or no answer.  I have both provided more info (correction) and I have not said anything--it has depended on the situation.  I think the more important consideration is whether more info would add anything to my child&#39;s world.  Sometimes yes, but sometimes no if the actual fact isn&#39;t the important thing to them.  <br/>
<br/>
And when they were younger, and very excited about a thought they&#39;d come up with, I&#39;d just leave it alone if it wasn&#39;t spot-on, and knew that time and experience would &quot;fix&quot; the misinterpretation.  I would focus on sharing their enthusiasm.  And sometimes after hearing them I could help them shape their idea if it seemed like they were receptive to that.  <br/>
<br/>
I have, however, been in the company of many parents who thought that their five year olds needed to get every factoid right and that that was what was important.  It&#39;s not pretty.  It&#39;s not pretty to see the light of discovery fade from a child&#39;s eyes.<br/>

the right answer. But if they&#39;ll never encounter it again, does it  <br/>
matter? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Most all knowledge is imperfect. It gets refined as we go along  <br/>
because we keep encountering it in different contexts.<br/>
<br/>
If someone has an urge to correct, it might help to assume you might  <br/>
be mistaken. Then you&#39;ll mentally put yourself in a place of more  <br/>
equal footing.<br/>

<br/>
Ah.  I wonder aloud alot.  Which worries me sometimes that it will seem like<br/>
I never know what I&#39;m talking about.  I&#39;m much better now when people<br/>
correct me than when I was a kid.  I figure even if what someone says isn&#39;t<br/>
right, it&#39;s more ideas than I had before.  As a kid though... I agree it&#39;s<br/>
better not to quash a child&#39;s wondering aloud or fact finding.  Because the<br/>
danger is they might believe that more statements are facts than really<br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny or maybe only to be expected that Karl seldom asks questions in a<br/>
question format.  He puts things out there to test them and at times I<br/>
wonder if he wants me to be part of that or not.  Most of the time, I think<br/>
not.  When I do that, I usually do want to know what others think.  Which<br/>
explains why I like lists and forums.  It helps that I don&#39;t take everything<br/>
as fact though.  ;)  I hope others do the same because that&#39;s the truth.<br/>
Don&#39;t believe everything you hear, read or think.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I was wondering something similiar about reading.  My 7 year old is wanting to read. We sit and read together sometimes and while reading he makes many mistakes since he is just beginning.  I mostly dont say anything about them unless they change the meaning of a passage, but then wonder if I should just say nothing unless he asks.</div>

<br/>
And if he says yes, check periodically to make sure it&#39;s not getting  <br/>
annoying if he&#39;s not the type to speak up.<br/>

LOL.  I&#39;m not *trying* to wonder aloud.  I just do.  But yeah.  That&#39;s<br/>
the general opinion of that sorta thing.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s called troubleshooting.  And it&#39;s a highly prized skill.<br/>
Something we wouldn&#39;t want to dis.<br/>
<br/>
So as to our children making untrue statements, it&#39;s the same thing.<br/>
The same exact skill.<br/>
<br/>
My question sometimes is am I shortcutting his troubleshooting<br/>
process.  Sometimes I think I might be but most times I don&#39;t think<br/>
so.<br/>

Principles aren&#39;t about what&#39;s &quot;necessary,&quot; though.<br/>

I&#39;m sure children can learn even when their parents don&#39;t know enough  <br/>
to correct their factoids.  And children whose parents correct their  <br/>
factoids unmercifully might give up trying to learn around their  <br/>
parents.<br/>

With my kids, it depends how leisurely the moment is, what mood the  <br/>
kid&#39;s in, whether it seems it could cause problems that they don&#39;t  <br/>
know the thing...   It depends.<br/>

An example of that ... the other day Karl said something about wrestlers and<br/>
he was twisting his own head around, I think wondering how far is too far or<br/>
if there even is a &quot;too far.&quot;  I said owls are made to be able to turn their<br/>
heads all the way around but not humans, that it can actually kill a human.<br/>
And since he was twisting his own head around with his hands, I added not to<br/>
let someone else do that to him or do it to someone else because you can<br/>
feel for yourself how far is too far but not for someone else.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to leave that for him to discover on his own even though I<br/>
think he already had a pretty good inkling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-138201595">Sometimes it can be good to follow their thoughts without correcting.  <br/>
<br/>
The other day Samuel asked me at least 3 times what zero plus zero is.  The first time I just answered, the second time I turned it into a word problem, and the third time I asked why he was asking.  His thinking was that 101 (his favorite number) is a big number, since it has a zero in it, zero must have a value.  <br/>
<br/>
I still need to show him how place value works since we were in the car at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, my point is sometimes they have a good idea, but the wrong conclusion.  It can be good to investigate further to find out how they got there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-341871237">-=-Could you give some examples, Sandra, when you say depending on the  <br/>
child&#39;s mood ?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give examples not about mothers and children, and you can see it  <br/>
in a clearer light, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband came home yesterday, I needed some groceries.  I had  <br/>
food cooking and couldn&#39;t leave.  The store is very near, quick  <br/>
walking distance.  Usually when Keith gets home, his routine is to  <br/>
check the mail and change his clothes.  I greeted him and thought...   <br/>
Holly was on her way home, more or less, somewhere, and I could ask  <br/>
her.  But the list was here, and I wasn&#39;t sure when Holly would call  <br/>
me back.   Keith wasn&#39;t limping (his back&#39;s been hurting) and he  <br/>
walked like he was happy, so I asked him if he could go.  If he had  <br/>
said no, I wouldn&#39;t have whined or pressed.  I&#39;d&#39;ve probably called  <br/>
Holly again, or turned off the stove and gone.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s mom (my mother in law) had her arm amputated.  She&#39;s 90 or  <br/>
so.  She has tumor on the bones and it just wasn&#39;t going to heal or  <br/>
accept a pin or plate.    Kirby (my oldest, 22)  was moving from his  <br/>
apartment to a house that week, and then going to a conference.  He  <br/>
was really happy to hang out with Brett (Holly&#39;s boyfriend, and one of  <br/>
Kirby&#39;s best friends for years), and Rosie Sorooshian, and Holly  <br/>
(Holly was third no matter which order the other two were in), and so  <br/>
I didn&#39;t tell him about his grandmother.  I considered telling him on  <br/>
the way to the airport, but the mood was light and I know he didn&#39;t  <br/>
take his uncle&#39;s death in 2007 very well.  I didn&#39;t want him to think  <br/>
about it all the way to Austin, by himself.  I told him by phone a few  <br/>
days later, when he was home and recovered and in a calm mood.  We  <br/>
talked about it and he talked to his dad.<br/>
<br/>
I predicted what he would need in terms of processing.  I didn&#39;t want  <br/>
to take any time or energy or focus out of the conference and his  <br/>
visit with friends.  I didn&#39;t want to make him afraid or unhappy or  <br/>
unsettled.<br/>
<br/>
My friend Bill (not his real name) was here talking about AA meetings  <br/>
a week ago.  I gave him a copy of Daily Affirmations, because half his  <br/>
problems are about parents, and stepparents, and alcohol, drugs,  <br/>
irresponsibility.   Half his problem is his own drinking, and he had  <br/>
been sober a week or ten days or something.  He got drunk Saturday  <br/>
night (not here, but where Marty was in another town).  Usually we  <br/>
talk every few days.  I know he had planned to come by here before he  <br/>
went on through Albuquerque to his own home elsewhere.   It&#39;s  <br/>
Thursday.  It&#39;s been a week since we talked.  Usually we talk more.  I  <br/>
could call him but he will take it as a &quot;visitation,&quot; as a checking  <br/>
in, like a mom calling a bad kid or something.  So I&#39;m going to wait  <br/>
until he figures out how he wants to discuss it, if he wants to  <br/>
discuss it. I&#39;m not mad at him.  I just don&#39;t want to impose on what  <br/>
is probably an unsettled and embarrassing set of thoughts for him.  By  <br/>
the time I talk to him he will have had a counselling session or two,  <br/>
talked with his wife, maybe gone to more AA meetings or thought about  <br/>
why he doesn&#39;t want to, and I won&#39;t press him to share what he doesn&#39;t  <br/>
want to share.<br/>
<br/>
Same with my kids when they were young (as one of those was my child,  <br/>
though he&#39;s a man living in another state).  Same with any  <br/>
considerations of whether it&#39;s a good time to say more or to be quiet.<br/>
<br/>
-=Otherwise,- William dreams to become a pilot that travels through  <br/>
space and sea. I don&#39;t correct him about his fictions. Should I ?  <br/>
Being a pilot is a dream. Reality vs dream, imagination, how do you  <br/>
encourage a happy child to keep on dreaming ?-=-<br/>
<br/>
He dreams at night, you mean?  Or he plans and dreams of the future?   <br/>
If he&#39;s telling you his dreams, it&#39;s a dream.  Dreams have their own  <br/>
reality.  If I honestly, truly dreamed my cat could fly, that&#39;s not a  <br/>
fiction.  It&#39;s the truth of what I dreamed.<br/>
<br/>
If by dream you mean what he might want to do someday, how is that not  <br/>
reality?  Real people pilot those space shuttles and submarines.  Real  <br/>
pilots.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I really wish to be inspired to make a good point when needed  <br/>
only. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Good depends&quot; and &quot;needed&quot; depends. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2114260605">---I, too, had dreams as a child  and many of them have come true for me. Many have changed over time and I look forward now to many new adventures or dreams per say!

&gt; Being a pilot is a dream that could become a reality. It did for me. When i drove mini school buses up and down the parkways of Long Island i visualised flight maneuvers. 45 degree steep power turns,power on/off stalls,spins. I started flying before i could drive but had to postpone getting my license until my 20&#39;s. I love landing on little town grass strips,tying down and going for lunch.--- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, Anne Mills &lt;anne-mills@&gt; wrote:<br/>

&gt; &gt; Could you give some examples, Sandra, when you say depending on the child&#39;s mood ?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lately I have noticed three possible dilemmas for me and wondered what to answer ti genuine questions about :<br/>
&gt; &gt; - BirthMy son -He is 5 1/2- was asking if he was coming from his father&#39;s belly as well as mine or before mine. His vision and his enthousiasm made me think. I told him as truthfully as I could. In a way he is coming from his father &#39;s and his question amazed me quite a bit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Otherwise,- William dreams to become a pilot that travels through space and sea. I don&#39;t correct him about his fictions. Should I ? Being a pilot is a dream. Reality vs dream, imagination, how do you encourage a happy child to keep on dreaming ?<br/>
&gt; &gt; - he asks me swimming technics so i delivered gladly but that did not really help him :-) <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; -=-I was reading on unschooling principles and I had the thought that it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn&#39;t mention if correction of a child&#39;s factoids is necessary in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; order<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for learning to take place? I don&#39;t think it does.-=-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Principles aren&#39;t about what&#39;s &quot;necessary,&quot; though.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The best answer to most questions is &quot;it depends.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m sure children can learn even when their parents don&#39;t know enough<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to correct their factoids. And children whose parents correct their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; factoids unmercifully might give up trying to learn around their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parents.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; With my kids, it depends how leisurely the moment is, what mood the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kid&#39;s in, whether it seems it could cause problems that they don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know the thing... It depends.<br/>
