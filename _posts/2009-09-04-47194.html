<div id="ygrps-yiv-74599635">I am in need of a job very badly. I feel as if I will loose my mind if I don&#39;t get one soon. I suffer from emotional abuse from my husband and tho he is a good man in his own way we have grown severally apart. I need to prepare myself in the case that we separate and I do see it coming. He is not involved with my unschooling our two kids at all and has never been. He does his own thing and I am use to that where unschooling is concerned. I have a hard time emotionaly in my relationship with him and that is not where advice is needed. If you do have any tho I would be thankful. <br/>
<br/>
My problem is that I need a job and ideally it would be from home. I don&#39;t have anyone to care  for my girls while I am away at work. I would love it if they could work on their projects and interest while I worked. If any of you have any ideas for me or any contacts I would very much appreciate it. I am a licensed wedding planner but there isn&#39;t any business in my area for that. I also am an aspiring florist and artist. I am a fast learner and a hard worker.I have already been all over Rat Race Rebellion and WAHM. I dont need anything fancy because I dont have many bills. I have been preparing myself for being on my own with the kids. If you can help me I would appreciate. thank you so much.</div>

 </span></blockquote>You might want to check back in the archives of this list for jobs  <br/>
from home. (Or the Unschooling Basics list. I think there was a  <br/>
recent discussion.) There&#39;s also a folder at the Radical Unschooling  <br/>
Network for single parents where you might open up a discussion about  <br/>
work.<br/>

I suspect it feels like you&#39;re drowning with just the tip of your  <br/>
nose left above the water. It&#39;s probably too obvious to say this but  <br/>
a point of desperation is not the best place to make decisions from.  <br/>
If you can get to treading water in the relationship you might see  <br/>
some better paths. A really good place is:<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d suggest you read through the archives first before posting so you  <br/>
can pick up some of the basic information for building relationships.<br/>
<br/>
And if anyone else feels like they&#39;re at the beginning of negative  <br/>
path in their relationship, please do join! Divorce is damaging to  <br/>
kids. Even an amicable divorce. Even a divorce from an abusive  <br/>
spouse. Without understanding that, it&#39;s impossible to plan for it  <br/>
and counteract it. Parents are so busy licking their own wounds they  <br/>
can be relieved if kids aren&#39;t crying out in pain.<br/>
<br/>
Even setting aside the possibility that a disinterested spouse will  <br/>
suddenly decide the kids need to go to school -- though it should be  <br/>
examined as a very real possibility! -- it&#39;s very healthy for kids to  <br/>
see a relationship being worked on, even if it&#39;s by only one partner.  <br/>
I suspect most of the marriages that survive happen just by luck. Not  <br/>
because that&#39;s the only way but because we as a society don&#39;t have  <br/>
good models for building relationships. It&#39;s all treated as though it  <br/>
either works or doesn&#39;t. And that just isn&#39;t so. There&#39;s lots of good  <br/>
advice on the Peaceful Partnerships list.<br/>

Yes.  An easier job and more moral and better for the kids would be to  <br/>
repair and sustain your marriage.<br/>

Helping parents find a job so they can unschool because of an  <br/>
impending divorce is very rarely, if ever, an unschooling topic.  It&#39;s  <br/>
a &quot;now the kids will go to school&quot; situation, almost always.<br/>
