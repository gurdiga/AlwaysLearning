&quot;About once a year I dream that I&#39;m on the campus where I went to<br/>
college and that either it&#39;s time for a final and I hadn&#39;t attended<br/>
the class at all, or that I&#39;m missing a final, or can&#39;t find the right<br/>
building or room, or am deciding to just ditch a final test.&quot;<br/>

I went to school and although I do rarely have school anxiety dreams,  <br/>
most of my  anxiety dreams now are from when I was a waitress. I  <br/>
waited tables for about 10 years, and while I was doing that, I had  <br/>
anxiety dreams at least a couple times a week. Like, the whole  <br/>
restaurant was my &quot;section&quot; and it was packed, or I couldnt get the  <br/>
food out of the kitchen or the computer was jammed and wouldnt take  <br/>
my orders.<br/>
<br/>
Even tho its been 7 years since I waitressed or bartended, I still  <br/>
have these dreams fairly often. Couple times a month at least. I had  <br/>
one last night, as a matter of fact!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe its obvious, but I found waiting tables to be stressful. I also  <br/>
had a lot of fun and quite often really enjoyed it, especially when I  <br/>
worked with a lot of fun people. I dont know if the dreams I have  <br/>
about it now are leftover memories/worries about that time, or if any  <br/>
of the stress/worries I have *now* just manifest as waitress work!<br/>
<br/>
I think probably the former, because I really dont have major  <br/>
concerns or stress right now. Now that I think about it, that time of  <br/>
my life, stress and anxiety werent just from work. My whole life was  <br/>
a mess.<br/>
