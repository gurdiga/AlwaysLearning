<div id="ygrps-yiv-281475817">They are tiny little snakes that are easily mistaken for earth worms.  They<br/>
are pinkish-lavender colored.  In the Spring, they invade our house coming<br/>
in through the master bath somewhere.  Danny (3) goes on snake expeditions<br/>
daily, flipping over all the bath mats.<br/>
<br/>
I really kind of like them, but most people around here don&#39;t.<br/>

I was told that these are rare, I&#39;ve only seen one when we lived in San<br/>
Diego and it was injured.  I guess they aren&#39;t as rare as this person<br/>
stated.<br/>
