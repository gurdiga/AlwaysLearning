I had never heard of this before. Have you? I felt that this<br/>
information was important to share with other parents.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that you will also share this information with friends and<br/>
family. It might save a life!<br/>
<br/>
This story talks about &#39;dry-drowning&#39; which apparently accounts for<br/>

Unless something has to do with unschooling or you can discuss  <br/>
unschooling in and around it, this list isn&#39;t a good place for it.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>
