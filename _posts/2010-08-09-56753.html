<div id="ygrps-yiv-1878706048">For many months   [OH JEEZ, I went to check whether I needed to say  <br/>
&quot;For about a year.&quot; DOH!]<br/>
<br/>
For a year and a half, I&#39;ve held online text-chats (typing, not  <br/>
speaking) about unschooling, twice a week.<br/>
<br/>
Beginning last week, I added another one.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy to say when exactly they are, although they ARE at  <br/>
precise times.   From my point of view in New Mexico, they are Monday  <br/>
afternoon, Wednesday night, and Friday morning.  But those times  <br/>
aren&#39;t even &quot;right&quot; on the east coast of north America where they are  <br/>
dinnertime, midnight, and noon.<br/>
<br/>
Those who haven&#39;t been to one might want to check here:<br/>

<br/>
Those who forget when they are can subscribe to reminders by joining  <br/>
the list here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ChatNote/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ChatNote/</a><br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to put notices on this list, because they&#39;re fleeting and  <br/>
it&#39;s good for the archives of this list to be always useful, not  <br/>
expired.<br/>
<br/>
Some people like the chats because they&#39;re fast.<br/>
Others dislike the chats for the same reason.  Information tumbles  <br/>
over other information, and there can be two or four conversations  <br/>
going on simultaneously.<br/>
<br/>
I did want to mention there are three per week, now, though, and let  <br/>
people know who might not otherwise have heard about them.<br/>
