<div id="ygrps-yiv-2093801833"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I know from the kid-side and from seeing other <br/>
&gt; families and from my own impatient reactions in time past that I COULD make <br/>
&gt; it all <br/>
&gt; tense and horrible.  I know how to make it all tense and horrible.  And that <br/>
&gt; means I know what NOT to do.  I know how to make it pleasant and peaceful.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>For years our family went once or twice a year to stay at the beach trailer <br/>
on base.  They were basic, so it meant packing up huge amounts of &quot;stuff&quot;.  We <br/>
wanted to get there right at check-in time, there was all the closing up of <br/>
the home stuff to do, and all the remembering this and that.  <br/>
<br/>
Finally, one time while we were getting ready, I simply declared, &quot;We are on <br/>
vacation RIGHT now.&quot;  We went when we were ready - not by trying to beat the <br/>
clock.  It simply didn&#39;t matter, and we were creating tension when it didn&#39;t <br/>
need to be there.<br/>
<br/>
After that, sometimes we got there early, and took a little walk on the beach <br/>
before we checked in.  Sometimes we were much later - and it simply didn&#39;t <br/>
matter.<br/>
<br/>
Now I travel with other adult friends to dance weekends and other things.  I <br/>
tell them we are &quot;on vacation NOW&quot;, and then it doesn&#39;t matter if someone is <br/>
running late in the carpool and they seem to enjoy the change in focus.  <br/>
<br/>
That shift has eased lots of situations to make them fun instead of tense.  <br/>
It seems so easy and obvious, but the contrast before and after making that <br/>
shift is amazing!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It took us at least four years of never leaving &quot;on time&quot; for our vacations<br/>
(usually road trips) to finally think that maybe we were setting ourselves<br/>
up. In our better times, the usually stressing plan to leave at 7am (which<br/>
inevitably ends up being 12pm) is dropped for the more relaxed and exciting<br/>
plan of taking our time, making sure we have what we want, and going out the<br/>
door. Then we find out what our REAL departure time is :). What do we miss<br/>
with this plan? Hard to say, but it can&#39;t be much because we were living and<br/>
enjoying the moment!<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t work so well when we have to catch a flight, but that&#39;s when we<br/>
find out we really DON&#39;T have to have everything packed that we think we do,<br/>
or HAVE to take a shower before we leave, or nowadays, even HAVE to have the<br/>
plane ticket in tow :)<br/>
