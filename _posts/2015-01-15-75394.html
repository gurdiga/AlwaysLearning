<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059929842">The recent discussions here (prompted by Nicole&#39;s post and Sandra&#39;s <br/>
earlier Please Help:What I want for Christmas post) have me thinking <br/>
about my experiences on unschooling lists and what&#39;s been helpful to me <br/>
and what hasn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My children are currently aged 16, 14, and 12.  I was introduced to the <br/>
concept of unschooling by Jan Hunt after talking with her about my <br/>
struggles with Oak Meadow, a Waldorf-like curriculum. I was trying to do <br/>
the first year of Oak Meadow with my son when he was five.  He really <br/>
wasn&#39;t interested, I was making us both miserable with scheduled sit <br/>
down lessons on letters, and I wanted to find other options to this <br/>
homeschooling thing.  Hearing about unschooling was a relief and felt <br/>
like an approach that would give me the freedom to respond and relate to <br/>
my child on his terms, not an outside focus.   At the same time I had <br/>
some fears and concerns to work through.    As I write this, I realize <br/>
that I have been responding to my son since he was born but ran smack <br/>
into a whole bunch of unexamined assumptions. I never really had thought <br/>
about extended nursing or co-sleeping or sling wearing or homeschooling <br/>
or unschooling.  But as I noticed what worked for him and me and what <br/>
didn&#39;t, I found those things and more.   For me, it&#39;s been a lot of <br/>
letting go of mainsteam thoughts about children and relating to children <br/>
as well as building my confidence in what I was doing.<br/>
<br/>
When I was worried about my son learning to read, other unschoolers told <br/>
me that everyone reads at different ages.  However, it felt like a leap <br/>
of faith to see what happened with my children.  I&#39;m not a fan of &quot;leaps <br/>
of faith&quot;  - I like to feel confident in what I&#39;m doing and what&#39;s <br/>
happening.   I don&#39;t mind following doing things differently but I don&#39;t <br/>
like doubting myself.    I wasn&#39;t going to try to teach him or force him <br/>
to read (as if I could), but I worried I was being negligent if he <br/>
didn&#39;t learn to read.   And yes, one day around the age of 12 he sat <br/>
down one week and read a Percy Jackson novel.   He asked questions that <br/>
showed me was absorbing the information at a level I completely missed <br/>
myself reading the book.   I really wish I hadn&#39;t worried as much.  <br/>
Hearing other people tell me not to worry wasn&#39;t helpful.   I do wonder <br/>
if I had I engaged with Sandra and Joyce and others here,  I might have <br/>
been able to work out that concern earlier.   I wish I had.  Instead I <br/>
was on other lists that weren&#39;t helpful.<br/>
<br/>
When I started going to unschooling conferences and meeting some people <br/>
from two different unschooling lists I was on, I began to notice that <br/>
some people talked a good talk but when I met them in person and saw <br/>
them interacting with their children, I knew immediately I didn&#39;t want <br/>
to learn from them.    Likewise, meeting Kelly Lovejoy and Sandra in <br/>
person at a New Jersey conference, interacting with them, and seeing <br/>
them interact with others there also made a huge impression on me.    In <br/>
fact it was a five minute conversation between Sandra and her daughter <br/>
that impacted me the most.  And since then I&#39;ve selectively read <br/>
Sandra&#39;s list and facebook group with a deep respect for both her <br/>
experience and also her and the moderators&#39; questioning of the writers&#39; <br/>
thinking and words.<br/>
<br/>
[As a side note and with a bit of a red-face,  let me share that when I <br/>
first was on one of Sandra&#39;s lists years ago, I left in a huff when she <br/>
challenged me about &quot;magical thinking&quot;.    I&#39;m really glad that I grew <br/>
to understand why that was a concern and that I made my way back to <br/>
learn some more.]<br/>
<br/>
I still don&#39;t understand all of the points made here.  I am still <br/>
deliberately making new choices that make our home a better place to <br/>
be.  For example, just this week I played Far Cry 4 after reading Alex&#39;s <br/>
post about how different it is to play vs. watch her child playing.   <br/>
She&#39;s right - it was fun!   I even tried to take out a bear and had no <br/>
problem shooting the bad guys.  It was quite gratifying actually.  I own <br/>
real guns myself, used to target shoot, and have no desire to ever shot <br/>
anything living.    Shooting a bear in a game won&#39;t change that.   And I <br/>
have a renewed appreciation for my son&#39;s skill at video games.  He <br/>
blasted through a mission in five minutes that I was absolutely horrible <br/>
at.<br/>
<br/>
I debated about sending this post - am I clear and does it add value?  I <br/>
hope so.  The point I am convey is thatI learned from experience that <br/>
that these discussion can be helpful but only if I use them to look at <br/>
my own actions.  Hearing how others do things can help but only if I <br/>
make changes for myself.   And that just because someone writes <br/>
something authoritatively doesn&#39;t mean they have the experience or <br/>
&quot;success&quot; to back it up.<br/>
And to admit I was wrong all those years ago when I left in a huff ... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Sandra and Joyce and Pam and others for your incredible <br/>
patience in dealing with folks who send you rude emails offline.  My <br/>
family and I have benefited from your commitment to sharing and helping <br/>
others grow and learn about unschooling and I am really glad you keep <br/>
this list available.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211021738"><html><head></head><div><div></div><div>I totally agree with Deborah post and could relate on a number of levels.</div><div><br></div><div>I too came from a history of attachment parenting which led to homeschooling but the Waldorf kind and I too tried oak meadow which totally didn&#39;t work without the misery of some kind of coercion to make lessons happen. Awful. I was also taken aback and felt huffy during some of my early experiences on this list a year ago but I chose to stay (luckily I wasn&#39;t asked to leave!) because of Sandra&#39;s and others&#39; authenticity, clarity, honesty and the lack of fluff which was a relief after being on many fluffy lists and forums (even though I like hugs, I am not sure they help much online!) In the end online fluff doesn&#39;t help much. All I chose to do was to get out of my own way and allow the words to sink in without being defensive or precious about the assumptions I had previously held to he true. So I too only hang out on this list now and reluctant to involve myself in other unschooling discussions because I have found this philosophy to be so easily misconstrued and misunderstood. I find this list and the picking apart of words/phrases to be very helpful in challenging my own thoughts.</div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp;I too don&#39;t understand many aspects and I despair when my eldest daughter claims to be bored and I wonder what I am doing wrong and why this doesn&#39;t seem to be working yet after removing many of our previously tight limits and how can I facilitate four individuals learning when they are all needing something different from me at the same time and in conflict with one another. ... I have a long long way to go to be able to come here and talk about how happily and freely learning we all are... but the point is that I choose to come and read this list alone and I am enormously grateful for it and the time Sandra and the moderators and experienced &nbsp;others who freely give their time to facilitate our learning.&nbsp;</div></div></html></div>
