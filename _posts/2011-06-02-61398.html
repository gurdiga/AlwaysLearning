<div id="ygrps-yiv-1016892063">I have a friend who just recently got a diagnosis of Down&#39;s Syndrome for her child. She is understandably shocked and concerned. The situation is also made more complicated by the differing information she&#39;s getting from different sources - at this point, in the &quot;therapy&quot; area and other things that conflict with her unschooling and respectful parenting... She and her husband are feeling rather overwhelmed with all the new information, details, plans to be made and conflicting information. If  there is anyone who has experience in this area, who would be willing to share their knowledge offlist, could you please e-mail me (Sanguinegirl83 @ aol.com) or contact me on FB (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1073164716)">http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=1073164716)</a> with your contact information?

<br/>
New information diagnosing a child that already has symptoms shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
shocking.  Descriptive, yes.  The best advice that I can give is to calm down <br/>
and relax.  Their child is still right there, unchanged, needing the same time <br/>
and attention that they needed before the diagnosis confirmed a specific set of <br/>
descriptors.  Unschooling will only be different in the same way that it&#39;s <br/>
different for EVERY child.  Every child is different with different needs, and <br/>
just like you would help a child read when they can&#39;t yet, you do things for a <br/>
child with Down&#39;s Syndrome that they can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It might be a new diagnosis, but the child isn&#39;t new and the symptoms aren&#39;t <br/>
new, it merely adds to what they know about their child.   Breathe, relax, look <br/>
directly at your child and help them in the best way that you can in each <br/>
moment.  That will be the case for EVERY child!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1459819840">De, is this a dx in utero or has the child already been born?<br/>
<br/>
I have a long-lost unschooling friend whose (4th, I think) child had  <br/>
Down&#39;s Syndrome. Their lives were richer because of that little girl.  <br/>
I could see if I could reconnect with her, if you&#39;re having trouble  <br/>
finding more info.<br/>

<br/>
Good point!  I had wondered this as well.... Down Syndrome is pretty obvious <br/>
once a child is born, but the way it was phrased about therapy and how it <br/>
conflicts with respectful parenting made me question.  It was confusing... <br/>
<br/>
***Their lives were richer because of that little girl.***<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that from so many parents of children with Down Syndrome!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1666854017">Unfortunately I can&#39;t help with the unschooling aspect but I can suggest a woman in Guam named Helen Middlebrooke who homeschools her daughter with Down Syndrome. She also has a site called teachingdownsyndrome.com. She may be able to provide information. <br/>
<br/>
I can however say, since my third child has Down Syndrome as well as autism, that despite all the worries and concerns that your friend will experience (especially in the beginning), that child will bring more love into her family than she could ever believe. Having a sibling who is &#39;different&#39; will also help her other children become better people in this world, with more compassion and understanding for others who have challenges to overcome. It&#39;s a tough road, but one that I wouldn&#39;t have missed for the world...<br/>

Warm regards,<br/>
