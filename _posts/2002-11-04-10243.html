 </span></blockquote>YES!!<br/>
But who would play Jaime?<br/>
and claire?<br/>
Hugh Grant could play the Vicker&#39;s foster son (from the later books)<br/>
I don&#39;t know, I don&#39;t think it could be as good as the books.<br/>
When is the next one coming out?<br/>
Elissa<br/>
ps I don&#39;t think they&#39;ll really die in 1776. I think it&#39;s another fake like <br/>
Jaime&#39;s grave stone at Culloden. I think they stage it and run off together <br/>
to live in the woods.<br/>
I hope I hope I hope<br/>
