<div id="ygrps-yiv-47410910">My oldest daughter called nursing &quot;mum&quot; and she continued to want mum until<br/>
she was about five years old. She&#39;s now an extremely independent<br/>
21-year-old. Her sister, three years younger, called it &quot;nuss&quot; (not exactly<br/>
that, but I can&#39;t figure out how to write it phonetically--kind of &quot;no us&quot;<br/>
said quickly) &#39;cause she couldn&#39;t say her r&#39;s very well. Tandom nursing was,<br/>
most of the time, an incredible joy. The girls would play with each other&#39;s<br/>
hands and often fall asleep entwined.<br/>
<br/>
I *love* this: my friend&#39;s sister&#39;s little girl calls nursing &quot;the girls&quot;,<br/>
as in &quot;I&#39;m hungry--I want the girls&quot;.<br/>

&quot;Train wreck&quot; was my very thought when I chose to just close the page without <br/>
reading all the details.  But I found some happier stuff there, to support my <br/>
theory that in general in the U.S. Jews are better parents than Christians.  <br/>
I was torn up (an attempt was made) for saying that, but I persevered, and <br/>
spoke with Richard Prystowsky  about it some in Sacramento (the whole talk <br/>
wasn&#39;t on that, but it touched on that), and today I found a LOVELY defense <br/>
of my argument, and posted it at www.unschooling.com!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The woman my daughter takes an animal science class from who also breeds<br/>
cats and dogs (among some more exotic creatures) says they end up swallowing<br/>
the milk teeth so that&#39;s why we don&#39;t see them laying around and assume they<br/>
never lose them. I guess the tooth fairies for cats and dogs don&#39;t have as<br/>
nearly a pleasant a job as tooth fairies for humans. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the stages of development for wolves:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*    10 - 13 days: the eyes open<br/>
*    3 weeks: the milk teeth appear, they start to explore the den<br/>
*    4 - 5 weeks: short trips outside the den, begin to eat meat<br/>
*    6 weeks: moving up to a mile from the den (with adult wolf)<br/>
*    6 - 8 weeks: pups are weaned, traveling to rendezvous site.<br/>
*    12 weeks: begin to travel with the pack on hunts (with adult wolves)<br/>
*    15 - 28 weeks: milk teeth are replaced<br/>
*    7 - 8 months: begin to hunt with the pack<br/>
<br/>
So the milk teeth appear shortly before they begin solid food. But they wean<br/>
quite a bit before the permanent teeth appear.<br/>
<br/>
Katherine Dettwyler makes a good point that there&#39;s too much cultural<br/>
interference to determine when it&#39;s natural for humans to wean. She looked<br/>
at (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.prairienet.org/laleche/detwean.html)">http://www.prairienet.org/laleche/detwean.html)</a> various animals,<br/>
including apes, and various factors (like body weight at weaning compared to<br/>
adult weight, age of permanent teeth and so forth) and came up with a range<br/>
from 2.5 to 7 years for weaning.<br/>
