<div id="ygrps-yiv-649675131">This is like the PBS pledge drive moment--those outside the U.S. maybe  <br/>
be unfamiliar, which is fine :-)<br/>
<br/>
Lee Stranahan&#39;s working on a DVD presentation of unschooling.  He&#39;s  <br/>
interviewed me three times and there will be more, and some other  <br/>
people.  (Those three youtube bits are from the first of the three  <br/>
interviews thusfar.)<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to get some of the raw video as he&#39;s working on it and  <br/>
also assist with the initial funding, here&#39;s the way to do that, and  <br/>
it&#39;s funded through Amazon.com.  If you make a pledge, it won&#39;t be  <br/>
charged to your account unless the total passes the goal of $250.<br/>
