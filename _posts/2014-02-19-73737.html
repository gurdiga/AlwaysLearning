<div style="FONT-SIZE:12pt;FONT-FAMILY:'Calibri';COLOR:#000000;">
<div>My mother in law likes to send my daughter (9) long messages on her iPad,
and has expressed concern (to my husband) that my daughter only answers in one
or two words. Any thoughts on how we can handle this? I’m not concerned about my
daughter’s writing, and I personally think that her responses are more
personality driven (mother in law’s messages tend to be long and wordy, while my
daughter tends to be brief and to the point). </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>While I’m writing, my mother in law has also twice now decided to give my
daughter ‘jobs’ that she offers to pay her for. Some of these are within her
capabilities (making a rainbow loom bracelet), other’s aren’t (like asking a
beginning crocheter to join squares crocheted by her mother). I’m not sure how
to handle these both directly to my mother in law, and to my daughter later on.
I don’t want to be pushing my daughter to do these things, but nor do I want
more responses from my mother in law about how my daughter isn’t being
responsible or something.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>(In case this isn’t clear in my messages, I have a long history of issues
with my mother in law being controlling of my husband, and our relationship, so
this probably colours my reactions. I’m trying not to let it.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

more responses from my mother in law about how my daughter isn&rsquo;t being 
responsible or something.&gt;&gt;</div></blockquote><div><br>I think you should let these be between your daughter and mil and stop trying to control what your mil is going to think. So what if she thinks your daughter is irresponsible? If she doesn&#39;t say it to you or her, then it doesn&#39;t matter. If she does, then smile and say, casually, &quot;Oh, she&#39;s really just fine for her age. I&#39;m not worried.&quot;&nbsp;<br>

<br>When my mil lived with us, she used to criticize me (my housekeeping and cooking and the way I was with our little children) to my husband. But she didn&#39;t complain to me. I told him to just keep it to himself and then she and I got along great.&nbsp;<br>

<br>If you have a mil who is critical or tends to complain about things, you probably need to toughen up and not be responsive except in a light and casual way. If she&#39;s critical, she&#39;ll find things to criticize anyway so you&#39;re wasting your attention and brain power to even think about it and try to head it off.<br>

I wouldn&#39;t dream of cutting it unless he wanted to.&quot; Things like that have had a disarming effect on her, even if they don&#39;t change her mind (or stop her from finding new, less direct ways of saying the same thing).</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">I had no relationship with any of my grand parents at all as a child, so I have found gratitude in that my in-laws want to be a part of their grandchildren&#39;s lives. &nbsp;They love them and care about them. &nbsp;Yes their attempts at control and meddling cause me stress- but the stress is mine, and blaming it on them was very counter productive for my happiness. &nbsp;I&#39;m learning how to maintain my own peace around the issues that come up (and often, that means calming down enough to know when I can let go of what my mother in law is doing and let her be, and when it&#39;s beneficial to set a boundary). &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">And if she&#39;s not telling *you* all these things, but just your husband, consider that something to be grateful for. &nbsp;It won&#39;t help foster peace in *your* family, if you&#39;re worrying about your husband&#39;s interactions with his mother. &nbsp;</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">I was thinking too, though, does your husband share his mother&#39;s concerns? &nbsp;Is that why he shares it with you? &nbsp;That was an issue for my husband. &nbsp;His mother&#39;s criticisms made him feel worried and like we needed to be doing things differently with the boys. &nbsp;Sometimes we did. &nbsp;When he would tell me something like that, I&#39;d ask, &#39;well, what do you think is best?&#39; Or, I&#39;d say it the way I saw it, &quot;You feel like it might be more important to keep your mom happy, than for Josh to be happy?&quot; (This was about whether or not to cut my son&#39;s hair). &nbsp;Putting things in perspective without judgement helps my husband make choices that make sense for him, not feeling like he has to do what his parents say he does, or what his wife says he does.</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></div><div><font face="Calibri" size="3"><span style="line-height:20px;">I was fed up with my mother in law&#39;s attempts to control my husband long before he was fed up with it. &nbsp;I stopped being fed up, started being supportive of my boys and what they wanted and what makes them happy, and I did that for my husband too. &nbsp;It gave everyone in my home relief, even though my mother in law is still as controlling as ever. &nbsp;</span></font></div><div><br></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">Lisa C</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Calibri;font-size:16px;line-height:20px;">&nbsp;</span></div><div><br></div></div>
