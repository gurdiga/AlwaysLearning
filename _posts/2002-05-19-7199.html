&gt;  Why would the infection appear anywhere there was elastic?<br/>
&gt;My mother occasionally used to complain about chiggers as she scratched <br/>
&gt;under the elastic waistband of her pants. I didn&#39;t think we had chiggers <br/>
&gt;up north and assumed something else was bothering her, but now I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;thinking she knew what she was talking about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have lots of experience with chiggers, both in the Chicago suburbs <br/>
where I spent my first 11 years, and in Arkansas after that.  Chiggers <br/>
are drawn to the warmth of the blood flow, I think, and wherever elastic <br/>
is constricting, blood flow is heating up the skin. Your mother talked <br/>
about chiggers, but if she didn&#39;t have really noticeable red bumps with <br/>
tiny little red dots in the center, she didn&#39;t have chiggers.  You can&#39;t <br/>
mistake a chigger bite, especially after you&#39;ve been covered in them <br/>
like I was once at National Guard summer camp (forced to sit in the <br/>
woods in the dark for hours when I *knew* there were chiggers out there).  <br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;ll bite just any old place.  My boys got chiggers a lot in <br/>
their private places, but as a girl, I never did.  Warm and tight places <br/>
are what they seem to prefer.  Like ticks.  <br/>
<br/>
All the remedies I&#39;ve ever known about were either toxic (taking a bath <br/>
in a high ratio of bleach to water) or a means of suffocation of the <br/>
chigger.  That tiny little bottle of stuff was no match for the number <br/>
of chiggers I had that one time!  I opted for the bleach, knowing how <br/>
dangerous it was, because I was in terrible shape!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the uproar about ticks, though.  You see one, you <br/>
pull it out.  Simple as that.  Of course, you should see check if it&#39;s <br/>
evenly spaced from 8 others!  lol.<br/>

Here on the East coast Ticks carry Lyme Disease. If not caught in time it<br/>
can be chronic and somewhat debilitating. If caught in time, it take a MONTH<br/>
course of Antibiotic treatment which might work. The bigger ticks don&#39;t<br/>
carry it, it&#39;s the miniscule Deer tick, which is just a little bigger than<br/>
thie period at the end of this sentance.<br/>
