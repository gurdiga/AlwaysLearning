&gt; I see that in Pam&#39;s two older kids, but I don&#39;t see it in mine.  I think <br/>
&gt; Kirby would be happy to be put on full time at the gaming shop, take a few <br/>
&gt; classes at the university, and share an apartment with other gaming geeks.  <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; also think he might end up doing better than that, but I&#39;m pretty happy <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; the idea that it seems that would make him feel fulfilled.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wasn&#39;t really thinking only of my own kids, though. We have a pretty large <br/>
network of unschooled teens - especially in the older teens age range. And I <br/>
see a LOT of them struggling with a lot or a bit of anxiety and some with <br/>
depression.  I&#39;ve also watched a number of them sort of coming to terms with <br/>
really making decisions about their futures - really deciding to go to <br/>
college or get full-time work or whatever. And others just drift or jump &lt;G&gt; <br/>
smoothly into their next step, too. But I just don&#39;t think we should mislead <br/>
anybody into thinking that unschooling is insurance against difficult <br/>
adolescence - including anxiety or depression.<br/>
<br/>
ON THE OTHER HAND, I can only imagine that some of these kids would have had <br/>
just as hard a time and probably even MUCH worse, if they&#39;d been in school. <br/>
<br/>
And - they are truly such special kids -- my daughter and I were talking <br/>
about my niece, who is really nice and a great kid who is in high school. I <br/>
was saying that I&#39;d been asking her about a trip she took with her school, to <br/>
Catalina Island. Her responses were all about how &quot;they let us do this&quot; and <br/>
&quot;they let us do that.&quot; It was disconcerting -- my conversations with <br/>
unschooled kids do NOT include that &quot;they let us&quot; kind of stuff at all. My <br/>
niece, as bright and sweet as she is, does not even remotely have the sense <br/>
of self that any unschooled kid I know has. Their conversations are filled <br/>
with: &quot;I decided to do this&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m planning to do that.&quot; <br/>
