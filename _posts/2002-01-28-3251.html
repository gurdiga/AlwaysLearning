<div id="ygrps-yiv-785068424">On Survivor, a pseudo-reality show with one would think no redeeming values<br/>
other than mindless enjoyment, I got to watch a group of lionesses hunt down<br/>
an animal (a wildebeest? don&#39;t recall. Normal prey animal, whatever it was),<br/>
but I got to watch the angle FROM THE AIR.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen lots of nature shows of lions bringing down prey, but never from<br/>
this INCREDIBLE airborne angle that let me see the one lioness presumably<br/>
screwing up (she wasn&#39;t, but it looked that way for a minute) by not being<br/>
able to run down the prey, but then ahead you could CLEARLY see her two<br/>
team-mates waiting in the brush ahead, after the prey had been ducking and<br/>
dodging in seemingly random patterns, RIGHT where lioness #1 was driving the<br/>
prey into their waiting jaws.<br/>
<br/>
Amazing. Breath-stealing. Gorgeous. Reading about hunts in books and looking<br/>
at pictures and even seeing a  dozens of hunts from the ground view on other<br/>
tv shows was NOTHING like what I got from a minute&#39;s worth of footage on a<br/>
game show.<br/>
<br/>
Now I wish I could see a wolf pack hunt from above.<br/>

I don&#39;t think we&#39;re talking about the same thing, unless commercial<br/>
broadcast<br/>
television has improved mightily since I last tuned in.<br/>

My MIL has a daughter much younger than the rest of us (22) who was<br/>
also at this vacation house. The same evening I refer to with the tv<br/>
concern, this daughter arrived in the evening, and the MIL got very angry<br/>
because she felt the daughter had been out smoking pot, and warned her if<br/>
she was going to be high she could not be in her (MIL) presence, at this<br/>
vacation house (equal turf right) and eventually the daughter left the<br/>
vacation early.  It seems to me this example is one of the MIL feeling her<br/>
values were being infringed on by being exposed to something (a person who<br/>
was high) being in her presence.  Like I felt our values were infringed on<br/>
by playing the tv, knowing we did not enjoy it at all.  What do you think?<br/>
