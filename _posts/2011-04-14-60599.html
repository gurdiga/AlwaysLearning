<div id="ygrps-yiv-705815256">I hope this isnt considered off topic but I am sruggling a bit right now and trying to get information...<br/>
<br/>
Is there such as thing as unschool school? I know this is completely contradictory but is there any sort of school that strives to be more like unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any experience with Waldorf schools? Do they provide an unschooling atmosphere at all?  From my research it doesnt seem that way but I havent checked one out yet. It seems by 1st grade on up they do regular school learning.<br/>
<br/>
If you had to send your child to school where would you send them?<br/>
<br/>
My parents have been coming down on me really hard about homeschooling and my wife just isnt saying much (so she is just on the fence and not offering much moral support) and so I am just trying to see if there is a happy medium at all.<br/>
<br/>
I mean is there a school anywhere in this country (it would have to be a private school I suppose) that really lets kids learn at their own rate? <br/>
<br/>
Most importantly is there a school that doesnt have strict attendance or curriculum policies?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help Im just strugglin out here to keep things peaceful so I just figured Id do some research...hope this is not off topic...thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010765258">Sudbury Valley School is the closest thing to academic unschooling there is. It is NOT an unschooling school, because there is no chance to develop the type of family relationships that happen with radical unschooling. There are attendance requirements in most Sudbury Schools out there; they are creating a community of kids, and they need to know the community will be there. Also, I think all school districts have attendance requirements.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-511093744">You can read a bit about Clonlara here:  <br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://clonlara.org/">http://clonlara.org/</a>  That&#39;s their home based program<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clonlaracampus.org/">http://www.clonlaracampus.org/</a> That&#39;s their campus program.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know any more about Clonlara than what I&#39;ve read online.  I have no experience with them.  But at different times when Dylan was growing up, when it looked like our legislature was ready to pass some bill that would require homeschooling parents to have a teaching certificate, I read about Clonlara home enrollment and thought that was the way I&#39;d go, if pressed.  <br/>
<br/>
But, why is what your parents think more important than what you think about your own kids?   I understand wanting/needing to keep peace with a spouse, but parents?   Do you live with them?  Can you move away? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891702067">Thanks, Caren, for finding that link and bringing it.<br/>
<br/>
There are a few &quot;open classroom&quot; schools left.  That is academically what unschooling is. :-)<br/>
That&#39;s another thing to look up, though, to describe to your parents what is &quot;real&quot; (what people are being paid to do), if that would make them understand it any better.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The open classroom&quot; is still a classroom.<br/>
<br/>
Their methods and findings, though, in the absence of a classroom, become unschooling.  An environment rich in the materials needed for exploration of science, history, math, language, music and art, and a facilitator (or two or several) to help the kids use and understand the materials and to find other resources... that&#39;s the open classroom.  Without the record keeping.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard (vaguely--couldn&#39;t tell you when or from whom) that it&#39;s become a little more structured over the years than it used to be, but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693169981">I&#39;m not sure if everything works the same in the US, but our oldest daughter, 15, is registered for the third year in a row with the Clonlara office here in Spain. In a country where homeschooling, not to mention unschooling, is controversial at best, it REALLY helped smooth things over with my in-laws when we took our daughter out of the public school system. After reading the suggested curriculum folder Clonlara sent (which we never used for anything other than that), my mother-in-law said something like, &quot;Well, it&#39;s pretty complete.&quot; And that was that. I have to send in a report of what she&#39;s doing and grades (decided on by my daughter and me) to her tutor, but so far, there haven&#39;t been any required projects, reading, tests or anything. We didn&#39;t start out unschooling, but gradually moved towards it, so it was great to have the freedom to make that transition while still being able to show the in-laws and social services the official looking papers that made them feel more at ease. Having said all of that, we won&#39;t be signing her up for another year. It served its purpose, but it is rather expensive for us and right now she really doesn&#39;t care about a high school diploma. We&#39;re more confident about it all now, plus she only has one more year with the possiblity of problems with the authorities. If she changes her mind, we&#39;ll sign her up again, but for now we&#39;d rather spend the money taking her to places she wants to visit. <br/>

<br/>
Not for the most part - you&#39;ll want to visit Any school to see for yourself, though. Look at any *classical* montessori programs, and also any university schools. Some of the last open classrooms (beyond early childhood ed) are in university lab schools.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There are laws, you see, that mandate attendence, specifically. Too many absences and teachers frequently have a legal obligation to report you to the local children&#39;s services. <br/>
<br/>
Now and then I hear about homeschoolers doing a kind of &quot;dual enrollment&quot; where they&#39;re registered as homeschoolers but take some classes - art or gym or whatever. If you can arrange it, its a way to avoid attendance issues with the school, but not all districts will have that option. <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://secondfoundationschool.wordpress.com/">http://secondfoundationschool.wordpress.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I have an unschoolling friend that read a lot about those  and thought it would <br/>
be a good idea for her son.<br/>
She went to visit and realzed it was not at all like unschooling but still a <br/>
good option if she had to send him to school.<br/>
<br/>
I also sugest you take your spouse and even parents to the next <br/>
homeschooling Conference that MHA  ( Minnesota Homeschool Alliance)in September.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861742198">My niece has always struggled in her traditional (private) school. Last<br/>
September I started researching options for her and found a local free<br/>
school. I went to orientation/family night as support for her & her family.<br/>
I was very impressed with what I saw & heard. Obviously, it isn&#39;t<br/>
unschooling, but it is working very well for her.<br/>
<br/>
If I had to send my kids to a school & I had the money to do so, I&#39;d send<br/>
them there. Of course, with our income that isn&#39;t going to happen, lol. And<br/>
if I had that much extra money laying around, I&#39;d use it for travel or<br/>
something else we could all do together.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-116987898">In Portland, Oregon I think we have a few sources that might be considered along the lines of unschooling but in the middle:<br/>
On is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://villagefreeschool.org/">http://villagefreeschool.org/</a><br/>
<br/>
My girls attend classes at www.villagehome.org but this is not a school per se but caters to the many diverse home schooling options while offering a wide variety of classes from academic to electives in a very small ratio, non-testing, and FUN fashion.  My kids are thriving here and the village home model may be being replicated elsewhere--Lori Walker the founder would know that.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your search--just remember that this is part of the journey and usually if you follow your gut, you are headed in the right direction.<br/>
