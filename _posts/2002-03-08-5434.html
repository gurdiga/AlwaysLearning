<br/>
The HSC---California&#39;s homeschooling conference---their website is up, but <br/>
not finished. It&#39;s in August.<br/>
<br/>
The SC Unschooling conference---Live & Learn---is in ...well....South <br/>
Carolina. That website should be available next week, and also not quite <br/>
finished---we&#39;ll both be adding on for a while. It&#39;s in October.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra&#39;s speaking at both. CA&#39;s is in Sacramento and is 11 years old. SC&#39;s is <br/>
in Columbia, and it&#39;s our first year.<br/>
