 </span></blockquote>It seems it should be that easy! But it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
What we believe to be true comes from an amalgamation of a lifetime  <br/>
of hundreds of ideas that we&#39;ve heard and accepted. One new idea can  <br/>
rarely wipe out a lifetime of old ideas, no matter how contradictory  <br/>
they seem, no matter how often we see it happen on TV ;-)<br/>
<br/>
What will help is examining *why* you feel as you do about TV and  <br/>
video games. What are the &quot;truths&quot; that you have in your head about  <br/>
them? Do they make kids lazy? Are they a useless waste of time? Are  <br/>
they artificial experiences? Do they present violence and sex in  <br/>
attractive ways that will influence your children?<br/>
<br/>
Take those ideas out and examine them. Expose them to the light of day.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of the common ones have been covered at:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe it would help to use different words than &quot;uncensored/ <br/>
unrestricted?&quot; Maybe &quot;mindful watching/playing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are you coming from an always unschooled place or would you be  <br/>
lifting previous restrictions? If the latter, you might want to go a  <br/>
little slower with the process.<br/>
<br/>
Those &quot;un&quot; words don&#39;t mean that there is no communication between  <br/>
you and your kids about those topics. Read or re-read Joyce and  <br/>
Sandra&#39;s websites on these topics and see how the ideas are rooted in  <br/>
trust and ongoing discussion.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637641508">At the heart of unschooling is trust. It is trusting that all children, generally, and your children, specifically, are able to glean what they need from the world without curriculum, without being directed by others, without having to achieve at aptitude tests.  It is also trusting that their interests are valuable, that if your child is interested in something it must have inherent value, even if you don&#39;t see it. <br/>
<br/>
If you have decided that in your home, in your life, and in your children&#39;s lives (while they live under your roof) that you cannot trust them to not be &quot;sucked in&quot; to television or video games, then you are not trusting in your children&#39;s interests fully. You are also seeing television as a powerful mesmerizer that will lure your children down a very scary path. <br/>
<br/>
I think if you have passionately embraced unschooling, which is an amazing thing to do, you should be able to take this step as well. Look at television for what it is, free it from the baggage that you&#39;ve given it. It isn&#39;t the opiate of the masses. It is a window, but it is only one of many windows that you can look at the world through. And if you see it as such, and treat it as such, so will your children.<br/>

I can give you two links that might help you piece this together, if  <br/>
you&#39;ll read them.  (They&#39;re not as long as that TV section, really!)<br/>
<br/>
One is about living by principles:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/rules">http://sandradodd.com/rules</a><br/>
<br/>
The other is about language.  The reason I recommend it is because  <br/>
you used the words &quot;uncensored&quot; and &quot;unrestricted.&quot;<br/>
