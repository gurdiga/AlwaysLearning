<div id="ygrps-yiv-356318435">I run a free bookstore locally, and we gave up on shelves for the<br/>
children&#39;s books very quickly. We have a few big bins (standard clear<br/>
sterilite style) on the floor along a wall that the books get put in<br/>
and every now and then a volunteer straightens them so the books are<br/>
all facing out and easy to flip through. We found it much easier to<br/>
keep them neat and accessible, plus books won&#39;t be harmed if they&#39;re<br/>
tossed into a bin now and then.<br/>
<br/>
At home we have a magazine table (lots of skinny shelves all the way<br/>
across) that we rotate our books (from the bigger shelves) through<br/>
pretty regularly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-940865057">It&#39;s not always possible, but I find it&#39;s easier to keep them shelved when<br/>
the shelves aren&#39;t full. Sort of like the public library model of half-full<br/>
shelving. We also keep current favorites just sitting on the table so that<br/>
they can be easily retrieved.<br/>

Baskets for each of us.  Things we like or others might think we like.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have the shelving space for all our books so the baskets have made<br/>
the collection more user friendly. It also helps keep them off the floor in<br/>
the kids rooms.  Trying to navigate piles of books on the floor is one of my<br/>
issues and having a basket to toss them into has made a huge difference for<br/>
me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684065177">Hello Verna,<br/>
<br/>
We found some great book storage boxes in a skip in front of a children&#39;s<br/>
library. I suppose it would be possible to buy them somewhere. The books are<br/>
really easily accessible for dd (3 1/2) from there from the top. We also<br/>
have various book baskets around the house, sometimes sorted into themes or<br/>
borrowed ones, etc..<br/>
<br/>
I gues I have been lurking for far too long. I suppose I should also<br/>
introduce myself. We are home educating our dd in South Wales (UK) and I am<br/>
trying to soak up as much info on unschooling, radical unschooling as I can.<br/>
I am still deschooling myself from my school time as a pupil but also from<br/>
my school time as a secondary school teacher. The latter is probably the<br/>
more difficult one.<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoy reading the posts.<br/>
