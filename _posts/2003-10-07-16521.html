<div id="ygrps-yiv-1586909416">Please help me with some wise words and what you all do in these situations. <br/>
<br/>
As a pre-unschooler ;) we spend a lot of time at parks and around children of all ages and temperaments. We are having a very difficult time with one particular child at our park days. This child is VERY physically aggressive (age 4 1/2). His mother is very passive with his assaults and usually talks to the other child (who has been assaulted physically) explaining why her child attacked. The mother tends to talk to other peoples kids about the aggression more then talking to her child about why it isn&#39;t okay to punch someone when they are frustrated, etc. I imagine to her own child it is kind of like rationalizing his behavior? I don&#39;t know? <br/>
<br/>
I tend to not interfere a whole lot when my daughter is playing unless someone is being physically harmed or the play seems to be getting especially vicious. I usually try to nip it before the escalation happens with some distraction. I say *usually* because I also have a 1 yr old who also needs my attention. I don&#39;t *see* everything that happens like I did when I only had my dd to watch. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess what I am asking is has anyone had a situation like this where a child in a group is predictably unpredictable and actually has the other kids in the group afraid to play with them? What should I do? Should I talk to the mom and if so what would I say? I know kids go through bouts of aggression, but this is something entirely different. We have known this kid for a few years now and my daughter just doesn&#39;t seem to like him (she has actually asked me if she *has* to be his friend). I have told her that I don&#39;t like everyone in our group either, but I&#39;m not intentionally mean to them if I don&#39;t like them. I have a hard time myself with confrontation, I tend to just kind of stay away from people I don&#39;t care for rather then taking the bull by the horns. What can I do to help her when this child is at the park and she doesn&#39;t want to play with him? The mom always tells the kids that they shouldn&#39;t exclude him, yet he is a force to be reckoned with and most of the other kids just kind of always run away from him which further aggravates his frustration & aggression. :( <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You could stay  nearer her, and be within arm&#39;s reach with that other child <br/>
is near, and if he looks about to strike, just grab his arm and say DON&#39;T.  <br/>
Play nice.  And if he calms, cool.  If not, lead him to his mom and say &quot;He was <br/>
hitting&quot; and leave him there.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The mom always tells the kids that they shouldn&#39;t exclude him, yet he is a <br/>

away from him which further aggravates his frustration & aggression. :( <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You could recommend to that mom that she follow along to be nearer to him so <br/>
he doesn&#39;t get physical.  <br/>
<br/>
If the moms are sitting and talking, and you see him at a distance getting <br/>
frustrated, you could just tell her &quot;Brutus is getting frustrated&quot; and point.   <br/>
If she doesn&#39;t get up, you could.<br/>
<br/>
If it were me, I&#39;d talk to her.  <br/>
If I were too shy, I&#39;d talk to other moms and figure out who COULD talk to <br/>
her, or whether the group could go together and present their concerns.<br/>
<br/>
A group here split in two (last I heard; might be worse now) over a kid/mom <br/>
combo like that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-674746382">Keeping in mind the dynamic of the group, and the Mom&#39;s place in the group, you might be able to talk to her yourself, or it might be better done by someone close to her, if you aren&#39;t really that close to her yourself.<br/>
 <br/>
And sometimes, even when confronted, such a problem doesn&#39;t get solved in a group in a way that will satisfy everyone.  In that case, you can stay close to your child or help her to be more successful in playing with that child. You can also give her the choice to exclude that child from her play.  If his Mom won&#39;t help him to learn new ways to get along, sometimes the only way for a child to learn that is to be excluded by his peers until he gets it that his behavior won&#39;t be tolerated.<br/>
 <br/>
I recently chose to leave a group because of a situation like yours where my child was the favorite victim, but is so accommodating there was no way for me to make a fuss without upsetting my own kid.  He insisted on minimizing what was happening, and was learning to push down his own feelings.  It just wasn&#39;t happy with the social dynamic that was developing for my son and didn&#39;t see any way to fix it, so I chose to leave to protect him.  We&#39;ve since seen others make the same choice, and the problem child continues to enjoy his status in that group while several of us have made other play arrangements.  Just keep an eye on any signs your daughter is learning poor choices from being required to be nice to a child who isn&#39;t nice to her (or anyone else apparently) and remember what you want her to gain from this group, why you joined in the first place.<br/>

mom and if so what would I say?<br/>
Yes, this happens over and over again no matter where I go (seems like).  <br/>
Since the mom seems to not be handling it your satisfaction (which also happens <br/>
over and over), I&#39;d trade on my relationship with the child himself.  In other <br/>
words, I would deal directly with the child, exactly as I would if he were my <br/>
own, or as if we were best of friends or related or something.  I justify this <br/>
(in case the parent gets irate) by the fact that since I go to park day, too, <br/>
I have a relationship with the child of some kind.  I like to exercise <br/>
integrity in my relationships, and I like to protect my own children.  So, I would <br/>
do what I could to talk this kid into not doing what he likes to do to my kid.  <br/>
<br/>
At the very least, I would provide a human shield between my kid and this <br/>
kid, standing very nearby, acting nonchalant, even if it means I can&#39;t chat with <br/>
other parents or do my knitting or whatever I meant to do while I was there.  <br/>
I&#39;m not going to follow the kid around and protect *other* kids, unless it&#39;s <br/>
convenient to do so.  I&#39;m not opposed to watching like a hawk and stopping a <br/>
weapon from behind as it&#39;s raised over my child, or placing a hand on the child <br/>
to get his attention while saying *something* discouraging about the behavior <br/>
on my kid&#39;s behalf.  Not shaming or yelling or anything like that.  Simply <br/>
saying, &quot;don&#39;t hit him&quot; or &quot;that hurts, please stop&quot;, and then stand there to <br/>
make sure it does stop.  I have been known to draw the attention of other parents <br/>
to the impending victimhood of their child, as well.  Eventually the kid gets <br/>
the message that he won&#39;t be able to get away with his bullying around me, <br/>
and they end up avoiding me and my kid or, if we&#39;re lucky, changing his <br/>
behavior.    <br/>
<br/>
I have found that some of these parents really are at a loss, or they&#39;re <br/>
overwhelmed by other children or circumstances, or they can&#39;t see a problem, and <br/>
so under the auspices of protecting my child, I model for them the behavior I <br/>
want to see them use with their child.  I have noticed that parents who I have <br/>
modeled for long term, with whom I am friends, actually begin to do the same <br/>
things eventually.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s indirect influence, but sometimes that&#39;s not enough.  In those cases, <br/>
you have to decide whether the park day or activity is worth it to you, or if <br/>
the behavior is really serious, and you have take on the parent more directly.  <br/>
All the best ideas about dealing with people will be needed and it won&#39;t be <br/>
easy or quick.  Feelings might be hurt.  But something&#39;s got to give at this <br/>
point, so what is there to lose?<br/>
<br/>
This actually happened in our group and a couple of years later the parent in <br/>
question *thanked* us for helping her see her son&#39;s behavior through other&#39;s <br/>
eyes.  That child is now successfully in an alternative type school (not that <br/>
that&#39;s a goal), and we never would have thought that could happen when he was <br/>
younger.  He was pretty wild.  <br/>
<br/>
I think having compassion for the child and the parent is first, and if you <br/>
can have that welcoming response with them that Retta explained so beautifully, <br/>
it can go a long way towards smoothing things over.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2101280650">Ticia<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I&#39;m answering different because I know you and your daughter.  <br/>
First, Chloe (am I going to get in trouble for using her name?) doesn&#39;t <br/>
have to play with anyone she doesn&#39;t want to play with.  (ends in <br/>
preposition, can&#39;t change it).  She can choose her friends.  That&#39;s one <br/>
of the joys of homeschooling.  She can&#39;t be mean to him, but she <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have to play with him.  If she was in school she&#39;d have to <br/>
&quot;get along with everyone.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Second, if this boy is there, I&#39;d be right with Chloe all the time.  If <br/>
he&#39;s close to her, I&#39;d be just as close.  If I hear the situation <br/>
esculating I would step in and talk to the child.  He&#39;s 4 1/2, he&#39;s <br/>
getting the message from mom that he&#39;s not responsible for his behavior <br/>
and that others need to change their behaviors to fit his needs,--not <br/>
true and not good messages.  I&#39;d tell him that when he&#39;s mean, no one <br/>
wants to be with him, and then I&#39;d help C find something else to do.  <br/>
Short and sweet before mom comes over. <br/>
<br/>
Third, I&#39;d teach C to be more assertive.  In this world our children, <br/>
but especially our girls, need to be strong assertive women.  Help her <br/>
practice the words &quot;when you are mean to me I don&#39;t want to play with <br/>
you or be around you.  If you are nice to me I will play with you.  If <br/>
you are mean, I will leave.&quot;  Have them say them to you in your backyard <br/>
in a mock situation.  Have her stand up for herself.  Pair her with <br/>
another little child (Lexie?  we need to come play anyway) who is really <br/>
good at being assertive and saying those things, so she can model.  <br/>
Lexie will tell him right off and she&#39;ll protect C and Janene. <br/>
<br/>
Sadly there are people out there who think that boys acting like this is <br/>
normal and accetable.  Boys will be boys, right?   If mom isn&#39;t telling <br/>
him that his behavior is not acceptable, then Chloe certainly has a <br/>
right to do so--and she needs to learn to do so.  Standing up now to the <br/>
childthat hits will help her stand up the to the child that says &quot;but if <br/>
I don&#39;t have sex my balls will fall off&quot; or some other outragious <br/>
statement.  So often as a little girl I (and other little girls )were <br/>
told to be quiet and still and meek and mild.  Not for my girls.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1598470236">Hi Joylyn!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to jump in here too, since we&#39;re smack dab in the middle of <br/>
this situation as well, and Gavin is usually on the receiving end of <br/>
these attacks. Your advice is great, except that with this boy...it <br/>
won&#39;t work. All of the tools that I have armed Gavin with (walking <br/>
away, finding someone else to play with, telling the person that it&#39;s <br/>
not okay to hurt him, etc.) to get him out of a bad situation, have <br/>
gotten him pounced on by this boy. If you ignore him or tell him that <br/>
what he is doing is mean, he will attack you!!!!! The mom then <br/>
focuses the attention on the attacked child and tells them what they <br/>
did wrong and why he felt the need to be physical with them. Usually <br/>
she blames it on him being excluded...but what the heck am I supposed <br/>
to tell my son...go ahead...play with that little kid who freaks out <br/>
and attacks you when things don&#39;t go his way. <br/>
<br/>
He is one of those kids that kind of looks right through you when you <br/>
are talking to him, and to be honest...he scares me too! One day he <br/>
hit me with a stick to get my attention, I had the baby in my arms, <br/>
and luckily he missed him. <br/>
<br/>
I think that Sandra was right in her post, she needs to be talked to <br/>
directly about this because I don&#39;t think that anything else will <br/>
work in this case. It&#39;s becoming a safety issue for the other kids in <br/>
the group and by not talking to her in order to spare her feelings, I <br/>
am putting her first and my kids second...my wonderful husband <br/>
pointed this out to me last night ;) Of course, talking to her is <br/>
easier said than done. <br/>
<br/>
Brandy...new to posting to the list, but I&#39;ve been enjoying the <br/>
discussions for a while :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532054161">I have to agree here.<br/>
When we first moved here, we met the family down the street - <br/>
The boys down the street (they&#39;ve since moved) were terrible. Of course, when I met them, the mom was over here - had to meet me, had to &#39;see my home - just to make sure&#39; They seemed like a nice, normal family. Little did I know they could have inspired Stephan King!<br/>
Her kids;<br/>
stole Brianna&#39;s fairy dust (that was in her treasure box) and when they got to his house - he took it out & poured it down the drain - in front of her)<br/>
Mom & I talked - she talked to her son & gave him time out.<br/>
<br/>
A few days later, Brianna came screaming home - SCREAMING - home (sorry - just making a point)<br/>
the younger son had hit her in the face with an Elmo doll.<br/>
Her adult front tooth was/is badly chipped.<br/>
Mom said &quot;She has other teeth&quot;<br/>
&quot;He didn&#39;t mean to break her tooth, he was just hitting her in the face.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not a big thing - she isn&#39;t a model or anything like that.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve given him 5 minutes time out - it&#39;s over.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They tormented the animals in the neighborhood.<br/>
They stole bikes.<br/>
They pulled up gardens.<br/>
<br/>
Her older son (the mean thief) was in Brianna&#39;s room in public school - he was always &#39;almost&#39; hitting her (and the others - he was the class bully)<br/>
The teacher &#39;didn&#39;t see him&#39; - so she couldn&#39;t do anything about it.<br/>
Finally I told him to stop hitting her. He told me that there was nothing I could do about it. I told him I would call the police.<br/>
He told his parents.<br/>
They tried to have me arrested for verbal child abuse.<br/>
<br/>
When a police officer, the parents & I met in the principles office - we went through what was happening in school - &quot;Boys will be boys.&quot; (East Prov. P.O.) I then informed them that Brianna was going to be taught to defend herself - &quot;Two wrongs don&#39;t make a right&quot; (East Providence Police officer)<br/>
When we talked of the boy shoving Brianna&#39;s friend down and laying on top of her ( on her back) - I was told that was innocent.<br/>
When I said I would take whatever measures necessary and that what he did was abuse and assault - I was told that 7 y.o.s don&#39;t commit crimes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When these people moved out of the neighborhood - entire families were literally applauding!!<br/>
<br/>
Do not let that boy near your kid. I made the mistake of thinking that if a parent was &#39;near-by&#39; or dealing w/ it - there would be an improvement in the situation - hence, Brianna has a broken tooth.<br/>
FYI - she&#39;s had two caps and a root canal - it&#39;s going to have to be replaced with an implant (around here - we&#39;re talking $2,000 - now - never mind when she&#39;s old enough to get one!)<br/>

  Ticia<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe I&#39;m answering different because I know you and your daughter.  <br/>
  First, Chloe (am I going to get in trouble for using her name?) doesn&#39;t <br/>
  have to play with anyone she doesn&#39;t want to play with.  (ends in <br/>
  preposition, can&#39;t change it).  She can choose her friends.  That&#39;s one <br/>
  of the joys of homeschooling.  She can&#39;t be mean to him, but she <br/>
  shouldn&#39;t have to play with him.  If she was in school she&#39;d have to <br/>
  &quot;get along with everyone.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
  Second, if this boy is there, I&#39;d be right with Chloe all the time.  If <br/>
  he&#39;s close to her, I&#39;d be just as close.  If I hear the situation <br/>
  esculating I would step in and talk to the child.  He&#39;s 4 1/2, he&#39;s <br/>
  getting the message from mom that he&#39;s not responsible for his behavior <br/>
  and that others need to change their behaviors to fit his needs,--not <br/>
  true and not good messages.  I&#39;d tell him that when he&#39;s mean, no one <br/>
  wants to be with him, and then I&#39;d help C find something else to do.  <br/>
  Short and sweet before mom comes over. <br/>
<br/>
  Third, I&#39;d teach C to be more assertive.  In this world our children, <br/>
  but especially our girls, need to be strong assertive women.  Help her <br/>
  practice the words &quot;when you are mean to me I don&#39;t want to play with <br/>
  you or be around you.  If you are nice to me I will play with you.  If <br/>
  you are mean, I will leave.&quot;  Have them say them to you in your backyard <br/>
  in a mock situation.  Have her stand up for herself.  Pair her with <br/>
  another little child (Lexie?  we need to come play anyway) who is really <br/>
  good at being assertive and saying those things, so she can model.  <br/>
  Lexie will tell him right off and she&#39;ll protect C and Janene. <br/>
<br/>
  Sadly there are people out there who think that boys acting like this is <br/>
  normal and accetable.  Boys will be boys, right?   If mom isn&#39;t telling <br/>
  him that his behavior is not acceptable, then Chloe certainly has a <br/>
  right to do so--and she needs to learn to do so.  Standing up now to the <br/>
  childthat hits will help her stand up the to the child that says &quot;but if <br/>
  I don&#39;t have sex my balls will fall off&quot; or some other outragious <br/>
  statement.  So often as a little girl I (and other little girls )were <br/>
  told to be quiet and still and meek and mild.  Not for my girls.<br/>

  &gt; Please help me with some wise words and what you all do in these <br/>
  &gt; situations.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; As a pre-unschooler ;) we spend a lot of time at parks and around <br/>
  &gt; children of all ages and temperaments. We are having a very difficult <br/>
  &gt; time with one particular child at our park days. This child is VERY <br/>
  &gt; physically aggressive (age 4 1/2). His mother is very passive with his <br/>
  &gt; assaults and usually talks to the other child (who has been assaulted <br/>
  &gt; physically) explaining why her child attacked. The mother tends to <br/>
  &gt; talk to other peoples kids about the aggression more then talking to <br/>
  &gt; her child about why it isn&#39;t okay to punch someone when they are <br/>
  &gt; frustrated, etc. I imagine to her own child it is kind of like <br/>
  &gt; rationalizing his behavior? I don&#39;t know?<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; I tend to not interfere a whole lot when my daughter is playing unless <br/>
  &gt; someone is being physically harmed or the play seems to be getting <br/>
  &gt; especially vicious. I usually try to nip it before the escalation <br/>
  &gt; happens with some distraction. I say *usually* because I also have a 1 <br/>
  &gt; yr old who also needs my attention. I don&#39;t *see* everything that <br/>
  &gt; happens like I did when I only had my dd to watch.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt; So I guess what I am asking is has anyone had a situation like this <br/>
  &gt; where a child in a group is predictably unpredictable and actually has <br/>
  &gt; the other kids in the group afraid to play with them? What should I <br/>
  &gt; do? Should I talk to the mom and if so what would I say? I know kids <br/>
  &gt; go through bouts of aggression, but this is something entirely <br/>
  &gt; different. We have known this kid for a few years now and my daughter <br/>
  &gt; just doesn&#39;t seem to like him (she has actually asked me if she *has* <br/>
  &gt; to be his friend). I have told her that I don&#39;t like everyone in our <br/>
  &gt; group either, but I&#39;m not intentionally mean to them if I don&#39;t like <br/>
  &gt; them. I have a hard time myself with confrontation, I tend to just <br/>
  &gt; kind of stay away from people I don&#39;t care for rather then taking the <br/>
  &gt; bull by the horns. What can I do to help her when this child is at the <br/>
  &gt; park and she doesn&#39;t want to play with him? The mom always tells the <br/>
  &gt; kids that they shouldn&#39;t exclude him, yet he is a force to be reckoned <br/>
  &gt; with and most of the other kids just kind of always run away from him <br/>
  &gt; which further aggravates his frustration & aggression. :(<br/>

When I found out the kid in the OP was only 4-1/2, I had hope.  Lots of 4 & 5 <br/>
yo boys are kinda violent and aggressive.  They don&#39;t have words or other <br/>
options for their frustration, yet.  It seems stronger at that age.  But it needs <br/>
to be controlled so other people are safe.  <br/>
<br/>
If it was an 8 yo or even a 6 yo, I&#39;d definitely be more willing to make the <br/>
mom aware that the behavior would get them excluded.  But a 4 or 5...I&#39;d talk <br/>
to her, but not kick her out.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m with Sandra...I&#39;m more willing to exclude the offending family than <br/>
disband a group over it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I look at how the parent is handling the child&#39;s behavior and whether I <br/>
think the parent can learn from observing the other parents.  If I <br/>
think that the parent is open to learning ways to respond that will, <br/>
eventually, lead to improvement - then I counsel my kids and friends to <br/>
be tolerant and helpful. It has paid off - there are people we consider <br/>
dear friends whose kids had difficulties at various times over the <br/>
years. There are others we&#39;ve cut off contact with whose kids grew up, <br/>
from what we hear through the grapevine, to be even worse as older kids <br/>
and teens than they were as young kids. It was predictable, given the <br/>
parents&#39; behaviors, and I&#39;m glad that we didn&#39;t engage in futile <br/>
efforts to help (for too long, anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Homeschool groups are there for support and friendship - but they won&#39;t <br/>
be good places for that if bullying is allowed. Better for one family <br/>
to find some place else to hang out then for a group to not be the warm <br/>
nurturing place it could be without them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d get a few parents together - take the mom off by yourselves - tell <br/>
her that you feel that the group is not right for her and that her son <br/>
isn&#39;t fitting in well. If she argues - and if you can&#39;t fully resist <br/>
the arguments - say that if she really thinks it IS right for them, <br/>
then she needs to stay with her son every minute AND stop talking to <br/>
the OTHER kids and focus on her own son&#39;s behavior only. Say, &quot;You must <br/>
be right with your son at all times. Do not talk to our children or <br/>
have contact with them in any other way, deal only with your own son.&quot; <br/>
Those are the only conditions under which I&#39;d let her stay. And I&#39;d be <br/>
really really clear and blunt. Remember - you do not have to worry <br/>
about hurting her feelings - she isn&#39;t worrying about your children <br/>
being hurt.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll leave.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;ll say bad things about you to other people here and there.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll have such a nicer group to relax in and enjoy that you won&#39;t <br/>
care.<br/>

  &gt;Mom said &quot;She has other teeth&quot;<br/>
  &gt;&quot;He didn&#39;t mean to break her tooth, he was just hitting her in the face.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;&quot;It&#39;s not a big thing - she isn&#39;t a model or anything like that.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;&quot;I&#39;ve given him 5 minutes time out - it&#39;s over.&quot;<br/>
  &gt;ay yi yi.  I want to run screaming from the room!!!!<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  &gt;I&#39;m so glad they moved.  That kid is a psychopath.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  But too bad for the people in his new neighbourhood.  Yikes!<br/>

&lt;&lt; I think that Sandra was right in her post, she needs to be talked to <br/>
<br/>
directly about this because I don&#39;t think that anything else will <br/>
<br/>
work in this case. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that sometimes this is an inherited lack of social <br/>
cluefulness, and the mom might not understand even after a million words any better than <br/>
she understands right now.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; It&#39;s becoming a safety issue for the other kids in <br/>
<br/>
the group and by not talking to her in order to spare her feelings, I <br/>
<br/>
am putting her first and my kids second...my wonderful husband <br/>
<br/>
pointed this out to me last night ;)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Hugely true.<br/>
Smart husband!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if it turns out people are too afraid of an in-person exchange, a <br/>
letter could be composed from the group or some part of the group saying if she&#39;s <br/>
unwilling to see the problem she should keep him home for another year or two <br/>
until he&#39;s better able to hang out with other kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried not to say &quot;never again&quot; with my kids or about other kids, but <br/>
&quot;maybe when he&#39;s older,&quot; and it&#39;s turned out that many friendships which were <br/>
rough or rejectable years ago became reasonable and good later as one or both <br/>
matured.  And a few which were good earlier didn&#39;t last because one matured or <br/>
calcified or got reactionary or whatever happens.  But with older kids, it&#39;s <br/>
easier for them to see and decide what they don&#39;t want to mess with.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Of course, talking to her is <br/>
<br/>
easier said than done. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you want to write her a letter, I have some suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Run it by people who know her and her child so they can suggest additions.  <br/>
Put it all in one package, rather than expecting there to be another pass.  <br/>
Even if she doesn&#39;t change and hang out with you guys it will (WILL) improve her <br/>
interface with the next group she joins.  No matter how much she might want to <br/>
deny the situation, the seeds will be planted for someday.<br/>
<br/>
You could run the draft by here and we could help you smooth it, if you <br/>
wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Make it so clean that you wouldn&#39;t be embarrassed if it ended up being <br/>
published in the local paper.  The woman MIGHT spread it around, so make it tightly <br/>
and directly about her son and your concern for his future and the maintenance <br/>
of the current group, so that if she shows it around it would make her look <br/>
bad and you look good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121991449"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;......with this boy...it won&#39;t work. All of the<br/>
&gt;tools that I have armed Gavin with (walking <br/>
&gt;away, finding someone else to play with, telling the<br/>
&gt;person that it&#39;s not okay to hurt him, etc.) to get<br/>
&gt;him out of a bad situation, have gotten him pounced<br/>
&gt;on by this boy. If you ignore him or tell him that <br/>
&gt;what he is doing is mean, he will attack you!!!!!<br/>
&gt;The mom then focuses the attention on the attacked<br/>
&gt;child and tells them what they did wrong and why he<br/>
&gt;felt the need to be physical with them. Usually <br/>
&gt;she blames it on him being excluded...He is one of<br/>
&gt;those kids that kind of looks right through you when<br/>
&gt;you are talking to him, and to be honest...he scares<br/>
&gt;me too! One day he hit me with a stick to get my<br/>
&gt;attention, <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yikes!<br/>
It sounds to me like we have a kid with some serious<br/>
inability to understand morality and/or so much self<br/>
absorption that he thinks nothing of hurting everyone<br/>
around him to get his way.  Mom is exacerbating the<br/>
problem by pandering to the little emperor and<br/>
justifying his behavior.  This whole family needs some<br/>
intervention, but you unfortunately can&#39;t really do<br/>
anything about it.  I agree that the best you can do<br/>
for them and yourselves is present her with your<br/>
obervations/concerns/feelings regaring both HER and<br/>
her son&#39;s behaviors and hope that when she storms off<br/>
in a huff, or goes sobbingly away (whatever her style<br/>
of martyrdom is) that maybe she will take some of your<br/>
lessons to heart after time has worn the sting away<br/>
from them.  <br/>
<br/>
For her son&#39;s sake and the rest of society&#39;s sake I<br/>
hope so.  At 4 he is scary, what will he be at 14, at<br/>
24?  There has to be something to check the snowballng<br/>
progress of a monster in the making or we all may pay<br/>
the price.  When you shy from &quot;hurting her feelings&quot;<br/>
think about saving people from being victimized by<br/>
what this child could grow into.  It&#39;s a public<br/>
service, honestly.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1051145209">Janis I can&#39;t agree with you more. I really believed the parents of the <br/>
children that we harassing pour son would do something but I too also got the same <br/>
&quot;kids will be kids&quot; from the parents, the principal, even the police. Shortly <br/>
before the kids hurt Chris we hired a lawyer to pursue our sons rights to a <br/>
peaceful education. Things got real bad. The school started to accuse me of <br/>
harassment, if Chris was out sick they tried to charge truancy and on and on and <br/>
on. I told them that if these kids didn&#39;t stop our son may get up enough <br/>
courage and deck em! But I was just told that he would be expelled from school. <br/>
Expelled for protecting himself? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Do not let that boy near your kid. I made the mistake of thinking that if a <br/>
parent was &#39;near-by&#39; or dealing w/ it - there would be an improvement in the <br/>
situation - hence, Brianna has a broken tooth.<br/>
<br/>
FYI - she&#39;s had two caps and a root canal - it&#39;s going to have to be replaced <br/>
with an implant (around here - we&#39;re talking $2,000 - now - never mind when <br/>
she&#39;s old enough to get one!)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made that mistake and Christopher paid for it. I wouldn&#39;t let that boy near <br/>
that kid either. BTW, we sued the school, the board of Education and the city <br/>
afterwards and won. Christopher really wanted to donate the money to charity <br/>
so that&#39;s where it went. As for his injuries, his hearing has returned to <br/>
normal but his eyesight is still bad and he still has some loss of memory. I think <br/>
maybe that its more that he doesn&#39;t want to remember than can&#39;t. He&#39;s really <br/>
coming along good with wanting to be around teens again and even gets together <br/>
with 2 of them he knows once in a while but I can see it&#39;s still a fear he <br/>
has.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661595757">Don&#39;t have much time tonight to give a lengthy post, but it *is* me <br/>
Joylyn :) and of course I don&#39;t mind that you used her name I use it <br/>
everyday. I don&#39;t feel that I *ever* articulate anything through e-<br/>
mail as I intend, but I try. Anyhow, I don&#39;t think that Chloe has a <br/>
problem being assertive. She has changed so much in this past year <br/>
that you would be shocked I&#39;m sure. You are right; I don&#39;t hang <br/>
around people I don&#39;t have much in common with so she shouldn&#39;t <br/>
*have to* either. Brandy added some great clarifying commentary so I <br/>
won&#39;t go on and on. Basically I needed a sounding board and some <br/>
great feedback (which I believe I got). <br/>
<br/>
We will have to update you all when we see them next and have a <br/>
little word with her. What did I just babble?? I mean...ah um...an <br/>
update on how we try to handle this situation will follow. <br/>
Whatever...I&#39;m going to rest this glupity brain.<br/>

&gt; Maybe I&#39;m answering different because I know you and your <br/>
daughter.  <br/>
&gt; First, Chloe (am I going to get in trouble for using her name?) <br/>
doesn&#39;t <br/>
&gt; have to play with anyone she doesn&#39;t want to play with.  (ends in <br/>
&gt; preposition, can&#39;t change it).  She can choose her friends.  <br/>
That&#39;s one <br/>
&gt; of the joys of homeschooling.  She can&#39;t be mean to him, but she <br/>
&gt; shouldn&#39;t have to play with him.  If she was in school she&#39;d have <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &quot;get along with everyone.&quot; <br/>
&gt; &gt; ps, when did you join this list?  Did I know you were on it and <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; forgot?  Or have I completely lost my brain and you aren&#39;t the <br/>
same <br/>
&gt; Ticia I thought you are/were? <br/>
