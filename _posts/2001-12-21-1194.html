<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193584409">Hi Pam, Jacli here :)<br/>
I have to agree with you.  When my daughter was about 3 she<br/>
was on a tremendous amount<br/>
of medication and hormone therapies and one of the side<br/>
effects was the tendency to fly into a <br/>
rage.  She had temper tantrums that would bring down the<br/>
house!  But I made it clear to her that<br/>
that sort of behavior wasn&#39;t acceptable. Period.  If we<br/>
were in a store and she made a scene about <br/>
something she wanted she learned that when I said No I<br/>
meant No and if she didn&#39;t quiet down and behave not only<br/>
did I  not get her what she had begged for I put EVERYTHING<br/>
back.  I wasn&#39;t hard or soft on her.  I was honest and firm<br/>
and constant with her.  There are boundaries to the way we<br/>
deal and interact with others  and a correct time and place<br/>
for a good many things.  I taught her <br/>
that politeness and courtesy and respect were modes of<br/>
behavior that I expected from myself and from her all the<br/>
time.<br/>
