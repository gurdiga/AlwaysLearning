<div id="ygrps-yiv-1467300734">my daughter kina (16), her girlfriend lani (18) and their new friend<br/>
laura from paris, who they met at not back to school camp this year,<br/>
are hatching plans for a huge adventure through europe this coming<br/>
spring (2012).<br/>
<br/>
i am thrilled for them, though also a bit wistful that i didn&#39;t get it<br/>
together to plan a trip for me and my daughter to do  a european trip<br/>
together for her first time.  c&#39;est la vie, and i will definitely plan<br/>
something for just the two of us before she&#39;s gone from our home and<br/>
less available for such adventures.<br/>
<br/>
at the moment they are planning more than 2 months worth of travel,<br/>
with 8 countries:  france, spain, italy, austria, germany,<br/>
czechoslovakia, the netherlands, and england.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;ve been to europe, but it was 27 years ago!  before the berlin wall<br/>
came down :O<br/>
<br/>
they are marginally experienced in international travel - lani and<br/>
kina went on a 7 week trip to south america with Unschool Adventures<br/>
this past winter, but haven&#39;t traveled entirely on their own  much<br/>
yet, and certainly not through many countries.<br/>
<br/>
this is a big letting go for me, one of many to come (and several<br/>
passed already), and i am working to be a great resource, to share her<br/>
excitement, and to not make it about my own loss  or my worst case<br/>
scenario fears (which is, at times, challenging :)), but i think i am<br/>
mostly succeeding.<br/>
<br/>
would love discussion about that process/similar experiences any of<br/>
you might have had with older unschoolers, as well as offlist contact<br/>
from anyone who lives in europe and might welcome travelers for couch<br/>
surfing, or who have tips or recommendations for places to stay/things<br/>
to consider/ways to save money on their trip.    <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:lylaw@...">lylaw@...</a> for<br/>
offlist connection please.  but any discussion related to the<br/>
unschooling aspects of this post would be great onlist, i am thinking<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
warmly, lyla</div>
