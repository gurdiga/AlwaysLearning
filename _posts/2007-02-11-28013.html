  When Jayn was newborn, James and I would do what I suspect many <br/>
parents<br/>
  do, and wake up in the night to check that she was still breathing. <br/>
She was so<br/>
 tiny and breathed so quietly that even sleeping next to her we couldn&#39;t<br/>
 always hear her, so we would put a hand on her to feel the movement as<br/>
 gently as possible to not disturb her. Eventually she grew bigger and<br/>
  older and we were able to let go of our anxiety and trust that she was <br/>
breathing<br/>
 and get on with just appreciating how beautiful she was.<br/>
  Coming to Unschooling is a bit like that. At first you may feel the <br/>
need<br/>
  to check that your child is learning, so try to do it without <br/>
disturbing her.<br/>
  Eventually - or probably quickly - it will become abundantly clear <br/>
that<br/>
  she is learning and you can let go of that checking, and just <br/>
appreciate herwonder.<br/>

I meant to respond the first time it came through. I immediately <br/>
thought of the opposite:<br/>
<br/>
Checking on the learning too often looks more like Shirley McLain in <br/>
Terms of Endearment. Not only was the baby in another bed in another <br/>
room---so how could she really know from way in the next room?  But she <br/>
doesn&#39;t hear/see her daughter breathing, so she frantically pinches <br/>
her, wakes her, and then walks away happy while the baby screams her <br/>
head off.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah---try not to do that! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Great analogy, Robyn!<br/>
