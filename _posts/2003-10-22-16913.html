<div id="ygrps-yiv-155437412">My 7 YO son has started ignoring me.  I&#39;m used to him being impulsive and <br/>
distractable, but now he is doing whatever he wants even after consulting me.  It <br/>
doesn&#39;t help that all the neighborhood kids act this way.<br/>
<br/>
The issue at hand is that he wants to play in the front yard.  I think he is <br/>
waiting for the school bus, but has no concept of time (went outside this <br/>
morning at ten to look for it).  I am uncomfortable with him in the front by <br/>
himself for several reasons, including it is a busy street and he is just now <br/>
becoming traffic savvy.  Today, he asked me if he could go outside and ride his <br/>
scooter, I said to please go in the back (we have a basketball court a few houses <br/>
down that is great for riding) because I needed to do some things inside and <br/>
that we would go out front in a bit.  I went to look for him and he was in the <br/>
front, way down the street.  This has been happening over and over.  He has <br/>
also started going outside without telling me.  This time I took his scooter <br/>
and locked it up, and told him to stay in the house the rest of the day without <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
As I am writing this, the kids are home early from school.  He was putting <br/>
his shoes on to go out.  I said he was staying in today.  He completely doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand why.  I tried to tell him about being disrepectful to my needs, he <br/>
just went and sulked.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like what I did, but I don&#39;t see any natural consequences here and <br/>
I&#39;m tired of just being ignored.  Anybody have any better suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
You gave him a reasonable request, for his own safety, and not just to boss him around.  He ignored it.  He did what he wanted.  You laid down the law.  Now stick to your guns!  If you give in, he&#39;ll know you are a sucker and he&#39;ll keep doing it.  After a few days worth of  limited freedom, he&#39;ll change his ways.  But you have to be firm and not give in, and you have to be willing to let him dislike you for a little while.  <br/>
 <br/>
I know a lot of people are really into freedom and choices for their kids.  I lay down the law with safety issues, though.  It&#39;s basic protection of someone who can&#39;t take responsibility for his own safety.  When he&#39;s demonstrated his understanding, then maybe he&#39;ll get to be in the front yard.  But deliberately running off after you asked him not to and told him why is unacceptable where his safety is concerned.  This is a serious issue.    <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you feel differently.  I am sure other parents will give you lots of other choices! ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I read this and had to look at the subject line again, &quot;I thought I was<br/>
reading an &quot;Always Learning&quot; post&quot;.  I was!<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like there is a basic communication break down and my guess would<br/>
be that it stems from things like locking up his scooter.  I&#39;m wondering<br/>
why, at the age of 7, he doesn&#39;t understand your concerns for his safety.<br/>
How is the information and concern being presented to him?  Is it during the<br/>
heat of the moment when the adrenaline is still pumping?  Is it in front of<br/>
other children?<br/>
<br/>
The way we communicate can mean they either hear us or not.  If our method<br/>
sounds like a lecture, or is embarrassing or threatening it won&#39;t be heard.<br/>
The best time for me to get these messages across to Jonathan (almost 6) is<br/>
when we are both calm and feeling connected, like when we&#39;re snuggling.<br/>
He&#39;s open to me and even my emotions, he understands that it scares me and<br/>
why and the message sticks.  If I tell him at the time of the event, even<br/>
calmly, I know it has to be repeated later so he can absorb my words.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I think taking away things and limiting freedom only lead to<br/>
mistrust on his part.  He will probably be thinking that you don&#39;t respect<br/>
his needs or trust him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-131898723">Me too. I also think that re-evaluating what you can drop so that you can go<br/>
and do the things that are important to him is a good starting point in this<br/>
situation. If you are paying bills, leave them on the desk and go outside<br/>
with him. Ask him to help you mix up the rest of the bread dough and set it<br/>
to rise and then you can both go outside. Make your backyard inviting, put<br/>
out snacks, and invite the other neighborhood kids over to your place, along<br/>
with their parents if they&#39;re so inclined.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about choices in what and when and how to learn. I don&#39;t<br/>
think unschooling flourishes in a household where being aided and abetted in<br/>
carrying out his choices aren&#39;t part of the rest of the child&#39;s life, too.<br/>

&gt; He&#39;s made his bed...let him lie in it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of unschooling is about love, trust, choice, helping each other to live<br/>
in a kind and joyful household. Those things don&#39;t flourish when a parent<br/>
uses their power to intentionally not help their kids, as is suggested in<br/>
this statement.<br/>
<br/>
A child can&#39;t learn to respect people and be kind to them if he isn&#39;t<br/>
treated with respect and kindness first. That&#39;s just physics.<br/>

problem many times with her boy.  How many times can he do it and it <br/>
is still okay? At what point is he not respecting her? How many <br/>
times is too many?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618655433">I find that when I take things away from our 7 year old, things spiral <br/>
downward with his behavior.  If we spend more time talking calmly and <br/>
very specifically about the problems we are encountering and how he is <br/>
disrespecting realistic rules for his safety, it seems to work much <br/>
better.  His friend across the street loses his Nintendo, his bike, and <br/>
other things when he misbehaves.  I heard him tell my son the other day <br/>
that he couldn&#39;t wait until he was old enough to move out so his mom <br/>
couldn&#39;t take away his stuff anymore.  He&#39;s 5.  I would be horrified if <br/>
my son felt that way.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, I wouldn&#39;t just let him go outside in the front of the house <br/>
unsupervised either.  Many is the time I have laid down bills that had <br/>
to be paid, left laundry unfolded or made quicker food for dinner <br/>
because the boys really wanted to do something outside that absolutely <br/>
required my supervision.  Perhaps that is why my house is never exactly <br/>
tidy and I&#39;m up until all hours of the night paying the bills sometimes. <br/>
 But if being out there with him isn&#39;t an option, perhaps he needs to be <br/>
kept in the house until he can be supervised.  He doesn&#39;t have to be <br/>
punished, just kept in. When I had pneumonia this summer and could not <br/>
chase them all over the neighborhood, they just had to be inside, like <br/>
it or not.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what I&#39;m hearing most of all is that it is apparent he is <br/>
absolutely not getting the reason for this rule.  He is also not getting <br/>
that the rules of the other kids in the neighborhood do not necessarily <br/>
apply to him.  I&#39;m just critical enough about the parenting of others as <br/>
to tell my sons directly that I don&#39;t think the mother down the street <br/>
does a very good job, and if her children are wandering around the <br/>
neighborhood unattended, that isn&#39;t something to be envied but rather to <br/>
be pitied as clearly their parents do not give enough of a darn about <br/>
their children and their behavior to watch over them well and protect <br/>
them from themselves and others.  I try not to be too snipey, but I do <br/>
want them to know that sometimes good parents make difficult choices for <br/>
their kids when they are too young to be making absolutely every call <br/>
for themselves.  I explain to them that while I like them to be free to <br/>
roam and enjoy the outdoors, kids their age need an adult around for <br/>
protection.  I think your boy needs to understand very clearly why you <br/>
don&#39;t want him in front of the house with the scooter, if at all.  It <br/>
might take lots of discussion, but it seems that is the core of the problem.<br/>
<br/>
Was that disjointed enough for you?  My own 7 year old has been in and <br/>
out several times while I was writing this.  :o)<br/>

with Holly in one respect.  Some freedoms need to be limited for the <br/>
safety of children.  I absolutely will not let my 3 & 7 year old sons go <br/>
outside the house without an adult present.  There is too much danger in <br/>
this world.  <br/>
<br/>
Now not to go on too much of a rant here, but cases in point from our <br/>
own neighborhood:<br/>
<br/>
    The two year old neighbor girl was hit by a car that took off last<br/>
    year.   Because she was totally unsupervised, it is hard to tell how<br/>
    long she laid in the road before my boys and I came out and found<br/>
    her, seriously injured.  <br/>
<br/>
    Another child was kidnapped from his front yard not long ago. This<br/>
    was in a very affluent neighborhood not far from our middle class<br/>
    world.  He has not yet  made it home.  <br/>
<br/>
    Our small and generally considered to be safe community houses 7<br/>
    level three registered sex offenders.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly every community, even the absolutely best ones, has its <br/>
molesters, bullies, and other dangers out there.  My boys are just not <br/>
old enough to be dealing with things like that on their own.  You can <br/>
have that stranger danger talk with them all you want, but even the most <br/>
savvy 7 year old can be overpowered by an adult or a teenager.  <br/>
<br/>
My two cents on this likely to be hot topic.<br/>

There are more options than punishment or complete disregard for a child&#39;s<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-758868719">For some reason, my email is acting up and yahoo is not sending me <br/>
everything, so I can&#39;t respond properly to all the points made.<br/>
<br/>
I will clear these things up, though.  I did not freak out and take <br/>
his scooter away.  I said calmly, I have asked you over and over to <br/>
wait for me to come outside.  I&#39;m putting this away for a bit so you <br/>
won&#39;t be tempted.  I then told him to stay inside the rest of the day, <br/>
this part I regret.  My son leans towards special needs and is not <br/>
very verbal, taking away the scooter was done to get his attention, <br/>
not to be malicious.  (by the way, my DH always requires more dramatic <br/>
approaches...asking rarely gets me anywhere). We have been dealing <br/>
with this for at least two weeks now, everytime I say nicely I want <br/>
him inside or the back when he is without me.  By the way, there is no <br/>
way to keep him inside if he is inclined to go out...another reason I <br/>
took the scooter.  We did go out as a family today and did several <br/>
things he is very fond of.<br/>
<br/>
I do spend tons of time outside with him.  Today, he got up early so I <br/>
didn&#39;t have time to do my stuff.  I was attempting to get breakfast <br/>
(it was noon, no one had eaten yet) and not an unreasonable, nor <br/>
non-unschooling request to wait for me or play someplace more <br/>
appropriate.  He has waited many times, and knows I live up to my <br/>
word.<br/>
<br/>
My big issue is that this is new behavior.  I&#39;m not used to him <br/>
deliberately doing things after being told something else.  He has <br/>
never been an easy child and we have worked very hard to create a <br/>
happy and respect</div>

<br/>
It certainly complicates things for you that he isn&#39;t very verbal and <br/>
cannot really tell you what is going on. One thing, if I might ask - - <br/>
why is it that there is no way to keep him inside if he is inclined to <br/>
go out?  Is there anything you can do to change that?  I can keep my 7 <br/>
year old in the house.  I don&#39;t mean just by telling him not to go out, <br/>
which does work most of the time, but it might not sometime, when I <br/>
least expect it.  I mean, I can physically make it so he cannot go <br/>
outside.  I have high hook and eye locks on my screen doors, so even it <br/>
he gets the inside doors open, he cannot get the screen open.  I don&#39;t <br/>
use them all the time, lest you all think my kids are going to die in a <br/>
fire because they cannot get out of the house, but when I cannot be in <br/>
immediately control of what they are doing for a period of time, I will <br/>
put them on just in case.  I guess it also assures that if my son&#39;s <br/>
reason lapses and he opens the inside door to someone when I&#39;m out of <br/>
the room, the person cannot get in the house.  Perhaps one would hope <br/>
that a 7 year old would not become suddenly disobedient, but if he does, <br/>
I guess physically blocking his exit might be your only hope for now.<br/>
<br/>
If it is any consolation that this might just be a 7 year old thing, my <br/>
7 year old son is being particularly difficult lately as well.  He is <br/>
more argumentative, more whiney, and more difficult with his brother <br/>
lately than he has ever been in his life.  I too am searching for the <br/>
root of the problem, but am having a hard time figuring this one out <br/>
too.  He&#39;s always been my respectful and relatively obedient one. <br/>
 Lately, not so much.  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; I will clear these things up, though.  I did not freak out and take<br/>
&gt; his scooter away.  I said calmly, I have asked you over and over to<br/>
&gt; wait for me to come outside.  I&#39;m putting this away for a bit so you<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t be tempted.  I then told him to stay inside the rest of the day,<br/>
&gt; this part I regret.  My son leans towards special needs and is not<br/>
&gt; very verbal, taking away the scooter was done to get his attention,<br/>
&gt; not to be malicious.  (by the way, my DH always requires more dramatic<br/>
&gt; approaches...asking rarely gets me anywhere). We have been dealing<br/>
&gt; with this for at least two weeks now, everytime I say nicely I want<br/>
&gt; him inside or the back when he is without me.  By the way, there is no<br/>
&gt; way to keep him inside if he is inclined to go out...another reason I<br/>
&gt; took the scooter.  We did go out as a family today and did several<br/>
&gt; things he is very fond of.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I do spend tons of time outside with him.  Today, he got up early so I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t have time to do my stuff.  I was attempting to get breakfast<br/>
&gt; (it was noon, no one had eaten yet) and not an unreasonable, nor<br/>
&gt; non-unschooling request to wait for me or play someplace more<br/>
&gt; appropriate.  He has waited many times, and knows I live up to my<br/>
&gt; word.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My big issue is that this is new behavior.  I&#39;m not used to him<br/>
&gt; deliberately doing things after being told something else.  He has<br/>
&gt; never been an easy child and we have worked very hard to create a<br/>
&gt; happy and respect<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814436149">&lt;&lt;As I said before, I&#39;m not a fan of the taking away of things.  But, I am<br/>
with Holly in one respect.  Some freedoms need to be limited for the<br/>
safety of children.  I absolutely will not let my 3 & 7 year old sons go<br/>
outside the house without an adult present.  There is too much danger in<br/>
this world.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, agreed.  Here&#39;s the beauty though, my kids have never considered my<br/>
presence a limitation.  At this age they loved having me there, watching<br/>
them, being a part of their play.  I could never let them play alone in an<br/>
insecure area either but I also made it my priority to be there with them<br/>
when they wanted to be outside.  Heck, even now Lanora (13) likes me with<br/>
her, see what I started back then?<br/>

&gt;Excellent point, Tia!  I&#39;ll try.  He is not very verbal and sometimes I get<br/>
&gt;answers like &quot;i like ice cream&quot;.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could make it a game. You&#39;re going to guess why he goes out when <br/>
you&#39;ve asked him not to, and he tells you if you&#39;re right.  Make some <br/>
outlandish guesses and some realistic ones.  Or make it hot and cold.  He <br/>
tells you if you&#39;re getting warmer or colder when you guess.  Just an idea.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh, I agree with this as well.  Just because I said I don&#39;t allow them <br/>
outside without me didn&#39;t mean I go out kicking and screaming or that <br/>
they don&#39;t want me there.  I don&#39;t have to tell my boys they cannot go <br/>
outside without me.  They don&#39;t want to go outside without me.  I&#39;m <br/>
totally involved with their play, their projects, their discoveries, <br/>
etc.  The only time I ever have an issue with it is if they are really <br/>
into something and nature calls for one of us.  My 7 year old can go <br/>
into the house to go to the bathroom by himself, but the three year old <br/>
still needs some help sometimes.  And I don&#39;t want to leave them out <br/>
there without me while I go in.  They have to come in with <br/>
me...period...but just for the moment I&#39;m in the bathroom and then back <br/>
outside.  They don&#39;t like it, but they understand why they have to do <br/>
it.  We are in the city, and things can happen in a heartbeat, from the <br/>
front of the house, the back of the house, wherever.<br/>
