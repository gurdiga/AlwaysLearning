<div id="ygrps-yiv-122406379">I have a tendency to do what I call &quot;blanking out&quot;.  People will speak to me<br/>
and I catch myself not responding.  It isn&#39;t a conscious thing really, at<br/>
least not pre-meditated.  I just appear to be really enjoying the quiet<br/>
inside my head and don&#39;t want it to be interrupted.<br/>
<br/>
I am a fairly sociable person, lots of friends and activities, but since I<br/>
was a kid, I have enjoyed time to myself, to veg, to think, to just be.<br/>
When I was first married and working, I used to come home from work and grab<br/>
the dogs, head out to the pasture to let them run and my head get quiet.<br/>
Then we moved and I used to run until I couldn&#39;t hear the talking in my mind<br/>
anymore  (I don&#39;t really hallucinate :)  I just mean the running commentary<br/>
that tends to go on inside our heads).  Now with 5 kids, it is really hard<br/>
for there to ever be a time when either my own thoughts aren&#39;t going or<br/>
someone isn&#39;t asking me a question.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest will occasionally say &quot;Mom, I&#39;m talking to you.&quot;  It used to hurt<br/>
her feelings (which I feel bad about because it isn&#39;t a conscious thing) but<br/>
I explain what the deal is and then work to give her my full attention.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that sitting zazen helps tremendously, giving me that time to<br/>
&quot;be&quot;.  Sorry this is so long.<br/>
