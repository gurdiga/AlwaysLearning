<div id="ygrps-yiv-798751000">I have son who will be three in December, so I am a newbie at this and usually read the list instead of posting, but  there are so many questions here about food, I thought I would post some positive experiences we have been having.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t limit or forbid any foods.<br/>
It certainly wasn&#39;t the way we thought we would parent. We planned on only offering healthy foods, etc. etc. When I discovered Unschooling and read about how limitations can cause more desire for the forbidden fruit it made so much sense.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago we started having, for lack of a better word, &quot;issues&quot; around food.<br/>
We&#39;d give Logan food, and he would ask for something else.<br/>
He&#39;d say, &quot;I want something in the fridge&quot; <br/>
We would open the fridge door and make him offers, which he would refuse, and then he would get very upset.<br/>
My husband Paul and I kept offering other options not realizing we were overwhelming him.<br/>
<br/>
Then it clicked for me.<br/>
I would try the Monkey Platter not just as a snack concept for him, but for his meals as well. It has worked like a charm.<br/>
He has a tray type plate with pictures of monkeys on it which he loves.<br/>
Now, either I bring him his favorite foods on the tray, or I ask him what he wants on his Monkey Plate. He always includes an interesting assortment of foods from grapefruit, (his favorite food), to M & Ms. He usually eats the fruit, cheese, veggies, or meats more, and picks at the sweets.<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to things like sweets/snacks, we have a cabinet under the counter that Logan can reach. There are things like chips, pretzels, nuts, raisins, and cookies in there.<br/>
I do buy the healthier versions of most of these things when I can, (Whole Foods has a version of M&Ms) although he prefers Teddy Grahams to Annie&#39;s Natural Bunnies, so that is what we buy :)<br/>
He really enjoys telling me he is going to go to his little cabinet and get a snack.<br/>
<br/>
Last night at dinner he ate a ton of Swiss Chard, choosing it over the cookies on his platter.<br/>
<br/>
There are still melt downs, but they usually occurr if my timing is off and he is very hungry or tired before I bring him his food.<br/>
<br/>
We do have another situation that we need help with, which I will describe on another post.</div>
