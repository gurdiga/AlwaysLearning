&gt;<br/>
&gt;Could it be that that microscope will be a starting point for Will <br/>
&gt;whereas it would sit on a shelf in another home?  Could it be that it <br/>
&gt;came to Will in a way other than coincidence?  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about all that.  He hasn&#39;t touched it since.  ;)  Lots of <br/>
things sit on the shelves around here, never being touched (yet).  I <br/>
have a huge room for just that stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Lots of things sit on the shelf until a 4 yo shows up and he gets to <br/>
play with something cool.  Once or twice a year teenage girls are here <br/>
and they get down my beading box.  It only sits on the shelf until they <br/>
get here because I can&#39;t see well enough anymore to use it.  I would <br/>
never dream of giving that away, though.  I want those teenage girls to <br/>
know there are cool things to do at my house.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t own any cool homeschooling books anymore, as I&#39;ve given them all <br/>
away.   I gave them to people I knew needed them, right then. (One I <br/>
donated as a prize for a LLL conference.)  But I don&#39;t give anything <br/>
away that might be useful for my 8 yo eventually.  I still have all his <br/>
Duplo&#39;s, and the wood blocks get pulled out whenever there are babies <br/>
around.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t give away useful things just on general principle.  I keep them <br/>
until I&#39;m sure I won&#39;t need them anymore, or I give them to someone I <br/>
know needs it more than I do (or might).  And this is probably <br/>
pathological, but it gives me a thrill to know I have this stuff.  When <br/>
I hear someone say they have to leave my house in a cold downpour to go <br/>
to the store and get some tin snips to finish a project, it thrills me <br/>
to say &quot;I have a pair.  I&#39;ll go out to the shop and get them for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that all my &quot;stuff&quot; represents hope for the future. <br/>
 Most of it was acquired because of immediate need.  (I didn&#39;t go out <br/>
and buy tin snips because I thought someone *else* might need them some <br/>
day!)  But I keep it on the hope of having a need to meet, either for <br/>
myself or someone else.  Hm.  That makes me feel pretty good!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We got a plastic &quot;microscope&quot; in a kids lunch at Wendy&#39;s once. It was a <br/>
tube-thingy. We sat and looked at sugar and salt and our skin and had a great <br/>
time. Took it home and darned if it isn&#39;t one toy that has survived all three <br/>
kids and YEARS of being played with a lot.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect you are talking to a lot of people whose houses are overrun with <br/>
books - I have thousands. People who come to our house don&#39;t even KNOW how <br/>
many books there are here because there are boxes and boxes of them in our <br/>
loft and in closets and everywhere else they can be stashed. They&#39;re almost <br/>
useless to us like that and I have been (way too slowly) giving them away. It <br/>
is embarrassing to have let things get this out of hand - but it isn&#39;t being <br/>
a pack-rat - I don&#39;t have that problem. It is really just truly loving books <br/>
-- the books we own are WONDERFUL books. I also have to give them to &quot;good <br/>
homes.&quot; If I can give them to people I know, at least I can tell myself that <br/>
if I ever wanted it, I could borrow it back. That helps make the parting <br/>
easier &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>People might expect it but it might not happen and they are asking advice <br/>
about how to deal with that.<br/>
<br/>
My husband was a reluctant unschooling parent - has come around more and more <br/>
as the kids have gotten older and he sees that their options are not being <br/>
limited by not schooling them more traditionally. But he &quot;went along&quot; all <br/>
these years - didn&#39;t really &quot;support.&quot;  He went along because he trusted my <br/>
judgement, knew that I&#39;d put serious and informed thought into it, knew that <br/>
I felt strongly and he didn&#39;t. He felt worried and concerned and confused. I <br/>
tried to allay his fears by letting him in on the reasons I felt strongly <br/>
about unschooling. And I offered him books or articles to read, but he really <br/>
didn&#39;t want to spend his time learning about it, much - he knew he wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to change my mind anyway. And his fears and anxieties were minor and, <br/>
over time, were being laid to rest anyway.<br/>

No hope for the future. I turned them into scraps and<br/>
rag balls. Hope for the future!!<br/>
