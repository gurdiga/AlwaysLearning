<div id="ygrps-yiv-155031292">When the  first T-shirts came out that said &quot;I&#39;m Bart Simpson -- who the hell <br/>

***Years ago my mom, dad, and my whole family were on a vacation trip up to  <br/>
Canada, from my parent&#39;s home in northern MN.  My mom and I had split off  in <br/>
a big store - and we saw these kids&#39; shirts with a big sign that said &quot;Where  <br/>
the HELL is Thunder Bay?&quot; (We were in Thunder Bay).  We had a little  <br/>
conversation wondering who would buy a kid a shirt that said that.<br/>
 <br/>
Right after we met up with my husband, father and the kids.  Shawn was  <br/>
wearing his brand new shirt that said ---- You guessed it!  We thought it  was very <br/>
funny!<br/>

<br/>
I actually have been to Thunder Bay.   Not many other places in Canada.   <br/>
Bonfield. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In my early 20&#39;s I had a &quot;Nuke the Whales&quot; t-shirt with an elegant piece of <br/>
art.   It was funny at the time, in the context of the day.   But later people <br/>
made shirts that said &quot;Nuke a baby gay whale for Jesus&quot; and that much stuff <br/>
piled all in one pile just stunk.   No clever turn, no simplicity.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if some people with absolutely no sense of humor and not much habit <br/>
of thinking looked at that shirt and thought about real nuclear weapons and <br/>
real live whales, rather than the weird political snork it was.   Keith had one <br/>
then too, with a drawing of a bear holding a rifle, and it said &quot;Defend your <br/>
right to arm bears.&quot;    His was funny because in the SCA his heraldic charge <br/>
was a big golden bear, standing with one forepaw raised.   Kinda like the bear <br/>
in the drawing, and people who knew him knew all that.<br/>
