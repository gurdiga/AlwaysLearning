Sometimes people have a lot of legitimate reasons for<br/>
expecting the &quot;worst&quot; and don&#39;t have a lot of reasons<br/>
for expecting the best.  I used to be that way, when I<br/>
was a kid.  It takes a conscious effort to retrain the<br/>
mind and heart to look at the world a different way,<br/>
to unlearn harsh lessons, and a stubborn, pig-headed<br/>
determination NOT to be a pessimist.<br/>

<br/>
Well that comes under &quot;nicer than I thought you&#39;d be,&quot; but you&#39;re right--the <br/>
surprise might have to do with the speaker&#39;s life, not the spoken-to.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
Then would &quot;this is educational&quot; mean &quot;more educational than most things in <br/>
my life&quot;?  Because if so, that&#39;s even more reason to stop using <br/>
&quot;educational&quot;!  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that when people use the term &quot;educational&quot; (whehter they mean to or <br/>
not), they&#39;re equating it with schoolish. Educational means &quot;the kind of <br/>
stuff we did or learned or heard about in school&quot;. Therefore, lots of people <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have it in their daily lives. At least if they&#39;re lucky. Hopefully <br/>
most of us moved beyond schoolish to real learning. It&#39;s just that when the <br/>
kids come along it&#39;s back to the traditional &quot;educational&quot; mode. I agree it <br/>
has no real use in unschooling/life. It all counts. It can all teach us <br/>
something.<br/>

&gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well acutally I agree with you regarding the use (or<br/>
uselessness, as the case may be) of the term<br/>
&quot;educational.&quot;  As far as what others may have in mind<br/>
when using the word, I would think the meaning is more<br/>
like &quot;I leanred something!&quot;  Usually when someone says<br/>
a thing is &quot;educational&quot; from their personal<br/>
experience, they are really trying to share that they<br/>
learned something.  Having only learned an<br/>
understanding of the learning process in terms of<br/>
educational material presented in the appropriate<br/>
mediums and ways, they attribute the miracle of<br/>
learning to the presentation of the material, rather<br/>
than by anything the learner did (consciously or<br/>
unconsciously) to absord the material.<br/>
<br/>
So I suppose, along those lines, when someone is<br/>
referring to something as being &quot;educational&quot; in a<br/>
future sense (as in &quot;Wow, that book looks like it<br/>
would be educational&quot; or &quot;We&#39;re getting that science<br/>
kit, the one that seems like it would be really<br/>
educational&quot;) they would be referring to the fact that<br/>
they anticipate these tools to facilitate learning to<br/>
happen.  Whether this is based on personal experience<br/>
of how their children, or they themselves learn, with<br/>
what tools and what circumstances are most condusive<br/>
to their particular learning style, OR whether the<br/>
belief that a thing is educational is based on in the<br/>
box, conditioned thinking about what &quot;causes&quot; learning<br/>
to happen, is another matter.<br/>

But wasn&#39;t the original argument about advising people to take &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
out of their vocabulary and considerations?  (I&#39;m getting hazy on what the <br/>
original argument was!  But if it WAS that...)   <br/>

this mindset when they use the word &quot;educational.&quot;  I<br/>
can see that.<br/>

reasons and justifications that people have for using<br/>
the word &quot;educational&quot; not defending it&#39;s use.  Sorry<br/>
if I was not clear, I have been REALLY tired this week<br/>
and kind of foggy headed.<br/>
