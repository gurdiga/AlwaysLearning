<div id="ygrps-yiv-974464571">All of my children were baptized Lutheran.  In our church, the practice<br/>
wasn&#39;t done because the children were sinful.  In fact, it actually had<br/>
little to do with the child.  The baptism was the parents promise to God<br/>
that the child would be taught the Lord&#39;s Prayer and the Catechism.<br/>
<br/>
In fact, our church used the writings of Augustine to move away from the<br/>
&quot;rules&quot; about what is supposedly good and evil and using those to judge each<br/>
other.  Wasn&#39;t it St. Augustine who, when questioned about proper conduct<br/>
for Christians, wrote, &quot;Love God with all your heart and do as you will&quot;?<br/>

Julie--who is trying to figure out if she is still a Christian if she<br/>
follows Christ but not the Church</div>
