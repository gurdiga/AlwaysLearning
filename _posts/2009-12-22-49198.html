<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933622762">Peace to you all,<br/>
<br/>
I am Tirra-Olufemi, radical unschooler for 4 years now.  I was on a group that helped me to learn more about and apply unschooling to my life but I have not participated in that group for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Recently a friend asked people to chime in on homeschooling vs going to school.  Of course I chimed in as an unschooler.  Doing so made me think that now it is my turn to help others who are new to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I was initially highly uncertain of myself and the unschooling way of life but had to do something different in order to keep my relationship in tact with my son.<br/>
<br/>
What I can say is that what all of the unschoolers taught me is true.  I have seen evidence of the benefits of unschooling in my personal experience.<br/>
<br/>
There is a quote on the home page for this group which spoke of how much unschoolers..this group in particular...helped a parent grow personally.  The same is true for me.<br/>
<br/>
Because I took the plunge and jumped into unschooling 100%, I am a better person, too.  I now trust my OWN innate wisdom which in turns lets me trust my children&#39;s own innate wisdom<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to all unschoolers who help the new fearful parents join this life style.  <br/>
<br/>
Now...I am here to serve.  I am here to repay what was given to me.<br/>
<br/>
Peace<br/>
Tirra-Olufemi</div>

Something I learned as a teacher (a school teacher and a teacher of  <br/>
various other things like calligraphy and music and ethics over the  <br/>
years) is that answering questions and explaining things to other  <br/>
people is the way to really examine and understand it, so not only  <br/>
will it be beneficial to others for you to help answer questions but  <br/>
you&#39;ll understand it better and better yourself the more stories you  <br/>
help untangle and the more successes you read about.<br/>
<br/>
Not everyone has the ability or inclination to be really helpful, but  <br/>
for those who want to, Good!  Welcome!<br/>

That&#39;s been true for me, for sure!  The more I write, mindfully, and live what I write and think about, the better my life and the life of my kids.  There really is something about writing and really thinking about what I am writing and really examining the nooks and crannies of life, that help me see more and better how things work well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-40557602">True.  I do learn from doing. And I will say that sometimes I feel like I am in uncharted territory with my older son.  I wonder if he is happy with such a free style of learning and he says that he is.  So you are right..this will be a two way street.<br/>
