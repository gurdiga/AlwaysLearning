<div id="ygrps-yiv-1419088625">My almost 5 year old son likes to play with mulch, gravel and rocks.  I try<br/>
to find ways for him to do that on our own (playing with mulch in our yard,<br/>
going somewhere to throw rocks), and he also likes to do it when we&#39;re out<br/>
and about.  It makes me uncomfortable, and I&#39;m hoping that this list can<br/>
help me clarify my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an example from today - we went to a cool nature and science center,<br/>
where outside they have wildlife that was brought to the center for<br/>
rehabilitation.  It&#39;s an enclosed area with wire cages, enclosures and a<br/>
small pond.  There is also a small area that is all gravel with a couple of<br/>
park benches.  As soon as he saw the gravel he went over and knelt down to<br/>
play with it.  Then he stood up and started dropping it to the ground, and<br/>
doing a little bit of throwing.  I told him it wasn&#39;t ok to throw the<br/>
gravel.... and he asked why because there weren&#39;t any people around.  He<br/>
even suggested that he throw it towards the fence and away from the path<br/>
where people might be.<br/>
<br/>
I had a hard time answering the why ... usually if we&#39;re at the park and he<br/>
wants to throw mulch, I find a secluded spot for him to throw it into a<br/>
pile.  Or if we&#39;re the only ones there we have a mulch fight.<br/>
<br/>
So, is it ok for a kid to throw gravel at a public place?  If not, how would<br/>
you explain it to a four or five year old?  I ended up telling him that it&#39;s<br/>
not our gravel, and that they probably want it to look nice for other people<br/>
when they come there.  Am I being uptight about this?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-177417079">Ryan  (5) loves to throw gravel. I used to get upset when he did it in a<br/>
public place. Now I just remind him that most people don&#39;t like gravel<br/>
thrown at them and that people like to walk on it so throwing at the path is<br/>
cool. We take turns seeing how much gravel we can displace when we aim at<br/>
the path. When that game is over, we make a game of kicking the gravel into<br/>
the holes we&#39;ve made.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I still feel a little uncomfortable when other adults are around<br/>
because I feel like they disapprove of this. I try to remind myself that<br/>
this my issue and that if we leave te path the way we found it, there&#39;s no<br/>
harm in playing. If there are too many people and we&#39;re blockign the path, I<br/>
ask him if we can wait until the people have passed. This usually works just<br/>
fine. Often, it leads us to other fun games &quot;else place&quot; as Ryan calls it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I personally don&#39;t think you are being uptight. I would prevent Jayn from <br/>
throwing gravel in that situation. Probably not from just letting it fall <br/>
through her fingers though - depending on how loud it became (see below).<br/>
<br/>
Gravel costs money. If it were meant for the path, then someone else would <br/>
end up having to gather any that was off the path and return it, so throwing <br/>
towards the fence might be problematic in that way (not really having a <br/>
vision in my mind of the whole landscape). Stepping onto grass and finding <br/>
sharp bits of gravel hiding in it is never pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
In this particular case, any that ended up by accident in the wrong animal&#39;s <br/>
enclosure could be problem for the critter too for all we know. Also with <br/>
nervous and sick wild animals, the noise of the gravel hitting the fence or <br/>
ground could be alarming and harmful to their health.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that I have said to Jayn is that I&#39;d rather she not do whatever it <br/>
was because some one from the place would be likely to become alarmed and <br/>
come up and be stern with her about it. I would say that I could see that <br/>
she was doing no harm, but other people might not be able to do so, and that <br/>
they might become worried. I sometimes phrase it as a thing that a lot of <br/>
adults are made nervous by kids who appear to be out of control even when <br/>
they really aren&#39;t. I have also used the phrase, &quot;This isn&#39;t the right place <br/>
for this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think more appropriate places and safe throwing games might be in order. <br/>
Sometimes the urge to throw is very strong. At the Space Center Houston they <br/>
have a really cool throwing game inside an enclosure with quite heavy (so <br/>
they will arc in the air) but still soft dense foam balls and a number of <br/>
space targets. The kids get to throw the balls by hand in one part, and use <br/>
air powered (I think I am remembering right) guns to shoot them at the space <br/>
stuff in another. It was hugely popular and constantly full the whole time <br/>
we were there.<br/>

Not uptight enough.<br/>
<br/>
People paid money for that gravel and mulch, and they paid people to  <br/>
put it just so, and they pay people to maintain it.  It&#39;s not yours.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when you can&#39;t figure out what&#39;s good or right, go a few  <br/>
steps further, so you can see the principle instead of the rule.<br/>
<br/>
Would it be okay for him to carve his name in the wood at a public  <br/>
place?<br/>
<br/>
Would it be okay for him to break windows in a public place?<br/>
<br/>
Go out into nature somewhere where there are rocks and let him throw  <br/>
them into a lake or down a hole or small rocks at a big  rock or  <br/>
something, if it&#39;s really public land and he&#39;s not disturbing  <br/>
wildlife and that.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on your yard and your house, maybe there&#39;s  place where he  <br/>
could throw handfuls of mud onto a wall or a wooden fence and you  <br/>
could hose it off later.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t explain something to a four or five year old, just say  <br/>
no.  Part of being partners, and being on the same team, is that what  <br/>
he does you&#39;re dong too.  It&#39;s not okay for a mother and child to be  <br/>
doing something others don&#39;t want them to do (namely, the owners or  <br/>
managers of a place) and for the mom to shrug wide-eyed and point to  <br/>
the kid and say &quot;He did it.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1540050796">I think that a 4 yo old would have some difficulty distinguishing when<br/>
throwing and playing was appropriate and when it&#39;s best to leave the<br/>
landscaping alone.<br/>
My 5 yo old plays with gravel and mulch. We have our yard set up so that he<br/>
can play and explore as much as possible these and other substances without<br/>
too much concern about yard appearances. The problem occurs at out in-laws<br/>
house where the plants are more hands off and appearance reigns supreme.<br/>
They also share a long drive with three other residents (older...no kids)<br/>
and they pool funds to re-gravel the drive. My FIL can get pretty uptight<br/>
when the gravel gets trhown into the grass or handfuls of it get tossed into<br/>
the hollow tree...another fave game. We live a balancing act of allowing<br/>
some play and forbidding others while we are there. My MIL is less concerned<br/>
about the gravel but gets bothered with the mulch being thrown into the yard<br/>
or into the dog&#39;s water dish. There are some plants and bushes in some areas<br/>
of the yard that she cares less about than others and that as well makes for<br/>
some confusion. She is also more lenient with the younger grandkids than my<br/>
son...like now at 5 he should just suddenly have some yard care<br/>
sensibilities. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway my point of detailing this is that keep in mind that all these social<br/>
rules about yard property can be somewhat confusing for children...it&#39;s best<br/>
to set up as much freedom in your own home and yard and take the kids to<br/>
parks and outdoor places that are kid- explorers friendly and then explain<br/>
how there are certain public places where it is not expected that people<br/>
would play with the plants etc.<br/>

Take other things for him to play with when he&#39;s there, or go to a  <br/>

I&#39;m on your father-in-law&#39;s side, about throwing gravel into grass.<br/>

<br/>
They don&#39;t need yard care sensibilities.  They need to only throw  <br/>
things you own and let them throw, or that nobody owns and won&#39;t hurt  <br/>
to throw.<br/>
<br/>
I live surrounded by Many Rocks, in New Mexico.  It&#39;s bad for them to  <br/>
be on paved roads.  They break windshields.  The problems can be  <br/>
beyond just the danger to lawnmowers and those who are around while  <br/>
lawnmowers are running, although that alone might be reason enough to  <br/>
just tell kids no.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m confused myself, when you put it that way.  I don&#39;t think my  <br/>
right to have my yard the way I leave it is &quot;a social rule.&quot;  It has  <br/>
to do with ownership, privacy and rights.     And if I were in charge  <br/>
of the landscaping for a store or office or city park, it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
okay for people to mix and match the rocks and mulch there either.<br/>

wondering if it&#39;s just overall disrespectful to touch other people&#39;s stuff<br/>
like that.  And is it the touching, the letting it run through his fingers,<br/>
or the throwing that is really disrespectful.  Or all of it?  I try to find<br/>
a reason not to throw, and if it&#39;s staying with the mulch, and it&#39;s not<br/>
creating a big hole or empty spot, and it&#39;s not getting on a building, or<br/>
other people, or the sidewalk, I usually can&#39;t identify a reason, so I don&#39;t<br/>
stop it.  I cringe to think about some one or two of the things that I&#39;ve<br/>
allowed.  But the best reason I can think of is usually &quot;it bothers people<br/>
to see rocks/mulch being throw&quot;.  Which leads me to this ....<br/>

earning and thinking about unschooling I try to have an internal dialogue<br/>
that starts with &quot;why not?&quot;, and examine the answers that I give myself to<br/>
see if they&#39;re arbitrary or real, or to see if I can find another way to<br/>
meet his needs.  In this situation with the gravel or mulch it wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
arbitrary, but I have a hard time with just saying no without a reason I can<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986815184">-=-It&#39;s usually just parks, but there are other places where he likes  <br/>
to play<br/>
with this stuff, -=-<br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque has parks within walking distance in almost every  <br/>
neighborhood build from about the 1920&#39;s (maybe longer).  Each  <br/>
housing developer has to provide a park, and then the city maintains  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty much, every tree has a well with chipped wood, and the  <br/>
playgrounds have sand.  All that costs money and is important because  <br/>
we&#39;re in the desert.  Trees can die if they&#39;re not watered, and the  <br/>
wood chips help hold the water  around the tree roots.  If I were  <br/>
with a child who wanted to go through things like that, I would  <br/>
explain what they were for, just as I just explained it here (or more  <br/>
briefly).<br/>
<br/>
Some of the rocks I gave away at the Albuquerque conference during  <br/>
the Flow talk came from near the credit union across from my house.   <br/>
To atone for my lifting of a handful of rocks, I also took trash out  <br/>
and pulled goat heads up.  When Keith&#39;s motorcycle needed parts and I  <br/>
was waiting in the parking lot at Honeywell, I looked through  the  <br/>
rocks they had around trees in the parking lot.  I earned my little  <br/>
basket of rocks by putting rocks back into the enclosures that had  <br/>
been kicked out into the parking lot, and I picked up trash while I  <br/>
was walking around there, too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s practicality and consideration and &quot;leave the site cleaner than  <br/>
you found it,&quot; which I heard often in Girl Scouts and the Society for  <br/>
Creative Anachronism, and which my kids have done in public parks  <br/>
too--clean up other people&#39;s stuff in casual ways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m wondering if it&#39;s just overall disrespectful to touch other  <br/>
people&#39;s stuff like that. And is it the touching, the letting it run  <br/>

all of it?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think it depends on the stuff.  Running fingers through gravel but  <br/>
not removing it seems fine.  Running hands through the beans or   <br/>
mushrooms at the grocery store, not so good. :-)<br/>
<br/>
An outdoors iron banister seems peachy to touch and even maybe climb  <br/>
on.  A plastic greenhouse, not so much.<br/>
<br/>
Principles will work better than rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt;&gt; If you can&#39;t explain something to a four or five year old, just  <br/>
say no.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have a hard time with just saying no without a reason I can  <br/>
explain. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Does it harm anything?  Does it create a danger?  (I&#39;d say yes to  <br/>
both, on putting gravel in the grass.)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you can&#39;t figure out whether something is okay or not, you  <br/>
could think of whether you would do it too.  If you wouldn&#39;t, why?   <br/>
If it&#39;s something you would feel uncomfortable about doing, it might  <br/>
be good to keep everyone on your team from doing it too (generally  <br/>
speaking).<br/>

We were staying with friends (good friends of dh, I don&#39;t know them<br/>
very well) who had a 3 year old daughter.  It was in winter and their<br/>
apartment was very hot for us (we heat less than they do.)  Dd has<br/>
always had a penchant for being naked, and since the apartment was too<br/>
hot for her to begin with, she wanted to be naked a lot, but our<br/>
friends were very uncomfortable with that (not because of potty<br/>
issues, she was already using a potty without accidents.)  Dh and I<br/>
tried to get at least underwear on dd, and also tried to get her out<br/>
of the apartment as much as possible, but there were a few times when<br/>
she was naked, and I wonder what I should have done... Forced clothes<br/>
on her? Moved to a hotel room? (We stayed 3 nights with those friends.)  <br/>
<br/>
Another time (dd was about 20 months old at the time) we stayed with<br/>
relatives of dh, and there were a lot of things in the apartment that<br/>
were very appealing to dd but that they felt uncomfortable with her<br/>
touching.  (They have a 7 year old daughter, they are not elderly<br/>
people.)  I placed some items out of reach (things that were easily<br/>
put back in place), and some I let her touch with me closely<br/>
supervising (things that weren&#39;t obviously breakable.)  But they were<br/>
obviously displeased with my attitude: they thought I should just tell<br/>
her &quot;no&quot;, and that she should have obeyed... I wonder now, should I<br/>
have just said &quot;no&quot;, and handled the meltdown after too many nos?<br/>
(what&#39;s the plural of no?) <br/>
<br/>
These types of situations make me extremely uncomfortable (we used to<br/>
live in Europe, where both dh are from, and traveled a lot to visit<br/>
friends and relatives), and I have told dh that from now on when we<br/>
travel I want to stay in hotel rooms and not with friends or relatives<br/>
at whose house I don&#39;t feel comfortable bringing dd. Is that a good<br/>
way to go about that?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I would have done when Jayn was small. Still would if I felt <br/>
uncomfortable. Why visit if you feel uncomfortable instead of joyful? Plus <br/>
James likes privacy and Jayn really enjoys hotels - she has a taste for <br/>
luxury I think and going to the ice machine is one of her favorite things to <br/>
do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to the day when I have a home that is big enough to <br/>
invite people to stay. I hope my guests always feel utterly comfortable and <br/>
at home and relaxed.<br/>

Those aren&#39;t the only two choices.  You could find something cool for  <br/>
her to wear, something flowy and fancy maybe.  It&#39;s fine and good  <br/>
(and necessary in many ways) to tell kids they can only go naked at  <br/>
home when there&#39;s  no company.  There really are laws, and they do  <br/>
apply to unschoolers just as much as to anyone else.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s one way, but  you&#39;re still only giving yourself two choices-- <br/>
stay where you&#39;re uncomfortable, or get a hotel room.<br/>
<br/>
Part of being your child&#39;s partner is helping her learn how to be in  <br/>
the world, how to live comfortably and fully and considerately and  <br/>
legally. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Twisting and turning to get away from the world can work sometimes  <br/>
(like my kids never went to school, for instance) but you can&#39;t twist  <br/>
yourself right off the planet or out of the present year.  Help her  <br/>
adapt to situations when you can.  If you can&#39;t, *then* run away and  <br/>
get a hotel room.  But getting a room and not trying to help her cope  <br/>
and blend isn&#39;t the best option.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, I get that, and I do try to help her adapt and blend (except in<br/>
those situations when I&#39;m so overwhelmed that I can&#39;t cope myself.) <br/>
But I&#39;m also wondering if it&#39;s okay to sometimes just wait to expose<br/>
her to certain kind of situations when I know we have trouble, like<br/>
until next year when she&#39;s bigger and understands things better, for<br/>
example.  I mean, there are times when it&#39;s appropriate to just wait<br/>
and try again when she&#39;ll be more mature developmentally, right?  <br/>

Absolutely.  And some people&#39;s houses just aren&#39;t set up for toddlers  <br/>
or young children at all.  And some people don&#39;t like little kids.<br/>

Absolutely. When my son Naruto could not cope with something I avoided that as much as possible. <br/>
Last year when Sandra came to talk in Minnesota she was just over one hour and forty minutes away from where I live. My than 20 month old dd Gigi could not stand 20 minutes of a car ride. I really wanted to go hear Sandra talk and meet her. I could not leave her home cause she did not separate for more than an hour or so and was still nursing a lot ( still is). So I stayed home. As much as I wanted to go it would have been a nightmare for her and me in the car. My husband was super busy that day to come with us and help on the road. <br/>
When my son could not cope with going to visit people&#39;s homes at 2 years old ( he wanted to touch things and jump on furniture) I did not go. Now at 6 he is super polite on other peoples homes and understands that he can jump on our couch ( a $20 couch from goodwill) but not on others. He takes his shoes of when he visits people in the entrance, He is great but at 2 it was too much for him.<br/>
