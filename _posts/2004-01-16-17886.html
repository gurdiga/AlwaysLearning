<div id="ygrps-yiv-306861202">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;You COULD help make your neighbor&#39;s life sweeter today though, and maybe<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; someone you see out in public.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday....<br/>
<br/>
8:00am   The water tank guy says the problem is &quot;more extensive&quot; than<br/>
originally thought<br/>
<br/>
9:30  The septic tank guy says the tank is completely shot and we need a<br/>
total new system.  He will take care of getting permits.   That will be $600<br/>
now....just for permits?<br/>
<br/>
10:00 I am helping Zach shave goats in the rain because we are headed to a<br/>
show this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
10:30  The water tank guy says I need a new pump, new pipe and a new tank.<br/>
It will be $2500 to install it....they don&#39;t finance or take credit.<br/>
<br/>
11:00  I finally scrounge up the money<br/>
<br/>
11:30  The septic guys complete pumping the tank...That will be $350 in<br/>
cash.....now please.<br/>
<br/>
11:35  As I find the money, I hear the septic tank guy ask the kids if they<br/>
just watch tv all day to which the kids answer in the affirmative &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
He then asks them if they can read....at least they answered yes to that<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
12:00  I help Adriane shave goats in the rain  (wet goat hair is extremely<br/>
ticklish)<br/>
<br/>
12:30 The kids holler that the bathroom is flooded.<br/>
<br/>
12:31 I watch the dog take off down the road and realize the septic tank<br/>
guys left the gate open<br/>
<br/>
12:32 The water tank guy comes by for his money but it is gone.  I have lost<br/>
$2500!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
12:33 The kids are still hollering about the flooded bathroom.<br/>
<br/>
12:34 I am running around looking for the money while the water tank guy<br/>
waits not so patiently on the porch.<br/>
<br/>
12:35 I discover that Zach put the money in his wallet for safe keeping.<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
12:36 I open the door to give the money to the water tank guy and the muddy<br/>
dog runs into the house and across the beige carpet.<br/>
<br/>
12:37 The bathroom is still flooded several inches deep.  Dan says he was<br/>
having trouble with the toilet paper so he needed to use a lot. &lt;sigh&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
3:00  The bathroom is semi-dry and the wet towels are starting to wash.  The<br/>
living room rug is no longer muddy.<br/>
<br/>
3:30 Zach informs me that both shirts he needs to wear to show goats in are<br/>
too short in the sleeves. &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
<br/>
4:00 I start running kids back and forth to gymnastics<br/>
<br/>
5:00 I start dinner<br/>
<br/>
6:00 We eat and Jerry offers to take Zach into San Antonio to get a couple<br/>
of shirts.<br/>
<br/>
8:00  I pick up the last kid from gymnastics.<br/>
<br/>
9:00 The little guys are in bed and Jerry goes on a call with the volunteer<br/>
fire dept..<br/>
<br/>
11:00  It starts raining again and we decide we better move the stock<br/>
trailer before it gets too muddy.<br/>
<br/>
Midnight    Jerry, Zach and I are trying to get the trailer unstuck.  It is<br/>
buried deep.  I am wearing my pajamas, black rubber boots and am covered in<br/>
mud.<br/>
<br/>
12:30  I go in the garage and find several bags of hand-me-downs dropped off<br/>
by a friend while I was out running around during the day.  It was just used<br/>
clothes but it made such a difference in the day.  I didn&#39;t know she was<br/>
going to do it and it made me feel good that somebody thought of doing a<br/>
small favor for us.  We could really use it that day.<br/>
<br/>
8:00am  my period starts  &lt;sigh&gt;<br/>
