<div id="ygrps-yiv-601243135">Thank you so much for all the great ideas.  The fear of elevators is because<br/>
she thinks she might get stuck in there, although this has never happened to<br/>
us.  I get claustrophobic too, but I thought it was because my older<br/>
brothers used to hold pillows over my head. :-(  I have panicked inside dark<br/>
tents.   Now I know I have to sleep with my head close to the entrance.  I<br/>
do have a little motion sickness too, but never when I&#39;m the driver.<br/>
<br/>
I had a discussion with Lisa yesterday, asking her about her concerns and<br/>
sharing some of your ideas.  She said if she must endure the 4 hour ride,<br/>
she would like to stay at Gramma&#39;s for a few days, rather than just one, as<br/>
we would if we went with Dh this weekend.  She also felt as if the trip was<br/>
sprung on her suddenly.  She would prefer to have more advance time to &quot;get<br/>
ready&quot;.  She said peppermint helps, laying down helps, and she liked the<br/>
idea of frequent stops.  She does prefer my car to any other.  We&#39;ve had it<br/>
since before she was born.  She said the &quot;new car smell&quot; of Dad&#39;s truck<br/>
(1999) and Gramma&#39;s car (1995) makes her feel worse.  I&#39;ve thought about<br/>
having a DVD player in the car too.  I wonder if looking at moving objects,<br/>
like a video screen, is better for some kids than looking at a book.  I can<br/>
read in the car though without it bothering me.<br/>
<br/>
I realize that there are other issues involved here for me.  I want to<br/>
please dh by accompnaying him on the weekend trip, and please my mom by<br/>
coming to visit her.  She does come to visit here too, but of course likes<br/>
it when we visit her.  I have plenty of guilt issues going on with my mom.<br/>
I&#39;m very good at guilt!  No matter how much time we spend with her, I hear<br/>
&quot;nobody visits me&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m so sad you are leaving&quot;, rather than just<br/>
&quot;thanks for coming, it was great to see you&quot;.  Well, that is another topic.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reminding me that what is important is helping my daughter feel<br/>
safe and as comfortable as possible.  We do have dreams of buying some kind<br/>
of bus or motor home for taking road trips in real comfort...  She doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to get sick on buses, but planes are awful for her.  She hasn&#39;t been on<br/>
a train.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you could write and say that.  Suggest a script to her.  &quot;Thanks for <br/>
coming to visit again!&quot;<br/>
and when you leave, &quot;I&#39;m glad you came!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry it&#39;s stressful.  I don&#39;t love going to see inlaws and I hardly even <br/>
call my own mom even though she&#39;s in town.  I get phone sick!  &lt;bwg&gt;  Last <br/>
time I tried to call the phone was temporarily disconnected.  I didn&#39;t think <br/>
&quot;Gosh, she might not be okay!&quot; I thought, &quot;DAMN, she lost her phonebill money <br/>
at the casino.&quot;<br/>
