<div id="ygrps-yiv-671266600">I didn’t ask last year, and I won’t ask next year, but this year I’m asking for financial assistance to cover the expenses of some of my ongoing unschooling projects, for the next few years.<br/>
<br/>
Details are at a link below, but when I went to see how long ago my first published writing was, it was 1992, so 25 years.  And the middle part was this:<br/>
<br/>
____<br/>
<br/>
...try this experiment: Keep your child from learning anything for a few days. Make sure that from the first waking moment there is nothing learned, no new material, no original thoughts to ponder, etc. The only problem is that you would have to keep the children from playing, talking, reading, cleaning or repairing anything, etc.<br/>
______<br/>
<br/>
Then in an interview in 1998:<br/>
_________<br/>
<br/>
Try not to learn. Don&#39;t try to learn. Those two aren&#39;t the same thing but they&#39;re close enough for beginners. <br/>
__________<br/>
<br/>
And Learn Nothing Day starts pretty soon in New Zealand.<br/>
<br/>
Learn Nothing Day is (literallly) the least of my projects, though I made a big deal about it this year because it’s #10. Next year it might slide by unnoticed, and that’s fine.<br/>
<br/>
Here is my request for help.  Marty (#2 of 3) helped me write it.  Marty is a senior studying economics, though he already has a job that would like to hire him full time, but he wants to finish as he’s enjoying the classes and is on a roll.  And his wife is pregnant.  And his father-in-law died a week ago, and was buried Thursday.  I saw Marty serve as a pall bearer, in a white cowboy shirt with a red bouttoniere.  Everything can be a tangent, and the connections are all through it all.  His life is big and busy, and I become a smaller and smaller part of it.<br/>

The first-quoted writing above was not on my website this morning, but it is now, and linked from the request-for-assistance page.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking a peek there, and for reading here.<br/>
