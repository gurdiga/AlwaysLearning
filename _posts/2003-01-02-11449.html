<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003980464">I have a Canadian question.  My friend Steve went on and on about it, but I <br/>
want a better opinion.  (Because Steve is actually originally from *Ohio*.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;O Canada&quot; isn&#39;t the same in French as in English. <br/>
I mean musically it&#39;s the same, but the English translation (which isn&#39;t the <br/>
only or first, just the most currently used) doesn&#39;t say the same stuff as <br/>
the French.<br/>
<br/>
Is it because the French are more likely to be Catholic?  Is it just mostly <br/>
used instrumentally? <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a german site with some info and a good MIDI:<br/>

<br/>
and there&#39;s a really good Canadian site [which I have seen before and can&#39;t <br/>
now found, but have found more background on my own question above...  <br/>
without the French lyrics, though...]<br/>

<br/>
For those in the readership who aren&#39;t American,<br/>
the U.S. has &quot;The Star Spangle Banner&quot; which uses the tune of an English <br/>
drinking song.  VERY hard to sing, though.<br/>
<br/>
In elementary school, our morning routine involved the pledge of allegiance <br/>
followed by an easier song to sing, &quot;My Country &#39;Tis of Thee,&quot; which is from <br/>
another English drinking song.   Oh. No, it&#39;s &quot;God Save the Queen&quot; with <br/>
American words.<br/>
<br/>
My country &#39;tis of thee,<br/>
Sweet land of libery,<br/>
Of thee I sing.<br/>

Land of the pilgrims&#39; pride<br/>

<br/>
The Canadian Anthem<br/>
&quot;O Canada&quot;<br/>
<br/>
O Canada! Our homeand native land!<br/>
True patriot love in all thy sons command.<br/>
With glowing hearts we see thee rise,<br/>
The True North, strong and free!<br/>
From far and wide,<br/>
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.<br/>
God keep our land glorious and free!<br/>
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.<br/>
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee.<br/>
<br/>
Refrain<br/>
O Canada, glorious and free!<br/>
We stand on guard, we stand on guard for thee.<br/>
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee!<br/>
***********************************<br/>
I was surprised to find that there are several more verses.  I&#39;ve never<br/>
heard them sung.  And I change some of the words.  Since it isn&#39;t *my*<br/>
native land, I sing &quot;our home *on* native land.  I also kind of figure that<br/>
if patriotism is a good thing, it should include all of us, so I sing &quot;True<br/>
patriot love in all *of us* command.&quot;<br/>
************************************<br/>
O Canada (en francais)<br/>
<br/>
O Canada, terre de nos aieux,<br/>
Ton front est ceint de fleurons glorieux.<br/>
Car ton bras sait porter l&#39;épée,<br/>
Il sait porter la croix.<br/>
Ton histoire est une épopée<br/>
Des plus brillants exploits.<br/>
Et ta valeur, de foi trempée.<br/>
<br/>
Protégera nos foyers et nos droits.<br/>
Protégera nos foyers et nos droits<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes the words are different.  The angle is roman catholic with the <br/>
french version.  Talks of  front of the face being santify, and of <br/>
carrying the cross as well as the swords are RC.  The english version is <br/>
more secular, universal with talk of our love of the land and being <br/>
temper by it..  Often these days both version gets intertwined, starting <br/>
with some french and ending with some english.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is it because the French are more likely to be Catholic?  Is it just mostly <br/>

even sing a three lingual at northen sport events.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Googling &quot;star spangled banner&quot; got a music facsimile with the composer&#39;s<br/>
name, John Stafford Smith; another google got to a U.K. site about him:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.softdata.co.uk/gloucester/smith.htm">http://www.softdata.co.uk/gloucester/smith.htm</a><br/>
John Stafford Smith<br/>
<br/>
John Stafford Smith was born in 1750 and christened in Gloucester<br/>
Cathedral.After his education at the Cathedral School he was   a choir boy<br/>
at the Chapel Royal London. He also studied under Dr. Boyce. He gained a<br/>
reputation as a fine organist and composer and gained membership of the<br/>
select Anachreonic Society. Member have included J.S.Bach, Henry Purcell and<br/>
James Boswell.<br/>
<br/>
In 1780 he composed the music to the societies constitutional song. It was<br/>
entitled &quot; To Anachreon in Heaven  &quot;. It was inspired by a 6th century Greek<br/>
poet and was about the pleasures of wine and love.<br/>
<br/>
He played as organist at the Three Choirs Festival in 1790 at Gloucester. In<br/>
1836 he died at the age of 85.<br/>
<br/>
His song became popular in England and America. During the war of 1812, the<br/>
British fleet attacked Fort Mchenry which protected Baltimore. Frances Scott<br/>
Key was aboard a British war ship trying to get the release of an American<br/>
prisoner. He was held so that he could not pass on any warning about the<br/>
attack. <br/>
<br/>
When the sun rose next morning he notice the Stars and Stripes was still<br/>
flying. He then penned the following verse to the tune of John Stafford<br/>
Smith.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! say, can you see,by the dawns early light<br/>
<br/>
What so proudly we hailed at the twilight&#39;s last Gleamings<br/>
<br/>
Whose broad Stripes and bright Stars,thro&#39; the perilous fight<br/>
<br/>
O&#39;er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming<br/>
<br/>
and the rockets red glare,the bombs bursting in air<br/>
<br/>
Gave proof thro&#39; the night that our flag was still there.<br/>
<br/>
Oh! say, does the star spangled banner yet wave<br/>
<br/>
O&#39;er the land of the free and the home of the brave.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This was printed on hand bills the next day and distributed through<br/>
Baltimore. Interestingly, although the American navy and army had recognised<br/>
the Star Spangled Banner as the National Anthem of the united states for<br/>
some time, it was not until 1931 that it was officially recognised by<br/>
congress.<br/>
<br/>
You will see the stars and stripes flying from Gloucester Cathedral to this<br/>
day because of this connection.<br/>
<br/>

One more google got the original lyrics of &quot;To Anachreon in Heaven&quot;<br/>

A bad drinking song with a nearly unsingable tune.<br/>
<br/>
The other isn&#39;t a drinking song, but the anthem (a hymn, really) of the whole <br/>
British Commonwealth, called God Save the King/Queen, whichever.<br/>
<br/>
God save our gracious Queen,<br/>
Long live our noble Queen,<br/>
God save the Queen!<br/>
