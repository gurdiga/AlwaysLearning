<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248757207">I&#39;m working on cleaning up some webpages this morning, and I followed  <br/>
a link to make sure it still worked, and I clicked something from  <br/>
there, and I wandered away.  But I found this clear explanation for  <br/>
why having fun is a sin.   And I&#39;m not saying it IS a sin, but I&#39;m  <br/>
saying some of you might have relatives and  neighbors and maybe  <br/>
social workers or doctors who believe more as this writer believes  <br/>
than as most unschoolers I know believe.  It&#39;s worth knowing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***That is why Jesus would say to His disciples in Matthew 16:24,  <br/>
&quot;. . . If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take  <br/>
up his cross, and follow me.&quot; If fun is our motive in activities, no  <br/>
one is going to take Matthew 16:24 seriously because there is nothing  <br/>
fun about self-sacrifice and self-denial.***<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was in an article about why a certain type of serious Christian  <br/>
family should keep their children from playing sports.<br/>

I went there because I hadn&#39;t known some families were so anti- <br/>
sports.  It&#39;s on the list of things the Titus2 moms board wants  <br/>
people to discourage (&quot;no sports&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If anyone on this list thinks I&#39;m too narrow in my ideas about what  <br/>
should and shouldn&#39;t be discussed here, check this set of rules:<br/>

<br/>
There are other quotes I&#39;ve heard but didn&#39;t keep about foolishness  <br/>
and play and other bad things.  If any of you come across any, I  <br/>
guess I should collect them.  Sometimes unschoolers are too cavalier  <br/>
and &quot;whatever&quot; about their joy and happiness, I think, and don&#39;t  <br/>
realize what the objections really are.  The U.S. has more  <br/>
Puritanical history than other English speaking countries, so I think  <br/>
the prejudice against having fun might be worse here.   Do the Amish  <br/>
discourage sports and playing among children?  I&#39;m curious now.  In  <br/>
New Zealand is it a sin for kids to giggle and be silly?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-332775995">Here in Australia, sport IS our religion!  As a non-sporty person myself, I sometimes feel a <br/>
bit on the outer because discussing sport is one of the standard elements of general <br/>
conversation.  With regard to kids having fun, I may be seeing this through an unschooling <br/>
filter, but I think generally kids here are encouraged to have fun OUTSIDE (ie. away from <br/>
the mummies so they can talk).  And then parent participation can be a bit lacking (I&#39;m <br/>
referring to younger children here - my oldest is nearly 4).<br/>
<br/>
I followed the links to the board Sandra found and it looked like something from the stone <br/>
age - wives &#39;submitting&#39; to husbands, &#39;God&#39; directly intervening in people&#39;s lives.  There is <br/>
a theory that many of the world&#39;s current woes can be traced to the split between body <br/>
and spirit found in monotheistic religions.  Denying our bodily urges, pleasures and needs <br/>
divorces us from the natural world, hence the exploitation of animals, of the earth, global <br/>
warming ... <br/>
<br/>
Having fun, exploring our physicality through sport and other activities is part of being <br/>
human.  To deny these things is to work against our own nature.<br/>

Fundamentalist Christianity.  Australia has some too, but nobody has  <br/>
it like the U.S. has it.  And it&#39;s important for people to know, for  <br/>
unschoolers to know, that there are way more of them than of us.  So  <br/>
when an unschooler is dealing with the press or any public discussion  <br/>
of homeschooling in general, to express surprise or denial that there  <br/>
is a huge number of such homeschoolers is naive at best and ignorant   <br/>
or dishonest at worst.<br/>
<br/>
Christian homeschoolers have HUGE conferences--thousands of families,  <br/>
hundreds of vendors (because they buy things, and lots of things,  <br/>
like punishment charts, and science and history books created  <br/>
specifically for that market).   It&#39;s fascinating like a train wreck  <br/>
that&#39;s lasted 25 years so far.<br/>

friend in school, I was her Girl Scout Leader, and her brother was in  <br/>
Roxana&#39;s class. The mom and I talked a lot - about school. Then she  <br/>
suddenly took her kids out of school and started homeschooling. Roya  <br/>
was invited to a birthday party at their house and I went inside and  <br/>
was shocked to see the various charts and signs posted. They had a  <br/>
huge chart on which there were listed all the different crimes the  <br/>
kids might commit and what the consequences would be for each. The  <br/>
consequences were - get this - extra schoolwork.<br/>
<br/>
I had sorta kinda been thinking about homeschooling, too, but I  <br/>
immediately was turned off and put it out of my mind for another year  <br/>
(at which time I ran into Sandra and others on AOL and had my  <br/>
imagination ignited!).<br/>

was a kid!  One that refers all issues to biblical references so<br/>
lovingly taken out of context to meet the needs of the person using them<br/>
to control another!<br/>

I&#39;m sure there are lots of folks on this board that grew up similarly,<br/>

some of the other kids that I grew up with in church, who couldn&#39;t even<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129700059">The adversarial parenting on Christian websites like these breaks my <br/>
heart.  All the man-made &quot;religion&quot; that has nothing to do with the <br/>
Bible drives me nuts.  I&#39;m by no means a Bible scholar, but here are <br/>
a few things that jumped out at me.  Maybe they could be helpful to <br/>
someone who has friends or family in this camp.<br/>
<br/>
==========We need to begin by defining sports for the purpose of this <br/>
discussion because there are a wide variety of activities that are <br/>
called sports, and some are beyond the scope of this Corner. The <br/>
first use of the word &quot;sport&quot; in Scripture is found in Judges <br/>
16:25. &quot;And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they <br/>
said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they called for <br/>
Samson out of the prison house; and he made them sport: and they set <br/>
him between the pillars.&quot; According to Strong&#39;s Talking Hebrew and <br/>
Greek Dictionary, the Hebrew word for sport is &quot;sahaq&quot; and is also <br/>
translated to play (10 times), laugh (10), rejoice (3), scorn (3), <br/>
sport (3), and five other words. To play and have a good time is a <br/>
primary thread woven into the fabric of why sports are important to <br/>
families today and a key aspect of its definition. <br/>
<br/>
Next, I went to a number of resources to see what our modern English <br/>
definition of sports would be. Merriam-Webster primarily defines <br/>
sport as &quot;a source of diversion, recreation, a physical activity <br/>
engaged in for pleasure such as an athletic game.&quot; To compete is the <br/>
heart of most athletic games and compete is defined as, &quot;To strive <br/>
consciously or unconsciously for an objective (as position, profit, <br/>
or prize): be in a state if rivalry.&quot; And finally rival is defined <br/>
as, &quot;one of two or more striving to reach or obtain something that <br/>
only one can possess.&quot; So for the purpose of this discussion, let&#39;s <br/>
define sports as, &quot;physical activities that are fun or pleasurable <br/>
where the purpose is to compete and win against another person or <br/>
team.&quot; Whether the sport is officially organized and whether they <br/>
keep score has some bearing, but we won&#39;t make that part of the <br/>
definition.========<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s simply not logical to compare the Hebrew word, translated into <br/>
Old English with the modern American English use of the word to make <br/>
a point.  What that verse actually says in plain English is that they <br/>
mocked and made fun of Sampson.  Not a virtue, and hopefully not <br/>
anything promoted by modern sports.  <br/>
<br/>
=======That is why Jesus would say to His disciples in Matthew <br/>
16:24, &quot;. . . If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, <br/>
and take up his cross, and follow me.&quot; If fun is our motive in <br/>
activities, no one is going to take Matthew 16:24 seriously because <br/>
there is nothing fun about self-sacrifice and self-denial.========<br/>
<br/>
This is speaking to adults, and has nothing to do with parenting.  It <br/>
does not say &quot;be miserable for me,&quot; or &quot;make your children miserable <br/>
for me.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
========On the other hand, the Christian faith is where we can all be <br/>
winners, and we are all trying to attain the crown together. I help <br/>
you, and you help me. We all win together. &quot;Henceforth there is laid <br/>
up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous <br/>
judge, shall give me at that day: and not to me only, but unto all <br/>
them also that love his appearing&quot; (2 Timothy 4:8). Sports train us <br/>
to receive pleasure in putting ourselves first and others down. <br/>
However, life in Christ is all about putting ourselves last while we <br/>
attempt to lift others up.===========<br/>
<br/>
What about those that don&#39;t &quot;love his appearing?&quot;  There will always <br/>
be someone on the other side.  It&#39;s also part of the Christian faith <br/>
to try to gently encourage others to find the same joy in Christ that <br/>
we have.  It can also be part of sports to encourage your team, and <br/>
two teams can fine-tune each other through competition, so they can <br/>
both excel.  I wonder if they are against spelling bees and Bible <br/>
memorizing contests.    <br/>
<br/>
=========&quot;Be kindly affectioned one to another with brotherly love; <br/>
in honour preferring one another&quot; (Romans 12:10).========<br/>
<br/>
=========Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself&quot; (Romans <br/>
13:9).=========<br/>
<br/>
If this is the way we are to treat our brothers and neighbours, <br/>
shouldn&#39;t it be especially the way we should treat our children?  How <br/>
does the rest of the website promote that?<br/>
<br/>
I understand that they don&#39;t like the often cruel, shaming, <br/>
antagonistic aspect of many sports.  I don&#39;t believe sports, even <br/>
competitive ones, have to be that way though.  <br/>
<br/>
For the record, I&#39;m a Messianic Christian.  We aren&#39;t a big sports <br/>
family, though dh played football in highschool, and I enjoy <br/>
basketball and soccer.  If my children want to play sports I will <br/>
certainly support that.  I would not tolerate a coach or anyone <br/>
demeaning, shaming or belittling my child or the other team.  But <br/>
sports can be played with a spirit of love. <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;d probably have a heart attack at my church!  With Davidic <br/>
dance, shofars, tamborines, bongos, we have a lot of fun.  :)     <br/>
