<br/>
-=-I used to make him monkey platters a few times a day ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Why &quot;used to&quot;? <br/>
He&#39;s six! <br/>
What happened!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yes I do still make them, but not enough I think. I was throwing a lot of stuff away, so I cut down as I thought he didn&#39;t want them anymore. I&#39;ll start making more again, and look for new things he might like.<br/>

Maybe make them for both of you, for everyone, rather than it being just &quot;a kid thing.&quot;  And you could (maybe) try for things that don&#39;t need to be thrown out just because they&#39;ve sat out a while.    <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-781898727">Jo are you waiting for him to ask for food?<br/>
Are you asking what he wants?<br/>
<br/>
I would not wait until he is hungry of  ask him every time what he wants.<br/>
Make foods and bring to him. Make a little  plate of food and bring before he is too hungry.<br/>
Best to offer food like that every 2 or 3 hours maximum. <br/>
<br/>
I notice when kids are  too hungry some will go for sweets. It makes sense as they have instant energy for the body.<br/>
Even is he does grab something sweet to eat still make a plate of a Monkey Platter ( which does not have to have so much food! - I make little ones with just a little food sometimes for my kids individually) and bring it and place it next to him and let him eat or not. <br/>
<br/>
 Some of the times my kids are hungry they will go grab some sweet and I will just bring them something else, some fruits and meats or some plate of food, and they will go and eat those too :)<br/>

And cook!  Make things that smell good.  At least grilled cheese sandwiches or popcorn or garlic cooking in butter, to put on noodles.  Choosing from cold things that don&#39;t smell like anything isn&#39;t always appealing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-381334517">What about a fragrant herbal tea with honey? Its warm and smells good.<br/>
serve with fruit and scones or muffins?<br/>
<br/>
 Or tomato based vegetable soup? You can make a pot and dole out in small<br/>
cups? He can always ask for more if its in a crockpot warming and then you<br/>
can have it for lunch or dinner with your whole family later? Chili too can<br/>
sit in the crock pot and be available as a snack served with tortilla and<br/>
sprinkle with cheese, serve with avocado slices with lime juice squeezed to<br/>
keep them from going yucky fast and maybe pineapple chunks (could go into a<br/>
stirfry later) or apple chunks that could go into apple sauce later.<br/>
