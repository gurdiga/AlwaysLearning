<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068711779">Chamille had a friend over last night.  His mother was working late and<br/>
he stayed at our house instead of being home alone.  They were hungry<br/>
and not really liking the choices for food here, so they rounded up a<br/>
bunch of change and headed out on a mission to get food.  I thought<br/>
they&#39;d go to the 7-11 because it&#39;s only a couple of blocks away, but<br/>
they ended up at a pizza place a bit farther, maybe 6 or 7 blocks away,<br/>
less than a mile for sure.  It was fine with me, Chamille called and<br/>
told me where they were when they got there.  On their way home the<br/>
boy&#39;s mother called them and was very upset that he had gone to the<br/>
pizza place without telling her.  It&#39;s a little weird, but she&#39;s really<br/>
over protective about knowing where he is at all times.<br/>
<br/>
So, when they got back here, his mind was full of thoughts of how his<br/>
mother was upset with him.  He expressed deep regret that he can&#39;t<br/>
communicate well with his mother and that she doesn&#39;t ever really listen<br/>
to him, cuts him off, usually because she doesn&#39;t like what he is<br/>
telling her.  He went on to express his frustration that his parents<br/>
don&#39;t trust him and that he doesn&#39;t know how to prove trustworthiness. <br/>
He&#39;s a good kid, does well in school, doesn&#39;t do drugs, gets home on<br/>
time, and really tries to be good.  His mother isn&#39;t even a bad parent,<br/>
she&#39;s pretty nice really, and he really does like his mother, even<br/>
though he&#39;s very hurt by her actions that show disappointment and lack<br/>
of trust.<br/>
<br/>
This kid cried and poured his heart out to us.  Chamille and I loved him<br/>
up and fed him jelly bellies and apple juice and talked and talked about<br/>
everything.  At one point he had said that he could understand how a<br/>
parent wouldn&#39;t trust their child if they&#39;d done something to break<br/>
their trust.  I really disagree with this.  Isn&#39;t a child who has done<br/>
something, only making a mistake?  Does it really mean that trust is<br/>
broken, or doesn&#39;t it mean that a kid made a mistake and is going to do<br/>
better next time?<br/>
<br/>
Kids live up to their parent&#39;s expectations.  If parents don&#39;t trust<br/>
their kids, eventually the kids will be untrustworthy, thereby giving<br/>
validation to the fact that the kids weren&#39;t to be trusted.  Why even<br/>
bother being trustworthy if you aren&#39;t trusted to begin with?  I trust<br/>
my kids absolutely.  I don&#39;t doubt for a moment that they will do things<br/>
that are less than brilliant, but I still trust them and still want to<br/>
trust them.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, those are the thoughts floating in my head today.</div>
