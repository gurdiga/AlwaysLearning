<div id="ygrps-yiv-149274913">Hi all:<br/>
<br/>
I figure if anyone knows the source of this, they&#39;d be on this list. :)<br/>
<br/>
I realize Gatto is not an unschooler but I also know that his work has inspired many of us in our living/learning journeys with our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere along the way, Gatto made a comment about all it would take to learn all the conventional math from K through 12. Someone did find the quote in the Seven-Lesson School Teacher essay:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Were the colonists geniuses? No, the truth is that reading, writing, and<br/>
arithmetic only take about one hundred hours to transmit as long as the audience<br/>
is eager and willing to learn. The trick is to wait until someone asks and then<br/>
move fast while the mood is on. Millions of people teach themselves these<br/>
things, it really isn&#39;t very hard. Pick up a fifth-grade math or rhetoric<br/>
textbook from 1850 and you&#39;ll see that the texts were pitched then on what would<br/>
today be considered college level. The continuing cry for &quot;basic skills&quot;<br/>
practice is a smoke screen behind which schools preempt the time of children for<br/>
twelve years and teach them the seven lessons I&#39;ve just described to you.&quot;<br/>
-John Taylor Gatto<br/>
<br/>
Is this all there is? Or did he go into it more somewhere else? Or did someone else go into it more somewhere else?<br/>
<br/>
This is bugging me today (as I swear I&#39;ve read something more detailed about it recently) and any help you can offer will be greatly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When I was first around homeschoolers, there was a John Holt quote  <br/>
passed around.  I never found the original.  This was before Gatto was  <br/>
on the scene at all.<br/>
<br/>
It was 12 months, I think.  And what it was was not &quot;K-12,&quot; but how  <br/>
long it took someone to &quot;catch up&quot; if they came on the scene late for  <br/>
some reason or other--from a totally different culture, for example,  <br/>
of if they had been incapacitated somehow.  It didn&#39;t say all that,  <br/>
but I can&#39;t remember what it DID say. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing Gatto might&#39;ve picked it up from the same source,  <br/>
whatever that is. It might not even have originally been John Holt--he  <br/>
might have been reporting something else he read, but it&#39;s a quote  <br/>
I&#39;ve hoped to find for years.  So thanks for stirring it up again!  I  <br/>
hope someone stumbles upon it so it can be clearly cited and spread  <br/>
all around!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645199132">The quote from that page:<br/>
<br/>
  I had just explained how the Sudbury Valley School - a  <br/>
democratically managed, child-directed learning environment that has  <br/>
been around for almost 40 years - has demonstrated repeatedly that a  <br/>
child could learn math - all of it grades K through 12 - in eight  <br/>
weeks. Average (if there is such a thing), normal (never met one),  <br/>
healthy children, hundreds of them, learned it all, leading to  <br/>
admissions to some of the leading colleges and universities in the  <br/>
nation.<br/>
<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll say this about Kirby:  He went into the remedial college math  <br/>
class he took baffled.  Frustrated for a week.  Dawning with help for  <br/>
a week.  Then he had it and got the highest test score in the class  <br/>
and the second-highest class grade.   It was fun for him, once he  <br/>
could understand the notation.<br/>
<br/>
But Kirby &quot;had math&quot; in very many ways, and that&#39;s what I think is  <br/>
missing from that whole model.   I think the &quot;year&quot; talk was for  <br/>
someone who comes from some isolated village where they don&#39;t see the  <br/>
printed word, where their mathematical notation is different, etc.,  <br/>
and they come to the U.S. to study.  They can catch up in a year.    <br/>
But again that would be someone who CHOSE to do that, and who thought  <br/>
it was interesting, as Kirby was with his math class.<br/>
<br/>
MAKING a child &quot;take math&quot; year after year &quot;teaches&quot; some of them to  <br/>
hate, fear and avoid math.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-689815738">The concept was from John Holt. He discussed math extensively in  <br/>
&quot;Learning All the Time.&quot; I don&#39;t have the book here to find the exact  <br/>
reference but it had made a big impression on me.<br/>

I know I saw someone break it down... and it was David Albert! (Thanks so much, btw!)<br/>

I will look through my copy of Learning All the Time (after I finish my outdoor painting project!) and see what I can see (or maybe someone will beat me to it!). I&#39;ll also ask Marty Layne if she knows the source - she has a long memory for this sort of thing.<br/>
