Bullshit is bullshit.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my problem with all the anti-TV stuff I have ever seen.  It  <br/>
just did not make sense.  It didn&#39;t overlay truly on my life, nor on  <br/>
any life I had ever seen or known.  It&#39;s as though those who write it  <br/>
are unaware that the people they are writing for have been around  <br/>
people and televisions at least long enough to learn to read.<br/>
<br/>
Then I&#39;m disturbed by people who read clear bullshit and think  <br/>
anything like &quot;Hmmm.  That makes sense.&quot;<br/>

dug into it then to see what had originally been found and how it had  <br/>
been twisted. Here&#39;s what I managed to pull out and pull together.  <br/>
(It&#39;s on my Arguments against arguments against TV page: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/374e48k)">http://tinyurl.com/374e48k)</a><br/>

&gt; sort of self-hypnosis in which they brain waves patterns indicate no  <br/>
&gt; active thought patterns.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Can you site a source for this? I can&#39;t seem to find one. What I did  <br/>
find (over and over and over) is a quote from &quot;Battle for Your Mind:  <br/>
Subliminal Programming&quot; by Dick Sutphen:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Recent tests by researcher Herbert Krugman showed that, while  <br/>
&gt;&gt; viewers were watching TV, right-brain activity outnumbered left- <br/>
&gt;&gt; brain activity by a ratio of two to one. Put more simply, the  <br/>
&gt;&gt; viewers were in an altered state . . . in trance more often than  <br/>
&gt;&gt; not. They were getting their Beta-endorphin &quot;fix.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; To measure attention spans, psychophysiologist Thomas Mulholland of  <br/>
&gt;&gt; the Veterans Hospital in Bedford, Massachusetts, attached young  <br/>
&gt;&gt; viewers to an EEG machine that was wired to shut the TV set off  <br/>
&gt;&gt; whenever the children&#39;s brains produced a majority of alpha waves.  <br/>
&gt;&gt; Although the children were told to concentrate, only a few could  <br/>
&gt;&gt; keep the set on for more than 30 seconds!<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Left brain activity (according to an anatomy and physiology text) is  <br/>
associated with spoken and written language, numerical and scientific  <br/>
skills and reasoning. Right brain activity is associated with musical  <br/>
and artistic awareness, space and pattern perception, insight,  <br/>
imagination, generating mental images to compare spatial  <br/>
relationships. (No connection is made between right brained activities  <br/>
and being in a trance like state.)<br/>
<br/>
 From that list, it makes sense to me that TV watching would be a  <br/>
right brained activity. I suppose if there&#39;s something inherently  <br/>
wrong with right brained activities, we should stop kids from drawing  <br/>
and imagining and being insightful.<br/>
<br/>
The text says that alpha waves are present in the EEGs of nearly all  <br/>
normal individuals when they are awake and resting with their eyes  <br/>
closed. These waves disappear entirely during sleep. Beta waves  <br/>
generally appear when the nervous system is active, that is, during  <br/>
periods of sensory input and mental activity. (Note that it says  <br/>
generally.)<br/>
<br/>
(Just as an interesting factoid, it says delta waves occur during deep  <br/>
sleep but they are also normal in an awake infant.)<br/>
<br/>
Another site says alpha waves are brought out by closing the eyes and  <br/>
by relaxation, and abolished by eye opening or alerting by any  <br/>
mechanism (thinking, calculating). Alpha waves are the major rhythm  <br/>
seen in normal relaxed adults - it is present during most of life  <br/>
especially beyond the thirteenth year when it dominates the resting  <br/>
tracing. (Alpha waves are also present during meditation and  <br/>
hypnosis.) And that beta waves are the dominant rhythm in patients who  <br/>
are alert or anxious or who have their eyes open.<br/>
<br/>
That would suggest people aren&#39;t thinking when they watch TV. But does  <br/>
that make sense? I could list off a huge number of things that I&#39;ve  <br/>
learned from watching TV. How can learning take place without  <br/>
thinking? There is also research into Controlling Computers With  <br/>
Neural Signals (in Scientific American) which uses Alpha and Mu waves.  <br/>
If alpha waves stop when thought happens, how could those waves be  <br/>
used to perform a computer action if we have to stop thinking in order  <br/>
to generate them?<br/>
<br/>
What it really means is that people enjoy dabbling in pseudo-science.  <br/>
They are using faulty logic -- hypnosis may generate alpha but that  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean alpha indicates hypnosis, thinking may generate beta but  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean that beta indicates thinking (or that lack of beta  <br/>
means lack of thinking) -- to draw a conclusion to fit their theory.<br/>
<br/>
To get a more complete picture we need to know what the waves look  <br/>
like when we&#39;re deeply involved in a novel. Or watching a play. Or  <br/>
playing a video game. Or watching a sporting event. Or painting. Or  <br/>
gazing down at a sleeping or nursing infant. (Not that it would  <br/>
indicate anything. It would just be more data on how the brain  <br/>
operates.) If alpha waves increased during those times, should we stop  <br/>
those things? Or does it merely mean that &quot;thinking stops alpha waves&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;beta is present during mental activity&quot; are too simplistic and  <br/>
don&#39;t adequately describe what&#39;s going on?<br/>

this is fascinating in and of itself, because it seems to me that the most common argument I hear against television is that it erodes creativity - and yet artistic, spatial, etc. creativity are inherently right brained!  thanks for the fascinating survey of the research joyce!  somehow I missed that one on your site!<br/>

I watched a lot of television as a child.  I remember after watching the<br/>
Flintstones my brother and I always would get out paper and markers to draw<br/>
our own comics.  The more I watched the better my drawings.  In other words<br/>
watching the Flintstones on tv helped me draw as much as drawing practice or<br/>
better.  Other things I drew didn&#39;t become easier to draw with just practice<br/>
alone.<br/>
<br/>
It occurs to me that would make an interesting study.  Do right brained<br/>
activities get easier for television watchers at the same rate as if they<br/>
invested more time in that activity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060830070">Zachariah (16) always had the TV on while creating fantastic things with legos.  Sometimes the creations were connected to the shows but not always.  Sometimes they were parallel activities.  Which he did a lot.  He also had the TV going while doing most anything.  Now - just today - he is watching TV and during commercials he is reading.  We were watching &quot;The Three Stooges&quot; this morning and he was reading manga during commercials - so not related at all (in my mind anyway ;)  I&#39;ve seen him playing games on the lap top while having the TV on.  And he always knows what is going on in a deep way - thinking way ;)  He will often pause the TV (thank you DVR) to discuss aspects of what he is watching / listening to and thinking about or to look somthing up on the net to see if that really happened, even close to what happened, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When he was really little I could swear he was so absorbed in his other activity that there was no way he knew what was on the TV but later (sometimes a day or two later) he might mention it and I&#39;d think to myself  &quot; well he was aware &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Gotta go - he is begging me to watch TV with him today and it is &quot;John Wayne weekend&quot; !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I wanted to clean today but he has invited me to watch TV!<br/>
<br/>
I have summers off from work so we spend a lot of time together and watching TV together is one thing we do a lot of ;)  and discussing and THINKING ;)<br/>

<br/>
I have a number of Dick Sutphen&#39;s &quot;self-hypnosis&quot; audiotapes from the 1990s and several of his more recent mp3s. The &quot;induction&quot; to each hypnosis session - the process of going from the beta brain waves of being wide awake and externally focussed to the alpha brain waves of being in a daydreamy state and internally focussed - takes about ten minutes. That&#39;s before getting to the purpose of the session. As I know from my own experience, any interruption of the induction brings the subject out of the process, so you need, to begin with, to be on your own somewhere quiet where you won&#39;t be disturbed for at least 30 minutes (a major reason why self-hypnosis audios were problematic for me in the 1990s). The hypnosis session itself lasts about 10-15 minutes and then there&#39;s the shorter process of returning to a wide awake state. Dick Sutphen told me (because I eventually wrote to him and asked) that, usually, before a change of belief or behaviour is likely to occur, a hypnosis session would need to be experienced daily for at least 90 days. That&#39;s 90 consecutive days.<br/>
<br/>
Since I&#39;ve been on the internet, the idea of &quot;subliminal programming&quot; has been hugely popularised for commercial reasons. The whole &quot;quick and easy&quot; thing - *because* changing beliefs and behaviour requires such a determined effort and high level of commitment and that doesn&#39;t sell in an age of &quot;instant gratification&quot;. Often the &quot;Eat Popcorn and Drink Coke&quot; story is cited as evidence that subliminal programming works - described and debunked in this article about &quot;self-help snake oil&quot; generally by Stephen Kraus, PhD.:<br/>

Not sure that was on line at the time I wrote what I did. As far as I  <br/>
remember, none of the anti-TV people I read was citing the research  <br/>
done by Krugman or Mulholland, just citing Dick Sutphen citing the  <br/>
research. When someone doesn&#39;t care what research means, only if it  <br/>
sounds like it supports their theory, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter how  <br/>
deeply you dig into the sources ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the process of going from the beta brain waves of being wide awake  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I find the same with meditation. The first 10 minutes is spent  <br/>
getting there. So I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s not just alpha waves alone that  <br/>
indicates hypnosis or meditation if Mulholland found they were in the  <br/>
majority after 30 seconds of watching TV. (I wonder if the same is  <br/>
true when a play starts which in essence isn&#39;t any different from TV.  <br/>
Reading might be different since the brain needs to decode to get to  <br/>
the story.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-175789738">Loving this conversation, and wondering if someone can help me with this assertion from the blog from a local group I joined and then never did anything with when I figured out they were hysterically anti-TV:<br/>
_____________________________________________________________________<br/>
For those who are not familiar with the brain, there are three components (triune brain model) that control different types of functioning. <br/>
<br/>
*There is the Neo-Cortex which is responsible for higher level thinking, language, conscious thought, problem solving, sensory perception, and reasoning. It is part of the mammal brain only and really defines us as human in many ways.<br/>
<br/>
*There is the Limbic System which is responsible for behavior, emotions, long term memory, and olfaction.<br/>
<br/>
and then there is the:<br/>
*Reptilian Brain or R-complex which is the basic fight or flight level of the brain responsible for rage, protection, and basic survival mechanisms.<br/>
<br/>
When children watch television, the screen they are viewing places them in the reptilian part of their brain where they are incapable of the the other levels of functioning. Their heart and respiratory rates increase and they are simply taking in input and analyzing it for no more than basic information...<br/>
<br/>
Now I have heard many people say, &quot;but my child learns so much from educational TV&quot;. This is not possible because higher level thought is not possible. They will be able to repeat what they heard, but the actual processing, understanding, and assimilation of that information is not happening.<br/>
<br/>
Now here is the scary part, when your brain is put into reptilian functioning, it does not come out of it from 30 minutes to 3 hours! So if say, your child watch a bit of Sesame Street in the morning just before a visit to the museum or even a play date with her friend, it is likely she will not be able to take in any beneficial input or experiences due to the assault that just happened in the form of big bird.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;d say, prove it!  Really, how does she know this to be true?  Not only does it fly in the face of logical reasoning, how does she KNOW that watching TV puts a child into reptilian brain activities?  That actually seems absurd to me, since it is, according to her, the part of the brain for fight or flight.  That, to me, puts it automatically out of the realm of TV watching.  Otherwise the person doing the TV watching would be fighting or flighting.  I&#39;d say that TV watching would be more in line with the Neo-Cortex and the Limbic System.  Even more so, since she says a child will stay in that state unable to absorb new information after watching Sesame Street, which would put it clearly in those latter 2, conscious thought, sensory perception, behavior, long term memory, etc.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s doing and &quot;If, then&quot;, but her &quot;then&quot; portion doesn&#39;t match up with her &quot;if&quot; portion, not even remotely!<br/>

<br/>
I know I have relatively recently seen a study applying brain mapping technology where the researchers were surprised by the amount of activity all over the brain from stimuli, instead of the localized sparking they expected. The idea that the brain is way more complex than anyone thinks was the crux of the conclusion. There is a lot more gestalt going on in the brain.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I saw it on tv, so I may have gone blank for a time.<br/>
<br/>
I also saw a cool program about people surviving disaster situations because they remembered something useful they saw on various Discovery channel programs. These included a child who survived 40 minutes buried in an avalanche of snow who remembered to create air pockets as he was swept away, and a couple trapped in a car in a snowy wilderness who were able to manufacture snow shoes from their car seats. <br/>
<br/>
I point out that these folks remembered the lifesaving tips in situations of extreme stress and fear. Maybe this is a case for making examinations super scary? <br/>
<br/>
See? It&#39;s actually very easy to jump from useful information to bullshit in one sentence. ;)<br/>

doesn&#39;t support it! Are people so unsure of themselves, so full of  <br/>
fear that they&#39;re more willing to believe someone who can speak with  <br/>
conviction than their own powers of observation? (Actually I know  <br/>
that&#39;s true. And it&#39;s sad. Well, really, it sounds like their  <br/>
reptilian brains are overtaking their neo-cortex! Which is pretty much  <br/>
what fear does.<br/>
<br/>
I *would* ask if there was a wide range of experiences -- not just the  <br/>
ones they&#39;d expect like watching fights or some such ;-) but baby  <br/>
nursing, ballet, playing Monopoly, reading, studying something  <br/>
frustrating ;-) and so on -- studied to see which and how much each  <br/>
trigger the reptilian brain, but I don&#39;t see any research that even  <br/>
supports TV triggering it. Real scientists look for patterns of  <br/>
behavior, they don&#39;t merely test one thing to see if it&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
I did a quick search on the reptilian brain and TV and turn up this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eruptingmind.com/effects-of-tv-on-brain/">http://www.eruptingmind.com/effects-of-tv-on-brain/</a><br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.eruptingmind.com/reptilian-brain-behavior/">http://www.eruptingmind.com/reptilian-brain-behavior/</a><br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s the only place I saw it glancing at the top few dozen  <br/>
results. So even other TV fear mongers don&#39;t take it seriously. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
You could reply and say that&#39;s interesting and does she have any  <br/>
research -- not just articles from other TV haters! -- that supports  <br/>
it, that you&#39;d like to look into it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Is that article more about deliberate propaganda than TV watching? I  <br/>
&gt; &gt; vaguely remember reading it years ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hiddenmysteries.com/freebook/neuro/sutphen.html">http://www.hiddenmysteries.com/freebook/neuro/sutphen.html</a><br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not sure that was on line at the time I wrote what I did. As far as I  <br/>
&gt; remember, none of the anti-TV people I read was citing the research  <br/>
&gt; done by Krugman or Mulholland, just citing Dick Sutphen citing the  <br/>
&gt; research. When someone doesn&#39;t care what research means, only if it  <br/>
&gt; sounds like it supports their theory, I guess it doesn&#39;t matter how  <br/>
&gt; deeply you dig into the sources ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hmm... Dick Sutphen seems convinced that subliminal programming works but I&#39;m not. His tapes that I used in the 1990s have a hypnosis session on side 1 and subliminal suggestions embedded into music on side 2 and they&#39;re supposed to be used in conjunction with each other - side 1 once a day, side 2 as often as you like. Listening to side 2 as often as I liked reminded me of the time in the early 80s when my first step to quitting smoking was buying &quot;extra mild&quot; cigarettes that I had to suck on like a vacuum cleaner on steroids, as the saying goes, to get any sensation at all that I was actually smoking a cigarette; it was such an unsatisfying experience I was smoking more cigarettes to compensate, which in fact was the worst possible outcome, so I dropped that idea. With Dick Sutphen&#39;s tapes, I was sometimes listening to side 2 over and over for hours on end and that was wearing and very unsatisfying. If there was any effect at all I think it would have come from knowing already what the &quot;subliminal&quot; messages were and being reminded of them when I heard the music. That would be &quot;programming&quot; by association if anything (&quot;anchoring&quot; as they call it in NLP), not subliminal programming. But I don&#39;t think there was any effect. Side 2 always seemed like it was just music.<br/>
<br/>
About five years ago, maybe four, I trialled something called Think Right Now For Windows on my computer. That was something more like the &quot;eat popcorn and drink coke&quot; idea - messages flashed onto the screen for a fraction of a second that supposedly bypassed my critical faculties and went directly into my subconscious mind. So, I could sit at my computer all day happily doing whatever I was doing while subliminally reprogramming myself. No sweat, no hours in the gym, etc. There was another version of this being heavily promoted at the time as technology the government tried to ban (alluding to the eat popcorn thing) - buy it now while you still can and that kind of line. After 30 days of using the Think Right Now software it had produced no noticeable effect and I wrote it off as a waste of $25. <br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s a major problem with claims about subliminal programming, certainly in the world of &quot;personal development&quot; in my own experience, in that nobody who uses it uses it on its own. So it&#39;s often the case that somebody will claim &quot;subliminal programming works&quot; but when they&#39;re questioned it turns out they&#39;re doing other things as well, maybe listening to hypnosis audios, practising &quot;creative visualization&quot;, attending workshops, hanging out at online forums, reading the &#39;right&#39; books, or whatever, and they&#39;re actually in circumstances where their life is improving because of their &quot;personal development regime&quot;, which includes subliminal programming therefore subliminal programming must be a contributing factor, therefore subliminal programming must work.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an awful lot of &quot;mind control&quot; tosh doing the rounds these days, in my opinion.<br/>

I had a run-in a few weeks ago with a PhD who made a similar kind of statement about violent videogames. Her &#39;definitely 110% true&#39; assertion was that research had shown &quot;conclusively&quot; that playing violent videogames produces violent behaviour. So I said the research couldn&#39;t be &quot;conclusive&quot; because it hadn&#39;t included my son who&#39;s played violent videogames for many years and is one of the most pleasant and delightful teenage boys I&#39;ve ever known. She went off in a huff.<br/>

For instance, many shows geared towards children seem to glorify sibling rivalry, encourage consumerism, and present parent/child conflict as &quot;cool&quot; or even a rite of passage.===<br/>
<br/>
My son figured out on his own that much of what is depicted in sitcoms is not remotely how we live our lives, and he figured it out pretty young. If we&#39;d restricted those shows because some of the values were at odds with our own, we would have taken away the opportunity for our son to come to that realization himself. And we also would&#39;ve missed some entertaining tv along the way :).<br/>
<br/>
He knows that in real families sibling rivalry exists but also that those same siblings will have each other&#39;s backs and do kind things for each other -- many of the sitcoms we watch together depict that as well. <br/>
<br/>
Watching Pokemon turned him on to the Pokemon action figures and card game and video games -- he spent a lot of money over the years on Pokemon things, BUT it was a huge passion of his during those years. He wasn&#39;t too interested in too much other tv show-related stuff, and he had no interest at all in which clothes are cool, which shoes are cool, which cellphone is cool, etc. His main passions now are not at all related to tv shows or commercials.<br/>
<br/>
He will tell you he dislikes that parents, especially dads, are often portrayed as idiots, but on some of the shows we watched we really liked the parents (Phil of the Future comes to mind). We wouldn&#39;t have discovered that if we&#39;d not watched the shows. Ironically, our most recent experience with parent/child conflict being seen as cool happened while we watched fireworks over the weekend -- a group of older teens behind us were being pretty tacky about their parents (who were not with them). <br/>
<br/>
You know, you can totally avoid tv yet still walk into the nearest Walmart or take your child to the local park and experience plenty of values at odds with your own!!<br/>
<br/>
Also, don&#39;t automatically assume your kids are picking up on the same things you&#39;re picking up on in tv shows. Ask them what they like about this show or that show while you watch it with them. See the shows they like from a different perspective. <br/>

What&#39;s more lizard-brained than sex or adrenaline/fear?  Neither of  <br/>

<br/>
&quot;The sky is falling&quot; fear-mongering supported by nonsense is amusing,  <br/>
and it&#39;s sad to think that some people are limiting their children&#39;s  <br/>
opportunities for joy and learning because someone who used to teach  <br/>
pre-school says they can&#39;t learn except in pre-school.<br/>
<br/>
Why is she a former director?  She didn&#39;t do well there?  She got  <br/>
burned out and frustrated?  She quit the job to stay home with children?<br/>
<br/>
(I don&#39;t need the answer, I just see the possibilities.)<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine is the director of several pre-schools in town here-- <br/>
not the buildings, but the personnel.    She has a master&#39;s in early  <br/>
childhood ed that she got in one year.  Lots of people were in that  <br/>
one-year program.  They certainly did no real research in a year of  <br/>
cramming in reading and reports.   When her boys were young, she  <br/>
assured her husband that they would never have any imaginations if  <br/>
they watched movies or videos, so when he was watching a movie at  <br/>
home, the boys could be in the room and listen (and form pictures in  <br/>
their minds), but couldn&#39;t gaze upon the visuals.  They would play  <br/>
with lego or cars behind the couch to make sure they couldn&#39;t see it.<br/>
<br/>
Things changed there, partly because of conversations with me, but I  <br/>
never asked for a follow-up.  When they moved, the big new tv was set  <br/>
up in such a way that there was nowhere to hide from it.   Also they  <br/>
have rock band and some other video games.  But she cared more about  <br/>
some of the things she read in that one single year (I shudder) of  <br/>
&quot;master&#39;s program&quot; than about observing her own children.<br/>
<br/>
One of the worst things about education as it exists these days,  <br/>
especially &quot;department of education&quot; education, is that the first  <br/>
premise is that what you see with your own eyes should be rejected in  <br/>
favor of the opinion of &quot;a researcher.&quot;  Then they imagine themselves  <br/>
to be researchers.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I had wanted to be a teacher from the time I was six years  <br/>
old, when I went to college at 17 I already knew that the college of  <br/>
education was not a respected entity.  And even though I went to a  <br/>
place where they were doing and talking real research in the  <br/>
alternative-education field (disproving school&#39;s pet practices), I did  <br/>
NOT want an education degree because it was a shameful thing compared  <br/>
to the college of arts and sciences.  I got an English degree, minor  <br/>
in psychology, and then took the education courses on top of that.  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t even want a minor in education.  (I did enough anthropology for  <br/>
a minor too, and had I ever known about anthropology before I got  <br/>
there I might&#39;ve just studied that and nothing else. :-)<br/>

Great, it gives us fodder for conversation. Most of the other families my kids meet have values different from my own - arguably All of them have Some values different from mine, and most make different choices than I do. Television gives us a way to talk about that without the context being &quot;loaded&quot; with personal feelings about people and relationships. <br/>

First of all, that&#39;s not my perception, but maybe my kids watch different shows than yours. Mine don&#39;t watch much in the way of &quot;schooly&quot; shows or family sitcoms.

I often find people with the worst impressions of television don&#39;t - the &quot;free&quot; programming is really not very good, for the most part, so if you want better quality, invest in cable/satellite. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve yet to meet any unschooling kids who glorify sibling rivalry or conflict with parents, or &quot;consumerism&quot; for that matter. Why would they? Those are all things that are results of kids&#39; not getting enough emotional support. Its not like tv &quot;causes&quot; any of that. If you want to point a finger, point it at a system that tears children away from their parents for eight hours a day five days a week!<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m looking for suggestions for TV shows to watch with Zoe (12) that  <br/>
&gt; would have good material for inspiring thinking and talking about  <br/>
&gt; relationships.  Relationship dynamics between parents and kids, girls and boys etc. are all interesting to her and I&#39;d like to find some shows that we might watch together either online, or on DVDs via Netflix.<br/>

I have 3 girls that are 14, 13 and almost 11. They really enjoy watching The Middle and Modern Family on Hulu. They also like Dr. Who, Malcolm in the Middle, Everybody Loves Raymond, The Cosby Show, Unnatural History, That&#39;s So Raven, Wizards of Waverly Place, Spongebob Squarepants, Fringe and movies based on the books by Jane Austen. They also enjoy decorating/hoarding shows and documentaries on philosophy, religion, food, animals, conspiracy theories, politics and history (especially Ancient Egypt). <br/>
<br/>
Not all of those are specifically relationship focused, but I think pretty much everything ties into relationships in one way or another. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1177061106"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt;&gt; How do you feel about your child seeing lots of messages promoting <br/>
&gt; values that are at odds with your own?<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Great, it gives us fodder for conversation. Most of the other families <br/>
&gt; my kids meet have values different from my own - arguably All of them <br/>
&gt; have.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And - on tv the values are often exaggerated for comic or dramatic <br/>
effect, unlike in friends and family where differences might be glossed <br/>
over a lot, in order to get along with each other without open conflict.<br/>
<br/>
I might not say much, if anything, about an actual acquaintance or <br/>
friend or extended family member who sleeps around a lot, but Barney <br/>
Stimson&#39;s behavior on &quot;How I Met Your Mother&quot; is SO extreme and such a <br/>
part of the show that the topic of promiscuity can&#39;t help but come up. <br/>
As much as we might enjoy that show, I&#39;m not in the slightest worried <br/>
about my kids (or my husband or myself) thinking of Barney as a good <br/>
role model.<br/>
<br/>
Same with shows for little kids.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to add that the &quot;conversation&quot; is not even necessary. We&#39;re <br/>
lucky when our kids do talk with us about stuff, but if they don&#39;t, it <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean they are not analyzing and processing and contrasting what <br/>
they&#39;re watching with their own family dynamics. Thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-374772856">Why TV shows and not movies?<br/>
<br/>
There was a discussion somewhere a while back about movies for parents  <br/>
to watch with kids, I think.  I hope I saved some of it.<br/>
<br/>
Good for me!  Upper left:<br/>
