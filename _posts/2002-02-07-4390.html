&lt;&lt; Eric jumped out of his car, ran<br/>
ahead, picked up the trash and said to the man &quot;excuse me sir, you dropped<br/>
this.&quot; The startled guy actually said &quot;thank you&quot; and took it back!  I don&#39;t<br/>
know if he detected sarcasm or not. (Today Eric probably would have been<br/>
shot.) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No wonder you love him!<br/>

(I&#39;ve met Eric, and Susan and their daughters, and they are just about the <br/>
coolest family you can imagine.)<br/>
