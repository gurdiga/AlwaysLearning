<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046138859">&lt;&lt;I think schools should be more like libraries...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of my best friends do &quot;school at home&quot; and started a class day.  The<br/>
families pitch in and hire a tutor or one of the parents teaches the class.<br/>
What an eye opener the first year was for my friends.  They could tell such<br/>
a difference between the kids that wanted to be there and the kids that<br/>
didn&#39;t, the kids who were engaged and the kids who were being forced.<br/>
<br/>
They talked to me about it because I was heading up the drama club (I<br/>
refused to call it a class) and we were having so much fun.  I talked with<br/>
them about the right to choose, and respecting even those under 18 years<br/>
old.<br/>
<br/>
My friends made a rule that kids can only come if they want to be there (no<br/>
mama made me stuff) and that the child is responsible for their class,<br/>
assignments, test scores, etc..<br/>
<br/>
It is working beautifully and the tutors comment on what a high functioning<br/>
group the kids are.<br/>
