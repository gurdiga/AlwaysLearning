<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126615523">A couple of weeks ago three high school boys in our town (Deer Lodge, MT)<br/>
were caught video taping girls in the locker room and shower at the<br/>
school.   They had set up six cameras to record at different times and<br/>
locations and a seventh camera behind a two way mirror in the wall<br/>
between the boys and girls locker rooms.    One of the boys would<br/>
actually have to stand in there to do the recording. <br/>
So, all the girls at the school and every girl on basketball teams or<br/>
volley ball teams from seven other schools that have come here to<br/>
compete, are to one degree or another, on those tapes.  <br/>
This is the second year the boys have been taping.   There is no way to<br/>
be sure of the number of tapes they made (ten were confiscated) or the<br/>
number of copies they made or how many others they shared the tapes with,<br/>
here or over the Internet.<br/>
<br/>
Their trial was Monday and today the local paper published their<br/>
sentences.   Thirty days in jail and 250 hours community service.   <br/>
The boys are the sons of prominent citizens and they have always gotten<br/>
good grades and have been good at sports.   &quot;In spite of that&quot; the judge<br/>
said, it was such a serious offence that the sentence had to be tough. <br/>
Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m left thinking homeschoolers won&#39;t be having to answer that &quot;what<br/>
about socialization?&quot; question around here for awhile.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe the boys had recently watched the movie &quot;Porky&#39;s&quot;.<br/>
Sounds real familiar to what I remember in that movie.<br/>
Actually, it was pretty funny (at the time ;-).<br/>
