<div id="ygrps-yiv-765999485">Hi everyone,<br/>
I am finding this thread interesting and hoping to hear what other parents<br/>
have to say about this.<br/>
I have such a hard time with bed times with all of my kids (11, 3 and 2)<br/>
With a new baby due any day - I&#39;m feeling a bit scared about the whole bed<br/>
time deal.<br/>
Mainly because if I let them just get &quot;sleepy&quot; - they usually get really<br/>
wired up first -- and then it&#39;s really late and I&#39;m ready for the box. LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Dh and I can&#39;t watch our normal programming because it&#39;s not something we&#39;d<br/>
necessarily want them to watch it.<br/>
And last but not least -- the intimacy thing can be a problem.  I sometimes<br/>
feel that I don&#39;t get any alone time with DH.....<br/>
Trying to conceive this baby was tough! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions????<br/>
<br/>
I am an attachment parenting kind of mom - but I guess this area I need a<br/>
little help with.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
God Bless!<br/>

&lt;&lt;      Now about the not enforcing a bedtime - WHY??? Your kids do not <br/>
<br/>
need you to help them sleep and you being there probably actually <br/>
<br/>
keeps them from sleeping well. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids have always, since they were babies, before we had any inkling we <br/>
would be homeschooling, gone to sleep when they were sleepy.  They needed my<br/>
help <br/>
when they were nursing, because they nursed to sleep.  The needed my help <br/>
when I read or sang to them, when they wanted me to.  They needed my help to<br/>
make <br/>
them a bed.  But they didn&#39;t need my help to say &quot;It&#39;s time,&quot; because every <br/>
single night, they went to sleep at some point, when they were sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;you being there probably actually <br/>
<br/>
keeps them from sleeping well&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing you&#39;re not a family bed advocate. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When babies sleep with their parents, it can be longer before they want to <br/>
sleep alone.  Mine all want to sleep alone now, but there were times for all<br/>
of <br/>
them when they preferred to sleep with someone else.  Because they had <br/>
choices, we know they are sleeping alone now from choice, not because they<br/>
gave up or <br/>
because they resent us and want us away from them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It is not against the unschooling <br/>
<br/>
train of thought to insist that your children be in their rooms by a <br/>
<br/>
certain time each night.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It might be against the attachment parenting train of thought, and for some <br/>
families there&#39;s not a difference.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If he is not ready <br/>
<br/>
by 7:30 then no stories and he has to put himself to bed and we do <br/>
<br/>
only hugs and kisses&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s more punitive than our family would ever have been comfortable with. <br/>
<br/>
That seems plainly &quot;training,&quot; and not offering choices in the most open, <br/>
positive way.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Perhaps letting them <br/>
<br/>
understand how to put themselves to sleep is a gift you could give <br/>
<br/>
them now, and the gift to your family would be a stronger <br/>
<br/>
relationship between you and your dh. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids don&#39;t &quot;put themselves to sleep.&quot;  Neither do I.  I fall asleep happy<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I was little, going to bed was often an unhappy thing, a <br/>
feeling-mom-is-mean thing, a scary thing, and a punitive-feeling thing.  I<br/>
never wanted that <br/>
for my children, and they&#39;ve never had it.  Yet they sleep!<br/>
<br/>
All my children put together have had fewer nightmares than I had in any <br/>
single year of my childhood from the time I was seven or so.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Remember that freedom is no <br/>
<br/>
longer freedom when it infringes on the rights of others.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It has never seemed fair to me when parents claim many more freedoms than <br/>
their children have.  Adult understanding and compassion should be larger by<br/>
far <br/>
than child-understanding and compassion.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We don&#39;t have bedtimes in our house, not for any of us.  We just don&#39;t<br/>
schedule things for early in the mornings -- the beauty of homeschooling!!<br/>
My dd and I usually get to bed anywhere from 9-11pm, and my dh usually gets<br/>
to bed by 1am.  These days we are all sleeping in late.<br/>
<br/>
I usually get sleepy before my dd.  She still isn&#39;t willing to play by<br/>
herself, so she often will decide to come to bed with me.  Sometimes, when<br/>
she does she ends up falling asleep really really quickly.  Sometimes we<br/>
end up talking and giggling far longer than I would have, but I&#39;m still OK<br/>
and having fun.  Sometimes I&#39;m just so wiped out that I need to get to<br/>
sleep, and if she really isn&#39;t ready to sleep then we try to come up with<br/>
some option that will work for both of us... I may try to fall asleep on<br/>
the couch, she may agree to get up and play in her room, she may talk her<br/>
Dad into not working for awhile.  You can&#39;t really predict what it will be<br/>
like each and every day, and that&#39;s OK too.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that is really important is for me to remember myself, and to go<br/>
to bed before I go over the edge.  I&#39;m no fun to be around when I&#39;m too<br/>
tired.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My dh and I spend time together during the day.  We like this so much<br/>
better, because we are each awake ;-)  It&#39;s much easier for our dd to find<br/>
something to do for awhile compared to late in the evening, and the only<br/>
thing we ask is that she not come into our room and interrupt us.  She<br/>
would prefer to be with us rather than to be alone, but this is one choice<br/>
that I&#39;m not willing to give her.  We don&#39;t require that she stay in one<br/>
room, or do any one thing, just that she give us our privacy.  We&#39;re really<br/>
lucky that we can do this (my dh works from home most of the time), but<br/>
even so I&#39;d probably do the same thing in the early evenings if we didn&#39;t<br/>
have the daytime hours.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t get TV reception, and watched so little TV that it&#39;s not cost<br/>
effective to pay for satellite.  We do get Netflix movies, and mix them up<br/>
so sometimes our dd watches something she wants in one room and my dh and I<br/>
watch something else in another room.  If our dd comes in we don&#39;t worry<br/>
about it -- if she doesn&#39;t like it she will tell us, and it&#39;s so easy to<br/>
just pause a movie.<br/>
<br/>
Other things that have worked in the past, in case you need some other<br/>
ideas:  my dd and I have often gone to sleep really early, say 8-9pm, I<br/>
sleep for several hours, get up around 11pm and then spend some time with<br/>
my dh.  Or, either my dh or I would awake in the really early morning hours<br/>
and we&#39;d decide to get up to spend some time then, then both go back to<br/>
sleep.<br/>
<br/>

it, I thought that it was another &quot;boy toy&quot;, tv gadget. It has<br/>
totally changed the way we watch tv! I can tape things for the boys<br/>
and they can pick it out of the now playing list, we can set up<br/>
season passes so that shows are automatically taped and I can tape<br/>
a lot of my craft or decorating shows that are on during the day<br/>
that I normally would miss. It is so much easier to tape and find<br/>
the shows again to watch then using a vcr. You can even start<br/>
watching a show from the beginning while it is still taping. And dh<br/>
loves being able to rewind live tv for his own instant replays. Not<br/>
to mention the kids love to be able to rewind their shows and watch<br/>
parts over and over again and that they do not have wait for a show<br/>
to on...we tape all their shows and they are ready whenever they<br/>
want to watch them. No more being tied to a tv schedule!<br/>
<br/>
End tivo commercial. ;o) I now return you to your regular unschooling<br/>
list...<br/>
