ones that lovingly accept what may be difficult for them? Ben has a very <br/>
conservative/traditionalc background too---small Southern town/the <br/>
Citadel/military service---but is quite agreeable to all the changes we&#39;ve <br/>
made. He even had breakfast with his mother this morning---and she wants <br/>
websites/books/info about unschooling! WOW!!! She may even be at the <br/>
conference!!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway---Hats off to the hardworking dads that contribute in so many ways to <br/>
our unschooling!<br/>
