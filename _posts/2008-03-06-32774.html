<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193386131">All this talk of what is and isn&#39;t unschooling has got me to really <br/>
thinking.  As I&#39;ve mentioned before, I am fairly new to this although <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading on this site and a couple of others as well as <br/>
reading books, websites (Sandra&#39;s and others), blogs, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Since I come from a background of public schooling (both as a student <br/>
and a teacher) I am questioning what I do and asking myself if it is <br/>
or is not unschooling.  Okay here is an example:<br/>
<br/>
We went to the park yesterday and my daughter (8 yo)asked me to play <br/>
with her.  As we were on the giant play structure, I looked down at <br/>
the platform we were standing on and noticed that it was in the shape <br/>
of a hexagon.  I said, &quot;Look, a hexagon!&quot;  Dd looked down, then <br/>
walked the perimeter of it counting the sides to make sure it was <br/>
indeed a hexagon with 6 sides.  During our play, she would sometimes <br/>
notice hexagons and I would point some out to her.  After we found a <br/>
few, she said, &quot;That&#39;s all the shapes I want to find&quot; and I <br/>
said, &quot;Okay.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Last night as I thought about our day, I wondered if I was being too <br/>
schoolish.  Maybe I should not have even pointed the hexagon out to <br/>
her.   In the past (like the recent past!), I would turn everything <br/>
into an &quot;educational experience.&quot;  This time, though, I just noticed <br/>
the hexagon and drew my daughter&#39;s attention to it before I thought. <br/>
I love patterns (patterns in nature, quilt patterns, etc.), and so I <br/>
just naturally commented on it.  I didn&#39;t require her to find any of <br/>
the shapes, but I wonder if maybe she was trying to please me or if <br/>
she was interested in it as well.  She seemed to be interested. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am just not totally sure what unschooling really looks <br/>
like.   When I first discovered the term unschooling, I thought it <br/>
meant pretty much hands off.  I now know that is not true, but I <br/>
spent the first month or so thinking that was what it was.  Then I <br/>
joined this group and lately there have been some really good topics <br/>
that have me thinking more and more. <br/>
<br/>
Guess I am still unsure of myself.  The above situation felt natural <br/>
to me, but then I wonder if I don&#39;t really know what natural feels <br/>
like since my past has probably altered my conception of reality.    <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Since you&#39;ve used that as educational lessons in the past it will take <br/>
a while for it to feel natural.  What you did sounds natural enough.  <br/>
Your daughter&#39;s response sounds natural for a kid who is used to having <br/>
her mom &quot;teach&quot; her everything rather than point things out for the <br/>
coolness that it is.  <br/>
<br/>
If you were with a friend, saying &quot;oh, cool, look the playground is in <br/>
the shape of a hexagon&quot;, might be perfectly natural, but to go on and <br/>
on, wouldn&#39;t.  If your friend or daughter, started to point out of cool <br/>
shapes, then the conversation continues, but if the friend, or daughter <br/>
starts to point out the neat trees or talk about the weather or <br/>
yesterday&#39;s happening, then the conversation has veered in an equally <br/>
natural direction.<br/>
<br/>
I point things out to my kids all the time, some of it they are <br/>
interested in and other things they aren&#39;t.  They point things out to <br/>
me too, often things that I&#39;ve missed and they haven&#39;t, and that&#39;s <br/>
equally cool in a totally different way.<br/>
<br/>
If I never pointed things out to my kids, it would feel as equally <br/>
artificial as pointing out things to &quot;teach&quot; them something.</div>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling is supporting her interests. If she seems interested, then  <br/>
that&#39;s great. If she looks at you like you&#39;ve got two heads, then  <br/>
she&#39;s not interested and you won&#39;t be pointing out interesting shapes  <br/>
to her, for a while at least.<br/>
<br/>
What you could watch out for are your own biases in what you think are  <br/>
interesting things. I mean - was it actually interesting because it  <br/>
was 6-sided and you just mentioned that it is called a hexagon or are  <br/>
you saying it was interesting because you really wanted her to learn  <br/>
the name of a hexagon because that&#39;s on the list, in your head, of  <br/>
things a kid should know?<br/>
<br/>
Only you can answer that.<br/>
<br/>
Even if it is the latter - if you&#39;re paying close attention to what  <br/>
interests her and supporting that, you&#39;ll move further into  <br/>
unschooling pretty quickly. Maybe try to find things that are  <br/>
interesting that would NOT be on a school&#39;s list of things kids should  <br/>
know - that&#39;ll be a good exercise for you to undo your school-think.<br/>

That sounds like a lovely moment of connection to me where you pointed something out <br/>
that you noticed and she hadn&#39;t, she played with the notion for a few minutes, told you <br/>
when she was finished and you went on to something else.  I don&#39;t see any coercion, <br/>
unless you left out that part about you forcibly turning her head to see the hexagon &lt;g&gt;.   <br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean children left alone to figure out the world.  My picture of it is a <br/>
dance where one leads, then the other leads, switching off when appropriate.  (I guess it&#39;s <br/>
more of a modern dance.)  I have the unique position of having more general knowledge <br/>
about the world and more experience in finding resources, etc.  Sometimes it&#39;s my <br/>
children having the energy and interest, which leads us.  It might spark me, and I might <br/>
follow them, I might find something that adds to that energy/interest, I might just watch.  <br/>
I might have something brand new to add to the mix that ends up changing the direction, <br/>
or not.  I might be the one with the interest or idea that they are sparked by.  And it all <br/>
flows along.  When there are lulls, I will increase my energy for going places or playing a <br/>
new game, or bringing home a new book, or something else that seems called for.<br/>

I think, because both of my children really like the pattern blocks <br/>
we have and play with them regularly, I mentioned it because I <br/>
thought she would be interested in it.  But, it is possible that at <br/>
the back of my mind without really thinking, I&#39;m testing her to see <br/>
if she remembers the shape.  This definately takes some thinking on <br/>

want to be where life is interesting, around interesting people, even if it<br/>
doesn&#39;t specifically, instantly interests them. It&#39;s important they know<br/>
they&#39;ve got an informative tour guide through childhood ::bg::<br/>
When the intent is sharing what rocks my world, the information makes far<br/>
more sense (as it has context and relationship) and has purpose in our life.<br/>

<br/>
Diana&#39;s right, but saying &quot;this is a hexagon&quot; isn&#39;t the interesting  <br/>
part, is it?   WHY was it a hexagon?  Stronger?  Greater area for not  <br/>
much more steel?  (Rubber coated steel, I&#39;m guessing, which is  <br/>
expensive.)  And I&#39;ve seen some hexagonal playground platforms that  <br/>
allowed access from three sides, and had three railings.  That&#39;s  <br/>
pretty cool.  More kids fit, more kids can get in and out, so more  <br/>
peace and more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Hexagonal platforms are probably stronger, too.  More stable.  They  <br/>
can be held up with three posts easier than a rectangular platform  <br/>
can be.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re going to say what something is, don&#39;t stop there.  (Or if  <br/>
the kid has no interest, stop there. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
