<div id="ygrps-yiv-624845377">Because of my asking about Dads supporting homeschooling before divorce and <br/>
then changing their minds on another list, a single parent homeschooling <br/>
mother has started a list.   You might want to pass this on to any single <br/>
parents you know who hs or want to.<br/>

Single Parent&#39;s Home Education Support<br/>
<br/>
This is a safe place to discuss issues about custody, visitation and<br/>
maintaining educational continuity for your home educated child during<br/>
separation and divorce.  It is also a place for parents who are overwhelmed<br/>
with being the only caregiver for their child (whether the other parent has<br/>
ever been involved or not) and how to deal with the stresses and share the<br/>
joys of doing so.<br/>
