<br/>
1. The freedom to be true to who they are, all the time, at peace with themselves, happy, loved and nurtured.<br/>
<br/>
2. Free to discover everything and anything that interests them - everyday.<br/>
<br/>
3. Limitless and independent in their thinking. Making their own decisions in exploration of the world.<br/>
<br/>
4. Family time is limitless, not constricted to 4 hours in the evening competing with unnecessary homework, reading and bathtime.   The kids play with one another, feel closer to one another.  This week alone my kids ( dd 7, ds 10) have laughed so hard they peed in their pants at least 4 times!!!! <br/>
<br/>
5. They are each so happy to be home with mom.  I have heard this many times from each of them and have been the recipient of hugs and even an unrequested  kiss on the cheek from ds!! WOW<br/>
<br/>
Since reading some of John Taylor Gatto, they are NEVER going back!!!!!!<br/>
