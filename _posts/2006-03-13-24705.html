can&#39;t remember studying her at school.  But I can remember reading a<br/>
mystery book where one of the clues was a wrong facing Eagle which was<br/>
a marker for the Underground Railway.<br/>

I remember that Harriet Tubman had a disease that caused her to fall asleep suddenly and with no regard to where she was or what she was doing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall *studying* Amelia at all when I was in school, but have read/seen a number of things about her in the past 10 years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-472184173">Yesterday, while unpacking, I came across a book about Harriet Tubman and a  <br/>
book about Amelia Earhart.  Before unschooling, when Brenna was maybe 10,  we <br/>
were using an Oak Meadow curriculum and they must be from that time.<br/>
 <br/>
So I asked both kids what they knew about these women.  Logan  (12) knew that <br/>
Amelia Earhart was a pilot who they think was lost at sea in the  Bermuda <br/>
Triangle.  He thought he&#39;d seen a reference to it on Family Guy or  maybe some <br/>
other TV show.  <br/>
 <br/>
Brenna remembers Amelia Earhart having a gap between her teeth and  people <br/>
teaching her to smile without showing it.  She knew general  information about <br/>
her also but that is what sticks out in her mind.<br/>
 <br/>
 She knew Harriet Tubman was involved in the underground railroad but  what <br/>
she remembers most about her was that she had narcolepsy from being hit in  the <br/>
head by a brick which caused her to fall asleep during meetings.<br/>
 <br/>
She said that she knew both of those things from sources other than the  <br/>
books I made her read when she was 10!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
