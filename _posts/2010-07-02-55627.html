<div id="ygrps-yiv-760082370">I discovered today that MANY people on the list received side e-mails  <br/>
from a recent &quot;professional.&quot;  I&#39;m sorry I let her stay on the list as  <br/>
long as I did.  It wasn&#39;t fair to those who are here to discuss  <br/>
unschooling openly and honestly.  I was giving her the benefit of the  <br/>
doubt, thinking she would (as some people do) turn around and say  <br/>
&quot;OH!  This is cool.&quot;   That did not happen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What was sent to one person (maybe several, but it doesn&#39;t matter now);<br/>
<br/>
-=-They won&#39;t put my posts on the group. I am only here to discover  <br/>
ways to meet the needs of children + hardly make money from my  <br/>
website. I wish I did. This is a passion of mine + that is why I do  <br/>
it. All my contributions to this group have been discarded + have had  <br/>
to email people individually to explain the misunderstandings +  <br/>
generalisations made about me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
According to her website she has already (all by herself, it seems)  <br/>
identified what children need.  (&quot;I have identified what children need  <br/>
to be happy and successful.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
It is not true that ALL her contributions had been discarded. If  <br/>
someone will tell one lie, all the rest of what they say becomes  <br/>
suspect.<br/>
<br/>
If she wanted to know more about unschooling, these sites were cited  <br/>
more than once in recent discussions:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
So that wasn&#39;t true either.  It wasn&#39;t about learning or discovery.<br/>
<br/>
But this is what I want to spotlight:<br/>
<br/>
-=-. All my contributions to this group have been discarded + have had  <br/>
to email people individually to explain the misunderstandings +  <br/>
generalisations made about me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;  + have had to email people individually &quot;<br/>
<br/>
She did NOT &quot;have to&quot; email anyone.<br/>
She did not &quot;have to&quot; join the list.<br/>
<br/>
In order to be courteous and welcome she would have had to follow the  <br/>
guidelines of the list, and answer questions such as &quot;Are you an  <br/>
unschooler?&quot;  But she didn&#39;t have to do that either.  And chose not  <br/>
to.  But she chose to send individual e-mails to several members of  <br/>
the list.  Didn&#39;t have to.<br/>
<br/>
If someone hopes to make any money or to have a reputation for being  <br/>
knowledgeable, thoughtful and rational, it&#39;s good to practice those  <br/>
traits and to be scrupulously honest and forthcoming.<br/>
<br/>
Not knowing the difference between &quot;I had to&quot; and &quot;I chose to&quot; will  <br/>
prevent any understanding of unschooling.<br/>
