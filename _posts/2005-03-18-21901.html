<div id="ygrps-yiv-1240211279">I couldn&#39;t resist sharing this one.  I was commenting to my son the other<br/>
night that even though he was happy when we took him out of school he just<br/>
seems to get happier and happier with unschooling.   And this was his<br/>
reply...<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

&quot;Mom, I&#39;m like a fish that is drawn to an angler fish whose bait is<br/>
homeschooling.&quot;  Ds 7 years old<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For those of you who don&#39;t know, an angler fish is one of those weird freaks<br/>
of nature that live in the deep ocean and have these strange limbs that<br/>
dangle in front of their mouths and light up to lure other fish.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Yes, the analogy does break down a bit if you think on it too much, but I<br/>
thought it was so cute. <br/>
