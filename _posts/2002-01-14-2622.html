&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Maybe it depends not only on the child, but on the<br/>
relationship that the divorcing parents have with the<br/>
child. My father was a kind drunk (no abuse, just<br/>
cheerfully drunk all the time) who rarely kept the<br/>
promises he often made and was generally<br/>
there-but-not-there. So losing him didn&#39;t have much<br/>
impact.<br/>

Wow, this sounds almost like my dad! He could be<br/>
abusive to my mom on occasion though. My parents<br/>
divorced when I was 6 and the only feeling type memory<br/>
I have from it is relief. I was really glad when he<br/>
moved out. Home life became much more peaceful and my<br/>
mom was so much happier. I have a relationship with my<br/>
dad now, but it&#39;s so superficial. I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
talking to him about anything in depth. If I&#39;ve ever<br/>
tried to bring up anything in the least bit &#39;deep&#39;, he<br/>
changes the subject or leaves straight away. Poor guy,<br/>
he&#39;s so emotionally stunted.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My father wasn&#39;t abusive etc but he didn&#39;t really show much interest in<br/>
his children. He was out at work all day and it was my mother who took<br/>
us to the beach, played with us and cooked meals. I don&#39;t even recall<br/>
him from weekends. I think he was a typical father of the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s.<br/>
Not the prime carer.<br/>
This was the reason his leaving had little impact. Apart from having to<br/>
move house and going on the UK equivelent (sp?) of welfare. Thats what I<br/>
noticed really. Not having any money, not the absence of a father.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-308652831">Again, I think it probably depends some on the child and some on the <br/>
relationship between the father and the child. If there is no real<br/>
relationship -- Dad is a guy who shows up evenings and weekends and heads<br/>
directly for the garage -- some (many? most? don&#39;t know) children may really<br/>
not feel much angst at his leaving permanently.<br/>

I don&#39;t remember any distinctions being draw in the<br/>
original post regarding children of an amicable<br/>
divorce and children of an antagonistic divorce. It<br/>
seemed to me to indicate children of *all* divorced<br/>
parents. Of course not all men are abusive, etc.<br/>
Tamzin&#39;s dad is a lovely, kindhearted man. His new<br/>
wife is equally lovely and has a wonderfully close<br/>
bond with Tamzin. We started doing a family tree and<br/>
there was no question of the fact that Sadie would be<br/>
included on our family tree (as well as her new<br/>
granny, aunts and cousins - Tamzin&#39;s delighted to have<br/>
cousins!). <br/>
Unfortunately, I also think there is a lot more abuse<br/>
going on in the world than people would care to admit<br/>
(by abuse I mean emotional as well as physical). A lot<br/>
of people raised in abusive households seem to seek it<br/>
out as adults (not consciously, of course). <br/>
Also, if the husband *is* bored and doesn&#39;t *want* to<br/>
take care of his children, wouldn&#39;t he make a crap<br/>
parent anyhow? <br/>
Just my various different thoughts on the subject.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55207815">-=-I don&#39;t remember any distinctions being draw in the<br/>
original post regarding children of an amicable<br/>
divorce and children of an antagonistic divorce. It<br/>
seemed to me to indicate children of *all* divorced<br/>
parents. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it was me or not.  I was very unhappy with my parents&#39; <br/>
divorce, and I was 17/18 at the time.  My sister was 13/14 and it messed her <br/>
up quite a bit.  The two cousins my parents had been raising were 14 and 18, <br/>
and they were just kind of released to the universe--their second major loss <br/>
of family.<br/>
<br/>
My dad wasn&#39;t abusive at all.  His next wife was of SUCH a different <br/>
tradition and mindset is was jarring at the least and insane on the worst <br/>
days.  (It didn&#39;t last long.)<br/>
<br/>
There are issues besides &quot;do I miss my dad being here?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Those who divorce like to soothe themselves that some kids do fine, but many <br/>
ARE hurt, and I think it&#39;s most.  Even if the parent is awful, the message <br/>
that comes to the children is that the mom or dad would rather abandon their <br/>
children than just do better to be there.  And that&#39;s pretty much true.  One <br/>
parent runs the other off because the parents don&#39;t get along, instead of <br/>
them doing their utmost to be good people for the sake of their children.  <br/>
And these same people are often punishing kids for not &quot;being good&quot; (&quot;good&quot; <br/>
being defined by whatever the parents want to make up at the time).   Alcohol <br/>
abuse, gambling, fooling around--those are not habits easy to break.  But <br/>
they could MAYBE wait until the kids are grown and then indulge their nasty <br/>
habits.<br/>
<br/>
I justified all the bad parts of school while I was in.  Maybe I used up all <br/>
my justification there.  Some kids with persuasive parents justify all the <br/>
bad parts of divorce, maybe, and having used up all their justification they <br/>
decide school is a horror show without redemption.<br/>

divorce was fine. It just was. I will not try to talk people out of their bad <br/>
experiences with divorce - I&#39;m sure for many many people it&#39;s awful. My most <br/>
awful moments were knowing that I was glad to not live with my dad anymore. <br/>
He wasn&#39;t overtly abusive or a really bad guy - but he was hard to live with, <br/>
very angry and impulsive. Divorce made him a BETTER dad, more mindful.<br/>
<br/>
If we have bad marriages, that is what our children think marriage is. That&#39;s <br/>
their model. Sometimes divorce is better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Even within the same family, there can be tremendous differences in how<br/>
children respond.  When my dad left, I had nightmares for a very long<br/>
time that he would return.  My brother&#39;s parting words to him threatened<br/>
his life.<br/>
<br/>
My older sister, on the other hand, maintained an almost life long wish<br/>
that our parents would be reunited (and after three &quot;I do&#39;s&quot; I don&#39;t<br/>
think she&#39;s found a happy marriage for herself, yet).  I think the<br/>
difference stems from the child&#39;s relationship to the soon-to-be-missing<br/>
parent.  My sister may well have had a better life if my parents had<br/>
stayed married.  I might not have survived it.<br/>
<br/>
I think some kids are fine after divorce, or AT LEAST better off and I<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s just the abused ones (though that word certainly gets<br/>
used to cover an amazing array of behavior).<br/>
<br/>
I think almost all kids are still hurt by divorce.  Your view of the<br/>
world changes, of marriage, of family, of love, etc.  But, to be<br/>
meaningful, it has to be measured against the hurt of staying.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the marriage hurts even more.  Certainly that would be true<br/>
for adults, why not kids?   Sometimes divorce is the better alternative,<br/>
maybe not a good one, but a better one.<br/>
<br/>
In contemplating my own divorce, knowing I wanted out was the easier<br/>
part.  It was much more difficult to choose between my daughter&#39;s<br/>
unhappiness if I stayed with him and her unhappiness if I didn&#39;t.  Which<br/>
would hurt her more?  To not choose, was to choose.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t tell myself that she&#39;d be okay because I wanted to leave the<br/>
marriage.  I made two choices.  One for what was best for me and one for<br/>
what was best for her.    I probably would have stayed if I thought it<br/>
was best for her though &quot;staying together for the kids&quot; isn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily doing them a favor either.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure everybody doesn&#39;t get divorced for &quot;good&quot; reason, just as they<br/>
don&#39;t necessarily get married for &quot;good&quot; reason.  I once worked for a<br/>
rich (she&#39;d inherited a family fortune) elderly woman who told me she<br/>
divorced her husband because he insisted on working (he was a doctor).<br/>
&quot;No husband of mine is ever going to work,&quot; she spit out as though it<br/>
were a dirty word.  She had two sons and, indeed, they never worked.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you take it one step farther ANYONE  who doesn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;want&quot; to take care of children would (does)make a<br/>
crap child care person.......(ie person who do this<br/>
only for $$$ such as some &quot;teachers&quot;, bus drivers) or<br/>
sibling babysitters who don&#39;t want to, or some<br/>
fathers, sweethearts, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I remember once asking my little sister, when she was<br/>
about 14 to watch David (then 2)while I ran to the<br/>
grocery.  She said in a nasty tone &quot;You had &#39;m, you<br/>
take care of &#39;m.&quot; Surprised me, I hadn&#39;t entrusted her<br/>
with his care before, and it was only to be about and<br/>
hour, but I said &quot;Good point, Nancy.  I will.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I did. Do. Have. Never asked her again.  She never<br/>
offered.  But. She has been (is) an outstanding, good<br/>
mother to her own children.  I hope I was an influence<br/>
her.  She says I was.  Am.  She is 42 now, has thee<br/>
kiddos. 21, 19, and 15 (one of my Godsons).  She&#39;s the<br/>
one of whom I took custody.  She is the one I quoted<br/>
as saying, of our dress wearing nephew, &quot;Well, if he<br/>
can pretend to be a kitty or a dog or a monkey (or<br/>
whatever they were), why can&#39;t he pretend to be a<br/>
girl?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyway the point is: Only people who want to care for<br/>
children should be allowed to do so.  Including<br/>
biological family members or other legally acceptable<br/>
caretakers. Hopefully the children will follow the<br/>
example of the loving responsible custodian rather<br/>
than the immature, negligent, whoevers.<br/>

My mom said something along those lines when Kirby was one and she was...  <br/>
something over fifty, and living with us for free.<br/>
<br/>
After I had had custody of her late-life &quot;oops!&quot; for two different stints <br/>
(four+ and 13+?)  <br/>

But it was okay.  She was just too, too nervous and was such a bad mom to my <br/>
brother that it was kind of a relief.  She was a baby-spanker.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m sure all kids are hurt to some degree, but I also<br/>
think the key thing here is weighing up which is going<br/>
to hurt the child more in the long run, divorce or<br/>
staying together (for the sake of the child).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Even if the parent is awful, the message that<br/>
comes to the children is that the mom or dad would<br/>
rather abandon their children than just do better to<br/>
be there.  And that&#39;s pretty much true.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And I suppose that&#39;s where &#39;good&#39; parenting comes in.<br/>
If both parents are doing a &#39;good&#39; job of parenting,<br/>
then the child will always feel loved and cared for on<br/>
both sides regardless of whether the parents live<br/>
under the same roof.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;One parent runs the other off because the parents<br/>
don&#39;t get along, instead of them doing their utmost to<br/>
be good people for the sake of their children.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Every situation is different. I believe that the<br/>
person who leaves is not necessarily always &quot;run off&quot;.<br/>
I think there are many different circumstances in a<br/>
divorce situation and one cannot judge all divorces by<br/>
the one(s) they may have been involved in.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;And these same people are often punishing kids for<br/>
not &quot;being good&quot; (&quot;good&quot; being defined by whatever the<br/>

<br/>
This sounds like you&#39;re talking about your personal<br/>
experience of divorce and I&#39;m sorry it was such a<br/>
painful experience for you.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, my parents divorce was not particularly<br/>
painful for me. The events leading up to it could be,<br/>
on occasion. My father was very moody and it lightened<br/>
up the whole atmosphere of my home life when he moved<br/>
out. Also, *he* became a little better at parenting<br/>
because he had to actually be involved with me (on the<br/>
weekends). <br/>
I probably won&#39;t know what Tamzin&#39;s true experience<br/>
regarding the divorce of her dad and I until she is<br/>
older and more able to analyze her feelings about it.<br/>
I know for now that she weathered it extremely well<br/>
(that&#39;s not to say that she didn&#39;t feel upset and<br/>
angry at times) and seems to be a happy and well<br/>
adjusted child. I know for certain that both of her<br/>
parents are no longer depressed and unhappy and<br/>
actually have a decent, caring friendship now (and<br/>
that&#39;s got to be a good thing for her in the long<br/>
run).<br/>

&lt;&lt; This sounds like you&#39;re talking about your personal<br/>
experience of divorce and I&#39;m sorry it was such a<br/>
painful experience for you. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My personal experience of the divorces I&#39;ve seen in my life, of my friends&#39; <br/>
parents when I was little, of my relatives, of adult friends I&#39;ve known, and <br/>
almost every one involved someone unwilling to stop drinking, unwilling to <br/>
get counselling, being dishonest, or something bad and selfish and immature.  <br/>
One of the most honest and straightforward divorces I know involved no <br/>
children, and the husband&#39;s discovery he was gay.   Another which was <br/>
understandable (but bad for the four kids) involved the husband becoming <br/>
increasingly frustrated and destructive of stuff and scaring the mom.   <br/>
<br/>
I divorced my first husband because I had other interests and he was drinking <br/>
too much and I was falling in love with Keith my #2 husband (who wasn&#39;t a <br/>
husband for another six years).  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just my parents&#39; marriage.  It&#39;s half the people I grew up with, <br/>
nearly every uncle and aunt on both sides (two of my mom&#39;s oldest brothers <br/>
married once and for life), five La Leche League leaders who were all married <br/>
when my kids were young and all are divorced now.  One couple moved away and <br/>
is not divorced--he&#39;s a minister, they&#39;re about to have twins making nine <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;m suffering from an insufficiently large set of data.<br/>

&gt; two different stints <br/>
&gt; (four+ and 13+?)  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But it was okay.  She was just too, too nervous and<br/>
&gt; was such a bad mom to my <br/>
&gt; brother that it was kind of a relief.  She was a<br/>
&gt; baby-spanker.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mother, too.  She lived with us off and on (months,<br/>
years).  I couldn&#39;t leave a sleeping baby in the house<br/>
and hang up laundry.  I couldn&#39;t trust her at all. Who<br/>
knew WHAT she might do? So I never asked anyone to<br/>
&quot;babysit&quot; until the time I tested Nancy. The<br/>
repercussions would have been just too (uhmmm) much. <br/>
It was physically very difficult for a long time to<br/>
keep up with everything and monitor (every second) my<br/>
babies (mostly I just held them) and mother and Nancy.<br/>
I was young and strong then. Sleep optional. XDH<br/>
indulged his social life during this time.  HE got<br/>
lots of sympathy for the MIL from Hell. He told lots<br/>
of MIL jokes.<br/>
<br/>
Your post sure brings it all back! Oh yes, before she<br/>
finally shot herself she had 5 husbands and 5<br/>
divorces. 3 of them after I left her home, but all 5<br/>
before I gained legal custody of Nancy when she was<br/>
11. Sometimes mother was really pitiful...like a<br/>
golem.<br/>
<br/>
Nancy has 1 husband of 22 years.  I was married to XDH<br/>
for just shy of 20 yrs. 2yrs unmarried. 10 yrs and<br/>
going...DH.<br/>

eeek!<br/>
<br/>
yes.<br/>
<br/>
They say people will drink themselves to death.  They say cigarette smoking <br/>
will kill you.  My mom consumes both still and regularly and is 70.   There&#39;s <br/>
nothing to talk about with her anymore.  She&#39;s so brain damaged she can&#39;t <br/>
remember things right and can&#39;t tell what happened the day before with any <br/>
reliability or clarity.  And the stories are usually about going to a casino <br/>
and seeing someone she knew, anyway.  And I&#39;m ashamed when it&#39;s someone I <br/>
know too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad to feel that way about your own mom.   I have some really good <br/>
memories from childhood, and one time I wrote her a long mother&#39;s day card <br/>
with about fifty of them all lined out, after Kirby was born.  I was hoping <br/>
it would make her be a better mom to my brother.  Maybe it did.  For me, it <br/>
was like a big thank you and goodbye letter, because having held up the best <br/>
of our relationship for me and her to remember, I quit expecting any more <br/>
good things to come of it.  <br/>
<br/>
I kept a copy, and it helped make me mindful that I&#39;m building a store of <br/>
good memories for my kids, and it&#39;s good not to cancel them back out.<br/>
<br/>
We never fight or insult each other.  I just do what she needs and get gone <br/>
politely. <br/>

It seems that you have been exposed to a large number<br/>
of &#39;nasty&#39; divorces. <br/>
I can also cite a good many divorces that ended up<br/>
being the best thing for everyone involved (where all<br/>
concerned were much happier after the divorce). <br/>
I can also tell you of one particular situation where<br/>
the parents have stayed together (mainly for financial<br/>
reasons and for the kids) and their kids are some of<br/>
the most disturbed, unhappy kids I know. <br/>
I also think in many cases it takes two. In other<br/>
words, maybe it&#39;s not as simple as all one person&#39;s<br/>
fault in many circumstances (I certainly own my fair<br/>
share of blame in the break up of my marriage,<br/>
although to many it looks like it was all his fault).<br/>
I think very few people in marriage breakups are<br/>
&#39;complete&#39; victims.<br/>
However, my point was that there are many different<br/>
divorce situations. I don&#39;t think we can assume that<br/>
divorce is bad in every single case or that staying<br/>
together no matter what is always the best option. At<br/>
the end of the day, I don&#39;t think there can be one<br/>
single final answer to all cases of divorce. Each case<br/>
is different.<br/>

&lt;&lt; At<br/>

single final answer to all cases of divorce. Each case<br/>
is different. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I ever said anything like there was one single final answer.<br/>
<br/>
Just because there&#39;s not a single answer to all doesn&#39;t mean that more <br/>
children are harmed than many adults like to think though.<br/>
<br/>
A three-legged dog negates &quot;all dogs have four legs,&quot; but it does NOT negate <br/>
&quot;Except in unusual circumstances, dogs have four legs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m up to having seen four three-legged dogs, one I knew personally.  So I <br/>
have a number of samples of three-legged dogs to draw upon and one with a <br/>
front leg turned backwards (from birth injury, maybe?).   The number of four <br/>
legged dogs I&#39;ve seen is beyond counting.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, I think almost all children are harmed to some<br/>
extent by a divorce. I guess it&#39;s just which situation<br/>
is going to harm the child more, divorce or other<br/>
(every other situation that could be harmful to the<br/>
emotional or physical wellbeing of a child).<br/>
