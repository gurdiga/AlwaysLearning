<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047952300">Notes and link below, but for now, the starry-starred quotes are  <br/>
someone not appearing in this film (as it were),  and the REAL star  <br/>
quotes are Joyce Fetteroll:<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
** I find that I feel most comfortable when I follow my heart and my  <br/>
own intentions with my kids. **<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s such a pretty sounding sentiment but some people&#39;s hearts lead  <br/>
them to spank the devil out of their children.<br/>
<br/>
Some people&#39;s hearts lead them to forcefully prevent non-organic food  <br/>
to pass their children&#39;s lips or non-natural fibers to touch their  <br/>
bodies.<br/>
<br/>
My heart would have said Calvert curriculum is the bee&#39;s knees! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of hearts get warped by life. Lots of hearts want to relive  <br/>
childhood through their children. Not all hearts sing true.<br/>
<br/>
** I think there is a difference between saying, &quot;here&#39;s what worked  <br/>
for me when I was navigating my way through it&quot;, and someone/anyone  <br/>
who insists they know the way everyone should approach their kids/ <br/>
life. **<br/>
<br/>
While I suspect the first feels more drawing and the second more off- <br/>
putting, feelings don&#39;t always know best. Lots of people feel  <br/>
frightened at the thought of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent has found something that works for their family without  <br/>
understanding why it worked and now much personality played in it,  <br/>
then for others it&#39;s little better than rolling dice and picking some  <br/>
technique at random.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, those who are living examined lives. thinking  <br/>
about and discussing why something works in the context of growing  <br/>
relationships, that&#39;s way better than dice! And no one should swallow  <br/>
what&#39;s said uncritically. They should take it in, turn it over, ask  <br/>
questions and examine it for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Critical examination is better for reaching clear goals than pretty  <br/>
sentiments of &quot;following the heart&quot; and &quot;mom knows best.&quot;<br/>
===================================<br/>
<br/>
It was about TV, originally, so if anyone here wants to read more  <br/>
about TV, and a little wrastle in the dust, and a save, and some  <br/>
wisdom by M Lewis and others...  here y&#39;go:<br/>
