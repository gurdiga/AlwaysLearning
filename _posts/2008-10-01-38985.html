<div id="ygrps-yiv-121399281">An interesting label I don&#39;t want to use much, but it might be useful  <br/>
for people dealing with interviewers.<br/>

<br/>
What often happens with interviews is that someone interviews  <br/>
unschoolers at length, writes a sensible article, and then garnishes  <br/>
it with two clueless comments from &quot;experts&quot; who know nothing about  <br/>
unschooling except that it&#39;s not the school system on which their  <br/>
mortgage and car payments depend.<br/>
<br/>
They are unschooling analphabets.<br/>
<br/>
MEANING:<br/>
noun: An illiterate; one who doesn&#39;t know the alphabet or the basics  <br/>
of something.<br/>
<br/>
ETYMOLOGY:<br/>
 From Greek analphabetos (not knowing the alphabet), from an- (not) +  <br/>
alphabetos (alphabet), from alpha + beta.<br/>
<br/>
USAGE:<br/>
&quot;For an auto-analphabet like me, this was big news indeed. Armed with  <br/>
these magical tires, I&#39;d never have to lug around a spare.&quot;<br/>
Amy Gamerman; Tires -- No Pressure; The Wall Street Journal (New  <br/>
York); May 29, 1998.<br/>
