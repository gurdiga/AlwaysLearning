<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143749635">I&#39;m SSSOOO excited!  I was just up at my parents house talking about <br/>
unschooling, unfooding, etc and I told them that I would like to go to <br/>
the conference.  My sister said she wants to come too, but I shouldn&#39;t <br/>
try to get HER to unschool her kids because she&#39;s just the kind of <br/>
person who needs &quot;structure&quot; in her life...which is a joke because her <br/>
life is a mess.  And my parents asked to learn more.  I&#39;m going to give <br/>
them the web address so they can read about the topics to be spoken on. <br/>
 I really hope they&#39;ll all come.  Unfortunately, dh can&#39;t because <br/>
they&#39;ll just be starting the harvest. But I&#39;ve been talking to him about <br/>
all changes I&#39;ll be implementing in our lifes and he is okay with it and <br/>
trusts me to make the right decisions for our children.<br/>
<br/>
One thing though,  I&#39;m embarrassed for being so hot-headed to Sandra and <br/>
to AnneO here and at unschooling.com.  So if I don&#39;t come up to say <br/>
&quot;Hi.&quot;  it&#39;s because of that.    HeidiC.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;I want to respond to this issue also, I hope this message comes through OK,  on another list I&#39;m on,  I havn&#39;t been able to get the enter button to put breaks in between the paragraphs.   We&#39;ll see....  In regards to my mom,      she doesn&#39;t bring up the schooling much.   She says she trusts me.    But when she does, she tends to take things I say as a personal attack on her own parenting skills.   I try and say,  I know you did what you thought was best,  but that doesn&#39;t always help.  I also have to be zenlike.   I take lots of breathes and calm myself.     This week I was over there,  at her house,  and she thought the kids needed more &#39;guidance&#39;.  In other words,  needing me to tell them what to do. I said they were doing quite well in finding lots to do and finding new things that they hadn&#39;t done before.    They also are so happy and self assured.   They get to do what they want!          She also can&#39;t get over the unregulated TV/ gaming stuff.    I brought up,  &quot;I sure am glad Steven Spielberg&#39;s mom didn&#39;t limit his use of a video camera! &quot; Or &quot; I&#39;m glad Bill Gate&#39;s mom didin&#39;t say to him,  honey, you&#39;ve been on the computer too much!&quot;.   She thinks my son has become more reclusive,  like he doesn&#39;t talk to people as much anymore. Well,   when she was last at our house he had just gotten a gameboy advance from a friend.   Hmmmmm,  I wonder why he didn&#39;t talk much.   Plus she doesn&#39;t talk to him about anything he&#39;s interested in.   I also said maybe he doesn&#39;t have anything to say.   Maybe he isn&#39;t going to be a talkative person,  isn&#39;t that OK? That&#39;s a  huge point,   if my kids don&#39;t talk with adults about what  the adults  think is &#39;interesting&#39; or of &#39;importance&#39;,   well,  then they aren&#39;t learning anything!      Sigh...    And of course,  video games can&#39;t be of importance.  I told my Mom if she would ask him about what he was doing she wouldn&#39;t be able to get a word in edge wise,  but she doesn&#39;t do that. I think she would rather he sat down and showed her how nice his handwriting is...how to multiply..and etc...bleck..that would impress her.    Different priorities,  I&#39;d say.  I just stay confident in my decision to unschool.   And show the doubters how wonderful it all is!!   Kelli <br/>

&quot;Hi.&quot;  it&#39;s because of that.    HeidiC. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so used to it, it doesn&#39;t bother me.<br/>
<br/>
AND (disappointing to some people, but I doubt you&#39;ll be one of them!) I <br/>
don&#39;t even usually remember who writes what here or at unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
When I say I&#39;m reading for ideas and not responding to individuals, I really <br/>
mean it.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of times I&#39;ve written a response and hit &quot;post&quot; and THEN seen who <br/>
wrote the original and thought, &quot;OH no, not her again; she&#39;ll definitely <br/>
think it&#39;s personal now.&quot;  (Not thinking of you, though I&#39;m not sure it <br/>
hasn&#39;t happened, either.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always HOPING that hot-heads will calm down, and I&#39;m usually confident <br/>
that those who come in twisting and resisting and say &quot;NO! it burns, it <br/>
scares me, STOP!&quot; will eventually take the new idea, look at their children <br/>
through them and say &quot;Oh!  It&#39;s all cooled off now and I can handle it fine!&quot;<br/>
