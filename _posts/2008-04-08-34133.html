Thankyou for that.I will keep it till she is a bit older and maybe take our 8 yr old and her friend.They seem ok to handle most things.<br/>
<br/>
I know what you mean about some kids watching more scarey things than others.Our 8 yr old was watching harry 3 at the cinemas when she was 4 1/2 ans didnt worry about it..she has always been good with real vs fantasy.She recently saw the movie Bella which was PG here.I thought it would be better than a M movie but in the end I think it would have been better to see the movie for the older audience than to tackle the issues Bella brought up....it wasnt a kids movie but the reviewer said suitable for everyone.This is why i asked about info on Nimhs Island from those with children who have seen it!<br/>
