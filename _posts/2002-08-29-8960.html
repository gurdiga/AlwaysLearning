<div id="ygrps-yiv-565832977">Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to resend this post to let you know that there is still <br/>
opportunity to come and hear Aletha speak. There are two workshops on <br/>
September 14 and 15, 2002 from 9 am to 4 pm.<br/>
<br/>
The first workshop is called &quot;Discipline Without Punishments or <br/>
Rewards&quot; The description is as follows:<br/>
	Learn how to raise cooperative, responsible, and self-disciplined <br/>
children without being either a dictator or a doormat. We will discuss <br/>
the pitfalls of punishments and rewards, and review the basic <br/>
techniques of democratic discipline with mutual respect between adults <br/>
and children. Discover the three reasons for inappropriate behavior, <br/>
and learn how to change children&#39;s behavior by recognizing and meeting <br/>
their needs. <br/>
<br/>
	This workshop is useful for parents, teachers, daycare providers, <br/>
nurses, social workers, therapists, and anybody else involved with <br/>
babies or children from newborn to pre-adolescents.<br/>
<br/>
The second workshop is called &quot;How to Help Children Heal from Stress <br/>
and Trauma&quot; The description is as follows:<br/>
	When children are frequently angry, violent, hyperactive, or <br/>
obnoxious, they may be suffering from the effects of stress or trauma. <br/>
More subtle symptoms may include fears, sleep problems, attachment <br/>
disorders, or physical illnesses. We will provide an overview of the <br/>
major sources and symptoms of stress and trauma during infancy and <br/>
childhood, and discuss the conditions required for children to restore <br/>
emotional health. The focus of this workshop is on recognizing and <br/>
facilitating children&#39;s spontaneous healing mechanisms, specifically <br/>
crying, raging, play, and laughter, thereby creating a healthy <br/>
functioning child as he/she grows to maturity.<br/>
<br/>
	This workshop is useful for parents, teachers, daycare providers, <br/>
nurses, social workers, therapists, and anybody else involved with <br/>
babies or children from newborn to pre-adolescents.<br/>
<br/>
The fees for the workshops are $90 each but there is a sliding scale <br/>
for anyone who has a financial need. We are more interested in having <br/>
people come and don&#39;t want to turn anyone away for lack of funds. You <br/>
can call me for more info at 301-947-1760 or browse our website at: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mindFULLness.org/workshops.html">http://www.mindFULLness.org/workshops.html</a> for more info. The workshops <br/>
will be held at The Cottage in Gaithersburg, MD.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time and your interest. I hope you can come!</div>
