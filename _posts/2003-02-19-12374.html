<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388712956">My grandma (the only one I ever really knew is Nana.  Her husband who I <br/>
never really met though he met me when I was little was Papa.  When my neice <br/>
was born My mother insisted on being called Grammi and it stuck just fine.  <br/>
She decided to have grandkids call my dad Papa but he&#39;s never really liked <br/>
it.  So he&#39;s been pretty much whatever you wanted to call him.  Some 14 <br/>
years later a different neice came along and started saying Grammi and <br/>
Grampy which has evolved into Grammi and Grumpy which is painfully fitting <br/>
and which he actually really likes.  LOL  My husbands father is Grampa Phil.<br/>
<br/>
I think I want to be a Nana like my Nana.  By I also like the korean word <br/>
for grandma (DH is Korean) Which ends up sounding like Harmony with a slight <br/>
L sound on the R. (kinda like Ha-lra-mo-nee)<br/>
<br/>
Also when my first neice started talking she had a close relationship with <br/>
my sister Alicia.  She would call her Annalicia (Aunt Alicia all strung <br/>
together).  So when she first said my name she called me Annakatie.  It was <br/>
cute and fun for many years.<br/>
