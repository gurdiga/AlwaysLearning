<div id="ygrps-yiv-75028062">My dd10 has had the same best friend since she was little. They live here in the neighborhood and spend most every afternoon together. Overtime both the girls have become more and more hurtful (words) towards each other. I never realized how much of an affect this friendship had on all of us in the family until the friend moved away for six months earlier this year to live with the non-custodial parent. During those six months I watched my daughter absolutely bloom and a lot of her temper and crying jags disappeared. But, then after Christmas the girl came back and suddenly my daughter was referring to herself as stupid again, putting down her younger sisters, and just generally taking out her frustrations with the rest of us in the house. <br/>
<br/>
Dd10 and I have had talks about friendships and what type of people we would like to be friends with. We&#39;ve talked about how her frustrations/anger at some of the things are understandable, but needing to find new ways to deal with them. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also tried to talk to her about finding other people to be friends with, some of the people she hung out with during the six months earlier who she blew off when the friend moved back (because the friend told her to). But, she says she can&#39;t because they have been friends for so long. I don&#39;t understand this because in most social situations she is well-liked and confident. <br/>
<br/>
Should I put my foot down about playing with this friend (even though it totally goes against my grain)? The whole situation is upsetting not just to my daughter, but to the whole family. Are there any better conversations I can try with my daughter?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
I agree. Maybe the girls spending less time together will help find a good balance for your daughter and the entire family. <br/>
<br/>
I do think there are occasionally times when we need to step in. With my own kids, sometimes a well-timed interruption gets them to ask for help in solving a problem. Or, it can subtly redirect them to something more positive.<br/>

I&#39;ve also explained that we just don&#39;t put other people down or be mean for the sake of being mean. My dd is generally the reactor not the instigator in these situations. But, they are 10 and I have not made them play right there in my presence for a couple of years...so sometimes I get information after the fact.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I thought that dd was helping this girl in anyway I probably wouldn&#39;t feel this way. After playing with this particular friend my daughter is so much more reactive and sensitive to us in the house. It is like after playing with the friend, dd wants to start a fight with someone here in the house just to get out her frustration. Also, her self-esteem dies when she is around the friend too much, especially as the friend likes to point out dd&#39;s phonetic spelling and laugh about it. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been trying to figure that out. Most afternoons we are home because ds3 still takes a nap. It is hard to keep her home when all the kids in the neighborhood are home from school and out playing. We generally have activities most evenings, but there is a 2-hour window between school letting out and us going out. And, of course as of today it is summer. I can put my foot down and insist she stays home, but I&#39;m trying to overcome my controlling tendencies ;-). Playing with friends is extremely important to dd - given a choice she will always choose to play or hang out with someone else (I&#39;m really trying hard to be okay with that). <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those aren&#39;t the only two choices, though.<br/>
<br/>
Could you, on occasion, take both kids out in the car, prior to your  <br/>
son&#39;s nap? He can fall asleep in the car. Or carry him to the car  <br/>
while he&#39;s sleeping. You guys can go for an interesting drive  <br/>
somewhere.  Maybe pick up ice cream cones at a drive-in, or get some  <br/>
dinner before the evening activities (these are all things your  <br/>
daughter wants to do, right? and the 3 year-old is going, too, also?).<br/>
<br/>
Napping toddlers are often portable, too, in a stroller or a wagon  <br/>
with pillows and blankets. Can you go for a walk to a playground?  <br/>
Maybe your daughter will meet some different kids.<br/>
<br/>
Creativity in the face of such difficult situations is what can make  <br/>
unschooling flow.  It can be easy to get into an insidious &quot;either or&quot;  <br/>
scenario (either she plays with said friend or you &quot;put your foot  <br/>
down&quot;), but resist it. Try to make other possibilities more appealing.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve said &quot;put my foot down&quot; twice in two posts. Do you put your  <br/>
foot down on other things? Is that what you mean about controlling  <br/>
tendencies? You might want to think about that seriously. Being  <br/>
controlling isn&#39;t very good for unschooling. I know, because I&#39;ve had  <br/>
to repeatedly let go of those tendencies myself.<br/>
<br/>
You can see the results of control on your daughter, as it sounds like  <br/>
her friend is pretty controlling. By coming up with alternatives for  <br/>
your daughter that are fun and connect the two of you (or three of you  <br/>
or more), she&#39;ll eventually see how much happier her life can be.<br/>

I also see how this friendship affects not only her, but the two middle girls (7 & 5) and myself through dd10&#39;s grumpiness over being hurt.<br/>
<br/>
The incident at the beginning of the week made me want to just react in that way though. I didn&#39;t/haven&#39;t. I&#39;m just personally really, really tired of the drama.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>What does &quot;wants to read better&quot; mean to him?  Read faster? more?  <br/>
novels? read out loud without sounding choppy?<br/>
<br/>
My guess is that if he&#39;s functioning well in his WoW (World of  <br/>
Warcraft) guild he&#39;s reading well.<br/>
<br/>
WoW is a great place to read, especially with an active RP (role- <br/>
playing) guild.  One of my kids learned to read mainly from WoW.  I  <br/>
sat by him or would go to him *every* time he needed help reading a  <br/>
quest.  As the months went by he didn&#39;t call on me as often, and then  <br/>
none at all.  I&#39;m guessing here, but I think this process was about  <br/>
12 months, give or take.<br/>
<br/>
Not knowing exactly what your son means, I&#39;ll take a stab in the dark  <br/>
with some suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
-Start a character with him and role play with him using in-game chat.<br/>
<br/>
-See if he wants to complete this achievement on one of his  <br/>
character, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=1244">http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=1244</a>  They are all the  <br/>
books around in various places around the game, short reads, and you  <br/>
get to know the lore.  The achievement is called Well Read. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
- Almost complete list of in-game WoW books <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ptr.wowhead.com/">http://ptr.wowhead.com/</a> <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772864532">Everything Jill said.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s reading took off from playing computer games like Zoo  <br/>
Tycoon and Impossible Creatures. Like WoW, in order to get to the next  <br/>
level, you need to read instructions to understand what you&#39;re  <br/>
supposed to do. Maybe find some games like that to supplement his WoW  <br/>
playing. He can play Warcraft -  it doesn&#39;t have MMORPG reading  <br/>
immediacy and he gets the lore and understanding to boost his WoW  <br/>
playing!<br/>
<br/>
Since he&#39;s clearly computer-savvy, those kinds of reading challenges  <br/>
may appeal to him a lot more than books. Books don&#39;t have the same  <br/>
kinds of goal achievement!<br/>

If you say &quot;putting my foot down&quot; about anything, it&#39;s not a phrase  <br/>
you created for the situation.  It&#39;s an idiom used without clear and  <br/>
conscious thought.   It belies &quot;I am really not controlling or  <br/>
limiting...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Any time you can&#39;t rephrase something in your own words, it&#39;s probably  <br/>
not a good thing to say.<br/>
