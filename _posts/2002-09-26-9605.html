<div id="ygrps-yiv-849932262">A woman on one our New Zealand e-mail groups has just found this website<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.hometaught.com/what_is_homeschooling.htm">http://www.hometaught.com/what_is_homeschooling.htm</a> and as a parent of young<br/>
children just starting out in making her choice  it has caused her some<br/>
insecurity.<br/>
<br/>
I felt pretty insulted by the content especially the &quot;close but not really&quot;<br/>
page where she seems to allege unschoolers neglect their children<br/>
educationally.  I am sure someone here can verbalise my misgivings more<br/>
clearly.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I would just ignore the webpage as being published by someone<br/>
with an agenda and a business but I would like to put some useful<br/>
reassurance the way of the person who originally stumbled on the site.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I seems to me no-one has a right to judge/or define others choices but I was<br/>
just wondering what reaction is here?<br/>
