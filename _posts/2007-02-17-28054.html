<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866477630">Sorry, I was corrected by my runescape advisor. Choose an age 13 and over.  Choose a username, check availability. When accepted scroll to the very bottom of the page.  Create password and check box that states you agree with privacy policy.  Create account.  If one thing is unchecked or missed you will be unable to create an account.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2068087222">Thanks everyone for the horsey games and runescape info.  I had to  <br/>
log on using a different browser.  That worked and tonight we tried  <br/>
it.  WOW!!!  I love it!!!!... oh and so do my dreamlets LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I see many blissful hours cuddling on the couch with my kids.....  <br/>
ahhhhhhhh.... this is heaven on earth!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-834986821">DH has been playing Enchanted Lands for the last couple weeks.  He&#39;s<br/>
building up his character and has been approached by several people to<br/>
join their guilds, but I&#39;m sensing some hesitation! So I thought maybe<br/>
if anyone else was out there from the Unschooling world playing it he<br/>
might have fun &quot;hanging around&quot; them!<br/>
<br/>
He tried Runescape when I told him I was seeing so many messages about<br/>
it, but said he likes this better.  He&#39;s always been a &quot;paper and<br/>
dice&quot; kind of guy, this is still new for him :)<br/>
<br/>
(Yes, I&#39;m talking about my husband, :P not our child.  Though she<br/>
helps him play a lot - &quot;Hey it&#39;s raining! You need a tent and your<br/>
fire went out!  Watch out for that beaver!!!&quot;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017358801">Oh wow... that sounds interesting too.... if I can&#39;t get another  <br/>
account with runescape maybe I&#39;ll get my other DD on Enchanted Lands....<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea how these games all work.  We got our first taste last  <br/>
night and now my girls are dying to get back on the computer.  My  <br/>
throat got tired and my eyes dried out reading the directions to them  <br/>
for so many hours!  But it was so much fun.  I&#39;ll go check it out and  <br/>
if your DH doesn&#39;t mind a newbie-newbie hanging around him, then I&#39;m in!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129690257">Sorry about that, it&#39;s called Eternal Lands, not Enchanted Lands!<br/>
here&#39;s a good page about it: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_lands">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_lands</a><br/>
It has all the links for the different operating systems, and an<br/>
overview.  <br/>
