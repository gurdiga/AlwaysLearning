<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849418415">This comes around a couple of times a year, but I&#39;m bringing something  <br/>
Meredith has written elsewhere.  First there&#39;s a little bit of  <br/>
background, and then her entire post.<br/>
<br/>
A mom asked for advice about teens, and several unschoolers offered  <br/>
their experiences and advice.<br/>
=============<br/>
<br/>
To &quot;defend&quot; the mom from the answers to her questions, someone wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I can tell already you have a sweet, tender, sensitive heart [name of  <br/>
original poster]! May the LORD bless you abundantly and grant you much  <br/>
wisdom as you live and learn joyfully with your wonderful children  <br/>
that HE has BLESSED you with. I can tell you are an amazing Mom!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
The original poster wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I cannot tell you how much your words meant to me...*sniff*...thank  <br/>
you&quot;<br/>
<br/>
------------------<br/>
I wrote (following other actual information about the question):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you prefer people saying they can tell you&#39;re an amazing mother to  <br/>
having people help you discover what you might do differently, there&#39;s  <br/>
a collection of those messages here:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/support">http://sandradodd.com/support</a> &quot;<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
the response was:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m a little offend on the last line from you. I don&#39;t prefer to only  <br/>
hear I&#39;m great, compared to ways I can parent differently.... But  <br/>
someone telling me that they can tell I&#39;m a good mom, that is support  <br/>
and encouraging.&quot;<br/>

Its not based in anything, though. Its polite social &quot;noise&quot;. There&#39;s  <br/>
no way at all for someone who &quot;knows&quot; you only through a handful of  <br/>
posts online to have any idea what kind of parent you are. While it  <br/>
might feel good, its empty, like a random compliment about the color  <br/>
of your car.<br/>
<br/>
The point isn&#39;t that you should feel bad about yourself as a parent,  <br/>
but that its good to question ideas about parenting - good in that  <br/>
there&#39;s a whoooooole lot of pure &quot;noise&quot; where parenting is concerned,  <br/>
things that everyone knows only becauses everyone says them. &quot;Children  <br/>
need rules&quot; is one example, and &quot;you need to be a parent not a friend&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;the most important thing is love&quot;. Most parenting discussions  <br/>
consist of nothing but those sort of empty &quot;truisms&quot; repeated back and  <br/>
forth mindlessly, with much nodding and affirmation so that everyone  <br/>
feels like she&#39;s part of the conversation - but parenting remains  <br/>
essentially the same and we&#39;re all good mommies if our kids survive  <br/>
the experience and if they don&#39;t we did our best, right? We all have  <br/>
to do what works for us, right? (irony)<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling starts at a different place than other kinds of parenting,  <br/>
though, and to understand that it&#39;s important to question everything  <br/>
you think you know about parenting, including the idea of being &quot;a  <br/>
good parent&quot;. Step away from &quot;good mom&quot; and look at your individual  <br/>
children. What will, right this moment, allow their lives to be warmer  <br/>
and softer and more pleasant? A scolding won&#39;t. A lecture won&#39;t.  <br/>
Worrying over their future won&#39;t. The most wonderful - and startling -  <br/>
thing about unschooling is that you Get to be someone your kids feel  <br/>
good about. But you won&#39;t get there being a &quot;good mom&quot;. You&#39;re more  <br/>
likely to get there by being a good friend.<br/>

I like this. I too have a problem with tags which say &quot;good this and good<br/>
that&quot;. I am afraid when people say &quot;good mom. good wife, good daughter, good<br/>
friend, good husband, good parents, good son etc..&quot; I have experienced this<br/>
good thing far too long. I know when people praise you using &quot;good&quot; they do<br/>
so only because you are fitting into what is acceptable to their &quot;idea&quot; of<br/>
good.<br/>
<br/>
It is easy to fall into this trap, because it feeds the ego. I try now to<br/>
respond to needs and feelings that come from within me and my children.<br/>
Ideas of good and bad are relative and always in flux....and mostly come<br/>
loaded with a lot of selfish intentions.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851011072">Hmmm...I agree where you are coming from. Yes there is a difference between<br/>
good mom and bad mom. But would you agree if I said that many a times we are<br/>
blinded by our misconceptions of good and bad too.<br/>
<br/>
I have seen with many moms that in trying to be good wives they end up being<br/>
bad moms. My husband&#39;s father abused him and his brothers physically and<br/>
sexually he regularly beat up his wife. But she remained the good wife by<br/>
tolerating all this and not seeing the larger picture how this violent<br/>
childhood scarred the children for life.<br/>
<br/>
She says she remained in the marriage because if she left then the children<br/>
would have no dad to support them financially and that she has been a good<br/>
mom in doing so.<br/>
<br/>
Even now she regularly takes her husbands side and refuses to acknowledge<br/>
the pain that her sons have gone through and are still facing the demons of<br/>
it in their adult lives and the sad part is the sons also think she is a<br/>
good mom.<br/>
<br/>
You see our conditioning is such that we put people especially women who<br/>
silently suffer on the pedestal. This is the idea of good and bad that I was<br/>
referring to. This pedestal of goodness can be blinding and keep one far<br/>
away from the truth.<br/>

It doesn&#39;t matter whether I agree or not.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Each individual will either find her own balance or won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/balance">http://sandradodd.com/balance</a><br/>
<br/>
Rejecting the idea of good and bad is no better than letting someone  <br/>
else tell you what to do in every way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Even now she regularly takes her husbands side and refuses to  <br/>
acknowledge<br/>

<br/>
The alternative may have been more as she imagined, than as you are  <br/>
imagining in retrospect.  Divorce rarely makes things better.  He  <br/>
would still have been their dad, still been the way he was, and they  <br/>
might have ended up with a stepmother.  The mom would not be there for  <br/>
them go to.<br/>
<br/>

away from the truth.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can talk about &quot;our conditioning&quot; and be referring  <br/>
to everyone on this list.  It&#39;s better for us to talk about  <br/>
unschooling and unschooling families, whenever possible.  Things  <br/>
change, but they haven&#39;t changed so much that there is no difference  <br/>
between good and bad.<br/>
<br/>
If everything is as good as everything else, we could all put our kids  <br/>
in school.<br/>
