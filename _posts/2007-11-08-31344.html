<div id="ygrps-yiv-983520177">That is the question I&#39;ve been asking myself lately.  First let me <br/>
introduce myself...My name is Estella and I&#39;m new to the group.  My <br/>
husband Dan and I have 3 kids, Junior is 6-Hunter id 4 3/4 and Jalynn <br/>
just turned 1 yr old.  My boys have never been in school and I&#39;ve <br/>
been really working with Junior since last year and he has really <br/>
been struggling to learn his letter, sounds and so on.  My MIL is a K <br/>
school teacher and always feeding bad thoughts into my hubbys head <br/>
which causes problems and doubts in him.  I know that him being home <br/>
with me is the best thing for him and if he was a school and having <br/>
these issues he would be made to feel like he was stupid and couldn&#39;t <br/>
do the work.  Then of course he would be left behind and probably <br/>
made fun of too.<br/>
<br/>
Just recently I learned that my son is more of an auditory learner <br/>
which makes some since as to why what I&#39;ve been doing just isn&#39;t <br/>
working for him.  He has trouble paying attention and absolutely <br/>
HATES doing any kind of book work. Which brings me to my <br/>
question... &quot;Is unschooling for us?&quot;  I&#39;ve started in the last week <br/>
letting some thing go and give him for free reign on what he gets to <br/>
learn about and it does seem to be helping.  I&#39;ve found these great <br/>
Leap Frog DVDs that he loves and he is starting to spell thing from <br/>
learning their sounds off of this DVD which does make me feel good <br/>
but still there is the question of...How do you get to trusting that <br/>
your kids WILL learn naturally on their own?  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know all of you and look forward to many <br/>
successful homeschooling/unschooling years together!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

 </span></blockquote>What, right now, does he need to spell in the standard way for?<br/>
<br/>
Really, it&#39;s a serious question. Why does he need, right now, to spell?<br/>
<br/>
How will his life as a 7 or 8 or 9 year old be lacking if he isn&#39;t  <br/>
spelling in the standard way until he&#39;s 10? Or 12?<br/>
<br/>
In school 6 yos need to spell because schools need to demonstrate to  <br/>
the watch dogs (parents, administration, state) that kids are  <br/>
learning something. They need all the kids progressing at the same  <br/>
pace because they depend on a factory model to make mass education  <br/>
cheaper. They need all the kids learning the same thing at the same  <br/>
time because it&#39;s expensive to pull a child out for special  <br/>
instruction who gets off track.<br/>
<br/>
None of that is about what the child needs in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Learning that way is *very* difficult. It takes a huge amount of  <br/>
repetition to get the majority of kids to the level the schools need  <br/>
in order to keep the assembly line moving at the proper speed. So,  <br/>
they need to start early with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Real learning does not take anywhere near that long and happens  <br/>
fairly effortlessly. (It looks a lot like play and living life.) Kids  <br/>
who learn naturally learn to spell when they need to spell: writing  <br/>
emails and Facebook messages and letters and writing stories and  <br/>
video game walkthroughs and role playing, etc. The biggest, hugest  <br/>
boom to learning to spell is automatic spell checking. There are  <br/>
words that I&#39;ve misspelled for years that I&#39;m getting right more  <br/>
often than not because I get immediate feedback when I get it wrong.  <br/>
(And, importantly, it&#39;s immediate feedback while writing something  <br/>
that is meaningful for me to spell right!)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-32088051">Thanks so much Joyce!  I will look into the website for sure.  I&#39;ve been reading more and more about unschooling and finding that it fits more of my beliefs...<br/>
   <br/>
  Do you have recommendations on specific books I might be able to pick up on unschooling?  I really need to be educated so when my husband starts asking questions I know the answers.<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks for your help!<br/>

The  biggest, hugest <br/>
boom to learning to spell is automatic spell  checking.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not really &quot;automatic&quot;, but moms are good spell-checkers, too. When I  <br/>
needed to know how to spell something at home when I was a kid, I *always* got,  <br/>
&quot;Go look it up&quot;, &quot;That&#39;s what dictionaries are for&quot;, and &quot;Go ask the  <br/>
dictionary&quot;. I loved the dictionary and reading in my spare time and playing  games <br/>
with it with my dad, but when I was trying to accomplish something, being  told <br/>
to &quot;go look it up&quot; was frustrating and time-consuming. I think of this  every <br/>
time Wyl asks me how to spell something, and I patiently and slowly (so  that <br/>
he has time to write it out as I spell it out loud) spell for him what he  <br/>
needs. That&#39;s what I would have liked when I was a kid. I don&#39;t have *any* fears <br/>
 that he won&#39;t learn to spell these words himself eventually. I&#39;m *still*  <br/>
learning how to spell words correctly-and the last one that&#39;s very clear in my  <br/>
memory was &quot;definitely&quot;, and I learned to spell that right from chatting IM <br/>
with  an online friend. :~) Even if I learned more correct spellings from <br/>
&quot;looking it  up&quot;, the ones that are memorable come from daily, happy interactions.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
De<br/>

<br/>
Didn&#39;t John Holt say something like all anybody needs to learn to <br/>
read and write is someone who will answer the two questions, &quot;What <br/>
does this say?&quot;  and &quot;How do you write that?&quot;  I remember he had some <br/>
concept of people who would be available in libraries or such with <br/>
buttons that say, &quot;Ask me.&quot; <br/>

In Albuquerque the main library had an answer desk.  It was great.   <br/>
Someone sitting in the reference section would look things up for  <br/>
you.  I bet they still have it, but the person uses google.<br/>
<br/>
There was also (and might still be) &quot;Ask a Nurse&quot; through  <br/>
Presbyterian hospital.  Same kind of deal, for medical questions.   <br/>
Now we use google for that too.  (They probably do too.)<br/>
