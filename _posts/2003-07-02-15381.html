<div id="ygrps-yiv-653474309">&quot;Turns out I can spit a cherry pit cleanly twelve feet to<br/>
the back of the head of a smart ass husband.  I&#39;m continually amazed by<br/>
my own talents. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
See Deb, you HAVE to come to the conference. You could do a cherry pit spitting workshop. :)<br/>
<br/>
THanks for sharing your weekend adventures, you&#39;re making me miss the mountains and all the hiking we used to do. sigh.<br/>

Perhaps, in general, though, a comparative trial of cherry pits vs. <br/>
watermelon seeds would be useful.  There&#39;s aerodynamics (cherry pits aren&#39;t) but then <br/>
there&#39;s mass.   Watermelon seeds can fly like the wind, but they have no <br/>
notable effect when they strike.<br/>
<br/>
Now avocado pits, a couple of spoons and a rubber band.... <br/>
(oh wait... that&#39;s not in the mouth-launched category)<br/>
