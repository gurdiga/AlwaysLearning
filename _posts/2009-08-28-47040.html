<br/>
Good for you, then!  There are sadder things.  Don&#39;t turn the news  <br/>
on.  I avoid it myself.  (I started to tell a story I heard last night  <br/>
before I found the remote, but I will spare the list.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-And, make no mistake, it is the way of the future. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I disagree.  The fact that many of us have children who didn&#39;t go to  <br/>
school and that number is increasing and reaching voting age, and the  <br/>
age to create policy, will keep that from being the inevitable pattern  <br/>
of future life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Her quote was beautiful &quot;I want to learn about the world and live  <br/>
freely.&quot; Why does that scare people so much?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Speaking as someone who has had a 13 year old girl, rape comes to mind  <br/>
immediately.  Facial disfigurement. Serious injury.  Death.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
think of those things much when I was 13.  When my daughter was 13 I  <br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
The family can (and might) move to another country where homeschooling  <br/>
is a viable option.  Maybe it&#39;s already legal in The Netherlands (I  <br/>
thought it was).  Maybe the parents didn&#39;t consider that.<br/>
<br/>
When I was first around homeschooling, three stories kept being told.   <br/>
One was a girl who was asked to be on an orchestra tour of Australia,  <br/>
I think it was, and her school wouldn&#39;t let her go.  The other was  <br/>
similar; I forget now but it was a wonderful opportunity for anyone of  <br/>
any age, and the school insisted school-on-schedule was more  <br/>
important, and the parents acquiesced.  The third was a girl in the NW  <br/>
U.S. who was in trouble for flying an ultralight plane (I think)?  Her  <br/>
parents got in trouble, somehow.  There are probably links to articles  <br/>
about that one.  She was homeschooled.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was Jessica Dubroff, here in California, 13 years ago. She was 7 <br/>
years old and she and her father and instructor all died in a plane <br/>
crash. She was attempting to be the youngest person to fly across the <br/>
US. Her father was in the back seat, a flying instructor was next to <br/>
Jessica in the plane. Jessica was flying. The weather was bad, but they <br/>
decided to go anyway because they had news media waiting, and she <br/>
crashed after takeoff. In interviews, her mother talked about allowing <br/>
her to &quot;follow her bliss,&quot; which was a popular expression at the time.<br/>
<br/>
It brought some very negative attention to homeschoolers for a while and <br/>
there was talk of legislation, but nothing came of it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand or agree with trying to set records of being the <br/>
youngest to do things. If a kid loves flying, support that love in ways <br/>
that are reasonable - in Jessica Dubroff&#39;s case, the father had made it <br/>
into a huge publicity thing - a 7 year old flying coast-to-coast. There <br/>
were many ways that her love of flying could have been supported other <br/>
than that kind of media pressure that led to them choosing to fly in bad <br/>
weather.<br/>
<br/>
Same thing with this 13 year old who wants to take 2 years to sail alone <br/>
around the world. If it is to set the record as the youngest to ever do <br/>
that, then I, personally, would not support it. I WOULD support my <br/>
child&#39;s love of sailing, of course, in a zillion other ways.<br/>
<br/>
Supporting our kids interests doesn&#39;t mean supporting every possible way <br/>
of pursuing that interest, no matter how large the risk is. We adults <br/>
are usually better able to assess risk and we shouldn&#39;t abandon that <br/>
ability and our responsibility to protect our children when they don&#39;t <br/>
have the ability to assess risk (I don&#39;t think a 7 year old can even <br/>
grasp the permanence of death, yet, much less make assessments about how <br/>
risky flying in bad weather might be, etc). Kids need parents to use <br/>
their good judgment and find ways to support the kids&#39; interests that <br/>
are within some reasonable bounds of safety.<br/>

But we don&#39;t know this girl, or her family.  We don&#39;t know what her sailing experience is, how many times she has soloed before, what sort of conditions she has sailed in.  We know little to nothing about her experiences, her maturity level, her judgment capability.  <br/>
<br/>
I sail.  I know what sorts of things can happen from being out there, hearing from and reading about others.  I do see a difference in what this girl wants to do (solo voyage) and a non-stop circumnavigation, but it still comes down to I cannot make a decision for a girl I know nothing about.  That is for her and her family to decide.<br/>

<br/>
But this is assuming that sailing is dangerous.  Granted, there are risks involved, but driving a car has risks as well.  A well maintained sailboat is sturdy and safe; awareness of weather windows and storm patterns reduces the risk of weather related issues (One long time cruising couple estimated they spent only about 1% of their sailing time dealing with bad weather); sailboats move slowly enough you can avoid most collisions quite easily if you are prepared to alter your course and not expect the other person to do so (seriously, there are rules of the road in sailing, but you should never expect the other person knows and follows them).  People with NO experience with sailing go cruising quite often, and are fine.  This girl has experience.  <br/>
<br/>

Sandra&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But then we start to get into drawing lines for where the government should have the authority to step in.  Stop them from traveling with the orchestra?  But trains and planes and buses crash, will there be enough chaperones, what if the kids sneak out and something happens?  Should girls be allowed to participate in gymnastics on an Olympic level?  We know the long term damage that this intense sport can cause to the body, she may catch her head wrong and be paralyzed or die, so let&#39;s say no.  <br/>
<br/>
If we look at any activity from the fear based side, we can almost always find a reason to say no.  But if the person is prepared, has experience, and wants to undertake the adventure, why say no?  Will you prevent or force your teen from learning to drive?  Or will you follow their lead and help them be prepared for the judgment and skills and maturity necessary to operate a car?<br/>
<br/>
I have been doing a little more reading about her.  I cannot find the original source of info yet (still looking) but on the Free Range website there is a discussion about this, and one comment says: &quot;Dekker has already done the shorter but still lengthy solo journeys people are suggesting here and thus, also, her ability to be alone for more than a day at a time has already been tested. She has spent seven weeks sailing the Atlantic alone previously. She is proposing this (yes, much lengthier, much more dangerous, not that solo sailing is ever safe) voyage on top of the experience that some commenters here are recommending for her, not instead of it.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So if she has the experience, the knowledge, the desire, why stop her?<br/>

<br/>
No, they do not know her either, that is why they are placing a two month block so a psychologist can examine her.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who is familiar with her and sailing says this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And what about Mike Perham  who just finished his global trek and sailed across the Atlantic Ocean alone at age 14  would he let Laura go?<br/>
<br/>
He told The Daily Telegraph:<br/>
<br/>
    If I was asked whether an average 13-year-old girl should sail around the world Id immediately say no. But Laura isnt average and thats what I feel has caused this little storm () What people will fail to see is that shes an accomplished sailor already and has a lot of sailing experience<br/>
<br/>
    How young is too young? Age is only a number. Its what makes the person that is important. &quot;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And having read a lot about this and her previous experience and what I know about sailing?  I would let her go on the voyage.  They have planned a safer route for her, she has port stops planned so she is not at sea longer than about 3 weeks.  She may be injured, she may die...or she may do just fine and have a wonderful time.  <br/>
<br/>
I cannot find the quote now, but when I was reading about this last night a government (I think it was the Netherlands) prevented a student from traveling with an orchestra through Europe because it would be disruptive to the person&#39;s schooling.  Seems to me their judgment is a little off on that one, so I do not have faith they can look at what is best for an individual.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;That depends on the laws and policies where they are resident or citizens.  There are things that are NOT for a girl and her family to decide, probably in every culture and jurisdiction on the planet.   Unschooling doesn&#39;t change that fact.<br/>

Sandra&quot;<br/>
<br/>
True, which is why she had to apply to miss school.  So she is planning now on renouncing her citizenship in favor of New Zealand (she has a NZ passport) to do this.  Again, in light of unschooling, we advocate that with knowledge and support and guidance our children are free to pursue what interests them.  If she has the knowledge and ability and experience, and guidance from other knowledgeable sailors, why are we, as unschoolers, saying it is a bad idea?<br/>

She made a 7 week solo voyage in the Atlantic at 11.  Her mother approves the trip.  Her father approves and is involved in planning the trip.  He is supporting her enough to risk having custody taken away if the court deems it so.  How much more do we need to for them to prove to the courts and the government that she can do this?  <br/>
<br/>
Adults with less knowledge and experience than Dekker go cruising.  Do we say merely because of age and lifetime experience, but lacking specific sailing experience, they are okay and she is not?  Who is more at risk- the one who knows what they are doing, or the one who doesn&#39;t?<br/>

�How young is too young? Age is only a number. It�s what makes the  <br/>
person that is important.� &quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t see this quote before.  I can&#39;t tell from your post what  <br/>
words are whose.  Some quote marks don&#39;t pass through yahoogroups.  I  <br/>
use -=-this for quotes-=- but some people use **stars** or something.   <br/>
It needs to be black and physical, though, please.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And having read a lot about this and her previous experience and  <br/>
what I know about sailing? I would let her go on the voyage. -=-<br/>
Right!  IF you were one of those officials, you would have known more  <br/>
about it and maybe recommended a different judgment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Seems to me their judgment is a little off on that one, so I do not  <br/>
have faith they can look at what is best for an individual.-=-<br/>
<br/>
But they operate on the authority of people who elected or hired them,  <br/>
and your faith in them isn&#39;t one of their factors.<br/>
<br/>
-=- So she is planning now on renouncing her citizenship in favor of  <br/>
New Zealand (she has a NZ passport) to do this.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Good deal then!  She could move to another place and register to  <br/>
homeschool and have more rights.  When people complain too loud and  <br/>
long about the homeschool laws where they live, the first response is  <br/>
usually &quot;Find locals who have figured it out&quot; and the last response is  <br/>
usually &quot;Then move.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Again, in light of unschooling, we advocate that with knowledge and  <br/>
support and guidance our children are free to pursue what interests  <br/>
them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This kind of statement is designed to get us to consent by silence.   <br/>
You&#39;re speaking for all unschoolers, and so the choice of others is to  <br/>
tacitly agree or to disagree, which seems to say the opposite thing.<br/>
<br/>
With knowledge and support and guidance my children have pursued MANY  <br/>
things--not because they &quot;are free,&quot; but because my husband and I gave  <br/>
them approval.  There are some things we don&#39;t have the power to  <br/>
approve.  They can&#39;t violate laws and say, &quot;Well my parents said it  <br/>
was okay.&quot;  (If they did, we could have lost custody, in some worst- <br/>
case scenario.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-If she has the knowledge and ability and experience, and guidance  <br/>
from other knowledgeable sailors, why are we, as unschoolers, saying  <br/>
it is a bad idea?-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;WE&quot; as unschoolers aren&#39;t saying anything.  If we had a governing  <br/>
council of unschoolers, they might vote and say what &quot;we as  <br/>
unschoolers&quot; were saying, but we don&#39;t and we shouldn&#39;t, ever ever  <br/>
ever.  Ever.  So one person said she thought it was wrong and didn&#39;t  <br/>
understand what people were afraid of.  Some other people said they  <br/>
understood what people were afraid of.<br/>
<br/>
For the purposes of this list, for people&#39;s learning about unschooling  <br/>
principles, the ideas are being discussed.  We will neither prevent a  <br/>
girl from sailing on a boat nor will we &quot;win her freedom&quot; from  <br/>
school.  We&#39;re just talking.  So please remember it&#39;s just words and  <br/>
don&#39;t get too excited.  The differences this discussion will make will  <br/>
be in the clarity of thought of those who read it and think about  <br/>
their own children, and responsibilities, and the laws and social  <br/>
entities with authority in their area.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say it was a bad idea.  I answered the question &quot;Why does  <br/>
that scare people so much?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2062387847">What I said was that I don&#39;t think, myself, personally, that taking that <br/>
kind of risk is worth trying to set a record for being the youngest to <br/>
do something. That THAT isn&#39;t a good reason, to ME, for letting a child <br/>
take that kind of risk. If you read the articles about her, you DO know <br/>
a lot - she grew up sailing, has sailed with her parents a TON and, as <br/>
far as the sailing goes, is undoubtedly as qualified as possible. That <br/>
isn&#39;t the issue or the question. The question was do we, as unschooling <br/>
parents, feel that we have to support this kind of extremely dangerous <br/>
interest? My answer is that we shouldn&#39;t abandon our better judgment <br/>
(better than a 7 year old, probably better than a 13 year old) under the <br/>
banner of &quot;supporting their interests.&quot; Her interest in sailing around <br/>
the world could be supported by her sailing with someone else, rather <br/>
than alone, for example. The only reason for doing it alone is to beat <br/>
some record for being the youngest, and I&#39;m saying that THAT doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem (to me, of course, to me - do I really need to keep saying that?) <br/>
like a good enough reason to take such an extraordinary risk.<br/>

look for what unschooling is like, what long-time unschoolers would do, <br/>

long-lasting wonderful extremely valuable thing. But how is my young <br/>
child going to have any way to assess how important that record will <br/>
seem in 20 years, let&#39;s say? So - in considering the risks and benefits, <br/>
I am at a great advantage over my child - I understand death and I <br/>
understand the fleeting nature of those kinds of records. I&#39;m just <br/>

really don&#39;t remember who it was, but a few years back somewhere a mom  <br/>
had a kid (youngish kid, pre-teen, maybe single-digits kid) who wanted  <br/>
to build a hovercraft, I think it was. And wanted to build a real one,  <br/>
and not a model.  One he could ride in.  And soon.   This mom was sure  <br/>
that it was her duty as an unschooling mom to make certain that he was  <br/>
able to do that.  I was pretty sure it was not only NOT her duty, but  <br/>
it might not even be within her capacity in any way to help him do  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, a sailboat should be on solid ground once a year to clean the bottom, check for hull, prop and rudder problems, change/replace the sacrificial zincs, and have the bottom repainted.<br/>
<br/>
Sailing is risky, as are other activities humans choose to engage in (climbing trees, driving, rappelling, gymnastics, backpacking trips, skiing, etc).  I as a parent have to look at my child&#39;s abilities and help him determine how to accomplish what he wants.  I try to find options, and do a LOT of talking with him sometimes, if my assessment of his abilities is different than his.  I have to obey the laws of my area and enforce those laws for him, even if they are counter to his desires ( I am thinking specifically of remaining in a car seat in his case).  I may even have to say no.  I know this.  BUT, if at some point he chose to undertake this trip, and he had solo sailing experience, and demonstrated the judgment and maturity to accomplish this adventure, why should I say no? <br/>
<br/>
Why isn&#39;t is counter to unschooling to tell a person that even though she has demonstrated all the knowledge, abilities and judgment necessary to undertake a task, I can still say no?  <br/>
<br/>
When people come here asking about, say, a child who likes to climb, we offer all sorts of options to make it safer.  We may ask that parent where the parent&#39;s fear or objections are coming from, and ask that parent to assess the situation and do what is possible to make it safer.  There are still risks with climbing, but we accept those risks.  Sailing is on that risk continuum, farther along than some people are willing to go.  I think that is what scares people.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2014071616">Interesting to see this story has reached the international news. I live in the Netherlands and have been following this story for some time.<br/>
In Dutch news and discussions on the internet, a lot of people focus on the fact that she will miss school and that that is a very very very bad thing in their opinion. Even members of parliament have made statements about this.<br/>
As I understand the ruling of earlier this week, the judges explicitly said that Laura&#39;s parents didn&#39;t do anything wrong. The judges approved of the fact that her parents had tried to dissuade her from her plans. Now child protection services have to prove she is not capable of this trip, if they can&#39;t she can go in october.<br/>
<br/>
The legal problems she&#39;s in now are partly caused by the fact that she was picked up by British child protection services after she arrived in Lowestoft (UK) by herself. They alerted Dutch child protection services. And then Laura&#39;s parents applied to the &#39;leerplichtambtenaar&#39; (government official who decides if you can take your child out of school or not), but used the wrong article in the law. They used an article that most homeschoolers in the Netherlands use, but it would have been better to use another one that lets children quit school to subscribe to a distance learning program. Since this is what Laura is planning to do, this is what they should have used.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that homeschooling in the Netherlands is difficult enough as it is, we definitely could do without all this negative publicity. There is no Dutch law that discusses homeschooling. We only have laws that say that children have to go to school. There are three exceptions: if they are physically or mentally unable to go to school, if there isn&#39;t a school within 20 km of the same religion of the family (this is the exception that almost all Dutch homeschoolers use), or if the child will use a distance learning program.<br/>
I took my son out of school three months after he started when he was four yo (normal age in the Netherlands to start school). I now have a 50% change of having to go to court to be able to homeschool. (If Dutch officials ever found out anything about unschooling, they would not like it. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
I think this is the reason why the Dutch media are making such a big deal out of the Laura case. Not only because what she wants to do is dangerous, but mainly because not going to school is considered very extreme in the Netherlands. On a population of 16 million people, only about 250 children are homeschooled.<br/>

it. It doesn&#39;t matter if it is bicycling, flying, sailing, or walking - <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First, my statement that it&#39;s right for the authorities to check into  <br/>
something like this is a general statement. Not all parents have pure  <br/>
motives. Not all parents have good relationships with their kids.Not  <br/>
all parents know how to respond when a child&#39;s idea needs a &quot;Let&#39;s  <br/>
find a safer way to explore that.&quot; It&#39;s not fair to kids to assume  <br/>
all parents are as involved in their kids lives as gets discussed here.<br/>
<br/>
Second, kids *in general* are different from adults. They are  <br/>
biologically more dependent, less experienced with the world, less  <br/>
able to understand the permanence of death and injury, under estimate  <br/>
the riskiness of the world and over estimate their abilities to  <br/>
handle risks they haven&#39;t experienced. Some of that is biological.  <br/>
(Sandra has a good page on Piaget: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/piaget.)">http://sandradodd.com/piaget.)</a>  <br/>
Some is cultural because most children are raised to do what they&#39;re  <br/>
told until they&#39;re &quot;old enough&quot; to make their own choices. (And  <br/>
parents are flabbergasted when kids don&#39;t know how!) Wrong though  <br/>
that sounds to unschoolers, it doesn&#39;t change the reality of most kids.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t possible for an extraordinary 13 yo to be  <br/>
capable of sailing around the world solo. It means that unschooling  <br/>
parents shouldn&#39;t jump to the conclusion that a 13 yo who wants to do  <br/>
something cool and out of the box is necessarily coming from a  <br/>
supportive environment.<br/>

<br/>
Oh, absolutely not!  There are many times I hesitate, think over a request, make a decision.  As an example, my son went without training wheels on his 2 wheel bike for the first time 2 weeks ago, and he immediately wanted to make a 3 mile bike ride with us that involved hills and major streets (5.75 y/o).  We said no, suggested riding the bike around the neighborhood first to build up confidence and for us to assess his skills, talk about traffic safety and road rules.  1.5 weeks later we made the ride to the park and he did fine.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my point.  We assessed his skills, made sure he could do it, and we did it together.  Were he older, I would assess his ability to follow traffic laws, make decisions about crossing the busy streets safely, and once I thought he could do that he would be free to go.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I am sorry you feel I have been ignoring this concern, as I thought the concern focused on the actual sailing.  I do not know if she will be totally on her own at all times.  While sailing, yes.  But in port will she have a parent meet her?  Or another adult?  Will they shadow her for a bit to make sure she can handle customs, provisioning, repairs?  I do not know these details and cannot address them.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling to me means being responsive to my child and his needs and desires.  Being respectful of him as a person, and not dismissing something simply because of age.  If I assess his abilities and think he is ready, if he has demonstrated his capabilities on progressively difficult levels, then how can I say no and still consider it unschooling?  To me it then feels like what my parents would say: &quot;Because I said so.&quot;<br/>

that &quot;prove&quot; it?<br/>
It would not.<br/>
<br/>
It might be evidence that the dad believes it.  It might be evidence  <br/>
that the dad cares more about making a political statement than to be  <br/>
with his daughter.  She was going to miss some quality family time  <br/>
anyway, being on a boat.  Bad move, I think, for the dad to risk  <br/>
losing custody.  It seems evidence that he&#39;s not too attached to her.<br/>
<br/>
Years back a mom went to jail rather than comply with government  <br/>
requirements about homeschooling or something; I looked the other way  <br/>
because it seemed horrible to me.   To &quot;defend&quot; the idea that children  <br/>
need their parents, she went to jail?  I didn&#39;t even want to know who  <br/>
was taking care of her kids and explaining to them how itproved she  <br/>
loved them, to have voluntarily accepted so severe a separation.<br/>
<br/>
-=- How much more do we need...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Who is &quot;WE&quot;?  This is the point you&#39;re missing.  How much more do YOU  <br/>
need?  This list isn&#39;t making a decision about it.  If you want to  <br/>
affect that situation, this list is not the place to try to do it.  We  <br/>
could vote unanimously that she should go; we could ALL sign up to  <br/>
risk having our own children&#39;s custody taken away if the courts don&#39;t  <br/>
let that girl sail the world.  WHY?  It still wouldn&#39;t be the  <br/>
mechanism that makes the difference.<br/>
<br/>
-=- How much more do we need to for them to prove to the courts and  <br/>
the government that she can do this? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems you&#39;re confusing discussing an idea with political action,  <br/>
and that your own emotions and biochemistry (which should be dedicated  <br/>
to peace and joy for your own family) are being strung out and wasted  <br/>
over someone else&#39;s situation which you might or might not be able to  <br/>
affect, but the angst and indignation are inappropriate on this list  <br/>
and at your house, in my opinion.  My opinion about the list is more  <br/>
important that my opinion about your house, but on behalf of your own  <br/>
children, I think you should think much less about a 13 year old Dutch  <br/>
girl whose father&#39;s willing to lose custody, and much more about your  <br/>
own children.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Adults with less knowledge and experience than Dekker go cruising.  <br/>
Do we say merely because of age and lifetime experience, but lacking  <br/>
specific sailing experience, they are okay and she is not? Who is more  <br/>
at risk- the one who knows what they are doing, or the one who  <br/>
doesn&#39;t?-=-<br/>
<br/>
A person who allows a child to make a deadly decision is the most at  <br/>
risk.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, that pretty much sucks. =(<br/>
<br/>
As I&#39;ve mentioned a few times, my family lives on a boat, and we hang<br/>
out with other boat families a lot. Boating encourages a different<br/>
form of self-reliance and confidence in children than land living<br/>
does. On land, if Rowan (who is 7) tries to drive the car, people are<br/>
nervous, but if he drives the boat (which he does regularly) he is<br/>
roundly encouraged by the other boaters. On land, when he picks up<br/>
power tools, people get nervous, but around boats, people ask &quot;can<br/>
Rowan come help us fetch tools when we&#39;re working?&quot; Those are just<br/>
examples. I think the root of it is that in a boat environment, kids<br/>
are integrated into the working of the home in a way that land<br/>
dwellers of any age are not, so they pick up many more skills with<br/>
regards to keeping the water out, the people in, and the boat moving<br/>
forward, than land kids in houses do. It&#39;s just a question of context.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;ve learned, over the years, is to let people have their own<br/>
fears, and to try to just pass the bean dip. Land people have all<br/>
kinds of fears of boats, oceans, water, and eventually it gets really<br/>
bothersome to have accepted a different kind of risk in my parenting.<br/>
If people press, I usually reply with something like &quot;y&#39;know, in a<br/>
house, you have electrical plugs, heavy things on shelves and in high<br/>
cabinets, hot water from taps and unsecured on stoves, power lines,<br/>
streets, trees, and neighbors, all of which are proven dangerous to<br/>
children in some context. And you&#39;ve accepted those risks, so allow me<br/>
mine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read the articles, but frankly, just like with Zac Sunderland,<br/>
the media is so whacked, I can&#39;t trust what I&#39;m reading to give me the<br/>
real answers I&#39;m seeking.<br/>
<br/>
Is Laura doing this *to be* the youngest, or does Laura want to do<br/>
this now and would therefore be the youngest? Is it an unassisted solo<br/>
circumnavigation, or thoroughly assisted, as most circumnavigations<br/>
(of any age) are these days? What&#39;s her intended route? What&#39;s her<br/>
intended schedule? What&#39;s her boat&#39;s setup? There is a lot of fine<br/>
detail there that completely changes, from a sailing perspective,<br/>
whether this might be a good idea or a total disaster. And it&#39;s all<br/>
completely independent of age.<br/>
<br/>
Every year, adults with little to no experience but plenty of cash buy<br/>
boats and head out around the world. I&#39;ll never forget the guy who had<br/>
never been on a boat, but came into a bunch of cash, bought a boat,<br/>
and headed out down the California Coast  a few days after purchase.<br/>
He radioed the Coast Guard for directions to San Diego. Poor guy had<br/>
never heard of nautical charts, and didn&#39;t know how to use a GPS. He<br/>
figured he&#39;d just head out and it&#39;d all be obvious, but didn&#39;t realize<br/>
there&#39;d be fog out there.<br/>

biologically more dependent, less experienced with the world, less<br/>
able to understand the permanence of death and injury, under estimate<br/>
the riskiness of the world and over estimate their abilities to<br/>
handle risks they haven&#39;t experienced. Some of that is biological. -=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-918162333">-=-I think this is the reason why the Dutch media are making such a  <br/>
big deal out of the Laura case. Not only because what she wants to do  <br/>
is dangerous, but mainly because not going to school is considered  <br/>
very extreme in the Netherlands. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Politically speaking, that makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Practically and legally speaking, if she only made it to England  <br/>
before being picked up by child protective authorities, how many other  <br/>
countries would consider it inapproprirate? She&#39;s too young to cross  <br/>
the ocean on an airplane without special paperwork.  I don&#39;t think the  <br/>
largest court in the Netherlands could dictate to every other country  <br/>
in which she might land that they have to let her stay alone and leave  <br/>
alone.<br/>
