Ooooh, what&#39;s the name for that, the year that the date or your birthday<br/>
equals your age? I know there&#39;s a special name for it, I just can&#39;t<br/>
remember... Rain was 10 yesterday, on the 10th. :)<br/>

People said &quot;star birthday&quot; and &quot;golden birthday.&quot;<br/>
I hadn&#39;t ever heard of it before!  Holly was two on the 2nd of November, long <br/>
ago, but didn&#39;t care.  Kirby&#39;s the 29th of July; by then he might not care <br/>
either.  Marty got a good one!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Golden birthday was the one I was trying to think of, I think. I just<br/>
heard of it recently, I hadn&#39;t heard of it by the time I was 20, which<br/>
would have been mine (March). Ten is a good one, too.<br/>
<br/>
I hope Marty has a good party - it sounds like fun! Rain and the two teen<br/>
boys next door love playing with the boffers, I might suggest the head<br/>
thing.<br/>
