<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644279029">here in the GA bible belt, when we set up our bank<br/>
account when we first moved, the girl at the bank<br/>
asked us where (not if, not what kind of church might<br/>
we be considering) we were attending church and<br/>
invited us to hers. she even teaches my son&#39;s sunday<br/>
school class, she informed me brightly. I was<br/>
speechless. dh hates to make any ripples, and smoothed<br/>
it over somehow. he doesn&#39;t even like my &quot;breastfed is<br/>
bestfed&quot; bumper sticker-- thinks it&#39;s too political!<br/>
lol so I am quite familiar with the &quot;which baptist are<br/>
you?&quot; scenario! I really don&#39;t understand making that<br/>
assumption-- positively mind-boggling.<br/>
<br/>
Julia, who is considering adding a purple stripe to<br/>
her hair now ;D</div>
