<div id="ygrps-yiv-750946479">I&#39;m posting this for a friend (really!).  She&#39;s been unschooling her <br/>
kids (now 16 and 13) for a number of years.  She&#39;s getting divorced <br/>
and her soon-to-be ex-husband wants the kids to be in public school <br/>
and is getting the court to order it.  Her computer is broken, but she <br/>
really wants to talk with someone who has had a similar experience.  <br/>
We are in the Central Valley in California just east of the San <br/>
Francisco Bay Area.  Can anyone help or guide me in the right <br/>
direction to help my friend?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100002218">What help does she need?  <br/>
She just signs them up for school and they go.<br/>
<br/>
Does she want help fighting it in the courts?<br/>
Reasurance about school?<br/>
<br/>
At these ages, it can&#39;t do them much damage, can it?  Most of the unschoolers <br/>
I know who are that age would be very little fazed by schoolish nonsense.  <br/>
The divorce will probably do them more emotional damage than school will, so I <br/>
would advise her against blaming things on school that ANY children would go <br/>
through during and after a divorce.<br/>
<br/>
If she wants encouragement to detach herself emotionally from the school&#39;s <br/>
stuff, there&#39;s this:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
<br/>
Some won&#39;t apply if they&#39;re there against their own will, but  a lot will.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the 16 year old is old enough to go to college instead of high school, <br/>
and possibly even the younger one, in a year or two if not now.  California <br/>
has a fantastic deal for residents and the two-year colleges.   She could look <br/>
on the internet (or you could look for her) for the Wes Beach information on <br/>
that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1819715139">Thanks Sandra for your simple, yet brilliant, observations!<br/>
I just sent this article, to a niece with 4 kids in public school.<br/>
She has over-extended herself, to the point of physical and fiscal <br/>
exhaustion, in her efforts to provide her kids with &quot;The Best&quot; <br/>
education. After hearing repeatedly about incidents of bullying, <br/>
contagious illnesses and &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot;, I also tell<br/>
her to just keep them home. Hopefully, this will help her ease up on <br/>
herself.<br/>
<br/>
It also should help her to be more accepting of her aunt&#39;s &quot;Crazy&quot; <br/>
decision to homeschool. Ooops! In my note to the attachment, I <br/>
mentioned that you&#39;re an authority on Unschooling. I think I might <br/>
have let the cat out of the bag. She really has no idea how far we&#39;ve <br/>
decided to go (not?) in our approach homeschooling!<br/>
<br/>
I also printed this out for DH, who spends all day on computers <br/>
(literally), and is therefore reluctant to go on-line once at home.<br/>
So much for my dream of a paperless (home) office! I think that <br/>
reading about your very schoolish sister deciding to allow her kids <br/>
to choose Homeschooling for themselves should bolster his resolve to <br/>
allow our daughter to follow her own methods of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your daughter. At least you know that if she decides <br/>
to attend school, it will be her choice and that, should she change <br/>
her mind about it, once there, she will have the courage to leave.<br/>
<br/>
Live, laugh, Learn!<br/>

<br/>
If she goes it will not be to learn the subject matter.  She wants to go out <br/>
of pent up curiosity about what the big deal is, and how real schools are <br/>
different from TV and movie portrayals.   She&#39;d be like a field anthropologist or <br/>
a spy. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She said she would only do the homework she thought was fun and quit if she <br/>
started getting F&#39;s, or by October, whichever came first.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll want to get up at 7:00 three or four days in a row, let <br/>
alone five days a week, so I&#39;m not TOO worried.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would encourage her to wait til 9th grade. A lot of the freshmen are <br/>
feeling nervous about starting high school.  They are all at <br/>
the &quot;bottom of the barrel&quot; at that point and they don&#39;t have that &quot;we <br/>
rule the school&quot; attitude 8th graders can tend to have.  The junior <br/>
high behavior can be brutal, but I&#39;ve found that they want to act more <br/>
mature in high school since they are going to school with near adults.<br/>
Carly started 9th grade this year and has had a mostly positive <br/>
experience.  It was also very easy to sign her up.  The guidance <br/>
councelor told me they are all starting from scratch in 9th grade and <br/>
I didn&#39;t need any documentation of all the previous years.  Maybe we <br/>
lucked out with an easy going guy.<br/>
And for anyone worried about how a radical unschooler would do in a <br/>
school environment; she has had all A&#39;s and B&#39;s (honor roll) on her <br/>
report cards (3 so far).  Her teachers love here and her &quot;entusiasm <br/>
for learning&quot; as they put it.<br/>
I think it would be entirerly different if she was forced by her dad <br/>
to go after a divorce though.  That&#39;s a tough one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2147260393">For what it&#39;s worth, my daughter decided to go to school this year in the<br/>
7th grade. Geography was the thing she knew nothing about but was so<br/>
motivated she memorized the states&#39; locations in a day. Math took her a week<br/>
or so to catch on to be at somewhere in the middle of her class. Now she has<br/>
all A&#39;s and is skipping 8th grade. It has been a scary process for me,<br/>
because it seemed like she was buying into a process that I don&#39;t, but due<br/>
to Sandra&#39;s simple yet wise advise (&quot;Let her enjoy it!&quot;) I  am just loving<br/>
and supporting her through this. The teachers really appreciate her too!<br/>
They really know a motivated student when they see one, and by this age,<br/>
don&#39;t see too many of them!<br/>

We checked out different schools for Hannah to try, and she picked a small<br/>
art charter school. We are lucky to have that here.<br/>

No.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not worth hating.  It&#39;s just part of a real set of data we&#39;re sharing <br/>
for free with each other to help people feel better about the very scary <br/>
decision they&#39;re making.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby went to college.  Got a D in English on his first essay (on a paper the <br/>
teacher said was B writing, but he had violated technicalities most of you <br/>
would probably think were ridiculous). Is getting an A in math, though he never <br/>
took a math class ever before in his life.<br/>
<br/>
Is that something I should not share?  <br/>
If every unschooler who went back to school was entirely baffled and got <br/>
horrible grades, no one would want to unschool anymore.  <br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;re not promising anyone anything, and yet still sharing experiences.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly goes and does NOT get bad grades, should I keep that secret or share <br/>
it?  It WOULD be a story of unschooling and school.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I hate it when people justify homeschooling of any kind by their <br/>
children&#39;s grades being as good as or better than a schooling child&#39;s. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why does it bother you so much?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a radio interview in which I talked about the block of years that <br/>
unschoolers are likely to be behind, before they&#39;re &quot;ahead&quot; again.   <br/>

-----------------<br/>
 <br/>
Comparisons are inevitable.<br/>
 <br/>
We also compare those more important reasons on which unschooling is  based.  <br/>
And we brag to each other about those things.  Is that as  unfair?  If we say <br/>
schooled kids don&#39;t seem to do as well at independence  and honesty and <br/>
desire to hang out with their siblings or parents, that they  tend to avoid eye <br/>
contact with adults and to want to be away from home as much  as possible, would <br/>
it be somehow better NOT to make those comparisons?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-906548784">I thought I would share my own comparison to public school.  After one year of deschooling/unschooling, my son came to me and said that he was very worried that he isn&#39;t learning.Long story, but I went ahead and enrolled him in a charter school (public school system where they give the books/lesson plans and you meet with them weekly to show the work completed).  The first week he was enrolled they wanted to give him placement tests -- I was hesistant about this, but he went ahead and did the testing.  The end result?  The school was absolutely amazed...he was in 6th grade, but placed in 12++grade for math (his favorite) and his science.  Social studies was very high too, and reading/spelling was about 10th grade level.  What was so great is that he decided to stop attending the school within a week or two.  While he was only unschooled for about a year, that placement test gave him the satisfaction that he was still learning at home, without textbooks, structure, etc.  We have continued unschooling and I LOVE it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care if my kids fit public school standards, BUT if I have something that gives a great comparison on unschooling vs. public school, I do love to share.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Kristi<br/>
I didn&#39;t mean to sound like I was bragging or that Carly making the <br/>
honor roll was the only way to judge her experience in school.<br/>
I was only mentioning it to help people who do wonder how these <br/>
unschoolers might fare in a school environment, where grades are the <br/>
be all and end all of success there.  And I wasn&#39;t justifying my <br/>
choices with her grades because this wasn&#39;t my choice at all.  <br/>
It does make it easier for me to deal with people who thought I was <br/>
crazy for unschooling.   If she had gone and left, or gone a really <br/>
struggled and made fair to bad grades, I would have to defend our <br/>
ways, when people would comment on it.  This way, I get to hear things <br/>
like, &quot;you did such a great job with her!&quot;  Even my husband tries to <br/>
give me credit!  I always say, &quot;I didn&#39;t do anything but let her be <br/>
who she is.  She gets all the credit for what&#39;s happening in school&quot;<br/>
I don&#39;t think people believe me.  <br/>
I never would have dreamed she would find it all so easy.  She was so <br/>
NON academic all of her life.  I really thought the getting up early <br/>
would get to her.  She LOVES having a place to go to everyday where <br/>
she can express herself in fashion, so that makes it worth it to her.  <br/>
She loves the interpersonal dynamics that happen all day long there, <br/>
with other kids and the adults in the system.<br/>
She decided after the first week that she would probably stay and that <br/>
she wanted to get good grades if she was going to do this.<br/>
I told her &quot;Okay, but you better not make the honor roll, cause I&#39;m <br/>
NOT going to put one of those &quot;My child made the honor roll at.....&quot; <br/>
bumper stickers on my car.  When she actually did make it (which was <br/>
not a goal for her) she told all her friends that she was going to be <br/>
in big trouble. :-)<br/>
Anyone who unschools can probably imagine that we are not sitting here <br/>
implying to her that these grades make her something better than what <br/>
she was before she went to school.  If we gave her any indication of <br/>
that, she would put us in our places quickly.  She would find that <br/>
insulting, coming from us.  She&#39;ll take the $100 that Pop Pop gave her <br/>
for it though ;-).  She has come away with an idea that grades are <br/>
definetly a product of playing the school game not a indication of <br/>
intelligence.  <br/>
She thinks a lot about what is going on and we talk a lot about all of <br/>
it.   She&#39;s not an unschooler anymore, but I still am (and am still <br/>
unschooling with her younger siblings) and our relationship and my <br/>
parenting is still heavily influenced by that philosophy.<br/>
The grades do make it easier for me to say &quot;See! :-p, I knew what I <br/>
was doing.&quot;  But, if she hadn&#39;t done as well, or had left, it wouldn&#39;t <br/>
affect our thoughts on unschooling.  I know my daughter, and know she <br/>
is brilliant.  It would have made it harder to defend though.  Like my <br/>
8yo not reading yet.  It&#39;s so much easier for us when they fall into <br/>
the norms, or even excel.  That&#39;s one of reasons we have boards like <br/>
this.  To help us when they don&#39;t meet outside expectations.<br/>

Right.<br/>
Kirby getting a D in English didn&#39;t make me think he would never write. It <br/>
reminded me that teachers and school can be crushing and horrible.  I felt <br/>
sorrier for the other three who got a D, and the four who got F&#39;s, because they had <br/>
taken English 101 after 12 or 13 years of school and STILL made a horrible <br/>
grade.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby starting out baffled in Math 099 didn&#39;t surprise me a bit.  How could <br/>
he NOT be baffled?  Kirby having an A average at the midpoint surprised me in a <br/>
good way, and made me calm (more calm, but I&#39;m already calm) about Marty and <br/>
Holly who have always been &quot;better at math&quot; than Kirby (meaning, here, quick <br/>
at puzzles and computations and better at spatial reasoning and less likely to <br/>
ask me or Keith for help in such things).<br/>
<br/>
For those people who fear or have spouses who REALLY fear that unschoolers <br/>
will be clueless, at least grades indicate that not all are.  Nothing can <br/>
promise every unschooler will be happy or good at school or creative or easily <br/>
employed.   But every story of ease or success refutes claims of &quot;can&#39;t&quot; or &quot;will <br/>
never&quot; or &quot;will fail&quot; or &quot;will be unemployable.&quot;<br/>
