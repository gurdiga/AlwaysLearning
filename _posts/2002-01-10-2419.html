<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386395281">My 11 yo son takes karate. At his dojo (which we love), studying hard and <br/>
getting good grades is encouraged. They give an academic patch to put on the <br/>
uniform to kids who get straight As  during a couple of grading periods in a <br/>
year. This is pretty easy for little children to accomplish as they only need <br/>
all S&#39;s (satisfactory) on their report cards to get the patch, but for <br/>
children in the later grades it&#39;s quite a bit harder. My son really wants an <br/>
academic patch on his gi. I don&#39;t like the idea. I know that the kids of his <br/>
age in school who get all A&#39;s are working pretty hard, often in subject areas <br/>
they don&#39;t enjoy, and doing a lot of homework and stressing out about it. <br/>
This isn&#39;t the life I want for my son! On the other hand, it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
fair to those other kids to give my son straight A&#39;s for his unschooling life <br/>
and him earn a patch for having a great time. But I want to help him with his <br/>
goals, and an academic patch is currently one of his goals. What do I do?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-900161376">When I taught, I would let the kids (this was<br/>
in a private school where each student has<br/>
his or her own curriculum, plan of study,<br/>
although we did do some group things) grade<br/>
themselves.  We&#39;d sit down at the end of each<br/>
semester and I&#39;d show them (if it was like in<br/>
math or something) their scores on things I<br/>
graded, which were almost always 100% because<br/>
if they did a math problem wrong we redid it<br/>
together or the student redid it or whatever,<br/>
until we got it right, and same for papers,<br/>
we did a lot of rewriting. We wrote very few<br/>
papers, but most of them were rewritten until<br/>
publishable.  Anyway, we&#39;d talk about various<br/>
aspects of grades and then they would tell me<br/>
what grade they deserved.  The kids were<br/>
almost always harder on themselves than I<br/>
would have been, which I found very amusing.<br/>
They would say &quot;well, I think I only should<br/>
get a B because my attitude wasn&#39;t always so<br/>
great and sometimes I didn&#39;t want to do such<br/>
and such, and I don&#39;t remember all my dates<br/>
now, and I&#39;d say, well, I think you deserve<br/>
an A because of these reasons.  I mean, we<br/>
had to put something down, so we discussed it<br/>
and came up with something they found fair.<br/>
Almost all of my kids got an A, if they were<br/>
there most of the time, tried most of the<br/>
time, put some effort into it, etc. they got<br/>
an A. The ones that weren&#39;t there or came<br/>
stoned, or whatever, well, those kids were<br/>
always very hard on themselves.  I think that<br/>
when given the opportunity kids will always<br/>
be more honest about their achievements.  I&#39;d<br/>
ask your son, sit down with the five or six<br/>
basic &quot;subjects&quot; that woudl be on a report<br/>
card and ask him to justify an A.  If he can<br/>
do so, then give it to him. I think if you<br/>
think about it, justifying an A is not a big<br/>
deal.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I got lots of &quot;A&#39;s&quot; I didn&#39;t<br/>
deserve.  I mean, learning came easy for me<br/>
and test taking did too, in high school.  If<br/>
I studied just a little, read the book once,<br/>
I could generally ace a multiple choice<br/>
test.  ln college I rarely studied at all, I<br/>
figured out I could get a B without<br/>
studying--I&#39;d read the book and that was<br/>
about it.  No one cares I only got B&#39;s in<br/>
college, now.  Grades are so arbitrary, I<br/>
know teachers that graded on how well they<br/>
liked a particular student, or teachers that<br/>
purposely graded very smart students<br/>
differently (this child can do MORE than this<br/>
child, so this paper is a B paper, so I can<br/>
make this child try harder, but this child is<br/>
not as smart, so I&#39;ll give him an A, even<br/>
though on another student it would be a B<br/>
paper.)  I wouldn&#39;t worry a bit about giving<br/>
my child straight &quot;A&#39;s&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
I conned my English teacher into an A my senior year in high school this way. <br/>
 I skipped classes, barely wrote in the journal he wanted us to keep, didn&#39;t <br/>
do many of the projects.  When I came in for my review, he asked me what I&#39;d <br/>
learned, and I said, in a humble voice, that I&#39;d learned I could be <br/>
irresponsible about deadlines, that I tended to procrastinate instead of <br/>
breaking projects down into doable bits.  I said I valued the journal because <br/>
it showed me over the course of the semester where I&#39;d had opportunities and <br/>
hadn&#39;t availed myself of them.  He nodded happily and gave me an A.<br/>
<br/>
It was bunk.  I simply didn&#39;t want to do the work -- I was too busy riding my <br/>
bike and partying with friends in the garden instead of going to class.  I&#39;d <br/>
already been accepted to UC Santa Cruz.  Wasn&#39;t worried about grades.<br/>
<br/>
I realize your students may have been absolutely sincere.<br/>

&gt; themselves.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I worked for the homeschooling charter school last year, they<br/>
started this stupid &quot;report cards required&quot; thing last year. I fought it,<br/>
and they allowed me to do &quot;Narrative Summaries&quot; instead, where I just<br/>
laid out what the kid had done with no value judgments (I wrote them and<br/>
got parents&#39; okay, if they wanted that, or else they wrote and I edited<br/>
if necessary, again with their okay). They wouldn&#39;t allow summaries for<br/>
high school, though, and some parents thought the whole thing was too<br/>
much off a hassle anyway, so we just did all A&#39;s or O&#39;s (for Outstanding,<br/>
the K-3 deal was O -S - N).<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing was one of the more annoying changes, and one of the<br/>
reasons I left. Although we have contemplated making up report cards to<br/>
take to Chuck E Cheese and get free tokens.<br/>
<br/>
The Funky Catholic (there&#39;s an oxymoron for you) school I went to during<br/>
the seventies had no grades, just written evaluations... at the end of<br/>
every semester, I evaluated each class and teacher, and each teacher<br/>
evaluated me.  It was fairly non-judgemental -  &quot;Daron learned to do X,<br/>
Y, and Z easily, and has starting working on A and B&quot;. That&#39;s the school<br/>
where I took classes on tea-making and the Equal Rights Amendment, in 3rd<br/>
grade or so...<br/>
<br/>
Cacie has no experience with grades, I don&#39;t think. Once or twice she&#39;s<br/>
written out some math problems and then put an &quot;A&quot; at the top. She did<br/>
ask the other day if there was a grade called &quot;E&quot;, and I told her the<br/>
story about how I moved from Funky Catholic School to a traditional<br/>
public school in the middle of 4th grade, and when I got my first<br/>
assignment back it had a big &quot;E-&quot; at the top. I figured A, B, C, D, E, F<br/>
- ohmigod, I almost flunked! And I&#39;d only missed one....<br/>
<br/>
I think it took a couple of days before I noticed that none of the papers<br/>
had A-D or F on them, and asked another kid, who explined the whole<br/>
(E)xcellent - (S)atisfactory - (N)eeds Improvement thing to me. Like kids<br/>
can&#39;t figure out that an N is an F..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-728694223">What *I* would do would be ask the sensei to drop the program.<br/>
He probably wouldn&#39;t, right away, but down the line after the next glitch or <br/>
two, he probably would.  <br/>

It&#39;s a damned shame to make school a factor in a non-school activity.  If the <br/>
best karate student is NOT great at school it shouldn&#39;t matter.  He should be <br/>

<br/>
*nods*  I agree.<br/>
<br/>
However, many dojos sell their programs to parents on the basis of:  Your <br/>
child&#39;s concentration will improve, their schoolwork will improve, their <br/>
manners (particularly respect for authority) will improve.  It soothes the <br/>
&quot;training my kid to be a killer&quot; fears.  So they lean toward ways to tie in <br/>
school performance with dojo life.  They see telling a child they must do <br/>
well in school to progress at the dojo as reality-based training.  It&#39;s <br/>
acknowledged as an extra curricular activity.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not really much of a factor. They do encourage the kids to study and <br/>
make good grades, but not very many kids get the academic patch. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be much of an issue. I&#39;ve never heard any lectures about kids not <br/>
studying enough, or not enough kids earning the patch, or any negative talk <br/>
at all about less than perfect grades. If a kid does bring in report cards <br/>
with the A&#39;s and they get the patch they are congratulated, but it&#39;s pretty <br/>
low key. Glenn&#39;s instructor is a great instance of a non-academically <br/>
talented karate student. He is 19 years old, the dojo owner&#39;s son, very <br/>
handsome, and the kindest, most loving, sweetest person I have ever known. He <br/>
is amazingly talented in karate and in kickboxing (holds numerous national <br/>
titles and several world titles) and not in the least at school. All his <br/>
years in school he never got straight A&#39;s or anything close to it and it <br/>
didn&#39;t matter. His dad didn&#39;t fuss at him, nobody cared that he didn&#39;t have <br/>
even one academic patch on his gi. So it&#39;s not like there is a stigma <br/>
attached to not having the patch. My son Glenn just wants to earn one. I&#39;m <br/>
trying to figure out how to help him meet that goal in some sort of manner we <br/>
can both be happy with. I&#39;d prefer it if he didn&#39;t care about the patch, but <br/>
for right now he does, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to work with. Thanks to <br/>
everyone who has given me your thoughts on this.<br/>

<br/>
Because for us, for Kirby, his karate is a main activity, the major learning <br/>
opportunity, not secondary.  They wanted him to work Thursdays, but scheduled <br/>
around the travel time for his karate class that day, leaving the store open <br/>
longer on Thursdays so Pokemon League could still be two hours, but Kirby <br/>
could go to karate.<br/>
<br/>
I think every time you say &quot;But he doesn&#39;t GO to school&quot; it will be that much <br/>
more education for all those other parents!  (and the teacher).<br/>

work on specific skills, have an actual teacher (Casey likes this), set <br/>
goals and make new friends. Lots of the other girls are burning out by going <br/>
to school all day and then gym. When parent&#39;s ask what I  would suggest, I <br/>
always say the kid is overscheduled. Time to drop school. ;-) You should see <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662820552">Is AlwaysLearning now a TCS discussion board?  <br/>
<br/>
  *************************************************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve not had a problem with seatbelts and our own children since toddlerhood, but sometimes with visiting children it&#39;s been an issue.  My own kids are more likely to freak out if I even start the car before they&#39;re buckled in, but they&#39;ve all resisted the carseat after age 3 or so.  The most recent version of this is that Dan wants his carseat moved to the middle of the backseat (right now they each sit at a window).  Sure, I could buckle his seat in there, but it would really crowd his brother.  What do you say when the only reason you can&#39;t comply is fairness to others?  He&#39;s never acknowledged it would be unfair to his brother -- I&#39;ve just told him I won&#39;t do it.  <br/>
<br/>
  I find my biggest challenge with consensual living is reaching a compromise when one of us wants/needs to go somewhere and others resist going along.  My kids are too young to stay home alone, and we simply don&#39;t have the income to pay a sitter (besides where would I find someone mid-day on a weekday during the schoolyear?).  It seems the more I try to convince for the activity or commitment, the more resistance I get.  Fortunately, it&#39;s not terribly often, but invariably it&#39;s when I simply don&#39;t have the time to negotiate.<br/>
<br/>
  A recent example is that Andy has decided we doesn&#39;t want to go along to LaLeche meetings.  I&#39;m one of two leaders in our group, so skipping the meeting really isn&#39;t an option.  I&#39;m on call for the phones one day a week, and also listed online, so I sometimes get calls when it&#39;s not my day.  When I interrupt or have to put off something he wants to take a call, he&#39;s very upset.  This week, he&#39;s said several times that he&#39;d like me to quit LaLeche League.  That&#39;s not an option -- I really enjoy this and it&#39;s important to me.  <br/>
<br/>
  And what do you do/say within TCS for those instances where two children are at complete odds over something and there&#39;s just no physical way to accommodate both?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469964503">I am a card carrying member of La Leche. (Literally have a card with <br/>
the North Carolina law with statue number and exact law stating that <br/>
a women has the right to breastfeed in any public or private place <br/>
that she has a right be.) I was devoted to helping other new mothers <br/>
learn to breastfeed. <br/>
<br/>
But my son is apparently an introvert or at least he was very <br/>
disturbed by all the people and activity in such a small room in <br/>
which we had our La Leche meetings. I am an extravert. I NEED people <br/>
to discuss ideas with. I NEED the social contact with other adults. <br/>
But, I chose to get my needs met elsewhere. I still offer my support <br/>
to breastfeeding mothers but we can&#39;t be in such a small room for an <br/>
hour or two. We meet other La Leche moms at the park. We chat and e-<br/>
mail. I untangled what each of our priority needs and wants were by <br/>
searching for the answers within us through questioning and <br/>
observing. <br/>
<br/>
Solutions are infinite when sought creatively through negotiation. <br/>
Some options do not initially appear comfortable. But one eliminates <br/>
possible solutions when something is &quot;not an option&quot;. By keeping all <br/>
options open and confidence that &quot;having to&quot; or &quot;making someone&quot; is <br/>
going to obstruct the creative process of problem solving, one is <br/>
empowered to find a common preference.<br/>
<br/>
What need are you trying to meet? What need is the child trying to <br/>
meet? Share this information. Ask for this information. Explain the <br/>
effects on you or others. Elicit their knowledge and feelings. Share <br/>
your knowledge and feelings. Ask for suggestions from others as you <br/>
have here, but also with the people involved.<br/>
<br/>
Validate their desires and needs. Choosing to avoid the possibility <br/>
of &quot;making them&quot; empowers their ability to creatively solve problems. <br/>
Consensual living is a skill that they can learn to develop with <br/>
opportunities to practice. Why spend the energy to solve a problem <br/>
when they or you know that the solution is &quot;not negotiable&quot;. <br/>

sit at a window).  Sure, I could buckle his seat in there, but it <br/>
would really crowd his brother.  What do you say when the only reason <br/>
you can&#39;t comply is fairness to others?  He&#39;s never acknowledged it <br/>
would be unfair to his brother -- I&#39;ve just told him I won&#39;t do it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-766544033">In our house, we skip around.  Alexx needs to be in 9th grade for something, well, then, she&#39;s now in 9th grade.  It&#39;s so stupid, this grade thing.  Even in school, or especially in school, kids are very often not in the grade they &quot;belong in&quot; as determined by age.  So many parents are holding kids back or starting them early.  Kids skip a grade, or are retained, per some whim of a teacher or an administrator or a parent, so why should I not, as all three, also change grades per whatever whim I feel at the moment.  <br/>
<br/>
But, more on topic, Alexx&#39;s response is usually college, these days.  Technically, by her age, she should have just finished her 7th grade year, but after two skips for whatever reason that seemed important at the time, she just finished 9th grade.  But mostly, it doesn&#39;t matter. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Since my oldest is rather outgoing, the question is usually directed at him  <br/>
and he usually just says, &quot;We don&#39;t do grades, we homeschool&quot;, rather  <br/>
matter-of-factly. If I get the question, I&#39;m almost always alone, and I really  don&#39;t <br/>
know, so I look confused, try to count, then I usually just give up and  say <br/>
his age, hoping that&#39;s what they were looking for. Sometimes that&#39;s it,  <br/>
sometimes they&#39;ll offer something like, &quot;So, that&#39;s 3rd or 4th grade then?&quot; or  <br/>
something like that.<br/>
 <br/>
We sometimes get &quot;teacher&quot; questions, too, which Wyl likes to field. His  <br/>
standard answer is, &quot;I don&#39;t have teachers, I homeschool&quot;, and will clarify that  <br/>
he learns on his own if people insist that of course his mom is his teacher.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-328584061">I live in the UK but was raised in the U.S. so I don&#39;t know what grade Simon and Linnaea would be in. If I were in the U.S. there would probably be a pause while I calculated what grade they would be in. In the U.K. I just say how old they are, or say something like they don&#39;t go to school. I don&#39;t tend to get asked that a lot. I imagine that Simon and Linnaea are more likely to be asked that by other children than I am these days. <br/>

Oh, I just looked it up. Linnaea would be in year 3 or year 4 and Simon would be in year 6 or year 7. So that prepares me for the next year, I guess.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1420000995">I am embarassed to say that I signed up for this group a looooong time ago and haven&#39;t opened it up again until today.  <br/>
<br/>
As I never did an intro to the group, I&#39;ll start with that.  I am homeschooling my youngest child, and have homeschooled my oldest one although she is back in public school now (her choice).  We live in a small town, my husband works a lot of hours and generally doesn&#39;t do any of the schooling with the kids unless there is a specific piece of a project that he wants to/is asked to do.  I am a home daycare provider and so we are basically home bound most of the week.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve not been unschooling but have always been interested in it.  I always intended to look into it and see how it would work for us but just never got the chance.  And then today, Alora out of the blue started talking about wanting to be in a wheel chair.  It sparked a discussion about how life would change for her which turned into a discussion about accessibility.  She went all around the house and pointed out all the things that would be difficult for her if she was in a wheelchair and is very interested in talking about it!  So, then I realized that it would be awesome for her developing empathy to get her a wheelchair and let her spend a day or two trying to figure out how to get around during our daily activities.  So I posted to our freecycle sites looking for a child sized wheel chair that we could borrow/have.  Then all of the sudden I realized - &quot;This must be what homeschooling is like!&quot; We could spend days measuring areas of the house and designing accessible equiptment.  I haven&#39;t seen her this excited about learning but she doesn&#39;t even seem to know that she&#39;s learning...so AWESOME!!  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the question - My big concern is that we&#39;ll commit to unschooling and then she&#39;ll decide to go back to public school next year and won&#39;t have learned yet the stuff that she&#39;ll need in order to transition back in.  I&#39;m also concerned that I can&#39;t with my schedule unschool successfully.  I can&#39;t just up and go to the museum or a library to learn more about something she&#39;s interested in.  We can&#39;t go for nature walks every day.  We are stuck in this house for a good portion of most days, and I&#39;ve always thought that unschoolers are able to do what they do because they have more opportunities to get out in the world.  Is there anyone else who had these concerns/limitations when they started unschooling?  If so....how did you get past them?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852067646">===My big concern is that we&#39;ll commit to unschooling and then she&#39;ll decide to go back to public school next year and won&#39;t have learned yet the stuff that she&#39;ll need in order to transition back in.===<br/>
<br/>
How old is Alora? Unless she&#39;s quite young, you should be able to talk with her about this concern and let her know that if she decides to return to public school that she&#39;ll (likely) have to test in order for the school to determine which grade she&#39;ll return to. <br/>
<br/>
That said, you can&#39;t commit to unschooling if you&#39;re worried about &quot;what if she returns to public school&quot;. If, at some point down the road, she wants to go back to public school, cross that bridge when you get to it. Unschooling is not the same as learn-at-home homeschooling, though, so some deschooling is definitely needed. That might be a challenge if your home daycare is structured in a schoolish way, though.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===We are stuck in this house for a good portion of most days, and I&#39;ve always thought that unschoolers are able to do what they do because they have more opportunities to get out in the world.===<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re doing home daycare, that job becomes a priority over unschooling while the daycare kids are there, does it not? That would certainly restrict your ability to do things spontaneously away from home with your kids. It&#39;s not unschooling that creates the restriction; the same restriction exists doing school-at-home homeschooling, or when your older daughter is in public school.<br/>
<br/>
Not everything has to be done during &quot;office hours&quot; (or whatever hours you do daycare). Walks can happen in the evenings or even at night (if your neighborhood is safe for that). If you live near water, going to the water at night is fun and so much different than going during the day. Museums and libraries are generally open on the weekends. I know our local library is open til 9:00pm some weeknights. If you have a Walmart there, poking around Walmart at night can be interesting -- the people watching alone is interesting! Very different crowd shopping at night than in the daytime.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of looking at what you can&#39;t do, look at what you CAN. If you didn&#39;t do home daycare during the day, what kinds of things would y&#39;all do away from home? Take that info and figure out which of those things can be done other than during your business hours. <br/>
<br/>
By the way, &quot;stuck in this house&quot; is so very negative. You *choose* to do home daycare; it allows you to be at home with your kids, even though it doesn&#39;t necessarily allow for spur-of-the-moment things away from home. What kinds of things can you make available at home to get away from that &quot;stuck&quot; thinking??? If it&#39;s a hot climate, see about getting some type of backyard pool -- they start from really inexpensive - or make use of a sprinkler often. Have mud fights. Plug in a box fan outside and buy a big bottle of bubbles and various bubble wands and let the kids play with those in front of the fan. Have the kids help set up an obstacle course. Find ways to make outside fun. <br/>
<br/>
There were a couple years when we were a one-car family and my husband would be gone for 1-2 weeks at a time. We live in Texas and it&#39;s HOT in the summer, so going for walks or bike rides wasn&#39;t remotely appealing, and there&#39;s not public transportation near us, so my son and I spent A LOT of days-in-a-row at home. We invested in an above-ground pool - best $100 we ever spent. We had internet, netflix, and video game systems that allowed us to connect with us people. When my husband was in town, we did lots of things away from home so that by the time a week he would be away from home rolled around, my son and I were ready for a stretch of days at home. We also have relatives nearby and my son was able to spend time with various cousins several days a week. There are ways to work around that stuck feeling that can come with being mostly homebound all week.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===So, then I realized that it would be awesome for her developing empathy to get her a wheelchair and let her spend a day or two trying to figure out how to get around during our daily activities.===<br/>
<br/>
Is that something SHE wants to do? If so, just be sure that when she&#39;s ready to move on to something else, you let her move on without any strings attached. The fastest way to squash her interest is to try to force it to continue when she&#39;s ready to move on. Let her take what she wants from the discussion and using the wheelchair, and let it be fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1148538205">Thanks for your reply.  You asked why we are stuck at home.  I explained in my initial question that I run a home daycare.  So, yes we get outside - we actually spend lots of time out there.  We are limited to a small section of the yard that is fenced in, but we make good use of the space.  We follow bugs and build things in the sand box.  She swings on the swings and plays.  After daycare hours I take her outside to garden with me.  Usually she spends that time rolling down the hill near the garden....lol.  I didn&#39;t mean to make it sound like we couldn&#39;t leave the house.  We just feel a bit like caged rats sometimes - lol.  <br/>
<br/>
You are right that I&#39;ve got to adjust my thinking.  My issue with not being able to take spontaneous trips is I guess because I&#39;ve just gotten the idea in my head that following the child in her learning interests would require that we are able to get out in the world and get the information that she seeks when she seeks it.  Not &quot;Well, this Saturday if you are still interested we can take a trip to &lt;insert location&gt; to learn more about that&quot; She&#39;s 6...she doesn&#39;t stay interested in very much long enough to wait.  So, we are missing opportunities.  Using the computer is an option, but she doesn&#39;t have the patients for searching things on the internet.  It&#39;s much more efficient to go to the library a find a book about what we want to know or run to a museum that has an exhibit about it.  So we do use the internet if I&#39;m fairly certain of where to find the info...otherwise she walks away saying &quot;Nevermind&quot;  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...obviously I&#39;ve got lots more thinking to do about this.  Thanks for the link...I&#39;ll check it out.<br/>

&gt; &gt;Here&#39;s the question - My big concern is that we&#39;ll commit to unschooling and then she&#39;ll decide to go back to public school next &gt;year and won&#39;t have learned yet the stuff that she&#39;ll need in order to transition back in. I&#39;m also concerned that I can&#39;t with my &gt;schedule unschool successfully. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you continue to think about things this way it&#39;s just not going to work right, act more as though the school doesn&#39;t exist. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I can&#39;t just up and go to the museum or a library to learn more about something she&#39;s interested in. We can&#39;t go for nature walks &gt;every day. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can you look things up online when you are home? Can you hang out in your backyard? Can you schedule a trip to the library? Can you find television programs and/or movies that are of interest to her? Are you able to engage with her in conversation when you are home?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-807471553">Alora is 6 years old.  My home daycare is not structured in a schoolish way.  We are pretty loosey goosey around here.  The kids eat and nap on a regular schedule but the rest of the day is up in the air.  So, homeschooling the way that we do it is fairly easy around them.  It&#39;s no different really than a large family.  I only have 3 children besides my own enrolled in my daycare.  It works well with homeschooling the way that we do it...and i guess i could figure out how to make it work with unschooling.  So, yes, the daycare would have to take priority over unschooling in that diapers need to be changed, tummies need to be fed and naps need to be had.  Other than that, the daycare kids can do whatever it is that we are doing.  <br/>
<br/>
I do understand that not everything has to be done during my daycare day.  I&#39;m repeating what I wrote in another post now, but I just thought that in order to unschool and follow the child we&#39;d need the freedom to seek out the knowledge that she desires.  Depending on the internet is just not something that will work for us at this point.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks very much for your response.  It&#39;s just going to take some thinking on my part, I guess. At the very least this thread has helped me to refocus my energy.  I do have a somewhat negative attitude about our situation....and if nothing else - that needs to change!<br/>

I used to do childcare when my kids were little and found that was a constant struggle. I had to remind myself all the time that the reason I was doing the childcare was so that I could be home with them. At one point it just got to be too much and I found something else to do...while they were sleeping (web work & graphics) so I could be more attentive to my own children&#39;s needs during the day.<br/>
