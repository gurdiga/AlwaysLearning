Dear Educator, <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Defenders of Wildlife is sponsoring essay and poster contests for  <br/>
<br/>
students in grades 6 though 8 focusing on the gray wolf.  The topic  <br/>
<br/>
of the essay contest is “Protecting Wolves in the United States”  <br/>
<br/>
and the topic of the poster contest is “Wolves in Wild Places.”  The <br/>
<br/>
 goal of the contests is to raise awareness and educate students  <br/>
<br/>
about the plight of the gray wolf in the United States.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Perceived as a threat to livestock, wolves have long been  <br/>
<br/>
persecuted.  Wolves once roamed throughout the lower 48 states,  <br/>
<br/>
but are now found in just a fraction of their former territory.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We would like for your school to participate in the contests.  To  <br/>
<br/>
assist you and your students,  Defenders of Wildlife has created a  <br/>
<br/>
wolf curriculum designed for students in grades 6 through 8.  This  <br/>
<br/>
curriculum is available free of charge on Defenders of Wildlife’s  <br/>
<br/>
website for kids, www.kidsplanet.org under the “Teacher’s Table”  <br/>
<br/>
link.  The curriculum integrates technology, readings and problem  <br/>
<br/>
solving.  Our main website www.defenders.org also contains a  <br/>
<br/>
wealth of information about wolves.    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The deadline for essay and poster submissions is December 31,  <br/>
<br/>
2002.  Contest information and guidelines are available online at <br/>
<br/>
www.kidsplanet.org  Please feel free to photocopy and <br/>
<br/>
distribute the contest flyers found on Kids&#39; Planet.  There will be <br/>
<br/>
first-, second-, and third-place winners with monetary prizes <br/>
<br/>
awarded in the form of savings bonds of $1,000, $500, and<br/>
<br/>
$250 respectively.  If you would like more information, please <br/>
<br/>
contact me via email or by telephone at 202-682-9400.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>

Yowza, what subtle yet overbearing rhetoric.  <br/>
I think it could be fairly translated &quot;Because some ignorant people<br/>
falsely <br/>
believed wolves might kill livestock, the poor innocent wolves have been <br/>
mistreated unfairly.&quot;]***<br/>
<br/>
I agree the wording was designed to stir strong emotion, but for good<br/>
reason.  <br/>
<br/>
From &quot;Our Montana History&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In 1884 the Montana territorial legislature for the first time provided<br/>
for the payment of a bounty on wolves, one dollar for one (dead) wolf. In<br/>
1911 the state offered a $15 bounty on wolves.   In 1933 the bounty<br/>
provision for wolves were removed from the law books, there was simply no<br/>
longer any need for it. Just exactly how many wolves were &quot;harvested&quot; in<br/>
Montana?   In 1884 bounties were paid on 5,450 wolves, in 1885 the number<br/>
was 2,224, in 1886 2,587 -- in all, between 1884 and 1933 Montana paid<br/>
well over $340,000 in bounty money on some 80,000 wolves. Between the<br/>
years of 1850-1920, as part of government policy, over 1.5 million wolves<br/>
were shot, trapped, or poisoned.<br/>
----------------------------------------------------<br/>
Yowza indeed!<br/>
<br/>
Other states had bounty&#39;s too.<br/>
<br/>
There is a picture, and old black and white photo of an agent standing<br/>
next to a pile of wolf skulls.  It&#39;s bigger and taller than you can<br/>
imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago a Wolf pack in the Deer Lodge valley,  the Boulder pack,<br/>
was tracked and killed and the pups clubbed, some left to starve, when a<br/>
rancher lost two calves to wolves.   The Alpha female was a wolf had been<br/>
collared in Banff a few years before.   The rancher was fully compensated<br/>
for his loss, paid market value even.<br/>
<br/>
Montana is still at it today, the killing of wildlife, with legislators<br/>
pushing to end the endangered status of wolves in the pacific northwest<br/>
AND with a 45 million dollar budget over the next 15 years for the<br/>
Montana Department of Livestock to harass and kill Yellowstone Bison who<br/>
wander from the park onto Montana public lands.    The state used 2<br/>
million dollars of taxpayer money last winter to kill 203 Bison. <br/>
<br/>
They claim the threat of brucellosis.   Interestingly, there has never<br/>
been a confirmed case of brucellosis transmission from wild bison.   Wild<br/>
elk population carry brucellosis  too but the DOL isn&#39;t killing them on<br/>
behalf of ranchers because the state of Montana can sell Elk tags and<br/>
make a huge profit off out of state hunters every season.    Calves can<br/>
be vaccinated against brucellosis and no antigen is detectable in the<br/>
blood of mature slaughter animals.      <br/>
<br/>
Rhetoric maybe, but not without reason.   <br/>
And SOMEONE needs to be passionate about injustice in order to effect<br/>
change.   <br/>
<br/>

there were no wolves to be heard.<br/>
