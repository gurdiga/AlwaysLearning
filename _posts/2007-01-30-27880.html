<div id="ygrps-yiv-299286316">Lots of children of all ages do touch and play with themselves,<br/>
without that meaning anything like having been abused. There is the<br/>
potential for them to be abused if someone reads that child as<br/>
&#39;awakened&#39; and assumes they&#39;re ready to engage in an adult conception<br/>
of sexual activity.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the potential for a child who is seen as anything from<br/>
&#39;precocious&#39; to &#39;very sexual&#39; to be disrespectful of other children if<br/>
they haven&#39;t been given information about boundaries and autonomy and<br/>
that others&#39; experiences of themselves may be quite different to their<br/>
own.<br/>
<br/>
The child who is not yet sexual in any way, is almost always not a<br/>
repressed child, they&#39;re just not there yet.<br/>
<br/>
So while I don&#39;t believe sex to be a bad thing, it&#39;s also not always a<br/>
good thing for everyone, of every age in all contexts.<br/>
<br/>
For another bad analogy, if a child enjoys a sip or mouthful of beer,<br/>
do we then give them a six-pack or two, on the assumption they&#39;re<br/>
ready for that? <br/>

You seem to have a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to this subject, if you don&#39;t<br/>
mind my saying...talked about being mad, and impatient...what&#39;s that about?<br/>
So far I&#39;ve only read suggestions from unschoolers, mostly long-time<br/>
unschoolers, about discerning &quot;junk&quot; from reality, paying attention to<br/>
warning signs, keeping an open mind and open communication, being careful of<br/>
kids you don&#39;t know much about if something seems off, listening to and<br/>
respecting children...what there to be mad and impatient about?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious,<br/>

It&#39;s  okay not to analyze someone&#39;s unusual response or to demand  <br/>
answers.  Maybe some answers we don&#39;t want.  Seriously.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions that help people get to a peaceful unschooling place are  <br/>
good.<br/>

We don&#39;t need to know too much about individuals&#39; prejudices and  <br/>

about, but it was a good point if intended as a suggestion that she  <br/>
might want to consider the question, for herself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857717252">Hi Jacki. I don&#39;t mind answering your questions, though I think I&#39;ve<br/>
addressed one or two things already... I&#39;m aware, too, that this topic<br/>

&gt; Jo, I&#39;m just wondering what this sentence is connected to in this<br/>
 </span></blockquote>thread.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was about this, really &quot;There is the potential for them to be<br/>
abused if someone reads that child as &#39;awakened&#39; and assumes they&#39;re<br/>
ready to engage in an adult conception of sexual activity.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The ideas, in the broader culture that there&#39;s something either wrong<br/>
or adult about anything that resembles sexual expression/activity in<br/>
children. I could be more explicit, but am feeling uncomfortable out<br/>
of consideration for others, about doing that publicly.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. You&#39;re right there. But, in throwing around ideas I, and others,<br/>
moved beyond any specific. So that the cultural and social waters we<br/>
are all swimming in became part of what was being talked about, part<br/>
of what informs the discussions. Our culture, Western culture, is<br/>
pretty much sex saturated nowadays, and as a mother I&#39;ve felt like I<br/>
needed to find ways to help my daughter navigate that. I&#39;m not<br/>
convinced that the saturation that passes for liberation is, in fact,<br/>
anything like what I&#39;d identify as real liberation. <br/>
<br/>
For instance, the sexualisation of ever younger children seems wrong<br/>
to me. The idea that&#39;s out there, in the broader culture that<br/>
liberation means anything-goes, including those who think that<br/>
children should be liberated from the bonds of taboos against sexual<br/>
activity between adults and children. <br/>
<br/>
My interest in this area is informal, and springs largely from being a<br/>
mother. In criticising what I see in the broader culture, I&#39;ve<br/>
endeavoured to educate myself and form some picture of what would sit<br/>
better with me than a lot of what we have, so I&#39;ve read quite a lot<br/>
about sexuality, and talked with people who know more than I,<br/>
including some who work in the area of sexual abuse - one woman stands<br/>
out in my mind because she chose her work because of startlingly bad<br/>
experiences she&#39;d had as a child.   <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You seem to have a bit of a knee-jerk reaction to this subject, if<br/>

impatient...what&#39;s that about?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I explained that, and apologised for it, perhaps not well.<br/>
Again, I got worked up in my head about something that angers me, the<br/>
abuse of children and those who would and have moved to justify that,<br/>
in the broader culture, then projected some ill feeling into the thread.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So far I&#39;ve only read suggestions from unschoolers, mostly long-time<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There wasn&#39;t anything in the thread for me to be mad and impatient<br/>
about; there were lots of good, helpful, useful things said. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s lots outside the thread, in the broader culture, to be mad and<br/>
impatient about, I think. Unfortunately, I brought some of that here,<br/>
briefly, in an unhelpful way, which I hope doesn&#39;t negate anything<br/>
useful I said.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t say at ALL that that is becoming justified in the broader  <br/>
culture. People are more and more aware of the harm that sexual abuse  <br/>
does to children, these days.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There have been commentators, apart from NAMBLA, who did and still do<br/>
get airplay in some circles. Their arguments are eloquent and can seem<br/>
to make a whole lot of sense, so that it can become difficult in the<br/>
face of them to say &quot;that&#39;s just WRONG!&quot; if the *why* it&#39;s wrong can&#39;t<br/>
be clearly articulated. I had felt the need, in my own life, to get<br/>
really clear about the why.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s probably never going to come up in most everyone&#39;s life, raising<br/>
their children, but I guess I thought it important enough to spout on<br/>
about here. <br/>
<br/>
I would so rather be reading about Spongebob and Spearows and such. K,<br/>
13, has a Spongebob t-shirt, scored from our favourite secondhand<br/>
place a few years ago, that she still often wears. He&#39;s such a great<br/>
character, across many ages, and times too, I should think.   <br/>
<br/>
I want to apologise here, too, to Crystal especially and everyone who<br/>
reads, for having lost the plot a bit a couple of days ago. After I<br/>
responded to Jacki yesterday, I went back and re-read where I&#39;d posted<br/>
weirdly, to say the least, to Crystal, and was shocked by the tone and<br/>
the actual words in at least a couple of sentences I&#39;d written. There<br/>
were words there that had leapt straight out of my subconscious, that<br/>
I didn&#39;t even remember writing, that were about and for a whole other<br/>
situation and person that is/has been being a stressor in my life. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s never happened to me before. I hadn&#39;t thought that sitch was<br/>
bothering me much until I saw that it was clearly leaking out of me in<br/>
the most inappropriate way. I spent a mortified day trying to begin to<br/>
get my head straight about all that. Read some Daily Groove to help<br/>
centre myself, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry for being so scary (quite out of character) and thank<br/>
various of you, especially Crystal, for your generosity.<br/>
