<div id="ygrps-yiv-876971144">I have an unschooled teenager story of moral character to share.  My dd went<br/>
to a sleepover party with ten girls.  They had fun and played some pranks,<br/>
most of which were harmless.  One of the pranks ended up not being quite so<br/>
harmless however, and my dd was right in the middle of it, though several of<br/>
the girls were involved.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 It involved a prank phone call that was not very nice to a girl that some<br/>
of the other girls at the party knew, but that my dd did not know. (this was<br/>
the first time she had met two of the girls who go to an expensive private<br/>
school) Unbeknownst to my dd, the reason for the call was based in jealousy<br/>
and the unkindness was not a joke.  The girl who received the prank call,<br/>
which was mean,  but was not threatening in any way, had previously received<br/>
a threatening call from another group of girls, which included a girl at<br/>
this party; the girl whose idea it was to make the call. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when it all shook out, the mom of the girl who receive the prank<br/>
call, called the home where the party was, and threatened to call the police<br/>
and the host of the party called the parents of all the kids at the party.<br/>
It was the morning after the sleepover.  When I arrived the house was full<br/>
of crying teenagers and upset parents.  When the host mom asked who had made<br/>
the call, my dd immediately spoke up and took the blame.  The host mom knew<br/>
that my dd did not know the girl who was called but that some other girls<br/>
did.  My daughter was the ONLY girl who spoke up and took the blame for the<br/>
incident even when put under a fair amount of pressure.  The other few girls<br/>
that were directly involved looked ridiculous while trying to avoid the<br/>
blame. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The parents were all upset and didn&#39;t seem to know what to do so I took it<br/>
into my own hands and asked for a phone and a private place to make a call.<br/>
My dd and I called the family and talked at length with the girl who<br/>
received the call and her mom.  They accepted my dd&#39;s apology and were very<br/>
gracious.  They understood that my dd got caught up in the moment and that<br/>
she was not behind the meanness that was intended.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We did what we could to make it right and we both felt better after talking<br/>
with the daughter and the mom.  The police were not called, though I was not<br/>
worried if they had been.  I have to say I wondered how the parents of my<br/>
kids&#39; friends would react once it all shook out and my daughter was the one<br/>
at fault for executing the plan.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To my surprise, they (the two moms whose opinions I care about) were very<br/>
pleased with my dd because she was honest and forthright when confronted.<br/>
They did not place the blame solely on my dd and in fact, they felt that<br/>
more of the blame was lying in the lap of the girl whose idea it was in the<br/>
first place.  I was very pleased that in the end they only saw the good<br/>
moral character of my dd shining forth and they have been great about<br/>
letting our kids hang out together since then. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1208240625">Angela, that&#39;s a great story.  Can I save it in the teens section  <br/>
(somewhere linked to and from when Holly fell in chocolate pudding and  <br/>
not smelling quite as rosy?)<br/>

Thank you, Angela.<br/>

confidence when the need more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-156124303">I forgot to mention, that the host mom called me later that day after she<br/>
had had time to think about it more and she called to tell me that there<br/>
were no hard feelings and that she was actually really proud of my daughter<br/>
for having the integrity to stand up and say she was involved and that she<br/>
was sorry. She told me she was glad that her dd had a friend like that.   It<br/>
ended better than I could have hoped for.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Plus, on the way over, I sort of threatened my husband to not say anything<br/>
negative to my dd because I know her well enough to know that she would<br/>
already be beating herself up over her bad choice.  I was so proud of him;<br/>
when we got home he gave her a big hug and told her he was proud of her for<br/>
handling it so well.  My dd announced at that point that she was never going<br/>
to make a crank call again.  She definitely learned a lesson or two from<br/>
that experience.  (and one was not to trust people you don&#39;t know)<br/>
