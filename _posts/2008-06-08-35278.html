<div id="ygrps-yiv-756918109">-=-  I have had to impose limits on some things as her freedom was  <br/>
too much for me to deal<br/>
with.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That was in e-mail.  The mom did concede that she didnt&#39; &quot;have  <br/>
to&quot;impose limits, that she was choosing to, but she insisted she did  <br/>
have to maintain her comfort level.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the Day Farenga quote from when she spoke in Florida?  It  <br/>
reminds me of that.  That unschooling was allowing as much freedom as  <br/>
the parent was comfortable with, or something.<br/>
<br/>
I propose that parents either put their children in school, if  <br/>
unschooling is too uncomfortable, or get a curriculum, or to stretch  <br/>
their own comfort zone for the sake of their children.<br/>

I think this is the quote you were thinking of.   I agree with you <br/>
that it is possible to make the choice to stretch your own comfort <br/>
zone.  I am continually challenged by Liz to get comfortable with my <br/>
discomfort.  I also choose to challenge myself.  It is not natural <br/>
or easy for me yet but I am ok with being uncomfortable until it <br/>
becomes easier.<br/>

See, this is the kind of thing that makes those of us new to unschooling<br/>
really frustrated to hear.  It makes me feel like if I can&#39;t do it right,<br/>
then I might as well give up and put them back in school.<br/>
<br/>
There is a such thing as balance.  If I choose to impose some limits because<br/>
I&#39;m uncomfortable, that doesn&#39;t mean school or a curriculum is better.  It<br/>
just means I&#39;m still on my journey.<br/>

unschoolers except for _____&quot; - it is journey and no one said just <br/>
give up everything all at once you should go slowly but not stop <br/>
when you hit something you are uncomfortable letting go of but <br/>
examine it and work through it<br/>

But his list exists to help you just do it right from the beginning.<br/>

<br/>
Hurry up with your journey, because your children get older every  <br/>
day.   Limitations involve recovery.<br/>
<br/>
Read these things before you stretch and decide balance and a  <br/>
leisurely journey are just as good as facing your discomfort for the  <br/>
sake of your child now.<br/>

I&#39;m not a salesman.  I don&#39;t make money when you decide to unschool.   <br/>
I&#39;d rather put your writings on the &quot;getting it&quot; page than the &quot;if  <br/>
only&quot; page, down the line.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is the kind of thing that makes those of us new to  <br/>

<br/>
I would rather help some frustrated moms to keep their kids from  <br/>
being frustrated than to soothe some moms so they&#39;ll feel better  <br/>
about frustrating their kids.  But those aren&#39;t the only two  <br/>
choices.  If you see yourself as your child&#39;s partner, neither of you  <br/>
will have to be frustrated.  This list can help.<br/>
<br/>
This list isn&#39;t intended to help you feel better about imposing  <br/>
arbitrary limitations.<br/>

Very true.<br/>
<br/>
Every step towards freedom is a step towards joy and &quot;balance&quot;.:) I<br/>
think the important thing is to recognize how totally brainwashed we<br/>
get through our own schooling and raising. Figuring out how to shift<br/>
into a whole new paradigm is not always easy, but worth the struggle.<br/>
<br/>
Question everything, even your own limits.<br/>
