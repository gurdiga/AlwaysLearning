<div id="ygrps-yiv-414737416">I was talking to a friend of mine today.  She is a homeschooler, eclectic, I would say if you had to clasify her.  She has 2 kids, ages 5 and 7 and has been doing structured stuff with them for a couple years.  <br/>
Today, we were talking and she expressed how guilty she has been feeling because she hasnt done anything that she would classify as schoolish in a month.  I asked her what they had been doing, and besides several lessons like a writing workshop and piano it was basically playing, at home or the park. She said the kids have loved it and often complain normally about not have time to do things they want to do. She described her day yesterday morning, they took a trip to see their pony at the stables.  The kids got to clean out some stables and they bathed a pony that doesnt get visited often, pet barn cats.. things like that.  She said she has no doubt the kids are having a great time but she wonders if they are learning anything.  In her next sentence though she talked about how her daughter loves this kind of thing and how much it does for her self esteem.<br/>
I tried to encourage her not to worry about if they were learning academics or not and just really enjoy those kinds of opportunities.<br/>
I was just curious if any of you would have words of wisdom for someone in that situation.</div>
