The Harmful Effects Of<br/>
Sugar On Mind And Body<br/>
Macrobiotics.co.uk<br/>
12-1-3<br/>
<br/>
        Of all the foods consumed today, refined <br/>
sugar is considered to be one of the most harmful. <br/>
<br/>
...In 1997 Americans devoured 7.3 billion pounds of<br/>
candy. Americans spent an estimated $23.1 billion <br/>
dollars on candy and gum. The average American consumed <br/>
a record 27.3 pounds of candy and gum in the same <br/>
year-the equivalent of about six regular sized chocolate <br/>
bars a week-marking the fifth consecutive year of <br/>
increased demand. (1)<br/>
<br/>
...Consumption of processed foods (which are laced <br/>
with sugar) cost the American public more than $54 <br/>
billion in dental bills each year, so the dental <br/>
industry reaps huge profits from the programmed <br/>
addiction of the public to sugar products. <br/>
<br/>
...Today we have a nation that is addicted to<br/>
sugar. In 1915, the national average of sugar <br/>
consumption (per year) was around 15 to 20 pounds <br/>
per person. Today the average person consumes his/her<br/>
weight in sugar, plus over 20 pounds of corn syrup. To <br/>
add more horrors to these facts there are some people <br/>
that use no sweets and some who use much less than the <br/>
average figure, which means that there is a percentage <br/>
of the population that consume a great deal more refined<br/>
sugar than their body weight. The human body cannot <br/>
tolerate this large amount of refined carbohydrates. <br/>
The vital organs in the body are actually damaged by this<br/>
gross intake of sugar.<br/>
<br/>
...Refined sugar contains no fiber, no minerals, no <br/>
proteins, no fats, no enzymes, only empty calories. What <br/>
happens when you eat a refined carbohydrate like sugar? <br/>
Your body must borrow vital nutrients from healthy<br/>
cells to metabolize the incomplete food. Calcium, <br/>
sodium, potassium and magnesium are taken from various <br/>
parts of the body to make use of the sugar.<br/>
<br/>
        Many times, so much calcium is used to neutralize <br/>
the effects of sugar that the bones become osteoporotic <br/>
due to the withdrawn calcium. Likewise, the teeth are <br/>
affected and they lose their components until decay occurs <br/>
and hastens their loss. ...Refined sugar is void of all <br/>
nutrients, consequently it causes the body to deplete its <br/>
own stores of various vitamins, minerals and enzymes. <br/>
If sugar consumption is continued, an over-acid condition <br/>
results, and more minerals are needed from deep in the<br/>
body to correct the imbalance. If the body is lacking the <br/>
nutrients used to metabolize sugar, it will not be able <br/>
to properly handle and rid itself of the poisonous <br/>
residues. <br/>
These wastes accumulate through the brain and nervous <br/>
system, <br/>
which speeds up cellular death. The bloodstream becomes<br/>
over-loaded with waste products and symptoms of carbonic <br/>
poisoning result.<br/>
<br/>
...Sugar also makes the blood very thick and sticky, <br/>
inhibiting much of the blood flow into the minute <br/>
capillaries <br/>
that supply our gums and teeth with vital nutrients. <br/>
Therefore, we wind up with diseased gums and starving <br/>
teeth. <br/>
America and England, the two largest sugar consumers, have <br/>
horrendous dental problems.<br/>
<br/>
...In 1948, a $57,000 ten-year study was awarded to Harvard<br/>
University by the Sugar Research Foundation to find out how <br/>
sugar causes cavities in teeth and how to prevent it. In <br/>
1958, <br/>
Time magazine reported the findings, which were reported in <br/>
the Dental Association Journal. They discovered there was <br/>
no <br/>
way to prevent the problem and their funding immediately <br/>
disappeared.<br/>
<br/>
...&quot;The most significant human study was done in Sweden, <br/>
reported in 1954, and known as the Vipeholm Dental Caries <br/>
Study. More than 400 adult mental patients were placed on <br/>
controlled diets and observed for five years. The subjects <br/>
were divided into various groups. Some ate complex and <br/>
simple<br/>
carbohydrates at mealtimes only, while other supplemented <br/>
mealtime food with between-meal-snacks, sweetened with <br/>
sucrose, chocolate, caramel, or toffee. Among the <br/>
conclusions <br/>
drawn from the study, was that sucrose consumption<br/>
could increase caries activity. The risk increased if <br/>
the sucrose was consumed in a sticky form that adhered to <br/>
the tooth&#39;s surfaces. The greatest damage was inflicted by <br/>
foods with high concentrations of sucrose, in sticky form, <br/>
eaten between meals, even if contact with the tooth&#39;s <br/>
surfaces was brief. Caries, due to the intake of foods <br/>
with high sucrose levels, could be decreased when such <br/>
offending foods were eliminated from the diet. But <br/>
individual <br/>
differences existed, and in some cases, caries continued to<br/>
appear despite avoidance of refined sugar or maximum <br/>
restriction of natural sugars and total dietary <br/>
carbohydrates.&quot; <br/>
(2)<br/>
<br/>
...Diabetes is another commonly known disease caused by <br/>
sugar as well as a high fat diet. Diabetes is caused by the <br/>
failure of the pancreas to produce adequate insulin when <br/>
the blood sugar rises. A concentrated amount of sugar <br/>
introduced <br/>
into the system sends the body into shock from the rapid <br/>
rise <br/>
in the blood sugar level. The pancreas eventually wears out<br/>
from overwork and diabetes then rears its ugly head.<br/>
<br/>
...Hypoglycemia occurs when the pancreas overreacts to the <br/>
large<br/>
amount of sugar in the blood and releases too much insulin <br/>
leaving <br/>
one with the &quot;tired&quot; feeling as the blood sugar level <br/>
becomes <br/>
lower than it should be.<br/>
<br/>
...&quot;A recent article in the British Medical Journal, <br/>
entitled <br/>
The Sweet Road to Gallstones, reported that refined sugar <br/>
may <br/>
be one of the major dietary risk factors in gallstone <br/>
disease. <br/>
Gallstones are composed of fats and calcium. Sugar can <br/>
upset <br/>
all of the minerals, and one of the minerals, calcium, can <br/>
become toxic or nonfunctioning, depositing itself anywhere <br/>
in<br/>
the body, including the gallbladder.<br/>
<br/>
...&quot;One out of ten Americans has gallstones. This risk <br/>
increases to<br/>
one out of every five after age forty. Gallstones may go <br/>
unnoticed <br/>
or may cause pain-wrenching pain. Other symptoms might <br/>
include <br/>
bloating, belching, and intolerance to foods.&quot; (3) <br/>
<br/>
...Another serious problem with sugar that is<br/>
now coming to the forefront is the various levels of mental <br/>
problems. Our brains are very sensitive and react to quick <br/>
chemical changes within the body. As sugar is consumed, our <br/>
cells are robbed of their B vitamin, which destroys them, <br/>
and <br/>
insulin production is inhibited. Low insulin production <br/>
means a <br/>
high sugar (glucose) level in the bloodstream, which can <br/>
lead to a<br/>
confused mental state or unsound mind, and has also been <br/>
linked <br/>
with juvenile criminal behavior. Dr. Alexander G. Schauss, <br/>
brings <br/>
this solemn fact out in his book, Diet, Crime and <br/>
Delinquency. <br/>
Many mental ward and prison inmates are &quot;sugarholics&quot; and <br/>
erratic <br/>
emotional outbreaks often follow a sugar binge.<br/>
<br/>
REFINED SUGAR-A DRUG?<br/>
<br/>
...Refined sugar, by some, is called a drug, because in the <br/>
refining<br/>
process everything of food value has been removed except <br/>
the<br/>
carbohydrates-pure calories, without vitamins, minerals, <br/>
proteins, <br/>
fats, enzymes or any of the other elements that make up <br/>
food. Many <br/>
nutrition experts say that white sugar is extremely <br/>
harmful, possibly <br/>
as harmful as a drug, especially in the quantities consumed <br/>
by the <br/>
present-day American.<br/>
<br/>
...Dr. David Reuben, author of Everything You Always Wanted <br/>
to Know<br/>
About Nutrition says, &quot;.white refined sugar-is not a food. <br/>
It is a <br/>
pure chemical extracted from plant sources, purer in fact <br/>
than <br/>
cocaine, which it resembles in many ways. Its true name is <br/>
sucrose <br/>
and its chemical formula is C12H22O11. It has 12 carbon <br/>
atoms, <br/>
22 hydrogen atoms, 11 oxygen atoms, and absolutely nothing <br/>
else to <br/>
offer.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
...The chemical formula for cocaine is C17H21NO4. Sugar&#39;s <br/>
formula <br/>
again is C12H22O11. For all practical purposes, the <br/>
difference is <br/>
that sugar is missing the &quot;N&quot;, or nitrogen atom.<br/>
<br/>
...Refining means to make &quot;pure&quot; by a process of extraction <br/>
or<br/>
separation. Sugars are refined by taking a natural food, <br/>
which <br/>
contains a high percentage of sugar, and then removing all <br/>
elements of that food until only the sugar remains. <br/>
<br/>
...While sugar is commonly made from sugar cane or<br/>
sugar beets. Through heating and mechanical and chemical <br/>
processing, all vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, enzymes <br/>
and indeed every nutrient is removed until only the sugar <br/>
remains. Sugar cane and sugar beets are first harvested and <br/>
then chopped into small pieces, squeezing out the juice, <br/>
which<br/>
is then mixed with water. This liquid is then heated, and <br/>
lime <br/>
is added. Moisture is boiled away, and the remaining fluid <br/>
is <br/>
pumped into vacuum pans to concentrate the juice. By this <br/>
time, <br/>
the liquid is starting to crystallize, and is ready to be <br/>
placed <br/>
into a centrifuge machine where any remaining residues <br/>
(like <br/>
molasses) are spun away. The crystals are then dissolved by <br/>
heating to the boiling point and passed through charcoal <br/>
filters. After the crystals condense, they are bleached <br/>
snow-white usually by the use of pork or cattle bones.<br/>
<br/>
...During the refining process, 64 food elements are <br/>
destroyed. <br/>
All the potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, manganese, <br/>
phosphate, <br/>
and sulfate are removed. The A, D, and B, vitamins are <br/>
destroyed. <br/>
Amino acids, vital enzymes, unsaturated fats, and all fiber <br/>
are <br/>
gone. To a lesser or greater degree, all refined sweeteners <br/>
such as corn syrup, maple syrup, etc., undergo similar <br/>
destructive <br/>
processes. Molasses is the chemical and deranged nutrients <br/>
that <br/>
is a byproduct of sugar manufacture. <br/>
<br/>
...Sugar manufacturers are aggressive in defending their <br/>
product <br/>
and have a strong political lobby which allows them to <br/>
continue <br/>
selling a deadly food item that by all reason should not be <br/>
allowed in the American diet. <br/>
<br/>
...If you have any doubts as to the detriments of sugar <br/>
(sucrose), <br/>
try leaving it out of your diet for several weeks and see <br/>
if it <br/>
makes a difference! You may also notice you have acquired <br/>
an <br/>
addiction and experience some withdrawal symptoms. <br/>
<br/>
...Studies show that &quot;sugar&quot; is just as habit-forming as <br/>
any <br/>
narcotic; and its use, misuse, and abuse is our nation&#39;s <br/>
number <br/>
one disaster. It is no wonder when we consider all the <br/>
products <br/>
we consume daily which are loaded with sugar! The average <br/>
healthy <br/>
digestive system can digest and eliminate from two to four <br/>
teaspoons of sugar daily, usually without noticeable <br/>
problems, <br/>
(that is if damage is not already present). One 12 oz. Cola <br/>
contains 11 teaspoons of sugar, and that&#39;s aside from the <br/>
caffeine. <br/>
It&#39;s the sugar that gives you quick energy, but only for a <br/>
brief <br/>
time due to the rise of the blood sugar level. But the body <br/>
quickly releases a rush of insulin, which rapidly lowers <br/>
the blood <br/>
sugar and causes a significant drop in energy and <br/>
endurance. It is<br/>
easy to see why America&#39;s health is in serious trouble.<br/>
<br/>
EFFECT OF SUGAR ON NEUROLOGICAL PROCESSES <br/>
...One of the keys to orderly brain function is glutamic <br/>
acid, and this compound is found in many vegetables. When <br/>
sugar <br/>
is consumed, the bacteria in the intestines, which <br/>
manufacture <br/>
B vitamin complexes, begin to die-these bacteria normally <br/>
thrive<br/>
in a symbiotic relationship with the human body. When the <br/>
B vitamin complex level declines, the glutamic acid <br/>
(normally <br/>
transformed into &quot;go&quot; &quot;no-go&quot; directive neural enzymes by <br/>
the <br/>
B vitamins) is not processed and sleepiness occurs, as well <br/>
as <br/>
a decreased ability for short-term memory function and <br/>
numerical<br/>
calculative abilities. The removal of B vitamins when foods <br/>
are<br/>
&quot;processed&quot; makes the situation even more tenuous.<br/>
<br/>
WHAT ABOUT GUM CHEWING? <br/>
...Besides the sugar in gum being damaging<br/>
to the teeth there is another harmful problem to consider <br/>
and that is: &quot;teeth and jaws weren&#39;t designed for more than <br/>
a <br/>
few minutes of solid chewing per day-far less than the two <br/>
hours clocked in daily by hardcore gum chewers. All this <br/>
chewing results in inordinate wear on the jawbone, gum <br/>
tissue <br/>
and lower molars, and can change the alignment of the jaws&quot; <br/>
says<br/>
Michael Elsohn, D.D.S., in the Medical Tribune.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-524776256">This was a very telling article and things that I think we already know just <br/>
don&#39;t want to acknowledge.  My question is though:  What do we eat?<br/>
<br/>
Eating too many unrefined carbs is bad, but we can no longer go the Atkins <br/>
route since we have all learned over the last week how bad the oversight is of <br/>
our beef and other meat supply.  (Why would you test an animal AFTER you have <br/>
sent it into the food supply?)<br/>

&gt;....Refining means to make &quot;pure&quot; by a process of extraction <br/>
&gt;or<br/>
&gt;separation. Sugars are refined by taking a natural food, <br/>
&gt;which <br/>
&gt;contains a high percentage of sugar, and then removing all <br/>
&gt;elements of that food until only the sugar remains. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;....While sugar is commonly made from sugar cane or<br/>
&gt;sugar beets. Through heating and mechanical and chemical <br/>
&gt;processing, all vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, enzymes <br/>
&gt;and indeed every nutrient is removed until only the sugar <br/>
&gt;remains. Sugar cane and sugar beets are first harvested and <br/>
&gt;then chopped into small pieces, squeezing out the juice, <br/>
&gt;which<br/>
&gt;is then mixed with water. This liquid is then heated, and <br/>
&gt;lime <br/>
&gt;is added. Moisture is boiled away, and the remaining fluid <br/>
&gt;is <br/>
&gt;pumped into vacuum pans to concentrate the juice. By this <br/>
&gt;time, <br/>
&gt;the liquid is starting to crystallize, and is ready to be <br/>
&gt;placed <br/>
&gt;into a centrifuge machine where any remaining residues <br/>
&gt;(like <br/>
&gt;molasses) are spun away. The crystals are then dissolved by <br/>
&gt;heating to the boiling point and passed through charcoal <br/>
&gt;filters. After the crystals condense, they are bleached <br/>
&gt;snow-white usually by the use of pork or cattle bones.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;....During the refining process, 64 food elements are <br/>
&gt;destroyed. <br/>
&gt;All the potassium, magnesium, calcium, iron, manganese, <br/>
&gt;phosphate, <br/>
&gt;and sulfate are removed. The A, D, and B, vitamins are <br/>
&gt;destroyed. <br/>
&gt;Amino acids, vital enzymes, unsaturated fats, and all fiber <br/>
&gt;are <br/>
&gt;gone. To a lesser or greater degree, all refined sweeteners <br/>
&gt;such as corn syrup, maple syrup, etc., undergo similar <br/>
&gt;destructive <br/>
&gt;processes. Molasses is the chemical and deranged nutrients <br/>
&gt;that <br/>
&gt;is a byproduct of sugar manufacture. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;....Sugar manufacturers are aggressive in defending their <br/>
&gt;product <br/>
&gt;and have a strong political lobby which allows them to <br/>
&gt;continue <br/>
&gt;selling a deadly food item that by all reason should not be <br/>
&gt;allowed in the American diet. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;....If you have any doubts as to the detriments of sugar <br/>
&gt;(sucrose), <br/>
&gt;try leaving it out of your diet for several weeks and see <br/>
&gt;if it <br/>
&gt;makes a difference! You may also notice you have acquired <br/>
&gt;an <br/>
&gt;addiction and experience some withdrawal symptoms. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;....Studies show that &quot;sugar&quot; is just as habit-forming as <br/>
&gt;any <br/>
&gt;narcotic; and its use, misuse, and abuse is our nation&#39;s <br/>
&gt;number <br/>
&gt;one disaster. It is no wonder when we consider all the <br/>
&gt;products <br/>
&gt;we consume daily which are loaded with sugar! The average <br/>
&gt;healthy <br/>
&gt;digestive system can digest and eliminate from two to four <br/>
&gt;teaspoons of sugar daily, usually without noticeable <br/>
&gt;problems, <br/>
&gt;(that is if damage is not already present). One 12 oz. Cola <br/>
&gt;contains 11 teaspoons of sugar, and that&#39;s aside from the <br/>
&gt;caffeine. <br/>
&gt;It&#39;s the sugar that gives you quick energy, but only for a <br/>
&gt;brief <br/>
&gt;time due to the rise of the blood sugar level. But the body <br/>
&gt;quickly releases a rush of insulin, which rapidly lowers <br/>
&gt;the blood <br/>
&gt;sugar and causes a significant drop in energy and <br/>
&gt;endurance. It is<br/>
&gt;easy to see why America&#39;s health is in serious trouble.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;EFFECT OF SUGAR ON NEUROLOGICAL PROCESSES <br/>
&gt;....One of the keys to orderly brain function is glutamic <br/>
&gt;acid, and this compound is found in many vegetables. When <br/>
&gt;sugar <br/>
&gt;is consumed, the bacteria in the intestines, which <br/>
&gt;manufacture <br/>
&gt;B vitamin complexes, begin to die-these bacteria normally <br/>
&gt;thrive<br/>
&gt;in a symbiotic relationship with the human body. When the <br/>
&gt;B vitamin complex level declines, the glutamic acid <br/>
&gt;(normally <br/>
&gt;transformed into &quot;go&quot; &quot;no-go&quot; directive neural enzymes by <br/>
&gt;the <br/>
&gt;B vitamins) is not processed and sleepiness occurs, as well <br/>
&gt;as <br/>
&gt;a decreased ability for short-term memory function and <br/>
&gt;numerical<br/>
&gt;calculative abilities. The removal of B vitamins when foods <br/>
&gt;are<br/>
&gt;&quot;processed&quot; makes the situation even more tenuous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;WHAT ABOUT GUM CHEWING? <br/>
&gt;....Besides the sugar in gum being damaging<br/>
&gt;to the teeth there is another harmful problem to consider <br/>
&gt;and that is: &quot;teeth and jaws weren&#39;t designed for more than <br/>
&gt;a <br/>
&gt;few minutes of solid chewing per day-far less than the two <br/>
&gt;hours clocked in daily by hardcore gum chewers. All this <br/>
&gt;chewing results in inordinate wear on the jawbone, gum <br/>
&gt;tissue <br/>
&gt;and lower molars, and can change the alignment of the jaws&quot; <br/>
&gt;says<br/>
&gt;Michael Elsohn, D.D.S., in the Medical Tribune.<br/>

&lt;&lt;  If the body is lacking the <br/>
<br/>
nutrients used to metabolize sugar, it will not be able <br/>
<br/>
to properly handle and rid itself of the poisonous <br/>
<br/>
residues.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s if other foods weren&#39;t also being eaten--those two paragraphs were <br/>
what if one ate nothing BUT sugar alone.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But <br/>
<br/>
individual <br/>
<br/>
differences existed, and in some cases, caries continued to<br/>
<br/>
appear despite avoidance of refined sugar or maximum <br/>
<br/>
restriction of natural sugars and total dietary <br/>
<br/>
carbohydrates.&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because it&#39;s a bacterial infection, a contagious disease.  It&#39;s not caused by <br/>
sugar.  Once  a person has it, it feeds on sugar, but it&#39;s not caused by the <br/>
sugar.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a condition in Egypt (maybe it&#39;s being overcome, maybe not) of a <br/>
parasite which causes men to pee red, because there&#39;s a little blood in their <br/>
urine. It doesn&#39;t kill them, it just makes them think peeing red is normal.   It&#39;s <br/>
not their diet, it&#39;s that those around them have it and it spreads from <br/>
person to person from close daily living.   (Likely the women have it too and pee <br/>
red, but the report came from public urinal experiences where people thought <br/>
there was something wrong with the American who was peeing clearish yellow.   <br/>
Guys there were peeing off boats and in gutters in addition to urinals, so he <br/>
saw lots of them, all reddish.  And lots saw him and some commented.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...&quot;One out of ten Americans has gallstones. This risk <br/>
<br/>
increases to<br/>
<br/>
one out of every five after age forty. Gallstones may go <br/>
<br/>
unnoticed <br/>
<br/>
or may cause pain-wrenching pain. Other symptoms might <br/>
<br/>
include <br/>
<br/>
bloating, belching, and intolerance to foods.&quot; (3) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A natural cure/treatment for gallstones involves massive amounts of cherry <br/>
juice.  Doesn&#39;t that have sugar in it?  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;white refined sugar-is not a food. <br/>
<br/>
It is a <br/>
<br/>
pure chemical extracted from plant sources, purer in fact <br/>
<br/>
than <br/>
<br/>
cocaine, which it resembles in many ways&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s quite propaganda-leaning, don&#39;t you think?<br/>
Sensationalist?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...The chemical formula for cocaine is C17H21NO4. Sugar&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
formula <br/>
<br/>
again is C12H22O11. For all practical purposes, the <br/>
<br/>
difference is <br/>
<br/>
that sugar is missing the &quot;N&quot;, or nitrogen atom.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Then Nitrous Oxide is just almost like air.<br/>
Air is almost like Nitrous Oxide.<br/>
We shouldn&#39;t breathe air?<br/>
<br/>
Using isotopes of hydrogen instead of straight hydrogen in water molecule <br/>
makes heavy water, and people had better not drink that.  Same structure, totally <br/>
different matter.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;...Consumption of processed foods (which are laced <br/>
<br/>
with sugar) cost the American public more than $54 <br/>
<br/>
billion in dental bills each year, so the dental <br/>
<br/>
industry reaps huge profits from the programmed <br/>
<br/>
addiction of the public to sugar products. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tons of people go to the dentist twice a year for check-ups and cleanings <br/>
even if they have nothing wrong with them because of the press in this culture to <br/>
get regular medical check-ups.  Dentists push treatments and x-rays that have <br/>
nothing to do with sugar, but have to do with them maintaining the jobs they <br/>
had to go to school so long to learn, and then they dispense such wise <br/>
&quot;truths&quot; as dental caries has no contagious component (regardless of that having been <br/>
in dental journals--they don&#39;t have to read anymore once they&#39;re licensed) <br/>
and that nursing babies to sleep will make their teeth rot.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Today the average person consumes his/her<br/>
<br/>
weight in sugar, plus over 20 pounds of corn syrup. To <br/>
<br/>
add more horrors to these facts there are some people <br/>
<br/>
that use no sweets and some who use much less than the <br/>
<br/>
average figure, which means that there is a percentage <br/>
<br/>
of the population that consume a great deal more refined<br/>
<br/>
sugar than their body weight.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a pretty spurious point, but fast-food places throw sugar packets in <br/>
whenever people drink coffee, and ketchup in (which has sugar) when people <br/>
order any potato thing whatsoever here, and they generally won&#39;t take those back. <br/>
 A lot of that measured-per-capita sugar is going in the trash.<br/>
<br/>
Not so spurious:  any &quot;THE SKY IS FALLING&quot; propaganda should be looked at c<br/>
ritically.<br/>
<br/>
One book blamed every historical ill on sugar, and a critic wrote this:  &quot; <br/>
His logic is also seriously flawed. For example, he claims that because the <br/>
Plague struck city dwellers (who consumed more sugar) instead of country dwellers <br/>
(who consumed less sugar), ones consumption of sugar made one more susceptible <br/>
to the Plague. He completely ignores the fact that the Plague was caused by <br/>
fleas on rats who flourished in the crowded, unsanitary cities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think if people are concerned, they should go and read five or a dozen <br/>
different things, and not just get excited about one source&#39;s panic tactics.  Not <br/>
just about sugar, but about anything at all.  Depending on single sources <br/>
isn&#39;t research, and it&#39;s not the best way to learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906056221">The following was shared in a homeschooling egroup.  I haven&#39;t read the whole thing, but this caught my eye about the long term damage done by current methods for teaching kids to read....<br/>

Statistically, more American children suffer long-term life-harm from <br/>
the process of learning to read then from parental abuse, accidents <br/>
and all other childhood diseases and disorders combined. In purely <br/>
economic terms, reading related difficulties cost our nation more <br/>
than the war on terror, crime and drugs combined. <br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve spent the <br/>
last 7 months letting the girls (all under 7) control their own food <br/>
choices and they now eat about 75% sugary-type snack foods/candy and <br/>
about 25% nutrient-filled food. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have more interesting nutrient-food available and less sugary type. <br/>
<br/>
If their choices are mostly sugar and they had years of deprivation, they&#39;re <br/>
rewarding themselves with something they were taught was reward-stuff, special <br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Because my kids never had dessert-training or sugar rewards, they let that <br/>
sit while they eat other things WAY more often than not.  We got tons of <br/>
Christmas goodies given to us this year.  The thing Holly was moving cookies and <br/>
candy to look for the other day was banana bread.   <br/>
<br/>
We had company three different times, and by leaving our gifty stuff out, <br/>
most of it disappeared.  When company was gone it sat.  They show up, it <br/>
disappears.<br/>
<br/>
What Kirby ate that was questionable was almond M&Ms.  There were raw almonds <br/>
on the counter, too, and those were going almost as fast as the M&Ms, with <br/>
just my kids around.  <br/>
<br/>
We will end up throwing out candy canes, and the something-brittle that&#39;s <br/>
hard and sticky didn&#39;t go (except my husband and I ate some).<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s because they&#39;ve never had sugar villified or glorified, they <br/>
have chosen what to eat based on what they feel would be good.  And it&#39;s not <br/>
&quot;taste good,&quot; it&#39;s &quot;I feel like I haven&#39;t had much fruit lately,&quot; or &quot;I should eat <br/>
some protein.&quot;<br/>

should stay away from talking about the bad stuff but offer and talk up (a <br/>
little) the good stuff. Instead of commenting on how too much sugar is bad <br/>
for them, they should be commenting about the good stuff that protein and <br/>

WOW.<br/>
More weird use of statistics. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Long-term life-harm&quot; is a term I hadn&#39;t heard, but it surely describes a lot <br/>
of what school does in MANY more ways than helping kids think they&#39;re stupid <br/>
because they read late.   <br/>
<br/>
The very cool thing about unschoolers who learn to read on their own is that <br/>
they will themselves just totally belie ANY claim that reading instruction <br/>
requires experts and therapy and carefully constructed reading programs.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t change the world this year, but within a hundred years, I don&#39;t <br/>
think anyone will believe that anymore because too many kids will have grown up, <br/>
lived full lives and died who were not taught to read, yet read quite better <br/>
and more happily than those &quot;trained&quot; by professionals.<br/>

*******<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;re having to fight this battle now, and I wish i&#39;d been smarter about food in the first place.  Years ago, when Will was young and a very picky eater, he was also a stick-child.  So much so that we had WIC and Public Health nurses and school nurses pushing unsolicited advice.  I started buying and allowing more junky food because at least he would eat that.  when all I offered him was healthy food, he would skip meals, then tell the school nurse he hadn&#39;t eaten since school lunch the previous day.  Getting him to eat became a huge manipulation playing field.  It was a power-bartering point because he could be the center of attention by refusing to eat, while all adults in attendance begged him to eat.  <br/>
 <br/>
Andy came along with his own eating issues, and turned into a carb-junkie, who is now about 20 lbs overweight.  At least when he refuses to eat in our new healthy pantry, no one will worry I&#39;m being a negligent Mom.  <br/>
 <br/>
The problem is that in our efforts to have Will look healthier than a wraith, we helped Andy develop an expectation of snacky foods that leaves him feeling deprived if we offer only fruit for snacks.  I&#39;m having some trouble selling it as making better choices to take good care of our bodies when it feels like deprivation!  We&#39;ve made it a family change, so maybe it can just become the way we all eat.  <br/>
 <br/>
It will be tough tho, since I grew up in a family where junk food was a reward, and &#39;fun food&#39; was tightly controlled.  Breakfast was ALWAYS Total cereal on weekdays, we were only allowed to eat Roman Meal bread, and had to eat all our vegies (even things that made us gag) and dessert was only for those who ate all their dinner.  Until my sis and I reached our teens and put on weight (from Dorito and Pizza at the school snack bar) when dessert cancelled for us.  <br/>
 <br/>
I think it was my Mom&#39;s over-reaction to the fact that her sisters were all overweight.  My Mom had been quite a crash-dieter in high school, and my Dad puts great value on being thin.  In later years, my Mom let herself gain weight and later realized it was her way of getting back at my Dad for being such a jerk.  I know some part of me (and my sis, too, because we&#39;ve talked about it) resists losing weight because when we do, Daddy will make a big fuss over it -- like we had no value as fat girls, but thinner we&#39;ll be better people.    <br/>
 <br/>
I guess my point in all this rambling is that controlling your kids&#39; diet leads to all kinds of fall-out, much of it multi-generational.  And the road back to healthy eating habits can be arduous.  I&#39;m pretty sure if I&#39;d been less externally controlled, I&#39;d be better at this issue with our kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163442161">Something I noticed last night at the book store. I regularly browse the &#39;education&#39; section, just to see what&#39;s being put out there, and noticing how fast the  home education books are expanding.  In the section of books for classroom teachers, the new ad line seems to be &#39;Irresistible Exercise in (subject name here) for students.&#39;  It seems finally, someone has recognized that the average kid (and anyone with any sense of curiousity) rejects the way things have been done. <br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t look to see what any of those &#39;irresistible&#39; activities were, so I don&#39;t know if they are truly the most fun a child ever had in a classroom, but thought it funny that they think they can make something kids can&#39;t resist enjoying.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I was at Toys R Us looking for an Etch a Sketch for Holly for Christmas, and <br/>
came upon some sticker books.  Batman story with stickers.  Kind of like <br/>
Colorforms, but I don&#39;t think the stickers came off once you put them on.  <br/>
<br/>
What struck me was the glory-banner on the cover saying &quot;FULLY INTERACTIONAL.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Oh really!?<br/>
<br/>
The book did something back for you?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
So for a while 15 years ago the education buzzword was that things should be <br/>
&quot;interactional&quot; meaning kids get feedback.<br/>
<br/>
Now it means &quot;the book doesn&#39;t just lie there, you can pick it up and move it <br/>
yourself!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well duh.  Books have always been that way.  And if it didn&#39;t have Batman <br/>
stickers, they could have colored in it. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
So I suppose in a few years the lamest stuff will be labelled &quot;educationally <br/>
irresistable.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Come to think of it, all of compulsory education is pretty irresistable, if <br/>
by that they mean you don&#39;t have any choice.<br/>
<br/>
Resistance is futile.  The Borg is irresistable.<br/>

<br/>
I found I still can&#39;t play Monopoly, not even the fun-looking Lord of the<br/>
Rings version we gave our daughter for Christmas.  I realized it wasn&#39;t so<br/>
much the flashbacks to playing with much-older siblings and cousins as it<br/>
was my deep shame at my inability to add my own money or my properties, or<br/>
to understand that the number on the board was not the rent you had to pay<br/>
(I think the siblings snowed me with that one).  I can&#39;t figure change or<br/>
multiply the number on the dice by 4 (at least, not quickly enough for dh,<br/>
who is *always* the Banker).<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t seem to matter that I get to be Aragorn and the railroads are<br/>
horses; I still hate Monopoly.<br/>

for 15 years. And throughout that time have learned MUCH about this <br/>
SERIOUS issue!! This article was shared from another <br/>
health/nutrition friend and (IMO) thought it was 1 of the best <br/>
written. It is certainly NOT panic tactics but GENUINE care for our <br/>
publics health. Even though this issue is directed at all ages my <br/>
main reason for sharing it was for childrens sake. I thought parents <br/>
on this list might appreciate the thorough info. This issue is an <br/>
ALARMING one and should be taken seriously! Im sure all the parents <br/>
on this group love their children and want the best possible health <br/>
for them. And also know many people are in the dark about the <br/>
serious realities of this issue. My intent of this post was out of <br/>
genuine concern!! peace, Sonja</div>

<br/>
There may be truth mixed in there. But when the motivation for writing<br/>
something is fear that people won&#39;t heed what you want them to understand,<br/>
then the goal becomes whatever will make people listen and truth gets<br/>
sacrificed.<br/>

I prefer to get my information from sources that can report research more<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1831293228">We were at the library the other day and the librarian said,&#39;It&#39;s so good<br/>
you like books.&#39; to my four year old, as if it is SUCH a chore in the first<br/>
place!  That is the kind of attitude that would make my kids shy away from<br/>
reading.  But maybe they are just contrary.  Four years they ate broccoli<br/>
until my father had to say, &#39;That&#39;s so great you like broccoli!  It&#39;s really<br/>
good for you...&#39; and on and on.  Of course it then occurred to them maybe<br/>
they were not supposed to.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The following was shared in a homeschooling egroup.  I haven&#39;t read the<br/>
whole thing, but this caught my eye about the long term damage done by<br/>
current methods for teaching kids to read....<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Statistically, more American children suffer long-term life-harm from<br/>
&gt; the process of learning to read then from parental abuse, accidents<br/>
&gt; and all other childhood diseases and disorders combined. In purely<br/>
&gt; economic terms, reading related difficulties cost our nation more<br/>
&gt; than the war on terror, crime and drugs combined.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;We need to reconceptualize what it means to learn to read and who&#39;s<br/>
&gt; responsible for its success if we&#39;re going to deal with the<br/>
&gt; problem.&quot; - Dr. Grover Whitehurst, Director Institute of Educational<br/>

It would be possible for any one of us to inform the others of us of enough <br/>

I think we should use this list to talk about how children learn in peace and <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810947018"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Again:  What do we eat?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The USDA&#39;s dietary guidelines for Americans are quite sound.  To put it in a *nutshell*: variety and moderation are the keys.<br/>
<br/>
Refined wheat is not the only grain in the grocery store.  Try polenta or barley for a side dish.  Many varieties of rice are available today.  Buy rice and rye crackers to offer along with wheat crackers.  Have oatmeal for breakfast.  Make granola bars.<br/>
<br/>
Go to a farmer&#39;s market or check out the canned or frozen food sections for exotic fruits and vegetables.<br/>
<br/>
There are dozens of varieties of legumes.  Browse a cookbook or the web for new ways to cook them.<br/>
<br/>
Check out ethnic recipes.  Many non-American cuisines are based on ample amounts of vegetables and grains flavored with smaller amounts of meat/seafood/legumes.<br/>
<br/>
Cube tofu and serve it in a spicy curry sauce.  (OK, my kids won&#39;t eat that, but they do like plain cubes of tofu.)<br/>
<br/>
Every once in awhile, have a good old American chunk of meat with a side of potatoes :-)<br/>
<br/>
Our children may not always choose to eat a variety of foods, but if variety is available, they will be more likely to choose it in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Eating too many unrefined carbs is bad, but we can no longer go the Atkins route since we have all learned over the last week how bad the oversight is of our beef and other meat supply&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here is a better reason for not going the Atkins route: it doesn&#39;t offer variety or moderation.  BTW, I live less than an hour from the ranch in Mabton where the cow was raised.  Although I am horrified that this happened, I believe it will lead to positive changes in the food processing system.  At least I hope so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279740580">I read a lot of the article and the interview it linked to. It is hard <br/>
to figure out what they are actually promoting in terms of reading <br/>
instruction - it doesn&#39;t seem to be promoting any specific methods. <br/>
What I get from it is a huge push for parents and teachers not to shame <br/>
kids who don&#39;t read &quot;on time.&quot; Also there is definitely the idea being <br/>
promoted that every child is very individual and will learn in their <br/>
own way and on their own timetable and that all reading instruction <br/>
should be very very carefully keyed in to that individual child&#39;s <br/>
specifics.<br/>
<br/>
Another quote:<br/>
&quot;So painful does shame become in the public arena of the schoolroom <br/>
that our children swiftly divide into two streams and two futures <br/>
purely on the basis of their response to the shame that accompanies the <br/>
struggle to decode our written language.&quot;<br/>
