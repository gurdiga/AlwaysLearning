<div id="ygrps-yiv-1797433040">All of this talk about the TV being &quot;evil&quot; got me thinking about how people<br/>
project their feelings onto inanimate objects and give those objects power<br/>
over their lives.  Can objects really *BE* &quot;evil&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I then was WATCHING TV last night and stumbled across a show that I had been<br/>
looking forward to seeing called &quot;Most Evil&quot; (on the Discovery Channel). <br/>
There is a criminologist who ranks killers on a scale from 1 to 22 (22 being<br/>
the most evil and disturbed).  The first show was about couple killers<br/>
(Partners in Crime), where a few of them were dominate men who dominated the<br/>
female and in turn the female committed acts to help her partner commit<br/>
violent heinous sex crimes and murder.  <br/>
<br/>
They go to a point in the show where they talked about the &quot;shock box&quot; that<br/>
someone (I&#39;m sorry I don&#39;t have the facts on who, I didn&#39;t write it down at<br/>
the time) built after the Holocaust and one of the high ranking officers<br/>
said in his war crimes trial that he was &quot;just doing what he was told.&quot;  He<br/>
wanted to see just how far people would go when they were just doing what<br/>
they were told.<br/>
<br/>
So he brings in people to do this experiment.  One as being the teacher and<br/>
one the student.  What the teacher doesn&#39;t realize is that the shock box is<br/>
fake and that the student is an actor.  The teacher is then instructed to<br/>
ask the student to respond to a series of questions and each time the<br/>
student gets them wrong they are to push a button that sends a shock to the<br/>
student (the teacher cannot see the student, he can only hear him).  Each<br/>
wrong answer brings a higher shock level.  The shock levels range from a few<br/>
volts up to a deadly 345 volts.  <br/>
<br/>
The man expected less than 1% of the people brought in to be teachers to<br/>
actually go all the way to the end and administer 345 volts.  The actual %<br/>
that went to the end was 65%!  There were quite a few people that questioned<br/>
going so far but were told to keep going.  They were told that they wouldn&#39;t<br/>
be held responsible for their actions.  That it wouldn&#39;t be their fault.  A<br/>
quote that this man made after the experiment was &quot;If you want to see the<br/>
face of evil, look in the mirror.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
So, can *objects* actually be evil?  Money, TV, jewelry, tattoos, piercings,<br/>
movies, music, etc... I DON&#39;T think so.  I really believe we project onto<br/>
those things our fears and issues and let them take control over our lives. <br/>
We choose to make them evil, they are not evil in and of themselves.<br/>

  From an article called Hide Your Books<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.waldorfhomeschoolers.com/hidebooks.htm">http://www.waldorfhomeschoolers.com/hidebooks.htm</a><br/>
 <br/>
Seems  that TV is only an idol to be worshipped when people want to<br/>
use that image to control people.  A Christian site personifies TV as<br/>
something evil with a gun to your kid&#39;s face.  A Waldorf site links<br/>
an article that refers to it as &quot;the almighty screen.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
That is propaganda.  It&#39;s fear with a boogeyman.  It&#39;s not child-<br/>
centered.  It&#39;s control-centered, and fear-mongering.<br/>
 <br/>
And on a lighter note, her &quot;there was no end to the time...&quot; would be<br/>
a candidate for the &quot;If I Let them&quot; page <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/ifilet">http://sandradodd.com/ifilet</a><br/>
if she weren&#39;t a teacher in the business of controlling kids who<br/>
aren&#39;t even her own.<br/>
