<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112901274">I don&#39;t usually post things without permission from other lists, but in my <br/>
horror I&#39;m going to make an exception. This is from a statewide homeschooling <br/>
list I&#39;m on.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I know this isnt much help with your 5 year old, but<br/>
 </span></blockquote>maybe with the other two.  Start earlier.<br/>
I found that kids are most responisve to learning<br/>
phonics between 1 and 2 years old. They can be taught<br/>
the same time you are teaching the other sounds of the<br/>
world.  For example...at that age they can &quot;moo&quot; when<br/>
you point to a picture of a cow and &quot;oink&quot; when you<br/>
point to a picture of a pig.  At this time you can<br/>
also easily teach them to make the appropriate noises<br/>
as you point to the letters.  This gives them a good<br/>
base for phonics and what better time to teach them<br/>
but when they are so hungry for input and love hearing<br/>
themselves make noise.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
All I can say is -- ARGH!<br/>
<br/>
The baby probably won&#39;t feel pressured or whatever with this, but the <br/>
implication of starting structured learning so early, along with the idea <br/>
that it&#39;s already too late for the 5 year old... ARGH!<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn, whose List ethics seem to have slipped, but is somehow not concerned <br/>
that the writer is on this list<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1091268177">People can be on more than one list without agreeing equally with what&#39;s on <br/>
all of them.  Really! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Just because a toddler says &quot;moo&quot; to a photo of a cow or a little plastic cow <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s ready for phonics.<br/>
<br/>
And to say &quot;Toddlers are eager to learn&quot; is true.  They&#39;re not eager to learn <br/>
calculus, though, or the history of Uzbekestan.  <br/>
<br/>
Playing is playing, and sometimes playing is like phonics and sometimes <br/>
playing is like tumbling.  Kirby could name the names of letters <br/>
(refrigerator magnets, or big print on cardboard boxes) before he knew how <br/>
old he was, but while it was one bitty aspect of &quot;reading readiness&quot; so is <br/>
everything else including being able to sit up and point at things and to <br/>
turn a page without tearing it out of the book.<br/>
<br/>
When somenoe recommends turning a curiosity or interest into a course of <br/>
study, it&#39;s a departure from unschooling.  Toddlers learn by naming and <br/>
sorting and touching and doing their version of &quot;what&#39;s that?&quot; which adds to <br/>
naming and sorting.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;m&quot; when one sees an &quot;M&quot; or saying &quot;moo&quot; when one sees a cow is not an <br/>
invitation for the parents to discuss phonemes or morphemes or any other  <br/>
phonetic theory or linguistic terminology.<br/>
<br/>
Just wake up from that nightmare and turn your face back toward unschooling!<br/>
