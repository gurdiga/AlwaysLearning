<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239466302">Ah!  Speaking of those philosophy discussions....<br/>
This is sent to me from someone I don&#39;t know, who&#39;s a rabinical  <br/>
student in Israel, who reads my SCA stuff and has corresponded with  <br/>
me about virtues.  He&#39;s young and in the SCA in Israel.  Crazy  <br/>
SCA...  some parts drive me crazy and some parts I love.   But he  <br/>
sent a homeschooling cartoon:<br/>

Dear Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I was reading the Washington Post Express (the free metro version  <br/>
handed out near train stations) today and saw a cartoon that made me  <br/>
think of you.  It was the Duplex.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.gocomics.com/duplex/">http://www.gocomics.com/duplex/</a>    <br/>
I thought you&#39;d enjoy and figured you may not have otherwise read it.<br/>

Sincerely yours...<br/>
