WHO Wants You to Know About:<br/>
Public Alternative Education Programs, Cyberschools &<br/>
&quot;Homeschool&quot; Centers<br/>
<br/>
     Homeschooling Public Alternative Education <br/>
      What laws regulate the programs? RCW 28A.200, the Home-Based Instruction Law WAC 392-121-182, Public School Alternative Learning Experience <br/>
      Who has control and is accountable for the education of the child? The parents have control on what, when, where, why, and how their children will learn. The parents are accountable. Certificated staff is in control, responsible and accountable for the ALP (Alternative Learning Plan) and student assessments. <br/>
      What about curriculum? Parents have complete control over curriculum content, level, presentation, etc. Parents provide their own curriculum. School district may allow parental input. Districts provide curriculum and sometimes purchase orders for curriculum purchases. <br/>
      Is a faith-based curriculum OK? Absolutely. All decisions relating to curriculum and philosophy or doctrine are the responsibility of the parent. No. It is against the law for public school programs to use religious curriculum. <br/>
      What are the testing requirements? There are two testing options - standardized achievement test or non-test-based assessment; the results remain in the home. All students take the state-mandated WASL (Washington Assessment of Student Learning). Students may opt out of testing, but passing the 10th grade WASL is a graduation requirement for 2008 high school graduation. <br/>
      What are the requirements for student progress? It is the parents&#39; responsibility to see that the child&#39;s progress is appropriate for their age or stage of development. The student&#39;s performance is evaluated every 45 school days. If s/he is not progressing, the ALP is revised. <br/>
      What are the record keeping requirements? Parents keep the health, testing and educational records of their child at home. ALP records, evaluations, grades, credits, WASL scores, etc. are kept at the school. <br/>
      What about Outcome-Based Education and Goals 2000?  Homeschooled students are exempt from Outcome-Based Education and Goals 2000. The student&#39;s ALP must support the Outcome-Based education goals and objectives. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Some public alternative education programs have the word &quot;homeschool&quot; in their title. How do I know if I&#39;m homeschooling, or in a public alternative education program? <br/>
The public alternative education programs (with increased oversight) are modeled on one of the ways we legally homeschool, namely, qualifying to homeschool by using a supervising teacher who meets with your child(ren) on an average of one hour a week.<br/>
<br/>
You are probably in a public alternative education program if: you registered your child for the program on school district forms; you are meeting in a public school building; school district personnel (the teachers) are supervising or assessing your child; you have access to district curriculum materials, libraries, computers, etc.; your child has an alternative learning plan; you keep records on hours spent on academic pursuit at home; your child is assessed by the school personnel; your child is expected to take the WASL; and records are being kept at the school on your child.<br/>
<br/>
The only program that we are aware of presently that is offered through the public schools for homeschoolers that is not a public alt. ed. program is the Manhattan Center in the Highline School District. If you don&#39;t know for sure, ask your district if they are receiving Full Time Enrollment (FTE) funding for your child. If they are, you are in an alternative education program.<br/>
<br/>
My school district&#39;s alternative education program is not demanding about religious curriculum, logging hours, essential learning requirement goals, student&#39;s alternative learning plan, etc. <br/>
Some school districts are not in compliance with the alternative learning experience requirements, WAC 392-121-182 or the state laws. These programs are new and trying to attract a homeschooling population that does not traditionally like or want a lot of oversight. As these programs become successfully established they will conform with the WACs.<br/>
<br/>
What concerns WHO about Public School Alternative Learning Programs?<br/>
These programs are being targeted at homeschoolers almost exclusively. In some districts public school students are not eligible. Why are homeschoolers targeted populations? Possibly because each student recruited from homeschooling to a public alternative education program brings with them FTE money. Then again, homeschool parents already know how to teach and will not require supervision or training. Or maybe it&#39;s because homeschooled students tend to be independent and motivated learners who score well on tests; a bonus for any public school program.<br/>
<br/>
Evidence suggests that some school districts are deliberately misinforming parents interested in homeschooling as to their legal homeschooling option under Home-based Instruction, and then misdirecting them to public alternative programs as their only &quot;homeschooling&quot; choice. These actions serve to bring funding into the public alternative programs while reducing the ranks of homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
These programs present to the public, and governing bodies, a more familiar, supervised and regulated form of &quot;homeschooling.&quot; The eventual result could be a lobbying of the legislature by public education to amend or abolish the Home-based Instruction law, and to re-absorb the homeschooling community into public education under the auspices of alternative education.<br/>
