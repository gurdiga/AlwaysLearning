<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558379912">Hi all, <br/>
My daughter is six, and is at that stage where she doesn&#39;t like to be &quot;it&quot; when playing tag.  However, at the playground, when she is trying to get a game together, she pretty much always falls back on Tag.  This leads to a lot of playground angst, and saying everything that she is on is base. Luckily, there was a slightly older boy at the park today who didn&#39;t mind being &quot;It&quot;, LOL.    I recently had a birthday party for her, and did a lot of research on cooperative games, and found some good ones (just to share a little): <br/>
<br/>
Who has the key?<br/>
Everyone gets in a circle, and you unwind some string, making sure that it goes all the way around, put a key on the string, and then tie a knot.  Someone sits in the middle, closes their eyes, and counts to twenty. While they&#39;re counting, you pass the key around the circle, and  when they open their eyes, they have to guess who has the key. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My question, does anyone have any ideas for a loose game that involves the kids using the playground structure?  I&#39;ve noticed that they all want to be on the structure, and play a game using all the different climbing aspects of structure.  Oh, and I&#39;m six months pregnant and don&#39;t really want to be involved in running around on the playground.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance, <br/>
Kim<br/>

Sharks?  One is the shark and if he can touch anyone on the platform,  <br/>
they&#39;re sharks too.  Don&#39;t play until everyone&#39;s out, just until there  <br/>
are three sharks or some such, and then they all get on and if there&#39;s  <br/>
not a volunteer shark, let the game be over, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
My kids played sharks with furniture and imaginary sharks, or on  <br/>
playgrounds with a kid-shark.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Freeze tag?  That way people can get unfrozen. Still have to have one <br/>
person as &quot;It&quot; but when someone is tagged, they have to freeze in place. <br/>
The other players can untag them -- but they risk getting tagged while <br/>
they do it. The simplest way is that they can unfreeze someone by <br/>
tagging them. But we&#39;ve also played where they have to crawl between <br/>
their legs to untag them. Another version is that, if you get tagged, <br/>
you can unfreeze yourself by calling out a color (players can&#39;t repeat <br/>
colors).<br/>
<br/>
Monster tag. When you get tagged, you link arms  or hold hands and work <br/>
together to tag the next person. The monster grows until everyone is <br/>
part of the monster. Only the players on the end of the monster can <br/>
actually tag - since only they have a free hand.<br/>
<br/>
Statues? That was a super popular alternative to tag for my kids and <br/>
their friends. Here&#39;s how to play Statues.<br/>
<br/>
   1. A person starts out as the &quot;Curator<br/>
      &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curator</a>&gt;&quot; and stands at the end of a<br/>
      field. Everyone else playing stands at the far end (distance<br/>
      depends upon playing area selected). The object of the game is for<br/>
      a &quot;Statue&quot; to tag the Curator, thereby becoming the Curator and<br/>
      resetting the game.<br/>
   2. The Curator turns their back to the field, and the &quot;Statues&quot;<br/>
      attempt to race across and tag the Curator.<br/>
   3. Whenever the Curator turns around, the Statues must freeze in<br/>
      position and hold that for as long as the Curator looks at them.<br/>
      The Curator can even walk around the Statues, examining them.<br/>
      However, the Curator needs to be careful - whenever their back is<br/>
      turned, Statues are free to move.<br/>
   4. If a Statue is caught moving, they are sent back to the starting<br/>
      line to begin again (or thrown out of that round, whichever way is<br/>
      preferred.) Usually, the honesty of the Curator isn&#39;t an issue -<br/>
      it&#39;s more fun to be a Statue anyway.<br/>
<br/>
But I think my kids way of playing it also involved a guessing game <br/>
aspect - if the curator guessed what the statue was a statue of, that <br/>
statue could become the curator or go back to start (not sure which it was).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1525809758">my kids play toilet tag... like freeze tag but you have to kind of sqwat down and hold your arms out.  the other people come and push and arm down to &quot;flush the toilet&quot; and you are free.  Perhaps have more than one it.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1010369361">How about some imaginary character type games; for example, we play pirates a  lot, the play structure is the ship. You could be the look out (less running around.) Someone is the captain, someone is the sail master, someone is the treasure hunter, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes we play aliens with the structure being the space ship. <br/>
Sometimes we recreate the characters of their favorite video games. <br/>
<br/>
I like the variations on tag that others suggested. I&#39;m going to try some of those out too, since we have similar strife over regular tag. <br/>
