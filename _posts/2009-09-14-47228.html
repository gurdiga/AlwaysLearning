<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195139400">Here&#39;s what Jill posted.  I&#39;m sorry I forgot to bring it to this list.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to begin today&#39;s chat <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular">http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular</a> (Friday morning chat)<br/>
with that same topic, because it&#39;s important and I was not very present last time (drugs/pain/sleep).<br/>
<br/>
Jill&#39;s notes:<br/>
<br/>
The topic was: How do schools and mainstream culture discourage <br/>
interests and curiosity and fascination? Why would they? Do they <br/>
mean to? What happens? Can adults recover from voices say their <br/>
interests are stupid? What if they don&#39;t? Can they still unschool?<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is like rejecting the school, but unschooling is like <br/>
rejecting the curriculum. This was said by Matthew Vilter at the <br/>
Good Vibrations conference, and Pam Sorooshian relayed it in the <br/>
chat, when we were talking about how school at home discourages <br/>
interests also.<br/>
<br/>
For the first question of the topic, Sandra said that is was general <br/>
disrespect for children.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Just because my kids like something doesn&#39;t mean I have to LOVE it <br/>
too, it means I need to find a way to help them do it and explore <br/>
it.&quot; Jenny Cyphers<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some families might not discourage anything specifically, but the <br/>
atmosphere at their houses is negative and critical.&quot; Sandra Dodd</div>
