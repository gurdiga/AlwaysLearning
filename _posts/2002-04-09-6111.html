<div id="ygrps-yiv-488796183">I keep checking in here, to find some interesting conversations, and <br/>
it&#39;s been about rodents for the past few days.  I&#39;ve been generally <br/>
skimming, because no matter how wonderful rats may be. (and you did <br/>
give me a new perspective) I have a phobia.  The other night I <br/>
dreamed I was left with 3 white rats to care for, for a friend and 2 <br/>
of them got washed away in the ocean, and one of them ended up <br/>
turning into a dog or something by the end of the dream. I was <br/>
holding them in the dream without too much difficulty, and thats a <br/>
huge step for me, even for just a dream.<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m going to attempt a new conversation, cause that&#39;s always <br/>
the advice you get, when you complain about a current one.<br/>
So....<br/>
Hmmmmm.....<br/>
Okay, here&#39;s a good one.<br/>
My dd has been involved in a childrens theater for the past 5 years.<br/>
It&#39;s grown each production, and this time, they did the Wizard of Oz<br/>
and cast adults for the main characters(except Dorothy).  It was a <br/>
really good production, and it seems this is the direction this group <br/>
is going to take.  Adults and kids acting together.  I have no <br/>
problem with this, other than the fact that it limits the kids <br/>
opportunities and some of these kids, including my dd, have been <br/>
involved since the first production, and now adults may be getting <br/>
all the challenging roles.  We&#39;ll see.<br/>
My real problem is, that today, i sat in the park with another mom, <br/>
whose dd had been in the show too.   She started telling me all kinds <br/>
of gossip I had no clue of.  The producer and the stage manager being <br/>
a little too close(both married to other people)and rumors going <br/>
around.  The director being extremely controlling over his family.  <br/>
Basically demeaning his wife and all kinds of seemingly <br/>
obsessive/compulsive stuff he has problems with.  Also people <br/>
assuming he(the director) and the lady that did the choreography were <br/>
also having an affair, and a whole bunch of crap, I was totally <br/>
oblivious to.<br/>
Also people are talking about the money, and whose basically <br/>
pocketing profits and ripping off everyone.  1000&#39;s of dollars were <br/>
made in this production, and lots of donations were given and the <br/>
kids had to pay for or make  their own costumes and pay for their <br/>
cast party.<br/>
Now I don&#39;t know if the gossip is true, but I do have a problem with <br/>
the accusations going around, and the possiblity of truthfulness.  <br/>
Should I encourage my dd to be involved with a group that has this <br/>
kind of crap going on?<br/>
We were thinking of starting our own homeschooling theater group, <br/>
because my dd wants to direct, and basically have more controll over <br/>
a production.  We&#39;d keep it small, and free(family and friend <br/>
audiences).  But this group does a big production every year.  I&#39;m <br/>
just starting to wonder how good of an experience it is.  There are <br/>
other plays she could try for in surrounding areas, but she feels a <br/>
real part of this group having been in it from the beginning and a <br/>
lot of the same kids come back each year.  <br/>
I&#39;m wondering how wary I should be now.  I guess if I didn&#39;t notice <br/>
it, the kids could have been spared too.  I just don&#39;t know.<br/>
It all seems kind of creepy now.  :-(<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972242223">Joanna - <br/>
 <br/>
I think it&#39;s unfortunate that so many undesirable things are going on in<br/>
your daughter&#39;s theatre group - I&#39;d be concerned too, though to be in<br/>
theatre is to accept some off-beat folks.  And sometimes those off-beat<br/>
thespians are great weird and sometimes bad weird.  It sounds like your<br/>
daughter is pretty committed to theatre.  I can only tell you the<br/>
direction we took.  My daughter started dance and gymnastics when she<br/>
was 3 years old.  As she got a little older it became clear that<br/>
performing on a stage was the biggest focus in her life.  She attended a<br/>
few summer camp drama programs and fell in love even more.  She added<br/>
competitive cheerleading, circus club, trapeze and a couple of other<br/>
skills to her repetoire, and I began to take her love for this more<br/>
seriously.  I think a huge turning point for us was discovering our<br/>
local homeschool theatre group.  Her reading was always her weak point.<br/>
She learned to read in public school, but while my boys got great<br/>
reading skills from school, she never seemed to catch on.  Her first<br/>
audition with this theatre group was so horribly bad that when I didn&#39;t<br/>
get a call from the director, I assumed she hadn&#39;t been cast.  We missed<br/>
the first rehearsal, but Jeanne called us and got us into the group.<br/>
Chelsea had a small, but good character part, and performed very well.<br/>
The next season she was cast as Amy in Little Women.  Somewhere along<br/>
the line I got the name of a very reputable agent who books kids in<br/>
commercials, print work, television, etc.  We had to wait months for her<br/>
next audition date, but Chelsea did land a contract with her.  We also<br/>
found out where open auditions were posted in the paper and started<br/>
going to those.  We started big - a Debbie Allen audition with 500-600<br/>
kids.  It was a great experience.  She knew after sitting through that<br/>
one that she really loved doing it.  She got a call-back - great for her<br/>
confidence - but was not cast.  We&#39;ve learned so much in this process -<br/>
how to win, how to lose, huge amounts about the technicalities and world<br/>
of theatre, that small character parts can be just as much of a learning<br/>
experience as big parts, and most importantly, to be selective about the<br/>
parts you take once you&#39;ve gained some experience.  She&#39;s done enough<br/>
auditions to know which type she&#39;ll get call-backs for and which she<br/>
won&#39;t.  She got a call-back for Debbie Allen because it was dance heavy.<br/>
She didn&#39;t get a call-back for the Broadway/Disney Lion King audition<br/>
because it was singing heavy.  Now she takes voice lessons!  As far as<br/>
starting a homeschool theatre group, it&#39;s a great idea but tons and tons<br/>
of work.  I assist the director of our group now, and there&#39;s no way to<br/>
describe the hours and energy it takes to put on a quality performance.<br/>
But if that&#39;s what both of you love, the idea may be just up your alley.<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t recommend making it free though - it can get expensive to<br/>
produce a good show, and you have to pay for it somehow.  I would make<br/>
the tickets cheap if you have factors that keep you from producing a<br/>
totally professional show, such as a church location rather than a<br/>
professional theatre, or a lack of directing experience, or a small<br/>
group of kids to start.  I&#39;m not trying to discourage you at all - I<br/>
don&#39;t know what we would have done if Kathleen and Jeanne hadn&#39;t started<br/>
this wonderful group.  Where do you live?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6424153">Your daughter has a lot of experience!  That&#39;s great.<br/>
We&#39;re pretty small town as far as the acting goes.  Carly really <br/>
loves it, but we haven&#39;t looked into doing anything &quot;bigger&quot; or more.<br/>
The theater group I was thinking of wouldn&#39;t be for big productions.<br/>
I&#39;m thinking the kids are in control, with guidance, and the <br/>
productions are small scale.  Like I said, friends and family.  I do <br/>
have a church that I think we can use, so we probably have a <br/>
location.  I still need to talk to this other mom, I was thinking <br/>
might want to go in on it with us.  Her son has told Carly he is <br/>
going to be a director and they&#39;ve joked about doing plays together <br/>
and argue who will direct it.  So I thought they might want to really <br/>
give it a try.<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s just in the idea stage right now.<br/>
We live in Maryland. Eastern Shore. <br/>
We&#39;ve learned a lot from the productions we&#39;ve done with this other <br/>
group.  I do a lot of the sewing and costumes.  Your right, it is a <br/>
huge amount of work and time and I&#39;m not wanting to &#39;go there&#39;.  <br/>

 <br/>
I wish you were closer to No. Va.!  It sounds like your biggest concern<br/>
is the respect for the kids issue.  Our homeschool group is probably the<br/>
ultimate when it comes to respecting the kids opinions and<br/>
interpretation of character.  Ironically, we are doing two shows right<br/>
now, Fiddler Jr. with the homeschool group, and Wizard of Oz with a<br/>
non-profit community group.  Like your experience, the Oz cast is kids<br/>
and adults and the director is quite disrespectful toward the kids.  I<br/>
was starting to think that I was the only one who was completely<br/>
disgusted with this group and the director (other than one friend of<br/>
mine who isn&#39;t as vocal as I am), but tonight I talked to the Wicked<br/>
Witch, and boy, if I thought I was disgusted, she is furious and says<br/>
she&#39;ll never do another show with this director.  At least I know it&#39;s<br/>
not just me!  I think most of the families in the group haven&#39;t worked<br/>
with enough groups to know the difference.  It sounds like you are also<br/>
getting enough experience to know that you want a better group for your<br/>
daughter.  If you were closer I&#39;d try to get to you to come see Fiddler<br/>
later this month.  If you decide to start your own group, I bet your<br/>
daughter will feel very special having a mom who&#39;s willing to do so much<br/>
work to give her a great experience!  If you ever decide to vacation in<br/>
No. Va., get in touch with us!<br/>

&gt; I wouldn&#39;t recommend making it free though - it can get expensive to<br/>
&gt; produce a good show, and you have to pay for it somehow.  I would <br/>
make<br/>
&gt; the tickets cheap if you have factors that keep you from producing a<br/>
&gt; totally professional show, such as a church location rather than a<br/>
&gt; professional theatre, or a lack of directing experience, or a small<br/>
&gt; group of kids to start.  I&#39;m not trying to discourage you at all - I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t know what we would have done if Kathleen and Jeanne hadn&#39;t <br/>
started<br/>
&gt; this wonderful group.  Where do you live?<br/>

Yes, we are only 15-20 miles from DC.  Good to know somebody in OC!  I&#39;m<br/>
not a big beach person, but my kids enjoy it a lot, so I try to<br/>
accomodate them every now and then, but sometimes I need an additional<br/>
motivation to get me to the beach!<br/>
