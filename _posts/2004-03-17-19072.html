<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998245179">Hi again Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I must say I do have one daughter who finds interpersonal issues very difficult and is a volatile type of personality (rather like her father!).  She does have some food allergies, but they do not make a difference regarding her personality traits!  She reacts to wheat (tummy troubles) and still some to milk.   She is a much happier 12 year old when these foods are kept to a minimum, but her personality traits are just that, personality traits!<br/>
<br/>
It is a difficult subject but, with carefulness, you can soon see if this is just a personality trait (which can also be seen by looking at family personalities), or whether it is a behavioural reaction to a food.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
    Teresa<br/>

  The final test is to re-introduce the suspect food.  If the problems return <br/>
  then you have a confirmation as to whether this was the problem or not.  :D &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  I understand the theory, but it could still fail.  <br/>
  There are lots of factors in life, and kids just get older and grow into and <br/>
  out of and through different phases.<br/>
<br/>
  There seems to be a fad lately of magically controlling kids with drugs or <br/>
  deprivations or dietary restrictions, when in many cases talking to them and <br/>
  helping them figure out how to make decisions and express themselves would help <br/>
  MUCH more.<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, there are allergies.<br/>
<br/>
  But there seem to be more and more moms who turn to look for allergies <br/>
  instead of learning to deal with interpersonal issues.<br/>
<br/>
  And granted, Howard Gardners ideas of multiple intelligences (which I love a <br/>
  bunch) suggest that some people just are better than others with interpersonal <br/>
  stuff.  And that might be passed on genetically, just as other talents can <br/>
  be, but can and should be nurtured and discussed.  <br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;What if you had made sure he was wearing green socks the whole month during <br/>
    which he had a growth-spurt in the awareness area?  Could you then be sure <br/>
    green socks were to be creditted?<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt; There are correlations which aren&#39;t causes, and children change many time <br/>
  and <br/>
    many different ways just by growing older and having more experience in how <br/>
    to handle their own emotions and moods and sensitivities.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  If the green socks are removed and a problem returns, it might not have been <br/>
  because of the socks.  <br/>
<br/>
  Much religious practice and superstition seems based in futile attempts to <br/>
  control the world, some of which seemed to work a time or two and so are <br/>
  repeated through the centuries.<br/>
<br/>
  &lt;&lt;My daughter started having &quot;horrible tantrums&quot; when she was <br/>
<br/>
  2&1/2 and at first I thought it was the &quot;terrible twos&quot; that had <br/>
<br/>
  finally kicked in. Then when that didn&#39;t sit well my my mother&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
  intuition/instincts, I realized that I had started eating peanut butter <br/>
<br/>
  again recently after a long time of not eating it. Since I was <br/>
<br/>
  nursing her, she was getting it too. I quit eating PB and within 24 <br/>
<br/>
  hours they were gone. The only time this has reocured is when <br/>
<br/>
  she has accidentally ingested PB and she wakes up at night <br/>
<br/>
  completely disoriented, screaming and crying.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  This account seems plausible, but not all sworn food-sensitivities have this <br/>
  close a correlation.  I&#39;m not talking about specific people here on this list, <br/>
  but about the overall trend toward people wanting outside causes for <br/>
  personality traits.<br/>
<br/>
  And this inability to process peanut butter could easily be something a child <br/>
  grows out of.  Lots of kids will get hives or stomach upsets from one food or <br/>
  another (strawberries, common on the hives) when they&#39;re little but be able <br/>
  to tolerate the foods fine when they&#39;re older.<br/>
