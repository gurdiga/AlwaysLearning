<div id="ygrps-yiv-1288730073">Hey Julie,<br/>
<br/>
I would love to learn to spin.  How do you get started?  Can you use<br/>
electric clippers to shear?  I know the 4-H kids use clippers to slick shear<br/>
for livestock shows but perhaps they can&#39;t be used for wool to spin, I don&#39;t<br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
You raise goats too don&#39;t you?  My dd&#39;s doe is due any day now and she is so<br/>
scared something might happen to the new mom.  Any advice, comments,<br/>
encouragement would be greatly appreciated.<br/>
