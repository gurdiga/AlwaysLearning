How exciting! How much traffic do you get at the end of your driveway? Is it<br/>
enough to get some business?<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is now 12 but started the business bug when she was 8 also. We<br/>
lived in the country then, and it was really tough to satisfy this roadside<br/>
stand craving of hers as well. We went into more populated areas to find a<br/>
good spot to set up a table, and even checked out the different grocery<br/>
stores, etc. to see what it would take for her to set up there (permission,<br/>
and in some cases, a permit). She did sell lemonade and cookies<br/>
successfully. She also wanted to sell more, but ran into the problem that<br/>
she never quite made enough creative things (arts and crafts, etc.) to cover<br/>
what she figured out to be the costs of having the table (she added the cost<br/>
of gas, put a cost to her own time [though not mine!] and the cost of<br/>
supplies). So there were ups and downs for her, and I think one key is that<br/>
you don&#39;t have to solve all the problems, but just keep thinking with her.<br/>
She may want to try things that you are pretty sure won&#39;t work (those were<br/>
hard times for me, especially if it took a lot of work to get somewhere!),<br/>
but then she&#39;ll see. And you&#39;ll get to figure out more together!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter learned so much during this stage. She often had more ambition<br/>
for the end sale than she could figure out a way to get to, but she is SO<br/>
business-smart now, in part because of figuring out things back then. So<br/>
much problem-solving was done. It was discouraging to not find places to<br/>
sell easily, and to have problems hauling it all there without losing<br/>
anything, and the weather element, etc. BUT it was very &quot;educational&quot;. She<br/>
is still entreprenuer-like...she has a neighborhood pet-care business now.<br/>
And she plans to run her own dance company when she&#39;s older...at least<br/>
that&#39;s the plan now :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303876578">If you&#39;re thinking in terms of online sales and you have a digital <br/>
camera then she could hone her skills at a small auction site (with <br/>
adult approval of course) Since ebay is costly with startup fees <br/>
perhaps you could try a smaller auction site like Bidville, they let <br/>
you list for free and only charge a very small % of the final price <br/>
if the item sells. Just an idea I don&#39;t mean to be advertising for <br/>
them but I haven&#39;t had many problems there personally.Moza<br/>

What about a farmer&#39;s market?  We have several in our area that are free to<br/>
set up.  You go for a few hours on Saturday morning and it is a lot of fun.<br/>

If her main concern is making money, perhaps providing services is <br/>
another way to go. Someone else mentioned taking care of neighbors&#39; <br/>
pets, or playing with kids while their moms cook dinner (sort of a <br/>
junior mother&#39;s helper) or picking up mail/watering plants for people <br/>
on vacation.<br/>
