<div id="ygrps-yiv-1625019080">I&#39;ve been lurking due to an extreme state of busy-ness that just won&#39;t go<br/>
away! I hope it&#39;s okay to come in on this thread, though...<br/>
<br/>
Re depression,<br/>
<br/>
Talking about brain chemical imbalances - here&#39;s a way to help that doesn&#39;t<br/>
require much effort so long as it&#39;s accepted.<br/>
Ply her with fresh, preferably organic if you can afford them, vegies and<br/>
fruit, especially vegies. Raw is preferable, steamed or stir fried next.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that when I&#39;m depressed (environment/illness induced rather than<br/>
psychological) if someone plies me with fresh vegie juice, salads and yummy<br/>
healthy snacks (no highly processed or starchy foods) then my depression<br/>
starts to diminish and I can tackle the positive thinking side of life.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of magnesim and zinc foods or supplements, B vitamins, Omega 3. St<br/>
John&#39;s Wort is a good supplement if she can take it, but be careful as you<br/>
can&#39;t take this with other medication.<br/>
<br/>
I was depressed for over 20 years - during the years my children were<br/>
unschooling. It wasn&#39;t recognised at all by anyone and my immediate family<br/>
had no idea how to help. My kids were brillliant - they were able to offer<br/>
unconditional love in my darkest moments and just held me. That kept me<br/>
alive. Just being held. Sometimes I&#39;d push my dh away, but never the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Tackle the physical brain chemistry thing and then gently encourage your mom<br/>
to reprogram her thinking with positive thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody gets anything out of being depressed, even though it may look like<br/>
it. Depression is a trap, not a lurk. Group therapy helped me - leaving our<br/>
&#39;expectations&#39; of each other at the door was another way of bringing<br/>
unconditional love into my life. I needed that, after having had illnesses<br/>
ignored all the way through childhood.  I also read lots of self-help<br/>
books - they all helped, but that was because I desperately wanted to be<br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra hit the nail on the head when she mentioned choice and<br/>
responsibility in the same sentence. Perhaps your mom is probably<br/>
overwhelmed by her sense of responsibility - she doesn&#39;t want to be<br/>
responsible for herself any more - choice depresses her, she wants to be<br/>
mothered, to be dependent, have the day to day responsibility of making<br/>
decisions lifted from her shoulders so she can heal.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to bolster healing is to get creative. It&#39;s impossible to be<br/>
depressed when you are being creative. Make time to be creative together, or<br/>
with the kids. Get her to do something creative (simple, like blowing<br/>
bubbles or finger painting) with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to blow the blues away is to get down by some water and wander.<br/>
The beach is the absolute best, but a pond or river will suffice.<br/>
<br/>
With your mom&#39;s negativity I&#39;d be polite, then blunt, if politeness doesn&#39;t<br/>
work. Especially with respect to your daughter. I&#39;m an overprotective mum<br/>
around my kids and proud of it. I&#39;d say &quot;do you mind not talking meanly to<br/>
her&quot;. It took years for this to be effective though - for some reason<br/>
grandparents seem to think they can treat our kids like they were their<br/>
kids...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do I keep trying to brainstorm with them<br/>
&gt; in an attempt to &quot;convert&quot; them over to choice and freedom? Or do I<br/>
&gt; make the choice to give up these relationships?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Who are you trying to convince of your belief - them or yourself? If they<br/>
truly don&#39;t believe you or don&#39;t want to listen, leave them alone. Talk<br/>
about something else. If their actions impact on you tell them how you feel<br/>
about each action, but stop trying to sell them on your philosophy. A simple<br/>
&quot;when you do that to me I feel hurt and rejected... or whatever&quot; etc.<br/>
<br/>
cheers<br/>

ways she wouldn&#39;t have treated us. She&#39;d get after my kids about things <br/>
that she would have let us do. Luckily I was able to get her to see that. <br/>
&quot;Hey Mom, you would have let me do that when I was her age.&quot;<br/>
