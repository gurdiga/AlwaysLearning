I do think there are more allergies now then there<br/>
used to be, and I think it has a lot to do with all<br/>
the chemicals we are exposing ourselves to in our<br/>
environment and in our food.  We know, it&#39;s been<br/>
documented, that we are changing our chemical makeup,<br/>
affecting our own and other species with chemicals, so<br/>
it should be no great surprise, nor very mysterious<br/>
that kids are more chemically sensative and their<br/>
nervous systems are more defensive.<br/>
<br/>
That being said, I agree with Sandra.  There is a<br/>
current cultural fad to drug healthy, normal children<br/>
into little drones, which is just more chemicals which<br/>
are affecting their later physical and mental health<br/>
in scary ways that we are only beginning to<br/>
understand.  People also seem to be reacting to this<br/>
increase in physically defensive reactions by getting<br/>
hysterical about allergies.  As the mother of a child<br/>
who is extremely chemically sensative and whose child<br/>
has nearly died from anaphylactic shock after rushing<br/>
him into the ER, not once, not twice, but three times,<br/>
for three different foods, I think I can say I have a<br/>
little experience with allergies.  Everyone in our<br/>
family has them to some degree.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously we hear all about all the different<br/>
deprivation style diets and their magical results. <br/>
Yes my son has a number of foods that affect him<br/>
chemically/emotionally too.  Some of them cause rages<br/>
or just downright snarly nasty behaviors, or extreme<br/>
manic hyperactivity, sometimes for days.  We obviously<br/>
have to keep foods that are physically dangerous to<br/>
him out of his diet, but those which cause mood<br/>
swings, hyperactivity, hives, headaches, stomach aches<br/>
etc, are not physically dangerous, just uncomfortable<br/>
and/or annoying.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s no challenge to keep him from eating things which<br/>
cause overt reactions like vomiting or worse.  He&#39;s<br/>
not stupid.  But we choose not to be what we call &quot;the<br/>
food nazis&quot; if you&#39;ll forgive the expression, when it<br/>
comes to the less dangerous reactions.  We will remind<br/>
him when he is about to eat a food which we know will<br/>
likely cause some reactions, but we don&#39;t stop him. <br/>
We just want him to be prepared for the consequences<br/>
of eating it.  We try to help him through the<br/>
aftermath, and be patient with him while not allowing<br/>
him to abuse us just because he chose to eat something<br/>
which affects his judgement or self control.  We feel<br/>
that he will never be able to learn to manage his diet<br/>
and allergies or make good food choices without being<br/>
able to experiment, make mistakes and learn why a<br/>
certain food is not fun for him to eat, even if it<br/>
tastes good.  We tell our kids to listen to their<br/>
bodies, but how could they do that if we told them how<br/>
to feel all the time and strictly controlled what they<br/>
ate?  <br/>
  <br/>
We also know that his body is not a static thing.  He<br/>
may be able to handle a food allergen if he has not<br/>
had it in a while, or he doesn&#39;t have a lot of other<br/>
potential problem foods in his system at the same<br/>
time, or he is not processing environmental allergies<br/>
(like his severe dog allergy) at the same time, or<br/>
he&#39;s not overtired, sick, on a growth spurt or in some<br/>
other way overly taxed physically.  It&#39;s hard to say<br/>
at any given time whether he will be ok, or have a<br/>
reaction to the milder allergies.  We also do things<br/>
to help him process allergens, supplements to help his<br/>
liver and kidneys work more efficiently, and replacing<br/>
minerals and other things used up in processing toxins<br/>
(for him) so that his body is better able to handle<br/>
them.  If he&#39;s eating more things that can cause him<br/>
problems, we encourage him to step up the preventive<br/>
measure that help him to process them, so he can avoid<br/>
the problems and still live how he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
In this way we don&#39;t have to live on a restricting<br/>
diet, he can still have cake and ice cream at a<br/>
birthday party or dinner at grandma&#39;s without having<br/>
to have all his own special food, and most<br/>
importantly, he doesn&#39;t feel forced or coerced into<br/>
giving up the foods he loves at home, if he is willing<br/>
to pay the price for eating them.  He tends to avoid<br/>
things that cause him to rage and lose control of<br/>
himself and act monstrous, because he doesn&#39;t like<br/>
feeling out of control or burning up with anger or<br/>
having everyone upset with him.  But he had to learn<br/>
that by having the choice and living the aftermath,<br/>
many times.  He doesn&#39;t learn very readily from cause<br/>
and effect, so it took a while for it to sink in for<br/>
him, but it did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074428672">Nancy - that was a great post. It takes that kind of detail to really help<br/>
people understand how we live our lives ( that&#39;s why I&#39;m so bad at posting -<br/>
I just can&#39;t write for that long).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12342923">From the research I have read, there does seem to be a big increase in<br/>
diagnosed allergic reactions and the researchers seem to feel that the cause<br/>
was at least 4-fold.<br/>
<br/>
1) In the not so far past, people with severe allergic reactions simply died<br/>
so the genetic predisposition wasn&#39;t as strong (these folks didn&#39;t reproduce<br/>
as much as others because they didn&#39;t live as long)<br/>
<br/>
2) Increased awareness leading more people to be tested and diagnosed when<br/>
in the past, particularly with behavioral reactions, it simply would have<br/>
been written off as personality quirks.<br/>
<br/>
3) Our antiseptic lifestyles don&#39;t challenge our immune systems.  They are<br/>
often weak, not well organized and attack the wrong things.<br/>
<br/>
4) Environmental chemicals<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024115317">Some more thoughts on the allergy/tantrum discussion!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;But we choose not to be what we call &quot;the<br/>

<br/>
I agree that this might be a good plan of action when the child is older and can understand, but I find for my sanity and that of our family&#39;s that it pays to be careful as possible to avoid the problem food when the child is very young.  I will now and then try to re-introduce a little of the food and observe reactions.  If still the same, I once again try to avoid giving it to them while so little.  They also feel a heap better when I do this.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, sometimes, they may mistakenly take some of the problem food and we just have to deal with that the best we can!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Obviously we hear all about all the different<br/>
deprivation style diets and their magical results.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There is no need for deprivation style diets at all!  Just a change.  Eg., change from wheat grains to other grains.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We also know that his body is not a static thing.  He may be able to handle a food allergen if he has not had it in a while...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have found that when my children are older they can tolerate a little of the problem food but, if they eat it regularly, they are having the same trouble.  I guess this one depends on whether it is a food intolerance or a food allergy.  Food intolerances can be overcome, sometimes with just a break from the food in question for 3 months.  Whereas food allergies can be a lifelong problem.  I would be interested though to check out products that are reputed to help the body overcome allergies!<br/>
