<div id="ygrps-yiv-240135809">THE WATER<br/>
<br/>
It was one of the hottest days of the dry season. We had not seen<br/>
rain in almost a month. The crops were dying. Cows had stopped giving<br/>
milk. The creeks and streams were long gone back into the earth.<br/>
<br/>
It was a dry season that would bankrupt several farmers before it was<br/>
through. Every day, my husband and his brothers would go about the<br/>
arduous process of trying to get water to the fields.<br/>
<br/>
Lately this process had involved taking a truck to the local water<br/>
rendering plant and filling it up with water. But severe rationing<br/>
had cut everyone off. If we didn&#39;t see some rain soon...we would lose<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
It was on this day that I learned the true lesson of sharing and<br/>
witnessed the only miracle I have seen with my own eyes. I was in the<br/>
kitchen making lunch for my husband and his brothers when I saw my<br/>
six-year old son, Billy, walking toward the woods.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t walking with the usual carefree abandon of a youth but with<br/>
a serious purpose. I could only see his back. He was obviously<br/>
walking with a great effort...trying to be as still as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Minutes after he disappeared into the woods, he came running out<br/>
again, toward the house. I went back to making sandwiches; thinking<br/>
that whatever task he had been doing was completed. Moments later,<br/>
however, he was once again walking in that slow purposeful stride<br/>
toward the woods.<br/>
<br/>
This activity went on for an hour: walk carefully to the woods, run<br/>
back to the house. Finally I couldn&#39;t take it any longer and I crept<br/>
out of the house and followed him on his journey (being very careful<br/>
not to be seen...as he was obviously doing important work and didn&#39;t<br/>
need his Mommy checking up on him).<br/>
<br/>
He was cupping both hands in front of him as he walked; being very<br/>
careful not to spill the water he held in them...maybe two or three<br/>
tablespoons were held in his tiny hands. I sneaked close as he went<br/>
into the woods. Branches and thorns slapped his little face but he<br/>
did not try to avoid them. He had a much higher purpose. As I leaned<br/>
in to spy on him, I saw the most amazing site.<br/>
<br/>
Several large deer loomed in front of him. Billy walked right up to<br/>
them. I almost screamed for him to get away. A huge buck with<br/>
elaborate antlers was dangerously close. But the buck did not<br/>
threaten him...he didn&#39;t even move as Billy knelt down. And I saw a<br/>
tiny fawn laying on the ground, obviously suffering from dehydration<br/>
and heat exhaustion, lift its head with great effort to lap up the<br/>
water cupped in my beautiful boy&#39;s hand.<br/>
<br/>
When the water was gone, Billy jumped up to run back to the house and<br/>
I hid behind a tree. I followed him back to the house; to a spigot<br/>
that we had shut off the water to. Billy opened it all the way up and<br/>
a small trickle began to creep out. He knelt there, letting the drip,<br/>
drip slowly fill up his makeshift &quot;cup,&quot; as the sun beat down on his<br/>
little back. And it came clear to me. The trouble he had gotten into<br/>
for playing with the hose the week before. The lecture he had<br/>
received about the importance of not wasting water. The reason he<br/>
didn&#39;t ask me to help him.<br/>
<br/>
It took almost twenty minutes for the drops to fill his hands. When<br/>
he stood up and began the trek back, I was there in front of him. His<br/>
little eyes just filled with tears. &quot;I&#39;m not wasting,&quot; was all he<br/>
said. As he began his walk, I joined him...with a small pot of water<br/>
from the kitchen. I let him tend to the fawn. I stayed away. It was<br/>
his job. I stood on the edge of the woods watching the most beautiful<br/>
heart I have ever known working so hard to save another life.<br/>
<br/>
As the tears that rolled down my face began to hit the ground, they<br/>
were suddenly joined by other drops...and more drops...and more. I<br/>
looked up at the sky. It was as if God, himself, was weeping with<br/>
pride.<br/>
<br/>
Some will probably say that this was all just a huge coincidence.<br/>
That miracles don&#39;t really exist. That it was bound to rain sometime.<br/>
And I can&#39;t argue with that...I&#39;m not going to try. All I can say is<br/>
that the rain that came that day saved our farm...just like that<br/>
actions of one little boy saved another.<br/>
