<div id="ygrps-yiv-901020350">Since you guys are talking about arranged marriages, I hope you won&#39;t <br/>
mind if I share this strange and interesting story with you.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up on the north shore of Long Island in Port Washington, NY.  My <br/>
brother&#39;s best friend was the son of an Indian Sikh father and a <br/>
Malaysian mother.  The parents, years earlier, had fallen in love and <br/>
married - definitely not an arranged marriage!  They moved to NY when <br/>
their son was still a little boy so he grew up in a very western <br/>
environment.  Both his parents were very well-educated and were really <br/>
very sophisticated people and very comfortable in our society.<br/>
<br/>
He grew up to be a personable, intelligent and handsome young man.  <br/>
Following  his formal education he moved to Hawaii and started dating.  <br/>
After a few years, he decided he wanted to get married, but had not <br/>
found anyone special.  So, he asked his parents if they would go to <br/>
India and choose a wife for him!  They were thrilled to do this for <br/>
him.  They travelled to India and met with several families where they <br/>
were introduced to some young ladies.  They found a young woman that <br/>
they thought would be suitable for him, the arrangements were made and <br/>
they got married.  That was about 13 years ago.  They have 3 kids and <br/>
are very happily married.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thrilled that this worked out for them, but I always thought that <br/>
was such a strange story.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; was that their daughters<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; didn&#39;t need college as they would only be getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; married and having children<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as soon as they finished &quot;high school&quot;.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; That doesn&#39;t sound like &quot;arranged marriages&quot;.  It just<br/>
&gt; &gt; sounds like the parent&#39;s wishes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I am a Christian in a huge protestant evangelical<br/>
&gt; &gt; church here in VA, and although courtship is<br/>
&gt; &gt; definitely encouraged, I have not heard a thing about<br/>
&gt; &gt; arranged marriages within the Christian community.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s too bad that generalizations are applied across<br/>
&gt; &gt; the board to an entire group of people, based on the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1163003368">Here&#39;s something I&#39;ve thought about a lot. Does anyone else have any <br/>
discomfort about all the very young marriages that seem to be happening among <br/>
homeschoolers? I don&#39;t even mean among the Christian homeschoolers, where one <br/>
might expect it...but in reading HEM and in other contexts, SO many very <br/>
young (like under 21) people seem to be getting married. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think a marriage among young people is doomed to fail, but I do <br/>
wonder what&#39;s going on? IS this a trend? Any ideas on this, anyone?<br/>

<br/>
The only way to get a 50th anniversary is to start early, and lots of couples <br/>
have 50th anniversaries.<br/>
<br/>
If I had married my teen/college boyfriend I think I&#39;d&#39;ve been really happy.  <br/>
We should&#39;ve just hooked it up then, and not messed with the ensuing <br/>
this&#39;n&#39;that.  But &quot;wait&quot; just for the sake of waiting, because your birthday <br/>
hasn&#39;t come, is another artificial stricture of our culture.  We&#39;re used to <br/>
telling kids &quot;wait.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the opportunity has passed and people settle for second-best house, <br/>
job, spouse, friend, car, idea...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure people under 21 have often gotten married, but some are <br/>
made/encouraged to wait until &quot;after college&quot; (which follows the things they <br/>
have to wait to do after high school).  SO... if we devalue college, as <br/>
unschooling parents, and say &quot;whatever&quot; and &quot;whenever&quot; about a hundred <br/>
things, then what&#39;s the bar/deadline/magic threshhold for kids to consider <br/>
bonding for life?<br/>
<br/>
Have we brought this on ourselves?<br/>
<br/>
(And is it really happening?  I&#39;ve written all the above on the assumption <br/>
that &quot;it&quot; is a fact, but I&#39;m not sure it is.)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it is happening, but it wouldn&#39;t surprise me. I&#39;ve thought <br/>
for a long time that our culture infantalizes teens and young adults (while <br/>
at the same time oversexualizing them - weird combination). So they are <br/>
usually not ready to be married at an early age. Homeschoolers OTOH have been <br/>
out in the world more, had more genuine experience and opportunities to <br/>
develop maturity. I think they just might be more ready to be married early <br/>
than a lot of us.<br/>

goodbye&quot; by Joshua Harris, and Josh has spoken at our<br/>

<br/>
He does not talk about arranged marriages.<br/>

Perhaps there is a misunderstanding about what is<br/>
meant by courtship, and it is  being confused with<br/>
arranged marriages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547254187">Kathryn,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve certainly been uncomfortable about my son&#39;s marriage. He got <br/>
married just over a year ago at age 19 to a 16yo homeschooler. They are <br/>
expecting their first baby in February (and no, she wasn&#39;t preganant <br/>
when they got married &lt;g&gt;). They have been in love since he was 16 and <br/>
she was 13. Dated other people, but always came back to each other. We <br/>
aren&#39;t christians. When I suggested that they could live together for <br/>
awhile before getting married (like dh and I did) I was given a <br/>
withering look that made me feel like a dirty old woman! Well, I guess <br/>
they all have to go through their rebellious stage! But somehow though <br/>
it seemed natural to rebel against my parents back at the end of the <br/>
sixties, I hadn&#39;t considered that my kids might go prudish on me &lt;g&gt; <br/>
Especially considering they were into partying and drink and Having Fun. <br/>
Since getting pregnant though, it&#39;s back to the family values. No more <br/>
smoking, drinking. Any suggestions of hospital births, vaccination or <br/>
school for their precious baby are shot down in flames!<br/>
<br/>
They seem very happy. All I can do is hope it lasts. Erin&#39;s mother was <br/>
only just 17 when she got married, and had her first son a year later. <br/>
They are still happily married with six kids. So here&#39;s hoping. I do <br/>
love them both :-) And I am looking forward to the home birth of my <br/>
grandchild, to which I have been invited :-)<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t answer any of your questions except that, yes, I am <br/>
uncomfortable about it.<br/>

was married when I was 19, had our next children when I was 20, 22, and our <br/>
newest member of the family is due when I will be 24.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been married for nearly five years, have had ups and downs like every <br/>
marriage, but have made it through, though only by the grace of God!  <br/>
Actually, down here where we live, NONE of my friends had children or got <br/>
married early.  None at all.  I was the only married one amongst my friends <br/>
for 4 years!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay.  Did it.  At Google.com.   There is lots about<br/>
courtship, about Christian courtship, about courtship<br/>
and marriage, etc.  But not a thing about arranged<br/>
marriages in our society.  Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
So, I typed in christian+arranged marriages.  Again,<br/>
NOTHING about arranged marriages in the christian<br/>
community in the USA.  LOTS about arranged marriages<br/>
in India and even Australia, though.  But that is a<br/>
cultural thing, not a &quot;christian&quot; thing.<br/>
<br/>
So, again I propose that there is either an erroneous<br/>
assumption being made that courtship and arranged<br/>
marriage is the same thing (it is not), Or that<br/>
someone comparing the two does not understand the<br/>
difference in the two terms.<br/>

someone who was describing why they did NOT any longer promote courtship, but <br/>
promoted &quot;betrothal&quot; (which looks a whole lot like an arranged marriage to <br/>
me) instead. I meant to say put in: betrothal, not courtship. (Although even <br/>
courtship, as it is often explained, sounds like arranged marriage in some <br/>
cases. I mean, it sounds like an arranged marriage almost exactly like my <br/>
friend from India had -- her parents found her the guy and they were <br/>
introduced. She had the right to say no if she really thought he was a <br/>
terrible match, but as she told me, &quot;My mother is my &#39;well-wisher&#39; and I <br/>
trust her choice and don&#39;t think I could do better.&quot; On the other hand, <br/>
people I know who have practiced courtship have often looked liked serial <br/>
dating, with dad choosing the dates &lt;G&gt;. <br/>
<br/>
No easy answers.<br/>

&lt;&lt; It&#39;s too bad that generalizations are applied across<br/>
the board to an entire group of people, based on the<br/>
practice of a few individuals/subgroups. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t happen.  The question was why someone suggested early marriages <br/>
might be more likely among Christians, and this was the answer.  We&#39;re <br/>
talking generalizations in the first place.  <br/>
<br/>
Being defensive and testy isn&#39;t a good thing for this list.  Those who wish <br/>
to participate in this list needs to be able to discuss issues and not people.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am a Christian in a huge protestant evangelical<br/>
church here in VA, and although courtship is<br/>
definitely encouraged, I have not heard a thing about<br/>
arranged marriages within the Christian community.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just because a person hasn&#39;t heard it doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So, again I propose that there is either an erroneous<br/>
assumption being made that courtship and arranged<br/>
marriage is the same thing (it is not), Or that<br/>
someone comparing the two does not understand the<br/>
difference in the two terms.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Did you enter Christian arranged marriage?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read two articles in the past several months.  One in Focus on the <br/>
Family (paper) and the other in Home School Digest (website).<br/>
<br/>
The idea that Christian homeschooled girls don&#39;t need college is promoted by <br/>
SEVERAL factions within the &quot;more conservative than thou&quot; Christian <br/>
homeschooling community.  There&#39;s one curriculum that has a different set of <br/>
materials for boys and girls.<br/>
<br/>
The article in Focus on the Family (I think that was the one) was dismissive <br/>
of courtship saying it was just a form of Christian dating, and that if girls <br/>
were going to be submissive and obedient they&#39;d marnumber do and will.<br/>
<br/>
Christian symbolism is based very much on shepherds and sheep.  When a <br/>
religious leader of a group that is making all KINDS of life decisions based <br/>
on what he says says courtship is sinful, they&#39;ll abandon that practice in a <br/>
heartbeat.<br/>
<br/>
There are Christian leaders who are critical of adoption, of families having <br/>
other adults living in the home (relatives or not), of ANY rock music <br/>
(including Christian rock), and there are families who give them money to <br/>
tell them MORE to do and MORE exactly how to live their lives.  <br/>
<br/>
The fact that those exist doesn&#39;t generalize to all Christians.  The fact <br/>
that some Christians have never even heard of those things doesn&#39;t negate <br/>
their existence.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;We have a rather unique Solstice Celebration...we<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;a birthday party!  It is my birthday :-)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And my granddaughter&#39;s.  She&#39;ll be 7 on your<br/>
&gt; &gt; birthday.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Tia<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That is so wonderful!  Being a Solstice/Christmas<br/>
&gt; season baby is so fun!  For years I thought all the<br/>
&gt; lights and decorations were just for my birthday! LOL<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I actually have two &quot;birthdays&quot; since my parents used<br/>
&gt; to celebrate my adoption day as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; They were always careful to make sure my birthday was<br/>
&gt; special and separate from Christmas as much as<br/>
&gt; possible, right down to a full force birthday party<br/>
&gt; even though they were worn out with holiday stuff.<br/>
&gt; Although some of my presents inevitably arrive wrapped<br/>
&gt; in christmas paper these days.  ;-)<br/>

post, it came up with all sorts of hits for India and<br/>
Australia (haven&#39;t figured out the aussy one yet!),<br/>
but nothing that I could find for USA.<br/>
<br/>
Like you said, it doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t there or<br/>
doesn&#39;t exist, I just haven&#39;t heard of it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; In the last several years, the term &quot;courtship&quot; has become more and more<br/>
&gt; popular among Christian circles to describe various methods of engaging in a<br/>
&gt; serious romantic relationship. For some Christians, courtship means an<br/>
&gt; approach to marriage that is almost the same thing as an arranged marriage.<br/>
&gt; Your parents pick your future mate and there is hardly any one-on-one contact<br/>
&gt; before marriage. For others, it means the same thing as a serious dating<br/>
&gt; relationship. You decide to court someone when you are thinking about perhaps<br/>
&gt; marrying that person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Still others use the term &quot;courtship&quot; to describe a set of biblical principles<br/>
&gt; that Christians should follow in their approach to romance. These principles<br/>
&gt; usually include: 1) Seeking and receiving the approval of parents before<br/>
&gt; entering into a romantic relationship; 2) Waiting to start a serious<br/>
&gt; relationship until you are at the age where you could consider getting<br/>
&gt; married; 3) Entering into the relationship with the purpose of pursuing the<br/>
&gt; idea of marriage, not just going out for fun with no serious intentions; and<br/>
&gt; 4) Setting high standards for physical purity.<br/>
&gt; I think that the four principles listed above are important for every<br/>
&gt; Christian to follow. Whether you want to call it courtship or dating doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; matter. The principles are what&#39;s important. For more info on why they&#39;re so<br/>
&gt; important, check out my previous columns about relationships in my archives. I<br/>
&gt; almost always include a discussion on at least one of these four principles<br/>
&gt; when I write about relationships.<br/>

&gt; &gt; homeschoolers? I don&#39;t even mean among the Christian homeschoolers, <br/>

&gt; Just curious, Kathryn, why would you expect it among Christian <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No judgements intended. I&#39;ve just read a lot about moves in conservative <br/>
Christian communities toward eliminating dating (courtship) in favor of <br/>
parent-arranged marriages, often at an earlier age. <br/>
<br/>
Even not considering that, Mary Hood talked a little about early marriages <br/>
among homeschoolers at a conference I attended.  (She disapproved.  <br/>
Sidenote--I attended this conference not knowing how traditional it was going <br/>
to be, as one of the keynote speakers was David Albert.  Having early in our <br/>
homeschooling career picked up at the library a sweet little book called &quot;Out <br/>
of the Yellow Bus and into the Gates of Hell -- or something like it-- I <br/>
expected to loathe Mary Hood. Actually, she wasn&#39;t that bad.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121348217">I also have an arranged marriage story.<br/>
In my college days I took a class with a young woman from India. She was<br/>
probably 20 or so. She told us that her marriage was arranged and that this<br/>
was a very common practice in her caste (?). She told us the story of how<br/>
they were introduced about 2 weeks before the wedding. Our small group of<br/>
female students was fascinated by the trust in her parents and willingness<br/>
to go along with a practice that to us was completely bizarre and outdated.<br/>
(and the fact that she actually loved this virtual stranger) About halfway<br/>
through the semester I bumped into the young woman and her husband at the<br/>
mall. This guy was GEORGEOUS!!!! Like a movie star. Boy did she get lucky.<br/>
He also was a very nice man - which I know is more important than looks but<br/>
what a BONUS!<br/>
LOL<br/>
