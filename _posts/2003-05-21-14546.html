You know, I just want to comment that I catch myself sometimes thinking along <br/>
the lines of &quot;I used to enjoy foreign languages&quot; or &quot;I used to enjoy drawing&quot; <br/>
assuming that since I have kids now, my interests are no longer important and <br/>
should be ignored. This list has tweaked my thinking a bit and now I feel <br/>
like it&#39;s okay for me to develop myself, and my kids benefit from seeing me <br/>
do interesting things and having an interesting mom. I feel freer to learn <br/>
Italian online, take my sketchbook when we go to the park or museum and try <br/>
recipes that nobody might like but me. Usually it turns out that the kids <br/>
join in me in learning a little Italian, drawing their own pictures, or <br/>
helping me cook!<br/>
<br/>
Just a few rambling thoughts.<br/>
