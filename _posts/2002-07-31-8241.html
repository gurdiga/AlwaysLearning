Agonizing over it sometimes, and finally all the pieces fell into place.<br/>
It&#39;s<br/>
a different story from those of kids who read later because they weren&#39;t<br/>
interested until later, for whom learning to read was fairly simple once<br/>
they<br/>
decided to do it.<br/>
<br/>
This was the situation for my oldest son too Deborah.  He wanted to read<br/>
because others his age and younger could.  It made him feel stupid.  Some<br/>
phonics programs created more problems than they solved and he just didn&#39;t<br/>
get it.  Reading is still coming slowly - not a &quot;and then one day he took<br/>
off and read the great novel&quot;.  He is nearly 12 and can read nearly any sign<br/>
or label or short description, he can read comics, but a book is still a<br/>
challenge for him.  Once he makes a mistake it is hard for him to get back<br/>
into the rhythm somehow.  Other things come easily to him so it has been a<br/>
big surprise.  I don&#39;t understand so it is a struggle to help him and I have<br/>
to leave it to him to tell me what he needs.  E-mailing and IM are helping<br/>
with spelling and that helps with reading so we move slowly forward.<br/>
I agree with Deborah&#39;s label - When reading doesn&#39;t come easily.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s<br/>

Perhaps this group are &quot;when reading comes later&quot;.  My younger son didn&#39;t<br/>
read very early either but it never bothered him and it didn&#39;t frustrate<br/>
him.  He can always read what he has to read or wants to read but still<br/>
doesn&#39;t read that well - at least out loud.  However, he is reading Lord of<br/>
the Rings now so I guess he does well enough for himself.<br/>
<br/>
Having patience to wait for my sons to figure out reading has been my most<br/>
difficult challenge as a homeschooler.  It is so visible to others that it<br/>
becomes a target to prove I am doing the wrong thing by my children.  It has<br/>
taken a leap of faith to trust that it will come.  I read everything I could<br/>
get my hands on but none of the interventions made sense to me.  The &quot;most<br/>
highly recommended method of teaching dyslexics&quot; to read seemed so contrary<br/>
to what my son would respond to that I couldn&#39;t make myself do it.  I<br/>
suspect the only intervention that would have helped would have been the one<br/>
that I did at the right time.  So, I have saved a lot of money, eaten quite<br/>
a bit of humble pie and I see the light at the end of the tunnel.  I look<br/>
forward to the day that I can confidently write an article about &quot;When<br/>
reading doesn&#39;t come easily&quot; because my boys are reading any book that is<br/>
out there.  But I am not there yet - not quite.<br/>
