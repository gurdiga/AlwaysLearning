**I had a reassuring<br/>
&gt; discussion with my dh who agreed with me that our son seems to learn<br/>
&gt; best from videos, games and taking walks.**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I was gone for a couple of days this weekend,  my son was home with my dh.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning my dh says  &quot;I am totally behind you on it being OK for<br/>
Alec to be on the PS2 as much as he wants.&quot;   Cool!     Tim, dh, has always<br/>
been pretty supportive of my unschooling choices, but he must have still<br/>
been questioning the time that Alec spends on games.<br/>
<br/>
They bought a Final Fantasy X game at a pawn shop this weekend and Alec<br/>
spent most of Saturday researching information on the computer.  The reason<br/>
it was so cheap at the pawn shop was because it came without an instruction<br/>
book.  Well,  with the internet and all,  no problem!<br/>
