Some parents come to this list and they want to be children here.   <br/>
But the purpose of this list is to discuss unschooling in ways that  <br/>
will help those who come to read.  I was reminded recently that for  <br/>
any discussion about one situation here, two hundred people probably  <br/>
benefit.  It&#39;s very likely.  Of the 1800 or so people listed, I  <br/>
figure 300-400 forgot they were on the list, another 200 might be  <br/>
duplicates or bounces, and that still leaves 1000 and some reading.    <br/>
Some scan for their favorite topics, or check in when it gets really  <br/>
busy to see what the excitement way.  Of those who do find life- <br/>
changing benefit, some write about it on their blogs and some to  <br/>
their friends and some actually e-mail me and say something.  Those  <br/>
are collected (not all of them, but some) here:<br/>

<br/>
So of that large number there are a few who are deeply angsty about  <br/>
something or another.  Some have unresolved or unexamined childhood  <br/>
issues.  Some are living with some dishonesty that&#39;s making them  <br/>
touchy.  Some are afraid for real or imagined reasons.  Some of that  <br/>
makes it difficult for them to contribute materially or substantially  <br/>
to an unschooling discussion.<br/>
<br/>
I think mental health can come from unschooling and sometimes people  <br/>
for the first time in their lives feel right and good and whole, when  <br/>
unschooling is going well.  And by mental health I don&#39;t mean just  <br/>
the absence of mental illness, I mean vibrant, strong,  FULLness.     <br/>
Joyous strength.<br/>
<br/>
So I think successful unschooling can produce joy and health.<br/>
And I think this list can help people get to successful unschooling.<br/>
But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the purpose of this list to get people to  <br/>
mental health.<br/>
<br/>
So when people are needy and insecure, we can help them with  <br/>
unschooling, but those other needs should probably be dealt with in  <br/>
places designed for that (IF the needs are really deep):  church, 12  <br/>
step programs, some kind of therapy, for the good of the kids.<br/>
