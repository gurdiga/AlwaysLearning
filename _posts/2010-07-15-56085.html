<div id="ygrps-yiv-1520013800">dear everybody,<br/>
<br/>
I wrote recently about my brain damage because of Lyme&#39;s disease and <br/>
unfortunately I&#39;m ill again. My left eye and eye-nerve is so infected that I <br/>
can&#39;t see with this eye, and the brain is infected again. I&#39;m in and out of the <br/>
hospital every day, undergoing severe treatment to for now get rid of the <br/>
symptoms and hopefully eventually recover.<br/>
My husband and son (18) have taken over the household chores and my husband is <br/>
taking me back and forth to the hospital, and are coping well with this sudden <br/>
change and fear, but my daughter (8) is shattered. She could stay for four days <br/>
with good friends, which was good for all of us, but since she is home she is <br/>
afraid to go from my side. I try to arrange a couple of hours a day with friends <br/>
and playgroups, especially when I&#39;m in the hospital, but she has mixed feelings <br/>
about it. She wants to go and enjoys herself when she is there but wants to be <br/>
with me too. She is very angry that I am ill again and I acknowledge her in this <br/>
feeling. She had to deal with my illness, recovery and again illness since <br/>
December last year and she want the mother she had back. It is painful for me to <br/>
see her missing a lot of fun things we used to do, she misses my energy, and she <br/>
is, as we are afraid for the future. I try to do things together we both like to <br/>
do, like watch nature movies together, and play games in bed, and cuddle and <br/>
talk, and watch her play computer games, but it&#39;s not really fulfilling her <br/>
needs. She suddenly wants to soothe herself with a lot of sweets, which i don&#39;t <br/>
mind so much but it is not filling her need as well. It helps a little to eat <br/>
chocolate and cookies but after eating she is still sad.<br/>
I don&#39;t have a very supporting family nearby, who will help out. Friends do a <br/>
lot, but have their own lives to deal with.<br/>
Does anybody have idea&#39;s to help her with her anger and what to do with her <br/>
fears? Or idea&#39;s how to pass long and boring days with an sick mother for a 8 <br/>
year old?<br/>
<br/>
greetings, Josh<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry Josh - sucks to be so happy that you&#39;d licked it and then have it <br/>
come back. It really sounds like you&#39;re doing the best you can with your <br/>
daughter - the reality is it does suck, I don&#39;t think you can change <br/>
that for her. You probably are already being very reassuring that she is <br/>
going to be fine - that&#39;s important because at 8 she&#39;s still pretty <br/>
self-focused and worried about what&#39;s going to happen to her. Can her <br/>
dad and her brother spend just a bit more time with her? Even if it was <br/>
just a few minutes at a time, their focused attention would probably <br/>
calm her a bit - make her not feel alone. I know that&#39;s a lot to ask of <br/>
them, they&#39;re trying to cope themselves and take care of businesses, <br/>
etc., but if they can take even just a minute to cuddle with her, pat <br/>
her as they walk past, maybe sit beside her for a minute while she&#39;s <br/>
watching tv or something. Is it too difficult to have another child over <br/>
to play with her? Maybe there is a quiet and easy kid who could play <br/>
with her but she&#39;d still be at home with you. If friends ask what they <br/>
can do to help, ask if someone will come over and hang out with their <br/>
kid and yours so that yours has someone to play with, without leaving <br/>
the house.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hi - YES i know this feeling quite well. i have several disabilities, but<br/>
the one that impacts our family the most is CFIDS, chronic fatigue syndrome.<br/>
i always, always feel ill; would much rather be in bed resting; and planning<br/>
is an issue because i never know how i will feel or if i will be able to<br/>
move around. our 8yr old daughter has grown up with me like this, so it is a<br/>
bit different than your situation. we do a lot in bed or lying down -<br/>
reading (me reading to her, or reading next to each other), watching tv in<br/>
the LR with me on the couch, playing games with me lying on the floor,<br/>
cooking in the kitchen with me sitting on the stool.<br/>
<br/>
she knows that she can come to me at any time and talk or work on something<br/>
together - i may not have the energy to fully participate, but i try my best<br/>
to be interested and watch.<br/>
<br/>
it&#39;s pretty hard. but, i AM able to tell her how much i love her, all the<br/>
time, and be together all the time, even if it isn&#39;t playing outside, or<br/>
running around, or other ways that she sees families interact in our<br/>
neighborhood. we swim in our lake - she swims, i float on a noodle. i&#39;ve<br/>
worked out ways to be with her and not expend much energy.<br/>
<br/>
hope this helps - i am always happy to email off-list, if you need someone<br/>
to listen.  it&#39;s a very, very difficult situation. cheers, jessie<br/>

Thanks, this morning he took some time in bed to play her favorite game from <br/>
when she was much smaller, a fantasy game they used to play. We ended up <br/>
giggling and cuddling and she was so relieved that that is still possible. <br/>
Yesterday we both spend a lot of time crying, that helped too. She is more <br/>
relaxed to know that she is allowed to be sad. For me it helped too, I tried to <br/>
be strong but it made me distanced from my real feelings and that frightend her. <br/>
To be able to be sad together about the whole situation brought us close and <br/>
that helped.<br/>
