<div id="ygrps-yiv-2050350518">I&#39;ve been doing a lot of thinking about non-cohersive parenting, and kept <br/>
saying to myself, &quot;I don&#39;t THINK we coherse Julian into much.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I DO remind, but I don&#39;t know if we just have a mellow kid. Julian has no <br/>
deep objections to doing things like brush his teeth, but most of the time it <br/>
doesn&#39;t occur to him. If I say, &quot;Why don&#39;t you go brush your teeth during the <br/>
commercial?&quot; when we&#39;re watching tv, he&#39;ll generally just do it. He usually <br/>
goes to bed when we do, because he likes Beth to read to him before bed and <br/>
if he stays up too late she&#39;ll be asleep. Sometimes he&#39;ll read for a while <br/>
after, or he&#39;ll just turn out the light. We don&#39;t really have assigned <br/>
&quot;chores,&quot; but he usually does all the laundry. <br/>
<br/>
He watches a lot of tv at night with us, but usually plays at the same time. <br/>
He plays computer games for many hours at a time sometimes. <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll ask me to nudge him about writing, because the idea of writing isn&#39;t <br/>
fun for him, but he loves having written. (Once he&#39;s started, he likes to do <br/>
it.)<br/>
<br/>
Julian is twelve, and he&#39;s already six inches taller than me, and sweet and <br/>
quite lovely. He still likes to cuddle a lot, an initiates holding my hand in <br/>
public, often. We&#39;ve been asked not to call him &quot;Puff&quot; or &quot;sweetie&quot; or other <br/>
lovie names in front of friends, but definitely in private.  He&#39;s VERY <br/>
smart-- amazes me sometimes. He just read 1984 and had some brilliant <br/>
insights that I never would have thought of.<br/>
