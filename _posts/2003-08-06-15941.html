<div id="ygrps-yiv-806550416">Also, (sorry for the intrusion again) what about the Low Country and Gullah?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for connections that Will can make to the place we might stay.  <br/>
Something to interest him.  He&#39;s only remotely interested in the Civil War, but <br/>
Charleston would be great for that.  He used to like that show Gullah Gullah <br/>
Island on Nick.  (He probably still likes it--we don&#39;t have cable.)  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe Gullah is not much of a tourist attraction for that area, but maybe <br/>
there&#39;s a museum or something?  I&#39;m googling, but insight from locals is always <br/>
helpful.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, this can&#39;t be right.  On the SC state parks site, it says camping fees <br/>
are $1 per night?  How can that be?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, y&#39;all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>  I lived in Charleston for 8 years. We actually didn&#39;t enjoy Myrtle Beach <br/>
much (as adults) There are lots of teenagers on spring break or at least acting <br/>
like it....it&#39;s quite the party place. There are some arcades, go-karts, water <br/>
slides for young kids though and the beach is nice, though crowded. I would <br/>
recommend Folly Beach or Isle of Palms which are both maybe half an hour from <br/>
Charleston.<br/>
  I understand that Charleston has a great aquarium now.. &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://206.74.146.33/scaquarium/scaweb/index.htm&quot;">http://206.74.146.33/scaquarium/scaweb/index.htm&quot;</a>&gt;The South Carolina <br/>
Aquarium: Charleston&#39;s Most Visited Attraction&lt;/A&gt; There&#39;s a great downtown market <br/>
where you will see women weaving baskets (I believe they are part of the <br/>
Gullah culture. ) This is near the Battery which looks out over Charleston Harbor <br/>
and where you can see Fort Sumter on a clear day. You can take horse-drawn <br/>
carriage rides and bus tours which are very imformative pertaining to the city&#39;s <br/>
history. There are also boat tours which go out to Fort Sumter.<br/>
  Guess this could have gone off-list but I miss Charleston badly and thought <br/>
others might find it interesting. Have a cup of she-crab soup for me!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-101275957">Hi Tuck!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to Myrtle Beach for 2 nights after the conference - staying<br/>
Monday and Tuesday night.<br/>
My husband did some checking and researching on the internet and concluded<br/>
(from people&#39;s comments and such) that many of the places to stay in Myrtle<br/>
Beach are &quot;dives&quot; and can be expensive dives, at that.<br/>
<br/>
He found favorable comments about the Monterey Bay Suites Hotel - so that&#39;s<br/>
where we&#39;re staying! We booked through Cheap Rooms (www.travelnow.com). The<br/>
pictures and ads that we&#39;ve seen look impressive, so I hope it&#39;s a nice<br/>
place. We also had to get a beach fix before leaving SC - being so close to<br/>
the ocean. :-)<br/>
