<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957624272">Sandra, i find your lack of willingness to truly<br/>
understand the need for children to have healthy<br/>
protection, particularly your willingness to leave<br/>
children alone with known perpetrators, alarming and<br/>
disturbing.  I have said nothing about keeping<br/>
childern away from all adults, nor society in general.<br/>
 I am saying that children are vulnerable and because<br/>
of this they need protection.  We can not be<br/>
absolutely sure about anything, but i do know that if<br/>
someone is already exhibiting signs of boundary<br/>
violations, then  children may be vulnerable in their<br/>
presence.  This site is called always learning, are<br/>
you so right about this that you are unwilling to<br/>
learn something new when the opportunity presents<br/>
itself. Perhaps it is time for you to do your own<br/>
homework. Your off the cuff comments are insensitive.<br/>
It amazes me that someone with your authority about<br/>
homeschooling is actually so out of touch with the<br/>
true needs of a child.  I actually am happy to<br/>
unsubscribe from this group based on the ignorance<br/>
that you, as the list leader exhibits.  I will not<br/>
support a list that is moderated by someone so<br/>
unprepared to speak up for the rights of a child.    -<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; One more thought about sexual abuse.  Sandra when<br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; suggest that empowering the child to say no is<br/>
&gt; adequate <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; protection, what happens when that isn&#39;t enough? <br/>
&gt; Does that <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; mean that it is the child&#39;s fault that they weren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; strong enough?  It <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; is not such a big leap to conclude this if you truly<br/>
&gt; believe that all a <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; child needs is education and a &quot;force field&quot; in<br/>
&gt; order to be <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; protected.  Surey our children can not be held<br/>
&gt; accountable for an <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; adults transgressions.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then keep your children away from adults.  <br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a first time for everything.  Someone who&#39;s<br/>
&gt; not YET a molester might <br/>
&gt; start with your child.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Keep them away from teenagers, too.  And other<br/>
&gt; children.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe if you were abused yourself, that puts you at<br/>
&gt; risk to be an abuser.  <br/>
