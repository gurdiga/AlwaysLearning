<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290120071">As I stated several days (or weeks? time flies when you&#39;re having  <br/>
fun) ago, I had some ideas for parents who need to just walk away  <br/>
from cooking. I think saving time altogether by using shortcuts is a  <br/>
great idea, so here&#39;s the link to my blog about cooking. It&#39;s the top  <br/>
entry. I&#39;ll try to do a cleaning one in the next week or so.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-986321990">Thanks Melissa, that was interesting. I rarely cook for more than 30 minutes as we live on pasta, rice, stir fries. All home made but it just doesn&#39;t take long. When I&#39;m feeling lazy they have beans on toast. the older 3 often make their own meals now although I will remind them about the need for fruit and vegetables. B would live on plain pasta with tomato ketchup stirred in for ever!<br/>
  C can&#39;t eat pasta so she gets mashed up advocado&#39;s or mashed sweet potato.<br/>
  I can no longer imagine a meal that takes hours to prpare!<br/>
  Looking forward to the cleaning one. I hate cleaning with a passion and do less than an hour a day. I make sure the kitchen is clean, vacuum the &#39;lived in&#39; floor and ignore everything else. There will be time when I&#39;m old with nothing else to do ;-)<br/>
  My goal is to get a dishwasher but do they really save time?<br/>
   <br/>
