<div id="ygrps-yiv-391069347">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I let the day unfold. Tim and I decided to plan extra activieties for Riley<br/>
and Tessa. We watched Spiderman again. It was due in at 6pm. We started it at<br/>
3:30. I helped Ashley curl her hair and wrap presents. I left my daughter and<br/>
came back hope. We ate fish sticks and peas. Riley&#39;s #1 dinner. We will go<br/>
drive around looking at lights later. My friend had a hard time lookinh me in<br/>
the eye. I spoke with her hubby and MIL instead. No tantrums so far this year<br/>
for Riley. Tessa went with me to drop Ashley off, gave the birthday girl a<br/>
flowering jade plant from our little nursery, and willing left with me. So far<br/>
it appears all the kids are getting their needs met. Thank you for listening.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1939025245"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Has anyone read about the forms of girl aggression?<br/>
&gt;My hubby told me about a book which addresses this<br/>
&gt;issue and it turns out that girls/women are<br/>
&gt;aggressive by excluding. If you know the author, let<br/>
&gt;my know.<br/>
&gt;Mary H.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have discussed that book with others, which got so<br/>
much attention in the press, and I think that theory<br/>
is bull****.  At least, as far as being exclusive to<br/>
females.  Boys and men do it just as much, that power<br/>
play, shift of favor, excluding, good ol boys, bla<br/>
bla.  My husband, and most men I am sure, can recount<br/>
tales of the subtle dichotomy of &quot;picking teams&quot; or<br/>
who eats with whom at school lunch, or even who goes<br/>
to which meetings, lunches and parties in an adult<br/>
professional world.  We just discussed this recently,<br/>
so his thoughts and mine are clear in my memory.<br/>
<br/>
As far as kids being excluded, well it&#39;s true that<br/>
life is sometimes unfair, but friends should not be<br/>
rude to each other.  Kids&#39; and adults should be able<br/>
to invite just who they want to their own parties,<br/>
just so long as they understand that they could be<br/>
bruising some egos, stepping on some toes, or even<br/>
losing some friends over it.  It&#39;s a sticky social<br/>
problem.  How many people agonize over who to invite<br/>
to weddings or holiday parites?  How many people<br/>
invite family members who really are not a part of<br/>
their lives, just to avoid offending them, or invite<br/>
people for reasons OTHER than desiring their presence<br/>
(like not wanting to offend their mother-in-law by<br/>
leaving out her old friend Edna whom you find<br/>
overbearing, or whatever.)<br/>
<br/>
We usually stick to family only for parties, but then<br/>
my kids don&#39;t have a very large social circle yet.  So<br/>
we have largely been able to avoid these kinds of<br/>
difficult situations.  My husband and I even &quot;eloped&quot;<br/>
when we got married, largely to avoid the complication<br/>
of a large wedding and the invitations and social<br/>
entanglements.  It meant no wedding gifts, but was a<br/>
small price to pay for a lovely, romatic, stress free<br/>
wedding celebration.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s an ettiquette question.  Sandra is right<br/>
that you should be able to invite whoever you want. <br/>
But the situation where the one boy was excluded for<br/>
no apparent real reason (other boys his age, siblings<br/>
and neighbors were invited) seems harsh.  It hurts to<br/>
be excluded, no matter how old you are, particularly<br/>
when there is no real reason you were left out, aside<br/>
from that you were not wanted.  But I concur with the<br/>
sentiment that life is what you make of it, and &quot;when<br/>
life gives you lemons, make lemonade!&quot;  It&#39;s a hard<br/>
lesson for a six year old, but an important one for<br/>
him to learn to focus on the positive and that he is<br/>
responsible for his own happiness and how he views and<br/>
responds to challenges in his life.<br/>

While you pretend to rummage in your bag for your Lesbian ID, you should set <br/>
out on the counter an Indigo girls tape and ticket stubs from a Melissa <br/>
Etheridge concert, or Lillith Fair.  They might be afraid to know what else <br/>
you&#39;re going to set out on the counter.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s really kind of an odd discount to offer.  Then again, I never even ask <br/>
for a homeschooler&#39;s discount.  I figure living in the real world means just <br/>
living in the real world, not expecting Borders or Barnes & Noble to give me <br/>
20% off on books.    Now the discount at the gaming shop, THAT I don&#39;t want <br/>
to miss.<br/>

I think the idea for homeschooler&#39;s discounts grew out of teacher&#39;s<br/>
discounts, which seem to aim to support literacy and acknowledge that<br/>
teacher&#39;s are underpaid.<br/>

teachers spend a lot of their own moeny for classroom materials.<br/>
<br/>
I have no problem asking for a homeschool discount. With the number of<br/>
books we buy every little bit helps plus usually in hs families there<br/>
aren&#39;t 2 fulltime wage earners to help out.<br/>
<br/>
I also like to haggle which is good living here in the UAE. Everything is<br/>
open to discussion of price. We even get discounts at the pharmacy and<br/>
dentist etc. And buying carpets -- now that&#39;s an art form:)<br/>

Each registered family that spends over $100 in a calendar year gets a five <br/>
percent discount thereafter.<br/>
<br/>
But Kirby working there made it even better!  The whole family (maybe because <br/>
we were registered and qualified as a group account before he was ever hired <br/>
in fall of 2000) gets his employee discount.<br/>
