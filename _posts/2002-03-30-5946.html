<div id="ygrps-yiv-411413852">Hi all -<br/>
Jane from MD here peaking in......<br/>
<br/>
I loved Deb&#39;s description of the wonderful people &#39;in the neighborhood, in <br/>
the neighborhood, in the neigh - bor - hood....&quot;  (oops!  sorry!)   It spoke <br/>
to me as a reminder to be more present where you are. I may not take my kids <br/>
in the antique book store or the pottery studio but we can surely be <br/>
available to any curiosity or interest that shows up wherever we are!  What i <br/>
mean is that I don&#39;t have to PLAN special trips - special people, events, <br/>
surprises are present EVERYWHERE.....just take the time to notice and <br/>
cherish.....<br/>
<br/>
Another thought that I&#39;d like to through out is this:  it occured to me to <br/>
take a time (a fall season) and teach my kids NOTHING....NO &#39;educational <br/>
experiences&#39;....no classes.....no fieldtrips for the sake of learning...no <br/>
planning playdates for 2 weeks from Thursday.....nothing....simply &#39;planning&#39; <br/>
for today (or maybe making arrangements for tmrw......What would happen?  <br/>
I did this as an experiment to wean myself of overplanning.....it was hard <br/>
but I told myself that it would not matter in a couple years of we learned <br/>
&quot;nothing&quot; for 3 months!........wow!  What a great time!  Anywhere we went was <br/>
because one of us brought up the idea bec. of a specific <br/>
interest....otherwise, we stayed home a lot....but then we were REALLY glad <br/>
to be wherever we were....we read the books we wanted (not bec. of any of my <br/>
ulterior motives!).....we went all over, too....I&#39;m sure if I went back to my <br/>
calendar and saw what we did I could attach a lot of &#39;educational terms&#39; to <br/>
the activities....however, the intent was to let these moments unfold....to <br/>
be open and trust that &#39;beautiful stuff happens&#39;.....<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes one of them would say something like, &quot;I like learning about <br/>
horses....&quot;  Wow!  What a test bec. my teacher mind would immediately go to <br/>
&quot;we can go to a horse farm!  there are horse rescue farms nearby! So and so <br/>
has horses!  we can go to a vet!  lets get books from the library!  Grandma <br/>
loves horses, we could get together with her and go riding!....ideas ! ideas! <br/>
 ideas!&quot;  After doing that numerous times with their interests, I noticed <br/>
that they didn&#39;t usually have that overwhelming enthusiasm that I did for <br/>
wanting to show them something!  I&#39;ve learned, with my kids, anyway, to ask <br/>
more questions like....&quot;oh, what would you like to do/learn?&quot;  Sometimes they <br/>
ask, &#39;can we visit a horse&#39;?  Sometimes, they are happy just to wonder about <br/>
something and not necessarily want the answer!   sigh, the freedom in that!  <br/>
We DON&#39;T have to want/need the answers!  <br/>
<br/>
One time the kids were looking at an insect and I enthusiastically said, <br/>
&quot;let&#39;s get the encyclopedia out and see what it is and learn about it!&quot; my <br/>
wise daughter said, &quot;MOM, we want to learn about it by watching it....&quot;  <br/>
sigh....she was 5 at the time....I have so much to learn!<br/>
<br/>
So, there is MY ramble!  I want to simply suggest that we as parents really <br/>
could do NOTHING educational......just go about our days, being home, doing <br/>
errands, going to where you are inspired to go.......and being PRESENT for <br/>
the curiosities and people that present themselves.....and then being patient <br/>
to let it all run its course....<br/>
<br/>
HOpe that makes sense....Thanks, Deb, for the post that inspired me!  I&#39;ll <br/>
think more about this today!<br/>
<br/>
Have a good one!<br/>
Jane<br/>
