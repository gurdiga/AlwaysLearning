&quot;Some time ago&quot; is too vague to ring a bell.<br/>
If you go to AlwaysLearning&#39;s main page, click on mesages, and look in  the <br/>
days or week you think it was posted and it&#39;s not there, it means it never  <br/>
went through to the list.  If you see it there, it means it went at least  to <br/>
that page.  Very occasionally there&#39;ll be a yahoo glitch where some  people on a <br/>
list don&#39;t get their mail.  It&#39;s not often.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, sometimes (on lists, at parties, wherever) something is said  that&#39;s <br/>
the last word, or everyone else was busy or distracted and just didn&#39;t  respond.<br/>
