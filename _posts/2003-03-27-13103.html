<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Too many times to count, when people have met me they look at me like I&#39;m an<br/>
&gt; imposter and say &quot;I thought you would be tall.  And blonde.&quot;   I must write<br/>
&gt; tall and blonde. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really funny.  I started subscribing to HEM after reading<br/>
unschooling.com for several months, so I don&#39;t think I&#39;d seen a picture of<br/>
you before.  But tall and blonde never came to mind at ALL!  You look like<br/>
you sound, to me.  I hope that&#39;s not insulting and that you like sounding<br/>
tall and blonde!  It&#39;s not meant that way.<br/>
<br/>
I had a funny experience with this recently.  I hope that Kelli in MN will<br/>
forgive me for telling it here!  She recently sent a picture of her family<br/>
on vacation in Mexico, so that my son could see her daughter.  They&#39;re pen<br/>
pals.  Kelli looks so pulled together and grown up!  I know that sounds<br/>
silly, but I never picture myself that way; I still dress much like I did in<br/>
college, and my hair is long like it was when I was a child.  So I ran to<br/>
the mirror to look, and I guess I look grown up, too.  Or at least older.<br/>
But I still think Kelli looks more like somebody who has it all together<br/>
than I do!  <br/>

 <br/>
Hmmmmmm,  not sure how to take that.  &lt;g&gt;   Maybe looks are deceiving? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Right before that trip I was over at a friend&#39;s and had her cut off my hair.   So when I look at those pictures I think the same thing.   When you see me in August my hair will probably be long again.   I tend to go short, long, short, long.   I like what&#39;s maintenance free, so,  the short hair usually tends to be short lived!               <br/>
 <br/>
Its fun seeing what people look like when you&#39;ve read their thoughts or writings,  isn&#39;t it?<br/>
 <br/>
I called Shyrley before I went to Mexico.  I felt bad because I was going to go out and see her, but then at the last minute our family went on this Mexico trip instead.  And she got ditched for warm weather,  sorry Shyrley, again.              <br/>
Anyway,  when she was talking,  I sat there listening to her voice.   She has the sweetest voice,   I didn&#39;t tell you that Shyrley.     I hate my voice when I hear it in recordings.  Maybe its just odd to hear one&#39;s own voice?     I don&#39;t know.<br/>

waiting to see a picture of you now,  Brenda!  (hint, hint)<br/>

anybody else around to take pictures, so I&#39;m never in them, I take them.<br/>
<br/>
But you&#39;ll see me in South Carolina.  Until then, I have long hair, could<br/>
really stand to lose some weight, and I&#39;m almost six feet tall.  Does that<br/>
help any?  :)<br/>

dimensions.  The other stuff is just packaging &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>
