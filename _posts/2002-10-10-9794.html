<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172529787">My hubby used to work at the McDonald Observatory in Far West Texas so last year we were able to see the leonid show and it was truly spectacular. We got our sleeping bags and laid out most of the night. We laid on top of the car because they were shooting from all directions and we couldn&#39;t see from the ground. I do miss the fantastic sky shows we witnessed in Texas. Sigh... Mary in Va.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966927975">We couldn&#39;t see them well last year because of weather.  We were so<br/>
disappointed.  We had a good show with the Perseids this summer though,<br/>
and we&#39;ve had lovely auroras this year. <br/>
We drag my son&#39;s old tumbling mat out on the front lawn and lay there<br/>
watching the sky.  <br/>
Hope you have a good show in VA this year, they&#39;re predicting lots of<br/>
meteors, but also say there will be a bright moon at the peak of the<br/>
showers.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-67380079">hey thanks for the info. I have heard so many negative things about the air pollution blocking sky shows that I hadn&#39;t even given it a thought. Mary in Va.<br/>
