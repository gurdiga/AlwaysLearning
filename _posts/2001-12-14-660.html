<div id="ygrps-yiv-430190720">I have a friend that did the whole &quot;courtship&quot; (basically arranged marriage) <br/>
thing with her dd.<br/>
The adults have a LOT of control over the couple to &quot;keep them pure&quot; until <br/>
they are married. It&#39;s not such a bad idea to abstain until marriage, it&#39;s <br/>
just the method they go about doing this.<br/>
It is definitely a trend among the Christian sect...read Josh Harris&#39;s book <br/>
&quot;I gave up dating&quot; if you want to understand the movement.<br/>
