<div id="ygrps-yiv-542326373">-=-Also, both the 2yo and the 5yo are *very* into maps, which seems  <br/>
to be<br/>
something that came from watching Dora.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about maps.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were little I had a couple of very favorite books  <br/>
involving maps.  One&#39;s American and one&#39;s Australian.<br/>
<br/>
Rose Sorooshian has gotten interested in maps, and I think &quot;a map  <br/>
guy&quot; spoke at the HSC conference last year.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about giving or throwing our globe away just before  <br/>
Christmas.  I had to move it to make room for Christmas stuff.  It  <br/>
has tape on it, and is outdated, but I thought of how sad I&#39;ve always  <br/>
been that I gave my own childhood globe away, that had Tanganyika.    <br/>
So I stuck it in the storage room thinking I really should give it  <br/>
away and not be such a packrat.<br/>
<br/>
Less than a week later, Lillian Jones was here, we were talking about  <br/>
Alaska and northern Canada (because of a Canadian map I had out on  <br/>
the table, which used to be in the bathroom) and she said, &quot;Do you  <br/>
have a globe?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I brought it in, and it&#39;s been on the kitchen table or the counter  <br/>
for the past week and a half, and my nephew came and used it (talking  <br/>
about Iceland and Norway), and Holly asked one day where New Zealand  <br/>
was, and then where Hawaii was, and there was that globe, and she  <br/>
asked what that jaggedy line was by Alaska, and so I told her about  <br/>
New Zealand having had Christmas before anyone else and we talked  <br/>
about time zones and the international date line.<br/>
<br/>
Those books I like are<br/>
<br/>
My Place<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
<br/>
Me on the Map<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Looking to see whether those are still available, I found<br/>
<br/>
Map My India  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://mapmyindia.com/">http://mapmyindia.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Tagzania   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tagzania.com/">http://www.tagzania.com/</a>  (I couldn&#39;t get it to save my  <br/>
house, but might try again later)<br/>
<br/>
My Place is $20 nearly in hardbound re-print at Amazon .   Libraries  <br/>
might have it.  My Place (Hardcover) by Nadia Wheatley, Donna Rawlins<br/>
<br/>
Me on the Map (Dragonfly Books) (Paperback)<br/>
by Joan Sweeney, Annette Cable   is less expensive (under $4 used, $7  <br/>
new) and has a girl in Kansas, who finds her place at different  <br/>
mapping levels, down to mapping her bedroom.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564179452">Currently we have a world map with lots of topographical detail on the wall<br/>
which has been repeatedly referred to, and a diabolically difficult Earth<br/>
globe puzzle awaiting our attention.<br/>
<br/>
Boy did we have fun at the newly reopened Griffith Observatory, where they<br/>
have scale models of all the planets and a really big and detailed earth<br/>
globe with the ocean floor modeled on it as well as the mountains. The only<br/>
trouble with it is that it is hard to see the northern latitudes because of<br/>
the tilt and then the barrier.<br/>
<br/>
We love Google Earth.<br/>

learned in school no longer exist, and there are many more to learn <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I had a globe that belonged to my grandmother; it was a metal piggy <br/>
bank given out by her &quot;real&quot; bank.  I&#39;m not sure its exact age, but a <br/>
friend who knows history better than I said it was colored to indicate <br/>
that Japan &quot;owned&quot; Korea at the time.  We have an inflatable one that <br/>
came with the Calvert School geography course which shows the USSR -- <br/>
even though it was already dissolved.  And the relief globe we still <br/>
use started life as an Easy Bake Oven; Laura exchanged her Christmas <br/>
present at Toys R Us for it.  I used it recently when a character on <br/>
&quot;Standoff&quot; said something about &quot;crossing from Portugal into France.&quot;  <br/>
I just had to double-check!  She clearly did not mean getting on a <br/>
plane or into a boat, and the person she said it to didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
notice this booboo.  (These are FBI agents, btw!)<br/>

<br/>
THE PATTY DUKE SHOW THEME<br/>
(Sid Ramin / Bob Wells)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Meet Cathy, who&#39;s lived most everywhere,<br/>
 From Zanzibar to Barclay Square.<br/>
But Patty&#39;s only seen the sights<br/>
A girl can see from Brooklyn Heights � What a crazy pair!<br/>
<br/>
But they&#39;re cousins,<br/>
Identical cousins all the way.<br/>
One pair of matching bookends,<br/>
Different as night and day.<br/>
<br/>
Where Cathy adores a minuet,<br/>
The Ballet Russes, and crepe suzette,<br/>
Our Patty loves to rock and roll,<br/>
A hot dog makes her lose control � What a wild duet!<br/>
<br/>
Still, they&#39;re cousins,<br/>
Identical cousins and you&#39;ll find,<br/>
They laugh alike, they walk alike,<br/>
At times they even talk alike �<br/>
You can lose your mind,<br/>
When cousins are two of a kind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174731963">This morning when I turned on the internet, my Google start page said<br/>
there was a volcano spewing ash into the air in Montserrat.<br/>
<br/>
So I read the headline out loud and asked my mom (who stays at our<br/>
house 2 days a week) where Montserrat is.  She didn&#39;t know, and Fin<br/>
was very anxious to see the volcano. (Lots of volcanos in Dora, don&#39;t<br/>
you know?!?)<br/>
The link from the google page didn&#39;t have a good picture :( or a map,<br/>
so I zipped over to the BBC site and found an article on it there. I<br/>
really love BBC news because they have a map for each article!<br/>
So then we could see where it was, and Fin grabbed her new mini-globe<br/>
(from Discovery channel store, it also lights up!) and we found it on<br/>
there (well, the Caribbean area), and had a discussion about where we<br/>
were relative to it, would we be affected by the ash, did we know<br/>
anyone near that area, what is ash and what does it do, what about the<br/>
people who live on the island, how the wind would blow it... led to<br/>
weather maps... and then back to more pictures of the volcano, but<br/>
they weren&#39;t exciting enough, so we searched for other volcano<br/>
pictures, preferably with lots and lots of lava... (&quot;just search for<br/>
laaa-vaa Mom!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I learnt a lot, I promise.  Please don&#39;t quiz me on it.<br/>
