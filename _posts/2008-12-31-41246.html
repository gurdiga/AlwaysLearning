<div id="ygrps-yiv-571734777">Sandra, not sure if this is OT, but I don&#39;t think so, as having the option to stay home with <br/>
our kids can be a major factor in our unschooling lives...<br/>
<br/>
On change.org, Naomi Aldort has made a recommendation (that you can vote on) about <br/>
supporting mothers so that they are able to stay home to be with their children instead<br/>
of being forced to put them in daycare.  According to her email, it will need thousands of <br/>
votes to be passed/heard?  I thought this list was a good place to post it as there are so <br/>
many members!  Here is what her e-mail said:<br/>
<br/>
1) The opportunity is urgent as now is the deadline (the 31st at midnight):<br/>
If you would like to make your voice heard with the new president, please<br/>
vote on my parenting recommendation and on my other posts at change.org. You<br/>
will have to sign up but you will not get emails as a result of it and it is<br/>
easy and quick. If we get enough votes by Wednesday midnight, it will be<br/>
seen by Obama&#39;s management. It takes a couple of thousands votes so it will<br/>
take a miracle to get enough votes since I just created it but there are<br/>
many thousands of us so it is possible. Feel free to pass it on.<br/>

I did let this through in case people want to go there and check it  <br/>
out, but I&#39;d rather not discuss it on this list, as it has to do with  <br/>
politics and so isn&#39;t about how people learn no matter where they live.<br/>
