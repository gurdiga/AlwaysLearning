<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260686342">Ok, I have 3 kids at home, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th grades.  I use those grades<br/>
loosely, as I&#39;m not sure grade I&#39;ll &quot;classify&quot; my younger 2 next year for<br/>
various reasons. or if I&#39;ll even classify them at all. We tend to do most<br/>
things together anyway. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just pulled them from public school this year. my younger 2 in February<br/>
and my oldest in March, so we&#39;re still trying to figure out our learning<br/>
style and what works for us. My younger kids are having NO problem figuring<br/>
out what they like and what they don&#39;t. we attempted physics for science,<br/>
and they show no interest and have made it very clear that they want to<br/>
learn about the solar system. great! We&#39;ll start reading and doing fun<br/>
activities this week! They love to play math games. love to work with<br/>
manipulatives. can&#39;t stand doing worksheets! My 2nd grader announced to me<br/>
last week, &quot;Mom, I *hate* doing worksheets. they&#39;re so boring!&quot; Wow! I had<br/>
to step back and rethink what we were doing. I was really doing &quot;school at<br/>
home&quot;, and while I&#39;m not completely ready to jump into unschooling (although<br/>
I absolutely love the idea and can&#39;t promise I won&#39;t eventually), I don&#39;t<br/>
want my kids hating what we do or being bored. if they&#39;re not happy, it&#39;s<br/>
obviously not working for them. My 3rd grader is quick to tell me, &quot;Mom,<br/>
this is just like public school. What&#39;s the point of being at home if this<br/>
is what you want us to do?&quot; BACK UP! Don&#39;t want this to be like public<br/>
school, so obviously need to make some changes. Anyway, my point is we&#39;re<br/>
figuring it out, I&#39;m learning to get out of the public school mentality, and<br/>
my younger two are great at telling me what they like/don&#39;t like, what they<br/>
want to learn, etc. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My 6th grader is the one who is having a harder time getting into the<br/>
mindset of being at home, I guess. It was her choice to stay home (I left it<br/>
up to her so that she would be &quot;on board&quot;). but she is so stuck in the<br/>
public school mentality, it is unreal! I guess that is to be expected since<br/>
she spent the most time in ps. She has this idea of what her workload is<br/>
supposed to look like, and if she doesn&#39;t feel like I assigned her enough<br/>
work, she&#39;ll say she doesn&#39;t think she is learning enough. I try to explain<br/>
to her that it shouldn&#39;t take her from 8:15 to 2:45 to do her schoolwork. we<br/>
don&#39; t have all the downtime and busy work that they do in ps. She&#39;s happy<br/>
with her math (she&#39;s doing Teaching Textbooks pre-algebra and really enjoys<br/>
it). she hates reading, so I&#39;m working on that with her slowly. don&#39;t want<br/>
to force her, but I think reading is very important. I just got us a book to<br/>
read together, so we&#39;ll see how that goes. I don&#39;t push spelling much with<br/>
her, as she&#39;s a naturally good speller anyway. Science and social studies<br/>
are our issues, really. I found a unit study on veterinary medicine,<br/>
particularly dogs. she absolutely loves dogs, and I thought she&#39;d really<br/>
enjoy it. When I mentioned it to her, she said, &quot;Mom, that&#39;s not the kind of<br/>
science I&#39;m supposed to be learning.&quot; Ugh. just when I think I&#39;m getting<br/>
through to her. I tried to explain to her that there is no science you are<br/>
&quot;supposed&quot; to learn.. that kids in ps have to learn whatever science the<br/>
teacher is teaching, but that&#39;s just because the school system has to keep<br/>
them all doing the same thing to make it easier to teach that many kids, but<br/>
that she&#39;s home and has the opportunity to learn about what she wants. She<br/>
just keeps saying that she needs to learn the kind of science that she&#39;s<br/>
supposed to learn in ps. and the same with social studies/history. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
How do I help her learn to follow her interests and that she has the freedom<br/>
to learn about things that interest her? I ordered some games for my younger<br/>
two about the solar system. and ended up getting one about anatomy, just<br/>
because it looked fun! J So I&#39;m hoping she&#39;ll jump in on those games with us<br/>
instead of having her nose in the textbooks. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has experience in &quot;deschooling&quot; their middle schooler, please<br/>
offer some advice. I&#39;m honestly sad for her, and want her to find the love<br/>
in learning again (probably since she was 5). I don&#39;t want to take away her<br/>
math program that she&#39;s using, and we&#39;re fairly happy with her language arts<br/>
curriculum (I&#39;m very loose there), but there&#39;s so much fun to be had if she<br/>
could just get &quot;unbrainwashed&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any help you can offer, and sorry for the long post!<br/>

It&#39;s tough to make the transition from duties geared for continual  <br/>
performance to actually enjoying the possibilities for fun all around.   <br/>
Teens are a difficult passage anyway, so there will naturally be some  <br/>
introspection going on as well, so what you&#39;re seeing might not be just  <br/>
about unschooling/deschooling but life too.<br/>

This list might be frustrating for you if you don&#39;t intend to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t decide to unschool and then make changes in your view of  <br/>
your children and of learning, I can promise you will will not  <br/>
unschool eventually.   &quot;Eventually&quot; can mean thousands of years from  <br/>
now.  You have a child who&#39;s 11 or 12 or 13 years old (you&#39;ve called  <br/>
him &quot;a sixth grader,&quot; but that term will keep you stuck in  <br/>
schoolthink).   You have VERY few years to do something cool with him  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693997429">Thank you for your comments and suggestions. I always enjoy reading what you<br/>
have to say. The list is definitely not frustrating to me, if anything it<br/>
gives me success story after success story to read about (along with the<br/>
trials and tribulations) which helps to focus my thinking away from<br/>
school-think and more to everyday learning through living. I&#39;m really trying<br/>
to just jump in feet first, but it&#39;s been harder than I thought to get my<br/>
idea of &quot;learning&quot; out of my head. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just pulled my kids out of ps in 2009, so they did part of the year (most)<br/>
in ps. I&#39;m thinking that between now and the summer months, we will shift<br/>
more away from &quot;curriculum&quot; and more towards learning through living. in<br/>
which case it *really* won&#39;t matter what grade they&#39;re &quot;in&quot; next year. it<br/>
would be very irrelevant. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The problem with my 6th grader (daughter) is that she wants to go back to<br/>
public school for high school. While I haven&#39;t told her yes or no, I&#39;ve<br/>
actually told her we&#39;ll just talk about it when the time comes, she has this<br/>
idea that she needs to prepare herself for highschool. that if she doesn&#39;t<br/>
&quot;learn&quot; something that the state of CA says she needs to learn in middle<br/>
school that she&#39;ll somehow be behind in highschool. She is an extremely<br/>
bright girl, picks up on things very quickly, and is ahead of where she<br/>
&quot;should&quot; be were she in public school. She enjoys doing her math curriculum,<br/>
so I&#39;m just going to keep letting her do that, and take breaks on days she<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel like it. Language arts is learned through everyday<br/>
communication and story writing that we do, although she is doing a language<br/>
arts workbook right now to &quot;make her feel better&quot;. It&#39;s hard for her to<br/>
understand that she doesn&#39;t &quot;have&quot; to have learned anything specific,<br/>
especially in the areas of science and social studies/history, when she gets<br/>
to highschool. if she even returns to ps (which I&#39;d rather she didn&#39;t. while<br/>
she&#39;s &quot;gifted&quot;, public school tends to dumb her down!). <br/>

in San Diego in September. A GREAT way to NOT start school next school <br/>
year! Your daughter will meet all the unschooled kids and be inspired <br/>
and amazed and might get all excited about natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
Also - think about how to make life at home (and out of the home) so <br/>
much fun that she won&#39;t want to miss out on it by going to school.<br/>

do a deschooling period before jumping into it.  So even if this person<br/>
ends up going that route, it really does help to deschool regardless of<br/>
what they end up doing.  It gives a chance to refocus ones life in such<br/>
a way that school is less and life is bigger.  Kids who have that chance<br/>
to deschool, really do much better.<br/>
<br/>
You can think of it this way; when kids are in school, each day they<br/>
need to come home and decompress, so deschooling after coming out of<br/>
school, is like a larger decompressing, to undo all the stress and<br/>
damage done by school.</div>

You are in California - why don&#39;t you come to the unschooling conference <br/>
in San Diego in September. A GREAT way to NOT start school next school <br/>
year! Your daughter will meet all the unschooled kids and be inspired <br/>
and amazed and might get all excited about natural learning.<br/>
<br/>
Also - think about how to make life at home (and out of the home) so <br/>
much fun that she won&#39;t want to miss out on it by going to school.<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re in Northern California, it is still well worth the trip to San <br/>
Diego! Sandra will be speaking there and have her whole family with her. <br/>
I&#39;ll be speaking and so will my daughter, Roya, and my other kids will <br/>
be with me, too.<br/>
<br/>
But, there is also the HomeSchool Association of California conference <br/>
in Sacramento in August - it is not an entirely unschooling conference, <br/>
but there will definitely be an unschooling (mostly radical) contingent <br/>
and we&#39;ll have talks and panel discussions,etc.<br/>
