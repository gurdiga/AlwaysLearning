How learning a language is not about adding more knowledge in a school kind of way or teaching. <br>How&nbsp; we would learn the same way children learn to talk and how it is about the learner and not&nbsp; teaching.<br><br>It is also probably why kids have an easier time to learn another language but I think adults can do it too as I did and I want to do it again.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br><span></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>I have seen people learn another language exactly how he learned Chinese.

 the parent of our Japanese trainee and my husband is really good at talking to people who understand just a few words.<br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0yGdNEWdn0<br></span></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><font face="courier">Alex Polikowsky</font></div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.polykow.blogspot.com/"></a>&nbsp;</div></div></html></div>
