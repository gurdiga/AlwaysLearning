<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here is the short question: Any<br/>
&gt; advice on helping a 10yo kid with motion sickness tendencies better endure a<br/>
&gt; 4 hour car ride? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My son sometimes gets car sick, and the longer trips are definitely more<br/>
painful.  Sometimes plain (no butter, no salt) popcorn helps if he can munch<br/>
it.  Reading usually makes it worse, as does anything close (gameboy, etc.).<br/>
Looking out the front window helps Tim the most, so we often put him in the<br/>
middle.  An option, if you have the space to do it.  Sleeping is the best<br/>
bet -- he never gets carsick asleep!  We tried the gum (is that<br/>
homeopathic?) that most kids seem to love, but it made Tim throw up.  Maybe<br/>
something in it didn&#39;t work for him, I don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the elevators go, I&#39;d figure so what.  I don&#39;t care for elevators,<br/>
either, but I didn&#39;t ride in them hardly at all until I was grown up.  They<br/>
certainly weren&#39;t necessary in my life until I worked in big office<br/>
buildings.  I fail to see how pushing her about them now will make her<br/>
happier later.  Probably more like pushing now will make her hate them more<br/>
later.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh, and experience as a psychiatric nurse is fine, but it doesn&#39;t make one<br/>
the psychiatrist any more than working as a surgical nurse makes one the<br/>
surgeon.  Yes, your Mom may have picked up some stuff working with psych<br/>
patients, but that doesn&#39;t make her the expert on it.  And I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
taking a child to a psychiatrist because she doesn&#39;t like elevators!  She<br/>
can just take the stairs and call it exercise.<br/>
