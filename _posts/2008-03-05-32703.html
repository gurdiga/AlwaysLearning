I have recommended games, as have lots of other unschoolers.  Several  <br/>
adult friends came over last night and we played Five Crowns and  <br/>
PicturePicture.  These are not &quot;educational&quot; games, but yet, as most  <br/>
of you know, lots of cool discussion came out of them concerning  <br/>
odds, vocabulary, history, art...<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Gary Gygax, who created Dungeons & Dragons died, so that  <br/>
has stirred up some discussion here and there.<br/>

Because these discussions are going around, don&#39;t be surprised if  <br/>
more conservative homeschoolers get stirred up about the evils of  <br/>
letting kids play games.  Know from your own experience what your  <br/>
children have learned from play, and be prepared in case you&#39;re asked  <br/>
to defend letting kids play.<br/>
<br/>
And please file this knowledge under why unschoolers are sometimes  <br/>
reviled by other homeschoolers.  It&#39;s because of what they&#39;re told  <br/>
and what they believe.  It&#39;s because the freedoms our children have  <br/>
threaten the peace of their own children&#39;s restricted lives.<br/>

How about we offer what learned playing D&D ourselves? &lt;g&gt;  I played <br/>
D&D thru high school (when it was brand new) and for several years <br/>
after.  My sister and her dh still play D&D or similar RPG&#39;s.  <br/>
<br/>
The whole idea that playing such games will turn kids to witchcraft, <br/>
violence or suicide is ridiculous.  The stories about how &#39;evil&#39; D&D <br/>
is have been circulating among the religious folks for more than 20 <br/>
years now.  There&#39;s no factual basis for such it -- just more fear-<br/>
mongering. <br/>
<br/>
That comic you linked above was one of the funniest things I&#39;ve ever <br/>
seen.  Makes me glad the Anime artists elevated the whole comic <br/>
genre.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1364962822">Dh and I just got done talking about his death and gaming ...d and d and new computer stuff like wow and halo. My sister in law is currently divorcing her husband because he is verbally abusive and sits all day playing halo and wont go look for a job. There are of course tons of people who enjoy playing halo or fill in your fav game. When a person plays so much that basic responsibilities are being ignored its not a problem with the game its a problem with the person playing it. <br/>
   <br/>
  Personaly I dont waste my energy defending myself over ridiculous suggestions like my children are going to hell if they play ...........  thats between them and the diety of their choice. <br/>

True, but the puritanical answer to that is to remove anything that&#39;s  <br/>
very fun and therefore a temptation not to work hard and be frugal  <br/>
and quiet and at home not sinning.   If nothing fun or colorful  <br/>
exists, it&#39;s easier to &quot;be good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If nothing more exciting than a book exists in a home, then the  <br/>
children will be more excited by books.<br/>
