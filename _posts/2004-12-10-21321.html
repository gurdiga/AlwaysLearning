<div id="ygrps-yiv-393711336">My husband just sent me a link to a very cool online advent calendar, each <br/>
day being a link to a page with medieval Christmas stories, history, folklore or <br/>
art.  Stained glass windows.  Paintings of the Magi.   For anyone interested <br/>
in either Christmas or the Middle Ages, it&#39;s glorious, and I love both.<br/>

The hosting site is dedicated to stonecarving and architecture, but the links <br/>
go to other places.  Today&#39;s (the 10th) is an Icelandic history of Yule there <br/>
(Iceland).  <br/>
