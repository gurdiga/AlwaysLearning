<div id="ygrps-yiv-1333035300">I don&#39;t know if anyone else would like to do this again, but I get inspired by at least a few <br/>
things every time, so if people have ideas they&#39;d like to share, I&#39;d like to hear them.<br/>
<br/>
Lately, I was inspired by Pam mentioning tempera paint in the tub.  We did it, and my <br/>
daughter (10) had a blast.  I haven&#39;t helped set this kind of thing up in a while because I <br/>
think of her as getting older (I&#39;m now knocking myself on the head --  LOL).  She loved it and <br/>
was so appreciative.  She loves to LARP and so she painted on full length greaves, a power <br/>
necklace, and wrist protection in addition to the walls--very fun.  In fact, she wasn&#39;t very <br/>
inspired by painting the walls (flat surface, like paper), which is why we had moved away from <br/>
regular painting, so having the freedom of painting herself made it sooooo much more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Later tonight I&#39;ll see if she wants to look around the internet at armor together.<br/>
