<div id="ygrps-yiv-806788755">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We are having our 3rd annual unschoolers gathering in the Montreal area from June 30th to July 6th at Oka park in Oka, QC. This has been a really wonderful gathering the last two years, full of great conversations, potlucks, laughter, hikes, and listening to live music at the jazz festival! We&#39;re hoping you&#39;ll join us this year, and help make it as much fun as previous years. <br/>
<br/>
Here is the information about this year&#39;s gathering.<br/>
<br/>
SMUG 2012 INFO<br/>
<br/>
SMUG this year will be from June 30th to July 6th (leave on the morning of the 6th). The Montreal Jazz Festival (free outdoor concerts and many paid events, but we usually just take in the free ones ;-)) runs from June 28 Â– July 7 this year, and we hope to go into the city for the festival a couple of times as we<br/>
have done in past years.<br/>
<br/>
Cost of Gite: Rooms cost $75.88 per night, including tax ($64 plus $2 lodging tax, plus regular tax) or $455.30 (plus the access fee)for 6 nights. There may be an additional charge of $11.50 (including tax) per night for a third adult in the room (for a possible total of $524.30 if 3 adults in the room, but I am trying to get around that extra cost) but children can stay in the rooms for free.<br/>
<br/>
Camping costs for basic camping (no electric/services, but water nearby): $31.91 per night including taxes but not park entry fee ($27.75 before tax), for a  total of $166.50 for 6 nights.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone must pay a daily park entry fee as follows:<br/>
Adults: $6 per day or $30 for Oka park for the season<br/>
Children : $2.75 per day or $13.75 for Oka for the season<br/>
Families with 1 adult: $8.75 per day or $43.75 for Oka for the season<br/>
Families with 2 adults: $12 per day or $60 for Oka for the season<br/>
<br/>
I need the payment for rooms by SUNDAY, JUNE 4TH, in order to reserve the Gite. People who will be camping can reserve their spots starting June 5th (after I confirm the Gite) directly with Parc Oka. Rooms may not be cancelled since the full amount goes to the parc and they have a no refund policy for the Gite. For camping, there is a $6 fee if you cancel 7 days or more before your date of arrival.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We regret that we&#39;re sharing this information with other Yahoo groups so late, but personal stuff the last couple of months has lead us to only be publicizing this event widely now. Because of how few people have confirmed they want to come, we may have to cancel SMUG for this year, though we&#39;re really hoping that SMUG 2012 happens! If you&#39;re interested in attending, please let us know ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
We hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Debbie and Idzie<br/>
