<div id="ygrps-yiv-1389924268">My daughter Claire (17) has a part-time job that she really likes. She&#39;s thinking ahead to this summer or fall when her friends will be going away to college. Many of them are going to one college about 5 hours away. She doesn&#39;t want to make the move because she isn&#39;t sure if she wants to go to college, and she isn&#39;t ready to move away from home. <br/>
<br/>
She has asked me to help her find some possible careers that she might enjoy that don&#39;t require a college degree. We talked about clerical, sales, childcare, and looked at the programs offered by the local junior college. None of those things appealed to her. She doesn&#39;t seem to have much interest in anything beyond her part-time job so I told her she didn&#39;t need to find something definite just because her friends were going to college. She wants to know how other young adults find interesting jobs if they don&#39;t go to college.<br/>
<br/>
I also suggested she consider talking with the management of the small mall restaurant where she is working. I believe they think she is a top employee. Maybe she could speak to her supervisor about what she needs to do to be considered for a management position.<br/>
<br/>
From what I have read about unschoolers, they find jobs in a field they really love. Claire doesn&#39;t feel she has any particular passion. Last fall, she was looking into culinary schools but she lost interest fairly quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Basically I suggested she doesn&#39;t need to find a career to fill the gap of not going to college and that maybe she&#39;ll find something she wants to do later. What are other young adult unschoolers doing?  Is there a list similar to this one where she can talk to other young adults like her?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1254450658">What about travel or volunteering?  Our neighbor is taking the year  <br/>
after highschool to do heiffer international and volunteer at an  <br/>
orphanage in Zimbabwe.  If not, how about nannying for an unschooling  <br/>
family that lives elsewhere.  Has she read the Teenage Liberation  <br/>
Handbook?  Maybe even volunteering at the local level (food bank if  <br/>
she&#39;s interested in cooking or animal shelter etc.)  It may lead to an  <br/>
interest in something or a job in a non-profit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405088762">What is her part time job and why does she love it?<br/>
<br/>
Does she have to decide on a career now?  <br/>
<br/>
I went to a very intensive college prep high school and I remember that feeling of &quot;I have to pick something&quot; even if I didn&#39;t know what I wanted to pick.  Sort of like career peer pressure, I guess?  I went to college with the goal to do something that sounded interesting and then took as many &quot;challenging&quot; classes as I could because that&#39;s what I was supposed to do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 35 now and I am in such a different place now, than when I was 17 (or even 25!).  Nothing from that era of my life is still around (except my husband, lol).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think passions always have to be big - there are lots of little things I&#39;m interested in and even that ebbs and flows. <br/>
<br/>
Are there any things she&#39;d like to volunteer for?  Volunteers are always needed and it may give her a chance to try some new things (if she&#39;s interested in that).  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15659849">I bought a couple of books used on Amazon about things to do without a  <br/>
college degree. They&#39;re a long way from me, upstairs, and I can&#39;t get  <br/>
to them.  Maybe someone else has those and could just write up the  <br/>
kinds of jobs they named?  I remember florist being in there, and we  <br/>
got the books after holly was working for a florist.<br/>
<br/>
Firefighters and police work sometimes pay better some places than  <br/>
others, and there are adjunct fields for those.<br/>
<br/>
Mechanics and repair jobs are often learned &quot;on the job&quot; or in little  <br/>
workshops and intensive classes for specialties on certain models of  <br/>
cars.<br/>
<br/>
All my kids have worked at jobs where they were working side by side  <br/>
with people who had college degrees.  Not everyone with a degree is  <br/>
&quot;using the degree&quot;--many are doing the same kinds of jobs they could  <br/>
have had without it, but they have loans to pay off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425704434"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; What about travel or volunteering?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We did discuss traveling to see family, but we haven&#39;t found a chance yet. Her first choice was to stay with my MIL and BIL for a while.  BIL owns a Dominoes pizza and we thought it would be cool for her to work with him for a while. Unfortunately, MIL doesn&#39;t feel well enough to have Claire stay for any length of time. We never even thought of volunteering. I&#39;ll ask her if she wants to look into that possibility. <br/>
<br/>
She has a friend from work who is leaving for the Coast Guard in about 3 weeks. He&#39;s trying to talk her into going with him. :)<br/>

<br/>
Well yeah, and a fun job and a happy life should be anyone&#39;s goal.  <br/>
College tends not to guarantee &quot;fun job&quot; or &quot;happy life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe she could say &quot;I&#39;m taking a year off&quot;?  =-=<br/>
<br/>
A  year off of what, though?  It&#39;s not a year off of learning.<br/>
Why can&#39;t she say &quot;I&#39;m going to stay here and work for now&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
The books I have here are 202 High-paying Jobs You can Land `without a  <br/>
College Degree by Janon R. Rich and The Uncollege Alternative by  <br/>
Danielle wood.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s text and discussion of job fairs and how to learn more and  <br/>
find people and that, but the jobs named are such things as paralegal,  <br/>
web site designer, financial planner, dog trainer, hairstylist,  <br/>
mortgage broker/real estate, floral designer, eBay re-seller,  <br/>
transcriptionist or other office back-up person (files, finances),  <br/>
property manager, kitchen work, cruise ships, flight attendant and  <br/>
other airline jobs, and lately there are lots of jobs (I&#39;ve departed  <br/>
from the book for a moment) in airport security.<br/>
<br/>
Outdoor jobs--with plants or animals.  Forest ranger stations have  <br/>
clerks and paperwork.  Police have clerks and paperwork.  Beauty/make- <br/>
up, clothing-related things.  Window dressings (will come from working  <br/>
in a store first, maybe, and proving artistic sense and ability).<br/>
<br/>
Kids could work at a hotel or spa or dude ranch or amusement park, and  <br/>
some of those jobs turn to promotions into management or personnel or  <br/>
other things.  If they&#39;re in and they&#39;re competent and have a happy  <br/>
attitude, they can move on up if they like it, or they can learn  <br/>
things there (cash register, retail, security, safety) that they can  <br/>
put on a resume to take into other jobs later.<br/>

writer ( you don&#39;t need college to write to places)<br/>
truck driver<br/>
Certified Lactation Counselor or Consultant<br/>
day care provider<br/>
personal shopper<br/>
cook / chef<br/>
First responder<br/>
sports coach<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You could tell her to tell her friends that she is going to continue to work and save up money until she knows what she&#39;d like to spend it on, which could potentially be college or travelling.  <br/>
That&#39;s a big deal these days.  Most young adults start their careers and livelihood in considerable debt.  They can&#39;t even begin to think of buying a house or travelling for many years after they&#39;ve worked a while to pay off some of that debt.  Some of those young adults will start families and never get to that place of affording to live in relative comfort without worrying about money and how to make ends meet. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294850129">I&#39;m so glad that this topic came up!<br/>
This has been a big issue in my house lately, and I&#39;ve been intending to dig out my Teenage Liberation Handbook. I did a search for the two books Sandra mentioned, and found one at the library, but also wanted to share that I found a whole lot of books by J. Michael Farr that look very useful. Titles like &#39;250 Best Jobs Through Apprenticeships&#39; and &#39;300 Best Jobs Without a Four-Year Degree&#39; and lots more. My library lists 80 books, so it&#39;s a good idea to search by publication date since there seem to be lots of updated versions.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to share what I found, and thank everyone for the insights and ideas that are much needed right now!<br/>

Holly has said she would like to go and work for Coca Cola.  She  <br/>
doesn&#39;t know or care what or where.  I don&#39;t even know why. I talked  <br/>
to her about the museum in Atlanta, but I think she thinks it would be  <br/>
fun to deliver cases of sodas to grocery stores and shelves them, or  <br/>
to work on ads, or to do sample booths....<br/>

I *heartily* believe that we each need to find our passion, then just be a bit creative in turning that passion into cash. ;oP <br/>

I would second the idea of travel or volunteerism. For now, she should experience as much as she can -- cast a wide net -- so that she is more likely to find what her passion is. Try everything. Go everywhere. At the very least, she&#39;ll make friends and live a rich, full life. And that ain&#39;t bad, is it? ;o)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Holly has said she would like to go and work for Coca Cola.  She  <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t know or care what or where.  I don&#39;t even know why. I talked  <br/>
&gt; to her about the museum in Atlanta, but I think she thinks it would be  <br/>
&gt; fun to deliver cases of sodas to grocery stores and shelves them, or  <br/>
&gt; to work on ads, or to do sample booths....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My husband does this for a living, only he is with Frito-Lay.  Frito-Lay is owned by Pepsi.  I&#39;m not sure how Coca-cola is set up but speaking from personal experience, Bill started doing picking.  He showed an eagerness to get on the trucks, so Frito-lay set him up as the back-up driver for when everyone else takes vacations.  Eventually, if he is willing to stick it out, he could become a permanent driver. In the meantime Bill works between the distribution centre and the trucks (free chips for us!).  If Holly has any questions about the nature of the job, just ask! I&#39;m sure both companies are pretty similar.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something too for anyone feeling really adventurous.  Frito-lay is looking to hire a lot of people as they develop a stronger presence in Moscow, Russia.  They are recruiting right now and offering living expenses and paid moving. There may be strings attached however, like perhaps a two-year commitment or something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219302545"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;From what I have read about unschoolers, they find jobs in a field they really love. Claire doesn&#39;t feel she has any particular passion. Last fall, she was looking into culinary schools but she lost interest fairly quickly.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Knowing what she doesn&#39;t want to do is all part of the process!  Kids in college will often change majors midway through because they decide that they aren&#39;t really interested in that after all.  That&#39;s a pretty expensive change of mind.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille has been doing make-up and hair and clothing things for a couple of years now.  Just on her own time and terms.  She&#39;s cut several people&#39;s hair, she&#39;s become very good at dying hair, and she decorates people, herself and others using make-up.  She redesigns clothing and makes accessories.  She takes great pictures, which is good, since she&#39;ll be able to put them into a portfolio if she needs to.  All these things are, to her, just something she does.  She&#39;s becoming aware of the fact that she&#39;s getting good at it and that others are seeking her abilities.<br/>
<br/>
We did a haunted house thing last year and had a wonderful experience working with costumes and special effects and scaring people.  We are doing it again this year.  We started doing it because she likes horror movies and Halloween and fake blood.  They seemed like trivial interests to lots of people we knew. <br/>
<br/>
 She was offered an intern position to learn make-up with a local special effects company that does both the pretty and the scary, for all kinds of sets.  She&#39;ll be able to get official training from this.  This just happened over this last weekend while we were volunteering at the haunted house.  The person offering, was in charge of all the make-up last year and is doing prosthetics for one of the haunts this year.  <br/>
<br/>
The point, besides sharing this awesome bit of news, is to say that none of that was the intent.  She wasn&#39;t doing the haunted house or make-up or anything like it to get official training or to seek that out.  She was doing it simply because it was something she liked doing.  She may change her mind, or she may continue with this passion that has slowly evolved and gotten more intense in the last year.  It all started with one small narrow interest that expanded to a multitude of other things.<br/>
<br/>
I thought at one point how great it would be for Chamille to do some odd jobs to earn money because her passion can get expensive.  She&#39;s been offered babysitting jobs, but she turns them down mostly.  She&#39;s looked into doing other jobs, but has declined to follow through because she wasn&#39;t interested in the time commitment.  It&#39;s a good thing she isn&#39;t working right now, because she needs to have free time to do an internship.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;Basically I suggested she doesn&#39;t need to find a career to fill the gap of not going to college and that maybe she&#39;ll find something she wants to do later. What are other young adult unschoolers doing? Is there a list similar to this one where she can talk to other young adults like her?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>See it&#39;s great that she likes her job.  Perhaps she wants to stay in the restaurant industry, and why not?  It could provide a lot of opportunities for travel and one day owning or managing a restaurant.  At the very least it provides her with an income that she can use to do other things that interest her.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294347731">Herbert Kohl wrote a book titled The Question is College: Guiding Your Child to the Right Choices After High School.<br/>
<br/>
The first part works to convince parents that college isn&#39;t necessary for a full rich life. The most valuable part for unschoolers though is the ideas in the next part about how to help a young person think about what they like doing, what they&#39;re good at, and a set of guiding exercises to brainstorm what kinds of places those skills and interests might be found and utilized in a job. Kohl then encourages the young person to start on a series of volunteer or paid jobs that incorporate parts of that identified ideal job, beginning a path towards that job, while learning about themselves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My brother-in-law, when he decided that he wanted to own his own mortgage company, set out to take jobs that would teach him the different aspects of business ownership, even if they weren&#39;t related to the mortgage industry. So, for example, he worked in the accounting department of a credit card company and in management for a decking company and made calls for a telemarketing company. He did a lot of &quot;research&quot; by way of working outside of the mortgage industry and actually only worked in the mortgage department of a bank for a short time. He did, eventually, get his mortgage company going and did very well. (The mortgage meltdown doomed the company, of course, but he&#39;s working his way back up.) <br/>
<br/>
The point is that knowing the ultimate goal (if a teen is lucky enough to have one) will help a person focus their career choices -- just not necessarily in the traditional sense. It&#39;s the skills that they&#39;ll need that they sometimes have to focus on, not necessarily working up from within the chosen field.<br/>

List of things you can do without a college degree.<br/>
At the top of my head:<br/>
<br/>
dog handler<br/>
dog trainor<br/>
dog groomer<br/>
dairy farmer/ pig famer/ poultry farmer<br/>
crop farmer <br/>
fruit and/or vegetable and/or flower farmer<br/>
Flight?Attendant<br/>
Make Up artist<br/>
writer (?you don&#39;t need?college to write to places)<br/>
truck driver<br/>
Certified Lactation Counselor or Consultant<br/>
day?care provider<br/>
personal shopper<br/>
cook / chef<br/>
First responder<br/>
sports coach<br/>
exercise instructor<br/>
horse trainer<br/>
Swim instructor<br/>
tennis instructor (and many other sports)<br/>
pilot ( this one will need a lot of study but one can join the military and then go civilian)<br/>
dancer<br/>
dance instructor<br/>
?choreographer<br/>
construction<br/>
<br/>
and so many more... some of the above may need a certification but they are usually quite simple and don&#39;t require years of study. Most of the above can be learned as an apprenticeship. I have done quite a few of the above even thou I have a Law Degree that I have never really used!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2119828081">-=-. We never even thought of volunteering. I&#39;ll ask her if she wants  <br/>
to look into that possibility. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Rather than ask her that way, look around for the actual  <br/>
opportunities, and propose something you know the two of you might be  <br/>
interested in.   &quot;Do you want to help the food bank for Thanksgiving  <br/>
this year?&quot; might be more interesting than &quot;Do you want me to look  <br/>
into the possibility of volunteer work?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Make your ideas alluring.  Find something you really want to do, and  <br/>
she might really want to do it too.  And if she doesn&#39;t?  Do it anyway.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We did discuss traveling to see family, but we haven&#39;t found a  <br/>
chance yet-=-<br/>
<br/>
Make a chance.  And why family?  Travel to the nearest city with a  <br/>
museum and spend the night in a motel.  Or travel to a small town and  <br/>
stay in a bed & breakfast, or with an unschooling family.  Just look  <br/>
around.  Go for a picnic.<br/>

<br/>
I strongly second Sandra&#39;s book recommendation: &quot;The Uncollege Alternative&quot; by Danielle Wood. The opening page sounds just as the OP described her daughter&#39;s situation. &quot;From six to sixteen almost no one asked you what you wanted to be when you grew up. ...Suddenly you&#39;re supposed to have all the answers. And you don&#39;t, do you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This book (used) is available for just a few dollars, and offers a wealth of information. Besides talking about why going right into college can be a mistake for some, the book discusses alternative education and entry into the workforce via internship or volunteerism. It also discusses ways to travel internationally for those young adults who may seek this opportunity. I found the book easy to read and was impressed with the breadth of coverage.<br/>
<br/>
I also recommend the following websites for exploration. The first one, from the Employment and Training Administration, lists free online resources for job seekers. These include tools to assess one&#39;s interests, as well as career exploration sites. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.doleta.gov/jobseekers/career_options.cfm">http://www.doleta.gov/jobseekers/career_options.cfm</a><br/>
<br/>
The second site is affiliated with the Career One Stop centers. It has links that describe many different jobs with their estimated wages, projected growth, necessary skills, potential education and training, etc. You are prompted to enter your state so the database can give you state information on wages and projected openings, as well as national information. The site also has videos that describe jobs (at a very basic level).<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.careeronestop.org/ExploreCareers/ExploreCareers.aspx">http://www.careeronestop.org/ExploreCareers/ExploreCareers.aspx</a> <br/>
<br/>
The third site is the Bureau of Labor Statistics Career Guide to Industries. This site discusses information from a broader context than the second site, and it includes an interesting section on working conditions that talks about hours and physical environment. It also provides references for national-level organizations in the respective industries.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/home.htm">http://www.bls.gov/oco/cg/home.htm</a><br/>
