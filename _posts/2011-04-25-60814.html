I started to write this to you in an email and then I thought it might be<br/>
appropriate for the list. I&#39;m probably not the only parent who sometimes<br/>
finds transitions a challenge. When I&#39;m writing a book, as I am now, I&#39;m &quot;in<br/>
my head&quot; a lot--immersed in the manuscript, thinking about the story,<br/>
hearing the characters speak. I have a set time of day when I write & my<br/>
husband is the one spending time with the kids, and I try to fully emerge<br/>
from book-world when *I&#39;m* the one with the children--to be present and<br/>
mindful and fun. But the transition can be difficult; sometimes the<br/>
characters in my head don&#39;t want to shut up!<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, I have developed certain habits for helping myself over<br/>
those transition moments from *focused on kids* to *focused on writing* and<br/>
vice versa. I usually transition from kids-to-writing by writing *about* the<br/>
kids for 15 or 20 minutes---that&#39;s how my blog came into being 6 years ago.<br/>
The writing-to-kids transition takes more mental effort, if I&#39;ve been deep<br/>
into the work--it can be a bit like when you wake up from a vivid dream and<br/>
you&#39;re groggy and distracted for a few minutes. Lately my favorite way to<br/>
make the transition is to visit your Just Add Light and Stir blog. It&#39;s like<br/>
a little shot of mental mom-espresso for my brain, a stimulant for the part<br/>
of me that wants to be present and attentive and cheerful when I walk back<br/>
out into this houseful of kids. So I wanted to thank you for those posts.<br/>
They make me eager to zoom back out into the &quot;big noisy peace,&quot; to borrow<br/>
your excellent phrase, and join in the fun.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m fond of the people in my head, but the people in my house are better!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
<br/>

Also, it&#39;s a little embarrassing, because tomorrow&#39;s isn&#39;t so much &quot;be present&quot; as some of them are, so I hope you don&#39;t need one much tomorrow. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2091966441">dear all, dear Lissa.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m catia from Portugal/ Lisbon.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a lurker in this list from February (i think).<br/>
<br/>
My sun is 18 months and i&#39;m a stay at home mum who also tries to work  <br/>
at nigth and during the baby naps.<br/>
  My work is 100% computer based and requires great concentration  <br/>
(boring readings and repports) and i&#39;m strugling since last summer  <br/>
(when Sebastião started walking ans sleeping less and less) to have  <br/>
work donne with quality and on time.<br/>
<br/>
Lissa, your message arrived just on the rigth moment. I was here, on  <br/>
the computer, thinking &quot;i have to work, i have to wortk&quot; but not  <br/>
finding the motivation to do it so i start reading the list messages.  <br/>
Perfect, instead of strugling with my need to read about parentig i  <br/>
will use it as a strategy, as you do. Anyway, thats what i do all the  <br/>
time :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks :)<br/>
