<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024347550">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
After reading so many posts about how great Halo is and Halo2, I told my gaming scifi loving hubby about them, he spent the weekend playing the demo for Halo and now has purchased it. So here is my worry of the week. Riley loves it and the content iseems very mature. He is 8. Tim has always kept first person shotting type games for when the kids were not home, something gets to me when I see them looking down the barrel of a gun. My issue for sure and I have been working on it. Now I am here asking, do other young kids play these games? How have you talked about the fantasy reality issue. I know I am making mental connections that may not be reality, just my worries, but I am nervous because my son is immature in his ability to handle his strong emotions. <br/>
<br/>
Help.. He loves the game and I want to love it along with him, or at least tolerate it, but my own garbage in my head is making me tense. He and Tim talk for hours about the story line, Tim likes to show him all kinds of neat things about the graphics and the missions. Very much passion sharing experience between these two and games. So far I have kept my thoughts to myself, encouraged them to enjoy the game together, and simply stayed out of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836077123">My son, Quentin, is 9 & LOVES Halo2.  He also plays it<br/>
a lot with his dad.  They got hooked on Halo while<br/>
playing it at a cousin&#39;s house Thanksgiving 2003.  Q&#39;s<br/>
cousin was 10 at the time & they had it set up for 4<br/>
players on a movie screen in the garage.  So the boys<br/>
played against their dads & beat them!  The kids, of<br/>
course, were thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t really stomach the shooting so I try to stay<br/>
out of the room.  Luckily they have earphones so I<br/>
don&#39;t have to hear it either.  I had the same concerns<br/>
as you, but, like you, I realized they were my problem<br/>
& not my son&#39;s.  So I&#39;ve not played it with him, but<br/>
I&#39;ve not discouraged it either.  And I did buy him a<br/>
cool Halo art book and some little Halo figurines for<br/>
Xmas.<br/>

More often, kids remind moms that it&#39;s not al.<br/>

Zature in his ability to handle his strong emotions. &gt;&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s not an  emotional kind of game.  Frustration at not playing well might <br/>
cause emotion, but he could get frustrated with Link or Zelda or Mario.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I have a good idea for you.  Find Red vs. Blue.  They&#39;re short online <br/>
animations based on Halo.  It will soothe you lots.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Sounds like a done deal.  <br/>
So you don&#39;t need advice about whether you should let the kid play, you want <br/>
to have justifications?<br/>
<br/>
How do you feel about fairy tales?<br/>
Robin Hood?<br/>
<br/>
On this page there&#39;s a link to an article on violent games:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games/page">http://sandradodd.com/games/page</a><br/>
<br/>
and even if you read it before, it might be time to read it again with Halo <br/>
II in mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702219272">My son, Jonathan 7, has been playing video games (or watching me play them) since he was about 4 years old.  I worried about the violence in games as mild as Mario<br/>
<br/>
He has always had a very intense personality, fond of physical contact of any kind.  He has struggled with controlling his urge to hit any person or thing within range when he&#39;s frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
He has progressed to more sophisticated and violent games as he aged.  He has also come a long way in controlling his need for intensity to be more considerate of others.  One could argue that the games have given him a harmless outlet for fondness of action.  This be true to some extent but I think he would be more mature in his actions with or without them.  His capacity for compassion and empathy have grown, the usual requirements for sociable behavior.<br/>
<br/>
Either way, I don&#39;t believe the violence has been &quot;bad&quot; for him.  He knows that it&#39;s a game and imaginary, he even knows how &quot;bloody&quot; the violence will be depending on the rating; &#39;E&#39;, &#39;T&#39; or &#39;M&#39;.  He tells me that he isn&#39;t ready for M games, &quot;They&#39;re too bloody.&quot;  I have to admit that I REALLY don&#39;t want to have &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; in my house but I hope I can put aside my own squeamishness to at least talk about it reasonably with him.  I&#39;m sure the day is coming when GTA or some game like it will be purchased and played, he is trusted to make these decisions and he will understand why I probably won&#39;t play it too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-253704913">That is a point I&#39;ve never considered.  When Jonathan and I discuss this <br/>
it&#39;s always about the violence IN the game.  I don&#39;t recall ever saying that <br/>
HE was being violent just that the game contained violence.  I like that you <br/>
brought up that point, however, it will be good to keep that in mind when <br/>
I&#39;m talking about it with Jonathan.<br/>
