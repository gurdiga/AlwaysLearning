<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060669239"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;Empty nest syndrome!  Anyone with older kids can relate to that.  I watch<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my beautiful babies-come-adults maturing hourly - yikes!   I love each<br/>
phase, and I&#39;m delighted with them as people, but I miss those baby years<br/>
too.  Life was simple.  Not easy, back-breaking, but simple.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You know, Retta, this feeling does get recreated once you have<br/>
grandchildren.  We regularly take my 19 month old grandson for two or three<br/>
days at a time.  I bought him a wooden puzzle last week thinking that he<br/>
might be a little too young for it.  He mastered it the same day!  I think<br/>
it&#39;s more of a joy to watch him play because I am older and I appreciate how<br/>
wonderful every little thing he does is, but also, now that I am older, it<br/>
is also a joy when he goes home.<br/>
