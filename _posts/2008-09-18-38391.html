&lt;&lt;&lt;There&#39;s music people listen to to psych themselves  up for jockish <br/>
endeavors. There&#39;s music people play to help them fall  asleep. It&#39;s <br/>
very unlikely to be the same  music!&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s always that exception... Dave listens to heavy metal (thrash/death  <br/>
metal, to be specific) for psyching himself up, when he needs energy, to  chill <br/>
out *and* to sleep. I, personally, can&#39;t fall asleep to music-I have too  <br/>
much urge to sing, dance, keep rhythm, hum, move. All that keeps me awake. Dave  <br/>
falls asleep to music that is so fast and hard, I can&#39;t listen to it except <br/>
when  I&#39;m in the *right* mood. I don&#39;t know if one has anything to do with <br/>
another,  but he can fall asleep almost anywhere-including once standing up at an <br/>
airport.  For a person like me, who needs conditions *just so* to be able to <br/>
fall asleep,  it escapes my understanding. But it *does* exist. :~D  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1283852573">Funny and true!  Skylar can listen to metal at any time for just about<br/>
any purpose.  I sometimes wonder if his wedding song will be Iron<br/>
Maiden&#39;s  &quot;Deadly Sinners&quot;.  When my husband and I first got together<br/>
he listen to music all night long through his sleep, much of it was<br/>
punk rock - which was not different than his choices during the day. <br/>
I can fall asleep to anything.  :-)<br/>
