 I feel much better now.  If you are going to blast my new <br/>
 understanding, please let me down gently. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pat,<br/>
I&#39;ve so enjoyed your open, honest questions that have led to much discussion. <br/>
You&#39;ve hung in there while people asked these very blunt questions, and <br/>
really searched yourself it seems.<br/>
I love hearing how it has changed your views and brought more joy to your <br/>
life.<br/>
Isn&#39;t it wonderful?<br/>
I can relate only too well, this journey to radical unschooling can be a bit <br/>
bumpy at first, but once you get those &quot;Aha&quot; moments, everything just falls <br/>
into place!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A BIT BUMPY?  This journey to unschooling has been the hardest thing <br/>
I&#39;ve done since overcoming an eating disorder 20 years ago.  I was <br/>
beginning to wonder if it was worth all I was putting myself <br/>
through.  But of course you know it is and I may even cherish this <br/>
new lifestyle more because it has been so hard to come by.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ready to change my email logon name but it won&#39;t be anything <br/>
creative.  I&#39;m even ready to send in some pictures!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been doing some reading over at unschooling.dotcom.  I&#39;m amazed <br/>
at what you all will subject yourselves to in order to help people <br/>
like me understand &quot;real&quot; unschooling.  The people that are arguing <br/>
that some are too hard on newbies would do well to listen to what is <br/>
being said for their *own* benefit and stop worrying about who may <br/>
leave the list because they don&#39;t want to make any changes to their <br/>
lives.  <br/>
<br/>
In any event, my family and I would not be embarking on the great <br/>
adventure we are today if you had told me what I was doing was fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

mention that it came from me.<br/>
<br/>
A few of the people from unschooling-dotcom helped me during the <br/>
beginning of my unschooling attempts.  This was back around the <br/>
beginning of the year.  There was a lot of squabbling going on at <br/>
that time as well and a few people decided to start their own list to <br/>
be kinder and more welcoming to newbies.  They invited me to join <br/>
them but after reading some of the *meanist* posts I have ever read, <br/>
written by the same people that were starting a new list that was <br/>
supposed to be kind, I decided to come over here to Sandra&#39;s list.<br/>
<br/>
There seems to be some kind of power struggle going on.  If it is not <br/>
a power struggle, then the only other explanation is they don&#39;t <br/>
really get the nuances of unschooling and are arguing out of <br/>
ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
At first glance, it appears that *both* sides are just being stubborn <br/>
and would do well to end the discussion when it is apparent thing are <br/>
not going anywhere, but after evaluating the situation, I can see <br/>
that the points that are being argued are often the finer points and <br/>
are important to the bigger picture.<br/>
<br/>
In any case, it is really ashame, because people who really want to <br/>
learn get distracted by the squabbling and leave.<br/>

to try to be accepted as unschoolers.  All they have to do is try to <br/>

involved I&#39;ve seen a dozen people who want absolutely NOT to unschool but <br/>

the lists, and the irritation of other seekers to flail and flail while they <br/>
cry &quot;I AM an unschooler, I AM!&quot;<br/>

Unless it&#39;s just that unschooling is seen as the coolest, I don&#39;t know why <br/>

they would do that.<br/>
<br/>
Any good theories here?<br/>
------------<br/>
<br/>
I do think it&#39;s often because it&#39;s seen as the coolest -- i.e, &quot;the most<br/>
exclusive&quot; club, the clique that sets the trends. Also, we have most of the<br/>
good and passionate writers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are people who say-they-unschool (or more often, say they WANT to<br/>
unschool) but don&#39;t because of fear -- that the kids will turn out to be<br/>
apes or worse.<br/>
<br/>
There is a whole different and much-less-wholesome group who say they<br/>
unschool (and mostly INSIST that they unschool) but don&#39;t and I really think<br/>
it&#39;s because of meanness -- they aren&#39;t afraid the kids won&#39;t learn, they&#39;re<br/>
afraid the kids will have too much fun and too nice a life (I know that<br/>
sounds really, really horrible, but the way some of this category talks<br/>
about their kids and their imagined &quot;learning disabilities&quot; and &quot;won&#39;t stop<br/>
watching TV&quot; and &quot;never does anything academic&quot; what other conclusion can be<br/>
drawn? Unless they are so desperate to be &quot;interesting&quot; that their kids HAVE<br/>
to have these problems?)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the second group that makes me grind my teeth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500889503"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Any good theories here?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s an outgrowth of their real life (as oppossed to virtual) where <br/>
true, radical unschoolers are scarce. So, compared to everyone around them, <br/>
they are used to being the most relaxed, the easiest going, the most <br/>
liberal, the closest to unschooling as they understand it. The coolest, <br/>
maybe? That is, compared to school at homers and rigid curriculum types. <br/>
Maybe even compared to unit study advocates, Charlotte Mason followers or <br/>
eclectics.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s very hard to then come online, thinking you&#39;ve got it all <br/>
nailed down, to find out you&#39;re still way more rigid than the radical <br/>
unschoolers you&#39;re chatting with. I think it becomes very unsettling. They <br/>
were used to the liberal, easy going, unschooler label IRL. Some of the <br/>
online debates threaten to take them even further to the radical side. A <br/>
place they might not be prepared to go to. At the same time, they&#39;re not <br/>
willing to give up their IRL unschooler status.<br/>

&quot;practice drills (for math),&quot; etc.  So, recently I sent her more detailed<br/>

Guest Opinion: Let&#39;s work to stop snuffing out joys of learning<br/>
<br/>
ANDREW HANSON<br/>
Tucson Citizen<br/>
May 30, 2002<br/>
<br/>
&quot;A child said, &#39;What is the grass?&#39;<br/>
fetching it to me with full hands;<br/>
How could I answer the child?<br/>
I do not know what it is any more than he.&quot;<br/>
- Walt Whitman<br/>
I recently checked out from the school library a PBS video on the emergence <br/>
of democracy in Athens in the sixth century B.C.<br/>
<br/>
It was rich and beautifully done. But as I savored the beauty of the Greek <br/>
art, the wonder of those times, I couldn&#39;t help but reflect on how the <br/>
average high school student would react to this video.<br/>
<br/>
As you can imagine, the kids would be somewhat attentive. After all, it&#39;s <br/>
on TV, a central icon in their world. But few would engage the material in <br/>
any meaningful way.<br/>
<br/>
If encouraged by the promise of a quiz, or if given a worksheet of <br/>
questions, a large number would dutifully watch for the required elements. <br/>
Many would complain, openly or in private, depending on the temper of the <br/>
class, that the video was boring or irrelevant. And that would be an honest <br/>
assessment.<br/>
For them it is boring.<br/>
<br/>
Herein lies the central paradox of modern education. Never before have so <br/>
many images, so much information, such diverse perspectives, been <br/>
accessible for study. Yet for millions of young people, this wealth may as <br/>
well not exist.<br/>
<br/>
They have no passion for learning through study. They do not feel the <br/>
curiosity, the fascination and wonder that fuel the genuine search for <br/>
understanding. Their motivation to learn has been severely damaged.<br/>
<br/>
Look at the young people around you. Talk with them. Do they care about <br/>
history, science or literature? What percentage of our youth can talk <br/>
intelligently about anything academic? How many read for pleasure?<br/>
<br/>
The answers do not paint a portrait of a youth with a thirst for knowledge. <br/>
But if we assume that this child entered the school system many years ago <br/>
with what Plutarch called &quot;that love of inquiry and observation which <br/>
nature has implanted in our souls,&quot; we must ask, what has happened?How did <br/>
that bubbly, enthusiastic 5-year-old turn into a teen-ager who would rather <br/>
do anything but study?<br/>
<br/>
The deepest, most critical fault in our formal schooling has been the <br/>
systematic creation of the passive learner. By controlling virtually all of <br/>
the important decisions in the student&#39;s life - what, when, why and how to <br/>
learn - the well-intentioned adults working in education have unwittingly <br/>
designed a disaster.It&#39;s easy to see why educators would want to control <br/>
these decisions. One might argue that the professionals know best, that <br/>
such matters are too important to leave to the judgment of children, and so <br/>
on. But the fatal flaw is that the essential questions of what and how to <br/>
learn are intrinsic to the learning process.<br/>
<br/>
Forcing children to learn works no better than leading the proverbial horse <br/>
to water, as our current difficulties so amply illustrate. In contrast, <br/>
passionate learners pose their own questions, set their own goals and <br/>
quench their own thirst. By denying children the opportunity to follow <br/>
their hearts, replacing that model with one in which everything is decided <br/>
for them, we create passive, if not resisting, students whose only <br/>
authentic problem becomes how best to please the teacher and get the <br/>
highest grade for the least amount of effort.<br/>
<br/>
Large amounts of research and commentary are directed at the formidable <br/>
challenge of better controlling the children and the curriculum. But no <br/>
matter how much we sugarcoat the work - or bully, cajole and manage the <br/>
kids, or the teachers, for that matter - into &quot;covering&quot; the curriculum and <br/>
being &quot;on task,&quot; we are not treating the root cause of the disease.<br/>
We only address the symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
The drive to improve control over the children misses the whole point. We <br/>
don&#39;t need better control. We need less control. We&#39;re talking more power <br/>
and freedom for the children to take charge of their very destinies and <br/>
souls. The scariest thing is to let go and trust the students, but that is <br/>
exactly what we must do from the earliest years of schooling.<br/>
<br/>
The social and economic costs of persisting in the educational status quo <br/>
are immense. Alienation, aimlessness, acting out, dropping out, these <br/>
problems and many more are intimately connected to the systematic snuffing <br/>
out of the joy of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Active learners don&#39;t need to be kept busy. They are impatiently searching, <br/>
experimenting, testing and questioning. They are healthy humans engaged in <br/>
the most marvelous of pursuits.<br/>
<br/>
The passive learners are not responsible for this sadly dysfunctional <br/>
situation. They are the victims. To rob a child of his natural urge to <br/>
study through the imposition of mindless busywork is simply criminal.<br/>
<br/>
As citizens, parents and educators, we need to carefully examine and own <br/>
our roles in this tragedy. Change is possible, but we must develop a <br/>
collective will to revolutionize schooling.<br/>
Can we afford not to?<br/>

&lt;&lt; They <br/>
were used to the liberal, easy going, unschooler label IRL. Some of the <br/>
online debates threaten to take them even further to the radical side. A <br/>
place they might not be prepared to go to. At the same time, they&#39;re not <br/>
willing to give up their IRL unschooler status. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Mary&#39;s theory makes a ton of sense.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s been an argument made lately &quot;on another network&quot; (as the talkshow <br/>
hosts say) that unschooling should only apply to that part of life set aside <br/>
for learning.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a stunning statement, to me, because anyone who sets part of their life <br/>
aside for learning is not unschooling optimally, and from my personal <br/>
perspective, not really unschooling at all.<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling is scheduled, then that seems to imply that non-unschooling <br/>
hours are...  fun?  relaxation?  Non-learning time?    It doesn&#39;t work that <br/>
way in any family in which I&#39;ve seen it work.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Friday we&#39;re going to do some freeform learning.&quot;<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re going to take the summer off and then unschool again in the fall.&quot;<br/>

Doesn&#39;t work.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sometimes people are just drawn to worrying as a way of being.  And <br/>
unworried<br/>
people freak them out big time.  Worrying *seems* so diligent.  Relaxing seems<br/>
so dilatory. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So it&#39;s the last vestige of the puritan work ethic among unschoolers maybe? <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not going to teach and force and test math, at least you can keep <br/>
up a steady stream of active CONCERN about math.<br/>
<br/>
It is true that people have said a dozen or a hundred times to me (I quit <br/>
counting and paying attention when the question started to sound like &quot;What <br/>
about socialization?&quot; to me)  &quot;SO, you don&#39;t care if they learn math?<br/>
&quot;So you don&#39;t care whether they can get into college?&quot;<br/>
So..... you don&#39;t care whether they learn to read?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little like &quot;So you don&#39;t use books?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First off it shows a lack of awareness of the concept.<br/>
But more than that, it&#39;s a full-on insult.  It&#39;s like &quot;Well unschooling is <br/>
fine for *you* people, but in *my* family we would like for our children to <br/>
be able to support themselves and not be on welfare.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t care whether they learn to read, it&#39;s that I know that <br/>
my worrying doesn&#39;t create reading experience, it only creates worry.   And I <br/>
haven&#39;t worried since Kirby started reading, because after I saw that I knew <br/>
without the slightest doubt that the others WOULD read.  Not might, not &quot;I&#39;ll <br/>
give it a while before I give up,&quot; but knew for sure it would come.<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s a good answer for &quot;So you don&#39;t care if your child learns to read?&quot;<br/>
Many who ask that aren&#39;t delving, they&#39;re just on a fault-finding mission so <br/>
they can reject unschooling without much trouble.  Or they want justification <br/>
for their worry and micro-management of kids&#39; lives.  Or they&#39;re making <br/>
conversation in the &quot;Hi/what&#39;s your name/what grade are you in/do you like <br/>
your teacher&quot; formulaic way.<br/>
<br/>
If I say &quot;Yes, I care...&quot; then they&#39;ll want me to prove it by showing how I&#39;m <br/>
helping them or testing them or whatever.<br/>
If I say &quot;No, I don&#39;t care...&quot; then it will be AHA!!! I KNEW YOU WERE <br/>
NEGLECTFUL AND IGNORANT!<br/>
<br/>
I get requests sometimes (one today, in fact, in writing) from people wanting <br/>
me to help them choose a curriculum and let them know where to buy one.  I <br/>
just give them links to www.unschooling.com and sandradodd.com/unschooling <br/>
and tell them there are links from there to all kinds of information.<br/>
<br/>
If they follow enough of those links they&#39;ll come to something that has links <br/>
to the information they want.  But I cannot and will not help someone set up <br/>
a structured homeschooling situation.  There are salesmen to do that.  I want <br/>
no more guilt on me for the tears of frustrated  children.  I have more than <br/>
a lifetime&#39;s guilt from the years I taught in public school.<br/>

<br/>
The subtext seems to be that worry is the handle by which they can grab<br/>
you and control you.  And it probably works on a lot of people.  The<br/>
types of statements that you&#39;ve had aimed at you are clearly intended to<br/>
be manipulative.<br/>
<br/>
**If you&#39;re not going to teach and force and test math, at least you can<br/>
keep up a steady stream of active CONCERN about math.**<br/>
<br/>
I think you hit the bullseye there.<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler who is sometimes unsteady in my faith, I sublimate my<br/>
concern about math by buying all the cool math resources I can find.<br/>
Most of the books (Miquon, H. Jacobs, Family Math) are just collecting<br/>
dust.  The good news about my worry habit is that I have enough math<br/>
books now that I don&#39;t need to buy anymore when worry strikes.  I just<br/>
go pat the ones I have until I feel better.  &lt;g&gt; (I&#39;ve got 27 -- good<br/>
grief! Worry is a powerful force.  Wonder if they would work their<br/>
anti-worry mojo on me just as well if I buried them in the front yard?)<br/>
<br/>
**It&#39;s a little like &quot;So you don&#39;t use books?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
First off it shows a lack of awareness of the concept.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m gonna whisper a couple of insults right back at them.  This sounds<br/>
like the conclusion that would be reached by a person that has never<br/>
voluntarily held a book, except when forced to in school.  How else<br/>
could they believe that textbooks issued by the school district are the<br/>
only books that exist or are the only books with meaningful content?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to stop here, for a minute.  But I&#39;m still thinking about all<br/>
of the ideas in your post.<br/>
