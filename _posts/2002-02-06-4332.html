<div id="ygrps-yiv-911397227">Wanted to say thanks to everyone for the creative input on the puppets for<br/>
Abby&#39;s 7th birthday party.<br/>
    The youngsters had a blast making puppets.  They had many choices and<br/>
materials (sock, etc.)  I had cut out two full &#39;bodies&#39; from cardboard per<br/>
someone&#39;s suggestion - these were *the* runaway favorites.  This meant I had<br/>
to cut out about 8 more cardboard bodies during the party....setting things<br/>
behind a bit,  which was ok for most of us.    So with the cardboard bodies,<br/>
they used felt, pipecleaners,  whatever to create outfits and &#39;looks&#39;.  One<br/>
boy made his into an adorable clown,  another was fully attired in pipe<br/>
cleaners...fron curly yellow hair down to blue bell bottoms.<br/>
    After food and singing,  etc.,  the ones who could stay put on a great<br/>
puppet show.<br/>
gracias again,<br/>
Susan</div>
