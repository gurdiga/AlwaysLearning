<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; *** An example I recently heard was a parent whose child practically<br/>
&gt; implored<br/>
&gt; them to &quot;make her&quot; follow through with some goal or other, because the<br/>
&gt; child<br/>
&gt; knew she was likely to back down from the work when the time came, but<br/>
&gt; truly<br/>
&gt; wanted to achieve the overall goal.***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would wonder if the child wanted to achieve the goal for her own<br/>
&gt; reasons or because she knew it would be pleasing to her mom.  That would<br/>
&gt; be my first question, because I&#39;ve never known anyone who needed to be<br/>
&gt; &quot;made&quot; to do something they really wanted to do.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Same thing happened with us, and I can testify that the things Julian wanted <br/>
to do had nothing to do with any of his myriad of parents or other relatives. <br/>
He found it was easier sitting and playing the computer games, and he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t get around to other stuff he really wanted to do. So, at HIS <br/>
request, I occasionally ask him what he wants to do today, and if he doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to be getting around to them, I ask if he wants to. He almost always <br/>
shifts gears and starts doing the thing he&#39;d planned.<br/>
<br/>
I can realte because I am EXACTLY the same way. I want to finish the (insert <br/>
appropriate swear words here) book I am writing. I REALLY do. But it&#39;s easier <br/>
to play on the web, or, well, most anything. So I&#39;m trying to set things up <br/>
so I HAVE to do it. I have friends nudge me. I gave church people permission <br/>
to ask how it&#39;s coming. <br/>
<br/>
I would love to be the kind of person who just did stuff they wanted to do <br/>
without that outside push. But I&#39;m not, so I try to set things up to fight my <br/>
natural urges. Julian is doing the same thing. I don&#39;t make him do stuff....I <br/>
just remind him he wants to (or said he did). Whether he does or not is up to <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
The cool thing is that he&#39;s older, and now he&#39;ll say to me....&quot;Hey, <br/>
mama...didn&#39;t you want to work on your book today?&quot;  Nudging can be an act of <br/>
love....if the person KNOWS you want to be nudged.<br/>
<br/>

here) book is coming)<br/>

<br/>
I had it all worked out how &quot;someone needs to *make* me&quot;  was a condition<br/>
of only people who had been herded through the public school system, and<br/>
not at all of free and inspired young unschoolers.  Dang.<br/>
<br/>
But your  &quot;I occasionally ask him&quot;   sounds much nicer than &quot;make her&quot;<br/>
and I guess a big difference would be in whether, if the kid had changed<br/>
his or her mind and didn&#39;t want to do the thing after all, that would be<br/>
ok too.   <br/>
<br/>
I had my doubts because I have been know to say I want to mow the lawn<br/>
tomorrow, when what I really mean is I want the lawn to be mown and<br/>
looking nice.  I don&#39;t really have a desire to be out there cutting it,<br/>
only the desire for it to not look like Ma and Pa Kettle live here and<br/>
all the goats have wandered off.  <br/>

As do I.  And if he decides he really just wants to play the game, or <br/>
whatever (it could be reading a book, for that matter), it&#39;s fine. <br/>
<br/>
As far as the lawn is concerned, Julian mows and we pay him to do it. It&#39;s a <br/>
bigger, pain in the neck job that we&#39;d happily pay a neighbor kid for, so we <br/>
offer money to Julian for it instead. He&#39;s happy, we&#39;re happy.<br/>
