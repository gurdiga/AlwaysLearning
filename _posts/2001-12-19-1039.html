<div id="ygrps-yiv-1372475910">Another really interesting Florida word is &quot;Buggies&quot; ...<br/>
as in Shopping cart. <br/>
They have been carts my entire life, and here I am in a place where it&#39;s <br/>
suddenly Buggies? Weird.<br/>
<br/>
As to the Santa issue...we&#39;ve tried not to make a big deal out of it either <br/>
way.<br/>
I will not lie to my children, trust is too important.<br/>
But it&#39;s fun to indulge in the fantasy when they are little. We play along <br/>
and put cinnamon rolls out for Santa (dh&#39;s favorite treat) and carrots for <br/>
the reindeer. But when they ask questions about Santa I answer honestly. No, <br/>
there isn&#39;t a fat man that comes down the chimney, but we sure love <br/>
pretending he does.<br/>
And I still believe in what Santa stands for....fun, gifts, holiday, giving, <br/>
cheer etc.....<br/>
It&#39;s great fun, but my older kids have known for a while that we sign gifts <br/>
&quot;Santa&quot;.<br/>
