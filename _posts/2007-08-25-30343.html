<div id="ygrps-yiv-2109122134">I have an e-mail to share with this group.  Someone has started a  <br/>
group for grandparents of unschoolers, and it looks good.<br/>
<br/>
The author&#39;s photo was in the e-mail, but it&#39;s at the link below,  <br/>
too.  I know several of you have parents who are supportive and have  <br/>
gone to conferences and such, and they might be interested in this.<br/>

Hi Sandra, I&#39;m sending you the following in the event that you would  <br/>
know of some grandparents who would like to join my group.  I thought  <br/>
that getting grandparents together would be a good way to support our  <br/>
children and grandchildren as they UNschool, stepping away from  <br/>
systems and methods and fostering natural and independent learning.<br/>
I enjoy reading your site!  Thanks! Collette<br/>

My name is Collette Deneault and I am a retired teacher of 30+ years,  <br/>
grades 2 to 8.  I have three daughters and 5 grandchildren ages  <br/>
6,5,3,2,1.  I was re-introduced to Unschooling through my daughters  <br/>
who are Unschooling their children. I first ran into the term in the  <br/>
60&#39;s while in college. I embraced the philosophy way back then but at  <br/>
the time I was young and was sure that I could &quot;save the world&quot;.   I  <br/>
enjoyed my years in the classroom but after living the reprecussions  <br/>
of teaching to the test, testing, collecting data, making graphs and  <br/>
oh yes, teaching, I am thrilled to know that my grandchildren will  <br/>
not be part of the cloning that goes on in the schools. My last four  <br/>
years in education were spent trying to beat the system.  It appears  <br/>
that schools just don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know. Fortunately for  <br/>
me, three of my grandkids live next door so I am able to be part of  <br/>
their life each and every day.  I enjoy seeing them freely going  <br/>
about their day learning. It&#39;s exciting to know that while kids at  <br/>
school are learning to count by 5&#39;s etc., my grandkids are following  <br/>
their passions. I&#39;m hoping that this Grandma Group will be a way for  <br/>
all of us to support each other, our children and our grandchildren  <br/>
as we live and learn together.<br/>
