My husband wants to make sure Lukas has a realistic picture of people<br/>
before he&#39;s grown. He wants Lukas to know that most people are<br/>
cruel,back stabbing,only out for themselves and so on. He wants Lukas<br/>
to know that the world is a cold,hard place and no one is going to<br/>
give a rats ass about him(except his wife,girlfriend).<br/>
 My experiance has brought me to know this is true also. I was very<br/>
trusting and naive growing up and i was molested,ripped off, tricked<br/>
and so on. My husband said if i think the world is a beautiful<br/>
place(meaning peoplewise) I am dreaming.<br/>
I am thinking how to go about letting Lukas know this or if we should?<br/>
What&#39;s you all&#39;s take on it?<br/>

live in goodness if you choose to- even in the middle of harshness<br/>

most people are good people but if you think the world is ugly then <br/>
ugly is what you get- if you think the world is good that is also what <br/>
you get<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321382080">&quot;What the thinker thinks, the prover proves. The human mind can be <br/>
viewed as having two main functions: a thinker and a prover. The <br/>
thinker can think anything. The prover has no such choice: whatever the <br/>
thinker thinks, the prover arranges all incoming information to prove <br/>
that thought to be true. <br/>
<br/>
If a person believes they are stupid, their prover will sort and filter <br/>
all incoming data to prove that belief to be true. If they believe they <br/>
are clever, the prover will sort and filter incoming data to prove that <br/>
belief true. If you believe you will always be poor, that life is <br/>
unfair, and that people are basically rotten, your prover will find <br/>
evidence of those beliefs. If you believe that you can become <br/>
fantastically wealthy, that life is a wonderful adventure, and that <br/>
people are intrinsically good, your prover will create an iron clad <br/>
case to prove those beliefs to be correct. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, over time, the external reality of your life comes into line <br/>
with whatever you&#39;ve been thinking. So if you&#39;re unsure about what you <br/>
believe, there&#39;s an easy way to find out: have a look around! Your <br/>
external circumstances are the physical manifestation of your beliefs. <br/>
<br/>
You might even like to ask yourself what beliefs it would be useful for <br/>
you to have. What the thinker thinks, the prover proves.&quot;<br/>

Some will be a great help. Some will want to squash others down  <br/>
because they feel they only way to keep on top is by squashing the  <br/>
competition. And all sorts in between.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He wants Lukas to know that most people are<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is no more realistic than believing that everyone is nice.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My experiance has brought me to know this is true also. I was very<br/>

&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While predators are drawn to the naive, whole and happy people are  <br/>
drawn to whole and happy people.<br/>
<br/>
Turning your son into a cynic may protect him from predators, but it  <br/>
will also make him see everyone as a predator. He will take on  <br/>
aspects of Scrooge who saw everyone as coming to take what he had.  <br/>
People who don&#39;t appreciate being thought of as grasping will avoid  <br/>
him. Nice people don&#39;t like being seen as evil so they won&#39;t be drawn  <br/>
to be friends with him.<br/>
<br/>
So it will be self fulfilling. He&#39;ll will drive away the nice people  <br/>
and only the fellow cynics will hang out with him. So the world will  <br/>
seem like it&#39;s full of nasty people.<br/>

the world is that way because that is how they are. My husband and <br/>
mother are both very pesimistic and cynical. It amazes me how often <br/>
they &quot;get screwed.&quot; Funny how it doesn&#39;t happen to me very often. I try <br/>
to assume that people are doing the best they can because I know I am. <br/>
So much of life is perception. When someone is a coniving, mean, <br/>
underhanded person they assume everyone else is the same way. That is <br/>
thier mindset. <br/>

devastating consequences for your son.  Can you really look around your<br/>
personal world - not the TV world or the News Reports - and say that<br/>
MOST of the people you know are cruel and back-stabbing?  Does this<br/>
include you and your husband?  Does it include the people you work with,<br/>
your family and neighbors?  To live with this fearful, angry, harsh,<br/>
judgmental view of people must create a very unhappy life. Is this<br/>
really what you want to pass on to your child to carry with him the rest<br/>
of his life?<br/>

&gt; and so on. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Im sorry that you have had some terrible things happen to you.  I know<br/>
that it can be hard to not see the world as a negative place when you&#39;ve<br/>
had such negative experiences.  I don&#39;t know you and can&#39;t begin to<br/>
understand the circumstances that brought you to that place, however I<br/>
do think that there was a lot more going on than just being naïve and<br/>
trusting.<br/>
<br/>
As some have already mentioned, our thoughts and beliefs are a huge<br/>
factor in how we experience the world.  And Im not just talking about<br/>
the spiritual belief in Law of Attraction or &quot;The Secret.&quot;   You don&#39;t<br/>
have to believe in that in order to benefit from an attitude that the<br/>
world is generally a safe and good place. <br/>
<br/>
There is a growing field called Positive Psychology that has done some<br/>
serious research on the benefits of having a positive outlook on life.<br/>
People who see the world in generally positive ways tend to be<br/>
healthier, live longer and report the most satisfaction in life.  This<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that bad things don&#39;t happen to them, but they have a<br/>
resiliency that helps them through negative events.  People who don&#39;t<br/>
hold on to past grudges and find things to be grateful for and who are<br/>
optimistic about their future live happier, healthier lives.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways to teach your son how to be cautious and smart about his<br/>
interactions in the world without setting him up with huge emotional<br/>
armor and fear.  From an Unschooling perspective, the greatest thing you<br/>
can do for your child is to help him cultivate his inner resources to<br/>
make wise choices about his safety and the people he befriends or comes<br/>
in contact with.  <br/>
<br/>
We all have a type of radar within us that draws us to those who match<br/>
our ideas about the world.  This is mostly done unconsciously.  For<br/>
example, in my younger years, all the men I met and dated seemed to be<br/>
alcoholic philanderers.  All the men my friends dated matched that same<br/>
description.  Most all of my friends had really dysfunctional<br/>
relationships.  When I discovered the power of my beliefs and thoughts I<br/>
began to change that reality.  I started looking around for other<br/>
examples of nice men.  I made a conscious choice to find couples who<br/>
were in loving, committed healthy relationships. I started working on my<br/>
own self-esteem and changing what I believed was possible in a<br/>
relationship. It took dedication and some time, but soon I started<br/>
meeting men who were not alcoholics and started befriending women who<br/>
were in good relationships.  I met and married my husband, who is<br/>
genuinely an honest and good person.  Now I can say that MOST of the men<br/>
I meet are just really nice hard-working loving guys.  This doesn&#39;t mean<br/>
that I don&#39;t come into contact with men who are not nice, but they are<br/>
just simply not on my radar anymore.  If I do meet them, I don&#39;t choose<br/>
to engage or I&#39;m just not interested in doing business with them, etc.<br/>
Empowering your child to know that he has ability to attract nice, safe,<br/>
caring people into his life can be the greatest gift you give him. <br/>
<br/>
My husband said if i think the world is a beautiful<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; place(meaning peoplewise) I am dreaming.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Heather, I do hope you seriously reconsider giving your son such a dark<br/>
view of the world.  You and your husband are his greatest influence<br/>
though, so your son has probably already picked up on your negative<br/>
attitudes and fears.  Unless you are committed to changing your own<br/>
world view, your son will most likely play out your fears in his own<br/>
life.  I hope that you look into resources that might help your whole<br/>
family have a more optimistic view (and experience) of people in your<br/>
lives.<br/>
<br/>
Wishing you the best,<br/>

<br/>
I meet all kinds of people, but the ones I &quot;keep&quot; are the honest ones.<br/>
<br/>
I told someone a few months ago that all of my friends are honest.   <br/>
He laughed at me and said I was wrong.  I was calm about it, because  <br/>
he&#39;s very young and hangs around with bullshitters, and doesn&#39;t know  <br/>
there are better people out there.   I have some new and unproven  <br/>
friends, and always have and might always have.  But as to the  <br/>
friends I trust, I only have friends I can trust.   That seems WAY  <br/>
too obvious, but if I find out someone is cruel or a liar, I quit  <br/>
considering them a go-to, confide-in friend.  If I have to deal with  <br/>
them for some reason, I do it cautiously and in a limited way.  That  <br/>
makes them acquaintances or associates, and not friends.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had years to sort through my friends, though, and lots of  <br/>
opportunities come up naturally to tell who&#39;s honest.  I never set up  <br/>
&quot;tests,&quot; ever.  I never have.  I consider that to be cruel and  <br/>
dishonest.<br/>

Here&#39;s something I read that addresses this notion quite powerfully:<br/>
<br/>
THE DAILY GROOVE ~ by Scott Noelle<br/>
www.enjoyparenting.com/dailygroove<br/>
<br/>
:: &quot;I&#39;m Not A Frog-Boiler!&quot; ::<br/>
<br/>
When you reject authoritarian, coercive parenting in<br/>
favor of non-punitive, pleasure-oriented parenting,<br/>
critics and naysayers will warn you that your child<br/>
won&#39;t be able to cope in the &quot;real&quot; world.<br/>
<br/>
The assumption is that &quot;it&#39;s a jungle out there&quot; and<br/>
we should gradually toughen up our kids and get them<br/>
used to suffering so they won&#39;t be shocked when they<br/>
venture out into the big, bad world.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s like that famous experiment where they tossed a<br/>
healthy frog in boiling water and it leaped right out.<br/>
But if they put the frog in cool water and raised the<br/>
temperature gradually over several days, the frog<br/>
would be able to *adjust* and stay in the water.<br/>
<br/>
The slow boil seems more humane, but that<br/>
&quot;well-adjusted&quot; frog eventually *died* from the heat!<br/>
Whereas the non-adjusted frog&#39;s intact sensitivity<br/>
protected it from being boiled.<br/>
<br/>
Today, look for evidence that your child&#39;s sensitivity<br/>
is intact (e.g., negative reactions to unwanted<br/>
conditions) and be *grateful* for it! Tell yourself,<br/>
&quot;My child will *never* get boiled!&quot;<br/>

When &quot;Stag&#39;s Blood&quot; is called out, it&#39;s by one of the members of that  <br/>
order, probably to his teammates who are also of that order.  That  <br/>
might have made it into a song about Trelon, but it&#39;s not an Outlands  <br/>

What Outlanders in general are most likely to yell is &quot;Outlands.&quot;<br/>

I think it&#39;s very cool, though, that you used the word &quot;slogan&quot;  <br/>
because just a couple of weeks ago we had a kind of household  <br/>

outlook...and the way you describe &quot;realistic&quot; sounds pretty <br/>
negative. I think a realistic outlook contains both the positive and <br/>
the negative, I think that is important for our kids to know. There <br/>
is a balance between good and bad...life is like a battery, there is <br/>
both a positive and a negative :-)<br/>
Peace~Love~Free~<br/>

I agree.<br/>
And it&#39;s important for parents to learn and believe and LIVE that  <br/>
they can make more positive choices, and that more positive attitudes  <br/>
make life better right that instant.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1563135775">That&#39;s true. However, in my experience at least, the word &#39;realistic&#39; <br/>
has been hijacked by people who use it to mean they think something <br/>
won&#39;t work, or it&#39;s too difficult, or they don&#39;t want you to do it, and <br/>
so on.  <br/>
