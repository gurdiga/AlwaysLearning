<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605544257">&lt;&lt;What we found out is that it was originally the former name of<br/>
Tombouctou, which is in central Mali, although it&#39;s now used to describe<br/>
any farway place.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also the name of a town in California, near Sacramento I believe. <br/>
My mother sent me a picture of the town marker sign so I would &quot;know<br/>
where it was in case someone wanted to send me there&quot;.<br/>

anywhere. I live in a small town about 50 miles from sac, and this would<br/>
be really cool to see... but the only references I can find are two that<br/>
seem hypothetical and one on a genealogy page, about someone born there<br/>
in 1864... maybe it doesn&#39;t exisit anymore?<br/>

definitely planning a trip there.  Thanks for the link Dar.<br/>

I could be experiencing a &quot;brain misfire&quot;, not unheard of for me. *grin* <br/>
This was probably 20+ years ago but I will be calling my mom for mother&#39;s<br/>
day and will ask her.  I think it was near Grass Valley and Nevada City,<br/>
there are a lot of tiny towns around there which were mining camps so the<br/>
names are often whimsical.  Some of them were so small that they could be<br/>
wiped out with the installation of a freeway.  I&#39;ll do some more<br/>
research, perhaps I have the spelling wrong, maybe Nevada City has a web<br/>
site.<br/>

Thanks for posting the web site!  It&#39;s so funny, I was thinking to<br/>
myself, &quot;Was it spelled with a &quot;too&quot; at the end?&quot;  I think I have even<br/>
driven past it at some time but it was 20+ years ago.  I was born in<br/>
Grass Valley and still have family there.  Most of the towns around that<br/>
area were once mining camps and are so small they could be easily wiped<br/>
out by the installation of a freeway.<br/>
