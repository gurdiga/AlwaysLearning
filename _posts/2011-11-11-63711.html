<div id="ygrps-yiv-1253533652">My friend, Ken, is a writing professor at Pima Community College here in<br/>
Tucson, AZ<br/>
He has 2 honors students who are interested in the transition from<br/>
homeschooling to college.<br/>
They&#39;ve put together a survey and I&#39;ve agreed to help them get it out to<br/>
the homeschooling community.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to forward to anyone you think would be interested.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

Our project is on the transition from home school to college, so the survey<br/>
is for home schooled students who ARE attending college. The parents<br/>
perspective is also relevant so both students and families would be ideal<br/>
to reply to the survey.    It is an online survey that shouldn&#39;t take<br/>
longer than 10 minutes.<br/>
