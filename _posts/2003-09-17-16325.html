<div id="ygrps-yiv-1850771722">I&#39;ve created a new Yahoo! group for people unschooling with serious <br/>
mental illness, called Unschooling and Serious Mental Illness. Here&#39;s <br/>
the description:<br/>
<br/>
This group is for those who are unschooling and dealing with serious <br/>
mental illness in the family.<br/>
<br/>
Often we find that as unschoolers we have a different mindset from our <br/>
more mainstream family and friends. This is a forum for getting together <br/>
with those who share a philosophy as well as a challenge.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be available for support and advice, as well as just being able to <br/>
hang out with someone who really does understand what we&#39;re going through.<br/>
<br/>
The link is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingMI/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/UnschoolingMI/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be posting this to all the new HEM lists and to Sandra&#39;s list, but <br/>
if you&#39;re on another Unschooling list, would you help spread the word, <br/>
please. I think this list will fill a real need that many families don&#39;t <br/>
know how to address.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
