We would love to come visit. At unschooling.com we tried to coordinate a big <br/>
camp out in St. Marks but everyone bailed out at the last minute. So one <br/>
family drove here to P&#39;cola and another family that lives here and my family <br/>
had our own little get together.<br/>
It was a lot of fun!<br/>
I would love to meet more of the FL unschoolers though, there are really <br/>
quite a few of us spread out.<br/>
It will depend on work mainly.....money shouldn&#39;t be much of a problem if we <br/>
camp.<br/>
<br/>
Meghan, I&#39;ll send you the link for the homeschool registry after I get off of <br/>
this board.<br/>
There are about 7 families listed for my town, you never know who you&#39;ll find <br/>
there. And it conveniently asks you to list your homeschool &quot;style&quot; so it&#39;s <br/>
easy to find unschoolers if there are any in your area.<br/>
There is a thread at unschooling.com for each state also...did you check that?<br/>
