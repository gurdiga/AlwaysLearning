<br/>
Hypothesis by Bruce Charlton, an evolutionary psychiatrist.  I excerpted<br/>
some of summary, and my comment is in brackets like these []:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Thirdly, I put forward the hypothesis that the major cause of PN<br/>
 </span></blockquote>[psychological neoteny, which means delayed maturity or something like that]<br/>
in modernizing societies is the prolonged duration of formal education. Here<br/>
I present a preliminary empirical investigation of this hypothesis of<br/>
psychological neoteny. Marriage and parenthood are indicative of making a<br/>
choice to �settle down� and thereby move on from the more flexible lifestyle<br/>
of youth; and furthermore these are usually commitments which themselves<br/>
induce a settling down and maturation of attitudes and behaviors. A<br/>
sevenfold expansion of participation in UK higher education up to 2001 was<br/>
reflected in delay in marriage and parenthood. Increasing number of years of<br/>
education is quantitatively the most important predictor of increasing age<br/>
of the mother at the time of her first birth: among women college graduates<br/>
about half are aged 30 or older at the time of their first birth � a rise of<br/>
400% in 25 years. Parenthood is associated with a broad range of<br/>
psychologically �maturing� and socially-integrating effects in both men and<br/>
women. However, the economic effect is different in men and women: after<br/>
parenthood men are more likely to have a job and work more hours while women<br/>
change in the opposite direction. The conclusion is that psychological<br/>
neoteny is indeed increasing, and mainly as a consequence of the increasing<br/>
percentage of school leavers going into higher education. But at present it<br/>
is unclear whether this trend is overall beneficial or harmful; and the<br/>
answer may be different for men and women. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

It looks like I need a subscription or student/faculty status to see the<br/>
whole thing.  For those who do have access, here&#39;s the link:<br/>
