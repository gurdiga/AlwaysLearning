<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657882940">I have a question.  Does anyone force or enforce older<br/>
siblings (or cousins) having to play with and include<br/>
younger kids in whatever they want to be included in? <br/>
Does anyone have any thoughts on the possible<br/>
repercussions of this?<br/>
<br/>
My sister-in-law and brother seem to think it&#39;s a<br/>
wonderful thing that they &quot;make all (their) kids play<br/>
together.&quot;  What that really means is that if the<br/>
younger children, their four year old boy Aidan in<br/>
particular because he&#39;s the most demanding of their<br/>
two younger children, want to get into a game or<br/>
activity of the older kids, he MUST be accomodated or<br/>
the older children will be punished.  If he wants to<br/>
be left alone with what he&#39;s doing however, they must<br/>
accomodate that as well.<br/>
<br/>
My older son Thomas (8) has trouble with this boy, not<br/>
because he dislikes him, because he actually likes him<br/>
a lot.  Aidan&#39;s actually a very clever and sweet child<br/>
with much of the same interests as Thomas.  The first<br/>
thing Thomas did when we arrived was to run and show<br/>
Aidan his bionicle toys.  Thomas has trouble because<br/>
he is not flexible enough to immediately wrap his mind<br/>
around adjusting the game/play to include this rather<br/>
demading and sensative four year old, who is also a<br/>
LOT like Thomas himself (not a comparison I can make<br/>
in front of Aidan&#39;s parents.)  <br/>
<br/>
Thomas also has trouble because Aidan wants to lead<br/>
the play and must be dealt with in a gentle and<br/>
politic way to avoid tantrums.  Aidan also, like most<br/>
toddlers, wants whatever you have and to be wherever<br/>
you are, just because you have it and are there. <br/>
Thomas is not known for his subtlety or patience and<br/>
has trouble communicating what he means in a socially<br/>
acceptable way and a way that will appease this little<br/>
cousin.  They misunderstand each other and lose<br/>
patience with each other a lot.<br/>
<br/>
The invariable result of all this is that my<br/>
sister-in-law calls her girls over and tells them they<br/>
cannot play with Thomas if he will not include Aidan. <br/>
Thomas would actually be happy to include Aidan (and<br/>
has numerous times) if he had time and assistance to<br/>
mediate incorporating him into a game.  Aidan throws a<br/>
tantrum at any sign of resistance or wrong word or<br/>
action from Thomas and then Aidan&#39;s parents step in<br/>
with ultimatums or just shortcut to scolding my son. <br/>
When I have a chance to step in instead I can mediate<br/>
them successfully into a mutually acceptable play<br/>
situation.  Thomas also plays with Aidan on his own<br/>
numerous times but Aidan&#39;s parents seem never to have<br/>
noticed.  They have villified Thomas into a bad and<br/>
mean older child deliberately excluding Aidan, which<br/>
he is not.  It&#39;s more like two similar children of a<br/>
similar emotional age having trouble communicating<br/>
with each other.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering both how others might have dealt with a<br/>
similar situation and what some thoughts are on this<br/>
&quot;enforced sibling harmony.&quot;  My feelings are that it<br/>
causes resentment and ill feelings between siblings<br/>
eventually, and is contributing more to Aidan&#39;s being<br/>
hair trigger sensative about exclusion.  I commented<br/>
at one point in the course of the weekend about how<br/>
well their 2 year old boy was playing with another two<br/>
year old boy in the campground, as most kids that age<br/>
simply play near each other not WITH each other, but<br/>
there was a lot of intereaction going on between them.<br/>
 I was thinking this has everything to do with my baby<br/>
nephew&#39;s personality, but my sister-in-law responded<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s because I MAKE all my children play together.&quot;<br/>

them that&#39;s not ok, and this is his house, not theirs,<br/>
and they can include him or go home.  That being said,<br/>
I would also be there in the mix, trying to mediate,<br/>
and trying to find something more fun for the 7 yo if<br/>
that is what he preferred...<br/>

is choosing not to actually communicate with everyone involved about<br/>
how they are feeling and what they want and possible solutions.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, that means talking with the children and listening to their<br/>
feelings every time it comes up -- it seems easier on the surface to<br/>
just lay down a rule and punish the older kids, who understand<br/>
punishment better (though, sadly, not communication).<br/>
<br/>
What actually happens -- when the parent puts in the effort to talk it<br/>
through and mediate each time -- what actually happens is that the<br/>
kids get better at coming up with mutually beneficial solutions<br/>
themselves.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m actually watching this happen right now with our neighborhood kids<br/>
and our new trampoline.  I am out there nearly constantly, helping my<br/>
children, who are younger than the others -- my older son can hit<br/>
sensory overload rather quickly, and then he gets inflexible.  So I<br/>
make sure that I help them speak up for what they need and want, as<br/>
well as making sure things are safe, and listening to the ideas that<br/>
all the kids have for working things out.  We&#39;re on week 3, and the<br/>
ideas are getting better and better -- sometimes more inclusive,<br/>
sometimes recognizing that a particular mix of children isn&#39;t working<br/>
very well.  The ideas are getting more respectful, more creative, more<br/>
willing to give a bit because each child knows that if we can find a<br/>
way, we are more than happy to let them use the trampoline as much as<br/>
they want, in the way they want to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned a ton about good communication, and my sons are learning<br/>
a ton about their own bodies and gravity and fun trampoline games with<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then are you able to provide that mediation, for Thomas&#39; sake?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really not fair for Thomas&#39; choices to be a) excluded from play<br/>
altogether or b) forced to always play a social role past his own<br/>
ability.  And to be shamed no matter what.  I know you know this, from<br/>
the tone of your email.  So what can you do to make sure he is not put<br/>
into that situation again?  <br/>
<br/>
If you feel you must (or want to) keep seeing this family, and you<br/>
can&#39;t constantly interpret for Thomas, can your visits at least be in<br/>
a situation where you and Thomas can leave when he needs to, so he can<br/>
regroup and reconnect again?<br/>
<br/>
Can you have a good NVC talk with your SIL, recognizing that she<br/>
doesn&#39;t want her son to be left out, but letting her know that Thomas&#39;<br/>
limits are real (we all have limits) and they need to be respected?<br/>
<br/>
If that doesn&#39;t work, can you keep visits with this family short for a<br/>
few years?  In time, all these kids will mature, including Thomas, and<br/>
the situation will be easier.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking for myself, I would not put my son in a situation where he<br/>
was asked to do more than he could and then made to feel shame when he<br/>
couldn&#39;t.  That would be damaging to him, and my job is to give him<br/>
the space and the support to be who he is, whether or not &quot;who he is&quot;<br/>
 is what others think he should be.<br/>

At our house, Andrew came home from work with two big play sets for<br/>
Cassidy (4) and Adam (2).  One was a little battery powered train and the<br/>
other an old west village, both with people and accessories.  They were<br/>
all working together to open them  (what a darn chore these dayssomeone<br/>
should introduce a bill in congress limiting toy packaging, but thats<br/>
another story) and set them up.  There ensued the requisite, Hey!  Thats<br/>
mine!  I want it!  No! Give it here!  etcand I was ready to step in to<br/>
help with negotiating the situation.  Andrew embraces win-win situations<br/>
in theory, but in practice is likely to fall back on the old if you cant<br/>
share, nobody gets to play song and dance.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to hear this instead.  Okay guysall this disagreement is<br/>
making me feel fussy.  Cassidywhat do you need?  Okay, here is a girl and a<br/>
dog.  Adam, if you need a dog, Ill get you one from little peoplehe can<br/>
fit on the train too.  We can work this out so we can all play and nobody<br/>
cries.  Ready?  Okay, all aboard the train.<br/>
<br/>
Need I say more?<br/>

<br/>
As with most things, this would &quot;depend&quot; at our house.  Most of the time the <br/>
kids do play well together and in fact someone was just commenting on it <br/>
last night.  Occassionally, one of the kids is excluded and crying.  I think <br/>
of it as a symptom rather than the actual problem.<br/>
<br/>
The actual problem is usually either one of the kids is trying to be too <br/>
bossy to the other kids and they get tired of it and &quot;kick them out&quot; or one <br/>
of the kids gets a bit of a mean streak and is being cliquish.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is &quot;kicked out&quot; we talk about the behavior that caused it, how <br/>
could it be handled differently, how to approach the other kids to apologise <br/>
and see if you can get back in the game.<br/>
<br/>
If it is being &quot;cliquish&quot;, I talk with the excluder about how they have felt <br/>
when people have excluded them, etc..<br/>
<br/>
However, having 5 kids in the house, sometimes you just want to do what you <br/>
want to do without having to accommodate other people.....we try to respect <br/>
that too.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I have a question.  Does anyone force or enforce older<br/>
&gt; siblings (or cousins) having to play with and include<br/>
&gt; younger kids in whatever they want to be included in?<br/>
&gt; Does anyone have any thoughts on the possible<br/>
&gt; repercussions of this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Holly loves spinach.<br/>
She has never once ever been made to eat or even taste spinach.<br/>
If she had, I doubt she would want anything to do with it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve appealed to my kids to let siblings play. <br/>
I&#39;ve asked when there were guests for them to find something the youngest <br/>
guests can do, or find something they can do that includes all the guests, and <br/>
they&#39;ve been really willing to to do that, because they remember what it feels <br/>
like to be left out.    <br/>
<br/>
Just lately, Marty&#39;s hanging-out group has started including Holly in their <br/>
outings.   I didn&#39;t &quot;make them,&quot; and didn&#39;t ask them to.   She got old enough <br/>
that they wanted her there.   The other night they were all getting together <br/>
and one of the boys (a homeschooled 16 year old) needed to go and get his older <br/>
sister from their house in another town.   He offered to take Holly with him.  <br/>
 Then when they had her they were going to meet up with Marty and three <br/>
others at an all night restaurant.      I let her go.   The next morning Holly said <br/>
it had been really nice that he had taken her because they were having fun, <br/>
not just because he didn&#39;t want to dump her.   (He was at the house and Kirby <br/>
left, then Marty left, and he was still involved in doing something with <br/>
Holly.)<br/>
<br/>
But if we ever &quot;made&quot; people include the younger, that couldn&#39;t have <br/>
happened.   Holly couldn&#39;t have known that she had been included out of the others&#39; <br/>
free choice if they didn&#39;t really   have free choice.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also always been willing to distract and extricate a younger child who&#39;s <br/>
being irritating to the older ones so that the person to &quot;blame&quot; for removing <br/>
him/her from a situation that was going bad was me, and not the older kids.   <br/>
That   makes a big difference too.   If I thought Holly was starting to get <br/>
on other kids nerves and they were going to be forced to try to run her off, <br/>
I&#39;d offer to take her to the store with me, or call her in another room to show <br/>
her something, and if that didn&#39;t distract her sufficiently, I would say to <br/>
her (in private) I thought she should leave Kirby/Marty alone a while.   <br/>
Sometimes she chose to go and try again, but I&#39;d tell her that she needed to be <br/>
sensitive enough to take a hint, if they seemed not to want her, and not press <br/>
until they said something mean.<br/>

&gt;solutions.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Precisely.  I think they are both unable and choosing not to, <br/>
depending on the particular instance.  They do also have an active <br/>
two year old boy to chase after.  I couldn&#39;t help physically <br/>
cringing as I listened to my brother, last weekend, forcing his 8 <br/>
year old into bed in her tent with her sister.  She said &quot;But I <br/>
don&#39;t want to go to bed yet..etc&quot; crying.  He responds angrily &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t CARE what you want, I told you to...&quot; bla bla<br/>
<br/>
Listening to children takes time, and effort, and patience, and <br/>
respect for them as equal human beings not your property.  It&#39;s not <br/>
as easy on the surface as ordering them about.  I think therin lies <br/>
the root of this problem.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; Thomas would actually be happy to include Aidan (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; has numerous times) if he had time and assistance to<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then are you able to provide that mediation, for Thomas&#39; sake?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I try to, but I can&#39;t be everywhere and Thomas literally runs all <br/>
over.  I try to keep myself nearby, which is how I often witness <br/>
this stuff, but they are so quick to start scolding, issuing <br/>
ultimatums, etc.  I can still try to mediate after the ultimatums <br/>
are issued, sort of ignoring them or pretending they are not there, <br/>
but the kids all still heard them.  I don&#39;t allow them to verbally <br/>
abuse my son, so they issue their ultimatums to their own <br/>
girls, &quot;You can&#39;t play with Thomas for a while (or) until..&quot;  making <br/>
him the bad guy.  <br/>
<br/>
Mainly I try to help mediate, but I have to be fast, verbally and <br/>
physically.  Even then the other adults (my own father and Aidan&#39;s <br/>
mother being the worst culprits) will sometimes not allow the time <br/>
for that to happen (by talking over me to say &quot;No, we&#39;re not <br/>
compromising, Aidan gets to play too, or play with what you have or <br/>
where you are..&quot;) and my efforts go by the wayside.  Other times <br/>
they just mutter amongst themselves about the latest precieved mini-<br/>
atrocity they think Thomas is guilty of.<br/>
<br/>
Often the best strategy is for me to play with Aidan and give him <br/>
something to do until the other kids have worked out a solution, <br/>
whisking him away from the scene and offering him various options <br/>
and calming him down.  He really is a sweet kid, I just think they <br/>
are teaching him that throwing tantrums at the least provocation is <br/>
a good way to deal with things.  If he is really determined to play <br/>
with the other kids (often he&#39;s happier to do something with me) <br/>
then we will return when all are calm and I facilitate that.  I <br/>
can&#39;t control what the other adults do during this time however.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s really not fair for Thomas&#39; choices to be a) excluded from <br/>
&gt;play altogether or b) forced to always play a social role past his <br/>
&gt;own ability.  And to be shamed no matter what.  I know you know <br/>
&gt;this, from the tone of your email.  So what can you do to make sure <br/>
&gt;he is not put into that situation again?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, I completely agree.  I don&#39;t know the solution.  This is my <br/>
dilema.  They seem not to absorb the information I tell them about <br/>
Thomas, the discussions we have about his limitations or <br/>
difficulties.  They are dismissive of my attempts to explain what I <br/>
see happening between him and Aidan and why I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as <br/>
they see it.  They believe I am merely being defensive of Thomas, <br/>
even though they know that he&#39;s autistic and has other &quot;special <br/>
needs&quot;, and even though my sister-in-law has a high functioning <br/>
autistic younger brother.  They know it, but they don&#39;t act like the <br/>
know it, if you know what I mean.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to start a war with my brother and his wife and have <br/>
them punish me by not allowing their kids to see us.  Thomas adores <br/>
his cousins and I can&#39;t decide for him that we won&#39;t see them, as he <br/>
would be desperately sad.  I try to get them to send at least their <br/>
older two out for visits (we live 5-6 hours away) but so far have <br/>
been unsuccessful.  School rules their lives and they won&#39;t allow <br/>
them to miss even part of a day for a visit and they make excuses in <br/>
the summer.  This camping trip happens once a year and we see them a <br/>
couple other times, maybe, during the year.  We saw the girls <br/>
earlier this spring on a two day visit with their grandparents <br/>
(their parents were not with them) for Alex, my 7 year old&#39;s <br/>
birthday.  There were no problem&#39;s at all, except tears when they <br/>
said goodbye.<br/>
<br/>
My brother is bringing all four of his kids out to our area for a 4 <br/>
day camping trip in early September and we will be going with them <br/>
and are very hopeful that without his wife and our father around we <br/>
can make some kind of inroads into understanding between us.  I feel <br/>
that the main problem is not between the kids, but with the other <br/>
adults poor reactions to the situation with the kids.  With a better <br/>
adult reaction it would turn into a non or at least very small <br/>
issue, and Aidan and Thomas, I believe, would find their way to <br/>
communication and understanding between them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you feel you must (or want to) keep seeing this family, and you<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t constantly interpret for Thomas, can your visits at least be <br/>
&gt;in a situation where you and Thomas can leave when he needs to, so <br/>
&gt;he can regroup and reconnect again?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We had out tent placed at a distance from the group camp of 15 <br/>
people specifically for this reason.  The problem is that Thomas <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to leave and regroup, can&#39;t read his own needs and <br/>
feelings well, is excited and worked up playing with his other <br/>
cousins, and we end up having to make him do it as gently as <br/>
possible (some of the necessary structure with him I discussed.)  It <br/>
still helps to be at a distance like that, but difficult to convince <br/>
him to utilize that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Can you have a good NVC talk with your SIL, recognizing that she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t want her son to be left out, but letting her know that <br/>
&gt;Thomas&#39; limits are real (we all have limits) and they need to be <br/>
&gt;respected?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our discussions thus far have not been formal, but maybe that is <br/>
what needs to happen in order to help this situation and get them to <br/>
take what I say seriously.  It&#39;s definately an idea worth <br/>
contemplating.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If that doesn&#39;t work, can you keep visits with this family short <br/>
&gt;for a few years?  In time, all these kids will mature, including <br/>
&gt;Thomas, and the situation will be easier.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Two to four day visits about three times a year seems pretty short <br/>
to me.  If you mean several hour visits instead, that doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
possible, given that it takes 5-6 hours just to travel between our <br/>
homes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Speaking for myself, I would not put my son in a situation where he<br/>
&gt; was asked to do more than he could and then made to feel shame <br/>
&gt;when he couldn&#39;t.  <br/>
&gt; Amy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We agonize for months every year over whether we should go on this <br/>
4th of July trip or not.  So far the benefits have outweighed the <br/>
detractors but not a huge amount.  Overall the kids remember playing <br/>
with their cousins and all the fun stuff.  They unequivocally vote <br/>
to go every year (as in &quot;Of COURSE Mom!  We HAVE to go!&quot;)  I want <br/>
them to have this opportunity and the good memories.  The girls (my <br/>
8 and 10 year old neices) both told me several times that it was <br/>
their favorite time all year.  It&#39;s us adults who seem to suffer <br/>
more and are hesitant about going.  Our 19 year old (my neice whom I <br/>
raised as a young child and who&#39;s lived with us for several years <br/>
now) chose not to go this year even though she really wanted to see <br/>
the little ones, specifically to avoid the other adults besides us. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to answer in such depth.  I appreciate <br/>
your input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383340433">I just remembered something from last weekend.  We always have a <br/>
birthday party during this campout for the oldest (their 10 year old) <br/>
and she is shy and didn&#39;t want to read her cards aloud to a big group <br/>
as her mother was ordering her.  Particularly the longer cards, which <br/>
is like making a speech with no preparation.  Her mother said &quot;You <br/>
better read that card.  I was always made to read all my cards out <br/>
loud when I was growing up, so you have to as well.&quot;  I SO wanted to <br/>
comment on the absurdity of that remark.  My neice turned her head <br/>
away, rolled here eyes and picked up her next gift, thanking the giver <br/>
and moving the party onward.  My mother picked up the card and read it <br/>
aloud for her.  Her mother got left behind in her protestations and <br/>
she ran out of steam since no one was backing her.  I wanted to CHEER! <br/>
for my neice.  Poor kid.  She&#39;s got quiet spunk.<br/>

have the cousins in our wedding.  Dh didn&#39;t want to, but we gave in.  <br/>
FIL said that &quot;blood was thicker than water.&quot;  I can&#39;t agree.  We <br/>
can&#39;t get in touch with those cousins.  We call and call (and <br/>
finally, have stopped) and they never return our calls.  We talk to <br/>
our friends more often and have seen those people when we go home for <br/>
visits.<br/>
<br/>
Our close friends stayed up way into the night to help us move when <br/>
my in-laws and cousins, once again weren&#39;t around or they were too <br/>
busy.  Our friends babysit our dog when we have to leave and our <br/>
family won&#39;t.  Sorry to go on, but this is a sore spot with me right <br/>
now.  My dh&#39;s grandmother is expected to die any moment; my children <br/>
want to try to get there to see her one more time, but my FIL said <br/>
that we can&#39;t come to their house.  SIL &quot;can&#39;t have us&quot; (it would <br/>
only be three) and we don&#39;t have the money for a hotel until the time <br/>
of the funeral (it could be days).  My kids are crushed.<br/>
<br/>
I do have a point in all this ranting.  If I remember correctly, the <br/>
initial poster said that her children saw the cousins only once or <br/>
twice a year and they really didn&#39;t want to miss this time.  It seems <br/>
like you might could find some really good friends to spend this time <br/>
with and that would also make wonderful memories for your kids.  <br/>
Especially if you talk to the adults involved and they can&#39;t behave <br/>

<br/>
Alice Miller has written a treatise I guess it would be called, about<br/>
Hitler&#39;s childhood traumas and resultant psychological disfunctions. Much of<br/>
her writing including some of that is collected at the surprisingly titled<br/>
www.thisisawar.com (the war being against childhood violence and abuse in<br/>
general), if that interests you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
How very sad for you all. Would it be possible ($ wise) for you to visit for<br/>
over night just to say goodbye, then return at a later time to visit her<br/>
grave when expenses allow? We visited my mother prior to her imminent death,<br/>
then chose not to return for the cremation service. We created our own<br/>
private memorial ritual scattering her ashes with Jayn. Maybe you could<br/>
create your own at the gravesite (assuming burial) bypassing the uncongenial<br/>
relatives completely.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Jayn can hardly wait for the Conference where she expects to see several<br/>
children that she made friends with last year. Sometimes once or twice a<br/>
year can be great if it really creates special memories. Of course these<br/>
kids are accompanied by wonderful adults! <br/>

LOOOONG months... ugh (which we are thankfully now out of), I found this to be <br/>
100% true.  You can&#39;t control what others do and this can harmfully impact your child.    <br/>
Ds is much calmer with just me.  I would luv for him to have some kids to play with <br/>
where because of other children and adults the above scenarios didn&#39;t happen.  Over <br/>
the past 3 months, ds displayed a lot of what was perceived as &quot;whining&quot; and this was <br/>
inadvertently encouraged by rote patterns in the behaviors of the people around us.  <br/>
Since ds served as the locus for acted out behavior, the &quot;whining,&quot; he was seen as a <br/>
problem as opposed to being recognized as a child out of his depth and sinking as it <br/>
were under pressures he didn&#39;t know how to deal with.  I was playing rescue some of <br/>
the time, and other times was branded as neglectful or expecting too much of the <br/>
older kids who were admittedly too burly and rough for ds.  Anyway, we are not there <br/>
now.  Ds is healing nicely from these ordeals and so am I.  It is amazingly relaxing <br/>
around here.  I am at a friend&#39;s house for a couple of weeks before we go back home.<br/>
