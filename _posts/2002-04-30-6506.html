Ever.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I pulled that from another topic<br/>
That I started with a blogpost<br/>
I pulled that from an e-mail<br/>
and the green grass grows all around all around...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I  have been to dozens of concerts.  The best was Crosby, Stills and  <br/>
Nash.  The second best was another Crosby, Stills and Nash.  The  <br/>
third best was Weird Al Yankovic.   His band is phenomenal.  The  <br/>
concerts are multi-media shows.    I&#39;ve seen him twice.  Kirby and  <br/>
Marty have seen him three times.  He&#39;s a total contortionist/athlete  <br/>
and has the best enunciation of any singer EVER, which means you can  <br/>
actually hear humorous changes made to the lyrics, and there are  <br/>
costume changes and light show bits and if you get a chance to see  <br/>
him, you should.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891332509">My kids have discovered Weird Al this last year and love all his  <br/>
songs.  The Star Wars ones are a favorite.  I realized that I must be  <br/>
getting ahem, older when i don&#39;t recognize the songs that he is  <br/>
making a parody of!  That was the case of &quot;white and nerdy&quot;.  I had  <br/>
to seek help from a younger, more musically current person to  <br/>
enlighten me.<br/>
<br/>
The other day we had pulled up to an ice-cream shop in upstate NY  <br/>
that we hadn&#39;t been to in years and I was thinking that it was a long  <br/>
time ago that we had been here, so I burst out in song and sang, &quot;A  <br/>
long, long time ago....&quot; (thinking of the American Pie version) and  <br/>
to my surprise, my kids all responded, in unison &quot;In a galaxy far  <br/>
away...&quot; (thinking of the Weird Al version).  It was so priceless and  <br/>
funny that we laughed for a very long time and still do - like right  <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
I will have to look up his concert dates.  I think that would rank  <br/>
right up there with heaven right now for my kids!<br/>

This is a video of Danny Osmond and Weird Al dancing to the ENTIRE<br/>
song in front of a green screen.  Much more than the snippets that are<br/>
shown in the video.  I always thought it was a blue screen, not green.<br/>
 Donny Osmond is a very good sport, in my opinion.<br/>

The third best was Weird Al Yankovic. His band is phenomenal. The<br/>
concerts are multi-media shows. I&#39;ve seen him twice. Kirby and<br/>
Marty have seen him three times. He&#39;s a total contortionist/athlete<br/>
and has the best enunciation of any singer EVER, which means you can<br/>
actually hear humorous changes made to the lyrics, and there are<br/>
costume changes and light show bits and if you get a chance to see<br/>
him, you should.<br/>

ITA! It has been a little over 8 years since we have been to a Weird Al<br/>
concert. DH has been to several (before we were together). It was a bit loud<br/>
for me because my ears were VERY sensitive when I was pregnant and I was 7<br/>
1/2 months along at the time, but other than that, it was phenomenal.<br/>
<br/>
Now I want to look it up to see if we can take the girls soon :)<br/>

I just spent some time reading about that video (the original Dylan one),<br/>
and it turns out that the two men in the background are Allen Ginsberg and Bob<br/>
Neuwirth.  Ginsberg I know, but Bob Neuwirth was new to me, so I looked him<br/>
up, and he was also an artist and poet, but his most interesting thing to me<br/>
is that he was apparently Kris Kristofferson&#39;s inspiration for Bobby McGee!<br/>

I just saw the Bob video today and I really liked it.  It was hard to<br/>
believe all of those were palindromes.  Very cool.<br/>
<br/>
I *almost* bought tickets for the exact same concert and got DH<br/>
willing to take a day off work to go to the fair and the concert by<br/>
roping in my brother to come with us (better adult to child ratio) but<br/>
it is at 8pm and my 2 year old typically goes to sleep at around that<br/>
time.<br/>

I didn&#39;t know that.  I love the trivial-seeming history that&#39;s coming  <br/>
up on the internet, and on the extras of DVDs, because they&#39;re like  <br/>
the really cool footnotes and endnotes some books have, only you just  <br/>
click them and they move and talk (either literally or figuratively).<br/>
<br/>
Of Weird Al, though... sometimes one of the phrases from &quot;Bob&quot; will  <br/>
just come into my head and stay a while.  When Holly had pet rats,  <br/>
she had made a little paper banner to go above their cate that said  <br/>
Rats Live on No Evil Star.   Weird Al didn&#39;t make all those up  <br/>
(though he might&#39;ve some, I don&#39;t know), but he certainly did put  <br/>
them together well!  It&#39;s like those guys who do drywall masonry,  <br/>
only he does it with words.  Hardware Store.  And one of my favorites  <br/>
philosophically speaking is Everything You Know is Wrong.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
think there&#39;s ever been a video, which is good.  I don&#39;t think he  <br/>
performs it either, because I suspect it to be a studio trick.    <br/>
Maybe not, but it seems he never breaths.  Maybe he did every other  <br/>
line on two tracks.  It&#39;s a mystery.  I don&#39;t mind mysteries.<br/>

More connections:<br/>
<br/>
My dad was stationed as an M.D. in Germany back in 1962/3. He used to <br/>
hang around listening to a &quot;smart, young helicopter pilot&quot; play his <br/>
guitar.<br/>
<br/>
After he got out of the army, Daddy saw that Kris had cut a record and <br/>
went out and bought one to &quot;help the poor fella&#39; out.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They kept in touch for years until Kris &quot;made it big&quot; with A Star is <br/>
Born. I owned all of his albums as a teen. &lt;g&gt; Have a few CDs now. Big <br/>
fan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-712536235">My dad was a big fan.  He said he never cared for Kris&#39; singing voice, but he loved his songs.<br/>
<br/>
I also worked with a woman who, as a child, was an extra in Heaven&#39;s Gate (1980).<br/>
<br/>
I recognize him better as an actor than a singer.  I usually try to see movies he is in...he&#39;s sort of like Sam Elliott.  The movie might not be great, but he has interesting presence.<br/>

I was up late one night channel surfing when I saw a preview of the <br/>
next movie coming up. Billy the Kid. Starred Kris, James Coburn&#39;s <br/>
daddy, James Coburn, and Bob Dylan----to bring it all the way back to <br/>
the Weird Al/Bob Dylan link. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Not a great movie either, and they were all SOOO young! &lt;g&gt; And if you <br/>
squint, you&#39;d think you&#39;re listening to/watching *our* James. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I stayed up waaay too late that night. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
