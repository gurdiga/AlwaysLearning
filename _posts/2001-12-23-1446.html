<div id="ygrps-yiv-1820124133">I was wondering if some of you more experienced parents might share a little <br/>
with me about the nature of 12/13 year olds. Boys specifically. (For now.) <br/>
Conor is in the midst of all the hormonal/moody/sensitive/pulling away from <br/>
us stuff. I feel like I need more input from other families as to what to <br/>
expect in the upcoming years. It&#39;s sometimes hard for me to recognize what <br/>
is normal pre-teen angst and what might be depression rearing its&#39; ugly head <br/>
again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818864005">Oh Mary......deprssion,bummer.  <br/>
<br/>
I have 4 sons.  Ages 29, 26, 21, and 8.  Of the oldest<br/>
three, the oldest married at 21, the second has a<br/>
live-in girlfriend, of 4 years (think 4) and the 21<br/>
year old&#39;s girlfried moved in with him last week.  The<br/>
oldest is my most angst-driven. He is the<br/>
&quot;super-genious&quot; Scorpio with off and on overwhelming<br/>
futility-itis. Still, he&#39;s doing OK, anyway. Having<br/>
others to care for (his wife, a horse, dogs, cats,<br/>
various other animals) and music, and (the Toa would<br/>
come closest to describing it) a spiritual self helps<br/>
him get through.<br/>
<br/>
With all of the boys, 13 was the most obnoxious age. <br/>
But it did get done.  14 was a WONDERFUL age. Like 4<br/>
and 9....The younger self is still visible, but you<br/>
can actualy see what is comming next.  13 is just so<br/>
sullen and unformed.  Sarcasim seems to be the only<br/>
humor (blah...it is so painful).  But even this shall<br/>
pass. Hang in there.  The person in danger of<br/>
depression is Mama. Any non-stop pain can use up<br/>
seratonin and there you are. And 13 can sure be a<br/>
non-stop unrelenting pain.  Using whatever he can<br/>
(usually Mam&#39;s feelings) to push against to break free<br/>
from childhood...only, in reality, he can&#39;t....it is<br/>
there, inside, forever.  But kids feel like they have<br/>
to, so there is this unbearable need to push away from<br/>
the very supports that are essential.  Makes for a<br/>
wobbly structure. For a while. But if you can hang on,<br/>
it does pass. Just remember, he is your baby.  You do<br/>
love him. (You know, a face only a Mama could love) If<br/>
he has plenty to do, then even he might not notice, so<br/>
much.  Music helped us.  Still does.<br/>

<br/>
I had sweet two-year-olds and obstructionist three and fours, from time to <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was rough at 12, but he was crowded at the old house and we moved.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s sweet at 12; he&#39;ll be thirteen in three weeks (January 14).   He told <br/>
me today that he&#39;s bigger than Kirby.  That Kirby hadn&#39;t believed it but they <br/>
stood up next to one another and Marty&#39;s taller.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s been verbal and rational about his blossoming adolescence.  He said, <br/>
&quot;Mom, it&#39;s just sometimes we really want to get away from you.&quot;  He said it <br/>
sweetly and calmly.  And he will apologize if he&#39;s short with someone.  <br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s still quick to anger, at 15, although I see the man in him from time <br/>
to time now.  He was mean to Marty the other night about being in his room <br/>
watching TV when he could&#39;ve watched it elsewhere.  Kirby had been gone an<br/>
yway, but the minute he got home he wanted the house rearranged for his <br/>
convenience.<br/>
<br/>
I understand that urge, personally.<br/>
<br/>
But I shamed him some, and then went and made Kirby&#39;s arguments to Marty, and <br/>
in the absence of a direct confrontation, each could admit the other had good <br/>
points.   And it got two &quot;thank yous&quot; out of Kirby in the next hour or two.<br/>
<br/>
I think sloughing off as much of their tackiness as possible is good.  <br/>
Breathe, leave, come back and say ONE thing maybe, and not a cutting <br/>
life-wounding thing if you can restrain yourself.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re usually patient with my menopausal grumpy older-mom self, and I <br/>
should have the awareness and understanding to remember my own adolescence <br/>
and not crush them just because I have the urge and the ability.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents (not this group, but thoughtless relatives of mine come to mind) <br/>
think being the adult means having the power, having the rights, keeping <br/>
control.  I think it&#39;s having the awareness and the responsibility and the <br/>
patience and the maturity.  In any meeting/conversation/conflict between me <br/>
and a young teen, it&#39;s not a 50/50 situation.  I have more experience and <br/>
verbal power and authority, and I need to handicap myself in the discussion <br/>
to give the kid a fair shot at making his point.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just rambling, but maybe a phrase or two will help someone still worried.<br/>

the boys are coming from. I think, too, that since we have the experience, we <br/>
should &quot;give&quot; a little. <br/>
<br/>
So many people change, the minute they become parents, into authority figures <br/>
that demand kids&#39; submission (all kids, not just their own---and some don&#39;t <br/>
even need to be parents, but I&#39;ve found it more in my parenting friends than <br/>
in the childless ones).  It&#39;s like they forget what it was like to be 4 or 9 <br/>
or 15. I ask my husband all the time, &quot;Don&#39;t you remember what it was like to <br/>
be ...?&quot; He honestly doesn&#39;t remember. Now he often asks me what 5 or 13 was <br/>
like, just in case. I realize most people can&#39;t remember what it was like to <br/>
be 2, but you can certainly imagine how tough it can be with limited verbal <br/>
and physical skills---it&#39;s GOT to be hard!<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the handicapping--at a minimum to see the child/teen&#39;s point of <br/>
view.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was my experience, too. Based on that, I guess I&#39;ll just prepare for 13 <br/>
to be a little harder than 12 has been (which, other than the depression, <br/>
hasn&#39;t been bad).<br/>
<br/>
Do you all believe that mindful parenting, really talking and being with our <br/>
kids makes a difference during this time. Or do those hormose just take <br/>
over? I keep thinking that the whole unschooling lifestyle should make it <br/>
all a bit different from the &quot;normal&quot; families&#39; teen experience. After all, <br/>
I&#39;ll actually listen to him, he&#39;ll have many more choices, time to be alone, <br/>
etc.<br/>

I used to ask other teachers sometimes when I was surprised at their being <br/>
mean (teasing kind of stuff).   One math teacher--stereotypical veteran, <br/>
redneck, humorless math teacher--making fun of a girl for having a boyfriend, <br/>
and I saw the hurt and embarrassment on her face.  I went after and said <br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t you remember what it was like to be fourteen?&quot;  He paused a minute, <br/>
really thinking, and said, &quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eeeek!  And teaching 9th grade...<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s best and clearest childhood memories seem to involve being away <br/>
from his house.  He never remembers what gifts he got for Christmas or <br/>
birthdays.  I feel sorry for him some, but on the other hand, remembering <br/>
comes with sorrow sometimes too, and he has very little sorrow in him.<br/>

I think the memories and relationship have to make a difference.  If I had <br/>
been cruel to Kirby, and really limited his movements and tried to limit his <br/>
thoughts, then when the hormones were upon him, looking through those <br/>
surge-colored glasses I would look monstrous, rather than just kind of old <br/>
and irritating.<br/>
<br/>
And some kids get it worse than others, just like some women cruise through <br/>
PMS and pregnancy and menopause with not much more than light cramps and the <br/>
awareness of bloating and some rival the banshees.<br/>

&gt;and a young teen, it&#39;s not a 50/50 situation.  I have more experience and<br/>
&gt;verbal power and authority, and I need to handicap myself in the discussion<br/>
&gt;to give the kid a fair shot at making his point.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m just rambling, but maybe a phrase or two will help someone still worried.<br/>
<br/>

me in our interactions, even if the worst *is* (I hope) over.<br/>

&gt;Do you all believe that mindful parenting, really talking and being with our<br/>

&gt;over? I keep thinking that the whole unschooling lifestyle should make it<br/>
&gt;all a bit different from the &quot;normal&quot; families&#39; teen experience. After all,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ll actually listen to him, he&#39;ll have many more choices, time to be alone,<br/>
&gt;etc.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s what I thought, so it hit me by surprise.  Our other kids did most <br/>
of their teen years with the other parent.  This is the first one we&#39;ve had <br/>
all the way through.<br/>
<br/>
One difference between Lars and other unschooled teens is that his friends <br/>
all go to school.  He just hasn&#39;t ever hit it off with the unschooled teens <br/>
in town, and there aren&#39;t any where we live.  (I just found out that one of <br/>
his biking buddies is doing correspondance, though, so he isn&#39;t in school <br/>
but isn&#39;t unschooled.)  I don&#39;t know how much his schooled friends have <br/>
influenced his attitude toward us.  It probably isn&#39;t that much, and he <br/>
really is a good kid most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
Also, like Sandra, we&#39;re doing the puberty and menopause thing at the same <br/>
time.  You couple that with my self-esteem issues and the sparks do fly.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think one of the biggies is the time to SLEEP. I think that most of <br/>
Cameron&#39;s friends in school are horribly sleep-deprived! They&#39;re up no later <br/>
than 6:30. If they have no afterschool activities, they&#39;re home around <br/>
4-4:30; with sports/band/drama/whatever it may be 6-7pm. Homework takes 3-4 <br/>
hours. Then there&#39;s supper. Their natural urge to stay up late kicks in about <br/>
11 or so---and then it&#39;s up again at 6! How can they be expected to function? <br/>
Most adults don&#39;t have that kind of schedule!<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not known for their excellent eating habits at school (besides, who <br/>
can eat AND socialize in 20 minutes?). <br/>
<br/>
So far we haven&#39;t had the troubles we&#39;ve seen in his schooled friends&#39; <br/>
families (although that&#39;s hard to judge, because even when Cam was in school, <br/>
life here didn&#39;t seem that bad to him). I think if you have what it takes to <br/>
unschool ANYWAY, the other things won&#39;t seem as insurmountable! The lifestyle <br/>
just lends itself to understanding and being willing to back off when you <br/>
need to (and you don&#39;t HAVE to yell that he knew about that project two weeks <br/>
ago so why didn&#39;t he get started THEN!). It just makes gentler parenting an <br/>
easier option!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m right in your boat. Cameron turns 14 in 4 weeks. We haven&#39;t seen much of <br/>
the hormonal monkey jungle yet, but we&#39;re stocking up on bananas anyway.<br/>

he was 2 was the worst - he quit nursing then and for several months my<br/>
hormones were in a tailspin!  Now I&#39;m doing better with the menopause<br/>
thing and he&#39;s 4 - which is probably more challenging or at least is<br/>
with this one.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been fighting self-esteem issues and depression.  I do try to<br/>
keep those as *my* problems but it does affect their lives too.<br/>

<br/>
That child still will refuse something she<br/>
wants just to refuse.<br/>
<br/>
The funniest is when she refuses to cuzzle<br/>
(and she loves to cuzzle, our word for<br/>
nursing) because &quot;I&#39;m not tired and cuzzling<br/>
makes me go to sleep!&quot;<br/>

I&#39;ve had little ceremonies (just me) when I thought<br/>
that FINALLY all had stabilized and I was DONE.  I<br/>
burned all stained underwear and did a little dance of<br/>
thanksgiving, only to have my body decide to have<br/>
another go. Been a year without, now, again.  <br/>
<br/>
Ya&#39;ll know how premarin is produced?  I flat refuse to<br/>
take it.  (Can&#39;t anyway, so the gesture isn&#39;t as pure<br/>
as it should be). Phytoestrogens will have to do.<br/>
<br/>
What is that phenomena when things fly around in a<br/>
household, apparently on their own? Isn&#39;t it related<br/>
to the undercurrents of mother and pubescent<br/>
