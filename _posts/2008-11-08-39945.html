He.  Definitely a he.  Take it all with a grain of salt, though.  For  <br/>
people to expand on what they find carved on rocks is interesting but  <br/>
speculative.  Something that might help with that is a book called  <br/>
&quot;Motel of the  Mysteries,&quot; an illustrated book (short, funny) about  <br/>
future archeologists discovering a buried hotel from the 1970&#39;s and  <br/>
explaining all the items they find, including the shrine, with the  <br/>
&quot;scientists&quot; modelling the ways in which those people worshipped.<br/>
