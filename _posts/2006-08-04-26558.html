<div id="ygrps-yiv-1618742636">&quot;&lt;Your family seems so perfect it looks unattainable and its<br/>
discouraging. It would be interesting to know if you still have<br/>
&quot;balloons that you haven&#39;t let go of yet&quot;, that&#39;s all. That simple. &gt;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure whose family(ies) is being referred to here, but I keep a<br/>
blog to share some of our day -to-day stuff, so it&#39;s pretty easy to<br/>
see what&#39;s up around here.<br/>
I DO tend to focus on the positive in my blog, but then I try to do<br/>
that in my life also. <br/>
<br/>
This morning, Markus and I had a VERY heated argument. The kids were<br/>
really annoyed with us and it didn&#39;t feel very good. The argument<br/>
dwindled into a really useful discussion and some issues hammered out<br/>
that needed to be discussed. We had a peaceful day and happy evening<br/>
watching movies and eating ice cream together. It wrapped up with all<br/>
of us in my room, looking up all sorts of cool information on google,<br/>
sharing videos and having fabulous discussions.<br/>
<br/>
So even on a day when something unpleasant happened, it turned out<br/>
really good and there was a lot of learning. That kind of angry<br/>
argument hasn&#39;t happened in a very long time...that&#39;s good!:)<br/>
<br/>
Perfect? Hell no. But working towards better....always.<br/>
