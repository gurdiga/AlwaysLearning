 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m WITH you on that one Ren.<br/>
<br/>
But -- interestingly, among some of my good friends (all unschooling types), <br/>
we find ourselves using that word in a very different way. &quot;The tour was <br/>
okay, but a little too &#39;educational,&#39;&quot; or &quot;Well, we tried that but it was too <br/>
&#39;educational&#39; for us.&quot; &quot;I found these scripts of plays the kids might enjoy <br/>
putting on -- they&#39;re pretty cool even if they&#39;re a little overly <br/>
&#39;educational&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
So - it is a sort of codeword, I think, for stuff that is just too <br/>
....something..? Too fake? Too superficial? Too contrived. That&#39;s it, I <br/>
think.<br/>
<br/>
If someone said, &quot;Oh, yeah, we went to that museum. It was very educational,&quot; <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t know if that was a good thing or not. I&#39;d just like to hear, &quot;Oh, <br/>
yeah, we had a great time at the museum and there was cool stuff there and I <br/>
learned a whole lot about it.&quot; For so many of us, &quot;educational&quot; carries the <br/>
implication that someone shoved something down some poor kids&#39; throats &lt;G&gt;.  <br/>
<br/>
And of course there is the argument that you&#39;re probably making, Ren, that to <br/>
say one thing IS educational implies that other things are not. From an <br/>
unschooling point of view that is sort of a nonsense position.<br/>
