I&#39;m looking for the same, especially ones I might strew for my oldest(almost<br/>
13) who wants to be in school (told me she needs more structure . . feels lazy<br/>
homeschooling), also misses friends (sees them at band).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, was looking at the list of John Holt books yesterday, but don&#39;t know<br/>
where to start, I&#39;ve read &quot;How Children Fail&quot; and many JOhn Gatto articles. I<br/>
want some around the house.<br/>
Sorry to add myself to your query Jude, but like you say, so many out there,<br/>
I&#39;ve read everything at the local library (not much) and want to add to my own<br/>
library now.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m looking to get some books on unschooling. There are quite a few! If you<br/>
had to chose your top 2 - 3 books on unschooling/natural learning what would<br/>
they be? I definitely, but which one? I want to get a John Holt book, but<br/>
which one? He has published about 6.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thanks heaps for your wisdom,<br/>
