<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388767649">&lt;&lt;And when a teenaged boy will sit right next to (or in the lap of &lt;g&gt;) his <br/>
mom or dad in front of other people, that is NOT the same as typical <br/>
school-kid behavior.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had an interesting experience the other day that made me realize how <br/>
different my family is than many mainstream families - We&#39;re all cuddly and <br/>
gooey with each other - it&#39;s our normal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were at one of Sorscha&#39;s (now going by Tails) chosen classes and I was <br/>
standing with my booty against a work table next to a group of traditional <br/>
parenting homeschool moms.  Tails walked over and hug-fell into my arms.  I <br/>
wrapped my arms around her and kissed her beautiful stinky hair (I&#39;m gonna <br/>
miss when she washes it more thoroughly - it&#39;s a smell that is uniquely my <br/>
daughter).   Tails is the height of Beth Fuller now so I&#39;ve only got a year <br/>
or so where she&#39;s small enough for this type of hug, so I closed my eyes and <br/>
took in the moment.  When I opened my eyes (still in our hugging embrace) I <br/>
saw a mom looking at us.  Her expression was full of what I thought was <br/>
longing and I had this feeling she was saying to herself, &quot;I wish I had <br/>
that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, maybe I&#39;m wrong with my thoughts but the moment was one that I <br/>
won&#39;t forget.  It reminded me that our Radical Unschooling lifestyle can <br/>
still literally take my breath away.<br/>
