list is that I thought this was a horrible way to take this article!  <br/>
Outreach for Camp Fire based on Boy Scouts&#39; anti-gay policies?  There are so <br/>
many good things about Camp Fire, that this should be way down on the list.  <br/>
<br/>
Our club was founded by a lesbian couple and we still have another same sex <br/>
family in the club.  So, I&#39;m well aware of the gay issue and how wonderful it <br/>
is that there is an alternative for them (although there shouldn&#39;t have to be <br/>
one).  But that&#39;s not what Camp Fire is all about.  Using articles like this <br/>
diverts the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, that was probably totally off-topic for this list, but I knew a lot of <br/>
you would understand, and I always get in trouble on the CF Leader list.  ;)<br/>
