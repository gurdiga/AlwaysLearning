There is a magic club in almost every major city---and lots of minor ones throughout the US. Google IBM and SAM (International Brotherhood of Magicians and Society of American Magicians) in your area. Both have youth memberships and monthly magazines. At the meetings, you&#39;re sure to find that there&#39;s always a magician or three who will work with a new younger one. They have regular monthly meetings and will teach him a trick at every meeting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You might also look for magic conventions all over the country. There&#39;s probably one within a few hours&#39; drive soon. Register, go, and meet lots and lots of magicians who will entertain until the wee, wee hours every night.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some of my favorite magicians: Jeff McBride, Andrew Goldenhirsch, John Tudor, Alain Nu, Just Alan, Eugene Burger, Lance Burton, Max King, Harry Anderson, Penn & Teller. Google and you can watch their performances. Go to the conventions, and you can meet them. You can find many tricks online (that&#39;s good AND bad!).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
VERY important is the code that he NOT share the trick until he&#39;s mastered it (practice, practice, practice!) and NEVER tell the secret behind it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Oh---and it&#39;s &quot;*sleight* of hand&quot; or &quot;legerdemain.&quot;<br/>
