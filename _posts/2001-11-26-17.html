&gt; So... we do celebrate Christmas.  Up till now he has been spending his own<br/>
&gt; money (which he is now out of.)  What learning comes from our feeding this<br/>
&gt; money pit? What is learned by our excluding something that he has immense<br/>
&gt; interest in?  It is just so darned expensive.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband has expensive toys, too. :) We solve things here by giving every<br/>
man, woman and child a monthly allowance to spend.<br/>
<br/>
If you do an allowance and it&#39;s gone, or don&#39;t want to start one, you might<br/>
give capitalism a little go. ;) My mother hires the boy next door to mow her<br/>
lawn every week for $10/week. Dog walking or pet sitting, eBay auctions,<br/>
etc., can all be good cottage businesses for kids.<br/>
