Any stories to go with this?   Any thoughts?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2012913301">I do. When my friend&#39;s then 6 year old had the chicken pox, it was so fun<br/>
other children were jealous. She &quot;got to&quot; have a party, played &quot;stick the<br/>
pox on the donkey&quot;, and made a gooey mess with oatmeal in the bathtub. I got<br/>
to care for her for a while and this was the happiest sick little girl I&#39;d<br/>
ever seen...except for, it reminded me: When I had any sort of virus as a<br/>
kid, I got pampered too: my mom made me an &quot;island&quot; on my bed (by propping a<br/>
board across the bed on the backs of two ladderback chairs), brought me<br/>
piles of books and toys and drinks and love and attention. Of course, one of<br/>
the best parts was missing school. I got to do real learning instead, by<br/>
virtue of being sick! My point of course is that we could say to a sick<br/>
child: Be patient, you&#39;ll get better and then you can go out and play again.<br/>
Unschooling is about &quot;playing&quot; and enjoying every moment, no matter what is<br/>
going on around us, or in us. This also makes me think of the distinction<br/>
between &quot;work&quot; and &quot;play&quot;. I enjoy my &quot;work&quot; the most when I think of it and<br/>
treat it as &quot;play&quot; and this is often easier to do (and more natural) than it<br/>
sounds! (The fact that I&quot;m getting payed to do it, in fact, is often the<br/>
biggest obstacle).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1425076005">We received this new Life game for Easter, electronic, and you plug in<br/>
the time you&#39;re gonna play.  15 years equals 1 hour.  The kids and I<br/>
wanted to take the dog up to the lake today so we programmed in 1 hour<br/>
thinking that would be enough time.  When the game ended we all felt<br/>
like it just started!   <br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite stories is when my ds, 8, asked me if he&#39;s lived<br/>
before (a previous life).  I said I don&#39;t know, do you think you lived<br/>
before?  He paused for a moment and said &quot;I don&#39;t know, but if I have,<br/>
this is my best life.&quot;  This makes my heart soar!<br/>
<br/>
When I was younger I always wanted to be older than I was and couldn&#39;t<br/>
wait to grow up, but my dd, 10 today said that life is just going by<br/>
too fast and she wishes she could stay a kid even longer.<br/>

<br/>
Holly used to say that too.<br/>
<br/>
She has an older boyfriend, though, who feels like he was pressed to  <br/>
grow up too fast, and he&#39;s having fun hanging around with Holly and  <br/>
being as close to 16 as he can be sometimes, doing things that he&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;too dignified&quot; to do (according to some of his friends and  <br/>
relatives) and revelling in it.   It&#39;s pretty sweet both ways.<br/>
