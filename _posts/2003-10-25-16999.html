  yesterday. She had three daughters, the youngest is Rain&#39;s age. They&#39;d<br/>
  all done shows with Rain at one time or another. She was the last person<br/>
  I ever would have thought would kill herself....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dunno. I&#39;ve never known another apparently stable mother of three in<br/>
her forties to kill herself. She was an elementary school teacher, too, I<br/>
think this was her second year teaching. I think that was stressful for<br/>
her - she always seemed wound awfully tight, and so did her daughters.<br/>
But still... she seemed to have everything she&#39;d always wanted, she had<br/>
friends, options... why?<br/>
<br/>
It is hard. The theatre kids here are a pretty close group. Rain asked me<br/>
to please never do that - we&#39;ve seen stuff on CSI and Law and Order and<br/>
she&#39;s said the same thing, but jokingly... this was a little more<br/>
serious. It&#39;s hard to imagine a mom leaving her kids, that&#39;s what we both<br/>
keep going back to.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier this year, a high school student in Davis killed herself, and<br/>
some of the kids doing a show with Rain then knew her, and they talked<br/>
about it. There&#39;s a girl Rain&#39;s been in 4 or 5 shows with who tried to<br/>
kill herself last year, when she was 11. Apparently there was an issue<br/>
with a boy... at eleven... <br/>
