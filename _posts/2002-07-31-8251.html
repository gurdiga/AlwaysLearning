Right, we had considered this as well.  Another way to solve the slipping<br/>
off or seperation of mattresses would be to build a simple frame that sat on<br/>
the floor. The mats go inside of it. Then pad the wooden frame edges so<br/>
there are no head bumps.  I though of using the padded rails from a water<br/>
bed or making something similar to those.<br/>
As far as mattresses go if you wanted to &quot;make your own&quot; so that it would<br/>
fit any room you could use thick foam pads.  We slept on one for years when<br/>
we couldn&#39;t afford a real bed.  As long as it is thick, like 6 inches or so,<br/>
it is very comfy.  Then make covers for pillows and foam pads that are<br/>
zippered or velcroed for easy removal and washing.  The more pillows the<br/>
better.  The frame could be made in any shape you wish, like octagon or<br/>
L-shaped would be neat.<br/>
<br/>
Just some of my ideas...I don&#39;t have my original designs anymore :-(<br/>
