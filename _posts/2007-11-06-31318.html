<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412045399">-=-I would agree with this as well. I would not advocate forbidding them the<br/>
foods they crave (and if it is biochemical, it will come with cravings and<br/>
withdrawals as well). That will just make them sneak and they *will* sneak<br/>
if it is forbidden. However, I do think there is value in letting them know<br/>
that there may be a connection and seeing if you can find one.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has a sensitivity to Red Dye.  When she has had some (and it<br/>
takes very little to &quot;wind her up&quot;) she gets really angry really easily.<br/>
When we first discovered this we talked with her about it. After I had kept<br/>
a journal for several weeks and tried many different things with her (that<br/>
were non food related) we finally explained to her what we thought was the<br/>
cause of her anger.  She was 3 1/2 at the time.<br/>
<br/>
We took the red dye out of her diet.  On a couple occassions she did eat<br/>
some things with red dye in it and without warning, within an hour or two<br/>
the littlest thing was setting her off and her anger was to the point of<br/>
hitting, biting, etc.  I took her in my arms and explained to her that we<br/>
believed the way she was feeling at the moment was due to the Red Dye that<br/>
she had gotten and I would hold her until she was calm and/or ready to get<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Now, we don&#39;t really tell her she can&#39;t have things, but we will inform her<br/>
that there is red dye in them.  She willingly traded all her halloween candy<br/>
that potentially had red dye in it for things that didn&#39;t.  She doesn&#39;t try<br/>
to sneak, but I don&#39;t think she craves it either.  We also provide and keep<br/>
on hand at all times, food that does not have red dye in it.  We have gum<br/>
and suckers in the car (you know those bank ladies like to give out suckers<br/>
:) and we take peanuts to the movie theatre instead of popcorn.<br/>
<br/>
The reason behind me even investigating the &quot;red dye&quot; issue was because of<br/>
how much it hurt my heart to watch her be in so much apparent pain while she<br/>
was angry.<br/>
