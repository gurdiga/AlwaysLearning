second-tier person to a full-blown adult.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve given them an assignment, in one way.  Another way to look at it is<br/>
you&#39;ve given them an opportunity to make the next move.<br/>
<br/>
If and when they are the least big critical or ask what would be a stupid<br/>
question (meaning if they had done their reading they would have the<br/>
answer), you can say &quot;Did you read the book I gave you?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If the answer is no, you can say, &quot;After you read that, we could talk about<br/>
it some more.&quot;   The unstated other side of that chesspiece is &quot;until you<br/>
read about it, it is not my move, and any other moves you make are<br/>
cheating.&quot;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Sandra!  I loved your response.  For two reasons:  The first being it<br/>
was a great pat on the back. :)  It is always good to hear when you&#39;ve done<br/>
something good.  The second:  You are absolutely right about answering their<br/>
questions.  I have told my mother more than a dozen or so times when she<br/>
starts in on me that until she chooses to understand what we are doing there<br/>
is no reason to continue our conversation.  I have also expressed that I do<br/>
not want to hear them &quot;quiz&quot; my girls on anything.  My mother is a retired<br/>
school teacher and we have regular rounds with this stuff.  I love the part<br/>
of your response when you said &quot;it is not my move and any other moves you<br/>
make are cheating!&quot;  I am going to remember this one for the next time she<br/>
wants converse!<br/>
