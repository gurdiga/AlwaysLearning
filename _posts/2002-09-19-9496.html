<div id="ygrps-yiv-1422097870"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Why do people nolonger identify proudly as working<br/>
&gt;class even if they obviously are? <br/>
&gt;... to me it is tied to the need of our economy for<br/>
&gt;consumers. What kind of freedom is it to be in<br/>
&gt;thralldom for payments on a SUV? And, being in <br/>
&gt;debt up to your eyebrows keeps people down and quiet.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Peggy, now you are in my arena.  This is precisely<br/>
one reason that we choose to live in Intentional<br/>
Community, the money aspect.  Get away from the 9-5,<br/>
simplify, reduce our expenses and our reliance on the<br/>
consumer system by growing some of our own food,<br/>
sharing amenities and things with the community,<br/>
building a smaller home in a community where we share<br/>
the land and expenses of the land, ride/car sharing,<br/>
etc.  There are other reasons of coarse, which have to<br/>
do with unschooling, continuum concept, healthy<br/>
extended family/village atmosphere, knowing/loving our<br/>
neighbors, not being isolated, and so on.  But the<br/>
money aspect is one important part of that.<br/>
