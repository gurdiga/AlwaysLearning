&lt;&lt; That idiot teacher could do no better than mark up my<br/>
paper for &quot;incorrect sentence structure&quot;.  Makes you<br/>
wonder if any of these teachers actually consider the<br/>
merits of REAL Literature, with all it&#39;s rule breaking<br/>
and original perspective.  Or, do they actually Enjoy<br/>
the crap examples in grammar text books? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching writing to kids I very rarely commented on the structure <br/>
or content, because in many cases that was their private business.  I usually <br/>
ONLY went for mechanics of writing.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m teaching beginning calligraphers, I don&#39;t want them to imagine what <br/>
a Carolingian &quot;f&quot; COULD have looked at, I want them to learn to copy actual <br/>
period examples.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m helping people learn to play recorder (as I did with Kirby a couple <br/>
of nights ago), I really do want them to tongue every note.  YES there are <br/>
exceptions galore after you learn to do it right, but it&#39;s one thing to <br/>
choose when not to tongue, and another not to have the skill to do it and so <br/>
just skip and claim &quot;art.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With calligraphy, in fact there might be hundreds of different examples of <br/>
extant Carolingian hand, with a large range of forms of letters.  But that&#39;s <br/>
not the same as &quot;unlimited&quot; or &quot;no rules.&quot;  Some of the most wonderful <br/>
calligraphy is someone &quot;doing a riff&quot; on some descender, or getting way artsy <br/>
with a line ending or a capital letter.  <br/>
<br/>
Literature is full of exceptions.  Jazz is full of exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
But when a person is cluefree about how to do something &quot;right,&quot; his <br/>
&quot;embellishments&quot; aren&#39;t creativity so much as flailing around.<br/>
<br/>
Some people&#39;s flailing around creates art.  There are artists and musicians <br/>
who pretty much made it up on their own.  Some have an audience of one, <br/>
though, and are only amusing themselves.  Others discover something that has <br/>
broader appeal.<br/>
<br/>
&lt; Or, do they actually Enjoy<br/>
the crap examples in grammar text books?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have always enjoyed the history of English, the technicalities of <br/>
punctuation, the changing fashions involving word use and style.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
expected everyone else to think it was cool, but I actually enjoyed the crap <br/>
examples in grammar textbooks, sometime.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I never once used a grammar text book when I was teaching.  We <br/>
kept the books in their boxes at the back of the room, and used dictionaries. <br/>
 We played games with parts of speech sometimes, and goofed with them various <br/>
ways.  We would lay out all the synonyms we could think of for something and <br/>
try to identify without looking them up which were of what origin, and which <br/>
were the oldest.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I am certain that the passion I have for<br/>
the written word was long delayed due to those years<br/>
of forced writing.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Shame on them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not ashamed for using writing to help people write.  Our usual in-class <br/>
writing system was that they were to write three one-page (or longer) <br/>
anythings.  Little stories, reviews, opinions.  It didn&#39;t matter.  Three <br/>
pages.  They picked the one they liked best, or thought was the best on top, <br/>
fastened the three together and over the weekend I read through at least all <br/>
the top pages, sometimes more.  I wasn&#39;t criticizing their organization or <br/>
style.  That was going to get better as they just wrote more.  I was only <br/>
looking at mechanics.  Spelling, grammar, punctuation, sentence structure.<br/>
<br/>
I could have collected my paycheck without doing that.  I could have passed <br/>
out those books and gone through some dumbass exercise every day and NEVER <br/>
worked outside my prep period, but I didn&#39;t.  Because I like writing and I <br/>
know writing is scary, I tried to help make it a common, non-threatening, <br/>
amusing thing for them.  If they hadn&#39;t had me as an English teacher they <br/>
would have had someone worse.  So I&#39;m not very ashamed of the way I taught.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m somewhat ashamed that I couldn&#39;t change things more.<br/>

<br/>
I have to agree with you here. I love the mechanics of writing. I <br/>
think it is important to know the rules. Then you can break the rules <br/>
creatively and effectively. <br/>
<br/>
My method for writing is to get the ideas down. They flow so quickly, <br/>
you have to capture them. Then I refine them using the mechanics of <br/>
language. When I was editing, I appreciated the effort that good <br/>
writers took to make their ideas presentable and exciting. I did not <br/>
always have the time to walk those that had great ideas through the <br/>
revision stage. <br/>
<br/>
I think good writing is a balanced composition of exciting ideas and <br/>
exacting mechanics. <br/>
