<div id="ygrps-yiv-410483660">This is what my hubby said to me tonight. Usually he is onboard 100%<br/>
with the homeschooling,but he has his occasional doubts, like tonight,<br/>
i know why he said this.<br/>
there are about 3 families in our neighborhood with kids the same ages<br/>
or within a year of my dd, my dd used to play with these kids when<br/>
they were all little, before anyone went to school, now they all go to<br/>
school, my dd doesn&#39;t and they don&#39;t play with her as much. they were<br/>
all trick or treating together,.........my kids did not care, did not<br/>
notice who was walking with who,  they were just happy to be trick or<br/>
treating. they have their friends they play with all the time , just<br/>
not the same ones here in the neighborhood anymore.<br/>
so i think hubby saw them ( the other kids)  all together, and our<br/>
kids were not part of that group............he won&#39;t admit this is why<br/>
he said it, but I know it is. There are other kids in the neighborhood<br/>
of the same age range that are not friends in that particular group<br/>
either. and it is kind of a clique and i hate it. I am glad they are<br/>
not part of it, because frankly the kids are snotty and rude,( toward<br/>
adults and other kids) they don&#39;t know how to socialize with other<br/>
kids not their exact same age. the ones that are 1 or 2 years older<br/>
than my dd will not even acknowledge my kids if they say hi. I have<br/>
said things to them in the past, but I don&#39;t like to point it out to<br/>
my kids too much, they don&#39;t seem to care or even notice even though I<br/>
do. They have their group of close friends, they just don&#39;t happen to<br/>
live in our neighborhood.<br/>
any thoughts on this? any good things I can say to hubby when he says<br/>
things like this? I tend to get defensive because I am so anti school.<br/>
 I think my kids are thriving in this unschooling lifetyle.  I told<br/>
hubby I think he is afraid and feels funny about being perceived as<br/>
&quot;different&quot;. he has notions about what he thinks the kids &quot;should be<br/>
doing&quot;, he thinks it is not a good thing that they do not have the<br/>
same kind of structure as schooled kids, he thinks we are doing them a<br/>
disservice by keeping them from being a &quot;part of it all&quot;........<br/>
any thoughts on this?<br/>

i just replied to another post (OT-panic) but really this is the same issue just wrapped in a different appearance! so i&#39;ll post (below) what i wrote here again. although i&#39;ve just gathered that from the info you posted its hard to know what exactly your dh maybe truly thinking....when the time is right you should discuss it with your dh again. anyways going from your thought........<br/>
  <br/>
 <br/>
right here is the source of your fear, you&#39;ve allowed yourself to take your eyes off of your children and put them on others. you should never let other people define your children (or yourself). we are each so unique.  comparing one to another is unhealthy and truly damages relationships. not everyone learns at the same pace nor in the same style. yes we can be similar in some areas but not in all. we are individuals, one of a kinds. if you allow the fear, it will overcome you.  define your child by who they are and you achieve that by discovering that along beside them.  <br/>

When he said be a &quot;part of it all&quot;, he explained himself. He said when<br/>
he was in school he had a large group of friends, he was always off<br/>
with his friends. He doesn&#39;t see our kids as having &quot;a lot of friends&quot;<br/>
like the big groups that was trick or treating together. He said he<br/>
just starts to think about it all sometimes and questions what we are<br/>
doing.<br/>
Our kids are 7 and 4. We have a group of about 10 families we<br/>
socialize with . the kids have friends, we do have to make plans and<br/>
effort to get together with these friends, because they don&#39;t live<br/>
here in our neighborhood, so the kids don&#39;t have anyone they can just<br/>
run outside and play with.  Last summer they did occasionally play<br/>
with some of the neighborhood kids, but as soon as school starts it<br/>
changes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-961216217">Sounds like he is concerned about the kids missing out on some of the  <br/>
better aspects of his own childhood. He probably really enjoyed that  <br/>
sense of being part of the big group of friends, and he wants his  <br/>
kids to enjoy it too. I have something like that, too, which I  <br/>
sometimes regret my own kids never got. I remember getting up on  <br/>
Saturday morning, packing a lunch, and going off on my bike - riding  <br/>
for an hour or two all over the place. Then I&#39;d stop in a nice place  <br/>
and eat my lunch, then ride some more. I liked to ride at the  <br/>
different schools - elementary, jr. high, and high school, as well as  <br/>
in the open dirt fields. Sometimes another kid and I would hook up  <br/>
and ride together a while, or get started playing something together,  <br/>
but a lot of the time it was just me, by myself. I LOVED the freedom  <br/>
of it - I appreciated it even then.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, they aren&#39;t us. Even if they went to school, what was  <br/>
important to us may very likely not be important to them. Given a  <br/>
long Saturday with no scheduled activities, none of my kids would  <br/>
have chosen to go off, on their own, on a bicycle, just wandering and  <br/>
playing pretend games all alone. One of my most treasured memories is  <br/>
just totally unappealing to them.<br/>
<br/>
That urge to be part of a big group of friends is interesting. It  <br/>
might help your husband to consider that your kids are not needy of  <br/>
being part of a big group to feel accepted. They are more okay with  <br/>
themselves than he probably was and probably will be more particular  <br/>
about who they spend their time with. And, they&#39;ll be way more likely  <br/>
to consider their own siblings (and parents) as worthy of hanging out  <br/>
with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231496327">Pam wrote about good aspects of our own childhoods.  I had written  <br/>
this earlier today, with a friend (it&#39;s an IM, and he said he was  <br/>
going to Silver City, where his wife&#39;s large family lives, this  <br/>
weekend):<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to Silver City this weekend for a dia de los muertos parade<br/>
<br/>
do you have a camera?<br/>
Will you have relatives in the parade?<br/>
<br/>
yes mam<br/>
to both<br/>
<br/>
I really loved parades in Espanola. Lots of times I was in them, and  <br/>
knew about 1/4 of the people on the street<br/>
Or I was watching and knew about 1/3 of the people in the parade.<br/>
Once when kirby was little i took him to the state fair parade.<br/>
We were sitting in the median around Central somewhere around  <br/>
Wyoming, kind of a depressing place, and I was thinking how I knew  <br/>
NOBODY in the parade, and then someone said &quot;SANDRA!&quot;<br/>
It was Oñate!<br/>
Well, it was my high school classmate and friend (he kissed me once  <br/>
when I was about Holly&#39;s age) Arsenio Martinez, who was Oñate that  <br/>
year, in costume on a horse with the rest of the Espanola parade  <br/>
contingency.<br/>
I was SO GLAD he<br/>
1) saw me<br/>
2) recognized me<br/>
and 3) said something<br/>
<br/>
=========================================<br/>
<br/>
When I wrote that, I realized it&#39;s one of the things I think back to  <br/>
fondly, about my childhood--marching band, floats, parades in a small  <br/>
town...  My kids can&#39;t have that, though.  They also can&#39;t have  <br/>
buying the Beatles&#39; 45s as they come out new, which I had.<br/>
<br/>
But my kids have other, different things.  Marty is on his way to  <br/>
Oregon, and Holly can take the car and decide where to go (which has  <br/>
never been far) and come back when she wants (which  has never been  <br/>
late).<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2007/11/marty-has-left-town-again.html">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2007/11/marty-has-left-town-again.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Instead of spending time wishing they had my life (which makes *no  <br/>
sense*), it has been better for me to look at the wonderful things  <br/>
they have that I missed.  Holly just got out of bed at 2:20 p.m.,  <br/>
calm and happy. It&#39;s her last day of being fifteen.  She was up late  <br/>
with Marty (see the blog post after the one above about their costumes).<br/>
<br/>
The desire to have our children experience what we did is probably a  <br/>
totally natural instinct for passing on culture or teaching young  <br/>
primates how to find safe places to sleep and how to find food.  But  <br/>
we should look at the instinct for what it is, and not let it hold  <br/>
them back.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743755583">Yes, I think he is thinking about things from his childhood, that he<br/>
feels the kids are missing out on. I do that too.  I played a lot of<br/>
team sports, I was in the bandfront, competed in marching band<br/>
competitions.......these are all things my kids may or may not<br/>
experience. They can still be done while homeschooling, but they may<br/>
not want to.  I also think about when I was a kid going out on my bike<br/>
with the neighbor kids all day, mom not seeing us til supper time, but<br/>
times are different, and kids don&#39;t do that anymore, they get<br/>
playdates scheduled, or they go to each others houses and play there,<br/>
There are never kids just out all day, and if they are , they are<br/>
right in front of their own homes.<br/>
So even if they went off to school with these neighbors, things may or<br/>
may not be different.<br/>
And the thing is, my kids are happy, they have no problems with who<br/>
plays with them and who doesn&#39;t . they have their own group of<br/>
friends, they are over here frequently, and we are at their houses<br/>
frequently.<br/>
I think it was just all nostalgia for hubby that night thinking about<br/>
his large group of friends.<br/>
and you hit the nail on the head sandra, they are not us.<br/>
