<div id="ygrps-yiv-431181032">**What ADA requires is that the theatre make a *reasonable*<br/>
accommodation. ADA<br/>
requires that new construction have 3% of the seating capacity<br/>
accessible to<br/>
wheelchairs. That is 3 times the percentage of the general population that<br/>
use them. Once those spaces have been sold the theatre has gone beyond the<br/>
reasonable accommodation required by law.**<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t even consider the possibility that all the wheelchair seating<br/>
would be full.  The handicapped parking spaces never are!<br/>
<br/>
My mom&#39;s boyfriend has been in a wheelchair for three years and I&#39;ve<br/>
gotten kind of uppity.  There are still a lot of places that aren&#39;t<br/>
truly accessible to him, even though the disabilities legislation has<br/>
made huge improvements. <br/>

That&#39;s why I&#39;m climbing up up up to the balcony this Friday! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

ask to purchase any house seats that may become available.  These are the<br/>
seats management must hold available for the performers up until sometime<br/>
the day of the performance. If they aren&#39;t used by the performers they get<br/>
sold. They are usually very nice seats on the main floor that have the<br/>
appropriately expensive pricing.<br/>

If my leg&#39;s hurting Friday I will certainly inquire about that!<br/>
<br/>
They added two matinees; both of them were full.  I had a hard time finding <br/>
four places and still it&#39;s three in one row and one in front.<br/>
<br/>
They changed theatres in fall, and I forgot the mark the calendar to back up <br/>
the ticket request (blah blah blah, but local problem situation and they <br/>
changed the dates after they were published--did it cause them to NOT sell <br/>
out?  Nope_)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m way better every day now, though.  Progress shows now.  <br/>
