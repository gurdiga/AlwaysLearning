and raised in Ireland, author of Gulliver&#39;s Travels)<br/>
wrote a satirical piece called a Modest Proposal.  It<br/>
was a political satire aimed at the general upper<br/>
class attitute in England that both the Irish and<br/>
children (particularly Irish children) were<br/>
expendable.  A Modest Proposal details a plan to solve<br/>
the problem of the famine in Ireland at the time. <br/>
This plan involves ridding the Irish of their extra<br/>
children, while at the same time putting meat on the<br/>
table...you get the idea.  Scathing political jab.<br/>

that children were bad! Scripture is pretty consistent in its claim that<br/>
children are a blessing from God, and that unless we become like children<br/>
ourselves we will not enter His Kingdom!<br/>
But I guess people will use anything to justify a point of view.............<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The statement was specifically about the Bible, as was the response above.<br/>
The concept of Original Sin came a few hundred years after the last book was<br/>
penned.  What the Bible actually says about children is overall rather nice,<br/>
although the attitudes some people had about them even in Jesus&#39; day might<br/>
be viewed as impatient, at least: Jesus had to chastise his own disciples<br/>
for trying to make the kids leave, thus setting the stage for his &quot;for of<br/>
such is the Kingdom of Heaven&quot; statement.<br/>
<br/>
I seriously doubt poor city dwellers in Northern Europe would have had<br/>
access to a Bible, or been able to read it if they did.  I imagine the<br/>
attitudes about everything, not just children, were more influenced by<br/>
family, local tradition, and the Church than by individual Bible passages; a<br/>
person would be more likely to consult the parish priest than the family<br/>
Bible, I think.<br/>
<br/>
If the La Leche League dropout only knew the concept she believes to be<br/>
biblical originated with a Roman Catholic named Augustine...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, there we go. I tend to forget that many so called Biblical concepts like<br/>
the Trinity came from philosophers rather than directly from the Bible.<br/>

So what was his problem? Did he focus on children specifically or just that<br/>
everyone was born in sin?<br/>

<br/>
Just the ones born as children. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because Eve succumbed to snake-temptation and influenced Adam (poor innocent <br/>
Adam, who blamed Eve forevermore, through his heirs and offspring), all <br/>
children are born in pain and sin.  Bummer.  Women&#39;s fault (inheriting Eve&#39;s <br/>
sin), too.  <br/>
<br/>
So the job of Catholic (and optionally Lutheran, Presbyterian, and other <br/>
infant-baptizing churches) parents is to get them &quot;christened&quot; and <br/>
spiritually cleaned up.  But they might have a relapse when they get older, <br/>
so there are confirmation kinds of things.<br/>
<br/>
The job of lower-Protestant (further from Catholic tradition) parents is to <br/>
control the sinful little things until they&#39;re old enough to understand and <br/>
to repent and accept Jesus on their own.  But until the time that they reach <br/>
&quot;the age of accountability&quot; (also not a Bible quote, but a church-concept) <br/>
they&#39;re little bundles of sin.<br/>

place.  Hence, beat the little stinkers so God won&#39;t beat you.  (Actually,<br/>
he told his daughter God sometimes had to spank daddy; she asked if she<br/>
could watch.)<br/>
