<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316939450">could anyone who&#39;s read this book by jan fortune-wood supply me with a<br/>
brief review, positive or negative?  the only way i&#39;ll be able to get my<br/>
hands on it is to order it online from overseas, and i&#39;d sure like to<br/>
hear some opinions before i shell out the bucks.  thanks!<br/>
