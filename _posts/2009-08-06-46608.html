<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190962355">My always unschooled girls are now 12  and 14.  They were very shy as<br/>
youngsters (esp. my oldest) and against the grain, I kept them home from<br/>
school and I allowed them to blossom at their own rates of speed and I<br/>
supported them as they needed it.  I often answered questions for them.<br/>
They never stayed at other people&#39;s houses without me unless they felt<br/>
really comfortable with them.  They sometimes hid behind my legs and  had<br/>
such a hard time talking to people that they weren&#39;t comfortable with.  They<br/>
shared a family bed and then my room  long after most  people&#39;s kids were<br/>
sleeping in their own beds in their own rooms.  (even other attachment<br/>
parents I knew) But at 12 and 14 they are so self assured and confident.  It<br/>
is such a joy to watch them blossom.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We planned a trip to an island off the coast of Maine today where one of<br/>
their pony club friends lives.  We have animals here at home and my husband<br/>
is out of town, so I planned to ride the ferry over with them this morning<br/>
and return on a ferry later today.  When we got to the ferry terminal, the<br/>
boat was cancelled because the dock on the island side was malfunctioning.<br/>
We discussed our options and  returned home and waited to hear if a later<br/>
ferry was going over.  The only one available was the last ferry of the day.<br/>
That meant that we either had to wait a day so I could ride with them, or<br/>
they would have to go alone.  (together alone, lol!)  They decided to take<br/>
the ferry without me.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We arrived at the ferry this afternoon with a few minutes to spare and they<br/>
got out to grab a spot in line while I parked the truck.  It was busy<br/>
because two of the earlier ferries had been cancelled.  They had their<br/>
tickets and most of their luggage.  I told them I&#39;d grab the last bag when I<br/>
parked and meet them in line.    Well, the ferry personnel loaded the<br/>
passengers while I was still parking.  The girls boarded the boat and got<br/>
seats and got their baggage settled and then came out to meet me as I<br/>
brought their last bag on board.  I left them with a few words of caution<br/>
and reminded them to have fun and they were off.  I was so proud of them.<br/>
As they boarded, one of them had called me on my cell to let me know they<br/>
were getting on the boat. (I didn&#39;t have a chance to answer it as I was<br/>
running with their last bag as I saw the line moving from my parking spot up<br/>
the road.)  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
They are such responsible girls and they are such a pleasure to be around.<br/>
I&#39;ll miss them, but I know they&#39;ll be good guests.  They will be swimming<br/>
and possibly riding horses and hanging out with their friend and her family<br/>
for 3 days and nights.  I am truly not worried about them.  I know they make<br/>
good and safe decisions.  They were excited to be taking this journey and as<br/>
much as I will miss them, I am so excited for them.  I am so happy they were<br/>
able to do this on their own and feel confident and comfortable despite the<br/>
fact that I never pushed them out of their comfort zones when it came to<br/>
relating with people.  I have no doubt that if they need help they will not<br/>
be afraid to approach the boat personnel and address them.  They have no<br/>
fear of adults.  No us vs. them mentality.  This is their first trip where<br/>
they can&#39;t call in the middle of the night and have me come and get them.<br/>
They were not delivered to someone&#39;s door step.  They travelled on this<br/>
small journey together, but alone.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am filled with joy for them.  I have no idea what I&#39;ll do for the next 3<br/>
days to entertain myself.  I have lots of hobbies but my mind will<br/>
constantly return to them.  Not sure I&#39;ll be able to concentrate on<br/>
anything.  Maybe I&#39;ll take long walks with the dog and muck lots of stalls.<br/>
=)  <br/>
