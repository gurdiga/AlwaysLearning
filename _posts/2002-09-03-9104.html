&gt; &gt;refuse to sing patriotic songs after the pledge of allegience in the fifth <br/>
&gt; &gt;grade (I can&#39;t for the life of me remember WHY I did that!).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I still remember finally *getting* what the pledge was about, and then <br/>
&gt; refusing to say it anymore.  Liberty and justice for all in <br/>
&gt; 1962?  Sure!  Then there was the under God part.  Not me.<br/>

unschooling-dotcom group? I got this email from Tia twice. Once at 6:30 pm on <br/>
9/2 and then again at 12:30 am on 9/3. I also got her message from the *dress <br/>
for success* thread about earning the right to wear a beard twice. Other <br/>
problems I have been having with both lists is; I will get a reply someone <br/>
has written to someone else&#39;s post and won&#39;t get the OP till much later, and <br/>
sometimes what I post won&#39;t show up for hours, or ever. <br/>
I hope this is just a fluke! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
