<div id="ygrps-yiv-388193076">&lt;Is it irritating for me to let someone stay on the list who is here as  <br/>
an expert, to teach us how to be with our children? Is there any <br/>
value  in being reminded of how far we&#39;ve come, when mainstream advice <br/>
is being  presented and refuted? That can be illuminating. But the <br/>
list is  busy.&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Sorry, coming to this late because I read on Digest and in the UK.  It  <br/>
must be tiresome for the experienced unschoolers to have to respond to some  <br/>
queries, especially when the motivation behind the query is in  doubt.  But I <br/>
have to say this particular exchange WAS really  illuminating (Schuyler, I <br/>
love hearing you talk anthropology!).  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve felt this way before when there&#39;s been an element of controversy on  <br/>
the list: sometimes, in these cases, the clarifications and statements  <br/>
coming from the experienced unschoolers are absolutely crystallized and really  <br/>
helpful.<br/>
 <br/>
Could a compromise be reached in this case, ie could posts be accepted  so <br/>
long as the signature line promoting the mainstream parenting website is  <br/>
removed?  (Though I can understand why Sandra  might not want the  hassle of <br/>
policing this on top of all the other activities she gets through in a  day).<br/>
