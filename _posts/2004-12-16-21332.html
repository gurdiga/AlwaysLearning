<div id="ygrps-yiv-1183585310">remember  my husband&#39;s skeptical confusion about breastfeeding and family <br/>
bed, and  then his STRONG defense of them later.  But I wasn&#39;t able to think  <br/>
about that when I was first homeschooling because I had three little kids  <br/>
(5, 2 <br/>
and not quite born) and it was hard to think of much of anything  very <br/>
clearly.   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***We had a similiar situation.  When I started having the kids at  home in <br/>
1981 in our military community - I was the &quot;freak&quot;.  Since Russ had  to spend <br/>
time with his co-workers he didn&#39;t have the wonderful peer support I  did in La <br/>
Leche League and in our little homeschooling once a month group.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;d tell him about what I was reading, and what was happening with our kids  <br/>
and in other families.  Years later he would come home and tell me how he  had <br/>
advised co-workers about family sleeping, etc.  Once his boss had a  reading <br/>
specialist as a wife, and their youngest son was struggling to  read.  Russ <br/>
told him about our late readers and etc etc.  <br/>
 <br/>
It is a gradual process, but well worth the effort!<br/>
