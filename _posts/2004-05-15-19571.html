<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125657095">Hi Folks,<br/>
I have spent a few fruitless hours now trying to come up with a link <br/>
for a local HS friend who is getting more curious about unschooling. <br/>
I told her about AlwaysLearning and one I thought was called <br/>
Unschooling 101. I recall a few people mentioning an email(yahoo?)<br/>
group with this or a similar name. I couldn&#39;t get yahoo to cough it <br/>
up - so perhaps it lives elsewhere in the either. I have tried <br/>
looking through the archives forever it seems. There must be a trick <br/>
to that process that eludes me.<br/>
Could someone give me the link and correct name for this &quot;101&quot; group?<br/>
Many Thanks,<br/>
