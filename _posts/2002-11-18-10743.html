<div id="ygrps-yiv-1409723199">Well, there&#39;s something to be said about wishing to avoid confrontation.  <br/>
Because I really didn&#39;t want to call the grandmother unless I was <br/>
*absolutely* sure, I decided to count everything again. <br/>
<br/>
Found I had made a mistake, having put only $35 change in the drawer for <br/>
Saturday&#39;s sale, when I wrote down $45 and thought I had put in that much. <br/>
The total of all sales/money taken in was exactly $10  OVER, because I had <br/>
taken $10 out of the donations to make up for the loss.  Saturday&#39;s take <br/>
balanced, but nothing did when I added up all the sales.  <br/>
<br/>
::whew:::  Now I just have to deal with the girl&#39;s propensity to ask people <br/>
for money for herself.  I realize this is a cultural issue--she&#39;s a different <br/>
race than me.  It happens to me on occasion, little kids--strangers to <br/>
me--approaching me and asking for quarters or dollars.  Even had a boy about <br/>
9 come up and ask me if he could have a piece of our pizza!  I find it rude <br/>
and obnoxious, and realize that others might feel differently.  But what is <br/>
that about?  I don&#39;t get it.<br/>
