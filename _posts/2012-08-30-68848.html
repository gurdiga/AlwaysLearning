&quot;until i remember that while you may be unschooling your own children,  <br/>
most of you went to compulsory education for many formative years and  <br/>
so have a fundamentally different approach to life than i&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a fundamentally different approach than we do, I&#39;d like to  <br/>
hear about it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have some ideas about how you think at least some of our  <br/>
children will approach life? What do you think the differences will  <br/>
be, given your experience?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like a wee glimpse into the future :-)<br/>
