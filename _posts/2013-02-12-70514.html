Thank you for this.<br/>
<br/>
I moved into unschooling without realizing my partner wasn&#39;t as ready<br/>
for it as I was. Because I did a ton of research and he listened when<br/>
I shared with him, and because he&#39;s always been, and still is, 100%<br/>
behind keeping Tomás out of school (his own school years were<br/>
horrible), I thought we were in this together. But I was wrong. I<br/>
apologized for my error and asked how he&#39;d like to proceed, how I<br/>
could make things better but he had no answer, seems resigned, and now<br/>
things like pooping in diapers and not yet reading are evidence to him<br/>
that this kind of learning doesn&#39;t work. I tried to soothe his<br/>
discomfort by having Tomás do a few schoolish worksheets (Tomás would<br/>
have nothing to do with them, and ran crying from the room when I<br/>
asked him if he wanted to try writing his name). I shared with him<br/>
the various things Tomás did in a day, let him know when he learned<br/>
something or was excited about something new. I said if he was really<br/>
worried and against this we could send him to school; he said he&#39;d be<br/>
too far behind.<br/>
<br/>
What Sandra wrote has been in my head for a few days now. When Stan<br/>
looks at his son, I see how much he loves and adores him, and how good<br/>
they are together. But when his worry sets in, when he feeling as<br/>
though our son is behind (compared to schooled kids, and Tomás&#39;<br/>
schooled cousin, in particular), he is then seeing Tomás wrong and<br/>
lacking. Not seeing his actual, lovely child at that moment, but<br/>
everything he is not. Similar to how I felt about the diapers,<br/>
before I let it go.<br/>
<br/>
Our marriage is strong. I do not take that for granted, though. I<br/>
see my husband, where he is, and love him there. I want peace of mind<br/>
and confidence in learning for all of us. I don&#39;t know how to get<br/>
there from where we are now. How do I make this possible?<br/>

How old is your son?<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t have Pam Laricchia&#39;s book that would help.<br/>
If you haven&#39;t gone through her e-mail intro, that would help.  If you and your partner do that together, that would help.  Finding other unschooling families to meet might help.<br/>

<br/>
When you (the mom) read inspiring things, that&#39;s to inspire you. <br/>
It&#39;s not to give you tools to use against the other partner.   <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a dad is &quot;behind&quot; and it might take a year or two, but sometimes then that same dad Really gets it, and leaps ahead.  The danger is if the relationship is shakey, or if the mom uses unschooling as a wedge between people.  Don&#39;t team up with your child against his dad.   It sounds simpler than it might be, but school and two parents is better than attempted unschooling, separation/divorce, step parents, judges and social workers, no unschooling ever.  <br/>

If it seems hiring an outside voice would help, here&#39;s an assortment of possibilities:<br/>

<br/>
His worry has built up over time so it may take some time to ease. Keep drawing him in.<br/>
<br/>
There was a recent thread on Facebook about a mom worrying about a 10 yo. There might be something reassuring in the responses. Or it might make him worry more that he doesn&#39;t get to stop worrying! So better to read it first.<br/>

He is 8.  And a quirky little guy.  He was diagnosed with apraxia of  <br/>
speech when he was 2+ and, reluctantly, we worked with a speech  <br/>
therapist for a few months as prescribed by our Regional Center (we  <br/>
are in the US, in California).  The therapist was sweet, enjoyed  <br/>
Tomás&#39; sense of humor, and wasn&#39;t terribly worried about his speech so  <br/>
we didn&#39;t pursue further intervention once our county-sponsored  <br/>
sessions ended.  From what I observed, the therapy was not helping his  <br/>
speech, and he didn&#39;t like going.  It can still be difficult to  <br/>
understand him at times, which frustrates him a bit, and his syntax is  <br/>
often odd with certain phrases (&quot;What he said?&quot; for example), although  <br/>
I hardly notice it any more as I&#39;m used to how he talks.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a sweet, compassionate kid.  Very cuddly, very determined.  He  <br/>
worries about death, has come up with his own version of an afterlife  <br/>
reincarnation, and often needs me to affirm the statement, &quot;We will  <br/>
never die.&quot;  (I view this like believing in Santa, that he seems to  <br/>
really need this belief right now...not sure if my thinking on this is  <br/>
OK or helpful in the long run, but he was terribly disturbed by the  <br/>
idea that someday we would die.  Thoughts?)  He can be quick to melt  <br/>
down if things aren&#39;t working out the way he wants, loves Minecraft  <br/>
and the YouTube tutorials, and mostly wants to be at home this last  <br/>
year or so.  Last year we had annual passes to Disneyland, and often  <br/>
he would go on a ride or two and be ready to go home (Crazy, right?  A  <br/>
good example of how unlimited access does not make one want more of  <br/>
something.)  We work to meet his needs, canceling or or postponing  <br/>
outings depending on his mood.  Usually it is Stan who makes the call  <br/>
to stay in when our son really wants to be at home.  Sometimes he is  <br/>
completely sympathetic about it, other times resentful.  I tend to try  <br/>
to smooth things over, and am not sure if that is helpful or wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I have Pam&#39;s book and her emails.  I have not shared either as Stan  <br/>
asked me to not send him anything (I used to email bits and pieces to  <br/>
him that I thought he was find interesting).  I will see if he&#39;d be  <br/>
open to going through the emails together.<br/>
<br/>
An outside voice seems like a good idea.  Thank you for the link.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s entirely possible he&#39;d feel essentially the same way if your son was in school or if you were homeschooling rather than unschooling - that it&#39;s not so much about unschooling as it is a dad wanting his kid to be okay, and not seeing the signs he thinks goes along with &quot;my kid is okay&quot;. And to an extent, that may not be about his kid at all, but about himself - he&#39;s not so much worried about his son as worrying, and his son makes a good focus for that worry. I do that sometimes - if I&#39;m out of sorts I&#39;m likely to look at my life and my family through that uncomfortable lens and &quot;see&quot; my feelings projected onto the details of my life. (Something similar happens with the internet if I&#39;m in a crummy mood - if everyone online seems really bitchy, I&#39;m probably the one in a bitchy mood!).<br/>
<br/>
So it would help to look at what sorts of things help your husband feel good in a general sense, rather than &quot;feel good about his son&quot; specifically. What sets him up to feel cared for, supported, appreciated? What can you do to &quot;fill his cup&quot; so he&#39;s more likely to look at his home and family through a positive lens? <br/>

<br/>
Oh, wow, this seems spot on, Meredith.  Thank you for the observation.<br/>
<br/>
I know that when my husband was growing up, the message he received  <br/>
from his family was that &quot;different&quot; was to be avoided; fitting in was  <br/>
the goal.  And while that seemed to be a common mindset of the era (he  <br/>
was born in 1956), he had the added distinction of being one of the  <br/>
few minority families, and the only one of his descent, Japanese, in a  <br/>
very Caucasian town.  He also had a brother who was severely impaired  <br/>
developmentally. The goal to fit in was never quite attainable, and in  <br/>
some ways he seems to still be striving for it.<br/>
<br/>
So on top of having a not-yet-reading, poops-in-diapers, odd-syntax- <br/>
using son, this man who seems to want normality is being asked to  <br/>
follow a very unfamiliar path to learning and living..... poor guy!    <br/>
I can see how this would push his status quo buttons.  Heck, it still  <br/>
does that to me sometimes, and I tend to like &quot;different.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Yes yes yes.  This will be the focus.  Thank you.<br/>
