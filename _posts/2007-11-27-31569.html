<div id="ygrps-yiv-793042726">&lt;&lt;but they need a<br/>
cassette player (rarer every day), and it might be available to hear<br/>
online at some point in the nearish future.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
OK,  I needed to record my &quot;Singathon&quot; tape to MP3 and did it, <br/>
starting from clueless, using this as a guide:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifehacker.com/software/mp3/alpha-geek-how-to-digitize-cassette-tapes-222394.php">http://lifehacker.com/software/mp3/alpha-geek-how-to-digitize-cassette-tapes-222394.php</a><br/>
and using the free downloaded program, Audacity, that they explain in <br/>
the guide.  When I got confused about labeling song tracks, <br/>
Audacity&#39;s help web site was good.  And the cable was still $5 at Radio Shack.<br/>

Thanks, Pam.  I printed that out to put with my collection of tapes  <br/>
from conferences.<br/>
<br/>
I think I might be getting recording equipment for Christmas, so I&#39;ll  <br/>
stall a month.  I appreciate the help various people have offered  <br/>
very  much, and the recording of Peaceful Parenting is here:<br/>

Lauren and Lee Stranahan recorded that and helped me get it  <br/>
shareable.  Thank you.<br/>
