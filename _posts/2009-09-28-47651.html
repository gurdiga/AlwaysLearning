Scenes from the Pre-K Admissions War Zone<br/>
The No-Holds-Barred World of Applying for Elite Nursery Schools Is  <br/>
Definitely Not Child&#39;s Play<br/>
<br/>
There was a tv magazine article this morning about people trying to  <br/>
get their children into expensive pre-schools in Chicago, New York and  <br/>
San Francisco.  Is this viewable by people outside the U.S.?  I&#39;d like  <br/>
to add it to one of my pages, but not if it&#39;s only available to  <br/>
Americans.<br/>
<br/>
If it does show, it might be interesting to some here, and it&#39;s a  <br/>
cousin of the $12,000 pre-school story of last week.  Maybe that was  <br/>
just in the chat, but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
A vision popped up unbidden after I watched that show, too.  If soeone  <br/>
has paid $6,000 (the cheapest figure they gave on that article) or  <br/>
$12,000 (as someone has cited her friend as paying lately) for  <br/>
PREschool, and much more as the kids go through high school, and if  <br/>
their kid ends up working beside, or for, someone who was  <br/>
unschooled...  Not only will they be PISSED, but they&#39;ll have receipts  <br/>
to show a lawyer.<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere down the line these two parallel universes could meet in  <br/>
court and a big challenge come to the pay-per-minute education of  <br/>
babies.   IF it helps, groovy.  If it doesn&#39;t help, or if it harms,  <br/>
then what?<br/>
<br/>
If it helps, though, that will be the entree that the very-many early- <br/>
childhood teachers trained a few years back (probably still) sill  <br/>
need.   When headstart was funded for poor kids (an extra year of pre- <br/>
school to &quot;catch them up&quot;) it was proveably helpful for their &quot;success  <br/>
in first grade&quot;.  Sesame Street was funded in those days, early  <br/>
1970&#39;s, school reform days.   Then people thought &quot;not fair they&#39;re  <br/>
getting government education other kids don&#39;t get!&quot;  After that many  <br/>
states made kindergarten free and mandatory.  Before the 1980s, few  <br/>
states had mandatory kindergarten, as I remember.  Certainly New  <br/>
Mexico didn&#39;t require anything before 1st grade until around then.<br/>

stuff, and still kids are getting hooked,” she said. “I think parents<br/>
put a blinder over their faces.”&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A lot of times the blinder is good grades and school performance, and it&#39;s not just their own parents, but parents of friends are blinded by it too.  There are a lot of kids that are very good actors, they know how to impress parents.  I&#39;m surprised at how parents fall for that BS.  Chamille gets put into the &quot;bad&quot; kid category by so many parents, partly because of the way she looks, but also partly because she doesn&#39;t put on that show.<br/>
<br/>
I still get shocked at times at how young people do these things, but I see it.  Chamille and Cyle tell me all about who does what and where.  Cyle has been deeply shamed by his parents for eliminating many friends from his life.  They blame Chamille for it because Chamille won&#39;t tolerate being around some of those kids.  Any guess why?  Yep, she doesn&#39;t want anything to do with the drugs and drinking.  Cyle doesn&#39;t either.  They&#39;ve created this very small, but very wonderful network of friends.  We call it the quality over quantity network!<br/>
<br/>
Chamille stopped being friends with a kid that really still wants to be friends with her.  He keeps talking to me about it.  So, every now and again, I bring it up to Chamille.  The last time I mentioned it, she said to me, &quot;mom, I&#39;m happy with the friends that I have.  I don&#39;t need any more.  He&#39;s going to bring too much drama in my life that I don&#39;t want to deal with.&quot;  This is a kid that many parents LOVE because he knows how to put on that show.<br/>
