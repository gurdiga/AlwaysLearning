Once again you may have saved my family from the brink of utter despair &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My Danny has been making the entire family nuts.  He is a bull in a china<br/>
shop, running full speed and at full volume, beginning before the sun comes<br/>
up.  He wants what he wants when he wants it.  He&#39;s only 3 after all, but<br/>
with 2 siblings that are very close in age and size, the fur can really fly.<br/>
I have always tried distracting him and he would simply flop on the floor,<br/>
whining and yelling over and over, or worse follow people around the house<br/>
doing it, until somebody would eventually get really mad.<br/>
<br/>
I read what you wrote about removing him from the situation and having him<br/>
do real work with me.  It worked like a charm.  He was happy helping me sort<br/>
papers.  The girls were happy playing with the toys.  But the &quot;realness&quot;<br/>
seemed to be a major factor, like it re-established that he is an integral<br/>
part of the family, or something.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks once again.<br/>

I love when that happens!<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re welcome.<br/>

Probably lots of people here will have Montessori quotes or (better) personal <br/>
testimonials about real work and being with adults instead of being given <br/>
&quot;kid busy-work.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It is kinda magical, sometimes, for little kids AND big kids.<br/>
<br/>
When other adults ask for help from my 12 or 15 yr olds I can just see them <br/>
straighten up and get clear-headed.  It&#39;s great.  They don&#39;t usually do the <br/>
same for me, although today Marty was a marvelous help and I bought him a CD <br/>
he wanted (for going shopping and tree-shopping, and helping me with Holly <br/>
and gift-picking and tree-loading and just being all around cool).<br/>

When Jared was two he had pneumonia.  We bought him a plastic tool set to <br/>
keep him occupied while he was convalescing.  (Yeah, right.)  He was much <br/>
happier with our battery powered screwdriver.  He was especially jazzed by <br/>
flipping the switch that reversed the direction of the driver allowing him <br/>
to screw and unscrew into an old board to his heart&#39;s content.  Which he <br/>
did.  In.  Out.  In.  Out.  Over and over and over...<br/>
<br/>
Later that year Grandpa visited and was horrified by the fact that Jared <br/>
stood on a chair at the counter, sink, stove - wherever we were working - so <br/>
he could be involved.  Grandpa went right out and bought him a Fisher-Price <br/>
kitchen.  For safety, you know.  Jared loved that, too.  But only until he <br/>
was finished putting it together with the REAL screws and tools! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s twelve.  Last summer at the HSC conference he spent the whole time <br/>
doing &#39;real&#39; work behind the scenes rather than attending the kids&#39; program. <br/>
  He was in his glory on the loading dock carrying boxes for vendors, <br/>
stuffing literature bags, staying up late to tape off the exhibitor booths, <br/>
carrying the clipboard.<br/>
<br/>
This is all good news for parents, grandparents, and other gift-givers, of <br/>
course.  Think of the money that can be saved by NOT buying all those <br/>
cutesie, plastic, *just-like-the-real-thing* toys.  Just go out into the <br/>
garage and wrap up a rake!<br/>
