<div id="ygrps-yiv-1366833868">These are quotes from a girl here who has been homeschooled (pretty much <br/>
unschooled except for self-imposed projects) for five or six years, but who <br/>
decided to go to 10th grade.  They didn&#39;t tell the school she&#39;s technically <br/>
only the age of a 9th grader.  Here, though, are the quotes her mom remembers <br/>
from the first day:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Biology is too much like school.<br/>
<br/>
Too much like an all day Girl Scout event<br/>
<br/>
Drama is great<br/>
<br/>
I have to take humanities ALL year??<br/>
<br/>
Iâ€™m tired<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m either playing video games or going online (this was said in a psuedo <br/>
just dare to stop me voice while smiling)<br/>
<br/>
Just barely sat down to eat when the bell rang to go back to class<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;ll probably be a couple of days before I realize how much time I&#39;m wasting.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I love seeing kids&#39; &quot;first impressions&quot; of school (even though Kendra went <br/>
when she was little, she hasn&#39;t been for a long time, and high school without <br/>
midschool would be an all-of-a-sudden newness.<br/>
<br/>
I love the time-wasting one.<br/>
