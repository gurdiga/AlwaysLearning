<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160882457">Hi-- <br/>
<br/>
I so appreciated reading Sandra&#39;s update that I thought I&#39;d post one, since we are having a big shift around here.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been patiently watching my 13 1/2 yo son go through waves of interest and boredom/inactivity for a few years now.  When I was concerned, a friend directed me to a talk Sandra gave about tweens.  There was a suggestion that a &quot;percolation&quot; phase (my words, I think, maybe not hers) was normal, followed by a big change as the teen years went underway. <br/>
<br/>
Well, sure enough, he&#39;s changing, and it feels kind of like a waking up.  It began with a conversation, about two months ago, in the wee hours where he expressed his boredom in tears.  We talked about some options and things I could do to help him find more things to do, but it became clear that the root of the &quot;boredom&quot; was coming from inside him.  I turned the &quot;say yes more often&quot; phrase around to him, because he had chosen to limit his world in many ways, and now that was feeling like constriction instead of like comfy cocoon. <br/>
<br/>
All of a sudden, he&#39;s bursting forth with his own energy and initiative.  The things he&#39;s actively decided to pursue (and is now already pursing) in the past few days: <br/>
<br/>
Learning Spanish with Rosetta Stone--We found it online with the SF public library.  I signed up for a card, and then he downloaded it and started it.  I wish I&#39;d let him sign up for his own card, but I&#39;m so used to doing stuff like that for him that it didn&#39;t occur to me until too late! <br/>
<br/>
Body building and excercise--never much interest before beyond having fun, running around with friends.  Now he wants to learn about proper form, and he&#39;s using his ipod to chart out walking/jogging courses.  It&#39;s raining right now, so that will wait until the storms clear. <br/>
<br/>
Juggling--he&#39;s been practicing so much that his arms are tired.  We&#39;ll start looking for juggler videos and websites that sell cool stuff to juggle.  He wants to know what the heaviest thing is that anyone has ever juggled, but we haven&#39;t looked it up yet.  Bowling balls didn&#39;t seem to impress him--lol. <br/>
<br/>
Who knows what will be coming soon, but the wonderful thing is that I&#39;ve always had a hard time with my son finding things to do that he hooks in to.  We have tons of conversation and watch shows together, etc., but they aren&#39;t &quot;doing&quot; things.  But now he&#39;s coming up with the things that he wants to do.  Or maybe he&#39;s just now interested in doing things, and will be open to suggestions.  I don&#39;t know what the future will hold, but it all feels more interesting and exciting! <br/>
<br/>
Through this whole tween period, I&#39;ve always wondered if I was up to the unschooling challenge.  If I hadn&#39;t heard that talk that Sandra did on a radio program, I would have for sure felt much more insecure. Now that he&#39;s coming out of it, it is becoming so clear that he needed his &quot;percolating time&quot; and that it is all o.k.  It makes me wonder even more about why people buy into the school system, and how it is set up to be &quot;consistent&quot;--no one ever gets a break.  There is no percolating time--no time to day dream for a few months or years--just  work, work, work.  No wonder we are losing our dreamers.  They are constantly being yanked back to earth before they are ready! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the support on this list!!  And if you have a tween that seems to be in the &quot;doldrums,&quot; hang in there and know that things will happen in due time! <br/>

This is really interesting.   It might be easier for a child whose  <br/>
parent(s) consciously tried to say &quot;yes&quot; and open up the world to then  <br/>
realize that he himself has been saying &quot;no&quot; to the world and himself  <br/>
more than he needs to!<br/>
<br/>
Very good idea, Joanna!!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really interesting!  I&#39;ve seen something similar around here.  I<br/>
like the &quot;say yes more often&quot; approach, I&#39;ll have to use that!  I can<br/>
see it happening naturally in small ways already, but my daughter had<br/>
certainly limited herseld to a very narrow world.<br/>
<br/>
It is and has been very restricting.  It&#39;s been this way with,<br/>
everything, food, people, clothing, music.  It hasn&#39;t been all bad, in a<br/>
way, it&#39;s been totally necessary for defining who she is as a person, in<br/>
part, by defining what she is not.  I can see, now how, she&#39;s really<br/>
comfortable with who she is as a person, and is somewhat directionless<br/>
within her self made parameters because they&#39;ve become boring.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s starting to consider expanding her world.  It&#39;s her comfort zone,<br/>
so it&#39;s challenging, but interesting and I see it as inevitable.  At<br/>
this point, I wonder which way she&#39;ll go!  If she could, she&#39;d go to<br/>
beauty school and learn to cut hair.  That is what she really really<br/>
wants to do, but she&#39;s too young.  Ahhh that age thing again!  So, we<br/>
are working towards a driver&#39;s permit, which can happen in a couple of<br/>
months, and that&#39;s exciting!</div>
