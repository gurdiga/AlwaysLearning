Hi, <br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of you in quite awhile, but happened to pull out your “Big book of Unschooling&quot; for a friend.  About  7 years ago this book was my bible.  That and your website.  I even took the book in the car with me running errands.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve come a long way since then.  I can say without any doubt, Unschooling was the best thing to happen to our family.  My kids are 11, 13, and 19.  I enjoy a close contented relationship with all of them, and have not experienced any of the &quot;issues&quot; that most parents complain about.  Over the years our family has done some amazing things—trips, projects, pen pals.....<br/>
<br/>
In the beginning, I had so much fear like &quot;Oh my God, what if they never learn Algebra!&quot;  Dumb unfounded fears.  My 19 year old never learned it.  And she is a functional member of society.  The most important thing I&#39;ve learned, is your kids know what they need, and learn to acquire what they need. You just have to trust.<br/>
<br/>
My 19 year old teaches piano out of our home, works at pet smart as the Pet Care Specialist (she loves this job) and will start Cosmetology school in May. Apparently doing all her friends&#39; make up for the prom became quite a skill.<br/>
<br/>
My 13 year old breeds Guinea hens, has an unbelievable assortment of pets, and volunteers at the SPCA.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old son is still not reading (which strikes fear in the heart of many family and friends).<br/>
However, can tack up a horse, check the oil in all our cars, fix my Dyson vacuum and just about any appliance in our home.  That doesn&#39;t include his video game skill, or his music knowledge .<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m never bored.  I wish all the parents who are wishy washy about this lifestyle could just know what I know.  At times it takes so much trust, but wow is it worth it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for all you write.  Consider my family one of your great success stories.<br/>
<br/>
