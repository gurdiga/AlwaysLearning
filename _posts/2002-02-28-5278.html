<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294636355">Hi Tia,<br/>
We&#39;re finally getting snow here!  It&#39;s really winter.  We&#39;ve been out<br/>
making snow angels.   Mine was actually a poop angel.  I think that gives<br/>
it more artistic credibility.  Remember the artist whose Virgin Mary had<br/>
the elephant dung breast?  Well, this wasn&#39;t actually a dog doo breast. <br/>
More like a goiter.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a Yahoo fart.  I think everyone is out making snow<br/>
angels.<br/>
None so pretty as mine though.<br/>

It was, IMHO, dumb at every possible level and perspective. The artist got<br/>
to do what he/she wanted, which was get national media exposure (you should<br/>
pardon the pun) and everybody&#39;s panties in an uproar. Conservatives got to<br/>
use it to foam that the NEA is run by Satan and we should stop funding.<br/>
Liberals got to lunge around about the purity and value of art in all its<br/>
forms, including literal crap.<br/>

What a bunch of maroons.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-226550662">Well, we&#39;ve been dealing with a death in the family here today. :o( Casey&#39;s <br/>
beloved hamster, Tiny, died yesterday. He lived a good life and appeared to <br/>
die of old age. Casey is still very distraught.<br/>
<br/>
We prepared a traditional Egyptian sarcophagus for him out of an old <br/>
checkbook box. We have interred him with bedding and food for his trip to <br/>
the otherside, and Casey placed jewels (beads) and treasures for him as <br/>
well. We had an open casket viewing last night and hope to be able to break <br/>
through the frozen Utah soil to bury him soon.<br/>
<br/>
Today was spent finding old pictures of Tiny, marvelling at how much he <br/>
really did age in the past two years, and creating a lovely photo montage in <br/>
his honor.<br/>
<br/>
He will be missed.<br/>
<br/>

You can light some charcoal  on the ground and dig down by degrees as the<br/>
ground thaws, re lighting and letting them burn when you run into more<br/>
frozen earth.  It doesn&#39;t take too long.  <br/>

I just got back from South El Monte here in Southern California. I&#39;m glad<br/>
the air conditioning in the truck was working because inside the cab it was<br/>
much warmer than the 82 degrees the bank sign said.<br/>
<br/>
I could use a pretty snow Angel about now &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks. I showed your note to Casey. She appreciates all good wishes. She is <br/>
printing out all of her condolences, too. Our family and friends have been <br/>
sending them as well. It&#39;s very sweet how people are treating her sorrow <br/>
with such respect and dignity. My guess is that the notes will appear <br/>
someday, along with photos, stories, poetry and other mementos in some sort <br/>
of a memorial scrapbook or something. That&#39;s Casey&#39;s way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I think the funeral sounds lovely, though (for a funeral),&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, that was just preparing the body and the viewing. A small service <br/>
will be held on Saturday by the waterfall in our backyard. We hope to dig <br/>
enough ground by then. Until then, he&#39;s kind of hanging out in &quot;cold <br/>
storage&quot; in the garage. :-o<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;and I hope you overcame the thought of it being in bad taste enough to <br/>
&gt;&gt;take a photo of him in his casket.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had suggested this to Casey. She said she prefers to remember him as he <br/>
was. A sort of shrine seems to be forming around his former home, though. We <br/>
have the photo montage, condolence notes and a picture of Tiny in a car <br/>
shaped frame inside his cage. I believe the car is taking him to the &quot;next <br/>
place&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And so it goes.<br/>
