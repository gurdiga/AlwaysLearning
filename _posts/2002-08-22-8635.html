Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
If your friend spells her daughters name &quot;Eowyn&quot; could be from The Lord of<br/>
the Rings.  Middle Earth history ? maybe ?  Eowyn was the fearless daughter<br/>
of King Theoden.   Yes, I read the book more than once.  Maybe I&#39;m way off,<br/>
but that is where I recognize the name.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Aowyn only turns up a 100 or so hits on Google. A handful of people with<br/>
that name but mostly personas.<br/>
<br/>
And Eowyn if you subtract out Tolkien seems to only relate to fantasy stuff.<br/>
(One website says Tolkien made it up and it means &quot;horse lover&quot; in Old<br/>
English.)<br/>
<br/>
wyn is Old Irish for fair or white and Old English (?) for friend<br/>
<br/>
aodh (pronounced AY) is celtic for fire.<br/>
<br/>
The few other Ao and Eo names the ao and eo are the first letters of words<br/>
that would pretty much lose their meaning if the last half was dropped, like<br/>
eoch meaning horse in Old Scottish.<br/>

<br/>
How can you subtract out Tolkien!?<br/>
Except for him being a linguist.<br/>
<br/>
If an out-of-style name comes back, it&#39;s interesting to wonder whether it&#39;s <br/>
then a &quot;revival&quot; name or a new/fantasy name.<br/>
<br/>
In the SCA, I know people with both those names, and because I only know them <br/>
in the SCA, I&#39;d call them that in WalMart, although they might want to <br/>
correct  me if their grandmothers were there. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was introduced at a wedding, by the bride, to her grandmother, as <br/>
&quot;AElflaed&quot; once.  I was embarrassed for the grandmother, because &quot;Sandra&quot; was <br/>
easy to understand and repeat and &quot;AElflaed&quot; rarely is unless the person&#39;s <br/>
just fluent in fantasy or old Saxon trivia.  But the bride couldn&#39;t think of <br/>
&quot;Sandra&quot; fast enough.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s almost religious obligation among the pagans around here to use those <br/>
names for their children born in the past 20 years.  My kids were visiting <br/>
another family last week whose kids are named Rowan and Rhiannon.   <br/>

I thik it comes from the welsh for white which is gwyn although wyn <br/>
means lamb (pronounced oo-in)<br/>
<br/>
I was going to call Heather Eowyn but we knew too many at that <br/>
time and I wanted somethig unusual. We then move back to <br/>
England and find a whole bunch of Heather&#39;s. Sigh.<br/>

<br/>
Or &quot;How can you?&quot; as in &quot;Why would anyone in their right mind want to?&quot; So I<br/>
could see how it was used outside of references to Lord of the Rings.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it was a rhetorical question that went right over my head! :-) In<br/>
that case, never mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, either the name or being Welsh must limit their appearance on the<br/>
internet ;-) Oh! I guess since it was popular when you were naming your<br/>
daughter maybe they aren&#39;t old enough yet!<br/>
<br/>
I have a Welsh Names for Children book from 1980 which doesn&#39;t have it so it<br/>
must be newer than that.<br/>

OH!  You meant not rhetorically say leaving Tolkien out, but mathematically <br/>
eliminating him from the Google search.<br/>
<br/>
Okay then!  Now I get it fully and entirely.<br/>
