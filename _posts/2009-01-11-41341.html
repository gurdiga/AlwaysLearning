<div id="ygrps-yiv-637719824">She&#39;s been mentioning for a while that she wants to learn to read.  I <br/>
read to her, she peruses books on her own, gets a kick out of closed-<br/>
captioning (which we don&#39;t have at home - she sees it occasionally in <br/>
restaurants, stores, etc.), and plays games on her Leapster, her <br/>
Vtech computer, and on websites like nickjr.com, pbskids.org, and <br/>
Disney.  She got some writing workbooks for Christmas & it was like <br/>
candy for her - she couldn&#39;t seem to get enough.  She seemed like she <br/>
really was hungry for it, so one day I asked her if she wanted me to <br/>
(cringe) teach her to read, and she excitedly said yes.  <br/>
<br/>
I learned to read by using Phonics, and can see some benefit to using <br/>
some of the ideas, but remember being really confused by words like <br/>
*women*.  So - my question is, does an unschooling family *teach* one <br/>
of its members to read?  Do I just keep reading to her like I&#39;ve been <br/>
doing, pointing out words on signs, etc., or since she is asking for <br/>
guidance, where to I go from here?  I know that this group is not <br/>
about teaching, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m asking here.  I don&#39;t want to *do* <br/>
school.  But I want her help feed her hunger.<br/>
<br/>
I have little doubt that this has been discussed here before, so if <br/>
any of you can point me toward a related thread, I&#39;d appreciate it.</div>

<br/>
The problem is, you can&#39;t teach her to read.  If it goes well, the  <br/>
most you can do is help her learn, and if she&#39;s not yet ready, the  <br/>
least you can do is frustrate her and make her feel slow.   The most  <br/>
you could if it&#39;s not yet time is make her think reading is hard and  <br/>
she&#39;s not capable.<br/>
<br/>
What a robbery if a five year old thinks someone had to teach her to  <br/>
read, and thinks someone did teach her to read.  She&#39;ll want someone  <br/>
to teach her other things that she could have learned on her own, too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you have the urge to offer to try to help someone learn something,  <br/>
state it that way.  Say &quot;I can try to help you a little if you  <br/>
want.&quot;  That way if you try, a little, you&#39;ve been truthful and  <br/>
honest.  And ONLY try a little.  If it&#39;s good and she wants more,  <br/>
offer a little more.  That little might turn into a lot, or it might  <br/>
not.  Let it unfold naturally.<br/>
<br/>
We made phonics games with cardboard and strips of paper.  They  <br/>
weren&#39;t lessons, they were goofy homemade toys.  (In school they  <br/>
would have been lessons, and required, and documented, but here they  <br/>
weren&#39;t any of that.)<br/>
<br/>
There are computer games and websites with choose-the-vowel games and  <br/>
reading choices games.  If they&#39;re treated just as games and nothing  <br/>
more, they don&#39;t hurt anything.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-326505236">My youngest is 24. Not just computer games but personal computers in general<br/>
seem a whole different world than when my children were young.  My<br/>
grandchildren have played with text messaging on Iphones and  adding random<br/>
keystrokes when Mommy  &quot;talks&quot; to Daddy at work via instant message since<br/>
they were 1 year old.<br/>
<br/>
Starfall makes Reader Rabbit seem absolutely boring and dull.  Also makes<br/>
Reader Rabbit seem a stereotype of &quot;educational&quot; software.<br/>
My only complaint about Starfall is it is soooooooooooo  multilayered that<br/>
it is very easy not to realize just how many resources on how many levels it<br/>
offers.<br/>
<br/>
I need to check out uptoten and see whether they have discovered it.   I<br/>
had told their mommy about starfall after I saw it was recommended on some<br/>
list (maybe this one?). Had given a few different links but for my oldest<br/>
grandchild a couple of years ago starfall was the biggest &quot;hit&quot; and I know<br/>
she still comes back to it occasionally.<br/>

I suggested that maybe those web sites could help. He used to play a little on them when he was 3-4.<br/>
He went there played for maybe 15 minutes and he was done.<br/>
 <br/>
He likes to play Roblox and talk to the people so that is how he dos a lot of reading and writing asking us to spell and read to him all the time. Its amazing to see how he is learning. Very cool.<br/>
He also likes to make book qwith his drawings and writes on those what he can.<br/>
I once told him that he is learning to read just like his sister learned to talk. He can relate to that because he witnessed how she went from a few words to talking . He laughs with me when she comes up with complicated new words in her vocabulary. Its very cute and he thinks so too.<br/>
A few months ago he wanted really bad to learn to read right now .He has noticed how good he has gotten at it and now it does not frustrate him as much. <br/>

This is what is happening with Karl.  He was terribly frustrated and felt so<br/>
dumb because someone said he should be reading already (at 5?).  I showed<br/>
him Starfall which he was on for about 15 or 20 minutes and then a couple of<br/>
weeks later he wanted to look at it again and that has been it.  So now at<br/>
about 5 1/2 he has been recognizing a few words here and there, and asking<br/>
how to spell all kinds of words, asking what signs of all sorts say not just<br/>
road signs, writing with his drawings, asking me to read games online and<br/>
off, and so on.  It&#39;s very exciting and I like what he does with it all,<br/>
making up stories and talking in different ways than he used to,<br/>
incorporating into what he already has been doing with stories and<br/>
playacting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542730896">When my oldest daughter said she wanted to learn to read, I calmly  <br/>
said: &quot;Okay - what word do you want to learn first?&quot; I wrote the word  <br/>
on an index card and she drew a picture on the other side of the card.  <br/>
For example, if she says, &quot;Dinosaur,&quot; then you write it on one side of  <br/>
the card and she draws a picture of a dinosaur on the other side. (If  <br/>
she&#39;s not into drawing something, find a picture to cut out of a  <br/>
magazine or print one off the internet and glue it onto the card.)<br/>
<br/>
I put the cards in an envelope that said &quot;Roya&#39;s Words&quot; on it.  Every  <br/>
once in a while she&#39;d want to add a word - we&#39;d put a new word on a  <br/>
card and she&#39;d draw on the other side and that would go into the  <br/>
envelope. Every once in a while she&#39;d pull out her words and sort  <br/>
through them and &quot;practice&quot; them. She got up to about 30 words over a  <br/>
period of a couple of months before losing interest.<br/>
<br/>
I think it satisfied her urge to feel like she was &quot;learning to read.&quot;<br/>

actually very different and often produce different results.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to add that the people I know, who were taught how to<br/>
read, do not enjoy reading. My little brother, my father, my cousins,<br/>
many of my friends, my oldest son. These people were taught how to<br/>
read and do not find the experience enjoyable as adults, nor did they<br/>
as children. Everyone I know, who learned how to read, are avid<br/>
readers who devour books for pleasure. Myself, my husband, my mother,<br/>
my younger son. These people learned how to read and have always found<br/>
the activity to be rewarding and enjoyable. <br/>
<br/>
I think, my advice, as someone who has one son who was taught how to<br/>
read and one son who learned how to read is to be very careful in<br/>
recognizing the difference between teaching someone and aiding them in<br/>
learning, and not overstepping that line.</div>

best to avoid any recommendations of &quot;teaching.&quot;  There are some  <br/>
things with formal structure that will need a teacher or a coach  <br/>
(ballet, karate, gymnastics competition) but those things school  <br/>
calls &quot;academics&quot; seem not to need any teaching, given a rich and  <br/>
friendly environment in which a child can explore and experiment with  <br/>
the assistance of an adult or two or three who like them and  <br/>
understand how to help them learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113723924">I&#39;ve been sort of vaguely distinguishing &quot;instruction&quot; from &quot;teaching&quot;  <br/>
in my mind --- maybe not in line with dictionary definitions or common  <br/>
usage, but it has helped me think about it. Instruction is &quot;useful&quot; -  <br/>
instructions help me do things I want to do. Instruction is  <br/>
specifically for a purpose and it&#39;s use is initiated and can be  <br/>
terminated by the learner. When instructions come with my new  <br/>
computer, I can utilize those instructions in the way they work for  <br/>
me. If I want to learn ballet, I can watch instructional videos, read  <br/>
instructional books, or maybe get instruction in a ballet class. I  <br/>
sign up for ballet knowing what to expect, knowing that if I don&#39;t get  <br/>
the help I expect to get, I can find another instructor or do  <br/>
something else.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching, for most people, implies that the teacher is deciding what  <br/>
the learner ought to learn, how they ought to learn it, when they  <br/>
should be done learning it, and the teacher tests how much they&#39;ve  <br/>
(supposedly) learned. Even piano teachers, for example, very often  <br/>
think THEY should be totally in charge of what the student learns and  <br/>
how they learn it - it is rare to find a piano teacher who will simply  <br/>
help a student learn the way they want to learn and what they want to  <br/>
learn. At least we can shop around for piano teachers, though. If mom  <br/>
decides to be a teacher, the kids can&#39;t shop around to find another  <br/>
one who will do things their way. That puts it in a different light  <br/>
than, say, a ballet, karate, or piano teacher.<br/>

&gt; *women*. So - my question is, does an unschooling family *teach* one<br/>
&gt; of its members to read?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not a fan of phonics!  I&#39;ve seen it cause kids to really not be able<br/>
to spell all those confusing english language words.  Perhaps that is<br/>
why the word &quot;women&quot; was confusing.  It isn&#39;t spelled at all the way it<br/>
sounds.<br/>
<br/>
My older daughter didn&#39;t get phonics at all!  It totally confused her. <br/>
The whole idea of letters having sounds and groups of letters having<br/>
sounds and combining those sounds.  Very confusing for her.  She<br/>
understands it a little better now that she knows how to read, but<br/>
doesn&#39;t rely on it to read words she doesn&#39;t know yet.<br/>
<br/>
Her process was one of collecting words.  When she had enough of them to<br/>
string together, she was reading.  The more words she collected, the<br/>
more she was able to read.  Only time made that work.  She learned to<br/>
read pretty fluently at the age of 11/12.  She started collecting words<br/>
when she was 3, starting with the &quot;stop&quot; sign.<br/>
<br/>
My younger daughter understands phonics.  I see and hear her read words<br/>
that look like other words she knows and sound them out based on which<br/>
letter combinations they have.  Mostly it works for her, and I help her<br/>
with the tricky ones and explain why it&#39;s different and give examples. <br/>
It&#39;s all information that she gathers and uses.  It&#39;s low pressure.<br/>
<br/>
All the kids in school, doing the same thing, are being told that they<br/>
can read because they can do those things and fill them out on<br/>
worksheets and read the silly little easy reader exercises.  Margaux<br/>

<br/>
When I was teaching dance classes, I was continually surprised by the<br/>
parental expectations of what I should or shouldn&#39;t be teaching in a<br/>
dance class.  I remember this one group of moms specifically that wanted<br/>
a finished product, they wanted their 5 yr olds doing complex<br/>
choreography, and while, each lesson, we spent the last 15 minutes<br/>
working on a routine, the moms, wanted the whole class to be designated<br/>
to that.  I remember telling those moms, that as long as half the kids<br/>
in the class still couldn&#39;t skip, that I couldn&#39;t progress the class to<br/>
choreography beyond what we were already doing.  They argued that their<br/>
kids did complex choreography at home with their own music, so therefore<br/>
should be able to do it in my class.<br/>
<br/>
The whole thing, everything they wanted, was the finished product<br/>
without all the stuff in the middle to get them there.  It was weird. <br/>
The moms didn&#39;t like me very much and their kids didn&#39;t stay very long<br/>
with me.  The kids liked me just fine and loved class.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right - I mean, I realize that. I&#39;m just saying that it has been  <br/>
helpful for me to think of the difference between what people think of  <br/>
as &quot;being a teacher&quot; with all that entails versus the process of using  <br/>
instructions or instructors (whatever they might be called). I know  <br/>
that the words &quot;instructor&quot; and &quot;teacher&quot; are used interchangeably  <br/>
(I&#39;ve been officially hired as an economics teacher, instructor,  <br/>
lecturer, and professor and they&#39;ve all been exactly the same job).  <br/>
And I&#39;m not recommending that other people start using the terms  <br/>
differently. I&#39;m saying that it helped me &quot;get&quot; the reason unschoolers  <br/>
recommended not using the word teach or thinking of the unschooling  <br/>
parent as a teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Instructions are to instructors as ___________ are to teachers.<br/>
<br/>
What fits in that blank? Teachings, I think. There is a difference  <br/>
between teachings and instructions - teachings seems bigger, more  <br/>
pervasive, something being handed down from on high.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever they are called, there are people who are giving instructions  <br/>
and helping people gain a skill or learn information that the people  <br/>
want to learn. And then there are teachers who are deciding what and  <br/>
when and how people should learn and have the force of law or parental  <br/>
authority behind them.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I&#39;m not saying this is a semantics distinction that we ought to  <br/>
make; I&#39;m saying that pondering this difference helped me comprehend  <br/>
why unschoolers seemed to be so down on teaching even though they  <br/>
clearly were utilizing teachers when it suited them to do so (karate,  <br/>
ballet, guitar, etc).<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and I fully realize that good teachers are also facilitating in  <br/>
the helpful/useful sort of way, too. And I realize that &quot;follow  <br/>
instructions&quot; has its own school-related baggage.<br/>
<br/>
In universities, an instructor is a rank that is below professor and  <br/>
nobody teaching at the college level is called a teacher because that  <br/>
term is used for k-12 levels only.<br/>

neutral.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think teachers in public school have &quot;teachings.&quot;  They&#39;re  <br/>
offering technical and neutral info too, very rarely of their own  <br/>
discovery or creation.<br/>
<br/>
So while we&#39;re cataloging crazy English with its too-many words and  <br/>
difficult nuances, there are Teachers who have their own teachings,  <br/>
often (I&#39;m thinking) involving music or philosophy, and then there are  <br/>
teachers who are low-level instructors.  Then there are instructions  <br/>
and things that are instructive without anyone trying to own them.   I  <br/>
could write up the instructions for making a God&#39;s eye or a basket  <br/>
made of rope and yarn.  I have written instructions for doing things  <br/>
before.  They&#39;ll still exist (maybe) after I&#39;m gone, and should still  <br/>
work, maybe.  People don&#39;t necessarily need instructors to follow  <br/>
instructions (if they&#39;re in writing, or drawn/sketched out, or even on  <br/>
video tape).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-619750865">I do think there&#39;s a vast difference between teachers and instructions from<br/>
a person sharing what they know.  Sharing what a person knows about reading<br/>
is not usually anything like sharing what a person knows about making<br/>
something, where if the person wanting to know the information has hands<br/>
and/or a mind that works differently from the one instructing, such a<br/>
difference is respected and accommodated for with time for the learner to<br/>
make minor adjustments or time to figure out on their own how to make the<br/>
process work for them.<br/>
<br/>
Coming from an art background, I have seen that over and over again.  There<br/>
are grad assistants/instructors/professors/etc who instruct in art (in Pam&#39;s<br/>
sense of the word) as opposed to those who prefer to teach art.  Many times<br/>
people who hope to teach art invariably do so without respect for<br/>
differences and aren&#39;t as successful in transferring the skills they have to<br/>
others.  It happens in art as well as other types of classes.<br/>
<br/>
I think reading is a particularly difficult skill to give instruction in<br/>
because the process is so much in the head, and adjustments take much longer<br/>
because the feedback from the process of learning reading takes longer.<br/>
Other things have more immediate feedback and results like ballet, karate,<br/>
art, sewing, and so on.<br/>

<br/>
Of my three children, I got to really observe the process of two of  <br/>
them learning to read. But my middle child learned to read very young  <br/>
and I wasn&#39;t expecting it yet and she did it very very privately. Only  <br/>
her older sister, who was 6, was even aware that she was reading; it  <br/>
took me completely by surprise. Also, neither of my other two children  <br/>
ever did the &quot;sounding out&quot; style of learning to read. They memorized  <br/>
a lot of words and read with expression from the very beginning.<br/>
<br/>
So, you never know what to expect - I mean, we can&#39;t tell in advance  <br/>
what &quot;learning to read&quot; is going to look like in any particular child.<br/>

Yes, Joanna.<br/>
<br/>
I think there&#39;s all the more reason, since it isn&#39;t as obvious in the later<br/>
years, to cultivate a child-to-parent relationship that makes for lots of<br/>
sharing.  So with a parent focusing on having fun in the parent-child<br/>
relationship, there&#39;s less emphasis on seeing learning and better motives<br/>
for keeping on with unschooling since ideally the relationship is the most<br/>
important and fun focus!<br/>
