<div id="ygrps-yiv-923559921">Hi! My name is Tara, mom to DS, &quot;Z&quot; and wife to Justin. We have a <br/>
great local group but I love the diversity of experience I can find <br/>
on these boards.<br/>
<br/>
Z is 8 (9 in Aug), loves Webkinz, Club Penguin, Pokemon and recently <br/>
cooking! He says he plans to travel to Egypt when he&#39;s 19, find the <br/>
treasure buried in the pyramids, then come home and become famous in <br/>
his own band, then finally be a chef in his friends restuarant!<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a foreman in the carpenters union and unfortunetly <br/>
works more than he&#39;d like, although that should change soon. I&#39;m a <br/>
retired massage therapist. (Although I only worked a couple days a <br/>
week, I just recently decided to stay home full time.) We&#39;re hoping <br/>
to have more kids soon as well.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been unschooling for over a year now but didn&#39;t start mindfully <br/>
unschooling until a bit later than that. We&#39;ve probably made all the <br/>
preverbial mistakes one can make in going from conventional parenting <br/>
to peaceful parenting. The biggest and first one was probably in <br/>
telling our son what exactly unschooling was! I wish I had known to <br/>
just start saying &quot;yes&quot; but I somehow missed that until it was too <br/>
late! LOL<br/>
<br/>
All in all, we&#39;ve come a long way and are looking forward to learning <br/>
more about practical ways to apply what we know. I think that is the <br/>
biggest issue I currently face: I&#39;ve changed the way I think and want <br/>
to respond but I don&#39;t always know the practical way to put it into <br/>
action, ya know?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to lurking, questioning and occasionally sharing!<br/>
<br/>
