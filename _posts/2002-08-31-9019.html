&lt;&lt;  We used to love and camp at Big Lagoon State Park and my all time <br/>
favorite, <br/>
 can&#39;t be beat beach in my opinion, is at Perdido Key, the second part coming <br/>
 from the &quot;FloraBama&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes! We went camping last year at Big Lagoon when an unschooling.com <br/>
gathering of Floridians fell apart. It was really fun. We liked the little <br/>
hike from the campgrounds over to the beach area.<br/>
Perdido key is really pretty, we like Johnson beach the best. Just went <br/>
kayaking there last month and got up close to dolphins (even a little baby) <br/>
and many sting rays.<br/>

&lt;&lt;   Ever been to Fairhope, AL?  That&#39;s my hometown. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yep. Lived in Gulf Shores for the first three months we moved here (while <br/>
house hunting) so we drove through Elberta and all those little outlying <br/>
areas while searching around.<br/>
Fairhope is pretty, and close enough to Mobile to get all the culture.<br/>

 I remember being in the line at the grocery store when we first moved to <br/>
 Houston and saw a couple (one Caucasian, the other African American) walk <br/>
 into the store and I was waiting to here a comment, see a look, <br/>
 something........but no one even blinked an eye at them.  <br/>
   That&#39;s how I know Houston IS NOT the South.  And it is one of the only <br/>
 things I like about this place.  When you grow up in an area and live there <br/>
 all your life you think certain things are just &quot;normal&quot; or you know they <br/>
 aren&#39;t right but you&#39;re not sure how to respond to those not so &quot;tolerant&quot; <br/>
 individuals.  Am I making any sense.  If you&#39;ve ever grown up in what I call <br/>
 an &quot;undercurrent&quot; maybe this makes sense. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I SO understand. I grew up in Alaska, where this &quot;undercurrent&quot; of racial <br/>
intolerance is NOT the norm at all. There aren&#39;t a whole lot of black <br/>
families in Fairbanks, but there are a lot of well traveled people and a <br/>
touch of many different cultures even though it&#39;s predominantly caucasian <br/>
still.<br/>
It&#39;s a fairly liberal college town, lots of hippy type people and musicians, <br/>
authors, artists....sigh.  I really love that about it. Plenty of weirdos <br/>
too.....really weird in a not good way...but that&#39;s the beauty of it.<br/>
I lived for nine years in the NW after Alaska (Washington/Oregon) which is <br/>
fairly liberal too (at least the Portland and Seattle areas are!)<br/>
So when I got down here it was a bit of a shock to say the least. Anyone up <br/>
North that would actually admit they thought interracial marriage was bad, <br/>
would be heavily questioned at the least! It&#39;s not an attitude that would be <br/>
tolerated by most.<br/>
I hear stuff like that down here and nobody saying anything against it. I&#39;ve <br/>
been the lone voice more than once. YIKES!!<br/>
My firtst and biggest shock was seeing an anouncement about a KKK rally in <br/>
the newspaper after we&#39;d been here about 2 weeks. I almost jumped in the car <br/>
and headed back North at that point.  But I&#39;m glad I stayed to see that there <br/>
are many, many wonderful people here, gorgeous beaches and a really strong <br/>
arts community here in Pensacola.  I&#39;m staying thank you. At least for now...<br/>

<br/>
Yes, it is definitely more liberal than any of the areas nearby. That&#39;s why <br/>
I&#39;m really glad we live in town now. There are about eight art galleries in a <br/>
three block area, that tells you what is important here!!  If a town has a <br/>
strong arts community, it can&#39;t be that bad :)<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s true--racist comments and attitudes are more common than you&#39;d <br/>
think.  But the poeple who don&#39;t make the comments and don&#39;t have the <br/>
attitudes have to be careful about who they piss off, too.  After all, <br/>
we have to live by our neighbors and work for our boss, you know?  I <br/>
know it&#39;s horrible and bad not to stand up against it.  You just can&#39;t <br/>
do that kind of thing every day.  You&#39;d never get anything done.  <br/>
<br/>
Memphis, where I live, is a majority black city.  Dr. King was <br/>
assassinated here.  The ripples of that event are still present in many <br/>
ways.  Willie Herenton was the first black mayor of the city, 10 years <br/>
ago.  He has armed guards around him day and night.  Shelby County, <br/>
which is the outskirts of Memphis, is mostly white.  In the last <br/>
election, white Shelby County elected its first black mayor.  The <br/>
previous Shelby County mayors didn&#39;t have any armed guards the whole <br/>
time he was mayor.  No need. The new black mayor is hiring some today, <br/>
because yesterday, someone threw a bomb-like device through the window <br/>
of his home.<br/>
<br/>
As a taxpayer here, I don&#39;t begrudge his armed guards a bit.  <br/>
