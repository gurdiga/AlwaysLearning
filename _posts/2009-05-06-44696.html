<div id="ygrps-yiv-623283720">I just signed up on the list not too long ago. I have to say that I am amazed at the change in my family over these past two weeks. Nakiah&#39;s language has exploded. She&#39;s asking more and more questions and I feel so much closer to her. I have always had a hard time connecting with her since birth. As she grew older I started to see her as I thought she should be, not for who she is.<br/>
<br/>
We always thought we were engaging the girls, and we were, but not in this way. We&#39;ve always been relaxed about food and bedtimes. We eat at the table sometimes, and sometimes we all sit in front of the TV. To us it&#39;s about being with the family not so much where.<br/>
We have a routine we do at bedtime, bath, books and then the girls would go to sleep. <br/>
Over the past two weeks I&#39;ve noticed they come to us and tell us when they are ready for bath and bed, lol<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been saying yes more and it actually feels good! <br/>
There are tough times too. I know it&#39;s only the beginning. I&#39;m hard on myself and have a habit of comparing myself to others. I appreciate the discussion on that.<br/>
Nakiah asked to go to school last week. I posted about it on the Radical Network and appreciate all of the responses I&#39;ve received on that topic.<br/>
She says she&#39;s having fun at home and she likes me being the teacher.<br/>
I never told her I was the teacher. <br/>
<br/>
My dad told me last night(he lives with us) that he has noticed a change in the household and especially the girls. He&#39;s impressed and told me that if he had known of this option when me and my brother were in school, he would&#39;ve pulled us out and done it.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to watching our life unfold.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
That is so common.  I&#39;m not sure when it happens, but so many parents<br/>
stop really SEEing their kids for who they are.  These little people<br/>
right before their eyes, become something else, viewed through tainted<br/>
glasses.  Isn&#39;t it great to take those glasses off?!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; We always thought we were engaging the girls, and we were, but not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>in this way. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There are many levels of engagement with children.  It changes<br/>
everything when you start engaging as their partner in life.  You start<br/>
seeing things differently.  The whole dynamic changes.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt; We&#39;ve been saying yes more and it actually feels good! &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those are affirmations!  &quot;Yes&quot;, is such a positive thing.  It really<br/>
does feel good, and the more you do it, the better it feels, and pretty<br/>
soon your life is filled up with happy affirming thoughts and actions so<br/>
that when as you say here...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

the discussion on that.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those things become easier and easier to deal with.  There will always<br/>
be tough times and times of doubt.  That is part of life.  If your life<br/>
is built up on happy thoughts and attitudes, dealing with those times,<br/>
are so much easier.<br/>
<br/>
Our family had a pretty tough night last night.  The easy part was<br/>
getting along and loving on each other.  It made our focus be totally on<br/>
the problem at hand, not at finding fault or blame shifting.  It made<br/>
all the difference in the world.  If we didn&#39;t have this kind of<br/>
relationship with our kids, it would have gone very differently last<br/>
night and the stress would have been so much more!</div>

<br/>
That&#39;s another great post that I hadn&#39;t commented on.<br/>
<br/>
Happy changes are good, but I don&#39;t think they can come without  <br/>
comparisons.<br/>
Maybe comparison without action is the problem, not comparison itself.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching Marty&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s reaction to situations.  She  <br/>
pulls in and starts to recite the ways she was wronged or slighted  <br/>
rather than stretching out and being different.   We&#39;ve talked about  <br/>
how poisonous cynicism and pessimism can be.  She said she wants to be  <br/>
happier, and then compares herself to Marty, pulls in and starts to  <br/>
blame other people and things for her unhappiness.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the solution is for her to stop seeing that other people  <br/>
are happy so that her unhappiness looks better.<br/>

Thanks for this.  It&#39;s been a rough few weeks in some ways and this  <br/>
was great to read again.<br/>

It really is great. Everyone needs to take their glasses off. It seems in this day and age people view their children as accessories to their life.The next fashion trend. And when they aren&#39;t turning out the way we want them to, we get upset.<br/>
I&#39;m not going to go off and blame my mom for everything, but we do model what we see growing up.<br/>
My mom never saw me for who I am, she still doesn&#39;t.<br/>
I realized I was doing the same thing with my daughter and I decided to break that cycle. I don&#39;t like the way I&#39;ve reacted to something, *I* can change it.<br/>
I&#39;m really enjoying my new relationship with my daughter. It means the world to me.<br/>

That&#39;s great, Darcel.  I did a lot of blaming and trying to zero in on <br/>
exactly what went wrong and grieving.  That simple statement &quot;my mom <br/>
never saw me for who I am&quot; and &quot;she still doesn&#39;t&quot; is a lot easier than <br/>
all that other.<br/>

with my daughter. It means the world to me. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It has taken me little time to change once I began to because it&#39;s the <br/>
decision of a moment and over time I become (or change into) someone <br/>
who naturally behaves differently.  The enjoyment of the relationship <br/>
is what motivates me to make better choices and grow toward change one <br/>
decision at a time.  I love how loving Karl and I are together.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t have that with my mom and for me it&#39;s very healing to have that <br/>
with Karl.<br/>
<br/>
Beautiful, Darcel.  Thanks so much for your post.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is really interesting to me because of recent events at our house<br/>
and recent email dialog between me and another mother.<br/>
<br/>
Here is an excerpt from an email I sent to this mother.  Chamille and I<br/>
both wrote her without knowing that each of us wrote to her and we both<br/>
said similar things but in very different ways...<br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t think either one of us has said in any way, shape, or form,<br/>
that you do not love your daughter and that you don&#39;t appreciate her, or<br/>
even know her like a mother.  What both of us are saying is that you are<br/>
not seeing her for the person she is without other things getting in the<br/>
way of that.  My own mother behaved in much the same way.  I get along<br/>
with her now, but it took many years to get over what she did to me,<br/>
which is, in so many ways, the same thing you are doing to your own<br/>
daughter.  It&#39;s not a healthy way to build a relationship.  Even at the<br/>
age I am now, there are things that I do not talk about with my mother,<br/>
there will always be a gaurd up about certain things, because of<br/>
judgements and expectations.  Those things never changed, I had to<br/>
change to be able to talk with my mother and it took many years and much<br/>
heartbreak to be able to do it.   You don&#39;t have to do that with your<br/>
own daughter.  You don&#39;t have to go down that path.  You have this<br/>
beautiful opportunity to do it differently RIGHT NOW!  You say you are<br/>
doing everything you can to help your daughter, so here are answers,<br/>
freely given.  You may not want them, but I&#39;m giving them anyway because<br/>
I know without a doubt that you can change this dynamic with your<br/>
daughter and have the same amazing relationship that I have with my own<br/>
daughter.  Change is never easy, you have to be motivated.  What better<br/>
motivation can you have than your own child?  A mother&#39;s love can<br/>
motivate huge change.&quot;   To me, this is a large part of why I am<br/>
choosing to parent the way I parent!  I want something better than what<br/>
I had with my own mother.  I SEE that it is different already and my<br/>
daughter is only 15.  We have a great relationship and it&#39;s because of<br/>
the things that I&#39;ve learned through unschooling and because of the<br/>
changes that I&#39;ve made in how I choose to communicate with and the way I<br/>
SEE my children!   I really like this on Joyce&#39;s site...<br/>
