<div id="ygrps-yiv-100892438"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;wondered about...how teachers can grade art. I mean,<br/>
&gt;is there a right and wrong to art? And isn&#39;t art as<br/>
&gt;subjective as anything could be? How do they<br/>
&gt;do that? Why do they do that? Sheesh...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s my understanding that when they &quot;teach art&quot; what<br/>
they are actually teaching is art appeciation, art<br/>
history, or basic theories like shading, perspective<br/>
and color spectrums/wheels/charts.  I recall that when<br/>
I got graded on art in middle school/Jr. High it had<br/>
to do with how well I followed the intsructions or<br/>
demonstrated proper shading, etc. techniques,<br/>
according to the teacher&#39;s interpretation of course. <br/>
They also sometimes grade for &quot;effort&quot;  so if you<br/>
spent a lot of time and poured a lot of energy into a<br/>
piece they give you these sort of kudos-pitty grades<br/>
just for trying.  I believe everyone has &quot;artistic&quot;<br/>
talent but it&#39;s certainly not always in the areas that<br/>
schools demand that you express it (drawing, paint and<br/>
clay usually) but may be in woodworking, cooking,<br/>
quilting, singing, photography, interior decorating,<br/>
asthetic gardening or landscape design, etc. and so<br/>
on.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I took a couple of college art classes a couple of years ago. There was <br/>
a syllabus with very specific details on what you had to do to earn <br/>
each different grade. It included a specified amount of production of <br/>
various types of work, an essay, attendance at an art show or museum, <br/>
and a written exam on specific techniques, vocabulary, and supplies.<br/>
<br/>
The grade didn&#39;t depend on how the teacher evaluated the art work OTHER <br/>
than that she determined if a piece entailed a reasonable attempt to <br/>
use a particular technique. This was a course that people could repeat <br/>
multiple times and then take intermediate and advanced versions. She <br/>
wasn&#39;t in a hurry for students to produce great works of art - just <br/>
focused on them gaining basic technical skill and understanding of <br/>
different styles and she supported them in developing enough courage to <br/>
take risks and let the art emerge from that. She discussed people&#39;s art <br/>
with them - pointed out what she saw that seemed effective and asked <br/>
them to evaluate their own work (not give a grade - just talk about it <br/>
- what were they trying to do, how did that work out, what else might <br/>
they try, stuff like that). She was a wonderful teacher with fantastic <br/>
skill at knowing when to step in and make a suggestion, when to help <br/>
someone with a technique and when to leave them alone to work on it, <br/>
and was very inspiring and especially incredibly respectful of each <br/>
person&#39;s individuality.<br/>
<br/>
Even though students register at different levels, all levels were in <br/>
one place at the same time - more advanced students were expected to <br/>
help beginners some of the time. It was a very wonderful alive kind of <br/>
place where you could learn your own way - by watching, by trial and <br/>
error, by asking questions, by reading about it, watching videos, and <br/>
on and on. She retired and I haven&#39;t had the heart to take another <br/>
class because I&#39;d miss her so much.<br/>
