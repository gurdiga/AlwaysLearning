 </span></blockquote>I think even amongst unschoolers, some things are okay and some are  <br/>
less so.<br/>
<br/>
If my daughter had wanted to color on the walls, I would have found  <br/>
ways to facilitate it: putting up huge swaths of paper, painting the  <br/>
walls myself with special paint just for writing on (like blackboard  <br/>
or white board paint), designating a wall just for her artwork, asking  <br/>
her to write on the fence before I painted it, giving her chalk for  <br/>
the sidewalk or window crayons that can be wiped off. There are always  <br/>
ways to support our kids&#39; exploration without encouraging what could  <br/>
become destruction. It often isn&#39;t a wall a child needs to color on  <br/>
either! It&#39;s a big space they need. Finding options is how we help them.<br/>
<br/>
I would be okay with my kid smearing a popsicle all over herself, but  <br/>
there&#39;s a time and a place. In the backyard with a kiddie pool or  <br/>
sprinkler, where *all* the kids can strip down or wear their swimsuits  <br/>
is a good place. Maybe in the bathtub, for fun. Not in a mall, or at a  <br/>
park day where there a plenty of people *not* okay with that.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t &quot;anything goes, anywhere, anytime.&quot; It&#39;s helping our  <br/>
kids navigate the world they live in *and* providing opportunities to  <br/>
explore in appropriate and meaningful ways.<br/>
