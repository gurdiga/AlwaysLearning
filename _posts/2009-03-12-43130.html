<div id="ygrps-yiv-39222667">Hi my name is Jen and I am in the process of preparing to homeschool my daughter next year, she would be in 2nd grade.  Through my research I have learned about the unschooling approach and feel that it would work well for us.  I have already implemented some unschooling techniques and have seen a dramatic change in my daughter&#39;s behavior,confidence and desire to learn.  I am pretty excited about learning along side her.  My question is how do you contain and structure the learning to make it meaningful and long lasting.  It seems we start on one subject or project and then it spins off to learning something else, then we start another topic etc, etc.  It seems like the power of unsturctured learning is a little too much.  I&#39;d hate for us to waste time and not learn things in depth.  Any advice or suggestion would be helpful.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re asking an oft-asked question, but in a whole new and better way!!<br/>
<br/>
#1, don&#39;t wait until next year.<br/>
If she&#39;s in school, go and get her and bring her home.  Or give her  <br/>
the option to stay home tomorrow, if she wants to, and every day after.<br/>
<br/>
#2, Don&#39;t contain excitement.  WHY?  If learning is hoppin&#39; then let  <br/>
it hop!!<br/>
<br/>
-=-My question is how do you contain and structure the learning to  <br/>
make it meaningful and long lasting.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you contain it and structure it, you will forfeit meaning and  <br/>
longevity.  There is practice learning and play learning, and then  <br/>
there is real learning.  School is about practice learning and  <br/>
busywork.  Unschooling is about real learning, and real life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It seems we start on one subject or project and then it spins off  <br/>
to learning something else, then we start another topic etc, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you think of it as the unit of everything in the whole wide world  <br/>
(past, present, future, real or imagined), you can&#39;t move to another  <br/>
topic.  It&#39;s all related.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;d hate for us to waste time and not learn things in depth.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Learning isn&#39;t a waste of time.<br/>
The more little things you know, the more hooks you have to hang the  <br/>
next things that come by.<br/>

  Hi my name is Jen and I am in the process of preparing to homeschool my daughter next year, she would be in 2nd grade. Through my research I have learned about the unschooling approach and feel that it would work well for us. I have already implemented some unschooling techniques and have seen a dramatic change in my daughter&#39;s behavior,confidence and desire to learn. I am pretty excited about learning along side her. My question is how do you contain and structure the learning to make it meaningful and long lasting. It seems we start on one subject or project and then it spins off to learning something else, then we start another topic etc, etc. It seems like the power of unsturctured learning is a little too much. I&#39;d hate for us to waste time and not learn things in depth. Any advice or suggestion would be helpful.<br/>
