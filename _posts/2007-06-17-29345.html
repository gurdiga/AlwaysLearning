<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489521944">-=-To me I assumed this meant you did not want this discussion on  <br/>
your list.-=<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t want it privately either.<br/>
<br/>
The analogy I have in mind about people who send private e-mail is this:<br/>
This meeting is private.  Anyone&#39;s welcome to come.  They can even  <br/>
come up and take the mic and speak.  But if the speeches aren&#39;t in  <br/>
keeping with the purpose of the meeting, the mic might be taken away  <br/>
from them early, or they&#39;ll be asked to listen for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Speeches are to be supportive of the principles of unschooling, not  <br/>
just be about anything in the whole wide world.  It&#39;s an unschooling  <br/>
meeting.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t like the way the meeting went, they can just not  <br/>
come back next week (as it were).  They should NOT follow someone  <br/>
home and accost her on her own front porch, which is what it can feel  <br/>
like when someone who made a public speech/post is then addressed  <br/>
privately and critically about it.<br/>
<br/>
Stay in the light of the whole list, and if a listowner asks you not  <br/>
to discuss something, it&#39;s not a negotiable point.  It&#39;s a request  <br/>
for you to let the mic go to those who are speaking from an  <br/>
unschooling point of view.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need to provide a forum for people to say unschooling sucks,  <br/>
that we&#39;re wrong and that nothing we do is any better than whatever  <br/>
any other family chooses to do.    There&#39;s no benefit to anyone to  <br/>
bring other messages here.  It won&#39;t help them understand unschooling  <br/>
and it won&#39;t help those many other dozens or hundreds who are just  <br/>
reading and not writing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1633246150">-=-Again though, I have to do what I feel is best for my son and my  <br/>
family and<br/>
I would hope that the people on a group like this would be respectful of<br/>
that fact.-=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Respectful&quot; meaning accepting of all choices as equally valid?<br/>

<br/>
If the priority in one&#39;s life or in a discussion is unschooling, then  <br/>
suggestions that lead toward unschooling are superior (for purposes  <br/>
of that discussion or in that family) to suggestions and decisions  <br/>
that will hamper unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I signed up for this group hoping that the folks weren&#39;t so<br/>
judgmental as the bible beaters I usually run into on the local groups<br/>
around us so I could speak a little more freely - guess that isn&#39;t the<br/>
case.&quot;<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
You DID speak freely, and the posts were allowed through to the list.<br/>
If you want to express yourself and be praised instead of questioned,  <br/>
then you need to figure out what a particular group considers  <br/>
praiseworthy and express that, or at least don&#39;t express what they  <br/>
will question.<br/>
<br/>
If you got to a vegetarian workshop and say you don&#39;t see any problem  <br/>
with hotdogs, don&#39;t be surprised if they tell you the problems they see.<br/>
If you go to a Harley enthusiasts&#39; rally and say you think there&#39;s no  <br/>
real difference between a Kawasaki and a Harley, they will probably  <br/>
disagree with you.<br/>
<br/>
Comparing us to &quot;bible beaters&quot; (and PLEASE, the term is &quot;Bible  <br/>
thumpers&quot;--get it straight) isn&#39;t helpful at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353839675">For me this meant people who either quoted the bible at me as being <br/>
the doctrine by which I ought to be living or would use chapter and <br/>
verse to let me know that as a Metaphysical Practitioner I was going <br/>
to hell if I didn&#39;t follow their belief systems.  Either way I think <br/>
it&#39;s funny because I&#39;m not attached to the opinions of someone that <br/>
quotes the bible at me as it&#39;s not the book I use to base my beliefs <br/>
upon.<br/>
<br/>
I had an incident about 10 years ago with a woman(born again <br/>
Christian - she told me this) in a 2nd hand book store spending over <br/>
1 hour (closer to 2 actually) trying to convince me that I was going <br/>
to hell because I am an astrologer.  <br/>
<br/>
I listened very patiently to what she had to say and I kept on <br/>
saying to her &quot;I absolutely believe that you believe what you are <br/>
saying.  However I don&#39;t believe the same as you&quot;... I really meant <br/>
it that I had respect for her belief systems, they were just not the <br/>
same as mine and for me mine work for me and hers worked for her.  <br/>
<br/>
Eventually she became exhausted and gave up on trying to convert me <br/>
and see things her way.  I loved listening to her read me biblical <br/>
passages, trying to change my belief systems and I realized not long <br/>
after it would belike someone trying to convince me that sending my <br/>
child to a boarding school in New Zealand (no offense to New <br/>
Zealanders, it&#39;s just far away from Tucson, AZ), wearing a uniform <br/>
would be a great thing.  (Zak was about 3 at the time and I&#39;d <br/>
discovered unschooling, much to the chagrin of everyone around me at <br/>
that time).<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s wonderful that life is made up of people who are <br/>
seriously committed to their own beliefs.  When I am clear on what <br/>
mine are I am not affected by others&#39; beliefs.  When I am unsure of <br/>
what I believe is when I notice that I really want to listen to what <br/>
others are saying to see if I can gain clarity on my own belief <br/>
systems.<br/>
<br/>
This unschooling thingy is a process for me that reveals itself to <br/>
me everyday.  Mostly for me it&#39;s about deschooling myself (and <br/>
hubby).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that is often what is happening when people come to this list and <br/>
other lists and get very offended by people&#39;s experiences, and responses to <br/>
the things that they are sure are true, like letting a 4 year old watch <br/>
television will lead to a 25 year old axe murderer or children given a wide <br/>
range of food choices will always choose sugar and starches and e-numbers, <br/>
or something like that. I&#39;m not terribly vocal about what challenges me in <br/>
my household. I&#39;m ever so afraid of getting it wrong, but I watch and I read <br/>
and I listen. And it all helps so much. So that when something similar, or <br/>
something comes up, instead of going to that fearful place where I say &quot;no&quot; <br/>
or I say &quot;I don&#39;t think you should&quot; I can think it through with other <br/>
people&#39;s stories and experiences in my head. And really examine what my <br/>
fears are based on.<br/>
<br/>
Today Simon bought a couple of packs of Yu-gi-oh cards on ebay. He was very <br/>
excited by his purchase. I thought he&#39;d put it on the watch list, which is <br/>
what he usually does with things he wants me or David to get for him from <br/>
ebay. But I got an e-mail requesting payment and I got nervous about him <br/>
buying things willy nilly. Which is silly, Simon is incredible sensible with <br/>
his money and with what he wants to buy, and even if he weren&#39;t, it is not <br/>
as if I couldn&#39;t respond after the fact. But, when I asked him the details <br/>
of the transaction, he knew the shipping costs and the sale costs. I then <br/>
showed him the couple of things I look for in an ebay transaction, the <br/>
buyer&#39;s feedback profile and if VAT is added. It wasn&#39;t anything scary, but <br/>
I have a vague sense that money is something that needs to be very <br/>
controlled. Which means that it is an irrational control issue that I need <br/>
to examine and take back to a rational response.---In an addendum (within <br/>
text) Simon is currently interested in buying a Duel Disk and I asked him <br/>
what he was willing to pay for it. He said that he was willing to go up to <br/>
14 pounds because there was a buy it now one for 14 pounds. See, my fears <br/>
were completly absurd.<br/>
<br/>
Recently Sandra posted Mary Gold&#39;s statement &quot;It isn&#39;t the unschooling it&#39;s <br/>
the life&quot; and I&#39;ve been hearing those words echo in my head. Today I got <br/>
hungry, which meant that I needed to quickly grab something. I don&#39;t often <br/>
let hunger sneak up on me, but I was busy with Simon and Linnaea and looking <br/>
up words beginning with le in the dictionary so that Linnaea could make her <br/>
super neutral (neither good nor evil) name that began with le (she decided <br/>
on Lynx). And as the hunger overwhelmed my mood they were dealing with the <br/>
fact that there was only one egg but they both wanted to make french toast, <br/>
Simon wanted to use cow milk and Linnaea wanted to use soy. And I wanted to <br/>
not have to deal with this right now! But instead I grabbed a roll and <br/>
shoved it in my mouth, suggested that they could scramble the egg and then <br/>
divide it in half and then add their milk of choice. It also helps me to <br/>
hear those words when they are unhappy. That maybe they would feel better if <br/>
they had food, or sleep, or a drink, or the computer that they are craving <br/>
now or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
So, I think it is very easy to believe that a challenge is an assualt, but <br/>
it is much more helpful, to you and yours, to see a challenge as something <br/>
to be honestly examined, to be open to as it may change the way you live and <br/>
love with those you love.<br/>

<br/>
It isn&#39;t the unschooling, it&#39;s life.<br/>
<br/>
(Right?  I think that&#39;s Mary&#39;s recommended saying...)<br/>
<br/>
To clarify, the person who wrote was complaining about the discussion  <br/>
of Bible thumpers or beaters, and that&#39;s the post I didn&#39;t let  <br/>
through, though I did write to her directly and immediately, so she  <br/>
had feedback.  But she was angry that she couldn&#39;t say just whatever  <br/>
on earth she wanted to, to the whole list.  We don&#39;t have to give  <br/>
just anyone the microphone here, and when people abuse it I put them  <br/>
back on moderation where all new members start by default.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s unreasonable.  If anyone DOES think it&#39;s  <br/>
unreasonable, she&#39;s free to make a yahoolist and set it up absolutely  <br/>
unmoderated and go for it!    You can announce it here and invite the  <br/>
members of this list over.  If you allow just anyone to join  <br/>
automatically and post, what you will end up with is a bunch of posts  <br/>
advertising nonsense, degrees online, and sex links, and kinda crazy  <br/>
chain letter stuff about aliens in Pennsylvania or that public  <br/>
television wants everyone to sign this petition RIGHT NOW, or that if  <br/>
everyone doesn&#39;t write to the U.S. government that e-mails are about  <br/>
to cost a nickel apiece and then the people in other countries wonder  <br/>
what the heck is a  nickel and why on earth should they give a rat&#39;s  <br/>
ass.  Oh.  And then people drop off the list because it has just  <br/>
become another way for junk mail to get into their mailboxes.<br/>
<br/>
I have many, many years of experience now with online communications  <br/>
in list style and forum/message board, and a couple of years of blog  <br/>
experience now (my own for a year and a half and reading others for  <br/>
longer), and some with MySpace.   Comments are often too soon, too  <br/>
thoughtless, unaware of circumstances and history.  Often it&#39;s kinder  <br/>
to shield a person from being exposed as hasty, thoughtless and  <br/>
unaware than to give them the podium.<br/>
<br/>
If there is a side discussion (they always peter out after a bit) and  <br/>
people are saying &quot;oh?&quot;  &quot;Yeah&quot;   &quot;I don&#39;t think so&quot;  &quot;Yeah, it is.&quot;   <br/>
then what never does  help is for someone new to the list to add &quot;All  <br/>
of you stop talking about that because I wish you were talking about  <br/>
something else; you and the list suck.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When anyone wishes the list was about kids instead of some other  <br/>
topic it has wondered into, the thing to do is to post about your kids.<br/>
If you wish the list was more about reading, write about reading.<br/>
If you wish the list was discussing ANYthing that&#39;s not even ore off  <br/>
topic than whatever&#39;s bugging you, post that on-topic thing and  <br/>
others will respond.<br/>

&gt; unschooling it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; the life&quot; and I&#39;ve been hearing those words echo in my head-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It isn&#39;t the unschooling, it&#39;s life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (Right?  I think that&#39;s Mary&#39;s recommended saying...) </span></blockquote></div>
