Sandra, when say &quot;more strongly&quot;, what do you mean? I have a tantrum King. <br/>
Riley my 5 year old. We have talked about TV and my son and about sibling <br/>
issues. When trying to react less strongly, are you saying with lots of <br/>
hugs, patience, calm.? Ive been trying to contain my own anger/frustration <br/>
with this passionate guy.<br/>
<br/>
Got to go, the children of my friend just arrived, now there are 7 of us <br/>
here. It is a sunny, cold day here in Davis, Ca.<br/>

<br/>
If I had made a bigger deal about it, TOLD him he was the tantrum king, <br/>
defined him as a guy who throws tantrums, punished him, shamed him (more than <br/>
I did in the course of things), etc., I think he would be more resentful now, <br/>
and the tantrums might have been worse from frustration at the time.<br/>
<br/>
We certainly didn&#39;t ignore him, but we tried to deal with the underlying <br/>
situations rather than his response, and when we did talk about his responses <br/>
discussed how he could control his temper.<br/>
<br/>
-=- When trying to react less strongly, are you saying with lots of <br/>

<br/>
Words, reason, encouragement to be controlled and make situations better.<br/>
Defending the other kids from him, being patient with him growing up and into <br/>
his better manhood.<br/>
