<div id="ygrps-yiv-539203535">Skepticism gets a bad reputation ;-) It gets equated<br/>
with being closed<br/>
minded.<br/>
<br/>
***Believe me, being open-minded and positive gets a<br/>
bad rep too!  (I can&#39;t tell you the number of times<br/>
I&#39;ve been called naive :-) ) (Not that I&#39;m at all<br/>
calling you closed-minded, I&#39;m just saying that people<br/>
will probably criticize no matter which way you<br/>
approach things.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;m not going to quote the rest of your e-mail,<br/>
but I think we are actually pretty much on the same<br/>
page... I&#39;m not suggesting any sort of blind faith in<br/>
things that are completely unproven... just that we<br/>
trust our insticts and if there are ideas out there<br/>
that really hit home with us on an instinctual level<br/>
then we shouldn&#39;t be afraid to trust that. (Whether we<br/>
can prove them &#39;rationally&#39; or not.) <br/>
<br/>
Love, Tori<br/>
