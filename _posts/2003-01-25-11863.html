<br/>
I just was notified that I&#39;m listed on the webpage for this coming-soon <br/>
convention.   Here are the listed speakers:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SIGMUND BROUWER IS A RENOWNED AUTHOR OF OVER 50 BOOKS. HIS BOOKS ARE ON OVER <br/>
2,000,000 BOOKSHELVES. He is a sought after speaker in home based education <br/>
circles as a well as being a very popular informational and motivational <br/>
speaker in public circles in the US and Canada. We want to thank Sigmund for <br/>
giving us a special rate that has allowed us to bring him in on our limited <br/>
convention budget.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd is a popular speaker in the US at home based education functions. <br/>
She looks forward to her first time to talk with Saskatchewan home based <br/>
educators. Sandra Dodd taught English for 6 years in New Mexico, before they <br/>
choose to home educate their family. None of her children have attended <br/>
public school. She has mastered the art of educating without rigid structure. <br/>
<br/>
Cheryl Garrett IS COMING AS A FEATURE SPEAKER. There have been so many <br/>
requests for her that we have chosen to invite her for 2003 convention. She <br/>
specializes in classical education and organizing your home based education.<br/>
<br/>
HSLDA has been invited by popular request also. It is unfortunate that Dallas <br/>
Miller cannot atttend, but he had assured us the someone from the <br/>
organization will come to give us some of the update on home based education <br/>
situat can seriously effect our lives and the education of our children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
----------------<br/>
<br/>
Scary,  huh?<br/>
<br/>
I hope it turns out well.<br/>
<br/>
The bio I sent was this:<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd has three children who have never been to school, and who have <br/>
never had school at home.  She and her husband, Keith, an engineer, live in <br/>
Albuquerque, New Mexico, with Kirby (16), Marty (14) and Holly (11) and often <br/>
have other teens and children in the house as well, many of them also <br/>
unschoolers or homeschoolers.    Sandra grew up in northern New Mexico.  <br/>
After studying English and Psychology at the University of New Mexico, she <br/>
taught &quot;Language Arts&quot; and writing to young teens in her hometown of Espa√±ola <br/>
for several years.     Sandra is the unschooling columnist for Home Education <br/>
Magazine, is active at their www.unschooling.com forum, and has an <br/>
evergrowing website, <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://SandraDodd.com/unschooling">http://SandraDodd.com/unschooling</a> to which she invites <br/>
you even if you can&#39;t make it to her talks at this conference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No mention of the magazine the website...<br/>
I never would have used the numeral &quot;6&quot; in text! <br/>
And I didn&#39;t quit teaching to homeschool.  I had quit teaching years before I <br/>
was ever even pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not idea.<br/>
<br/>
AND I&#39;m not invited to speak in Sacramento at the HSC conference.  Rather I&#39;m <br/>
invited to be on panels of my choosing, if I get there on my own and pay for <br/>
my own room.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe next year, on that one.  Holly&#39;s disappointed.<br/>
<br/>
