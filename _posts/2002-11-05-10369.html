It will be warm in the winter then. We have a whole different climate up here <br/>
near AL.<br/>
But not nearly as good of sightseeing although our beaches are a lot better <br/>
(or so I hear). <br/>

I&#39;m not a beach person unless its rocky with dramatic cliffs. My <br/>
idea of hell is sitting on a  hot sandy beach.<br/>
I imagine the beaches of Maine are more &#39;me&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
What I would like is unlimited money and time to visit everything in <br/>
the US - like Bill Bryson did in &#39;The Lost Continent&#39;<br/>
I&#39;d drive and stop wherever fancy took me. Unfortunately, in a small <br/>
car with 3 children saying &#39;Are we there yet&#39; whose longest drive <br/>
experience has been 5 hours this just ain&#39;t gonna happen.<br/>
The US is just tooooooooooo big so we get to see &#39;tourist&#39; places <br/>
cos thats easy to plan.<br/>
We were thinking of driving to the GC. I think its about 2400 miles <br/>
from here. Having found the 5 hour, 260 mile jaunt to NYC a never <br/>
to be repeated experience we are just gonna have to fly.<br/>
We will be driving to FL however. 800 miles will be a 3 day <br/>
marathon for me. Gonna have to drug the children. DH wont drive <br/>
the minivan and he wont drive on roads he&#39;s never been on <br/>
before....so its all up to me :-(<br/>
<br/>
Is Universal Studios as hideous as I think its going to be?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually, when we went nearly two years ago, I liked Universal better than<br/>
the Disney stuff. It helped immensely that we went in January and there were<br/>
no crowds. The longest we had to wait for a ride was maybe 20 minutes; the<br/>
rest we just went straight on the ride. Islands of Adventure (you can get a<br/>
ticket that covers both it and Universal) had the best rides and a<br/>
Seuss-ville that was magical.<br/>
<br/>
You do have to see it through your kids&#39; eyes. I grew up thinking a trip to<br/>
Six Flags was just the best thing there was, and even now I get a little<br/>
thrill walking through the front gate although I&#39;m also aware of the<br/>
tackiness and expense and smell and noise.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I wouldn&#39;t do again is take a 4 yr old on the Jaws ride...!<br/>

The Blue Angels are the Navy&#39;s flying team. Very noisy, but oh so fun to <br/>
watch.<br/>
The kids dig it...<br/>
And our beaches are anything but rocky and dramatic, but you knew that!!<br/>
They aren&#39;t hot anymore either,  I won&#39;t even swim in the water, but some do.<br/>
It&#39;s a very loooong stretch of extremely white sand and turquoise water. <br/>
Dolphins swim by frequently and you can often catch sight of manta <br/>
rays...lets not talk about those sharks.  :)<br/>
It&#39;s the kind of beach you swim at, if you don&#39;t like swimming and you don&#39;t <br/>
like sunshine, it&#39;s not gonna be much fun.<br/>
I do think you would be a great candidate for living in the Portland area <br/>
(Oregon).<br/>
Drizzly grey skies most of the time, liberal city and more dramatic beaches <br/>
just two hours away.<br/>

forth across the US a couple of times and had a blast. That&#39;s something we<br/>
really miss here as we can&#39;t do long road trips (just won&#39;t go to Saudi:)<br/>
My kids all pack a backpack for the trip and get new books, markers, tapes<br/>
etc. We buy fun food and get a stack of story tapes (we all really love the<br/>
ones by Patrick McManus and even Monty Python for older &quot;kids&quot;). We get<br/>
excited looking on the map and even stops at Burger King (always with play<br/>
areas when they were little) were fun because it was new.<br/>
I&#39;ve just found it&#39;s a great way for us all to connect and talk and just<br/>
&quot;be&quot; with each other. Although I have to say I haven&#39;t made a trip yet<br/>
since the oldest has hit 15-year-old hormones!! After this evening I&#39;m not<br/>
sure I could be in a car for 5 minutes #%$^^%&<br/>

Disney. It&#39;s older and more trees and just seems calmer.<br/>

(aspergers) and myself will sit and watch. He went to Universal <br/>
Studios by himself a couple of years ago when he was in the US <br/>
on a conference and loved it.<br/>
My gripe is the sheer cost. It makes you feel hard done by if the <br/>
kids want to go home after a couple of hours. This is when DH gets <br/>
cross and insists we *will* have fun ALL day.<br/>
We took them to the Natural History Museum in London back <br/>
when it wasn&#39;t free. What with the rail fare to London and the tube <br/>
plus the entry price we didn&#39;t get any change out of £100. The kids <br/>
looked at the dinosaurs (which are superb, especially the <br/>
animatronic ones) for half an hour then wanted to leave.....<br/>
DH went nuts and insisted we saw every single stuffed animal and <br/>
piece of rock. That day lives on in my memory ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, DH is looking up flights today and the cheapest ones are <br/>
round trip to Vegas so we might be doing that, seeing the GC, <br/>
petrified forest (what scared it.....?) and the meteor crater. Given <br/>
the miles involved I imagine thats all we&#39;ll have time for in a week <br/>
then back to Vegas for the flight home. Now he&#39;s decided I can on <br/>
with worrying about flying :-(<br/>

We drove 600 miles to Niagara in 2 days and me n DD did the 5 <br/>
hours to NYC.<br/>
After 200 miles I desperately wish it would end, especially the NY <br/>
turnpike which is 100 miles of tedium. trees line the road either <br/>
side so there&#39;s nothing to look at.<br/>
I do know now that I will never bitch about journeys in the UK <br/>
again. I used to dread the 100 miles to my mums house and would <br/>
have nightmares about it. Americans would drive that far for a good <br/>
pizza :-)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah but that&#39;s because 100 miles in the UK can take 5 hours if they are<br/>
