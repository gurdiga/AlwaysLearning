<div id="ygrps-yiv-1319039477">I thought it was a report of typically how schools teach.  They are so limited my beurocratic BS and daily rigamarole has NOTHING to do with the students.  I live in Simsbury CT where the schools are number 1 in the country.  It took me 8 years to finally open my eyes and see that my kids and others were (are) paying too high a price to be those scores and statistics.   They have nothing to do with how much the kids learn, weather or not the kids are happy, well adjusted human beings (they dont care about that).  The schools and their uppers only care about wether or not they have the scores and they look good.  Screw the kids.<br/>
<br/>
A tad over emotional??  Sorry about that.  Not enough distance yet. <br/>
