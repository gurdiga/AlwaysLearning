<div id="ygrps-yiv-1796667251">I recently listened to this interview with Quinn Eaker (Barb Lundgren&#39;s adult son) & am very bothered by his comments about trusting in a child&#39;s capability in their explorations.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the link (I believe this is about an hour long): <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.co-creatornetwork.com/guests/Eaker_Quinn/_bio.htm">http://www.co-creatornetwork.com/guests/Eaker_Quinn/_bio.htm</a><br/>
<br/>
What I am upset by is his (& apparently Barb&#39;s) comments on &quot;trusting&quot; in children&#39;s &quot;capibility&quot;. Even in times where the child (in their most precious natural curiosity) is clearly in a potentially dangerous situation. Quinn&#39;s examples are in the clip above but one of them is how he was on a horizontal tree that hung out over the Grand Canyon where there was a 100 foot drop. His mom decided (while in utter fear) to walk away, let him be & trusted in his capability as he himself what he was capable of. <br/>
<br/>
I do not agree with this. He was a young boy, not an adult. I feel a parent&#39;s &#39;role&#39; (Don&#39;t get me wrong. I do not mean that in a superior sense.) is to protect our children from a  potential life threatening situation. To me, this &quot;trust&quot; that many Unschoolers believe in in regards to these kinds of situations (where the child is young and/or does not know how  to swim yet or whatever-to not be within arms reach or below to catch them or something as they climb a tree more than say 20 feet...) is pure negligence & just downright foolishness. <br/>
<br/>
I know of a mom who said she &quot;trusts&quot; her 22 month old daughter (who does NOT know how to swim) who was sitting on a ledge (beside the sidewalk in a park) to not fall into the river below. there was at least a 2.5 foot drop to the water line & the water was at least 2 feet deep with large stones at the bottom. This little girl did not have a life jacket or floaties on. I myself would NEVER allow my child or any child in my care who doesn&#39;t know how to swim to do such a thing. And I would not leave my child, &quot;trusting&quot; that they will be safe, trusting in my trust in them as not to &quot;manifest&quot; the child to be in harm&#39;s way. That to me is pure ludacris. THAT is different than my trusting my child in what they choose to do. That is misuse of the whole concept in trusting our children&#39;s choices & interests.<br/>
<br/>
Did I miss something here? I think not. I don&#39;t think I misunderstood the point he was trying to make & convince the listeners of..If anything he sounded insane about this. Yeah, he survived but...well. I still think its pure moronic thinking. Any thoughts on this sort of thought in Unschoolers? I don&#39;t feel THIS is what Unschooling is about. Nuts.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Lis, what I am seeing here is that you have heard some stuff that is <br/>
extremely challenging to your world view and the paradigm of &quot;good parent&quot;. <br/>
This is causing you to react strongly with &quot;how can this be?!?&quot; feeling. I&#39;m <br/>
glad you have come here to talk about it, and ask questions, because that <br/>
very discomfort that you are feeling is a sign that you are close to some <br/>
kind of paradigm shift.<br/>
<br/>
Every child has different capabilities. Some have, and will always have, <br/>
much greater balance and awareness of their physical space than others. Plus <br/>
little kids tend to have a heavy head, but a low center of gravity when <br/>
sitting (thinking of the child sitting on the edge of the water).<br/>
<br/>
One thing of which we can be pretty much certain is that parents calling out <br/>
things like a generalized &quot;be careful&quot; or &quot;don&#39;t fall&quot;, or worse making <br/>
negative predictions like &quot;if you do that you will fall&quot; are distracting to <br/>
concentration at best, and strongly suggestive at worst. Most parents do not <br/>
want to accept that it is their own palpable fear and visible hovering that <br/>
causes their child to fall or fail.<br/>
<br/>
My experience has been that most of the time, Jayn will be more accurately <br/>
conservative about her own abilities or balance than I would have expected <br/>
if I had been a conventional parent. Her ability to see and notice danger <br/>
was manifest much younger than conventional parenting ideas would have led <br/>
me to believe also. Unschooling showed me how to maintain an assumption of <br/>
competence and an assumption of good judgement on her part, that continues <br/>
into all kinds of areas as Jayn ages.<br/>
<br/>
That does not mean I ignore my own fear or discomfort however. I have talked <br/>
in the past about Jayn wanting to do &quot;gymnastics&quot; by balancing on her belly <br/>
on the rail of our second floor balcony when she was about 5. It was too <br/>
nerve wracking for me, so I suggested that she could do the same thing <br/>
downstairs on a similar handrail that is at ground level, and I could even <br/>
put down some padding. Jayn was willing, I could stand to spot her if she <br/>
needed it, and she never so much as wobbled. She agreed not to scare me by <br/>
hanging over the balcony, and I agreed to come downstairs to watch her hang <br/>
on the low rail anytime.<br/>
<br/>
Another similar thing, that has nothing to do with Jayn&#39;s ability but my <br/>
comfort, is going to play outside the front gate of our building. I have <br/>
undertaken to drop whatever I am doing and accompany her and her friends <br/>
outside whenever they want to play there - which is rare and brief. This is <br/>
because of my fears to do with strangers noticing unattended children (esp. <br/>
during school hours) than any concern about Jayn&#39;s ability to keep herself <br/>
safe. All they are doing is looking at the flowers or following squirrels. <br/>
Sometimes they like to talk to folk walking dogs, so I like to be there for <br/>
that too. My neighbor does not have these same concerns; she doesn&#39;t worry <br/>
about her two going outside since she knows they won&#39;t go away. It is a rare <br/>
case of me being the conservative parent!<br/>
<br/>
Sandra kept something that I wrote about Jayn and safety on her site. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/yes.html">http://sandradodd.com/yes.html</a> Scroll down towards the bottom the &quot;Yes&quot; page <br/>
for my contribution, and a further comment.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the point about much of this is that children who are accepted and <br/>
trusted are less likely to want to express bravado or rebellion by <br/>
attempting dangerous things against their own better judgement, and are also <br/>
still in tune with their own judgment. They are more likely to feel free to <br/>
say, &quot;No that&#39;s too scary for me&quot; if pushed by other kids, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Toddler Jayn fell into our pool once too. Longest 4 seconds of my life. She <br/>
turned right instead of left and just walked off over the edge. She went <br/>
down then bobbed right up thanks to her layers of woolly clothing. I was <br/>
able to fish her right out before she sank again, and was lucky that I <br/>
didn&#39;t have to jump in. She coughed once and then cried. I took her upstairs <br/>
to get dry and warm right away. Maybe the parent with the child sitting on <br/>
the ledge was confident that she could get her baby out immediately in the <br/>
unlikely event that the little one fell in.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the ledge was confident that she could get her baby out immediately in the unlikely event that the little one fell in.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I often ask myself &quot;what is the worse thing that can happen?&quot; and if I can live with that, then I try to breathe and let it be. Letting the kids ride in the back of my truck when we aren&#39;t on a trafficked road has flipped some of my friends out. I was letting them sit on the tailgate as we traveled between parking lots at ARGH (an unschooling gathering at Roan Mt. TN) which took all of 40 seconds and involved me driving so slow they could have fallen off and been fine.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll drive them in the back around campgrounds or places where I feel comfortable doing so, because they love doing it and ask often. It was funny too, because one of my unschooling friends was REALLY uncomfortable seeing us pull up with my kids in the back of the truck at a recent gathering. I had let them move to the back after stopping to pay the park fee. I explained but she was still very uncomfortable and I just shrugged at that point. Not my problem.<br/>
<br/>
Later, we all were going up from the swimming area to a campsite where some out-of-town unschoolers were staying and ALL of the kids wanted a ride in the back of the truck. I had a truck bed full of happy, screaming unschoolers and it was all fine.<br/>
<br/>
I think we react to things without a lot of thinking sometimes, because we&#39;ve been taught it&#39;s &quot;dangerous&quot; or &quot;irresponsible&quot;. Yes, bad things can happen but we don&#39;t even give a second thought to driving in vehicles, which is extremely dangerous but totally acceptable!<br/>
<br/>
Being alive is inherently dangerous. I think allowing children to take risk is a really important part of learning. I don&#39;t think we should ignore our need for safety, but there are ways to actively work with our children rather than being the big NO all the time. Not that &quot;no&quot; isn&#39;t useful at times too!<br/>
<br/>
The big issue for us recently was about a pack of boys wanting to drift down the river we visit every week. They drift down over rapids and rocks, well beyond our hearing and sight. It&#39;s very uncomfortable at times but we talked about our discomfort and the kids really felt very capable and went on their way. One of us could have gone with them, one of us could have walked the river bank etc... there were other ways to meet both needs. In the end, there&#39;s a certain amount of &quot;testing&quot; oneself against nature and the world that humans get a lot of growth and confidence out of...just read about the walkabouts the aboriginal people used to take.<br/>
<br/>
There are ways our children might do their own &quot;walkabout&quot; in modern times. But it takes going against the grain of what conventional parents might allow a child. It takes not only trust, but working through challenges together and analyzing risk while examining where our own fears stem from. Is it useful fear or a knee-jerk reaction?<br/>
<br/>
Jalen sprained his foot really bad this week, running down our stairs. Risk is everywhere. I had to examine my fears carefully as each of my children became interested in knives and whittling. Sharp knives can really hurt. In the end, I decided that cutting oneself is often part of the risk that I can live with. Even a bad cut can be stitched. So we talked about safe ways to use the knives and over all the years they&#39;ve had very small nicks but no bad cuts. Trevor got his first pocketknife around age 6 or 7. Children used to be trusted with driving tractors and sharp tools and such....they haven&#39;t gotten less capable of these things, they&#39;ve become less trusted as our society becomes more and more fearful about children and their ability.<br/>

Right.  Many of the things i did as a kid are illegal now, but I think  <br/>
it&#39;s largely because of insurance companies.  Some people can see the  <br/>
bigger picture and see what factors are money-driven and which are  <br/>
about love and learning and nuturance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1284113585">Thanks to all who have replied to this so far. I really appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
I must admit I feel mighty nauseated (literally) even imagining one of my children out on a limb over the freakin&#39; Grand Canyon or some such scenario. I know it could happen & that this sort of thing happens all the time...especially with brave bold children. This is a wonderful trait to have. I would do my best to get the kid down ASAP also while remaining as cool calm & collected as I could in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose you guys are right about our culture & how we view childhood exploration. I remember doing a LOT when by myself outside (& in)that most would consider negligent on a parent&#39;s part. I have asked my mother if she was behind me or nearby during _____________ & she doesn&#39;t remember, unfortunately. I DO know I was alone after the age of about 6 or 7 in the house. I also walked to & fro friends houses & to schools in big cities (Baltimore, Manhattan) in early elementary school & intermediate. When I was a kid I did not wear a helmet when I rode my big wheel (which I loved to do donuts in on the street & while pulling the E-brake) or while ice or roller skating. In fact, I even used to walk across the lake (when it was frozen, that is) I lived on during my high school years...it was 9 miles long & a mile wide. I did this at night at least once that I can remember. I rode in cars without seat belts as a young one. etc. etc. etc. & I am alive. Maybe when its our &#39;time&#39; to go, its our time. Maybe we truly have no control over most things...well obviously, we truly don&#39;t. But if I can help my kids not being injured or killed I&#39;m SO THERE. <br/>
<br/>
My son has gone under water twice unintentionally on my part. I lost my hold on him...it was terrifying but mama bear mode kicked in & I got him quickly. Thankfully he didn&#39;t swallow any water either. He didn&#39;t even cry either time. He has gone under in practicing exactly that & he loves it. So maybe this trust is also hand in hand with our child&#39;s age & competency. Some of our kids have amazing equalibrium & focus, & some are more challenged or even uninterested in taking more daring ventures. <br/>
<br/>
I actually would also let my son crawl or walk across the road if it weren&#39;t a busy one. In fact I HAVE. I made sure no one was coming as well before I let him get to the area cars drive on. I didn&#39;t stop him though but if I had to temporarily keep him from continuing I would, of course.<br/>
<br/>
I have been struggling with easing up on my daughter in regards to her bike helmet. My thoughts have been that I don&#39;t want her hurting her brain should she take a hard fall on her head...of course. Not one of us would want our child hurt. I don&#39;t think that isn&#39;t trusting her capability. It is just pure precaution, isn&#39;t it? I&#39;m not sure if I should just let her ride her bike & scooter w/out her helmet should she choose not to wear it or request that she wears it...what are your thoughts? I sometimes will ask her how she is going to keep herself safe outside when she goes & plays (we live in a resort where there are a ton of cars in the parking lot coming & going as well as strangers galore) & I feel better when we discuss that. I don&#39;t do this every time & in fact I haven&#39;t asked that in a few weeks. She roams all over the place around here. I trust her capability to do so. <br/>
<br/>
I know that accidents can happen anytime, anywhere. I have heard that riding in cars or on bikes, say, is more risky than climbing a tree or riding in the back of a pick up truck on a dirt road (man, that makes me miss living in the country SO MUCH!!!). I was once on a ride in the back of a monster truck at a county faire & I felt so scared for my daughter & I. On one hand I knew that the driver of the truck was skilled at doing donuts in this thing (I didn&#39;t know we were going to do donuts in a monster truck!)despite that he was smoking a cigarette the whole ride...<br/>
<br/>
My daughter likes to climb up on our car (its an Isuzu trooper)& stand on the roof. She did this a few times in her old school&#39;s parking lot. You know how mellow Waldorf schools are about such feats...well you should have seen the looks on the parents teachers & kids&#39; faces as I allowed my daughter to just BE. One part of me was thrilled for her (& my self for being cool with her venture) & the other part was a tad concerned over what other&#39;s thought of my mothering her. I let her stay up there happily playing but after a while I started this demanding panicky talk insisting she get down. I now know that that was NOT what I was feeling...it was feeding into the mainstream thought that my daughter was in danger (which she might have been...just as a meteor could have dropped from the sky & landed on our heads or a cougar leaping out of the woods nearby)& going with that energy.<br/>
<br/>
I think besides the worry over my kids being hurt factor, I also worry over what others&#39; will think & that to the law, say, a lot of this &#39;trust&#39; we have as parents who live this way would be considered negligence & oh I can&#39;t think of the other term I&#39;m wanting to put here.<br/>
<br/>
This IS truly a shift for me as far as certain situations go for my children. In some &quot;areas&quot; I&#39;m cool with my daughter (she is almost 7)  & son (he is 20 months) going &#39;into&#39; alone & in others I&#39;m not there yet. I&#39;m sure this shift will take time. I agree that most children&#39;s agility is so much more able (& willing!!!) than the majority of adults. So really, I need to chill. Easier said than done. This is all a part of letting go & just LIVING life...going about it how I believe it should be lived. A part of deschooling myself. <br/>
<br/>
This is a great discussion. One that is probably one of the top issues with those who want to unschool or are newer to accepting all parts in the basis of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
p.s.: I love the freely given support so many of you give to us who still struggle in some areas...I am sure I&#39;m not alone in being dissed by some who have become so famous they do not make the time or select from certain parents or better yet, charge (& might I add, a pretty penny) for their expertise on unschooling. Or they play games & pick & choose who they want participating on their lists. This is very sad. I have met many a parent online who can relate to this.<br/>
<br/>
Ok...onto playing with my son. :O)<br/>

walls be padded?  All dishes should be plastic, not glass that can  <br/>
break and kill someone.  Stoves are dangerous....<br/>
<br/>
Everyone draws the line somewhere.  What&#39;s important is not what other  <br/>
people think about what you&#39;re doing, but that you&#39;re thinking about  <br/>
it yourself and are clear on what you can handle, on your own  <br/>
awareness of your child&#39;s capabilities (is she a great athlete, or  <br/>
kind of klutzy?)---make it about principles more than about rules.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126665024">I read this thread with interest, and believe I have a unique perspective on this one.  I am a newish unschooler who lived and worked for nine months at the Grand Canyon.  My husband lived and hiked extensively there for 12 years.<br/>
<br/>
I can state with certainty that there are definite dangers in walking away and trusting in a child&#39;s capability to hang on a tree growing horizontally at or near the canyon rim... <br/>
<br/>
The rim is, in many places, heavy with slippery scree.  Trees may seem to be a lot more firmly anchored than they are.  In many places, rescue if a slip occurred would be very difficult, perhaps requiring a helicopter or another method that would then endanger other lives.  <br/>
<br/>
The Grand Canyon is not permanent and unchanging.  The rim is constantly eroding, and earthquakes are not rare, there.  great boulders sometimes fall, without warning... <br/>
<br/>
There are warning signs about these dangers, and rangers will warn or ticket people who violate the law regarding use of the canyon.  <br/>
<br/>
Aside from the risk to the child, the tree, already growing in a difficult environment, could easily have been broken or harmed by the stunt...<br/>
<br/>
Death can and is sometimes part of a national park experience, and often, it is just this type of unknowing carelessness that leads to it.  There were deaths with very similar circumstances at both the Grand Canyon and Yellowstone during the time we lived there.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is no protection at all from natural dangers.  Common sense and awareness of the environment&#39;s inherent risks are still needed.  <br/>
<br/>
I would not allow even my very agile child to take the risk of hanging from a tree at the rim, nor would I allow my children to put their hands into a Yellowstone hot spring to test its heat...  <br/>
<br/>
In these cases, the limits are clearly imposed by the environment, and I would be giving them the benefit of my experience where theirs might be lacking.  I&#39;d do it for any of you, too...because that is, after all, what friends are for.<br/>

<br/>
Nor protection from legal problems, nor the disapproval of other people.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly had the problems on the pudding-wrestling night, she asked  <br/>
me to tell people specifically because she said it did seem that some  <br/>
people thought that if a child&#39;s parents didn&#39;t mind something, that  <br/>
that made it okay across the board.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not okay for a parent to let a child climb on a tree at a  <br/>
national monument, it seems (or at least not old trees on edges of  <br/>
great cliffs; not sure of the official federal statute &lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
For those who have joined the list since Holly&#39;s legal adventures, the  <br/>
first part is here:<br/>

we went to be rehabilitated.  I have notes, somewhere...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-653378050"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;-=-Unschooling is no protection at all from natural dangers. -=-<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Nor protection from legal problems, nor the disapproval of other people<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Regardless, of other people I always allowed calculated risks--rather than<br/>
crazy risks.  &quot;Crazy risks&quot; where the benefit is small, and the risk of<br/>
serious injury/death great, were where I planned to draw the line and the<br/>
law looks askance at parents who allow death defying stunts.  Worked out<br/>
perfectly--lots of freedom, almost no risk of death if the stunt failed lol<br/>
<br/>
Luckily none of my three boys every risked their lives, so I was always able<br/>
to say yes to their requests.  My middle son, Martin, climbed monkey bars<br/>
six feet off the ground at eleven months of age(with a mat underneath).  I<br/>
remember nonchalantly drinking my coffee and being elbowed out of the way by<br/>
another mother who stood beneath him--horrified at my &quot;carelessness&quot;  She<br/>
blushed when he had no balance issue; seemed to slip but recovered without<br/>
missing a beat. Martin also expressed annoyance at this strange woman&#39;s arms<br/>
reaching out for him, and perhaps his &quot;slip&quot; was in reaction to<br/>
her &quot;help&quot;.   Her son was two weeks older it turned out and completely<br/>
incapable of such a feat (bwg), though since he&#39;d never had an opportunity<br/>
to try and she was just guessing.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I was willing to throw the coffee down and catch him, but I knew<br/>
falling wouldn&#39;t be a big hazard.  The coffee was also a prop since Marty<br/>
objected to my standing arms outstretched *interfering*, which of course<br/>
created a more dangerous situation, as he was wriggling away from me, rather<br/>
than enjoying his climb.<br/>
<br/>
His older brother had fallen off a climber into sand at a year and a half of<br/>
age--so I knew that adults offer distractions which can cause accidents.  It<br/>
was an extraordinary climb as the gap between the bars were taller than he<br/>
was.  He climbed it successfully at least twenty times before he fell.  I<br/>
remember nursing him on the spot, while a man berated me for having it<br/>
backward:  one and a half year olds are too old to nurse, but too young to<br/>
climb.  Rowan had a small bruise, but recovered after two seconds on my lap<br/>
and showed the man up by climbing it successfully two more times before<br/>
agreeing to go to the swings.  He was the only child under two and a half on<br/>
that climber!<br/>
<br/>
While trees were okay to climb I cannot imagine allowing my boys to be over<br/>
a canyon, although they have fallen from seven feet with no serious injury.<br/>
Accidents happen.  Climbing is not about trust, but about probability and<br/>
risks.  As an adult I am responsible, and I have the life experience to know<br/>
that a two year old who uses sharp paring knives might get hurt, but under<br/>
supervision I can intervene.  The Grand Canyon drop wouldn&#39;t qualify as<br/>
something I could offer first aid to fix and so I have to say this seems<br/>
shortsighted on the part of the parent.  My values include freedom to<br/>
explore, and a providing a safe nurturing environment.<br/>

<br/>
Hey, MY middle kid, Martin, was up on top of a platform that had two  <br/>
slides coming down, when he was maybe 15 months old.  He had climbed  <br/>
up himself, and not for the first time.  He was sitting there,  on  <br/>
that large padded platform, waiting for one of the dozen or so bigger  <br/>
kids in our group to take him down the slide, when they had a chance,  <br/>
when they got up there.  He wasn&#39;t walking around.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I&#39;m sitting a little way away with Kirby, who was three and  <br/>
a more nervous kind of kid.<br/>
<br/>
An older woman said &quot;WHOSE little BABY is up on that slide?&quot;   The  <br/>
other moms looked and kinda giggled and smiled while I got up and went  <br/>
over to stand by Marty until someone came to let him slide in front of  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1896639229">Well, Martin is a warrior name and my kid always seemed &quot;fearless&quot; to other<br/>
parents.  Too funny about the namesake thing!  Maybe it&#39;s an onamastics<br/>
thing?  Probably just having the right mom for the right kid!<br/>
<br/>
When I organized The Federation of Teaching Parents Conference a couple of<br/>
years ago Martin was my poster boy.  There was a picture of him on the flyer<br/>
holding a frog, wearing a life jacket, blond hair dishevelled.  He has<br/>
amazing reflexes and caught his first frog before his third birthday.  He is<br/>
also left-handed and seems good with judging spaces.  I really love his<br/>
spirit and sense of adventure.<br/>
<br/>
He wasn&#39;t walking when he climbed the monkey bars.<br/>
<br/>
At age four my  Martin climbed a street light in our local park.  I remember<br/>
he was the only kid who got to the top, shimmying up using his whole body.<br/>
The frustrated student park attendant said, &quot;There is no rule against it,<br/>
but I think that&#39;s because no kid has ever climbed more than halfway up<br/>
before.  But he makes it look so easy now all the other kids are trying to<br/>
do it&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty surprised he could shimmy up to the top of the lamp post, even<br/>
though he had pulled off lots of incredible climbs &lt;g&gt;  But I knew he would<br/>
be fine if he could get up thre as I had seen him get down &quot;fireman&quot; poles<br/>
in playgrounds that were that high off the ground for a couple of years; so<br/>
it seemed natural he would work on shimmying up a lamp post.<br/>

Experience can only come from actual experience. You can share, but that doesn&#39;t equal their agreement with your take on the experience. Yes, parents should share information and discuss strategies for safety. In the end, you only gain experience directly...otherwise it&#39;s simply information that may or may not have any relevance for the other person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756162487">I wrote this a couple of days ago, and it seems useful to share here,  <br/>
as to the concept of the limits of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Freedom<br/>
<br/>
A discussion came up in which someone asked about &quot;True Freedom&quot; as  <br/>
though it were a concept central to unschooling. I&#39;d never had the  <br/>
phrase used, and discussion ensued.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just musing and analysis of the ideas of freedom, which  <br/>
unschoolers do tend toward in lots of things, but in ALL things?  <br/>
Maybe, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
I think what some families call &quot;freedom,&quot; I call &quot;choices.&quot; In the  <br/>
discussion referred to above, I wrote:<br/>
<br/>
Just like getting lots of gifts instead of one big one, if you say  <br/>
&quot;sure,&quot; &quot;okay,&quot; &quot;yes&quot; to lots of requests for watching a movie late or  <br/>
having cake for breakfast or them playing another half hour on the  <br/>
swings and you can just read a book in the car nearby, then they get  <br/>
TONS of yes, and permission, and approval. If you throw your hands up  <br/>
and say &quot;Whatever,&quot; that&#39;s a disturbing moment of mom seeming not to  <br/>
care instead of mom seeming the provider of an assortment of joyous  <br/>
approvals.<br/>
<br/>
The bold face print in the quote below came from something Danielle  <br/>
Conger wrote. My responses are indented.  It&#39;s at the link below.<br/>
<br/>
After reading Sandra&#39;s words, I realize that my kids come to me, not  <br/>
because I say they have to, but because they use me as a sounding board.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;re coming to you as a font of &quot;yes!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a cool thing, if every time they want something loving and  <br/>
positive, they run to mom, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Asking permission becomes a way of gauging their own sense of right  <br/>
and wrong because they know that I will explain a no and help them  <br/>
come up with better alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
My big guys still ask little things, like &quot;Can I have this last soda?&quot;  <br/>
What that means is &quot;had you dibsed it?&quot; or &quot;Is this perhaps NOT the  <br/>
last soda, so I&#39;ll feel better about taking it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I say &quot;Sure,&quot; they&#39;re drinking a soda I gave them, and I bet it  <br/>
tastes better than one they snagged knowing they had &quot;the right&quot; to  <br/>
drink it, but they wanted the blessing.<br/>

YOu can &quot;not allow&quot; but that won&#39;t stop things from happening. How do you<br/>
deal with a child who wants to do something you &quot;won&#39;t allow&quot;? Not allowing<br/>
is sometimes more dangerous than walking away.<br/>
<br/>
There are signs at Yellowstone that say not to touch the hot springs.  My 62<br/>
year old very sensible mother went and on an impulse decided to touch the<br/>
water.  The water was so clear that her fingers went into it before she<br/>
realized she had touched it.  It was hard to tell where the surface actually<br/>
was and so her fingers went in further than she anticipated.  It WAS hot,<br/>
she said.  She was fine.  ;)  Probably not a different experience than a<br/>
child would have (although I&#39;m not talking about most 2 year olds here but<br/>
older children) if they gave into the impulse to touch the hot springs<br/>
despite warnings from their parents or signs.  Shades of gray in the danger<br/>
zone, I think.<br/>

<br/>
You say no.<br/>
If you say no and he continues, then you know and he knows, God knows  <br/>
and witnesses know, that you didn&#39;t say &quot;Sure, sweetie!&quot; or that you  <br/>
didn&#39;t just walk off without taking any notice.<br/>
<br/>
It could mean the difference between going home (with or without your  <br/>
child) or in worst cases having your child removed, or going to jail  <br/>
for criminal neglect or something.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s a difference between saying, &quot;That tree could break,  <br/>
please come back,&quot; in an informative and concerned way, and screaming  <br/>
&quot;GET DOWN FROM THERE or I will WHIP YOUR BUTT!&quot;  The kid might go  <br/>
farther out on the tree to avoid that.<br/>
<br/>
Alarming or threatening a child is probably more dangerous in those  <br/>
moments than finding a calm way to lure him toward you.<br/>
<br/>
None of those are for a mom to say &quot;Whatever; he&#39;ll live or he&#39;ll die.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another thing from the book this week:<br/>
<br/>
Respect<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Respect was discussed in the section on &quot;being,&quot; earlier in the book,  <br/>
but in light of &quot;freedom,&quot; respect can take another whirl.  If I &quot;give  <br/>
my children freedom&quot; in a situation, it&#39;s because I had some leeway or  <br/>
rights myself.  I cannot &quot;give them freedom&quot; that I don&#39;t have.<br/>
<br/>
Some unschoolers become confused on that, and they begin to frolic in  <br/>
the &quot;freedom&quot; that they are pretty sure some stranger online granted  <br/>
them, and that unschoolers have inalienably from God, bypassing all  <br/>
forms of government and the limitations of wallboard.  And so if an  <br/>
unschooling family is up at 3:00 a.m. playing Guitar Hero, they seem  <br/>
mystified that the neighbors have called the landlord.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m exaggerating.  I hope I&#39;m exaggerating.<br/>
<br/>
If a storeowner says not to touch the crystal figures, a parent cannot  <br/>
&quot;give her child the freedom&quot; to touch them anyway.  She could buy one  <br/>
and take it out of the store and let her kid touch the heck out of it,  <br/>
but she can&#39;t tell a store owner, &quot;You don&#39;t understand; we&#39;re  <br/>
unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So although I might seem to be wandering aimlessly here, freedom  <br/>
should involve a respect for others, and a respect for logic.  And a  <br/>
family might not feel they &quot;respect the law,&quot; but the laws still do  <br/>
apply to them, no matter how twinkly-eyed they have become in their  <br/>
newfound &quot;freedom.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if someone is selling you &quot;True Freedom&quot; (or snake oil, or the  <br/>
elixir of the fountain of life), have respect for yourself and your  <br/>
family and take a pass on it.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, parents with a realistic and considered awareness of what  <br/>
their own freedoms are within the laws of the apartment building,  <br/>
housing development, city, county/parish/township, state/province or  <br/>
nation are free to share some of those with their children.  We let  <br/>
Holly choose carpet once, but we couldn&#39;t have legally required her to  <br/>
pay for it, as she was only eight or nine at the time.  We have  <br/>
surprised waiters in many restaurants by turning to our children  <br/>
questioningly when the waiter asks the adults &quot;Would you like to see  <br/>
the dessert menu?&quot;  They&#39;re even more surprised when the kids say, &quot;No  <br/>
thanks,&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m full,&quot; while making friendly eye contact with the  <br/>
waiter.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-149544359">What do you guys think of the legalities in regards to children playing at playgrounds? ie. signs posted by our playground here say ages 2-5 in one area (shorter stuff) & then 5+ for the other. I let my son go in both areas. But technically I COULD get scolded for allowing my son to play in either area as he is under 2. Pfff! I personally would allow my kids to play on any equipment they want to and spot them while acting like I&#39;m not. ;o) I guess I&#39;d play dumb if I got in &quot;trouble&quot; by the resort or a cop or something. I also will allow my children to put rocks or woodchips, say, on the slides as long as there are no other kids or where there are kids (or parents) who don&#39;t mind them on there. I get annoyed when parents don&#39;t care for this sort of thing but I&#39;m learning to be respectful while living my rebel lifestyle. :O)<br/>
<br/>
A lot of parents do not allow their babies or toddlers, even preschoolers, into the hot tubs here, either for fear of what so many doctors advise against it, I&#39;m sure...The sign posted says they (kids under 12) can go in as long as they are accomopanied by an adult (who has been &#39;cleared&#39; by their physician to go in such hot water...LOL).<br/>
  <br/>
It makes me so sad to witness when the children so want to go in them! I went during pregnancy with my kids AND they still go now. In fact, my daughter finally began to go under water in the one hot tub here where she would not do it before. My kids love the warmth (as does mama!!!).<br/>
<br/>
This brings to mind an incident that occurred when I was 4yo in Mexico while my parents & I were living there. There was a little pony ride shindig off the side of the road. I believe the road was a 4 lane highway (not a highway like ours but still, a major thruway). For some reason the man operating this didn&#39;t lead me around the little circle (which was NOT enclosed completely)by the rope or didn&#39;t have a good enough grip. My parents trusted me to ride this pony. I remember feeling so confident. Well my dog decided to jump out one of the windows on our VW bus & chase the pony. The pony ran onto the road in the opposition direction. I remember thinking OMG this pony is taking me away from my mom. I remember envisioning the pony running past house after house further and further away from her. I thought, &quot;I need to let go&quot;. So I did. I allowed my body to fall to the right & I landed on the asphalt which resulted in a very scratched up bloody right cheek and a fractured leg. The whole scene that followed was chaotic. My mom was hysterical. A lady cop with blue eyeshadow pulled us over wondering why my dad was speeding. My mom showed me to her and I think she escorted us to the hospital. Quite humorous. But all in all, I handled it just fine on my own & I think my parents trust in me on the pony was awesome...or maybe the guy WAS holding the rope and they thought I was safe...but still, I felt on top of the world thruout the whole experience. I even rode a bigger pony with my cast on. :O) What spirit. I still have it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I remember when Sierra was littlish (around 4) and she was at the top of this very tall slide. She was coming down almost standing up and this Mom yelled at her &quot;sit DOWN&quot;. I was horrified, as was Sierra. She froze and looked over at me like &quot;what in the hell do I DO?&quot;<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This woman had two little girls who were pristinely dressed and yelled at to stay clean the entire time we were there. She also went and told on us when our kids were up in a big oak tree (a tree they climbed weekly). When nobody came out from the rec center to yell at us she left the park in a huff.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have found that my children trust me in many ways that are unexpected.  My daughter really pushed me into radical unschooling because she was/is very sensitive to power issues.  I needed to get it right with her.  As we have come into rightness, she now happily asks my opinion about all sorts of things, as does my son.  And it goes both ways--I ask their opinions all the time as well.<br/>
<br/>
If I say that I really don&#39;t think something is a good idea, they trust that.  If I&#39;ve missed something and they have a piece of info for me that changes my opinion, they feel free to share it and sometimes it does.  There&#39;s lots of give and take, and they trust that my opinions aren&#39;t arbitrary.  We don&#39;t have issues with &quot;won&#39;t allow&quot; anymore--we just live together and help each other out.<br/>
<br/>
And there are beginning to be more times that my son (14) helps me out in a similar way.  We were given some irresistible fluffy cinnamon bread that we were sharing, and my son knew that if I kept eating I would get a stomach ache, so he gently reminded me.  When I kept indulging, he tried to take it away from me--which showed me exactly how kids feel when food is withheld or taken from them--not good.  So we talked about that, and then I did stop eating.  It was a great moment, and I had the unexpected opportunity of feeling &quot;taken care of&quot; by my child.  <br/>

&gt;&gt;positive, they run to mom, huh?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t put boundries on food.  If we keep it in the house they can eat it<br/>
at will, but my kids will inexplicably politely ask me for ice cream, or<br/>
even a glass of milk.  Often I go to serve it to them only to have them tell<br/>
me not to bother and offer me a bowl of nuts or ice cream or whatever it<br/>
is.  I was often puzzled by this, but now in this context it seems really<br/>
interesting.  Although I always ask before I eat the last of anything.<br/>
Maybe they are just checking to make sure the sour cream can be used for<br/>
corn chips and is not integral to a dish I am creating for a meal?<br/>
<br/>
I remember once my sil told my son he couldn&#39;t have ice cream.  He asked why<br/>
not and she said she  didn&#39;t want him to have all that sugar.  Then she<br/>
paused for a minute and decided that wasn&#39;t a good reason in her opinion and<br/>
all the kids had ice cream.  She looked at me as I took Martin aside and<br/>
told him at other people&#39;s houses it was rude to ask &quot;why not&quot;?  At home I<br/>
always supply a reason--usually it is because there is not enough for<br/>
everyone and I would rather we wait or check in to make sure it is fine.<br/>
This is from previous experience when someone has finished the milk or<br/>
yoghurt and another somebody has been reduced to tears because they didn&#39;t<br/>
get any.<br/>

My impression is those numbers are for insurance purposes.  Many times a<br/>
sign goes up after a mixed use playground has been around because whatever<br/>
Insurance company the school or city park uses has given them a higher rate.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; YOu can &quot;not allow&quot; but that won&#39;t stop things from happening. How do you deal with a child who wants to do something you &quot;won&#39;t allow&quot;? Not allowing is sometimes more dangerous than walking away.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Doh! You&#39;re right!  Not allowing isn&#39;t the answer.  Awareness is.  Parents who bring children to the edge of canyons would do very well to consider potentially life-threatening conditions ahead of time, and to prepare their children for them.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if that happened in this case, and I haven&#39;t yet had a boy the age of the boy in the original post. But humans are equipped with a survival instinct, and knowing the full -ahem- gravity of the situation might have easily led to a child who chose a tree a few feet further from the edge to challenge himself with, and a mother who didn&#39;t need to walk away in terror.<br/>
<br/>
I was reacting, in part, to my own near miss at falling into the canyon, during a picnic lunch with Jim in the first days of our relationship.  I&#39;d stretched prone on a warm ,spacious rock along the rim, and, when I rolled to get up, I rolled toward the edge (my sense of direction is unreliable).  I felt the emptiness beside me in time, and caught myself.  But it is likely I would have died, if I hadn&#39;t.  It was quite a drop.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; ~~I would be giving them the benefit of my experience where theirs might be lacking.  I&#39;d do it for any of you, too...because that is, after all, what friends are for.~~<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Experience can only come from actual experience. You can share, but that doesn&#39;t equal their agreement with your take on the experience. Yes, parents should share information and discuss strategies for safety. In the end, you only gain experience directly...otherwise it&#39;s simply information that may or may not have any relevance for the other person.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True.  We talk about the canyon, and Yellowstone, frequently, read about them, watch documentaries.  We do not gloss over the dangers in our extolling of their beauty.  We walk along busy two-lane mountain highways with narrow shoulders to trailheads leading past eroded gorges and boulder-strewn paths.  We&#39;ve played in and around waterfalls, canoed, and camped in the wilderness.  We&#39;ve crossed busy city streets.  We&#39;ve talked, throughout, about what is safe, scary, or outright dangerous. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, we&#39;re building awareness and the ability to judge their capabilities against the potential for risk.  They aren&#39;t quite there, yet, and that is why I stay nearby when they try new and possibly risky feats, to help them navigate - or, if absolutely necessary, to remove them from harm&#39;s way. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Ren, for pointing out the flaws in my &quot;don&#39;t allow&quot; stance. My children *are* still young enough that I can physically deter them, if need be.  But they won&#39;t be for long, and it&#39;s good to eradicate that kind of thinking *before* we get to the place where I can&#39;t.  <br/>

I&#39;ve got a lot to think about...<br/>

&gt; There are signs at Yellowstone that say not to touch the hot springs.  My 62<br/>
&gt; year old very sensible mother went and on an impulse decided to touch the<br/>
&gt; water.  The water was so clear that her fingers went into it before she<br/>
&gt; realized she had touched it.  It was hard to tell where the surface actually<br/>
&gt; was and so her fingers went in further than she anticipated.  It WAS hot,<br/>
&gt; she said.  She was fine.  ;)  Probably not a different experience than a<br/>
&gt; child would have (although I&#39;m not talking about most 2 year olds here but<br/>
&gt; older children) if they gave into the impulse to touch the hot springs<br/>
&gt; despite warnings from their parents or signs.  Shades of gray in the danger<br/>
&gt; zone, I think.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Children and adults, and even dogs, have died from falling into geothermal features.  People have been burned by sticking their hands into the water.  More than just a few freak cases.  Some pools are cool; others are near boiling.  there is a great deal of geothermal shifting that makes the water features very unpredictable, as well as brilliantly colored...and if a child bends to look or touch, their heavier head can easily put them off-balance.  just stepping off the boardwalks can be deadly, because the earth beside it is often not nearly so firm as it seems, and boiling water could lie just beneath.<br/>
<br/>
Your mother is fortunate, and I am glad she wasn&#39;t harmed.  She aseasily could have been, had the feature been hotter.  There really isn&#39;t any way for a visitor to know (but, seriously, when the water is steaming, that should be a clue.  Most of us wouldn&#39;t stick our hands in a steaming kettle on the stove!)<br/>
<br/>
A park employee and experienced hiker died during the time we worked there, and her friends were severely burned.  They tried to jump a small stream, fell in - and the creek was carrying runoff from geothermals.<br/>
<br/>
The signs are there as a result of a law suit placed by the father of an 8 yo boy who fell into a hot spring, and was not recovered. <br/>
<br/>
You might be interested in a book written by Yellowstone historian Lee Whittlesley: &quot;Death in Yellowstone&#39;, which details the many ways in which the park perhaps holds hidden dangers.<br/>

about what a moron and authoratative mom/dr. this woman was.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s my fault this post is here.  I wrote and said I was rejecting it,  <br/>
but I must have failed to do so.<br/>
<br/>
The reason I wanted to/intended to send it back is that it&#39;s negative  <br/>
and it&#39;s not a good example.  It won&#39;t help people unschool.  I didn&#39;t  <br/>
want to have to say that in public, but now that  it&#39;s here...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Zip it&quot; is like &quot;shut up.&quot;  Those are not good things to say to  <br/>
people we love, when we&#39;re trying to help them negotiate the curves  <br/>
and scary parts of the world.<br/>
<br/>
-=- The doctor said to her with a gasp and then a firm &quot;You don&#39;t talk  <br/>
to your mom that way! That&#39;s NOT ok!&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve said that too.  She was in the doctor&#39;s office.  The  <br/>
doctor&#39;&#39;s working there.  If you&#39;re going to take your child into  <br/>
someone else&#39;s home/store/office/automobile, they *d0* get to comment  <br/>
on the way your child acts.<br/>

I&#39;m not a huge fan of doctors, but I&#39;m much less a fan of parents to  <br/>
tell their children that ANYone is &quot;a moron.&quot;<br/>
