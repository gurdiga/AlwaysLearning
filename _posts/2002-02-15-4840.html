<div id="ygrps-yiv-55591537">Hi Pat,<br/>
<br/>
Have your girls considered 4-H?  I think of it as basically an &quot;expand your<br/>
world&quot; plan that kids can pick and choose from at will.  My kids love it and<br/>
it isn&#39;t just raising heifers ;)<br/>
<br/>
We belong to a small homeschool 4-H group of about 20 kids.  In just this<br/>
group that has only been going a few months, we have kids raising goats and<br/>
rabbits for exhibitions, kids doing public speaking, kids doing photography,<br/>
kids doing shooting sports, kids sewing, kids cooking, kids raising turtles,<br/>
kids doing martial arts.  Each of the projects involves something about<br/>
leadership and community service.  Kids are completely free to participate<br/>
as much or as little as they choose.<br/>

Is 4-H JUST for kids?<br/>
A friend of mine and my family are buying land, starting a farm, and raising <br/>
alpacas. We are basically novices here (although I&#39;ve done the horse, dog, <br/>
cat, rabbit things)---and she asked whether 4-H was just for kids or whether <br/>
we could join in. I figured the Agriculture Extension office would be our <br/>
best bet, but I thought I&#39;d ask--if for nothing more than to answer her <br/>
question.  Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
There are often County Extension classes for adults.  And I bet you could <br/>
request one.  Also, county agents will advise on specific questions for <br/>
anyone.<br/>

<br/>
-=-In most states, you can join 4-H if you are between the ages of 8-18. Some <br/>
states have special age-appropriate programs designed especially for younger <br/>
kids. Check with your Cooperative Extension office to find out what projects <br/>
and activities are available for youth your age.-=-</div>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, good question Kelly.  I grew up completely<br/>
urbanized and our dream (which we are acting on and<br/>
hope to sson realize) is to own land and have some<br/>
small agriculture and livestock (mostly for ourselves)<br/>
and build an intentional community.  We are currently<br/>
looking into an option where we would almost have to<br/>
be homesteading in the beginning until we get the<br/>
infrastructure in place.  We have mostly been trying<br/>
to teach ourselves what we will need, and I know we<br/>
will learn a lot in the process, but it would be nice<br/>
to have real living people as a resource to ask<br/>
questions about things when we get stuck or need help.<br/>
