<div id="ygrps-yiv-196713092">Hey all. Im having a continual problem with my 2 yr old. He is very <br/>
aggressive. Not all the time at home, but mostly when he is around <br/>
other children. I try to stop him and tell him that hiting hurts and <br/>
its wrong, but I dont know what else to do. He is the third child. I <br/>
dont know if that has anything to do with it. Is this just a phase. It <br/>
has been going on for a while now. Is it something I have to just wait <br/>
to pass? Any advice?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-12710912">when our boy went through this (right at 2; he&#39;s 2.5 now) we started <br/>
teaching him sign language. A lot of his aggression turned out to be <br/>
frustration that he couldn&#39;t articulate (he&#39;s a late talker). Also, he <br/>
tends to get overwhelmed in crowded situations so the combination of <br/>
being able to communicate and having a &quot;buddy&quot; with him when in crowds <br/>
helped quite a bit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1758654469">Poor third kids can get really frustrated - they spend a lot of time  <br/>
around older siblings and other older kids. They can&#39;t articulate it,  <br/>
but they can feel that everyone else is more able, more capable, than  <br/>
they are. Imagine spending all your time feeling like you can&#39;t quite  <br/>
keep up, can&#39;t quite follow what other people around you are talking  <br/>
about, can&#39;t do what everyone else seems able to do.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to talk to him about it - help him develop vocabulary by  <br/>
talking about feelings. &quot;I bet that was frustrating, huh?&quot; &quot;Oh, they  <br/>
all seem to move so fast, don&#39;t they?&quot; And, as he gets a little  <br/>
older, you can be very direct with giving him ideas for other ways to  <br/>
respond to frustration - ways more likely to help him get what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, you have to stay close to him and observe him  <br/>
carefully and step in before his frustration level gets to the  <br/>
aggressive stage. The most effective strategy is usually distraction,  <br/>
so try that if possible. You can even enlist older siblings to keep  <br/>
an eye on his frustration level and they can learn to be sensitive  <br/>
enough to give him some special attention, just for a minute, before  <br/>
he gets too frustrated.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to read, &quot;The Explosive Child,&quot; by Ross Green to get  <br/>
lots more ideas about how to sort of arrange his environment to help  <br/>
him not get to that point of becoming aggressive.<br/>
<br/>
Two year olds don&#39;t need a lot of social time with other kids, by the  <br/>
way, so it might also be that he&#39;s getting too much time with other  <br/>
kids (happens to lots of third kids). Try to cut back social time,  <br/>
find ways to send the other two off with other families sometimes,  <br/>
for example.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; aggressive. Not all the time at home, but mostly when he is around<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When young Jayn was aggressive towards other children outside of the home, <br/>
like at the park, it was generally code for her being &quot;done&quot; and ready to go <br/>
home, or wanted my focus but she was unable to say so verbally or have that <br/>
realization. She would hit her father when she wanted to play and wrestle <br/>
with him, and was still learning to express her desires verbally.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that your 2 year old is mature enough to respond very well to the <br/>
verbal information that hitting hurts etc, and there is a danger that he <br/>
will start tuning you out as &quot;talking at&quot; him if it becomes repetitive. It <br/>
is probably necessary to be in closer proximity to him when he is playing, <br/>
and be ready to intervene and take him away/distract at the first sign of <br/>
incipient frustration.2 is too young to share easily, too young to have any <br/>
empathy for the other person.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes Jayn would hit out in a kind of experimental way, just to see what <br/>
would happen next. It is always a bit embarrassing to be the mother of the <br/>
hitter, but pretty much everyone goes through it. I would generally put my <br/>
arm around Jayn, but give my verbal attention and sympathy to the hurt <br/>
child - including take them to their mom if needed, and apologise on Jayn&#39;s <br/>
behalf. Then I would usually take Jayn away, either to the swings or to play <br/>
just with me, or to go home if she agreed. That was more effective than any <br/>
lecturing of Jayn, who was still too immature to make the connection that <br/>
her feeling of frustration and her action lashing out was a poor choice of <br/>
expression. I hope that my immediate actions were reassuring enough to the <br/>
other mothers, because Jayn has escaped being shouted at by other moms as I <br/>
have seen happen at park days.<br/>
<br/>
Also I found that Jayn needed much less interaction with other children (and <br/>
more with me) than I would have thought. She was much happier playing with <br/>
me than with other children most of the time. Maybe your ds is being placed <br/>
in crowds or with other children more than he really wants, especially if he <br/>
has siblings to interact with at home.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, I was surprised by how much the environment affected Jayn <br/>
particularly large echoey spaces, or crowds who were noisy. She was OK in <br/>
places like the supermarket if it was quiet, and she was OK outdoors most of <br/>
the time, but would get very anxious in places like auditoriums with <br/>
audiences, for quite a long time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600289349">Thanks alot. I do the distraction thing already and it does work. <br/>
But I didn&#39;t mention that I also have a 8 mo baby too. Along with <br/>
that the house to clean, food to prepare-Im sure you all know. So it <br/>
is very difficult to b there every moment. I will try to get that <br/>
book it sounds like it could help.  Im nursing a baby while I type <br/>
this so Im keeping it kind of short. Everything is peaceful right <br/>
now b/c of Handy Manny. Handy Manny, my savior! <br/>
But I never thought a/b him getting too much social time. That might <br/>
be alot of the problem. I will really try and work on getting him <br/>
some alone time. Man, I would be aggrivated too if I didnt have my <br/>
alone time. Sometimes I do! I appreciate the advice. It really helps <br/>
see outside my own perspective. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677227797"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;But I didn&#39;t mention that I also have a 8 mo baby too. Along with<br/>
&gt;&gt;that the house to clean, food to prepare-Im sure you all know. So it<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is very difficult to b there every moment. &lt;snip&gt; Im nursing a baby&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Oooooo, the memories. I had four children in five years, nursed nonstop for<br/>
8 years and 6 of those years tandem. I understand *feeling* like there are<br/>
limits. This is often just a feeling though...many limits are self-created,<br/>
and just need to be re-thought.<br/>
<br/>
Suggestions:<br/>
	-Continue to make your children&#39;s needs absolutely first. That means house<br/>
is ALWAYS lower on the list. If baby needs to nurse, that&#39;s what happens. If<br/>
2 yo wants loving, she gets loving. If she is hungry, she gets fed, with<br/>
love and ease. If both need something at the same time, use your body, voice<br/>
and all resources to give it to them both as best you can. This may seem<br/>
exhausting (and these were the tiredest years of my life), but the payoff in<br/>
the end, it you want to look at it that way, is TREMENDOUS. Children whose<br/>
needs are met this way consistently grow a natural independence that has the<br/>
fringe benefit of being less demanding on mom, at least that&#39;s how it worked<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
	-&quot;Over the Shoulder Baby Holder&quot; was fabulous for us, they loved being worn<br/>
much of the day. This allowed more freedom of movement for the other<br/>
children, even when the babe was nursing. You are probably familiar with<br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
	-FORGET THE HOUSE. When I look at pictures of our lives back then, the<br/>
surrounding house was unbelievably trashed. I see now that my tolerance<br/>
level for messiness then was quite admirable :o)<br/>
<br/>
	My daughter the other day was talking of how she has great memories of the<br/>
doors at our old house. &quot;Doors?&quot; I asked. Yes, she says, she remembers that<br/>
one of them wanted to paint their door and soon everyone wanted to paint<br/>
doors and so she remembers me taking all the doors off the hinges and<br/>
setting them up at the kids&#39; levels like easels. I barely remembered that<br/>
(those brain cells have been resting for a while), but lo and behold<br/>
pictures and videos indeed show doors off hinges, paint brushes, rollers,<br/>
sponges and paints around (along with plates of food, toys, and rolls of<br/>
toilet paper, just to get a feel) and then there are pictures with the doors<br/>
back on the hinges, all of them kid-created, facing the living room and<br/>
kitchen and all the places that guests see, even though the doors were<br/>
probably only beautiful to us, no matching color scheme ya know :oP.<br/>
<br/>
	The house was indeed a mess. But the KIDS, they are carrying some lifelong<br/>
cool memories. THEY don&#39;t remember a trashed house when they were little,<br/>
they only see that now when looking at pictures (and are surprised :o). They<br/>
remember joy and creativity and happiness and support. And my kids never got<br/>
hurt from our really really messy house. You know what I noticed back then?<br/>
They knew their environment. They carefully stepped over things. What a<br/>
great skill!<br/>
<br/>
	Our house today goes from mildly messy common space with some pretty messy<br/>
closed door rooms, to pretty darn clean, depending on who wants what when.<br/>
The house is still not first, even though my kids are now 18, 17, 15 and 13.<br/>
Though the kids on their own clean different things at different times, and<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed that in general, no one lets it get too messy anymore. They<br/>
like the clean space.<br/>
<br/>
	-Know that you will have your time again. Really.<br/>
<br/>
	-Do not get trapped into the nagging thought that you *need* more time to<br/>
yourself. Make your time with your children &quot;your time&quot;. If you find<br/>
yourself getting flustered, learn deep breathing exercises you can do in a<br/>
moment to relax and get back with the joy of your life right now, with your<br/>
kids. They really do grow up, and this time right now is for the relishing.<br/>
I think that we have been programmed to believe that we can&#39;t make it<br/>
without that warm bubble bath or quiet book time regularly. This mindset can<br/>
REALLY get in the way of a mom being with her children. I had maybe one<br/>
bubble bath by myself in 10 years. I had MANY with my kids...much more<br/>
enjoyable :o)<br/>
<br/>
	-Back to the question about the aggressive 2yo. Poster said, &quot;I can&#39;t<br/>
always be there.&quot; Even though &quot;always&quot; is a pretty high goal, it should be<br/>
the goal. You can get pretty close I&#39;m guessing. Especially if you make that<br/>
#1, above all else, for now. Wear the baby, be in the same room together,<br/>
watch carefully for precursors to the aggression. Then avoid or eliminate<br/>
the irritants. Add the things that she thrives on...physical games,<br/>
hugging/holding...see what gives her joy and make them a part of her day<br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
	-As far as food goes, we lived on finger foods for YEARS. It really can be<br/>
done, and easily. No one suffered from lack of a sit-down, well-prepared,<br/>
hot meal...again, a mindset that can get in the way of what is really<br/>
necessary. Today we regularly have well-prepared, sit-down meals<br/>
together...everyone knows how to use their utensils and have manners and<br/>
such. Back then, none of that was necessary, and it didn&#39;t fit easily into<br/>
our lives so we didn&#39;t do it. When we DID attempt it, the stress was just<br/>
not worth it.<br/>
<br/>
See what works most flowingly for your children and their joy, and make<br/>
decisions from that place.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039130676">Wow! All I can say is thank you. Your advice is VERY reassuring! And <br/>
I can see how those &quot;programmable&quot; mindsets interfere. I do often <br/>
remind myself to savor this time with my little ones.I know it does <br/>
pass so quickly and I know I will miss it when they are grown<br/>
When I was letting go of all the &quot;house&quot; stuff I was met with alot <br/>
of pressure from my husband to keep up on it. And it was very <br/>
stressful b/c I wanted to make sure everyones needs were met. That <br/>
led to a tremendous amount of stress and depression on my part b/c I <br/>
felt like I wasnt doing my job right. He saw what it all was doing <br/>
to me and has been easing up alot lately, but I still have a fear <br/>
lingering in the back of my mind that he is going to flip on me <br/>
again. I love him so much and want to make sure that his needs are <br/>
met too. He does help out alot off and on but sometimes he starts <br/>
feeling like he is working and then coming home and working some <br/>
more. I know it gets exhausting for him and I think he has a hard <br/>
time letting go of the standards too. It is quite an adjustment to <br/>
make. <br/>
He takes care of all of us financially and we are totally dependant <br/>
on him in that. And I know it is a huge stress for him. Do you have <br/>
any suggestions for helping him to understand as well? We dont have <br/>
any friends that unschool and all his friends are single. So he <br/>
doesnt really have anyone to relate to which I think it would help <br/>
alot. I have told him how all my friends say how difficult it is for <br/>
them who even only have one child to keep their house clean and he <br/>
says that it doesnt matter what other people say. That I am not <br/>
other people and I shouldnt compare myself to them. And that I could <br/>
do it if I really tried. <br/>
Im not trying to make him sound like a total a hole if you know what <br/>
I mean. He is a wonderful husband. I just think he is having a hard <br/>
time adjusting and letting go. I will let him read this and maybe <br/>
that will help. <br/>
I know he is a grown man, and I am not a doormat. I just wanted to <br/>
clarify that. But I am trying to avoid arguments. And you know there <br/>
really isnt alot of support out there for poeple who choose this <br/>
lifestyle. The majority of people are not about their children and <br/>
have those fears of them being &quot;too dependant&quot; and will not let <br/>
their house go to meet all their needs. I am not one of those people <br/>
but my husband tends to lean a little on that side. What do you all <br/>
have to say about that?<br/>
I want to add that you guys rock. This is one of my only sources of <br/>
support and I am so glad that it exists. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll be getting great responses from the list more after the<br/>
holiday weekend, but I did want to say that the above sentence really is an<br/>
important part of the equation, and that even in unschooling families, it is<br/>
not uncommon that typically (but not always) the father questions parts of<br/>
this philosophy, including the importance of a clean house. And you two do<br/>
need to get along, for your children as well as your own relationship. So,<br/>
some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
	-Tell your husband that there is something important that you would like to<br/>
talk to him about. Ask him when would be a good time for him. Prepare<br/>
yourself to speak particularly about this issue. Some ideas for the chat:<br/>
Let him know that you understand his desire for a clean house, and that<br/>
maybe you even have that desire too, but that you know that you are doing<br/>
your best, and if that isn&#39;t good enough, then you would like his help in<br/>
finding a way to get the house cleaner. Let him know that you are pretty<br/>
sure this is temporary, maybe a couple of years or so...that at your<br/>
children&#39;s young and needy ages, they really need most of your time and<br/>
energy. Let him know that you have researched and learned that responding to<br/>
children totally at their ages produces healthier and more independent<br/>
children later, and that you just don&#39;t want to take any chances with that.<br/>
Tell him you know in your soul that this is how it is supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
	-See if you can find a way to leave the children with your husband for a<br/>
day, or at least a few hours. This was always an eye-opener for dh...seems<br/>
there is a level of understanding and respect that couldn&#39;t happen<br/>
otherwise. Make a doctor&#39;s appointment or dentist appointment, add in lunch<br/>
or a movie (I know the kids come first, and maybe this feels like it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be the best scenario for them, but in the larger picture, it is for<br/>
them and you and their dad).<br/>
<br/>
	-See if you can creatively come up with some help...is there a college<br/>
nearby where a student might help with housecleaning or child care<br/>
inexpensively? We had a college student live in an extra bedroom (actually<br/>
not an extra bedroom, but we made do with 6 of us in two bedrooms so that we<br/>
could have the help), and she was a godsend.<br/>
<br/>
It can be a delicate walk unschooling (and in your case, attachment<br/>
parenting) and living happily with a spouse who doesn&#39;t quite<br/>
agree...sometimes it requires some compromising, with the larger vision<br/>
being the joy and health of your family. They need you both and preferably<br/>
together, and sometimes we have to give up a little to have the best overall<br/>
situation.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get more thoughts from the list for sure...<br/>

&gt; of pressure from my husband to keep up on it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Practical advice<br/>
1 - simplify a LOT. I think unschooling is enhanced when we do have  <br/>
lots of things, but, still, your kids will be better served by having  <br/>
fewer things if that means happier parents.<br/>
<br/>
2 - Have lots of bins and baskets around the house - wicker baskets  <br/>
right in the living room and kitchen and bathrooms where you can just  <br/>
put things throughout the day and can run around for a couple of  <br/>
minutes before your husband gets home and get everything off floors  <br/>
and furniture into the baskets.<br/>
<br/>
3 - Use paper plates and cups and plastic utensils throughout the day  <br/>
so you don&#39;t have dishes to deal with before you even start thinking  <br/>
about dinner.<br/>
<br/>
4 - Simplify food preparation by using convenience foods - packaged  <br/>
salad, frozen foods, bags of carrots. Use boil-in-the-bag rice (Uncle  <br/>
Bens boil in the bag brown rice is great) - easy-to-clean pans. Lunch  <br/>
can be a bag of carrots, whole wheat crackers, and ranch dressing to  <br/>
dip them into. Put them out on paper plates - let kids eat when  <br/>
hungry. Don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; breakfast or lunch - provide convenient snack  <br/>
stuff, instead. Don&#39;t make pots and pans or mixing bowls, etc.,  <br/>
dirty, and you won&#39;t have to wash them.  Frozen foods are often  <br/>
nutritious - don&#39;t disregard them thinking that they&#39;re not. Yes, you  <br/>
can eat cheaper if you make everything from scratch - but the extra  <br/>
cost will be worth it if you end up happier. Cereal, fruit, milk are  <br/>
easy - serve in paper bowls with plastic spoons.<br/>
<br/>
5 - Get a mother&#39;s helper to come in a couple of times per week for a  <br/>
couple of hours. She/he spends time playing with the kids while you  <br/>
clean in ways you just can&#39;t get to with the kids needing you every  <br/>
other minute. (They&#39;ll still need you some, but you can probably get  <br/>
enough time to clean the whole toilet without interruption &lt;G&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
6 - Even better, get a housekeeper to come in for half day once a  <br/>
week. This is a HUGE HUGE wonderful thing - in a half-day the  <br/>
housekeeper can do a lot. Yes, you&#39;ll have to clean up the clutter to  <br/>
some degree before the housekeeper can do a good job. If you do it  <br/>
every week, it won&#39;t be nearly as big a deal as you might think and  <br/>
SO worth it. Leave the house to go play at the park for half a day  <br/>
and come home to it being clean. Your husband might not think the  <br/>
money is going to be well spent - ask him to try it for a month or  <br/>
two, at least, then you can reconsider. Ask for it as a birthday  <br/>
present or maybe a belated mother&#39;s day present!  My mom gave me  <br/>
housekeeping services occasionally - for my birthday. Very nice gift!!<br/>
<br/>
7. Little habits are all-important. Don&#39;t think big or you might be  <br/>
overwhelmed. Just do one thing and then another - little bits count.  <br/>
You will be amazed at how much less time cleaning up takes than what  <br/>
you probably think. Load or unload the top rack of the dishwasher  <br/>
while you wait for toast to pop up or while something is in the  <br/>
microwave for 1 minute. Later do the bottom rack. Never go anywhere  <br/>
empty-handed - when you go from one room to another, take something  <br/>
with you - at least move things in the right direction &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
8 - have lots of trash cans around the house. Make it almost as easy  <br/>
to put trash into a trash can as it is to leave it around.<br/>
<br/>
9 - spend lots of time outdoors. If you&#39;re not in the house, it won&#39;t  <br/>
get as messy. Go places.<br/>
<br/>
10 - ???<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1623611374">I pay my sister to come and clean every 2 weeks and she does things <br/>
like sweep and mop, vacuum and clean the bathroom. It is definitely <br/>
a load off of my shoulders. But the house still gets pretty trashed <br/>
in between. I dont mind the toys being everywhere, what bothers me <br/>
is the dirt. <br/>
I have been simplifying alot. I used to use cloth daipers on my 2 yr <br/>
old and 8 mo old but I recently switched to the seventh generation <br/>
brand. I found that the only laundry I was doing was daipers every <br/>
day. And I just started using paper plates, actually picked up some <br/>
paper bowls earlier. And started planning our menu with more frozen <br/>
foods. I was cooking gourmet meals but the kids didnt really like <br/>
them. I was trying to get my fix for cooking b/c I love to cook. But <br/>
it just ended up being pointless in the end with expensive grocery <br/>
bills, a big mess to clean and food that no one really liked but <br/>
me.  The kids like everything really plain. Pasta, Brown rice, Baked <br/>
Chicken, Chicken nuggets so that is what I returned to getting. It <br/>
was worth the try. At least I know now. The boil in the bag rice <br/>
rocks it only takes 8 min to cook rather than 45 min.<br/>
I am really trying to make this work. <br/>
I have been more observant and available to my 2yr old and have <br/>
really been applying the distraction method. It has been working <br/>
very well. And realizing when he is done being social and giving him <br/>
some personal space. That advice helped me alot. Sometimes I am at a <br/>
loss for ideas on things to distarct him with but I am sure I will <br/>
get more creative as time goes by. Sometimes things happen so <br/>
quickly but I am doing my best to work with it.<br/>
You guys are awesome. Thanks again for all your help. <br/>

the older siblings are a/b half and half in their attitude towards <br/>

toys, knocks things down and hits. But I do try to explain to them <br/>
that he is still a baby and doesnt understand. I use my baby sling <br/>
as much as I can with my 8 mo old but it will just kill my back if I <br/>
wear it too long. Yes, I do put it on right and it&#39;s the only one <br/>
she will use b/c she can face forward. <br/>
But I have decied to make more of an effort to be there wth him as <br/>
much as I can and try to stop it before it happens. I got all my <br/>
paper plates and bowls, finger foods blah blah blah and I have <br/>
simplified alot to apply this. <br/>
These kind of things would happen usually when I wasin the kitchen <br/>
preparing/cleaning up from a meal, doing luandry and pretty much <br/>
whenever I wasnt around. <br/>
Im glad you brought up the other kids b/c they are having a hard <br/>
time with this. And like I said, I really didnt know what to do a/b <br/>
it. Im trying to figure out the best way to do all this. As it is <br/>
still all pretty new to me. And I am so grateful for the advice from <br/>

  My dd was the same when she was a babe (always curious about the world &lt;g&gt;).  This was far and away the best sling I ever used!  I used it until she was just over 2 years old.  It saves your back, because it puts the kiddo&#39;s weight on your hips.<br/>

<br/>
My husband and I had a hiker&#39;s backpack for carrying a baby/toddler  <br/>
and we used it LOTS, at home and out and about.  I walked Marty and  <br/>
Holly to sleep many, many times, and then just came back and slipped  <br/>
the pack off onto the couch (it had a stand) and then took them  out  <br/>
gently, or sometimes left them there a while if others were still in  <br/>
the room to be near them (lean the pack against the back of the  <br/>
couch, so their heads are still up against something soft, or lay the  <br/>
pack face down--just can&#39;t leave them in the pack all alone in the  <br/>
room).<br/>
<br/>
They could see, hold things, look around, touch us, hear us, feel us,  <br/>
and we could still do all kinds of things with our own arms.  It kept  <br/>
them right with other people, but not right down on the ground with  <br/>
other kids, dogs, cactus, whatever the problem of the moment might  <br/>
have been.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-869480468">Thanks for the link. I checked it out. Can the baby move their arms <br/>
freely in that? It looked kinda bulky. I sit Nani in the Maya wrap <br/>
face forward witj her legs folded indian style. She can move her <br/>
upper body freely and will even fall asleep in that position. But Im <br/>
not too sure of how she&#39;d react to something that would confine her. <br/>
I&#39;ve tried a few different slings with her-she definitely knows what <br/>
she likes. Thanks again for the link.  <br/>

  They show a very young babe in it on the first page.  If you go to the photographs link (on the right) they show some older babies in it.  My dd has always been tall/long so she never had a problem with her head being too low down (I haven&#39;t heard of this as being a common problem).  It&#39;s actually really adjustable and all soft padding, no metal bits or buckles.  My dd never had a problem moving around in it &lt;g&gt;.  All my friends (in the UK) got this sling, especially if they had tried a snuggli or similar before.<br/>
