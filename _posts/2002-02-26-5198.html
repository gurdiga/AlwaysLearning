<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; IMO it&#39;s the fear, anger, and the personal attacks that is more of a <br/>
&gt; problem than the purity of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When I was in a charter program, someone said in my hsing group once said, to <br/>
my face, &quot;How can you let your own greed put all other homeschoolers at <br/>
risk?&quot; Nice. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve hsed under a regular public school program, a charter school program, a <br/>
private school program, by filing as a private school myself, and finally <br/>
just doing nothing - going &quot;underground.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We could be radical unschoolers under each of those options. We could get <br/>
some pretty nice materials from the charter school - I got a soil testing kit <br/>
that I just stumbled across the other day - we never got around to using it. &lt;<br/>
g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there are two reasons for the hostility against the people who join <br/>
public programs:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Most of the people who oppose them think that taking money from the <br/>
government is pretty close to selling your soul to the devil (for a soil <br/>
testing kit? &lt;G&gt;). They are political extremists - opposed to government <br/>
funding of education at all. Want to see any government funding of schooling <br/>
of any kind completely eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
2. Many also see a slippery slope - they are afraid that someday legislators <br/>
are going to outlaw any homeschooling except through public schools. They <br/>
think that the hsers who enroll in those programs voluntarily are paving the <br/>
way for that to occur.<br/>
<br/>
Like Tia said about her province, it isn&#39;t what we&#39;ve seen in California. We <br/>
see many people stepping out of regular school into the public hsing programs <br/>
and then into independent hsing. I talked to a woman just this morning who is <br/>
in a public school program and is going to become indepdent after this year. <br/>
The public school programs are, to some degree, acting as <br/>
transition-to-independent-homeschooling stepping stones. <br/>
<br/>
If they were eliminated, a lot more people would feel stuck in public schools <br/>
and never make the jump to homeschooling. I know so MANY kids who have been <br/>
rescued from regular schooling by going into one of the ps programs.<br/>
<br/>
But - again, that argument won&#39;t hold up to people who outschool the schools <br/>
with their own kids at home --- they aren&#39;t opposed to schooling, they&#39;re <br/>
opposed to government funding of it.<br/>
