<div id="ygrps-yiv-126566794">The discussion of choices is interesting, and isn&#39;t new, and will  <br/>
continue to come up forever, because there&#39;s always someone new to the  <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
Part of being a child&#39;s partner, in my opinion and experience, is not  <br/>
deciding years in advance what that child will or won&#39;t want to do.   <br/>
We can have hopes and dreams, but can we make declarations?  I would  <br/>
like for Marty to never smoke cigarettes, but his girlfriend smokes,  <br/>
and he has occasionally.  If he starts to smoke, can I still love  <br/>
him?  It depends in part how strongly I&#39;ve stated my objections or  <br/>
prejudices or intentions.<br/>
<br/>
This is a quote made anonymous.  I&#39;m using my own son&#39;s name in the  <br/>
spot of someone else&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Okay, its world war three, and as usual, Iâ€™m in the thick of things.  <br/>
This time, it is the declaration that Marty will not go to school. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s say the for discussion purposes, Marty is less than a year old.<br/>
<br/>
Someone asked me to explain, a week or so ago, what I meant when I  <br/>
said negativity was bad for children.  If it&#39;s &quot;world war  <br/>
three&quot; (figuratively speaking) and the mom is, as usual, in the thick  <br/>
of things, how much peace can Marty be having?<br/>
<br/>
We started unschooling when Marty was two and a half.  Kirby was newly  <br/>
five.  When people asked about it, we said Kirby wasn&#39;t going to  <br/>
school, but Marty might, later, if he wanted to.  We figured Marty  <br/>
might want to.<br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t a decision I made for Marty two years or four years in  <br/>
advance.  And it was NOT world war three!  It was happy Kirby and  <br/>
Marty world. It was moment by moment sweetness that was not all about  <br/>
me and what I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
What came of that, over days and months and years was that each of my  <br/>
children chose to stay home with me.  Not one of them could have  <br/>
chosen that if he or she hadn&#39;t had any choice.<br/>
<br/>
At the heart of what we&#39;re talking about--all this unschooling, all  <br/>
this parenting, is the deep value of partnership and choices.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1336226564">Interesting take on my words. Leads to much reflection. Interesting the<br/>
assumptions I already make on his behalf.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn&#39;t realized how they appear to someone who doesn&#39;t know me. I agree<br/>
with much of what you said. I&#39;m going to look like a fool if Nisarga wants<br/>
to go to school. Its not impossible - kids are supposed to be unpredictable<br/>
(talk of oxymoron). I guess, if that is what he wants, it would be fine.<br/>
Just seems unlikely that a child would choose school over joining parents in<br/>
travel and adventure; play and computers. That would also be the end of my<br/>
wanderlust days :D Or perhaps they have ended already, and I&#39;m just raising<br/>
ghosts...<br/>
<br/>
The other possibility is that the little guy may not want to go to school,<br/>
but the outdoors could bore him... I&#39;d still be landed solidly home.<br/>
<br/>
That would be then, and I imagine I&#39;d follow his choice of life adventure,<br/>
complete with landing up at the same place day after day. At least that is<br/>
the intention.<br/>
<br/>
No point getting into too many castles in the air for fun. What if unfun<br/>
panned out? From experience, I know that I&#39;d go with the flow, but... it<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be as much fun as &#39;my choice&#39;. Hmm...<br/>

<br/>
Kids aren&#39;t so unpredictable to people who know them well, but it  <br/>
seems a little early to decide his life for him.  There&#39;s your vision  <br/>
for his life and there&#39;s your mother in law&#39;s, neither of which seems  <br/>
to be taking into consideration what he might want to do.  But there&#39;s  <br/>
still time.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that you&#39;ve created something to argue about when there  <br/>
was no reason to argue about it at all.   And the argument came to  <br/>
this list, when there was no reason to argue about it at all anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If that&#39;s what he wants&quot; isn&#39;t the problem.  If a mother makes a  <br/>
decision the child needs to try to counteract, they&#39;re not partners.   <br/>
If the only way the child &quot;wins&quot; is to make a decision that goes  <br/>
against his mother&#39;s pre-stated preference, one wins and one loses.   <br/>
Being partners, waiting to get to know your child and see what he  <br/>
wants is a different world from setting a path (however traditional or  <br/>
radical) and then trying to steer him on it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s putting the mother&#39;s needs and desires before the child&#39;s.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not a good long range plan to make unschooling work well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-718025388">&quot;If a mother makes a decision the child needs to try to counteract, they&#39;re<br/>

<br/>
You seem to see this as a rather dishonest process of &quot;setting up&quot; the child<br/>
for something that will need counteracting for him to act from a place for<br/>
freedom. What is happening here is a process of sharing my resolve and my<br/>
attitude on the subject of his education with people who play important<br/>
roles in his life. It is completely here and now, and has nothing to do with<br/>
what he decides, which will be his decision. I can&#39;t make it for him, and<br/>
I&#39;m not making it for him.<br/>
<br/>
In this case, what seems to you a decision the child will need to<br/>
counteract, to someone living in that situation is simply telling people to<br/>
lay off the traditional discipline and milestones and teaching<br/>
merry-go-round and open their minds to the fact that there is something<br/>
different coming up, and that someone feels strongly about it. It is the act<br/>
of putting it on the table, refusing to see it removed, talking about it,<br/>
describing, sharing, challenging conventional views, sharing some ground<br/>
rules that apply right now - school or not - freedom of learning, for<br/>
example - whether it is fist in drooly mouth or taking apart toy engines.<br/>
Its like saying a lot of yes. Its an attitude change. They need to go<br/>
through a process of acceptance with a drastically different idea. All the<br/>
argument has provided a way for us to find a working merge of minds.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t see this the same as making a decision the child needs to<br/>
counteract. Plans are plans, recommendations are recommendations, actions<br/>
are actions. I had planned on exclusive breastfeeding for the first six<br/>
months. The doctor recommends to give him a taste of light pureed stuff to<br/>
&quot;get him used to it&quot;. What is actually playing out, and unanimously in the<br/>
house is that he will show interest when he is ready. No disagreement,<br/>
though earlier there had been plenty. I see this possible only because we<br/>
can face storms head on when we spot them on the horizon rather than throw<br/>
the child around through conflicting actions by not looking at differences<br/>
when we could.<br/>
<br/>
Without that earlier &quot;declaration of breastfeeding for 6 months at least&quot;<br/>
and the ensuing flurry of advice, debates and what not, today, I would be<br/>
getting stressed trying to keep the MIL from sneaking him tastes of solids,<br/>
the husband from feeling pressured and unsure about what happens and when,<br/>
myself from the pressure of breastfeeding a growing child till a certain<br/>
date, rather than needs.... We looked at all sides of the coin and arrived<br/>
together at this place where he gets to breastfeed as long as possible,<br/>
exclusively as long as he doesn&#39;t show interest in other stuff, or I have<br/>
adequate milk, and feed him at whatever pace comes without stress.<br/>
<br/>
Today, there is movement from &quot;your mother is depriving you of education&quot; to<br/>
&quot;Your mother has crazy ideas&quot;. I am hoping to see us being able to work to a<br/>
place of acceptance for what unfolds according to his desires. If rather<br/>
than declaring that he will not go to school, I say that he will go to<br/>
school only if he wants it, no one is going to accept it - &quot;kids have to<br/>
accept grown up decisions&quot; is their mental model - he&#39;ll have the entire<br/>
world on his case trying to brainwash him into asking for school. If I do<br/>
nothing about it, this storm is going to burst when he is capable of<br/>
understanding the many words being thrown around about his future and his<br/>
mother and with a decision to make riding on his neck, where he will be<br/>
under a lot of pressure to decide. I don&#39;t think it would be fair on him.<br/>
Maybe I might be unintentionally making a decision he would have to<br/>
counteract, but he&#39;ll find plenty of support for that. On the other hand, if<br/>
I left him to make it without even creating acceptance for the possibility,<br/>
he would be facing the storm right along with me.<br/>
<br/>
I think our cultures are different. I understand that in the west it is<br/>
common for families to be completely autonomous and if others don&#39;t like,<br/>
they can stay away. It is not possible for me to alienate family, not just<br/>
culturally, but I see it as a process of throwing the baby with the<br/>
bathwater to let disagreements come in the way of a child getting that<br/>
special relationship that grandparents bring in his life. Crazy, but equally<br/>
true, I couldn&#39;t alienate them through anything I do - they will not get<br/>
alienated either, just hurt. I must manage responses with minimal damage to<br/>
my child and everyone, and maximum possibilities left open.<br/>
<br/>
I understand your concern that it is too early to decide his life for him<br/>
and agree. What is happening in that post you quoted is no decision on his<br/>
life, but a process of creating space for his freedom by getting the &#39;storm&#39;<br/>
out of the way. That blog is mostly read by family and friends. It is a way<br/>
of getting the word out, of removing the shame and illegitimacy of not going<br/>
to school before my child is old enough to have pressure from these<br/>
&#39;stigmas&#39; that forces him to conform.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you agree, then the rest of what your wrote on at length about was <br/>
superfluous.<br/>
<br/>
Please note the use of the word &quot;If&quot; in both what Sandra wrote and what <br/>
I wrote. Go back and read both our statements above, please.<br/>
<br/>
You completely ignored the &quot;if&quot; and went on and on as if Sandra had <br/>
said, to you, &quot;You will not be partners with your child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you read more carefully, you would maybe have said to yourself, &quot;Ah, <br/>
Sandra is pointing out that &#39;if&#39; I make a decision the child needs to <br/>
try to counteract....then I&#39;d be setting us up as adversaries, rather <br/>
than partners. That seems true &quot;IF&quot; I was doing that. I wonder if I am <br/>
making decisions the child will feel he needs to counteract, later.&quot; And <br/>
you would PONDER that question, all by yourself, in your own head. And, <br/>
&quot;IF&quot; you don&#39;t feel you&#39;re doing that, you&#39;ll just think, to yourself, <br/>
that you&#39;re not doing that, and you&#39;ll move on because it doesn&#39;t apply <br/>
to YOU. And if, as you ponder, you think, &quot;I might be doing that, so I <br/>
should become more aware of the possibility,&quot; then it might apply to you <br/>
and now you know it and you can move on with that understanding. And if, <br/>
as you ponder, you think, &quot;Oh dear - that DOES apply to me and I should <br/>
stop doing that,&quot; then you have become aware of a problem and you can <br/>
change it and move on.<br/>
<br/>
The ONLY reason you would need to respond here on this list would be if <br/>
you wish to discuss the statement itself - the IDEA of whether or not <br/>
the statement makes sense or why it does or doesn&#39;t make sense - as an <br/>
idea - not whether it applies to you, personally, in your own life. You <br/>
don&#39;t need to defend your own decisions here - those are yours to make.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve noticed something about people who write in glowing ideals and in <br/>
flowing and lovely imagery, that the thinking ability, their analytical <br/>
ability, can benefit a lot if they make a conscious decision to speak <br/>
with more simple clarity.  It is an exercise that is useful. The glowing <br/>
idealism and beautiful imagery is wonderful for being inspiring - I&#39;m <br/>
not saying it is always a bad thing. I&#39;m saying that there is value to <br/>
be gained from going back to some of the stuff written like that and <br/>
chopping it down to the bare minimum - find the logic, or lack of logic, <br/>
in it. Some people don&#39;t read each word and go, instead, for an overall <br/>
feeling created by the stream of words. But this is a critical analysis <br/>
discussion list and we ask that people try to use words carefully - <br/>
we&#39;re not looking for poetic writing here, but for logical thinking.<br/>

I&#39;d like you to ponder on this idea that perhaps the lack of trying to feed him solids has very little to do with your &quot;declaration&quot; and much more to do with the reality of a healthy growing baby. And perhaps if she see&#39;s him being hungry she&#39;ll try to feed him because she loves him. I do not want you to write here about whether this is possible or not. I want you to think about it.<br/>

My kids are 10 and 8 and when asked about how long I plan to homeschool, I continue to say things like &quot;we&#39;re taking it year by year&quot; or &quot;as long as it works&quot;. I believe that was the advice I got here or on UnschoolingDiscussion. Maybe next time I&#39;m in India, I&#39;ll bring over my children as &quot;proof&quot; :-)<br/>
<br/>
I think you have started a storm that need not have been started for two more years. Sometimes it&#39;s easier to slide into homeschooling by saying things like &quot;not this year... We&#39;re not quite ready...&quot; It may feel dishonest, but sometimes it&#39;s worth maintaining peace.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1809529507">My kids haven chosen school and have withdrawn, but by age four they were<br/>
used to choices.  School looked good and had a prominent place in<br/>
literature, television, and movies.  Home based learning seemed unnamed and<br/>
was invisible.  They chose school and with a vegetarian mother chose meat,<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the comprehensive list of choices they made prior to age three:<br/>
They chose when to breastfeed; chose how much, what, and when they ate;<br/>
chose when to learn to sit up; when to fall asleep, when to crawl; when to<br/>
walk and when to learn to self-toilet.  They also chose how much clothing to<br/>
wear.  I learned to trust they knew when they were cold or hot or needed<br/>
something and they in turn trusted that I would take their needs seriously<br/>
so they were able to communicate them.  They also were all early talkers<br/>
with the youngest Crispin using two word sentences at eight months old--his<br/>
choice to talk and mine to listen.   By six months Rowan was choosing which<br/>
food to eat, and adeptly getting some of it to his mouth.  Marty started<br/>
grabbing at food before six months(banana, and avocado) and getting it to<br/>
his mouth.  Crispin learned to walk before nine months, well, he learned to<br/>
run actually:)  Rowan was writing out random letters of the alphabet by age<br/>
one and a half.  I always gave encouragment and opportunities.  I supplied<br/>
paper and writing supplies but I was expecting drawings, not letters!  In<br/>
truth I wasn&#39;t even expecting the drawings--I just thought it would be fun<br/>
to put colour on paper and offered him the supplies.<br/>
<br/>
They chose when to leave school, too.  But while they were in school I<br/>
fought for them, and we learned about empowerment and working with<br/>
bureaucracy.  I didn&#39;t enjoy the endless meetings and crazy circular<br/>
arguments in favor of report cards/homework or the school admin&#39;s refusal to<br/>
admit the bullying and mind games engaged in by both teachers and students.<br/>
But when we hit a wall my kids agreed leaving was a good option.  It was an<br/>
option I reminded them they had, but I supported their choices and worked<br/>
with them.<br/>

it wouldn&#39;t be as much fun as &#39;my choice&#39;. Hmm...**<br/>
<br/>
First, you&#39;re not talking about a choice (as in something real and current),<br/>
you&#39;re talking about a pipe dream.<br/>
You have a human child, not a pipe-dream-fulfiller. This childhood belongs<br/>
to *him* not to your dreams.<br/>
Nor is it fair that a mere few months into parenting, you already judge<br/>
differing opinions as less fun than your (future imagined) choices.<br/>
I&#39;ve been led down many a new path by many a new passion of my son&#39;s -- oh<br/>
my! They&#39;re not my passions, they are surely his & I am on his passion team.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve all had childhoods, they&#39;re over. This childhood is the child&#39;s very<br/>
own, one and only. This childhood is my one and only chance to be my kids<br/>
parent.<br/>
After acute parenting, your wunderlust will remain/return. Or not.<br/>
<br/>
**Just seems unlikely that a child would choose school over joining parents<br/>
in travel and adventure; play and computers. That would also be the end of<br/>
my wanderlust days :D Or perhaps they have ended already, and I&#39;m just<br/>
raising<br/>
ghosts...**<br/>
<br/>
Funny choice of words. I&#39;ll talk about some real ghosts ;)  It&#39;s unlikely<br/>
men die at 32, though my husband did. Or daughters at 9, like mine. Or mamas<br/>
when their kids are still young, like my friend Lisa, two years ago.  It<br/>
happens.<br/>
Shit happens.Shit happens and sometimes BIG choices are taken away. (as are<br/>
pipe dreams, they like to linger and sting, though, if you can&#39;t let go --<br/>
hence the above warning)<br/>
Doing the best with the right here right now is the ultimate gift to the<br/>
whole world. For real.  The world that counts, the one you live in with your<br/>
child.<br/>
No need to stir up extra shit over a tomorrow that may never come. NONE!<br/>
 Give that extra time and energy to looking into your child&#39;s face, smelling<br/>
their hair, truly appreciating their laughter.<br/>
Knowing what an honor it is to care so deeply and tenderly for one you&#39;ve<br/>
invited into this world, for just a moment of your life, for a tiny precious<br/>
blip of time.<br/>
It all matters.<br/>
