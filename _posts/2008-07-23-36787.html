<div id="ygrps-yiv-68080994">For my birthday, I asked for airfare for Kirby to come and visit, and  <br/>
for Holly to go visit him afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
Tonight he gets here at 6:17 to the airport, anyway.  Last time he  <br/>
visited, he had a checklist of eateries he had missed that he wanted  <br/>
to go to.  This time it&#39;s a list of friends.  So I had a list of  <br/>
people who might pick him up from the airport, to give him a head  <br/>
start on his planned get-togethers. The first choice&#39;s dad just died  <br/>
(Kirby&#39;s known the family his whole life) and she didn&#39;t feel ready  <br/>
to socialize yet.  The next one said yes, but called last night and  <br/>
can&#39;t get off work in time, but will come over here right after work  <br/>
to see him.  The third one will go and take another friend he hangs  <br/>
out with on Wednesdays, also a friend of Kirby&#39;s, so that&#39;s a two-for- <br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Those were my choices, not Kirby&#39;s, by the way.  He only knows  <br/>
someone will pick him up.  Holly did it last time.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;ll be here until Monday early evening when he and Holly go to  <br/>
Austin for his birthday on Tuesday the 29th.  She&#39;ll come back  <br/>
Thursday night she&#39;ll return and Kirby goes back to work Friday after  <br/>
a week off.    It&#39;s cool he has a job he can take time off from (I  <br/>
don&#39;t know how much is paid besides his birthday).   I&#39;m glad Keith  <br/>
could afford to give me such a cool gift!!<br/>
<br/>
Kirby moved last August and we told him we would save his room for a  <br/>
year in case he wanted to come back.  He&#39;s up for a promotion and is  <br/>
happy in Austin, so Holly has expanded into his room too.  She had  <br/>
already claimed his bathroom the week he left, and now she has put  <br/>
her bed in what was his bedroom, and her bedroom might become her  <br/>
computer room or storage or she&#39;s not sure what yet.  That&#39;s some  <br/>
luxury.  She has a suite.<br/>
<br/>
I offered to do the same for Marty downstairs--to give him the room  <br/>
between his bedroom and the bathroom, but he&#39;s declined.  It&#39;s my  <br/>
office currently.  There&#39;s another way to the bathroom (it has two  <br/>
doors).<br/>
<br/>
So we expand, and Kirby visits twice in a year.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m all new to this grown-offspring business.  Some of you have lots  <br/>
of experience.  Maybe you remember being excited by a visit. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-126145094">Happy Birthday, Sandra.<br/>
<br/>
What a great gift!  Visits are special and incredible.  I finally have been<br/>
able to work through the sadness I feel when Annie goes...but it still takes<br/>
me a few days (and the boys too).  We plan on being with friends those few<br/>
days after.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great that Kirby has found himself a comfy place to be!<br/>
