&lt;&lt; Sandra, how much would you charge for a pack of 365 index cards with hand<br/>
<br/>
written ideas on them? I&#39;m very serious. &gt;&gt;<br/>

You want to be the prototype test family?<br/>

I should just do that, huh?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1760619479">I got a &quot;homeschooling&quot; catalogue from Scholastic today, which I flipped<br/>
through briefly.  It seems to be mostly homework helper types of books, but<br/>
I did see one thing that reminded me of the request for index cards - 365<br/>
Things to Do on A Saturday.  The blurb says &quot;Make guacamole, perform daring<br/>
experiments, create your own pin hole camera and much, much more.  There is<br/>
no author listed, and I couldn&#39;t find it at Amazon, but I&#39;ll bet if you get<br/>
any of the Scholastic catalogues, you could order it from them.  It might be<br/>
a good stop gap until Sandra gets around to hers.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
