<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154909863">Since Retrouvaille (retrouvaille.org) has been mentioned a lot in the Unschooling forums for parents who need help with their marriage, I thought I would also pass along that the Catholic church has a marriage encounter program that appears to follow the same weekend format for couples who are NOT in distress.  <br/>
<br/>
The marriage encounter for married couples not in distress is called &quot;Worldwide Marriage Encounter&quot;.  The website is wwme.org, and I believe some state chapters also have their own website (mine does for Arizona).<br/>
<br/>
The weekend format appears to be the same as Retrouvaille, but there are not any scheduled follow-up meetings.  Instead, on the website there is a page for &quot;After Your Weekend&quot; suggestions.    <br/>
<br/>
The fee schedule also appears to be the same.  You are asked to pay an upfront registration fee, and during the weekend program you will be asked to give a freewill donation with the caveat that no couple is turned away if they cannot pay.  The only difference I noticed for my local chapter is that the registration fee is less for the WWME vs. Retrouvaille. <br/>
<br/>
I have taken Sandra&#39;s suggestion seriously to make my marriage a priority over unschooling.  Retrouvaille is mentioned a lot in unschooling forums, so I thought I would mention the Worldwide Marriage Encounter as a sister program to Retrouvaille for anyone who may, like myself, like the idea of a program similar to Retrouvaille, but feels Retrouvaille may not exactly fit your needs.</div>

Thanks.<br/>
People don&#39;t need to be Catholic to benefit from those things.<br/>

Lori Odhner has a site (Caring for Marriage), an annual conference (in Pennsylvania), and a free daily mailing (Marriage Moats), too, that might be helpful.<br/>

<br/>
Lori and her husband are fourth-or-more-generation members of a church called The Church of the New Jerusalem, and sometimes something comes up in one of the daily writings that&#39;s particular to that, but most of the ideas are &quot;religion neutral,&quot; and it&#39;s easy enough not to worry about the idea of what happens to marriage after death, and to use the practical thoughts and tools regardless of your personal philosophy.<br/>
I spoke at one of Lori&#39;s conferences, and have known her for Kirby Dodd&#39;s whole life (she and Carol Rice-McClure were my first La Leche League leaders).<br/>
