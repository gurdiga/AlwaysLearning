<div id="ygrps-yiv-447908531">THE VIRGIN BIRTH OF JESUS<br/>
Fact or fable?<br/>
<br/>
Quotations:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The day will come when the mystical generation of Jesus by the Supreme Being <br/>
as his father, in the womb of a virgin, will be classed with the fable of the <br/>
generation of Minerva in the brain of Jupiter.&quot; Thomas Jefferson, 1823. 1<br/>
<br/>
Disbelief in the virgin birth has been referred to by many early Christian <br/>
writers as: <br/>
&quot;madness and blasphemy&quot; by Gennadius, <br/>
&quot;madness&quot; by Origen,  <br/>
&quot;sacrilege&quot; by St. Ambrose,  <br/>
&quot;impiety and smacking of atheism&quot; by Philostorgius, <br/>
&quot;perfidy&quot; by St. Bede, <br/>
&quot;full of blasphemies&quot; by the author of Prædestin, <br/>
&quot;perfidy of the Jews&quot; by Pope Siricius, <br/>
&quot;heresy&quot; by St. Augustine.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Overview:<br/>
<br/>
From about 80 CE to the present time, most faith groups within the Christian <br/>
religion have taught that Jesus was conceived by his mother Mary, before she <br/>
engaged in sexual intercourse. Some groups have taught that Mary lived, gave <br/>
birth to Jesus and died while still a virgin. This is believed to have been <br/>
accomplished by the action of the Holy Spirit, without an act of sexual <br/>
intercourse.  <br/>
The Anglican Communion, Eastern Orthodoxy, Protestantism and Roman <br/>
Catholicism have taught various beliefs about the virgin birth. This doctrine <br/>
is usually called the virgin birth, although the term virgin conception would <br/>
be much more accurate. This has long been one of the church&#39;s foundational <br/>
beliefs, along with the inerrancy of the Bible, and the atonement, <br/>
resurrection and the anticipated second coming of Jesus. Church creeds have <br/>
mentioned it. <br/>
<br/>
Liberal theologians have generally rejected the virgin birth, and classify it <br/>
as a religious myth that was added to Christian belief to make the religion <br/>
more competitive with contemporary Pagan religions in the Mediterranean <br/>
region. <br/>
