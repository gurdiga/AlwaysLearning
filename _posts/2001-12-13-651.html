(16 and 14yog) and I am well aware of the sexual urge/desire whatever.<br/>
However, I trust them to make an informed decision.  With that trust comes<br/>
along with respect.  I expect them to respect my wishes.  I had a rule, my<br/>
husbands grandmother had a rule (with Joe and I) and it will be in force in<br/>
my house.  You sleep(with your partner) in the same bed in MY HOME when you<br/>
are married.  Does this mean I think you won&#39;t have sex any other place,<br/>
hell no.  Mind you I was one month shy of 21 when became active, I lived in<br/>
my parents until a week before I was married(age 24 1/2) ( barring a short<br/>
jaunt on my own) and had a curfew until marriage.  The curfew was mutually<br/>
agreed upon between my parents and I.  My parents were light sleepers and my<br/>
mother would be up all night worrying if I had been in a wreck, etc.  So, to<br/>
keep everyone happy we had a time we all agreed with - if I would be late, I<br/>
would call.  At the time, I was sure it was all about control and my lack of<br/>
it.  Now, after having children of my own, I completely understand.<br/>
<br/>
The girls and I have had some very frank discussions about sex,<br/>
responsibility and respect.  And I honestly do believe they respect my<br/>
wishes because I came right out with it instead of beating around the bush.<br/>
Mutual trust and mutual respect go hand in hand in our home.<br/>

teen, but it was very late because of my skating practise time.  And that <br/>
curfew stuck for any night I was out.  My kids have always seen dh and I <br/>
calling if we are going to be later than expected.  They know I expect the <br/>
same from them, but because it&#39;s a courtesy to the person sitting at home, <br/>
possibly worrying, not a control thing.<br/>
<br/>
I also can&#39;t see the need for a specific time every time.  More reasonable <br/>
would be a certain amount of time after an event to allow for travel time, <br/>
or a stop for a bite to eat or whatever.  I think courtesy is the most <br/>
important thing here.<br/>
