<div id="ygrps-yiv-500972152">Maybe it&#39;s not what, but where...<br/>
<br/>
Some Unschoolers who have a lot of unschooling facebook friends have  <br/>
posted some unschooling things there, and received bad responses.    <br/>
The easiest thing to do would be NOT to post radical unschooling  <br/>
business out in public that way.  When it&#39;s out of context it can come  <br/>
across and crazed or strident or goofy (or all three).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s one example, and it might be interesting for people who are  <br/>
looking for something to read while this list is kinda quiet.<br/>
<br/>
Katherine Anderson quoted Jenny Cyphers:<br/>
Katherine Anderson &quot;There is no need to discipline a kid if they are  <br/>
never put in a position where they must choose between what they feel  <br/>
is right and what they feel their parents think is right.&quot; �Jenny  <br/>
Cyphers<br/>

<br/>
I think people can see that without being on facebook; if not, sorry.<br/>
<br/>
And a few days ago someone linked the list of ways to screw up  <br/>
unschooling, and got some defensive responses too, and another  <br/>
unschooler picked it up (maybe more than one).  That one is way too  <br/>
radical for public consumption!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Can&#39;t find where, but it was this, quoted and linked:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/screwitup">http://sandradodd.com/screwitup</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(I couldn&#39;t find where it had been posted--anyone remember?  The  <br/>
responses were things like &quot;I don&#39;t even know what this means&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;Are you saying I&#39;m not a good unschooler if I don&#39;t have a TV? Where  <br/>
was that?)<br/>

that was on my facebook.  and although there were some poor responses, i do <br/>
think many people learn a lot from reading stuff they are &quot;almost&quot; ready for <br/>
in  their own lives...i have been told many times how much my facebook <br/>
friends  appreciate reading &quot;challenging&quot; stuff on my wall....<br/>

<br/>
There was some discussion in one of the chats, I think (or maybe it  <br/>
was a phone call) about whether we should warn people that if they do  <br/>
become radical unschoolers that they stand to lose some friends.     <br/>
There are times I don&#39;t bring up what I do or don&#39;t do with my kids  <br/>
because it might seem insulting or rude or a buzzkill, as it were.   <br/>
Christmas Eve at Marty&#39;s girlfriend&#39;s parents&#39; house, for instance.   <br/>
They like Marty a lot.  That&#39;s enough information for now.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I just go for it, to the wall, and let people pass out or  <br/>
sputter in shock and indignation. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
Never the week before Christmas, though.<br/>
<br/>
See, if it&#39;s not too radical then it&#39;s not.   It was too radical for  <br/>
some of those who came across it.<br/>

I save  my more radical thinkings/doings for park-days, conference and such...I love Facebook, and though a lot of my facebook friends are unschooler...about half are not.  I did notice the other day the new feature when you post...there is a button that you can choose who can see that post...maybe abit time consuming...I usually will just send a note...if it&#39;s something I don&#39;t want to share with all.<br/>

<br/>
#  Don&#39;t collaborate.***<br/>
<br/>
    * &quot;Unparent&quot;give kids &quot;free reign&quot; without talking to them re: appropriateness of their actions (affecting others and others&#39; property).<br/>
    * Don&#39;t help your kid understand the ways of the world and boundaries and what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong.<br/>
    * When they have a disagreement, let them work things out themselves with no input from you.<br/>
    * Do not prepare them ahead of time for anything new they may encounter. Let them deal with it on their own.<br/>
    * Have the idea that unschooling is just allowing your kids to walk all over others because they feel like it and well you don&#39;t want to run their lives! <br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
I could add -- and defend non-collaboration (is that a word?) as &#39;respecting their authenticity&#39;, which seems to be the new catch phrase for doing nothing while one kid violates another.<br/>
<br/>
It seems lately, people are unparenting and I think it keeps newcomers from really embracing unschooling.  It also makes it more challenging for me to defend it to my husband, Gary, who totally gets unschooling, but has very specific ideas of what constitutes &#39;unparenting&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
In some respects, it does give me opportunities for object lessons to discuss with our boys, but sometimes it also complicates play with friends.  Often I hear the phrase &quot;there&#39;s no one right way to unschool&quot; as a defense, which shuts down debate pretty effectively.  I mean, if someone feels there&#39;s no &#39;right&#39; way to do something, they can call it whatever they want.  Labels become useless -- which might be a good thing.  <br/>
<br/>
All I&#39;ve really been able to come up with is to stick closer to my kids and help them be more aware of what&#39;s going on, how Gary & I feel about it, and what we expect from them. <br/>
<br/>
And I love the word collaboration --I&#39;ve been using guidance or advice, but I wasn&#39;t really crazy about either one in that context.  So thanks for the term, Sandra & Joyce!<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, well...<br/>
If I were going door to door asking people if they wanted to know more  <br/>
about unschooling, I might feel guilty.  I&#39;m not.  I&#39;m staying in  <br/>
contact with a whole bunch of families and gathering data and  <br/>
experience and evidence and anecdotes about what has worked and what  <br/>
has NOT worked.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t anybody reveal any names or sources, because I didn&#39;t want any  <br/>
when I first heard and I don&#39;t want any now.  Seriously.  This is a  <br/>
story without names because I don&#39;t know the names.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was recently on some other unschooling list.  I don&#39;t know  <br/>
what list but because I was offered details and names, I believe my  <br/>
source.  This was a someone who had overtly at some point in the past  <br/>
assured me and anyone else who would listen/read that my ideas and  <br/>
assertions were no better than anyone else&#39;s (some form of that) and  <br/>
pooh on me (some version of that).  Years passed.  Reportedly, then,  <br/>
she was back asking other unschoolers for help with her older kids  <br/>
(teens?  Young teens?) because things hadn&#39;t gone well.  And I was  <br/>
told that the advice she was being given was same old &quot;common  <br/>
knowledge&quot; and that if she&#39;d listened and done those things years back  <br/>
she would have had the close relationship with her kids that others of  <br/>
us had been confident about.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more than one way to unschool.  Some ways work better than  <br/>
others.  Just because there&#39;s no &quot;one right way&quot; doesn&#39;t mean that all  <br/>
ways are equally good.  People get confused about that.  Just because  <br/>
there&#39;s more than one way to determine or notate what twice five is,  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t mean that 13 and 8 and 127 are all twice five.  One way  <br/>
or another, it&#39;s going to be ten (or maybe 55 &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
  Just because there are many truths doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no such  <br/>
thing as bullshit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-5526979">Hi, I&#39;m new to the list and haven&#39;t felt I had anything to offer yet, but<br/>
*this* I can comment on!  You can create &quot;lists&quot; of your FB friends to make<br/>
privacy selection in one step (for a group of people) rather than 10 steps<br/>
(for 10 different people). I have groups of friends, family members,<br/>
community groups, school friends, and a few others - including one called<br/>
&quot;privacy restricted&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
To create the lists, click on the Friends link at the top of the FB screen.<br/>
Select &quot;All Connections&quot; in the list on the left.  At the top of the list of<br/>
your friends should be a link &quot;Create new list&quot;.  Give it a name, and then<br/>
start adding people.  You seem to be able to create a limitless numbers of<br/>
lists, and each friend can be on any number (or none) of your lists.  To<br/>
select the settings for each list, go to &quot;Settings&quot; at the top right of<br/>
screen (near the log out), and select privacy settings.  At that page, there<br/>
are 5 sub categories, and each of them has a number of categories as well...<br/>
you can go through and select &quot;customise&quot; for those settings, and you can<br/>
choose to make things visible to or hide things from certain lists of<br/>
people.  It sounds a little convoluted, and will take a bit of time, but it<br/>
is worth it if you have people on your friends list who are likely to be<br/>
offended (and you don&#39;t want to cause offense) or if there are people on<br/>
your friends list that you choose not to share everything with for any<br/>
reason.<br/>

I&#39;ve heard Moms defend what sounds like that.  My choice is to believe that my children will some day (perhaps even today) &#39;authentically&#39; want to be kind, thoughtful people who can maintain friendships, and sometimes my two cents worth can help them be more kind and thoughtful.  <br/>

Hey now, are you calling me crazed and goofy? (just kidding)<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been visiting facebook lately, actually haven&#39;t even checked my mail in a while, there were almost 100 unread emails in my inbox just now... WOW!<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;ll just say that I rarely post radical unschooling things on facebook because I don&#39;t want any sort of weirdness with all my family members that would most likely not appreciate it whatsoever.  I will however occasionally defend others who put up nice unschooling comments that get bashed.<br/>
<br/>
That particular quote being mentioned is part of a blog post that, even in context, most maintstream parents wouldn&#39;t get or agree with.  Not even my own sister who knows me very well, and I&#39;m not afraid to offend, didn&#39;t like my blog post and commented as such on it.  It&#39;s an oldish one because I haven&#39;t been updating my blog because I&#39;ve been busy and unable to take the time to write there.  It&#39;s here in context if anyone wants to read it.  I mean every thing I said in that post about trusting my kids too!  <br/>
<br/>
and since I&#39;ve been cyber absent, I have no idea about the other quote or where it happened or what it was.<br/>

+++++++++++++++++++++++<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for posting this Sylvia. I ran into this very thing at a conference<br/>
earlier this year that left me disturbed.<br/>
 <br/>
There was a room full of board games and toys and video games that kids<br/>
could hang out in while parents attended the talks. My son was happy to hang<br/>
out there and I was glad that this year I would get to attend more of the<br/>
chats and hear the speakers! I usually took him to the room and helped him<br/>
find a friend to play with or most likely he would just sit down and start<br/>
watching some of the older kids play wii and say Bye Mom!<br/>
 <br/>
However much I wanted to hear someone speak, I still had to make sure my son<br/>
was OK. It seemed many parents left their kids unattended in that room and<br/>
it wasn&#39;t always hunky dory for everyone, especially the youngest kids. A<br/>
few times I was the only adult in the room and a group of younger kids<br/>
complained to me that the older boys had been playing the games for hours<br/>
without letting anyone else play. I watched for a while (I think the younger<br/>
kids couldn&#39;t tell when the characters died, so if the players clicked fast<br/>
it was easy to trick the younger ones into thinking the game just went on<br/>
and it was never their turn) so when one round was over, before they could<br/>
start another or continue, I stopped them and asked the boys who were<br/>
playing if they could start a rotation to let some of the others play. Give<br/>
more kids a chance to play instead of just watching. They had been watching<br/>
for hours and all wanted a turn. I suggested one of them oversee the<br/>
rotation, but there should be a line on each side (2 controllers, about 8-10<br/>
kids), and when you die, you go to the end of the line. That seemed to work;<br/>
the older boys still got to play longer because they were better and didn&#39;t<br/>
die as fast, but now everyone seemed happy because at least they got a turn.<br/>
I envisioned them making friends, but maybe none of them cared about that,<br/>
just a turn!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
But here is the bigger problem we ran into. Damon (who at the time was 4 and<br/>
11 months old and yes, already into legos) was upset because there was a kid<br/>
guarding a pile of legos and not letting anyone else play. He had left the<br/>
room crying to me twice so I went in with him to mediate if necessary. I had<br/>
assumed all things in the room were there for community sharing, so how<br/>
could one kid tell all the other kids they could not touch the legos? There<br/>
was no one there so we started building with the legos. Then a kid not much<br/>
bigger than mine showed up and started yelling at him to get away from the<br/>
legos. He was frantic! I told him I thought that everything in this room was<br/>
here for everyone to share and he said NO! These are MY legos and I don&#39;t<br/>
want to share them! Hmmm.... then why didn&#39;t he just keep them in his room<br/>
and how did they get here? He said his mom dumped them here and won&#39;t let<br/>
him take them back! <br/>
 <br/>
Then I understood what that was like from his perspective. He was afriad<br/>
other kids were going to steal his legos and take them home, so he was<br/>
sitting there guarding his stuff! (Seemed like something MY mom would have<br/>
done, NOT an unschooling mom, at least not without consulting with her son<br/>
about the purpose of dumping his toys in that room.) I said none of the kids<br/>
would take the legos home, they only wanted to sit and build while they were<br/>
here. Same for the board games, you play here, and leave it here. Then<br/>
another boy came along and since he already knew the lego owner, he was<br/>
allowed to play. My son was still being told not to touch and said he wanted<br/>
to leave. <br/>
 <br/>
So I tried to bond with and make peace with this child. I told him that<br/>
there were a lot of lego fans at the conference and he could make some new<br/>
friends by sharing his love of legos instead of scaring kids away. Then<br/>
another small boy sat down and his dad sat with him. It didn&#39;t take long to<br/>
figure out he was there to do what I was doing! It seemed his son (along<br/>
with mine and dozens of others) had been yelled at and told not to touch the<br/>
legos and had left the room crying at least twice. So there we all sat. I<br/>
asked the boy his name and how old he was. He was 5, turning 6 in June. I<br/>
said Damon&#39;s birthday is in June too. The boy asked how far away June was<br/>
and I said it was coming soon, in just a few days, but June was 30 days long<br/>
so his birthday could be soon or in a month. So we got all the other boys to<br/>
say their names and ages and of course they were all about the same age. And<br/>
of course they all loved legos. I got them talking about Star Wars, another<br/>
hit. Soon they were all talking and laughing. I felt good about helping them<br/>
become friends. I made sure I told Damon that he could not take any of the<br/>
legos back to our room and the other boy seemed OK after that.<br/>
 <br/>
I ended up missing a talk I had really wanted to hear, but this seemed more<br/>
important. I found the boy&#39;s mother (SHE had gone to the talk! grrrrr) and<br/>
told her what had been going on for 2 days, that her son was making enemies<br/>
and guarding his legos. Did she ask him if it was OK with him to dump his<br/>
legos in there? No. She said it was for his own good. I believe she thought<br/>
it would help him make new friends, but she hadn&#39;t given it much thought<br/>
into how that might happen. She sure didn&#39;t sit in there and help! She also<br/>
didn&#39;t want to hear about the other kids who had left crying (while I was<br/>
talking to the dad, several other kids walked in and saw all the kids<br/>
playing with legos and seeing adults there asked us if it was OK to play,<br/>
saying they had been told to go away before, and another mom told me the<br/>
same story about her daughter), she said that was life and kids had to<br/>
figure out how to work things out on their own. Like that&#39;s how things are<br/>
in the real world or something. I felt like she was throwing her son to the<br/>
wolves! She did the same sort of thing at the pool, she sat in the corner of<br/>
the patio chatting with another mom while both of them ignored their kids<br/>
and any turmoil they were having (or causing!) in the water.<br/>
 <br/>
I was just so shocked, I didn&#39;t know what to say to her or how to process<br/>
what she did. I asked my friend J (you can chime in here if you want!) what<br/>
she thought of the situation. I was worried maybe there was something about<br/>
unschooling that I didn&#39;t get, but she agreed with me that the mom should<br/>
have asked her son if he might like to share his legos. Or at least helped<br/>
him navigate the social aspects of the conference. He was only 5 for crying<br/>
out loud!<br/>
 <br/>
Anyway, I still think about that mom and son and wonder how they&#39;re doing. I<br/>
also wonder if we&#39;ll see them at the conference next year and if things will<br/>
be the same or different.<br/>

We&#39;ve been to only two conferences, and our policy is that either Gary or I stay near our boys to be available for help if we&#39;re needed.  It&#39;s the primary reason I won&#39;t go to a conference with our kids but without Gary.  Maybe once they&#39;re both teens, but not while they&#39;re young enough to still need help navigating the social scene. I can see, tho, where it would be easy to leave kids in a situation where things can get overwhelming for the kids, and without help from parents unkindness happens pretty often. <br/>
<br/>
If the Mom just told him he&#39;d be sharing his legos with anyone who might come by, then left him to fend for himself, that created a bad situation. <br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes at conferences, where people have paid out something like $1000 for fees, hotel room & meals, etc, there can be an urgency to be sure one doesn&#39;t miss any of the important talks.  It can be hard to spend the entire weekend &#39;just&#39; playing or hanging out with your child and feel like you got your money&#39;s worth. <br/>

Well, perhaps she needed that talk a whole lot more than you did!<br/>
 <br/>
The thing about conferences is that not everyone there is unschooling.  Some people go because they are curious or considering it, some people go because they want to, but they don&#39;t quite know how yet.  Some people go ONLY to socialize, while others go with the motive of seeing and hearing every speaker, while others go so their kids or themselves can meet other unschoolers.  And some people go for a wide mix of all of that!<br/>

and some come thinking they are the epitomy of radical unschoolers, whose kids can just be let loose  alone, at a conference, and they don&#39;t even see what&#39;s happening.  at that same conference, i did quite a bit of conflict resolution between VERY young kids who were on the verge of, or already pounding each other over toys - having been left alone in the playroom for hours on end.  i didn&#39;t even bring my then TEN year old to the conference, both because he wouldn&#39;t have enjoyed it, and because he needs more support with social situations than he would have graciously accepted in such a public setting.  but when he was FOUR?  i&#39;d have been there, within ear shot, and support range, every single minute.  to not do that is not unschooling - it&#39;s unparenting.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes. Even my 14-year-old has trouble negotiating some social aspects  <br/>
of conferences. Things donʻt always go smoothly. I feel lucky that I  <br/>
have a circle of parent-friends who are connected to her if Iʻm not  <br/>
available right that moment, who kindly either help her or come to get  <br/>
me if Iʻm not right in the vicinity.  We have kid-friends who look out  <br/>
for her, too, like Chamille.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at that same conference, i did quite a bit of conflict resolution  <br/>

&gt; have graciously accepted in such a public setting.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Michelle is sometimes unwilling to accept public support from me when  <br/>
frustration gets the better of her. We have worked over time to find  <br/>
the best ways to be helpful to her, when sheʻs reached that point (and  <br/>
it can happen *fast*). Iʻve had some spectacular failures (at least in  <br/>
my mind) at being what she needed and when.  We went to the first  <br/>
conference in St. Louis when she was 10, she didnʻt care to go back  <br/>
and neither did I, frankly. We went to the first Life is Good (at the  <br/>
last minute) when she was 12, because going with her friends sounded  <br/>
appealing. It held challenging moments for us. But, LiG is something  <br/>
she looks forward to every year, now. *She* wants to go the most out  <br/>
of all of us. And each year, she is handling her challenges with more  <br/>
grace. I am, too!<br/>
<br/>
I would totally encourage the idea of going with trustworthy friends  <br/>
to a crazy place like a conference. Folks who can be there when you or  <br/>
your kids might be overwhelmed. Friends with whom you can trade off  <br/>
for talks or take  a break. Iʻve learned so much from everyone whoʻs  <br/>
filled that role for me and it has made our conference experience  <br/>
easier and more fun.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but when he was FOUR?  i&#39;d have been there, within ear shot, and  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There is a difference between accepting assistance from people with  <br/>
whom youʻve already made some kind of arrangement, tacit or not, and  <br/>
expecting all other parents to take up your slack because &quot;weʻre all  <br/>
unschoolers.&quot;  Leaving a child completely alone to fend for themselves  <br/>
has nothing to do with unschooling. I guess that falls under the topic  <br/>
of &quot;what unschoolers owe other unschoolers.&quot;<br/>
