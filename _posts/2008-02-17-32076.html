     This is what I was trying to send earlier...sorry about that!  Oh, I was just reading some of your blog and I love how you said that you wanted to smell your son&#39;s head after not being with him for some months.  I have been blissfully sniffing our kids&#39; heads since the moment they were born and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever stop.  And another oh, have you been hanging out with MaryAnn the RV queen?  I got to have a margarita with her at the Unschoolers Winter Waterpark Gathering in January...what a treat.  She said they were headed back to Albuquerque.  :)<br/>
   <br/>
     Now, on to what I originally tried to post - I just wanted to recommend a few movies that I know unschoolers would like:<br/>
   <br/>
  Lionheart - a documentary about a 17 year old Australian who sailed around the world by himself (the youngest ever).  He was not a homeschooler but makes a great case for unschooling.<br/>
   <br/>
  Accepted - this is a mainstream, Hollywood movie about a young man who starts his own unschooly college.  I was practically cheering at the end of this movie!<br/>
   <br/>
  A Family Undertaking - a documentary about the home funeral movement...just another group of people doing things in a real and natural way.  If you&#39;re squeamish about looking at dead bodies, you may not want to watch it but we thought it was done in a very respectful and beautiful way.<br/>
   <br/>
  Okay, just wanted to tell people about these movies because we enjoyed them so much.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-546644259">There were a couple of attempts to forward something to the list, but  <br/>
that doesn&#39;t work, so the list came with notes in response to my  <br/>
letter saying, &quot;Hey...  write a whole post.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yes, we&#39;ve done a few things together.  It&#39;s been nice.   The kids  <br/>
have played Rock Band and there was cupcake decorating and there was  <br/>
a great adults-only dinner when Mel-the-dad was in town.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1852671871">I didn&#39;t see it on your list so I wanted to suggest &quot;Little Miss  <br/>
Sunshine.&quot; It is one of our *favorite* movies as a family.  The  <br/>
description to me should read &quot;A beautiful love story of a  <br/>
dysfunctional family.&quot;  The end has me sobbing and laughing  <br/>
hysterically all at the same time.  I cannot recommend this movie  <br/>
enough.  It was recommended to me over on AU, but it took me a while  <br/>
to check it out.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-646126789">I just finished watching &quot;Surf&#39;s Up&quot; with my kids and parents, and I<br/>
thought it was wonderful! There were so many parts during the movie<br/>
that made me think of all the mentors on this list and me as the<br/>
impatient Cody...<br/>
<br/>
The part about just letting go, and also when Cody finally had fun and<br/>
Big Z says, &quot;You passed the test. You got it.&quot; (apart from the<br/>
reference to a test, the point was that Cody was supposed to have fun,<br/>
not try to do everything &quot;right.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just me, but if you haven&#39;t seen it, I&#39;d recommend it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1910462755">I have been waiting forever to see the new movie about the homeschooling family who travels in the RV along the coastline so they can surf...9 kids I think.<br/>
<br/>
Surfwise is what it is called.  I think it&#39;s in video stores or netflix.<br/>
<br/>
I am not recommending this movie, as I haven&#39;t seen it. From what I hear, the dad is like a crazy man with teaching and restricting his children.  So, not an unschooling movie...<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Surf&#39;s UP is such a great movie.<br/>
<br/>
Read Elephantoms, by Lyall Watson<br/>
<br/>
Lyall Watson is a ecologist/biologist/mythologist who tells the story of his childhood when boys ages 14-17 are sent to the African Coast to live without the &quot;nicities&quot; of home.  They must forge a &quot;community&quot; amongst themselves, must find water, food etc.  The whole book is really about Elephants, but it begins with this really amazing adventure that Lyall went on for those 3 years.<br/>
