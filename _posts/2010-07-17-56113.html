<div id="ygrps-yiv-213591581">I know one of these people but not both and I&#39;m not trying to pick on  <br/>
a person, but just to bring a real-life example.  So if you know who  <br/>
they are, let that be secret, please.  Generic people.  The first one,  <br/>
I know, reads a lot about unschooling and leans heavily that way.    <br/>
The other I would say I know know nothing about, but...    I can say I  <br/>
don&#39;t know who she is and I know no particulars about her family.<br/>
<br/>
The exchange was in semi-public (facebook):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My fabulous 15yo helped me scrub the floor this afternoon--in the  <br/>
heat--and then watched the little ones while I took a nap. And then  <br/>
she made dinner. Somehow I think I got the better end of this deal. :) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
One of the responses was:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Oh how I envy you. My 15 year old has to be told to unload the  <br/>
dishwasher everyday. She has had this job for 6 years now. Everyday,  <br/>
it&#39;s like the first time she&#39;s ever heard me tell her to do it. ;)  <br/>
Your teenager is a keeper.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If it had been in any unschooling discussion context, I would have  <br/>
said the obvious things people would say on this list, that if it&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;her job&quot; for six year, that will keep her from wanting to do it, and  <br/>
that if someone is &quot;told&quot; to do something, she can never, ever do it  <br/>
without being told.<br/>
<br/>
But I couldn&#39;t say it there.  I brought it here, to get it out of my  <br/>
system.  Hope you don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is down in a hole, the view of the sky is very small.  The  <br/>
view of the surrounding area is nonexistent.<br/>
If someone peeks out of the hole, more sky; more ground.<br/>
If one moves totally away from the hole, and climbs up higher and  <br/>
higher, the world looks like a completely different place and the hole  <br/>
is forgotten.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-748358887">I was at the doctor getting a physical the other day and she asked if I had any children.  I said one -  she asked how old -  I said 16.  She smiled and said &quot;Oh, that has it&#39;s own set of stressors doesn&#39;t it, having a teen? &quot;   I replied with a smile and happiness in my voice &quot;Not at all.  He is a joy.  A very wonderful person.&quot;  It kind of threw her off for a moment because I did not answer affirmative about the trials and tribulations of a teen.  I know she ment it as a conversational piece but I&#39;ve made it my mission that every time someone mentions stress due to teens I respond with what a joy our son is and how wonderful a person he is - which is true!  Even if we were just having a bad moment &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is connected to chores in that becasue we do not have set chores and make him do &quot;X,Y,Z&quot; he is a joy - a wonderful person.  That&#39;s not the only reason of course but it does change the dynamics of the relationship.  If I chose to insist on chores then that would add stress to the relationship.  Instead at age 16 we can ask him if he would please do &quot;X,Y,Z&quot; and he usually does it with a &quot;sure!&quot; For example if it&#39;s trash night and we ask if he will help by gathering the upstairs trash while I clean out the fridge, and dad gather&#39;s recycles - and he jumps up and does it.  &quot;Zac, would you please gather up your scattered dishes so I can wash them - and he does it.&quot;  And he is getting better about not leaving them laying around - becasue I&#39;ve asked nicely if he could please remember to take them to the kitchen as he goes about his day so I can keep them washed.  I too gather them up as I move around the house - it&#39;s not all on him.  When I get up in the morning, if he left stuff on the desk by the computer, I just haul it all to the kitchen - with a smile to myself - thinking well he must have had a midnight snack last night - no different than I would do for my husband of 26 years - or he would do for me.<br/>
