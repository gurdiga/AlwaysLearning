&lt;&lt;     I know this may sound strange but hey, I am. LOL! When did Jared get <br/>
his<br/>
 front teeth in? I have heard of a theory...Ds still has quite a way before<br/>
 both top front teeth will be in. ;-) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He got them in at the average times...around six years old.<br/>
I&#39;ve heard something about that theory, I don&#39;t think it holds water. Maybe <br/>
those that get the teeth late are usually late readers, but I think there are <br/>
plenty of other kids that are late readers too.<br/>
Jared is a very dreamy type of person. Quiet and calm most of the time and <br/>
VERY distractable. He would probably have been labeled ADD in school just <br/>
because he isn&#39;t going to focus on anything he doesn&#39;t have intense interest <br/>
in (what a smart guy!) which is mainly video games and art right now.<br/>
He draws amazingly well and thinks mathematically quite well. (Picked up <br/>
chess easy, memorizes symbols easily, plays with large numbers in his head <br/>
etc...)<br/>
But reading just wasn&#39;t important. The only time he wanted to read was when <br/>
someone would give him a hard time, I knew this wasn&#39;t enough of a motivation <br/>
since shame and guilt weren&#39;t part of his life. Even when I did a more <br/>
eclectic approach, I didn&#39;t worry about having a late reader. So he escaped <br/>
most of the torture of being &quot;schooled&quot;.<br/>
Anyhoo, he&#39;ll be 10 in August and he is just starting to sound out words on <br/>
his game.<br/>
It is exciting him to see he can do it.<br/>
My few stabs at showing him letter sounds was totally boring to him and I <br/>
just figured he had his own way of figuring this all out and left him alone.<br/>
Well, he DID have a better way for him.<br/>
And now I get to watch him explore the world of language on his own terms.<br/>
Very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026369888">My 8.5 year old doesn&#39;t read (as most would define reading) and her teeth <br/>
came in at the usual time. ;)<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I think unschoolers are just proving that the &quot;average age&quot; of<br/>
reading readiness is a lot older than the reading-obsessed schools would<br/>
have us believe.<br/>

his baby teeth yet. <br/>
