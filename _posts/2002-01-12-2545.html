<div id="ygrps-yiv-1102689214">I read 2 great books last year called &quot;The Divorce Culture&quot; by Barbara Dafoe<br/>
Whitehead and &quot;The Unexpected Legaly of Divorce&quot; by Judith S. Wallerstein et<br/>
al.   Both were excellent books on understanding marriage and divorce and<br/>
the effects it has on children and then how we react to relationships when<br/>
we become adults.<br/>
<br/>
 A parent divorcing and remarrying is one of the biggest betrayals a child<br/>
can<br/>
ever live through. Are you in counseling with her? I would highly recommend<br/>
<br/>
finding a good one, or else she will find herself in counseling or dealing<br/>
<br/>
with a lot of anger issues as an adult I would guess.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more difficult for kids to deal with than anyone believes. Our society<br/>
<br/>
says it&#39;s all ok, they&#39;ll adjust. I don&#39;t buy that. I think seeking<br/>
<br/>
counseling is a good idea. And I&#39;m really glad you&#39;re not buying into that<br/>
<br/>
tough love garbage. She needs your gentleness and understanding more than<br/>
<br/>
ever I&#39;m sure!!  Ren<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1474772932">My parents divorced when I was 12, and I had much the same reaction as <br/>
Shyrley.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it depends not only on the child, but on the relationship that the<br/>
divorcing parents have with the child. My father was a kind drunk (no abuse,<br/>
just cheerfully drunk all the time) who rarely kept the promises he often<br/>
made and was generally there-but-not-there. So losing him didn&#39;t have much<br/>
impact.<br/>
<br/>
Now, my stepfather moving in a few months later, I pretty much hated, but<br/>
again, I don&#39;t know how much of that was him, how much us (me, my two<br/>
brothers and sister, pretty much hated him equally) and how much was the<br/>
general situation.<br/>

I&#39;m not at all sure that divorce is that traumatic for children. It<br/>
depends on the child. When my parents split up when i was 7/8 I recall<br/>
my mother sitting us down (sister of 5 and brother of 3) and telling us<br/>
that &#39;daddy wouldn&#39;t be living with us any more&#39;<br/>

Wow, this sounds almost like my dad! He could be<br/>
abusive to my mom on occasion though. My parents<br/>
divorced when I was 6 and the only feeling type memory<br/>
I have from it is relief. I was really glad when he<br/>
moved out. Home life became much more peaceful and my<br/>
mom was so much happier. I have a relationship with my<br/>
dad now, but it&#39;s so superficial. I can&#39;t imagine<br/>
talking to him about anything in depth. If I&#39;ve ever<br/>
tried to bring up anything in the least bit &#39;deep&#39;, he<br/>
changes the subject or leaves straight away. Poor guy,<br/>
he&#39;s so emotionally stunted.<br/>
