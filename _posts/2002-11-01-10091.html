<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Atheist Scout given a week to declare belief.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The article says the following, but is it really true? <br/>
<br/>
On membership applications, Boy Scouts and adult leaders must say they <br/>
recognize some higher power, not necessarily religious. &quot;Mother Nature would <br/>
be acceptable,&quot; Farmer said. <br/>
<br/>
I am beginning to have some serious doubts, even got into an almost argument <br/>
with Darin about it the other night, about being a Boy Scout leader and <br/>
having Jack in scouts. We finally agreed that we would finish the year out <br/>
because we both believe in commitment. Darin was upset because he says I <br/>
should have researched this better, sooner. He said Jack enjoys scouts (he <br/>
does) and it wouldn&#39;t be fair to him to not continue, even after the year is <br/>
up. I voiced my concerns about the Boy Scouts stance on homosexuality, god, <br/>
and the weird way they are going about leader training in regard to sexual <br/>
molestation. (it seemed to me that in the way the training was presented, <br/>
that the boy Scouts are maybe fearing something?) He also said, and I quote, <br/>
&quot;What does it matter, really?&quot; Which upset me very much. How can I be the <br/>
person I am and still do this? Thoughts on my ramble?<br/>

<br/>
I wonder if he could consider the board of directors of BSA as a higher <br/>
power.  They do have the power to boot him.<br/>
<br/>
Nancy,  just do it the way you want to.  Someone who was in AA with my mom <br/>
said his higher power was a certain cedar fence post.  He had just kind of <br/>
imbued this vision of a fence post with having serene, magical powers.  <br/>
Weird.  <br/>
<br/>
Not that they&#39;ll throw you out of AA for being atheistic, but I always think <br/>
of that &quot;higher power&quot; thing.  It is SO WEIRD.<br/>
<br/>
People doing biochemical and brain research have found the place in the brain <br/>
where religion is.  When people meditate or pray the brains do the same <br/>
thing, doesn&#39;t matter what religion.  And when they have &quot;a religious <br/>
experience,&quot; the brain does the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I have been saying for years I don&#39;t believe in God but I DO believe in the <br/>
usefulness of religion for people to have the experience of awe and <br/>
worshipfulness and humility.  It&#39;s hard to induce those things without props <br/>
and stories to go with it.<br/>
<br/>
And if you look at religion from a distance, with eyes blurred, as though <br/>
from another planet, the religions have some things in common:<br/>
<br/>
Worship places tend to be high and pointy.  A cathedral or a clearing in a <br/>
forest, a tipi, same thing.<br/>
<br/>
Candles, stained glass, crystals, altars...<br/>
<br/>
Incense. flowers.  things that smell good.<br/>
<br/>
Banners, ribbons, colored wavy things.  Even ribbon bookmarks in Bibles.  <br/>
There&#39;s a ribbony thing in many.<br/>
<br/>
Singing or chanting that has a humm.   &quot;Ommmmmm&quot;  &quot;Ammmmmennnnnn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You get several people concentrating on doing three or five of those things <br/>
in the same place, and the same kind of thing happens.  And the justification <br/>
for creating these ceremonies is that there is something bigger and (WE HOPE) <br/>
smarter, and that being this way, doing these things, gives us goodness and <br/>
makes us nicer people.<br/>
<br/>
That could be absolutely and entirely true.  <br/>
<br/>
Having those experiences does tend to make people a little calmer and more <br/>
compassionate for a while after.  Then they might need to... go to church, <br/>
meditate, pray... again to reclaim that feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Whether there&#39;s a God or not, those things refresh people&#39;s souls (whatever <br/>
souls might be, if it turns out there&#39;s no God).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my own brain is my higher power.  Maybe the field of anthropology is my <br/>
higher power.   Maybe the fact that there is a group of people I can go to <br/>
(like this list) where I can throw out ideas and they will come back polished <br/>
and reinforced or tweaked or rejected as flawed is a higher power than my own <br/>
individual thinking.<br/>

I haven&#39;t looked yet, but do you think maybe it&#39;s something in the olives?  <br/>
Do you think that&#39;s what happened to Jesus?   And it might have happened to <br/>
Mary or Joseph, but LUCKILY for them the hotel was full.  No sheets in the <br/>
barn.  (Oh, wait.  They weren&#39;t in Jerusalem.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go read that in a while.  I&#39;m kind of afraid.  It might bring on visions <br/>

&gt; That was cute Nancy. I have a question. This isn&#39;t the first time I have seen<br/>
&gt; someone post a cute hsing comic. Are these comics regularly hsing based? Do<br/>
&gt; you subscribe to them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No, this one is a regular in my newspaper.  When I want to share a comic<br/>
I&#39;ve seen there, I find it online.  Usually, the Houston Chronicle site will<br/>
have a link, but I had to google &quot;Grand Avenue.&quot;<br/>

&gt; I got my second invite to the Pentecostals today, two days ago I got<br/>
&gt; one to a Chicken Soup Group and a dog lovers group. Today I got one<br/>
&gt; from the Jiggling Jezebels. Is someone playing a joke on us? ~Nancy<br/>
