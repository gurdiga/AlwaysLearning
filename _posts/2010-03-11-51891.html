Misunderstandings happen sometimes!  That&#39;s why writing clearly and really thinking about it first helps lots, and assuming good intent.  This is a very different and special kind of list, largely because of the way the moderators keep it.  Something that I learned a long time ago, was that when I felt defensive, that was a big clue that there was area that I needed to work on within my self and my thoughts.  I would walk away and not respond and just think about stuff.  Meanwhile the list would go on peacefully without my defensiveness adding negativity to other people&#39;s thoughts and writings! <br/>
