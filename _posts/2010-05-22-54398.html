&quot;This movie was opening my mind to the infinite potential that was possible in the universe and within me,&quot; Sobleski said. &quot;Yoda&#39;s admonition to &#39;do or do not&#39; became my personal motto before I was old enough to know what a motto was, and a lifelong love of science and flight was born that continues to this day. I tell people all the time that if it wasn&#39;t for &#39;Star Wars,&#39; and especially &#39;Empire,&#39; I probably wouldn&#39;t be an aerospace engineer today.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-340659266">That&#39;s neat. Karl just asked me yesterday what a motto is but he<br/>
already knew how to use the word, and just wanted to make sure. So<br/>
this is cool.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do or do not do.... there is no try.&quot; I remember that scene. And I&#39;ve<br/>
never even seen the entire movie (typical of me-- I seldom finish<br/>
those things. Dunno why.).<br/>
