<div id="ygrps-yiv-1265461244">I recently attended a local homeschool group a couple times and got <br/>
to finally see what Sandra and others have been talking about. Not <br/>
that I didn&#39;t believe people, but I had not actually witnessed it <br/>
myself firsthand ...<br/>
<br/>
We were at a &quot;park day&quot; and the mother was at the pavillion with her <br/>
daughter, who was barely seven. The girl was sitting next to her <br/>
mother doing some worksheets, and very obviously not happy about any <br/>
of it. <br/>
<br/>
I heard the mother say things like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you don&#39;t stop whining, I&#39;ll make you sit alone over there and <br/>
finish these!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You don&#39;t get credit for it unless you do the whole thing <br/>
correctly! Now try it again!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the kicker: &quot;Yes, you do understand! You are just CHOOSING to be <br/>
disobedient!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was really painful to witness. <br/>
<br/>
I always read/hear homeschoolers (who are not unschoolers) say that <br/>
homeschooling has really helped their family relationships and made <br/>
life more peaceful, but I don&#39;t see how that could be if that&#39;s the <br/>
kinds of interactions they are having. <br/>
<br/>
I wonder if they are not being completely honest for whatever <br/>
reason, or if for them, that experience really IS good in their <br/>
eyes. Or if it&#39;s truly good most of the time, but just a &quot;bad <br/>
moment&quot; here and there.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, as I thought about it, it reminded me of years ago <br/>
when I used to be &quot;against homeschooling.&quot; Part of the reason was <br/>
because I imagined it being kind of like that ... mother sits trying <br/>
to &quot;teach&quot; their kids, and both mother and kid getting frustrated. <br/>
Now I wonder if that really IS what homeschooling looks like for a <br/>
lot of people.<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts. Sandra had posted here recently about a book <br/>
called &quot;Survivor&#39;s Guide to Homeschooling&quot; (something like that) and <br/>
I just put it on reserve at our library so I can learn more about <br/>
this &quot;other side,&quot; so to speak.<br/>
