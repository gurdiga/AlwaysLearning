<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353511434">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; As far as the junk food; toddlers need<br/>
surprisingly little food volume and <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; variety isn&#39;t a concern yet. As long as he&#39;s not<br/>
 </span></blockquote>underweight (if he is, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; this is a medical issue instead) then I would offer<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a selection of foods <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and stand back. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;If a baby&#39;s on the low end of the scale, don&#39;t<br/>
forget the scale belongs to the AMA and has to do with<br/>
statistics, rather than with the health or <br/>
realities of individual humans.  There can&#39;t be an<br/>
average without some people at the extremes, and some<br/>
are naturally at the extremes from genetics, <br/>
and they are at their OWN &quot;normal&quot; (midrange for their<br/>
own body&#39;s development, as their body has no idea<br/>
about other organisms of the same age).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing by &quot;underweight&quot; maybe the writer meant<br/>
unhealthily scrawny or dangerously thin.  <br/>
<br/>
Holly seems scrawny to me.  She always has.  But she&#39;s<br/>
strong and active and so I just don&#39;t worry about her<br/>
bones showing.  I&#39;m sure it will pass <br/>
sooner than she&#39;d like it to (given the prevailing<br/>
prejudices in the land in which she lives).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I absolutely agree with this. Tamzin has always been<br/>
&#39;scrawny&#39;, since birth. When she was a baby the doc<br/>
tried to tell me she was underweight and to give her<br/>
some formula along with breastmilk. That was the last<br/>
time we saw that doc! She has always been tall and<br/>
thin and I know that it&#39;s just her physical makeup.<br/>
She&#39;s healthy, active and almost never gets ill. She<br/>
also is one of those kids who hardly eats (although<br/>
she is eating more as she gets older). Sometimes it&#39;s<br/>
been a worry (usually when I start listening to other<br/>
people&#39;s concerns about her eating habits &lt;g&gt;), but<br/>
mostly I remember why it is that I chose the whole<br/>
unschooling lifestyle in the first place - I trust my<br/>
dd to know what she needs (physically as well as<br/>
mentally).<br/>
