<div id="ygrps-yiv-2058572052">Hi Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I would worry more about a control issue with Zach if he ever balked at<br/>
eating what he takes.  He doesn&#39;t.  He just takes low nutritional foods.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t post precisely. Our &quot;eat what you take&quot; policy has more to do with<br/>
accommodating the fact that there are 7 people in the house.  It is more of<br/>
&quot;Are you sure you really want that? Would you like to just take half?&quot;  That<br/>
kind of a thing in a pleasant tone when we are pretty sure that one of the<br/>
kids isn&#39;t going to eat something and somebody else would have liked to have<br/>
had some.<br/>
<br/>
We used to have lots of foster kids and these kids often came from nothing<br/>
and to be able to have the LAST of anything was a big prize.  At times, it<br/>
was used to hurt others.  My little guys were even littler during those<br/>
times and picked up on some of that.  Also, we are 7 people on a single<br/>
income.  I can&#39;t always run to the store to get more yogurts because someone<br/>
got the last one, took 2 bites and threw it away.  Then here is the 4yo<br/>
crying because she wanted yogurt.  It is just so inconsiderate and when you<br/>
have a bunch of little guys, consideration is important.<br/>
<br/>
But no, we don&#39;t do the &quot;You took cauliflower.  I know you&#39;ve never eaten<br/>
cauliflower before and wanted to try it. I don&#39;t care if it is making you<br/>
gag.  By the gods, you will eat it!!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not us.<br/>
<br/>
However, someone posted about taking Zach snacks throughout the day.  This<br/>
morning I made carrot muffins with raisins and nuts.  As Zach was waking up,<br/>
I went upstairs and told him that I made muffins for him (they were also for<br/>
everybody else and he knew that).  He came downstairs, ate one and then made<br/>
a big glass of ovaltine with fresh goat milk.  Go figure.  I will continue<br/>
along this pleasant vein and see where it goes.<br/>
