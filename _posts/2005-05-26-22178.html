<div id="ygrps-yiv-12456270">Hi everyone,<br/>
There is a chance that we could move to California soon, and I am <br/>
wondering if anyone that lives there or has lived there can tell me <br/>
anything and everything about living there. Especially about an <br/>
unschooling community. I have never even been there. Any <br/>
opinions/information anyone has to offer would be great!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-992760491">What part of California?  There are quite a few unschoolers, and  there&#39;s a <br/>
state organization (good general info, not specifically unschooling)  and a fun <br/>
conference once a year in Sacramento, and you can still get to  lists like <br/>
this, even if you&#39;re in California. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

They have county contacts, and a magazine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235138173">I hail from Californie and would ask the same question as Sandra.  Which<br/>
part?  I live in the Bay Area (Silicon Valley) about an hour south of San<br/>
Francisco.  The Bay Area is home to about 6 million people which make<br/>
unschooling great. You can always find someone to click with and there is<br/>
about a million things to do.   I know a lot of unschoolers, but do not know<br/>
of a specific unschooling group here.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Visit (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/California.htm)">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/regional/California.htm)</a> for more<br/>
California information and support groups.  The (www.homefires.com<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homefires.com/">http://www.homefires.com/</a>&gt; ) site, while not particularly unschooling, is<br/>
good for Bay Area info if that&#39;s the place you are looking at.  I run a park<br/>
day group that meets in the south bay (www.ParkHoppers.org<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.parkhoppers.org/">http://www.parkhoppers.org/</a>&gt; ).  So, if you are ever in the area please<br/>
come and visit us.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My opinion: I adore California, especially our area.  There are few native<br/>
Californians around, so most people have made a conscious decision to make<br/>
this their home and seem to have more appreciation for the place where they<br/>
live.  The population is so diverse that people are very tolerant of others&#39;<br/>
cultures and life styles.  There are mountains and forests and beaches all<br/>
within an hour or so of where we live.  Not to mention, several major<br/>
cities.  And..you can&#39;t beat the weather. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266542016">California is bigger than most countries - but with worse traffic - so <br/>
where in California really matters.<br/>
<br/>
But Sandra&#39;s advice to look at the HSC website is good.  HSC sponsers <br/>
several campouts in addition to the conference and the unschoolers are to <br/>
be found at the campouts I&#39;ve discovered (at long last!)<br/>
