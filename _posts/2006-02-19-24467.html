<div id="ygrps-yiv-239672618">This is for Wendy S. - what part of Georgia are you in?  We are in  Canton <br/>
and have yet to meet any other unschoolers in our travels :)<br/>
 <br/>
Also, I noticed that Ren mentioned Tennessee - I remember you from a  list a <br/>
long time ago and thought you were in Pensacola?  I spoke with you  (via <br/>
email) then, as I am from Pensacola.  <br/>

By the way, I&#39;ve been lurking for a while and I appreciate reading all the  <br/>
insights from the seasoned members :)  Every time I read a thread I look at  <br/>
something a little differently and get a little closer to where I want to  be.  <br/>
Thanks to all!<br/>
