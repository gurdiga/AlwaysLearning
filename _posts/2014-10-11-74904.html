Please subscribe to this if you&#39;re interested in the possibility of attending the Always Learning Live Symposium in Albuquerque in late December.<br/>
<br/>
If you know you can&#39;t attend, please subscribe if you&#39;re interested in supporting the work I do here, on my site, and in person.  My fundraiser this year will have to do with that gathering, and a trip up the mountain! :-)  It will be announced there, sometime in November and if you&#39;re an e-mail subscriber you&#39;ll get the notice!<br/>
<br/>
This week I will introduce speakers, and there will be links to other things about them, so subscribe if you&#39;re interested in knowing more about other unschooling families (with photos, which we can&#39;t use here).<br/>
<br/>
Subscribe if you have friends you think would benefit from three days of unschooling discussion with experienced unschoolers (and a traditional art form, rangoli; and some table games at night; and a trip up to the top of the Sandia mountains by tram so we can see A LONG WAY).  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for reading, and for your help and encouragement here and otherwheres. :-)<br/>
<br/>
