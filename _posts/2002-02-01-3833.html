<div id="ygrps-yiv-1349803621">Life has been nuts around here lately, with my son&#39;s dad being an ass, a lot <br/>
of stress, etc.  And of course, this OTHER list I&#39;m on is depressing as well. <br/>
There are a lot of homeschoolers around, but not many real unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m behind here, and started to read back on the posts, and...<br/>
<br/>
What joy! We&#39;re all very different, but this feels like a community. I&#39;m so <br/>
glad you&#39;re all here! Thank you!<br/>
