<div id="ygrps-yiv-242987857">I was wondering if you or Sandra (or anyone else) had any other advice<br/>
for running a list.<br/>
<br/>
I just started a regional list for radical unschoolers a couple of<br/>
weeks ago and it seems to be going well, but I don&#39;t really know what<br/>
I am doing.  I started the list because I wanted to be a part of a<br/>
list like this and it seems that others felt the same way - we have<br/>
just over 50 members and everyone who has posted so far seems friendly<br/>
and positive about the list.   Traffic has been fairly light, but the<br/>
tone of the list seems nice so far.  I&#39;ve been trying to come up with<br/>
good topics to begin conversations.  I think we have the beginnings of<br/>
a good list, but I know that good moderator/hostess skills could help<br/>
a lot and I want to do what I can to make things go well.<br/>
<br/>
This is the list, in case you want to take a look:<br/>

&gt; 2) have the experience and understanding to see how and why someone&#39;s<br/>

&gt; 3) the ability to put clear thoughts into clear writing<br/>
&gt;<br/>

meaning to ask but never think of when I&#39;m sitting here going through<br/>
posts.  I want to increase our social outlets and attract a strong local<br/>
support for our lifestyle choices, and I know there are better and worse<br/>
ways to go about that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965717523">-=-Traffic has been fairly light, but the<br/>

Since it&#39;s a regional list, it might be good to talk about possible  <br/>
get-togethers or let others know when the museum will be free or what  <br/>
the nearby conferences are.  Let that be for regional topics, and  <br/>
maybe recommend other unschooling lists to them for discussing the  <br/>
depths of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve  had a regional list die, and I was running the state inclusive  <br/>
list for years but I got tired of providing for a curriculum  <br/>
discussion while being told to shush it whenever I (rarely) brought  <br/>
up unschooling, so I passed it on and I don&#39;t even know if it lived  <br/>
or died.  If a list is based on plans and get-togethers it seems to  <br/>
help.  So at least occasionally post reminders about local happenings  <br/>
or SOMEthing so it has a purpose even when it&#39;s quiet sometimes.   <br/>
Summers are often quiet for such lists.  Also holidays.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1919184271">Thank you for the ideas!<br/>
<br/>
It is a regional radical unschooling list, not a local homechooling<br/>
list so people bashing unschooling are the ones who will get shushed,<br/>
not the radical unschoolers.  I would like there to be some<br/>
discussion, but I would expect most people to read lists like this as<br/>
well.  It is kind of an odd setup since it covers such a large<br/>
geographic area.   There may be some get togethers, but it&#39;s a big<br/>
state so we can&#39;t plan much of anything that everyone can make it to.<br/>
Some events are definitely in order, though.  I should start thinking<br/>
of some good things to do.<br/>
