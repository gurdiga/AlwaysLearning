<div id="ygrps-yiv-859045760">A friend of mine was reading our blog and asked me if I could recommend reading he could do to help him get past some feelings of inferiority he has, due to poor school performance as a child and young adult.  He fears that he pushes his daughters too hard because of his own issues related to never doing well enough in school.  I don&#39;t know where to direct him.  He would be most interested in books or articles.  Maybe later he would consider reading on this list, but I doubt he would embrace that now.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-52183691">I&#39;d offer him Holt - How Children Fail might be a good place to start, since he has some healing to do around school performance. <br/>
<br/>
He might also find Gatto&#39;s Seven Lesson Schoolteacher soothing (or infuriating):<br/>

<br/>
If he likes that he can go on to Dumbing Us Down by the same author, but I&#39;d start with the essay - it&#39;s a good synopsis of all things Gatto.<br/>
<br/>
Another book he might like is Frank Smith&#39;s The Book of Learning and Forgetting. <br/>
