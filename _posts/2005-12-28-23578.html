<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971457176">Our 19 year old Nicole (will be 20 in spring) seems to<br/>
be lazy, or depressed or something.  She is fairly<br/>
non-communicative, even when asked direct questions,<br/>
so it&#39;s hard for us to know what&#39;s going on with her<br/>
inside.<br/>
<br/>
She wants to be treated as an adult but is overly<br/>
sensative and emotional and difficult to talk to about<br/>
things and doesn&#39;t act as a responsible adult.  She<br/>
had moved out and lived with a boyfriend for a while,<br/>
but has been back home about a year.  <br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t have any friends or any social life<br/>
outside of online and her cell phone, all long<br/>
distance people mainly met online.  She did an<br/>
independent study highschool in California (We&#39;re in<br/>
WA, she&#39;s actually my neice) and accellerated herself<br/>
to graduate early (at 16) so that she could move up<br/>
here and be with us.  She had been with us part time<br/>
until then.  <br/>
<br/>
Nicole spends long hours at night on the computer<br/>
playing online games with people, until about 4 in the<br/>
morning.  She seems addicted to them to me.  She also<br/>
spends long hours during the day on her cell phone<br/>
talking mostly to a guy she met online (27yrs) who<br/>
lives in Texas.  He came and visited her here last<br/>
month for about a week, and she&#39;s been having a long<br/>
distance relationships with him for about a year now. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t take the public transit despite much urging<br/>
and encouragement from us.  So her grandparents bought<br/>
her a used car but despite our encouragement she&#39;s<br/>
shown little interest in learning to drive it.  She<br/>
had high honors in school and that combined with being<br/>
low income and minority makes her elligible for grants<br/>
for school if she chooses to go to college but<br/>
although she&#39;s looked into the local schools a little,<br/>
she has not persued that option.  She has had one job<br/>
interview and that was one I initiated for her (not to<br/>
push her, I just circumstantially stumbled upon an<br/>
unadvertised position with someone I know that seemed<br/>
perfect for Nicole, who had said when asked that she<br/>
was interested in getting a job, so I put them in<br/>
touch with each other.)  She shows no interest in<br/>
moving out and getting her own place either.  She<br/>
absolutely not interested in moving to Texas either,<br/>
but would like to move her guy here to live in her<br/>
cabin with her when it&#39;s completed.  He&#39;s currently<br/>
unemployed, having been fired from a gas station store<br/>
job, and lives with his mother and brother.  In his<br/>
defense, he is a really nice guy, but lacking in<br/>
ambition and self confidence.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t do much of anything around the house, just<br/>
her own laundry and some of her own cooking.  She<br/>
doesn&#39;t usually clean up after she cooks or eats. <br/>
Dishes are suposed to be her main chore, because I<br/>
have psoriasis in my hands and it&#39;s something I can&#39;t<br/>
do much of.  She chose dishes and claimed to enjoy<br/>
doing them, but she complains about doing the dishes,<br/>
and only does them once or twice a week, forcing Tom<br/>
and I to tackle the piles out of desperation the rest<br/>
of the time, which is at least twice a day.  I&#39;ve<br/>
tried making a general list of other chores that need<br/>
done and asking her to pick some things off of it to<br/>
do, but that didn&#39;t work either. <br/>
<br/>
We got her two cats (which she desperately wanted) and<br/>
all their accoutrements and pay for vet and food for<br/>
them, but she has to be asked to change the litterbox<br/>
when it stinks.  She also knows we are extremely tight<br/>
financially but she has never offered to give up her<br/>
online games, which have monthly fees which we pay, or<br/>
to give up other treats we buy for her (like drinking<br/>
soda) to offset the cost of her game.  We give her<br/>
pocket money to spend whenever we can afford to, and<br/>
often get her little things (food treats, or other<br/>
personal items) just as we do with the younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
Her bedroom must be a public room during the day, as<br/>
we live in a very small space, and we made an 8pm<br/>
cerfew for her room for everyone else to get out so<br/>
that she could have it to herself in the evenings. <br/>
The computers are in her room, as well as my sewing<br/>
things and my writing desk and other things we need<br/>
access to, yet she doesn&#39;t rise and leave her room<br/>
until 12-2pm each day.  She will also often go into<br/>
her room periodically between those times (2 and 8pm)<br/>
and shut the door to talk on her phone or be alone for<br/>
a while.  She knew when she moved here that we had<br/>
very little space but were happy to share what we had,<br/>
however now she seems to want to have that room all to<br/>
herself, all the time, despite anyone else&#39;s needs.<br/>
<br/>
She also seems to avoid spending time with us, playing<br/>
games or talking or being social with us, (unless<br/>
there is a power outage and she can&#39;t use the<br/>
computer) and when she sits at the table in the<br/>
kitchen coloring/drawing or reading or doing a puzzle<br/>
or something she puts on headphones and hides her face<br/>
with her hair.<br/>
<br/>
Thomas is celebrating his 9th birthday this Thursday<br/>
and two families who are friends of ours are coming<br/>
over for a suppertime small party.  That&#39;s three extra<br/>
kids and two extra adults.  She asked if she could<br/>
lock herself in her room and make it off limits to the<br/>
kids while that was ongoing.  Not only did she not<br/>
want to participate and be here for a family birthday<br/>
party, but she wanted to make one of the 4 rooms in<br/>
the house (not counting the bathroom there&#39;s the<br/>
kitchin, living room, and two bedrooms) unavailable<br/>
while we had extra people in the house.  We were<br/>
anticipating being able to split the kids up to play<br/>
if needed with some of them playing computer games in<br/>
that room if they wnated to.  While I was explaining<br/>
the difficulty of this and why it didn&#39;t seem a good<br/>
idea to do that, she interrupted to say angrily &quot;I<br/>
knew it wouldn&#39;t be alright.  Tom can you take me to<br/>
the library at that time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have been building her a studio cabin so that she<br/>
can have a little place of her own and we can all have<br/>
more space and privacy until out main house is built,<br/>
but although she&#39;s excited about it, she&#39;s done very<br/>
little work on it herself and has left it mainly to<br/>
us, despite much encouragement from us.  We live in a<br/>
two bedroom single wide right now and Tom and I gave<br/>
her our bedroom when she moved here at 16.  We sleep<br/>
on a loft we built in the room with the boys.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to try to sit down and talk to her (again)<br/>
tonight about some of the things that have been<br/>
bothering us.  I guess I partly needed to vent and<br/>
partly to ask the advice of an unschooling crowd on<br/>
this matter.  I can easily get the standard kind of<br/>
disrespectful parenting advice, but I&#39;m wondering what<br/>
to do about this situation from an unschooly point of<br/>
view and looking for advice from the good minds here.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t want to drive her away.  We&#39;re feeling taken<br/>
advantage of.  <br/>

<br/>
~~~<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;re being too nice to her.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have a similar situation wrt an adult child living at home  again.  Jon and <br/>
his girlfriend Abby are staying in my studio, but I  have to insist that they <br/>
both work jobs and give me money out of every check, to  pay back some money <br/>
they owe me.<br/>
 <br/>
They are free to go at any time, being adults and all, but they choose to  <br/>
stay.  They stay knowing that if they don&#39;t get up for work on time I will  wake <br/>
them.  If they call in sick and I don&#39;t see evidence of illness they  know <br/>
that I will ask them about it.  They know that as long as they owe me  money and <br/>
are working to pay me back that I&#39;ll be happy to have them around and  help <br/>
them make good decisions and lend my tools to work on their cars and I&#39;ll  wash <br/>
towels and cook supper and invite them to eat, and let them put stuff in my  <br/>
fridge.<br/>
 <br/>
When my son came back I woke him up every day, cheerfully, and showed him  <br/>
the help wanted ads that I had seen that day.  I reassured him that I was  going <br/>
to let him sleep and sleep and sleep all he wanted--between shifts.   I let <br/>
him know that what I cook he&#39;s free to eat and if there&#39;s something he  wants <br/>
from the grocery that I&#39;ll keep it stocked.  But he&#39;s going to have  to work, <br/>
or look for work.  <br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;re free to leave any time they want.  They choose to stay because  they <br/>
know it&#39;s the quickest way to pay the money back and they don&#39;t want to owe  <br/>
it.  They want to be independent again and move to Florida near her family,  <br/>
where they both have jobs waiting.  <br/>
 <br/>
But still I have to wake them up 2 or 3 times a week, and I&#39;m not going to  <br/>
keep quiet when they call in sick and I know they&#39;re not sick.  They&#39;re  <br/>
lacking in maturity and self-motivation in some ways.  They&#39;d rather do the  fun <br/>
things than the hard things.  I understand.  I was like that,  too.  But if I <br/>
thought they were taking advantage of me, I&#39;d ask them to  leave.<br/>
 <br/>
I keep imagining them as good friends who are hard on their luck.   Would I <br/>
ask Steve and Stacy to leave if they were taking advantage of me?   Yes.  Would <br/>
I wake up Steve and Stacy if I knew they had to be at work by 8  and it was <br/>
7:30 already?  Yes.  Would I cook food and stock their  favorites?  Yes, but <br/>
only if they were working.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think I&#39;d treat my son this way if he had not already left  home.  <br/>
Our family has made large adjustments to being just 3 of us, and it  is an <br/>
adjustment to put someone back in the mix (two someones, one we didn&#39;t  know well). <br/>
 I&#39;ve made mention to others that it seems they both need a  little more <br/>
&quot;browning in the oven&quot; before they can be out on their own again,  and I&#39;m willing <br/>
to do that for them.  But they have to do all the rising  themselves.<br/>

If she wasn&#39;t unschooled, it&#39;s not really an unschooling question.  I  <br/>
can see wanting the advice of this group, but I wanted to clarify for  <br/>
anyone who might have read it quickly that this is NOT about an  <br/>
unschooler, and not about a teen who&#39;s the age of compulsory  <br/>
schooling, either.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of 19 year olds feel lost.  You could press her to get a job.   <br/>
You could ask her to do chores before playing video games.  Is it her  <br/>
computer or yours?  It&#39;s one thing to do dishes for your own child  <br/>
and share a computer with your own child, but with a legal adult who  <br/>
has asked to come and live with you, you can easily ask for services  <br/>
and assistance in return.<br/>
<br/>
Is she depressed?  If you enable her, what will inspire her to get  <br/>
help or to find cheer?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-She doesn&#39;t have any friends or any social life<br/>
outside of online and her cell phone, all long<br/>

<br/>
Are you paying for the phone calls?  That&#39;s no good if so.<br/>
Tell her to use IM instead of phone, if you&#39;re paying for it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So her grandparents bought<br/>
her a used car but despite our encouragement she&#39;s<br/>
shown little interest in learning to drive it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you take her out to drive.  Does she need to take driver&#39;s ed  <br/>
where you are?  Might she want to anyway?  She might have fun there,  <br/>
meeting people.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She chose dishes and claimed to enjoy<br/>

-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could say &quot;You&#39;re not fulfilling your contract; it&#39;s the same as  <br/>
not paying your rent.  You can only stay here if you do what you  <br/>
agreed to do.  We need more help, or we&#39;d like for you to move.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not your daughter.  She&#39;s not your responsibility.  Will her  <br/>
parents help you pay for this stuff?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;her room,&quot; if your computer and desk are there.  I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
go along with what you&#39;re going along with if it were me.  Let her  <br/>
find some out of the way corner to sleep in if she wants to sleep late.<br/>

I hope you said no, no way.  His 9th birthday won&#39;t come again.  She  <br/>
can either be at the party or be out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re sacrificing your own peace and your family&#39;s peace for someone  <br/>
else&#39;s convenience, and that&#39;s not healthy.  You&#39;re not defending  <br/>
your own space and doing your own duty by you immediate family.  She  <br/>
seems to outrank your own kids.  That&#39;s not good.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-921361493">Quite honestly, I wouldn&#39;t allow myself or my family to be treated in this<br/>
way. I&#39;m all for helping people out. We&#39;ve had adults of varying ages living<br/>
with us for different amounts of time and for a variety of reasons. Some<br/>
were family, some were not. It wouldn&#39;t matter. I like to help people out,<br/>
but I expect to be treated with respect in return.  I don&#39;t know Nicole,<br/>
whether she is just taking advantage of you or if she is depressed or has<br/>
some other problem. It wouldn&#39;t matter to me, I would still expect respect<br/>
and contribution to the family. And if an adult is living in my home, they<br/>
better have a job of some kind or at least be contributing to the welfare<br/>
and upkeep of the family.  If she needs help, I would do what I could to<br/>
help her access the help she needs. If she was unwilling to be a part of the<br/>
family and contribute in some way, then I would have her find some other<br/>
place to live. I don&#39;t mean any of this in a mean way. But it really is not<br/>
fair to the family and letting her live like this really isn&#39;t doing her any<br/>
favors. <br/>

idea to do that, she interrupted to say angrily &quot;I<br/>
knew it wouldn&#39;t be alright.  Tom can you take me to<br/>
the library at that time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We have been building her a studio cabin so that she<br/>
can have a little place of her own and we can all have<br/>
more space and privacy until out main house is built,<br/>
but although she&#39;s excited about it, she&#39;s done very<br/>
little work on it herself and has left it mainly to<br/>
us, despite much encouragement from us.  We live in a<br/>
two bedroom single wide right now and Tom and I gave<br/>
her our bedroom when she moved here at 16.  We sleep<br/>
on a loft we built in the room with the boys.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going to try to sit down and talk to her (again)<br/>
tonight about some of the things that have been<br/>
bothering us.  I guess I partly needed to vent and<br/>
partly to ask the advice of an unschooling crowd on<br/>
this matter.  I can easily get the standard kind of<br/>
disrespectful parenting advice, but I&#39;m wondering what<br/>
to do about this situation from an unschooly point of<br/>
view and looking for advice from the good minds here.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t want to drive her away.  We&#39;re feeling taken<br/>
advantage of.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166714369"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I wanted to clarify for  <br/>
&gt; anyone who might have read it quickly that this is NOT about an  <br/>
&gt; unschooler, and not about a teen who&#39;s the age of compulsory  <br/>
&gt; schooling, either.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right, but she is a lot like my eldest child.  I had her from 2-6, <br/>
and then only partial time (visits) until she was 16.  She was in an <br/>
independent study HS, which is different than regular school, but <br/>
that&#39;s still not Unschooling.  She&#39;s been out of any kind of school <br/>
for going on 4 years now, and not had any kind of job either.  Part <br/>
of that time she was living with a boyfriend.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Is it her  computer or yours?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s mine.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It&#39;s one thing to do dishes for your own child  and share a <br/>
&gt;computer with your own child, but with a legal adult who  <br/>
&gt; has asked to come and live with you, you can easily ask for <br/>
&gt;services and assistance in return.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Part of the problem (as in my problem knowing just how to address <br/>
this) is that she is very much like my own child.  She also was 16 <br/>
when she came to live here full time, not an adult then.  But she is <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is she depressed?  If you enable her, what will inspire her to <br/>
&gt;get help or to find cheer?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very good point.  I&#39;ll have to think on that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are you paying for the phone calls? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Absolutely not.  But we do pay for a cell phone and she calls, or <br/>
they call her, during her free time on that phone.  The cell phone <br/>
is on contract (so can&#39;t stop paying for it without big penalties <br/>
for us.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Do you take her out to drive. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I offer, I also encourage her to schedule time with me, once I just <br/>
TOLD her I was taking her out, and she did practice driving that <br/>
time.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does she need to take driver&#39;s ed  where you are?  Might she want <br/>
&gt;to anyway?  She might have fun there, meeting people.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can teach her here.  I did offer classes, in case she wasn&#39;t <br/>
comfortable learning from me, but she said no.  Classes also cost a <br/>
good deal of money we cannot really afford when there is a free <br/>
option of us teaching her.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You could say &quot;You&#39;re not fulfilling your contract; it&#39;s the same <br/>
&gt;as not paying your rent.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Indeed I could do that.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Will her parents help you pay for this stuff?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL....no.  Her parents and I have not been on speaking terms for <br/>
years.  They don&#39;t have the means to help her, or the inclination.  <br/>
She comes from an abusive background, and partly that was why I was <br/>
trying not to press too much.  But so what?  So do I (come from an <br/>
abusive background) and no one carried me like she&#39;s being carried <br/>
now.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It&#39;s not &quot;her room,&quot; if your computer and desk are there. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We were calling it the library, or the computer room, but she <br/>
persists in calling it her room, and in teaching the boys to call it <br/>
her room.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I wouldn&#39;t  go along with what you&#39;re going along with if it were <br/>
 </span></blockquote>me.  Let her find some out of the way corner to sleep in if she <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;wants to sleep late.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She&#39;s a light sleeper (rolling my eyes.)  As it is she complains <br/>
about the noise the boys make in the mornings, just being boys.  I <br/>
don&#39;t bother to try to keep them quiet much, but it makes me feel <br/>
tense knowing that she&#39;s trying to sleep when they&#39;re noisy and that <br/>
she&#39;ll be irritated about it.  Not that she cows me, I just don&#39;t <br/>
like the tension, and that makes me tense.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I hope you said no, no way.  His 9th birthday won&#39;t come again.  <br/>
&gt;She  can either be at the party or be out of the house.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ll be talking to her about it tonight.  I need to go in the other <br/>
room and talk to her now in fact.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You&#39;re sacrificing your own peace and your family&#39;s peace for <br/>
&gt;someone  else&#39;s convenience, and that&#39;s not healthy.  You&#39;re not <br/>
 </span></blockquote>defending your own space and doing your own duty by you immediate <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;family.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>She is also my immediate family.  Just think of her as my oldest <br/>
child.  She thinks of herself that way.  It would be the same as if <br/>
I adopted her, or had shared custody of her when she was younger and <br/>
then full custody as a teen.  I do agree with you though.  I think <br/>
she&#39;s a lot younger developmentally than her chronological age.  <br/>
Strange, but she used to be more self sufficient, more motivated and <br/>
more mature.  She fought to get her own placement into that <br/>
independent study school.  She used to help a lot more around here.  <br/>
She seems to be regressing, and I have been thinking that being in <br/>
our safe home hads allowed her to be the carefree younger teen she <br/>
didn&#39;t get the chance to be before.  She was primary caretaker for <br/>
her twin sisters, who are Thomas&#39; age, because her parents were drug <br/>
addicts.  It&#39;s gotten to the point though, where we feel it&#39;s just <br/>
all too much, and she&#39;s taking advantage of us.  She wants to act <br/>
like a child now, but have adult perogatives and priveleges (sp?), <br/>
and get respect while not giving it in return.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your thoughts.<br/>

And - do you have insurance so that you can get a few sessions of  <br/>

<br/>
No.  If you adopted her when you already had younger kids and she  <br/>
bullied them, that would not be any good either.<br/>
Custody of someone else&#39;s biological child should NOT trump the needs  <br/>
of your own biological children, and I speak from the experience of  <br/>
having had two cousins live with me (parents had custody) from the  <br/>
time I was seven (when one came) and eight (when the second one came  <br/>
to live with us).<br/>
<br/>
Your obligation to your husband&#39;s children outweighs your obligation  <br/>
to another person&#39;s child.  She might be able to go second, but NOT  <br/>
(not, not, not) first, over them.<br/>

I&#39;m going to boil that down to this:<br/>

tense<br/>
irritated<br/>
tension<br/>
tense<br/>
<br/>
You cannot reclaim this year.<br/>
You cannot keep your children young while your niece wallows in angst.<br/>
<br/>
Every day your children are getting older, and you shouldn&#39;t risk  <br/>
missing that because someone else&#39;s child is stretched out between  <br/>
you and your children, between you and your computer, between your  <br/>
son and the full enjoyment of his birthday.<br/>

I&#39;d guess it&#39;s irritating because she&#39;s not working and she&#39;s not  <br/>
contributing and it&#39;s obvious that the phone calls are a great motivating factor  for <br/>
the her, which motivation could be used in more productive ways that don&#39;t  piss <br/>
off the rest of the family.<br/>
 <br/>
Nanci said she&#39;s shutting the door and being snooty about her phone  calls.  <br/>
 <br/>
She just hasn&#39;t earned that kind of consideration.  That&#39;s  irritating.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34226253">This is tangential, but I feel like there was a study<br/>
within the past year that concluded that St. John&#39;s<br/>
Wort actually has no effect - it&#39;s just a placebo. <br/>
(If that works, fantastic, but maybe it would be<br/>
better to find a cheaper placebo!)  Worth looking into<br/>
before buying an expensive bottle of St. John&#39;s Wort.<br/>
<br/>
Agreed that she sounds depressed and therapy could be<br/>
helpful; also understood about her needing to be a<br/>
child again.  I and a lot of people I know, who are<br/>
also from abusive or otherwise traumatic backgrounds,<br/>
have needed that and benefitted greatly from being<br/>
able to do so, but not like Nicole&#39;s doing.  There&#39;s<br/>
nothing wrong with needing to reclaim a lost<br/>
childhood, and it&#39;s probably really healthy for her to<br/>
regress to some extent and do that, but NOT at the<br/>
expense of anyone else.  You and she need to find a<br/>
middle ground where she can feel safe and get her<br/>
developmental needs met but is not causing tension and<br/>
bad feeling in your family, or taking advantage of<br/>
others&#39; kindness without doing anything herself. <br/>
Therapy could be an ideal outlet for some of her more<br/>
childlike needs, as well as helping her deal with her<br/>
depression.  (Just from the little you&#39;ve said about<br/>
where she&#39;s coming from, I&#39;d sure be depressed if that<br/>
were me.)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; You&#39;re sacrificing your own peace and your family&#39;s peace for <br/>
&gt; someone  <br/>
&gt; else&#39;s convenience, and that&#39;s not healthy.  You&#39;re not defending  <br/>
&gt; your own space and doing your own duty by you immediate family.  <br/>
&gt; She  <br/>
&gt; seems to outrank your own kids.  That&#39;s not good.<br/>

This may be an identity issue. My kids, who are adopted really have <br/>
struggled in their teen years deciding who they will be. If my birth <br/>
parent was __________ will I be ________. My daughter once said to <br/>
me, &quot;Not only do I have to figure out how I feel about you and dad, <br/>
but about my birthparents.&quot; They were drug addicts one of whom is <br/>
dead and one of whom is functioning on the level of a three year old <br/>
thanks to the drugs. Kids have a lot of feelings about that stuff, <br/>
but better to work through it now than save it for later.;]<br/>
<br/>
I understand giving her the cushion, but at 19 its time to help her <br/>
grown up. I raised my sister who came from hell and she is 30 year <br/>
old mother of four doing very well.  Maybe helping her set her goals <br/>
and holding her accountable for them. Help her set her own goals. <br/>
Does she want to drive? If so what days is she willing to learn? <br/>
What times? Put it on your calender and get out there. Act like not <br/>
doing it is not an option. It is a commitment.  Does she want to <br/>
move into the room you are working on for her? What is she willing <br/>
to do to get it done? Let her know you want her to have her space, <br/>
but giving her family space when it is in such short demand does not <br/>
work for everyone else in the family. Does she want to work? Does <br/>
she want money for her own expenses? Is she afraid that if she gets <br/>
a job she will have to move and lose you guys? Help her by creating <br/>
a concrete list and plan, a timetable for those goals. When she <br/>
achieves one celebrate with her. When she fails at meeting a goal, <br/>
perhaps she needs to choose a new one, maybe that goal is not one <br/>
she really wants. So then what is it she wants and how can that <br/>
happen? About the birthday I would let her know that it is a family <br/>
commitment and your planning on her being there and then ask her <br/>
where she thinks you should have the party if her room is off <br/>
limits. Help her think through what she is really asking. Maybe what <br/>
she is wanting to know is how important she is.<br/>
I am sure she is terrified. Many 19 year olds from &quot;normal&quot; families <br/>
are. It is a frightenning time setting out on defining yourself. <br/>
Good Luck,<br/>
