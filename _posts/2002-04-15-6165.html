<div id="ygrps-yiv-2074121380">**Another homeschooler was over here and hadn&#39;t seen the house since I&#39;d <br/>
moved here. When I showed her around she saw one of my big bookshelfs full of <br/>
books and materials and said something like &quot;oh, you still have all the books <br/>
and stuff?&quot;<br/>
As though unschoolers didn&#39;t use real life materials!!! The ignorance is <br/>
amazing.<br/>
I made some comment about what did she think unschooling was if we weren&#39;t <br/>
making loads of stuff available to our children and she replied that she <br/>
thought I would have gotten rid of anything curriculum oriented.<br/>
What, like dictionaries?<br/>
Or the science books my kids love?**<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve bought some seriously wonderful books cheap from eclectic homeschoolers <br/>
and unit study type homeschoolers. Eyewitness books. The History of US <br/>
series. A newer atlas. <br/>
<br/>
They were done with the unit, or with the year&#39;s designated subjects, and <br/>
didn&#39;t need the books around anymore. They weren&#39;t using textbooks but they <br/>
thought of what they were using the same way - work through it from start to <br/>
finish and when you&#39;re done, you&#39;re done. <br/>
<br/>
My family though uses those kinds of books for reference, for leafing <br/>
through, for pondering.  Even when we start at the beginning and read <br/>
straight through to the end, we&#39;re not done with them. We&#39;ll be back.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll bet your visitor thinks about books the same way those sellers did.<br/>
