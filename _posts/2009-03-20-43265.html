<div id="ygrps-yiv-1595581472">Hi everyone. i am new. My son is 4 years old. he should start K this year but our state has moved the cut off date up to aug 31. anyway. a friend on my local mommy group introduced me to this homeschooling method. so before i just jump into topics, ill be reading posts. and getting any information i can get my hands on. im also looking into geting a few books from the library here. <br/>
so if any of you have any begining sugestions, please lend them my way. im trying to learn all i can about this method. cause i really dont want my son to be bombarded with &quot;busy&quot; work the schools give.<br/>
also anything on a legal stand point, like those &quot;end of grade tests&quot;<br/>
how does things like that work? i just feel that the system is pushing these kids too hard and too fast, and thats why the drop out rate is so high...<br/>
anyway ill stop going on and on...<br/>

with your region&#39;s legalities a lot faster.<br/>

Any John Holt book is great.  Read online at<br/>
