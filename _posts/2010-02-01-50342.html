<div id="ygrps-yiv-214827879">Would it be very bad if school were his unschooling tool? Would it be<br/>
possible for him to use it how he saw fit? If he were free to try it out and<br/>
see what happened and it didn&#39;t become a learning method commitment to set<br/>
in stone or even continue using it for whatever reasons of his own? Would it<br/>
then mean that he would have to let go of how he was currently learning? I<br/>
am trying to understand the implications, as I fear this scenario unfolding<br/>
in my life too. I fear the influence of the opinions of friends and family<br/>
leading him to question my choices for him, and wonder where my boundaries<br/>
as a caring parent can be. If I am allowing him freedom of learning, and I<br/>
am resistant to him challenging the boundaries and choices of where he is,<br/>
what are the possibilities?<br/>
<br/>
I am interested in learning how experienced unschooling parents supported<br/>
their child&#39;s learning, while safeguarding from possible brain washing into<br/>
schooling as a measure of worth or sending children to school as a measure<br/>
of love... Our family has already started talking about thing like<br/>
uneducated, illiterate, no future, etc about him and irresponsible, selfish,<br/>
stingy, lazy, etc about me. I worry about the impact of such talk on him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My son was interested in school on and off from about age 11 on. He <br/>
finally went at age 16 - this fall - and was back home in two months. <br/>
Another learning experience. He knew what I thought about school, and <br/>
ended up agreeing with me, but did need to find out for himself.<br/>
<br/>
At different times when he wanted to go to school - we talked about why- <br/>
and I did my best to provide what he felt he was missing in other ways. <br/>
Once it was a math text book, but mostly LOTS of places to go, things to <br/>
do, and people to see. I helped start a home school learning center <br/>
during this time- which we still participate in, and planned and sought <br/>
out many different activities outside the home. His main interest was <br/>
and is music- so we helped him seek out lessons, apprenticeships, and <br/>
many many group playing opportunties. At one point though, he just <br/>
really wanted to try school.<br/>
<br/>
And I did find some examples of people that have done things that he <br/>
could see himself doing- going to music school, without high school, <br/>
mainly - and told him about that, sent him links. There were several  <br/>
stories I found on college websites about home schooled students and <br/>
their different paths to getting into college.<br/>
<br/>
I your son is interested in writing I am sure there are infinite ways to <br/>
support that interest.<br/>
<br/>
It can take an unbelievable amount of energy and time to create a great <br/>
life for a kid outside of school. SO worth it!<br/>

<br/>
Well....<br/>
Definitely I&#39;d suggest reading your posts before you send them. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You told us he is requesting help with writing.<br/>
Then you said perhaps...<br/>
<br/>
I think definitely, he wants ideas for how to practice writing.<br/>
<br/>
Is he on the computer much?   That&#39;s where my kids learned to spell  <br/>
and write, playing games and sending messages and such.  Could you  <br/>
write him notes sometimes to see if he might write back?  I&#39;m thinking  <br/>
of times I had a question and left a note because the kid was asleep  <br/>
and they left me a note to find when  I woke up, though generally as  <br/>
they got old enough to be gone when I went to sleep, they would e-mail  <br/>
the details and I&#39;d check e-mail in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe finding examples of other people&#39;s everyday handwriting would  <br/>
help him see that not everyone&#39;s writing is really clear and beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
As to wanting to go back to school, if you can get to a gathering of  <br/>
unschoolers, DO IT.  It could be worth the cost to get your family in  <br/>
the presence of happy, busy unschooling families to give him a view of  <br/>
how life can be without school fears.<br/>
<br/>
I know it&#39;s not the regular topic of this list, but I need to make a  <br/>
list for the rebuilding unschooling.info site anyway, of potential  <br/>
gatherings.   If anyone wants to send me any notes on upcoming  <br/>
happenings, please do.<br/>
<br/>
If you can&#39;t get around other unschoolers, spend a few months  <br/>
&quot;upgrading&quot; your unschooling activities.  Do more.<br/>
<br/>
Someone criticized &quot;do more&quot; here, but I woke up thinking about that  <br/>
today, and I think it&#39;s the best advice ever.   I&#39;ll make another  <br/>
thread about that.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Bad?&quot;<br/>
There&#39;s no such thing.<br/>
<br/>
If you want an alternative way to deal with school, here are some ideas:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice">http://sandradodd.com/schoolchoice</a><br/>
<br/>
-=- Would it then mean that he would have to let go of how he was  <br/>

<br/>
He&#39;s four months old.  Let&#39;s not set up such comparisons.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I fear the influence of the opinions of friends and family<br/>
leading him to question my choices for him, and wonder where my  <br/>
boundaries<br/>
as a caring parent can be.-=-<br/>
<br/>
AH!  Don&#39;t make choices for him.  Live with him.  Help him make choice  <br/>
on his own, as he grows, and when he reaches &quot;school age&quot; help him  <br/>
make that choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If I am allowing him freedom of learning, and I<br/>
am resistant to him challenging the boundaries and choices of where he  <br/>
is,<br/>
what are the possibilities?-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a very muddled question.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Freedom of learning&quot; isn&#39;t a good phrase or thought to have here.    <br/>
Learning is learning.  People learn by sensing something and thinking  <br/>
about it, no matter where they are.<br/>
<br/>
The possibilities of muddled thinking are that the mother will never  <br/>
understand her own questions well enough to settle in a place of  <br/>
strength.  The possibilities of resistance are reactions and  <br/>
distancing.  The possibilities of boundaries are dishonesty and  <br/>
rejection and running away.  The possibility of choices is the subject  <br/>
of this list.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/choices">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/messages">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/messages</a><br/>
<br/>
And meanwhile, practice being with your child in the moment, paying  <br/>
attention to what he wants, to giving him more opportunities to see,  <br/>
hear, touch, taste and smell.  Practice being gentle and patient and  <br/>
letting him make decisions like when he&#39;s through looking at something  <br/>
or touching it, instead of moving him or taking it away.<br/>
<br/>
Build trust.  Get to know him in ways you can&#39;t yet imagine parents  <br/>
can know children.  Read some of what&#39;s above, be with your child  <br/>
thoughtfully and then read more and be with your child more.<br/>

<br/>
*****The Northeast Unschooling Conference in August did it for my son, who was thinking of school, mainly cuz all his close friends go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Then he friended some unschoolers from the conference on Facebook and that helped immensely, even some unschooling dads!  We are planning more confernces this year. I would go to many more if we could afford it financially.<br/>
<br/>
Then I also tuned into him even more and was able to make things happen for him to meet more people and spend even more time with his passions. He joined a homeschool co-op on HIS terms and he enjoys being with the kids and *expanding his world* with knowledge, but yet doesn&#39;t have to commit to homework, etc <br/>
<br/>
And he joined a teen geography class at someone&#39;s house, mainly to make more connections. He loves the kids and they do hands-on projects and many social activities have come from that. There are kids in both places that do *schoolwork* but he knows it doesn&#39;t define who they are and whether he can be friendly with them or not. He sees the differences in freedoms and values his life much more.<br/>
<br/>
Then we were able to go ahead with guitar lessons for him and he has become more confident and has been teaching himself even more than the lessons. But he still wants to continue.<br/>
<br/>
We have also made a point to go to homeschool bowling and ice skating where he can gather with others, and anything else that comes about that interests him.<br/>
<br/>
He also started playing Xbox live which allows him to connect with all his school friends, homeschool friends, cousins and others. I hear him laughing and talking in the other room at all hours and I smile. It has been a way to still stay in the mix with his school friends cuz they don&#39;t have much time to get together on weekdays &lt;&lt;G&gt;&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
All of this has made him a happy kid. I asked him the other day if he still thinks he might want to go to school, as I was dropping him off at a Jr high play at the school with his friends. He just shrugged.<br/>
<br/>
I am ok if he does want to go. He might want to see what it is like.  But until that happens or if it even does,  we are forging ahead with life and making it as joyful as we can.<br/>

But they do (maybe some of them don&#39;t really but they have to, that&#39;s another story).<br/>
<br/>
Having watched my son learning immersively at the speed of thought for the past seven years - and having the delights of Foxtel, Google, Wikipedia, YouTube, iTunes, Sony, Nintendo and the rest as part of my own daily lifestyle - even Barack Obama himself (or Kevin Rudd in my case) couldn&#39;t sell me on the idea of sending my son off to join a herd of 20-30 children sitting at desks in a school classroom so he can wait to be taught what somebody who isn&#39;t him (or me) decides he should know whenever that other person feels like teaching it. Using an interactive whiteboard if he&#39;s lucky. Big deal.<br/>
<br/>
Even if I was the only person on this planet doing what I&#39;m doing with my son, I would still be, &quot;You want me to do what? Are you crazy? What kind of dumbass way is that to educate a child in 2010?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Seriously.<br/>

input.&quot; And then left an awkward silence just hanging. Then moved on <br/>
cheerfully to something else.<br/>

I&#39;ve also said, &quot;Well, you might be right.&quot; And, again, just let that <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve also said, &quot;I know, but we&#39;re just taking it one day at a time and <br/>
if it doesn&#39;t seem to be working, we can always put them in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

would YOU allow anybody to speak to you that way?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As far as safeguarding the child - usually I&#39;d just brush off negative <br/>
comments and when my kid saw I didn&#39;t take them seriously, the kid <br/>
didn&#39;t either. I have a sister whose kids went to a strict Christian <br/>
private school - about as far from our lifestyle as possible. We get <br/>
along great. We both thought each other was going off the deep end, but <br/>
we didn&#39;t argue about it - just accepted it as a fact of life. There <br/>
were some inadvertent comments made, over the years, that I might have <br/>
gotten up in arms over, but I just smiled and looked at my wonderful <br/>
kids and later said something like, &quot;Oh, you know how your aunt is - <br/>
just let it go - not worth fussing over.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, my sister would never knowingly hurt my kids&#39; feelings. <br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t hurt her kids&#39; feelings. So it made sense to just <br/>
overlook anything either of us might have said that could have been <br/>
construed as an insult.<br/>
<br/>
But - if someone was being insulting, knew it, and didn&#39;t care? I would <br/>
spend very very little time, if any, around that person.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199202839">I appreciate all the responses and particularly the ways of dealing with<br/>
situations that got shared. I am looking at the various responses I have<br/>
that can keep the space open for my child. Also looking at possibilities<br/>
where my family could meet other unschoolers once my son was of an age to<br/>
enjoy interaction, so they could see how the space was for him and get a<br/>
taste of the reality to help with their imaginary fears.<br/>
<br/>
I am shaken by the question &quot;But - the words you&#39;re talking about are very<br/>
insulting and mean. Why would YOU allow anybody to speak to you that way?&quot;<br/>
and I realize I have no &quot;right&quot; answer. I just let it go because that is how<br/>
they are, and I have enough on my plate without taking on the futile head<br/>
banging of changing them. It doesn&#39;t really hurt me, simply because I know<br/>
that is not true and I know that they don&#39;t think its true either, from<br/>
other things they say, and that these are just their fears striking back to<br/>
try to get me to conform. A child may not understand this, and could see<br/>
failure to &#39;correct&#39; them as guilt? I just go &quot;hmmm...&quot; and that seems to<br/>
end the subject fast. I am wondering that if I am looking at the impact of<br/>
these labels on my child, what is the impact of my non-confrontation? Would<br/>
it seem to validate the accusations, or would I be contributing to a sense<br/>
of inferiority by allowing these mean words that are essentially linked with<br/>
creating an image of deprivation that the child is suffering from because of<br/>
the mother? I guess, like Sandra says, I am not going to be able to talk<br/>
about these &quot;would be&quot; scenarios till I actually get there. But in the<br/>
meanwhile, I am going to be alert to how my behaviour influences what is<br/>
being said to and about me.<br/>

When people are sharing a house, the problem is worse.   If someone  <br/>
visits my house (or my list) I can ask them to be nice or go home.  If  <br/>
someone lives with me (my husband, or if I were staying with in-laws)  <br/>
then I can&#39;t say &quot;Shush up in my house!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could say &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s helpful for you to be that way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I could say &quot;SHUT UP, ignoramus!&quot; but then I&#39;ve probably done worse  <br/>
than they did, and have established an acceptable limit for what kinds  <br/>
of things can be said in response.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could say that both of you have said things from fear and  <br/>
frustration, and that it would probably be good to try to think, and  <br/>
breathe, and only say things you&#39;d be willing for the child to hear  <br/>
and maybe repeat.  That might be a way to have a time of cooling off  <br/>
and learning new habits before he&#39;s old enough to pick up and copy, or  <br/>
be wounded by, the words themselves.  Already the tone and mood must  <br/>
not be healthy for him.<br/>
<br/>
That might also be a good exercise in seeing how it feels to put his  <br/>
needs first.   Creating an environment that&#39;s gentle and sweet for him  <br/>
will also be a gentle, sweet environment for the adults.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-822319001">***The thing is, my sister would never knowingly hurt my kids&#39; feelings. <br/>
And I wouldn&#39;t hurt her kids&#39; feelings. So it made sense to just <br/>
overlook anything either of us might have said that could have been <br/>
construed as an insult.***<br/>
<br/>
This so much mirrors my relationship with my sister and her family!  They are very religious and very conservative, so most of our differences come from that, and I imagine there are plenty of folks, even here on this list, that might have similar differences to me and my family.<br/>
<br/>
My sister and I have the same kind of sense of humor, like many of the same books and movies and tv shows.  We&#39;ve on again off again liked the same kind of music.  She&#39;s the one who introduced Chamille to Shaun of the Dead, which is a really great horror movie spoof.<br/>
<br/>
One time my sister wrote a meanish comment on my blog, but then later that day sent an apology via email.<br/>
<br/>
I know many people don&#39;t have the same kind of great family relationships.  I figure, what I&#39;m doing by unschooling is giving my kids a great family relationship, so that, if they grow up and do completely different things from one another, that they&#39;ll still be kind and thoughtful towards each other and their parents.  I know a parent doesn&#39;t have to unschool to do that, but the way in which unschooling focuses on relationships, it would be hard to not have that happen as a huge side effect.<br/>

The idea that children go to school to get an education because that&#39;s  <br/>
what schools are for and if children don&#39;t go to school they must  <br/>
necessarily remain ignorant might have made some kind of sense in 1910  <br/>
but it&#39;s so seriously out of date in 2010 I&#39;m amazed so many people  <br/>
still believe it. But they do (maybe some of them don&#39;t really but  <br/>
they have to, that&#39;s another story).<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Vidyut is in India.  There are some realities there that are long gone  <br/>
in the U.S.  There are many languages in use, and not all the parents  <br/>
are readers and writers in all the languages around them.   It&#39;s a  <br/>
different situation.  School isn&#39;t mandatory, and I don&#39;t think there  <br/>
are free government schools.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Having watched my son learning immersively at the speed of thought  <br/>
for the past seven years - and having the delights of Foxtel, Google,  <br/>
Wikipedia, YouTube, iTunes, Sony, Nintendo and the rest as part of my  <br/>
own daily lifestyle - even Barack Obama himself (or Kevin Rudd in my  <br/>
case) couldn&#39;t sell me on the idea of sending my son off to join a  <br/>
herd of 20-30 children sitting at desks in a school classroom so he  <br/>
can wait to be taught what somebody who isn&#39;t him (or me) decides he  <br/>
should know whenever that other person feels like teaching it. Using  <br/>
an interactive whiteboard if he&#39;s lucky. Big deal.-=-<br/>
<br/>
For a family in India with internet and the means to travel some,  <br/>
that&#39;s just as possible as it is here.  Still they face the more-than- <br/>
one-language need.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-548948178">While I&#39;m really glad Jenny and her sister and Pam and her sister get  <br/>
along despite differences, and that&#39;s awesome, I do want to say  <br/>
something to anyone who will listen, about this:<br/>
<br/>
-=One time my sister wrote a meanish comment on my blog, but then  <br/>
later that day sent an apology via email.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Tell your kids, if it becomes important.  Remember it in other  <br/>
situations, in other ways.<br/>
<br/>
A public insult should receive a public apology.<br/>
Shaming someone on national TV and sending them a postcard saying  <br/>
&quot;Sorry&quot; is insufficient and cowardly.  It causes the person you  <br/>
apologized to need to go on national TV and say &quot;I received an  <br/>
apology,&quot; or to just say and do nothing and let that HUGE insult stand.<br/>
<br/>
Countless times now in the SCA, around homeschooling, and with friends  <br/>
people have badmouthed me in such a way that they hoped they would  <br/>
look good in public while I looked worse.  Then most of them (I do  <br/>
have a good track record for people feeling bad about being mean to  <br/>
me) have apologized, but few of them were big or bright enough to  <br/>
apologize in the same forum or at the same level as the harm had been  <br/>
done.<br/>
<br/>
A private note saying &quot;I&#39;m sorry I disfigured your statue&quot; is wrong.   <br/>
It would be better for someone to feel so bad for having written a  <br/>
tacky personal note that they make a beautiful statue.   The apology  <br/>
should be bigger than the original insult, not teensy-smaller.<br/>

my dd is 9 and up until last september(2009) she had never been to playgroup, nursery or school.....<br/>
she decided she wanted to give school a try and i was happy for her to go ahead with this..... well i say happy the day she went i cried for 2 days.... :-(<br/>
BUT she is happy, she decided she wanted to go and she loves it.  so i am happy for her.  yes i would love her to be home, and the days she is ill (or says she ill ;-) ), and the teacher training days and the holidays and the weekends are great, but i feel the girl i know would not have been happy if she had not been able to go with her choice. <br/>
<br/>
i have read extensively about unschooling and i believe this is one aspect of giving her freedom of choice and enabling her to do something she wants to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-589410389">*&quot;They are very religious and very conservative, so most of our differences<br/>
come from that, and I imagine there are plenty of folks, even here on this<br/>
list, that might have similar differences to me and my family.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
I can so relate with that.<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;The apology should be bigger than the original insult, not<br/>
teensy-smaller.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
I agree that it should be, but I find many a slip between the brochure and<br/>
trip... Often, what I think should be becomes irrelevant when faced with<br/>
what all needs to be, right now that I can do something about, like<br/>
maintaining peace, like ensuring the child is not surrounded by raised<br/>
voices, or suffers for any residual anger against me for being &#39;different&#39;.<br/>
Of course I am different. I&#39;m here, but it becomes very important that I<br/>
don&#39;t give further ammunition for loving conversations like &quot;Oh, sweetheart,<br/>
your mom means well, but she doesn&#39;t understand responsibility. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
understand that her choices are making life so difficult for you. If I could<br/>
halp it, I would never deprive you of an education&quot; etc. THAT is my<br/>
problem.<br/>
<br/>
They aren&#39;t being nasty. They actually believe it. They love me, but the<br/>
stakes are high - a child&#39;s entire life, and they fear the unknown. They are<br/>
unable to see anything else than what they believe is right. They don&#39;t see<br/>
anything they should be apologizing for. They don&#39;t have a clue that  the<br/>
world is vastly different from how they imagine, even if Nisarga goes to<br/>
school, education is not how they imagine it to be. For example, their idea<br/>
of discipline, hitting, scolding, is illegal in schools today. They grew up<br/>
with it. They can&#39;t imagine a child growing up okay without &quot;strong<br/>
guidance&quot;. It isn&#39;t that they are knowingly doing wrong by me, but they are<br/>
genuinely mourning the deprivation of their grandchild they perceive.<br/>
<br/>
Not having actually experienced the reality of their grandchild being<br/>
&quot;disciplined&quot;, they imagine that it is a good thing. If I know them, my MIL<br/>
would be the first to take him out of school if she saw him being hit and<br/>
crying. After her initial beliefs about crying being good for him, she has<br/>
started loving being sensitive to him so much, that there are times when he<br/>
has a stomach upset and will not stop crying when she will descend on me to<br/>
say, &quot;What kind of a mother are you. Make him stop&quot; and I am like, &quot;Hey, you<br/>
think I&#39;m holding him in my arms cheering him on? I would love for him not<br/>
to feel so sad, but I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the matter.&quot;, but I just love it<br/>
that she will stand up for him. He needs that - for his grandmom to be tuned<br/>
in to his happiness being a priority. Unfortunately, the harm of schools has<br/>
gone far more subtle. No one hits kids in &#39;good&#39; schools any more. They<br/>
simply make little kid templates out of them.<br/>
<br/>
*&quot;Vidyut is in India. There are some realities there that are long gone in<br/>
the U.S. There are many languages in use, and not all the parents are<br/>
readers and writers in all the languages around them. It&#39;s a different<br/>
situation. School isn&#39;t mandatory, and I don&#39;t think there are free<br/>
government schools.&quot;*<br/>
<br/>
You know more about the unschooling legalities in India than I do. I didn&#39;t<br/>
know that school was not mandatory. With the all encompassing literacy<br/>
campaign, it had never occurred to me that it wasn&#39;t. There are free<br/>
government schools, I think. We call them municipal schools. I think they<br/>
are totally free. There are various NGOs working to ensure that education<br/>
reaches all, and other &#39;off-beat&#39; options like &#39;each one teach one&#39; and<br/>
other adult literacy campaigns, night schools, distance education<br/>
programmes, and more. While I don&#39;t know if I can be arrested for<br/>
unschooling Nisarga, there will certainly be social criticism and it has<br/>
more &#39;weight&#39; because society is quite a large part of life here, while<br/>
fighting law is a &#39;compartment&#39; of life, even for a self-proclaimed recluse<br/>
like me. From what I hear, society is far more tightly knit here than many<br/>
&#39;developed&#39; places in the world. Not that living in Mumbai I qualify to be<br/>
living in an undeveloped place, but there is more freedom. That I completely<br/>
accept. I am lucky. I don&#39;t see the languages thing as an issue. No one in<br/>
India knows all its languages. 13 languages is just the tip of the iceberg.<br/>
Languages have their own writing structures and often scripts too. There are<br/>
over 53 common dialects that are significantly different, which use letters<br/>
from the standardized language if at all there is a written form.<br/>
<br/>
Most people in urban India speak at least three/four languages naturally -<br/>
the mother tongue, Hindi, English and the regional language, if you live in<br/>
a place that speaks other than your mother tongue. It doesn&#39;t take<br/>
&#39;learning&#39;. You just grow up communicating, rather than speaking languages.<br/>
Schools teach at least two (Hindi-English) and often all three formally.<br/>
Most people are fairly fluent in languages they end up encountering, because<br/>
absorbing them is a part of our social reality and a skill that we never<br/>
lose. I read and write well in three languages, speak five languages<br/>
fluently, can communicate enough to get by in another three languages and<br/>
eight dialects and used to know two more that I stopped needing and now<br/>
don&#39;t remember well. When I come across a language I don&#39;t know, I can<br/>
simply absorb it fast - I learned Swiss-German, German, French and Italian<br/>
like that - I can&#39;t read them, but I used to talk enough to communicate with<br/>
trekking clients in the Himalaya. I&#39;ve stopped that work, and don&#39;t need<br/>
them any more. And I&#39;m not exceptional. It just is. I think once you<br/>
experience a certain number of languages, its simply about learning patterns<br/>
that fit everywhere, and using them as needed. I don&#39;t see schools being<br/>
needed to provide this. Living in this country is enough interactive<br/>
learning. Travelling is even better.<br/>
<br/>
I think &#39;teaching languages&#39; kills this. In India, learning languages is<br/>
mostly unschooling style even for people who send their kids to school. It<br/>
&#39;teaches&#39; communication, which sets you up with all languages for life.<br/>

&gt; All the time.  That is what my parents and in-laws think there is a  <br/>
&gt; problem. :)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I asked because there are plenty of video games which use writing and  <br/>
spelling. Does he play any games that need him to type and spell? Like  <br/>
on-line RPG&#39;s?<br/>
<br/>
My 14-year-old daughter learned to spell, write, and use correct  <br/>
punctuation by reading and playing games on her own around the age of  <br/>
11, plus corresponding and playing with friends on-line from about 12  <br/>
onward. She&#39;s not much for cursive, but prints legibly. But she types  <br/>
like a mad thing - fast and accurate.  That&#39;s a skill that will  <br/>
probably be way more important than handwriting down the road.<br/>
<br/>
Video game playing can lead to jobs and careers and perhaps you have  <br/>
told him that. And you could probably tell him all sorts of success  <br/>
stories. But somehow, his grandparents are doing their level best to  <br/>
make him feel &quot;not enough&quot; (and at 13, for heaven&#39;s sake). What  <br/>
teacher-grandparents know about the job market and what it&#39;s going to  <br/>
be like for him when he&#39;s ready would probably fit in a thimble (which  <br/>
not may people use anymore either!).<br/>
<br/>
I reiterate my suggestion to run interference on the relatives.  <br/>
&quot;Testing&quot; kids is rude and inconsiderate and he should be protected  <br/>
from it.  If you&#39;re not there, you should set some boundaries. Besides  <br/>
undermining him, it undermines you, because it suggests you don&#39;t know  <br/>
what you&#39;re doing if the poor kid can&#39;t write (and won&#39;t get a diploma  <br/>
and won&#39;t get a job).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837220282">Hey Vidyut,<br/>
i&#39;m sure we&#39;ll meet or chat soon.  <br/>
<br/>
To All:<br/>
My husband&#39;s family is still not on board in some ways and yet are sweet enough to voice their dissension in soft ways.  So i am very fortunate in that regard.  But the most important aspect of our unschooling life here is that my husband, Ravi, is of the strong opinion that its nobody&#39;s business how we raise our children.  And that strong stand has been sensed by both our families.  So they rarely interfere.  I am grateful for his strength in this matter as i spent too much energy early on defending and explaining to family members.  I&#39;ve grown calmer, more comfortable in my unschooling-skin and hence don&#39;t defend any more.  I simply state &quot;yes, Raghu plays video games a lot&quot; and smile ;-) &quot;yes, Zoya eats Nutella as she pleases&quot; and smile.<br/>
<br/>
However i do what i can to alleviate their fears.  When possible i will show them things the kids are working on .  I will tell them of other unschooling/homeschooling families in the world and in India too.  I explain the principles behind the way we approach food etc.  It probably goes over their heads... but its what i can do given that their presence in our lives here in INdia is important to me and Ravi.<br/>
<br/>
My family has an easier time because they expect the unexpected from me.  And i have a sister who is very in tune with the principles of unschooling more so because the principles have helped with various relationships in her life. She helps in giving my parents a perspective.<br/>
<br/>
However a big aspect of our lives here could have been Mother-in-law moving in with us.  She is alone and could easily have been with us.  However I think our lifestyle made her too uncomfortable.  And I found that Ravi had the foresight to see that a permanent move would have jeopardized the peace in the house.  Having her visit us often is better all around.  I admire Ravi for his ability to draw that line and not succumb to the emotional aspect.<br/>
