<div id="ygrps-yiv-459792047">I am getting ready to write my reply to this and would love to hear<br/>
input from you all. My basic feeling is that I would want to know more<br/>
about the environment of the kids who did develop adhd (was tv the only<br/>
thing available etc)...my kids do tons of active/creative stuff in<br/>
addition (and while) watching tv so I am not worried but I tend to be<br/>
one of the only tv advocates on my local hsing board and would like to<br/>
encourage others to do so as well. My other point is going to be how sad<br/>
it is to make someone feel bad about something that they enjoy.<br/>

&quot; Child-development experts have long warned there are plenty of reasons<br/>
for kids not to watch too much television. Now a major Seattle-based<br/>
study shows that very young children who spend hours in front of the<br/>
tube risk having attention problems when they reach school age.<br/>
<br/>
 In the first research of its kind, scientists at Children&#39;s Hospital &<br/>
Regional Medical Center and their colleagues found the risk increases by<br/>
the hour.<br/>
<br/>
 For every hour of television watched daily by children at ages 1 and 3,<br/>
the risk of attention problems at age 7 increases nearly 10 percent.&quot;<br/>

This could be corelation and not causation, that is maybe very young kids who have the physical attributes (whatever) of ADD will be drawn to television.<br/>
<br/>
I figure that it is possible that TV DOES rewire our brains to process visual images more rapidly, but I don&#39;t think that that is necessarily a bad and scary thing.  Our brains actuall are kind flexible so that they can be tailored or adapted to the environment that we live in.  Probably all the best pilots and air traffic controlers in the year 2050 will have to grow up playing videogames to have the synapses they need to run the computer consoles that they work at.<br/>

(I got this idea from a book, but can&#39;t remember which one.  Sydney Blum... something?)<br/>

<br/>
You might wonder that if a trained, expert, certified teacher can&#39;t be at<br/>
least as interesting as a TV program, the problem isn&#39;t with TV or the<br/>
kid but in the belief kids need to pay attention to boring, blathering<br/>
drones in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s more evidence kids are smarter than the school officials who<br/>
overwhelmingly suffer from reasoning deficit disorder - a condition<br/>
caused by school attendance.   <br/>
