<div id="ygrps-yiv-377421611">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s ok to post this here.  Is there another list just <br/>
for conference/gathering announcements?<br/>
<br/>
Here is the info for a fantastic three night gathering in the beautiful <br/>
mountains of eastern Tennessee. The dates are March 14th through the <br/>
17th.  The cabins are super nice, a good size and have fully equipped <br/>
kitchens. (no tvs, no internet, though there is internet at another <br/>
building)    We would love to see you there!  There are 30 cabins in <br/>
all.  (And RV and tent areas.) Twenty cabins are currently reserved <br/>
specifically for this gathering, thirteen of which are taken, last I <br/>
looked.  The remaining cabins are also possibilities if not taken yet by <br/>
the general public.  Here&#39;s the link for the yahoo group list. (though <br/>
the list description mentions the last gathering in November &#39;08, not <br/>
the one coming up in March) <br/>

<br/>
Check out the database to see who has signed up for the upcoming <br/>
gathering!  There is also a link for the state park (Roan Mt.) in the <br/>
links section.   Then start planning on how you can join us!<br/>
<br/>
Hope to see lots of you there!</div>
