<div id="ygrps-yiv-226659154">As Zak&#39;s last day at school approaches and I&#39;ve been reading the fears<br/>
that some of us have about what their kids might miss out on because of<br/>
not going to school, I was thinking about what I won&#39;t miss about Zak<br/>
going to school and what I will miss.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t miss waking him up at 7am so that he can have breakfast, be<br/>
awake and leave at 8am to drive to school<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t miss making Zak go to bed by 8pm so that he&#39;s awake in the<br/>
morning, when he does his best talking and questioning at 10:30pm.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t miss insisting that Zak turn his light off when he&#39;s been<br/>
reading for 2 hours and he&#39;s still awake and wants to continue to read<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t miss feeling a sense of panic every morning about getting<br/>
everything done, lunch made, breakfast in him, clothes on to get him to<br/>
school &quot;on time&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t miss prying out of Zak what he&#39;s been doing all day when he&#39;s<br/>
been gone for 7 hours and I have no idea what he&#39;s been up too.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t miss picking him up and finding him sitting in the office<br/>
because he couldn&#39;t sit still in home room<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t miss paying $640 per month for Zak to be away from home.<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t miss hearing Zak say &quot;but I don&#39;t want to go to school today,<br/>
why can&#39;t I go just a couple of days a week to play with my friends?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
To be honest here&#39;s what I will miss:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will miss having a tidy house because of only having Max at home<br/>
<br/>
I will miss having some quiet time to myself when Max takes a nap<br/>
<br/>
I will miss spending time with Max on his own and focusing on him<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522589667">Nothing to do with the subject of the post but I just had our 4th baby and<br/>
he&#39;s called Zachary Max -- couldn&#39;t help pick up on your boys&#39; names:)<br/>
