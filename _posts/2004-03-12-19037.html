&gt; As it stands today, right now, what<br/>
&gt; proof do<br/>
&gt; home/unschooled individuals provide to show that<br/>
&gt; they have had an<br/>
&gt; education? Do they get a GED or a high-school<br/>
&gt; equivalency diploma<br/>
&gt; issued by their state, or is there something else<br/>
&gt; that is done?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**My eldest non-skooled son decided to enter the local community college at<br/>
17yo. He drove himself down there, told the admissions office he was<br/>
homeschooled and, according to him, they rolled out the proverbial red<br/>
carpet for him. Apparently, they are greatly enamored of homeschoolers here.<br/>
He needed no *evidence* of his studies other than his own words to take the<br/>
same placement tests that all incoming students take. My only involvement<br/>
was to provide his tuition money.<br/>
<br/>
Two years later, he has gone from parttime to fulltime enrollment, manages a<br/>
restaurant and a luxury carwash and has lived in his own apartment for the<br/>
past seven months. This weekend he is moving into a brand new apartment<br/>
complex because the lower utilites will actually save him money and he&#39;ll be<br/>
able to meet more girls and use free workout facilities &lt;G&gt;. None of his<br/>
employers required any *proof* of his education either. His excellent<br/>
communication skills seemed to have spoken for themselves.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Your word alone isn&#39;t enough, there has to be<br/>
<br/>
*tangible proof*.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
**I would contend that * tangible proof* can be found in the stories of<br/>
adult unschoolers. I have provided one and there is a wealth of others to be<br/>
found...check out Peter Kowalke&#39;s documentary, for example. As others have<br/>
stated, the wisdom of those parents who have lived through ages of offspring<br/>
that you have yet to experience is an invaluable resource. Wish I had had<br/>
the internet twenty years ago when I was first pregnant and thought I was<br/>
the only attachment Mother on the planet outside of the pages of<br/>
&quot;Mothering&quot;!<br/>
