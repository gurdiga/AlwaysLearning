and such she dont want to make the paper doll furniture she now wants to desine <br/>
rooms houses ext on the net ..guess we will be looking for  P.C. programs that <br/>
do that as we cant find any on the net , except one that desines citys. she <br/>
played with that a while and got out her pencils and paper and drew the rooms.<br/>
also now she wants to researh animals  and go to St. Louis to a day camp for <br/>
zoo keepers.<br/>
I thank you all again for incourging this move for our faimly not only  is she <br/>
learning more in areas that she wants on her own ,she reminds me of a hungry <br/>
person devoering the freedom to learn in areas or play in areas she wants.(only <br/>
problem is we have to make her take a break and eat food lol)<br/>
but we have seen MAJOR break thrus in her atachment disorder. i mean major!!!!<br/>
  there is also a big difference in her persolality. she is gaining self <br/>
esteam.she has insite a month ago they told me  she wasnt capable of.EVERYONE <br/>
inc the teacher that still has limited contact  with can tell the diffrence.<br/>
   always before this month  when she would speak of her future it was if I can <br/>
get to collage or mom do I have to move out when i am 18  if I cant get a good <br/>
enough job to pay the bills? Now it is  mom would it be ok if I join the peace <br/>
Cor.? or something like that I want to  help others.and mom can I stay home <br/>
schooled and get my Ged and go to collage before I am 18  so I can join the <br/>
peace cor at 18? orwould it be ok if i help at gardening with the eldery or at <br/>

this child just couldnt cope with there lil  box in school. the fault was with <br/>
them and there system . I for one belive she has learned more in the last mo.<br/>
(it even been that long) than all 3  the past years combined.<br/>

I am absolutlely, positively sure that everyone here will agree, that you <br/>
have demonstrated what a huge priority your daughter is for you and are <br/>
thrilled that you had the courage to fight the system and do what is best for <br/>
you both. Good luck in your journey. It will be like a walk in the park <br/>
somedays and a ride on a roller coaster other days, but all the days are <br/>
filled with the joy of loving each other. Even on the days you want to ring <br/>
their necks. That feeling is momentary and then it hits you, this is my kid <br/>
and look what we have together.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes to you both,<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda<br/>

Yay!  This is wonderful.  I know it took a LOT of courage for you to go<br/>
against the advice you were getting from people in the system.  You were<br/>
insightful to figure out what would benefit your daughter and you were<br/>
BRAVE to do it against the opposition you faced.  I am happy for both of you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1298783061">Dee, I&#39;m so happy for your daughter and you!  I&#39;m also excted to share <br/>
my magnetic paper doll ideas.  I&#39;ve made a list of what I used to make <br/>
ours:<br/>
<br/>
1)Printmaster.com sells their series of art and craft programs.  I&#39;ve <br/>
been using Printmaster for years for everything and promise you won&#39;t <br/>
regret buying it.  Their newest is what you need to get...Printmaster <br/>
Platinum 15 DVD.  It&#39;s online for $39.99.  If you try to buy it in a <br/>
store you&#39;ll get stuck with about 8 CD-Roms...ugh!  Go online and order <br/>
the DVD where everything is on one.  On the program are period rooms you <br/>
can print out on full sheets and just line them up on your frig or <br/>
freezer for the house rooms.  They also have hundreds of animals, toys, <br/>
food, etc...your imagination&#39;s the limit for the magnetic house.  We <br/>
even had a secret garden on our frig with Pegasus and a baby lamb.<br/>
<br/>
2) MisterInkJet.com - go to specialty paper and they have reasonable <br/>
packages of magnetic paper.  They also sell T-shirt transfer paper, <br/>
canvas paper, shrink-a-dink paper, vinyl cling paper, and fuzzy paper. <br/>
 They have lots more, too, but these are some of the really fun ones. <br/>
 If you order over a certain total price, shipping is free.<br/>
<br/>
3)  I printed our dolls and their clothes from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.paperdolls.com/pages/pdgallry.htm#top">http://www.paperdolls.com/pages/pdgallry.htm#top</a><br/>
Their dolls are very artistic, beautiful and literary.  They have dolls <br/>
from classic novels like Little Women, Vanity Fair, Wuthering Heights, <br/>
Mansfield Park, Sense & Sensibility, Great Expectations.  There is also <br/>
famous old-time movie stars and celebrities.  There are great boyish <br/>
paper dolls like Alexander the Great, Hadrian, Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, <br/>
King David, Michaelangelo, and Shakespeare.  Anyway, check them out. <br/>
 They really are gorgeous and fun.  And if you have a scanner or know <br/>
someone who does, shink your kids down so they can dress themselves with <br/>
all the cool period clothes.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and have fun.  We&#39;ve been enjoying ours for over 6 months and <br/>
they still love it.  Nobody in the house can resist messing with them <br/>
when we walk by the frig.  It&#39;s especially amusing to put the ladies <br/>
clothes on the men and vice versa.  Example: Alexander the Great&#39;s arms <br/>
are attached to his clothes, so when you put his clothes on, say, Amy of <br/>
Little Women, you get a beautiful young girl with HUGE biceps. We&#39;ve <br/>
also been added seasonal additions and holiday stuff, like a Christmas tree.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day everyone!  HeidiC<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648311375">Dee,<br/>
We recently ordered a free reality based CD-ROM game, &quot;Building Homes of our <br/>
Own&quot;. The object is to build a well planned, well designed home.  Players can <br/>
also identify and address any environmental and community issues, as well as <br/>
sell their home to the best qualified buyer. Here&#39;s the addy if you and your <br/>
daughter would like to check it out.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homesofourown.com/">http://www.homesofourown.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
So glad to read of your daughters unschooling success and so proud for you <br/>
too for being brave enough to trust yourself and your daughter. We&#39;re two <br/>
years new to unschooling our previously schooled, now 14 and 9 yo daughters. <br/>
It&#39;s also been a wonderful life changing experience for us, but especially <br/>
for our oldest who struggled with anxieties that we now are certain were <br/>
entirely school related. She&#39;s now the happy girl that she was before going <br/>
into the system and is so comforted in knowing that she can now do it &#39;this&#39; <br/>
way for the rest of her life.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962994428">well the word is out!!!<br/>
and I probley way over my head .<br/>
not once but 2x people sought me out today at work reguarding  unschooling . <br/>
yecks I to new at this.and the conversation with one turned into 3 others <br/>
joining the conversation with that what is the diffrence in Lisa, and gee, Dee <br/>
if she never learns another thing she has learned self esteem and how to laugh <br/>
again. and other such coments  all day . she reealy has bloomed you wouldnt <br/>
hardley know it was the same kid.I am so proud of her!<br/>
She has talked one woman into teaching her french acourding to her she was told <br/>
she couldnt take yer. (to my shame I didnt know she wanted to learn french,)I <br/>
was told she will teach her free if i buy the beging book at barns and noble  <br/>
next week. the lessons have begain casualy in my flower garden while they weed <br/>
and chat  as it is a place we tend to hang on nice days weeding each other <br/>
yards.neibor says it the best way to learn frenh. I must say i agree. and as it <br/>
one my favorite times weeding my flower beds with neibors I also will be <br/>
learning french. but I seem to forget a hour latter  Lisa on the other hand <br/>
keeps sayin colors and something to do with green beans and chicken. lol<br/>
   There is a woman in the next town over  asked another woman to get my phone <br/>
no as she is supose to send her child to kidergarden next year and dont want to <br/>
she says he not ready and neither am I  ask that woman that pulled her kid out <br/>
last mo. how I can do this .I gave them my no explained why I did what I did <br/>
and how I am unschooling not home schooling and how yes i think she is learning <br/>
in fact she has learned more now than she ever did and guess what I think she <br/>
has a better chance to retain  it as she doing it acording to  what she wants. <br/>
(I do wonder if she will ever slow down that part has me worried a bit but I <br/>
think she just was hungry for what she wanted and when she finds I not pulling <br/>
the new buffett away she will slow down.)<br/>
  another woman  is suddnly finding the supperintedent very very diffucult to <br/>
deal with . he is now sticking to a dead line of jan 1 2003. for open enrolling <br/>
the girls to a diffrent districk. wants hers and mine to stay dull enrolled <br/>
here. we found that open enrollment to a place she has been taking hers for <br/>
free  for help in area the child wanted to study in  would suite us better. as <br/>
we both want to do  unschooling and we decided we  where  not happy with dul <br/>
enroll for next year. so... well NOW he says no dul or out  not open to a <br/>
diffrent districk. It was pointed out to us the scholl just spent 1000&#39;s adding <br/>
on.and will cost them around 8 grand (plus fact  mine is special needs kid so <br/>
means more money)we spent a lot of time talking tonight  and decided to try the <br/>
school board and his higher ups but if that dont work then we will just out em <br/>
he gets no funding for them . and go the route of having to hire a teacher  <br/>
somewhere with ia. certifaction. to look at  samples ext. Ia law very easy to <br/>
understand and we will just choose a diffrent option so they can worrie about  <br/>
losing the money and the control they are under the illusion they  have.<br/>
 well like I said daughter has seem to make a impression on this small <br/>
community. today she did some volnteer stuff and every one keeps asking her  <br/>
why she doing what she doing her answer is I live in this town it makes me <br/>
happy. and kids where asking what she do to get punished, she told them nota I <br/>
want to it makes me feel good and besides it is fun. by 7 tonight she had 3 <br/>
kids going around getting donations  with the poppys for the leigon. ask her <br/>
what they for she says these people take care of the flags and they  put on <br/>
dances and let every group in town use there building and  my grandma is buried <br/>
there next to  them and they make the cemeatary a show place in Iowa (lots come <br/>
take pictures they do make it look pretty) she told them this is my way of <br/>
saying thank you. she has slowly(ok quickly) moved from being the sad lil girl <br/>
that was picked on to the one at least the younger ones want to be like . and <br/>
doing wonderful  so wonderful others want to  take a lil more time and keep <br/>
there&#39;s home. <br/>
See what ya all started here in lil small town in Iowa with all your <br/>
incourgement  and wonderful views and inspiring one scared mom.<br/>
 I look forward to  seeing your post&#39;s and have learned so much.<br/>
oh and i ordered the cd before I started this post thank you.<br/>

&gt; So glad to read of your daughters unschooling success and so proud for you <br/>
&gt; too for being brave enough to trust yourself and your daughter. We&#39;re two <br/>
&gt; years new to unschooling our previously schooled, now 14 and 9 yo daughters. <br/>
&gt; It&#39;s also been a wonderful life changing experience for us, but especially <br/>
&gt; for our oldest who struggled with anxieties that we now are certain were <br/>
&gt; entirely school related. She&#39;s now the happy girl that she was before going <br/>
&gt; into the system and is so comforted in knowing that she can now do it &#39;this&#39; <br/>
&gt; way for the rest of her life.<br/>

You can&#39;t expect a steep learning curve all the time.  People slow down, and <br/>
speed up, and things go in fits and starts.  Sometimes all of a sudden I get <br/>

Please don&#39;t think it&#39;s not working if your daughter has a week or a month of <br/>

<br/>
About the dual enrollment and whether they get funding, if they are NOT <br/>
getting any funding, why is there any communication with the superintendent <br/>
at all?   If they ARE getting funds, then it&#39;s really important to them where <br/>
you&#39;re enrolled.  But if you&#39;re not going to school anyway, what do you care?<br/>

The less contact you have with them, the less you have to worry what they <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523075772">giggleing<br/>
in iowa ya have to show certian things or get cked out by a teacher.<br/>
they want there hand in it. we are sayin No. we found a way to open enroll in a <br/>
diffrent  scholl would let us do what we wanted not any other way and they <br/>
would :see the girls at least 2 x a year acourding to Iowa and they get the <br/>
funding. or we hire some one who swears to the state we doing it this or that <br/>
to show improvment is all ste requires. or we can choose to have them tested in <br/>
the school  thru the basic skills test again must show improvement. and some <br/>
one said something about in the 30 percent of something. we talked decided hire <br/>
teacheer 2x a year of  open enroll geet free stuff and resorses (one we chose <br/>
lets you pick)and we can get great discounts  or free into places wwe want to <br/>
go any way. we thought this was our best avenue and weould be left alone they <br/>
tring to stop it say we missed dead line only way is to move in that districk. <br/>
she is looking into  moving kids  mailing adress to a friends I am looking into <br/>
hire a teacher if all else fails and have  them look at work in a file  we have <br/>
to keep by law.if we miss dead line and I of corse did we can only take all out <br/>
and hire certifed or we can dual enroll  . most superintendents  use it as <br/>
guide line and forgo the dead line but ours has a new  building to pay for <br/>
(what I think)<br/>
mostly we are trying to get them out of our lives!!!! we will do more resurch <br/>
this week  we are tired of being told we have to do this or that and inderectly <br/>
(in our opion )threatened.again we live in small town and they are quick to <br/>
piont out my math ablities. and I told them so she has iep saying she cant <br/>
learn what she knows now of corse they want me to re test her grrrrrrrrr. I <br/>
said why the test you just did last month invalid? it was a basic skills test <br/>
why i need to  pay for it again well they say begining next year  she will need <br/>
to do another one. nope not acording to Iowa law she dont if we choose a  <br/>
diffrent option and this last one will seve as there base line just fine.<br/>
I do worrie  I cause to much a stink.I probley shouldnt had corrected him in <br/>
that manner. but tryed to tell me I had to do 2  things(and part of another) <br/>
law says one way  choose it very very plain. but like I said hire teacher to <br/>
look at file 2x a year. make next dead line  he still loses his  money and  <br/>
controll. I will make dead line for next  year  this is silly of him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069243432">lol we tell then  both way I guess more we explaine that she is learning and <br/>
what she is learning.  when we talk about un/or home school it is like  we are <br/>
undoing what has been done and teach in way they understand. but point taken I <br/>
am teaching at home.and should watch my vocablery a lil closer.<br/>
when we talk about the way we are doing what we do we  where mostly telling we <br/>
are  not  a minture school.as people ask how we can work full time and how we <br/>
find time to do all those cirruclums. we tell them i havent looked in a <br/>
ciruculm but have been all over the net.(also  she is taking the choir and math <br/>
there for 2 more days  as I agreed  to with the supperintendent as long as it <br/>
done her way and at her rate) and my friend  does some with cirrculms that her <br/>
daughter has choose . aand  our primary consern was and is what effect the <br/>
school has had on these 2 girls socaly. and inside of them. but learning they <br/>
are.<br/>
to me it is kind of like my friend explained it she use to ask her daughter <br/>
about her day and was  always told :I stood in lines got yelled at a lot ate <br/>
lunch so and so made fun of me. now she gets  i had fun I read about  how it <br/>
was in the &quot;old days when---- and i helped figure out how to double a recipe <br/>
and I showed so and so how to make a glued quilt square to hang on a wall&quot;<br/>
there was much dission in the lil convence store this evening and  mostly is <br/>
was homeschool is better because it is so unlike school and more hands on and <br/>
real. and that we can do better as parents and  every one seemd to know someone <br/>
home schooled that was this or that now.<br/>
