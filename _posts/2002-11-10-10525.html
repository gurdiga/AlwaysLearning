&lt;&lt; Peggy, thanks very much for your clear and soothing words on my arrogance <br/>
question.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Since it isn&#39;t provable at this point beyond personal experience, why <br/>
should<br/>
the teaching theory that advocates using the carrot and a stick method hold<br/>
more weight than the personal experience of individual families who have found<br/>
that the carrot and the stick approach distorts and limits the potential of<br/>
the human mind to learn?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I nearly cried, and this isn&#39;t even about &quot;true love&quot; or particular pain.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I am influenced by political correctness.  Perhaps I am arrogant to <br/>
choose a politically correct stance and cling to it with feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s my thinking:  <br/>
<br/>
I HAVE seen families with shit for brains, and while I feel sorry for my <br/>
kids, I wouldn&#39;t want my kids to hang around with them, nor to marry them, <br/>
nor to work with or for them, nor to live in their neighborhoods.  [Some of <br/>
those families are my blood relatives, which might be about to cause my <br/>
current theory (not belief, not conviction) to bite its own tail.]<br/>
<br/>
Either my kids are genetically superior, and my parenting/homeschooling <br/>
beliefs seem right because they&#39;re &quot;just that way,&quot; or they are not superior <br/>
to other children.<br/>
<br/>
If we go with the greatest mythos of the U.S., that all men are created <br/>
equal, which is just about the only politically correct thing we can do in <br/>
2002 in the U.S. (NZ, Australia, Canada and U.K. can pass or play on this <br/>
position as feels right), then...<br/>
<br/>
The only logical or defensible position for me is that my children&#39;s behavior <br/>
and their abilities (at least in such areas as are considered &quot;scholastic,&quot;) <br/>
must be directly attributable to the way they were raised.<br/>
<br/>
How unstable or volatile does my position become if I don&#39;t fully believe <br/>
that?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I believe not taking a stand when one<br/>
believes that harm will come from keeping silent is evil.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I do too and have been in trouble more than once in this lifetime, starting <br/>
at a young age, for saying &quot;That&#39;s not right&quot; to people who were my social <br/>
superiors.<br/>
<br/>
-=-A stand that forces others to bend their individual will to<br/>
others point of view against their individual experience would have the<br/>
potential for great evil. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The only times I&#39;ve had that power were when I was teaching 12-15 year olds <br/>
in a public school, and when I became a parent.  I think perhaps my many <br/>
years of being in the decision making seat with great evil on one side and <br/>
what I saw as my duty on the other have made me arrogant.<br/>
<br/>
SO... mathematicians and programmers here, please:   What are our number of <br/>
options here?  Let me not suggest a model that&#39;s as pig-ignorant as &quot;either <br/>
evolution or six day creation.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How many combinations of factors are we considering, just in a simple summary <br/>
of current options?  I&#39;m not a logician and I might have duplicates, and <br/>
they&#39;re not probably arranged perfectly.  <br/>
<br/>
born in sin / innocent<br/>
<br/>
spanking / no spanking<br/>
<br/>
inbred intelligence / empty vessel<br/>
<br/>
attachment parenting / techno parenting by the clock<br/>
<br/>
adversary / partner<br/>
<br/>
breastfeeding or attempted / unconcerned with even trying<br/>
<br/>
daycare / no daycare<br/>
<br/>
preschool / no preschool<br/>
<br/>
school / homeschool<br/>
<br/>
curriculum / no curriculum<br/>
<br/>
teaching / natural learning<br/>
<br/>
rules / principles<br/>
<br/>
more control / less control<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a bad set of criteria because there are some (many?) which will <br/>
exclude or prevent others.  Maybe that&#39;s just the way multiple sets of <br/>
criteria go.<br/>
<br/>
===============<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&quot;I believe and so must you unthinkingly,&quot; is different from &quot;I believe this<br/>
and I want you to think about it too.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I never even did that when I was teaching.<br/>
Maybe I haven&#39;t been so close to evil as my conscience sometimes thinks I <br/>
have.<br/>

<br/>
superior <br/>
&gt; to other children.<br/>
<br/>
Some of this is a bit unclear to me. Do you mean &quot;those&quot; kids, not &quot;my&quot; kids? <br/>
<br/>
In general I don&#39;t spend a lot of time worrying if my perceptions of children<br/>
being happier or not due to how they are raised is &quot;wrong&quot; or not. Maybe it is<br/>
because I went through the foster care system as a child and got to see<br/>
&quot;better&quot; or &quot;worse&quot; close up without adult blinders on, so I trust my<br/>
perceptions. And yes, I do think &quot;Pride can goeth before a fall&quot; ;) but false<br/>
humility is vanity too. Choices always cost something. Could one be wrong?<br/>
Maybe all across the board some of one&#39;s own assumptions based on one&#39;s own<br/>
circumstances won&#39;t fit every family. Is one wrong to focus on the needs of<br/>
the children before the needs of the parents? Unequivocally not. The<br/>
overwhelming evidence of current and past research, that not hidden by the<br/>
bias to always protect the adult, is that children have needs that if not met<br/>
at the developmentally appropriate times will be harmed in some way. Is is<br/>
painful to admit that one&#39;s own parents probably caused a bit of that on one&#39;s<br/>
own head? Sure it is. Is it painful as a parent to know that mistakes of your<br/>
own could also cause permanent damage to one&#39;s children? Yes, it is. As<br/>
parents should our feelings be protected so we can hide our guilt or<br/>
complicity in helping to cause our children pain? I don&#39;t think so, but, the<br/>
majority of parents do just that for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If children&#39;s very brains and emotions and sanity are threatened by early<br/>
obedience training that uses harsh methods of coercion and humiliation and<br/>
physical punishment then why wouldn&#39;t children who are NOT subjected to these<br/>
stresses NOT do better?<br/>
<br/>
I spent a great deal of time when very young under the care of my 11 year<br/>
older sister. Seeing her this summer while she was babysitting two of my<br/>
nephews, ages 6 and 7, was very amazing for me. It is one thing to know in<br/>
your heart that your needs as a child for respect and kindness were not met,<br/>
and a whole other thing to see the same person who was the vehicle for that<br/>
behavior treat other children, thirty years later, much as she must have<br/>
treated me. To see that, and KNOW that her model for behavior was my mom and<br/>
my dad, and to know how little respect or kindness she herself must have<br/>
received in her turn. It is because I can see working models like this of poor<br/>
parenting go on and on through the generations that I have no doubt that<br/>
working to stop the cycles are so important. Is that arrogant? For me to think<br/>
I know better than the family of my birth? If it is, I am all for it because<br/>
SOMEONE HAS TO STOP THIS INSANITY and this terrible waste of human potential.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, this is a bit of a ramble and I didn&#39;t even get to your other points...<br/>

My prime example (in my head) for this is Diet Coke commercials.  If, in a <br/>
Diet Coke commercial, they have a model diving into a pool, she&#39;s 5&#39;10&quot; and <br/>
weighs 115 lbs, and then they show a can of Diet Coke, there is an <br/>
implication.  The woman might be the sort of happy freak who can eat pizza <br/>
daily and never gain weight.   <br/>
<br/>
If I show my particular children, and say &quot;I&#39;m unschooling, and look at these <br/>
products,&quot; I might be as much as liar as Diet Coke&#39;s advertising team.<br/>
<br/>
What is the possibility that my children are just smart because I&#39;m smart?  <br/>
That Holly likes words because *I* like words?  That if I had died at her <br/>
birth and she had been adopted by hang-sailing gardeners who didn&#39;t own <br/>
dictionaries, that she would have still liked the histories and spellings and <br/>
sounds and subtleties of words?<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps that coke model was never humiliated or beaten, never bulemic, never <br/>

<br/>
When I was 19 and 20 I saw my mother spank my new brother in his crib, for <br/>
crying when he was wet or hungry.   A couple of years ago I was talking with <br/>
my dad&#39;s second brother, Rex, in Minnesota.  He and his first wife were <br/>
living with my dad and mom in a TINY tiny trailer when I was born.  The men <br/>
were working on a power plant in South Carolina.  I had always known that, <br/>
but Uncle Rex had never said a word to me about it that wasn&#39;t smiley and <br/>
cute and &quot;I remember when you were This Little!&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
We were talking about parenting, and he was seeing my children all around him <br/>
(they were 8, 11 and 13, more or less).  He looked at me in a direct and <br/>
adult way and said with some import (not his normal chit chatty voice or <br/>
face) that when I was born, my mom seemed to have no idea how to take care of <br/>
me.  She seemed totally helpless and overwhelmed.  And he looked at me some <br/>
more.  I didn&#39;t ask questions.   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still alive, but not in great health.  I wonder if I should call and ask <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

is valuable.<br/>

<br/>
Yeah!  I want to jump on the &quot;rambling is good&quot; bandwagon.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we edit our thoughts as we revise our writing we run the<br/>
words through the filters of acceptability and normalcy.  And that ain&#39;t<br/>
no way to rock the foundations of the world.  We have to be able to say<br/>

<br/>
And really, the model I was thinking of was the breastfed/not breastfed as<br/>
breastfed being normal, not better, and those who do not get human milk having<br/>
some nutritional deficiencies. <br/>
<br/>
So, why wouldn&#39;t babies who get the closeness, food, emotional comfort and<br/>
lack of stress (beatings, harshness, alienation from harsh or detached methods<br/>
of early baby care) that are best for human babies, develop to their optimal<br/>
potential? Why would babies who didn&#39;t get this, if this is what it takes and<br/>
increasing scientific research is supporting this, be optimal?<br/>
<br/>
Part of me, a premature baby who spent the first two months of her life in the<br/>
hospital allergic to every food they gave, wants to scream NOOOOOOOO I am OK,<br/>
I am the BEST I can be, I did get what I needed to develop optimally. But<br/>
chances are I probably didn&#39;t.<br/>

and they feel a need to share things that have bothered them for years.  The<br/>
blinders come off and they don&#39;t have the energy to keep putting them up<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to fathom isn&#39;t it? I have a sister. I never stop searching for what<br/>
happened to her. I know it did; she is the smoking gun. I know my parents were<br/>
responsible for it. She&#39;s done terrible, awful things to the rest of us. But,<br/>
I know that somehow she was born innocent and became a poison container for<br/>
someone else&#39;s pain so young that she was maimed for life. Maybe I feel<br/>
survivor&#39;s guilt? Why did it happen to her? It is still, even with all that I<br/>
know now, easier to blame her than it is to blame my dead parents. That&#39;s how<br/>
deeply we idealize those who hold our very lives in their hands.<br/>

<br/>
I discovered the home education alternative after I had dutifully sent two<br/>
of my children off to school.  I suspect  if I had left Emma there any love<br/>
of words she had  trained or inherited) would have been killed.  Every child<br/>
is born as a different person but I have come to believe letting them become<br/>
that person requires the a particular environment and for most school is not<br/>
it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a generalization, I believe heredity is pretty important.  I don&#39;t<br/>
believe that every parent who applied your methods to their kids would<br/>
necessarily get the same outcome.  While I think that your mothering has<br/>
helped your children be wonderful, I also suspect that they have some<br/>
inherent wonderfulness in them.  I&#39;m theorizing that you might have had<br/>
better raw material, through luck of the draw plus parental genetic<br/>
contribution than some other mom who&#39;s kid is bull-headed or rockets<br/>
around the house like a squirrel.  <br/>
<br/>
But I truly am *guessing* with little real data.  As the mom who&#39;s lived<br/>
every minute with your kids, *you&#39;re the one* that has the insight.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know your kids, except for meeting Holly briefly at the<br/>
conference.  So, just from interactions in this forum, I can&#39;t really<br/>
know if as toddlers they were bouncing off the walls and swinging from<br/>
the chandeliers &lt;g&gt; but have since been grown wise and been tamed<br/>
through lovingkindness.<br/>
<br/>
In real life I&#39;ve met some very thoughtful attachment parenting moms<br/>
through LLL whose kids were a lot more challenging than mine, and I<br/>
don&#39;t attribute it to the mom&#39;s parenting style.  But I&#39;ve been keeping<br/>
a narrow social circle of mostly this type of mom.  I keep my distance<br/>
from extremely conventional moms and choose not to know any drunken<br/>
moms.  (OK, I do stay home a *lot*.)  So this helps me give the moms<br/>
credit and believe that most of the moms that I know are doing a fine<br/>
job with their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line from my life is -- yes my son is sweet and agreeable because<br/>
he lives a life full of sweetness and knows that I am on his side.  But<br/>
my husband is sweet and agreeable and accomodating and was raised in a<br/>
strict, conventional 1950s family with a perfectionist mother.  So I&#39;ve<br/>
gotta figure that there&#39;s a personality trait that my husband had, that<br/>
his father reportedly had that my son is blessed with.  I don&#39;t believe<br/>
I can take all the credit for the fact that my son is outstandingly<br/>
reasonable at the age of 8.  For goodness sake, he&#39;s far more reasonable<br/>
