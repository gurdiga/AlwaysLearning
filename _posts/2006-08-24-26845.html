<div id="ygrps-yiv-897607835">Hello, group.<br/>
<br/>
My name is Christine. I am the SAHM of 2 bright and beautiful girls. <br/>
We have decided to teach them at home. We just aren&#39;t completely sure <br/>
of which method we want to use. We are looking into many.<br/>
My daughter is about to enter &quot;2nd grade&quot; and I am just now starting <br/>
this with her (though IMO I have been teaching her all along).<br/>
I am so nervous about making sure she is getting what she needs and <br/>
knowing I can provide that. I am also looking for idea&#39;s on the how to <br/>
deal with her resistance to learning. She is very happy about <br/>
homeschooling (for lack of a better term) but I think she assumes it&#39;s <br/>
just going to be sitting on the couch watching t.v.<br/>
She says she knows it&#39;s work and wants to do this but when I sat her <br/>
down with some testing so I could see for myself where she is, well <br/>
she was fidgity and not as cooperative as I would have liked.<br/>
I was already thinking about backing out but I quickly came to and <br/>
said to myself, It&#39;s not all going to be easy for her and that means <br/>
it wont be for me either. Anyway, thanks for listening.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It *can* be easy for her and for you with unschooling. Learning isn&#39;t  <br/>
hard. But trying to memorize information out of context is very hard.  <br/>
Fortunately they aren&#39;t the same! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a (not so) quick ;-) example. My daughter and I have been  <br/>
listening to a Japanese language learning tape. It&#39;s pretty similar  <br/>
to learning in school: memorization, repetition without real  <br/>
understanding. The hope is that understanding will come with  <br/>
repetition. The very first lesson introduces the words for  <br/>
&quot;I&quot; (watashi) and &quot;understand&quot; (wakari). We&#39;re up to the 3rd lesson  <br/>
and I *still* get the words confused. Anyone learning that language  <br/>
naturally (as your daughter learned English) wouldn&#39;t make that  <br/>
mistake. In natural conversation I/watashi and understand/wakari  <br/>
would pick up the feelings of the contexts they are heard in. We also  <br/>
learned the phrases for &quot;Good morning&quot; and &quot;Good afternoon&quot;. They&#39;re  <br/>
both learned in the same context: hearing the sounds from a tape in  <br/>
the car so the only difference is the sounds of the words and you  <br/>
have to force your mind to think morning when you hear &quot;ohayo&quot; and  <br/>
afternoon when you hear &quot;konnichiwa&quot;. BUT if you&#39;re learning language  <br/>
naturally, they won&#39;t be heard in the same context and someone won&#39;t  <br/>
have the problem of confusion (or not for long). Hearing it used in  <br/>
Japan for real naturally you&#39;ll get a *feeling* of &quot;morning&quot; with  <br/>
&quot;ohayo&quot; because you&#39;ll only hear it in the morning, doing morning  <br/>
things. And &quot;konnichiwa&quot; will take on a feeling of afternoon for the  <br/>
same reason. (My daughter and I have an advantage of having hosted a  <br/>
few Japanese school girls and &quot;ohayo&quot; has absorbed mornings of the  <br/>
girls being dropped off for camp and all greeting each other with  <br/>
&quot;Ohayo!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
Getting to easy, though, takes a huge shift in how you see learning  <br/>
and how you see your children.<br/>

It shouldn&#39;t be easy for you, but it CAN be fun and easy for her, and  <br/>
once you get the flow of it, if you decide to go with unschooling, it  <br/>
will be fun and easy for both of you.<br/>
<br/>
If you go with school at home, lessons, teaching, tests, it will be  <br/>
difficult for her, difficult for you, it will probably cost you your  <br/>
relationship with her, and within a few years you&#39;ll give up and put  <br/>
her back in school.<br/>

unschooling in the first place.  Here&#39;s a collection of people&#39;s  <br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re looking at your daughter&#39;s world through school-colored  <br/>
glasses.  Testing wasn&#39;t educational for her OR you except that you  <br/>
learned you didn&#39;t like something about her.  Her lack of cooperation  <br/>
and her fidgitiness.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a situation in which you judged her, mostly by someone else&#39;s  <br/>
standards, and she failed.  You would have liked it to have been  <br/>
different.  You saw her as lacking.<br/>
<br/>
The same kinds of damage school can do can be done at home.  If you  <br/>
don&#39;t want to bring school home, you don&#39;t have to.  If you DO want  <br/>
to bring school home, this list won&#39;t be a good fit for you at all.<br/>

<br/>
I say homeschooling when I&#39;m talking to people who aren&#39;t homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m talking to homeschoolers, I say unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a matter of perspective.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in Ontario and someone asks me where I live, I say &quot;New Mexico.&quot;<br/>
If I were to say &quot;between Raley&#39;s and Hollywood Video, east of Juan  <br/>
Tabo&quot; that would be nonsense to them, and rude for me to say.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m in Albuquerque and someone asks me where I live, if I were to  <br/>
say &quot;New Mexico&quot; that would be like saying &quot;None of your business.&quot;   <br/>
Worse yet, if I were to say &quot;The U.S.&quot; or &quot;Earth.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m talking to someone who also lives between Raley&#39;s and  <br/>
Hollywood Video, I say &quot;Second house from the left in the cul-de- <br/>
sac.  The vacant lot is out our back gate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To the state of New Mexico, I&#39;m homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
To people whose kids are in school when I&#39;m not, I&#39;m homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is a broad class.<br/>
<br/>
Within homeschooling there&#39;s school at home, unit studies, eclectic,  <br/>
Charlotte Mason... lots of particular  plans, and there&#39;s unschooling  <br/>
which is ALSO a particular plan, only you can&#39;t buy it.  You  <br/>
assimilate the knowledge yourself and use it in your family.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/nest">http://sandradodd.com/nest</a><br/>

It&#39;s not just doing nothing.  It&#39;s doing something very broad and deep.<br/>

<br/>
You won&#39;t make much progress in 1 hour, but please do look into it.<br/>
<br/>
There are curriculum salesmen who could sell you a year&#39;s worth of  <br/>
&quot;homeschool&quot; in two minutes.  They want your money.  They don&#39;t care  <br/>
if it&#39;s  a good fit for your daughter or for you.<br/>
<br/>
People at this list and the others linked at the help link I sent  <br/>
don&#39;t have anything to sell you.  They&#39;re willing to help you figure  <br/>
out what&#39;s so wonderful about unschooling, but it can&#39;t happen in two  <br/>
minutes or an hour or a month.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling would l be cheaper, it would be better for your daughter,  <br/>
and it would bring fun into your home, but it IS work for the mom to  <br/>
learn about learning instead of just mimicking what she thinks she  <br/>
remembers her teachers having done with her.<br/>
<br/>
If school works, send your daughter to school!  If school doesn&#39;t  <br/>
work, don&#39;t build a school at your house.  If you do, she will NEVER  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-736544428">I&#39;m very closed minded when it comes to &quot;any and all ways of home <br/>
learning.&quot;  Being open to &quot;any and all ways&quot; in my life would mean <br/>
abandoning my belief in my children to hold true to tests and scheduling <br/>
that other people believe are valuable. What you are doing, from your <br/>
previous message, is homeschooling. I don&#39;t think you should abandon the <br/>
term before you abandon the practice. Unschooling, although a subset of <br/>
homeschooling, is not schooling at home; it is not testing your child to <br/>
find out where she is so that you can address her areas of academic <br/>
weakness. Unschooling is about exploring the world with your child. At <br/>
its core, in my life, unschooling is more about my relationship with my <br/>
children than it is about their potential academic achievement.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce says it better than I could at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html:">http://home.earthlink.net/~fetteroll/rejoycing/unschooling/unschoolingphilosophy.html:</a> <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            &quot;The goals of unschooling are different than all the other<br/>
            methods you mention. The goal of unschooling is not<br/>
            education. It is to help a child be who she is and blossom<br/>
            into who she will become. Education happens as a side effect.<br/>
<br/>
            Just as people plant vegetable gardens to raise vegetables.<br/>
            Along the way pollinators come and it&#39;s even a vital part of<br/>
            the process, but the purpose of planting the garden isn&#39;t to<br/>
            attract pollinators.<br/>
<br/>
            The purpose of the other homeschooling methods is to give to<br/>
            the child something that appeals to the parents. In a way<br/>
            formal educational methods are like those cool educational<br/>
            toys that parents want to give their kids for their<br/>
            birthday. What you&#39;re buying with a curriculum is an image<br/>
            of what you want your child to be. The image may be as<br/>
            simple as being prepared to be whatever they want to be. And<br/>
            yet it is still like picturing your child playing with the<br/>
            super deluxe Erector set you&#39;re planning to give them. But<br/>
            what if the child has no interest in Erector sets? What if<br/>
            what the child really wants is a Nintendo system?<br/>
<br/>
            I think many parents see education as a gift they can give<br/>
            their children. But what if the recipient doesn&#39;t want the<br/>
            gift? If the purpose of giving a gift is to satisfy some<br/>
            need in the giver for the recipient to have the gift, is it<br/>
            really a gift? If the gift giver has emotional stake in the<br/>
            recipient appreciating the gift and the effort involved in<br/>
            providing the gift, is it really a gift?<br/>
<br/>
            I think it would be helpful for parents choosing formal<br/>
            education to see it honestly. Despite the pictures of happy<br/>
            children using the various formal curriculums, it&#39;s not<br/>
            about giving a gift. It&#39;s about meeting parents&#39; needs. It&#39;s<br/>
            about molding and shaping a fellow human being against their<br/>
            will into something we want them to be.<br/>
<br/>
            That sounds harsh, but if it weren&#39;t against their will,<br/>
            then the children would choose to do it on their own. If it<br/>
            weren&#39;t against their will, there would never be instances<br/>
            where the parent is coercing the child to do something for<br/>
            the curriculum that the child doesn&#39;t want to do. There<br/>
            would never be instances where the child can&#39;t say &quot;I don&#39;t<br/>
            want to finish that.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
            Unschooling is about giving them the freedom to be who they<br/>
            are. Formal education is about molding them into something<br/>
            we think is valuable to be.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before you decide to unschool you should really and truly examine why <br/>
you want to homeschool. If it is to achieve some educational goal, to <br/>
achieve some level at college entrance exams, for example, while <br/>
unschooling is as viable a method as any other for attaining that, it <br/>
isn&#39;t as focused as that. If it is because you believe that school <br/>
itself will drain the imagination and joy out of all things learning, <br/>
than you may want to rethink whether or not school at home won&#39;t do the <br/>
same damage. If you set yourself up as an antagonist in your <br/>
relationship with your daughter it will always be hard for you. If, <br/>
instead, you reach out to her, come to where she is and where she wants <br/>
to be, even if that means sitting with her on the couch while she <br/>
watches all the television she wants to, than you will be building a <br/>
relationship that will go from strength to strength. And you will learn <br/>
so much as you go it will astound you.<br/>

learning...which involves a lot of FUN. Learning should be fun.<br/>
<br/>
And if you read around and decide to keep learning more about<br/>
unschooling, please feel free to check out the Unschooling Basics<br/>
email list...just for newbies.:)<br/>
<br/>
This list is geared for those already committed to unschooling, so you<br/>
might feel a bit overwhelmed at first. Read here and simply absorb,<br/>
but just know that there are lists geared for the beginner too.<br/>

For my benefit, and possibly also for the new to homeschooling mom&#39;s  <br/>
benefit, could you please expand on your comment about the &quot;work&quot;  <br/>
that an unschooling mom will do in learning about learning?<br/>
<br/>
I feel like this could be a beginner&#39;s question, but being a few  <br/>
years into it, that it can also be relevant to the moms who are  <br/>
somewhere mid-course.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Unschooling would l be cheaper, it would be better for your daughter,<br/>
&gt; and it would bring fun into your home, but it IS work for the mom to<br/>
&gt; learn about learning instead of just mimicking what she thinks she<br/>
&gt; remembers her teachers having done with her.<br/>

<br/>
When people start unschooling, it&#39;s often very tentatively.  After a  <br/>
while, instead of telling stories of what they&#39;ve heard other people  <br/>
did, they have stories of what their own kids have done, learned,  <br/>
seen, known.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one kind of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people start unschooling and they&#39;re doing more chattering  <br/>
than looking, and more asserting than questioning (not chattery  <br/>
questioning, but soul questioning).  It&#39;s not as good a beginning,  <br/>
and at some point they do start really observing their children, and  <br/>
really thinking about the why and what of learning.<br/>
<br/>
But any time a mom thinks there&#39;s nothing to know, I don&#39;t think she  <br/>
knows nearly enough.<br/>
When a mom thinks unschooling is doing nothing, she&#39;s not doing  <br/>
nearly enough.<br/>
If a mom thinks unschooling will take none of her time, she needs to  <br/>
spend a LOT of her time (more than those who knew it would be a life  <br/>
change) figuring out how to spend timebe with her child and what she  <br/>
can do, even when her child&#39;s not there, to help unschooling work  <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
I cringe when I hear/read/see a mom thinking unschooling will take  <br/>
less effort and cost less than having children in public school.    <br/>
Anyone unschooling to save time and money is going the wrong  <br/>
direction.  It might cost less in absolutely-required expenditure  <br/>
compared to buying a curriculum or paying private school tuition, and  <br/>
most unschoolers I know are content with plain or used or funky  <br/>
clothes (compared to school uniforms or required fashions and name  <br/>
brand things that might get stolen or lost at school).  But if  <br/>
parents don&#39;t want to spend ANY money on games, toys, museums, out-of- <br/>
town trips, books, whatever it is the kids might be interested in,  <br/>
then I think that&#39;s not the best the parents could do as unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a basis, a foundation, on which confident, workable  <br/>
unschooling is built, and most of it involves confidence, and  <br/>
confidence can&#39;t come without examination of one&#39;s purpose,  <br/>
priorities and principles.  It takes a while to figure those things  <br/>
out, and while they can be figured out at the same time unschooling  <br/>
is unfolding, and will probably continue to evolve  (maybe even after  <br/>
the kids are grown), it&#39;s not &quot;nothing&quot; to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Once someone was asking how many hours she should spend with her  <br/>
child, or something, and  I said at least as many hours as she  <br/>
would&#39;ve been in school, counting transportation, and there seemed to  <br/>
be some shock and surprise in the audience.  So that made me want to  <br/>
say (I didn&#39;t, but should&#39;ve) TWICE as much time as she would&#39;ve  <br/>
spent in school.   Because honestly, a child shouldn&#39;t lose the mom- <br/>
time she would&#39;ve had at night and on weekends, should she?<br/>
<br/>
The shock probably came from someone who thought those hours would be  <br/>
teacher-style hours, of being stuck in one place doing something not  <br/>
too fun.  That vision can only come from someone who hasn&#39;t looked  <br/>
into unschooling enough to know that the best unschooling hours  are  <br/>
fun, natural, real activities.   They needed to learn more about  <br/>
learning.<br/>
