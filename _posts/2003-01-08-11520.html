<div id="ygrps-yiv-39480230"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Six years old is really young!  So is seven.  So is<br/>
&gt;eight.  Since you say he runs from anything that<br/>
&gt;looks like school work, just follow his lead.  <br/>
&gt;And please don&#39;t worry and don&#39;t watch the &gt;calendar.<br/>
 </span></blockquote> He&#39;ll emerge as a whole person if you &gt;allow him to,<br/>
but he&#39;ll may pick up on your &gt;worrying, and that can<br/>
affect him, too.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Marji<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree with Marji...6 is really young.  I have a six<br/>
year old son, Thomas.  If he could dissect sentences I<br/>
would be astounded.  His 4 year old brother, Alex is<br/>
on the cusp of pre-reading, sounding out letters,<br/>
identifying letters in words by sound (in his head,<br/>
not looking at words) practicing drawing letters, and<br/>
in general playing with letters.  He loves letter<br/>
magnets and a new spelling toy he got for Christmas.  <br/>
<br/>
Thomas just isn&#39;t that interested in letters, spelling<br/>
or reading yet.  I&#39;m not worried about it.  I taught<br/>
myself to read at 4, but my older brother didn&#39;t read<br/>
until 9.  Neither one of us learned from the stupid<br/>
public institution we were in, despite their best<br/>
efforts to force him.  Make reading material readily<br/>
available to your son, as I am sure you do, and get<br/>
him books and magazines about subjects that he&#39;s<br/>
passionate about, and it will come.  Try not to worry.<br/>
 He&#39;s still really young.<br/>
