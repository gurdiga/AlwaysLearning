<div id="ygrps-yiv-557643589">Flustered moms of very young children can just pass this by, no  <br/>
problem.  Those with time on their hands and an interest in history  <br/>
or philosophy might want to look.<br/>

<br/>
This can be applied to thoughts of unschooling and who can and should  <br/>
do it and how fair and right the outcome should be, and guarantees of  <br/>
any sort.<br/>
<br/>
It could also be considered off topic, or offsides, and while at the  <br/>
edges it&#39;s too political for my regular tastes, in the middle of this  <br/>
article is some really great history of the western civilizations  <br/>
ideas about how and whether the world is fair.<br/>
<br/>
I found the link by visiting the history blog of a friend of mine,  <br/>
Steve Muhlberger, whose blog is linked at<br/>

someday, but is here:<br/>

The story of how and why I came across this and why I was excited  <br/>
would be longer than the article, so let it be part of your own  <br/>
tapestry of connections, or not; either&#39;s fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719656833">I&#39;ve never really liked either of those comparisons of the world view.  <br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t the idea of a &quot;just world&quot; a bit like trying to create natural <br/>
consequences arbitrarily?  The &quot;wheel of fortune&quot; attempts to tip the <br/>
balance, by saying bad and good things happen, but not necessarily <br/>
because one is bad or good.<br/>
<br/>
Life seems to be more a little of both.  But maybe it&#39;s that way <br/>
because enough people believe it to be.  It&#39;s not all up to chance or <br/>
will and intent.<br/>
<br/>
However, the idea of settling with a duel would make life a bit more <br/>
interesting, especially if you could carry around big swords.</div>

I&#39;ve never tried to like one or the other.  It does help me to know  <br/>
there are people who have in the past, and still, acted on them as  <br/>
immutable truths.<br/>
<br/>
Bad and good things do happen, and not necessarily because one is bad  <br/>
or good.  How can that be doubted?   On top of that, though, there  <br/>
are things we can affect.<br/>
<br/>
When a baby is born, he&#39;s strong or not, whole or not, and assuming  <br/>
he gets nourishment and isn&#39;t damaged, will develop talents in  <br/>
various ways or not.  Some parents love to think a strong, bright  <br/>
baby is because they were good (one way or another).<br/>
<br/>
The Buddhist idea of non-attachment has come up a couple of time in  <br/>
my life this week.  I would&#39;ve been better off if I hadn&#39;t visualized  <br/>
some things the way I wanted them to be and then gotten excited about  <br/>
and invested in those visions.  Yet there are people who advise *JUST  <br/>
THAT*:  visualize and plan on something you don&#39;t have, and if you  <br/>
believe it and want it it will happen.<br/>
<br/>
People give them money to say that.  And for everyone who has  <br/>
&quot;success,&quot; the speakers are justified.  And for each person who  <br/>
doesn&#39;t, it&#39;s their fault.<br/>
<br/>
That can&#39;t be true.  Not everyone can be an Olympic medalist or a  <br/>
lottery winner.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I think people want unschooling to be like that.  They read  <br/>
and they imagine and they dream, but they&#39;re not with their kids  <br/>
*doing.*<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I just had a conversation about this with someone today, about how <br/>
many parents attatch themselves to their children&#39;s successes and <br/>
failures and feel somehow that it is a reflection of them as the <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
I love to effect positive things onto my kids!  I love love love it <br/>
when I do something for or with my kids that they love.  It feels <br/>
wonderful to be able to have that kind of effect on them.  However, I <br/>
don&#39;t do it for that reason, I do it to enrich their world, and I <br/>
just get blessed in the process.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds a bit like school actually and we do pay a lot of money for <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve done that though, the whole visualization/make it happen thing, <br/>
and I&#39;ve found that it works in its own beautiful way.  Perhaps it <br/>
can be chalked up to focusing on it so much that your life starts to <br/>
move in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it&#39;s that when focusing on positive outcomes, you attract <br/>
positives into your life.  I&#39;ve experienced that to.  I think it&#39;s an <br/>
interesting concept to play with ones destiny, in a way, or the <br/>
concept of one having a destiny, or not, to begin with is fascinating <br/>
all on its own.</div>
