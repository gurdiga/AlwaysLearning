<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659074894">Wow.  I went to look at photos and there are several new ones.  People have <br/>
swimming pools!  Beaches!  Beautiful art, interesting houses, bright-eyed <br/>
kids, this is great!<br/>
<br/>
And Ren has a good-looking husband! <br/>

Some of you look really young.  I personally am Very Old, but having a ten <br/>
