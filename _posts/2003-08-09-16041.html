<div id="ygrps-yiv-1100279224">Did you know you were mentioned in some congressional hearing by Sanchez <br/>
at some point?<br/>
<br/>
Brad was telling me about it.  I guess someone that gave him a <br/>
declaration had a copy of the transcript...<br/>
<br/>
btw, I didn&#39;t tell you this, but he won his court battle today.  (this <br/>
is a friend of mine who is in the middle of a court battle over custody <br/>
issues re: his 5 year old son for those of you who don&#39;t know).  He will <br/>
announce tomorrow on HSC but the judge gave him full control over <br/>
Pierre&#39;s education (his wife had obtained an emergency order for Pierre <br/>
to go to school, Kindergarten which isn&#39;t even manditory here in <br/>
california.)  He was just beaming when he picked up Pierre (we had him <br/>
this afternoon while Brad was in court, the poor kid is so stressed, he <br/>
had three accidents while dad was gone. so sad.)  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow - yeah - it was pretty cool what she said about homeschooling and <br/>
about my kids &lt;G&gt;. She never met them or spoke to us - just one of her <br/>
aides did. She gave a speech supporting homeschooling and included us <br/>
in her speech.<br/>
<br/>
(Loretta Sanchez is congressperson from our area - she has a sister who <br/>
is also in Congress - which I think is the first-ever sister-pair of <br/>
congresspeople.)<br/>
