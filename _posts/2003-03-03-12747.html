&lt;&lt; One can&#39;t help but wonder how this guy teaches his own children these <br/>
 &quot;important lessons&quot;, makes them stand in a circle while he throws balls <br/>
 at them hard?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That was really, really yucky.<br/>
I just don&#39;t understand how people come to the conclusion that kids will deal <br/>
with lifes difficulties better by being bullied and put down. Yuck.<br/>
Dodge ball in school was a nightmare. How well I remember being chosen last, <br/>
probably the biggest scar to my self esteem. And then the bigger, stronger <br/>
kids deciding to take out their awful life frustration on YOU and peg you so <br/>
hard with the ball that you felt like crying. But heaven forbid you should <br/>
show any weakness and fuel the fire. <br/>
Oh yuck, yuck, yuck.....this guy really pissed me off.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
