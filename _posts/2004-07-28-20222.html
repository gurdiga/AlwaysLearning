Anyone watching the convention?<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
I watched a bit of it -- some of Hillary&#39;s intro and Bill Clinton&#39;s speech.  <br/>
What I can&#39;t get over in all the recent coverage is the Republicans saying <br/>
that this is the most liberal ticket in Democrat history.  Okay, and is that <br/>
supposed to be a bad thing?<br/>
************************<br/>
We had the coolest day. I live north of Boston (Salem), and today I took <br/>
Julian and his friend Nick, who attends a Sudbury Valley School, to an event <br/>
related to the DNC.<br/>
<br/>
We got to see and hear Howard Dean, Robert Reich, presidents and Executive <br/>
Directors of the Sierra Club, the AFL-CIO, and the NEA and Michael Moore.<br/>
<br/>
Whatever your political beliefs, it was cool that we got to do this.<br/>
