 </span></blockquote>13 Ways to Raise a Nonreader<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1). Never read where your children can see you.<br/>
<br/>
2). Put a TV or computer in every room. Dont neglect the bedrooms and<br/>
kitchen.<br/>
<br/>
3). Correct your child every time she mispronounces a word.<br/>
<br/>
4). Schedule activities everyday after school so your child will never<br/>
be bored.<br/>
<br/>
5). Once your child can read independently, throw out the picture books.<br/>
Theyre for babies.<br/>
<br/>
6). Dont play board games together. Too dull.<br/>
<br/>
7). Give little rewards for reading. Stickers and plastic toys are nice.<br/>
Money is even better.<br/>
<br/>
8). Dont expect your children to enjoy reading. Kids books are for<br/>
teaching vocabulary, proper study habits, and good morals.<br/>
<br/>
9). Buy only 40-watt bulbs for your lamps.<br/>
<br/>
10). Under no circumstances read your child the same book over and over.<br/>
She heard it once, she should remember it.<br/>
<br/>
11). Never allow your child to listen to books on tape; thats cheating.<br/>
<br/>
12). Make sure your kids only read books that are challenging. Easy<br/>
books are a complete waste of time. That goes double for comic books and<br/>
Mad magazine.<br/>
<br/>
13). Absolutely, positively no reading in bed.</div>

We&#39;re reading _The Miss Bianca_ books by Margery Sharp. I am so amazed<br/>
at the vocabulary. I keep having to go look things up...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-384029614">When we changed to a new optomitrist a few years ago, he said that you <br/>
shouldn&#39;t read for at least 20 minutes before going to bed, because when <br/>
you read, or watch tv or use the computer or any other fixed distance <br/>
eye activity, your eye muscles &#39;stick&#39; at that distance for a while and <br/>
then when you go to sleep straight after, they stay &#39;stuck&#39; all night. <br/>
(In the &#39;natural&#39; way of living, our eyes would be constantly changing <br/>
focus from close to mid range to far distance) And that this is one of <br/>
the reasons for short sightedness in our western cultures.<br/>
<br/>
Neither my son, nor I have chosen to change our computer or reading <br/>
habits. Nor, I suspect has the optomitrist, who is short sighted himself &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Casey loves to go to the library. She picks out her own books and comes home <br/>
with interesting and diverse selections. The funny thing is, we almost never <br/>
read them these days. She prefers to have us reread old favorites again and <br/>
again. It seems it&#39;s just the library experience she&#39;s craving right now.<br/>

But I also love reading in bed and working on the computer for hours.  <br/>

But there are people who can&#39;t read at all and who don&#39;t have lights at night <br/>
and they get short sighted too.<br/>

instead of with a book, at bedtime, does this guy have an opinion about<br/>
whether my eyes should be open or shut?   &lt;ggg&gt;<br/>

It just strikes me funny.<br/>
