<div id="ygrps-yiv-149939093">Hi, Pam and whoever else had asked about a typical day recently,<br/>
<br/>
Pam, leave your hair in your head, unschooling works just fine.  You already<br/>
know a lot about it, unless you&#39;re like my mother who thought that every<br/>
minute needed to be educational.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know how to go on vacation?  Do you like going to the zoo, a muesum<br/>
or two, or outside for a hike?  How about lazy Saturdays at home with<br/>
nothing on the agenda except to relax?  If you can do these things, guess<br/>
what -- this is your new life!  This IS unschooling, if you do it all day,<br/>
every day.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry that your son is not so happy these days.  It will probably take<br/>
him some time to get used to the new freedom to do what he wants to do;<br/>
that&#39;s called deschooling.  He may watch lots of TV or play computer games<br/>
all day.  Smile, watch with him, have him show you how far he&#39;s gotten on<br/>
the games, bake cookies, and feed him periodically.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, he&#39;s either going to get interested in something other than the<br/>
TV and computer games, or he&#39;ll take them to a whole new level and spend all<br/>
his time trying to figure out how to beat the system.  Either of those<br/>
things will be educational.  I don&#39;t have a little gamer, but many people<br/>
have written eloquently on how much kids can learn from them, if you visit<br/>
sandradodd.com   <br/>
<br/>
Here is my day, typical or not. I have one son, six years old.  He decided<br/>
that multiplication tables were interesting and decided to create one.  He<br/>
only likes number adding, he tells me, and will never learn subtraction.  I<br/>
said ok.  Last year he didn&#39;t like numbers over 20, and now can count to<br/>
1,000 (and did so one day) so I figured this, too, shall pass.  He drew<br/>
little American flags for his teddy bears to hold, shelled fresh green peas,<br/>
played solitare and rummy, watched me make brownies, worked on the problem<br/>
steps in his tap dance routine, bounced around to music, attempted to puzzle<br/>
out why yellow-green and green-yellow colored pencils (and other colors like<br/>
that) are so different, and whined about being bored in between.  He also<br/>
informed me that he&#39;s never ever going to school because it&#39;s SO boring.  I<br/>
said ok to that, too!<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not much of a TV watcher, but yesterday he watched Lord of the Rings on<br/>
DVD again, so he also raced around fighting imaginary orcs and goblins<br/>
today.  <br/>
<br/>
I planned a week of menus, wrote a grocery list, played rummy until I<br/>
couldn&#39;t stand it any more, answered multiplication questions, worked on my<br/>
brownie recipe (it came from a friend and was so good but way too rich, so<br/>
I&#39;m adapting it), made several snacks (we never got around to a meal before<br/>
dinner) and eventually made dinner, taught a violin lesson, etc.  Some of my<br/>
things involved hiim, some didn&#39;t.  I answered the usual running list of<br/>
questions as best as I could, read email, and googled a couple things to<br/>
find answers for &quot;Curious Tim&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Guess that&#39;s a pretty typical day, the kind Tim really likes because we<br/>
didn&#39;t go anywhere.  He&#39;s very much a homebody.  Your son who dislikes<br/>
everything about school sounds like a great candidate for unschooling!  Good<br/>
luck with it!<br/>

you can always lower your standards, too.  That helps a lot!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008828584">Hello all,<br/>
I am new and learning more & more everyday; just reading your posts and online and books. I have 4 children (one in college and one in 3rd grade public)and a 12 yr.old son & 16 yr old daugher(unschooling) My son is very intersted in video games and I see alot of learning with him so I&#39;m not worried but my daughter ( whom I homeschooled K-3 then sent to public from 4-10 grades) I am concerned with. Has had depression and other struggles in the past... She is definitly deschooling...I have no idea how to help her.<br/>
She really only wants to be with friends and go out, sleep in late, watch TV, be lazy(her words) I have suggested that we all make a vision board for fun and this will help us explore our interests...she is working on this but other than that how do I encourage her to seek her intersts without pushing her? <br/>
We live in Pa and do have Homeschooling laws that we submit a portfoliop etc...in subject areas...<br/>
Thank you for any ideas or suggestions<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Vision boards&quot; aren&#39;t the best tool for unschooling in the whole, big real world.  It&#39;s like making secret wishes at home instead of actually living.  Conversations are better.  Side-by-side conversations can be the best sometimes with teens:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/truck">http://sandradodd.com/truck</a><br/>
<br/>
Try to spend time with her, just the two of you, if you can, sometimes.  <br/>

<br/>
Has she only been out of school for one year?<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s prone to depression, she&#39;s probably better off at home than around a ton of angsty teens.<br/>
<br/>
-=-how do I encourage her to seek her intersts without pushing her? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think of it as &quot;seeking her interests.&quot;<br/>
She might not have a burning interest, and she can still learn a ton.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s watching tv; does she also look at videos?  Maybe you can fill your portfolio with things she&#39;s looked up or watched or listened to.  Has she tried audio books?  &quot;The Help&quot; is particularly good (the audio book is better than the movie, and better than the book, because they do the right accents).  That could be American history/civil rights/ women&#39;s movement, and literature.  <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t expect her to provide her own interesting life.  That&#39;s your job.   If she&#39;s been out of school a full year, start looking at what she&#39;s doing.  If it has not been a year yet, don&#39;t press her in any way.<br/>
<br/>
These things might help:<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wonder how any teen who is schooled in our authoritarian, mainstream culture, and happens to be a sensitive person, can survive their teens without becoming depressed.<br/>
<br/>
I started the habit of depression in my teens and only recently feel that I&#39;m breaking out of it (at age 37).  What has helped me is an accumulation of empowered, healthy choices, and experiencing &quot;success&quot; on my own terms.  Deschooling has been the most wonderful antidote to my depression--it&#39;s still sinking in that I can create the life I want to live, and help my kids to do the same.  Nightly, I am devouring Sandra&#39;s webpages, and am finding that my daytime thoughts are more open to possibility and joy.<br/>
<br/>
I used to worry that my son would inherit my family&#39;s legacy of depression, but now I know that as long as he knows he is the agent of his own life, as long as he knows he has choices, he will not feel trapped in depression.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure this analogy has been brought up on this board before, but you know the experiments where scientists shock rats on an unpredictable basis?  After a while, they don&#39;t try to move or fight the shocks anymore, even when the cage door is open for them to escape.  They&#39;ve learned helplessness.<br/>
<br/>
Depression is a form of helplessness.  Your daughter can learn that she can create her own wonderful life on her own terms, but she may need a little help.  If your relationship is a good one, perhaps you could travel together.  Perhaps she could travel with someone else?<br/>
<br/>
What do you imagine that she would find fun, or what did she used to find fun?  Do that!<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Depression&quot; is a word that names more than one state and cause.<br/>
<br/>
If the family&#39;s legacy of depression is to live like Eeyore, to be cynical and critical and not to express any giddiness or joy (maybe because since childhood that was discouraged and extinguished, then yes--finding choices and joy can begin to undo that, and if everyone in the family is willing to go out of the cage and stop administering those shocks to each other about being out here, the whole group might get to the point that they no longer have that legacy of depression and negativity.<br/>
<br/>
If the legacy, though, is a genetic tendency away from a flatness and even-keeled personality, that&#39;s different.  Some people are never very excited, but the other side of that is that they&#39;re never very distressed or depressed. <br/>
<br/>
It does seem that a person&#39;s capacity for exuberance comes with a corresponding low.  <br/>
<br/>
Part of &quot;clinical depression&quot; can be mistaking that low for a permanent state, and assuming that the world has become dark and helpless because there used to be sparkly excitement, and now there&#39;s not.<br/>
<br/>
What used to be called manic depression and is now called &quot;bi-polar disorder&quot; is present in LOTS of people, in lesser or greater degrees, but whatever the &quot;poles&quot; are or the degree of mania and depression, they seem to be related.  It&#39;s biochemistry that people don&#39;t understand well yet.<br/>
<br/>
Even people with low lows, though, can benefit from remembering that the high highs will return.  And those who have no high high to look foward to won&#39;t get depressed about it. :-)<br/>
<br/>
My quick advice about all that, being a person with ups and down and having a couple of kids that way (and one who isn&#39;t) is to be grateful for the energetic phase and get some cool things done, and accept the lower times without wallowing (don&#39;t watch depressing movies or listen to suicide-inducing music, or watch the news).   <br/>
<br/>

That&#39;s helpful for any family, even the cheery ones, or those with the most stable of temperaments.<br/>
