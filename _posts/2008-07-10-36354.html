<div id="ygrps-yiv-1996748621">This seems to be coming up for me over and over, these days.<br/>
<br/>
I think it is because my kids are pretty much grown up and busy with  <br/>
their own stuff and I&#39;m spending more time with other adults, without  <br/>
the kids around.<br/>
<br/>
So - what&#39;s happening is that the other adults are complaining a lot  <br/>
about their own kids. They go on and on and ON about how self-centered  <br/>
and inconsiderate their kids are. They tell stories about how rude  <br/>
their kids are. Or, they tell about all the trouble their kids are  <br/>
getting into, all the problems they are having with them.<br/>
<br/>
There is a very hostile tone to all this complaining. They are angry  <br/>
at their kids for not being better, nicer, less trouble, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so very uncomfortable with this. I don&#39;t seem to know how to  <br/>
respond.<br/>
<br/>
I could hardly be happier with my kids. I adore them and I&#39;m very  <br/>
proud of them. Are they making all the &quot;perfect&quot; choices I&#39;d wish  <br/>
they&#39;d make? I guess not, if I think about it. But I most definitely  <br/>
am not going to sit there and complain about their choices. Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
And, what I could mention can&#39;t compare to the things other people are  <br/>
saying about how rotten their kids are - how shallow, how rude, how  <br/>
inconsiderate, how meanspirited, how dishonest, how untrustworthy. And  <br/>
those are the ones with the pretty good kids - there are some others  <br/>
whose kids have really gone bad - stealing, hard drugs and alcoholism,  <br/>
violence, etc.<br/>
<br/>
So weird to find it slightly embarrassing to be happy with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - my question is what you do when you get into a situation in  <br/>
which parents are sitting around badmouthing their own kids?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1708395681">Mine is only 5 and I hear tons of complaining from parents of their kids who<br/>
are around about that same age.  Sometimes I just look at the parents and<br/>
listen as openmindedly as I can (not easy for me) because many people really<br/>
aren&#39;t remembering much about being that age.  Many people also choose avoid<br/>
much memory of being a teen or young adult themselves as well.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s easier to focus on the point that they as parents are uncomfortable<br/>
right then and there.  And why wouldn&#39;t they be?  Many of them have made<br/>
some choices that are not so good.  I wouldn&#39;t point it out because they<br/>
can&#39;t change back then.  We can only act in the present.  And people who<br/>
didn&#39;t realize all that about their choices then usually do not want to<br/>
realize it now either.<br/>
<br/>
Their view is that as parents they are victims of circumstances.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s little consideration about how children or people just *are* or<br/>
about how people develop from one age to another.  They don&#39;t really<br/>
understand growth as a process, except perhaps physically and maybe a little<br/>
bit mentally and psychologically.  Their understanding hinges on fragments<br/>
of the whole process.<br/>
<br/>
In addition, I also think many people don&#39;t believe in change.  I&#39;ve heard<br/>
this a lot: &quot;People don&#39;t change.&quot;  I feel so differently.  I *have*<br/>
changed.  What they see part of is that change is not automatic.  And that<br/>
*is* true, even if that&#39;s not exactly the words they use to express the<br/>
phenomenon.<br/>
<br/>
Changing yourself and your life requires a whole different way of thinking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1375626315">**Anyway - my question is what you do when you get into a situation in which <br/>

<br/>
It depends on the circumstances. Mostly I try to just get out of those <br/>
situations. If I can&#39;t I try hard to stay quiet, because usually my saying anything <br/>
isn&#39;t really going to help. I&#39;m just not eloquent enough. Sometimes I might <br/>
mention the things I&#39;ve seen that are contrary to the negative evaluation, but <br/>
generally that just makes things worse. Very occasionally with someone I know <br/>
really well I might point out that they themselves show a LOT of the trait <br/>
they&#39;re castigating their child for (it&#39;s often a glaring truth). Once or twice <br/>
I&#39;ve mentioned that I&#39;ve found that the more I focus on how bad things are the <br/>
worse they get. Mostly I suppose I try to change the subject or go play with <br/>
the kids.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not always happy with my kids. They aren&#39;t always happy with me. But I <br/>
think hard not to put negative labels on them *especially in my own head*. <br/>
Declaring a person selfish, whiny, shallow, rude, inconsiderate, meanspirited, <br/>
dishonest, untrustworthy, etc. etc. locks them into that box, if only in my own <br/>
mind, so that ordinary human behaviours take on extraordinary negative meanings, <br/>
and perhaps temporary conditions gain weight and gravity and substance.<br/>
<br/>
I try really really hard not to go around complaining about my kids. Okay, <br/>
that sounds like I&#39;m walking around a lot *feeling* like complaining, which <br/>
isn&#39;t true at all. I mean that when I *am* for one reason or another having <br/>
conflicts with or worries about one of my kids, that I try to be especially aware of <br/>
how I talk/write about them to other people. It seems to me that it is <br/>
harmful to our relationship for me to engage in that sort of negative talk where <br/>
people seem to be looking mostly for hand patting &quot;there there&quot; and agreement <br/>
that parenting is hard and kids can be so awful (the same sort of complaining a <br/>
lot of women seem to get into about husbands, for that matter). <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard. Sometimes it seems like it&#39;s such a fine line between describing a <br/>
situation because you&#39;re asking for help in figuring it out, asking for help <br/>
to remember to breathe, laughing at your own foibles, and that negative <br/>
destructive complaining. Of course a lot of the time it&#39;s a grand canyon of a chasm.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s a really hard one for me too!  I absolutely adore my kids and<br/>
think they are completely awesome!  I trust them with all my heart! <br/>
Sometimes they do mean or hurtful things, but I try to let it go and<br/>
focus on the good things they do, so those yuck things they do on<br/>
occasion seem so insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
When I get in these conversations, I try to change the subject because<br/>
it hurts me to hear it, I hurt for those kids.  Sometimes I share what I<br/>
heard with my older daughter and we talk about it together, and that<br/>
helps because she has a unique insight to people.</div>

There are people I expect it from, they&#39;ve done it all the time I&#39;ve known <br/>
them so that I&#39;m no longer surprised and I just try to let it go on past. I hate <br/>
when it picks up steam and others pick up the ball and toss it around with <br/>
them. This has happened in a couple places recently and it&#39;s very distressing. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know. Staying silent feels very bad, speaking up feels hard and tense <br/>
and I want to do it only if I think it might actually help someone.<br/>
<br/>
And really, I know people who I&#39;m pretty sure deep down really do hate their <br/>
kids. It&#39;s the others that bother me when it gets into that hostile terrain. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-547274963">I&#39;ve gotten in real trouble responding to someone who was asking what I would do if my child did something her child had done. She didn&#39;t want me to tell her, not really. What she wanted me to say was that kids are just bad and trouble and to give some instance or the other that was similar. I didn&#39;t do that. Instead I offered suggestions and ideas and talked about trying to think about the good things and not the bad. In the end it jeopardized Linnaea&#39;s friendship with her daughter. I don&#39;t say anything these days. I talk about many things other than her children. If she talks about them, well, it hasn&#39;t happened yet, but I try and stay as uninvolved in those kinds of conversations as I possibly can. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have anything to offer you. I just feel sad when I listen to people complain about their children or their partners. Neither seems to be a step in a direction that leads to anything but more misery and hatefulness. <br/>
<br/>
Actually, Kelly just posted a link (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.changestherapy.com/home.nxg)">http://www.changestherapy.com/home.nxg)</a> to the definition of &quot;fogging&quot; which might be a useful technique if you wanted to not be silent all the time. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I really can&#39;t answer this but it reminded me of a work function a few years ago when someone was complaining out her 12 year old.  She went on and on and finally I said something like &quot;when I feel like Alex and I are having some problems communicating, I realize we haven&#39;t spent any time cuddling lately, so I invite her to cuddle and watch a movie together or share a book or simply talk.  This helps us to reconnect and we tend to communicate better and life together more peacefully.&quot;  I thought it was a really good suggestion, but she just looked at me open mouthed.  Her child, she said, wouldn&#39;t even allow a quick hug, or a pat on the back.  She didn&#39;t want her mother to touch her at all.  She could not believe that my 12 year old loved to cuddle still.  It was my turn to look at her open mouthed--how could she not cuddle her child?   I really didn&#39;t know what to say.  I suggested she start slowly, and reminded her that even adults need physical comfort and cuddling, and especially teens did.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I really enjoy being with my kids too, but it&#39;s hard to be a single parent--I don&#39;t have anyone to talk to about this sort of thing.  It&#39;s all on me... <br/>

&gt; &gt; **Anyway - my question is what you do when you get into a situation  <br/>
&gt; &gt; in which<br/>
&gt; &gt; parents are sitting around badmouthing their own kids?**<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It depends on the circumstances. Mostly I try to just get out of those<br/>
&gt; &gt; situations. If I can&#39;t I try hard to stay quiet, because usually my  <br/>
&gt; &gt; saying anything<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t really going to help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is usually what I do, too. It leaves me with a bad taste in my  <br/>
&gt; mouth, but maybe that&#39;s inevitable. I don&#39;t like feeling like I&#39;m  <br/>
&gt; agreeing by my silence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m just not eloquent enough. Sometimes I might<br/>
&gt; &gt; mention the things I&#39;ve seen that are contrary to the negative  <br/>
&gt; &gt; evaluation, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; generally that just makes things worse.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes. And, I do sympathize with the parents. I KNOW they&#39;re hurting. I  <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t want to hurt them more.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Very occasionally with someone I know<br/>
&gt; &gt; really well I might point out that they themselves show a LOT of the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; trait<br/>
&gt; &gt; they&#39;re castigating their child for (it&#39;s often a glaring truth).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes - that&#39;s so true. The most self-absorbed parents complain the most  <br/>
&gt; about their selfish children. I see that a lot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Once or twice<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve mentioned that I&#39;ve found that the more I focus on how bad  <br/>
&gt; &gt; things are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; worse they get. Mostly I suppose I try to change the subject or go  <br/>
&gt; &gt; play with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am going to a grad-school reunion on Saturday night. It won&#39;t be  <br/>
&gt; large - just ten or so people and maybe their spouses - no children. I  <br/>
&gt; already heard that a couple of them are having big problems with their  <br/>
&gt; kids. The fact that I &quot;heard&quot; this means they&#39;re talking about it, so  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m anticipating this topic will come up. These are mostly people I  <br/>
&gt; have had little to no contact with for 20-plus years. The ones I still  <br/>
&gt; see and talk to are the ones with great kids - who like their kids and  <br/>
&gt; who hang out as a family. Not a coincidence that those are the ones I  <br/>
&gt; stayed friends with, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not always happy with my kids. They aren&#39;t always happy with me.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; But I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think hard not to put negative labels on them *especially in my own  <br/>
&gt; &gt; head*.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Declaring a person selfish, whiny, shallow, rude, inconsiderate,  <br/>
&gt; &gt; meanspirited,<br/>
&gt; &gt; dishonest, untrustworthy, etc. etc. locks them into that box, if  <br/>
&gt; &gt; only in my own<br/>
&gt; &gt; mind, so that ordinary human behaviours take on extraordinary  <br/>
&gt; &gt; negative meanings,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and perhaps temporary conditions gain weight and gravity and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; substance.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I couldn&#39;t agree more. I think this is the crux of what makes me so  <br/>
&gt; uncomfortable. I don&#39;t want to claim that I&#39;m always totally thrilled  <br/>
&gt; with my kids in every possible way - or them with me. But there is no  <br/>
&gt; WAY I&#39;m going to sit around and complain. And, overall, our lives are  <br/>
&gt; SO good. And, I don&#39;t want to label my kids with those negative terms  <br/>
&gt; for all the reasons Deb gave above.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I try really really hard not to go around complaining about my kids.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Okay,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that sounds like I&#39;m walking around a lot *feeling* like  <br/>
&gt; &gt; complaining, which<br/>
&gt; &gt; isn&#39;t true at all. I mean that when I *am* for one reason or another  <br/>
&gt; &gt; having<br/>
&gt; &gt; conflicts with or worries about one of my kids, that I try to be  <br/>
&gt; &gt; especially aware of<br/>
&gt; &gt; how I talk/write about them to other people. It seems to me that it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; harmful to our relationship for me to engage in that sort of  <br/>
&gt; &gt; negative talk where<br/>
&gt; &gt; people seem to be looking mostly for hand patting &quot;there there&quot; and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; agreement<br/>
&gt; &gt; that parenting is hard and kids can be so awful (the same sort of  <br/>
&gt; &gt; complaining a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of women seem to get into about husbands, for that matter).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; It&#39;s hard. Sometimes it seems like it&#39;s such a fine line between  <br/>
&gt; &gt; describing a<br/>
&gt; &gt; situation because you&#39;re asking for help in figuring it out, asking  <br/>
&gt; &gt; for help<br/>
&gt; &gt; to remember to breathe, laughing at your own foibles, and that  <br/>
&gt; &gt; negative<br/>
&gt; &gt; destructive complaining. Of course a lot of the time it&#39;s a grand  <br/>

&gt; Anyway - my question is what you do when you get into a situation in<br/>
&gt; which parents are sitting around badmouthing their own kids?<br/>
<br/>
This has come up for me a few times too, especially since all and<br/>
sundry are questioning my sanity for having (gasp in horror) a third<br/>
baby when I already have two very energetic (totally normal, sigh)<br/>
boys and we live on a boat so we&#39;re (gasp in horror) together all the<br/>
time. And yeah, it makes me writhe. Course, same thing when it&#39;s their<br/>
spouses they&#39;re whinging about. And that one comes up all the time<br/>
too. Ugh.<br/>
<br/>
But for parents complaining about their kids, I usually defer to my<br/>
parenting guru pal V. I wrote this blog post two years ago based on a<br/>
conversation with her and an incident at a restaurant.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
(this is from my old blog; for some reason that month didn&#39;t transfer<br/>
over to my new blog)<br/>
<br/>
So I shrug, and say &quot;well, ya know, my pal V, she&#39;s got 10 kids (pause<br/>
for gasp in horror, which by experience I know comes right after that<br/>
number), and ya know... she just likes them. And it seems to work<br/>
really well. So that&#39;s kinda how I try to wing it.&quot; And then I<br/>
promptly change the subject, to let it kinda sink in.<br/>
<br/>
HTH. And if not... hey, just pass the bean dip. =)<br/>

hard drugs and alcoholism, violence, etc.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the aikido thing to do would be to ask them why they thought  <br/>
their kids were so bad.  It will probably  make them want to change  <br/>
the subject.  If you maintain a more comfortable level of discussion  <br/>
by nodding and saying sorry or that&#39;s too bad, it will continue  <br/>
longer, maybe.<br/>

At a barbecue with co-workers, Keith spoke out when they got into  <br/>
kind of a mass complaining session about teens and jobs and how teens  <br/>
don&#39;t want jobs or don&#39;t work well when they have jobs.  Keith said  <br/>
Kirby was however old (16, 17) and had been working since  he was  <br/>
14.  I wasn&#39;t there, but Keith said they didn&#39;t know what to say, and  <br/>
it was like he killed the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe those parental dialogs are just like the mostly-worthless  <br/>
&quot;conversations&quot; between older strangers and any child they talk to:<br/>
<br/>
Simple short answers to what&#39;s your name, what grade are you in,  <br/>
what&#39;s your favorite subject, do you like your teacher.  That&#39;s all.   <br/>
Going outside the script is kinda rude.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe as the adults pre-scripted conversations used to be about the  <br/>
weather, when most people were farmers, now it&#39;s about how terrible  <br/>
something is:  gas prices, teenagers, politics.<br/>

When I taught 9th grade I was across and down one from an retired- <br/>
Marine math teacher.  He was a nice enough guy; not warm, wasn&#39;t  <br/>
going to be friends with someone female, 20 years younger and hippy- <br/>
ish.  But one day one of the girls was in tears because he had teased  <br/>
her too strongly about a boy who was indeed starting to like her, and  <br/>
that relationship could&#39;ve been good for both of them, and he was  <br/>
just casually screwin&#39; with it.   It was between classes and I went  <br/>
over there, all hot-headed and adrenalated as I used to get when I  <br/>
was young (and only very occasionally get now &lt;g&gt;) and said this and  <br/>
that and that she was crying and didn&#39;t he remember how it felt to be  <br/>
that age?<br/>
<br/>
He softened and looked at me and visibly was thinking.  And he said  <br/>
&quot;No, I really don&#39;t.  And he said it gently, and a little  <br/>
embarrassed.  And so I softened up too, and I said &quot;Well I do, so  <br/>
please don&#39;t do that anymore.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And he got nicer.<br/>
<br/>
But he didn&#39;t remember being their age and he was with 130 of them  <br/>
every day.<br/>

<br/>
Keith had a four hour mandatory training thing today at work.  It was  <br/>
about empowerment and the feeling of ownership.  He said they talked  <br/>
about stages of development and about what goes wrong, why kids lose  <br/>
their courage and enthusiasm.  They didn&#39;t blame school, and of  <br/>
course he couldn&#39;t tell me for hours&#39; worth anyway, and he and Marty  <br/>
are packing to go camping, but they mentioned something about &quot;when  <br/>
kids become teens and start developing a personality.&quot;<br/>

Keith did smart back at the guy at least once, but he didn&#39;t say  <br/>
anything about that one.  Not to the presenter, anyway.  To me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;So weird to find it slightly embarrassing to be happy with  my kids.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - my question is what you do when you get into a  situation in <br/>
which parents are sitting around badmouthing their own  kids?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
How strange-I read this after I got home from a get-together  where this <br/>
happened. It started out kind of mild, where I was just  sitting and being <br/>
thankful for my kids and who they are. But then it got  worse and I lowered my eyes, <br/>
because I was afraid if anyone looked at me, they  could see exactly how I <br/>
felt. After a story where the older kid &quot;allowed&quot; a  younger sibling to do <br/>
something without stopping it or telling a parent and the  mom said she told the <br/>
older kid he was going to be in &#39;way more trouble than the  little one because he <br/>
allowed it, I shrank in my seat and wanted to leave. It  was weird how it <br/>
almost took on a &quot;one-upping&quot; kind of thing, for the next one  to try to have a <br/>
story to show that their kid was &quot;worse&quot;... I usually try to  change the <br/>
subject, but I didn&#39;t even attempt it in that atmosphere... Sometimes  I just thing <br/>
it is &quot;what people do&quot;, so they do it without thinking or just to  fit in. <br/>
Other times, I&#39;m not so sure... <br/>
 <br/>
I did get a chance to talk in depth later to one who had laughed at the  <br/>
stories, but when we talked later and I shared some of the ways that I parent,  <br/>
she would say, &quot;Oh, me too!&quot;, so maybe I got in a bit of &quot;reverse peer  <br/>
pressure&quot;. No, it wasn&#39;t pressure... A different lead to follow? Maybe. At any  rate, <br/>
that conversation, one-on-one ended up going much better and more hopeful  and <br/>
positive. It made what could have ended as a bummer night into a pretty good  <br/>
one.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess it depends on the people and the situation. Sometimes I try to  <br/>
ignore and wait for another topic to come up, sometimes I find a way to walk  away <br/>
for a while, sometimes I change the subject myself. Other times, I&#39;m  feeling <br/>
peevish and I deliberately throw out a completely opposite point of view  in a <br/>
loud, proud way (rather obnoxiously). Inevitably, I&#39;ll get  <br/>
deer-in-the-headlight, nonplused looks, a brief silence will fall, and then  someone *else* <br/>
changes the subject. But I&#39;m not often in the right frame of mind  for that. :~)<br/>

Then, I will pick something out of the conversation that I agree with.  It<br/>
reminds me a little of the Fogging that I just read about.  Say a mom was<br/>
telling a story about stuff her children did at a park, I might say &quot;oh, we<br/>
love to go to the park, have you gone to this one or that one?&quot;.  It&#39;s<br/>
changing the subject, but, picking something out of the story so that it&#39;s<br/>
not way out there.   I have on occasion offered suggestions.  I might just<br/>
inquire &quot;have you tried this?&quot; or &quot;my kids respond well to this&quot;.   If I<br/>
can&#39;t find anything to say, I do just stay quiet.  Which sometimes says more<br/>
than any words I could find.<br/>

Most to all of us, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the combination of La Leche League and Adult Children of  <br/>
Alcoholics helped immensely to put me in a better frame of mind than  <br/>
the one I brought out of my own upbringing.  But how many gathousands  <br/>
of people have had a sweet first few years with their children, and  <br/>
then put them in school?    Even with a flawless start (which my kids  <br/>
didn&#39;t have, I&#39;m not saying that at all--I was figuring it out  <br/>
roughly sometimes), school could take down all progress, and does  <br/>
with some kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that part of what happens when the bond is broken by school  <br/>
(consciously and deliberately in many cases), not only does the child  <br/>
lose faith in and desire for the parent, but the parent resigns  <br/>
himself or herself to the loss of that relationship.  That would  <br/>

meant was that you feel &quot;odd-man-out&quot;?  It&#39;s great that you have older <br/>
children and know that the parent/child relationship can be different <br/>
and you have the proof that your way is BETTER ;-)  So when you find <br/>
yourself in that situation, ground yourself in your truth.  Instead of <br/>
feeling out of it, you could choose to be the mentor.<br/>
<br/>
Depending on the other parents involved I&#39;ve been known to say:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Do you ever say anything nice about your children?&quot; <br/>
&quot;I don&#39;t find that to be true about teenagers at all!&quot;<br/>
&quot;I have two teens and think they&#39;re fabulous!!!&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve loved every stage that my children have gone through.&quot;<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s hurting my spirit to hear you say all these negative things about <br/>
your child.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Do you say that where your child can HEAR you??&quot;<br/>
&quot;So....tell me something good about your child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Complaining about children has become a bonding ritual in our cut <br/>
up/isolated society..a way that someone can quickly find &quot;common <br/>
ground&quot; with another.  &quot;oh...we both have kids??  Let&#39;s complain about <br/>
them!&quot;  Kind of like moaning about your sports team.  So much like <br/>
saying &quot;sorry...I&#39;m not into sports&quot;  you can state your position of <br/>
not being into child-bashing.  And then find something that you can <br/>
talk about.<br/>

Complaining about children and spouses is pretty commom. It starts when moms get the:<br/>
&quot;Is he/she a good baby?&quot;<br/>
for which I answered:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;All babies are good!&quot;<br/>
And was usually followed by:<br/>
&quot; I mean does she/he sleeps through the night?&quot;<br/>
and on and on...<br/>
Depending on the person I just nod or I  mke coments like:<br/>
&quot;Being strong willed is a great quality.&quot;<br/>
&quot; He must know what he wants and that is good&quot;<br/>
and so on.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not even always *strictly* school, but the societal mentality that has  <br/>
come to be about &quot;the age of school&quot;. That&#39;s when my disconnect with Wyl  <br/>
happened. It is that concept that now they&#39;re 5 and they&#39;ve started this  &quot;growing <br/>
up&quot; process... or maybe parents disconnect emotionally from their kids  so <br/>
they&#39;re not sad and missing them all day... I&#39;m not sure. I just know that SO  <br/>
many people view &quot;kindergarten age&quot; (and even into preschool age, now) as some  <br/>
sort of emotional shift that needs to come about.<br/>
 <br/>
I hated how my relationship with Wyl had gotten and my grumpiness with it  <br/>
ended up transferring to him-as if the thing were *his* fault!! It wasn&#39;t until  <br/>
I got so much wisdom from this group and Always Unschooled that I was able to <br/>
 stop and retrace my steps to &quot;find&quot; ourselves again. Now, we are happily  <br/>
snuggling, hugging, sharing, joking-even our disagreements are gentle, now. The  <br/>
antagonism is gone. I&#39;ve found understanding and peace with Wyl and I&#39;m <br/>
seeing  him as *Wyl* now, not the kid who&#39;s not doing/behaving/being as he &quot;should&quot; <br/>
 be.  I&#39;m seeing him as a person who still needs help and guidance and  <br/>
compassion not a difficult kid who isn&#39;t &quot;measuring up&quot; to some vague standard  of <br/>
behavior or social comportment. Thank goodness.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve lost my train of thought. The joy of my children has gotten too loud  <br/>
for me to fish thoughts out of my brain, so I&#39;m off to enjoy their joy.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
Sandra suggested I ask them why they thought their kids were so bad?<br/>
<br/>
I can imagine doing that in a way that is kind and I can see some  <br/>
possible good coming from that question, if not for them, for other  <br/>
people who are listening, whose kids are still young. And I can also  <br/>
see that it might make them want to immediately change the subject.<br/>
<br/>
I can also see doing what Mary describes - treating it like a  <br/>
discussion that I just can&#39;t participate in because it isn&#39;t my  <br/>
&quot;thing.&quot; The only problem with that is that I &#39;do&#39; have kids and they  <br/>
know it and they are sort of waiting for me to take my turn. Even  <br/>
silence is a social blunder in this &quot;bonding ritual&quot; as Mary so well  <br/>
described it.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is, of course, I&#39;m talking about situations when I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to offend people. If I didn&#39;t mind offending them, I&#39;d just say,  <br/>
&quot;Talking about your kid this way isn&#39;t nice. You might have fewer  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That sort of thing even happens without being in person.  I got some  <br/>
heartrending &quot;jokes&quot; by e-mail, and responded to the full list saying  <br/>
I didn&#39;t think it was funny at all, and I saw sorry they did.  Some  <br/>
of them were teachers.  One was a friend of mine from 1978, who came  <br/>
to stay with me when Kirby was due (and had to give up and go home  <br/>
when he didn&#39;t arrive on time), and I had kept in touch with her for  <br/>
a long, long time.  A nice Mormon friend from Salt Lake City.<br/>
<br/>
Because I objected, I got two RUDE e-mails from people I didn&#39;t know,  <br/>
and my friend wasn&#39;t my friend anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
<br/>
I could have kept her friendship at the cost of quietly condoning the  <br/>
derision of children, and of the assumptions that when adults are  <br/>
mean to children it&#39;s no big deal.   I was sad to lose that friend,  <br/>
but not sad enough to participate even in the enjoyment of the idea  <br/>
of the mistreatment of children.<br/>
<br/>
I know, no children were harmed in the passing on of jokes by e-mail,  <br/>
but were women harmed by rape jokes?  Were Rastus and Liza jokes  <br/>
harmless?   There&#39;s physical harm, but then there&#39;s social erosion.<br/>

Chance is soon 17 and I&#39;ve known him since he was 2. The minute my friend<br/>
(Mary Gold) and I crossed the threshold, the boy fell to pieces... he was a<br/>
churning, bubbling, boiling vat of frustration and more frustration and in<br/>
dire, desperate need to be heard. Thankfully, Mary happens to be the<br/>
unschooling mama of a couple of pretty cool teens and happens to spend a lot<br/>
of time with a lot of really cool unschooling kids. We &quot;tag teamed&quot; them (me<br/>
with mom, her with Chance) for a while, then we had a big venting where we<br/>
restrained mom from responding, encouraged pure listening. Then we talked<br/>
and talked and talked and talked about how much we love the teens in our<br/>
lives and how it doesn&#39;t *have to* be any shitty way that any *well<br/>
respected* whomevers are telling you it does. When we extolled Chance&#39;s<br/>
virtues, she responded, &quot;Everyone says that.&quot; She doesn&#39;t believe them, she<br/>
doesn&#39;t see the amazing human he *is* -- she sees what she fears he&#39;ll<br/>
*become.* And she has really scary fears. Unfounded and unrealistic and<br/>
really freaking scary. I want her to see the GIFT her kid *is* right this<br/>
very moment. I want her to like her kid. I want her to *want to* be on his<br/>
team. I asked her to think about, just for a moment, what it would have been<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-6859269">Seventeen is way better than never.  Part of what holds parents up is the<br/>
posts I&#39;ve seen lately around unschooling boards about guilt for not<br/>
*getting it* sooner.  Letting go of guilt for screwing things up.  Happily<br/>
getting on with mindful conscious decisions about the choices open to us.<br/>
And being happy about it.<br/>
<br/>
If this momma can break through and keep striding forward, it will mean so<br/>
much to them both to have a closer relationship.  I am so pleased and very<br/>
fortunate to have some kind of relaxed peaceful relationship with my folks<br/>
even if it&#39;s still at arm&#39;s length, even if there&#39;s still tons of<br/>
differences getting in the way of real closeness.<br/>

Chance... very appropriate name.<br/>

&gt; Last month I had a whirlwind visit with my best friend and her son, in LA.<br/>
&gt; Chance is soon 17 and I&#39;ve known him since he was 2. The minute my friend<br/>
&gt; (Mary Gold) and I crossed the threshold, the boy fell to pieces... he was a<br/>
&gt; churning, bubbling, boiling vat of frustration and more frustration and in<br/>
&gt; dire, desperate need to be heard. Thankfully, Mary happens to be the<br/>
&gt; unschooling mama of a couple of pretty cool teens and happens to spend a<br/>
&gt; lot<br/>
&gt; of time with a lot of really cool unschooling kids. We &quot;tag teamed&quot; them<br/>
&gt; (me<br/>
&gt; with mom, her with Chance) for a while, then we had a big venting where we<br/>
&gt; restrained mom from responding, encouraged pure listening. Then we talked<br/>
&gt; and talked and talked and talked about how much we love the teens in our<br/>
&gt; lives and how it doesn&#39;t *have to* be any shitty way that any *well<br/>
&gt; respected* whomevers are telling you it does. When we extolled Chance&#39;s<br/>
&gt; virtues, she responded, &quot;Everyone says that.&quot; She doesn&#39;t believe them, she<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t see the amazing human he *is* -- she sees what she fears he&#39;ll<br/>
&gt; *become.* And she has really scary fears. Unfounded and unrealistic and<br/>
&gt; really freaking scary. I want her to see the GIFT her kid *is* right this<br/>
&gt; very moment. I want her to like her kid. I want her to *want to* be on his<br/>
&gt; team. I asked her to think about, just for a moment, what it would have<br/>
&gt; been<br/>

&gt; &gt; So weird to find it slightly embarrassing to be happy with my kids.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway - my question is what you do when you get into a situation in  <br/>
&gt; &gt; which parents are sitting around badmouthing their own kids?<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; -pam<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; first off, don&#39;t be embarassed!  Although I think what you might have <br/>
&gt; meant was that you feel &quot;odd-man-out&quot;? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ive been trying to come into this discussion and having trouble to do<br/>
so, so thank you mary for your words...<br/>
<br/>
for me that is the feeling, odd man out.  Not embarassed. I used to<br/>
get alot of those moments, where others discuss their children in a<br/>
negative way, but the past few years or so, the conversations have<br/>
turned tides.  I couldnt put my finger on it  but I think this is why:<br/>
<br/>
 It&#39;s great that you have older <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; children and know that the parent/child relationship can be different <br/>
&gt; and you have the proof that your way is BETTER ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>not only do I have older children, but i still have a crew of smallies<br/>
as well.  Where ever I go, there are a bunch of us.  And it is obvious<br/>
we are happy together and having a good time.  And they are what<br/>
people call &quot;good children&quot; in the sense that they dont race about or<br/>
talk back or act sullen.  <br/>
<br/>
And because Ive always said that I have so many children because I<br/>
like them (schuyler, your blog post was just beautiful--ive stuck it<br/>
in my translating bag)...well Im thinking that the moments for people<br/>
to start complaining just wash away because Ive chosen in the past few<br/>
years to be the mentor: if I can do it, anybody can.  You just need<br/>
the desire. That is how I present myself now. I am proud of being a<br/>
mamma of 7, I have earned my masters degree and am working on my phd<br/>
in mothering so to speak--<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So when you find <br/>
&gt; yourself in that situation, ground yourself in your truth.  Instead of <br/>
&gt; feeling out of it, you could choose to be the mentor.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>so thank you for making this so clear.  Ive been doing it but not<br/>
conciously thinking it as a motto.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Depending on the other parents involved I&#39;ve been known to say:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;Do you ever say anything nice about your children?&quot; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I don&#39;t find that to be true about teenagers at all!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I have two teens and think they&#39;re fabulous!!!&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;I&#39;ve loved every stage that my children have gone through.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;It&#39;s hurting my spirit to hear you say all these negative things about <br/>
&gt; your child.&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Do you say that where your child can HEAR you??&quot;<br/>
&gt; &quot;So....tell me something good about your child.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes! I also ask <br/>
  &quot; when is the last time you actually looked in your childs eyes and<br/>
smiled?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; Complaining about children has become a bonding ritual in our cut <br/>
&gt; up/isolated society..a way that someone can quickly find &quot;common <br/>
&gt; ground&quot; with another.  &quot;oh...we both have kids??  Let&#39;s complain about <br/>
&gt; them!&quot;  Kind of like moaning about your sports team.  So much like <br/>
&gt; saying &quot;sorry...I&#39;m not into sports&quot;  you can state your position of <br/>
&gt; not being into child-bashing.  And then find something that you can <br/>
&gt; talk about.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Exactly!  Its okay to not be interested in a topic of conversation.<br/>
And it is totally okay to shift conversations to a different pov.  So<br/>
why not when the conversation is about child bashing, or husband<br/>
bashing ? its okay to say, hey, my kids are great, and I think yours<br/>
probably are too, if you took the time to see it.<br/>
<br/>
The more you see it, the more they will be it.<br/>
<br/>
thanks mary for such a nice direct post.<br/>
