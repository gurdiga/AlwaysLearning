<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just because it&#39;s a substance found in nature doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s non-toxic. Nature is perfectly capable of creating toxic substances! Pure and untreated doesn&#39;t make them less toxic. There&#39;s a claim at the site: &quot;It&#39;s also naturally chemical free.&quot; Minerals are chemicals. Water&#39;s even a chemical.<br/>
<br/>
Organic substances and natural doesn&#39;t mean non-toxic either. Nightshade is an organic substance and natural and some species are quite toxic.<br/>
<br/>
So I would question the doctor further about what chemicals your daughter needs to avoid. Is this a matter of better safe than sorry? Or is there specific research about people with liver problems having difficulties with makeup? Maybe it&#39;s just <br/>
