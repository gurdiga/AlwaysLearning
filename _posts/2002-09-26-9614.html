concerns and EVERYTHING! I know it&#39;s VERY close, but if you haven&#39;t already, <br/>

did they? I don&#39;t recall getting anything.<br/>
Mind you, its taken me two weeks to locate the booking number <br/>
the hotel gave me. Sigh.<br/>

pre-registering.  But I may have to work and don&#39;t want to loose my money if <br/>
I do.<br/>
