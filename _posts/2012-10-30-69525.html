<div id="ygrps-yiv-938689711">Hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve posted here a couple of times over the past few years but have been<br/>
reading daily. I&#39;m not sure this is appropriate question to ask here?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently joined a face book group for Radical Unschoolers in the UK.<br/>
There appears to be huge differences of opinion about what Radical<br/>
Unschooling is and what it isn&#39;t. It feels like an anything goes group (I&#39;m<br/>
struggling with this but that&#39;s another story) at the moment, which doesn&#39;t<br/>
feel like it is supporting people to move towards Radical Unschooling (not<br/>
as I understand it anyway)<br/>
<br/>
Could you guys point me in the direction of a comprehensive definition of<br/>
Radical Unschooling that would help the group develop it&#39;s terms of<br/>
reference. I&#39;m not sure that a definition will be the panacea I&#39;m hoping<br/>
for, and I might need to accept that it&#39;s not a group I can use. There<br/>
seems to be fundamental differences between the Radical Unschooling<br/>
philpsophy in the US and what is called Radical Unschooling  in the UK. I<br/>
think this has been mentioned recently on this list.<br/>

My own favorite, developed after years, is that unschooling is creating and maintaining an environment in which natural learning can flourish.<br/>

No, what I mentioned was that &quot;Autonomous Ed&quot; isn&#39;t the same as unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve spoken in the UK several times (three places in one week in Scotland, three conferences in/near London, twice the same day in Bristol).  There are people who read this list or Radical Unschooling Info on Facebook.  Maybe they&#39;re also on that UK Radical Unschooling list; maybe not.     I think if that discussion is an &quot;anything goes&quot; list, it&#39;s probably from the influence of an individual or small group, rather than being an all-UK reality.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Sure, that&#39;s been the case for a long time!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If this is a local group in which you want to find friends, I wouldn&#39;t push it too much on the definition.  Local groups are notoriously terrible when it comes to this weirdness of &quot;anything goes, nicey nicey&quot; stuff.  It seems to me, that local groups are mostly for finding friends and supporting each other, but not in the supporting each other to be better unschoolers.  That&#39;s been my experience and I&#39;ve heard from many others that seems to reflect that.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s sad that it&#39;s harder to find radical unschooling integrity in local unschooling groups, but it doesn&#39;t mean those folks don&#39;t exist within the local groups.  It generally means they shut up to avoid arguments locally.  Moderators make such a big difference in these matters!  <br/>
<br/>
***There<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that to be true, but in actuality, radical unschooling was coined by Sandra Dodd, so there shouldn&#39;t be any sort of twisting of it to mean other things.  Unschooling, on the other hand means so many different things to so many different people, which is partly why Sandra made a distinction in the first place.  You have unschooling which means not doing school or replicating.  That&#39;s a huge sort of thing.  Radical unschooling, at the core, means that if you can learn without school, then learning is natural, and if learning is natural then one can learn everything else too, not just schoolish things.  Things like when one is tired and needs sleep and when one is hungry and what to eat.<br/>

I agree it probably is from a small group. I think my frustration has led<br/>
me to generalise, and effected my ability to acknowledge that there are<br/>
people on that group, who think about and are moving towards Radical<br/>
Unschooling. Maybe I just need to use my voice more, the conflict though is<br/>
wearing but may be part of the process.<br/>

<br/>
Asking people why they are writing what they&#39;re writing (or thinking what they&#39;re thinking) might be all you need.<br/>
Or asking them how long they&#39;ve unschooled and how it&#39;s going at their house. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Some people jump up and &quot;speak&quot; before they really know what they&#39;re talking about.  Of those, some don&#39;t mind a bit when someone else gives them a chance to clarify.  Some get huffy and go away.  Either way is probably good for the larger group.  <br/>
