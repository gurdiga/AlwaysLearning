<div id="ygrps-yiv-494040913">Ten hours or so from posting this, I&#39;m having a two-hour online chat.   <br/>

<br/>
It will be on young children (at the request of a mom in Montreal).   <br/>
1:00 her time; 11:00 a.m my time; check your own time by going to the  <br/>
link above, and at that hour go back to that link to get into the  <br/>
chatroom.<br/>
<br/>
Friday night, another one, on how it is people learn about  <br/>
unschooling, and how they could do it better, maybe.<br/>
Same link.<br/>
<br/>
If someone would like to post this on Unschooling Basics and  <br/>
AlwaysUnschooled, that would be nice.  I&#39;m not on either of those.<br/>

Oh man!  I would love to see this chat, but will be babysitting on <br/>
Thursday and won&#39;t be able to log in!  Is there any way to get the <br/>
transcript after the fact?  I know, probably too much to ask, but I <br/>
would really appreciate it if it were possible.<br/>

Thank you!<br/>

if you want (I&#39;ll copy and paste the text once in a while, and put it<br/>
in a word doc, and I can put it up somewhere for everybody to see.)<br/>

Chats are often more chatty than substantial, but if there are great  <br/>
suggestions, I&#39;ll bring them to a page somewhere and let you know.<br/>
