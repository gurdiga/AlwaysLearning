<div id="ygrps-yiv-739432353">I saw Barbara at my very first Unschool Conference (L&L &#39;04). She is an<br/>
incredible woman & a fun mom.  She had not heard of unschooling before the<br/>
invite & wished she had, definitely the spirit of an unschooler in her.<br/>
Her boys only had 2 rules growing up: don&#39;t kill each other & don&#39;t break my<br/>
stuff. I think a weekend with the principles vs rules questioning was<br/>
life-changing for her, too ;)<br/>
I&#39;m going to revisit her stuff,  it&#39;s been a long time :)<br/>
Hers is a beneficial voice to add to your internal choir!<br/>

It might not be for you but perhaps try the concepts (which aren&#39;t at all<br/>
deep) in Refuse to Choose by Barbara Sher. I have struggled to be better at<br/>
organizing and planning and the actual doing of my plans. A couple of the<br/>
ideas just aren&#39;t me, and don&#39;t fit, but Sher&#39;s suggestions are working for<br/>
me. I&#39;ve always been the kind of person that things happen to without much<br/>
planning and just the idea of how to do it has been pretty foreign in the<br/>
past. But I&#39;m taking to the ideas in Sher&#39;s book like a duck to water. Not<br/>
hard for me. It might be something to check out of the library tho I got my<br/>
copy cheap from Amazon.<br/>
