<div id="ygrps-yiv-875951899">Hi everyone, we have been unschooling since I pulled my son out of preschool at age 3.  Joe is 8 now.  He has had no formal instruction in reading except what they might have done in preschool.  <br/>
<br/>
We read a lot of books, we look at a lot of pictures, and we play a lot of games.  My son also loves to watch youtube videos of people playing video games.  he probably watches youtube 2 to 6 hours a day most days.  I have read him thousands of video titles.<br/>
<br/>
The evidence over the last 6 weeks or so is undeniable.  he is reading words and titles and random things he sees.  He is even reading short sentences.  I love it! <br/>
<br/>
Reading is what my husband was most worried about.  I wasn&#39;t as worried about it but I wasn&#39;t quite sure how it would end up happening.<br/>
<br/>
Now that I have seen him learn it I think that what he did was he just learned a lot of words on sight (naturally memorized the whole word).  <br/>
<br/>
I remember when he was 4 or 5 thinking he could probably read about 100 to 200 words on sight - things like Mcdonalds and Walmart and Starbucks and Stop and Exit and Enter and Push and Pull.  things he saw every day.<br/>
<br/>
McDonalds and Walmart have a picture that can be associated with the word but push and pull and exit and enter don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
6 months ago I had no way to estimate how many words he knew on sight but it was more than when he was 4 and 5.<br/>
<br/>
Today, he recognizes thousands of words on sight and somehow he has &#39;cracked the code&#39; as I have heard others say and is able to figure out many words based on words he does know.<br/>
<br/>
another thing he likes to do is make a guess on what the word is based on context and the first letter of the word.  He&#39;s really good at that.<br/>
<br/>
So basically, I just wanted to say thanks for all the links and talks and assurances.  I&#39;m seeing my son do it and it&#39;s amazing.  he is amazing.  this group is amazing.  The fact that a child can learn to read with no instruction is amazing.  <br/>
<br/>
My son taught himself to swim at age 2 (we lived in Hawaii and we were in the water a lot).  That&#39;s something I proudly tell anyone who will listen.  Now, I get to tell people he taught himself to read by age 8.    <br/>
<br/>
I love the thought of the self-image and the positive view of his abilities that must give him.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1607471018">My son had a similar experience and also taught himself to read at age 8! :) This is great news!!!! I know that affirmation of your choices is important and this is just that. <br/>
<br/>
My son also watches youtube videos of people playing video games. He learned to read by reading game books and through video games. It just clicked! <br/>

Thanks for sharing all that.  It IS amazing, the way people learn.<br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;ll tell people he learned to read on his own (rather than saying &quot;he taught himself to read,&quot; it will help them understand unschooling better, and it will help you, too, to really get the difference between something that involves &quot;teaching&quot; and the natural acquisition of knowledge--learning.<br/>

<br/>
On this list, affirmation of people&#39;s choices isn&#39;t as important as clarity about what helps natural learning unfold.<br/>
<br/>
-=-also taught himself to read...-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you can avoid &quot;teach/taught&quot; on this list, you can start to avoid it other places, and it *WILL* make a difference in the clarity of your understanding.  Not might, not could.  Will.<br/>

Thank you Sandra - you are right.  I watched the learning to swim unfold from the first time in the water till he was swimming as well as I can and I watched the learning to read unfold from the time we first talked about letters till now and he didn&#39;t sit down and employ any methods or do anything deliberately.  He lived and played and did what he wanted and the learning happened within him.</div>
