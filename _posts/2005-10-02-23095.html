<br/>
links at the bottom to goatheads, morning glories, and egyptian onions.   <br/>
I&#39;ll probably add moonflowers before long.<br/>
<br/>
The tumbleweed page has two new photos of Holly.   OLD photos of Holly and a <br/>
tumbleweed, but newly set in there.<br/>
<br/>
================<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s above I had written to a friend of mine, but it&#39;s true there are new <br/>
photos of Holly, and lots of people on this list who didn&#39;t see those pages <br/>
before.<br/>
<br/>
Another new page, about Halloween:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/halloween">http://sandradodd.com/halloween</a><br/>
and it leads to a couple of kid-photos.<br/>
<br/>
If you get any anti-Halloween e-mail this season, please forward it to me.   <br/>
I love that stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730343139">Sorry, my message didn&#39;t post.  Sandra, please let us know when you <br/>
update about the Moonflowers.  I  think I have some, but can&#39;t seem to <br/>
get enough info for a definitive answer.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet pictures of Holly~although I don&#39;t think I&#39;d like to sit on a <br/>
tumbleweed either. :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace~Jessica</div>

Second entry.   They open up better now, and last night there were TEN at <br/>
once!   Very exciting.   Now we leave for eight days. &lt;g&gt;   Our housesitter will <br/>
water them and I hope she remembers to admire them.<br/>
<br/>
The blooms are 5 inches and 5.5 (those I&#39;ve examined closely), and the vine <br/>
is bigger and harder than a morning glory vine.   I don&#39;t know how high they <br/>
could&#39;ve gone. They&#39;re on a pretty high wall, and are hanging over the roof at <br/>
the top, reaching around for more, so next year I plan to put some at the <br/>
bottoms of a couple of dead trees we have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344079656">The mystery flower is a Spider Lily! It&#39;s also sometimes called a  <br/>
Naked Lady (because of the lack of foliage). Botanical name Lycoris  <br/>
radiata. The leaves will come up after the flowers die back, but  <br/>
don&#39;t cut the leaves or you may not get blooms next season! They are  <br/>
bulbs--I have moved all of mine into the flower beds, as it&#39;s  <br/>
impossible not to mow down the leaves when they are in the grass. But  <br/>
I do think they look cool popping up all over the lawn :-)<br/>
<br/>
We have a ton, and just love them! They are about to open up here,  <br/>
and my five year old is beside himself :-D<br/>
