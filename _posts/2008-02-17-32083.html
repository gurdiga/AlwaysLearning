<br/>
this makes me happy to know!  thank you for sharing it...when I was in a creative writing <br/>
class in college, I wrote in &quot;anderson mode&quot; alot, as i really liked his story telling flair...and <br/>
each time I wrote that way, my pieces were cut apart ruthlessly by the prof who was a <br/>
poet...I was always so disappointed!  I enjoyed writing that way yet never could figure out <br/>
why it wasnt appreciated, though he did like other pieces that were more of an ursula le <br/>
guin style...<br/>
<br/>
maybe thats why!<br/>
<br/>
or maybe my writing sucks, lol...melissa</div>

 </span></blockquote>To write in a conversational style isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds.  There  <br/>
are people who cannot write in their own real voices, nor in anyone  <br/>
else&#39;s.  They write in a stilted, formal book-style that&#39;s not fun to  <br/>
read.<br/>
<br/>
Learning to spell correctly doesn&#39;t matter so much.  Learning to  <br/>
write &quot;properly,&quot; depends what &quot;properly&quot; means.  If it means  <br/>
&quot;stilted,&quot; I&#39;m against it! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mother and I have a debate about this type of stuff a lot...she  <br/>
will constantly correct my or dh&#39;s grammar--and it&#39;s &quot;outdated&quot;  <br/>
grammar.  I end up explaining that language evolves and changes.  We  <br/>
don&#39;t speak Elizabethan English anymore, because the language has  <br/>
changed.  It would be unrealistic to hold onto the same exact  <br/>
grammatical styles that were used 50 and 60 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
I just read _Tim Gunn&#39;s Guide to Style_ because I really like his  <br/>
show.  (It&#39;s pretty silly, I know.  :-)  But I loved reading it  <br/>
because I could hear his voice the entire time.  He does use  <br/>
incredibly proper grammar, but it&#39;s *completely* him.  My hubby just  <br/>
finished writing his first book, and I&#39;ve enjoyed it so because, again  <br/>
I could hear him in it.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if Hans&#39;s friends felt the same way about his writing.  :-)<br/>
