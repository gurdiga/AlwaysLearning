<div id="ygrps-yiv-168911571">Hi all, <br/>
I have just been to Corvalis, Life is Good, and came away with a <br/>
printout of many unschooling sites and yahoo groups to check out. I <br/>
have joined several of them, but as I have perused them the last few <br/>
weeks, none of them yet feels like a great fit.<br/>
So I am looking for advice...does anyone know of a good unschooling <br/>
group with an athiest or agnostic or secular slant? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Almost all of the unschooling boards *I* know of are secular. The <br/>
bigger boards all are. Although religion does come up occasionally the <br/>
moderators consistently work to keep those discussions directly <br/>
related to unschooling (as Sandra did, here, just recently). <br/>
<br/>
As far as finding a &quot;good fit&quot; - some of that is just personalities, <br/>
but there are boards with specific purposes - like U. Basics for newer <br/>
unschoolers, or Always U. for folks with younger children. <br/>
