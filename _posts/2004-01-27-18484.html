<div id="ygrps-yiv-1786900037">HI<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to ask if you liked the eyetoy? Did it work well? At least well<br/>
enough to make up for hte cost.<br/>
Cheyenne can not use the controllers for the regular games and gets very<br/>
frustrated. She has had several strokes and can not use her left hand much. <br/>
I saw this and thought it might be a good idea. If it really works well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1279362967">The eye toy actually belonged to the other family.  Maybe she will chime in here.  My boys really did like it.  We have a GameCube and now they want PS2....for the eye toy!  The cost really isn&#39;t that much more than a regular game, is it?  And I think you get something like 12 games on it.  <br/>

easy to set up.  Jackson and I also like it too :-)<br/>
We tried it out at Best Buy before we bought it.  They had it set up on one <br/>
of their big screen TVs there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-75905435">Hi,<br/>
I am the &quot;other&quot; mom that reads everything, but posts rarely :)  My<br/>
husband spends a lot more time doing video games alone and with the kids<br/>
than I do so I asked him to respond to this e-mail.   I have copied his<br/>
response below. :)<br/>

The eye toy is a great tool, and the 12 included games are easy to learn<br/>
and play, but fun for many different skill levels.  I&#39;m sure you know<br/>
this already, but I wanted to be sure -- It is not a replacement for a<br/>
regular controller, and can only be used with the games designed<br/>
specifically for the eye toy. Right now, the only games available are<br/>
the 12 that come with it, but there are others on the way according to<br/>
eyetoy.com -- I think they are ideal for the child who would like to<br/>
play video games, but may have fine motor difficulties.  For our kids,<br/>
it has certainly been worth the money.  <br/>
