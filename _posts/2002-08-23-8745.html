<div id="ygrps-yiv-2108610925">I just watched (on DVD) a movie called &quot;Limey.&quot;  It&#39;s a revenge drama, and I <br/>
got it because of liking Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and wanting to see <br/>
more movies with those lead actors in them.  So I&#39;m watching Terence Stamp <br/>
play a long-imprisoned Englishman hunting down those involved in his <br/>
daughter&#39;s death...<br/>
<br/>
Not usually my kind of movie, but I&#39;m looking at the accent.<br/>
<br/>
So, he&#39;s doing an accent that has similarities with that of Ali G and I&#39;m <br/>
wondering if some Londonite, Londonoid or Anglophilinguist could tell me what <br/>
accent it was.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
