I have been having a ball on these two sites.  Some  of you may have seen them <br/>
before, but if you haven&#39;t, give them a try.   They&#39;re addictive!<br/>

It&#39;s the magic of our base 10 system :-)<br/>
<br/>
Basically what you&#39;re doing is eliminating the second digit and then  <br/>
subtracting the first digit from 10 times the first digit which  <br/>
always give 9 times the first digit. On the Egyptian chart at the  <br/>
end, all the multiples of 9 always have the same symbol next to them.<br/>
<br/>
Algebraically it goes like this ...<br/>
<br/>
If a number looks like ab, it would be represented algebracially as:<br/>
<br/>
10*a + b.<br/>
<br/>
So for:<br/>
<br/>
12 then a=1 and b=2 so 12=10*1 + 2<br/>
37 then a=3 and b=7 so 37=10*3 + 7<br/>
82 then a=8 and b=2 so 82=10*8 +2<br/>
<br/>
In the first step of the game they ask you to add a and b together.  <br/>
And then they tell you to subtract that number from the original  <br/>
number. That&#39;s just a way of eliminating the last digit so all  <br/>
problems turn into:<br/>
<br/>
10*a + b - (a+b)<br/>
<br/>
rearranging, you can see that the b part of every 2 digit number gets  <br/>
eliminated:<br/>
<br/>
10*a - a + b - b<br/>
<br/>
So all problems turn into either 10-1, 20-2, 30-3, 40-4 ...<br/>
<br/>
10*a - a = 9a<br/>
<br/>
10*1 - 1 = 9*1 = 9<br/>
10*2 - 2 = 9*2 = 18<br/>
10*3 - 3 = 9*3 = 27<br/>
<br/>
and so on. So all two digit numbers are turned into 9 times the first  <br/>
digit of the number.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501135434">Two things:  The site they&#39;re talking about is this:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.learnenglish.org.uk/games/magic-gopher-central.swf">http://www.learnenglish.org.uk/games/magic-gopher-central.swf</a><br/>
<br/>
Joyce&#39;s explanation is great *except* I think what she failed to say  <br/>
to calm math-phobes is that the &quot;Egyptian chart&quot; changes each time.   <br/>
So if a player is thinking that the cartoon gopher is choosing from  <br/>
all those different symbols and numbers, no.  The reason different  <br/>
symbols show different times is that the program changes (either in a  <br/>
sequence or randomly) and all the numbers that are NOT multiples of  <br/>
nine (which are never going to be your final answer) are just there  <br/>
for looks, to confuse you.  And each time whatever picture is next to  <br/>
9, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81 and 90 will be the same picture.   <br/>
The rest are probably lined up in ways that keep one from being right  <br/>
next to another.<br/>
<br/>
Scratch that, because I just looked and on this particular shuffle,  <br/>
11, 12 and 13 all have the same symbol.  That doesn&#39;t matter, because  <br/>
they&#39;re not going to be right answers.   I&#39;m going to go through the  <br/>
screens again.   Next time, they have different symbols.  So yeah,  <br/>
it&#39;s just for purposes of distraction and to make it seem magic.    <br/>
It&#39;s not that 9 is a jug or an arrow, it&#39;s that whatever 9 is is what  <br/>
the gopher will show you, and that will change each time you play.<br/>
