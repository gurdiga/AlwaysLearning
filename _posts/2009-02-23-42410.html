<div id="ygrps-yiv-1769576225">I want to acknowledge Joyce&#39;s work and thank her in a large group.   <br/>
This is a good one.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll very quietly does as much for unschooling as anyone  <br/>
ever has.  She&#39;s about to catch up with John Holt in terms of hours of  <br/>
thinking and writing.  She&#39;s passed him in direct experience long ago.<br/>
<br/>
What Joyce writes, many of you get to see.  When she writes here I&#39;m  <br/>
thrilled.   I love her page,<br/>
http://joyfullyrejoycing<br/>
and I&#39;m glad to know her.<br/>
<br/>
Because I know her in person, and because she&#39;s shy, I think I should  <br/>
let others know some things she does that benefit all of us here.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce lives two hours closer to the sunrise than I do (three hours  <br/>
closer than some other moderators), and she gets up early.  Every  <br/>
morning when I wake up, Joyce has already dealt with overnight pending  <br/>
posts on Always Learning, Unschooling Discussion and Unschooling.info/ <br/>
forum.   These resources work smoothly and well because of Joyce.  She  <br/>
does things that aren&#39;t fun and glorious, and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair  <br/>
that only a dozen of us have known this for so long.   She&#39;s not the  <br/>
only one who helps with the lists that way, but she does more than her  <br/>
share.  It doesn&#39;t show from this side, but every day there&#39;s junk  <br/>
that needs to be deleted, and way off-topic posts to return, and great  <br/>
posts from new members to be approved, and their memberships updated  <br/>
if they&#39;ve been on a while so the posts don&#39;t need to be moderated  <br/>
anymore.  Because Joyce does this, other people have more time to write.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s often the one who understands the programming and options of the  <br/>
sites well enough to help people who are having problems, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Joyce, very much, for the time and patience and knowledge  <br/>
you&#39;ve shared with so many people who didn&#39;t even know it!<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
Sandra<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-942995209">Thank you. I&#39;m blushing 2 hours away :-)<br/>
<br/>
But I must say that if I hadn&#39;t known Sandra was out there  <br/>
*scrutinizing* ideas on the AOL boards, and holding up and examining  <br/>
in public those words that missed the mark of clear thinking, I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near as clear in putting thoughts into words.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think someone else deserves credit for most of that! Though I will  <br/>
take credit for deleting a ton of spam from Unschooling.info ;-) (It  <br/>
isn&#39;t even good spam. I haven&#39;t seen a good one for months.)<br/>
