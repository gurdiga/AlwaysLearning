<div id="ygrps-yiv-175215214">My brother and sister in law know everything there is to know about kids<br/>
(they have none and are both Engineers in Silicon Valley working 80 hours a<br/>
week).  I&#39;m learning that it&#39;s not worth my energy to inform my family of<br/>
what we are doing.  They don&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; or want to &quot;get it&quot;.  They think we<br/>
are harming our kids by what we are doing and they won&#39;t be &quot;normal&quot; (thank<br/>
goodness, I say)....  I think when I spend a lot of time trying to convince<br/>
people that, whatever I&#39;m talking about, is the best way, the truth, the<br/>
real way, the only way etc etc, then I&#39;m really trying to convince myself<br/>
that I&#39;m ok with my own decisions about my belief systems.<br/>
<br/>
We told Zak that if we hit him he could hit us... That seemed fair to me.<br/>

Today the pro life ladies are marching in front of our county courthouse.<br/>
<br/>
In this conservative little town they&#39;re kind of preaching to the choir,<br/>
<br/>
but I suppose it makes them feel good.<br/>
<br/>
To totally change the subject, I have a continuing dialog, e-mail, with<br/>
<br/>
my brother about spanking. He&#39;s expressing his idea that his<br/>
<br/>
grandchildren need more discipline. His words. By discipline he means<br/>
<br/>
they should get a swat or a full blown spanking when they do something he<br/>
<br/>
doesn&#39;t like.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m feeling a little ill over his latest correspondence and wondering if<br/>
<br/>
I can ever reach him or if I should continue to try. I almost posted his<br/>
<br/>
e-mail here to let you all read it, then decided I didn&#39;t want to be<br/>
<br/>
responsible for all the disgust it would cause.<br/>
<br/>
Have any of you ever seen someone like this have a change of heart? Is<br/>
<br/>
it worth the energy?<br/>
