<div id="ygrps-yiv-1885868921">&lt;&lt;homosexual men almost never had a good relationship with their fathers&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You seem to be implying that correlation equals causation.  It is just as<br/>
likely that the fathers&#39; distant relationship with their sons was the result<br/>
of the fathers&#39; inability to accept traits and behaviors in their sons that<br/>
are perceived as feminine.  Not that the distant relationships caused the<br/>
feminine traits.<br/>
<br/>
Julie--who believes in the significant biological role of homosexuality and<br/>
even anti-social behavior</div>
