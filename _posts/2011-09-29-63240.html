<div id="ygrps-yiv-675973929">Someone wrote Joyce a long thank-you note, Joyce shared it with me because my name was in it, I wrote to the author to ask if I could quote it on my Joyce page, and she said yes.<br/>

If you also think Joyce is cool and might like to hang out with her for a few days, please consider asking for this for Christmas (or winter-holiday of your preference, or birthday, or something):<br/>

Bonus gift opportunities:  Deb Lewis, Jill Parmer, Pam Sorooshian, Rosie her daughter, me and Holly and Marty.<br/>
<br/>
Renting the hotel rooms gets us the meeting rooms (or Keith will pay for them; that&#39;s what I asked for for Christmas--financial backing in case of shortfall), and paying the conference fee gets transportation for speakers, and supplies and snacks for attendees.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you live where winter isn&#39;t very cold or fun, and coming to Albuquerque you might get a little taste of cold (possibly even desert snow; if it snows early in the week, it will melt before you leave), and if you live where winter is very cold, you can come and get a not-so-cold very-sunny break from winter.<br/>
