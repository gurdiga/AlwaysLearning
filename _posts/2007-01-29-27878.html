<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190218752">Okay, good. Yesterday, I started to hear the arguments for paedophilia<br/>
(and there are some) in my head, the arguments of those who think it&#39;s<br/>
often okay and right for children of all ages to be fully sexually<br/>
active - not from watching crime shows either, btw, and I got really<br/>
angry and wanted to stop the &quot;what if she consented&quot; business in it&#39;s<br/>
tracks... Which is not where you were coming from, I know. I&#39;m sorry<br/>
that my last post on the topic was quite rude, Crystal. It wasn&#39;t<br/>
about you.<br/>
<br/>
Although I have only a good laypersons understanding of all this,<br/>
every fibre of my being was screaming on behalf of children who<br/>
allegedly consented to things they couldn&#39;t possibly have had a full<br/>
understanding of - and I don&#39;t mean to underestimate what children are<br/>
often capable of (sex aside, I think) when I say that. <br/>
<br/>
I simply could not see the child you&#39;ve described Sorscha to be<br/>
actively consenting to anything really sexual, and wasn&#39;t sure if<br/>
that&#39;s where your question, the one I isolated, was going. In my head<br/>
I saw it horribly misused, if ever answered in the affirmative.<br/>
<br/>
I apologise for not keeping a cool head. <br/>
