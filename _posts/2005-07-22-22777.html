<div id="ygrps-yiv-146926307">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I have just read Joyce&#39;s post which I found really useful.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering how the rest of you deal with interaction with the state and to what extent you feel value in trying to change &quot;the system.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Joyce said:<br/>
Basically this list is for people who want the ideas of how to build a relationship with their kids...<br/>
<br/>
so far so good - I can work on this in my own home and in my own relationships<br/>
<br/>
and then she said:<br/>
who don&#39;t want to do things that will tear the relationship down.<br/>
<br/>
Here in New Zealand I still feel the threat of state compulsion hanging over me from time to time which dampens my ability to truly unschool. I also find my children&#39;s choices hampered by impositions of petty rules imposed by the state.  <br/>
<br/>
For example, if my children want to gain qualifications for tertiary study they must either go to school or we must fund them to use a correspondence course at a price 10 times higher than that charged to persons above compulsory age or in schools which can&#39;t provide the subjects.  To what extent do others feel a need to enter into dialogue with the state and political parties either to gain incremental improvements or to lobby for the removal of compulsion.<br/>
<br/>
I tend toward trying to gain the incremental improvements in the short term but I am not sure if I have the courage time or ability to lobby for the really major changes - removal of compulsion - which I feelis needed before families can have true choice.<br/>
<br/>
Interested in how others have taking this moving from the personal to the political.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
