<div id="ygrps-yiv-309179793">I have a blog that&#39;s just for announcements of changes to my  <br/>
unschooling pages.  Some of the newer readers might not know about  <br/>
it. I just put up a new post, but there might be several recent that  <br/>
various of you could be interested in.  There&#39;s also a yahoo list for  <br/>
announcements for those who prefer e-mail.  I send the same  <br/>
announcements to both.  It&#39;s linked on the main unschooling page.<br/>

It will be prettier if you click the link above.   There’s a beatiful image by Lydia Koltai there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-787927711">A couple of these aren’t so new, but hadn’t been announced.  Jo Isaac and her data on the ages unschoolers learn to read have been there a while, but for those who didn’t know, have fun!  <br/>
<br/>
There is a beautiful photo there by Hannah North.  And the page on Light and Lightness is linked from today’s Just Add Light and Stir (Thursday, January 4).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Each link there leads to another three or more other pages.  Full screens are better than phones for most of these.<br/>
<br/>
Investing time in more solid knowledge of unschooling will help you in ways you probably can’t consider yet. :-)<br/>

When you’re at that blog, maybe subscribe. I don’t bring all the links here, but I am lately, for requests that this group be revitalized. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Also maybe poke around the randomizer, because you might see either a page you havn’t seen, or one that will look different now, with your and better understandings.<br/>

One thing you might’ve known, but probably not all three. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Consider subscribing to that blog, and playing with the randomizer, so you can find more things you might have forgotten, or missed!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-364579474">Yahoogroups…. not so lively. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The last thing I posted was a site-announcement link and here is another one.  This one came from a quote I used in Just Add Light.  I linked to the cake page.  Caren Knox (dharmamama, maybe, in this group and some such places) sent another link to go with it, and  I made a page of it.  While looking for a place to upload photos for that, I found another page I had forgotten I had!!!<br/>
<br/>
So. <br/>
<br/>
Cake.  The theme is cake.  But not just cake itself.  Lots of ideas, connections—to Spartacus, to the Peace Corps, to a vineyard in Colorado, to Africa, to medieval books, to everybody’s birthday, to Korea and….   well, you know how it goes.   There’s some new stuff:<br/>
