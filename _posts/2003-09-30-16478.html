&gt; The mistake I&#39;ve often made, is that I assume that people who&#39;s bodies are<br/>
grown are adults.  Actually, most people walking around are little kids<br/>
acting as if they are adults.  The only way I&#39;ve found to remain at peace in<br/>
the midst of such &quot;sleeping&quot; people is to adopt the same attitude with them<br/>
that I do with my children.  I strive to offer them the full welcome.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The &quot;welcoming response&quot; is the one most people give their children when<br/>
they are learning to walk and talk:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    FULL ENCOURAGEMENT<br/>
&gt;    MUTUAL ENJOYMENT<br/>
&gt;    NO MISTAKES - Falling down is part of the process<br/>
&gt;    NO JUDGMENT - As they learn to walk we don&#39;t say, &quot;You walk funny&quot; or<br/>
label them as &quot;clumsy.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    INNER MOTIVATION - They want to learn.  They have a strong innate<br/>
desire to grow in skill.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    WE ARE NOT DELIBERATELY TEACHING THEM - They learn from our model.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    WE TAKE CUES FROM THE CHILD - We don&#39;t try to force them to walk before<br/>
they are ready.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    NO EXTERNAL REWARDS ARE NECESSARY - Learning and accomplishing are<br/>
their own reward.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    SUPPORT AND COMFORT ARE READILY AVAILABLE<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    FULL EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS - Barring disability, we have no doubt that<br/>
they will learn to walk and talk.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    BELIEF THAT CHILDREN ARE SELF CORRECTING - If a child says a word<br/>
incorrectly, we have no doubt that they will eventually learn the correct<br/>
work.  We even enjoy the mispronouncing and think it is cute.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My dd&#39;s creations have lived on: &quot;floaty delvation&quot; (flotation device),<br/>
&quot;kitty chasm&quot; (catechism).  Don&#39;t you all remember your children&#39;s?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Anyway, this welcoming is quite irresistible.  I&#39;m convinced that it&#39;s<br/>
what everyone is looking for in life.  Almost everyone loses their full<br/>
welcome before age 5, half at toilet training &quot;time.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But what it is, it&#39;s an open heart that trusts life.  Anyone who unschools<br/>
already does this, we just need to extend it to all those &quot;grown ups&quot; in<br/>
disguise.  Since I began doing that, I&#39;ve witnessed really hard core people<br/>
change before my eyes.  For instance, my mom, the know-it-all kill-joy of<br/>
the 20th century, starting saying really tender things to me like, &quot;I really<br/>
like the way you look at me&quot; because I was radiating the tenderness that I<br/>
always wanted from her.  It&#39;s also what she always wanted.  Neither of us<br/>
experienced it as long as I was trying to get it from her.  Once I<br/>
discovered my own capacity to give it under any circumstances, she began to<br/>
reflect it back to me.  I&#39;m so happy - she&#39;s 83 and I don&#39;t know if she&#39;ll<br/>
make it another year.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Trying to convince anyone of anything is usually futile, because it&#39;s a<br/>
natural law of physics that any force creates its own counterforce.  But an<br/>
open, tender invitation is irresistable.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Fondly,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Retta<br/>
