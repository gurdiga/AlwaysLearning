<div id="ygrps-yiv-806253177">Once a year (most years, not all) I report my expenses and ask people to help.<br/>
There are other ways to help that don’t involve money, too.<br/>
<br/>
Details are here:<br/>

<br/>
One of the requests is to post in discussions such as this one!  I know many people have moved to facebook for their philosophical discussions, but I really like this group, and I hope some (LOTS!) of you will help keep it vibrant. <br/>
<br/>
That’s all.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

Keith and I have joked (but it’s really not a joke, so I should say that we have gently comforted ourselves with…) that just by going to work and letting me write, and travel, he was helping change the world.<br/>
<br/>
Had I been surrounded by people who discouraged or shamed me for my odd hobby, things would be different in more families than mine.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all the kind thoughts and words.<br/>

It’s not consistently annual, but it’s not more than once a year.  (Is there a word for inconsistency sort of annual?  Probably not a nice word. :-) )<br/>
