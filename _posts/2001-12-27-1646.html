I love your response to the &quot;what kind of insect&quot; issue.<br/>
We don&#39;t need to be walking encyclopedia&#39;s to be effective unschoolers. We do <br/>
however, need to have the burning desire and curiosity that Pam mentioned.<br/>
It&#39;s so cool to see how it all flows together, this thing of natural learning <br/>
(for lack of a better phrase)...you see a bug you don&#39;t recognize, everyone <br/>
questions it. Later, back at the ranch, you see it on PBS and WHAMMO, a <br/>
learning moment hits you between the eyes...or not.<br/>
Depends on the person as to how this all unfolds. Maybe the parent that has <br/>
the pat answer can actually close doors sometimes.<br/>
After all, it&#39;s knowing the questions, not the answers that counts.<br/>
