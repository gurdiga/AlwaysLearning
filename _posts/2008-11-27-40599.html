<div id="ygrps-yiv-690777258">Last week I noticed on Sandra&#39;s blog that it had a &quot;rating&quot; and it  <br/>
reminded me of a documentary I enjoyed called This Film Is Not Yet  <br/>
Rated, which is all about the MPAA and how they rate movies. The  <br/>
members of the group that rate the movies are supposed to be secret,  <br/>
and their process is highly subjective and the movie shows how the  <br/>
standards have changed over the years. Pretty interesting stuff.<br/>

My main unschooling page got a G rating and my page on sexuality and  <br/>
teens got NR (no one under 17).<br/>
<br/>
That was fun to play with.  It&#39;s not &quot;real,&quot; as far as a I know, but  <br/>
those with blogs or webpages who want to play with it can find the  <br/>
link in the upper right (if you&#39;re reading this in November 2008,  <br/>
anyway; it won&#39;t stay there forever) at<br/>
