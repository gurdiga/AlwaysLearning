<div id="ygrps-yiv-198181423">I&#39;ve been working on my as-yet-small page on music, and would like  <br/>
other links or ideas to consider.  I&#39;m hoping for it to be simple,  <br/>
fun and not intimidating for non-musicians, and to connect music to  <br/>
other things.  I dont want it to try to be everything to anyone,  <br/>
because anyone wanting to search out music resource online can pretty  <br/>
easily do so.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe accounts of how unschoolers have &quot;done music&quot; or stories of how  <br/>
music has unexpectedly led to other things (or arisen out of other  <br/>
interests) would be cool.  And if anyone knows of other religious- <br/>
MIDI sites, that would be good too.  Not other Christian or Jewish  <br/>
sites, but music of other religious cultures.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
