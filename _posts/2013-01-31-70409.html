<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938915406">My husband has an illness that may lead to him passing away while our children are young. They are 5 and 1 currently. <br/>
<br/>
I am wondering what things might help for me to know or do, if that happens, to make the experience of him passing away better than it would be otherwise for our children. It is likely that our finances would remain similar to how they are now, and we would still be able to unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1316141217">I am sorry. <br/>
<br/>
I would not focus on the experience of passing but in living now, everyday!<br/>
<br/>
Make memories And be in the moment. Live with him and the kids as joyfully as you can. Make lots of movies with him and the kids.<br/>
<br/>
My brother passed away when his kids were very very young and the videos are all they have and are hugely  cherished by his now grown children.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t prepare for death. Live life now. None of us ever knows when we will die  so make today a beautiful day and enjoy happily with him and the children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-740651282">Videos and photos are a great idea.  Maybe letters from him too?  My mom died when I was 4.  I was particularly sad about it in my teen years, I&#39;m not so much anymore.  But in my childhood and teen years, I loved looking at photos of her, especially photos of the two of us together.  Knowing I had a mom who loved me, like other kids did, even though she wasn&#39;t there anymore.  I remember in my 20s, my uncle unearthed a video of her dancing--awkwardly and joyfully.  I had never before seen how she moved, what it was like when she smiled (or I had no memory of it).  We&#39;d only had photos.  I loved seeing bits of her handwriting too.<br/>

Your husband could write letters for your children to read at special moments in their life (when they&#39;re about to marry, when they turn 18 etc.) I read that somewhere (maybe in Stephen Covey&#39;s book?) and I found that a fantastic idea. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-159688022">I am sorry to hear about your husband&#39;s illness...<br/>
<br/>
I feel you may look at focussing on togetherness and staying<br/>
close and doing stuff and creating joyous memories around him...<br/>
<br/>
I also feel perhaps you may try and see if and when the children ask about<br/>
illness and death then whether it is possible to speak about it<br/>
together along with your husband...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you and your husband could have a private conversation about whether<br/>
he would like to talk about it if the children wished to hear it form<br/>
him..However I feel you might need to be sensitive to what he really needs<br/>
and wants....so maybe not to pressurize him either if he is not ready..<br/>
<br/>
I remember the film Step Mom and how the character in the film made that<br/>
quilt with snapshots of all of them together...all memories woven in...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you and your family could create memories that will keep him alive in<br/>
their lives even when he is<br/>
gone. Stories about him..videos, writings maybe written in his<br/>
handwriting...photos etc...<br/>
<br/>
You may even see if extended family like grandparents, aunts and uncles are<br/>
willing to leave letters or writings or photos of his with you....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000094590">Thank you for your suggestions. I have begun taking more videos, and am thinking about the other suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
I have not mentioned to our daughter (age 5) the possibility of him passing away. I thought if I did, she might worry about it, but not be able to prepare for it, so there&#39;d be no benefit, maybe, and possible harm. Perhaps I was wrong to think she wouldn&#39;t benefit from knowing about it ahead of time? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1724502726">It&#39;s very easy to go about your life & forget that death is an inhere part<br/>
of life. I think it&#39;s unfair to pretend it doesn&#39;t exist, even in families<br/>
without illness.<br/>
My husband died 12 years ago, almost three years after a brain tumor<br/>
diagnosis, when my kids were 4 & 2.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744581729">Whoops! Hit send way too soon!!<br/>
<br/>
We did, at first take the well-intentioned though misled advice to keep<br/>
Hannah out of the loop.  Our secrecy and lack of clear explanation for life<br/>
changes (time away from us while we visit doctors) was very confusing. Once<br/>
we began speaking clearly and matter-of-fact, we were all much calmer.<br/>
Mitch was incredibly funny and had a wonderful way of making even horrible,<br/>
scary situations funny and comfortable. We laughed a lot. We made memories.<br/>
Lots of fun, happy memories. Picnics in the livingroom. Water balloon<br/>
fights.<br/>
Hayden was born when Mitch finished chemo, so his entire 27 months with his<br/>
dad was Brain Tumor & impending death.<br/>
My kids were very calm about their dad&#39;s death, because we&#39;d talked about<br/>
it so much. In fact, Hannah 4, asked for a new dad on our way from Mitch&#39;s<br/>
2nd funeral (in front of MIL -- giggle-able now, I was pretty mortified!) I<br/>
knew we&#39;d done well in our prep :)<br/>
12 years on, Hayden is 14.5 and has no actual memories of his dad, though<br/>
he says he remembers the feeling of wrestling with him. He knows stories, I<br/>
do my best to ensure he knows as much about his dad as I can provide. We<br/>
have pictures up & out, ones with great stories :)<br/>
If there&#39;s anything (not unschooling specific) I can help you with, feel<br/>
free to contact me off list &lt;3<br/>
