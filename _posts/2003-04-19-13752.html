Geeze, Sandra. You could make a living doing hair. It&#39;s amazing. I <br/>
cut my girls&#39; hair too...straight across the bangs and straight across <br/>
the back! I had to show them how cool it was and Elysia, the 5 yr old, <br/>
saw Holly&#39;s collection of My Little Ponies in the background. She liked <br/>
Holly&#39;s hair but was REALLY impressed with so many little ponies. So if <br/>
Holly&#39;s ever looking for a buyer... HeidiC.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, but Holly would have to be standing there pointing and telling me <br/>
what to cut while I said &quot;Are you sure?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those Ponies came from thrift stores, except for the few her cousin, Gina, <br/>
gave her.  Gina has a big collection, and is old enough to have gotten some <br/>
new, so she has some of the cardboard backings and that is Information.   <br/>
Gina used to have a whole Pony culture in her room.  As a new pony showed up, <br/>
it went to the audience chamber where it stayed with the queen of the ponies <br/>
and the other important pony-ages (personage?  ponitude?) and at some point <br/>
it was sent to meet other ponies and find a home.  They all had elaborate <br/>
braiding jobs.<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes to curl hers with curlers, leave them on the deck to dry, and <br/>
such.<br/>
<br/>
Back to hair!  Maybe Holly will do hair. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She got to help braid a horse&#39;s mane once.  Ribbons and all.<br/>
<br/>
The horse rolled around in the dirt that night.  I got to help her fix the <br/>
mess the next day.  She was having way more fun than I was.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;ll just do her own kids&#39; hair, though, and their dolls and ponies <br/>
and her friends&#39; horses!<br/>

a VERY cool one!  HeidiC.<br/>
