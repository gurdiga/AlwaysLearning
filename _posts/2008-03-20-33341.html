<div id="ygrps-yiv-137302104">This is a bit long. Going to start w/ two examples of the inflexible  <br/>
pattern Kathrynn has going on, and then talk about it a bit. Would  <br/>
appreciate feedback and suggestions. J<br/>
<br/>
Kathrynn (5) is playing w/ kids, they are going to play a knight and  <br/>
dragon kinda game. She is dressed as a knight. One of her friends is  <br/>
dressed as a dragon, but doesn’t want to put the wings on. K is upset  <br/>
bc her friend does not want to be a flying dragon, and thinks she HAS  <br/>
to be a flying dragon for the game. We try to problem solve,  <br/>
empathyze, but in the end K is very mad and angry, upset and yelling,  <br/>
bc the other child will not put the wings on to make her a flying  <br/>
dragon. K tells me to make the other child put on the wings, or take  <br/>
the costume off the other girl so that I can be a flying dragon. I  <br/>
offer to be a flying dragon w/ just the wings. K continues to sob and  <br/>
yell at me to take the costome from the girl, or force her to wear  <br/>
the wings. Luckily, the other kids decide to eat some lunch, then the  <br/>
other girl decides to take off the costume, possibly bc she is tired  <br/>
of hearing K in the other room sob about it and say “mean” things.<br/>
<br/>
Later, they are playing knights again. Another boy also wants to be a  <br/>
knight. We differentiate and make them two different kinds of  <br/>
knights. K insists that she is the only Knight. No one else is ok  <br/>
with her idea. She will not yield, and is sobbing and being “mean”.   <br/>
I suggest we go outside and look for signs of Spring. This wokrs.  <br/>
Issue remains.<br/>
<br/>
Later, they are on my friends bed. Half are playing mud fight (pillow  <br/>
fight) and K wants to lay on the bed w/o kids jumping on it. I  <br/>
suggest that K can move to another bed. She refuses. She tells  <br/>
everyone they have to get off the bed. Other kids are not ok with  <br/>
that. I remind her that we’ve talked about if she needs some alone  <br/>
time, she can find a space to her self, but asking everyone else to  <br/>
leave a space so that she can have alone time may not work.  Somehow  <br/>
that situation gets resolved.<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the day, it is more and more apparent that the kids are  <br/>
getting tired of kathrynn’s grumpy responses. They don’t understand  <br/>
it, and they are starting to feel a bit uncomfortable about it.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked w/ K about flexibility,  A LOT. About how being  <br/>
inflexible ultimately affects her and her friends. I have  <br/>
brainstormed alternatives, solutions, empathized, held the space,  <br/>
used shere patience of waiting. I feel we are stuck in something, and  <br/>
I am mostly thinking it is bc she is going through a major  <br/>
developmental stage.<br/>
In the mean time, do I keep her home? She is extremely social and  <br/>
loves to be with her friends. And yet is having a hard time working  <br/>
with the flow of being w/ her friends.<br/>
<br/>
I know the pattern for her- she sets up a vision of what she wants.  <br/>
She has always been this way.She sees a game (or something) happening  <br/>
in one way. And then she expects and demands that it go that way.   <br/>
When it does not, she ultimately feels disempowered, to a certain  <br/>
extent. And it can spiral from there. She ebbs and flows in how she  <br/>
manages this pattern. Sometimes she is able to be more flexible and  <br/>
fluid. But lately it is just painful for me to be a part of- I see my  <br/>
friend cringe. I see the other kids cringe. I see kathrynn feeling  <br/>
pain and frustration and anger.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028070987">-=-In the mean time, do I keep her home? She is extremely social and<br/>
loves to be with her friends. And yet is having a hard time working<br/>

<br/>
Can you find a few-years-older kid to play with her at your house,  <br/>
maybe?  In a park or other public places?  You might find a kid who&#39;d  <br/>
like some time away from her own home, or you might pay a few dollars  <br/>
an hour as a &quot;mother&#39;s helper&quot; (not babysitter; you&#39;d be there too,  <br/>
nearby).  You could tell the older kid what the problem is, and they  <br/>
could &quot;just play,&quot; but the older child could maybe reason with her  <br/>
about sharing.  If she hears it from another young person, it might  <br/>
sink in more and make a different kind of sense.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten friends of mine to talk to my kids from time to time over  <br/>
they years when my own message was being misunderstood or  <br/>
disregarded.  Even now with them big sometimes I&#39;ve asked another  <br/>
slightly older friend of theirs to see if they could address or check  <br/>
out some issue, or make peace between my kids about something or  <br/>
other.  It&#39;s subtle but really effective, and the friends I ask like  <br/>
the challenge and the responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to think of examples.   Holly was crowding Marty,  <br/>
socially, and when they were going to go to a restaurant and then to  <br/>
hang around with a group of 8 or 10, I asked one of them who knew  <br/>
everyone well to try to help Marty have space without Holly in it.   <br/>
It involved seating considerations and distraction or subtle removal  <br/>
of Holly, when they were in a house with different rooms, and I don&#39;t  <br/>
think Holly even knew.<br/>
<br/>
It happens with adults sometimes.  When there&#39;s a party or social- <br/>
something, if some of us know that one person is irritated with or  <br/>
tired of another one, to avoid frustration or sharpness, we&#39;ll try to  <br/>
arrange to have them in separate places, both happy, at least one of  <br/>
them unaware of the machinations.  And if they end up looking like  <br/>
they&#39;re about to be alone in a room or elbowed up at the food table,  <br/>
someone who&#39;s on the jolly-and-prevention team (I just made that up,  <br/>
I&#39;ve  never written about this before) will scoot up and be like a  <br/>
safety officer, making sure they each have what they need without  <br/>
having to either converse with or ignore each other.<br/>
<br/>
Done well, that never, ever shows.<br/>
<br/>
It can be done with kids too.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When it does not, she ultimately feels disempowered, to a certain<br/>
extent. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Disempowered&quot; from controlling others?  That&#39;s probably good and  <br/>
healthy.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But lately it is just painful for me to be a part of- I see my<br/>
friend cringe. I see the other kids cringe. I see kathrynn feeling<br/>
pain and frustration and anger.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Then get her out of there sooner.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t tell just what kind of social thing lasted all day but it  <br/>
seems too long for her (and probably seemed WAY too long to the other  <br/>
kids if they were having to move to avoid or defend.<br/>
<br/>
Once Holly was in a tacky, controlling, negative mood and it was  <br/>
Marty&#39;s birthday.  I told her she was not going to mess up Marty&#39;s  <br/>
party, and she needed to figure out a way to get cheerful and nice,  <br/>
or stay in her room, or we&#39;d have to remove her from the house.  If  <br/>
she wanted to be at Marty&#39;s party she had to help us make it special  <br/>
for Marty.<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve called an adult or teen friend to extricate her from the  <br/>
property if she&#39;s kept on as she was.  I&#39;m Marty&#39;s mom too, and  <br/>
birthdays are not to be ruined at our house.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Have you practiced breathing and calming with her?  If you&#39;ve ever  <br/>
done any meditation, think the breathing benefits of that, but it can  <br/>
be done anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
It might help her to use my &quot;make the better choice&quot; idea that&#39;s  <br/>
written up here and there and you could listen to it here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/peacefullyparenting">http://sandradodd.com/peacefullyparenting</a> (at the bottom).  If she  <br/>
acts without thinking first, she&#39;s just barreling wrecklessly along.   <br/>
If she thinks and decides what to do, she&#39;ll be better right away.   <br/>
And then when you talk to her you could ask &quot;Was the the best think  <br/>
you thought to say?&quot; (or do)   and you could ask her what other thing  <br/>
she considered before she made that decision.<br/>
<br/>
If she gets angry about you expecting her to think before she talks  <br/>
or acts, you could tell her you&#39;d rather not take her to such social  <br/>
situations if she thinks it&#39;s okay to do whatever she wants all the  <br/>
time without even thinking about what&#39;s kind and good.<br/>

I have no suggestions. Just empathy. I have been through situations that<br/>
mirror yours on a regular basis with my youngest who is 4 and has always<br/>
demanded her way. Especially with her OLDER sister. Just today we had an<br/>
issue where Marti (7) was trying to get out of her bedroom and Lilly<br/>
wouldn&#39;t let her out. When Marti would try, Lilly would hit her.<br/>
<br/>
In honesty, I didn&#39;t intervene in time and take complete responsibility for<br/>
what happened. What I did do was remove Lil from the scene. She went<br/>
downstairs. I followed, but I didn&#39;t talk to her about it, or pay her much<br/>
attention until she was calm (Daddy had yelled at her and she was crying.<br/>
Probably partially because she was mad at daddy for yelling and partially<br/>
because she was sorry for hitting her sister). Then, when she was calm it<br/>
was &quot;It&#39;s time to go and get dressed because we have to take daddy to work<br/>
soon.&quot; I figure, she already knows that it isn&#39;t okay to hit her sister. She<br/>
didn&#39;t know how else to get her way in the moment.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-662986894">Hi Amanda--<br/>
<br/>
These times can be so volatile in the moment, but when things quiet down enough to talk, <br/>
I&#39;ve found that helping them to make amends can go a long way.  You didn&#39;t say if there <br/>
was any resolution between your two girls--just the distraction part, so I&#39;m writing about <br/>
what that would look like in my house.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;and partially because she was sorry for hitting her sister&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I worked out the apology thing a long time ago, because there is some conventional <br/>
(wisdom) that says not to &quot;make&quot; kids apologize.  That confused me, because what should <br/>
happen when someone has &quot;wronged&quot; another?  I think that wisdom is around to avoid the <br/>
ugliness of a forced apology, but it has taken over and confused parents about what a <br/>
heartfelt acceptance of responsibility and a healing acceptance of apology can look like.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what it looks like for us:  I will talk with the hurt child first and make sure they are <br/>
o.k.--even better when there&#39;s another parent there do comfort the hurt one.  Then I <br/>
focus on the one who did the hurting, empathize, let them tell their story, and then as <br/>
things cool down and they feel understood I will begin to interject the voice of the other <br/>
side.  At some point here the &quot;offender&quot; will begin to feel sorry that the situation got out of <br/>
control, and I will ask if they are ready to apologize--and at this point it is sincere and <br/>
totally coming from them.  I just facilitate the communication.  If they are too embarrassed <br/>
to speak, which is happening lately with my daughter, then we both go and I do the <br/>
speaking.  And the connection that happens frequently makes the relationship better than <br/>
before.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry if this is obvious to many of you--but it wasn&#39;t to me when my children were <br/>
littler and I had some friends that felt strongly that their kids &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot; apologize, which <br/>
is what is has become in some circles.  I was very confused because I could feel the <br/>
unfinished business hanging in the air, between both children, and often the problem <br/>
would then come up over and over because it hadn&#39;t been really resolved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988121200">&lt;&lt;I feel we are stuck in something, and  <br/>
I am mostly thinking it is bc she is going through a major  <br/>
developmental stage.<br/>

loves to be with her friends. And yet is having a hard time working  <br/>
with the flow of being w/ her friends.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new here and still learning, but I wanted to respond to this as I have been reading a lot about 5 yr. development and I have a daughter who seems quite similiar to yours.    <br/>
<br/>
I have found success in increasing the amount of time I spend playing with her at home.  I play the parts she wants me to and generally do as she wants when we are playing.  It seems to me that if she gets a lot of opportunities to &quot;be in charge&quot; at home, she is a little more flexible at the park or other environments where she is playing with other kids.  I have also tried to play with her and her brother when they are playing these types of games and I sort of work through the problems with them while we are playing (sometimes talking about what&#39;s happening (they both want a specific magic wand, brother does not want to be the knight, etc.) in my mean dragon voice, or singing it to them if we are playing dancing princesses, etc.).  She tends to be more responsive if she thinks I&#39;m playing rather than reprimanding her. (got this idea from Sandra&#39;s writings about helping kids/siblings with conflict and helping them to &quot;save face&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve also been trying to explain to her what the other kids are feeling (sometimes in the moment-- sometimes after) without blaming her.  (I can&#39;t think of a good example) but, I try and get her thinking about what is going on with the other person and sometimes it&#39;s enough distraction from her own emotions about the situation, and she can more easily move on or help find a solution.  I don&#39;t say, &quot;look what you did&quot; or &quot;look how you made her feel&quot;  I just talk to her about what is going on and how I think everyone is feeling.  <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra, that this seems like a long day for everyone.  If you shorten the time she has to be with the other kids her success will increase and she will start to feel better about herself and these social situations.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that helps.<br/>

on the condition that she plays nicely, and be specific.  If she <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My oldest daughter was a visionary player like that, but she was <br/>
flexible.  All the kids wanted to play her games and play her ideas.  <br/>
Somehow there needs to be talking points within the game.  Perhaps <br/>
that is where you can help.  Help set up the game.  If your daughter <br/>
doesn&#39;t like the outcome, let her do something else and let the <br/>
others play.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was really young she knew a kid that played really <br/>
inflexible like that.  I always made other plans when that kids was <br/>
involved because I didn&#39;t want my daughter to have to deal with this <br/>
child.  I didn&#39;t like to see her ideas crushed over and over.  Other <br/>
kids that played with this kid didn&#39;t like it either, but went along <br/>
with it anyway.  I felt that it wasn&#39;t worth it and we could find <br/>
better kids to hang out with, ones that valued the way my daughter <br/>
played.</div>

My thought was that seeing a child wanting her way as a power struggle <br/>
would cause more harm than good at finding a solution to the problem, <br/>
which is really more about conflict resolution and navigating with <br/>
other people.  Those are really hard things for some kids, and some <br/>

<br/>
I guess we do something like that here, but what&#39;s in that top  <br/>
paragraph is clearer and better.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday Keith (my husband) said something about how I learn  <br/>
things in the yard like what happens if you leave the water on for  <br/>
three days.  I said &quot;I have NEVER left the water on for three days,&quot;  <br/>
and as I was saying it, knowing it was true, I also knew that I  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to just be argumentative, and that he has MANY times  <br/>
turned water off that I&#39;d left on for hours, so I added smoothly,  <br/>
&quot;...thanks to you.&quot;  And so we both smiled and what could have been a  <br/>
comment and a defense and an insult and another insult turned into a  <br/>
&quot;we&#39;re partners; thank you&quot; kind of moment.    So I guess that was a  <br/>
little like commenting from within the game.<br/>

True, but they can&#39;t all get themselves out of rough situations on  <br/>
their own, and shouldn&#39;t have to.  Whether Kirby says sorry or not,  <br/>
it&#39;s not okay for him to bully Marty or Holly.  I&#39;m more concerned  <br/>

about whether there&#39;s any apology.<br/>

And you don&#39;t find that your older daughter or any of your younger daughter&#39;s friends <br/>
hold on to the bad feelings longer, or that the patterns play out again?  That&#39;s what I have <br/>
found to be almost universal to our experience (which of course doesn&#39;t mean universal <br/>
experience).<br/>
<br/>
&quot; I think people come to terms with mistakes in their own ways.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone could argue with that.  But that&#39;s only 1/2 of the equation.  I have <br/>
found, depending on the situation and personalities involved, that the relationships suffer, <br/>
and that that ends up hurting my children because their friend is mad at them.  <br/>
Sometimes it is more difficult than others, and it takes more empathy toward them when <br/>
they are feeling more stuck in the emotion, to help them to create a shift, but the rewards <br/>
are always worth it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;or cry about it later because she feels guilty&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Those are the feelings that need a place to go.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You know, I used to think that my girls needed to make amends too&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When we are in the mode of working through a problem, it isn&#39;t my goal to make amends-<br/>
-my primary goal is to help my kids get emotionally unstuck.  This part can look like many <br/>
different things--silently sitting beside them, holding them, leaving them alone until they <br/>
feel ready, talking them down.  The amends part comes in much later, and is a natural <br/>
extension of their healing and wanting to rejoin their society.  The guilt is transformed into <br/>
understanding and reconnection, and their hearts open back up.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter was just involved in a situation in which she became embarrassed about her <br/>
new feelings for a boy with her friends.  She brought the subject up, but then became <br/>
certain that a friend had told her secret to another friend and got really angry.  It was <br/>
immediately apparent to all concerned that that hadn&#39;t happened, but she got locked into <br/>
her tangle of emotions and froze up.  She didn&#39;t know what to do, so she continued to say <br/>
she was mad and wouldn&#39;t talk to the friend.  It was an ongoing drama at the park all that <br/>
day.  She wouldn&#39;t talk to me or anyone else--was just miserable and angry.  The friend <br/>
then started to get angry back and things began to get ugly.  We all ended up at a mutual <br/>
friend&#39;s house as we had already planned a sleepover (visiting another city), so the drama <br/>
was continuing with feelings mounting.  When I was finally able to converse with my dd, I <br/>
guessed how she was feeling.  Yep, she was hugely embarrassed at the drama she&#39;d <br/>
caused and didn&#39;t know how to get out of it.  One simple conversation later, with me <br/>
explaining to her friend, her standing there, and all was resolved and the four girls <br/>
involved all got along beautifully the rest of the night.<br/>
<br/>
A few days later we ended up in a similar situation with her friend being the one who got <br/>
stuck and didn&#39;t know how to get out of it.  She tried just playing with my daughter again, <br/>
but it didn&#39;t work.  Things were too awkward.  Until my daughter had some understanding <br/>
of what had happened, and the friend got to say her part, things just didn&#39;t feel right.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s a personality difference&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Is it a personality difference or just practice?<br/>

<br/>
In fact, I had to be the recipient of one of those recently.  Yuck!  My daughter and I <br/>
attended a school show of the Nutcracker.  The row of young boys behind us so clearly <br/>
didn&#39;t want to be there, but the had to be taught culture, so the class was there.  They <br/>
found something to do which was so much more fun than the show--kicking my <br/>
daughter&#39;s seat.  She asked me to talk to them, which I did very respectfully.  Then the <br/>
game changed to kicking both of our seats.  The chaperones were useless and it ruined <br/>
the second half for us.<br/>
<br/>
Afterward the chaperone marched the ringleader up to us and had him apologize.  It was <br/>
so uncomfortable for all of us, and I thought she should have been apologizing to him to <br/>
boot, for inflicting that torture upon him that set him up to misbehave.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ok, thanks for the clarity.  That is what we do here too.  I find <br/>
that my younger daughter takes a lot longer to deal with these things <br/>
than any person I&#39;ve ever met in my life.  Sometimes, days will go <br/>
by, and all of a sudden it will come up in deep remorse on her part <br/>
for something that she&#39;d done days before that often everyone had <br/>
already forgotten.  <br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t happen immediately, or hours later or anytime remotely soon <br/>
after.  There is no amount of coaxing or talking or trying to delve <br/>
deeper into it, that will make it better or happen sooner.<br/>
<br/>
I figure it&#39;s a learning curve sort of thing that will get better <br/>
with age and time and understanding.  It&#39;s not that we don&#39;t talk <br/>
about it or that I don&#39;t help the injured party feel better, it&#39;s <br/>
that I don&#39;t force any amending or apology that isn&#39;t going to happen <br/>
any time soon or happen with real feelings of in the moment sorrow. <br/>
<br/>
I have suggested that she apologize when she does feel that remorse, <br/>
since it does help it feel better to get it out.  Sometimes she does <br/>
and sometimes she doesn&#39;t.</div>

hard.  Sometimes, it just better to not go there again, for several <br/>
reasons, one being not having to feel deep remorse for it later.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s better to let it go and not dwell on something that a <br/>
child has done wrong, and focus on how to avoid it in the future.  <br/>
Sometimes, for some kids, that means a closure of some sorts, like <br/>
apologizing, and for some kids, it means walking away and doing <br/>
something different, putting that yucky stuff behind them.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-534243707">Pam--<br/>
<br/>
When you have &quot;wronged&quot; someone in your life--hubby, child, etc.--do you feel any <br/>
responsibility to apologize, or do you see it as optional?  That is the question that I&#39;ve <br/>
asked myself.  And why should it be any different because my children are young.  In <br/>
practice, this doesn&#39;t mean that I have an expectation that they will run around <br/>
apologizing for everything that is a perceived wrong, or even an expectation in any <br/>
particular moment, but I have an overall expectation that my kids will grow into the kind <br/>
of people that can learn from their mistakes, own up to them when appropriate and <br/>
graciously forgive others, when appropriate.  (I really liked your phrase &quot;graciously <br/>
forgiving.&quot;)  I know plenty of adults who can&#39;t do this.<br/>
<br/>
Like so many other words in our language, the word apology has a lot of baggage <br/>
attatched to it.  Everyone has that image of the forced apology--ugly.  That is not at all <br/>
what I&#39;m talking about.  I&#39;m talking about a place where feelings have been worked <br/>
through and my child is in a place of desiring reconciliation.  An apology can facilitate a <br/>
reconciliation.  There&#39;s no forcing--when given, it comes from their heart.  And if my child <br/>
has done something wrong to someone, they always want reconciliation.  So what I&#39;m really <br/>
talking about is my children going from being tied-up-in-knots back to a place where <br/>
their emotional energy is flowing again, and wanting to take that flow back into the <br/>
relationship.  It&#39;s always a choice to remain blocked--but I&#39;m helping my kids find ways to <br/>
unblock.  The result in my husband&#39;s family of the inability to unblock is that my MIL <br/>
hasn&#39;t spoken to her brother in 45 years, over something pretty minor.  I don&#39;t want to see <br/>
that pattern continued.<br/>
<br/>
Every time something happens and my kids reach that place, make an apology and find <br/>
acceptance of themselves and from the other person (even better) they realize that their <br/>
mistakes are o.k. and fixable and have more trust in themselves.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then get her out of there sooner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
this can happen immediately after getting together with friends, or<br/>
hours into play. <br/>
i did forceably remove her from the situation during one of those<br/>
episodes i originally wrote about. (i jsut remembered that)<br/>
i feel yuchy when i do that. i feel like i am being so forceful and<br/>
overstempingly powerful with her during those times (in the way that i<br/>
am the larger adult and can forceably move her at my will). perhaps i<br/>
need to change my own perspective on that.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -=-I have talked w/ K about flexibility,  A LOT. About how being<br/>
&gt; inflexible ultimately affects her and her friends. I have<br/>
&gt; brainstormed alternatives, solutions, empathized, held the space,<br/>
&gt; used shere patience of waiting. I feel we are stuck in something, and<br/>
&gt; I am mostly thinking it is bc she is going through a major<br/>
&gt; developmental stage.-=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have you practiced breathing and calming with her?  If you&#39;ve ever  <br/>
&gt; done any meditation, think the breathing benefits of that, but it can  <br/>
&gt; be done anywhere.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
she knows the techniques, but refuses to breath deeply during those<br/>
times. i model the behavior for her when i remember. i need to<br/>
remember to do it more. she knows of the skills, as we talk about them<br/>
when we are calm. but in the moment.... not happening.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It might help her to use my &quot;make the better choice&quot; idea that&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; written up here and there and you could listen to it here:<br/>
&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/peacefullyparenting">http://sandradodd.com/peacefullyparenting</a> (at the bottom).  If she  <br/>
&gt; acts without thinking first, she&#39;s just barreling wrecklessly along.   <br/>
&gt; If she thinks and decides what to do, she&#39;ll be better right away.   <br/>
&gt; And then when you talk to her you could ask &quot;Was the the best think  <br/>
&gt; you thought to say?&quot; (or do)   and you could ask her what other thing  <br/>
&gt; she considered before she made that decision.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If she gets angry about you expecting her to think before she talks  <br/>
&gt; or acts, you could tell her you&#39;d rather not take her to such social  <br/>
&gt; situations if she thinks it&#39;s okay to do whatever she wants all the  <br/>
&gt; time without even thinking about what&#39;s kind and good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i will hopefully be able to dive into this in the next couple days. <br/>
i especially like the last sentence. i have *told* her that we will<br/>
have to stop going places if she can not be flexible and kind. i tell<br/>
her that when we are in the situations. it feels like i am threatening<br/>
her when i say that, but i don&#39;t know what else to do. <br/>
<br/>
thanks so much for the time you took to write it all out. thanks to<br/>
others too.<br/>

When you have &quot;wronged&quot; someone in your life--hubby, child, etc.--do  <br/>
you feel any<br/>
responsibility to apologize, or do you see it as optional? That is  <br/>
the question that I&#39;ve<br/>
asked myself. -=-<br/>
<br/>
With over 1000 people on the list, let&#39;s address the group and not  <br/>
individuals when it&#39;s possible.<br/>
<br/>
The question as worded above isn&#39;t a good question.  It divides the  <br/>
world oddly.<br/>
<br/>
EVERYthing is optional but death.  Taxes?  Optional if prison is a  <br/>
better option.<br/>
<br/>
Buddhists say suffering isn&#39;t optional.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Responsibility&quot; has a target.  &quot;Responsible&quot; (answerable to) whom?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Responsibility to apologize&quot; doesn&#39;t sound clear to me.  I see  <br/>
benefits from apologies, on both sides, but there are other  <br/>
aspects.     Catholic doctrine has several levels:  Contrition,  <br/>
confession, and penance.  It&#39;s not enough to say &quot;sorry&quot; if there&#39;s  <br/>
no contrition.<br/>
<br/>
The act of apologizing, if it&#39;s sincere, is a humbling act, and  <br/>
humility is good for people.  There are very few opportunities for  <br/>
people to feel the emotional sense of humility.   Awe and wonder are  <br/>
close, but not the same.<br/>

If a person is not so sorry that an apology comes welling out  <br/>
naturally, I think it&#39;s too soon for an apology.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-66957008">Lisa, were you writing about my child?  How do you know her?? :)    In all seriousness, my child is now 13, but you described her to a T when she was 5.  We didn&#39;t do everything perfectly and there were times I was COMPLETELY frustrated.  Our whole family is SUPER flexible and this poor child was plopped right in the middle!  Here are some things I&#39;ve learned from her:<br/>
   <br/>
  * she is our barometer - she detects certain atmospheres and stresses that the rest of us miss until it&#39;s too late - then we are all stressed out - I&#39;ve learned to watch her more closely because when she gets inflexible, it&#39;s usually a pre-cursor to anxiety so I need to change something (go home if out, slow down our life, etc.)<br/>
   <br/>
  * that she might lose some friends through her inflexibility and that is a fact of life - not everyone is going to want to put up with it and invite her over; also that there were (are) some combination of friends that she could not blend with for very long.  I learned to make playdates with people who had kids that really liked my daughter and were pretty flexible themselves - so there weren&#39;t too many bosses!  :)  <br/>
   <br/>
  * her inflexibility is going to help her stand by her beliefs keep her dedicated to what she puts her mind to and fulfill her dreams<br/>
   <br/>
  * as she gets older, and matures emotionally, she is able to flex a lot more!  Now that she&#39;s a teen, she cares what others think of her and it has helped her to think outside of herself sometimes - it helps her get along with others.  However, there are some of her friends that have similar inflexible, bossy personalities and I limit how much time she spends with those friends just because it&#39;s too draining on her and taxing on the friendships.  These are great people-skills to learn because even as an adult I realize that there are people that I need to limit my time with, but don&#39;t want to completely ditch the relationship....I wish I had learned that at her age (it would&#39;ve kept me out of a lot of trouble!!).   <br/>
   <br/>
  Don&#39;t worry, as she grows so will her emotions and abilities.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Take care,<br/>
<br/>

  This is a bit long. Going to start w/ two examples of the inflexible <br/>
pattern Kathrynn has going on, and then talk about it a bit. Would <br/>
appreciate feedback and suggestions. J<br/>
<br/>
Kathrynn (5) is playing w/ kids, they are going to play a knight and <br/>
dragon kinda game. She is dressed as a knight. One of her friends is <br/>
dressed as a dragon, but doesnt want to put the wings on. K is upset <br/>
bc her friend does not want to be a flying dragon, and thinks she HAS <br/>
to be a flying dragon for the game. We try to problem solve, <br/>
empathyze, but in the end K is very mad and angry, upset and yelling, <br/>
bc the other child will not put the wings on to make her a flying <br/>
dragon. K tells me to make the other child put on the wings, or take <br/>
the costume off the other girl so that I can be a flying dragon. I <br/>
offer to be a flying dragon w/ just the wings. K continues to sob and <br/>
yell at me to take the costome from the girl, or force her to wear <br/>
the wings. Luckily, the other kids decide to eat some lunch, then the <br/>
other girl decides to take off the costume, possibly bc she is tired <br/>
of hearing K in the other room sob about it and say mean things.<br/>
<br/>
Later, they are playing knights again. Another boy also wants to be a <br/>
knight. We differentiate and make them two different kinds of <br/>
knights. K insists that she is the only Knight. No one else is ok <br/>
with her idea. She will not yield, and is sobbing and being mean. <br/>
I suggest we go outside and look for signs of Spring. This wokrs. <br/>
Issue remains.<br/>
<br/>
Later, they are on my friends bed. Half are playing mud fight (pillow <br/>
fight) and K wants to lay on the bed w/o kids jumping on it. I <br/>
suggest that K can move to another bed. She refuses. She tells <br/>
everyone they have to get off the bed. Other kids are not ok with <br/>
that. I remind her that weve talked about if she needs some alone <br/>
time, she can find a space to her self, but asking everyone else to <br/>
leave a space so that she can have alone time may not work. Somehow <br/>
that situation gets resolved.<br/>
<br/>
By the end of the day, it is more and more apparent that the kids are <br/>
getting tired of kathrynns grumpy responses. They dont understand <br/>
it, and they are starting to feel a bit uncomfortable about it.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked w/ K about flexibility, A LOT. About how being <br/>
inflexible ultimately affects her and her friends. I have <br/>
brainstormed alternatives, solutions, empathized, held the space, <br/>
used shere patience of waiting. I feel we are stuck in something, and <br/>
I am mostly thinking it is bc she is going through a major <br/>
developmental stage.<br/>
In the mean time, do I keep her home? She is extremely social and <br/>
loves to be with her friends. And yet is having a hard time working <br/>
with the flow of being w/ her friends.<br/>
<br/>
I know the pattern for her- she sets up a vision of what she wants. <br/>
She has always been this way.She sees a game (or something) happening <br/>
in one way. And then she expects and demands that it go that way. <br/>
When it does not, she ultimately feels disempowered, to a certain <br/>
extent. And it can spiral from there. She ebbs and flows in how she <br/>
manages this pattern. Sometimes she is able to be more flexible and <br/>
fluid. But lately it is just painful for me to be a part of- I see my <br/>
friend cringe. I see the other kids cringe. I see kathrynn feeling <br/>
pain and frustration and anger.<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>

not to control others. her intent is to play out her vision.<br/>

<br/>
She needs to adapt to others&#39; needs ALL of the time.  Unless she can  <br/>
pay people to do what she says (and still, they could resign their  <br/>
jobs), she needs to make people want to do what she wants, or accept  <br/>
that they don&#39;t want to do it.<br/>

that it makes the apologizer feel better.<br/>
<br/>
LOTS of people seem to think everything is made right by an apology.  <br/>
But an insincere apology is adding insult to injury.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m picturing a kid who is frequently overly bossy, demanding,  <br/>
inflexible, non-empathetic. If she was to &quot;apologize&quot; for her  <br/>
behavior, but then continue on with that behavior, the apology is  <br/>
dishonest. I&#39;m not in favor of dishonesty.<br/>
<br/>
If I do something to harm someone, and then I sincerely regret it,  <br/>
there might be good reason to let them know that I regret it. It might  <br/>
mean we can continue a friendship or it might mean they won&#39;t seek  <br/>
revenge or some sort of payback.<br/>
<br/>
But, yeah, I am not in favor of apologies if the purpose is to reduce  <br/>
the remorse felt by the perpetrator. That remorse is a good thing.  <br/>
Rather than trying to take it away from our kids, better to explore it  <br/>
with them, to empathize and offer a little sympathy, even. But let  <br/>
them feel what they feel.<br/>
<br/>
  Lots of times I don&#39;t apologize, but I do something to make it clear  <br/>
that I&#39;m sorry we had the problem, whatever it is.<br/>

transform it into understanding that provides the impetus to truly change/prevent a behavior <br/>
in the future.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-229519440">This thread has been very interesting.  I am a compulsive apologizer and always have been.  My friends will even tell me to stop apologizing for stuff (well, the good friends - there are some that are used to blaming me because I automatically take the blame....maybe they aren&#39;t such good friends???)  Anyway, I have been working on this and questioning myself as to why I feel the need --- to make ME feel better?  To make the other person feel better?  To remain liked by the other?  Haven&#39;t figured it out yet.  As you can imagine, since I feel this huge need I have totally put this on my kids and have required apologies, probably even when none were necessary -- I will be thinking more carefully about this.  I know they (my kids) have felt put out and/or embarrassed by this at times.  I am so glad this topic is being discussed because JUST TONIGHT something came up that I wanted my daughter (16 years old) to apologize to a friend for but I didn&#39;t ask her to because I wanted<br/>
 to get your guys&#39; opinion real quick first.  Last weekend we had a 16th birthday party for my daughter and she handled the guest list and all the invites (I usually really control this part because I don&#39;t want anyone left out or feeling bad - to the point where people have been invited in the past that have hindered the party atmosphere)...she handed out little flyers and texted and sent Myspace messages to those she thought about and wanted to come.  The party was really fun and everyone had a great time.  Well, tonight some good friends came over with their daughter and I realized that we completely forgot about inviting her to the party.  I was feeling horrible because they all run in a big circle of friends and I&#39;m sure this girl had heard about the party.  So I asked my daughter before the friends came over if she remembered to invite this particular girl and she said she didn&#39;t remember if she did or not and we both felt bad.  My daughter has not apologized to this<br/>
 girl and I&#39;m not sure if she should or should I encourage my daughter to say something to this girl?  The evening felt  awkard or it could&#39;ve just been me perceiving it.   Any thoughts??? <br/>

other side, what it felt like to the people I was apologizing to.<br/>
<br/>
I realized it&#39;s very very annoying!<br/>
<br/>
It takes the focus off the person wronged and pulls it to the person  <br/>
asking for the apology.<br/>
<br/>
It essentially says &quot;I need you to pull yourself out of your misery  <br/>
and make me feel better.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Imagine you&#39;re bumped into and have scattered a bunch of stuff. What  <br/>
do you want to happen? Do you want the bumper to demand that you make  <br/>
them feel not bad about what happened? Or would you like them to  <br/>
*show* that they&#39;re sorry with a &quot;Oh, I&#39;m really sorry!&quot; and by  <br/>
turning their focus to helping you get everything picked back up?<br/>
