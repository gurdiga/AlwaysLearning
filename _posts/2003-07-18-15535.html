Constantly and with dedication.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; This may just be my problem , but it <br/>
<br/>
seems that when ever my kids start asking questions and getting <br/>
<br/>
interested in something I start organizing a formal lesson without <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When they asked where babies come from did you draw pictures and haul out <br/>
books, or just say &quot;from inside their mommies&quot;?   If the former, you&#39;ll have to <br/>
work extra hard!  If the latter, remember those short answers when they ask <br/>
where the Mediterranean is.  Either describe it (if they&#39;ll get it, if they have <br/>
some form of reference or would even understand &quot;between Africa and Europe&quot; or <br/>
point to it on a map, but don&#39;t go into the history of sailing ships and the <br/>
routes of the apostles and the geology of all inland seas in the Middle East <br/>
and current theories on the Great Flood.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sometimes they enjoy the info, but at other times <br/>
<br/>
it just turns them off to the whole thing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
AHA!  How much would you tell an adult?  <br/>
Can you learn to read their cues?  And teensy cues of posture or eye <br/>
movement?  <br/>
<br/>
IF they want more information, they&#39;ll ask another question.  If they are <br/>
happy with your VERY short response, they will LOOK happy.    Practice looking at <br/>
them instead of at your teaching materials, or at the chalkboard in your mind.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I find that if I am using <br/>
<br/>
a planned curriculum sometimes they seem to really enjoy the <br/>
<br/>
organization. It&#39;ll work great for a while, then they will balk at <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
to just do it.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t the place to get support for that, but there ARE places you can go <br/>
to get support.<br/>
<br/>
You harm more than just their interest in the material at hand when you push <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When they don&#39;t have the planned material they are <br/>
<br/>
fine for a few weeks, then they get grumpy and want the &quot;school time&#39; <br/>
<br/>
back. Any ideas on this?-&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes--Make their lives fascinating and interesting and busy and rick, so that <br/>
they don&#39;t want &quot;school time&quot; back, and so that you see natural learning <br/>
working in them and in you.<br/>

Please read that, and please don&#39;t think of unschooling as just the weeks you <br/>
don&#39;t &quot;do school.&quot;  It needs to be more than a lack of school-style &quot;life.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163571499">Hi Kelly,<br/>
<br/>
It must have something to do with personality, and of course, how we&#39;ve internalized our own school experience. It is also a big hurdle to overcome the societal belief that children must be &quot;taught&quot; in order to learn anything.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t relate to your experience myself. In fact, on the odd occasion that my kids want some structured sort of teaching, I find it quite hard and unnatural to get into that mode.<br/>
<br/>
My husband on the other hand is more like you, he just can&#39;t seem to help  going into teaching mode. It&#39;s not usually in a lesson kind of way, more of a lecture rather than a simple answer to a question. The kids often &quot;turn off&quot; as you said. Another thing he does is get out the dictionary, atlas etc. at the drop of a hat. This isn&#39;t a bad thing, but the way he does it turns the kids off too. It&#39;s sort of like...you need to know this, now.  I think he often misses natural teaching moments with this approach.<br/>
<br/>
What I do is listen to the kids when they ask about something, and I can usually guess what sort of answer they&#39;re after. It might be a desire for in-depth knowledge, or it might just be a very quick and brief answer that they want. I might suggest various resources to help and I will often get these and look to satisfy my own curiosity. This may or may not lead to a discussion of the topic. If they do want to explore the topic at length then I will help them find further info, of the type THEY want. This might be a video, a computer game, a trip somewhere, a visit to someone in the know...It is hardly ever something promoted as an &quot;educational resource&quot; such as workbooks, textbooks etc. We find these to often be boring and limited.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how long you have been unschooling, but I know it took me a couple of years to really relax, and feel confident in letting the kids be in charge of their own education (lives). Even though it was always easiest for me to let the kids go their own way, I felt varying levels of guilt about it during those first years. If you make a conscious effort to let go, I think you will find it easier as time goes by.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
Kerrin. <br/>

way he does it turns the kids off too. It&#39;s sort of like...you need to know <br/>
this, now.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that helped me the most was to hear my tone of voice, and <br/>
to consciously compare it to what I think I would say if an adult friend, <br/>
visiting my house, were to ask the same question.<br/>
<br/>
If an adult were to say &quot;What&#39;s five times twelve?&quot; because he was doing <br/>
something and actually needed to know, I&#39;d just tell him &quot;60&quot; because that&#39;s an <br/>
easy one (a measuring tape for anyone who sews) and it would be no big deal.  I <br/>
would NEVER say to a 30 year old &quot;You can figure that out.  First do the <br/>
tens...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And once I consciously started treating my five year old like a person <br/>
instead of &quot;like a kid&quot; it was easier to do it with the other two and to notice it <br/>
and steer things better when other adults treated them that &quot;googy-googy&quot; way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596129440">One thing I do is try to answer the question in the context of the <br/>
moment. This relates to the old joke where the kid asks where he came <br/>
from and the mom gives a 15 minute sex-ed lecture and he replies, &quot;Oh, <br/>
Johnny&#39;s from New York.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I spend a lot of time asking, &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;In what way?&quot; and <br/>
questions like that.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that what Sandra said is SO important--in asking how to <br/>
help, ask yourself &quot;How would I help a *person* do this?&quot; instead of <br/>
&quot;How would I help a *kid* do this?&quot; because we&#39;re culturally taught <br/>
these two questions have very different answers and it works better to <br/>
treat our kids like *people*.<br/>

I would start going into one of those teacher modes.   I remember when we<br/>
first started homeschooling.  It was around Mardi Gras time and I thought,<br/>
oh, what a fun time we can have!   I looked up Mardi Gras and Fat Tuesday on<br/>
the computer.  Sat them down in the couch and started reading to them about<br/>
it,  &quot;here&#39;s some pictures of the carnival you guys!&quot;   Oh I remember it so<br/>
well!  &lt;g&gt;    Then we went and made masks.<br/>
<br/>
Just a few days later I was talking to someone about our homeschooling and<br/>
mentioned that we had learned about Mardi Gras.   I turned to the kids and<br/>
said,  &quot;hey, remember about Mardi Gras?&quot;    &lt;silence&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Remember what we just learned, ya know,  Fat Tuesday and all that?&quot;<br/>
&lt;silence, again&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Finally,,  &quot;remember the masks we made?&quot;     My kids, &quot;do you want to see<br/>
the masks we made!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It hit me like a ton of bricks!  They didn&#39;t learn about Mardi Gras!  I did!<br/>
I was the one that was excited.  They weren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
They were glazed over!<br/>

tone with children. A perfect example, for those of you whom quilt, is<br/>
Eleanor Burns, the &quot;Quilt in a Day&quot; specialist with a popular program on<br/>
PBS. She has the most incredibly annoying sing/song voice condescending<br/>
&#39;teaching&#39; voice. Great engineer though, she&#39;s the one who discovered<br/>
the strip quilting technique that revolutionize the modern quilting<br/>
process,  after finding long strips of discarded fabric in a dumpster<br/>
from the Burlington Coat factory.<br/>
<br/>
Getting interested in a subject seems to lead to requests for more<br/>
details around our house. More than one book with the same theme or<br/>
subject, a tie in video or physical experience, following rather than<br/>
leading... <br/>
<br/>
current favorites:<br/>
<br/>
balance balls -- using them, making up games with them, seeing what<br/>
other people do with them<br/>
<br/>
greek/roman stuff - why did they have atriums in the middle of some of<br/>
their houses? Why don&#39;t we? How come we can&#39;t tear up our house and put<br/>
an atrium in the middle? ;) How did they create designs in mosaics.<br/>
Breaking up plates to create our own mosaics. Heated floors and<br/>
hypocausts and aqueducts and what happened to roman houses in Britain<br/>
after the legions left and the local governments took over.<br/>
<br/>
Hayao Miyazaki animated movies<br/>
<br/>
My Little Ponies -- How much they cost. Which ones are rare.<br/>
Refurbishment and enhancement. ;) What is ebay selling and for how much?<br/>
How come the big stores on Ebay are paying for advertising to feature My<br/>
Little Ponies in prominent ads. How much does a seller have to get to<br/>
cover selling and listing fees and advertising?  Feedback is a popular<br/>
topic around here and has led to some really good discussions on<br/>
quality, reputation, and ethics.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; This may semm like just a plain silly question, but how do you keep <br/>
<br/>

do know that this is a poor example to use against unschooling.  The child <br/>
was in school, right?  There were a whole lot of other factors involved besides <br/>
her parents giving her answers to her questions.  (At least they got that <br/>
right.)  <br/>
<br/>
But the short answer to your question is that if someone never learns <br/>
something like what&#39;s 12 x 5, it may just be because they never needed to know it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Unschooling seems to work best with a &quot;do as I do&quot; attitude. Lazy <br/>
parents who want to have the kid not lazy are better off sending them to <br/>
school, where they can see *some* adults modeling interest and activity. <br/>
Many unschooling parents have interests they pursue, rather than sitting <br/>
around waiting for the kid to be the first in the family to &quot;do something.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
With an older schooled child, it&#39;s important to plan to provide several <br/>
months of interesting, involved living before the child can really be <br/>
expected to return to that &quot;preschool&quot; level of interest in the world <br/>
and its riches.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489857087">This is SUCh a good question to think about.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have unschooled from the beginning NEVER have this problem. <br/>
Why not?<br/>
<br/>
I believe there is an evolution-based built-in mandate that creates an <br/>
internal &quot;urge&quot; in humans to learn and develop and that it is <br/>
especially strong in young humans to emulate and learn from older <br/>
humans.<br/>
<br/>
Kids that don&#39;t have that always have had it crushed somehow or another.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t think it is because parents helped &quot;too much&quot; that kids <br/>
get &quot;lazy in learning.&quot;  I mean - I walked into our living room the <br/>
other day and my 15 and 12 year olds were busy with a globe, quizzing <br/>
each other about what country various cities were in, around the world. <br/>
Laughing, learning - sisterly bonding, practicing taking turns, <br/>
practicing read the globe, whatever they were doing, it had absolutely <br/>
nothing to do with me, EXCEPT ....<br/>
<br/>
when we watched tv over the years, there was this globe sitting in the <br/>
living room and when somebody wondered aloud where a city was, I&#39;d grab <br/>
the globe and look for the city and announce the country and maybe <br/>
offer a teensy bit of information about where it was and often they&#39;d <br/>
want me to pass the globe around so they could see it.<br/>
<br/>
I never ever said, &quot;If you want to know then you need to get out the <br/>
globe and look it up.&quot; I just did it. Never even gave a thought to <br/>
expecting them to do it themselves.<br/>

well-- this was a weird situation. she entered public school at age 10. she was homeschooled up until then. her mom has a degree in early elementary education and the kid entered public school a year *behind*, and couldn&#39;t keep up (i&#39;ve heard homeschoolers are usually ahead of their public school peers). suffice it to say, her family life was WAY dysfunctional. i&#39;m in the process of divorcing her dad right now cause i finally got a clue as to *just* how dysfunctional, and almost got lost in the maelstrom myself (whew-- my son and i escaped). it&#39;s a long story, but she&#39;s being brought up to think that looks and being popular are the only things that matter. she ain&#39;t the brightest bulb on the tree, but she has this weird mix of mature (street) and very, very, VERY immature. she can be very compassionate. sometimes. but book smart? no one could accuse her of that. <br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t want to put energy into answering hypothetical questions like this, <br/>
honestly.<br/>
<br/>
You have a baby, and there are people here with lots of older and some grown <br/>
kids who are NOT lacking the ability to do things for themselves at all, <br/>
whatsoever.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t ask you to spend time answering things like &quot;What if your baby <br/>
decides that since you have a stroller he&#39;ll just stop walking?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;please be patient with me for asking questions; i am still *very very* much <br/>
in &quot;school&quot; mode and want to learn how to get out, and if it works, etc. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/deschooling">http://sandradodd.com/deschooling</a><br/>
<br/>
Did you look at that yet?<br/>
Have you read any at www.unschooling.com?  (Message boards, scroll to the <br/>
bottom for  &quot;new messages&quot; maybe, or just look through the topics and read what <br/>
seems interesting even if it&#39;s old.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind being patient, but the implied insult in asking something like <br/>
you asked (though you might not have thought about it) is that maybe someone <br/>
like, say ME, who has unschooled for twelve years, might not have considered, or <br/>
maybe might not have noticed, that kids are doing nothing.   <br/>
<br/>
If this couldn&#39;t work, there wouldn&#39;t be so many people doing it, and if it <br/>
weren&#39;t working for ME, I wouldn&#39;t be in here helping others understand it.  So <br/>
to combine these things:<br/>
<br/>
-=-please be patient with me for asking questions; i am still *very very* <br/>
much in &quot;school&quot; mode and want to learn how to get out, and if it works, etc.-=-<br/>
<br/>
....  &quot;if it works&quot; with &quot;be patient&quot; cancels itself out to some extent for <br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
Possibly I&#39;m being more grumpy than I need to be, but please PLEASE try to <br/>
couch your questions in terms that aren&#39;t quite so insulting.    You have a <br/>
child who is learning more words each week than many adults will learn in a year.  <br/>
You have a child who has learned everything he knows easily and happily.  I <br/>
have three children who were like yours when they were two and a half, and who <br/>
have since then learned to read and do math and find countries on globes and <br/>
to do all kinds of wonderful things without being taught, and without being <br/>
lazy and expecting other people to do it for them.   <br/>
<br/>
Part of what makes it fun and easy and real for them is that when they ask me <br/>
a question, I answer it the way I would if they were adults and asked me.  <br/>
Respectfully, kindly, simply, honestly, without teacher-voice, poodle-voice, <br/>
googie voice, without shame or &quot;a lesson,&quot; as much as I can without doing damage <br/>
to their joy and confidence.<br/>

help.  Measuring cups and spoons are a great introduction to fractions, for<br/>
instance, but you don&#39;t have to make a &quot;lesson&quot; out of it -- let him play<br/>
with them in the sink or tub or sandbox, and discover for himself that two<br/>
of one cup fills one other cup.  Let him stir a bowl of pudding, let him<br/>
paint the shower wall and his nekkid self with it, then just bathe him when<br/>
he&#39;s done.  (You can even spread the pudding on the tile like fingerpaint<br/>
and draw letters and numbers if you need to :-)  There are all kinds of fun<br/>
things you can do while accomplishing those basic needs.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

I can&#39;t imagine how a child who never had their little hands slapped or<br/>

were suffering from a major chemical imbalance in the brain.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Learned helplessness&quot; is an interesting psychological phenomenon and<br/>
it&#39;s possible to find out more about it on google.  I think I learned<br/>
about it in a book called &quot;Learned Optimism&quot;.  It&#39;s a good book, but<br/>

OK. i feel like i have been slapped in the face by someone i don&#39;t even<br/>
know. i asked what i meant to be a truly innocuous question and i got flamed<br/>
in return. you inferred insult where there was none.<br/>
 i got news for you: if you want to preach to the choir, that is fine, but<br/>
if you want people to come to this way of life it&#39;s a darn good idea not to<br/>
attack them in their innocence and infancy and ignorance. i did not attack<br/>
you. i did not belittle you. i asked a hypothetical question because to me<br/>
it is not hypothetical. i have one example to guide me, and that is the<br/>
stepdaughter that i already mentioned. i do not want my son to grow up this<br/>
way. i am a new mom, and at the time of that example i gave, was a new<br/>
stepmom, and so have no other examples to go by. i know no other kids. now<br/>
my son is 2.5, and i know no kids older than toddlers, except for the 13yo<br/>
girl next door, and she&#39;s a pi** poor example too. she goes to a baptist<br/>
school.<br/>
when i read your response, my first reaction was shock. whatever it was you<br/>
read into my post, surely i did not mean it. you did not come across as<br/>
grumpy, but outright hostile. my second reaction was anger, and i am still<br/>
very angry. my first impulse is to tell you to go flip yourself, but i am<br/>
sticking with this, cause i want to learn. i am not giving up yet.<br/>
let me give you some background about me.<br/>
5 months ago i moved 8 hours away from where i was. i moved to a relatively<br/>
&quot;crunchy&quot; area. here, i can go to playgroups for my son, nurse him, most of<br/>
the parents are vegetarian (or veg friendly), most cloth diaper, most<br/>
wouldn&#39;t bat an eye at someone nursing a 2.5 year old. most home/unschool.<br/>
where i was before, i was a freak.  where i was before, there were these<br/>
options for education:<br/>
1) public school<br/>
2) the christian academy<br/>
3) homeschool<br/>
4) the new montessori, which just opened, has a waiting list 14,000 years<br/>
long, and only goes to (i think) 4th grade.<br/>
not many homeschool (only born-again christians, and i am not one), and<br/>
nobody unschools. there are no resources, no networking. i first heard the<br/>
term &quot;unschool&quot; when i was pregnant with my son, and i heard that at a big<br/>
camping gathering, 11 hours away from home. i filed it away in the back of<br/>
my brain for future use. it sounded interesting, but not understanding it, i<br/>
wondered how feasible it was.<br/>
then i had my son, and i knew that i did not want to send him to public<br/>
school.<br/>
when i moved here this year, and realized how popular home/unschooling is, i<br/>
realized that maybe, just maybe i could do it. at least i&#39;d have support and<br/>
company.<br/>
so finally, the other day, i searched around on yahoogroups and signed up<br/>
for a few, to see what i could learn. i picked &quot;AlwaysLearning&quot; and a couple<br/>
others.<br/>

12 years. i *don&#39;t* know how it works for you. apparently you are some kind<br/>
of Grand Hoo-Ha in the unschooling movement, and i did find two articles by<br/>
you last night which i read with fervor, but after this post i must say i am<br/>
most unimpressed with your attitude. did you forget that the name of this<br/>
list is &quot;Always Learning&quot;? are your children the only ones you are trying to<br/>
teach?? oops.....i meant, are they the only ones learning from you? (see, i<br/>
picked up at least that much lingo already). don&#39;t forget, there *are* those<br/>
of us who know absolutely diddly. so no, i did not mean to be insulting. if<br/>
you knew me you would know that i am most humble most of the time and would<br/>
*never* insult someone, and if i have done so unintentionally, i most humbly<br/>
apologize.<br/>

i have no idea how many people are doing it. like i said, i never heard of<br/>
it till recently, and i only know one person who is trying it. and her son<br/>

and FWIW, you are not helping me to understand it by attacking me the way<br/>
you did. you are helping me to understand that you have a bee in your bonnet<br/>
about those who don&#39;t understand.<br/>
look, i am a minority too; i am a crunchy Pagan, i&#39;m 43 years old in a 24<br/>
year old&#39;s mind (long story), i don&#39;t fit in either. my mom and brother<br/>
think i&#39;m already out of my mind; now they think i am *really* doing my son<br/>
a disservice cause i don&#39;t vax him and want to homeschool him. i *know* how<br/>
it feels to stand up against the mainstream. i am not here to scratch at you<br/>
like the rest of them. i am here cause i want the best for my son, but i<br/>
have been reared in the best of what the &#39;50s had to offer-- TV dinners,<br/>
beaver cleaver stuff, mainstream rules. and it&#39;s hard to get away from that<br/>
mindset, even though my instinct is screaming out that that is unnatural and<br/>
to find something real, something that works. so look. take a chill pill. i<br/>
need HELP here, not derision. if i am not asking a question in the &quot;right&quot;<br/>
way, please don&#39;t flame me for it! i *will* get it. but not on my first day,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1168247404">Hi Pam.  I would like to respond to your questions about unschooling <br/>
from my point of view.  Six months ago, I had never even heard of such a <br/>
thing.  I&#39;m 32 and have 4 daughters ages 7, 5, almost 3, and 8 months. <br/>
 My grand plan had been to send my dds to preschool and kindergarten <br/>
across the street from us at the Catholic School where my husband went <br/>
as a child and then homeschool them with a curriculum.  First dd went <br/>
for the two years and I sent my second dd to their preschool.  <br/>
<br/>
I did try to teach my first dd at home, but it wasn&#39;t working.  We were <br/>
butting heads so much and she was just getting frustrated.  So I let up <br/>
for awhile while I read more about homeschooling methods.  I came across <br/>
Unschooling.com and signed up there as well as this list.  At first, I <br/>
was amazed this was even possible, but it made so much sense to me.  I <br/>
did have a lot of questions and got some pretty heated answers <br/>
sometimes.  I&#39;m sensitive too especially when I know I&#39;m ignorant about <br/>
something, kinda like my oldest dd when I tried to teach her :)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, here&#39;s what I&#39;ve learned about &quot;How to do it?&quot;   What you need <br/>
to do is just love your child with an open heart and open hands.  Be <br/>
supporting, but not surrounding.  This includes sleeping and eating and <br/>
playing and everything they do.  I like to picture it like this:  The <br/>
ideal in a free society is to get up every morning in joy, loving what <br/>
you will do that day, knowing that the choices you make are your <br/>
choices, and knowing you have the support of those around you to make <br/>
those choices with the best intent.  This ideal should begin at birth <br/>
and never stop.  It IS possible to give this gift to our children.  The <br/>
most difficult parts will be letting go of all your childhood upbringing <br/>
to &quot;force&quot; children to do things and instead guide them, talk to them <br/>
nonstop in an equal, conversational way.  It is very hard to convince <br/>
friends and family so remember, you really don&#39;t HAVE to convince anyone <br/>
because it&#39;s YOUR child.  It can also be difficult to meet your state&#39;s <br/>
(or area&#39;s) educational requirements.  I live in NY which is apparently <br/>
one of the toughest, but it&#39;s not impossible, just a pain in the neck to <br/>
do all the paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s pretty much my take on it.  Oh yeah, from this day forward <br/>
every second of your life should become an example for you child.  Life <br/>
and breathe to set the example you want them to see. That&#39;s not always <br/>
easy, but it&#39;s vital.  And smile and laugh hard every day.  Every single <br/>
day.  <br/>
<br/>
Good luck, Heidi</div>

&lt;&lt; did you forget that the name of this<br/>
list is &quot;Always Learning&quot;? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No, I named it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;are your children the only ones you are trying to<br/>
teach?? oops.....i meant, are they the only ones learning from you?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No.  People learn from everything around them all the time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;i did not mean to be insulting. if<br/>
you knew me you would know that i am most humble most of the time and would<br/>
*never* insult someone, and if i have done so unintentionally, i most humbly<br/>
apologize.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you knew me or my kids, or if you knew any unschooled kids, you wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have worded your inquiry in such a way as I felt insulted, I&#39;m sure.  You would <br/>
have LOTS of confidence in unschooling if you met the kids of some of the <br/>
people on this list.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-you are helping me to understand that you have a bee in your bonnet<br/>
about those who don&#39;t understand.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It has nothing to do with your level of understanding, it had to do with the <br/>
way your worded your original post.  Have you looked at it again?  <br/>
<br/>
Complaining and denying that what you said was in any way offensive doesn&#39;t <br/>
help you unschool.  It doesn&#39;t help me want to help you either.  But IF you can <br/>
JUST ask your questions without saying things that can be seen as implying <br/>
that our kids probably aren&#39;t as cool as you want your kid to be (or whatever it <br/>
was, it was hundreds of posts ago in my reading) then you&#39;ll get LOTS of the <br/>
people on this list to help you generously and surely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i am here cause i want the best for my son, but i<br/>
have been reared in the best of what the &#39;50s had to offer-- TV dinners,<br/>
beaver cleaver stuff, mainstream rules. and it&#39;s hard to get away from that<br/>
mindset, even though my instinct is screaming out that that is unnatural and<br/>
to find something real, something that works. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I was born in 1953.  I changed and you can too.  Thousands of people can and <br/>
do live more peacefully and thoughtfully with their kids every day, not just <br/>
from unschooing ideas, but (as you probably could list off yourself, so I&#39;m <br/>
saying nothing too exciting) La Leche League, Continuum Concept, all kinds of <br/>
mindful parenting sources and ideas big and small.  This list exists because <br/>
people are willing to help you.  I keep webpages on a website I pay for by the <br/>
month so people can get to unschooling and parenting help without seeing any <br/>
pop-up menus and so the address can be easy to remember and type in.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;so look. take a chill pill.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
SO look.<br/>
Take what you like and leave the rest.<br/>
And try to ask your questions without insulting the people you want help from.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;you are setting for me unreasonable expectations that you<br/>
would never do with your kids. do you think that&#39;s fair?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not setting expectations on you.  I told you how I felt about what you <br/>
wrote.<br/>
<br/>
I assume you really DO want help. So look at the help, not at the helper.<br/>

luckily, i live in NC, which i hear is pretty lax about laws re: keeping kids out of public schools. <br/>

OMG, how hard!! i don&#39;t even live the example *I* want me to see! hmm, new goal. and you are right, i don&#39;t laugh enough. i try to get my son into tickle fights just so i can crack up with him!<br/>

Why don&#39;t you try starting a yahoo group for your area?  The homeschool group that I am a part of was started by a woman that moved to town and started a homeschooling list.  We had a few groups in town that were the conservation Christian/school at home type.  She started this one, I was the first person to join and for almost the first year it was her, I and one other family.  Now about 2 years later....we have something like 40 families.  The list grew in spurts and we have a really nice core group.  It is an inclusive group, so we have a variety of homeschooling styles.  You may want to describe your group more specific to what you are looking for.  Or describe it as an inclusive/secular group.  You want to be sure that people in the area don&#39;t think it&#39;s just another group like the ones that already exist.<br/>

I hope this makes sense and can help you out.<br/>
