 </span></blockquote>For those of you who DON&#39;T know, we had a PJ and game night at last year&#39;s <br/>
conference. Shyrley said she sleeps in the buff, so we were all awaiting her <br/>
arrival! &lt;G&gt; <br/>
<br/>
And she was a no show! Bummer!<br/>
<br/>
This year there&#39;s no PJ party, but a picnic in the park with Jim Weiss. <br/>
Shyrley&#39;s certainly welcome to wear whatever strikers her fanny---I mean, <br/>
fancy! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&quot;Youth is not a time of life; it is a state of mind; it is<br/>
not a matter of rosy cheeks, red lips and supple knees; it<br/>
is a matter of the will, quality of the imagination, a<br/>
vigor of the emotions; it is the freshness of the deep<br/>
springs of life. &quot;<br/>
