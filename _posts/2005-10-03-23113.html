&gt; Good point. We were originally talking about other&#39;s thoughts and words<br/>
&gt; coming into our space through movies and TV. We always have the power to<br/>
&gt; choose our own thoughts and words, no matter what is going on around us.<br/>
&gt; ================================<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seemed to me that someone defending a lack of television was suggesting <br/>
that it was dangerous to be exposed to noise (noise=violence) or any pretend <br/>
violence, because we would think the thoughts that led to doing violence and <br/>
being violence.<br/>
<br/>
The best counter argument was that control violated others.<br/>
<br/>
Television (by which I mean television and DVDs and videos) gives me an <br/>
opportunity to think about characters and situations and places and ideas I might <br/>
not otherwise have considered or been exposed to.   It doesn&#39;t prevent me from <br/>
using a remote control, from discussing those ideas with others in person or <br/>
online, and it never has once forced me to watch a show I didn&#39;t want to watch. <br/>
  I&#39;ve watched a ton of froofy music, concert, documentary of musicians, <br/>
history of music, NONE of which exist in any remotely similar way in the real <br/>
world.   Recorded music doesn&#39;t have the visuals.   Books don&#39;t have the music.   <br/>
Real-life exposure is limited to the form available where the person goes or <br/>
lives or studies.    Someone at a music conservatory could hear live music <br/>
daily, but only a few styles.   Someone who lives above a jazz or blues club could <br/>
hear live music daily, but not orchestras or traditional south Pacific <br/>
instruments.   <br/>
<br/>
We could go down hundreds of little trails like that one, none leading to <br/>
violence.<br/>
<br/>
We could not go down hundreds of little trails like that in a family in which <br/>
children are forbidden to watch TV (by which I mean TV, DVD, video).<br/>
