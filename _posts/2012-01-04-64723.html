<div id="ygrps-yiv-153493732">I am new to unschooling and trying to figure it out.  When I discuss unschooling with my husband he agrees with the philosophies.  When he has a spat with our 3 year old and she cries for me bc he&#39;s tryig to force her into a time out. I ask him if I can help and he rolls his eyes and says go for it.  I comfort her, calm her down and talk to her about why daddy&#39;s upset or whatever the situation is.  She gets up and says she wants to say sorry to daddy.  When she Apologizes he lectures her then turns to me and says I need to be more stern.  It makes me frustrated/angry and insecure.  Is there any advice you can give me on this topic?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684342989">I struggle with the same thing on a smaller scale with my husband. He&#39;s all about unschooling when it concerns learning but tends to be strict in all other areas. I&#39;ve tried just being a good example and I have seen some small changes in the way he responds to our son&#39;s behavior. I&#39;d love to see more. I think the key might be fear. He&#39;s afraid if our son isn&#39;t disciplined enough he&#39;ll be anti-social and not get along in the world. I think my husband is also afraid to lose what he perceives as control of the family. I know it&#39;s hard and I wish I had more for you. I did come across a website for unschooling dads is you think he&#39;d look at it. I&#39;ll go find it and give it to you in a few minutes. I the meantime, you keep doing what your mothering heart tells you to do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660315902">I signed my husband&#39;s email up for this Yahoo group.  He admits he finds it<br/>
hard to read every single response but he likes being exposed to the<br/>
scenarios and tried to read as much as possible.  It&#39;s worked out well for<br/>
him, he&#39;s now exposed to the concepts without me having to &quot;teach&quot; them to<br/>
him (kind of appropriate, I think....)<br/>

If he didn&#39;t mind being signed up for the discussion list, then that&#39;s not so bad, but there are many options between him reading this discussion and you &quot;having to &#39;teach&#39;&quot; him. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-565569225">Which is exactly why I chose to share, because he appears very interested<br/>
in learning more and so far between me suggesting books and attending<br/>
conferences, etc, this has been his favorite way, it seems.  Or the place<br/>
he&#39;s gotten the most useable info from maybe?  In reading responses he has<br/>
been linked to your site and other sources of information via specific<br/>
topics he found interest in and/or feel we relate to in some way, instead<br/>
of what I or someone else thinks he ought to read. :)<br/>
