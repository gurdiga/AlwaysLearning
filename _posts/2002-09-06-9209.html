<div id="ygrps-yiv-309471998">Julian was working on a project yesterday that I wanted to share, because it <br/>
seemed very much like what an unschooler would do, and that a traditional <br/>
school (or probably any adult interested in assigning a Learning Project, <br/>
really) could come up with.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s obsessed with history, and as a result of Civilization 3, and Age of <br/>
Empires and those other history computer games, has become interested in a <br/>
bunch of historic battles. Then he started reading a novel called Gates of <br/>
Fire, by Steven Pressfield, about the battle of Thermopylae, between Sparta <br/>
and Persia.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night he took out his D&D books and started equipping two armies, each <br/>
with a generous budget, to reflect the armies in this battle. He figured out <br/>
how each aspect would correspond...(Here, I&#39;m just babbling, because even <br/>
though he tried to explain exactly how he did this, I really didn&#39;t <br/>
understand).  Julian doesn&#39;t often write stuff, and he still has Math Fear, <br/>
but he was making page after page of lists, and was using a calculator <br/>
wildly. His intention after the details are worked out are to run this battle <br/>
and see who has the advantages.<br/>
<br/>
So, there we are. As a result of computer games and Dungeons and Dragons, <br/>
he&#39;s doing this complex, clearly &quot;educational&quot; project. <br/>

Oh! A friend of mine just recommended this. I&#39;m going to read it to Quinn, <br/>
who says &quot; I don&#39;t like the death part of war, just the tactics.&quot; &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1152310642">That sounds great.  My son has been reading a book called &quot;Warriors&quot; and<br/>
after each story it rates the warrior on a scale of 1-10 on weaponry,<br/>
tactics, honor, etc.  We talked about this rating and it has Nate<br/>
thinking in numbers as well.  It is a heck of thing for a son of a peace<br/>
activist to be studying.  lisa<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385997445">When my younger brother was about 8 years old he used to play a game he made <br/>
up himself where he took his baseball cards and put teams together according <br/>
to their stats.  This is the brother labeled &quot;learning disabled&quot;!  <br/>
<br/>
  He is now a welder (33 years old now) who works when and where he wants <br/>
whenever he decides because he has basically no debt.  His favorite past time <br/>
at the time is playing &quot;Age of Empires&quot; online.<br/>
<br/>
I remember running into old school teachers that we used to have and they <br/>
would ask about him not really wanting to know how he was doing but just <br/>
secretly hoping that he some sort of bum strung out on drugs or something.  <br/>
They were so &quot;smart&quot; having tagged him early so they could &quot;help&quot; him!  <br/>
Ugghh!!<br/>
<br/>
I get great pleasure in telling all about what he does and how he only has to <br/>
work about 4-6 months out of the year because he has handled his finances and <br/>
career so well!!!  I know their teacher jobs pay so well. :)<br/>
