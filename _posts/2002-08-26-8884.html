<br/>
My kids race to the stop sign at the end of our road at 6:00 to meet dh on<br/>
his way home from work.  They take turns sitting on his lap and steering<br/>
home.  It has been a lot of fun, ok except for those 2 little old ladies<br/>
Adriane almost took out....but other than that  :)<br/>

Actually ours does.  But the kids, even sitting in dh&#39;s lap, are no closer<br/>
to the bag than I am driving with my little short legs.  Of course, I&#39;m also<br/>
not much of a worrier....<br/>
