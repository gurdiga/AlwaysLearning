<div id="ygrps-yiv-1086397552"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt; This is the simplest way I can think of that requires little to no money<br/>
&gt; and is humane.  I would tentatively suggest that your friend could<br/>
&gt; possibly<br/>
&gt; do the same as my vet by making a fairly airtight box out of plywood and<br/>
&gt; caulking, line it with comfy cushions or blankets to keep the cat<br/>
&gt; comfortable and attach a plastic hose to the box that would go over<br/>
&gt; the end<br/>
&gt; of a car exhaust (ensuring it is long enough that no heat reaches the cat<br/>
&gt; box.)  Turning on the car would create a gas which would put the cat<br/>
&gt; into a<br/>
&gt; stupor fairly quickly, eventually causing them to pass on.  If she<br/>
&gt; wants to<br/>
&gt; hold the cat and the cat is fairly insensate already, using a large,<br/>
&gt; clear<br/>
&gt; plastic bag (attached to the hose) instead of the box might be<br/>
&gt; feasable.  It also might be more difficult for her  emotionally.<br/>
&gt; Please be sure she does these things with the garage door OPEN, to ensure<br/>
&gt; she does not accompany her cat in its voyage.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would think this FAR more stressful on the cat than a trip in the car to<br/>
the vet.  Locking it in an escape-proof box and gassing it with exhaust is<br/>
NOT HUMANE!  Imagine the cat&#39;s terror as it tries to escape and can&#39;t.  What<br/>
a horrible way to die.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking from experience, gassing a cat with anesthesia while it is confined<br/>
to a small box is very stressful on the cat and is NOT recommended as a<br/>
first choice for anesthesia, either.  They thrash horribly!  If this is the<br/>
way your vet routinely anesthetizes animals, I would RUN as fast as possible<br/>
to another vet!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it was illegal. If there was no law at<br/>
all but some fuss about the topic, there can be a push to get a law approved<br/>
to answer the question that current law might not be addressing.<br/>
<br/>
We have the same situation with homeschooling, interestingly, here in<br/>
California. It is not specifically legal to &quot;homeschool&quot;, nor is it<br/>
specifically illegal to &quot;homeschool&quot;. Thousands of us elect to homeschool in<br/>
this limbo (in fact preferring at this time NOT to have a specific law), not<br/>
waiting on Big Brother to tell us it&#39;s okay. ;)<br/>
<br/>
I feel the same way about vet care (or medical care for humans for that<br/>
matter). Frankly, the vast majority of experienced laymen rabbit and guinea<br/>
pig breeders know more about their health and needs than the vast majority<br/>
of general-practice vets. Such is life with &quot;exotics&quot;.<br/>

dog for specific info on a possible breed-related problem. Most vets don&#39;t <br/>
have time to learn every breed-specific disease/problem; the breeder has <br/>
dedicated his life to understand that breed. Often the breeder has WAAAY more <br/>
knowledge than the average veterinarian. The breeder may often send the <br/>
dog-owner back to the vet&#39;s and  &quot;arm&quot; the vet with specifics that the vet <br/>
had previously not known.<br/>

post) in an advanced state of illness.  I would seriously doubt that she <br/>
would be paying much attention to her surroundings, past knowing that she <br/>
was in a warm box with her favorite cushion.  When my beloved basset came <br/>
down with lymphatic sarcoma, her last few days were basically <br/>
immobile.  She grunted in effort trying to cross the floor and rarely moved <br/>
once down.  Thankfully, we were able to afford the services of a vet who <br/>
came to our home and helped her pass on with us next to her.  The woman <br/>
with the ill cat, (again, according to the post) has barely enough money <br/>
for food and cannot afford the luxury I was able to purchase.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I could personally do it, but if she&#39;s strong enough I still <br/>
feel it would be the most humane and un-tutored method of helping her cat <br/>
pass on.  Much more humane than cervical dislocation or a more <br/>
&#39;projectile-based&#39; solution to her emotion-ridden problem.<br/>
<br/>
As for the gassing of cats to work on them, my neighbor (a vet tech <br/>
currently on maternity leave) says that when she worked with my vet, a few <br/>
cats would get angry by the box-anesthesia procedure, but that those cats <br/>
were usually angry whenever they were seen.  She felt that trying to inject <br/>
an angry non-anesthetized cat would be even more stressful on the cat than <br/>
a few moments in the box.  She also mentioned that many cats were quite <br/>
relaxed in the box and would watch what she was doing until the meds took <br/>
hold.  She felt that the handling of the animal prior to anesthesia really <br/>
had more impact on the animal&#39;s reaction to being confined, than actually <br/>
being *in* the confined space.<br/>

I understood that the cat owner had recently spent lots on vet bills and<br/>

take the cat to the vet&#39;s office was going to be much cheaper, but the cat<br/>

I absolutely hate tank inductions!  There is too much stress on the cat, not<br/>
to mention the gas exposure to everyone in the vicinity (not to mention OSHA<br/>
frowns on this). My chamber sits in the cupboard, and I haven&#39;t had to gas a<br/>
 cat in ages and I deal with alot of nasty psycho cats! DKT (injectable<br/>
combination) is a dream come true, to not only me, but my staff (all that<br/>
exposure to iso with the tank) and the cat (no stage II excitement, no<br/>
catecholamine release, etc).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I will hopefully never put another cat through that again. IMHO<br/>
those boxes are a throwback to the 40&#39;s and should be used only in the most<br/>
extreme of extremes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That said, if one can get hands on the cat well enough to shove it into the<br/>
box, one can get their hands on it well enough to do an IM injection.  The<br/>
stress that those poor cats have to go through in the tank before they<br/>
collapse is far more than any injectable drug technique we would use, so the<br/>
fact that it may have been fractious and angry beforehand really holds not<br/>
much water.<br/>

determined what was wrong.  They just didn&#39;t know if the tumor was on an <br/>
organ from which it could be safely removed.  So I had to sit by for a <br/>
month and watch her starving to death.  I wanted her death to be <br/>
peaceful at home.  But I also was so afraid the kids would find her dead <br/>
before me and I thought they were just too little to handle that.  So on <br/>
the day she would have died anyway, my husband and I drove her to the <br/>
vet&#39;s office.  They used a needle and she died.  But that last few <br/>
minutes of her life, putting her out on the table and getting the shots <br/>
were not nice.  That was the hardest part of all.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll <br/>
ever forgive myself for that.  She was my friend and I put her through <br/>
that at her very last moment.<br/>
<br/>
I completely understand what it means to have to make such a <br/>
heartwrenching decision because of money.  Maybe a vet could be found <br/>
who wouldn&#39;t charge for a housecall.  Maybe she could offer to clean his <br/>
house in exchange or wash his car for a month.  If I could do it over <br/>
again, I would have washed toilets if it meant not seeing that terror in <br/>
her eyes before they closed for the last time.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,  Heidi</div>

<br/>
You can deliver the animal to the clinic, say good-bye, and leave. They take <br/>
care of the rest.<br/>
<br/>
You can take him to the clinic and hold him while they inject---like you did.<br/>
<br/>
You can have the vet come to your house, no extra charge (and my vets have <br/>
never charged me for euthanasia at home or at the clinic), and put him down <br/>
there. If you are a regular client, I think mine often feel uncomfortable <br/>
charging you to &quot;kill&quot; your dog. <br/>
<br/>
I know they&#39;ve charged some folks (who weren&#39;t regular clients), but the fee <br/>
was paid a few days in advance so they didn&#39;t have to pay right afterwards <br/>
when they were so miserable.<br/>
<br/>
OR you can ask them to call me and I will hold your pet in MY arms and cry <br/>
like a baby while you sit in another room.<br/>
<br/>
As INCREDIBLY hard as it is, I prefer to BE there while they &quot;go to sleep&quot;. I <br/>
adored them for many years; I was their buddy---and I feel responsible for <br/>
taking their lives, even it&#39;s for the best.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve held many friends&#39; (and a few strangers&#39;) dogs and cats while they cried <br/>
in another room. At least there were warm, loving arms around them when they <br/>
died. How could you ask for more?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>A year ago our cat Grendel developed stomach cancer, and had reached a place <br/>
where she was in a lot of pain. We have a wonderful vet who for years JUST <br/>
did housecalls. (She now has an office, but still does housecalls)  She came <br/>
to the house and Grendel died very peacefully on the couch, surrounded by the <br/>
people who loved her. It was hard for us, especially Julian, as she was older <br/>
than him and it was like losing a sibling in a lot of ways.  But we all felt <br/>
so much better that her last moments were so peaceful and love-filled.<br/>
<br/>
We have two other cats, both older than Julian. Simone is over 20 years old, <br/>
and disabled quite a bit from thyroid problems. She can&#39;t jump onto the couch <br/>
anymore, so we&#39;ve made a step with a laundry basket for her. We may need to <br/>
make a ramp for her at some point. But as long as she&#39;s happy and not <br/>
experiencing pain, we&#39;re happy to have her with us.<br/>
