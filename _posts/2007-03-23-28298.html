Hello Sandra.  I enjoyed your website.  I do have some problems with  <br/>
your approach to telling your kids about pornography.  I get from  <br/>
your writing that you have an adverse reaction to anything that might  <br/>
resemble or imply &quot;discipline,&quot; as you seem to have remembered it.   <br/>
Albeit from your family or families you knew, I don&#39;t think  <br/>
banishment or the word &quot;no&quot; or an ominous tone of voice are  <br/>
particularly harmful to a kid&#39;s self-esteem or their understanding.   <br/>
Sometimes you have to understand that kids already understand that it  <br/>
IS wrong.  It seemed that your son DID understand that.  Instincts,  <br/>
life experience, and having a good mom taught him that before he was  <br/>
even 12.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s very important to not fall into a category of &quot;cool&quot; mom or the  <br/>
laid back one just to appease your kids.  Seeing fear in your kids  <br/>
eyes is not always a bad thing.  After all, you want your kid to be  <br/>
afraid to jump off a cliff, not slickly talked out of it with a Dairy  <br/>
Queen blizzard in hand.  Sometimes there is no other way than to say,  <br/>
&quot;NO.  HELL NO.&quot;  You don&#39;t always have to explain yourself.  Your kid  <br/>
should trust your judgement.  And you should trust and accept that  <br/>
your kid will not like you all the time.  Just because a situation is  <br/>
uncomfortable for you and your kid does not mean that it is damaging  <br/>
to them.      This is food for thought.  Perhaps you&#39;ve thought about  <br/>
much of this.  Let me know what you think.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>

So...<br/>
I was already bristly from phrases like &quot;...&#39;discipline,&#39; as you seem  <br/>
to have remembered it&quot; and the implication that I could or would  <br/>
write as much as I&#39;ve written based on my families or families I knew  <br/>
(though I suppose some people have written much more based on much  <br/>
less)...   and here was my response.   The writing he chose to call  <br/>
my &quot;porn article&quot; is this:<br/>

#1, I don&#39;t have &quot;a porn article&quot; and I nearly deleted your e-mail  <br/>
unread as spam.  Be careful what you name things.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Perhaps you&#39;ve thought about much of this.  Let me know what you  <br/>
think.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already found a website that lets you know what I think.<br/>
I&#39;ve thought about ALL of what you wrote, for years.<br/>
You haven&#39;t thought about all of what I wrote, though, and are  <br/>
already in the process of rejecting it.  So I understand your point  <br/>
of view and mine as well, while you only understand yours and seem to  <br/>
want me to take mine back.<br/>
<br/>
-=Albeit from your family or families you knew, I don&#39;t think  <br/>
banishment or the word &quot;no&quot; or an ominous tone of voice are  <br/>
particularly harmful to a kid&#39;s self-esteem or their understanding.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is quite belittling of my experience:  &quot;your family or families  <br/>
you knew.&quot;    I can&#39;t help but think of hundreds of kids I taught,  <br/>
hundreds of unschooling families I&#39;ve worked with (and hundreds of  <br/>
families I&#39;ve worked with a little in which unschooling failed  <br/>
because the parents clung to things that hampered it), and the  <br/>
hundreds of families I&#39;ve known in my life of observing people.   <br/>
People also tend to tell me their life stories in detail; always  <br/>
have.  My knowledge isn&#39;t just based on my family and families I knew  <br/>
(why the past tense there!?).<br/>
<br/>
-=-After all, you want your kid to be afraid to jump off a cliff, not  <br/>
slickly talked out of it with a Dairy Queen blizzard in hand.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids have never desired to jump off a cliff.  I have two friends  <br/>
who killed themselves when they were 14 and 15.  They didn&#39;t jump off  <br/>
a cliff, each used a gun.  Their parents said &quot;NO&quot; a lot.  Their  <br/>
parents wouldn&#39;t have &quot;let&quot; them shoot themselves in the head, and  <br/>
yet they chose, even though they were surely afraid, to shoot  <br/>
themselves in the head rather than wake up the next day still in that  <br/>
family.  If a kid would decide not to jump for an ice cream treat, he  <br/>
didn&#39;t really want to jump much.   (I&#39;ll put a link at the bottom  <br/>
about some of the things parents believe their kids would do if they  <br/>
didn&#39;t say &quot;no&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-You don&#39;t always have to explain yourself. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have to, but I have chosen to do so, since my children were  <br/>
very young, and my results are good.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Your kid should trust your judgement. -=-<br/>
<br/>
They do, because I have chosen to explain myself and so they KNOW  <br/>
that when I tell them something I&#39;ll be able to explain why.   <br/>
Sometimes they don&#39;t even ask for the explanation because they trust  <br/>
that I have one.  They don&#39;t trust me out of fear, they trust me out  <br/>
of respect and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just because a situation is uncomfortable for you and your kid  <br/>
does not mean that it is damaging to them.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Just because a parent thinks a kid isn&#39;t damaged doesn&#39;t mean the kid  <br/>
isn&#39;t being damaged.<br/>
<br/>
These might help you move another step away from thinking that &quot;no&quot;  <br/>
never hurts, if you&#39;re interested.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727279460">I&#39;m brand new to this list so I hope it&#39;s okay that I jump in here. I<br/>
am new to this concept of unschooling and I want to learn all I can<br/>
even though my little one is just 14m old.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to say that I really appreciate that article. I<br/>
hadn&#39;t seen it on your site until I saw that message here, but it was<br/>
refreshing to me. Wow, what a way to handle the situation! I hope that<br/>
I can learn to react so calmly and with so much respect for my<br/>
children when those kinds of situations arise.  It&#39;s a completely<br/>
different way of dealing with things than what I grew up with,<br/>
especially coming from a very conservative background. It&#39;s so<br/>
wonderful to see someone who can approach that without condemning or<br/>
shaming their child.</div>
