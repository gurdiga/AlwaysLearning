<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021961206"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;Subject: &quot;accelerated unschooling&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&gt;&gt;Any ideas as to a good response I can send?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ow,Ow! Uncle! I give in! I swear I&#39;ll never use the word gifted again! Geez, <br/>
they just don&#39;t get it! Ouch! You&#39;re right, people will just use any excuse <br/>
to f**k with their kids. Oops. Did I say that onlist? ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There are some truly brilliant minds out there, and no, those school induced <br/>
gifted labels do not identify them most of the time. Einstein was kicked out <br/>
of school for being too dull and Edison for being a troublemaker. <br/>
Recognizing your child&#39;s gifts is a good thing. And yes, some kids do really <br/>
thrive on an accelerated pace. I call it unschooling on speed. But it&#39;s the <br/>
child who leads and the parent who tries to keep up. That&#39;s the unschooling <br/>
part of it. Leading a child like this by the nose through a pre-planned set <br/>
of study that the parents think is &quot;worthwhile&quot; will not lead to anything. <br/>
Time to play and dream and think might lead to something really special <br/>
though. And it certainly won&#39;t harm the child the way a pushy parent with an <br/>
agenda will.<br/>
<br/>
Children need freedom in order to learn. Truly brilliant minds are no <br/>
different. If this woman thinks her kids are brilliant, then they need time <br/>
to think and daydream and ponder. They don&#39;t need to be led toward the right <br/>
answers, they need to be free to ponder the questions that haven&#39;t even been <br/>
asked yet. They need to look at 2+2 and think of the hidden answer, the <br/>
stuff that the brilliant minds of the past had not even been looking at. If <br/>
they truly are brilliant, then this is what happens. The wheels turn, the <br/>
ideas form, and always, always (as with with every human) the learning <br/>
happens.<br/>
<br/>
Geez.<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>
