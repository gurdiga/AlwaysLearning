Wow!  I never realized that this was something that other kids went through.  I can clearly remember being ten years old and at night I would be having near panick attacks and crying for this very reason.  My mother thought that I must be having trouble at school so she had my teacher ( a middle aged man who I had absolutely no rapport with - eek)  take me out of the classroom to talk to me.  Needless to say I stifled my cries for the next while for fear that I&#39;d have to talk to the teacher again.  <br/>

Chamille went through that BIG time last year at the age of 14.  She really wanted to stay a kid forever.  What&#39;s really interesting, is that right before she turned 14, I&#39;d found this fill in the blank journal book thing that a friend of hers had given to her many years before that had a question about the perfect age to be.  When she was maybe 10, she&#39;d written in there that she thought 14 would be the best age to be.  I told her that on her 14th birthday and showed her the book.<br/>
 <br/>
She couldn&#39;t believe that she&#39;d written that, since at the time she felt like being 14, just out of 13 kind of sucked.  Dealing with emotional crazies, having her menstral cycle, and other assorted newly teenaged angst, felt like the worst thing in the world and she wanted to be little again and stay that way forever.  She cried about it many times.  Now at the age of 15, she feels pretty good about where she&#39;s at.  She gets more frustrated with the lack of control that teens have in the world in general, combined with the fact that they are supposed to act all mature and grown up.  She&#39;s pretty clear about the fact that if she&#39;s to act mature, not like a kid, then she should have to sames rights as other mature people.  Our culture is pretty messed up that way!<br/>
