<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004810835">No, its not that menopause is over (damn it).<br/>
And I don&#39;t really believe in the power of curses, but sometimes in  <br/>
the intent is clear.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A couple of years ago, someone on the Unschooling Discussion list was  <br/>
asked repeatedly to remove an advertisement from a sigline.<br/>
she wrote to me on the side:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You are closed minded and I truly hope karma smites you and yours.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There was more to it and I&quot;m going to put it on a page and link it to  <br/>
my feedback page, but today I got something very sweet, part of which  <br/>
was<br/>
<br/>
&quot;May God bless you with health and happiness in bounty!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because the first one cursed me with karma (yeah, I know; it was the  <br/>
&quot;smiting&quot; that was the curse), and the second one came from India, it  <br/>
seems a good cancel-out action!<br/>
<br/>
The second one is in full here:<br/>

was never really feeling cursed nor in any danger of smiting, because  <br/>
my family is doing so well.  Kirby visited, and here are photos:  <br/>
