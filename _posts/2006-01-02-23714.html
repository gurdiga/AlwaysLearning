(I realize - 8 kids - lots of work - but really it takes probably  <br/>
less than 10 seconds to wipe fingerprints off a mirror and why  <br/>
couldn&#39;t she have just shown the kids how to wipe off their  <br/>
fingerprints, anyway? Or how about just LIVE in a house with  <br/>
fingerprints on the mirror in the bathroom - what&#39;s the big deal  <br/>
about that?)**<br/>
