<div id="ygrps-yiv-1832833616"><div dir="ltr">Does unschooling mean that children won&#39;t learn how to accept delayed gratification? This question doesn&#39;t come from me, but from a relative who is concerned our children will grow up expecting to get everything they want as soon as they want it. I don&#39;t believe they will and I&#39;m not about to say &#39;no&#39; to them just so they learn a lesson in delayed gratification &lt;am picturing myself saying &#39;no&#39;, then looking at my watch for a prescribed amount of time, then saying &#39;yes, OK, you can now&#39; to requests from the children :D&gt; but I didn&#39;t know how to answer him.</div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1684575719"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;concerned our children will grow up expecting to get everything they<br/>
&gt; want as soon as they want it.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Life gives us all limits whether we&#39;re insanely wealthy or living with less means.  Nobody can have everything they want whenever they want it.  Most people learn to adapt to that reality.  <br/>
<br/>
I believe that when arbitrary limits are imposed, problems arise.  That&#39;s not because a person does not have the ability to accept reality.  It&#39;s because reality has been purposefully distorted for the benefit of one person over another.  And, when that person, who is at the mercy of those arbitrary rules challenges those limits, we call them names like greedy, impulsive, never satisfied, etc. <br/>
<br/>
When I was first beginning to learn about unschooling, I didn&#39;t talk with family or casual friends about what we were doing.  With most people, I kept my dialogue surrounding our homeschooling vague and positive.  That helped to keep questions to a minimum until I had enough understanding and accumulated evidence to be able to talk about our lives with conviction and proof of concept.    <br/>
<br/>
For now, read Pam Larrichia&#39;s book, as Sandra suggested (it&#39;s excellent), and really watch your children learn - learn about everything.  The more you understand their learning, the more you will understand the nature of learning.  Consequently, the easier it will become to answer other people&#39;s questions, or dodge them as you see fit.<br/>
