<div id="ygrps-yiv-99445098">&quot;I wanted to ask if you liked the eyetoy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I know this wasn&#39;t aimed at me, but my kids have LOVED theirs. Their grandparents bought it for Christmas (with my help) and I think they got their $50 worth in the first day!<br/>
It&#39;s hilarious watching someone play if you just look at the person and not the screen. Quite amusing.:)<br/>
