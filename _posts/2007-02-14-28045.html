Would that be a tragedy? I have a friend who is a CPA who counts on <br/>
her fingers. Anything bigger, she uses a calculator. She almost <br/>
never tries to figure in her head - certainly not when she&#39;s working.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m beginning to get it.<br/>
What about meeting the high school exit exam criteria in California?<br/>
Is it legal not to? Is it wise not to? Is that where self motivation may<br/>
kick in?<br/>

What are you really asking.  Please try to look at your question from  <br/>
other directions.<br/>
<br/>
You seem literally to be asking whether one&#39;s failing an exam is  <br/>
breaking a law.<br/>
<br/>
Is it legal for people to move to California from other states?  Do  <br/>
they need a GED or high school diploma to do so?<br/>
Is it legal for people in California to get jobs or go to junior  <br/>
colleges before they are &quot;out of high school&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
If you want to look at laws instead of how learning works, this isn&#39;t  <br/>
probably the best place for you.<br/>

Deborah, we live in California, too, and our three unschooled  <br/>
daughters all started college without any high school diploma. My 22  <br/>
year old is in her last semester of college now - graduates in May.  <br/>
My 19 yo has 120 college credits with a GPA of 3.99 and is deciding  <br/>
what university she wants to attend (she&#39;s at a community college -  <br/>
has been taking courses there since she was 13). My 16 year old takes  <br/>
community college classes, too.<br/>
<br/>
Self-motivation doesn&#39;t suddenly &quot;kick in,&quot; by the way. Kids who have  <br/>
had their interested thoroughly supported just assume that following  <br/>
their own interests is what makes sense to do in life. I suppose  <br/>
that&#39;ll look like &quot;self-motivation&quot; - but, to an unschooler, that&#39;s  <br/>
the only kind of motivation that really exists.<br/>
