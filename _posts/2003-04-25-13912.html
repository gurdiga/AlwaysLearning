<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Self-Improvement&#39;<br/>
<br/>
  Just before she flew off like a swan<br/>
  to her wealthy parents&#39; summer home,<br/>
  Bruce&#39;s college girlfriend asked him<br/>
  to improve his expertise at oral sex,<br/>
  and offered him some technical advice:<br/>
<br/>
  Use nothing but his tonguetip<br/>
  to flick the light switch in his room<br/>
  on and off a hundred times a day<br/>
  until he grew fluent at the nuances<br/>
  of force and latitude.<br/>
<br/>
  Imagine him at practice every evening,<br/>
  more inspired than he ever was at algebra,<br/>
  beads of sweat sprouting on his brow,<br/>
  thinking, thirty-seven, thirty-eight,<br/>
  seeing, in the tunnel vision of his mind&#39;s eye,<br/>
  the quadratic equation of her climax<br/>
  yield to the logic<br/>
  of his simple math.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe he unscrewed<br/>
  the bulb from his apartment ceiling<br/>
  so that passersby would not believe<br/>
  a giant firefly was pulsing<br/>
  its electric abdomen in 13 B.<br/>
<br/>
  Maybe, as he stood<br/>
  two inches from the wall,<br/>
  in darkness, fogging the old plaster<br/>
  with his breath, he visualized the future<br/>
  as a mansion standing on the shore<br/>
  that he was rowing to<br/>
  with his tongue&#39;s exhausted oar.<br/>
<br/>
  Of course, the girlfriend dumped him:<br/>
  met someone, apres-ski, who,<br/>
  using nothing but his nose<br/>
  could identify the vintage of a Cabernet.<br/>
<br/>
  Sometimes we are asked<br/>
  to get good at something we have<br/>
  no talent for,<br/>
  or we excel at something we will never<br/>
  have the opportunity to prove.<br/>
<br/>
  Often we ask ourselves<br/>
  to make absolute sense<br/>
  out of what just happens,<br/>
  and in this way, what we are practicing<br/>
<br/>
  is suffering,<br/>
  which everybody practices,<br/>
  but strangely few of us<br/>
  grow graceful in.<br/>
<br/>
  The climaxes of suffering are complex,<br/>
  costly, beautiful, but secret.<br/>
  Bruce never played the light switch again.<br/>
<br/>
  So the avenues we walk down,<br/>
  full of bodies wearing faces,<br/>
  are full of hidden talent:<br/>
  enough to make pianos moan,<br/>
  sidewalks split,<br/>
  streetlights deliriously flicker.<br/>
<br/>
  	-- Tony Hoagland<br/>
<br/>
This poem is from a book of poems I was reading two nights ago, called<br/>
Donkey Gospel. And I was rolling in the aisles and speaking in tongues<br/>
when I was done as it was just a magnificient take on living (perhaps<br/>
living in America), full of humor and irony.<br/>
<br/>
And Self Improvement speaks volumes of a lot of things: relationships<br/>
atleast the pathetic aspect of them, the whole self improvement creed,<br/>
hidden talents and the need for zany poetry to illumine all of these.<br/>
<br/>
Run this!<br/>
