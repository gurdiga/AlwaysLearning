<div id="ygrps-yiv-1791944367">&quot;I probably wouldn&#39;t have been so <br/>
easily influenced by my friends either.  I can easily see how in a true <br/>
unschooling home where all are given respect and personal freedom, a <br/>
young teen would feel comfortable enough to *not* engage in sex <br/>
physically.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
A factor I haven&#39;t seen discussed is the whole peer pressure issue. Kids that attend school all their lives are hugely affected by what their friends think (most of them anyway). I remember doing things just because my friends had tried it or because they pushed me to do something before I was ready.<br/>
I&#39;m fairly sure I wouldn&#39;t have tried pot or cloves if it hadn&#39;t been for the fact that I wanted to look &quot;cool&quot;. I found myself in some very unsafe situations due to peer pressure.<br/>
