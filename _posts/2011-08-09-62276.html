Have you heard it on this list?<br/>
Can you quote it in context, please?<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t defend every use of &quot;letting go.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Are they talking about letting go of the need to control and manage other peoples&#39; lives?<br/>
Letting go of schoolishness?<br/>

If you&#39;re imagining your kids always at your side, always coming to you with questions or for help, then you may find you need to do some &quot;letting go&quot; of those expectations. Unschooling kids don&#39;t necessarily turn to their parents for everything - often as they get older they trust their own judgement and make decisions without checking in with mom and dad first. If that&#39;s the kind of thing you&#39;re worried about, Ronnie Maier has some nice blog posts on the subject of unschooling with teens (scroll down aways):<br/>

<br/>
Are you equating &quot;let go&quot; with the idea of pushing children to be more independent than they want to be? If other parents - school parents - are telling you to &quot;let go&quot; then that might be what they&#39;re talking about. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My apologies, I was not referring to anything posted on this list.  My son is 8.  The circle of friends I have, have children around that age as well.  What I hear a from many of these parents, and parents of older children, is that this is the age we need to begin to let go.      <br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are they talking about letting go of the need to control and manage other peoples&#39; lives?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I think that must be it.  I have heard it and wondered what we should be letting go of.  I wanted to respond, but I didn&#39;t understand the sentiment.  It just felt sad to me.  Not that I haven&#39;t had my share of needing to &quot;let go&quot; of my own control issues.  I still do.  I think it is the way it is said that confused me a bit.  &quot;Our children are growing up now.  We need to learn to let go.&quot;</div>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, I think I am worried about that, now that I read this.  I was imagining and hoping for a growing level of self-confidence in our son that would allow him to make is own choices, but perhaps the reality of that happening is harder for me to accept than I realize.  Thanks for the link.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Almost all of our friends have schooled children.  Other families homeschool, but do not unschool.  My days are so great.  I love the time I get to spend with our son.  We are so close.  I am not afraid of Ethan&#39;s independence.  I want that for him, (although, as I said above, there may be some fears I need to address there).  I think I am saddened by the thought of losing our connection.</div>

<br/>
Oh.  Schools tell them that.  If you&#39;re talking about school kids, parents recite &quot;parents need to let go of their kids.&quot; It means break the bonds, so kids aren&#39;t homesick when they&#39;re at school.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re talking about school-at-home, I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re talking about unschooling, more likely it would be &quot;detach&quot; from expectations or false images of how it might be, in favor of seeing what really is (with your kids, their personalities, your home and resources).<br/>

If you are saddened, then he has a sad mom.  You&#39;re losing your connection by being sad.<br/>

The result of being sad now about things that haven&#39;t happened is that neither the present nor the future will be as good as if you can find ways to be happy now.<br/>

<br/>
There is no automatic loss of connection as kids get older. In regular parenting there often is--but it&#39;s usually because kids need to push back against their parents in order to make room for their growing sense of selves. If they encounter resistance, they push.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a flexible, connected relationship, as your child requires more room for his &quot;self&quot; to expand, you can react by moving back to allow for it. But there doesn&#39;t need to be any loss of connection. In fact, I have a growing sense of connection with my teens as they become bigger and bigger people, in all senses. It&#39;s so much better than I could have ever imagined.<br/>
