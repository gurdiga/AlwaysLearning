&lt;&lt; He should also give the birthday boy a gift<br/>
from dumbledore--lemondrops.  Wrap them with<br/>
a note saying these are great muggle candies. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We did this--<br/>
a black satin bag with big fancy lemondrops, and a speech from Hagrid with <br/>
the presentation.  Thanks for the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
It went pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Turned out this was the birthday boy&#39;s 15 birthday, and most of the kids <br/>
there were 13-16.  Most had read the books, a few hadn&#39;t.  He had four <br/>
siblings, one older and three younger, and they each had a friend or two <br/>
there too.<br/>
<br/>
In his pockets, &quot;Hagrid&quot; had a mostly-pink umbrella (pink and goldish brown, <br/>
which I got for $3 from a thrift store, one broken spoke (whatever those <br/>
things are called), and it didn&#39;t show when it was in the pocket.   A <br/>
dragon&#39;s egg in its own pocket, which he brought out a few times.  Candy, <br/>
sausages (two kinds of small sausage which he had wrapped in paper towels to <br/>
get some of the grease out, but then put them in unwrapped, with...), four <br/>
rabbit-fur mice from the pet section (which he ended up giving away to <br/>
teenaged girls), a squeaky animal of some gopher-looking sort (made sounds if <br/>
you squeezed it), ribbon candy, balls of leather strips, and maybe that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
When we first got there, it looked like there were uniformed waitresses.  <br/>
Then we figured out the girls had dressed in their idea of school uniforms.  <br/>
They looked like Japanese animation schoolgirls--knee socks, dark <br/>
mini-skirts, white blouses and soft bow ties.  Most of the boys were wearing <br/>
white shirts, slacks and ties.  So the guests pulled their parts off pretty <br/>
well.<br/>
<br/>
The birthday boy thought he was coming to help some of the other teens cater <br/>
a party, because we were at a restaurant downtown, and several of his friends <br/>
work for a catering company, so not only was that plausible but they could <br/>
tell HIM to wear a white shirt and tie!<br/>
<br/>
So he showed up, we were all there, the tables were set in a big U shape, <br/>
with a head chair in the center, and after &quot;surprise&quot; and a speech from <br/>
Hagrid:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve a message from Professor Dumbledore.<br/>
<br/>
Fine man, Dumbledore.<br/>
<br/>
And he sent a message.<br/>
<br/>
As he has been detained,<br/>
at a meeting,<br/>
a really important meeting,<br/>
at the ministry of Magic,<br/>
         oh I probably shouldn&#39;t have said that...<br/>
<br/>
he wishes for that young Peter whose birthday it is to preside over this meal <br/>
in his stead.<br/>
 <br/>
---------<br/>
<br/>
Most of that was said just like that, and then he said that the others would <br/>
be seated by the sorting hat. <br/>
<br/>
So they had a chair and a hat, and it would say one of the four houses (to <br/>
the four tables coming down--two on one side and two on the other) or &quot;head <br/>
table.&quot;  Pretty much &quot;head table&quot; was the adults and Peter&#39;s best friends.  <br/>
It didn&#39;t work out perfectly, but fairly so.<br/>
<br/>
The room was big (a former storefront at 6th and Central/old Rt. 66, so nice <br/>
ceilings, fireplace, big water fall, forest of a dozen or more white-lit <br/>
Christmas trees in the front window.<br/>
<br/>
We had to get them to turn the waterfall off so they could hear this part:  <br/>
When they gathered to cut the cake, which was made by those aforementioned <br/>
catering teenagers, I made a speech (below), but before I asked Hagrid to <br/>
help me out with his umbrella.  He stood on a chair and waved it and pointed <br/>
at people far back, and I read this and then  rolled-up-and-tied-with-ribbon <br/>
copies were distributed out of a basket, to the kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I told them I had a magical gift for Peter and a party favor for everyone <br/>
there, but they would have to listen because it worked with words and thought.<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
If I could make your entire lives easy and better, I would, but I can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So for one year, I can give you this:  <br/>
<br/>
The easy remembrance of joy and of duty.<br/>
<br/>
Whether you are muggle or wizard,<br/>
whatever house you&#39;re in at Hogwart&#39;s<br/>
whatever religion or belief you have,<br/>
your goal is the same:  <br/>
<br/>
To be a help to others and to appreciate the goodness around you.<br/>
<br/>
You have opportunities every day to do good.<br/>
You have the ability to make other lives better along with your own,  <br/>
Today; tonight; tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Let trees remind you to live and breathe in the sky, not in the dust.<br/>
Let the wind remind you that life moves us and changes us.<br/>
Let the sunshine remind you that warmth flows through you and from you.<br/>
<br/>
Meet life with courage and conviction.<br/>
Be a source of goodness and joy.<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
It was really well received, and kids were making sure they got copies and <br/>
put them in a safe place.  I had expected more cynicism and less attention <br/>
than I got.  <br/>
<br/>
Then we ate cake, hung out, went home.<br/>
<br/>
Oh--I was wearing a long black dress and a witch&#39;s hat I made in 1978 or so, <br/>
which has mostly lived in the kids&#39; costume box, but this year for Halloween <br/>
it was refurbished and got a crescent-moon-motif  hatband.  I had a black <br/>
belt with a magnifying glass hanging from it, and carried a recorder and a <br/>
gold-covered binder, in which were the trivia questions, the blessing bit <br/>
above, and the music from a Christmas performance years ago.  That&#39;s how I <br/>
was able to read my message without it being tacky--it was in the same book <br/>
we had used for the trivia contest.<br/>
<br/>
It was fun being in a place with Senator Domenici and being photographed more <br/>
than he was.  (There were few cameras; I couldn&#39;t find mine when we left, and <br/>
my friend Kathy had an electronic thing which wasn&#39;t working, but her <br/>
sister-in-law took some and maybe someday I&#39;ll see one.)<br/>
<br/>
The trivia questions were written first by Kathy (my friend Kathy, who&#39;s <br/>
married to Pete Domenici Jr., but used to be married to another guy named <br/>
Hoag, and her oldest three kids were toddler and 6 when Kirby was born--she <br/>
was a LLL leader, and in the babysitting co-op we were in), but she hadn&#39;t <br/>
read the books and the questions were pretty much unworkable so I redid and <br/>
added, late Sunday afternoon.  But she did come up with some good loot to <br/>
give people who answered them correctly.    Because of the size and noise <br/>
factor in the room, we were able to ask some to a house on one side of the <br/>
room, and those on the other side hadn&#39;t heard.  We had Gringotts with <br/>
bubblegum in them (they came in bags, but we broke out about ten bags of <br/>
them; Holly inherited the bags) and some wands full of candy).  <br/>
<br/>
The birthday boy was the expert, all said, so we didn&#39;t let him answer most <br/>
of the time, but he was the one to get the hardest question.  We asked the <br/>
whole room and he was the only one who know.<br/>
<br/>
And we distributed the last of the cool gum-coins so that everyone got at <br/>
least one.<br/>
<br/>
The questions:<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Peter whose birthday it was got it close--he said &quot;Never touch a sleeping <br/>
dragon.&quot;)</div>

Sounds like it was a great time! I wish I could&#39;ve been there! <br/>
<br/>
And I would&#39;ve brought our sorting hat. I even thought of shipping it out to <br/>
you next day air, but....   Anyway, it&#39;s double-thick with a baby monitor <br/>
sewn inside. There MUST be an accomplice, but it actually speaks! You <br/>
should&#39;ve seen the looks on the first faces that ever wore it!. I LOVE magic! <br/>
This was one of Cameron&#39;s props when he did his Harry Potter show 2 years <br/>
ago, and he sorted several &quot;first years&quot; at each show. He also does a cute <br/>
trick with spider web cards to a &quot;Ron&quot;, and one where an empty caudron is <br/>
suddenly filled with jelly beans. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry he&#39;s lost interest, because that story lends itself so well to <br/>
great kids&#39; magic!<br/>

<br/>
That is so cool.<br/>
This one, someone from behind just read what house.  It was like table <br/>
arrangement in advance and the mom had made a cool kind-calligraphed long <br/>
scroll with the names and houses.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Your speech was beautifully written.<br/>
I am going to make a copy.<br/>
I&#39;m assuming that since you posted it we can do that?<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Sure, have it!<br/>
