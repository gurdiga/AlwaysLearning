Yes, Sandra, John Holt deserves much credit for making Homeschooling <br/>
popular.<br/>
But John was a preceded by Ivan Illich with whom he became a close <br/>
colleague.<br/>
Both were driven by their concern that education trapped society into <br/>
the status quo.<br/>
In 1970 Ivan wrote &quot;Deschooling Society&quot; the message of which has been <br/>
largely lost by by modern homeschoolers.<br/>
Below is a review of that seminal book.  I wrote it on Ivan&#39;s death. It <br/>
may have some relevance to you valuable work.<br/>

&gt; Review: Illich on &quot;Deschooling Society:<br/>
&gt; By Bill Ellis<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Before I read of Ivan Illich&#39;s death I had started to write a <br/>
&gt; commentary on his contributions and ideas of &quot;Deschooling Society.&quot; I <br/>
&gt; have felt that many homeschoolers and even many Illich fans miss the <br/>
&gt; message he was trying to deliver. Perhaps my own interpretation is <br/>
&gt; enhanced by the numerous opportunities I had to talk with him, hear <br/>
&gt; his lectures, and visit with his &quot;traveling crap game&quot; that met in <br/>
&gt; various universities around the globe. Or it may be that his way of <br/>
&gt; developing an idea was to stimulate the listener&#39;s own thought, rather <br/>
&gt; than to lay an idea out so clearly that every one captured exactly the <br/>
&gt; same message. Now that Ivan has passed on I am driven to make this <br/>
&gt; piece a bit longer than it was originally drafted.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Deschooling Society&quot; was more about society than about schools. <br/>
&gt; Society needed deschooling because it was a mime of the school system <br/>
&gt; that it engendered and that engendered it. In our current society <br/>
&gt; individuals are expected to work in dull and stultifying jobs for <br/>
&gt; future rewards. This they are trained to do in schools. They go to <br/>
&gt; school so that they can get a job to work for future rewards.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By deschooling illich did not mean taking schooling into the home, nor <br/>
&gt; did he mean &quot;free schools&quot; in which a curricula was set by the <br/>
&gt; students. Schooling of any kind that limited a person&#39;s capacity and <br/>
&gt; desire to self-learn was detrimental to the living a full life by that <br/>
&gt; person.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; All life, according to Illich, should be &quot;convivial.&quot; That is it <br/>
&gt; should be lived in joyous collaboration with friends and colleagues. <br/>
&gt; Learning and work alike should be fun and fulfilling. They should be <br/>
&gt; entered into as, and not differentiated from, play and recreation. A <br/>
&gt; society that does not create that kind of convivial learning and <br/>
&gt; living is not living up to, nor fulfilling the potential of, humanity.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In later works, like &quot;Tools for Conviviality,&quot; and &quot;Shadow Work,&quot; <br/>
&gt; Illich developed further the theme of what he meant by living the good <br/>
&gt; life. He took &quot;good&quot; in both of its connotations, -- good as moral, <br/>
&gt; and good as a pleasing. &quot;Vernacular&quot; was the word Illich used to <br/>
&gt; express the good life. The vernacular is the simple, the local, the <br/>
&gt; communal. Every human and every community has its own natural concept <br/>
&gt; of the vernacular. It is wrapped up in being a human. It is what a <br/>
&gt; person can do themselves in the place the are at the time it is <br/>
&gt; without dependence of external assistance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The bicycle was the hardware example Illich often used to exemplify <br/>
&gt; the vernacular. The bicycle extends one&#39;s own capability and efforts <br/>
&gt; for transportation. It needs no massive outside system beyond that its <br/>
&gt; operator&#39;s control. The automobile, on the other hand, is not only a <br/>
&gt; complex apparatus requires a complex outside system, but it also <br/>
&gt; requires more work and effort than it produces in transportation. If <br/>
&gt; you take into account all the hours you spend to buy a car, to <br/>
&gt; purchase gas and tires, to pay taxes for the road, to insure and <br/>
&gt; license it, to clean up its pollution, and pay for all of the other <br/>
&gt; costs your rate of travel is less than that of a bicycle, and that <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t count either the hours, the costs, or the frustration spent in <br/>
&gt; traffic jams and accidents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In &quot;Medical Nemesis&quot; took the same concept to the medical system <br/>
&gt; showing that not only did the medical not cure ills but in created <br/>
&gt; them. In every aspects of our lives conviviality and the vernacular <br/>
&gt; have been overwhelmed and diminished by what Illich called the <br/>
&gt; &quot;disabling professions.&quot; The law professions have increased crime, the <br/>
&gt; professional economists have created scarcity and poverty, the <br/>
&gt; teaching profession has dumbed us down, the farming profession has <br/>
&gt; incrased hunger. With this loss of the vernacular has come the loss of <br/>
&gt; the family and the community. The single goal of humans has become to <br/>
&gt; &quot;make it&quot; in a materialistic global economy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In his most recent essays Illich has brought his concepts to a fitting <br/>
&gt; climax. An essay &quot;The Cultivation of Conspiracy&quot; in &quot;The Challenge of <br/>
&gt; Ivan Illich&quot; a 2002 book of a collection of essays by many of his <br/>
&gt; colleagues edited by Lee Honacki and Carl Mitcham. This essay <br/>
&gt; discusses friendship. The friendship Illich writes of is not just that <br/>
&gt; of being kind and cooperative to you neighbors. It is a deeper <br/>
&gt; &#39;conspiriatio&#39;. As in much of his writing Illich goes to great length <br/>
&gt; to explore the original meaning and related ideas and actions related <br/>
&gt; to the word. &quot;Conspiriatio&quot; is breathing together. But breathing is <br/>
&gt; not merely expelling air. It is about the breath of life -- the soul. <br/>
&gt; &#39;Conspiriatio&#39; is the melding of one&#39;s inner being with others. It is <br/>
&gt; best exemplified by the wedding kiss that symbolizes, or more exactly <br/>
&gt; is, the combining of two souls. It is more than the ceremony or the <br/>
&gt; license of marriage. It is above physical love. It is the unifying of <br/>
&gt; two beings. This conspiratio, or welding of souls, (although Illich, a <br/>
&gt; former priest, doesn&#39;t us the word soul) is the root of the vernacular <br/>
&gt; and of the convivial.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This brief extension of Illich&#39;s concepts is meant only to put his <br/>
&gt; book and the idea of deschooling society into context. Homeschooling <br/>
&gt; grew from the ideas of Illich, Holt and others. During the 1970s a few <br/>
&gt; scattered families broke away from government schools and started <br/>
&gt; homeschooling. By 1980 there were some 10,000 to 20,000 such families <br/>
&gt; homeschooling alone. As the numbers grew these scattered home schools <br/>
&gt; started linking up, establishing organizations to provide resources, <br/>
&gt; and to take on special tasks like the legal defence of homeschooling. <br/>
&gt; By 1990 the cells of homeschooler had become a soup and ad hoc linking <br/>
&gt; became normal. &quot;Homeschool support groups&quot; spontaneously <br/>
&gt; self-organized in many communities and on the Internet. By 2000 there <br/>
&gt; was almost no Ameican community that did not have a Homeschool support <br/>
&gt; group.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But, in the practical day to day struggle to homeschool their own <br/>
&gt; children many, if not most, homeschoolers left behind the social <br/>
&gt; idealism of Illich and Holt. Parents who were imbued with the concept <br/>
&gt; of schooling could not really let their children be free to learn <br/>
&gt; whatever the community and nature offered them. They had been guided <br/>
&gt; by their schools and parents and they believed it only natural to be <br/>
&gt; the guides and authorities for their children. They looked to <br/>
&gt; &quot;experts&quot; to provide school texts and curricula. And exchange <br/>
&gt; information with other parents on how to keep their children&#39;s&gt; noses <br/>
&gt; to the books. Their universal cry is for government to &quot;just leave us <br/>
&gt; alone.&quot; They argued that they have &quot;parental rights&quot; to raise their <br/>
&gt; children as they wish.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As homeschooling is becoming accepted by the mainstream it is also <br/>
&gt; looking again at it roots and recognizing that &quot;homeschooling alone&quot; <br/>
&gt; is not enough. Conviviality and the vernacular are arising within the <br/>
&gt; homeschool support groups. The goal of A Coalition for Self-Learning <br/>
&gt; is to bring the concept of deschooling society into real being. We <br/>
&gt; seen this transformation as being necessary for the survival of <br/>
&gt; humanity. </span></blockquote></div>
