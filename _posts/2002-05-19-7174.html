My mother occasionally used to complain about chiggers as she scratched <br/>
under the elastic waistband of her pants. I didn&#39;t think we had chiggers <br/>
up north and assumed something else was bothering her, but now I&#39;m <br/>
thinking she knew what she was talking about.<br/>

push while they bury themselves in your flesh. :-(<br/>
They are another arachnid.  A mite. Like Sandra&#39;s red<br/>
spiders, only tiny. I think they are everywhere. More<br/>
here, less there. They like some flavors (people)<br/>
better than others.<br/>

<br/>
I used to have skin irritations when I was little, and elastic was bad.  It <br/>
seems to me in retrospect that I was allergic to my own perspiration, and <br/>
elastic gave it NO chance of escape, and the skin couldn&#39;t stretch out there, <br/>
under the elastic.  Nylon was bad for same-ish reasons.<br/>

<br/>
Chiggers get you around elastic, like your bra, pantylines, sock tops, etc..<br/>
Adriane was bit up all over and scratching.  The infection was rapidly<br/>
spreading by the time we figured out it was an infection.<br/>
