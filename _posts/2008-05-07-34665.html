<div id="ygrps-yiv-1455729128">I thought I would share my blog post for today here. I think I have been<br/>
growing in unschooling with leaps and bounds lately (although I still have a<br/>
long ways to go) and wanted to share my &quot;aha&quot; moment.<br/>
<br/>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking about Mothers Day lately.<br/>
<br/>
 Typically on Mother&#39;s Day I go into &quot;martyr thinking&quot;. My dear and devoted<br/>
husband wouldn&#39;t know romance if it bit him on the butt so generally<br/>
speaking, I don&#39;t get anything. I might get something if I whine about how I<br/>
didn&#39;t get anything, but then it feels like he&#39;s just doing it to get me to<br/>
shut up so it doesn&#39;t mean anything.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I got to thinking about the purpose of Mother&#39;s Day. What is it?<br/>
Well, of course, everyone knows that it is a day to honor mothers.  To show<br/>
them how much you appreciate them, right?<br/>
<br/>
Why do I need/want one day every year to celebrate being a mother? One day<br/>
to know that i am appreciated by those whom I care for? ONE DAY? You have to<br/>
be kidding me. I started rethinking that. I don&#39;t want ONE day. I want to<br/>
know I am appreciated every day. I don&#39;t need a diamond ring or a piece of<br/>
paper that tells me that. I need to look at my family in a different way. I<br/>
need to see the ways that they tell me they love me EVERY SINGLE DAY!<br/>
<br/>
 So, I started yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
My first &quot;Mother&#39;s Day&quot; was marked by the fact that my two beautiful, very<br/>
social daughters who are unschooled (and since we haven&#39;t had a car in<br/>
several weeks we haven&#39;t been able to make it to local meetings)  turned<br/>
down playing with the local schooled neighborhood kids (whom they have been<br/>
playing with every day for the last 2+ weeks, might I add so they aren&#39;t not<br/>
getting *any* social interaction right now) to make slime with their mom.<br/>
What a compliment to hear them tell the kids to go home because they are<br/>
doing a project with mom. It warmed my heart.<br/>

<br/>
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>
So, after thinking about all this, I had to look up Mother&#39;s Day on<br/>
wikipedia and got to learn the history of Mother&#39;s Day.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother&#39;s_Day">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother&#39;s_Day</a><br/>
<br/>
Here is some interesting information on it...<br/>
<br/>
 At first, it was to honor the Gods in Roman and Greek times. Here&#39;s how it<br/>
came about in the US.<br/>
<br/>
*The United States celebrates Mother&#39;s Day on the second Sunday in May. In<br/>
the United States &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States</a>&gt;, Mother&#39;s Day<br/>
was loosely inspired by the British day and was imported by social<br/>
activist Julia<br/>
Ward Howe &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_Ward_Howe</a>&gt; after the American<br/>
Civil War &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War</a>&gt;. However, it was<br/>
intended as a call to unite women against war. In 1870, she wrote the Mother&#39;s<br/>
Day Proclamation<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day_Proclamation">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother%27s_Day_Proclamation</a>&gt;as a call<br/>
for peace and disarmament. Howe failed in her attempt to get<br/>
formal recognition of a Mother&#39;s Day for Peace. Her idea was influenced by Ann<br/>
Jarvis &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Jarvis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ann_Jarvis</a>&gt;, a young Appalachian<br/>
homemaker who, starting in 1858, had attempted to improve sanitation through<br/>
what she called Mothers&#39; Work Days. She organized women throughout the Civil<br/>
War to work for better sanitary conditions for both sides, and in 1868 she<br/>
began work to reconcile Union and Confederate neighbors.*<br/>
<br/>
*When Jarvis died in 1907, her daughter, named Anna<br/>
Jarvis&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Jarvis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Jarvis</a>&gt;,<br/>
started the crusade to found a memorial day for women. The first such<br/>
Mother&#39;s Day was celebrated in Grafton, West<br/>
Virginia&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton%2C_West_Virginia">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grafton%2C_West_Virginia</a>&gt;,<br/>
on 10 May &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_10">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_10</a>&gt;<br/>
1908&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1908">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1908</a>&gt;,<br/>
in the church where the elder Ann Jarvis had taught Sunday School.<br/>
Originally the Andrews Methodist Episcopal Church, this building is now the<br/>
International Mother&#39;s Day Shrine (a National Historic<br/>
Landmark&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Historic_Landmark</a>&gt;).<br/>
From there, the custom caught on ï¿½ spreading eventually to 45 states. The<br/>
holiday was declared officially by some states beginning in 1912. In 1914<br/>
President Woodrow Wilson<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodrow_Wilson</a>&gt;declared the first<br/>
national Mother&#39;s Day, as a day for American citizens to<br/>
show the flag in honor of those mothers whose sons had died in war.*<br/>
<br/>
*Nine years after the first official Mother&#39;s Day, commercialization of the<br/>
U.S. holiday became so rampant that Anna Jarvis herself became a major<br/>
opponent of what the holiday had become. Mother&#39;s Day continues to this day<br/>
to be one of the most commercially successful U.S. occasions. According to<br/>
the National Restaurant<br/>
Association&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Restaurant_Association">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Restaurant_Association</a>&gt;,<br/>
Mother&#39;s Day is now the most popular day of the year to dine out at a<br/>
restaurant in the United States.*<br/>
<br/>
 So much for that idea, lol!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1717946819">I loved this post.  I like the way you are choosing to see the little ways<br/>
each day that your family appreciates you.  The history of mother&#39;s day was<br/>
interesting. I like the original reason for the celebration. <br/>

<br/>
Originally, I think it involved a pancake breakfast moms didn&#39;t have  <br/>
to make.  In England.  What&#39;s that called?  There&#39;s a pancake day.   <br/>
It wasn&#39;t called &quot;Mother&#39;s Day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And now it&#39;s restaurants, because families won&#39;t even make some  <br/>
friggin&#39; PANCAKES.<br/>
<br/>
Now I&#39;m feeling like a martyr.<br/>
<br/>
(Just joking.)<br/>
<br/>
I reminded my husband to get his mom a card, as usual.  I picked it  <br/>
out while he stood around, and then he approved it, as usual.   For  <br/>
mother&#39;s day every year for most of 30 years, I&#39;ve helped make sure I  <br/>
could keep access to my Keith (he wasn&#39;t my husband for all of those  <br/>
years) in peace by helping him placate his mother.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing that, I don&#39;t mind when Keith reminds the kids to do something  <br/>
for mother&#39;s day and they say &quot;Like what?&quot;  Sometimes I get cards or  <br/>
little gifts, but usually I get a sweet little speech about them not  <br/>
knowing what to do or give me and me saying I&#39;m just glad we&#39;re all  <br/>
together in peace and love or something equally &quot;I don&#39;t know either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Feeling needy can happen even with grown women, and Amanda&#39;s right  <br/>
that the best thing to do is the find ways to be grateful and  <br/>
fulfilled rather than empty and expectant and disappointed and pissed  <br/>
off.<br/>
