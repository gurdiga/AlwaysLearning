their parents.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When I read this I remembered an incident last year when I attended a  <br/>
ukelele group playing at a retirement village.  My daughter (7) loves  <br/>
to dance and she started dancing in front of the players (some of whom  <br/>
she knew) and was becoming very vigorous.  When I asked her to dance  <br/>
less vigorously, she could not . . . would not . . . and the scene  <br/>
continued to develop with myself and others becoming increasingly  <br/>
uncomfortable and me continuing to ask her to dance more calmly.  I  <br/>
also had my smaller son (2) and another girl (6) who I was tending  <br/>
with cups of juice and snacks etc. One of the carers asked me to stop  <br/>
the children dancing as it was disturbing some of the residents (some  <br/>
were smiling and enjoying the dancing and some were looking  <br/>
strained).  In that situation I found myself stuck, unable to find a  <br/>
solution because I was also scared of my daughter&#39;s reaction to my  <br/>
asking her to stop dancing.  And indeed, when I said that she must  <br/>
stop now, she stormed off and become very angry and said she was never  <br/>
going to dance again and that she hated that place. Afterwards I felt  <br/>
as if I had really failed her and the other people in the environment  <br/>
and I did not have any clarity about how I could have better managed  <br/>
the situation.  I have been in many situations where she is very  <br/>
respectful of all kinds of protocols but in this instance it was not  <br/>
so.  At the time I was (and still am!) struggling quite a bit with  <br/>
understanding how to speak to my daughter when I know that she is  <br/>
sensitive to being corrected - that correction usually results in her  <br/>
becoming angry.<br/>
<br/>
I am wondering if you have any thoughts about this.  And why that  <br/>
sensitivity to correction, or indeed, the need for it, might be  <br/>
arising.  Perhaps that is too vague a question but I am not sure how  <br/>
to ask anything more precise at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
with thanks<br/>

I think I would have picked her up, dance with her over to the back corner of the room, danced with her a bit, and said &quot;You can dance here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is just a question for you to consider; you don&#39;t need to tell us anything:   <br/>

<br/>
Did you way &quot;you must stop now&quot;?<br/>
Or did you say, &quot;Hey, Becky, dance back here!&quot; (or whatever her name is).<br/>
<br/>
How would you have dealt with an adult friend you had taken if she started dancing in an inappropriate place or way?  I doubt you would have said &quot;you must stop now.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It may help to move away from the idea of &quot;correction&quot; and instead consider alternatives to what she&#39;s doing - other ways she could enjoy herself in the moment. The trouble, in a way, is that you&#39;re getting stuck moving her Away from what she&#39;s doing (have Less fun, please) - it&#39;s much, much easier to mover Toward something interesting. So look for that. <br/>
<br/>
Depending on her personality, you might have a bag of tricks for distracting her - bubbles, sidewalk chalk, snacks... an assortment of fun little things to occupy a few minutes and change the dynamic. Or you might swoop in merrily with a big kiss and dance her off out of the way. Or you could offer to go get ice-cream. Something of that nature. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>It can be challenging to juggle the needs of active kids along with the needs of more relaxed kids. If your daughter is often the boisterous child who needs more attention, then it&#39;s not a good idea to volunteer to take care of other children. Similarly, if you have a pretty active kid, it could be best to avoid places like senior centers and retirement homes for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
In the moment, perhaps you could have asked someone else to keep an eye on the two having snacks while you went to your daughter, or perhaps started packing things up sooner, the first time you told her to calm down and she didn&#39;t - not in a punitive way, but so you could swoop all three kids out of the place quickly. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496820255">I wonder if you&#39;re waiting too long to step in.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of her dancing wildly, it sounds like you sort of knew where it<br/>
was leading and you felt pretty helpless about it. So it went on until it<br/>
was bad enough to be really annoying others and then you called an abrupt<br/>
halt at a point when she&#39;d built up a lot of intense energy.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s sensitive to being corrected ... maybe you regularly wait too long so<br/>
that by the time you &quot;correct&quot; her, it is too late for her not to be in the<br/>
wrong, she&#39;s already BEEN in the wrong, so she&#39;s embarrassed.<br/>
<br/>
If dancing was not appropriate there, for some reason (I&#39;m not clear about<br/>
that, but taking your word for it), then you should probably have handled<br/>
it the minute she started to dance.<br/>
<br/>
If you couldn&#39;t (because you had your hands full already with other kids)<br/>
then I wonder, too, if you&#39;re getting yourselves into situations that are<br/>
too much for you to handle and you should spend more time at parks and<br/>
playgrounds and other open spaces where kids can be kids and not at events<br/>
like this. You have lot of time in the future for these kinds of<br/>
activities. Your daughter would have been better off at home with some high<br/>
energy music playing and lots of room to dance to her heart&#39;s content. So -<br/>
what&#39;s the point of this kind of outing if it is likely to result in her<br/>
being angry and upset at the end?<br/>
