<div id="ygrps-yiv-798472244">**I hail from Californie and would ask the same question as Sandra. <br/>
Whichpart? I live in the Bay Area (Silicon Valley) about an hour south <br/>
of San Francisco. The Bay Area is home to about 6 million people which <br/>
make unschooling great.**<br/>

Hi, Dana --<br/>
<br/>
I just want to mention that I attend a San Jose / Sunnyvale park day on <br/>
Tuesdays, even though I now live further north.  It&#39;s not an &quot;all <br/>
unschooling&quot; group, but I really love it.  (It&#39;s an inclusive group, so <br/>
we even include people who want a workbook for everything. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
