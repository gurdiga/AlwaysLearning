Nicely put, Tori.  <br/>
When there is some &quot;correcting&quot; to do, it&#39;s more like coaching—helping a child see WHY it&#39;s good to be more polite.<br/>
<br/>
I used to say my husband had said &quot;We wanted them to grow up undamaged.&quot;  Later I found the exact quote, which was &quot;We wanted our children to become thoughtful, intelligent, undamaged adults.&quot; — Keith Dodd.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to what my mom used to say, the idea that crying is beneficial is a step toward goodness.  She used to say &quot;Stop that crying, or I&#39;ll give you something to cry about.&quot;  I heard some variation of that dozens of times.<br/>
<br/>
Compared to what Keith and I said and did and were to our children, planning on what to do when they cry doesn&#39;t make much sense, because we decided early on NOT to give them something to cry about.  Frustrations were few, and soothed by parents.  Crying was fine, but there wasn&#39;t much sorrow.<br/>
<br/>
I cried myself to sleep many times, hungry, afraid.  If one of mine did, it was probably over a problem with a friend, or having broken something they really liked.  And I&#39;m only thinking of two likely possibilities out of the lifetimes of three children.  (Late teens, for Holly, when unrequited love and boyfriends came along, that&#39;s different.)<br/>
