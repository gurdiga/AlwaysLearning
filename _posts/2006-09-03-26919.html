<div id="ygrps-yiv-33234267">I remember seeing &quot;Trading Spouses&quot; a few times and<br/>
noticing how the extreme contrast between the two<br/>
families always made for a lot of drama. Usually they<br/>
would pair up a relatively gentle and laid-back family<br/>
with an extremely neurotic, fanatic, control-freakish<br/>
one. My DS Brian (11) and I were intending to watch<br/>
the episode with the crazy screaming woman, but when<br/>
the last trailerwas playing just before the actual<br/>
episode came on, Brian said &quot;I don&#39;t think I want to<br/>
watch this after all, it looks like it&#39;s going to be<br/>
too violent.&quot; So we changed channels and didn&#39;t watch<br/>
it. It was a great illustration of the difference<br/>
between fantasy violence and reality violence.<br/>
