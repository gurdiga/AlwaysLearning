<div id="ygrps-yiv-567780698">Lexie spoke to the Tustin School Board tonight, regarding a <br/>
homeschooling charter school a friend is trying to start.  She did very <br/>
well.  She said clearly why she wanted the charter school to be there <br/>
for her (our current charter is out of San Diego, so there are no local <br/>
resouces, library, etc.), and how great homeschooling was, and how <br/>
homeschooling allows her to persue her interests like DI, film club, <br/>
etc.  She did very well and represented homeschoolers in a positive light. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just amused that on her next learning record we&#39;ll write public <br/>
speaking at a school board meeting... a homeschooler, speaking at a <br/>
school board meeting.  :-)  Oh wait, maybe we better NOT put that on her <br/>
learning record... she is speaking up for ANOTHER charter.  ;-)<br/>
