<div id="ygrps-yiv-96114520"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;on violent games<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s an idea that&#39;s been playing round in my head<br/>
for some time now, as a mom to boys only.  It&#39;s one I<br/>
have heard various sources hold forth on, both pro and<br/>
con.  As a woman, I cannot know what it&#39;s like to be a<br/>
man.  I can rationalize, I can empathize, I can<br/>
imagine, but I cannot KNOW, on a real experiential<br/>
level.  To me, the violence in entertainment might be<br/>
disturbing, upsetting, scary, etc.  To my boys<br/>
however, who are not female, it may mean something<br/>
altogether different, and may in fact be vital for<br/>
them as a form of expression.  After all, the vast<br/>
majority of the violent games, movies and other medias<br/>
are created by males for other males to enjoy.  <br/>
<br/>
Men DO tend to be more violent than women, with both<br/>
more violent expression in games, movies,<br/>
conversation, aggresive competitive play, sports etc. <br/>
I believe that there is a need for them to express<br/>
this part of their nature in a healthy way, and to. <br/>
There is a time and a place in this world for<br/>
judicious use of force (because we&#39;re not all Eloi in<br/>
a bland paradise) and I hope my boys go through life<br/>
never having to resort to physical self defense, but<br/>
use of force can also take place with words and other<br/>
body language to avoid more physical conflicts. <br/>
<br/>
Allowing men (and baby men) violent outlets in games<br/>
and entertainment helps release that aggressive<br/>
behavior in a healthy way, and helps role play<br/>
appropriate and inappropriate use of force.  I know<br/>
ALL of us moms here have heard our boys remind us<br/>
(with much sighing and eye-rolling) whenever we<br/>
express concern or just go &quot;ewww!&quot; at a violent game<br/>
(with toys, video games, whatever)  &quot;It&#39;s not REAL<br/>
mom!  It&#39;s JUST a GAME!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To a great extent I let my husband (a gentle, strong,<br/>
capable man) take the lead in guiding the boys into<br/>
manhood, or fielding these issues from a man&#39;s point<br/>
of view.  As far as violent games, I don&#39;t think that<br/>
repression and strict control leads to more relaxed<br/>
and less agressive men.  I find it more likely that<br/>
men who feel stifled and bottled up are more likely to<br/>
explode.<br/>

Decades ago, when Pat was my boyfriend, not yet dh, he talked of football games - watching and/or playing - as being a great outlet for aggression.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-403793360">YIKES!!  I just got the EXACT words out of Shea 9yrs, as we were <br/>
cooking dinner tonight!!!  that&#39;s hard to believe, the exact words...<br/>
<br/>
a friend told me that video games are beneficial to the way that boys <br/>
and men problem solve... most game programmers are men, and men just go <br/>
for that kind of problem... we have had the best conversations with <br/>
total strangers about video games, trading tricks and secrets and <br/>
stuff... a common bond I guess...<br/>

couldn&#39;t play video games because he was hopelessly<br/>
lost ALL THE TIME...He had no idea which direction he<br/>
came from and where he was heading.  I said  &quot;It&#39;s<br/>
easy--you just come back the way you came...&quot;--and the<br/>
concept was lost on him.  It&#39;s *not* just a guy thing<br/>

 </span></blockquote>LOL!!  that&#39;s very funny!!  such is the problem of using stereotypes <br/>
and speaking in generalities, it&#39;s most, many, some, but not all... I <br/>
wonder if it&#39;s interest level, experience level, or the game in <br/>
particular that makes it so disorienting... I like to know that kind of <br/>
info, it&#39;s interesting...<br/>
Has anyone tried Pikmin?  we play it on Nintendo Game Cube, mildly bad <br/>
things happen to the little Pikmin characters, it&#39;s mainly strategy, <br/>
finding parts of a whole to exit the game...<br/>

video games was a guy thing, or even that skill at<br/>
them was a guy thing.  I said the violent aspects of<br/>
the games that contain a lot of violence are often a<br/>
good, and I believe needed, outlet for males, created<br/>
by males, and that they often see this aspect<br/>
differently than a female perspective would/does.  If<br/>
video games or video game skill or enjoyment are guy<br/>
things, than I&#39;m in trouble, because I play some of<br/>
them too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi, I&#39;m new to the group. My name is Lilith. I completely agree with<br/>
you. I think violence in games helps not only males but anyone to<br/>
excert their natural drives toward fantasy in an appropriate way,<br/>
instead of acting them out in life. My older son is now six, and has<br/>
understood the difference between games and what is real since he was<br/>
three. My mother gets on to me for allowing him to play violent video<br/>
games, but i don&#39;t think she really understandes the concept of the<br/>
human shadow and how important fantasy is to a mentally healthy<br/>
individual&#39;s functioning.</div>
