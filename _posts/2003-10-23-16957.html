<div id="ygrps-yiv-614743853">I am following this conversation about keeping kids in<br/>
when it&#39;s unsafe to go out alone with interest. <br/>
However, we have the opposite problem, if anyone has<br/>
any helpful suggestions.  <br/>
<br/>
We live in a small home (under 1000 sq. feet) and we<br/>
live way out in the country.  It&#39;s almost a mile down<br/>
our driveway to the mailbox.  Because of all the<br/>
forests, hills and mountains, we cannot see any<br/>
neighbors, except one house, with binoculars, vaguely,<br/>
across the lake, from between two certain trees, while<br/>
standing on a chair in the kitchen.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, my point is, it&#39;s very safe for my children to<br/>
go exploring, go look for frogs in the ankle high<br/>
creek, climb trees and run around, even late at night,<br/>
on our acerage.  Being young, their comfort zone for<br/>
distance they go alone is about what I am comfortable<br/>
with for them as their mom.  In good weather, they may<br/>
go as far as the meadow down the hill from our house,<br/>
maybe 600 yards away.  Most times they stay closer to<br/>
the house.  I have a military whistle I blow on when I<br/>
can&#39;t hear or see them for more than a little bit at a<br/>
time and they let me know where they are when they<br/>
hear it, so I won&#39;t worry.   <br/>
<br/>
Now here&#39;s MY problem.  I can&#39;t get them outside this<br/>
fall!  In fall and winter it rains a fair amount here.<br/>
 When the weather is more mild, I like the kids to go<br/>
outside to play for several reasons:  <br/>
1) They go a bit stir crazy if they don&#39;t get to run<br/>
around outside for a few days in a row if there is<br/>
nasty weather.<br/>
2) They are ACTIVE, rowdy boys, and WE go a bit crazy<br/>
after being cooped up with them for a few days. <br/>
They&#39;re wrestling, screaming, furniture jumping kinda<br/>
rowdy.  There are not many sedentary activities which<br/>
can get them relatively quiet for more than 10 minutes<br/>
at a time.<br/>
3) I use fair weather time to sweep out and air the<br/>
house, beat and air rugs, clean muddy floors, etc and<br/>
so forth.  It&#39;s hard to do this in our small home when<br/>
they are underfoot.<br/>
<br/>
So when it&#39;s mild out I ask the boys to go play<br/>
outside, I try to make it sound really fun, I make<br/>
sure they are dressed to stay a comfortable<br/>
temperature and not get cold in 10 minutes (although<br/>
it&#39;s not THAT cold here.)  I suggest things they might<br/>
play or investigate.  I explain why I need them out of<br/>
the way to mop, or sweep, or change bed linens.  I<br/>
make them &quot;picnics&quot; to take outside in their tin<br/>
pails.  We emptied a wooden shed and converted it to a<br/>
playhouse for them.<br/>
<br/>
I have not been able to get them outside to play for<br/>
more than 20 minutes at a time, MAYBE twice a day, if<br/>
I&#39;m lucky, for the last two months.  They want to be<br/>
where we are all the time, every minute.  This is<br/>
nothing new, they have always wanted to be where we<br/>
are all the time.  But lately it&#39;s been worse.  The<br/>
only way to get them outside for any length of time is<br/>
if we are doing chores outdoors.  If we have things to<br/>
take care of indoors, they are there, running around,<br/>
being rowdy, making things difficult.  I can ask them<br/>
to go play in their room (they have the biggest room<br/>
in the house and we built them a loft and play space<br/>
so they have even more room in it) but that only lasts<br/>
so long, AND it prevents me from cleaning floors,<br/>
beds, etc in there, which usually needs it most.<br/>
<br/>
Asking them to help clean is like asking them to help<br/>
pull their own fingernails out by the roots, or at<br/>
least that&#39;s how they act.  Hey I had a<br/>
thought...maybe I could say only people cleaning can<br/>
be in the house until we are done.  hmmmmm.  Well they<br/>
would not darken the door long if I did, but then that<br/>
only takes care of time when we have chores and still<br/>
leaves the problem of time when THEY really need to<br/>
get out and run around outside and WE are going stir<br/>
crazy and have things to do inside and would REALLY<br/>
love for them to play outside and run off some steam<br/>
for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Any Ideas?<br/>

**I have not been able to get them outside to play for<br/>
&gt; more than 20 minutes at a time, MAYBE twice a day, if<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m lucky, for the last two months.  They want to be<br/>
&gt; where we are all the time, every minute.  This is<br/>
&gt; nothing new, they have always wanted to be where we<br/>
&gt; are all the time.  **<br/>
<br/>
My kids are the same way.  They want to be where I am.   I know this may not<br/>
be what you want to hear, but can you look at it from the point of view that<br/>
they like being with you.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve learned to see the good in the fact that they are here with me.  I see<br/>
now how lucky I am to have them here.   I didn&#39;t always feel this way,  I<br/>
had to learn it from some other wise Moms.<br/>
<br/>
 I might not be able to clean right when I want or get things done right<br/>
when I want,  but I&#39;m glad they&#39;re here.   I try and accomplish these things<br/>
around them.   A clean house isn&#39;t a big priority right now.   I know there<br/>
will be a time in my life, when they are grown,  my house will possibly be<br/>
in order and clean (maybe),,,,and very quiet, :(   and then I will miss<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
How old are your kids?   Are they quite young?  My two oldest 10 and 9, are<br/>
less inclined to wanting me with them now.  But, they also don&#39;t like to be<br/>
outside much.   I used to sit and fret about it,  thinking,  &quot;oh the weather<br/>
is so nice, they should be outside&quot;.  Well,  I wasn&#39;t out there,  I was<br/>
sitting inside.  I was doing stuff inside and they want to also.<br/>
<br/>
If I really want to enjoy the outside I go out and ask them if they want to<br/>
go out with me.  Sometimes they do, sometimes they don&#39;t.  I&#39;m OK with that.<br/>
It all depends on what they are doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
**But lately it&#39;s been worse**<br/>
<br/>
Have you been more busy with house stuff?   More busy with stuff other than<br/>
them?   I know this is what happens at our house when there is alot going<br/>
on,  if people are coming to visit and I try and clean or something like<br/>
this.   Maybe they need a little mom time?<br/>
<br/>
Breathe......<br/>
This will pass and soon they&#39;ll be grown.<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I always say, don&#39;t waste energy being jealous,<br/>
change your reality if you don&#39;t like where you are.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;It sounds like you have a lot of work to do.  Is it<br/>

&gt;short end of the stick on attention? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband has been out of work for 7 months, so right<br/>
now our schedule looks like this.  Every morning hubby<br/>
gets up with older son and plays computer games with<br/>
him for a couple of hours.  Then they cook breakfast<br/>
for everyone together.  Our younger son and I are<br/>
later night/later sleepers, he climbs in bed with me<br/>
when the other two get up and we talk and cuddle<br/>
sleepily and read or tell stories to each other till<br/>
breakfast.  Then we take care of the dishes together. <br/>
He likes to rinse.<br/>
<br/>
Usually after that the boys go off to get dressed and<br/>
play something together.  Hubby and I take care of<br/>
chores, talk, read together, or we all go to town if<br/>
we need to or there is something happening that we<br/>
want to go do/see, or we go to the beach, or take a<br/>
walk in the woods.  If we have things to do outside we<br/>
do them then.  The kids like to help stack split wood<br/>
as hubby cuts it, or help out in the garden, but<br/>
generally they run around and play together while we<br/>
are working.  Various times in the day we pause to<br/>
read stories or play games with the kids as they<br/>
request.<br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon hubby shuts himself in our room with<br/>
our computer and does internet and telephone job<br/>
searching stuff.  After dinner we might play a board<br/>
game together, watch a movie together, or hubby and I<br/>
do something while the kids play on the computer or<br/>
elsewhere.  After that, when he says he&#39;s tired and<br/>
ready for bed, I climb in bed with our older son and<br/>
read him some chapters of whatever chapter books we<br/>
are reading now for an hour or so.  Then I trade<br/>
places with his dad, whom he likes to go to sleep<br/>
with, and I go hang out with our younger son, who<br/>
stays up late.  We either do something together, or we<br/>
do our own things there with each other, keeping<br/>
company and chatting.  When he&#39;s ready to go to sleep,<br/>
I tuck him in and hit the hay myself.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t strike me as the schedule of a couple of<br/>
attention starved little boys.  My kids are 5 and 6,<br/>
for someone who asked that.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I CAN do chores around them and I often have<br/>
to.  Mainly they need to go play outside because they<br/>
NEED to go play outside.  Particularly it becomes an<br/>
issue when they are doing outdoor things in the house<br/>
and clearly need to go do them outside (making mud<br/>
pies in the bathroom sink, running, screaming, playing<br/>
ball, etc.  They are VERY active.  They also sometimes<br/>
stay in even when we are outside doing chores, and I<br/>
often find them up to something they should not be<br/>
when I come in the house to check on them (ie:<br/>
wrestling on our bed, throwing all the bedding on the<br/>
floor; OR climbing on furniture to get things of ours<br/>
that we have put up because they abuse them; OR making<br/>
a huge mess in the kitchen playing with food they do<br/>
not intend to eat; OR teasing a cat; OR etc, you get<br/>
the picture.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re great kids, just very active and need to go<br/>
out and play hard some evey day if possible.  What<br/>
about days when they want to just do quiet things, you<br/>
may ask?  When those days ever occur in my lifetime, I<br/>
will say a prayer of thanks.  Times when they are<br/>
doing something relatively quiet, briefly, I don&#39;t<br/>
care if they are painting in the middle of the kitchen<br/>
floor while I cook dinner and have to step over them<br/>
(like last night) because it&#39;s such a relief not to<br/>
have the screaming and the running in the house.<br/>
