<div id="ygrps-yiv-1038641431">Well, back on that religion topic: I got a call today from a friend who went <br/>
to an allegedly all-inclusive support group meeting with her kids.  The kids <br/>
were off playing, and several moms asked her what church they attended. She <br/>
said they were Buddhist, and there wasn&#39;t a nearby place of worship.  <br/>
Silence, then &quot;You&#39;re raising your children that way?&quot;  &quot;Yes...&quot; Silence.  <br/>
Then &quot;And it doesn&#39;t bother you that they&#39;ll go to hell?&quot;  She made her <br/>
excuses, and gathered the kids up. <br/>
<br/>
Seething, she wasn&#39;t talking to the kids much on the car ride home. Then her <br/>
older son (9) said, &quot; Mommy, do we have to go there again?&quot; She asked why and <br/>
he said, &quot;Because all the kids wanted to talk about was stuff God didn&#39;t want <br/>
them to do, and I was afraid that if I said I did some of those things, God <br/>
would be mad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As you would imagine, much processing ensued.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Are we also emotionally inferior to God?  Especially since I&#39;ve become a <br/>
&gt; parent, the entire Christian/Father/God thing bugs me. I don&#39;t understand <br/>
&gt; how <br/>
&gt; ANY parent could turn their back on their child, or punish them eternally. <br/>
&gt; Doesn&#39;t make sense, especially not a healthy sane loving parent. And as <br/>
&gt; human <br/>
&gt; and imperfect as I am, there is nothing in the world that my son could do <br/>
&gt; that would cause me to wish eternal suffering or punishment on him. And I <br/>
&gt; don&#39;t need anyone to come and take the rap for something my son did, that <br/>
&gt; would be silly. Am I a better parent than God? &lt;snicker snicker&gt; Besides, <br/>
&gt; what kind of parent would put two kids in a big garden/playground and tell <br/>
&gt; them they could have anything but the fruit from the big tree? I personally <br/>
&gt; would have planned a bit better. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As parents, we (most of us I think?) don&#39;t set up all these guidelines at <br/>
&gt; birth of how our child will act and how much love will be doled out <br/>
&gt; accordingly. It isn&#39;t, &quot;Well, if he breaks any one of these ten rules, <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; it, we&#39;re throwin him to the dogs.&quot; We parent, we guide, we love, we <br/>
&gt; nurture, <br/>
&gt; we support, we forgive. It isn&#39;t our children&#39;s job to strive to <br/>
&gt; please/worship us, it is our job to provide for them. I can&#39;t imagine a God <br/>
&gt; who is supposed to be so much larger than human to not have these basic <br/>
&gt; qualities.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, by some of these standards, God is a mean bastard. He creates people <br/>
all over the place. Say you have a baby born to Muslims, Jews, <br/>
Buddhists...whatever.  Baby grows up in her family&#39;s religion, and is not <br/>
exposed to the idea that you have to follow Jesus Christ or you&#39;re damned. <br/>
<br/>
Why would God set things up that way? <br/>
<br/>
I stopped being friends (we weren&#39;t very close anyway) with a woman who I <br/>
believe is psychologically abusing her children.  She has told her children <br/>
if they sin and do not follow God&#39;s wishes and accept him totally, that they <br/>
will never get to go to heaven, but go to hell. And because mommy is going to <br/>
Heaven, and God wouldn&#39;t want her to be sad that her children went to hell, <br/>
he would make her forget about them. They&#39;re 5 and 7. Funny...it&#39;s legal to <br/>
do that to kids.<br/>
<br/>
This seems totally inconsistent with what Jesus taught. <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>God didn&#39;t set it up that way.  Originally, everyone knew about <br/>
Jehovah God.  Following the tower of Babel , some entire <br/>
people groups deliberately rejected God and refused to pass on God&#39;s <br/>
truth to their children.  Sometimes bits and pieces of the truth got <br/>
passed through the generations, and sometimes when missionaries went <br/>
to tell them the truth, the pieces fell together and people again <br/>
turned to God.  Sometimes they still refused to follow God.  So there <br/>
is no people group who never knew of God.  Those who don&#39;t have any <br/>
Bible or knowledge of Jesus Christ are that way because at some point <br/>
in history, their ancestors rejected God.  <br/>
<br/>
The Bible says (Romans 1) that God reveals Himself to people through <br/>
nature.  So when people are convicted with the truth of a Creator and <br/>
desire to know more of Him, He finds a way to reveal Himself to them. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I disagree with your ex-friend if she tells her kids that their <br/>
citizenship in heaven is dependent on whether or not they sin because <br/>
I believe the Bible teaches that our salvation is based solely on our <br/>
acceptance of Jesus CHrist as Lord and Savior and that a desire to <br/>
live our lives for Him should come naturally after our salvation.  <br/>
However, I respect her right as a parent and, if she&#39;s in the U.S., as <br/>
a citizen of a (supposed to be) free country to raise her children as <br/>
she sees fit.  Or do you think that people shouldn&#39;t have the right to <br/>
pass on their religious beliefs to their children?  <br/>

she is going to finish wrapping up all this Christmas stuff!</div>
