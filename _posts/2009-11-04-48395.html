<div id="ygrps-yiv-695005950">Jocelyn Vilter sent a link to this.  It&#39;s an account of how Sesame  <br/>
Street changed a boy&#39;s life, from the perspective of the grown man as  <br/>
a father.  Maybe this would be good to give to relatives who complain  <br/>
about television, because it has absolutely nothing to do with  <br/>
unschooling, but all to do with learning.<br/>
<br/>
*******************<br/>
I&#39;ve posted about my love for Sesame Street previously, but I can say  <br/>
without a moment’s worth of doubt that Sesame Street was the most  <br/>
positive influence on my life of anything that I experienced as a  <br/>
child. I grew up in a small town in southwest Missouri that was pretty  <br/>
much the exact opposite of the Sesame Street world. Every family was  <br/>
white. Education was minimal. To provide perspective: This was a town  <br/>
where the KKK could march through the streets openly and be cheered;  <br/>
it was a town where everyone attended church at least twice each week,  <br/>
yet somehow it had the highest teen pregnancy rate in the state and  <br/>
later became a huge center for meth production. I know there are tons  <br/>
of places just like this place and even much worse, but for me  <br/>
personally it’s still the most depressing place I can imagine.<br/>
<br/>
Most people don’t escape this place. My brother got hooked on meth and  <br/>
has never been the same since. My guess is that my sister was his  <br/>
dealer. This is a normal story from that town. Even most of those kids  <br/>
there who didn’t have their lives ruined by drugs and alcohol grew up  <br/>
in an environment where they were taught that different was bad,  <br/>
intolerance was just fine, and racism was a given. Even now, with the  <br/>
advent of the Internet and satellite television, the outside world has  <br/>
made little dent in changing these attitudes.<br/>
<br/>
But I got lucky. I had Sesame Street. PBS only came in with a lot of  <br/>
fuzz on our TV, but I don’t remember a single day before I started  <br/>
school that I didn’t watch Sesame Street at least twice a day. And  <br/>
even after I started school, I watched it regularly until junior high  <br/>
and often enough even later. Yes, it was a kid’s show, but to me it  <br/>
was a lifeline. Sesame Street (and other shows such as The Electric  <br/>
Company) was the only time I saw kids who weren’t all white. The  <br/>
messages that it included of cultural curiosity and tolerance toward  <br/>
others’ views were messages I didn’t get from anywhere else. And so I  <br/>
grew up questioning the racism I saw around me. I don’t know if it was  <br/>
a gradual realization or not. But I do know it was different from what  <br/>
most of my peers saw for themselves. I know that my grandmother didn’t  <br/>
speak to me for two years after I (as a 7-year-old) got mad at her for  <br/>
saying something racist. I know that I had my car tires slashed more  <br/>
times than I can count while I was in high school and that my senior  <br/>
yearbook contains anonymous “signatures” consisting of death threats  <br/>
because of my non-racist attitudes.<br/>
<br/>
And later I escaped. Unlike most of my classmates, I was able to get  <br/>
into college. I took off and have only been back to the town a handful  <br/>
of times even though most of my family still lives there. A few of  <br/>
those times have been with my wife, whom I met several years later.  <br/>
After our first visit, she was amazed at what she saw, but her first  <br/>
question after we hopped in the car was, “How did you turn out so  <br/>
different?” I hadn’t really thought about my situation in that way  <br/>
before, but my answer was simple: “Sesame Street.” I have no doubt  <br/>
that, without that one outside presence in my pre-school life, I would  <br/>
never have thought to question anything going on in my town until it  <br/>
would have been much too late to pull myself away. I don’t think I’m  <br/>
overstating things when I say that Sesame Street saved my life.<br/>
<br/>
Years later, I had a son of my own and of course he was going to watch  <br/>
Sesame Street as often as I could get him in front of the TV. And,  <br/>
yes, he liked it, even if it was now a different show with Elmo and  <br/>
the like. But unlike me, he didn’t love Sesame Street. He enjoyed it  <br/>
and he watched it, but by the time he was five he lost interest in the  <br/>
show. It made me sad at first, but then I realized that he was now in  <br/>
a place where he didn’t “need” Sesame Street. His classroom has  <br/>
children of several different races and backgrounds. He hears about  <br/>
the outside world every day. And that makes me happy. But there are  <br/>
other kids out there who still need this show in the same way that I  <br/>
did, and I hope that Sesame Street is always there to help them as it  <br/>
did me.<br/>

And if you look at  google (at least in the U.S.) today there&#39;s a 40th  <br/>
anniversary bit, in the title.<br/>

When Kirby was little we had the Sesame Street 20th anniversary poster  <br/>
