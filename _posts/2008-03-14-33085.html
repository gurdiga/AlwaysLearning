<div id="ygrps-yiv-1565031270">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have not posted here for over a year when I first began what I thought<br/>
was unschooling.  Of course I had no idea what I was talking about.  I<br/>
have 2 kids, dd 10 and ds 16.  They both attended ps until about a year<br/>
and a half ago when I took them both out at their request.  At the time,<br/>
we lived in CA in an area where there were no other homeschool (let<br/>
alone unschooling) kids.  We have since moved to Portland, OR and things<br/>
are very different here.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here are the things I am struggling with now:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, my dd insisted on going back to ps when we moved here. She says<br/>
she loves school.  Sometimes she says she doesn&#39;t want to go, and I<br/>
always encourage her to stay home (even though the school has &#39;talked&#39;<br/>
to us about too many missed days).  Next year is Jr. High for her and I<br/>
REALLY want her to give it a miss.  She really wants to go to school. <br/>
Am I being selfish in wanting her home?  She is very bright and as a<br/>
home learner last year, she found some amazing things to do.  She loves<br/>
to be busy and she is very social.  Are some kids really better off in<br/>
school?  I want to insist she try unschooling again but that seems so<br/>
un-unschooling-ish.  Is it?<br/>
<br/>
I have watched her change as she tries to fit in with all the various<br/>
social groups in school and it makes me feel sad that she feels<br/>
compelled to do that.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My ds has taken to being free very well.  He would never go back.  He<br/>
always enjoyed the learning part of school but not the social scene and<br/>
the peer pressure.  He has gone through lots of changes in the past<br/>
year.  I am sure he would not have had the opportunity to explore his<br/>
own mind in so much depth if he hadn&#39;t been unschooling. He is a very<br/>
deep thinker and he spends hours and hours talking to people from all<br/>
over the world on line.  He is also fascinated with metaphysics.  He has<br/>
his own radio show where he interviews leaders of strange religions and<br/>
cults. He takes acting classes and is in 2 plays at the moment.  He is<br/>
doing a wonderful job of teaching me how to be more tolerant and<br/>
accepting (through his work and through his personal choices).  I have a<br/>
hard time not getting crazy when he stays up all night talking to people<br/>
on the other side of the world and then sleeps half the day.  Then I<br/>
have to ask myself why it matters when he sleeps and when he is awake? <br/>
Then I think, how will he ever learn responsibility and be able to work<br/>
or go to college?   Do other parents of teens go through this?  What do<br/>
you do?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have also gone through lots of changes.  I thought I knew what<br/>
unschooling was when I started.  Now I think it&#39;s more a way of life<br/>
than a thing.  I have loved it and hated it.  For me, dealing with my<br/>
own feelings about things has been the hardest and most rewarding part. <br/>
The clearer I get, the more peace I have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As a single mother, with no father in the picture, I think about how my<br/>
son will become a man.  I think about how his having complete freedom<br/>
now will impact his future.  I wonder if this path is really better in<br/>
the long run.  Then things happen to bring me back to feeling absolutely<br/>
right about where we are.  The other day, an old friend called to tell<br/>
me that his ds age 17 was diagnosed with terminal cancer.  Talk about<br/>
perspective.  That very day, my ds asked me if I had time to help him<br/>
make chocolate dipped strawberries and pretzels.  Of course there was<br/>
time.  Later he told me how much fun it had been for him.  He told me<br/>
how much he loved his life now.<br/>
<br/>
I have lots of family members and friends that tell me constantly how<br/>
his happiness now is not enough to justify the damage that his lifestyle<br/>
will do to his future life.  Could that be true?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening.<br/>
<br/>

This could be a serious problem.  If she&#39;s enrolled, she&#39;s subject to  <br/>
the laws pertaining to school kids.  YOU are subject to the laws.   <br/>
And truancy is a crime.  You don&#39;t want to have to get a lawyer and  <br/>
pay a fine.<br/>

<br/>
If school is more fun for her than home was, then it would be worse  <br/>
than selfish to want her home.   If home  had been more exciting  <br/>
(stimulating, comfortable) than school, she&#39;d be home.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She is very bright and as a home learner last year, she found some  <br/>
amazing things to do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you find her some amazing things to do too?  If she was having to  <br/>
do all the finding and doing, maybe that&#39;s why school is preferable.   <br/>
Or maybe she just liked being with the kids better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Are some kids really better off in school? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think so.  Some people take a political or paranoid stance and say  <br/>
school is evil, but I take the stance that learning can be fun (and  <br/>
that without any fun, there&#39;ll be little to no real learning).  If  <br/>
school is more fun, she&#39;ll be learning better there.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I want to insist she try unschooling again but that seems so<br/>
un-unschooling-ish. Is it?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about unschooling one way or the other.  One of the worst  <br/>
things about school is a child being there against his will.  Your  <br/>
daughter isn&#39;t having that problem.  School is her option and her  <br/>
choice, so it&#39;s probably better for her than for the other kids there.<br/>
<br/>
If you force her home, you&#39;ll be re-creating one of the worst things  <br/>
about school.  She won&#39;t be happy and you won&#39;t be happy.<br/>

Maybe they&#39;ll want to read some of the links you find when you&#39;re in  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could invite them to detail their concerns in writing.   <br/>
Then put them in a sealed envelope, open it in two years or so and  <br/>
write them a report.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; pay a fine.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Every time she has stayed home, it&#39;s been because she told me she <br/>
didn&#39;t feel well.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s been excessive but her teacher <br/>
asked me once why she was out.  I told her she wasn&#39;t feeling well.  <br/>
She is the kind of kid who needs to get all A&#39;s or she can&#39;t cope.  <br/>
Sometimes the stress get&#39;s too much for her and she gets sick.  This <br/>
is not the way of our house.  I put no pressure on her but she hears <br/>
what &#39;the family&#39; says about her brother and she doesn&#39;t want to end <br/>
up like him.  I always tell her the main goal is to enjoy her time <br/>
there but she says she has to go to a good college.  And yes, I told <br/>
her that college&#39;s don&#39;t look at your 5th grade report card and <br/>
reject you if you get a B+ on Math instead of an A.<br/>

She loves to be around other kids and that is the main difference.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Or maybe she just liked being with the kids better.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think I am a pretty creative mom and I did bring a lot of cool <br/>
stuff to her home education experience.  When we moved to a new <br/>
state, she just wanted to meet friends.  Now that she has them, she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to loose them.  <br/>

conference in Vancouver, WA in May?  I thought maybe if she met other <br/>
kids that were self learners that she liked and could be friends <br/>
with, she may feel more at ease to consider an option to school.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your reply.  I appreciate your honesty.</div>

them have anything like any of those things.  He just told me he wants <br/>
to teach a class on the history of the occult and he wants to look for <br/>
a venue to do such a thing.  So, not your run of the mill goal but <br/>
still pretty cool.  Oh and he is teaching himself how to play Sympathy <br/>

being, just being right.  Thank you for the links, they helped.<br/>

One of the things I think is ture for me is that when I judge him and <br/>
his choices, it&#39;s almost always really about me and my unresolved <br/>
fears.  Perhaps that is true for others too.  I am kind of a mama bear <br/>
and I won&#39;t stand for anyone saying anything negative about my kids <br/>
(either to me or to their face).  Not that they are perfect, but if I <br/>
don&#39;t think so...who will?</div>

Portland, where you dd could feel like she&#39;s &quot;part of a school&quot; AND have the<br/>
freedom to follow her own path. I only know this school exists because<br/>
they&#39;re coming to the Life is Good<br/>
Conference&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifeisgoodconference.com">http://lifeisgoodconference.com</a>&gt;in May... It&#39;s an option<br/>
and it&#39;s an option between unschooling and<br/>
traditional school -- a compromise of sorts :)<br/>
<br/>
As a single mother, with no father in the picture, I think about how my<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; son will become a man. I think about how his having complete freedom<br/>
&gt; now will impact his future. I wonder if this path is really better in<br/>

&gt; me that his ds age 17 was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Talk about<br/>
&gt; perspective. That very day, my ds asked me if I had time to help him<br/>
&gt; make chocolate dipped strawberries and pretzels. Of course there was<br/>
&gt; time. Later he told me how much fun it had been for him. He told me<br/>
&gt; how much he loved his life now.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My dh died when my son was 2, he has no actual memories of his dad... I used<br/>
to have big Fear about the &quot;lack of daddy&quot; in his life and I realized Life<br/>
without Dad and with a Fearful Mama was probably worse than Life with out<br/>
Dad and a Self-Assured Mama, so I kicked the fear!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m also a mama who got to spend the most of her daughter&#39;s short 9.5 years<br/>
of life in Joyful Freedom! I have no regrets that I gave my child the gift<br/>
of freedom before it was too late...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I have lots of family members and friends that tell me constantly how<br/>
&gt; his happiness now is not enough to justify the damage that his lifestyle<br/>
&gt; will do to his future life. Could that be true?<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sure, it *could* be. We *could be* all sucked up by a tornado, too. Life is<br/>
full of amazing possibilities, not all of them sunny and bright... My goal<br/>
is to make a whole string of Nows that are joyful and free, which<br/>
(especially for Hannah) becomes a whole life of joy and freedom.<br/>
<br/>
Of the *damaged* adults I know, all of them have been through the public<br/>
school system. I&#39;ve yet to meet *anyone* damaged by joy and freedom. Send<br/>
your family members to do their own homework (hee hee), let them research<br/>
unschooling and find out for themselves (sandradodd.com/unschooling or<br/>
joyfullyrejoycing.com to begin) if their Truths are really True (chances are<br/>
they&#39;ll either read and figure out they&#39;ve been deluded or they won&#39;t read<br/>
and stand firm in their own experiences & the &quot;if it was good enough for<br/>
me...&quot; mentality). School tends to make people really really afraid of life<br/>
outside of the box. We&#39;re here to tell ya Life Out Here is waaaaay cool :D<br/>

conference&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://lifeisgoodconference.com">http://lifeisgoodconference.com</a>&gt;?<br/>
(it&#39;s right there in your backyard!) He would meet a whole new group of<br/>
unschoolers to connect with.<br/>
Hayden, 9.5, also has a natural rhythm that is very different than mine (or<br/>
anyone else I know who is a product of &quot;you sleep now, you wake now&quot;<br/>
upbringing). Sometimes it&#39;s staying up all night, talking to people from all<br/>
over the world, sometimes (like this week) it&#39;s asleep by 7pm and awake at 6<br/>
am, spending all *day* talking to people from all over the place :D<br/>
<br/>
One thing that really soothed me when Hayden was 4 and firmly on a night<br/>
shift, was meeting a lawyer in Rapid City who never, ever opens his office<br/>
before noon. He went to college and law school at night and runs his (very<br/>
successful) business on his own terms, on his own schedule. So it&#39;s not just<br/>
overnight warehouse jobs available to our *night owls* (though DH would say<br/>
his overnight warehouse job was the Best Job he ever had!) -- there&#39;s a<br/>
whole different way of looking at the world, if we&#39;re willing to move from<br/>
our current perspective.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1665863776">~~<br/>
-=-I have lots of family members and friends that tell me constantly<br/>
how his happiness now is not enough to justify the damage that his<br/>
lifestyle will do to his future life. Could that be true?-=-~~<br/>
<br/>
I just talked about this last week in the Mythbusters talk!:) I<br/>
haven&#39;t found it to be true at ALL.<br/>
My oldest boys (18 and 14 currently) have had some really strange<br/>
sleep patterns over the years. Jared (14) is currently up all night on<br/>
WoW, partially because his best friend (aka; older brother) is gone a<br/>
lot and he&#39;s lonely at night without anyone awake in the house. Poor guy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo, neither of them seem to have suffered any damage whatsoever<br/>
from their bizarre sleep patterns. Up all night can translate back to<br/>
a &quot;normal&quot; schedule in one day if needed. I&#39;ve watched them on more<br/>
than one occasion, stay up all night and then all the next day in<br/>
order to be tired so they can be up for some event or travel or job or<br/>
something important to them.<br/>
<br/>
Why would sleeping when you like affect the rest of your life? Other<br/>
than knowing how to be balanced and listening to your body! People can<br/>
adapt to situations when they need to and believe me, these kids adapt<br/>
beautifully.<br/>
<br/>
Trevor (18) is off at college with his girlfriend right now (she&#39;s<br/>
going, he&#39;s visiting) and I bet his sleep patterns have changed yet<br/>
again. The ability to stay up all night comes in handy at the<br/>
conferences too....:)<br/>

It was kinda bittersweet looking at the pics and seeing all the happy<br/>
faces. Awesome kids.:)<br/>
If you look really close at the pic of the Albuquerque dance, with<br/>
Marty&#39;s big sombrero, Trevor is directly behind the sombrero with his<br/>
foot tall mohawk. <br/>
<br/>
Anyone who has doubts about unschooling needs to come meet some of<br/>
these teens and hang out for a while. It will dispel all doubt (or<br/>
send you running for the hills if you have issues with colorful hair<br/>
or strong opinions).<br/>

so this is truly a new (very brave) venture for me. My talk is entitled<br/>
&quot;Life Uncommon, Love Uncommon&quot; and will focus on the relationship potential<br/>
we have as homeschooling parents (and a healthy dose of Urgency to make<br/>
those relationships happen right-the-you-know-what NOW!)<br/>
Be sure to c&#39;mon over and say hello, if you&#39;ll be there :D<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-73937956">-=-I am kind of a mama bear<br/>
and I won&#39;t stand for anyone saying anything negative about my kids<br/>
(either to me or to their face). Not that they are perfect, but if I<br/>
don&#39;t think so...who will?-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is over a week old; I&#39;m sorry.  I had reason to go through old  <br/>
mail and remembered I had meant to respond to this.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter anymore who wrote it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you know a child isn&#39;t perfect, but you try to make others treat  <br/>
them as though they are, that&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
If you claim to think a child is perfect and you say he&#39;s not (in  <br/>
public) isn&#39;t there cognitive dissonance?<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;I won&#39;t stand for anyone saying anything negative about my kids&quot;  <br/>
would that mean hitting the speaker or leaving the room or arguing  <br/>
with them or insulting them?     If my husband said &quot;I won&#39;t stand  <br/>
for anyone saying anything negative about my wife,&quot; what should I  <br/>
think he means!?  I can&#39;t imagine  him saying that.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody needs to answer these questions here, at all.  I&#39;m not asking  <br/>
for answers.  I&#39;m asking for considerations of these things in a  <br/>
dozen or a hundred people who might come by this and have those kind  <br/>
of thoughts unexamined in them.<br/>
<br/>
When someone says something about one of my kids and its true, it&#39;s  <br/>
good for me to know.  If they express it nicely or snarkily or with  <br/>
some clear jealousy or fear of my kids&#39; privileges or if they&#39;re  <br/>
trying to insult me, that&#39;s a whole different level of the  <br/>
conversation.  That&#39;s not about my kids.  That&#39;s about what the  <br/>
communicator thinks of me.  But the infomation about my children  <br/>
might be true, and it&#39;s always worth considering such things.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t have to repeat it to my child, but I can consider looking at  <br/>
such aspects and seeing whether a word or gesture  might help the  <br/>
next time.<br/>
<br/>
