<div id="ygrps-yiv-1830284394">My daughter is two now. She refuses to sit in the car seat. On numerous occasions, I either hold her on my lap or put her in a car seat and give her my breasts.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have to drive and she would kick, scream and fight so hard to get out of her car seat. I end up not driving out that much.<br/>
<br/>
My questions:<br/>
<br/>
1. Any gentle way than using force to get her sit in her seat?<br/>
<br/>
2. Is there &quot;carseat-phobic&quot; that causes her so upset? The reason I ask is that I feel a little bit claustrophobic sitting in the back seat.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271418108">I have twin almost 1 year olds and a 4.5yo, so getting everyone in their seats <br/>
can be a challenge and a safety issue if we are in a busy parking lot, etc. So, <br/>
I have begun offering everyone, especially my twin boys, a snack in little cups <br/>
the moment that they get into the car seats.  This has mostly alleviated the <br/>
struggles because they have something in their hands (shifting their focus from <br/>
*not* wanting to be in the car seat to the item in their hands) and they are <br/>
genuinely interested in having the snack.  I attempted this with toys, but it <br/>
wasn&#39;t as successful; snacks are definitely the more exciting offering.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869341153">Not much in the way of ideas--my daughter was the same way.  As long as I could sit in the backseat and let her nurse, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. If I was the one driving, though, it was torture for her, so I only took her out alone when it was absolutely necessary.  It gets better, if that helps.<br/>
<br/>
Oh...we brought the carseat into the house for a few weeks and left it on the floor in the living room.  Being able to play all over it and integrate it into her play may have helped somewhat.  Make sure the back of the seat is against something solid, though, as they tip rather easily.<br/>
<br/>
If finances allow, maybe take her to a store and let her try out all the different seats.  Some have really high wings around the head, which may add to her discomfort or a feeling of claustrophobia.... and maybe being a part of choosing her torture device would help with her willingness.<br/>
<br/>
Dd (7 yrs) has an iPod now and she loves riding in the car.  Not sure, but maybe a 2 yr.old would be swayed by being able to watch something fun?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766979804">My daughter is now almost 3 and she  always hated to be in her car seat. We realized that motion sickness could be an issue to her. We moved her car seat behind the front passenger seat and took off the head rest. (if I am not driving I sit in the back with the kids so that seat is generally not occupied. If it is occupied, it&#39;s best to keep the headrest in place.) In this position with the head rest off, she has a clear view out the front window.  <br/>
<br/>
Ever since we made this switch she is perfectly happy in the car. I don&#39;t know if looking out the front alleviates motion sickness for her, as it does for me, or if this has just given her more visual interest and, therefore, a better ride. In any case, she is now comfortable in the car.<br/>
