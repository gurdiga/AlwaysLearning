Half the kids at school don&#39;t &quot;know as much as they do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Talk about thing he does know, about things school kids famously  <br/>
don&#39;t (recent studies about the embarrassing ignorances in geography,  <br/>
maybe, for example).   Find more unschoolers or homeschoolers so he&#39;s  <br/>
not just dependent on schooled kids for examples.<br/>

Why did you say no?<br/>
<br/>
What are your reasons? Are you OK with them? Or are you questioning <br/>
your own reaction?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the worst that could happen? What&#39;s the best?<br/>
<br/>
What could make you say yes? Do you even want to say yes? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why does she want to stay there? Really?<br/>
<br/>
How old is the boyfriend?<br/>
<br/>
More background, please.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480675511">Okay more information. Megan has been unschooling since December of <br/>
this past year. She is my third child, oldest at home and has six <br/>
younger siblings. The other kids have been unschooling longer. <br/>
<br/>
Once she left school she got her nurses aid certificate and a job. <br/>
It was her choice.  She recently got her drivers license. Our <br/>
relationship has improved on a daily basis. I am still learning and <br/>
saying yes more has felt great.<br/>
<br/>
Her boyfriend is a nice enough boy. He is well spoken and gets along <br/>
with Megan well. They have been dating for four month. I am certain <br/>
they are sexually active and she is on birth control. He is <br/>
seventeen.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I am questioning my immediate no. I am questioning why my <br/>
reaction was no. She asked. I said because sixteen year old girls do <br/>
not have their boyfriends spend the night. How lame is that. I know <br/>
my own issues are mixed up in my reaction. I left home with the <br/>
wrong boy at 15. I do not think she is leaving home, but would I be <br/>
comfortable if he was in her room? If he spends the night will I <br/>
feel like I want to police the situation. I hate being a cop. <br/>
<br/>
Her and I have struggled a lot. When I said no today she was really <br/>
angry and yelled at me. Of course I was questioning my reaction, but <br/>
needed to consider it. She is at work now and my no is still what is <br/>
on the table. I needed to think more, but her and I did not address <br/>
it further. <br/>
<br/>
I really need an unschooling perspective on this. I do not want to <br/>
struggle with this girl whom I love so much, but also do not want to <br/>
feel like my personal boundaries are crossed. <br/>
<br/>
Looking for input<br/>

<br/>
So let&#39;s talk about your personal boundaries.....<br/>
<br/>
You are pretty sure they are already sexually active so that isn&#39;t an <br/>
issue....<br/>
<br/>
She is wanting to be honest and open with you so sneaking around and <br/>
running off isn&#39;t the issue.....<br/>

<br/>
Some do.<br/>
<br/>
But your question wasn&#39;t about him spending the night at your  <br/>
house.   You wrote this:<br/>
-=-My sixteen year old daughter wants to stay overnight at her<br/>
boyfriends.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-Her and I have struggled a lot.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s only been unschooled for a very short while—not even a  year.   <br/>
So I don&#39;t expect her relationship with you to be as relaxed and open  <br/>
as it might be if she had unschooled for a long time. And you have  <br/>
seven kids.  She might have been feeling unattended to for a long,  <br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>
There are kids her age living with a boyfriend&#39;s family, or the other  <br/>
way around—a boyfriend who has come to live with the girlfriend&#39;s  <br/>
family.  Spending one night isn&#39;t the same as that.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s sexually active and you know that, why make her be secretive  <br/>
and strained?<br/>
<br/>
When I was 30 years old and Keith was 27, his mom wouldn&#39;t let us  <br/>
share a bed at her house because we weren&#39;t married.  We had been  <br/>
living together for years.  We&#39;re still together.   But those were  <br/>
&quot;her boundaries.&quot;  It was her house.  So it goes.  We wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>
had sex in her house anyway.  Maybe your daughter wouldn&#39;t want to  <br/>
either, with you and six siblings there.<br/>
<br/>
But again, you said at the boyfriend&#39;s house.<br/>
<br/>
Past all that, there are lots of 16 year olds who go to camp, or week- <br/>
long workshops or seminars or bootcamp or college.<br/>
<br/>
My dad sent my college boyfriend out in the snow to hitch-hike 25  <br/>
miles to my MOM&#39;s house because he wouldn&#39;t let him stay in the same  <br/>
house where I was overnight . That was massively stupid.  I was  <br/>
furious, but couldn&#39;t do much about it.  We had hitch-hiked to their  <br/>
house to visit.  It was just awful.  We could&#39;ve stayed in different  <br/>
rooms.  He could&#39;ve loaned him a car.  That&#39;s the worst thing I can  <br/>
think of with my dad, and within about three years, my dad was  <br/>
&quot;living in sin&quot; with someone, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Okay, this is not an &quot;unschooling&quot; perspective necessarily because my <br/>
kids are really young still, but I can tell what I did and how I felt.<br/>
<br/>
By the age of sixteen, I&#39;d had several years of caring for myself, being <br/>
the adult in the house. I&#39;d been caring for myself, doing my own <br/>
laundry, staying home alone, etc. for several years. I&#39;d lost my father, <br/>
watched him die a long death. I&#39;d put my mother, passed out on the <br/>
kitchen table, to bed. I resented every moment someone treated me as a <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
By the age of sixteen I was not only sexually active, I was sneaking out <br/>
of my house, climbing out my bedroom window, jumping off the roof, <br/>
rolling the car down the driveway in neutral and going to my boyfriend&#39;s <br/>
house in the middle of the night. I did this because I was in love, <br/>
because I wanted to, because there wasn&#39;t much other choice, because no <br/>
one was taking me seriously.<br/>
<br/>
If you and your daughter are already struggling, is this likely to help? <br/>
Is your &quot;no&quot; likely to stop anything? Is your &quot;no&quot; likely to alienate <br/>
her, make her feel resentful, make her sneak around, make her feel like <br/>
you don&#39;t trust her or take her seriously as a person?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s a yes likely to do?<br/>

keep reflecting what my issue is. It is my fear for her growing up <br/>
too fast? Is it what people will say? I do not really think so. <br/>
Since she is out of school dating one of the three african american <br/>
guys in our entire small town. &lt;G&gt; I think it is about her being an <br/>
adult. She did not however say can I live at Mikes. She said can I <br/>
stay the night. She also asked if he could stay at our house one <br/>
night. Her little brothers think he is awesome and would love for <br/>
Mike to stay. <br/>
<br/>
If it is a sleep over it is not about sex. She has not even said <br/>
where anyone would sleep. <br/>
<br/>

has been slow. She hung onto lots of schoolish things long after the <br/>
rest of us had let go, including her needing to be more <br/>
secretive.And here she is openning up and I am freaking out. Not <br/>
exactly freaking, but definately being authoritarian. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want her to sneak around with her life. I appreciate her <br/>
asking frankly. There was something in the whole exchange that made <br/>
me feel as if she was trying to take advantage. It is somehow my <br/>
issue. It is me being small minded. Like look I have given her all <br/>
this freedom and she wants more... What the heck. Maybe I have not <br/>
come as far as I thought. <br/>

Are you in a scary racist little town?<br/>

<br/>
My kids have been at lots of mixed-gender sleepovers, all through the  <br/>
years.  Once when Holly was disinvited (required to go home at 10:00  <br/>
for being the only girl) we were all kinda traumatized.<br/>
<br/>
That was just a year ago.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If Mike lived in another town and came a long distance for the  <br/>
weekend, wouldn&#39;t you let him stay over?  Kids shouldn&#39;t be penalized  <br/>
for living near.  If he lived far away she might go visit him and  <br/>
you&#39;d have no oversight or involvement at all (as with LOTS of teens&#39;  <br/>
parents).<br/>

There is one family that doesn&#39;t let the girls stay when all the boys  <br/>
do - for all-night LAN parties. And they make the girls go in the  <br/>
front room when the mother is not home EVEN when the dad is there.  <br/>
Weird.<br/>
<br/>
Mixed gender all-nighters are pretty common among my kids&#39; friends.  <br/>
That&#39;s different than a boyfriend/girlfriend sleep-over, though. My  <br/>
husband doesn&#39;t like the boyfriend/girlfriend sleepovers - can&#39;t  <br/>
really say why except it feels wrong to him (poor guy - he&#39;s from  <br/>
Iran and when he was growing up there was so much repression that  <br/>
even making eye-contact with a girl was scandalous). But my oldest  <br/>
daughter&#39;s boyfriend has stayed here for weekends MANY times and she  <br/>
stays at his family&#39;s house a lot, too. My husband just tries to be  <br/>
nice as he can about it, even though it really does bother him.<br/>

How about discussing it with your daughter. Coming at life with black and white nos  doesn&#39;t seem to work out well for everyone involved - especially for the younger person. Discussing with your daughter how you really feel about the whole thing, your experiences when you were young, your regrets, how your parents handled things, what you learnt from that. Ask her how she feels, go on and on and just talk. Problem solving and lots of negotiating are more reasonable ways of working through issues rather than being in the mind of controller. Saying no isn&#39;t going to stop your daughter sleeping with her boyfriend and it will probably make her more likely to want to do it. Be an open book and connection will grow.<br/>

<br/>
  Okay more information. Megan has been unschooling since December of <br/>
  this past year. She is my third child, oldest at home and has six <br/>
  younger siblings. The other kids have been unschooling longer. <br/>
<br/>
  Once she left school she got her nurses aid certificate and a job. <br/>
  It was her choice.  She recently got her drivers license. Our <br/>
  relationship has improved on a daily basis. I am still learning and <br/>
  saying yes more has felt great.<br/>
<br/>
  Her boyfriend is a nice enough boy. He is well spoken and gets along <br/>
  with Megan well. They have been dating for four month. I am certain <br/>
  they are sexually active and she is on birth control. He is <br/>
  seventeen.<br/>
<br/>
  I guess I am questioning my immediate no. I am questioning why my <br/>
  reaction was no. She asked. I said because sixteen year old girls do <br/>
  not have their boyfriends spend the night. How lame is that. I know <br/>
  my own issues are mixed up in my reaction. I left home with the <br/>
  wrong boy at 15. I do not think she is leaving home, but would I be <br/>
  comfortable if he was in her room? If he spends the night will I <br/>
  feel like I want to police the situation. I hate being a cop. <br/>
<br/>
  Her and I have struggled a lot. When I said no today she was really <br/>
  angry and yelled at me. Of course I was questioning my reaction, but <br/>
  needed to consider it. She is at work now and my no is still what is <br/>
  on the table. I needed to think more, but her and I did not address <br/>
  it further. <br/>
<br/>
  I really need an unschooling perspective on this. I do not want to <br/>
  struggle with this girl whom I love so much, but also do not want to <br/>
  feel like my personal boundaries are crossed. <br/>
<br/>
  Looking for input<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1851654541">&lt;&lt;&lt;What would and do each of you say when the question comes to you?&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have had many variations of this. We often have overnight guests and it<br/>
matters little to me if they are boys or girls. Often they are all camped<br/>
together in the livingroom when I get up in the morning. Most of these are<br/>
just friends who stayed too late and didn&#39;t want to drive home.<br/>
<br/>
But the girls are dating and have been or are in longer-term relationships.<br/>
Their values in regard to sex are different than mine. I do ask that they<br/>
respect my values in our home though. I have younger kids and it matters to<br/>
me. We are very open about all of this and though I don&#39;t agree with their<br/>
choices, I certainly respect their choices and they in turn respect where<br/>
I&#39;m coming from. If a boyfriend is staying over I ask that they not sleep<br/>
together alone in their room. (if they&#39;re part of the group staying over,<br/>
then I certainly don&#39;t separate them). And it&#39;s not so much that this is a<br/>
&#39;rule&#39;, but that we&#39;ve talked about that I am uncomfortable with that<br/>
scenario and this is what we&#39;ve come up with as a family. It&#39;s not discussed<br/>
in right vs wrong way, but as a difference in values. They have been happy<br/>
to accommodate me in this area. When the boyfriend&#39;s sleep over, it&#39;s<br/>
usually not about sex anyway, it&#39;s about hanging out or not driving home<br/>
late or an early morning event (and in the case of Lisa, a boyfriend that<br/>
lives in Florida). Lisa goes to Florida to visit him as well and I know the<br/>
rules are different in their house. I wouldn&#39;t dream of imposing my values<br/>
on their home.  I think it all comes down to lots of talking and sharing of<br/>
perspectives. I think it also has a lot to do with respecting one another&#39;s<br/>
values.<br/>

<br/>
 And what do you do when your kids want to have someone they are<br/>
 involved with sleep over , or sleep over there?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I asked my myself this question before I even had kids. Or maybe it was <br/>
when I was pregnant with Cameron, and they said he was a girl?<br/>
<br/>
My feeling was that I didn&#39;t want my little girl to be having her first <br/>
sexual experience in the back of a toyota (not hat I did---I was in a <br/>
college dorm twin bed! &lt;g&gt;). I wanted her first experience to be <br/>
pleasant and beautiful and memorable and all that. In my pre-kid <br/>
day-dreamings, I would set the house up just so.... and leave her and <br/>
her boyfriend alone in the house.<br/>
<br/>
Seemed cooler when it was *my* daughter. But I have two sons! &lt;G&gt; What <br/>
mother would want *me* to be the mother of her daughter&#39;s boyfriend??? <br/>
&lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So, in reality: I know from experience that they can have sex almost <br/>
anywhere and almost at any time. They *could* sneak off and lie and <br/>
find dangerous places and forget condoms and all sorts of mean, nasty, <br/>
ugly stuff...<br/>
<br/>
Or I could be smarter than that:<br/>
<br/>
I make sure there are new condoms always available. I&#39;ve talked with <br/>
Carly about birth control (that *totally* freaked her out the first <br/>
time!) and offered to take her to my OBGyn (her own mom finally did).<br/>
<br/>
They can ask for &quot;alone time&quot;---and no one will disturb them. They&#39;re <br/>
actually very discreet.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron and I talk openly and frankly about sex. It&#39;s not always the <br/>
*most* comfortable conversation! &lt;G&gt; But we both do our best! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think it all boils down to how would *you* have liked to have been <br/>
treated?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1134318353">-= &gt; My kids have been at lots of mixed-gender sleepovers, all  <br/>
through the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; years. Once when Holly was disinvited (required to go home at 10:00<br/>
 &gt; for being the only girl) we were all kinda traumatized.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids too. In fact, a couple of those have been WITH Sandra&#39;s kids!<br/>
&lt;G&gt;-=-<br/>
<br/>
The first time my boys were up late with Pam&#39;s girls was a few years  <br/>
back.  They were still up and talking in the living room after all  <br/>
parents were asleep elsewhere and I was worried about what Pam&#39;s  <br/>
husband would think, and had the fleeting thought that if one of my  <br/>
boys were to go crazy and even kiss one of those girls, we were a  <br/>
long long way from home to be thrown out at 3:00 a.m. by someone I  <br/>
really liked.  Then I thought &quot;Hey�this is Kirby and Marty I&#39;m  <br/>
thinking about!&quot;  Safe guys, and Pam&#39;s girls could defend themselves  <br/>
from hypothetical momentary young-teen-Dodd insanity, no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
Years back this kind of discussion came up, about whether anyone  <br/>
would allow mixed slumber parties, and that was even a question about  <br/>
young kids, 12ish, I think.  And one of the moms said if we thought  <br/>
kids could sleep in the same room without having sex, we were  <br/>
deluding ourselves.  Maybe I can find the exact quote.  I thought it  <br/>
was really funny.  Kinda sad and stunning, but also, in context of  <br/>
people&#39;s real experiences (personal and with kids) it said much more  <br/>
about that writer than about humans in general or about unschooled kids.<br/>

has shared and will talk to Megan and let her know that sleep overs <br/>
are okay with me. And talk to her about my reaction and fears. We have <br/>
always talked openly about sexual things. The sleepover I am sure is <br/>
not particularly a sexual thing just a thing.<br/>

It is amazing to me how strong my reaction was. Fear and conditioning <br/>
is a powerful force in our actions. After the interaction with her <br/>

boyfriends. I immediately said no.***<br/>
<br/>
Hi Kathleen! : )<br/>
<br/>
If you know she&#39;s having sex then the &quot;danger&quot; she might have sex at an<br/>
overnight at his house is not the issue.<br/>
If you find him a nice enough guy then her safety isn&#39;t the issue.<br/>
If you&#39;re not afraid of what other people will say about you allowing her<br/>
to stay then embarrassment isn&#39;t the issue.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it makes you a little sad that she&#39;s growing up and feeling<br/>
independent?   Maybe you&#39;d like her to want to stay with you more than<br/>
she wants to be with him?   If you&#39;re sort of just starting to feel a<br/>
closer, unschooly relationship maybe it feels like she&#39;s trying to move<br/>
away from you? <br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t stop her from staying with him.  Well, I guess you could call<br/>
the cops.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She can drive herself to his house and go right in and stay there and not<br/>
return your calls if she chooses.  So you must know she *can* do it.  <br/>
<br/>
She asked you because she wants your support as she ventures further into<br/>
the world and she wouldn&#39;t have asked if she didn&#39;t trust you.  Really,<br/>
is seems she asked to keep you close to her, emotionally, not to move<br/>
further away.   <br/>
<br/>
You know Dylan is only fourteen and this hasn&#39;t come up at our house but<br/>
I&#39;d say yes as long as there was no danger from the other kids parents. <br/>
You know, no crazy father with a shotgun. &lt;g&gt;   You don&#39;t think redneck<br/>
neighbors will burn his house down, do you? <br/>
<br/>
Can you call her at work and tell her you&#39;re sorry and offer some money<br/>
so they can order a pizza or something? &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>treated?&lt;&lt;<br/>
   <br/>
  This is a great bit of advice!!  =)  <br/>
   <br/>
  My oldest turns 15 next month and hasn&#39;t shown a great interest in guys yet.   My post is more about my own personal experiences and how I won&#39;t EVER make my kids feel the way I did when I was a teen.  Although I am close with my mom and we get along NOW, it wasn&#39;t always like that, and I really think the past did irreparable damage to the relationship.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I was 18, had been dating my bf for 2 years, was in my senior year of school,  was working 30 hours a week,  and had saved up my own money to go out and visit then bf/now dh in CA where he was newly stationed after bootcamp (USMC).  We made no secret to anyone that we planned to get married eventually.<br/>
   <br/>
  I bought my own plane tickets- IN SECRET- because my mom would have tried to stop me even though I was legally an adult at this point and 3 months from graduating high school.  I figured after buying them, she wouldn&#39;t stop me.  So off I went to CA for a 10 day vacation with my mom&#39;s final words to me as I left &quot;If you get pregnant, I won&#39;t pay for the kind of wedding you want to have. You can go to City Hall and elope, and you won&#39;t stay here through graduation, either.&quot;  (Nevermind that I had gone to the dr with her knowledge a year previously and gotten on BC pills to be proactive and SMART.)  <br/>
   <br/>
  So my point...  I tried to be open with my parents and I tried to have a mature relationship with them since I was young, and especially when I hit teenage years.  I tried to prove to them that I was trustworthy and smart, but I still knew I needed to sneak about to do things I really wanted to that didn&#39;t meet with my mom&#39;s life plan for me- like buying plane tickets.<br/>
   <br/>
  My dad was very open with me and while he wouldn&#39;t have chosen the paths I did, he didn&#39;t threaten me with ultimatums or call me a bad person.  Me and my dad have a WONDERFUL relationship and always have.  My mom on the other hand went through my stuff, tried to find secrets I was keeping, and threatened to take back things she&#39;d offered me (like the wedding when it came time for that or my home and the ability to finish the last few months of school to graduation). <br/>
   <br/>
  I did graduate- didn&#39;t get pregnant on my 10 day trip- and I got married at the end of that July when I was 18 and flew the coop clear across the US.  I couldn&#39;t imagine dealing with being an adult, working, going to college, visiting with BF, and eventually planning a wedding, and knowing that &quot;as long as I lived under her roof&quot; I&#39;d still have to obey all of her rules, all of her insane ideas of what a proper child, proper woman, and proper future wife should be (think June Cleaver).  <br/>
   <br/>
  Had she not been so oppressive in her &quot;this is how a girl acts&quot; and &quot;I&#39;m the mom and I know best&quot; song and dance, I&#39;d not have felt the need to run clear across the country so early. I&#39;d have gotten a lot more college done and I&#39;d have been a lot better financially when I did finally marry dh. <br/>
   <br/>
  If our kids are willing to come to us and let us in on their lives, their &quot;secrets&quot; and inner thoughts, and ask for our feelings on things, it&#39;s such a disservice to the relationship to shut them out or shut them down with a quick &quot;that&#39;s not smart&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.  And god forbid we put them in a position of having to sneak or making them feel Less because their plans aren&#39;t what we would do. <br/>

Good!<br/>
<br/>
Sleeping in a house isn&#39;t having sex.  Sleeping in the same bed isn&#39;t  <br/>
even having sex (as parents with several children know better than  <br/>
anyone else. &lt;bwg&gt;)<br/>

I&#39;m pretty level-headed, but I had my first kiss at a co-ed sleepover<br/>
with longtime friends when I was 15, and then the sexual activity<br/>
(between the two of us) escalated pretty fast and was hard for me to<br/>
control.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Were you in the same room with several other kids?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many kids have their first kiss followed by escalating sexual  <br/>
activity they find hard to control in a car, or in the woods, or  <br/>
behind the barn, or somewhere that isn&#39;t a &quot;co-ed sleepover.&quot;<br/>

  If our kids are willing to come to us and let us in on their lives, <br/>
their &quot;secrets&quot; and inner thoughts, and ask for our feelings on things, <br/>
it&#39;s such a disservice to the relationship to shut them out or shut <br/>
them down with a quick &quot;that&#39;s not smart&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. And god forbid we <br/>
put them in a position of having to sneak or making them feel Less <br/>
because their plans aren&#39;t what we would do.<br/>
<br/>

  I spoke a little about this in Peabody last week. Parents encourage <br/>
creative, curious exploration...until the child turns into a <br/>
teen---then they put on some hard brakes. That just makes NO sense!<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m sure many people (probably even some folks on *this* list! &lt;G&gt;) <br/>
think I take this too seriously and maybe too far.<br/>
<br/>
  I *NEVER* want my kids to be afraid of telling me *ANYTHING*. Cam & I <br/>
have a *very* open relationship regarding love, sex, drinking, drugs, <br/>
and rock & roll. I might not agree with all his choices, but he knows I <br/>
will be there if they don&#39;t work out the way he thought they would. I&#39;m <br/>
here to help and work *with* him.<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s got to be really empowering! To know that someone is on your <br/>
side, no matter what.<br/>
<br/>
  My dad was pretty good, but even he had some hot buttons. I struggle <br/>
through mine---not always gracefully! But I try really hard to work <br/>
them out before I need them! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 Duncan&#39;s really going to luck out! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  &quot;The hardest problem for the brain is not learning, but forgetting. No <br/>
matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t deliberately forget something we have <br/>
learned, and that is catastrophic if we learn that we can&#39;t learn.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1325367226">Yeah, but...<br/>
it was terrorists, who seem to like their dates,<br/>
they only intended to strike in Toronto, <br/>
and <br/>
the RCMP and local police busted them last week.<br/>
