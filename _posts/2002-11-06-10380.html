&gt;  Sounds like an idea. My kids have never seen a theme park. We<br/>
&gt; are deprived in the UK and I&#39;m afriad I&#39;ve always had this veiw that<br/>
&gt; they are tacky and over-priced, crowded and noisy.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a mountains and scenery type of person myself. I could spend<br/>
&gt; all day just gawping at mountains as I did in the Himalaya once.<br/>
&gt; Snow covered peaks, moonlight. It was awesome.<br/>
&gt; Maybe I&#39;m just weird.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think you&#39;re weird for being a mountains and scenery type of person!<br/>
I so love being outdoors in the mountains and snow - and we don&#39;t get a lot<br/>
of that here in the desert! (but there are mountains here and it&#39;s nice to<br/>
see them).<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s fun doing the touristy theme park stuff too, if you can bear with<br/>
them being tacky and over-priced and crowded and noisy. ;-) After it&#39;s all<br/>
said and done, you tend to forget about all the bad stuff and just be left<br/>
with all the fun things you did for your memories.<br/>

If you homeschool (as you do) and can go to theme parks on a school day<br/>
then you can see that it&#39;s JUST as tacky and JUST as over-priced BUT<br/>
it&#39;s only HALF as crowded.  Something to sing about!<br/>
