&lt;&lt; So, how do the rest of you deal with state requirements? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, to be honest with you, for two years I haven&#39;t.<br/>
If you don&#39;t report to them, the law doesn&#39;t apply to you.<br/>
I&#39;m not suggesting anyone follow suit, but it has been nice around here <br/>
without worrying about state laws and how to deal with the red tape.<br/>
I am planning to register with the umbrella school I posted the link for.<br/>
It has no requirements other than attendance, which I can just put x&#39;s on a <br/>
calender sheet for.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am already enrolled my DS with the umbrella school<br/>
(Alternative Education Institute) for which Ren posted<br/>
a link. There is another school similar,which is $10<br/>
cheaper. It is named Florida Unschoolers. However, AEI<br/>
is only $10 per child (pays for a little of what<br/>
Krista has to supply to be a school)  Links and<br/>
explanations are posted on the Florida_Unschooling<br/>
list, for which Ren also posted a link. More on these<br/>
subjects is available in the message files of<br/>
Florida_Unschooling. There is also the Florida Law<br/>
list which deals with legislation and the laws and how<br/>
they apply .... or don&#39;t. <br/>
<br/>
Evaluations (with portfolio and book/media list) are<br/>
due at the end of the public school year. Real soon.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Rebecca, I just checked the members list at<br/>
Florida_Unschooling.....you ARE already a member. You<br/>
have even posted.....some Floridians are also members<br/>
of this list. And some folks move around!<br/>
<br/>
Are we getting you mixed up?  I&#39;ll post info about get<br/>
togethers, umbrella schools, Florida links, etc on<br/>
that list so as not to clutter up this list with stuff<br/>
that is of no interest to folks in other states. Each<br/>
state has different requirements. <br/>
<br/>
I will post to you on Florida_Unschoolers about the<br/>
zoo (I, also, have a membership), perhaps some others<br/>
would like to go too. OK?<br/>
