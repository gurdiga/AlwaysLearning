It&#39;s not very long.  She did a lot of reading, talked with me for a long time and asked lots of questions by e-mail.  I&#39;ve known her since she was young, before she was married, and it&#39;s sad for me to see that she opted to be childless because school was so painful for her.<br/>

Although this could be interesting to some people who are curious about unschooling, I think there&#39;s no better intro than Pam Laricchia&#39;s book (soon to be books).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2023217697">Thank you for posting this! I find this sort of stuff fascinating.<br/>
<br/>
From the mini-thesis:<br/>
<br/>
==However, the results of this study indicate that individual agency prevents unschoolers from being subjugated by the powerful discourses of mainstream schooling society relating to education and success. Pierre Bourdieu (1930-2002), another French social theorist writing in the 1970s and 1980s, theorized that social relationships are created by the talk and action of individuals (Erickson and Murphy 2008:187). Bourdieu believed that individuals, not powerful systems, create symbolic capital (Erickson and Murphy 2008:188). Bourdieu&#39;s theory is applicable to the findings in this study that unschoolers have redefined &quot;a good education&quot; and &quot;success&quot; through powerful discourses (not &quot;discourses of power&quot;) and action.==<br/>
<br/>
I think this process of individuals redefining &quot;education&quot; and &quot;success&quot; has benefitted greatly from the technology of our day. Access to information is empowering. It encourages bravery and action. If I know I can get information on any subject in the whole wide world, and I have the confidence in my ability to find it, I no longer need experts to dispense it to me.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I do not think I would have ever stumbled upon unschooling - or been able to delve deeply enough into it to later choose it - had it not been for the internet. So the discourse is ever more powerful thanks to access to information, other unschoolers, and archives of past discourses.<br/>
<br/>
==My research on unschooling generally supports the idea that a good education leads to<br/>
success. However, the unschooler&#39;s definitions of a &quot;good education&quot; and &quot;success&quot; differ significantly from that of mainstream schooling society. For unschoolers, pursuit of the concepts and skills which are interesting and useful in living one&#39;s life is education enough to happily achieve whatever goal an individual might set for himself.==<br/>
<br/>
I saw Pam Sorooshian speak this summer and she emphasized the importance of keeping the little flame of curiosity alive within our kids - not snuffing out the innate desire to learn. That concept really resonated with me. I think about it a lot and sometimes ask myself, &quot;Am I protecting my kid&#39;s flame in this moment? Or snuffing it out?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Reading the mini-thesis made me want to further break unschooling down into its core concepts. For my family, it looks like:<br/>
<br/>
1) Keep alive the flame of my child&#39;s curiosity (via loving them, patience, listening, partnering, respecting, not testing).<br/>
<br/>
2) Give my child access to the world (via technology, groups, friends, family, strewing, facilitating, answering questions, adventures, travel).<br/>
<br/>
3) The learning takes care of itself.<br/>

Thanks again for sharing. I enjoy playing around with ideas like this, and mulling on them.<br/>
