<div id="ygrps-yiv-2041415395">For half an hour Thursday morning my account was turned off.   That&#39;s a big <br/>
drag for me, as quite a bit of mail can bounce in that much time.    Please, if <br/>
you send me something and it bounced, send it again.<br/>
<br/>
An evil e-mailing program used my address last night to send out over 900 <br/>
copies of an e-mail called &quot;please do this.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope you didn&#39;t get one.<br/>
<br/>
If you got one, I&#39;m sorry; I hope you didn&#39;t open it.   It&#39;s a website <br/>
claiming to be about t-shirts, but it&#39;s just an e-mail collecting thing.   If you <br/>
haven&#39;t opened that e-mail, GOOD.   Just delete it.    I didn&#39;t send it but it <br/>
surely clearly LOOKS like it did, because that&#39;s something their ugly program <br/>
can do.<br/>
<br/>
If you opened it and didn&#39;t go to the webpage, GOOD.   Then it&#39;s not likely <br/>
to happen to you.   <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for the trouble, but when people DO get that &quot;please do this&quot; it <br/>
never really comes from the person it seems to have come from (which seems to be <br/>
always someone whose e-mail that person recognizes).    There ought to be a <br/>
law. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
