I&#39;ve met Susan and her family, and I believe she could go five years without <br/>
yelling.  Her husband is really sweet and her girls are off the scale of <br/>
peaceable and helpful and interested in things.  Probably a lot of that is <br/>
due to Susan being such a good mom and wife.<br/>
<br/>
Puts me to shame, but I compensate by...<br/>
<br/>
(thinking...)<br/>
playing recorder, or something.  <br/>
