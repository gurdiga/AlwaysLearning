<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121227731"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;It came from my first statements, from prior discussions here and <br/>
&gt;&gt;elsewhere, from a lifetime of considering this&#39;n&#39;that.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understand that. It just seemed a big leap to make in this particular <br/>
context. All spiritual roads do not have to lead to a life of religious <br/>
subjugation.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I don&#39;t have a good way to indicate except to keep saying it occasionally <br/>
&gt;&gt;that I&#39;m not responding to one single person&#39;s ideas or statements, but <br/>
&gt;&gt;talking about the ideas themselves.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But the ideas being presented, in my opinion, did not point to the idea of <br/>
giving over any part of one&#39;s life to that idea. That&#39;s going back to <br/>
religious juju. Not the point I was making.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Anyone living for heaven or a gypsy prophecy ten years away, or to grow up <br/>
&gt;&gt;and be real is missing the moment.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Very true. I guess I still don&#39;t see what that has to do with the idea of <br/>
possibilities. My denseness, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;The souls choosing their own new lives thing is a slice of the<br/>
 </span></blockquote>marginal, not a big liklihood.  Yet lots of people seem attached to the <br/>
idea, and seem to base their decisions on it.  Souls being bound to one <br/>
another from past lives being a basis for life&#39;s decisions.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you give an example of which life&#39;s decisions you&#39;re referring to?<br/>

Marriage?<br/>
Divorce?<br/>
Leaving a man for another man because of the perception that the new guy was <br/>
from a former lifetime.  <br/>
<br/>
Staying with one child over others because the two of you were lovers in <br/>
another lifetime (I know of only one case of that, and it&#39;s an only child, <br/>
but the mother has barely let him out of her sight and he&#39;s 16 now; she did <br/>
trust us enough to leave him at our house a couple of times while she went to <br/>
a store 1/4 mile away).  Her adult, retarded brother had been molested by a <br/>
priest 30 years ago, but the son has probably never SEEN a priest.<br/>
<br/>
I grew up near Santa Fe, a magnet for new age weirdos.  And if it&#39;s not all <br/>
unscientific weirdo stuff, that&#39;s fine, but that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t <br/>
attract a bunch of unscentific weirdos.  <br/>

say I met a bunch of unscientific weirdos, though. I met lots of people who <br/>
held wildly ranging beliefs, even some who claimed to have no belief system <br/>
at all. Some who acted strangely, some who had found real peace, some who <br/>
were obviously still searching, none I would label as a weirdo.<br/>
<br/>
I do know, though, that I had a harder time exploring all of these ideas <br/>
while still living there. For me, it was something about being surrounded by <br/>
people who &quot;know&quot; the truth, whatever it may be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677071048">I&#39;ve met lots and lots and lots of them (my weirdo growing-up center was <br/>
Berkeley, and science fiction conventions).<br/>
<br/>

Is it more harmful to say, &quot;We were once together on the planet Zybot and<br/>

Well, yeah, I think it is more harmful. At least with the second it&#39;s<br/>
honestly selfish instead of meant for a higher purpose.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In either case it sounds like a sucky decision. And such extreme examples do <br/>
not alter my belief in the possibilities of the universe. We can find <br/>
extremes at both ends of the spectrum, from fundamentalists to new age <br/>
&quot;weirdos&quot;. Focusing our attention on the existence of these two ends does <br/>
not allow for examination of the vast middle ground in between. The idea <br/>
that there are possibly things we do not yet understand, and that some <br/>
people may be more sensitive to these things than others. And that many <br/>
people can live with these possibilities and still manage to remain <br/>
non-dogmatic, living in the moment, with full and loving attention to family <br/>
and friends.<br/>

I think so too, and partly because of the fatalism and the excusing of <br/>
responsibility that sometimes goes with it, or the blaming of the victim.  <br/>
Rather than work to find a good working relationship with someone, some <br/>
people say they were enemies from another lifetime, or that the other person <br/>
*obviously* has not learned his lessons from the *last* time they were <br/>
married.<br/>
<br/>
Basically it just gags me when people say of an abused wife or child that <br/>
they chose their situation this lifetime because they had lessons to learn, <br/>
blah blah.<br/>

They Are. Of course, I am comfortable describing myself as a freak. Go <br/>
figure.<br/>
