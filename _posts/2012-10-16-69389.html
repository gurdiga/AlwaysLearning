<div id="ygrps-yiv-1270805317"> Has anyone ever has a problem with one child stealing from her siblings? I have a 7yr old (not unschooled)and 2 older children. (first year unschooling them)It seems that the 7 yr. old has a sneaking habit of going into others things and keeping them. I have discussed this with her and asked her to talk to the owner before taking, or talking to me about getting her own things...Is there something else I can do.( She has even gone into my things and taken items from a special drawer of mementos from my mom whom has passed away before she was born...I explained she can look through these things with me and we can talk about them..)<br/>
In my previous world before unschooling and growing  in mind and understanding I would punish but I realise that doesn&#39;t work. so Any ideas would be helpful...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Since this has been going on for a while, have you asked her why she&#39;s stealing? Ask her in a non-critical-of-her-feelings way. Tell her you want to figure out what she&#39;s feeling that makes her want to take other people&#39;s things so you can help her get what she needs without hurting other people.<br/>
<br/>
Emphasize that you want to help her. And you want to help other people in the family feel like their possessions are safe.<br/>

That might help you talk to her in a way that helps her open up.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-380922608">Maybe you could talk about crows collecting things, or packrats.  There&#39;s an instinct in some people to collect.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you can make her a good place to collect things, and take her to yard sales or thrift stores to collect things for her box or shelves or whatever.  If she doesn&#39;t feel abundance, then she might need more things that are hers.<br/>
