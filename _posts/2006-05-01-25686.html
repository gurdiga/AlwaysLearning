  When people say the unschooling isn&#39;t working,  I&#39;m wondering what they<br/>
are basing this on.  Are kids complaining? **<br/>
<br/>
I will confess that I was kind of falling into this trap, early on.  When my<br/>
kid was 7 or 8, I kept waiting for him to be have an interest in something<br/>
semi-academic -- Ancient Egypt or bugs or something.  (Then I probably would<br/>
have buried him under an avalanche of &quot;enriching&quot; ideas.)  I was kind of<br/>
selective in my thinking.  It took me awhile to realize that he did have an<br/>
interest, a strong interest in Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I had the very same thing happen to me and I am still dealing with it.<br/>
My youngest has become interested in paintball....boy, have I opened my mind<br/>
to somethings around that.  I continue to &quot;push&quot; some of my ideas,<br/>
interests, etc. and we have a discipline of reading everyday (he has been<br/>
labeled dyslexic)...I let him choose what we read but we do read and we do<br/>
play around with math facts from time to time.  I&#39;m not a purist(unschooler)<br/>
and have no wish to be, but more and more I see the value in giving my kids<br/>
as much freedom to choose as I can responsibly tolerate.<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that has concerned me about things like video games and<br/>
pokeman cards is the fact that there is an enormous promotion via the media<br/>
machine out there selling this stuff to our kids.  So I feel quite strongly<br/>
about my continued role as parent in checking these things out, but mostly,<br/>
my kids are good at choosing for themselves what&#39;s appropriate.   <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s hard, in the beginning, to get over the idea that kids need to<br/>
learn most of the same &quot;subject matter&quot; as school kids.  I was the kind of<br/>
kid who always sat around with a book, often a historical novel, and one of<br/>
my best friends has a homeschooled daughter much like me.  In the early<br/>
days, that was what I kind of imagined that my son would turn out like.<br/>
(Strange, but true.)<br/>
