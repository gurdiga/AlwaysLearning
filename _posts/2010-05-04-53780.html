<div id="ygrps-yiv-98682883">Of my 3 sons,  I have one, Aidan, who is 12, who loves to dig holes and has since he was very small.  He presently wants to dig a hole under our backyard fort, and make an underground room.  His most ambitious hole was years ago, and the thing he was going for was to have it be big and deep enough that he could jump down into it and be hidden, which he did manage to do (he was about 5 I think).   Another son, Finn, who&#39;s 8, digs into the earth to plant things and to look for bugs, worms and treasures.   We all love to dig and scrounge for fossils which are abundant where we live.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite hole idea right now is to dig a hobbit hole with a round door!  Now I just need to find somewhere to do it...<br/>
<br/>
Fun question!<br/>
