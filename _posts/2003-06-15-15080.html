<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370845106">Hi!<br/>
I am a Girl Scout leader, and I have not always been<br/>
happy with the Girl Scout Councils.  They say they<br/>
want girls to learn leadership and independence, but<br/>
then they have the girls fundraise for the Council. <br/>
Girl Scouts keep anywhere from 30 cents to 50 cents a<br/>
box for the cookies they sell.  Not exactly a great<br/>
business deal.  Selling cookies is a tremendous amount<br/>
of work...as well as a tremendous liability...because<br/>
you have to send Council the money on the due date<br/>
whether the troop sold the boxes or not.  They want<br/>
you to order hundreds extra and do booths, but<br/>
sometimes you have good sales and sometimes you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
The Councils also have so many rules and regulations. <br/>
Whew! They can overwhelm leaders at times.  Ah hem. <br/>
My assistant and I do break quite a few though at<br/>
times! ; )<br/>
<br/>
I am having a senior&#39;s moment....the woman who did the<br/>
reptile show for our homeschool group...can&#39;t remember<br/>
her name, but anyway, she wanted to display and<br/>
discuss venomous and non-venomous snakes at a Girl<br/>
Scout workshop for leaders.  She said she didn&#39;t want<br/>
to take up anyone&#39;s time.  But people could&#39;ve looked<br/>
at them during the breaks.  They told her that snakes<br/>
weren&#39;t allowed at the camp.  She told me that she<br/>
couldn&#39;t help laughing and asked the Council if they<br/>
thought there weren&#39;t any snakes at the camp.  They<br/>
told her that snakes were too traumatic for many women<br/>
and girls.  In fact, that Council doesn&#39;t want you to<br/>
say snake if you see one. You have to call it in on<br/>
the walkie-talkie and say, &quot;I have spotted Mr.<br/>
No-Shoulders.&quot;  The reptile woman...smile...I can&#39;t<br/>
stand it when I can&#39;t remember people&#39;s names... said<br/>
she wouldn&#39;t have believed it if she hadn&#39;t heard it<br/>
herself. She said instead of teaching the leaders<br/>
about snakes, and there are plenty at the camp, the<br/>
leaders learned how to make a campfire using candy. I<br/>
laughed hysterically because we did the same thing at<br/>
my training!!  I live in the Low Country, so I would<br/>
have loved to have been up close with a diamondback<br/>
rattler so I would know what it looked like in case my<br/>
troop and I come across one.<br/>
<br/>
A service unit on another occasion had asked her to do<br/>
workshops for their weekend camp for girls.  She said<br/>
she thought it would be better if she taught the<br/>
cadettes and then they could teach the other girls. <br/>
She would be more of a mentor.  She said she had no<br/>
desire to be the sage on the stage.  She thought this<br/>
was about girls and leadership.  Apparently not!<br/>
&lt;grin&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, the leaders of the service unit decided to call<br/>
the weekend Creepy Crawly Thangs.  She said that she<br/>
told them that she had hoped that she could talk with<br/>
the girls before a title was picked, but they said no.<br/>
 She bowed out because she said a lot of folks in our<br/>
state kill everything that moves as it is...and if<br/>
something is creepy and crawly and a THANG, then they<br/>
really will kill it.  She said she knows that she will<br/>
never get asked to do anything again. <br/>
<br/>
All this to say that you gotta remember that if you do<br/>
Girl Scouts that there are headaches too.  My<br/>
headaches were more around the cookie sales.  We sold<br/>
so many boxes and got so little money back.  The other<br/>
thing is that the paperwork is voluminous.  Truly<br/>
voluminous.  Then, even if your girls vote on a field<br/>
trip or activity, then some Councils insist everything<br/>
goes through them.  There can&#39;t be much spontaneity<br/>
because there are deadlines and usually they are a<br/>
month to 3 weeks in advance of the event.  <br/>
<br/>
My Council prefers that troops be all the same age. <br/>
This is very different from Boy Scouts where the older<br/>
boys can role model and teach the younger ones.<br/>
<br/>
My assistant and I always let our girls decide stuff.<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t want to do something, we help them<br/>
find the resource people or whatever to do what they<br/>
want.  There aren&#39;t as many cadette and Senior troops<br/>
as there are Brownies and Juniors.  Girls won&#39;t stay<br/>
in an organization that tells them what to do all the<br/>
time or puts limits on everything.  My troop wants me<br/>
to convert our troop to a Boy Scout Venturers group<br/>
when they all turn 14.<br/>
<br/>
There was something else I was going to say...I think<br/>
I need an herb for memory!!  Oh, I know.  Some<br/>
Councils have their own political agenda. I am pretty<br/>
liberal myself, but I am not into trying to convince<br/>
anyone else to believe what I believe or what Council<br/>
believes.  They sent out this letter that encouraged<br/>
us not to support Bush. I don&#39;t think it is right for<br/>
me to express my views on Presidential candidates. <br/>
Now I wouldn&#39;t be against having the girls discuss how<br/>
one evaluates candidates.  This is just one example.  <br/>
There were other political issues that are<br/>
controversial that I avoid...like abortion.  I don&#39;t<br/>
want to tell my girls what to think.  I would rather<br/>
teach them how to evaluate positions.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, that is my two cents...or was that ten?...on<br/>
Girl Scouting!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1705169641">Holly can always join our troop.  We have a few girls who travel quite a <br/>
ways to be in my nonreligious non schoolie troop, but HOlly would get <br/>
the longest distance award.  <br/>
<br/>
All troops are different and a troop is only as good as the leaders. <br/>
 And yes, there are sometimes conflicts with council or sumanagers.  I <br/>
know.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438547383">About fund raising for the council, some of that money goes back to <br/>
troops in different ways.  For instance, it covers SAS money, for girls <br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re only involved with younger girls, you may not have seriously  <br/>
looked at the new program for older girls, Studio2B, but you should. I  <br/>
have been involved with girl scouts my whole life - as a scout myself  <br/>
and through Daisies to Seniors with my older girls. I would avoid  <br/>
scouts now, if I was just getting started - because all they have to  <br/>
look forward to is Studio2B and, not to pull any punches, I think it  <br/>
really really really REALLY STINKS.<br/>

Look at www.studio2b.org for a glimpse of what is coming to,  <br/>
eventually, replace cadette and senior girl scouting.<br/>

&gt;&gt; want girls to learn leadership and independence, but<br/>
&gt;&gt; then they have the girls fundraise for the Council.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Girl Scouts keep anywhere from 30 cents to 50 cents a<br/>
&gt;&gt; box for the cookies they sell.  Not exactly a great<br/>
&gt;&gt; business deal.  Selling cookies is a tremendous amount<br/>
&gt;&gt; of work...as well as a tremendous liability...because<br/>
&gt;&gt; you have to send Council the money on the due date<br/>
&gt;&gt; whether the troop sold the boxes or not.  They want<br/>
&gt;&gt; you to order hundreds extra and do booths, but<br/>
&gt;&gt; sometimes you have good sales and sometimes you don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; The Councils also have so many rules and regulations.<br/>
&gt;&gt; Whew! They can overwhelm leaders at times.  Ah hem.<br/>
&gt;&gt; My assistant and I do break quite a few though at<br/>
&gt;&gt; times! ; )<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I am having a senior&#39;s moment....the woman who did the<br/>
&gt;&gt; reptile show for our homeschool group...can&#39;t remember<br/>
&gt;&gt; her name, but anyway, she wanted to display and<br/>
&gt;&gt; discuss venomous and non-venomous snakes at a Girl<br/>
&gt;&gt; Scout workshop for leaders.  She said she didn&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;&gt; to take up anyone&#39;s time.  But people could&#39;ve looked<br/>
&gt;&gt; at them during the breaks.  They told her that snakes<br/>
&gt;&gt; weren&#39;t allowed at the camp.  She told me that she<br/>
&gt;&gt; couldn&#39;t help laughing and asked the Council if they<br/>
&gt;&gt; thought there weren&#39;t any snakes at the camp.  They<br/>
&gt;&gt; told her that snakes were too traumatic for many women<br/>
&gt;&gt; and girls.  In fact, that Council doesn&#39;t want you to<br/>
&gt;&gt; say snake if you see one. You have to call it in on<br/>
&gt;&gt; the walkie-talkie and say, &quot;I have spotted Mr.<br/>
&gt;&gt; No-Shoulders.&quot;  The reptile woman...smile...I can&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; stand it when I can&#39;t remember people&#39;s names... said<br/>
&gt;&gt; she wouldn&#39;t have believed it if she hadn&#39;t heard it<br/>
&gt;&gt; herself. She said instead of teaching the leaders<br/>
&gt;&gt; about snakes, and there are plenty at the camp, the<br/>
&gt;&gt; leaders learned how to make a campfire using candy. I<br/>
&gt;&gt; laughed hysterically because we did the same thing at<br/>
&gt;&gt; my training!!  I live in the Low Country, so I would<br/>
&gt;&gt; have loved to have been up close with a diamondback<br/>
&gt;&gt; rattler so I would know what it looked like in case my<br/>
&gt;&gt; troop and I come across one.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; A service unit on another occasion had asked her to do<br/>
&gt;&gt; workshops for their weekend camp for girls.  She said<br/>
&gt;&gt; she thought it would be better if she taught the<br/>
&gt;&gt; cadettes and then they could teach the other girls.<br/>
&gt;&gt; She would be more of a mentor.  She said she had no<br/>
&gt;&gt; desire to be the sage on the stage.  She thought this<br/>
&gt;&gt; was about girls and leadership.  Apparently not!<br/>
&gt;&gt; &lt;grin&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Well, the leaders of the service unit decided to call<br/>
&gt;&gt; the weekend Creepy Crawly Thangs.  She said that she<br/>
&gt;&gt; told them that she had hoped that she could talk with<br/>
&gt;&gt; the girls before a title was picked, but they said no.<br/>
&gt;&gt; She bowed out because she said a lot of folks in our<br/>
&gt;&gt; state kill everything that moves as it is...and if<br/>
&gt;&gt; something is creepy and crawly and a THANG, then they<br/>
&gt;&gt; really will kill it.  She said she knows that she will<br/>
&gt;&gt; never get asked to do anything again.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; All this to say that you gotta remember that if you do<br/>
&gt;&gt; Girl Scouts that there are headaches too.  My<br/>
&gt;&gt; headaches were more around the cookie sales.  We sold<br/>
&gt;&gt; so many boxes and got so little money back.  The other<br/>
&gt;&gt; thing is that the paperwork is voluminous.  Truly<br/>
&gt;&gt; voluminous.  Then, even if your girls vote on a field<br/>
&gt;&gt; trip or activity, then some Councils insist everything<br/>
&gt;&gt; goes through them.  There can&#39;t be much spontaneity<br/>
&gt;&gt; because there are deadlines and usually they are a<br/>
&gt;&gt; month to 3 weeks in advance of the event.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; My Council prefers that troops be all the same age.<br/>
&gt;&gt; This is very different from Boy Scouts where the older<br/>
&gt;&gt; boys can role model and teach the younger ones.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; My assistant and I always let our girls decide stuff.<br/>
&gt;&gt; If someone doesn&#39;t want to do something, we help them<br/>
&gt;&gt; find the resource people or whatever to do what they<br/>
&gt;&gt; want.  There aren&#39;t as many cadette and Senior troops<br/>
&gt;&gt; as there are Brownies and Juniors.  Girls won&#39;t stay<br/>
&gt;&gt; in an organization that tells them what to do all the<br/>
&gt;&gt; time or puts limits on everything.  My troop wants me<br/>
&gt;&gt; to convert our troop to a Boy Scout Venturers group<br/>
&gt;&gt; when they all turn 14.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; There was something else I was going to say...I think<br/>
&gt;&gt; I need an herb for memory!!  Oh, I know.  Some<br/>
&gt;&gt; Councils have their own political agenda. I am pretty<br/>
&gt;&gt; liberal myself, but I am not into trying to convince<br/>
&gt;&gt; anyone else to believe what I believe or what Council<br/>
&gt;&gt; believes.  They sent out this letter that encouraged<br/>
&gt;&gt; us not to support Bush. I don&#39;t think it is right for<br/>

&gt;&gt; controversial that I avoid...like abortion.  I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;&gt; want to tell my girls what to think.  I would rather<br/>
&gt;&gt; teach them how to evaluate positions.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Well, that is my two cents...or was that ten?...on<br/>

&gt; If you&#39;re only involved with younger girls, you may not have seriously <br/>
&gt; looked at the new program for older girls, Studio2B, but you should. I <br/>
&gt; have been involved with girl scouts my whole life - as a scout myself <br/>
&gt; and through Daisies to Seniors with my older girls. I would avoid <br/>
&gt; scouts now, if I was just getting started - because all they have to <br/>
&gt; look forward to is Studio2B and, not to pull any punches, I think it <br/>
&gt; really really really REALLY STINKS.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Look at www.studio2b.org for a glimpse of what is coming to, <br/>
&gt; eventually, replace cadette and senior girl scouting.<br/>

&gt; &gt; About fund raising for the council, some of that money goes back to<br/>
&gt; &gt; troops in different ways.  For instance, it covers SAS money, for girls<br/>
&gt; &gt; who can&#39;t pay to join.  It also covers other scholarship, including<br/>
&gt; &gt; camping ones.  Some troops in our area use those scholarships a lot.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  THere is also money available for uniforms, supplies, etc. from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; council, and the paperwork isn&#39;t so bad.  I do have compl,aints about<br/>
&gt; &gt; girl scouts. I think they are less family friendly than they could be,<br/>
&gt; &gt; at a council level, but in our troop we are countering that.  My <br/>
&gt; &gt; service<br/>
&gt; &gt; unit manager is a pain in the ass, and doesn&#39;t like me at all (she is<br/>
&gt; &gt; extremely catholic, extremely schooling, extremely following all the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rules no matter what) and this is causing lots of problems. I am trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to figure out how to solve this because it simply isn&#39;t working.<br/>

Scouts is fine if you&#39;re not looking for a long-term relationship &lt;G&gt; <br/>
with an organization, I suppose, but I would really NOT get myself very <br/>
involved with it right at this particular time. The new older girls <br/>
(older means 11 to 17 year olds) program seems like it is based on <br/>
Seventeen Magazine or something - I really think people are going to be <br/>
terribly disappointed in it as their daughters get older.<br/>
<br/>
4H seems to get better as kids get older - has more of an unschooling <br/>
nature to it, too. Kids focus on projects they have a particular <br/>
interest in - and it has that experiential aspect too - and all kinds <br/>
of learning are fully respected.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is looking for another really wonderful organization to get <br/>
hooked up with, I&#39;d recommend taking a look at Destination Imagination, <br/>
too. I&#39;ve managed a DI team for the past 2 years and the kids have <br/>
really really loved it. It is hard to explain what it is - so if you <br/>
think you might be interested in creative problem solving, just spend <br/>
some time browsing around on the website at <br/>
www.destinationimagination.org.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1969204368">I was a  Girl scout leadr for many years. my daughter and another home school <br/>
child in area  both want to go into it the mother of other child was leader <br/>
and a homeschool parent. We have decided to  start our ouwn troop with just <br/>
our girls or do what G.S. call indivaual troop list the girls seperately so we <br/>
can take advantige or  the girl scout places and trips. It was important to us <br/>
the girls choose what they want to do. When I was the leader for my other <br/>
daughters troop I caught a lot of static as I went by what the G.S. told me it <br/>
was there troop and they set goals and  choose what they wanted to learn or <br/>
do. It was just my job to help them.I did this and  the parents called a <br/>
meeting saying I was  to helpful and they where to busy that allowing them to  <br/>
choose was bad. we had to call in the local councial who said nope cant  do <br/>
this to our leader that was what G.S.is about.The girls in my Troop loved it <br/>
and kept me very very busy learning. so I could be the adult shaparone G.S. <br/>
asked theat I take some classes to learn the G.S camping and such the girls <br/>
loved doing things like making bread using the sun.must confess loking forward <br/>
to only a troop of 2 and  leting them set times and dates. but much else wont <br/>
be diffrent as it there troop and deal I will just do my job of taking the <br/>
classes to go where therey want to go, and help them decide or find resorses <br/>
on how to get there. every regestion in G/S alowes you and your child to be a <br/>
ind. troop and alows you if the cash flow isnt there to use there scolarship <br/>
program  say the girls decide they want to go to a zoo  or take  and make <br/>
puppet show cost for zoo trip 5 to get in fill put paper work they send the <br/>
girls, and they can do the same for there books and patches if they desire.I  <br/>
and lisa decided not to send her to a bigger troop in next town as they mostly <br/>
just do the craft and after school type of troop. she wants  to choose where <br/>
to go and how to be involved and the other girl in town  wants the same thing.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t kid yourself, cub scouts is no better about that.  In fact, the girl<br/>
scouts are still by age range (Brownies, Juniors, etc.), right?  Boy Scouts<br/>
is divided entirely by grade for Cub Scouts.  1st Graders are Tigers.  2nd<br/>
Graders are Wolves, etc.  Mixed age dens just don&#39;t exist many places.<br/>
Packs are mixed 1-5th grade, but don&#39;t do a whole lot together besides a<br/>
monthly meeting, just because that&#39;s a lot of boys.  Dens do more going<br/>
places, but it&#39;s all age divided.  And some of the requirements are very,<br/>
very schooly.  <br/>
<br/>
I do think that Boy Scouts and Venturing is better, but we do certainly have<br/>
massive council problems here, too.  All is not green on the other side of<br/>
the fence, unfortunately.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1200018673">I just finished my  2nd year as a troop leader, and my 4th year with mixed age troops.  The leader has a lot of freedom in running the troop, so a girl&#39;s experience really will depend on the leader.<br/>
<br/>
When I sat through my leader training, they discouraged mixed age troops.  I spoke up several times to say that our troop was mixed and that it was working well for us.  We&#39;ve always had brownies and juniors, and one year had daisies in addition.<br/>
<br/>
Our last two years we had girls aged 6 to 11.  Our troop had public-, private-, and homeschooled members.  Next year we are switching to a cooperative and all homeschooled troop that will be brownie, junior, and cadet.  We have enjoyed having the schooled girls in the troop, but being all homeschooled will allow us to schedule things during school hours.  Being cooperative will allow us more flexibility in activities and will spread the leader - load.<br/>
<br/>
Although I hate selling things, I will say that people seem to love buying girl scout cookies.  The council encourages us to sell as many as possible, but there is no pressure.  We are not even required to sell them.  But our troop members want to.  We use the money for troop supplies and for special events that the girls choose.  They have used the money to go rock climbing, horse vaulting, swimming, to a ceramics studio, bowling, mini-golf, and a pizza party.<br/>
<br/>
Probably my biggest dislike of girls scouts is the way that rewards are used.  The girls get prizes for selling cookies and they get badges for completing activities.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be happy to share ideas (pros and cons) with others interested in girl scouts.<br/>

of options though - and you don&#39;t have to stick with your own 4H club <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1006550401">I finally got a hold of the council person and after a bit of dicussion <br/>
confirmed that a.  the girl our SU Manager said could not fly up will <br/>
fly up, the restriction put on our new multilevel troop was no new <br/>
Juniors, not brownies, Taylor joined as a brownie so she is fine to fly <br/>
up.  b.  Our SU Manager will not be attending our ceremony and our <br/>
registration stuff will be taken care of by either our new SU Manager or <br/>
Claudia.  and C.  We will be changing Service Units and the council <br/>
person will call me tomorrow to tell me more about that...  <br/>
<br/>
So, maybe NOW it&#39;s solved.  Kathryn, please let your partner know this. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034575342">Hi!<br/>
I realize some of the money goes back to girls<br/>
indirectly, but in our case, it isn&#39;t much in terms of<br/>
the overall budget.  I apologize for my negativity,<br/>
but the some of the Councils I know don&#39;t do much.<br/>
<br/>
I would LOVE to change Councils. I didn&#39;t think you<br/>
could do that.  How do you go about doing that?<br/>
Is there any way that a troop can be part of National<br/>
but by pass a Council?  Our leader meetings are<br/>
*dreadful.*  <br/>
<br/>
Studio 2B...I will have to check out the website.  I<br/>
have heard good propaganda about it.  But Seventeen<br/>
Mag? Yuck.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like Girl Scouts, but my daughter does.  Our<br/>
troop is where her friends are, and we do a lot of fun<br/>
things together.  The girls like working on badges.  <br/>
<br/>
I tried 4H since I was a 4Her myself. Much better<br/>
organization overall, but not in SC.  Clemson<br/>
University is phasing out 4H.  I was told they would<br/>
like to get rid of it completely.  They will still<br/>
have it on paper, but they aren&#39;t putting any money<br/>
into agents salaries to support it.  They are putting<br/>
their money into the Youth Learning Institute for<br/>
at-risk kids and high priced camps.<br/>
<br/>
Pam, I would love to hear more specifics about what<br/>
you don&#39;t like about Studio 2B.  Is this the only<br/>
choice available? Can girls choose the traditional GS<br/>
route of cadette or senior?<br/>
<br/>
Boy Scout Venturers are looking better every day! My<br/>
troop is not just a homeschooling group.  We have a<br/>
mix. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Only for the next couple of years during the pilot period. Then the <br/>
program materials that are less frequently utilized will be phased out. <br/>
They&#39;ve already SAID that the cadette and senior program materials are <br/>
used by only a fraction of current members - so they are clearly <br/>
already sitting on the chopping block.<br/>
<br/>
The focus books are well-intentioned - but look at what&#39;s out there - <br/>
the first focus books for girls 11 to 17 years old.<br/>
Take Charge - talks about date rape and self-defense<br/>
Uniquely Me - Inside and Out -- it is about style and self-esteem<br/>
Uniquely Me - The Real Deal -- it is about having a PMA (positive <br/>
mental attitude) to deal with peer pressure<br/>
Looking In, Reaching Out -- it is about journaling and thinking about <br/>
one&#39;s own feelings<br/>
<br/>
There are now a few other focus books - one on writing, one on track <br/>
and field, and one on traveling.<br/>
<br/>
Contrast this to the Boy Scouts merit badges - on horseriding, <br/>
ceramics, camping, backpacking, carpentry, beekeeping, archery, drama, <br/>
engineering, and so on - dozens of them --- all REAL stuff to learn and <br/>
do and THEIR booklets have actual information in them to help the kids <br/>
learn.<br/>
<br/>
The girl scout focus books take the place of earning any kind of merit <br/>
badges - the girls buy the booklets ($5 to $6 each) and read them and <br/>
do the activities (answer some questions, mostly) and then set their <br/>
own goals. When they&#39;ve achieved their own goals, they can buy <br/>
themselves a little charm - for another $4 or $5.<br/>
<br/>
(I LIKE the setting their own goals aspect, by the way.)<br/>
<br/>
But - I have absolutely NO interest in my 12 yo daughter being treated <br/>
to such obtrusive pop psychology by somebody who volunteers to be her <br/>
girl scout leader. We don&#39;t share the same religion nor values in many <br/>
areas and certainly not at ALL the same kind of approach to discussing <br/>
these kinds of things. And - much of the material is very very <br/>
anti-family. Even the most innocuous focus book - the one about writing <br/>
- there is a section about how to write a persuasive essay to convince <br/>
your parents to let you go to an all-night party. I found it very <br/>
offensive. The attitude that parents and kids are adversaries is <br/>
pervasive in the materials. It is assumed that all teenage girls will <br/>
have hostility toward their parents. There is a section in one of them <br/>
where it suggests that it IS possible that they could EVEN have fun <br/>
with their family. The message is clear - normal teenage girls don&#39;t <br/>
like their families.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more - but I&#39;ll stop ranting for now &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
I was a girl scout for all of my childhood and have been involved as an <br/>
adult for 14 years. I&#39;ve won council-level awards honoring my work for <br/>
the organization. I&#39;m sickened by the direction the older girls&#39; <br/>
program is moving - I was hoping to see MORE real content, not this <br/>
pandering to the worst of society&#39;s view of teenage girls. I&#39;ve got <br/>
THREE teenage girls (well - two plus one almost there) and this program <br/>
is so unsuitable for them and their friends that, just reading about <br/>
it, they were very very insulted and offended.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if teenagers who go to school will now flock to it or <br/>
not - although I&#39;d be very surprised if they&#39;ll bother. I cannot <br/>
imagine it appealing to girls with real lives and real senses of <br/>
themselves. At best, it is fluff.<br/>

<br/>
I wanted to point out for people here who don&#39;t know Pam that this doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean (I don&#39;t THINK) that she would be opposed to an all-night party.  That was <br/>
not (I think) what was the offensive part (I&#39;m guessing).  (Pam&#39;s logged off <br/>
or I would get her to confirm before a qualify myself into mush.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The attitude that parents and kids are adversaries is <br/>
pervasive in the materials. It is assumed that all teenage girls will <br/>
have hostility toward their parents. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that was the yuck part for her.<br/>
<br/>
Last time our family was at the Sorooshian&#39;s, Keith and Holly and I were <br/>
sleeping in a camper in the driveway (Thanks again, Vilter-family!) while my <br/>
teenaged boys were in the house with HER teenaged girls and their daddy.   This, I <br/>
must admit, made me nervous.  Not that the boys would turn to casanova freaks, <br/>
but that the girls&#39; dad would be restless wondering, and not get to sleep <br/>
well in his own home.  But when I asked about it the next day, Pam seemed <br/>
breezily unconcerned, and that made me feel good.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course, parents WERE there (they were surrounded), but kids were awake <br/>
when others weren&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
Roya has been to Not Back to School Camp two or three times, and that&#39;s <br/>
certainly an overnight party.  A big one.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Uniquely Me - Inside and Out -- it is about style and self-esteem<br/>
Uniquely Me - The Real Deal -- it is about having a PMA (positive <br/>
mental attitude) to deal with peer pressure<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
We paid big bucks for some of that at John Robert Powers, because Holly loves <br/>
that girly stuff. <br/>
<br/>
When you first contrasted that list with the boy scout &quot;real&quot; stuff, Pam, my <br/>
first reaction was that inter- and intrapersonal stuff is as real as archery, <br/>
but the girls who have those skills already have them without girl scout <br/>
booklets, and those who don&#39;t have them are just going to be socializing (awkwardly <br/>
&lt;g&gt;) through it all anyway.    <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But - I have absolutely NO interest in my 12 yo daughter being treated <br/>
to such obtrusive pop psychology by somebody who volunteers to be her <br/>
girl scout leader. We don&#39;t share the same religion nor values in many <br/>
areas and certainly not at ALL the same kind of approach to discussing <br/>
these kinds of things.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  Bad enough the damage of a bad teacher (leaders are sometimes NOT <br/>
teacher-type, nor counselor type of personalities) when it comes to camp cooking or <br/>
theatre, without someone with no special knowledge or interest playing group <br/>
counsellor.<br/>
<br/>
Well it&#39;s interesting!  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a long time since Girl Scouts was...<br/>
I started to say something but I take it back.  I have a handbook from the <br/>
1940&#39;s (I think), one from the 60&#39;s, and have seen a few since (Holly&#39;s Juniors <br/>
book from not long ago) and they&#39;ve kinda kept up with the popular arts and <br/>
skills of the day, with social work thrown in (volunteerism with kids and the <br/>
elderly, the environment).<br/>
<br/>
Does the new program have books about that?<br/>
<br/>
Do they have ANY camping and outdoors stuff planned?  First aid?  Water <br/>
safety?  Any of the old standbys?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Only for the next couple of years during the pilot period. Then the<br/>
&gt; &gt; program materials that are less frequently utilized will be phased out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They&#39;ve already SAID that the cadette and senior program materials are<br/>
&gt; &gt; used by only a fraction of current members - so they are clearly<br/>
&gt; &gt; already sitting on the chopping block.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The focus books are well-intentioned - but look at what&#39;s out there -<br/>
&gt; &gt; the first focus books for girls 11 to 17 years old.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Take Charge - talks about date rape and self-defense<br/>
&gt; &gt; Uniquely Me - Inside and Out -- it is about style and self-esteem<br/>
&gt; &gt; Uniquely Me - The Real Deal -- it is about having a PMA (positive<br/>
&gt; &gt; mental attitude) to deal with peer pressure<br/>
&gt; &gt; Looking In, Reaching Out -- it is about journaling and thinking about<br/>
&gt; &gt; one&#39;s own feelings<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There are now a few other focus books - one on writing, one on track<br/>
&gt; &gt; and field, and one on traveling.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Contrast this to the Boy Scouts merit badges - on horseriding,<br/>
&gt; &gt; ceramics, camping, backpacking, carpentry, beekeeping, archery, drama,<br/>
&gt; &gt; engineering, and so on - dozens of them --- all REAL stuff to learn and<br/>
&gt; &gt; do and THEIR booklets have actual information in them to help the kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; learn.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The girl scout focus books take the place of earning any kind of merit<br/>
&gt; &gt; badges - the girls buy the booklets ($5 to $6 each) and read them and<br/>
&gt; &gt; do the activities (answer some questions, mostly) and then set their<br/>
&gt; &gt; own goals. When they&#39;ve achieved their own goals, they can buy<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves a little charm - for another $4 or $5.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; (I LIKE the setting their own goals aspect, by the way.)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But - I have absolutely NO interest in my 12 yo daughter being treated<br/>
&gt; &gt; to such obtrusive pop psychology by somebody who volunteers to be her<br/>
&gt; &gt; girl scout leader. We don&#39;t share the same religion nor values in many<br/>
&gt; &gt; areas and certainly not at ALL the same kind of approach to discussing<br/>
&gt; &gt; these kinds of things. And - much of the material is very very<br/>
&gt; &gt; anti-family. Even the most innocuous focus book - the one about writing<br/>
&gt; &gt; - there is a section about how to write a persuasive essay to convince<br/>
&gt; &gt; your parents to let you go to an all-night party. I found it very<br/>
&gt; &gt; offensive. The attitude that parents and kids are adversaries is<br/>
&gt; &gt; pervasive in the materials. It is assumed that all teenage girls will<br/>
&gt; &gt; have hostility toward their parents. There is a section in one of them<br/>
&gt; &gt; where it suggests that it IS possible that they could EVEN have fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; with their family. The message is clear - normal teenage girls don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; like their families.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; There&#39;s more - but I&#39;ll stop ranting for now &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was a girl scout for all of my childhood and have been involved as an<br/>
&gt; &gt; adult for 14 years. I&#39;ve won council-level awards honoring my work for<br/>
&gt; &gt; the organization. I&#39;m sickened by the direction the older girls&#39;<br/>
&gt; &gt; program is moving - I was hoping to see MORE real content, not this<br/>
&gt; &gt; pandering to the worst of society&#39;s view of teenage girls. I&#39;ve got<br/>
&gt; &gt; THREE teenage girls (well - two plus one almost there) and this program<br/>
&gt; &gt; is so unsuitable for them and their friends that, just reading about<br/>
&gt; &gt; it, they were very very insulted and offended.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have no idea if teenagers who go to school will now flock to it or<br/>
&gt; &gt; not - although I&#39;d be very surprised if they&#39;ll bother. I cannot<br/>
&gt; &gt; imagine it appealing to girls with real lives and real senses of<br/>
&gt; &gt; themselves. At best, it is fluff.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; -pam<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, I talked to Beth, my partner, who works for a GS council. What <br/>
&gt; she said<br/>
&gt; is that different councils are working on how to implement this, but <br/>
&gt; that the<br/>
&gt; intention is not to have regular GS go away. They did market research,<br/>
&gt; apparently, and found that among older girls that GS was not &quot;cool&quot;, <br/>
&gt; and that&#39;s why<br/>
&gt; they left the program.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Therefore, the new program was designed so that it will not even <br/>
&gt; mention that<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s a GS program. To me it also doesn&#39;t sound that thrilling. I dunno.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She&#39;s going to get me more info. I&#39;ll pass it along if anyone cares.<br/>

No - it is the assumption that girls are alienated from their families <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846700555">I&#39;m interested in what councils are being told.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting reading if you google around and look at different council <br/>
websites and what they say about it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m best-guessing that the old program will mostly go away (maybe <br/>
preserving silver and gold awards) - my guess is based on long long <br/>
experience with how girl scouts has introduced new materials and new <br/>
programs over the years.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, once this starts to be implemented there may be <br/>
backlash. Who knows where things will end up. There hasn&#39;t been any <br/>
training yet for adult advisors - no longer leaders and, by the way, it <br/>
is preferred that girls interact with younger women - ages 18 to 30 - <br/>
although they do say there will still be a place for older women in the <br/>
program. But - they aren&#39;t going to publicize the new program to the <br/>
public until October - not until after the councils get full <br/>
information and they introduce the new program to their leaders (I <br/>
mean, advisors) and to the girls currently in the program.<br/>
