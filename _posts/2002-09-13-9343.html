<div id="ygrps-yiv-643434794">I had a friend in elementary school who spent six weeks one year roller<br/>
skating.  I went to an alternative school so that was ok.  Her parents<br/>
were worried about her falling behind.  After six weeks of wheeling<br/>
around the black top, she came in and raced through a semester&#39;s worth<br/>
of math.  The teacher said that sometimes kids are working on something<br/>
deep inside.  They do a filler activity until everything gets worked<br/>
out.<br/>
Not eloquent but I think it is remotely clear.  (I haven&#39;t finished my<br/>
tea yet)<br/>
