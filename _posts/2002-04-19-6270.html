 </span></blockquote>I agree that it is important to write words in the way actually say them or<br/>
are said to us. Perhaps you should go back and read my original post<br/>

Hi Suzanna,<br/>
If I didn&#39;t welcome you to the list, WELCOME!!<br/>
Many times one person&#39;s post triggers a thought in another&#39;s mind and that<br/>
person writes about their thought. Many times it is not a direct personal<br/>
response. I think she may have been hearing something and repeating back<br/>
what she is hearing for further clarification. or simply posting about the<br/>
subject of power in relationships because something you said may have<br/>
reminded her of something she was already thinking of.<br/>
