<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098349596">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;It is from a book (she wrote somewhat snootily): <br/>
The Princess Bride.<br/>
It was made into a very nice, but necessarily less<br/>
glorious movie, and the line is delivered by Mandy<br/>
Patinkin, who does a great job of being <br/>
Inigo Montoya.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know it was from a book! I&#39;ll have to look<br/>
for it at the library. I&#39;d love to read it. Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
Meghan :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2029454220">Here&#39;s what they say about Princess Bride in Movies Not Recommended as<br/>
Teaching Tools (the asterisks are to indicate movies that have potential<br/>
teaching value, but they don&#39;t have lesson plans set up for them)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;**The Princess Bride    (1987) Rated PG; Director: Rob Reiner.     This is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>a delightful film that some parents tell us they watch with their children<br/>
over and over again. However, we have not been able to find a way to make it<br/>
educational. However, one teacher told us that: &quot;I think the Princess Bride<br/>
can be used with elementary students (and up) in Language Arts class as an<br/>
opportunity to dissect the elements of a fable.&quot; We haven&#39;t had time to<br/>
explore this. &lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
So they&#39;re not totally down on it at all. (I&#39;m ignoring the educational part<br/>
:p) Just to be fair, since I don&#39;t want to sic a bunch of pissed-off PB fans<br/>
on them. Hell hath no fury...<br/>
<br/>
OTOH, &quot;an opportunity to dissect the elements of a fable&quot;?? How awful. Like<br/>
the little boy who wonders why the frog he just dissected won&#39;t hop anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Karen<br/>
&quot;Life&#39;s not fair, Princess, and anyone who tells you differently is trying<br/>
to sell something.&quot;<br/>

&lt;&lt;  I especially liked the &quot;Movies We Don&#39;t<br/>
Recommend&quot; part, since there are several great ones there as well. How could<br/>
I support anyone who puts all three Mandy Patinkin movies they mention on<br/>
the not recommended list? :) After all, The Princess Bride is worth it for<br/>
the quotes alone. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They have disparaged The Princess Bride?  That can&#39;t be right!<br/>
<br/>
I missed the &quot;movies we don&#39;t recommend&quot; part--I wanted to see what cool<br/>
stuff they had to say about some I really love.<br/>
<br/>
Oh well!  &lt;g&gt;  I&#39;ll brace myself to go back in there and look.  Later today.<br/>
Maybe.<br/>

SO!  <br/>

<br/>
I suppose that poetry is only valuable if it &quot;teaches a lesson&quot; and the <br/>
&quot;lesson&quot; that in poetry, words can be fun, amusing, touching, sweet, musical, <br/>
rhythmic is nothing some people can find useful.<br/>
<br/>
bah and humbuggery upon them.<br/>
<br/>
Holly loves a little poem which is FUN to speak.  It&#39;s just mouth-amusement.  <br/>
It&#39;s in a book of kids&#39; poetry with Tomie DePaola illustrations, which is why <br/>
I bought it, used--but I found the text online:<br/>
<br/>
 had a Little Brother by Mary Ann Hoberman<br/>
rched choir.<br/>
