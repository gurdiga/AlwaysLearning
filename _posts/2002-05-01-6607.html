We know someone who makes negative comments about boys and men. Just sort of <br/>
general negative little side comments. We&#39;ve ignored it for years, but <br/>
somehow it seems worse and I&#39;ve started to talk to my daughters about what <br/>
they&#39;re hearing from her. I wasn&#39;t ever sure whether to talk to them about it <br/>
or not - it is mild stuff, something like, &quot;Well, what do you expect from <br/>
him, he&#39;s a &#39;boy&#39; after all&quot;  - but one day we were all together and she said <br/>
something directly TO my daughter - something derogatory about boys - and it <br/>
was really just too much to ignore. So I have felt forced to point it out to <br/>
my girls and now they&#39;re aware of it, too. <br/>
