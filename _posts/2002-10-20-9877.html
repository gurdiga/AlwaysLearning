Thanks so much for this link.  Even though I&#39;m a British person living<br/>
in America I didn&#39;t know that school wasn&#39;t compulsory in England.  I<br/>
always thought it was.  144,000 kids being homeschooled doesn&#39;t sound<br/>
like a lot but I guess it is when it&#39;s such a small country.<br/>
<br/>
Again thanks for the link... It keeps me connected to what&#39;s going on at<br/>
&quot;home&quot;<br/>

I home-educated in England before moving here and will carry on <br/>
home-educating when I get back to the UK. It&#39;s much easier there <br/>
than here in Virginia. Having said that I don&#39;t jump through any <br/>
hoops for Virginia, I merely neglected to inform them I had arrived in <br/>
the state therefore no-one bothers me for test scores and such <br/>
like. Hopefully we&#39;ll be gone before they notice :-)<br/>

&quot;You laugh at me because I&#39;m different. I laugh at you because you are all the same.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1570122067">You&#39;re welcome. It&#39;s nice to feel connections. I used to relish getting my<br/>
UK magazine monthly just to feel a little bit of home. <br/>

Been in US since age 22, now I&#39;m 43, so nearly half my life.  Still have<br/>
a very strong British accent though as I do go back and my mum and<br/>
brother are both here.<br/>
<br/>
Arizona&#39;s only requirement is to file and Affidavit of Intent to<br/>
Homeschool with the Superintendent of Schools and that&#39;s it.... No<br/>
testing, no harassing, no nothing... That I like.<br/>
