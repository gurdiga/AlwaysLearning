&lt;&lt; &gt;&gt;The story about her serving tongue when you came over for dinner pretty <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;much convinced me!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, do tell!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was just our family going to eat, and after a four hour drive she had <br/>
dinner just about on the table, and it was beef tongue.  She said &quot;I bet <br/>
Keith misses having tongue.&quot;  I didn&#39;t say &quot;I bet he does NOT.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said as neutrally and politely as I could that I wasn&#39;t going to eat any <br/>
and she said with a kind of laugh in her voice (which she has at the very <br/>
worst times) &quot;Yes you will.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
One time she had a little raisin dessert in a very small bowl, a little like <br/>
bread pudding, but mostly raisins.  Maybe oatmeal base.  And very small <br/>
helpings.  <br/>
<br/>
Marty, who was three or four, didn&#39;t like one of vegetables, or whatever.  <br/>
She told him if he didn&#39;t eat it he couldn&#39;t have dessert.  I looked at him <br/>
and saw his face (we never do dessert, but she was depriving him as a <br/>
punishment, he knew that much), and I said &quot;Marty, you can have mine!&quot;  all <br/>
happy.  Then Marty was happy.  I didn&#39;t even glance at the grandma, at my <br/>
left, who was probably not happy, but hey--I had earned MY dessert, and could <br/>
do with it as I wished with my OWN child, and the worst she could have done <br/>
would have been to tell us to go home.  That would have been better than <br/>
dessert.<br/>
