<div id="ygrps-yiv-438799469">~~The purpose of this list isn&#39;t to stumble as a group.  It&#39;s for people to <br/>
see where they want to be as to unschooling, and take direct small steps <br/>
toward that.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been on AlwaysLearning since 2000ish (with an immediate 2 ½ year <br/>
absence since the list scared the poop out of me in the beginning).  In the <br/>
7 ½ years that I have been a faithful lurker, I have only posted about 6 or <br/>
7 times.  I read, read and read.  I&#39;m continuing to grasp concepts, put them <br/>
in my pretty basket, and then I read some more in the eventuality that my <br/>
basket will one day overflow with the knowledge I seek.   In the beginning, <br/>
I &quot;stumbled&quot; onto this list but I am so grateful that the list writers keep <br/>
me walking &quot;step by step&quot; in the direction of being a better Mother.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dave and I now have a 12-year-old daughter.  She has different needs and <br/>
desires then a decade ago.  For the past 4 months or so, we have been in the <br/>
process of re-evaluating our past and current steps to being better parents. <br/>
It is a very deliberate and conscious act to make adjustments in our <br/>
parenting.  We feel that we&#39;ve been in the unschooling bubble so long that <br/>
we&#39;ve just kind of been floating (like spit) in the inside.  We&#39;ve been <br/>
adding to our delightful life, but we&#39;ve become complacent in things that we <br/>
thought we had down.  We &quot;got it&quot;, then I think we might have lost some of <br/>
it and there is definitely room to &quot;get more&quot; of it.  Our goal is to &quot;get&quot; <br/>
all of it!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to recent discussions on this list, we decided to continue to gently <br/>
pop our bubble and reexamine if we have become &quot;lazy unschoolers&quot;.  We&#39;ve <br/>
found that in some ways we have and in other ways we haven&#39;t.  The <br/>
interesting aspect is realizing how far we have come and where we might be <br/>
right now if we had not &quot;stumbled&quot; upon this list.  Having stepped out of <br/>
our little bubble we realize we had forgotten that the world is much bigger <br/>
than parkdays & activities with a few select families.  We had forgotten <br/>
that we chose this lifestyle because we wanted our lives filled with <br/>
everything and not just selected pieces because they were &quot;easy&quot; (or dare I <br/>
use the world lazy).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This past year, I had become reliant on get-togethers to fill our days.  I <br/>
found that it can become very &quot;easy&quot; to waist days away at social outlets <br/>
when what my daughter really needed was simply me.  It became &quot;easy&quot; to use <br/>
those outlets as a mask for not Being with my kiddo.  Those outlets take up <br/>
time so I didn&#39;t have to (yes I used Have To) Do anything.  I tricked myself <br/>
into thinking that I was providing necessary stimulation when in actuality <br/>
Sorscha needed less stimulation and my mindful, peaceful presence.  Yes, I&#39;m <br/>
embarrassed for my lack but I am absolutely empowered because I SEE my <br/>
laziness.  By being honest with myself, I am consciously back to the Mom I <br/>
LOVE being.  I LIKE that!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dave and I now focus on not just being present (whether that&#39;s 20 yards from <br/>
our kiddo at an activity) but Doing.   We&#39;re back to exploring new <br/>
adventures instead of sitting in weekly routines.   It&#39;s exciting and so <br/>
many new passions have opened.  We had forgotten that &quot;this&quot; was what we <br/>
started all of &quot;this&quot; for!  Talk about a serious parental reality check.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dave & I have been discussing the areas where we can improve and expand our <br/>
parenting.  We&#39;ve gone back to Radical Unschooling Boot Camp 101 and we are <br/>
rereading a mass of information.  We are really thinking about what we are <br/>
reading - We&#39;re not skimming through topics because we had already &quot;gotten <br/>
that one&quot;.   We are reading, discussing, high five-ing, and sometimes <br/>
wondering how we forgot &quot;that part&quot;.   It&#39;s a very COOL place to be as a <br/>
family and Sorscha (now going by Fang) will benefit from our reexaminations <br/>
as radical unschooling parents.  We look forward to the next decade on <br/>
AlwaysLearning - which is an interesting thought because my kiddo will be 22 <br/>
and Sandra&#39;s kiddos will be in their 30&#39;s (well, Holly will be 28).  Now <br/>
THAT makes me want to make sure I&#39;m &quot;getting it&quot; now!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so I post hardly anything for a decade and now ya&#39;ll get a mass of <br/>
paragraphs.  Be gentle with my grammatical errors.  I&#39;m not a writer but a <br/>
Radical Unschooling Mama with something to write.  I know to the outside, <br/>
traditional parenting world that we are attentive, amazing, opportunity <br/>
inspiring, imaginative parents, but to us, well, we want more because there <br/>
IS way more.  Unfortunately though, there is little time.<br/>

Holly says some families live in &quot;unschooling world&quot; instead of the  <br/>
real world.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some people care more about whether their other unschooling  <br/>
friends are impressed by this or that than they care about what their  <br/>
kids like.<br/>
<br/>
Glad to have your unafraid presence, Crystal.<br/>

 <br/>
~~~Uh... up to the spit part I was right with ya. &lt;g&gt;~~~<br/>
<br/>
Let me clarify the spit part  I&#39;m thinking bubble gum here.  When I blow a bubble and seal it with my mouth, a little bit of spit gets caught inside.  If I continue to blow amazing bubbles and build on my original piece of gum, then each bubble is alive, beautiful and unique.  That is what I consider unschooling days to be.<br/>
<br/>
If I envision that bubble just sitting there with no further anything from me (cause you know, I know how to blow a bubble so why should I do anything more - being snarky with myself here), then the spit and air are just trapped on the inside. Since the bubble has been sealed with slowly dying air and originally good bacteria, then I imagine the spit would mold or become rancid somehow.  This is not what I consider great unschooling days.  <br/>
<br/>
The spit concept in my head is based on the lack of life or moldy life that can consume the bubble. The spit was originally alive!<br/>
<br/>
Or we could just say, &quot;Crystal in a plastic unschooling bubble without an air source.&quot; I&#39;m envisioning myself in the bedroom from the movie The Boy in the Plastic Bubble with John Travolta.  He was afraid to leave the safety of the bubble but he had an intense desire to live in the real world and be free.<br/>
<br/>
~~~Glad to have your unafraid presence~~~<br/>
<br/>
Neo, I&#39;m not afraid anymore. <br/>

I love it when these ideas get cycled through the list!  I have a 15 yr old, so a lot of what I see and do, has a feel of &quot;been there, done that&quot;.  The thing is, I also have an 8 yr old who has not been there done that!  I love that these ideas get back out there and in my thoughts...<br/>
<br/>
It could just be coincidence but it seems this feeling coincides with springtime a lot!  Newness and re-emergence. <br/>
