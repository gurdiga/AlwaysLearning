<div id="ygrps-yiv-29308607">My husband and I have 4 kids, 6,5,4,and 3.  My 6 year old went to <br/>
preschool for half a year back when he was 3 because several of his <br/>
friends went and he thought it would be fun.  He did like it well <br/>
enough, but I got a little annoyed when he came home saying he had <br/>
gotten in trouble for coloring a bear blue when it clearing showed <br/>
it should be brown. Otherwise they havnt been to school. <br/>
For the most part we have been unschooling but periodically I get <br/>
caught up in our homeschool groups talk and although I have resisted <br/>
ever buying a curriculum I have tried to teach the kids a few <br/>
things... But then I notice my 5 year old (B) is reading (when i <br/>
havnt taught him) or my 6 year old (J) can count money when he <br/>
doesnt know the names of the coins and I realize I need to back off <br/>
and I do for a while till I once again loose focus.  People say <br/>
things to me, like, how is J (6) going to feel when he is the only <br/>
kid in Sunday school that cant read, but they turn around and tell <br/>
me how incitefull he is and how he makes such interesting comments.  <br/>
So I guess my question is how do I stay focused on Unschooling and <br/>
quit getting off track?<br/>
My next question has to do with my 5 year old, B.  B feels very <br/>
strongly and has alot of trouble with transitions, change, newness.  <br/>
He needs alot of time to himself to work up to things.  For example, <br/>
B didnt think he could swim and he wanted no help.  I left him alone <br/>
with it and all summer when we would go to the pool and rather than <br/>
play with the other kids he would go off by himself and repeatedly <br/>
jump in the shallow end and basically just worked himself into <br/>
swimming.  Last week he jumped off the diving board for the first <br/>
time.  Proud and anything.  He didnt want my help but would <br/>
sometimes ask me to watch him or occasionally get in with him.  He <br/>
is very nervous about new things and very fearful of failure or <br/>
loosing.  <br/>
Often when he has trouble with transitions for example I make things <br/>
worse by getting impatient.  How do I teach him to control his <br/>
emotions?  Any good book suggestions?<br/>
Thanks</div>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That question has a couple of problems.  First, unschoolers don&#39;t address<br/>
teaching anything but instead we talk about children learning.  Second,<br/>
emotions are not things you control, however the parent can model how to<br/>
deal with emotions in a variety of ways, and how to express a wider range of<br/>
feelings (that&#39;s the goal anyway) so that we&#39;re not limited to just<br/>
happiness and sadness, hurt, or anger.  There&#39;s way more choice available to<br/>
us than only noticing our strongest emotions (usually when they get out of<br/>
hand).<br/>
<br/>
Any good book suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I keep recommending Naomi Aldort&#39;s Raising Our Children Raising Ourselves<br/>
because it has helped me so much.  It immediately helped me with ideas about<br/>
dealing with strong emotion.<br/>
<br/>
Another great idea that has helped me in parenting Karl probably more than<br/>
any other thing I&#39;ve read deals with making choices (decision-making being<br/>
the least developed skill for me from childhood to adulthood).  It&#39;s really<br/>
just four sentences in the middle of an article by Sandra Dodd on her<br/>
website and I personally think it deserves a page all to itself:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  *Choices:*  Unless you considered two or three courses of actions, you<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t really make a choice at all. Consciously think of two choices before<br/>
&gt; you act�then make the better choice. Your range of choices will get better<br/>
&gt; as you do this. While you&#39;re helping your child learn to choose, you can<br/>
&gt; also learn to choose.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> I like a lot of what you&#39;ve written about your family, Verna.  One more<br/>
thing... but important, I think ... others besides me have better advice<br/>
about what to say about not being able to read in Sunday School because we<br/>
don&#39;t go to church.  One of the reasons I avoid church is for this very<br/>
reason... I don&#39;t like the assumptions and not just about my child&#39;s<br/>
reading.  But others *do* go and might have some words to wise.  Actually<br/>
some people who also don&#39;t go to church might have something for you there<br/>
too.<br/>

 <br/>
You  cannot &quot;teach&quot; him to control emotions. They should be able to feel and express emotions.<br/>
You can help him find ways to express them in a way more &quot;positive &quot; way.<br/>
Or ways that he can calm himself faster if he is frustrated . But he will only be able to do it when he is ready and capable to <br/>
do so. He is only 5. He has lots of years to ahead of him and everyday kids change a lot.<br/>
They grow and get experienced, they are better able to express their emotions in words or calm faster when frustrated.<br/>
Modeling how you are able to calm yourself down can help a lot.<br/>
But keep in mind that if you , the adult, can&#39;t control yourself and you get impatient at this wonderful child you love, how do you<br/>
expect him to control his emotions when he has only been in this world for 5 years and there is so much he still not ready to handle and conquer?<br/>

Thank you, that really helped me see more clearly that I am reacting <br/>
and expecting myself to be able to teach him something when I really <br/>
just need to be there for him and reassure him that I understand and <br/>
help him learn to deal with the emotions he is feeling.  This is yet <br/>
another area where I have so much trouble filtering out the messages <br/>
from others that bombard me.  People who persist in thinking there <br/>
is something wrong with my son when he is a wonderfully unique, <br/>
passionate, and persistent boy.  It also makes me sigh in relief <br/>
cause honestly i cant figure out how to teach him those things but I <br/>
know I can be there for him and support him.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
If I were in your position, I would ask them NOT to ask him to read.   <br/>
If they insisted, I wouldn&#39;t send him to Sunday school.<br/>
<br/>
You can read Bible stories to him yourself without him feeling  <br/>
pressured or &quot;behind.&quot;  If he wants to go when he can read, let him.  <br/>
I loved Sunday School, and I loved reading aloud there, and I loved  <br/>
racing to find Bible verses and I usually won, so bully for me; I  <br/>
grew up to be a big agnostic former Baptist.  Meanwhile, other kids  <br/>
were probably bored and stressed and frustrated because Sunday school  <br/>
was so heavy on the SCHOOL.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I guess my question is how do I stay focused on Unschooling and  <br/>

<br/>
#1, Decide it&#39;s what you want to do.   Then when you make choices and  <br/>
decisions, make the more unschooling choice.<br/>
<br/>
#2, stay on this list or another one you like where unschoolers can  <br/>
help you remember how to get to the place you want to be.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These might help:<br/>

Thank you for the kind words!  I can tell you the story of where that  <br/>
tool came from, the &quot;make the better choice.&quot;  I&#39;ve told it before,  <br/>
but there are always some new people.<br/>
<br/>
About 20 years ago (a little more), at Grand Outlandish, a big SCA  <br/>
campout here on Memorial Day weekend, a friend of ours was going to  <br/>
be knighted, so he was &quot;on vigil&quot;--our version of a medieval knight&#39;s  <br/>
vigil in a church, but ours is usually (and was that night) the  <br/>
knighthood candidate sitting formally in a tent (or a room, but we  <br/>
were camping) as people come by singly or in small groups to advise  <br/>
him or to speak with him as they wish.  Some bring gifts.  I brought  <br/>
a candle that night.    He was in a tent I had made myself, that  <br/>
night, and his name was Leif.<br/>
<br/>
He said he was worried that his camping equipment wasn&#39;t good enough,  <br/>
and that as a knight he should set a better example.  At that point,  <br/>
Keith and I had been improving our own camp for eight years or so,  <br/>
and he used that as an example, and another one of someone who had  <br/>
been doing it for a while.  He asked how he could have a camp like  <br/>
that, and he seemed to feel it needed to be immediately, or he might  <br/>
as well not start.<br/>
<br/>
That feeling of being overwhelmed about how to start caused me to  <br/>
advise him thusly:<br/>
<br/>
As you replace items, make the more medieval choice and incrementally  <br/>
your camp will get better.  If you&#39;re getting a tent and your choices  <br/>
are nylon or canvas, choose canvas.  If your choice is orange or  <br/>
brown, choose brown.  Make the better choice.<br/>
<br/>
I went back to my own camp all energized and excited, even though it  <br/>
was after midnight, and told Gunwaldt and Artan (Keith my husband and  <br/>
Jeff my friend and camping buddy) about it, and we all were happy  <br/>
with the breakthrough in the way we could advise people on all KINDS  <br/>
of things with that.  Kirby was a baby then.  It helped me be a  <br/>
better mom.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to barrel toward your goal without looking around.   <br/>
You can get there naturally if when there&#39;s an option you make the  <br/>
one that takes you nearer to the place or the way you want to be.   <br/>
And as time went by and I tried that advice out in different contexts  <br/>
and with different people, I added the idea that before you can make  <br/>
a choice, you have to have at least two options.   Some people talk  <br/>
the talk like they&#39;re making choices, but they&#39;re not stopping to  <br/>
think of options, really.<br/>
<br/>
In the first Terminator movie (NOT a favorite of mine), the little  <br/>
pull-down menu of options he has to consider reminds me of this  <br/>
idea.  And you can learn and add more good options to your menu, and  <br/>
eliminate those you don&#39;t need or use anymore because you have better  <br/>
ones.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-388130388">Hi<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to the forum - will post a proper introduction in a minute, <br/>
but your last paragraph really stuck out to me because my DD1 is the <br/>
same and I am also very impatient with her.  However, I feel that it <br/>
is less a case of &#39;teaching her to control her emotions&#39; and more a <br/>
case of &#39;teaching myself not to get impatient with her emotions&#39; - <br/>
her emotions are real and valid and important to her, and I have a <br/>
tendency when I&#39;m feeling impatient to wave them away and dismiss <br/>
them with a &#39;Oh don&#39;t be silly&#39; - not exactly respectful!  I ask <br/>
myself how I would like it if I expressed my fears to the person I <br/>
trusted most in the world and they dismissed my feelings or tried to <br/>
get me to stop feeling them?  I believe that my DD1 will grow up, and <br/>
will learn how to cope with her feelings in time, but I&#39;m trying to <br/>
stop myself interfering with the process and inadvertantly teaching <br/>
her simply to suppress her feelings - something I really don&#39;t want <br/>
to do!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes<br/>

Katherine,<br/>
Thanks for your comments about B and emotions.  That helped along with <br/>
the other post to show me I need to change totally how I respond to <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Church is wierd thing for us.  I use it simply as an example of when <br/>
we do community things that are not simply for homeschoolers.  We have <br/>
very few unschoolers around here.  Our kids love to go to church.  <br/>
They honestly and actually wake us up on Sunday mornings, dressed and <br/>
ready to go.  My husband typically stays home and takes whoever doesnt <br/>
go out to breakfast (a favorite thing in our house) and mostly they <br/>
all choose to go to church instead.  Go figure.  They like getting <br/>
dressed up too.  This summer we have been out of town alot and they <br/>
kept asking when we could go back to church?  So I take them.</div>

longer time to transition between things than his sisters needed.  <br/>
Perhaps your son has some similar traits.<br/>
<br/>
Jeffrey needs to feel a sense of completion when leaving an <br/>
activity.  He would get very upset if he was hurried to drop one <br/>
thing to go do something else.  Now that I look back on those earlier <br/>
years, I see the true trouble was in my thinking, not in his.  <br/>
Jeffrey is still the same way about transitions, but because we all <br/>
know how Jeffrey feels, our family has learned how to accommodate his <br/>
needs.  An example:  Jeffrey loves playing video games.  If he&#39;s <br/>
playing a game and we&#39;re wanting to leave the house, I let him know <br/>
in advance that we&#39;ll be leaving soon.  I ask him to let me know when <br/>
he&#39;s reached a stopping point so the rest of us can be ready to go.  <br/>
I don&#39;t tell him to find a stopping point though.  He would feel <br/>
pressured and sink into a negative mood.  If I&#39;m in a true hurry, and <br/>
I try my best to never be in a rush, I don&#39;t take my frustration out <br/>
on the kids because the fault is mine.  If I don&#39;t manage time well, <br/>
I have to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
Jeffrey is and has always been fearful of new things.  However, his <br/>
courage is growing as he gets older.  I&#39;ve been told numerous times <br/>
that I&#39;m harming him because I don&#39;t force him to jump into new <br/>
things.  I disagree and then change the subject.  I really don&#39;t care <br/>
to argue that point when I&#39;ve watched my son grow into a more <br/>
courageous, trusting person.  We talk about everything in detail.  He <br/>
likes to hear an explanation of what to expect and how things might <br/>
deviate from that expectation.  And most importantly, he likes to <br/>
know exactly who is going to be with him.  He prefers me or his dad <br/>
when he goes to a new place.  We&#39;re his safety net.  I don&#39;t worry <br/>
about his adult future.  I don&#39;t like to hear people say that if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t do it now, he&#39;ll never learn to do it.  I don&#39;t believe that <br/>
at all.  I trust that he&#39;ll do things when he&#39;s ready to do them.  <br/>
I&#39;m his shield for the negativity we encounter.  It&#39;s rough sometimes <br/>
because I don&#39;t care for negative comments but I&#39;d rather them be <br/>
directed at me than at my son.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Each of my kids has a streak of shyness, and they don&#39;t match.  Each  <br/>
as certain kinds of new things they don&#39;t want to do alone.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was probably the worst, in some ways.  He sat by me longest  <br/>
when he was little.  I sat by him longest when he was older.  When he  <br/>
had just turned 21 and had an offer to move to Texas for a job,  <br/>
though, he went merrily as to an adventure.  Now that he&#39;s there,  <br/>
he&#39;s staying home a lot and not exploring, which his dad wishes he  <br/>
would do more of.  He&#39;s not learning the city as quickly as Keith  <br/>
would LOVE to do if it were Keith, but it&#39;s Kirby.  He&#39;ll learn his  <br/>
surroundings more slowly.<br/>
<br/>
In his apartment, though, he knows LOTS about the way things work,  <br/>
how the air conditioner can malfunction if they leave it on too long  <br/>
and what the effect on the wall is and how to get it back to  <br/>
operational. &lt;g&gt;  He knows all the policies about the apartment  <br/>
complex and how to report things broken and what the odds are to get  <br/>
them fixed and how to improve that.  He&#39;s WAY informed in and at  <br/>
work.  He keeps up with his friends (not as well as Holly would, but  <br/>
still does) by phone and computer.  He&#39;s had a lot of New Mexico  <br/>
visitors there.  His apartment has become kind of a destination spot.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not an explorer.<br/>

This is so much like my son Alec (15).  When he&#39;s into something and there with something, he knows a lot about it.  So thoroughly he learns, researches and does things.<br/>
<br/>
And, he is not an explorer either.  It is sometimes hard for me to understand, when I love to explore.   New and different things excite me so much!  But, through unschooling I&#39;ve accepted that it&#39;s OK for everyone not to be the same.  And isn&#39;t is wonderful to have the differences?!<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling has given us such a gift, a gift for each of us to be ourselves; and it has allowed us to be ourselves the best that we can be.<br/>

<br/>
He doesn&#39;t have to be brave and outgoing to become involved in  <br/>
something inspiring.  There&#39;s the internet.  He can explore in there.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some portals leading to dozens and then hundreds more, or he  <br/>
could just stay and play on any of these pages.  And some of them  <br/>
lead to youtube, which can occupy someone for about a year.<br/>

we try to go to hobby shops, bookstores, and any other place he shows an interst in, and he has discovered youtube to be sure, along with looking stuff up online, playing WOW, and lots of other stuff.  but he is restless and bored and won&#39;t read much online and won&#39;t read or listen to anything read / shared with him, unless it is presented in just the right way at just the right moment, and grabs him immediately.  <br/>

little stories that I want to share but generally don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;ll share an impatient story from the other day.  We were at<br/>
the ice skating rink, in the bathroom.  They have those hand driers that<br/>
are very very strong and loud and dry your hands in like 5 seconds.  I<br/>
was waiting for one of my kids to be done and was just hanging out in<br/>
there.  There was another mom in there with her daughter, who was about<br/>
6.  She was doing that shaming nasty stuff to her daughter, trying to<br/>
get her to hurry.  So, because I&#39;m bored, stuck in a bathroom, and I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to hear her, every time she started to lay into her<br/>
daughter, I triggered the drier.  It completely drowns out all sound in<br/>
the room, the little girl can&#39;t hear her mother harping at her.<br/>
<br/>
I did it repeatedly until it was time to leave the bathroom.  Did it<br/>
help?  Who knows?  I didn&#39;t have to hear it though, the very loud ear<br/>
piercing drier was more pleasant than hearing a mom shame her child in<br/>
public.<br/>
<br/>
When I get frustrated, I take a deep breath and think about how I&#39;d feel<br/>
if I heard myself in public.  That generally helps me change directions<br/>
very quickly!</div>

<br/>
My older daughter is this way, although she&#39;s outgrown some of it.  One<br/>
thing that really helped, was online role playing games.  You are<br/>
inherently a part of something big, playing a role that you can be quite<br/>
successful at.  It helped in lots of ways, not just that feeling of<br/>
being part of something big.<br/>
<br/>
It has to do with not wanting to fail at anything.  A lot of times she<br/>
would refuse to try something unless she knew without a doubt she would<br/>
succeed.  So, I tried to bring things to her that she could succeed at. <br/>
She got involved in girl scouts, which was another bigger than her thing<br/>
where everyone wins.  That helped a lot too, and when she was done with<br/>
it, she stopped going.  It gave her a lot of little jumping off places<br/>
to explore.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s pretty good at lots of really creative things and has only<br/>
recently embraced that part of herself.  She is beginning to find things<br/>
that she&#39;s good at and knows that she is.  It took a while, but it<br/>
happens eventually.  In that inbetween time, I really focused on fun and<br/>
finding fun and doing things that were fun.  I took every little hint of<br/>
interest seriously and helped her explore it as much as she wanted to.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-269119789">-=-i really need to do that. but i am having trouble thinking of the  <br/>
&quot;right&quot; place or particuar thing that woudl really be fun for him. he  <br/>
tends to be very negative and get disappointed easily if experiences  <br/>
don&#39;t live up to his hopes and expectations. thanks though, i will  <br/>
definitely mull that one over further.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe don&#39;t play it up then.  Say you just want to go and hang out  <br/>
with him.  Then if you find a cool museum or park or IMAX theater or  <br/>
concert or whatever it is he might like, there it is.  It will be a  <br/>
surprise instead of an anticipated thing.<br/>

about his adult future. I don&#39;t like to hear people say that if he <br/>

at all. I trust that he&#39;ll do things when he&#39;s ready to do them. <br/>
I&#39;m his shield for the negativity we encounter. It&#39;s rough sometimes <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Beth M.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have this going on with my 9 year old son and I am really struggling. Thank you so much for posting this. I am also thinking very much about Sandra&#39;s post on choices. I love that SCA story and way of thinking about making gradual changes. <br/>
<br/>
My youngest son has a genetic neurological dysregulation that fits all the criteria for bipolar disorder (but I hate that term and the labeling) and anxiety. I think the anxiety comes from having his brain swing out of his control but he is also a very sensitive person. I have helped him to regulate from the beginning when he couldn&#39;t regulate blood sugar or temperature. I could do that for him with kangaroo care or attachment parenting. But he still has lots of trouble with regulation. We tried the medication route and lithium helps him, but not enough. All of the other medications are dreadful and cause more problems than they fix. We use Ross Greene&#39;s Collaborative Problem Solving (from his book, The Explosive Child). In trying to decrease his frustration level, we got into unschooling and then radical unschooling. I love the book &quot;Raising our Children, Raising ourselves&quot; by Naomi Aldort and try to follow that philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
He had been having episodes where he would lose control and have a meltdown and need us to restrain him so that he wouldn&#39;t hurt himself or others. We went into Seattle Children&#39;s hospital for a couple of days to see what they could offer to help. His brother, father or I (mainly me) were with him the whole time and I shared his little hospital bed with him. They had some good tools that they used to help him to reset and we were supposed to get outpatient help with a therapist. The outpatient therapist was more dysfunctional than my son and all the good ones are booked solid.  <br/>
<br/>
So now comes my dilemma: There are some psychotherapies that have been shown to be effective and we have been trying to access one of those. I have been thinking in terms of choice of therapist and finding the right therapist but I am wondering if there are other choices besides that. As an analogy, am I thinking of trying to find the right math curriculum, instead of letting him find his own math? It was easy for us to move to unschooling with academics. We have always respected our kids autonomy and tried to do unconditional parenting so it was a natural step to move into radical unschooling, except for dealing with his disorder. There, I am stuck with still trying to use mainstream treatments. (We have tried every kind of alternative medicine and dietary intervention that are available.) Should I keep trying to find a psychologist or therapist who is a good fit or are there other options?<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas suggestions or a way to help me make gradual changes or adjust my thinking? Has anyone else had to deal with bipolar disorder? (Feel free to email offlist if you have a personal story to share.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

Most of what I&#39;ve read about dietary intervention has seemed  <br/>
nonsense.  More deprivation and magical thinking doesn&#39;t help when  <br/>
kids need someone to say yes and okay and &quot;are you comfortable?&quot;<br/>

It depends how bad it is, of course, but there&#39;s a site on depression  <br/>
I found just recently and stuck here (on an unfinished page):<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/mentalhealth">http://sandradodd.com/mentalhealth</a><br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I save things until there&#39;s enough a page to launch, but  <br/>
feel free to visit my construction site today! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Instead of thinking &quot;bi-polar,&quot; too, if you think &quot;manic- <br/>
depressive&quot; (it&#39;s traditional name) it seems much less extreme.  I  <br/>
know there&#39;s a full range of... ranges on it no matter what you call  <br/>
it, but the manic &quot;episodes&quot; or states are often made worse by  <br/>
people&#39;s responses, and the depression can be WAY worse in bad  <br/>
surroundings than good (as with any and everything in the whole wide  <br/>
world).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-765468172">I don&#39;t know why, but everytime I read stuff you write, I remember funny<br/>
little stories that I want to share but generally don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I&#39;ll share an impatient story from the other day. We were at<br/>
the ice skating rink, in the bathroom. They have those hand driers that<br/>
are very very strong and loud and dry your hands in like 5 seconds. I<br/>
was waiting for one of my kids to be done and was just hanging out in<br/>
there. There was another mom in there with her daughter, who was about<br/>
6. She was doing that shaming nasty stuff to her daughter, trying to<br/>
get her to hurry. So, because I&#39;m bored, stuck in a bathroom, and I<br/>
didn&#39;t want to hear her, every time she started to lay into her<br/>
daughter, I triggered the drier. It completely drowns out all sound in<br/>
the room, the little girl can&#39;t hear her mother harping at her.<br/>
<br/>
I did it repeatedly until it was time to leave the bathroom. Did it<br/>
help? Who knows? I didn&#39;t have to hear it though, the very loud ear<br/>
piercing drier was more pleasant than hearing a mom shame her child in<br/>
public.<br/>
<br/>
When I get frustrated, I take a deep breath and think about how I&#39;d feel<br/>
if I heard myself in public. That generally helps me change directions<br/>
very quickly!<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
Hey Glad I inpired you to share the story this time.<br/>
I think I may use it next time I am impatient with my kids at a public bathroom&lt;BWG&gt;<br/>
snd start rushing them to get done and out ( it does not happen offen but I have my days!)<br/>

&gt;   -=-Well I have been using it for a while now and I still have a lot to<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; learn about it. It&#39;s a simple idea yet not easy for me. You didn&#39;t like<br/>
&gt; that eeny-teeny spello, which I never noticed next to the big wonderful<br/>
&gt; idea. Thanks, lady.-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you for the kind words! I can tell you the story of where that<br/>
&gt; tool came from, the &quot;make the better choice.&quot; I&#39;ve told it before,<br/>
&gt; but there are always some new people.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; About 20 years ago (a little more), at Grand Outlandish, a big SCA<br/>
&gt; campout here on Memorial Day weekend, a friend of ours was going to<br/>
&gt; be knighted, so he was &quot;on vigil&quot;--our version of a medieval knight&#39;s<br/>
&gt; vigil in a church, but ours is usually (and was that night) the<br/>
&gt; knighthood candidate sitting formally in a tent (or a room, but we<br/>
&gt; were camping) as people come by singly or in small groups to advise<br/>
&gt; him or to speak with him as they wish. Some bring gifts. I brought<br/>
&gt; a candle that night. He was in a tent I had made myself, that<br/>
&gt; night, and his name was Leif.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; He said he was worried that his camping equipment wasn&#39;t good enough,<br/>
&gt; and that as a knight he should set a better example. At that point,<br/>
&gt; Keith and I had been improving our own camp for eight years or so,<br/>
&gt; and he used that as an example, and another one of someone who had<br/>
&gt; been doing it for a while. He asked how he could have a camp like<br/>
&gt; that, and he seemed to feel it needed to be immediately, or he might<br/>
&gt; as well not start.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; That feeling of being overwhelmed about how to start caused me to<br/>
&gt; advise him thusly:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; As you replace items, make the more medieval choice and incrementally<br/>
&gt; your camp will get better. If you&#39;re getting a tent and your choices<br/>
&gt; are nylon or canvas, choose canvas. If your choice is orange or<br/>
&gt; brown, choose brown. Make the better choice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I went back to my own camp all energized and excited, even though it<br/>
&gt; was after midnight, and told Gunwaldt and Artan (Keith my husband and<br/>
&gt; Jeff my friend and camping buddy) about it, and we all were happy<br/>
&gt; with the breakthrough in the way we could advise people on all KINDS<br/>
&gt; of things with that. Kirby was a baby then. It helped me be a<br/>
&gt; better mom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You don&#39;t have to barrel toward your goal without looking around.<br/>
&gt; You can get there naturally if when there&#39;s an option you make the<br/>
&gt; one that takes you nearer to the place or the way you want to be.<br/>
&gt; And as time went by and I tried that advice out in different contexts<br/>
&gt; and with different people, I added the idea that before you can make<br/>
&gt; a choice, you have to have at least two options. Some people talk<br/>
&gt; the talk like they&#39;re making choices, but they&#39;re not stopping to<br/>
&gt; think of options, really.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the first Terminator movie (NOT a favorite of mine), the little<br/>
&gt; pull-down menu of options he has to consider reminds me of this<br/>
&gt; idea. And you can learn and add more good options to your menu, and<br/>
&gt; eliminate those you don&#39;t need or use anymore because you have better<br/>
&gt; ones.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-55471429">I just wanted to thank you all for the suggestions, comments etc..  <br/>
Honestly, today was great and I think it was because I really was <br/>
feeling quite relieved.  For the past few weeks I have been thinking of <br/>
all these things I should be doing... making chore lists and trying to <br/>
entice my oldest son into learning to read.  I have been reading <br/>
online &quot;typical day of homeschoolers&quot; and honestly found it all so very <br/>
depressing.  I cant interupt a kid that is playing with action figures <br/>
and cooperating with his brothers and sister and tell him it time to <br/>
learn something...  Finding the unschooling sites and lists helped so <br/>
much.  My little B had a couple breakdowns but I stayed cool, talked to <br/>
him about how he felt,  discussed a little about more effective ways to <br/>
deal with his frustrations and he calmed down so much faster.  <br/>
I spent alot of time today thinking about my descisions instead of just <br/>
doing stuff the regular old way.  It has been kind of exciting to think <br/>
about things I hadnt thought about before.  the kids liked it too.<br/>
Thanks</div>
