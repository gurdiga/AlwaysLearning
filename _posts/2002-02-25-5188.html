She probably had no hope of enough to make her happy, just maybe enough to <br/>
allow her to sleep six hours at a stretch, not to have diarrhea every time <br/>
she thought about her husband, or not to wish a bus would just hit her hard <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah.  I lived in &quot;crisis mode&quot; for seven years in an abusive marriage and <br/>
one has to wonder what all that adrenaline and other &quot;fight or flight&quot; <br/>
chemicals coursing through one&#39;s brain not just for a short time but <br/>
routinely, off and on but mostly on, for years does to one&#39;s brain chemistry. <br/>
 Temporarily or long-term, it has to have an effect.  Six years after leaving <br/>
the abuse, I spiraled down into a debilitating depression as a &quot;post <br/>
traumatic&quot; response to the abuse I had endured years before.  I was open to <br/>
using meds because the other option involved ramming my car into a tree.  <br/>
Actually, I ended up using talk therapy, vitamins, exercise, and a lot of <br/>
prayer and crying -- which worked, but had it not, meds would have been <br/>
welcome.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad the strides have been made in recent years in brain function <br/>
studies.  There is so much yet to be learned, but it has been amazing.  <br/>
People are getting their lives back.  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I do agree that there is no &quot;magic pill&quot; that will take care of <br/>
everything inside.  The medication usually means the difference between <br/>
functioning and not functioning not happiness and unhappiness, although <br/>
functioning helps one&#39;s happiness quotient immeasurably.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I still have to wonder how much of this can be prevented.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that certain chemical make ups or personality types are <br/>
more prone to depression just like some people are more prone to <br/>
becoming alcoholics.  *But* I think our childhood experiences play a <br/>
large role in greatly influencing all aspects of our lives.  Not all <br/>
people prone to being alcoholics become alcoholics.  Not all people <br/>
prone to depression need to take medication.<br/>
<br/>
I really wish there would be a study done of the children whose <br/>
families followed an unschooling lifestyle and see if they grow up <br/>
with a lower than the normal population need for medication.<br/>
<br/>
My brother was severely depressed for years.  He was really not <br/>
functioning well even on Prozac.  Ever since he overcame the total <br/>
lack of self-esteem he was left with by my father he has been doing <br/>
wonderfully.  He finally found a job he was good at.  It took him <br/>
until he was 40 to be able to say to himself &quot;I am a grown man&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that old nature vs. nurture argument.  I think most people understand <br/>
we&#39;re all complex mixtures of both.  Sometimes medication gives a depressed <br/>
or anxiety-ridden person the peace and respite he/she needs in order to <br/>
attend to emotional and mental and self-worth issues.  Using medication for a <br/>
times doesn&#39;t mean having to stay on it.  But with others there really aren&#39;t <br/>
any *issues* that need to be dealt with, or they&#39;ve already been dealt with, <br/>
and the problem truly is more of a chemical nature and for those folks <br/>
medication is the answer -- much like someone with hypothyroidism would need <br/>
to take a pill for the rest of his/her life.  It&#39;s a biological condition <br/>
that we can now treat effectively -- which is just so great.  But because of <br/>
this mishmash of nature and nurture, we just have to take each struggling <br/>
person on an individual basis because until we get to digging into it all, we <br/>
just don&#39;t know.<br/>

their full physical growth until about 40. Perhaps<br/>
maturity comes with shoulders, for some.<br/>

In traditional Cherokee culture a Person is not<br/>

they become eligible four council membership and may<br/>
voice a valid opinion backed by life-experience.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; just don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We do know that prolonged stress of any sort uses up<br/>
seratonin. We do know that stress, prolonged or short<br/>
term stimulates anxiety responses. We do know that<br/>
this creates acclerated wear and tear on the indocrin<br/>
and nervous, and circulatory, and digestive, and skin,<br/>
and spirit,and, well, one&#39;s entire self.  We do know<br/>
that prolonged physical and emotional pain uses up<br/>
seratonin, too. And that pain is the result of<br/>
accelerated wear and tear and the result of the world<br/>
not being the way we want it.  Too much of this pain<br/>
and stress and too much seartonin get used up.  Then<br/>
there isn&#39;t enough of this chemical in our brains to<br/>
get us through the daily business of living.  So a<br/>
seratinin reuptake inhibitor is sometimes tried, to<br/>
help out.  It is usually started at low doses.  It<br/>
also takes a while for the sesartonin to build back up<br/>
in one&#39;s system. Weeks, with meds. Sometimes never,<br/>
without meds. Sometimes the continued stresses are too<br/>
much, and more med. is needed (usually). <br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t help everyone, and some folks have<br/>
reactions to it. (That is why it is started with such<br/>
low doses). Some people do OK with other<br/>
antidepressants. Some don&#39;t. Thank the Powers that Be<br/>
that there is help for some.<br/>
<br/>
Depression (seratonin deficiancy)is a serious problem<br/>
causing other serious problems and even death, not<br/>
always only of the depressed person. It should always<br/>
be taken seriously. No matter what the causes. If<br/>
Prozac helps or other medsgo for it! St John&#39;s wart<br/>
may be enough for some, chocolate, enough for others. <br/>
A good joke, prayers and hugs may tide some<br/>
over....but not everyone. Whatever helps should be<br/>
done. Now.<br/>

<br/>
I think people get older the way you drive a standard.  <br/>
<br/>
You take your foot of the brake gradually as you push the gas pedal.  And <br/>
even when you&#39;re accelerating, you know you can&#39;t go forward at that rate <br/>
forever.  And sometimes you change gears.  And sometimes you start back at a <br/>
standstill.  And some people have no fourth or fifth gear, no matter how long <br/>
they live.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe fifth gear for an extended time without overheating is Maslow&#39;s <br/>
self-actualization.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Probably not until recently when I could finally keep my house <br/>
&gt; &gt; clean.  Now that is a sad commentary!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THAT is a function of finally growing up? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think that comes from my goal setting mind set.  When I was a <br/>
career woman, I thought - if I could earn as much money as my idea of <br/>
a man, I could consider myself successful.  (I realize the flaws in <br/>
this thinking but that&#39;s the way it was) <br/>
<br/>
So last night as I was asking for others to respond the my question - <br/>
when did you know you were grown up?, I gave it a quick thought <br/>
myself.  I got this image of myself throughout my adult life (I&#39;m 45) <br/>
always feeling like I was trying to get somewhere, and somehow I got <br/>
this sense that I was closer because I could keep my house picked up <br/>
and my kids were helping out.  <br/>
<br/>
I think part of this comes from my desire for control.  I can&#39;t <br/>
control my kids or my husband yet I still need something to control.  <br/>
The something seems to be my my house.<br/>
<br/>
If you guys would give me the check list for successful unschooling <br/>
mom maybe I&#39;d feel like I had some control over that role. <br/>
(OK, OK, JUST KIDDING!)<br/>
