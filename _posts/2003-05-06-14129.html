<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087966235">We had a very sad day yesterday. Our cat, Simone, who was over 20 years old <br/>
died yesterday afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
She had been sick for a while. But we did things like make a ramp to the sofa <br/>
so she could still get up there for a while. It had become clear that it <br/>
wasn&#39;t going to be much longer, and she stopped eating a couple days ago, <br/>
then almost immediately after, could no longer walk. We were also pretty sure <br/>
that she had lost most of her sight.<br/>
<br/>
She would cry sometimes, but she didn&#39;t seem to be in pain. When we held her <br/>
she would purr happily and nuzzle and cuddle in. Finally, yesterday, she <br/>
wasn&#39;t doing well, and I ended up spending all day cuddling her in my arms <br/>
(Julian held her for a while too), and she died yesterday afternoon in my <br/>
arms.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard, because it reminds me in a lot of ways of my mother&#39;s death, which <br/>
was only in November. It&#39;s been a HARD year. But I lived with Simone longer <br/>
than I did with my mother, and I&#39;ve had her longer than I have had my son!<br/>
<br/>
So, we are all sad, but it seems a nice way to die, peacefully being held <br/>
close by someone who loves you.<br/>

<br/>
My deepest sympathies to you and your family on the loss of your sweet <br/>
companion!  Your telling of Simone&#39;s passing reminds me in almost every way <br/>
of my dear companion Puiegue&#39;s passing when he was 21-1/2 years old. That <br/>
was two years ago, and he also passed away in my arms.  If those guys could <br/>
have compared notes, they probably would have had very similar stories to <br/>
tell each other, in fact.  Puiegue (pronounced pweeg, don&#39;t ask the <br/>
origin!) had lost his vision and would sometimes cry loudly but did not <br/>
seem to be in pain.  He had lost a great deal of weight and seemed so <br/>
fragile.  Sometimes he would just sit there and you might wonder if was <br/>
sleeping sitting up.  But, you&#39;d pick him up and he could not be <br/>
happier.  It was at a time when we had to move from our home. I knew that <br/>
it would be very, very hard on our dear Puiegue because we didn&#39;t know <br/>
where we were going or how many moves we would have to make before we were <br/>
actually settled, since we were down to looking at temporary housing <br/>
situations. Puiegue had always hating moving or even being in the car, and <br/>
he knew our house so well, even though he was blind.  It was hard to do, <br/>
but I finally found a semi-retired vet who would come out to our house and <br/>
euthanize Puiegue.  Our sweet friend, who lived with us all his life, <br/>
passed over peacefully in my arms, and it was one of the hardest things <br/>
I&#39;ve ever had to do.  Liam and I still cry for him, but we know that <br/>
Puiegue is still with us and he is free from that body which confined him so.<br/>
<br/>
We comforted ourselves with the knowledge that he had a really wonderful, <br/>
healthy life and a loving family, and I believe that Simone did, too.<br/>
<br/>
Love, Marji<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  The kind vet who made the trip out to our house told us that he <br/>
detected tumors of some sort in Puiegue&#39;s abdomen.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-225757973">My thoughts are with you.  Our cat died two years ago, but she lives <br/>
with us still.  My girls, at random moments will make petting movements <br/>
and tell me they have Jazzie in their lap.  Sometimes she rides on their <br/>
heads.  She goes on car trips with us.  And according to the girls, <br/>
since she&#39;s died and become our ghost cat, she&#39;s had a litter of <br/>
kittens.  She continues to be a comfort and a friend to us all.  But I <br/>
do know your pain and wish you ease of it.  HeidiC.<br/>
