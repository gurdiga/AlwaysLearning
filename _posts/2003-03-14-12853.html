the TESTS!!!<br/>

<br/>
Standardized Testing<br/>
<br/>
Testing is required only under Section 59-65-40; therefore, testing is<br/>
only required by state law if you homeschool through the school board<br/>
of the district you reside in. However, each umbrella association<br/>
decides whether testing is or is not required for their members. CHASE<br/>
SC does not require testing. If you would like to test your children<br/>
even though CHASE SC does not require testing you may contact the<br/>
following for information on their testing programs:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2009193720">We live in Minnesota. This is the first year that my oldest (7.5) has to <br/>
test. You do not report the test scores here, you just need to keep them on <br/>
file. I would have no problem playing dot-to-dot with the answer key. I <br/>
would like to devalue the test.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is my husband. He is still not completely on board with <br/>
homeschooling. I&#39;m afraid if some parts of the test come back showing <br/>
weaknesses, he is going to stress out. I have tried to print out stuff for <br/>
him to read that shows how inaccurate tests are and how they can hurt a <br/>
child&#39;s self esteem.<br/>
<br/>
She is behind grade level in reading and math. I do not care nor stress <br/>
about this. I am only worried my husband will see bad test scores and fight <br/>
to put her in school. A compromise might be to do school at home, which is <br/>
almost as bad.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So I am thinking of ordering the CAT/5 and basically cheating on it. But in <br/>
a way that my daughter wouldn&#39;t know. She would stress way to much about <br/>
cheating. So I figured I would have her do some of it.<br/>
<br/>
So has anyone else done this to safeguard their choice to homeschool?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1505464729">No testing arguments:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Adults are never assumed to take the same amount of time as each other<br/>
to learn things.  It takes some adults 2 years to finish college....it takes<br/>
some 15 or more.  Why isn&#39;t that ok for kids too?<br/>
<br/>
2.  Standardized tests are basically competitions.  No matter how high you<br/>
score if others score higher, you look bad.  Adults would rarely consider<br/>
entering a competition in an area they do not love and feel competent.  Yet,<br/>
we force that on kids.  Some kids enjoy reading, some never do.  Some kids<br/>
enjoy math, some never do.  I&#39;m not saying that well, but hopefully you get<br/>
my drift.<br/>
