<div id="ygrps-yiv-919697887">Elissa, I love Friends. Also, SCRUBS. I would not miss West Wing or that new<br/>
Kiefer Sutherland thing, 24. Oh, and I like some of the reality shows, right<br/>
now Wally and I are watching Combat Missions every week on USA. Brittany is<br/>
a Survivor nut (and Wally and I like it, too). Mikey thinks we&#39;re nuts, but<br/>
she&#39;s willing to let us have at it to see who can Outwit, Outlast and<br/>
Outplay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wally and I watched with train-wreck fascination the first run through of<br/>
Temptation Island (where they try to get committed couples to cheat on each<br/>
other). It was utterly enthralling in a very sick way. We would look at each<br/>
other and say, &quot;We can never make fun of people who watch Jerry Springer<br/>
again.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609556557">OH! I forgot. When Brit was four-ish, and she LOVED Friends, she would sing<br/>
in the grocery store (and everywhere else):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Your job&#39;s a joke, you&#39;re broke, your love-life&#39;s DOA...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I was a mere slip of a girl, I listened over and over and OVER again to<br/>
my Mom&#39;s George Carlin albums. For those not familiar with George, these<br/>
were FULL of very ripe swearing and drug-use humor and I *loved* them. I had<br/>
no idea what much of it meant, but I could understand the humor in the<br/>
cadence of it.<br/>
<br/>
Today, I&#39;m one funny gal, ask anyone. (well, almost anyone &lt;g&gt;) I may owe<br/>
much of that to listening to highly inappropriate-for-my-age George Carlin<br/>
albums. My daughter may owe something someday to Friends.<br/>
