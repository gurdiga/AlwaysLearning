<div id="ygrps-yiv-2125300443">Pit bulls get a bum rap, mostly. :) They do tend to be dog-aggressive, but<br/>
with a male and female in the house your chances of trouble in that regard<br/>
are small. Some of them will kill small furry creatures (i.e, the cats) but<br/>
many will get along with them just fine.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re clever, and they usually want to do what you want.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra, <br/>
<br/>
So the neighbors who own the dogs are in fact giving them up, they just don&#39;t <br/>
want your family to have them? <br/>
<br/>
As for the PitBull, well we have had our share. We are what some may refer to <br/>
as a PitbBull family. Including my aunts and in-laws we have somewhere around <br/>
12 Pits in the family. That is not to say that we have not experienced the <br/>
temperament that concerns you. For the most part, we have had wonderful <br/>
experiences. However, I think I posted here a while back, that our newest Pit, <br/>
Hercules II, killed our newest kitten Ace. Hercules was a puppy but as soon as he <br/>
starting getting bigger than my Schipperke, he started to display aggressive <br/>
behaviors. He became very jealous of any attention Sparky received, he then became <br/>
territorial over everything. Shipperke&#39;s by nature, are guard dogs and <br/>
although they are small in stature, they are very protective and very good defenders <br/>
of property and person. Needless to say, Sparky was getting attacked <br/>
seemingly out of the blue. Although Sparky did do some serious ass kicking, Hercules <br/>
was growing larger and my concern was that there would come a day that Sparky <br/>
would not win. <br/>
<br/>
It was very disappointing, because being from a family of Pit owners, we knew <br/>
the behavior was something that was innate in this specific dog. Phil and I <br/>
decided to separate the dogs and although I really wanted Hercules to be put <br/>
down, I knew Phil&#39;s heart was broken and he really loved what seemed a <br/>
reincarnation of our first Hercules. But their demeanors were extreme opposites. Then <br/>
we got our three new kittens. One day while shopping with my mom, Hercules saw <br/>
Ace and came through the screen of our sliding door and mauled the poor <br/>
kitten. Kass & Kree were hysterical and since it all happened so quickly, while Phil <br/>
was mowing the lawn, they couldn&#39;t save the kitten. The bigger issue for me <br/>
upon walking in to the house and seeing everyone in tears was that at least it <br/>
wasn&#39;t one of my daughters. We rushed the kitten to the vet and a hundred <br/>
dollars later he was home with us to live out his last few hours. I ended up <br/>
putting him down myself. It was horrible. Yet Ace was the small sacrifice that made <br/>
us understand that for the first time we had one of those Pits. I was angry, <br/>
not because the dog acted upon his instincts, but because we hadn&#39;t accepted <br/>
that he was not the dog for us earlier. <br/>
<br/>
It would have been tougher to get rid of him without the killing of the <br/>
kitten, because until he started fighting with Sparky, he slept with Kass and Kree. <br/>
We all loved him, we know how to handle Pits, yet we still had a bad <br/>
experience. So even though we miss poor Ace and are sorry for the way he died, without <br/>
his death, I wonder if we would still have Hercules II. In which case it may <br/>
not have been a kitten, but rather a kid. I know none of us would have been <br/>
able to live with that.<br/>
<br/>
So although I still believe that the environment they live in is a factor, it <br/>
also remains that they are wired to kill. Everytime he went after Sparky it <br/>
was straight for the throat. Sometimes when Sparky just walked by. <br/>
<br/>
Now Hercules, the first, was the complete opposite. He was gentle and lovable <br/>
and just really large. He accepted Sparky&#39;s status as the alpha male the <br/>
entire time. The only aggression he ever displayed was against a Rottweiler that <br/>
beelined for Sparky only to be taken out by Hercules. He was protective of <br/>
Sparky and the twins. But not in the sense that I ever worried about his <br/>
interactions with them or even strangers. When he was stolen from our yard, I cried and <br/>
cried. I hadn&#39;t even originally wanted him. But as all things that start that <br/>
way, I grew attached to him in such a way, that the loss of him broke my <br/>
heart, and that of my Dh and the girls. I searched day and night for him, I <br/>
visited every shelter for about a 50 mile radius. We never got him back. <br/>
<br/>
Some five years later, when Phil had a friend with papered puppies, he went <br/>
to look and was shocked to see Hercules II, exact same markings and what seemed <br/>
like getting back the one we missed. But we were wrong to think the original <br/>
Hercules could ever be replaced.<br/>
<br/>
So I won&#39;t say don&#39;t keep her, but if you do be cautious of negative <br/>
behaviors that are not learned, but that are innate and less likely to be changed. All <br/>
the advice in the world won&#39;t matter if someone or something you love gets <br/>
hurt. <br/>
<br/>
Good Luck and let us know what happens.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Okay well I left out the dog we had between Hercules 1 & 2. Phil fell in love <br/>
with my best friends Pomeranians! Which you&#39;d kind of have to know Phil, to <br/>
know that is the last dog a person would ever expect him to even look twice at. <br/>
Phil stands a solid 6 feet tall at about 230 lbs. Pure muscle, a man&#39;s man <br/>
and a Marine. Anyway when my friends dogs got pregnant, Phil was guaranteed his <br/>
pick. He chose a blonde female that the twins named Lucy (their adornment of <br/>
the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, they wanted to say everytime they walked in the <br/>
dorr...&quot;Lucy...we&#39;re home!!!). <br/>
<br/>
Anyway she was the perfect little rat-dog. Pure bred and as gorgeous as any <br/>
show Pom we had ever seen. She was feisty, loved running endless laps around <br/>
the pool and thought she was the queen of all cricket catchers. Then she would <br/>
kiss and lick Sparky as he just sat looking worn out from watching her use so <br/>
much energy. She would pester him to no end and he would finally give in and <br/>
play with her. She was the epitome of a female. She would be naughty all day and <br/>
the second Phil got home she&#39;d slow down and seem coy as though we were all <br/>
making up the stuff she did. As we bitched about things she done, she just lick <br/>
his face as if to say Kass & Kree & I were all lying... He would talk to her <br/>
and tell her he knew we were making things up about her. It could have been <br/>
irritating, except that it was so damn funny. <br/>
<br/>
Two weeks before our house was done being built, someone poisoned her. We <br/>
lived with my other best friend, who had a loser of a boyfriend. We will never <br/>
know for sure how it happened, but the boyfriend was mad at us, primarily at <br/>
Phil, because we were tired of his shit. So we buried her in my girlfriends <br/>
backyard. <br/>
<br/>
Phil got the second Hercules about six months after we moved into this house. <br/>
He missed Lucy so much and the whole idea of another Hercules, he just <br/>
couldn&#39;t pass up getting the new Pit. I wish now, we had gotten a new Pomeranian <br/>
instead. There is a Disney movie with a psycho little Pom, that looks just like <br/>
his Lucy. When it comes on, he can&#39;t watch it without getting angry about <br/>
people who are cruel and use animals to get to people. So he calls upon the dog <br/>
gods to make sure such people get their just deserves.<br/>

<br/>
Good friends have a female Blue Heeler, she&#39;s not a push over but still<br/>
sweet and gentle.  They were very careful to establish their own dominance<br/>
in her mind and I think it&#39;s a gamble with this breed.  They have been happy<br/>
with her, their kids are older but she still tries to &quot;herd&quot; them, nipping<br/>
at their heels if they&#39;re being loud or boisterous.<br/>

My parents got a Pom just before I was born, Skeeter, he was my mom&#39;s dog<br/>
until I arrived when he decided my Dad was his best friend.  I grew up with<br/>
this little guy, he was the biggest personality in my life for many years.<br/>
<br/>
He didn&#39;t know he was tiny, we say he had a &quot;Napoleon Complex&quot;.  He would<br/>
challenge any dog, any size with enough courage to fuel a super hero.  He<br/>
was over 10 years old, lost all of his teeth and disappeared one night<br/>
during a thunderstorm.  He had gone out to go potty and must have bolted<br/>
when he heard thunder.  He was one of the best two dogs we ever had.<br/>

  Boy isn&#39;t that the truth!!! Good one Pam, you had me rolling!!! <br/>
<br/>
  Okay well I left out the dog we had between Hercules 1 & 2. Phil fell in love <br/>
  with my best friends Pomeranians! Which you&#39;d kind of have to know Phil, to <br/>
  know that is the last dog a person would ever expect him to even look twice at. <br/>
  Phil stands a solid 6 feet tall at about 230 lbs. Pure muscle, a man&#39;s man <br/>
  and a Marine. Anyway when my friends dogs got pregnant, Phil was guaranteed his <br/>
  pick. He chose a blonde female that the twins named Lucy (their adornment of <br/>
  the &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, they wanted to say everytime they walked in the <br/>
  dorr...&quot;Lucy...we&#39;re home!!!). <br/>
<br/>
  Anyway she was the perfect little rat-dog. Pure bred and as gorgeous as any <br/>
  show Pom we had ever seen. She was feisty, loved running endless laps around <br/>
  the pool and thought she was the queen of all cricket catchers. Then she would <br/>
  kiss and lick Sparky as he just sat looking worn out from watching her use so <br/>
  much energy. She would pester him to no end and he would finally give in and <br/>
  play with her. She was the epitome of a female. She would be naughty all day and <br/>
  the second Phil got home she&#39;d slow down and seem coy as though we were all <br/>
  making up the stuff she did. As we bitched about things she done, she just lick <br/>
  his face as if to say Kass & Kree & I were all lying... He would talk to her <br/>
  and tell her he knew we were making things up about her. It could have been <br/>
  irritating, except that it was so damn funny. <br/>
<br/>
  Two weeks before our house was done being built, someone poisoned her. We <br/>
  lived with my other best friend, who had a loser of a boyfriend. We will never <br/>
  know for sure how it happened, but the boyfriend was mad at us, primarily at <br/>
  Phil, because we were tired of his shit. So we buried her in my girlfriends <br/>
  backyard. <br/>
<br/>
  Phil got the second Hercules about six months after we moved into this house. <br/>
  He missed Lucy so much and the whole idea of another Hercules, he just <br/>
  couldn&#39;t pass up getting the new Pit. I wish now, we had gotten a new Pomeranian <br/>
  instead. There is a Disney movie with a psycho little Pom, that looks just like <br/>
  his Lucy. When it comes on, he can&#39;t watch it without getting angry about <br/>
  people who are cruel and use animals to get to people. So he calls upon the dog <br/>
  gods to make sure such people get their just deserves.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK, here is my pit bull experience.  I can never be<br/>
comfortable around pit bulls, although reason tells me<br/>
that there must be some who overcome the breeding of<br/>
centuries, particularly now that they are not all bred<br/>
for pit fighting.<br/>
<br/>
However...<br/>
<br/>
When I was about 7 and my brother 8 and we were<br/>
growing up in the city (San Francisco) we were awoken<br/>
in the predawn hours Christmas morning to the sounds<br/>
of screaming, shouting and commotion.  Now we didn&#39;t<br/>
live in a bad neighborhood, so this was not typical or<br/>
anything.  We ran to the upper floor window to see our<br/>
neighborhood paper boy, delivering early so he could<br/>
be home with his family later, down on the sidewalk<br/>
being mauled by two pit bulls.  A man in a long coat<br/>
was holding their leashes and calmly watching.<br/>
<br/>
Our pajama clad father rushed out into the street, and<br/>
the man and his dogs ran off.  My dad carried the<br/>
paper boy into the house, clothes torn, streaming<br/>
blood, half conscious and he was laid out on the floor<br/>
on a blanket in the front hall while the ambulance was<br/>
called.  My parents didn&#39;t want to move him any<br/>
further than necessary.  My brother and I watched,<br/>
round eyed, through the stair railing halfway up the<br/>
stairs, as he was triaged by our parents, then the<br/>
EMTs.  It was a subdued Christmas morning.<br/>
<br/>
A few weeks later, after he was out of the hospital,<br/>
the paper boy came by with his family to thank my<br/>
father for saving his life.  His face was permanently<br/>
scarred and stitched up, one arm and one leg were<br/>
badly broken.  I&#39;m sure he had other injuries that<br/>
were not as visible.  His parents had to carry him up<br/>
the porch steps so he could thank my father, but it<br/>
was important to him they said.<br/>
<br/>
So, I don&#39;t like pit bulls and I doubt I ever will. <br/>
But that is just one experience, and obviously the<br/>
&quot;nurture&quot; (torture?) factor played a role in it, as<br/>
the owner was obviously some sadistic bastard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1272777895">There are a great many breeds of dog that have been specifically created by<br/>
humans to behave with aggression one way or another -- pit bulls for dog<br/>
fighting, bulldogs for bull and bear-baiting, Irish Wolfhounds are<br/>
responsible for the fact that there are no more wolves in Ireland, Jack<br/>
Russell Terriers to be ratters without equal, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When instinct is permitted to go awry, through bad breeding or bad handling,<br/>
it is the fault of the human half of the covenant. It is not a matter of pit<br/>
bulls (or any other hunting or guard breed) to &quot;overcome&quot; the breeding of<br/>
centuries, it is a matter of non-animal-savvy people not thinking these or<br/>
any dog (or cat or horse or snake or rabbit) is a wind-up toy.<br/>
<br/>
In our irresponsible society, dog bites are a symptom of human idiocy.<br/>

Your dad really was a hero. And the owner of the dogs...:::shudder:::<br/>

I suppose it&#39;s easier to torture a pit into becoming a killer than, say,<br/>
a lab...<br/>

I see a lot of families who have no clue how to &quot;talk&quot; to their dogs, let<br/>
them know where they fit in the pack.  Neighbor with a lab who has been<br/>
allowed to become alpha and is now biting the kids.  While a savvy friend<br/>
has a blue heeler who, while not reduced to omega, definitely knows she&#39;s<br/>
isn&#39;t the leader.  A breed that isn&#39;t supposed to be good with kids but was<br/>
raised well and I trust her with mine, even though she does do her best to<br/>
keep the &quot;herd&quot; together and calm. *grin*<br/>
<br/>
Breeds don&#39;t mean as much if you don&#39;t know how to communicate what is<br/>
&quot;okay&quot; behavior for them.  The neighbor&#39;s lab worries me, Jonathan is so<br/>
small and I&#39;m worried she will go off on him because she feels her place in<br/>
the pack is threatened.  I think she is going to do just that to SOME kid<br/>
and be put down.<br/>
