<div id="ygrps-yiv-874847555">This will be too long or boring for some of you, maybe, and that won&#39;t hurt <br/>
my feelings.  It&#39;s an example of what might happen if someone DOES object to <br/>
e-mail humor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A friend from years ago sent me a list of jokes about children, just an <br/>
e-mail forward.  I&#39;ve known her for 25 years.  She&#39;s very Mormon, but never <br/>
married.  (So for her families and children are kind of a sore subject <br/>
already.)  She adopted three Russian sisters, just a few years ago, and is <br/>
very strict with them, and used to write me complaining about how they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t work hard at school, or just liked boys, or whatever.   She&#39;s a <br/>
theatre teacher, which I think is cool, but I&#39;ve always known she was very <br/>
into disciplinarian attitudes.   So she includes me on this long copylist, <br/>
two of the jokes are offensive to me and harmful to children (in my opinion) <br/>
so I responded to the list.  Here are the first exchanges.  I&#39;ve put little <br/>
intros.  The addresses on the list were several teachers (school system <br/>
addresses like the originator&#39;s) and one is her niece (young woman in her <br/>
20&#39;s) and the others I have no clue.  But reasonable assumption is SLC crowd, <br/>
LDS, heavily professional educators.<br/>
<br/>
***********************<br/>
My first response<br/>
***********************<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This one&#39;s very sad to read for people who WILL sleep with their kids, or let <br/>
the kids come and sleep with them.  And the one below is sad for other <br/>
reasons.    <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; <br/>
One summer evening during a violent thunderstorm a mother was tucking<br/>
her son into bed. She was about to turn off the light when he asked with<br/>
a tremor in his voice, &quot;Mommy, will you sleep with me tonight?&quot;<br/>
The mother smiled and gave him a reassuring hug. &quot;I can&#39;t dear,&quot; shig sissy.&quot;<br/>
_________________________________________________ <br/>
We let our kids stay up.  They can get water whenever they want, or we&#39;ll <br/>
bring it to them if they ask. We don&#39;t spank our kids at all, and they&#39;re <br/>
really sweet and wonderful, so this one is sad too:<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
A small boy is sent to bed by his father.<br/>
Five minutes later....<br/>
&quot;Da-ad....&quot;<br/>
&quot;What?<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m thirsty. Can you bring drink of water?&quot;<br/>
&quot;No. You had your chance. Lights out.&quot;<br/>
Five minutes later:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Da-aaaad.....&quot;<br/>
&quot;WHAT?&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m THIRSTY. Can I have a drink of water??&quot;<br/>
&quot;I told you NO!&quot; If you ask again, I&#39;ll have to  spank you!!&quot;<br/>
Five minutes later......<br/>
&quot;Daaaa-aaaad.....&quot;<br/>
&quot;WHAT!&quot;<br/>
&quot;When you come in to spank me, can you bring a drink of water?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Humor like this encourages parents to treat children coldly.<br/>
<br/>
I wish more parents would say &quot;not funny&quot; so that fewer parents would think <br/>
treating children harshly is cute.<br/>

I know this was a cold response.  &quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to offend you&quot; is <br/>

    Sandra,<br/>
    I don&#39;t know you so I&#39;m not pointing this at you in particular, but what <br/>
I think is more sad is the state our society is in because too many <br/>
tenderhearted people can&#39;t keep their perspective where child rearing is <br/>
concerned.  They think we&#39;re all monsters who are incapable of moderating <br/>
ourselves where disciplining children is concerned.  Our children are growing <br/>
up without a sense of proportion or respect for authority.  If more adults <br/>
kept their perspective, stopped reading more into situations than exists, and <br/>
allowed parents to raise their own children as they saw fit, we&#39;d have a lot <br/>
more happy children.  Humor is one way we deal with life and our place in it, <br/>
with sometimes strange or uncomfortable situations.  If more people retained <br/>
their sense of humor, then we&#39;d have a lot fewer lawyers, a lot fewer <br/>
paranoid people, and a lot more joy in life.<br/>
    I don&#39;t have children, I have dogs, but I can tell you my dogs are very <br/>
happy when they know who is boss, what their limits are, when they are doing <br/>
things well and when they are in trouble (and exactly what they did to get in <br/>
trouble), and what is expected of them when living in my home.  I think our <br/>
children would benefit from many of the same rules for living, but so many <br/>
parents and teachers are afraid to place reasonable limits and consequences <br/>
on kids because of the overreactions of well-meaning people who took their <br/>
meddling too far.<br/>
    Yes, there are people who are monsters and go too far, yes there are <br/>
people who deserve to be sued or lose their kids because they are bad people. <br/>
 But to treat everyone as if they are that kind of, very much in the <br/>
minority, person is really very sad.  Because of a minority of monsters, <br/>
we&#39;re creating a majority of out of control children who get themselves <br/>
killed because their parents were too afraid of the system to stop them from <br/>
getting out of control in the first place.<br/>
    Whoa, where did THAT soap box come from...<br/>

************************************************************************<br/>
So I responded, to the whole group again:<br/>
<br/>
************************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  Whoa, where did THAT soap box come from...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From your beliefs!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I don&#39;t have children, I have dogs, &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do have children, so I have more stake in this than you do, right?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; too many tenderhearted people can&#39;t keep their perspective where child <br/>
rearing is concerned.  They think we&#39;re all monsters who are incapable of <br/>
moderating ourselves where disciplining children is concerned.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We&quot; who are monsters?<br/>
<br/>
Rape jokes were very bad, and people make few of them now because women kept <br/>
saying &quot;Stop, that&#39;s not funny.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Racist jokes are not NEARLY as common as they were when I was little, because <br/>
people said &quot;Stop, this makes things worse.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If jokes about being mean to children are &quot;funny,&quot; people will continue to be <br/>
mean to children, just because they&#39;re children, and just because other <br/>
adults laugh and thereby seem to encourage it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But to treat everyone as if they are that kind of, very much in the <br/>
minority, person is really very sad. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This seems like saying that objecting to rape jokes treats everyone as a <br/>
rapist.  Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Because of a minority of monsters, we&#39;re creating a majority of out of <br/>
control children who get themselves killed because their parents were too <br/>
afraid of the system to stop them from getting out of control in the first <br/>
place.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t out of control.  I used to swat, but I totally stopped.  It&#39;s <br/>
stupid.<br/>
<br/>
We have a very happy home full of humor, so suggesting I have no sense of <br/>
humor is way off mark.   Here&#39;s a public confession of one of the last time I <br/>
swatted a child:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/zeneverything">http://sandradodd.com/zeneverything</a><br/>
<br/>
I was wrong.  He was right.<br/>
<br/>
Had I &quot;shown him who was the boss,&quot; I would have been a monster at that <br/>
moment.<br/>
People should claim authority from being good and right, not from being <br/>
bigger or older and acting on impulse.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t have children, I have dogs, but I can tell you my dogs are very <br/>
happy when they know who is boss, what their limits are, when they are doing <br/>
things well and when they are in trouble (and exactly what they did to get in <br/>
trouble), and what is expected of them when living in my home. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a dog who has the freedom to leave the yard and doesn&#39;t.<br/>
My children live in the same house I do, but it&#39;s their home too.  They&#39;re <br/>
not guests.  Each is living in his or her own home.<br/>
<br/>
Look into the eyes of these children if you think more spanking is good, or <br/>
forced bedtimes in the dark are funny, and see if you really can still think <br/>
that.<br/>

<br/>
I applaud you for being able to raise your children by methods that your feel <br/>
are more humane.  I&#39;m happy these means work for you.  I&#39;m sure they work for <br/>
many, much better than ruling by fear or pain.  However, I don&#39;t think <br/>
disciplining children with contraint constitutes ruling by fear or pain, but <br/>
rather shows consequences to actions that the child understands very clearly. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think that &quot;one size fits all&quot; where raising kids are concerned, <br/>
nor do I think social services/govt. bureacracies should be telling everyone <br/>
how to do it.  I also don&#39;t think calling people abusive for spanking or ins<br/>
isting on limits to be fair.  I see our society as having taken a few steps <br/>
way too far toward regulating parents to the point that child rearing is <br/>
becoming disfunctional in the opposite direction, just because we are trying <br/>
to stop a few people who shouldn&#39;t be parents in the first place.  Most of <br/>
the parents I know never need to spank their children, rarely need to yell at <br/>
them, are perfectly capable of placing limits and rules and pointing out what <br/>
is not acceptable without raising their voices, but also understand that <br/>
there must be consequences to stepping outside the boundaries, and those <br/>
consequences must be something the child understands and wants to avoid in <br/>
the future or else they don&#39;t work.  To the opposite, I know parents whose <br/>
children are out of control, who have to go to pretty far extremes to manage <br/>
their children because they tried to use consequences that the child either <br/>
doesn&#39;t respect or believe, or purely doesn&#39;t comprehend as a child, to the <br/>
point where their children do not know how to interpret when they&#39;ve gone too <br/>
far.  I&#39;m not trying to change your beliefs with all of this, it just hit a <br/>
chord.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t get your correlation between rapists, rape jokes, and the humor you <br/>
pointed out as bad.  You saw that humor as containing abusive behavior in it, <br/>
while I did not.  Yes, there are jokes that go too far and I&#39;m very glad they <br/>
are discouraged.  I just didn&#39;t happen to think those qualified since they <br/>
were poking fun at some very normal and functional behaviors (in mine, not <br/>
your, opinion).<br/>

<br/>
My first reaction to the jokes, before I read your reply, was that people <br/>
used to make jokes along those lines about women and people of different <br/>
races and nationalities.  When you speak out against it enough, it stops and <br/>
children are people too.  You said way more and I think you made a bunch of <br/>
good points.  <br/>
<br/>
I have said a couple of things to my best friend.  She often will forward <br/>
jokes and not think about what she is forwarding.  Her response is always &quot;I <br/>
was just forwarding it.&quot;  I always say that when you forward something you <br/>
are suggesting that it is worth reading and that you agree or condone it.  <br/>
<br/>
It is sooooo sad that people still regard children as property.  Something to <br/>
be seen and not heard, follow commands without question.  How will anyone <br/>
learn to think for themselves if they are never given a chance?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, so much more on this subject but you were very straight forward with <br/>
your response, as usual, and very good at expressing what some of us wish we <br/>
could.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Humor like this encourages parents to treat children coldly.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I agree with your point that joking about being mean to kids should <br/>
not be acceptable, and the first one and many others I&#39;ve heard, I <br/>
find saddness in, not humor.  I did laugh at this one though, <br/>
because  I think it points to the ridiculousness of the father in <br/>
denying his child a basic need.  In the end, the child is the smart <br/>
one in relaying just how important his need was, and not just a power <br/>
stuggle game.  It says to me that parents need to trust their kids.<br/>
<br/>
I often get reminded of when I&#39;m being ridiculous by my kids.  It <br/>
usually sets me straight and makes me laugh at myself and reminds me <br/>
that I live with some really wise people.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1408467054">Hi.  My name is Crystal.  I have been lurking here for a few months now<br/>
because I think that at this point in my unschooling I need to listen more<br/>
than I speak.  I wanted to give my thoughts on this subject, though.<br/>
<br/>
I just got the joke in my email yesterday from my sister about the child who<br/>
learned in school that he had rights.  I remembered the updated one that I<br/>
saw here so I sent that one back with a polite little note saying that I<br/>
thought it was disrespectful and I liked the new one better.  I also sent<br/>
the new version to everyone on her email list along with the note I wrote on<br/>
how I thought it was disrespectful to kids.  She wrote back screaming to me<br/>
in her email about &quot;how dare any kid threaten their parent with calling CPS&quot;<br/>
and that if you didn&#39;t take control your kids will end up pregnant or in<br/>
jail.  She titled it, &quot;Don&#39;t Mess with Mom&quot;.  I haven&#39;t responded to that<br/>
but so many people feel that way.  I think that most people don&#39;t look at<br/>
the real message being sent.  It&#39;s a joke, they laugh, they pass it on.<br/>
This is not a joke, though.  It is a message to kids that &quot;I am the parent,<br/>
I am stronger&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t send all the jokes I get to everyone on my email list.  I don&#39;t send<br/>
sexual jokes to anyone under 25.  I don&#39;t send male bashing jokes to my sons<br/>
or brothers unless I want to direct it at them, so I think that when people<br/>
send these disrespectful jokes to parents it&#39;s because they don&#39;t believe<br/>
there is anything wrong with being disrespectful.<br/>
<br/>
I saw the same type of message in a commercial on TV today being tooted as<br/>
good parenting.  It was telling parents to snoop into their teenager&#39;s<br/>
things to keep them from doing drugs.  It said something to the effects that<br/>
your kids would be mad at you and may even hate you, but they would thank<br/>
you later and that if you love them, you will do it.  If TV is telling you<br/>
that you have to disrespect your children, then how can any good parent go<br/>
against that?<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t been unschooling long enough to say &quot;look at how my kids turned<br/>
out&quot;, but my thoughts to this is that if your kids feel like you are<br/>
partners in their life, then they won&#39;t treat you like you are an adversary.<br/>
You will have no need to snoop and they will have no need to call CPS.  I&#39;ve<br/>
said this to people before and I&#39;ve gotten responses like, &quot;you have to be<br/>
the parent, not their friend&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>

treat you like you are an adversary&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Most people think of the parent/child relationship as an adversarial<br/>
one.  Any time I&#39;ve pointed out that we don&#39;t live that way, I&#39;ve been<br/>

Rain made a new friend at rehearsals last week, also honmeschooled.<br/>
Yesterday I was driving them both to the theater and the friend was<br/>
talking about how her parents always go on and on about the importance of<br/>
proper nutrition (I bought her a kiwi snow bubble with tapioca, which<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem too nutritious but neither of us mentioned it). I asked if<br/>
her parents were always trying to shove protein into her when she has a<br/>
meltdown, and she said no, and added that if she had a meltdown her<br/>
parents would make her stay in her room for 3 hours and then go pick up<br/>
dog poop from the back yard.<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t quite sure what to say...<br/>

&quot;to be the parent&quot;. My dad one time made a comment after Jason went to <br/>
get a soda (we had just given up restricting sweets) about remembering <br/>
who the parent was...<br/>
<br/>
It is hard because my kids are only 6 and 3 so I can&#39;t say &quot;I told you so&quot;.<br/>
And it is hard because this is something that I have felt in my heart since<br/>
the boys were born but found no one that agreed with me. It is only in the<br/>
last 6 months or so that I have really felt comfortable going with my heart<br/>
and not feeling like I have to constantly &quot;teach them lessons&quot; and &quot;nip things<br/>
in the bud&quot;. And we are slowly getting into that grove that I have read about <br/>
other  unschoolers having. I am not perfectly there yet, but seeing so much <br/>
progress and I love it. It is really hard explaining how I feel to others though.<br/>
They just look at me like I am nuts.<br/>
<br/>
I am so glad to have folks here tell me that my heart is not wrong and that I am not<br/>
nuts. Folks with older kids who say, yes it can and does work (too many times I get that<br/>
condescending &quot;just wait until your kids are older&quot;). I have some friends with teens<br/>
and I would hate to have the same relationship they have...but they think they have<br/>
no choice but to ground and restrict and lay down the law. So sad...<br/>

I do want to be my kids friend and their advisor and their confidante, not their<br/>
jailer...<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; melt down and go grab some protein as a preventative?  Three hours?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t get the impression that this other girl had protein issues -<br/>
Rain does, or did, and so did one of her close friends, so they just come<br/>
to mind for me whenever anyone talks about nutrition.Actually, though,<br/>
Rain can go a lot longer now that she&#39;s older. The last meltdown she had<br/>
was after sleeping over (and probably not sleeping much) at a friend&#39;s<br/>
house and eating nothing but a bowl of cereal in the morning and popcorn<br/>
in the afternoon (and she&#39;s in the middle of a growth spurt), and then<br/>
tearing her brand new jeans on a bike on the way home, at 7 or so... so<br/>
that was sort of understandable, although I didn&#39;t feel so understanding<br/>
when we were standing in front of her friend&#39;s quite suburban house and<br/>
she was screaming at me that she wanted to be driven to the Gap corporate<br/>
headquarters *right then* so she could insist that they give her a<br/>
replacement pair of jeans, and then she punched me when I was not upset<br/>
enough about the ripped jeans.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s the first meltdown like that in a year or so, and when she was<br/>
5 and 6 it was more like twice a week, so it&#39;s okay. And after we had a<br/>
pumpkin smash with a protein boost at Jamba Juice, Rain calmed down and<br/>
decided the jeans could be cut-offs, since it was getting warmer outside.<br/>
And I asked her what she had eaten that day and left it at that, because<br/>
my pushing the protein thing had been an issue in the past... this time I<br/>
just ordered the pumpkin smash and stuck it in her cup holder...and she<br/>
apologized to me, which is nice.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know about this new friend - Rain only met her a couple of weeks<br/>
ago and I only met the family this week. She seemed happy and bubbly and<br/>
the family interactions were pleasant and supportive. I don&#39;t know how<br/>
long they&#39;ve homeschooled - they did mention school. So perhaps the 3<br/>
hours was some theatrical hyperbole, or perhaps this was a one-time thing<br/>
- Rain still tells people about the time I got really mad when she was 5<br/>
and threw a half-dozen apples against a wall - or perhaps her parents are<br/>
transitioning from one kind of living to another.  They did go to the HSC<br/>
conference last year, or at least they had last year&#39;s bag (I have the<br/>
bag too but didn&#39;t go to the conference, so perhaps one shouldn&#39;t jump to<br/>
conclusions).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How&#39;s Rain&#39;s arm, by the way?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fully functional but noticeably crooked, she goes back to the orthopedic<br/>
guy in 3 months and he&#39;ll be able to tell then if it&#39;s going to<br/>
straighten on it&#39;s own. How&#39;s your leg?<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and while I&#39;m babbling on, we got a new dog, and I don&#39;t think I<br/>
talked about him here. :) We dogsat for a friend&#39;s black lab about 6<br/>
weeks ago - we&#39;ve been his regular replacement people for years - and<br/>
after one evening of being clingy and nervous Nana really seemed to enjoy<br/>
his company. They had great walks together, sniffing stuff, and she<br/>
seemed to take her cues from him a lot, on when to lie down and when to<br/>
go out and stuff. She seemed more comfortable... and we actually went to<br/>
visit them in Alameda last weekend and she went right up to him, sat in<br/>
front of him, and wagged her tail, which is just not typical Nana<br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
So, we started poking around online and found a chocolate lab (Rain&#39;s<br/>
Dream Breed) marked Urgent, and acquired Keith. He&#39;s an old dog, at least<br/>
10, who was found as a stray in Redding  and then spent a year in some<br/>
sort of shelter where he was basically locked up in a cement cage and<br/>
ignored, until recently the shelter was closed down and he was rescued.<br/>
He chewed all the fur from his tail out of boredom while he was there,<br/>
and his coat is dull and his teeth are bad, but he&#39;s still a sweet dog,<br/>
very snuggly, and we&#39;re getting him back on track. Nana doesn&#39;t like him<br/>
quite as much as Mack - he tends to get possessive of us and growls when<br/>
we pet her, so we&#39;re trying to make sure he gets treats or petting<br/>
whenever we pet her, to create some positive links - but they have great<br/>
fun on walks together, it&#39;s spring on the farm and they sniff all the<br/>
same things and run shoulder to shoulder. And Nana seems to follow his<br/>
leadon stuff, too - she used to wait until the lights were out at night<br/>
to eat dinner, but since Keith arrived she starts eating as soon as he<br/>
does, which for him (being a lab) is right about when the bowl hits the<br/>
floor.<br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s what we&#39;re up to, more or less...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141034068">Hi.  I&#39;m new. This is my first post.  I&#39;ve been reading about all the<br/>
anti-child humor and I&#39;ve alway thought it so sad that the general<br/>
stereotype is that kid&#39;s are all &quot;bad&quot; and the parents should never<br/>
play the role of friend until the children are adults.  <br/>
<br/>
My biggest frustration in this area now is I just had my fourth<br/>
daughter.  Second only to the comments of sorrow for me because I<br/>
didn&#39;t have a boy (nobody seems to notice that I&#39;m not crying about<br/>
it)  everyone, especially strangers, say &quot;just wait til they are all<br/>
teenagers!&quot;  So according to everyone, upon becoming young women, my<br/>
beautiful, sweet, intelligent babies are going to become fighting<br/>
machines with no sense or feeling outside of making my life miserable.<br/>
<br/>
I understand about hormones and all, but if I buy into this<br/>
mentalitiy, of course my kids will hate me.  I&#39;ll have programmed them<br/>
and myself into it.  So I tell people, &quot;Yeah, I can&#39;t wait.  Then<br/>
we&#39;ll finally be able to share clothes!&quot;  Then I turn their attention<br/>
to the mismatched ourfits that my kids are wearing (I always let them<br/>
choose their own clothes.  This seems to shut them up pretty quick.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-600265966">I have 3 daughters, 18, 15 and 12. I&#39;m GLAD I have only girls. I&#39;m sure <br/>
if I had only boys or both boys and girls, I&#39;d be glad about that too, <br/>
of course!!<br/>
<br/>
Having three teenager girls in the house (and, believe me, the 12 yo is <br/>
right there -youngest kids grow up faster in some ways) - can be really <br/>
very difficult at times - that is the truth.  But it is no MORe the <br/>
truth than that having 3 toddlers can be difficult, etc.  So - as long <br/>
as you don&#39;t expect that you&#39;ll always be totally &#39;in synch&quot; with your <br/>
teenage girls - it will still be a wonderful experience - i wouldn&#39;t <br/>
skip it for anything.<br/>
<br/>
Ever watch the Cosby show? The teenager girls (and one boy) exploits - <br/>
disagreements with parents, etc., are there - but you just KNOW they <br/>
all love each other dearly and they clearly enjoy each others&#39; company, <br/>
etc. I don&#39;t think the show is all that realistic in terms of how the <br/>
parents behave toward the kids<br/>
<br/>
That is a reasonable expectation, imo.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1817480085">Hi Kate!  Our littlest is four months today.  The beauty of having four <br/>
girls or boys is that you really no longer have a middle child to feel <br/>
left out.  I agree with you about conflict often coming when other kids <br/>
come over.  It seems to divide the unit that the girls are when alone. <br/>
 But I suppose that is something we will have to learn to overcome. <br/>
 Sometimes things need to be difficult before they can get <br/>
better...speaking of which, where are you in the Middle East?  Are you <br/>
all okay?  Whenever I think of the families over there, my heart fills <br/>
my throat.  It is my sincerest wish that this war does not touch your <br/>
family in any way.  Be safe and happy.   Sincerely, Heidi Case<br/>

our window. It&#39;s just not so foreign feeling! Plus we have lots of Iraqi,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1733789401">Judging from your name, I gather you&#39;re not originally from the Middle <br/>
East.  How did you end up there?  It sounds like you like  it there. <br/>
 Are there eductional requirements you must meet like here in NY?<br/>
My girls are very, very maternal with the baby.  Sometimes I feel bad <br/>
because my older sister has a 2 yr old girl (as do I) and a 7 month old <br/>
boy.  Her daughter is very aggressive toward her brother and my sister <br/>
is always asking me if any of my girls were like that.  I have to say <br/>
no, but I feel bad that she makes the comparison.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s because we and our households are so opposite.  Our house: <br/>
I stay at home, home births, co-sleeping, unschooling, no schedule at <br/>
all except for a loose bedtime for the girls, meals whenever and <br/>
wherever, lots of playtime but strict rules of courtesy, respect and <br/>
manners.  Her house: both parents work full time, hospital births, in <br/>
cribs to maintain strict sleeping schedules, structured daycare with <br/>
only same-age children, very strict meal/snack schedules, limited <br/>
playspace due to a house in constant construction.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I feel sad for her and her kids.  They are all always sick and <br/>
so tense.  I just don&#39;t understand how in a world like today&#39;s with its <br/>
viruses, wars, etc. anyone would choose to live a life so focused on <br/>
materialism.  It all comes down to that, I think, because if it weren&#39;t <br/>
so important to my sister to keep such an expensive house, clothes, and <br/>
other things, she could stay at home and least show her kids that they <br/>
are the most important thing really.  She wouldn&#39;t even have to go as <br/>
far as I do (home births, unschooling).  If only she could just be there <br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
One of the best part of our lives is that every day is like a holiday. <br/>
 And we really truly are enjoying every day.  My older girls go to bed <br/>
saying &quot;this was the best day we&#39;ve ever had.&quot;  And like I said, with <br/>
the instability of our world, shouldn&#39;t we all try to make each day the <br/>
best day we&#39;ve ever had, if for no other reason because we had the good <br/>
fortune to be blessed with the oppotunity just to have another day.  <br/>
<br/>
May you all have your best day ever!  Sincerely,  Heidi Case<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; with the instability of our world, shouldn&#39;t we all try to make each day <br/>
the <br/>

BEAUTIFUL.<br/>

Thanks.<br/>
