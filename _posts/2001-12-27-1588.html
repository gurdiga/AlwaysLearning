<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292115393">I be thinkin&#39; that some of you peoples were a wee bit repressed as children <br/>
and couldn&#39;a tell poo jokes?<br/>
What&#39;s with all the poop jokes? I&#39;m definitely not getting the humor, sorry. <br/>
Not trying to be a poop grinch or anything...<br/>
<br/>
My kids would love it undoubtedly.<br/>

I like the story about your superior arguement skills Sandra. That&#39;s very <br/>
cool that you realized how you had the upper hand (would any of us have <br/>
guessed differently?) and chose to give some slack. I think I probably try <br/>
that with my dh a bit too much....although his skills have improved in that <br/>
arena.<br/>
Darn!<br/>
I think I should like to see those skills at work in a debate against Kent <br/>
Hovind (anyone know him? A creation scientist that is very arrogant and a <br/>
great debater) or maybe against an HSLDA figurehead. Now THAT would be <br/>
entertaining!<br/>
We&#39;d have to form a cheerleading squad.....<br/>
&quot;That&#39;s alright, that&#39;s ok, Sandra&#39;s gonna beat you anyway!!&quot; <br/>
haha<br/>

I was repressed, and more, as a child.  However my<br/>
mother was not constrained in the language SHE used in<br/>
order to do the repressing. Just before I left home I<br/>
practiced saying &quot;shit&quot; in my mind so that when I was<br/>
amongst other young folks it would sound natural to<br/>
say it aloud when I stubbed my toe, or something.<br/>
