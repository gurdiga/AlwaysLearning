<div id="ygrps-yiv-1139704457">--Hi, Be sure to see the air and space museum and the museum of<br/>
natural science!  Both are great for children and adults.<br/>
Just outside of dc. is Annapolis, the capital of Maryland. There is<br/>
the military academy there that is worth a visit as well just seeing<br/>
the ships on the river.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For kids, I think the two most memorable museums at the Smithsonian  <br/>
might be American History and Air and Space.<br/>
Go up into the Washington Monument if you can.  Take things to read/ <br/>
eat/play with while you wait; there can be a line.<br/>
<br/>
If you or your kids have feelings of history or bookishness, go into  <br/>
the Library of Congress.  Just go into the reading room and sit in one  <br/>
of those desks and think for a bit about who all might have sat there  <br/>
before, and wearing what clothes of what century, and what the newest  <br/>
documents might have been through the decades.  That&#39;s one cool room.<br/>
<br/>
There are statues and art in and on the buildings all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s an FBI tour and you get to see all the tommy guns confiscated  <br/>
in the early 20th century.  TONS of them.  Looks like a Depression-era  <br/>
pawn shop for bank robbers.  The tour might be too slow and boring for  <br/>
younger kids, though.<br/>
<br/>
At American history there are things like Howdy Doody and Fonzie&#39;s  <br/>
jacket and other TV icons.   Trains.<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  Current displays, too.  Sometimes there&#39;s something out on the  <br/>
mall.  Once we saw examples of traditional wooden construction from  <br/>
lots of different countries--little buildings had been made in all  <br/>
kinds of traditions out there.   Another time there were foods and  <br/>
dances of South Africa (I forget why), and there was a display on New  <br/>
Mexico once when I was there.  Kinda odd.  And once on the Ainu, of  <br/>
Japan.    So those won&#39;t be there but something else wonderful will  <br/>
be!  (Those were in Natural HIstory maybe...  or one in there and the  <br/>
N.Mex. thing in American History?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Georgetown/ Foggy Bottom, Dupont Circle are all lovely places to <br/>
stay--nice areas.<br/>
<br/>
Depends on what ages your kids are as to what you might enjoy. The <br/>
Smithsonians are all grouped together and can be done as much or as <br/>
little as you like. American History was just reopened after <br/>
renovations, and I haven&#39;t been to see what kinds of changes they&#39;ve <br/>
made, but it never used to be a favorite. Hopefully they&#39;ve made it more <br/>
hands-on.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have always loved the Natural History museum, which is <br/>
definitely young-kid friendly. The Air and Space is great, and the annex <br/>
out at Dulles is supposed to be wonderful, so if you can fly in there it <br/>
might be a great way to get to the airport early.<br/>
<br/>
The Spy museum is supposed to be really cool, and we really like the <br/>
Museum of the American Indian, which, btw, has the best food in the <br/>
area. Their cafe is really cool, set up cafeteria style with different <br/>
areas representing the foods of different native regions.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also the Bureau of Engraving where you can see money being made, <br/>
the National Archives with the Declaration and Constitution. The <br/>
Holocaust museum is amazing, but definitely takes quite a bit of time <br/>
and I wouldn&#39;t recommend it for younger kids--I&#39;m waiting till mine are <br/>
older to go there.<br/>
<br/>
The Newseum is supposed to be pretty cool--a history of news media. I <br/>
love the Botanic Gardens, which is right across the way from the <br/>
American Indian museum and would take only a half day.<br/>
<br/>
The art museums are wonderful, and the sculpture gardens are really cool <br/>
too--a great place to bring a picnic lunch on a nice, sunny day.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the opportunity, the monuments are absolutely amazing to see <br/>
at night--an experience that you&#39;ll never forget.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me off list if you&#39;d like. I went to college in DC <br/>
and we&#39;ve lived in the area for the past 7 years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481247700">Hi Pam,<br/>
<br/>
We just spent 5 months in DC this summer while DH did a temp job w/the gov.<br/>
We went all over the place and had a blast.  Now we live here ;-)<br/>
<br/>
From that 5 month experience...<br/>
<br/>
Where to stay - There is really no access to metro from Georgetown without a<br/>
lot of walking, I think.  We stayed in Arlington, right across the river and<br/>
we liked it very much.  You may be able to stay in a furnished apartment -<br/>
they have a tons here b/c so many people come in for temp assigns.  The bldg<br/>
we are in says they will only do a month, but was willing to put my Mom up<br/>
for a few days (may be worth a call - email me privately if you are<br/>
interested.)  There may be several hotels off the Blue Line in Alexandria<br/>
too (Pentagon City and Crystal City)<br/>
<br/>
The Cherry Blossom festival is sometime in March, a two week festival, a<br/>
neat event but lots of crowds.  Not sure if Sandra was talking about<br/>
exhibits outside on the Mall or in museums, but if outside, it was probably<br/>
the Smithsonian Folklife Festival.  Another 2 week event sometime during the<br/>
summer, June maybe.  They usually celebrate the culture of one state, one<br/>
country and another theme (last year was NASA)<br/>
<br/>
Sights - Washington Monument - although going up in it is free, you will<br/>
need a ticket.  You have to get there early and stand in line to get a<br/>
ticket (which is timed).  They only give out tickets for that day. An<br/>
alternative is for a small fee, you can reserve them in advance online<br/>
(Smithsonian website). If neither works out for you an alternative is going<br/>
up into the Old Post Office Tower.  Not as high, but still a good view.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to go to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing you will need<br/>
tickets for that also.  You may be able to go through your State Congressman<br/>
or Representative to get a tour at a specific time if you don&#39;t want to<br/>
stand in line.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to tour the White House you&#39;ll need to request a tour through<br/>
your State Senator at least a month in advance - read asap since it&#39;s end of<br/>
Jan.  You can also schedule a capitol tour through your state senator.   The<br/>
Capitol conducts tours too but I think the tours conducted by the senators<br/>
offices are smaller # of people and may cover more.<br/>
<br/>
The front car on the metro is usually the least crowded.  Follow the metro<br/>
etiquette, people will yell at you - sad but true.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more that I can&#39;t think of at the moment.  Feel free to<br/>
email me off list for more info.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1846949680">I like Hotel Harrington.  It&#39;s not the best, but it&#39;s decent, <br/>
reasonable prices, nice folks, food in the hotel and around the corner <br/>
and you can walk to the mall, ford&#39;s theatre, spy museum and fbi <br/>
(although their tours have been closed forever - glad we got to go pre-<br/>
911).<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you have transportation or want to take a boat down the potomac, <br/>
check out George Washington&#39;s home - Mount Vernon.  Very cool place!  <br/>
They rebuilt his 16 sided barn.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I grew up in Maryland, complaining about yet another field trip to the <br/>
Air and Space museum. :)  Now I appreciate it through my husband&#39;s <br/>
eyes. :)<br/>
<br/>
I also agree with the suggestion to visit Gallaudet.  I walked on <br/>
protest to the capital after the students barricaded the campus when a <br/>
deaf president wasn&#39;t chosen and I worked as a phone interpreter for <br/>
the deaf which was cool.  I would talk and listen to hearing people <br/>
and type and read to deaf people to help them communicate with people <br/>
who didn&#39;t own TDD, like to a doctor, buy tickets, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Check to see if there are any plays going on.  It&#39;s pretty cool to <br/>
watch an entire play in sign language - and usually they&#39;ll have voice <br/>
interpreters for the ASL impaired. :)<br/>
<br/>
Also, there&#39;s a small visitor center at NASA&#39;s Goddard location, but <br/>
you&#39;ll need a car I think for that.<br/>

DC is awesome.  There&#39;s more to do than you can possibly do in one <br/>
visit (and remain sane).  Note that most of the Smithsonians close <br/>
early, but some may be open until late, so plan accordingly and do get <br/>
tickets first thing in the day for the Washington Monument and the <br/>
money printing place.  They may run out completely in the afternoon.  <br/>
<br/>
We way lucked out last year.  We were just bummed about missing the <br/>
Monument again (it was under construction the time before) and a tour <br/>
guide thought I looked like someone he knew, so called me over, but <br/>
then when he heard we wanted to go in, gave us a private tour. :)  <br/>
VERY nice to go up in that elevator all alone with your family and a <br/>
tour guide!  And he snuck us down to the next level that is caged <br/>
off.  You used to be able to walk up and down the monument - I did <br/>
that when I was a kid, but now they don&#39;t allow it and they have cool <br/>
Electrochromic Windows that show you the different blocks by each <br/>
state as you go down.  <br/>

<br/>
Anyway, there&#39;s tons to do in DC. :)  The most important thing is to <br/>
ENJOY!  Have fun and enjoy yourself! :)  Don&#39;t rush or push, just <br/>
stroll (or run and jump and play on the mall).  Fly a kite, throw a <br/>
ball, frisbee, etc. :)  The mall is a grassy area, not a real mall. :)<br/>
<br/>
The National Mall is a National Park.  Here&#39;s a nice link for all:<br/>

<br/>
Oh, I almost forgot - there&#39;s a new part of the air and space museum <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098518933">I wanted to add that the Air and Space Museum near Dulles is fantastic!<br/>
It&#39;s basically a hanger full of aircraft.  There is a space shuttle in<br/>
there, one of the concords, at least one of Howard Hughes planes.  There<br/>
are all sorts of old, new, and strange aircraft.  I&#39;m not big on aircraft<br/>
but I enjoyed it alot.  And I beleive you can take a free shuttle from the<br/>
Air and Space Museum at the Mall to the one at Dulles.<br/>

This reminded me of the zoo.  It&#39;s too big to see in one day, but it&#39;s  <br/>
free, and they have devised plans so that a family can see what they  <br/>
want to see by choosing one route or another and planning what to miss  <br/>
and what to visit.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1514665824">We got a book last year when we went that was about things to do with kids in DC - it was helpful.<br/>
<br/>
We went to The Capital and The Pentagon - we loved the tour of The Pentagon and The Capital.  We had to get &quot;tickets&quot; from our senator and it took several weeks to get them.  We had to go to the senators office and it was interesting to see that old building and travel through the tunnel that they use to go back and forth from their offices to the capital.  Interesting how the senior senators have different office space that the junior senators, etc.  We got our picture taken with the senator at a reception before being taken on a tour of the capital by the senator&#39;s liaison.  We had tickets to the White House but we ended up not going as our tour time was at some ungodly hour and Zac said no way ;)  During our tour of the Capital we got to sit in on a Congressional Session and see our government at work.  Since we were with a Senators office we did not go into the House of Reps side though.  We took all kinds of back stairs & hallways in and through the Capital - beautiful murals and mosaics in the floors, on the walls and the ceilings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We went to Arlington National Cemetery and watched the changing of the guard at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Other things we did and liked:  <br/>
<br/>
Smithsonian&#39;s Native American museum - we ate there twice!!!!!<br/>
Air and space museum - basically all the Smithsonian museums - we even went through the old original building<br/>
National Archive - to see the Declaration of Independence and other documents - there is a museum here also.<br/>
walked the entire mall one day - from The Capital to the Lincoln Memorial - Zac liked the WWII and Korean Memorials the best.<br/>
National Zoo - my gosh that wore us completely out as it is very hilly!!!!<br/>
we walked from our hotel out through the neighborhood to see what we could see.<br/>
we took the metro almost everywhere we went - Zac had never ridden a subway before - and it&#39;s easy and cheap.<br/>
<br/>
we walked though and got supper one evening at the train station<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m probably forgetting something as Zac & Ed did things without me because I had to attend a conference as well.<br/>
<br/>
The people there were very, very friendly - if they saw you looking at a map someone would walk up and ask if you needed help finding something.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-463629816">Thanks Sandra that&#39;s useful to us too, being new residents of the district.<br/>
<br/>
Also, just wanted to say, if visitors don&#39;t know already (I&#39;m always<br/>
surprised how many people don&#39;t know) most museums are free.  A few<br/>
exceptions are the Spy museum and the Newseum.<br/>
<br/>
as someone said earlier, there is so much to do here, and it&#39;s constantly<br/>
changing.  A suggestion pick your top 3-5 must-sees and focus on that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1940062228">Oh, right!  Lisa reminded me of food.  In one of the metro stations  <br/>
not far from the capital there&#39;s a food court with beautiful mosaic  <br/>
tile on the columns.  (Danielle or someone might be able to ID  <br/>
it.)    Great food, lots, and as usual, it seemed to me in DC, Greek  <br/>
stuff good and inexpensive all over.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the museums have cafeterias and I liked the food.  I love  <br/>
museums but I get museum sick, like I want to see and remember  <br/>
EVERYthing, but after a while it&#39;s overwhelming and I&#39;d rather see  <br/>
french fries than the Magna Carta.   I was very sad to get museum- <br/>
sick at the Britsh museum.  I think it&#39;s some function of my getting  <br/>
excited and then forgetting to breathe and of ALL the thoughts that  <br/>
go into why these things are here and whether it&#39;s good and moral and  <br/>
what a risk to have so much good stuff in one place, and I get woozy  <br/>
sometimes.   Food and air help.<br/>

train station, and the metro goes there. I think that&#39;s red line.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also L&#39;Enfant Plaza that has a food court, and that&#39;s yellow line.<br/>
<br/>
The DC metro is really wonderful. Clean, safe, easy.<br/>
<br/>
There is a red line out to Woodley Park/ Zoo, but be warned that it&#39;s a <br/>
bit of a hike from the metro to the zoo, which just adds to the walking. <br/>
The zoo is lovely, but it is a lot of walking and tiring, as someone <br/>
else pointed out, not something to do on a yucky weather day. It&#39;s also <br/>
way the heck out from everything else. Just fyi.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-795764237">Museum sick, good term, I get that too.  Union Station is the only one I can<br/>
think of also.  I love that place.  It&#39;s fun to just sit on one of the<br/>
benches and admire the architecture.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unionstationdc.com/">http://www.unionstationdc.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
There is a also a food court in the lower level of the Ronald Reagan bldg I<br/>
think the metro stop is Federal Triangle (Orange line).  And free summer<br/>
concerts M-F outside.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.itcdc.com/">http://www.itcdc.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And more food (and Ben & Jerry&#39;s) in the Old Post Office across the street<br/>
from Federal Triangle metro<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oldpostofficedc.com/">http://www.oldpostofficedc.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I like Teaism and Potbelly sandwiches at the Navy/Archives/Penn<br/>
Quarter metro stop (yellow line) across from the National Archives<br/>
relatively close to the sculpture garden (National Gallery of Art West<br/>
Bldg).<br/>
<br/>
Oh and if you go to the zoo get off at Cleveland Park and walk &quot;downhill&quot; to<br/>
the zoo entrance and then when you leave walk downhill to Woodley Park/Zoo<br/>
metro (Red Line).<br/>
<br/>
Hope I&#39;m not overwheming you.  I just did 5 months of sightseeing here over<br/>
the summer (before DH was offered perm. job) and am still reeling from the<br/>
experience ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1457439489">When I was thirteen we took a family vacation to the DC area.  <br/>
<br/>
I remember loving the Smithsonian (especially television history) and walking up the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. We also went to the National Cathedral.<br/>
<br/>
My brother was really into military things at the time and we took a tour at Annapolis.  At the time it was the highlight of my trip....all those nice looking young men....  :-)  <br/>
<br/>
I went back again with a friend when I was seventeen.  We stayed with my aunt in Virginia and took a train into DC.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There is a statue of a seated Einstein there somewhere near the mall and I have a great picture of me sitting on his lap.<br/>
<br/>
I took a bus up to the National Cathedral (love that architecture and stained glass!).  I&#39;m from a medium sized city, so taking a bus in a &quot;big city&quot; was a really neat experience for me.  I was the only anglo on the bus for most of the ride and it was a real eye-opener for me.<br/>
<br/>
I also went back to the Smithsonian to see all the art & paintings I wasn&#39;t able to see the first time.<br/>
