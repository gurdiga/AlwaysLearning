&lt;&lt;&lt;While I wish we could buy every Lego set out there, they  seem satisfied.  <br/>
They spend a lot of time talking about sets they want,  but they understand <br/>
when we can&#39;t buy  them.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

That sounds a lot like one of my (and Dave&#39;s) pastimes: &quot;When  I win the <br/>
lottery...&quot; It&#39;s fun to think of all the things one could do and buy  with <br/>
&quot;unlimited&quot; money (it&#39;s not really unlimited, but at our budget, some of  those <br/>
lottery jackpots would be like unlimited to us). Mine so often start with  <br/>
surprising people I love with things they want but can&#39;t afford or wouldn&#39;t buy  for <br/>
themselves.... Cool charity things... Businesses that I&#39;ve not seen... Kind  of <br/>
like window shopping, I guess. No expectations, just fun  imagining.<br/>
