<br/>
positions on civil liberties in the original German.&quot; -- Bill Maher, on <br/>

<br/>
President Bush is supporting Arnold but a lot of Republicans are not, <br/>
<br/>
because he is actually quite liberal. Karl Rove said if his father <br/>
<br/>
wasn&#39;t a Nazi, he wouldn&#39;t have any credibility with conservatives at <br/>
<br/>
all.&quot; Bill Maher<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
President Bush is on a 35-day vacation, and before he left he had his <br/>
<br/>
annual physical and it turns out his cholesterol now is lower than his <br/>
<br/>
approval rating.&quot; David Letterman<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yesterday, Arnold Schwarzenegger announced he would run for governor <br/>
<br/>
of California. The announcement was good news for Florida residents who <br/>
<br/>
now live in the second flakiest state in the country.&quot; Conan O&#39;Brien<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re saying Arnold will get 95% of the vote. At least according to <br/>
<br/>
his brother, Jeb Schwarzenegger.&quot; Craig Kilborn<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, we&#39;re all excited because President Bush has started his 35-day <br/>
<br/>
vacation. He&#39;s down there in Crawford, Texas and on the first day of <br/>
<br/>
his vacation he went fishing. He didn&#39;t find any fish but he believes <br/>
<br/>
they&#39;re there and that his intelligence is accurate.&quot; David Letterman<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The White House released a videotape of President Bush meeting with his <br/>
<br/>
cabinet and today Iraqi officials say they believe the tape is <br/>
<br/>
authentic.&quot; Jay Leno<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The United States is putting together a Constitution now for Iraq. Why <br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t we just give them ours? It&#39;s served us well for 200 years, and we <br/>
<br/>
don&#39;t appear to be using it anymore, so what the hell?&quot; Jay Leno<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The White House says that the vacation in Texas will give President <br/>
<br/>
Bush the chance to unwind. My question is, when does the guy wind?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
David Letterman<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;(President Bush) used his press conference to come out very strongly <br/>
<br/>
against gay marriage. And then he said on a personal note, he <br/>
<br/>
apologized if he had done anything to lead Tony Blair on.&quot; Bill Maher<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
President Bush&#39;s economic team is now on their jobs and growth bus tour <br/>
<br/>
all across America. I think the only job they created so far is for the <br/>
<br/>
guy driving the bus.&quot; Jay Leno<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
President Bush has refused to declassify portions of the congressional <br/>
<br/>
9/11 reports about the Saudis, because he says it will help the enemy:  <br/>
<br/>
Not Al Qaeda, the Democrats.&quot; Jay Leno</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436028091">Bill Maher is one of my very favorite political<br/>
comedians. His show on HBO is very smart. The kids and<br/>
I record if we are going to be gone. <br/>
