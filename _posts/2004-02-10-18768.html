Lets me *know* that unschooling is about as perfect as it gets. Can you <br/>
imagine the homelives of these families? Especially this: &quot;a child who complains <br/>
that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like a job has the &quot;opportunity&quot; to learn to like it by<br/>
doing extra duty until he stops complaining.&quot;<br/>

The Perfect Homeschooler<br/>
<br/>
by Rhonda Barfield<br/>
<br/>
Imagine: It&#39;s Monday morning, 7:00 A.M. , and your children are up,<br/>
dressed, washed, breakfasted, and sitting at the kitchen table, math<br/>
books and sharpened pencils waiting. There you are in your<br/>
embroidered apron, finishing the last of the early-morning dishes,<br/>
with a beef roast and peeled potatoes already simmering in the slow<br/>
cooker on a spotless countertop. &quot;I can sit here and help you all<br/>
the rest of the morning,&quot; you say, smiling, to your little<br/>
angels. &quot;Let&#39;s start with that math test.&quot; Cheers erupt all around<br/>
as your family begins yet another day of perfect homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever fantasized about a homeschool situation like this? If<br/>
so, you know that it only takes a few moments of daydreaming before<br/>
reality sets in. Then you&#39;re back to unswept floors, scattered toys<br/>
and clutter, a ten-foot-high pile of laundry, grumpy toddlers,<br/>
hormonal teens . . . and the list goes on. But surely, somewhere,<br/>
you think, even if it seems all wrong for you, there must be<br/>
homeschoolers who are doing this right , homeschoolers who are<br/>
perfect.<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t there?<br/>
<br/>
The answer is no.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, when I researched and wrote a book called Real-Life<br/>
Homeschooling: The Stories of 21 Families Who Teach Their Children<br/>
at Home , I never found a perfect homeschooler. True, some are<br/>
better organized or more experienced than others. Some have children<br/>
with easygoing temperaments. A few are blessed with floors that<br/>
don&#39;t show dirt. But nobody, not a single family, had reached<br/>
perfection.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds sillydoesn&#39;t it?this idea that other people are perfect. Yet<br/>
homeschoolers, in particular, seem to share a tendency to believe<br/>
that if they just work hard enough, they can produce the perfect<br/>
homeschool. We compare ourselves to others, and we often note how<br/>
much better another family &quot;has it together,&quot; rather than<br/>
understanding that they, like us, also struggle.<br/>
<br/>
I believe we need to remember four important points.<br/>
<br/>
(1) There is no perfect curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine who sells books at homeschool curriculum fairs<br/>
reports that desperate mothers often come to her for advice on<br/>
buying the &quot;right&quot; curriculum. It&#39;s hard for these women to believe<br/>
that there is no right curriculum. I thought it amusing that some of<br/>
the families in my book recommended one particular math curriculum<br/>
as one of their favorite resources, while other families found it<br/>
tedious. Is that curriculum, then, a good or bad curriculum? It all<br/>
depends on your particular family&#39;s goals, methods, learning styles,<br/>
and a dozen other considerations.<br/>
<br/>
And how does one know whether a curriculum will work or not? Most<br/>
homeschoolers I interviewed said they simply chose something, jumped<br/>
in and began using it, then made adjustments as they saw the need<br/>
arise. One family, for example, started with one and abandoned it<br/>
when they discovered their children learned better through using a<br/>
more hands-on approach. Another family tried a different one, but<br/>
found their daughter was distracted by the colorful pictures on the<br/>
pages; they returned to their former program and have been perfectly<br/>
satisfied with it.<br/>
<br/>
One interviewee, now a college student, told me he wished his well-<br/>
meaning mother had chosen one curriculum, however imperfect, and<br/>
stayed with it, rather than jumping from program to program. In<br/>
response, his mother explained that she always believed she could<br/>
solve all her problems by finding the perfect curriculum . . . and<br/>
finally had to admit that there was no such thing.<br/>
<br/>
(2) There is no perfect method of teaching.<br/>
<br/>
I interviewed families who use a variety of teaching methods, such<br/>
as traditional textbooks, unit studies, the Charlotte Mason method,<br/>
and the classical approach. One woman utilizes a video school. Other<br/>
families &quot;unschool,&quot; encouraging their children to lead and<br/>
structure their own learning goals, with parents acting primarily as<br/>
resources rather than teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, many of the families I profiled started out &quot;rigid&quot;<br/>
and &quot;school-like,&quot; as they described themselves and then relaxed<br/>
considerably through the years. Those using textbooks, for example,<br/>
often supplemented with other books and activities and sometimes<br/>
made a break with the program to discover other areas of interest.<br/>
<br/>
Others found they needed more structure as their children grew.<br/>
Susie, one of the parents I interviewed who formerly used an<br/>
eclectic, casual approach to homeschooling, wrote, &quot;We completely<br/>
switched gears and started using (a program that was organized for<br/>
us), a big change but a major relief. I couldn&#39;t keep up with<br/>
schooling and was getting very concerned about it.&quot; Susie says the<br/>
family had &quot;no trouble at all switching from a very loose approach<br/>
to a complete curriculum.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(3) There is no perfectly clean house, especially when homeschoolers<br/>
live there.<br/>
<br/>
One of my interviewees, Janice, observed that our houses are<br/>
naturally messy because so many of us live and interact there all<br/>
day as well as all night. Families who work, school, and play away<br/>
from home should find it much easier to keep their places clean and<br/>
tidy.<br/>
<br/>
Several mothers I interviewed have elaborate chore systems and<br/>
charts in place. Others (usually those with smaller families)<br/>
simply &quot;pick the kid who happens to be in the room at the time,&quot; as<br/>
Lynda said, &quot;and he&#39;s the one who gets to do the job.&quot; In Bobby and<br/>
Nina&#39;s family of eleven children, a child who complains that he<br/>
doesn&#39;t like a job has the &quot;opportunity&quot; to learn to like it by<br/>
doing extra duty until he stops complaining.<br/>
<br/>
Still, as Angie lamented, &quot;My house is always messy, even though the<br/>
children do have chores.&quot; One interviewee&#39;s husband often reminds<br/>
his wife that &quot;the house will be clean some day . . . after the kids<br/>
have all left home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
(4) There is no perfect family.<br/>
<br/>
Some families do get up earlier than yours. Some may actually have<br/>
dinner in the slow cooker by 9:00 A.M. And there really are some<br/>
days when a few homeschool moms have time to sit down with their<br/>
kids all morning, helping with assignments. This doesn&#39;t mean the<br/>
families are perfect or even better than yours.<br/>
<br/>
As I wrote about twenty-one families&#39; lives, I found it difficult to<br/>
convey that each had struggles. Describing the good stuff was easy;<br/>
in fact, when these homeschoolers&#39; accomplishments were listed on<br/>
paper, the lists were truly impressive. It was much harder to convey<br/>
the frustrations, irritations, and occasional deep disappointments<br/>
of daily living.<br/>
<br/>
How does one fully describe, for example, the effects of sleep<br/>
deprivation caused by a colicky newborn? The tiresomeness of dealing<br/>
with a child with ADHD? The feelings of vulnerability that come in<br/>
the midst of a financial crisis? When the inevitable pressures of<br/>
life are added to two full-time commitmentsparenting and<br/>
homeschoolingit&#39;s no wonder that we sometimes &quot;lose it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I had to laugh when Susie described a time when she was pregnant<br/>
with her fourth child: &quot;I was so tired and sick and grouchy, I found<br/>
I was overreacting to everything,&quot; she says. &quot;A child would spell a<br/>
word wrong and I&#39;d cry, feeling that he&#39;d never learn.&quot; I can<br/>
remember going through times like that, and worse.<br/>
<br/>
Last year I got a Christmas letter from a friend, a homeschool<br/>
mother of five, who now lives in another state. It was quite an<br/>
impressive letter. Fran&#39;s children are active in Scouts, substitute<br/>
teaching, babysitting, camping, backpacking, family trips, canoeing,<br/>
summer camps, and of course, homeschooling. As I finished reading<br/>
the letter, I couldn&#39;t help but compare my own homeschool with that<br/>
of this supermom&#39;s. I wondered how she did it all. I also<br/>
questioned, a little, whether I was doing enough.<br/>
<br/>
Then I received a letter from Fran in response to our family&#39;s<br/>
Christmas letter. &quot;I get dizzy reading all you&#39;ve done,&quot; she said.<br/>
Ironically, that had been my reaction, exactly, to her letter. How<br/>
tempting to compare ourselves to other homeschoolers, the ones who<br/>
have perfect curricula, teaching methods, families, and clean<br/>
houses!<br/>
<br/>
But again, perfect people don&#39;t exist. God has a way of reminding us<br/>
that we are, after all, fallen creatures. Not perfect, but real.<br/>
