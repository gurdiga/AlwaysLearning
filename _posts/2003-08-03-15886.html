<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952217400">Just for fun, here&#39;s what my son figured out today.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re visiting my in-laws, who have lots of books.  We have lots of books,<br/>
too, but this house is much bigger than my apartment, and pretty much<br/>
wallpapered in books.  Tim wanted to know how many books they have.<br/>
<br/>
He decided he&#39;d never count all the books, so he counted all the bookshelves<br/>
in the house instead; he found 28.  Then, at my suggestion, he picked out a<br/>
moderate sized bookshelf, and counted all the books.  150 books.  Then I<br/>
showed him how to multiply it out on paper (we couldn&#39;t find a calculator<br/>
right then).  It came to 4,208 books.<br/>
<br/>
We concluded that 4,000+ books is probably fair; some of the bookshelves are<br/>
smaller, but there are piles of books all over this place that aren&#39;t on<br/>
bookshelves, so they didn&#39;t get counted.<br/>
<br/>
4,000 books.  I feel much better about my book buying habit!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, *I* have 7 full bookshelves, plus books on most other flat surfaces<br/>
around my house.  We&#39;re at my in-laws right now.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t be too jealous; while I enjoy the mysteries that my MIL reads, and Tim<br/>
has had fun searching for his father&#39;s old children&#39;s books, most of the<br/>
books around here are either really, really old (and dusty!) or about math.<br/>
(FIL is a retired math professor.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the sheer quantity of books that amazes us, not their value to us<br/>
personally.  I think my in-laws like them, though!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-508220888">I just love books.  I buy old books just because they are old sometimes, not always because of the content.  I didn&#39;t have much room in my old house, but we just moved here and I have a whole room that I am planning on turning into a library.  Of course, right now it only has one bookcase, one writing desk and the computer in it, but my goal is to have a whole wall of bookcases that I can fill up.  My grandfather was a teacher, too, so I think that is where I get my love of books from.<br/>
