<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489133527">Today my 10 yo dd asked if I could come up with a punishment to help her<br/>
stop twitching her nose.  I told her there are no more punishments.  She was<br/>
shocked and said &quot;You mean we won&#39;t be punished for anything any more?&quot;  I<br/>
said &quot;no more punishments&quot;.  She asked me if it was hard not telling us what<br/>
to do any more.  I told her it felt different but I liked it.  I told her I<br/>
would still remind her of things once in a while and she said &quot;Good because<br/>
I probably would never do anything if you didn&#39;t&quot;.  I told her that she will<br/>
be surprised at how much she will want to do now that she is not being told<br/>
what to do.  A few minutes later she told me about the plan she had to stop<br/>
her nose twitching.   This is the way life should be!<br/>

<br/>
There are ways to help without punishment.  You could just say &quot;twitch!&quot; <br/>
without even looking at her. &lt;g&gt;  And make it fun and funny and hug-filled.<br/>
