<div id="ygrps-yiv-1191600723">Hi!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been soaking up your amazing parenting discussions for over a year now, and I can&#39;t even begin to thank you for all the thoughtful time and effort so many of you put in here.  You are making more difference than you could possibly know!<br/>
<br/>
Now about blogs....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard you (Sandra) recommend blogging to unschoolers several times, and I&#39;m starting to think about how to do it.  I don&#39;t currently have a blog or anything like it, so I&#39;ll be starting from scratch.  My son will turn five this spring, and we technically don&#39;t have to notify for over a year, but I&#39;d like to start a blog soon to get comfortable with what I&#39;m doing ahead of time.  <br/>
<br/>
These are some of the questions I&#39;m wondering how you would answer:<br/>
<br/>
Who do you consider your audience for the blog?  <br/>
<br/>
Would you make the blog a display of some &quot;snapshots&quot; of time once or twice per week or whenever we do something particularly interesting/photo worthy, OR would you use the blog as a nearly complete portfolio? (&quot;180 days per year&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
And, what other sorts of documentation would you keep in addition to the blog?<br/>
<br/>
Would you have lots of narrative essays and photos?  Or would you jot &#39;what we did today&#39; notes on the blog each day as you would for an attendance/&#39;lesson plan&#39; sort of notebook?<br/>
<br/>
Would it be best to keep the blog solely for my son&#39;s &quot;school stuff&quot;, or would it be appropriate to have more of a family blog?  (We also have a 17 month old daughter.)<br/>
<br/>
Would you give a link to the blog to the school district in the notification letter, (so they could check in any time)? Or would you send a link to them at the end of the year as a portfolio? Or would you just print it all out and put it in a binder?  Keep it for yourself just in case they ask, but don&#39;t offer it to them directly?  Locally, I&#39;ve heard other homeschoolers stress the importance of not giving the district &#39;more than what&#39;s required&#39;.  How does a blog fit in to that?<br/>
<br/>
If the audience is mainly the school district, would it be best not to include philosophical comments/discussion/links?<br/>
<br/>
Is there anything else you would be sure to include or be sure to exclude that may not be obvious?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for your time.  I really value your opinions and will appreciate your input.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-794360732">-=-I&#39;ve heard you (Sandra) recommend blogging to unschoolers several times, and I&#39;m starting to think about how to do it. I don&#39;t currently have a blog or anything like it, so I&#39;ll be starting from scratch. My son will turn five this spring, and we technically don&#39;t have to notify for over a year, but I&#39;d like to start a blog soon to get comfortable with what I&#39;m doing ahead of time. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think they help LOTS of ways.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think they should be &quot;submitted to the state&quot; as documentation, but that they can be used by the mom as a record from which to summarize (IF necessary) for the state/province/district.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Who do you consider your audience for the blog? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, for me, other unschoolers, friends and relatives.<br/>
That&#39;s what I was thinking when I did blog posts.  (Still do, though my kids are &quot;past school age.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would you make the blog a display of some &quot;snapshots&quot; of time once or twice per week or whenever we do something particularly interesting/photo worthy, OR would you use the blog as a nearly complete portfolio? (&quot;180 days per year&quot;)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Not &quot;180 days per year.&quot;  No &quot;portfolio&quot; in the world is required to document 180 days.  Even a teacher&#39;s record book or lesson plans book has some fallow days out of the 180.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And, what other sorts of documentation would you keep in addition to the blog?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Me, in New Mexico, none.<br/>
If you live where some sort of &quot;documentation&quot; is required, that question should be take up with unschoolers in your area.  This list isn&#39;t a good place to discuss the particulars of local requirements.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would you have lots of narrative essays and photos? Or would you jot &#39;what we did today&#39; notes on the blog each day as you would for an attendance/&#39;lesson plan&#39; sort of notebook?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I would mix it up as you feel the need.  Part of deschooling is moving away from thinking of things as lesson plans and notebooks, and moving toward an organic, flowing life without school divisions and terminology.   Blogs don&#39;t care whether you post on a weekday or &quot;school day.&quot;  Stop thinking of school days.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would it be best to keep the blog solely for my son&#39;s &quot;school stuff&quot;, or would it be appropriate to have more of a family blog? (We also have a 17 month old daughter.)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Your son will learn within and among his family, until he&#39;s older and starts learning from people you haven&#39;t even met yet.  How can you separate his learning from your family?  Don&#39;t try.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would you give a link to the blog to the school district in the notification letter, (so they could check in any time)? Or would you send a link to them at the end of the year as a portfolio? Or would you just print it all out and put it in a binder?-=-<br/>
<br/>
None of the above.  <br/>
Blogger or Word Press or whatever will keep it just fine.<br/>
I recommend against keeping a blog on a NING site, because those can be deleted in an instant by the owner.  Find a more permanent place.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is there anything else you would be sure to include or be sure to exclude that may not be obvious?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think rude or illegal things should be included, but I also don&#39;t think rude or illegal things should be a part of normal unschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If the audience is mainly the school district, would it be best not to include philosophical comments/discussion/links?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yuck, on &quot;the audience mainly the school district&quot; idea.  Do not think of yourself as living for or performing for &#39;the school district.&#39;  People who say you should only give them the bare-bones minimum required by law are right.  Take this part of your questioning to a local unschooling list.  Check here if you don&#39;t already know of one.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/world">http://sandradodd.com/world</a><br/>
If there isn&#39;t one listed there, try google (and if you find a good one not listed on my page, please let me know).<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; Who do you consider your audience for the blog? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s something to decide first, since it will define a good deal of the content and tone. I have a &quot;family blog&quot; that I don&#39;t really keep up now that the rest of the family is on facebook, but it was useful to post photos of the kids and write about what they&#39;re doing along with chit chat about friends and garden. I wouldn&#39;t necessarily use that as some kind of &quot;portfolio&quot; but I could use it as a reference if I needed one. Mainly, it gave the grandparents conversation starters when we&#39;d visit, so they weren&#39;t stuck trying to ask &quot;what are you learning about in homeschooling?&quot; and getting blank looks from the kids. <br/>
<br/>
For a time I kept a blog that was just about Ray, with a stated target audience of his bio mom and Her extended family, and the umbrella school through which he&#39;s registered. I&#39;d post copies of the &quot;Learning Plan&quot; and about once a month find ways to tie in whatever Ray was doing to the &quot;plan&quot; which helped his bio mom and her parents be comfortable with the idea of &quot;unschooling&quot; - that can be important if you&#39;re trying ot unschool with a divorce in the mix as the other parent has rights and obligations wrt &quot;education&quot;. She&#39;s since grown comfortable enough with the academic side of unschooling to take over the &quot;reporting&quot;, even though Ray lives with me. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660974088">----Who do you consider your audience for the blog?-----<br/>
<br/>
Initially, just our extended family and friends, although I also started ours as a dry-run for having to document for the state. Noor, my daughter, really enjoys going through and looking at it too. She even has her own posts that she asks to put up.<br/>
<br/>
Our blog is &quot;tagged&quot; (categorized) by state-required subject, simply because I wanted to prove to myself that our life really does encompass everything the state requires...this will make it easier to pull from at the end of the year too. <br/>
<br/>
I would NOT turn the blog address over to the school district as a portfolio--way too much information--although I will cull from the blog and copy posts onto a CD for that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
----Would you make the blog a display of some &quot;snapshots&quot; of time once or twice per<br/>
week or whenever we do something particularly interesting/photo worthy, OR would<br/>
you use the blog as a nearly complete portfolio? (&quot;180 days per year&quot;)------<br/>
<br/>
I try to post at least twice a week, or whenever something interesting happens AND I have a camera handy.  Now that I have a cell phone with a camera, that is easier. <br/>
<br/>
----And, what other sorts of documentation would you keep in addition to the blog?----<br/>
<br/>
Like Sandra said, that is totally state/country specific.  In general, keep art work (which can be tied into ALL kinds of things), bits of writing/dictation (if there is any), photographs, museum/zoo/event brochures, a book/movie/game/website bibliography (required in some places), recipes=math.....<br/>
If you&#39;re in PA, email me off-list.<br/>
<br/>
----Would you have lots of narrative essays and photos? Or would you jot &#39;what we<br/>
did today&#39; notes on the blog each day as you would for an attendance/&#39;lesson<br/>
plan&#39; sort of notebook?-----<br/>
<br/>
Mine is mostly photos, very few words, some snippets of conversation. I also link to webpages we looked at/learned from.<br/>
<br/>
-----Would it be best to keep the blog solely for my son&#39;s &quot;school stuff&quot;, or would<br/>
it be appropriate to have more of a family blog? (We also have a 17 month old<br/>
daughter.)------<br/>
<br/>
That is completely up to you!  Even if you need to roll it out for some off-the-wall legal action, it won&#39;t hurt any if your daughter&#39;s experiences are there too.<br/>
<br/>
------Would you give a link to the blog to the school district in the notification<br/>
letter, (so they could check in any time)? Or would you send a link to them at<br/>
the end of the year as a portfolio? Or would you just print it all out and put<br/>
it in a binder?--------<br/>
<br/>
NO, NO, NO. The most you need, even in the most stringent places, are a dozen sheets/examples per subject.<br/>
<br/>
---- Keep it for yourself just in case they ask, but don&#39;t offer it<br/>
to them directly? -----<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
-----Locally, I&#39;ve heard other homeschoolers stress the importance<br/>
of not giving the district &#39;more than what&#39;s required&#39;. How does a blog fit in<br/>
to that?------<br/>
<br/>
Why should the school district get to watch over your daily-life? In essence, that is what a blog is--snapshots of your life--letting the school district feel they have the right to oversee that is a step in a dangerous direction.  I also think it will influence your unschooling if you feel like they&#39;re watching you.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the blog I keep for my 7yr old daughter (I haven&#39;t updated the biography in ages):<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1066484461">Documentation as in proof?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re asking about state/province requirements, besides Google and<br/>
Sandra&#39;s website link, try Yahoo groups search or A to Z home&#39;s cool:<br/>

<br/>
If you are asking about unschooling, documentation is neat but not<br/>
necessary. I don&#39;t use my blog to record much about learning that I<br/>
notice. I use a brainstorming program that links words visually and<br/>
jogs my memory. Even that isn&#39;t necessary for unschooling. But it&#39;s<br/>
cool to see.<br/>
<br/>
On my blog, I share things for other unschoolers mainly and hope to<br/>
get back into that soon.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709824286">I started my blog mainly as a way to help others who are interested in<br/>
unschooling, however it also includes enough daily snippets of our life that<br/>
it will help me with compiling a portfolio if I ever need one.<br/>
<br/>
It also serves as a way to share with distant family members what we&#39;re<br/>
doing, and what thought processes go into our decision to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also a way for me to practice writing and get into the habit of writing<br/>
daily.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t use it as the sole method of compiling things for a portfolio and<br/>
honestly I&#39;ve found it better (if possible in the state you&#39;re living in) to<br/>
find a way to legally homeschool without reporting to the district.  In many<br/>
states you can report to an &quot;umbrella school&quot; which removes the need to<br/>
report to the state.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303408812">-=-Who do you consider your audience for the blog? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Primarily, relatives and friends, but anyone that thinks it is interesting is welcome to read. I mostly write as I would when keeping a journal or a baby book.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would you make the blog a display of some &quot;snapshots&quot; of time once or twice per week or whenever we do something particularly interesting/photo worthy, OR would you use the blog as a nearly complete portfolio? (&quot;180 days per year&quot;)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Learning never stops, so I don&#39;t think in terms of 180 days. I post monthly summaries with photos. I also post special pictures around holidays, birthdays or adventures. We have quite a few posts about our garden and the wild animals that visit our backyard.<br/>
<br/>
I keep a quarterly list of books we&#39;ve read or used on the blog as well, and sometimes I scan artwork or writing samples. To me, our blog is a digital scrapbook.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-And, what other sorts of documentation would you keep in addition to the blog?-=-<br/>
<br/>
What would you keep if you were making a scrapbook for your son? I keep artwork and writing samples, ticket stubs, trail maps, museum brochures...Since we live in a state with mandatory annual assessments, I also keep random stuff that seems schooly including completed sudoku puzzles and word searches. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

When your daughter reaches school age, will you want to keep two blogs?<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;Who do you consider your audience for the blog?  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m fairly new to blogging, but when I started my blog it was with the intention to share what unschooling looks like for my family.  The audience I had in mind was mainly friends and family, but I&#39;ve also found online blogging friends that I enjoy keeping up with.  <br/>
<br/>
If I ever needed to document our homeschooling activities I would use this blog as a reminder of what we do naturally, and later translate what we have been doing into &quot;schoolish language&quot;, but NOT on my blog.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;Would it be best to keep the blog solely for my son&#39;s &quot;school stuff&quot;, or would it be appropriate to have more of a family blog?  (We also have a 17 month old daughter.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a radical unschooler, I find that my blog encompasses the whole family&#39;s activities.  I share my own art or crafting projects as well as my children&#39;s and our activities are never separated as to what is educational or what is &quot;just for fun&quot;, because I don&#39;t generally make those distinctions.  It does lean towards what is more photograph-able, or what is unique or funny or intriguing (to me, at the time).<br/>
<br/>
I also noticed that in the groups Database section there is a table for members&#39; blogs.  There are only three entries, but I think I&#39;ll also add my blog info there, and I would enjoy checking out blogs from other unschoolers who are part of this group list, if anyone else wants to add their blog.<br/>

I have different lists on different pages. :-)<br/>
And I hardly ever go through them without finding someone hasn&#39;t blogged for a long time, or a blog has moved. <br/>
<br/>
But the cool thing about lists like those is that you can go to a blog, and to another blog from that one.<br/>
<br/>
None of my lists are my perfect set.  There are some others linked from here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com">http://thinkingsticks.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
Mine&#39;s not so much &quot;about unschooling&quot; now that my kids are grown, but it&#39;s still sometimes about what the kids are doing.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>
That goes back to 2005, and sometimes it&#39;s just fun (even for me, or especially for me) to poke around in there.  I&#39;ve found dates and names from things someone asked about by checking the blog, too.  The search on the upper left works pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
This is a blog about my unschooling site, with additions and announcements:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620464853">Thanks for all the helpful responses. It&#39;s especially a relief to know that the school district would not at all be the targeted audience!  But using the blog as a place to store information, SOME of which later may be compiled into a portfolio for &quot;documentation&quot; purposes makes sense.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the links to other blogs.  I&#39;ve seen a few of those, and will enjoy looking at more for inspiration.  <br/>
<br/>
Brie-- I had recently looked at your blog after you posted a link to it here, and I think it&#39;s a great example.  That&#39;s what I have in mind, and what sparked my questions. ;)  I appreciate you sharing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Hearing the word &quot;scrapbook&quot; to describe an unschooling blog seemed to really help me.  I know what a scrapbook is, and its purpose, uses, audience, etc.  I was hung up on thinking of it mainly as a method of collecting info to use for reporting or creating a formal portfolio, with availability to extended family being a side benefit rather than primary.  You are right, we don&#39;t need a whole blog-worth of info for the district (in Ohio).  And yes, we do have local resources for specific questions about what&#39;s needed.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!!! <br/>
