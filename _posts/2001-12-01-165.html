&lt;&lt;  I&#39;ve been <br/>
 lurking and reading your discussions for about a week now and I&#39;m LOVING it. <br/>
 The math discussion has brought up ideas I haven&#39;t even begun to explore <br/>
 yet. I was always great at school math, but never great at connecting it to <br/>
 the real world. I&#39;m sure all of your brilliant questions and ideas will be <br/>
 percolating in my brain for a long time. &gt;&gt;<br/>

Hi!<br/>
  I&#39;m new here, too, though I lurk on several unschooling lists. My name is <br/>
Amy, I have a 4yo son and a 2yo dd. I love to learn about the unschooling <br/>
philosophy.<br/>
  I&#39;m interested in the discussion of math, too. I got good grades in school <br/>
in all subjects, though I hated math and particularly hated algebra. As an <br/>
adult, I&#39;m finding it interesting and have been printing algebra worksheets <br/>
from the computer for myself! Now these equations seem more like puzzles to <br/>
be solved!! <br/>
