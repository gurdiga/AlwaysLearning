<div id="ygrps-yiv-772000895">Hey Kelly...I just wrote a post to my local hsing group about our<br/>
experience in testing...maybe it will help get the juices going.<br/>
<br/>
The main problems that I had with our testing was that it caused us<br/>
(including Jason!) to focus on what Jason did not know. DH wanted to<br/>
know why his math score wasn&#39;t higher (and pretty much ignored his high<br/>
english score). I had a minor bit of panic when I first saw the math<br/>
part of the test (I got over it though). But worst was that after<br/>
finishing the math portion Jason uttered words he has never said before<br/>
&quot;I hate math&quot;. Luckily we don&#39;t &quot;do&quot; math, so it is not an issue, but it<br/>
seemed sad to me and I was thankful that this is just a once a year hoop<br/>
we jump through (Virginia requires either testing or a portfolio review,<br/>
but the portfolios at becoming more and more tied to the Va &quot;Standards<br/>
of Learning&quot; (SOLs - yes I kid you not) so we choose the test).<br/>
<br/>
The tests totally ignored all the other cool stuff that Jason does<br/>
know...his concepts of physics (momentum, friction etc), his love of<br/>
doing experiments, his incredible knowledge of ancient egypt, his great<br/>
problem solving abilities on his pokemon game, his curiosity, his<br/>
wonderful ability to recall just about anything about any character from<br/>
the Redwall books, well I guess that I could go on. <br/>
<br/>
Oh another problem with tests is that people put too much emphasis on<br/>
them...I know that if my family finds out that we tested, they will use<br/>
the test score to determine whether homeschool is &quot;working&quot;. Which is<br/>
why we had Jason take the test in January, so that we could always say<br/>
that the test was not a true reflection of his ability since it was<br/>
taken 6 months before the end of the &quot;school year&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Oh, since I know that not everyone is up on the testing jargon...8th<br/>
stanine is &quot;above average&quot; (90th percentile meaning that he scored as<br/>
good or better then 90% of the kids who took the test) and 5th stanine<br/>
is &quot;average&quot; (50 percentile).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if any of this will help...I would love to see what you wrote<br/>
when you are done!<br/>

Subject: [VaEclec] Our experience with testing<br/>
<br/>
With Jason being in first grade this year, this was the first year that<br/>
we had to provide proof of progress..I posted a couple of months ago<br/>
with a  bit of panic when I got a copy of the CAT test, mainly because I<br/>
was worried about the math section. We unschool and do not &quot;do<br/>
math&quot;...no drill, no workbooks. We use math a lot and play lots of games<br/>
with math and talk about math concepts. But still I was a bit worried<br/>
about the 2-digit addition and a couple of other problems with which he<br/>
had not much experience. I decided to just give it to him without any<br/>
real prep (I have been really enjoying watching as Jason gets new<br/>
concepts on his own and did not want &quot;mess up&quot; his natural progression).<br/>
<br/>
We spread out the test over a week or so, working as long as Jason<br/>
wanted and then forgetting about it for a couple of days. Very relaxed,<br/>
on the couch. We started with language arts and as expected, Jason had<br/>
no problem answering the questions...I already knew that he has a great<br/>
vocab, wonderful comprehension and even though we did no formal grammar,<br/>
he had no problem picking correct tenses or changing declarative<br/>
sentences into questions. We moved on to the math section...this did not<br/>
come as easily to Jason...he had to think a bit more. But it was<br/>
actually pretty neat to watch him reason his way through. He seemed to<br/>
look at it as a big puzzle. First he would look at the problem, then he<br/>
would look at the answers and say &quot;this one is ridiculous...this one is<br/>
ridiculous&quot;. Then he would look at the problem and see which answer made<br/>
the most sense. It was pretty neat to watch actually. Some he was only<br/>
off by 1 and some that I thought he would have trouble with he got no<br/>
problem! His approach was extremely logical and pretty remarkable to me<br/>
considering he has never taken a test before. :o) The other thing that I<br/>
found interesting was that after he was finished he uttered words that I<br/>
have *never* heard him say before: &quot;I hate math&quot;. It surprised me and<br/>
made me kind of sad. I guess that it is a good thing that we don&#39;t &quot;do<br/>
math&quot;! LOL!<br/>
<br/>
We got the results back very quickly. He scored in the 8th stanine in<br/>
language arts and 5th in math. One interesting thing is that DH<br/>
immediately focused on the math score, wondering why it wasn&#39;t higher<br/>
(dh is supportive of hsing, but not as convinced about unschooling). I<br/>
quickly reminded him that he does absolutely *no* drill and he took the<br/>
test 6 months early and he still did as good or better then 50% of the<br/>
kids taking the test. I also wanted to know why he was only focusing on<br/>
the lower score and why he thought that Jason had to do above average on<br/>
everything.<br/>
<br/>
So what did I learn about testing? Well, I learned that tests really do<br/>
not tell me anything that I did not already know about Jason...well, not<br/>
exactly, I did learn that Jason is a better,  more logical test taker<br/>
then I thought LOL! I also learned that tests can make you focus on what<br/>
kids *don&#39;t* know rather then on what they do. I also learned that it is<br/>
better to just relax about it and not make a big deal over it (we did<br/>
not tell Jason his score and he has not asked). All in all it was not a<br/>
terrible experience...I would prefer not to have to do it, but it is<br/>
worth it to be able to continue to hs. I *am* glad that it is over and<br/>
we can go back to our happy little lives free of testing for another<br/>
year.<br/>
