<div id="ygrps-yiv-141854595">My kids are still fairly young: 7,5, and 2.<br/>
<br/>
I did a *LOT* of walking when I only had one of two.<br/>
In the spring and fall I would walk about three times<br/>
a week, to the library, to Target, once to the post<br/>
office. (They are about 3 miles round trips.)<br/>
<br/>
We try to &quot;shake it up&quot; where we go. There are about<br/>
5-6 different parks we might go to. Maybe the mall or<br/>
a McDonald&#39;s play place when the weather&#39;s bad. <br/>
<br/>
I was involved in a local chapter of MOMS Club, which<br/>
is an international organization, for a few years, and<br/>
that helped.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that helped (and still helps) is we have<br/>
afternoon naptime/roomtime. It lets me rest and clear<br/>
my head, and helps the kids unwind too.<br/>
