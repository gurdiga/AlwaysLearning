  I wouldn&#39;t go to a pediatrician for this kind of thing --- I&#39;d go to an <br/>
educational psychologist, most likely. I&#39;d find one that actively promotes <br/>
attachment parenting and does not work FOR a school district as a &quot;child <br/>
labeler.&quot;  It is possible -- call your local La Leche League contact and <br/>
see if they have anyone they can recommend -- contact local homeschooling <br/>
organizations and see if they have anybody - just keep checking until you <br/>
find someone you think will be helpful.<br/>
<br/>
I know a couple of people I&#39;d recommend here in Southern California.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I wouldn&#39;t bring this kind of issue even to my favorite <br/>
pediatricians - they are SO medically-minded, that is their training and <br/>
that is the lens they see through. I&#39;d get other input first and only go to <br/>
a pediatrician if I had good reason.<br/>
