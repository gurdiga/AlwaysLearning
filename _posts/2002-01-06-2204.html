<div id="ygrps-yiv-761925724"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Now here&#39;s the rub, he shaved his LEGS!! Yep, right down to the smooth skin. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; YUCKO. I can&#39;t stand it. He did it to see what those &quot;real&quot; <br/>
&gt; biker/triathlete <br/>
&gt; types go through. He says it feels better because your bike tights don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; pull <br/>
&gt; on the hairs, I guess it&#39;s annoying. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and son do too. I don&#39;t mind the JUST shaved legs, but by the next <br/>
day---they&#39;re awful! It takes him 15-20 minutes longer to shave his legs; <br/>
he&#39;s extra careful to get every one! He can spot a REAL biker by whether he <br/>
shaves his legs---the others are just &quot;playing&quot; at biking!<br/>
<br/>
My boys don&#39;t shave for the hair-pulling, but for the gigantic strawberries <br/>
that they get mountain-biking! If there&#39;s no hair, it&#39;s not as goopy and <br/>
sticky while it&#39;s healing. <br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t fall as much now and have even slowed down in the winter months as <br/>
it&#39;s dark so early.  I&#39;ve noticed they&#39;re both letting the leg hair grow back <br/>
for January (Robert Burns&#39; birthday is right around the corner---can&#39;t wear <br/>
the kilt with shaved legs---now, THAT&#39;S YUCKO!).<br/>

He doesn&#39;t shave the third leg area, does he? <br/>
<br/>
In high school, my little brother, then a wrestler,<br/>
said some of the boys would not bathe for a week or so<br/>
and would shave all of their body hair, then let it<br/>
during stink week, just before a match. this<br/>
supposedly would give them an advantage. No one wanted<br/>
to do any grasps or holds on such offensive persons.<br/>
<br/>
Competitive swimmers shave body hair to reduce<br/>
friction.<br/>
<br/>
Unrelated:  Is it the Sufi who shave their body hair?<br/>
