<div id="ygrps-yiv-2103715396">Is the Carolina Coliseum and Koger Center for the Arts, which is across <br/>
the street from the Holiday Inn, where the conference will be held? <br/>
 Just checking.  I&#39;m about to register and get the hotel room.  My <br/>
mother is coming with me and the girls and we&#39;re going to spend the week <br/>
before the conference on the coast between Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head. <br/>
 Anyone want to meet up with us at Brookgreen Gardens?  It&#39;s one of my <br/>
most favorite places in the whole world and I can&#39;t wait to show the girls!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1080299724">New conference questions...once I pay the initial registration fee, will <br/>
there be other costs to do things at the conference (obviously not hotel <br/>
stuff)?  I see there&#39;s the boxed supper option that&#39;s extra.  Also, the <br/>
schedule online lists all these wonderful speeches that I want to <br/>
hear...but what about the kids?  I understand there will be activities <br/>
etc. planned.  Are these at the same time as the scheduled speakers? Is <br/>
there a schedule yet of any of the known kids activities...or a list <br/>
that&#39;s started?  Will any of the craft activities cost money?  I just <br/>
want to know how much I need to be saving up the next couple of months. <br/>
 Thanks,  HeidiC.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not really. You&#39;ll have to buy your food, of course.<br/>
<br/>
There will be a few exhibitors. They&#39;ll want your money. Please be sure to <br/>
patronize them---they help us BE here! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m willing to bet that if you don&#39;t have a Jim Weiss CD yet, you WILL want <br/>
one!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;ll be tapes from last year---and Sandra will certainly bring some of <br/>
her old ones.<br/>
<br/>
SOS will have a few books and bumper stickers for sale.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re trying to have all the funshops free. They were last year. The Chain <br/>
Mail and Jewelry funshops *might* have an extra expense. I hope not. We&#39;re <br/>
working on that! Some funshops ask that you bring some things from home (The <br/>
&quot;Wings&quot; funshops asks that you bring two pairs of tights).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a raffle---bring LOTS of money for THAT! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;I see there&#39;s the boxed supper option that&#39;s extra. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Optional. <br/>
<br/>
 Also, the &gt; schedule online lists all these wonderful speeches that I want <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to <br/>
&gt; hear...but what about the kids?  I understand there will be activities <br/>
&gt; etc. planned.  Are these at the same time as the scheduled speakers? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes. The kids should be quite occupied while you&#39;re listening. You might find <br/>
yourself in the funshop room too, though!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Is &gt; there a schedule yet of any of the known kids activities...or a list <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that&#39;s started?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They&#39;re coming in slowly. I&#39;m waiting for contracts and to firm things up. <br/>
Some folks are slower than others. Keep checking the site. They&#39;ll be popping up <br/>
regularly now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Will any of the craft activities cost money? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll say no.<br/>
<br/>
 I just &gt; want to know how much I need to be saving up the next couple of <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; months. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Lots and lots. For the exhibitors! And the raffle.<br/>
<br/>
Things should be pretty well paid for by the time you send in your $$$.<br/>
