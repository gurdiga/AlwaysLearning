<div id="ygrps-yiv-1801769052">We are brand new to unschooling and definitely still in the de-schooling phase (well, at least I am anyway). The other day I over heard my son talking with one of his schooled friends. The boy was trying to wrap his head around unschooling and asked &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t do math or writing or science [altogether now] what DO you do?!&quot; Without missing a beat my son said &quot;Three dimensional art.&quot; The freind looked at him wide eyed and then said &quot;Cool!&quot;, paused and then said &quot;What&#39;s that?&quot; My son smiled widely and answered &quot;LEGO.&quot;</div>
