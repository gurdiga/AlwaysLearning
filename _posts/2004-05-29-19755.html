I missed the middle part of this subject line.  I dropped it a while back, <br/>
did catch this phrase on someone else&#39;s post though.  We have two boys that <br/>
sleep with us, 9 and 7.  It seems very natural to us. We have always had a family <br/>
bed. <br/>
<br/>
 I first heard of the family bed when I was a nurse in the army.  I hadn&#39;t <br/>
even met Jackson then.  But a nurse, she was from the Philippines, she said they <br/>
had always had a family bed and even now, well then, her boys were 16 and 17 <br/>
and when they were stressed or needed comforting, they would crawl in bed with <br/>
the parents and sleep there for the night.  It was very comforting to them.  <br/>
And she loved the closeness they share as a family.  <br/>

We went to see &quot;Man on Fire&quot; last night.  Denzel Washington and Christopher <br/>
Walken.  It was okay.  Did a really good job of showcasing Mexico City.  <br/>
Christopher Walken played a former US government bad guy who had turned his life <br/>
around.  In one scene he&#39;s awakened by a phone call, and when he sits up, there <br/>
is his Mexican wife and their little 6ish yo boy asleep next to him.  <br/>
<br/>
I know it was a plot device to show how soft the former bad guy had become, <br/>
but it was sweet.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-687402949">This might sound silly but I&#39;ve always wondered - my husband and I are 60 years old and have health problems that make lovemaking (as in just for the fun of it) a low priority on our list of have too&#39;s. We are raising our spec needs (fetal alcohol syndrome grandson, almost 15) and he sleeps with my husband. He used to sleep with me because I needed to know where he was and what he was up to at all times. When he got to the point that he was older and not so sickly he moved in with my husband (husband snores, uses C-PAP  --  I have my own medical problems that made it difficult for him (grandson - husband too  to be in my bed.) We periodically try to get him to sleep in his own bed but he usually ends up not making it through the night. At other peoples homes he is able to tolerate sleeping alone.<br/>

My question to the group is -- Are you all celibate?<br/>
================<br/>
<br/>
At our old house, we had the kids in a bedroom next to us.  I started out the <br/>
night with nurslings, and when they were asleep (which usually knocked me out <br/>
for awhile too), I might go to the other bed.  If there was a kid with my <br/>
husband, sometimes I&#39;d move him into the kid-room.  But we had a deal in those <br/>
days that anytime I had the energy and the mood, my husband was willing to be <br/>
woken up.<br/>
<br/>
The kids were rarely awake when he woke up to go to work.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t have to use the bed if we wanted to make love.  There were other <br/>
places.<br/>
<br/>
Our new house is bigger and our kids are older and though sometimes Holly <br/>
(12) wants me to sleep with her, and when we travel  she often sleeps with me, <br/>
usually she&#39;s happy to be alone.  <br/>
<br/>
A while back she slept with her dad one night when I was going to a midnight <br/>
movie with the boys and I didn&#39;t want to leave her in the front of the house <br/>
all alone.  I slept in her bed that night because we got back so late.<br/>

But mine are eight and 16. It DOES get easier----and roomier! Cameron  (16) <br/>

spend the night with a friend, his brother, or in his own room. I guess  he&#39;s only <br/>

You have to be careful with those 16 yo&#39;s, though.  If they&#39;re like mine <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about the pioneers, but awhile ago on another list related to<br/>
The Continuum Concept there was a great discussion inspired by a Native<br/>
American&#39;s account of what it was like to grow up in his culture,<br/>
co-sleeping with his parents, having conversations with them about sex when<br/>
he was a young boy, etc.   One really touching story was when his parents<br/>
decided to have another child his younger sister (who was still cosleeping<br/>
w/ them at the time) would sing songs to the new child who was yet to be<br/>
conceived as his parents made love.<br/>
<br/>
Some of this discussion also occurred on a yahoo group called talk-w-zak.<br/>
It isn&#39;t very active now, but the old discussions are probably still there.<br/>

Exactly.  Good argument for letting them come in really really late.  <br/>
<br/>
We were kind of stuck, though.  We had two driving teenagers in the house and <br/>
the third kid in the bed.  We transiitioned him to the floor at some point.  <br/>
At appropriate times, I would just lift up his blankets and drag him into the <br/>
walk-in closet for a bit.  ;()<br/>
