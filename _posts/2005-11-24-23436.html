Dylan recently asked me why the word &quot;Autumn&quot; has a silent n.   I thought<br/>
it was from Autumnus, don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ll probably look it up today, and<br/>
he wondered why the n wasn&#39;t dropped entirely.  He really feels if we&#39;re<br/>
going to decide to drop whole syllables from words we should make a clean<br/>
cut and get rid of those pesky leftover letters.  <br/>
We decided the letters were left in so there could be funny scenes in<br/>
Monty Python movies. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
***Instead of the huge emphasis on phonics I wish people/teachers/readers<br/>
would <br/>
just be honest and tell kids &quot;You don&#39;t know for sure until you hear it.&quot;<br/>
  <br/>
Not just about names, about any words, especially in English. ***  <br/>
<br/>
When the first Harry Potter book came out one of our friends called us<br/>
and others trying to find out how to say &quot;Hermione.&quot;  Everyone had a<br/>
different idea. &lt;g&gt;  (She was only calling friends in our calling area,<br/>
not long distance, not to England where someone would have really known.)<br/>

thousand-year history, and like an antique shop stuffed with wonderful things to <br/>
discover, there are mysteries but they&#39;re beautiful when you know what they are.<br/>
