<div id="ygrps-yiv-237420756"><div dir="ltr">This doesn&#39;t sound like an unschooling question to me. And it&#39;s area-specific, which isn&#39;t encouraged here as this is an international group. However, the school, I imagine, only want to know what she&#39;s been up to and are couching it in terms of &#39;progress&#39; because they&#39;re a school. Don&#39;t panic. I can&#39;t see that it&#39;s a test, simply to give them an idea of what she might know or not know already. So just send them a brief report of the kinds of things she&#39;s done over the last year and explain that you haven&#39;t been doing formal work with her due to needing to help her heal from her damaging time in school previously.<br><br>Clare</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-237420756gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-237420756gmail_quote">On 12 July 2016 at 20:19, Kate Crussie <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:katecrussie@...">katecrussie@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-237420756gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111855784">-=-and are being asked for a HomeSchool progress report of her learning from last year. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You’re being asked either because they have a checklist and a folder to consider, or because they don’t know whether to put her in a quicker or a slower group.<br/>
<br/>
Moving from one public school to another in the U.S., they don’t have the option not to accept her.  And they won’t keep her back a year for no good reason.  <br/>
Look at these pages for ideas if you do want to create a document for them.  Find some phrasing you like.  Say it was “authentic assessment” and not grades.  Say something about her own willingness to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Deschooling for a year and putting her into school isn’t really an unschooling question; Clare’s right.  But I let it through because I wanted to say that moving from one state to another is more extreme than unschooling, and the conditions in which bullying can thrive are present in all school situations.  So don’t be angry at Georgia, or at your daughter, or at individuals at school, if school is still school.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Either way we need a form documenting her progress. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You probably really don’t “need” it just because they requested it.  Say she was homeschooled informally, and state her age clearly, and the’ll put her in the grade appropriate to her age.<br/>
<br/>
Kids transfer into and out of schools all the time, suddenly and unexpectedly, and schools don’t wait for proof or grades from the previous school to enroll that child.   Schools will claim and bluster “you need to wait until after the semester to move” or whatever, but schools have zero say in whether a family can move, withdraw, enroll, etc.  If you prove residence and age, I think that’s all that’s required.<br/>
