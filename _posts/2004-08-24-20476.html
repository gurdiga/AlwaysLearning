    I just got my copy of Live Free Learn  Free in <br/>
  the mail a couple of days ago.  It is a great magazine if the first  issue is <br/>
  any indication.  It was loaded with articles and with a huge  unschooling <br/>
  slant.  I also subscribe to Life Learning and enjoy that as  well.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  ***I just went to the web site and you can purchase the current issue through paypal, so I just bought it and am anxiously waiting &lt;g&gt;<br/>
