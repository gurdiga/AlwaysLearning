This is so cool-it made me smile and think of the Lion King movie, at the  <br/>
end where Rafikki is trying to get Simba to look within himself by way of a  <br/>
reflection in the water and he says, &quot;Look *ha*rder&quot; as he points him to look at  <br/>
the reflection again.<br/>

Maybe that&#39;s what the trick is-instead of me looking superficially at the  <br/>
&quot;mess&quot;, I need to &quot;look harder&quot;, look deeper and see what my kids see.  Thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1966627969">All -<br/>
<br/>
I have been thinking a lot about cleaning, picking up after kids, asking<br/>
for help, etc.  My kids are young, almost five, and 20 mos.  I can see<br/>
how just doing the work, and occasionally inviting help, would play out<br/>
well in the long run.  I think that my children already tend to be<br/>
helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
I am very happy to leave out long term projects or toys.  Often my son<br/>
will build a train track across the entire living room floor and will<br/>
work on it over many days.  This is lovely.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that I feel like I am buried in a never ending cycle of<br/>
abandoned toys, dishes, messes.  My children don&#39;t have an overwhelming<br/>
amount of stuff, so I don&#39;t think that the issue is one of too much. <br/>
There is a lot of food waste of the &quot;I want a sandwich, now I&#39;ve taken a<br/>
bite and changed my mind, how about a banana,the banana isn&#39;t tasty,<br/>
what about some crackers&quot; variety - which also creates a lot of dishes<br/>
and mess.  I am trying to be kind, loving, and helpful.  I am trying not<br/>
to yell that I have just made an abandoned sandwich and peeled a banana<br/>
and don&#39;t think they really want crackers.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is also being messy.  I think more than usual because it is<br/>
already messy from the kids.  What is one more glass?  I don&#39;t want to<br/>
spend time arguing with my husband about cleaning up, he works hard, I<br/>
just want to hang out with him.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - I feel used.  Taken advantage of.  Tired of being the only one<br/>
doing any of upkeep.  When I don&#39;t clean then it isn&#39;t as pleasant<br/>
around here, there is bickering, my husband is annoyed and I feel like I<br/>
have dropped the ball.<br/>
<br/>
Do I just have to embrace that for the next decade this is my deal? <br/>
Hiring someone else isn&#39;t really an option right now.<br/>
<br/>
I am assuming that I need to change MY attitude and thinking - but I<br/>
can&#39;t get myself there yet.<br/>

The banana can go into a bag in the freezer, and be put in pancakes  <br/>
or banana bread later.  Consider that you&#39;re already working on a  <br/>
future meal.<br/>
<br/>
The sandwich could be wrapped up for later, too.  Maybe you or your  <br/>
husband would want it for a snack later if the kids don&#39;t, but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t need to be eaten RIGHT then.<br/>
<br/>
My mom used to tell me what I didn&#39;t want.  I still remember.  Try  <br/>
not to do that.  She would tell me I wasn&#39;t hungry and I wasn&#39;t cold,  <br/>
too, and with such a voice of derision.<br/>

<br/>

Put it in the dishwasher while you&#39;re breathing and thinking how  <br/>

<br/>
Every day you don&#39;t leave, you&#39;ve *chosen* to stay. It&#39;s not a trap  <br/>
you&#39;re in. You&#39;re choosing to stay because there&#39;s more good where  <br/>
you are than out there where you&#39;re not.<br/>

Look at the full good places rather than the empty annoying places in  <br/>

concentrate on now - don&#39;t think about the decade, just this minute  <br/>
and then the next.<br/>
<br/>
Every dish you pick up, give silent thanks that you have dishes. Every  <br/>
time you pick up something your husband left out, use that as a cue to  <br/>
silently (or out loud) thank him for what he does to make your good  <br/>
life possible. And, for SURE, every time you peel a banana or get out  <br/>
crackers for a child, give them a kiss along with it and let your  <br/>
heart overflow with happiness that your child is with you.<br/>

Do this as &quot;a practice&quot; - a discipline. When you forget, just notice  <br/>
that you&#39;ve been forgetting and start doing it again.<br/>

I used to be cranky when Keith would snore.  For a few years he  <br/>
snored a lot, when he was living in Minneapolis, and he would come  <br/>
home all snorey.  I think he had some kind of chronic sinus problem  <br/>
from all that northern swamp living.  After he moved back to New  <br/>
Mexico full time, the snoring almost totally stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Now, rarely, I&#39;ll hear him snore, and I think about how someday he  <br/>
might be dead and I would LOVE to hear him snore.  So now if I hear  <br/>
him snore I think about how safe I feel with him here, and how hard  <br/>
he works, and how rough it was to be him, with his school days and  <br/>
his parents, and how glad I am we&#39;ve stayed together so long.<br/>
<br/>
When I wash his dirty socks and underwear, I think that someday I  <br/>
might miss the smell of him, and the simple little things like  <br/>
folding his t-shirts.<br/>

<br/>

It has to do with love and gratitude.<br/>

My step-dad died in February, he hadn&#39;t really been sick (that we knew of!).  My mom keeps, still unwashed, the jeans that he worked in around the house.  She complained and complained about them, hated them.  They are paint stained and ugly.  She wanted him to wear some of his newer jeans, even if they would get grungy, he didn&#39;t want his newer stuff to get grungy.  <br/>
<br/>
Now those grungy, nasty jeans lay folded on the bed, or on the dresser, or in a chair.  I find them throughout her house, usually in the bedroom.  She said when we were going through his clothes that they were the one thing that she really wanted to keep.  <br/>

I have been married to my wonderful and messy husband for 20 years now. We have had other people come in to clean, which was a nuisance because I still had to pick up for them. We had a woman and her two children, victims of domestic violence, live with us for almost 2 years (she was going to stay for one night and it went on from there) and she was a compulsive cleaner. That was great! We loved having cute little girls and a mother who cleaned. I was spoiled by that but we all got used to things being cleaner. When I stopped working for pay, I didn&#39;t want to pay someone to clean. I knew that it was my choice, but I still resented it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Loving What Is&quot; by Byron Katie helped me to change my thinking. Now I clean when I feel like cleaning and don&#39;t when I don&#39;t. But I never resent it anymore. When I want things cleaned up, I do it. If it is before we have people over, then usually everyone will pitch in to help. Or not, if they don&#39;t feel like it. There are cleaning supplies in the boy&#39;s bathroom and I have vinyl flooring all around the toilet area. Guests are welcome to clean up after after middle-of-the-night-boy-aim or I can always pop in to quick clean up. If people don&#39;t like my house keeping they are welcome to not visit. My mother hasn&#39;t been to our house in almost 5 years. We meet at my brother&#39;s house and it is lovely. (My parents live across the country and my brother lives in the next town and has a house cleaner.) It is such a wonderful feeling to be free of the house-pride and anxiety that entailed. And to be free of the resentment about the housecleaning. I also now love noticing how much exercise I get from vacuuming and carrying laundry up and down the stairs. Putting dirty socks away is a great little calorie burning break. It took a while after doing The Work (from the book) but I am really peaceful about the cleaning. I still have plenty of other things to work on, though.<br/>

It always brings a smile to my face - it&#39;s a nice way to start my day at 5:30 AM while the house is slumbering.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes still I will get up and glance into the family room and there will be his night&#39;s work/creations.  The other day I got up and every Manga book from his bedroom was in the family room.  Then a few days later there were the Zome creations.<br/>

Rosie  and Roxana usually stay up a long time after my dh and I have <br/>
gone to bed.  I LOVE waking up in the morning and seeing the remains of <br/>
what they were  doing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
I could hear Logan going to bed this morning about the same time as Broc  and <br/>
I were waking up.  I do just the same thing in the mornings as you are  <br/>
talking about.   It&#39;s a bit like an archeology site... this morning it  was crumbs <br/>
from the pizza, the empty Juno netflix envelope, and my favorite  thing  was <br/>
the empty box that the new 500 GB external hard drive came  in!<br/>
 <br/>
 Last year, Logan put an extra hard drive into my computer that  he had and <br/>
wasn&#39;t using.   Early this week, he found enough computer  parts around and <br/>
decided to build a computer and use an old guitar for the  case.   To do that, he <br/>
needed his old hard drive back so last  evening we found an external drive on <br/>
sale at Staples for my  computer. It appears that during the night he did his <br/>
computer  magic.  I can&#39;t wait to peek into his room when he gets up because <br/>
I  imagine there will be at least a partially built computer on his floor.  <br/>
 <br/>
Years ago, waking up to the mess of crumbs and stuff all over the floor  just <br/>
would have started my day off wrong.  Just changing my  perceptions of how I <br/>
looked at it was such a huge key to the much happier  shift in our lives.<br/>
 <br/>
The &quot;zen&quot; stuff Pam talks about really helped and it became so automatic to  <br/>
see it all as evidence of a full happy life that we are living.  As the  kids <br/>
move towards adulthood, I know how quickly there will come the day when I  <br/>
will wake up to a house without children in it.  I&#39;ll enjoy all their stuff  for <br/>
every moment I can.<br/>

&gt; It is SO worth it to change your attitude. Do a sort of zen thing -<br/>
&gt; concentrate on now - don&#39;t think about the decade, just this minute<br/>
&gt; and then the next.<br/>
<br/>
Thich Nhat Hahn writes in the collection of essays &quot;Peace is Every<br/>
Step&quot; a very similar and eloquent kind of story. I was inspired to<br/>
make a sign which I hung above the sink... &quot;After the dishes... the<br/>
dishes&quot;. It&#39;s a buddhist meditation, quite similar to &quot;before<br/>
enlightenment, chop wood, carry water; after enlightenment, chop wood,<br/>
carry water&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s fascinating to me the number of places that sign has been<br/>
duplicated. My mom, who is a librarian, hung a sign saying &quot;after the<br/>
shelving, the shelving&quot; in her library, to help the staff be more<br/>
accepting of what could be a tedious annoying task.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure where the change in our culture occurred, where we went<br/>
from repetitive tasks being a form of meditation and predictably<br/>
restful quiet in life, to being something we resent. My family&#39;s<br/>
trying to reclaim it. And it&#39;s not like I don&#39;t have my very own pissy<br/>
whiny days about the maintenance work. DH and I are working on being<br/>
the one to encourage and thank the other, and get back on track with<br/>
it being meditative and restful. But as Sandra says... we don&#39;t have<br/>
time to work out our baggage. If we want to model joyful caregiving to<br/>
the kids, we have to do it now now now. Yesterday. And ditch the<br/>
whiney.<br/>
<br/>
Another fantastic source of inspiration for me on this front is the<br/>
Carol Flinders essay (sadly, not available online and she hasn&#39;t<br/>
returned my emails to make it so) &quot;The Keeper of the Keys&quot; from the<br/>
older edition of the Laurel&#39;s Kitchen cookbook (which I keep not for<br/>
the recipes but for that essay). I wrote this about that essay, in<br/>
regards to preparing food for the family:<br/>

<br/>
There are some great tidbits in Flinders&#39; essay that while addressing<br/>
food prep specifically apply equally to cleanup and the daily routine<br/>
as well. It&#39;s a great read and I really recommend it.<br/>

You can work on your baggage then, after you&#39;ve eliminated the time  <br/>
it takes to feel resentful. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean NEVER work out childhood trauma, I mean don&#39;t schedule  <br/>
that first, thinking you&#39;ll change your parenting when it&#39;s done,  <br/>
when you&#39;re all whole and better.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a thing that goes around--an inspirational bit about putting  <br/>
in the big rocks first, and then the small ones (and presumably then  <br/>
the gravel, and then the sand, and then the water, if you want your  <br/>
life to be packed really full!).    Make your kids the big rocks.   <br/>
Fill the rest of the stuff in around them, *if* there&#39;s room.<br/>
<br/>
When you feel like a good parent, you&#39;ll probably find yourself  <br/>
already having felt like a good person for a while without noticing.<br/>
