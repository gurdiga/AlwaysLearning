<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006595622">Janene is doing her &quot;explode the code&quot; book.  She is so very cute.  She <br/>
was trying to write bat.  She said &quot;mom, is the word bat for the animal <br/>
the same as the word bat for baseball?&quot;  I said yes and she said &quot;well, <br/>
then I just have to look back at the last page to figure out how to <br/>
spell it.<br/>
<br/>
Then, a few minutes later she says &quot;mom, I&#39;m going to stay up and study <br/>
all night.&quot;  I said OK.  <br/>
<br/>
Then, just about two (2 that is) minutes later she says, after a very <br/>
heavy sigh, &quot;it&#39;s hard to study all night.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And a minute later, she said &quot;if I study all night I&#39;ll have to move <br/>
from room to room, cause when you get into bed, I&#39;ll have to go study in <br/>
another bed cause you will be sleeping.  But if you just go sleep on the <br/>
couch downstairs, I can stay in your place and use the light and study <br/>
all night.  But if I fall asleep while I&#39;m studying, whose fault is <br/>
that, mom?  (she&#39;s saying this with a grin in her voice).  It&#39;s MINE, <br/>
mom, right, my fault if I fall asleep.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not even five, where has she ever heard about studying all night? <br/>
 HP maybe?  She&#39;s just too cute, lying in bed in her tie dye big shirt <br/>
and purple hair, her book and her pencil in hand, getting set to study <br/>
all night.  She&#39;s going to be mad cause I am NOT going to sleep on the <br/>
couch and I am ready for sleep.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for listening.<br/>

And how nice that she TOTALLY has the option.<br/>
<br/>
There were times I really needed (I thought) to study all night, and somebody <br/>
made me go to sleep.   She has freedom I never had until I was in college, <br/>
and no real test in the morning!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, that&#39;s what I really like about our choices.  Lexie just brought <br/>
up something they got at dragontree (our homeschooling park day).  It&#39;s <br/>
lined paper, with the manuscript letters on the inside cover.  She&#39;s <br/>
practicing her writing.  Oops, no now she is drawing a sub.  Today we <br/>
were watching Walking with cavemen and she said &quot;1.6 million years ago&quot; <br/>
and I asked her how she knew how to pronouce the decimals, and she just <br/>
looked at me...&quot;I just know.&quot;  It&#39;s good that my kids just know.  Every <br/>
day I work with kids who don&#39;t want to learn, who feel learning stops at <br/>
3;20, and who fight learning every bit of the way.  It&#39;s nice to come <br/>
home to kids who are just enjoying life.<br/>
