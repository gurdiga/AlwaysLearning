<div id="ygrps-yiv-2086690665">I asked my daughter&#39;s formerly<br/>
tongue-tied significant other about rolling his r&#39;s. His response:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve had it so ingrained in my mind that &quot;I cannot roll my R&#39;s&quot; that I <br/>
haven&#39;t practiced anew.  However, even prior to the surgery, there are <br/>
times when the &#39;rr&#39; appears unbidden. So, perhaps there is hope!<br/>
<br/>
I imagine that living in a location where I often attempt the roll would <br/>
help. Maybe a week in Spain will do the trick.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re going to Spain in December to visit his brother--it&#39;ll be <br/>
interesting to see what happens! Also interesting because his brother <br/>
(Puerto Rican heritage) has a baby whose mother is the same heritage as <br/>
my daughter (one-half Scandinavian, one-quarter English, one-quarter <br/>
German) so a possible in-the-future grandchild of mine might look like <br/>
this baby-in-Spain (who&#39;s just GORGEOUS , btw).<br/>

Susan, not eager to be a grandparent, although you can&#39;t tell it</div>
