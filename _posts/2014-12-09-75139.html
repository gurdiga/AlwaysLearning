<div dir="ltr">
<div style="FONT-SIZE:12pt;FONT-FAMILY:'Calibri';COLOR:#000000;">
<div>My daughter loves playing computer games, and so do the rest of the family! 
Some we all enjoy together (Minecraft!), and other’s only some of us like (my 
daughter and I both love sims, while she and her dad love playing nintendo games 
together). The issue I’m having is that my daughter wants us to play particular 
games. For example, she really wants her dad to play sims. He’s willing to give 
it a go for her, but as soon as he sits down to play, she wants to set up a huge 
family for him, with 3 sims and 4 horses, then when he asks how to do something, 
she gives him a half answer in an annoyed voice, and says his sims are all going 
to die. Understandably, he finds this very frustrating!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I’m not sure why my daughter wants us all to play specific games in a 
specific way. It’s not that she wants to watch us, because she usually goes off 
and watches YouTube while we play. I’m at a loss what she is getting out of it, 
and how to make it more enjoyable for all involved. Her dad and I are usually 
willing to give a game a go, and often really enjoy playing them (her dad is 
actually getting a little into the sims), but it’s very hard to learn a new game 
when she basically insists on setting it up to be as difficult as 
possible.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I’d love some suggestions on how to handle this? Her knowledge of these 
games is way ahead of us in a lot of cases, as she spends a lot of time watching 
YouTube tutorials on them, or experimenting with them. Her dad and I have less 
time to do this, especially seeing as as soon as we sit down to play, she either 
wants to join in (and then has specific things she does or doesn’t want us to 
do), or she wants to do something different.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I’d love some new perspectives on this one!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How old is she? It&#39;s probably age related.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like a need to control and have power. She sounds like a budding director or general but doesn&#39;t yet have the skills to lead, just boss people around ;-)<br/>
<br/>
If you &quot;beat&quot; her challenge is she interested? Or has she totally lost interest once she gets you set up?<br/>
<br/>
Is there something going on in her life that she feels isn&#39;t in her control? Is she transitioning to new interests that she doesn&#39;t feel competent at? There may be some desire to see others fail because she&#39;s feeling incompetent at something.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s about control, maybe what would help is some matter-of-fact feedback. Then let it percolate for her so she can grow an understanding of how leading and bossing are different. Say, for instance, &quot;That&#39;s not fun for me. I like to set up my own Sims.&quot; &quot;I&#39;d love to play with you but I there are other things I&#39;d rather do on my own.&quot; If she does have a natural inclination to lead, she&#39;ll need feedback that the troops need to be kept happy or there will be rebellion ;-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How old is she? It&#39;s probably age related.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Forgot to mention that! She&#39;s 10<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; around ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it does feel a little like a need to control. She&#39;s always liked to be <br/>
the one in charge. It does occur to me as well that it could be an attempt <br/>
to make it &#39;fun&#39; for us. She wants us to play the way she finds fun. It <br/>
could also be a need to be right, as in she&#39;s playing the right way, so <br/>
everyone else is.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If you &quot;beat&quot; her challenge is she interested? Or has she totally lost <br/>
&gt; interest once she gets you set up?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s not really a challenge, I don&#39;t think. She will come by and comment on <br/>
things (she just said to her dad, who&#39;s playing sims, &quot;I can&#39;t believe your <br/>
character isn&#39;t dead yet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is there something going on in her life that she feels isn&#39;t in her <br/>

&gt; may be some desire to see others fail because she&#39;s feeling incompetent at <br/>
&gt; something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Possibly. We&#39;ve had some hard times here lately, that could be affecting <br/>
her, and she also has a lot of friends who are a couple of years older, and <br/>
thus more competent than her at some things (and not at others.) She has <br/>
younger friends as well, but she tends to only compare herself to those who <br/>
are better than she is!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; inclination to lead, she&#39;ll need feedback that the troops need to be kept <br/>
&gt; happy or<br/>
&gt; there will be rebellion ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is my inclination, but when I have tried it, she gets angry, and her <br/>
reply lately is &quot;Do you think I care?&quot; I did calmly reply that if she wanted <br/>
people to play with her, and her method of interacting with them was causing <br/>
them to not want to play with her, then she might care. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m <br/>
saying it in the wrong way, or just that it&#39;s going to take time? I try not <br/>
to say too much, since she doesn&#39;t really like lots of talking (especially <br/>
if she feels that she might be doing something wrong, she&#39;s very sensitive <br/>
to that), but this topic has come up quite a bit over the last year or two, <br/>
so maybe she&#39;s heard it too much? She isn&#39;t like this with her friends, just <br/>
her dad and I.</div>

&gt; This is my inclination, but when I have tried it, she gets angry, and her <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would try to stay emotionally detached from her words. Don&#39;t take them personally. It will make it easier to say, &quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; as a fact rather than feeling responsible for her feeling like she doesn&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
She may be looking for buttons to push especially if there have been some difficult times recently. And being at the edge of puberty doesn&#39;t help. That 10-12 age range can be wobbly as they transition from child interests to more mature interests.<br/>
<br/>
If you can see her as a 10 yo struggling with some issues rather than *your* struggling 10 yo whom you desperately want to help, that will probably help. It&#39;s sometimes easier to find the right thing to say to someone else&#39;s child because you don&#39;t feel like you need to take responsibility for the child&#39;s emotions. You can let the child have their own feelings about things. Then you can respond to the child rather than trying to fix them. If that makes sense. <br/>

Sometimes he watches or pops in and out. &nbsp;When he does, he might comment on how Doug can help himself, or he&#39;ll remark that he&#39;s impressed or surprised that he beat the challenge or some feature of it.</span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri"><span style="font-size:16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri"><span style="font-size:16px;">Both his dad and I aim to give it our very best shot when we tackle these challenges of Ethan&#39;s. &nbsp;Ethan doesn&#39;t like a lot of questions, because he wants to see us solving the problem ourselves for whatever reason. &nbsp;Actually, I think the reason is because he, himself, really enjoys solving problems, and he wants to share that experience with us. &nbsp;But, he will answer questions if we are really stuck. &nbsp;He gets a thrill out of seeing us work hard on whatever project he&#39;s set up for us, so we do our best to show him he&#39;s been successful at challenging us. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri"><span style="font-size:16px;"><br></span></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font color="#000000" face="Calibri"><span style="font-size:16px;">He&#39;s rarely unkind though, and I wouldn&#39;t play if he was. &nbsp;I would just say &quot;Be kind, Ethan.&quot;
