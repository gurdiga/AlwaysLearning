<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402545116">Hi, <br/>
<br/>
My daughter (6) has had what she calls the dying feeling on and off for over two years.<br/>
<br/>
I think it stemmed from a time when I was in and out of hospital and was the first time we were ever separated for more than an hour or so. I never stayed overnight and she was always with my husband but she took it really hard.<br/>
<br/>
The feeling was compounded when an older friend of hers (12) told her about hell. We are Muslims and this girl told her some pretty hard stuff about going to Hell. I was in the next room while they were playing together on a computer and the next thing my daughter came in petrified. <br/>
<br/>
Both of those things have had a major effect on her I think. It manifests itself at nighttime. We will lay in bed together (we cosleep) and she will tell me she is scared of me and her father dying. That she wants to die first or will kill herself when we die. She asks about hell and if we will go there.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes she gets so worked up about she can&#39;t stop crying and it has actually made her vomit.<br/>
<br/>
I tell her I understand that those are scary thoughts. That no we won&#39;t go to hell and try and calm her down. She takes deep breaths and we hug and talk. Sometimes she says she will bury us in the garden or imagines all sorts of scenarios where she can preserve our bodies. I listen and answer all her questions. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I tell her that I think it&#39;s better if she can be positive and think about how wonderful our life is now and how long that will continue for. Or maybe its not a good idea right before we go to sleep to talk about how long our flesh will stay before we decompose and become skeletons.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how to handle it. She gets so hurt and upset and I want to help her deal with these feelings. Is it ok to tell her to try not to think about these things? We talk about feelings a lot anyway. I don&#39;t want to dismiss her feelings. I want to help her cope with them.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve tried listening to relaxation podcasts before bed and she also likes to be read to or listen to audio books. I&#39;ve also tried massages. Sometimes she falls asleep during those and it&#39;s fine, but others times not. I&#39;ve asked her what will help or what first makes her think those feelings in the first place but shes not sure. <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to hearing your suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-370605696">My son went through a period of pretty intense anxiety about death at that age--mostly his fear of me or my husband dying.  Any time the subject of dying would come, he would get tears in his eyes, and say, &quot;can we please stop talking about this?&quot;  His twin sister is much more clinical than he is, so she&#39;d ask about dying out of curiosity and interest, but he just didn&#39;t want to even think about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that I have advice for you about how to ease her anxiety in the moment--I think the best we can do is to be there with them and for them while they&#39;re going through it, and to give them lots of cuddly space to process through it.  I&#39;ve always been truthful with my kids about death--saying we don&#39;t know when we&#39;ll die, though it&#39;s likely not for many years.  My mom died when I was 4, so it&#39;s never felt right to me to brush it off, saying, &quot;oh, we&#39;re going to live a long time, don&#39;t worry about it.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
But I mostly responded to say that I think Leila is at an age when I lots of kids do start thinking about death--it may have been somewhat prompted by external events, but it&#39;s also likely part of a developmental phase.  I actually had forgotten about my son&#39;s period of anxiety about dying until you wrote.  He&#39;s 8 now, and it&#39;s been over a year since he got really, deeply sad about it.  It may help *you* to be more calm and centered with her if you&#39;re not thinking about it as something that you need to solve for her, but rather a period that she&#39;s going through, the intensity of which will likely pass.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2061897567">I&#39;ve just read a book with short stories, many of them funny, by undertakers (funeral directors).  It&#39;s called <br/>
Mortuary Confidential: Undertakers Spill the Dirt.  I wish it had been longer.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806531797/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00">http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0806531797/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00</a><br/>
<br/>
When I was in England this summer, I happened to look out the window just as a man was walking in the middle of the road in a tophat, and tails, and there was a hearse behind him, and it was covered, on the top of the vehicle, with flowers.  He was walking, and the hearse was being driven, at the pace he was walking.  This was on a residential street right outside Julie&#39;s house.  I was shocked.  I wish I had taken a photo.   I can&#39;t find any photos like it on google.<br/>
<br/>
Julie wasn&#39;t shocked.  It was normal.  They pick the family (and the body?) up at the house.  The man walks in front, for a way (maybe all the way if they&#39;re not going far).<br/>
<br/>
One of the stories in that book was about an Englishwoman living in the U.S. who wanted that done at her husband&#39;s funeral, in the U.S. and described it.  <br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve seen lots of times a hearse with a coffin covered with flowers inside.  But this had the flowers OUTside, on the roof.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m writing this, but there are probably people here (in India, for instance) who have never seen a hearse with a coffin.<br/>
<br/>
And I was surprised, when I was in India, to learn that when a body is cremated, the family doesn&#39;t go down there to watch.  Just a few of the male relatives.  The women stay at the house.   I saw the smoke of a cremation at a distance, and I saw a platform by a river, and I asked, and they said that&#39;s what it was for.  It was concrete, and foat and had raised sides.  It was about like the foundation of a small house, to my mind, until I was told what it was for.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you share stories like those with your daughter she will be able to think about death in a larger more historical and geographical way, and it won&#39;t seem so immediate and personal.  Maybe.<br/>
<br/>
There ARE people who make a good living dealing with death.  And if you read the book above, you&#39;ll see lots of stories of ways they were able to really help the families, too.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were afraid about death (a stage many kids go through) I said I was afraid too, when I was little, but look how old I am (I&#39;d say; and now I&#39;m 20 years older still).<br/>
<br/>
MIght it help her to see an animal decompose?  If you find a dead bird, maybe you could leave it in a place in the yard where you can look at it periodically.  If you live in an apartment, maybe you could find pictures that aren&#39;t gross.<br/>
Here&#39;s a time-lapse of a rabbit decomposing naturally:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-875939703">My daughter Ashlin, who&#39;ll be 8 in February, has a sort of panic attack from time to time, where she says she&#39;s terrified of dying or she feels like she isn&#39;t real.  I hold her close and tell her that we are alive, right here and now, that life is precious and we should make our lives wonderful and fun and amazing. Usually she calms quickly, but the feelings are very intense.<br/>
<br/>
In more playful moments, in the context of whatever imaginative game the kids have concocted, they will play dead or have me or one of their toys play dead. I wonder if this is a way to sort of domesticate the idea of death, make it much less scary by deliberately bringing it closer, while still keeping it in the realm of fantasy. Maybe this sort of imaginative play would help your daughter to reframe in idea of death in a context that she has more control over.<br/>
<br/>
To quote Maurice Sendak:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&quot;Grown-ups desperately need to feel safe, and then they project onto the kids. But what none of us seem to realize is how smart kids are. They don&#39;t like what we write for them, what we dish up for them, because it&#39;s vapid, so they&#39;ll go for the hard words, they&#39;ll go for the hard concepts, they&#39;ll go for the stuff where they can learn something, not didactic things, but passionate things.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>

We&#39;ve seen a ghecko decompose here is Saudi. It happened very quickly and over the past year have buried a hamster, a guinea pig and two goldfish. She liked making them and decorating their graves. We also go and visit them. <br/>
<br/>
She knows that as Muslims we will be buried whole and that her grandma, who is not Muslim wants tobe cremated. I think looking at other stories will help too.<br/>
<br/>
Last night she asked me what I would do if she dies before me and I said I would want to kill myself too. I mentioned a recent post on the unschooling facebook page where someone said that having cildren made them want to be immortal for the first time. I said I had those feelings too.<br/>

My husband&#39;s dad died when he was 7. Leila doesn&#39;t know about that but it has made me very aware and not want to brush it off either. Lately though I have been ssaying more that it is not likely to happen for a very very long time whereas before I was more likely to say lets think about now and not what&#39;s going to happen in the future. I think that might not have been enough and she wanted more reassurance.<br/>

Yes, I think so. It&#39;s horrible though to watch her being so confused and upset.  <br/>

It might interest her to know that&#39;s something adults wonder about, too. It&#39;s a fairly universal theme in art and philosophy and mysticism - life is but a dream; just a dream withing a dream; I was part of his dream, but he was part of my dream, too... <br/>

depending how far you can/want to go with explaining other religions there are some books for children that talk about reincarnation and how the soul may choose where to incarnate next, etc. For example I saw some books of Neal Donald Walsh and while they are not everybody&#39;s cup of tea he makes some points about birth - rebirth there.<br/>

We live in Canada, but my dad&#39;s family is from England.  When my grandfather died in 2000, my dad and I went to London for the funeral.  They did exactly as you describe.  The thing that I thought was so touching too was that as we drove the streets, people stopped and nodded, men took off their hats, that kind of thing.  It was a different experience than you see in North America.  My grandfather was just a regular person, but he was acknowledged as a member of the community as his body passed through the streets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-411896685">It is often common for children that age to suddenly begin to get a glimpse<br/>
of mortality. In Indian scriptures and Vedas and Upanishads, the wisdom<br/>
books, talk of deeper meaning of life and mortality and the immortality of<br/>
the spirit.<br/>
<br/>
 The child suddenly goes out more into the world and sees more of life and<br/>
sickness and gets a sinking feeling that it is possible for people to die.<br/>
<br/>
My dear friend Hema from Pune, India had a long conversation about death<br/>
with Raghu, her 9 year old son, when their pet fish died. So they had a<br/>
small ceremonial burial!<br/>
<br/>
It is beginning of the first bout of what many call &#39;existential angst&#39;. It<br/>
is natural and children are beginning to feel and understand the world in<br/>
new and complex ways.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how religious your family is as you mentioned you are<br/>
Muslims..so depending on that you might make choices...about hell and<br/>
heaven...and death and birth...and so you can always take help from the<br/>
Koran. Some Christian homeschoolers here in India use the Bible for such<br/>
situations...<br/>
<br/>
In our family we don&#39;t make differences between hell and heaven..but talk<br/>
of death as matter and energy...<br/>
<br/>
You could read to her stories ..or show her movie versions of  &quot;Marley and<br/>
Me&#39;&#39;, &#39;Jungle Book&#39;, &#39;Bambi&#39;, &#39;Tarzan&#39; in which death in the animal world<br/>
is dealt with. So she would perhaps see how all living beings die..it is<br/>
natural.<br/>
<br/>
The Life of Pi is also a great story and you may like to read that to her<br/>
if she is open and receptive...<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t push it though...but stay with her questions and queries...and answer<br/>
them as gently and kindly as possible..the more calm and peace you have<br/>
within yourself about death and mortality she too will start to settle...<br/>
<br/>
My DD is 11 and she refused to go and see the film version of Life of Pi as<br/>
she had seen in the rushes animals dying...But my son is 6 and he enjoyed<br/>
it...<br/>
<br/>
So each child has certain inherent capacities and thresholds to pain,,<br/>
suffering, death...<br/>
<br/>
My DD also has many intense conversations about death and why people die<br/>
and why we are born...<br/>
<br/>
Once when she was younger and my son was watching the film Titanic over and<br/>
over again...she fell sick with nausea..and refused to ever see that film<br/>
again...<br/>
<br/>
But she later liked the film Step Mom..You might quietly slip that one in...<br/>
<br/>
I happened to stumble upon this amazing old film starring a young Jody<br/>
Foster and Richard Harris as her dad..I cannot recall the name now..Summer<br/>
Song or something like that.Does anyone know the name I missed the<br/>
credits?...In that film Jody is a 12 year old who is dying of some terminal<br/>
disease..and she has a 7 year boy as a friend..it was so lovely...<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My daughter (6) has had what she calls the dying feeling on and off for<br/>
&gt; over two years.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think it stemmed from a time when I was in and out of hospital and was<br/>
&gt; the first time we were ever separated for more than an hour or so. I never<br/>
&gt; stayed overnight and she was always with my husband but she took it really<br/>
&gt; hard.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The feeling was compounded when an older friend of hers (12) told her<br/>
&gt; about hell. We are Muslims and this girl told her some pretty hard stuff<br/>
&gt; about going to Hell. I was in the next room while they were playing<br/>
&gt; together on a computer and the next thing my daughter came in petrified.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both of those things have had a major effect on her I think. It manifests<br/>
&gt; itself at nighttime. We will lay in bed together (we cosleep) and she will<br/>
&gt; tell me she is scared of me and her father dying. That she wants to die<br/>
&gt; first or will kill herself when we die. She asks about hell and if we will<br/>
&gt; go there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes she gets so worked up about she can&#39;t stop crying and it has<br/>
&gt; actually made her vomit.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tell her I understand that those are scary thoughts. That no we won&#39;t go<br/>
&gt; to hell and try and calm her down. She takes deep breaths and we hug and<br/>
&gt; talk. Sometimes she says she will bury us in the garden or imagines all<br/>
&gt; sorts of scenarios where she can preserve our bodies. I listen and answer<br/>
&gt; all her questions.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sometimes I tell her that I think it&#39;s better if she can be positive and<br/>
&gt; think about how wonderful our life is now and how long that will continue<br/>
&gt; for. Or maybe its not a good idea right before we go to sleep to talk about<br/>
&gt; how long our flesh will stay before we decompose and become skeletons.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to handle it. She gets so hurt and upset and I want to<br/>
&gt; help her deal with these feelings. Is it ok to tell her to try not to think<br/>
&gt; about these things? We talk about feelings a lot anyway. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; dismiss her feelings. I want to help her cope with them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We&#39;ve tried listening to relaxation podcasts before bed and she also likes<br/>
&gt; to be read to or listen to audio books. I&#39;ve also tried massages. Sometimes<br/>
&gt; she falls asleep during those and it&#39;s fine, but others times not. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; asked her what will help or what first makes her think those feelings in<br/>
&gt; the first place but shes not sure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I look forward to hearing your suggestions.<br/>

Humans less so until now. She won&#39;t play angry birds for example but is quite happy blasting humans whilst playing grand theft auto with her dad.  She has only recently started playing minecraft after trying it and finding out that you can kill animals on there.<br/>

I read the synopsis of most programmes and books to see if any animal is going to get hurt or die. I didn&#39;t do that recently and we watched Bridge to Terabithia. It has a very sad ending and she was inconsolable for a few hours after the film.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has been my approach so far and also to shield her as much as possible from stories about death and pain. I think I am not very calm about death and mortality but to my knowledge have not vocalized it. I wonder if she has picked it up somehow.<br/>
<br/>
She has a large collection of plushies that she treats like real animals and gets very upset if they are &#39;hurt&#39; during play. Most of her friends know how sensitive she is about this and respect it, but that was quite hard for them and her to adjust to at the beginning. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666581328">On a slight tangent...There is a book you may find interesting, &quot;Philosophy and the Young Child&quot; by Gareth B. Matthews. I am slowly reading it.<br/>
<br/>
From the preface:<br/>
Many (college) students seemed to resist the idea that doing philosophy could be natural. In response to their resistance I hit on the strategy of showing them that as children many of them had already done philosophy.....to reintroduce my students to an activity that they had once enjoyed and found natural, but that they had later been socialized to abandon.<br/>
<br/>
The author uses snippets from Alice in Wonderland quite frequently. He finds a lot deep philosophy in all kinds of children&#39;s stories.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878485997">I remember when a friend of mine&#39;s son was concerned about his parent&#39;s dying. She talked to him about all the things they did to decrease that chance. I think it was things like eating healthy, exercise, wearing a seat belt, smoke alarms etc. That might help your daughter feel like there is some actions you are taking to try to be around as long as possible.<br/>
<br/>
You could also talk about what can be done medically if you get sick or hurt. It might make her feel like there are things that can be done to help people not die when serious things happen.<br/>
<br/>
I was also reminded by one of the posts of the time I volunteered with children in the hospital. There were many that were facing their own death. There was a excellent play therapist at the hospital. She had a huge collection of children&#39;s books that dealt with death, but often not directly. They were not written especially for sick and dying children. They were your average children&#39;s stories. It wasn&#39;t even obvious to me that the books could be interpreted to be discussing death until the play therapist point it out to me.   You might look at children&#39;s books in that light and might find some that would help your daughter with her anxiety.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100653902">My DD also would watch Titanic till the the iceberg hit! And then she would<br/>
not...<br/>
<br/>
She is still very sensitive to death and pain...<br/>
<br/>
Recently she broke her hand while playing football!<br/>
<br/>
And she was in grave pain..She had to be given general anesthesia for the<br/>
cast to be put and the forearm bone was displaced.<br/>
<br/>
I was with her all the way..but they did not allow me into the OT...here in<br/>
India they are pretty insensitive when it comes to hospitals...<br/>
<br/>
I stood out as she fearfully went in and with tears streaming down her eyes<br/>
went into the OT...<br/>
<br/>
Then when she was brought out and started to revive she kept calling for<br/>
me...<br/>
<br/>
I was with her since then..holding her hand and just saying &#39;Here I am&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
Later when she was fully revived she described the whole OT experience in<br/>
detail...<br/>
<br/>
And then told me..&quot;Now I can tell people what happens when you get a<br/>
fracture.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I often see that my kids don&#39;t want a clarification for their fears and<br/>
doubts...but just want me to hold them through it...as they process stuff<br/>
within their heads...<br/>
<br/>
But sometimes they want elaborate explanations..then I try and explain...<br/>

&gt; about death and mortality but to my knowledge have not vocalized it. I<br/>
&gt; wonder if she has picked it up somehow.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She has a large collection of plushies that she treats like real animals<br/>
&gt; and gets very upset if they are &#39;hurt&#39; during play. Most of her friends<br/>
&gt; know how sensitive she is about this and respect it, but that was quite<br/>
&gt; hard for them and her to adjust to at the beginning.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My DD is 11 and she refused to go and see the film version of Life of Pi<br/>
&gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; she had seen in the rushes animals dying...But my son is 6 and he enjoyed<br/>
&gt; &gt; it...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So each child has certain inherent capacities and thresholds to pain,,<br/>
&gt; &gt; suffering, death...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; My DD also has many intense conversations about death and why people die<br/>
&gt; &gt; and why we are born...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Once when she was younger and my son was watching the film Titanic over<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; over again...she fell sick with nausea..and refused to ever see that film<br/>
&gt; &gt; again...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; But she later liked the film Step Mom..You might quietly slip that one<br/>
&gt; in...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I happened to stumble upon this amazing old film starring a young Jody<br/>
&gt; &gt; Foster and Richard Harris as her dad..I cannot recall the name<br/>
&gt; now..Summer<br/>
&gt; &gt; Song or something like that.Does anyone know the name I missed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; credits?...In that film Jody is a 12 year old who is dying of some<br/>
&gt; terminal<br/>
&gt; &gt; disease..and she has a 7 year boy as a friend..it was so lovely...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Thank you. I will mention the films. She actually watched the beginning of<br/>
&gt; Bridge to Terabithia again yesterday, but said she wanted to stop before<br/>
&gt; the sad bit. In the end she got distracted after a while anyway and we<br/>
&gt; stopped watching to do something else.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; My daughter (6) has had what she calls the dying feeling on and off for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; over two years.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I think it stemmed from a time when I was in and out of hospital and was<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the first time we were ever separated for more than an hour or so. I<br/>
&gt; never<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; stayed overnight and she was always with my husband but she took it<br/>
&gt; really<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; hard.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; The feeling was compounded when an older friend of hers (12) told her<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; about hell. We are Muslims and this girl told her some pretty hard stuff<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; about going to Hell. I was in the next room while they were playing<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; together on a computer and the next thing my daughter came in petrified.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Both of those things have had a major effect on her I think. It<br/>
&gt; manifests<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; itself at nighttime. We will lay in bed together (we cosleep) and she<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; tell me she is scared of me and her father dying. That she wants to die<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; first or will kill herself when we die. She asks about hell and if we<br/>
&gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; go there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes she gets so worked up about she can&#39;t stop crying and it has<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; actually made her vomit.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I tell her I understand that those are scary thoughts. That no we won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; go<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to hell and try and calm her down. She takes deep breaths and we hug and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; talk. Sometimes she says she will bury us in the garden or imagines all<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; sorts of scenarios where she can preserve our bodies. I listen and<br/>
&gt; answer<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; all her questions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Sometimes I tell her that I think it&#39;s better if she can be positive and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; think about how wonderful our life is now and how long that will<br/>
&gt; continue<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; for. Or maybe its not a good idea right before we go to sleep to talk<br/>
&gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; how long our flesh will stay before we decompose and become skeletons.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I&#39;m not sure how to handle it. She gets so hurt and upset and I want to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; help her deal with these feelings. Is it ok to tell her to try not to<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; about these things? We talk about feelings a lot anyway. I don&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; dismiss her feelings. I want to help her cope with them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; We&#39;ve tried listening to relaxation podcasts before bed and she also<br/>
&gt; likes<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to be read to or listen to audio books. I&#39;ve also tried massages.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; she falls asleep during those and it&#39;s fine, but others times not. I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; asked her what will help or what first makes her think those feelings in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the first place but shes not sure.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I look forward to hearing your suggestions.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>

There&#39;s a Friends episode about Phoebe never having seen the end of Bambi.  My kids hadn&#39;t, either.  Just the happy beginning, that&#39;s all.  Until they were older and might&#39;ve seen it on their own somewhere.  I didn&#39;t buy it.  I don&#39;t like death-of-animal stories at all myself.  I don&#39;t like the lion-gets-gazelle parts of nature documentaries.  Yes, they have to eat, but I don&#39;t need to watch.<br/>

Shelter your kids from what you know is ugly.  Shelter me too, if I&#39;m around.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really okay to &quot;cherry pick&quot; in regard to the stories you let into your day.   There&#39;s enough horrow somewhere on the planet at any moment to make us all suicidal, so make it a habit NOT to collect or dwell on those stories.  You have a responsibility to create as safe and peaceful a nest as you can for your own family.<br/>

favorite children&#39;s books about death was by Australian author Jenny<br/>
Wagner. It&#39;s called John Brown, Rose and the Midnight Cat. It was made into<br/>
a short movie (6.5 minutes) in the 1980s and someone&#39;s uploaded it to<br/>

&gt; I remember when a friend of mine&#39;s son was concerned about his parent&#39;s<br/>
&gt; dying. She talked to him about all the things they did to decrease that<br/>
&gt; chance. I think it was things like eating healthy, exercise, wearing a seat<br/>
&gt; belt, smoke alarms etc. That might help your daughter feel like there is<br/>
&gt; some actions you are taking to try to be around as long as possible.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could also talk about what can be done medically if you get sick or<br/>
&gt; hurt. It might make her feel like there are things that can be done to help<br/>
&gt; people not die when serious things happen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was also reminded by one of the posts of the time I volunteered with<br/>
&gt; children in the hospital. There were many that were facing their own death.<br/>
&gt; There was a excellent play therapist at the hospital. She had a huge<br/>
&gt; collection of children&#39;s books that dealt with death, but often not<br/>
&gt; directly. They were not written especially for sick and dying children.<br/>
&gt; They were your average children&#39;s stories. It wasn&#39;t even obvious to me<br/>
&gt; that the books could be interpreted to be discussing death until the play<br/>
&gt; therapist point it out to me. You might look at children&#39;s books in that<br/>
&gt; light and might find some that would help your daughter with her anxiety.<br/>

My 9 year old would happily spend time most any day strolling through a cemetery.  He *loves* walking around old graveyards, looking for interesting gravestones, seeing the names and dates on the stones and imagining who the people might have been, figuring out how old people were when they died, searching for the oldest stones we can find, wondering if we’ll see a ghost (and hoping we will :-)), visiting the gravesites of dead US presidents, etc.<br/>
<br/>
At the same time, he doesn’t want to watch the movie We Bought A Zoo because when we looked it up on the imdb database, it said the story centers around the mother of the children dying, and he says that’s way too sad to think about.  He wanted to watch the TV show Duck Dynasty, until he saw part of one episode where the family goes hunting for frogs which they then cook and eat.  He was ok with the hunting part and knows some people hunt for food – but he said he didn’t want to actually watch anything die. <br/>
<br/>
Our family has experienced the passing of two close relatives this year – and he’s so far processed their deaths as simple facts – they were alive, and now they’re not.  He doesn’t ask questions about what happens when someone dies or about an afterlife or heaven or such – but he does seem to like the idea that he heard on a Stephen Hawking documentary that energy can’t be created or destroyed and so even in death, a person’s energy is still around somehow.<br/>
<br/>
Watching him process the experience of relatives dying, going to cemeteries with him, watching and talking about movies and TV shows and documentaries that touch on death and dying, etc. has confirmed once again for me how very important it is to make sure to pay attention to each individual child’s interest level and comfort level with particular topics of conversation and exploration – to follow their lead to where they want to go, and not try to get in front and pull them along with you :-) <br/>
<br/>
Some kids might find cemeteries to be a big yawn :-) but would be really into dissection, decomposition, mummies, and such.  Others, when trying to process the idea of death, might want to go to church or talk about heaven, think about angels and reincarnation, etc.  Some kids go hunting and fishing, and others don’t want to give one thought to the idea that the meat they eat was once alive. <br/>
<br/>
If I had assumed that because my son likes cemeteries, I should introduce a whole bunch of other stuff about death and dying - I’d have scared him and upset him rather than supporting his interests in a way that works for him.  So we take him to all sorts of gravesites, look up how different presidents died, get Haunted Hikes books out of the library and try to find local ghosts :-) and we leave We Bought A Zoo for those who like that sort of story.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594286157">It is interesting to observe how DD would not watch Titanic but DS watched<br/>
that film over and over again..he infact was bored with the romance..but<br/>
the moment the ship hit the iceberg he would be all eyes and ears...<br/>
<br/>
So Titanic was always watched bu two different audiences..first half<br/>
DD..second half DS...<br/>
<br/>
For a year in between he stopped watching this film...then with 100 years<br/>
of Titanic..early this year again it got revived...<br/>
<br/>
This time not the movie but..YouTube videos of the graphics of the<br/>
sinking...<br/>
<br/>
Over and over again..Then he started making sketches of this...<br/>
<br/>
Actually for him the dynamics of the sinking and the large ship and its<br/>
structure was interesting!<br/>
<br/>
I always respect what my kids feel like watching and what they don&#39;t...<br/>
<br/>
I also was surprised when DD wanted to watch Step Mom and a Hindi version<br/>
of the same film..and then she started watching this year a TV serial about<br/>
a young woman with cancer!<br/>
<br/>
But she did not want to watch Life of Pi...<br/>
<br/>
Last evening Ishaan was watching this program on Nat Geo or Discovery I<br/>
think, called Prehistoric Predators..gory..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1294721713">When my daughter was little, we discovered a 30-minute VHS tape at the<br/>
library entitiled &quot;Granpa.&quot;  We liked it so much that I bought us a used<br/>
copy from amazon.com.  It&#39;s an animated version of the book by John<br/>
Burningham.  You can still get used tapes and used copies of the book from<br/>
amazon.com.  You might check your public library, too, for the book and/or<br/>
the videotape.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about a little girl&#39;s close relationship with her grandfather.  As my<br/>
daughter got older, and my father got older, my daughter has not wanted to<br/>
watch it anymore.  She says it makes her sad.  I think it reminds her that<br/>
there will come a day when her grandfather is not around .<br/>

&gt; When I was in my 20&#39;s I worked as a children&#39;s librarian. One of my<br/>
&gt; favorite children&#39;s books about death was by Australian author Jenny<br/>
&gt; Wagner. It&#39;s called John Brown, Rose and the Midnight Cat. It was made into<br/>
&gt; a short movie (6.5 minutes) in the 1980s and someone&#39;s uploaded it to<br/>
&gt; youtube.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I remember when a friend of mine&#39;s son was concerned about his parent&#39;s<br/>
&gt; &gt; dying. She talked to him about all the things they did to decrease that<br/>
&gt; &gt; chance. I think it was things like eating healthy, exercise, wearing a<br/>
&gt; seat<br/>
&gt; &gt; belt, smoke alarms etc. That might help your daughter feel like there is<br/>
&gt; &gt; some actions you are taking to try to be around as long as possible.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; You could also talk about what can be done medically if you get sick or<br/>
&gt; &gt; hurt. It might make her feel like there are things that can be done to<br/>
&gt; help<br/>
&gt; &gt; people not die when serious things happen.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was also reminded by one of the posts of the time I volunteered with<br/>
&gt; &gt; children in the hospital. There were many that were facing their own<br/>
&gt; death.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was a excellent play therapist at the hospital. She had a huge<br/>
&gt; &gt; collection of children&#39;s books that dealt with death, but often not<br/>
&gt; &gt; directly. They were not written especially for sick and dying children.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They were your average children&#39;s stories. It wasn&#39;t even obvious to me<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the books could be interpreted to be discussing death until the play<br/>
&gt; &gt; therapist point it out to me. You might look at children&#39;s books in that<br/>
&gt; &gt; light and might find some that would help your daughter with her anxiety.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818056146">My children went through a period of fear of me dying and then fear of their Daddy dying or of themselves. I had cancer for 5 long years and I could not honestly say to them that I would not die. I told them that I am doing all I can do to be here with them for as long as I can. My husband and I also had a will made and told them about it. In the will we specify a very loving family member to care for them and that we have money put aside to help take care of them and that they would be able to continue an unschooling lifestyle. <br/>
<br/>
I am a Christian and have shared what I believe what will happen to me when I die. They mostly believe in the Christian faith and were satisfied with my explanations. <br/>
<br/>
I think you should share your faith with your daughter, if that is the same faith she/he embraces and let her know of your plans for her care should anything happen to you. <br/>
<br/>
Yes, there will be sorrow and pain and a horrible sense of loss. That you can be sure of.  However, you can give her some comfort now by loving her up, sharing plans should your death happen and that its okay to grieve and then move on with life and find her own peace and happiness. <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps you somehow. Death can be a very scary concept for anyone. <br/>

PS:  I am now in my 5 th year of being cancer free!!!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404367427">A six-year-old can&#39;t even slightly grasp statistics and probability. So the<br/>
problem for a really sensitive and imaginative child is that anything they<br/>
can imagine seems pretty much equally likely. Once they&#39;ve imagined their<br/>
parents&#39; deaths, they have no way to soothe themselves with words like, &quot;It<br/>
isn&#39;t likely to happen anytime soon.&quot; That&#39;s all we adults really have to<br/>
soothe ours own fears - outside of religious beliefs - and children do not<br/>
have that ability. For that reason, I&#39;d support my children&#39;s religious<br/>
ideas even if I had my own doubts. If they said, &quot;I think people go to<br/>
heaven,&quot; I would agree with them without much comment. If that comforts<br/>
them, I&#39;d be happy they have that.<br/>
<br/>
I would be pretty strong, as a mom, in saying to my own children, &quot;I&#39;m not<br/>
going to die for a REALLY long time.&quot; Some people might object to that<br/>
because you can&#39;t really know it. But, that&#39;s as close to giving an<br/>
accurate estimate of the probability as the child can understand. The<br/>
probability is very small that you are going to die during her childhood<br/>
years. The probability that a 30 year old American woman will die in the<br/>
next year is .00059 - that is less than 6 hundredths of a percent - it<br/>
rounds off to zero percent. I&#39;d go with that. If you&#39;ve made it to 30 years<br/>
old, your life expectancy is another 51 years. You could say, &quot;I am<br/>
probably going to live to be really old - more than 80 years old or maybe<br/>
even 100 years old.&quot; She still won&#39;t understand &quot;probably&quot; and it might<br/>
sound like a promise to her. I&#39;d let her take it that way, myself. If she<br/>
said, &quot;Really?&quot; I would say, &quot;That&#39;s what I think, yes.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1321439315">I too am a cancer survivor and live through the possibility of it coming<br/>
back each time I go for check ups and monitoring...I also feel if religious<br/>
faith can give comfort to a child...then so be it...<br/>
<br/>
Why not? In my family we talk a lot about different faiths and belief<br/>
systems...and my children believe in the rebirth faith..that each time the<br/>
soul sheds a dress when its worn off and then puts on another to come back<br/>
and play another role...for a play that is divine...<br/>
<br/>
Once my son Ishaan and another boy were playing with a bow and arrow<br/>
each..and I heard Ishaan tell this other boy..&quot;You cannot kill me as I am<br/>
already dead and will be born again...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He got this from the Krishna Avatar stories that I often tell them...<br/>
<br/>
DD loves Jesus for the pain he went through...we saw Passion of Christ<br/>
together..and she was touched by the film in very deep ways...this is from<br/>
a girl who does not like to still watch Titanic...<br/>
<br/>
I sometimes feel I as a mother can perhaps never know what is in their<br/>
hearts and heads...I can try all the time to tune in...<br/>
<br/>
They also ask me..&quot;Will I die soon?&quot;....I try to be honest...and say..&quot;Well<br/>
I cannot really say the time of my death? But I know for sure that you will<br/>
still be loved and taken care of by family and friends.&quot;<br/>
