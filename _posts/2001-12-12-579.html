<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My homeschool group is actively talking about this subject a lot these days. <br/>
&gt; I think Zoe, 12, is interested in taking some kind of test. She has a good <br/>
&gt; friend who is doing accelerated work in many areas and has already taken a <br/>
&gt; bunch of tests. I am totally uninterested in her taking any sort of test <br/>
&gt; ever. But if she really wants to? And if I know she&#39;s thinking about it, is <br/>
&gt; it wise to give her the info about these tests?  We&#39;ve talked about it some <br/>
&gt; - <br/>
&gt; I stress how the tests are limited sources of information. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to do what she wants, but I fear that having a numerical score will <br/>
&gt; leave an indelible &quot;feeling&quot; in her about her intelligence.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When opportunities for classes, etc. come up, I will give Julian the <br/>
information and he will let me know whether he wants to do it or not.  I <br/>
figure if it&#39;s in the world and he is interested, he deserves to know about <br/>
it. When we get newsletters, etc., from homeschool groups, we just go over it.<br/>
<br/>
Tests are tricky. I think they&#39;re stupid, but Julian (also 12) expressed <br/>
interest in taking an IQ test. I asked if it needed to be &quot;official&quot; and <br/>
formal, or if it could be online or through a book. He said casual was fine, <br/>
and I ran across something online.<br/>
<br/>
Well, he took it and scored very high (despite taking a snack break in the <br/>
middle of the timed test.). I was not surprised--but he was.  It turned out <br/>
that he thought he was not very smart, and expected low scores. He had some <br/>
self-esteem issues because of a couple of friends, and ultimately taking that <br/>
little test has been good for him. In the last few months I&#39;ve noticed him <br/>
challenging himself more. He&#39;s been writing fairly regularly, and has asked <br/>
Beth to teach him math. (I&#39;ll go into that in another post.)<br/>
<br/>
I would never push a test on a kid, but since she&#39;s asked, I&#39;d give her the <br/>
information and let her decide. You can remind her that results on tests are <br/>
affected by lots of things, and not to stress it too much. You might also ask <br/>
her WHY she wants to take a test. <br/>

I see that this could be one possible outcome for Zoe as well. Several of her <br/>
friends have been officially identified as &quot;gifted&quot; and I know she wonders <br/>
where she fits in. Now I know she is &quot;gifted&quot; according to the way schools <br/>
test things and I also know her truest gifts are not testable - for instance, <br/>
I know she has interpersonal giftedness. I also think it&#39;s possible she might <br/>
freeze up on a test.<br/>
<br/>
Part of my issue, now that I&#39;m really thinking about it, is wondering if I am <br/>
limiting her opportunities because of my own fears. I was a super <br/>
overachiever, getting good grades for the sake of grades, blah blah blah. I <br/>
was totally invested in being smarter than others, taking more honors <br/>
classes, going to the best college.......  It&#39;s taken me years to become the <br/>
blissful underachiever I am now &lt;vbg&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Zoe could be just like that. There are a set of programs offered by <br/>
Northwestern U. - the Center for Talent Development - that I bet she would <br/>
love, but I have just dismissed because then there she&#39;d be, surrounded by <br/>
school kids all vying for the next spot at Harvard.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377492908">Back in the olden days when I used to administer standardized tests for<br/>
diagnostic purposes, I was always concerned about the diagnosis of mental<br/>
retardation and how that might color a parent&#39;s perception of their child.<br/>
I always spent some time with the parents, talking about how a diagnosis is<br/>
basically shorthand to describe how a person did on a particular day, in a<br/>
particular setting, on a particular set of tasks.  I talked with them about<br/>
how the diagnosis doesn&#39;t change the person.  Johnny is still Johnny.  He<br/>
didn&#39;t suddenly become MR when he was diagnosed.<br/>
<br/>
I also would make some very absurd observations of the child and ask the<br/>
parent if they were correct.  I would use that to make a point of the &quot;if it<br/>
sounds correct, keep it.  If it doesn&#39;t, toss it&quot; philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I have to say if it was my dd, I would have the above discussion with her<br/>
and I would let her test herself.<br/>
