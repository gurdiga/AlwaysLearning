<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575140621">I guess in some ways I&#39;m glad I grew up in England because we have a<br/>
different system, albeit a system, for separating the kids and we don&#39;t<br/>
have grades.  When people start to talk to me about someone being in 7th<br/>
grade of whatever grade it is I usually stop them and say &quot;and what age<br/>
is that&quot;.  In all the 22 years of living in America I have never<br/>
bothered to either learn or remember what age goes with what grade....<br/>
Now I know why... Because it wasn&#39;t going to be relevant to my life or<br/>
my kids lives.<br/>
<br/>
Zak nearly 9 says &quot;I&#39;m not in a grade I&#39;m homeschooled&quot;... Most of the<br/>
times that enough for the kids he comes across and then they just start<br/>
playing together.  When people tell me what grade their child is in many<br/>
times, although I&#39;m doing this less, I will say &quot;oh how sad that your<br/>
kids go to that prison all day, what did they do wrong that would make<br/>
you want to send them there?&quot;  Of course people don&#39;t often want<br/>
anything to do with me after that... Which again is ok.  I&#39;ve stopped<br/>
saying that now and have found sometimes it&#39;s best to just say &quot;there<br/>
are no grades in his school&quot; and leave it at that.<br/>

social network at all. Because most people assume the only purpose of  <br/>
a list is for meeting other like minded people they don&#39;t even  <br/>
question it.<br/>
<br/>
But the list has a description at Yahoo, a welcome letter with an  <br/>
explanation and a suggestion to read for a while to get a feel for it.<br/>
<br/>
This list is unusual. This list exists specifically for examining,  <br/>
dissecting, analyzing what works and what doesn&#39;t work for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry it blindsides people, but it shouldn&#39;t. The information  <br/>
about the list comes right to people&#39;s mailboxes. It really is a good  <br/>
idea to read it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; and try to &quot;teach&quot; her the &quot;right&quot; way.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oddly for an unschooling list, that&#39;s the purpose. But unlike school  <br/>
where the lessons are imposed, people sign onto the list specifically  <br/>
to dissect what they do to figure out what&#39;s getting in the way of  <br/>
unschooling running smoothly for them. (Or they come to read the  <br/>
dissection of other&#39;s problems which is often much easier to take in  <br/>
for most people.)<br/>
<br/>
I think Pam worded it succinctly:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; People should post only what they want read critically, that is, with<br/>
&gt;&gt; careful, exact evaluation and judgment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does that make sense?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; She was only answering the original post not asking any questions.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Did you read what Sandra posted?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; &quot;The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone<br/>
&gt;&gt; tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get<br/>
&gt;&gt; batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the<br/>
&gt;&gt; person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and<br/>
&gt;&gt; cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in<br/>
&gt;&gt; and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does that also make sense? I&#39;m truly curious! The misunderstanding of  <br/>
what the list is about has been going on for years despite  <br/>
explanations. It&#39;s like trying to explain why a dolphin isn&#39;t a fish  <br/>
when most everything about it says &quot;fish&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569953966">Yes!  It is arriving.  (at least I got it when I joined)  And I want to say that my first post to the group wasnt exactly in keeping with the tone and purpose ( not intentionally :), and Sandra politely gave me some insight into that.  (which I appreciated )  I hope all those who have been redirected a bit, can understand and not take it personally.  On another unschooling group, a woman posted who &#39;has grown kids, but &quot;unschooled&quot; them&#39; supposedly , and she preceded to tell us how they had 4 basic principles in their home, and when someone does ___ they get sent to their room to reflect, &#39;but its their choice&#39;, and many other rules, etc.(her initail tone was VERY authoritarian   etc.......It wasnt unschooling at all.....and many people popped up to say so.......)She became offended, etc... then the &#39;debate&#39; started.    The group moderator stated that the purpose was to help others understand what unschooling is, and that that didnt sound like unschooling to her either.  But many felt it necessary to coddle and stroke the initial poster. She now is one of the main posters lately, and I can barely stand to read the posts.  The tone of the group seems lost,and the message mixed as to what unschooling and attachment parenting really are about.  I respect that this group stays true to its message.  I would hate for a newcomer to see those posts and assume for ex that making a 2 yold  pick up or he cant do ___ is unschooling.  <br/>
I like that the moderators are active here, and keep it on track.  :)<br/>

I know not everyone reads group stats, but in the past week there are  <br/>
8 new members and 312 new messages.  The list shows 2704 members, but  <br/>
I guess a third or so are not reading much if ever. There are over  <br/>
56,000 messages in the archives.  The search function works pretty  <br/>
well.  No one is required to read or post.  It&#39;s a project undertaken  <br/>
and mantained voluntarily, but I won&#39;t waste my time or the  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading on this list for several months now and really appreciate that Sandra and the other experienced unschoolers do not let that happen here.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if part of the confusion about the dissection of ideas is that some see unschooling as a way of learning that applies only to traditional academics and skills, while many others see it as a lifestyle. (In addition to not reading the welcome letter.) I&#39;ve known about unschooling for at least a decade, but it was only within the past three years that I started to examine and understand how it applies to other aspects of life.<br/>

I have been a member of this group for more than five years.  I have posted questions or comments perhaps three or four times in all those years.  I have read almost daily, initially to try and figure out what the heck I was doing with this idea of unschooling.  It was probably much further down the timeline from there that I began to see how much of my difficulties with wrapping my head around certain concepts or responses were due to my own history/beliefs/fears from long ago.  This group has greatly helped me to examine my thoughts and beliefs, has helped me be a much better partner to my child, a more thought-full person in the world.<br/>
<br/>
I never came here looking for friends or people to make me feel okay as a mom.  I came to this group to Learn, to examine and expand ideas and concepts.  It makes me think, and privately mull over unschooling as it is interpreted through our family&#39;s life.  Sometimes, in the past, simply reading posts and responses would make me very uncomfortable, but not anymore.  I am glad I have stayed all these years, and my entire family is happier and more relaxed for it.  And I am very thankful to those who take the time and care to post and point the way to seeing things from a different angle.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-837326437">I joined a few months ago, and received the letter. It was quite clear to me, but maybe also because I was told by a friend what kind of list this is.<br/>
<br/>
I find this heavily moderated list a very useful way of organizing both personal and more common information. I don&#39;t think it would help anyone who reads on this list because they want to know more about unschooling, if it was mildly moderated. <br/>
<br/>
I did need to get used to the style though, which is why I think the advice you get as a new member, to read for a few months(?) before you post, is very worthwhile. Also reading up on subjects that are of interest for your own situation on the web site is very helpful, and many questions can be answered by that, without even posting.<br/>

I am so deeply grateful that there are people on this list who are experienced, insightful, articulate, critical, aware and generous enough to hear a seemingly innocuous post and identify the possible blocks to unschooling hidden in the words. Actually I don&#39;t think the potential blocks were particularly hidden in the original post, and I learnt a lot  from the responses. <br/>
I have been reading on this list for about a year, my daughter is 19 months old and I am a single mother. I am deschooling, gradually beginning to understand the principles of unschooling, and slowly becoming aware of how to incorporate the ideas into our lives. I am becoming much better at hearing the voice in my head and questioning it before I speak or act. I often ask myself why something needs to be a certain way. I think asking why a child needs to put his toys away before going out to play is a fundamental question to explore in an unschooling home. Twyla (my daughter) asked for a banana half way through dinner tonight. The voice in my head said &quot;You need to finish your dinner first&quot;, but why, why did she need to finish her dinner first? I gave her the banana, she ate it, then she finished her salmon pasta, then she had some strawberries. If she had not finished her pasta that would have been okay too. She might have just wanted to open the banana and not eat it, she has just learned to do that herself and is very excited about it. She might have eaten half of it and come back for the rest later. Sometimes she asks for sultanas in the middle of dinner. Often she likes to be read only the first few pages of a book before moving on to the next one, or to just look at one page. Tonight she pretended the book we were reading was eating her foot, and thought it was hilarious. If something has to be a certain way then there are all kinds of surprises that can never happen. Having to clean up before going outside to play sounds like a rule to me, and I think it is worth at least asking yourself why it is necessary. You might find that your son is learning something vastly different than what you are hoping by refusing to let him go outside until it is done. <br/>
Thank you for the clarity and clear critical examination, it helps so much.<br/>

doing is working for them. Why would they? So it&#39;s not necessarily  <br/>
that they draw a line between academics and parenting but that they&#39;re  <br/>
applying unschooling to the parts that they&#39;re not liking the  <br/>
traditional approaches for.<br/>
<br/>
I also think part of the problem is that we&#39;re helping people  <br/>
&quot;unschool.&quot; But not everyone has the same definition of what  <br/>
unschooling is. So if someone on the list says &quot;That won&#39;t help  <br/>
unschooling,&quot; or &quot;That&#39;s not unschooling,&quot; they&#39;re defensively  <br/>
thinking &quot;It works for my definition of unschooling.&quot; I&#39;ve been trying  <br/>
recently to name a specific principle like relationships or natural  <br/>
learning that an idea supports rather than the not-universally-agreed- <br/>
on term unschooling and reserving the term unschooling for the big  <br/>
picture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-51175109">&quot;What I don&#39;t understand is why so many people felt like they had to take<br/>
apart her response and try to &quot;teach&quot; her the &quot;right&quot; way. She was only<br/>

<br/>
I think an analogy might help. A mother can say, &quot;we will go out for ice<br/>
cream after lunch&quot;.  This is a common exchange.<br/>
<br/>
 In an unschooling exchange where the goal is not to reward or punish a<br/>
child to finish a meal the mother may simply need to eat herself so she can<br/>
drive.  Lots of moms are short tempered from not eating or become tired.<br/>
She may, if the lunch is portable and the children anxious to get to the ice<br/>
cream parlour, eat her lunch en route.  Soup travels in a mug and a sandwich<br/>
is easily eaten while strolling.<br/>
<br/>
Conventionally when a mother says, &quot;ice cream after lunch&quot; she is making<br/>
lunch *the precondition *to getting ice cream.  Her intention is to withhold<br/>
ice cream in order to &quot;coerce&quot; her children into eating what she has decided<br/>
is a wholesome meal first.  She may not see it this way.  She may spout<br/>
something about consequences or even nutrition. But the fact is she is using<br/>
her power to coerce her child into jumping through hoops for the reward.  I<br/>
have heard many well-reasoned arguements from mothers explaining its just a<br/>
sequence of events, &quot;first we eat lunch and then we go for ice cream&quot;.  But<br/>
of course if the ice cream eating only happens after lunch it is a<br/>
reward/punishment scenario albeit thinly disguised.<br/>
<br/>
In both cases the children may eat lunch prior to going for ice cream with<br/>
their mothers.  In one case the children may not enjoy their treat as much<br/>
or may see it differently because it was not an option presented lovingly<br/>
but a threat used against them.<br/>
<br/>
 In a different scenario this lack of respect could even put the children at<br/>
risk from paedophiles because the children are preconditioned to accept pain<br/>
or to have their wills overridden or simply taught they have to obey adults<br/>
by adults they love.<br/>
<br/>
I remember as a new parent reading about a London abduction described by<br/>
Penelope Leach.  All the girls had been &quot;street&quot; proofed.  The girl who<br/>
saved the day was annoying to adults.  She didn&#39;t obey the strange man she<br/>
said because her dad would never send a strange man to pick her up from<br/>
school without telling her and he always told her it was okay to think for<br/>
herself and ask questions.  The strange man told the girls to be quiet, get<br/>
in his car and to stop questioning his authority because they would be in<br/>
big trouble from their dads.  They did as they were told, except the girl<br/>
who knew her dad would never punish her for asking questions and being<br/>
&quot;disobedient&quot;.  She told a teacher and the girls were unharmed.<br/>
<br/>
It is not  that people have issues with children contributing to making the<br/>
house nice or putting things away or cooking.  It is that when the child is<br/>
rewarded or punished for the contribution, many pointed out it was not<br/>
longer the child&#39;s gift of love but parental force driving the behaviour.<br/>

Another aspect to the problem of posts by too-new-to-unschooling  <br/>
writers is that the moderators could just reject them all in advance.   <br/>
Sometimes a post comes and I send it back to the writer and say &quot;This  <br/>
is likely to be torn apart; wait and read a week or so and if you  <br/>
still want to post it, you can.&quot;    I&#39;m not the only moderator.   <br/>
Sometimes when I go to return a post, it&#39;s already been approved by  <br/>
another moderator.  That&#39;s fine.  Sometimes when I go to approve a  <br/>
post, it&#39;s already been returned by another moderator.  That&#39;s fine too.<br/>
<br/>
More posts are let through than returned.  Sometimes I cringe when a  <br/>
post is approved because I know it will be pulled into its parts.    <br/>
Sometimes a post is so arrogant that I&#39;m glad to have it through so I  <br/>
can be the one to shine the light on it and say &quot;What!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I send a post back for the poster&#39;s own good and get a  <br/>
volley of insult on the side.<br/>
<br/>
If my goal were to make everyone happy who finds this list, I would  <br/>
feel &quot;I can never win.&quot;<br/>
As my goal is to make the list as much about the examination of  <br/>
unschooling as it can be, I can only win by sometimes shining a light  <br/>
on something and saying &quot;What!?&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1620810133">oops lost some text...should read below to make sense of my last post.<br/>
Other unschoolers wanted to step in and dictate to my kids how things should<br/>
proceed at our campfire.  Their rules around fire were kneejerk--kids can&#39;t<br/>
be trusted to hold matches.  It wasn&#39;t based on actual danger<br/>
avoidance(principles).  The reason behind a rule obfuscates real danger if<br/>
you focus on the rule.  The campfire was held to find a safe space to enjoy<br/>
fire.  So, another example of &quot;unschooling parents&quot; having rules rather than<br/>

Some people learn about lists and forums by jumping in with both feet. While its a way to learn a whole lot really fast for some people it also certainly generates more confusion and hurt feelings than a strategy of reading for a while before posting. <br/>
<br/>
An analogy that helped me, back when I was first getting used to unschooling discussions, was that of culture shock. Going from Chicago to TN, I experienced a good bit of culture shock - the difference between &quot;personal&quot; and &quot;impersonal&quot; for instance, in Chicago its the height of courtesy to be impersonal, while in TN the opposite is more nearly true. Parents expect parenting discussions to be personal the way &quot;y&#39;all come back now, y&#39;hear?&quot; and &quot;bless your heart&quot; are personal, and they get &quot;ideas not people&quot;. Its a shock, and because new people keep arriving, its a shock that happens over and over. <br/>

Maybe all unschoolers should be required to let their children play  <br/>
with matches.  I&#39;M JOKING.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I let guest kids light our fireplace, when they&#39;ve never  <br/>
been able to light a real fire before.<br/>
<br/>
I was at an unschooling event with a fire.  Kids were setting their  <br/>
marshmallows on fire and then wagging them around outside the fire pit  <br/>
instead of keeping a flaming sugar-ball over the fire.  NO parents  <br/>
were advising them to do differently.<br/>
<br/>
I left quietly.  My choices were to seem to turn into a fire-safety  <br/>
bitch, or to be somewhere else.  I was uninterested in seeing what  <br/>
would happen if a flaming marshmallow landed in someone&#39;s hair, on a  <br/>
baby, or just anywhere.  I hope after I was gone someone said  <br/>
something.    My kids weren&#39;t there; they probably would have said  <br/>
something.   If no one got hurt, that doesn&#39;t suggest that it was a  <br/>
good idea because no one got hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Had each of those children roasted marshmallows before that day, in  <br/>
quiet surroundings, with the advice of an adult who lived him or her,  <br/>
with some discussion of what&#39;s safe and good, there would have been  <br/>
many experienced people around that fire.  I suspect there were kids  <br/>
who weren&#39;t allowed to have marshmallows OR fire, and they were  <br/>
experimenting for the first time in a too-crowded area.  I suspect the  <br/>
parents thought their child was the only one without experience and  <br/>
that unschooling conferences should be all about crazy behavior.  They  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t be.<br/>
<br/>
There is yet another difficult concept rarely discussed.<br/>

the web site is very helpful, and many questions can be answered by that, <br/>
without even posting.***<br/>
<br/>
That is often true!  There have been times when I&#39;d have a question lying <br/>
underneath my thoughts.  I&#39;d just sit on it for a while and read and read and <br/>
read, and then the answers would come, or someone would come along and ask a <br/>
question and in the answers, by other people, I&#39;d get the answer that I was <br/>
looking for myself, even if the original question wasn&#39;t the same as mine!  <br/>
<br/>
I like to read though, so I read a lot about unschooling and unschooling related <br/>
things all over the internet almost everyday.  I think people should do that! <br/>
 There are so many things out there now that simply weren&#39;t before!  If you read <br/>
lots of things, you&#39;ll see the differences in the thinking here, that&#39;s more <br/>
clear than other places.  Many times, I&#39;ll be reading a really nice article on <br/>
unschooling or something related, and the person uses language like &quot;teach&quot;, or <br/>
&quot;self discipline&quot; or other similar things, and I&#39;ll think, &quot;oh, ok, well, maybe <br/>
not as clear about unschooling as they could be.&quot; That&#39;s not a big deal so much, <br/>
BUT it doesn&#39;t help people understand unschooling as well as it could, so those <br/>
things get picked apart here.  I think it&#39;s wonderfully refreshing!  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think this list is heavily moderated though, it&#39;s more that it&#39;s <br/>
hostesses attend to the needs of their guests, they&#39;re very proactive like that! <br/>
 They make sure that there is toilet paper in the bathroom and that everyone has <br/>
something to eat or drink and a comfortable place to sit, and then they <br/>
stimulate the conversations!<br/>

any stick on fire should stay in the fire, or dipped in water but not waved<br/>
at them.  They have left fires when kids or adults were being unsafe.  My<br/>
kids also know you don&#39;t put a pizza box on a roaring fire, because another<br/>
mom did and it light up and pieces of lit paper were everywhere!  I screamed<br/>
&quot;no stop&quot; as started to do it,  but she did it anyway.  Boy, did she blush<br/>
as it predictably made the fire unsafe.  See adults who don&#39;t learn about<br/>
fire feel that as adults they can be safer with something dangerous than<br/>
kids by reason of age:-)<br/>

Oddly enough one mom who was reprimanding Marty for being a &quot;control freak&quot;<br/>

Right!  My kids are older, 8 and 16, and when they figured out how to open a <br/>
banana like a monkey, they opened them all up because it was fun to do!  What <br/>
they didn&#39;t eat, I put in the freezer for making smoothies later.  The curious <br/>
exploration of the world, by my kids, has led to all kinds of creative thinking <br/>

 I love that about unschooling!  I know plenty of parents that would never have <br/>
allowed their children to open up all the bananas because it would have been <br/>
wasteful!  What really would have been wasted, was the opportunity to explore <br/>
and learn!  When others have said, especially Sandra, that learning is more <br/>
important, or that learning comes first, this is exactly how I have come to <br/>
understand it.  That &quot;YES&quot; we can open up all the bananas and learn how monkeys <br/>
do it, and that none of them will go to waste!<br/>

You can eat them in a pie -ie,<br/>

She&#39;d tipped the matches out onto the front room carpet and was trying to light one without success. So I suggested we take the box and matches into the garden where it was sunny and I&#39;d show her how to do it. Sitting together on the lawn, I showed her how I lit a match - look, I hold the box tight in one hand and I hold the match like this and so on. Then I handed my daughter the matchbox and watched her practice lighting matches until they were all used up. Then we got on with our day.<br/>

On my daughter&#39;s third birthday, she asked could she light the candles on her birthday cake (Thomas the Tank Engine!). Yes, of course, my wife handed over the box of matches she&#39;d had in her hand and our daughter took out a match, closed the box, lit the match and lit the three candles one by one as if it was something she did every day. I do remember the other five or six children there had their eyes popping out of their heads that my wife and I had allowed Bronwyn to do that. And how proud Bronnie was - not &quot;Ha!
