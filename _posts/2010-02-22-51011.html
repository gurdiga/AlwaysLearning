<div id="ygrps-yiv-169107674">Not to try to pick out &quot;non-writers&quot; from writers, but I know there  <br/>
are people here who read and read for years and don&#39;t write.  There  <br/>
are people who don&#39;t come to the chats because they don&#39;t type fast  <br/>
enough to keep up.  I understand that.  If there was a weekly  <br/>
unschooling water polo get-together I would not be there at all,  <br/>
because I don&#39;t know which is worse--water?  or balls coming toward my  <br/>
head.<br/>
<br/>
For a project LOTS of people will see for years, though, photos of  <br/>
unschooled kids are needed:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a link and some details.  News this morning is this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Any pictures are okay - doing stuff or close-ups - all fine...&quot;  and  <br/>
it&#39;s okay for there to be more than one of each child.  Send as many  <br/>
as you want.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter if they&#39;re current.  I sent some from when the kids  <br/>
were little.  All that matters is that they&#39;re not stock photos, but  <br/>
are real images of actual unschoolers.  It&#39;s for Unschooling: the  <br/>
Movie, Lee Stranahan&#39;s project.<br/>
<br/>
And for those who want to come to the chat, there&#39;s one later today.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular">http://sandradodd.com/chats/regular</a><br/>
and another one on Friday, for which I&#39;ll be in Fort Collins,  <br/>
Colorado, at Jill Parmer&#39;s house.  I&#39;ll look just the same in the  <br/>
chat, though.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
