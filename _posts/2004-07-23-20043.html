&lt;&lt; &quot;the most boring topic ever<br/>
rehashed on every damned email list I&#39;ve been on&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But Nancy, for some people it&#39;s their first round.<br/>
<br/>
Everybody has the same first set of first question, and eventually this one <br/>
comes up, because unschoolers are criticized by or accused of the sins of <br/>
Taking Children Seriously proponents.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll tell you something else that bugs me about it, but I&#39;ll tell a parallel <br/>
story first:<br/>
<br/>
Mothering Magazine.  Used to read it lots.  Changed my life.  Also pissed me <br/>
off.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you a Mothering mother?&quot;  Yeah.  Like those who find any fault with that <br/>
magazine aren&#39;t mothering their children.<br/>
<br/>
And so a &#39;movement&#39; calling itself &quot;taking children seriously&quot; suggests <br/>
pretty clearly that otherwise children aren&#39;t being taken seriously.  And that&#39;s <br/>
irritating, especially when they won&#39;t even TALK about children.<br/>
<br/>
I think this about my children and my husband and my mother and my dog:  In <br/>
MY life, they are mine.  In stories about me growing up, I had one mother, one <br/>
father.  I can tell stories about them without asking permission because I <br/>
can&#39;t tell the story of my life without mentioning them.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be a mother if I had no kids (18 years next Thursday), and so I <br/>
can&#39;t talk about being a mother without discussing my children.  They are a part <br/>
of my life.<br/>
<br/>
When people ask me for marital help (and they do, and have for as long as I <br/>
can remember), it matters that I&#39;ve been married twice, that Keith and I get <br/>
along really well, that we&#39;ve been through some of the same kinds of <br/>
frustrations and worked through them.  That matters to the people who are asking me, and <br/>
it matters to me as an advisor.<br/>
