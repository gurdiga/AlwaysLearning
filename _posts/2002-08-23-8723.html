Aaaaw, how cute Sharon!  We have a VERY large  snapping turtle that loves the <br/>
pool at the end of the drainage pipe, on the edge of our woods. He does not <br/>
love us the way Brer loves you guys, but he&#39;s fun to watch. We&#39;ve dubbed him <br/>
&quot;Big Mo&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2042477855">I recently came across a book I read about two years<br/>
ago called Living Joyfully with Children by Winn and<br/>
Bill Sweet.  I remember at the time thinking they were<br/>
a bit wacked, but now as I flip through the book and<br/>
look at my notes some of it makes some sense, but some<br/>
stuff I am not so sure.  <br/>
<br/>
My question is has anyone else read this book and what<br/>
were your thoughts on it.<br/>
