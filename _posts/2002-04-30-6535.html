&gt;  attention, since she&#39;d been a keynote speaker at a homeschooling conference<br/>
&gt;  I attended.  She or one of the other guests suggested you think about what<br/>
&gt;  you wanted to be when you grew up when you were 10 years old, that that<br/>
&gt;  would give you the best idea of what you truly should do.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At 10, I wanted to be a nun.  I probably would have done it, too -- but my <br/>
chosen order closed its aspirancy when I was 14 and it&#39;s postulancy when I <br/>
was 16.  By 18 I didn&#39;t want to do it anymore. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I loved and excelled in English lit. but thought those jobs would be boring.  <br/>
I went into physical anthropology and various kinds of &quot;ed&quot; in college -- <br/>
same-oh for those jobs.  I decided to switch to science -- where the &quot;real <br/>
jobs&quot; were, LOL!  I went into medical technology (late) and worked my butt <br/>
off.  After graduation I loved my job -- for 5 years.  Then I shifted into <br/>
public speaking, the &quot;Human Potential Movement&quot; (remember that?? &lt;G&gt;), and <br/>
management consulting and training for another 7 years.  <br/>
<br/>
Being with my kids is my longest held job.  And my daily life pretty much <br/>
involves &#39;all of the above&#39; (well, maybe except the nun part) &lt;G&gt;.  I&#39;m sure <br/>
glad I didn&#39;t pigeon hole myself too much by virtue of my current interests <br/>
at any one time.  My kids show me that every day, too....<br/>
