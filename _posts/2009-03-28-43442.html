<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056612371">I was looking for a quote I was half remembering, about teaching and  <br/>
simple language.  It was something about if one doesn&#39;t understand it  <br/>
well enough to put it in simple terminology, that they&#39;re not ready to  <br/>
teach it.   Maybe I learned it in an education class, to be  <br/>
remembering it in that context.<br/>
<br/>
I found this list of quotes, and some of them are great:<br/>

<br/>
Off and on over the day I looked.   I&#39;ve found what might be what I  <br/>
was thinking of:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you can&#39;t explain it simply, you don&#39;t understand it well enough.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s credited to Albert Einstein. I tried to find a source, but  <br/>
failed.  If anyone knows when or where it was said or written, I&#39;d  <br/>
appreciate seeing it in context.<br/>
<br/>
For a combination of reasons, I&#39;ve always liked the fact that inside  <br/>
of English is its root language, ancient and powerful.  Then there&#39;s a  <br/>
blanket of Latin and French over the top of it all, with history in  <br/>
the Norman Conquest and the Catholic Church and all kinds of medieval  <br/>
history, and yet there are words there that are 1500 years old, give  <br/>
or take a few hundred years, and they were words in long-forgotten  <br/>
European tribes before that.<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah.   I love those words:<br/>

<br/>
When I teach advanced economics courses, I have an exercise in which my <br/>
students write about rather complex issues without using any economics <br/>
jargon. It means they can&#39;t make assumptions about what the other person <br/>
knows, they can&#39;t take short-cuts, and they have to far more thoroughly <br/>
explain their reasoning. This is a fantastic exercise for helping them <br/>
uncover what they don&#39;t, themselves, fully understand.<br/>
<br/>
  It isn&#39;t an insult to their intelligence to ask them to do this, it is <br/>
only those with the deepest understanding who find it easy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1490443579">Dear Sandra<br/>
The quote i believe comes from this ancient French quote from Nicolas Boileau<br/>
Ce que l&#39;on conçoit bien s&#39;énonce clairement, <br/>
Et les mots pour le dire arrivent aisément.&quot; Nicolas Boileau Art poétique, Chant I, vers 153-154, an de grâce 1674.<br/>
<br/>
Which translates into  English<br/>
<br/>
&#39;&#39;the well formed though comes out clearlyand the words to express it come easily&#39;&#39;<br/>
An art that you master quite a bit ! lol<br/>
