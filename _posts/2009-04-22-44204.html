<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078912433">Yesterday the quote on Leslie Buchanan&#39;s quote of the week list <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Quoteoftheweek@yahoogroups.com">Quoteoftheweek@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
inspired me to write a thank you letter to Holly&#39;s flower-shop mentor,  <br/>
the owner of Stems.  I wanted to share the response with this list.<br/>

Someone sent this quote out today:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by  <br/>
doing them.&quot;<br/>
~Aristotle<br/>
<br/>
This reminded me of Holly&#39;s experiences at Stems.     Thank you again,  <br/>
Katie, for giving her this chance to learn things that can only be  <br/>
learned by doing.<br/>

Debbie and I were just talking about how the only way to learn is by  <br/>
DOING!  We really appreciate Holly.  :-)  She has a lovely personality  <br/>
too!<br/>

This little snippet gets better and better to me.  I really think you are not only on to something very, very, cool, but you have probably started something as well (besides all the other stuff :))  I love all the chances to ask &quot;why not?&quot;<br/>
