<div id="ygrps-yiv-712779310">Joyce made me a gift three years ago, and it was a visual game we played at Radical Unschooling Info.<br/>
<br/>
Today I’ve put it up in such a way that people can play now and in the future. <br/>
<br/>
It’s a Learn Nothing Day gift, so if you’re still not learning, don’t look at it.  But if your July 24 is over, or if your courageous mission not to learn has been otherwise thwarted, here y’go:<br/>

<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
If you’re young, not much into old TV, or if you’re far from the U.S., it might be too hard, so don’t score or worry, just goof with it.  Even kids will probably know a few of them.<br/>
<br/>
Your friend,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  As I write this, late Sunday night at my house, four of them are sketchy but the rest are nicely filled in.  Still, you can check your guesses, and I’ll finish up in a couple of days.</div>
