<br/>
Did you read those pages or just glance?<br/>
I thought it was explained pretty well.  But if you&#39;re very new to  <br/>
unschooling, it can take a while to relax into the place where  <br/>
everything starts to look like one big world of input and choices.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I doubt it, since you don&#39;t have a TV and I have a couple or three  <br/>
thousand books, and have bought three in the past week, and am antsy  <br/>
to get some back that I loaned out.<br/>
<br/>
I like books fine.  I don&#39;t like book-snobbery.  I dislike the  <br/>
ignorant assumption that reading any book is better than watching any  <br/>
movie, or that reading any book is better than singing or riding a  <br/>
bike or working in the garden, or that reading a book without  <br/>
pictures is superior to reading a book with pictures.<br/>

What you like and what I like might not be what our kids like, but  <br/>
without letting them make decisions, how will they know what they like?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864437465">Here&#39;s an interesting thing.<br/>
<br/>
My wife and I have two children born ten years apart.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve always allowed both of our children to do whatever they like. <br/>
Watch TV all day long, if that&#39;s what they want. Whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Our daughter excelled throughout 12 years at school in the UK and <br/>
Australia. Including three years at a posh private all girls school <br/>
in London where she excelled amongst the excellent. She graduated <br/>
from high school here in 2002 in the top 1% of students in the <br/>
Australian Capital Territory. She&#39;s currently in the final year of a <br/>
five year Law degree at the University of Canberra and a degree in <br/>
Forensic Science at the Canberra Institute of Technology that she&#39;s <br/>
been running alongside it for the past three years. She already has a <br/>
BA that she completed two years ago. She was inspired to take the <br/>
degree in Forensic Science by watching CSI on TV.<br/>
<br/>
Our son went to school for two years before my wife and I took him <br/>
out in 2002 at his request, since when he&#39;s been at home with me. <br/>
The &#39;house rules&#39; that were operational before he went to school have <br/>
continued to apply. He can do whatever he likes. Amongst other <br/>
things, what he likes most of all is playing videogames and watching <br/>
TV. So that&#39;s what he does most of the time. When he was at school, <br/>
he spent most of his second year in a remedial reading class. He came <br/>
out of school hating books and refuses to read them. He hasn&#39;t had a <br/>
reading lesson since he left school, yet his reading is excellent. <br/>
His critical thinking is excellent. Nobody taught him that. He <br/>
learned it by osmosis. How far ahead he is of where I was when I was <br/>
his age in his understanding of the world he lives in is truly <br/>
awesome. Playing video games, watching TV and DVDs gives him constant <br/>
access to learning opportunities that are denied to children confined <br/>
to school classrooms for most of their time. His latest interest is <br/>
CSI.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom of choice is a far deeper - and more important - issue than <br/>
what people appear to be doing on the surface. <br/>
<br/>
Some random neural firings. :)<br/>

What do you fear will happen if your kids watch TV and play (I assume  <br/>

Basically your question is saying: &quot;I know the dangers of TV and  <br/>
video games. Why would unschoolers expose their children to such?  <br/>
Are  they ignorant of the dangers? Don&#39;t they care?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are other possibilities:<br/>
<br/>
That we know something about TV and video games that you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
That we know that with pressures and limitations and stress that  <br/>
children (and adults) make different choices than they do when in an  <br/>
environment of freedom where interests are treated with respect.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a lot of words -- almost like a book ;-) about TV and games at:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>

If you scroll down on the left there are sections on video games and  <br/>
TV that probably cover any fears you have.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; but I probably dislike TV a little more than you dislike books.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think a better interpretation of what Sandra has said on her site  <br/>
is &quot;dislike book worship.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re trapped in a room with no access to the real world out  <br/>
there beyond the walls and the only way to experience the world is  <br/>
through the books in the room, then books are really important.<br/>
<br/>
If you have 30 students that you need to pour x amount of knowledge  <br/>
into, then being able to hand the knowledge to the kids in the form  <br/>
of a book makes the process run smoothly and, most importantly, cheaply.<br/>
<br/>
If you live in the 19th century where the easiest (and for some only)  <br/>
way for you to access the world is through the printed word, then  <br/>
books and newspapers and magazines are really important.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve grown up in a society where the Ultimate Truth is contained  <br/>
in one holy book, then the written word seems to hold a special power.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a bit of the source of our worship of books. But it isn&#39;t the  <br/>
books that deserve our appreciation. It&#39;s the ability to transport  <br/>
ourselves to different worlds and different times. It&#39;s the ability  <br/>
to visit Africa and Mars and Hogwarts. It&#39;s the ability to hear the  <br/>
words of people who are dead or thousands of miles away or speak a  <br/>
different language. The printed word is no longer our only access. It  <br/>
isn&#39;t even the best access.<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;not the best&quot; doesn&#39;t mean worthless. &quot;Not the best&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>
even mean &quot;not as good as&quot;. It just means there are other resources  <br/>
that are worthy of appreciation depending on our needs and interests.<br/>
<br/>
By putting books on a pedestal we devalue other resources that are  <br/>
just as valuable, and, depending on the person or the situation, even  <br/>
more valuable. A visual person won&#39;t get as much from a book as a  <br/>
video (or from experiencing it). A subject that&#39;s highly visual like  <br/>
an erupting volcano, a Shakespeare play ;-), a running cheetah have  <br/>
their essence stripped from them when reduced to words on a page or a  <br/>
still picture. In fact it&#39;s down right arrogant for those who learn  <br/>
well through reading to disparage visual interpretations of stories  <br/>
as being &quot;less than&quot;. Visual people (like artists) need to absorb  <br/>
visuals as word people (like writers) need to absorb words.<br/>
<br/>
Books don&#39;t need to be on a pedestal any more. Nor do they need to be  <br/>
kicked out of the club. They are part of a tapestry of access to the  <br/>
world that includes visiting and TV and videos and CDs and the  <br/>
internet and playing and video games and talking and lectures and ...<br/>

While my daughter can do anything she likes, she&#39;s in a family where  <br/>
we&#39;re all interconnected. She isn&#39;t off on her own. She&#39;s living in a  <br/>

When someone *can&#39;t* do anything they want, then what they imagine  <br/>
would happen if they could do anything they want doesn&#39;t match the  <br/>
reality of those who live with that freedom.<br/>
<br/>
When someone&#39;s TV is controlled, when they grasp to get as much as  <br/>
they want, when they&#39;re occasionally given the freedom to watch and  <br/>
find that they glut and watch even &quot;garbage&quot;, they assume that&#39;s the  <br/>
natural state of themselves (or human beings in general). That  <br/>
without adults controlling us until we&#39;re old enough to have absorbed  <br/>
the controls and obey them we assume we&#39;d all be eating ice cream and  <br/>
snack food and watching TV endlessly.<br/>
<br/>
The reality is much different. When kids have the freedom to watch as  <br/>
much TV as they want, they watch as much as they want, they read as  <br/>
long as they want, they play with friends as long as they want and  <br/>
then go do something else they want. They may watch more than parents  <br/>
feel comfortable with. They may watch programs the parents wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
have chosen for them. But they don&#39;t watch 24/7. When they know they  <br/>
can have access anytime they want, then there isn&#39;t the tension to  <br/>
cram in as much as they can.<br/>
<br/>
Just as when a crisis is looming (a big storm for instance) that  <br/>
makes food feel limited so people hit the grocery stores in droves,  <br/>
stock piling food, it doesn&#39;t continue after people are certain the  <br/>
limitations have passed. They go back to shopping when they need and  <br/>
want.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-197700501">Hi, Joyce<br/>
<br/>
I found in the beginning that, while my wife and I did wonder if we <br/>
were giving our daughter permission to be glued to the TV screen all <br/>
day long, what actually happened was she went through a phase of <br/>
watching TV or videos for hours on end for only a matter of weeks and <br/>
then it completely tailed off to an occasional thing. Knowing she <br/>
could watch TV or videos whenever she liked, it became no big deal.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been the same with our son, pretty much. He has a genuine <br/>
passion for videogames and will play them for hours on end. Sometimes <br/>
I play, too, but he&#39;s so far ahead of me, if I do sit in, it&#39;s <br/>
usually to watch him play. The TV, videos and DVDs meanwhile have <br/>
become more occasional interests.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I suppose it might sound like hands off parenting, and the point <br/>
you make about this being integrated into family life, rather than it <br/>
being a case of &quot;go off and do something&quot;, is very important to <br/>
understand. Also, that, just because there&#39;s no control doesn&#39;t mean <br/>
there&#39;s no influence, if I&#39;m honest and open about my personal <br/>
feelings. Perhaps supervision without intervention might describe <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
Not that it&#39;s always supervision. I&#39;m a big fan in my own right of <br/>
things like Spongebob Squarepants, Ed, Edd &#39;n&#39; Eddie and Jimmy <br/>
Neutron, etc.<br/>

<br/>
Pprobably you just haven&#39;t ever been in any unschoolers homes. :) I&#39;ve <br/>
visited unschoolers all across the country, and the one thing so far they&#39;ve all had <br/>
in common is bookcases. Stuffed bookcases. Bookcases stuffed with books, <br/>
even, as well as stuffed with puzzles and games and videos and just plain stuffed. <br/>
I love poking through other people&#39;s bookcases - it&#39;s fun for me to see what <br/>
they have that I also have, and even more fun to find new things beside old <br/>
familiar things. <br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s my house. I have a book fetish. It&#39;s sad, really. There are too <br/>
many books for them all to be out and displayed in ways that make them <br/>
available to everyone living here without having to ask me for help. *I* know what&#39;s <br/>
in the house and where it is, but except for a few key collections actually in <br/>
bookcases (still thousands of books) the family hasn&#39;t a clue. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure you dislike TV a WHOLE LOT MORE than I dislike books. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway. I&#39;m inspired to tell a story I&#39;m pretty sure I haven&#39;t shared on <br/>
these lists before.<br/>
<br/>
I used to be very anti video game. In 1981 my parents gave me an <br/>
Intellivision system as a present for my then 3yo son. Oh man. I played and played and <br/>
played that game. I was obsessed. Well, that convinced me for sure. These things <br/>
are dangerously addictive. I controlled the time my kid could play the games <br/>
and I absolutely refused to buy that cool Nintendo system we kept hearing <br/>
about. It was too good.<br/>
<br/>
And there things stayed for a very very long time. Eventually we got <br/>
computers and some computer gaming entered my kids lives, but still, I wasn&#39;t going to <br/>
have those video game systems in MY house. Too addictive.<br/>
<br/>
In 1999 my younger son Patrick, then age 7, brought home a Game Boy Color <br/>
system from his best friend&#39;s house. His friend had loaned him the system for the <br/>
week because he wanted Patrick to level him up in the game they were <br/>
currently working on. I decided the best response was just to let him play it as much <br/>
as he wanted, not fight over it, given that the system would only be there for <br/>
a limited time. Well. The game boy sat in my son&#39;s room almost all week <br/>
unplayed, then the last two days he remembered he&#39;d promised his friend he would <br/>
play the game for him so spent a lot of time making up for forgetting it all <br/>
week.<br/>
<br/>
I thought about that a lot. First, the kid was really good at the games with <br/>
very restricted access. Why was I withholding from him something he was very <br/>
skilled at? Second, clearly the games were not addicting for him. He&#39;d had the <br/>
game with free access and even knowing he&#39;d be returning it at the end of the <br/>
week he&#39;d chosen other things.<br/>
<br/>
All three of my kids still living at home received Game Boy Color systems for <br/>
Christmas that year. (They were then 15, 7 and 7) I have wonderful pictures <br/>
of the three of them sitting around together playing those games. They played <br/>
for many many many days straight. <br/>
<br/>
Since then we&#39;ve had a video game explosion around here. I bought a Nintendo <br/>
64 system for the house, and many games. Patrick saved for and bought a used <br/>
Game Cube system. Sarah saved for and bought a Playstation 2 system. They <br/>
bought an Xbox system together. I gifted the family with the new Wii system a few <br/>
months ago. They&#39;ve moved on through the Game Boy Advance systems to the <br/>
Nintendo DS. I got my own handheld systems and play with my kids. Patrick found an <br/>
original Nintendo Entertainment System at a rummage sale, boxed, with two <br/>
controllers, the gun controller, and several games, for 5 bucks. That sent him on a <br/>
quest to collect &quot;vintage&quot; video games, the Nintendo systems and games from <br/>
before he was a player (many from before he was born). We tracked down copies <br/>
of old text adventure games for the computers, even. (Zork, Hitchhikers Guide <br/>
to the Universe)<br/>
<br/>
They love video games. They play a lot of them. They save to buy games, trade <br/>
games with friends, have video game parties. When they have new games they <br/>
sometimes play very late into the night. They&#39;re on a first name basis with the <br/>
staff at the Game Crazy Store. And yet... the video games, beloved as they <br/>
are, are just a small part of their very big lives.<br/>
<br/>
Patrick takes a bike ride every day of the year that there isn&#39;t ice on the <br/>
streets. Sarah rides several days a week, usually longer rides to places she <br/>
can sketch nature. Patrick is outside many hours every day - now that it&#39;s warm <br/>
the block teens are playing kickball in the street some afternoons, or he&#39;s <br/>
off with his skateboarding pals in the schoolyard :) or at the skatepark, or <br/>
fishing the lagoon, or up a tree. They read books, watch movies, go to watch <br/>
Shakespeare with a group of friends. Patrick works at learning guitar, engages in <br/>
long philosophical discussions, and ponders the mysteries of physics and the <br/>
calculus. Sarah sketches, paints, and works on her novel. And they play video <br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
Today we drove two hours (roadwork! Grrr) into the city so Sarah could have <br/>
her dance injured hip examined by a specialist. Both Patrick and Sarah have <br/>
been playing the new Pokemon games for DS this week. Patrick brought his DS <br/>
along. Sarah brought a book. It was all good.<br/>
<br/>
I regret the time I spent fearing video games. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-219684380">Both of my children have been allowed unlimited access to TV, video games<br/>
and computer.  My oldest, 16, hates the TV, only spends large amounts of<br/>
time on the computer when there is nothing else going on and seldom plays<br/>
video games.  She loves to read but dislikes most books, seem to gravitate<br/>
towards instructional material.  She taught herself to read and write with<br/>
me available to answer questions and she now has a vocabulary and<br/>
comprehension which would carry her through any college level.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest, 9, taught himself to read via video games and computer, he<br/>
taught himself to spell and type via computer.  He has a vocabulary and<br/>
comprehension well beyond most teenagers I know.  He loves to read and does<br/>
most of that on the computer.  He has not felt the need for extensive<br/>
handwriting yet and I am content that he will master that skill with the<br/>
same speed and ease that he did with all others.<br/>
<br/>
I could have forced all of these skills and then credited myself with the<br/>
results, or perhaps a school could claim some of that thunder.  The TRUTH is<br/>
that they learn every second of every day and are as delighted to gain new<br/>
skills as they are to play.  Work, learning and play have very blurred<br/>
boundaries in our world and that delights me.<br/>
<br/>
Had I placed limits or value on any of their preferred activities they may<br/>
have seen learning as work and that would be a shame.<br/>
