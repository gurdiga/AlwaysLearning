<div id="ygrps-yiv-619236526">These are all good movies, some great, all intense:<br/>
<br/>
Apocolypse Now<br/>
Full Metal Jacket<br/>
The Deer Hunter<br/>
Platoon<br/>
Schindler&#39;s List<br/>
Three Kings<br/>
Empire of the Sun<br/>
Saving Private Ryan<br/>
Bridge on the River Kwai<br/>
They Were Expendable<br/>
Run Silent, Run Deep<br/>
Das Boot<br/>
Retreat Hell<br/>
The Longest Day<br/>
<br/>
Ha- and  I would have said I don&#39;t really like war movies!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658244760">Our library branch bought the whole PBS series<br/>
&quot;Vietnam&quot; It is surprisingly good. DH even watched all<br/>
of it.  He refuses to view any movies that<br/>
fictionalize or dramatize that war. Perhaps a library<br/>
somewhere has this series?<br/>
<br/>
Will Lars read for info? If so I can put together a<br/>
list of book suggestions.  <br/>
<br/>
Food (cook books, resteraunts), dance (religious and<br/>
secular), biology (flora and fauna...snakes etc) might<br/>
extend his interest. He might enjoy seeing a Veterans<br/>
Honoring Dance at a pow-wow.<br/>
<br/>
Is there a veterans organization that meets somewhere?<br/>
If so, there are probably local vets who would allow<br/>
him to sit in on meetings, or perhaps they have<br/>
literature or someone has photographs (and personal<br/>
comments...take with a grain of salt) to share.<br/>
Actually take all of it with salt. History is created<br/>
in the telling.<br/>
<br/>
MASH  was Korea. Similar. But way different, too.<br/>

that lists movies by subject. It might even break them down by particular<br/>
war.<br/>

interested.  I finally found out which one he&#39;s watching.  It&#39;s called Tour <br/>
of Duty.  It&#39;s on every weekday.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He won&#39;t, but I read to him when he wants.  Historical fiction about the <br/>
war would probably catch his interest, such as it is at this point.  (I <br/>
don&#39;t want to go whole hog unless he does.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Probably not a whole lot of Vietnam vets here in Canada.  &lt;g&gt;  I do have a <br/>
good friend who was a deserter, but he doesn&#39;t like to talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
