<div id="ygrps-yiv-896368978">Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
Here are the links I sent to Nichol regarding links for Australian home<br/>
educators.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>

Karen wrote - re natural learning:- We love it, I find it easy, the weather<br/>
encourages lots of outdoors activities ie swimming, walks, park days, more<br/>
swimming, cycling, blading or just hangin&#39; outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
It is legal to home educate in all States and Territories of Australia.<br/>
Registration is a bit of an issue for some (us included I don&#39;t agree with<br/>
it) but apparently it is quite easy to register in Qld at the moment.  There<br/>
are new laws re home education coming into force next year (07) in our state<br/>
and so the new government body - sorry I can&#39;t think of the name  but<br/>
something official sounding like HomeSchooling Support Board - is<br/>
encouraging people to register and making it quite easy from the sounds of<br/>
it.  Victoria is going through changes at the moment. NSW sounds fairly easy<br/>
to register (or not!).  South Australia sounds okay as well - Beverly Paines<br/>
site is a good place to look for SA information.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that there are a large number of unregistered home educators in<br/>
my state and a fair few of them are unschoolers or natural learners.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some links for you:-<br/>
<br/>
HEA Australia - a good starting point - links to people around Australia<br/>
www.hea.asn.au<br/>
<br/>
Education Choices - this is a magazine site but has a link to a blog by<br/>
Eleanor Sparkes - Eleanor is very active in keeping up to date on the legal<br/>
side of home ed in Queensland. Eleanor is also linked to a group called<br/>
Brisbane Natural Learners<br/>
www.educationchoices.com.au<br/>
<br/>
Home Education Victoria - based in the state of Victoria<br/>
www.home-ed.vic.edu.au<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to email me direct with any questions any time.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
