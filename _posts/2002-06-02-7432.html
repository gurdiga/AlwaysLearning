<div id="ygrps-yiv-1873212892">I&#39;m quoting from private e-mail, so don&#39;t think you missed something, but...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So do you consider me booked to the point that I should start telling people<br/>
&gt; to go to Houston to hear me if they can&#39;t make it to South Carolina?  If you<br/>
&gt; want me to wait to say anything I will.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Yes, you&#39;re booked!  Go ahead and start spreading the word.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So.  I want to take NOTHING away from the glorious big conference Kelly is <br/>
putting on, which is the seasonal event of the north-American Atlantic coast <br/>
this year, but *if* there are people here in the southwest who couldn&#39;t <br/>
possibly make it to South Carolina in October, you might want to consider a <br/>
smaller, quieter conference in Houston.<br/>

Now featuring me! (And now I get to see some Texas buddies of mine!)<br/>
<br/>
Many of you area aware of this, but although Texas and New Mexico are <br/>
touching (for a long long way), Houston is NOwhere near Albuquerque.   850 <br/>
miles.  About as far as Houston to Florida.  Seems wrong, but there it is.  <br/>
So I&#39;ll be flying.<br/>
