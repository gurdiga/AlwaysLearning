<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551226693">Hi All, <br/>
I&#39;m a lurker and have been greatly encouraged on many occasions by the<br/>
posts on this forum.  I would like to post now because I am so proud<br/>
of my daughter.  Two days ago she decided she wanted to read &quot;George&#39;s<br/>
Marvellous Medicine&quot; to me and she said it was because one of her<br/>
friends (who reads fluently) reads to her mum at night.  I said ok and<br/>
she got along fine with  me helping her on unknown words(quite a few<br/>
as she only reads what the schools call &quot;sight words&quot; for eg.  it, on,<br/>
and, the, etc., which she has just picked up by herself along the<br/>
way).  So we did that last night  as well and she surprised me by<br/>
being able to read a few more words than I thought she knew.<br/>
Then tonight, oh my goodness if she doesn&#39;t go and read the word<br/>
&quot;ceiling&quot; (and quite a few other words which I was sure she had no<br/>
idea how to read).  So now I get suspicious because I know I certainly<br/>
haven&#39;t taught her how to read all these words, so I ask her if she&#39;s<br/>
been having secret reading lessons and she tells me that she has been<br/>
able to read since her 7th birthday(31/12/07.  I ask her how she<br/>
managed this and she says, in the times she has been upstairs and<br/>
reading books for 5 or 10 minutes, she has &quot;just worked out the<br/>
words&quot;.  So I&#39;m not satisfied becos I can&#39;t quite believe it(I take a<br/>
lot of convincing!) and she says she can read  in her head but she<br/>
just takes longer to read out loud becos she&#39;s not sure how to say the<br/>
words.  I kind of know what she means...I think she&#39;s saying she can<br/>
&quot;see&quot; the words in her head and is recognising the patterns and<br/>
arrangements of the letters but couldn&#39;t quite &quot;get them out&quot;.  I was<br/>
just amazed and then tonight to see it all &quot;fall into place&quot; was a<br/>
privilege.  I could tell she was &quot;seeing patterns&quot; because if for eg.<br/>
she saw &quot;scrunching&quot; she was saying &quot;scratching&quot; . But ceiling amazed<br/>
me the most becos there is no way that can be worked out phonetically,<br/>
so how she did it?.....well.....she just did.  Just as she was falling<br/>
asleep she said there was one other way she worked out how to read and<br/>
that was by seeing the words on the page as I was reading to her.<br/>
So just thought I&#39;d share.  I unschool but have my days were I doubt<br/>
that I&#39;m doing the right thing for my children (I have 2 more ds 3 and<br/>
dd 20 months).  We do no workbooks, no curriculum, nothing like school<br/>
at all, just live life and have fun.  <br/>
Thankyou for being here and your reassuring posts which I am sure I<br/>
will continue to need.<br/>
Blessings<br/>
