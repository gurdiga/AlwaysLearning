<div id="ygrps-yiv-807784193">(A discussion on Unschooling.com list suggested there was a lot of <br/>
traffic to keep up with. I was on the Webgrrls list for years, for <br/>
women web designers, and on that list there was so much traffic it <br/>
was difficult for most of us to keep up. So, when people asked <br/>
questions, they would request e-mail answers &quot;off list&quot; and afterward <br/>
create a summary. That way, it was much easier to *keep up* with list <br/>
traffic AND, best of all, to *file* topics for reference. Here&#39;s how, <br/>
if anyone wants to try it.<br/>
<br/>
I write to the list saying my 12 year old boy, who has been offered <br/>
his freedom :), becomes worried about the loss of social scene. I <br/>
collect the answers (mailto:<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:gw@...">gw@...</a>) from all you <br/>
great people, and compile the following and send it in with the <br/>
original question and a Subject heading: SUMMARY: Social Scene)<br/>

&lt;&lt;His friends from school will hang with him even when he&#39;s out of<br/>
school---just afternoons and weekends. If they aren&#39;t his friends, they<br/>
won&#39;t. He could also make a few homeschooled friends through local groups.<br/>
You could come to the conference where he&#39;ll meet a few teens that could lead<br/>
to long-term long-distance friends. Not Back to School Camp could also be an<br/>
option.<br/>
<br/>

Kelly,<br/>
Thanks. I do hope we can find some home school groups. We live in <br/>
Northern VA -- Manassas to be exact. I will be hanging on the lists <br/>
through the summer lurking to find groups. Also, what is &quot;Not Back to <br/>
School Camp&quot;. Are these offered only in SC?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Does he like sports?  My son has found plenty of friends through his sports<br/>
teams.  If not, what *does* he like?  Can you sign him up for classes or<br/>
workshops in something that interests him?<br/>
Tia&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That would be perfect. He is in a *break dancing class* right now, <br/>
running Sep-June. Not too many kids there, though. He is interested <br/>
in drum lessons (another post on BAND issues coming up.) His main <br/>
interest is video games.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I am now teaching in a middle school.  There are lots of ways you can<br/>
have your son hook up with kids his age.  Sports, summer classes,<br/>
church groups, homeschooling groups with teens in it (we have a great<br/>
one) etc.  But please, don&#39;t think the social scene that happens at a<br/>
middle school positive for middle school students.  It simply isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
My experience as a teacher again confirms why I will never send my<br/>
children to school.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Where is this &quot;great teen group &quot; located?? Thanks for the words of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Where do you live?<br/>
<br/>
-pam&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We live in Northern VA -- Manassas to be exact.  In the woods, not in <br/>
a neighborhood with lots of kids. WE ARE lucky that his best friend <br/>
is a few houses down.<br/>
<br/>
Bless you all!<br/>

Run by Grace Llewellyn, author of The Teenage Liberation Handbook. The main <br/>
one is in Oregon? Washington? West coast. There&#39;s another in West Virginia; <br/>
last year was the first time there. I&#39;m guessing its a &quot;go&quot; this year. She <br/>
was hoping to get enough campers to make it worth hosting again.<br/>

And there&#39;s a group in No Va. The &quot;leader&quot; is playing in England right now. <br/>
She&#39;ll be back in July, I think.<br/>
<br/>
Another No VA member may pipe up.<br/>
