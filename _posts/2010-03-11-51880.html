<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046706162">I have 2 daughters (6 1/2 and 3 yrs) and am expecting another baby in about a month.  My energy level is going down toward the end of this pregnancy and also we&#39;re trying to &quot;fit everything in&quot; before the baby is born.  By &quot;everything&quot; I mean the drama class my daughter desperately wanted to take and classes at the nature center, gym days, playdates, etc.  I&#39;m definitely doubting the wisdom of loading everything on right now, but my very social older daughter jumps at all of these opportunities if I offer them. <br/>
<br/>
My question is:  what activities, ideas, or thoughts have been most helpful for unschoolers as they go through the transition of adding a new life?  I&#39;m a little worried about my ability to keep up with my current daughters as well as giving birth, healing, and caring for a new little one in our family.<br/>
<br/>
My husband works full time (plus some), and is going out of town next week for work (probably adding to my anxiety)and we don&#39;t have grandparents or other family nearby.  I&#39;m looking forward to your input.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

It wouldn&#39;t be easier if the oldest were in school, though. You&#39;d need  <br/>
to get her up in the morning, dressed, homework, lunch...<br/>
<br/>
So don&#39;t look at it as an unschooling problem.<br/>

There might be other moms who would be glad to take her for gasoline  <br/>
or lunch money for them and their kids.<br/>

Maybe you could have playdates at your house. Maybe the moms will  <br/>
bring you food or do your dishes!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I waited to answer but I haven&#39;t seen you get a lot of replies yet, so I&#39;ll say a few things.<br/>
<br/>
My kids are spaced very much like yours, about 3 years apart. I didn&#39;t give birth to #3, so didn&#39;t have that pregnancy-and-recovery piece, but she seems to have responded to me being a &quot;replacement&quot; mom by deciding that I should hold her all the time, waking or sleeping, for the first three months of her life. David and I figure we did literally hold her (or have her in the sling) about 23 1/2 hours a day for those months. So I know a little bit about the challenges.<br/>
<br/>
As far as activities, depending on your energy level and motivation, you can either remind yourself that a baby in a sling is incredibly portable and just go do stuff anyway, or settle in to enjoying a quiet time with your kids. We watched a lot of movies together, played video games, played board games, and also went to some activities that we didn&#39;t want to miss.<br/>
<br/>
As far as thoughts, I would remind myself (and am doing so now, during an extended period of ill-health) that life is long and goes through seasons. You may have a time of lower activity for awhile, but as the baby gets older and you get your energy back, your life will become more active as well.<br/>
<br/>
I think Sandra mentioned asking other moms for help. You may not have family in the area, but I have found that other moms involved in activities my kids are in are very happy to help out, especially when there&#39;s a new baby. Some people are actually flattered to be asked for help, because it says to them that you see them as a friend. I once had a woman gush about that to me when I asked her if she would come clean my bathroom, for heaven&#39;s sake, when we were moving into a new house and I was exhausted and overwhelmed and everything was covered with dust from having the floors redone.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re involved in a local homeschool group at all, that can be a big source of help. I don&#39;t have a local unschoolers group, but I hang out with a mixed group, and they are like an army ready to mobilize when somebody has a baby or a husband having surgery or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my friends modeled a really wise behavior when they had their first baby: if people called and asked to come visit the baby, they would say, &quot;Sure, and can you just swing by the store and bring some diapers and a gallon of milk on your way?&quot; Or when people were there, they&#39;d say, &quot;Hey, would you mind emptying the wastebaskets while you&#39;re here?&quot; or sweeping the kitchen floor or whatever--these little five minute jobs that people are happy to do but that can really add up and feel overwhelming.<br/>
