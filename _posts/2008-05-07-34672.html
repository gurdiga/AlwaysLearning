<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664299870">I just had an aha moment about trust and unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I was just having a conversation with my ds, and he was explaining to me why he thought <br/>
Animal Crossing was the best game so far, that he&#39;s found, for replicating real life money <br/>
situations--there is interest, investing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I realized after that, although I was very interested in the conversation about what he was <br/>
saying, I wasn&#39;t thinking anything about how &quot;educational&quot; the game was.  Then I paused <br/>
to consider that--and why it was that I didn&#39;t have any interest in that line of thought <br/>
anymore.  And then I had my &quot;moment.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Here it is:  If my kids are finding something interesting and FUN, then they are doing so <br/>
because there is something of value going on.  Why?  Because as human beings we are <br/>
curious and intelligent and enjoy things that challenge us to think in new ways.  And so, if <br/>
they are finding it fun and valuable, it&#39;s BECAUSE IT IS!  That simple--no worrying about <br/>
&quot;educational content,&quot; etc.  The value is there because they have defined it as such.  If it <br/>
weren&#39;t &quot;educational&quot; for them, they would find it boring--like I found high school <br/>
trigonometry!  lol<br/>
<br/>
These are thoughts I might have intellectually articulated, but I just felt it right down to my <br/>
toes--and my level of trust in them (and me) has just risen to a whole new place.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s a really cool shift!<br/>
<br/>
I try to tell new unschoolers to TRUST fascination, because whatever a<br/>
person is fascinated with, they are learning from.:) As much as people<br/>
might try to dissuade your fascination it is still there. We&#39;re much<br/>
better off facilitating more open avenues to that interest, than<br/>
trying to judge it or distract a child from it...<br/>
<br/>
Like with video games, or anything else in life.<br/>
