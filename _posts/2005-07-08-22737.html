<div id="ygrps-yiv-1462174990">There are a few new things up on the site: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liveandlearnconference.org">http://liveandlearnconference.org</a> ----and more coming in every few days.<br/>
<br/>
Also a few changes and corrections. (If y&#39;all see any mistakes, please <br/>
let me know!)<br/>
<br/>
The overflow hotel is the Drury Inn. We have 60 rooms blocked right <br/>
now, and they will add more as we need them. (There are a few <br/>
suites!---but HURRY!) Rooms must be booked by September 17 to get the <br/>
special rate of $89!<br/>
<br/>
I want to remind folks about the raffle and the new &quot;Hometown Baskets&quot; <br/>
silent auction.<br/>
<br/>
We have a special guest: Share Faeber is a caricaturist---take home a <br/>
little momento of the conference! Only $7 per!<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to take a peek at the City Museum (www.citymuseum.org)---it&#39;s <br/>
our Saturday night excursion! An organic museum that changes <br/>
daily----truly amazing! I was there last week and was BLOWN AWAY!!!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;ve been considering offering a funshop---now&#39;s the time to step <br/>
up. I have a very few slots left, but I need to fill them. Let me know <br/>
asap!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sending confirmations out as they come in now, so if you have sent <br/>
me your registration and haven&#39;t received a confirmation, holler at <br/>
me!!! I&#39;ve found two in my spam folder! (I check there every day now!)<br/>
<br/>
*****Most importantly: the Early Bird Deadline is July 31!!! PLEASE be <br/>
sure to send your registrations in before the 31!!! That&#39;s the end of <br/>
THIS month!!!*******<br/>
<br/>
Please feel free to forward this one to other groups.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to your regularly scheduled unschooling discussion....<br/>
