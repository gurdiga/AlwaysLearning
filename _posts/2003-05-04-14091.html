<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sandra, contingency-plan woman, in exotic, invisible New Mexico<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My French teacher in college, who was a native-speaker, so had an accent in<br/>
English, told a great story about when she&#39;d first accepted the job at the<br/>
college in Iowa.  At a dinner party, she was telling people that she&#39;d be<br/>
moving soon, and someone asked to where.  When she said, &quot;Iowa&quot; the person<br/>
said, &quot;Oh you mean Ohio?&quot;.  It went back and forth until the Easterner<br/>
finally told her, rather snottily, &quot;Out HERE, we say OHIO.&quot;<br/>

p.s. Sandra!  Can you make New Mexico visible when I fly out that way this<br/>
summer?  It&#39;s probably easier for the pilot!</div>
