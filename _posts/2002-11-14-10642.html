<div id="ygrps-yiv-1508874952">I don&#39;t think real arrogance would allow for the CONSTANT self-examination <br/>
of your own motives and your own possible biases and your own weaknesses <br/>
and possible erroneous logic, etc., Sandra. And it wouldn&#39;t allow you to <br/>
keep making the point that you have to always consider the possibility that <br/>
NONE of this stuff matters, that it is all genetics and some of us just got <br/>
lucky in the gene pool.<br/>
<br/>
Also -- arrogance always wants full credit and doesn&#39;t want other people <br/>
stealing their thunder. But you are always happy when you hear others <br/>
saying what you also are saying - whether they learned it from you or <br/>
elsewhere. It is the message that matters to you, not whether or not you, <br/>
yourself, are the messenger. That&#39;s not arrogance - that&#39;s committment to <br/>
something &quot;bigger&quot; than yourself.<br/>
