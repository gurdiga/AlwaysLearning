<div id="ygrps-yiv-35008801">Hi Lisa,<br/>
<br/>
My ds, now 9, went to school for less than 4 months in Kindergarten, then<br/>
came home for a year of school-at-home before we finally found unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I can ever make up to Zach what I did to him by trying to<br/>
educate him.  I do know that it took well over a year before he would even<br/>
let me read to him again.  He still refuses anything that looks academic but<br/>
he IS learning in leaps and bounds.<br/>
<br/>
Zach loves to play pool and baseball.  He completely understands how forces<br/>
act on objects and how that makes the objects behave.  So he understands a<br/>
lot of physics just doesn&#39;t use words like torsion and friction, instead we<br/>
talk about &quot;putting English on the ball&quot; or &quot;banking the shot&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Zach is not a pleasure reader but did spend a lot of time up in his room<br/>
until he figured out how to read a Dr. Zeus book.  I was so surprised when<br/>
he proudly offered to read it to me.  He likes to do math problems in his<br/>
head for fun.  He will just ask out of the blue &quot;Does 8 plus 8 equal 16?&quot;<br/>
Yes.  &quot;Then 9 plus 9 is 18, right?&quot;  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
What I have noticed though is the sure way to guarantee Zach will clam up is<br/>
to try to educate or pressure him in any way.  He is still very sensitive to<br/>
the pain that schooling caused him.<br/>
<br/>
May I suggest simply have fun with your son.  Don&#39;t do &quot;field trips&quot; but<br/>
just go hang out at the zoo with your son, like you would with anybody that<br/>
you like to spend time with.  Play.  Go shopping.  Build a tree house.  Just<br/>
do fun stuff and make sure that you are allowing him to be fully involved,<br/>
that you are not taking over (like good homeschool moms are very capable of<br/>
doing).  But most of all, just breathe, relax and remember that life really<br/>
is good.<br/>

It&#39;s pretty wonderful.  We rent it from Hollywood video every year or two, <br/>

I remember seeing part of it in a theatre in the late 50&#39;s as a short before <br/>
a movie.  Not the whole thing, which is about a half an hour.<br/>

believe how cool it was. I did buy the new Schoolhouse Rock DVD a few weeks <br/>
ago. Remember those Saturday morning shorts between cartoons in the mid 70&#39;s <br/>
and early 80&#39;s? It has all the multiplication songs, all the English and <br/>
History songs too. The kids love to put it on while they play and sing along <br/>
with it. <br/>

seeing it as a kid, and I showed it to Matthew when he was 4 or 5 or so and<br/>
he loved it.  There are copies available on both ebay and half.com, although<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Hello,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; These ideas of bedtime, control, and the young woman are very interesting.<br/>
&gt; Surrendering and trusting the young people we get to see grow up is so<br/>
&gt; difficult. First, the safety of life, the hold my hand, slow down when you<br/>
&gt; eat, small pieces please, watch the street then cross, two hands on the<br/>
&gt; scooter. At some point along the way, these little people really do know how<br/>
&gt; to be responsible. I see it with Tessa, almost 3 on some things, alot with<br/>
&gt; Riley, 5.5, and Ashley at almost 8 seems to know how to be in the world.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Right now I was controlling Tessa. She is playing with homemade playdough we<br/>
&gt; cooked up about 45 minutes ago. She wants to mix in more flour. I told her <br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; had enough. Why? Two reasons, I see a potential mess I get to clean up and <br/>
&gt; she<br/>
&gt; will make the playdough too dry. My deal. I gave her more flour and told her<br/>
&gt; sorry for not listening right away. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Controlling the kids seems to creep into our lives so easily. I hear parents<br/>
&gt; all the time telling kids not to do this or that at the playground. Throwing<br/>
&gt; sand yes, but climbing up the slide when no one else is playing on it does <br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; seem reasonable.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I like this discussion,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mary H. (who married an introvert and is still learning to respect his out<br/>
&gt; side of the group needs). Makes it difficult sometimes to do exciting crowd<br/>
&gt; activities, like fairs and festivals, yet boy do we have fun on our own in <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; woods and beaches. I also have learned to ts=ake the kids to group things <br/>
&gt; with<br/>
&gt; another family and ask Tim if he wants to join us. No expectations. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>yup, that&#39;s me to a T. I try to work on it, but sometimes it slips through.<br/>
<br/>
Have you read &#39;Do not disturb&#39; by Deborah Jackson? It&#39;s a great book on this <br/>
very topic.  I think I&#39;m probably due to reread it sometime soon. ;o)<br/>
