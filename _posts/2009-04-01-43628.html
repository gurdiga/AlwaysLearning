<div id="ygrps-yiv-1465595113">We are currently visiting my family &quot;back home&quot;.  Myself, DH, DS 10 and 8 mo b/g twins.  We are all sharing a smallish bedroom in a noisy house.  Most of my time has been spent helping the twins make the adjustment to a different environment.  DS has been playing video games with his aunts, watching tv, showing his grandpa games on computer, running erands with grandpa, watching dad fix grandpa&#39;s truck, playing with neighborhood kids.  He has helped with dishes and picking up without being asked.  I am so filled with love and wonder at how amazing he is.<br/>
My mother asked me the other day what we were planning to do about learning while we are here (4 weeks).  I told her we would do what ever we thought would be fun, walks, a trip to the zoo and science center, because we enjoy those things.  She asked if I would let him play video games all day, to which I responded that I would if that is what he wanted, but I didn&#39;t really think that would be the case.  Then the issue of eating came up, she was worried that she hadn&#39;t seen him eating much during the day.  (She is a member of the clean your plate club)  He eats when he is hungry, he knows what his body needs.<br/>
So to Sandra&#39;s site I went, looking for words I could give my mother to help her understand.  I re read the &quot;If I let him...&quot; section and I had a thought.  It seems to me that these fears of doing nothing but tv watching or only eating &quot;junk&quot; come from our oun issues.  That we sometimes put our fears and issues onto kids.  Its like we are teaching them that they cannot trust themselves.  <br/>
Just a thought...<br/>

It&#39;s going along with the fears of generations, though.  The &quot;common  <br/>
knowledge&quot; that wasn&#39;t really knowledge at all.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>After all, many of us have gotten that message from all sorts of<br/>
sources: school, work, church.  And many of us are still in those<br/>
environments, at least work.  The things often said there tend to stay<br/>
with us because the ideas are repeated so much that they seem true.  I<br/>
love John Holt&#39;s metaphor about why teaching doesn&#39;t work: that our<br/>
attempt to teach is separated from realtiy; that by training a parrot<br/>
to say something often enough, apart from the experience of the words&#39;<br/>
meanings, we believe the parrot will come to understand the phrases<br/>
they learn to speak, simply by repeating.  (I&#39;m paraphrasing.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s great that I got the chance to take in new knowledge by watching<br/>
Karl as he showed us how he trusts himself and we can too.  Most<br/>
people haven&#39;t had that experience, and if faced with the knowledge,<br/>
they don&#39;t understand because it&#39;s not what they&#39;re interested in and<br/>
they have no reason in their own thinking for such understanding.<br/>
<br/>
Karl and I lived with my in laws for a few months, and it was strange<br/>
looking through the lens of unschooling at a familiar scene where<br/>
people are seeking order through a series of predictable actions.  And<br/>
noticing that the order wasn&#39;t predictable because of certain touted<br/>
actions so much as through force and coercion.  I felt an odd sense of<br/>
reality there.<br/>
