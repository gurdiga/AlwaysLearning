<div id="ygrps-yiv-1154987603">My almost 25yo (who didn&#39;t learn to read until he was 9 1/2) has been <br/>
working since he was 17. He started out beekeeping for a couple of <br/>
years, then worked on a dairy farm, and has recently been taken on as an <br/>
adult apprentice welder.<br/>
<br/>
My 22yo (learnt to read at 8 1/2) is working in the timber yard of a <br/>
large home improvement firm while he saves towards getting his teeth <br/>
fixed following a car accident (we have helped as much as we can) and <br/>
then intends to do a degree in music performance. (jazz sax)<br/>
<br/>
My 18yo (learnt to read at 12 1/2) works for Hell&#39;s Pizzas part time, <br/>
and for a copy firm part time - hoping the latter will become full time, <br/>
using his artistic and computer skills. He also plans to sell his art at <br/>
the local creative market when he and I (I make handbound journals) have <br/>
enough stock to commit to a stand - probably in spring (September - we <br/>
live in New Zealand).<br/>

Asking someone&#39;s assistant or secretary or wife to ask people who  <br/>
know is a form of research.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s an irritating form, when neither the wife/assistant or  <br/>
the information providers are being paid AND the question is asked in  <br/>
a hostile way, hoping for an answer to use against us all.<br/>
<br/>
So that having been said, I have three teens who haven&#39;t been to school.<br/>
Didn&#39;t I just post this response here last week?  Lately I&#39;m  <br/>
confusing AlwaysLearning and UnschoolingDiscussion.<br/>
<br/>
Both are working their second jobs.  Both were offered their first  <br/>
jobs by adults who knew them and were impressed by them.  At the  <br/>
moment Kirby (19) is working at a pizza place where friends wanted  <br/>
him to come and work.  He visited the home of one of &quot;the pie  <br/>
guys&quot; (who make the pizzas themselves) and there was a pharmacy  <br/>
school diploma on the wall.  Marty (17) is working full time at a  <br/>
grocery store.  Because he&#39;s not 18, he is a sacker/bagboy/&quot;courtesy  <br/>
clerk and making $6 an hour.  That&#39;s not great, but there&#39;s already  <br/>
been an inquiry from the manager of the deli about when he will turn  <br/>
18 and be eligible for MANY other jobs there.  I doubt the deli  <br/>
manager will be the only one to ask.  He doesn&#39;t turn 18 until mid  <br/>
January.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby is interested in a culinary arts course given by the community  <br/>
college, and that&#39;s his current plan.<br/>
Marty has for several years intended to be a policeman.  Keith has  <br/>
wanted me to discourage that.  Just Thursday my sister, who worked as  <br/>
a grocery store clerk for years, said I should tell him grocery  <br/>
management pays way better than policework and is safer.  Starting  <br/>
there at 16 as he did, he could be pretty far along by the time  <br/>
others his age get out of college with their degrees in anthropology,  <br/>
communications, philosophy, politics, history or other things that  <br/>
require a master&#39;s degree or PhD for even the HOPE of a paying job in  <br/>
the field.  Many BA and BS degrees &quot;qualify&quot; one for nothing more  <br/>
than continuing in school.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask your doubting husband to really inventory people he&#39;s know  <br/>
in his life, or that he graduated with, or has worked with.  He  <br/>
probably will stop counting before very long about people with  <br/>
something like  a master&#39;s in education who never taught or quit  <br/>
after fewer years in the classroom than they were in school, or  <br/>
people who dropped out of college after three years and had to pay  <br/>
their student loans off (if indeed they bothered) working jobs like  <br/>
my boys have now.<br/>
<br/>
The question makes me angry.  Those questions too often come from a  <br/>
fantasy vision of &quot;high school graduates&quot; as all valedictorians and  <br/>
captains of the football team.  That&#39;s BULL.  Schools are by their  <br/>
very nature required to turn out MORE average-to-low students than &quot;A  <br/>
and B&quot; students.   The &quot;honor roll&quot; is worth NOTHING if 90% or more  <br/>
of the student body is NOT on it.  The more who are off, the better  <br/>
&quot;honor roll&quot; is.  The more who do NOT get an A, the better the A is.<br/>
<br/>
School produces losers and failures who would never have been  <br/>
failures or losers had they not gone to school to be &quot;graded.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
School grades first and foremost, and learning is a byproduct of all  <br/>
that sorting and rewarding and punishing.  And speaking for at least  <br/>
one gifted student, much of what the &quot;top kids&quot; learn they learned  <br/>
outside of school and not in.  Yet school, and school defenders, look  <br/>
at people like me and say &quot;SEE?  School.&quot;  They should look at  <br/>
prison, and welfare, and gangs, and say &quot;See?  School.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I rarely go on a school rant because I enjoyed school and I don&#39;t  <br/>
think schools are evil, just out of hand and far beyond their  <br/>
original intent with no hope of return.   But if someone who&#39;s never  <br/>
met a grown unschooler wants to suggest that any average &quot;school kid&quot;  <br/>
is ahead of or better than my sons, he can face my ire and/or kiss my  <br/>
butt.  Or he can keep his kids in school and have that chance (what  <br/>
do you think it is, 40%? 60%?)  that they&#39;ll fail and be miserable,  <br/>
if they don&#39;t kill themselves first.<br/>
<br/>
Schoolkids do kill themselves, and sometimes others.<br/>
Sometimes fundamentalist school-at-home mothers have been known to  <br/>
kill their children.  Three times; maybe that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
I know of no unschooling-related suicides or murders. Yes, the  <br/>
population is smaller, but it&#39;s also immeasurably happier, unless we  <br/>
want to measure in the absolute numbers of suicides and murders  <br/>
directly related.<br/>

the &quot;real world&quot;.  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I have found that when a question like this arises it due more to the <br/>
fact that the husband or spouse asking has not had the opportunity to <br/>
learn about unschooling. Usually they are at work all day, and some <br/>
time between kids and dinner moms are trying to have a conversation <br/>
about unschooling and they are trying to relate all the information <br/>
that they have learned ,researched, understand about unschooling and <br/>
now want to implement. So the struggle begins....Because your now <br/>
trying to not only convince your partner this is a viable option but <br/>
informing them of the concepts and ideas too. So you have already <br/>
ceased to have a equal discussion and now are on to convincing them <br/>
you know what your doing.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with this is, most times the husband do say yea do what <br/>
ever. But then they come home every day and they are looking for <br/>
schoolish type learning to have taken place if not physicality but at <br/>
least be able to observe the schoolish results in their children and <br/>
the kids demonstrating this to dad so he can be convinced all is <br/>
going well.  When dads don&#39;t see the learning in the way they are <br/>
accustom to observing, friction and conflict arise and your back to <br/>
explaining yet again the concept idea and what it looks like and <br/>
convincing them yes the children really are learning. This is very <br/>
bad on the marriage and relationship for the whole family. You are <br/>
always being held up to scrutiny by the one person who is your <br/>
partner and suppose to be supporting you if not fully involved in the <br/>
unschooling process. <br/>
<br/>
You can answers the one question what do jobs look like for <br/>
unschoolers and as far as I can tell they look like any one else&#39;s <br/>
jobs. Just the kids usually want to do it and like it and choose it.<br/>
<br/>
One might want to think about why he asked such a question. Does he <br/>
have ideas or visions that unschooler cannot accomplish what ever <br/>
goals they desire with love and support. Does he think that the kids <br/>
won&#39;t go on to getting graduate degrees in banking business computer <br/>
high tech. Which unschoolers do accomplish. <br/>
<br/>
The question I think you should be asking him, is he ok with whatever <br/>
interests the kids have and allowing them to follow their own path.  <br/>
Are you and your husband ok with letting your children follow their <br/>
desires dreams and goals and supporting them in what ever direction <br/>
they choose.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I could be unschooling if my husband didn&#39;t understand <br/>
and respect the goals and interests of our son. It also helped a lot <br/>
that he took the time to finally read up and learn about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I would also have your husband join some unschooling groups let him <br/>
read the threads, send him articles and allow him the opportunity to <br/>
educate himself on the radical unschooling subject. <br/>
<br/>
Hey maybe even strew a few article and such around the house so he <br/>
can be on the same page as you.<br/>
Some books I strewed around my house for my husband ( Who <br/>
incidentally works for a private preparatory school  and sees these <br/>
kids achievements on a daily basis like second languages in <br/>
kindergarten writing essays in 1st grade) Oh yea we&#39;ve been there <br/>
with the comparisons and what kind of job and career will a <br/>
unschooler really have. <br/>
Any way here are some books I strewed around for him to read. I&#39;m <br/>
sure any of Sandra Dodd&#39;s articles would be of great to have him <br/>
read. Good luck Maisha :)  T<br/>

He probably won&#39;t want to read anything of mine if Maisha prints out  <br/>
the &quot;kiss my butt&quot; one. &lt;g&gt;  The offer still stands, but thfamily3&#39;s  <br/>
approach was WAY (way) more tactful. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One book dads seem to like is &quot;Dumbing us Down.&quot;  It&#39;s an anti-school  <br/>
book, not a pro-unschooling book.  But sometimes someone needs to be  <br/>
shaken loose from their clinging to an idealized idea of school  <br/>
before they can consider that an alternative is even worth considering.<br/>
<br/>
Another book my a male author that hasn&#39;t been recommended lately but  <br/>
that men just used to love (meaning men who didn&#39;t want to read what  <br/>
some mom wrote would pick this one up and get something out of it,  <br/>
while women were less happy with its tone) is this, and they have  <br/>
used copies for VERY little money at Amazon (like $1 plus shipping):<br/>

There are reviews and sample pages there.<br/>
<br/>
You might not even need to buy the book, if he&#39;ll just read that stuff.<br/>
Like this, for instance.  People who write this way like his book.   <br/>
AND it&#39;s about him and his sons (manliness points):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;An articulate, thoughtful, accessible, and refreshingly balanced  <br/>
examination of &quot;why homeschooling makes sense.&quot; I&#39;ve read many books  <br/>
about homeschooling (a number of which were cited in Mr. Guterson&#39;s  <br/>
book), but none have been as helpful as this one in terms of  <br/>
exploring the advantages and disadvantages of teaching your own, and  <br/>
what it means in a larger sense, not just to our children but to  <br/>
ourselves and the society and culture in which we live. Even-handed,  <br/>
the author doesn&#39;t shy away from pointing out unhelpful attitudes on  <br/>
some members of both sides, -- school administrations and  <br/>
homeschoolers -- but he also does his best to place these  <br/>
observations in context that the reader might have a better  <br/>
understanding of its underpinnings. Those seeking a better way to  <br/>
express their reasons for homeschooling will find many arguments in  <br/>
its defense. &quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1685303730">Hi,<br/>
 <br/>
We started having the kids stay home to learn in 1981.  Now with the  <br/>
youngest of the five headed toward 18 (hard to believe!) they are out in the  world <br/>
and having a fine time. This is part of what I put at the end of a  monthly <br/>
column I have been writing:<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
My oldest two sons attended school through the fourth  grade and <br/>
kindergarten.  After that  none of the kids have gone to school until college.  My oldest <br/>
son now works as real estate  agent, he holds an accounting degree, the next <br/>
one graduated with a degree in  theatre – he’s now attending grad school at <br/>
UCLA, the next son works as a  journeyman in the heating/AC field, my daughter <br/>
attends community college  majoring in dance and music, and the youngest son <br/>
started taking a couple of  community college courses.  <br/>
In addition - my daughter is now  working two jobs.  She and three of her <br/>
friends have plans to start a dance  studio in the future.  My youngest son is in <br/>
the process of getting a job  bussing at a local restaurant. <br/>
Mostly what I would say about the kids  is that they are responsible, <br/>
reliable and make choices in their lives that  benefit themselves and others around <br/>
them.  They learned to be  self-directed and have been very clear in what path <br/>
they want to take as they  enter their adult years. <br/>
The responses through the years from  their professors, their bosses, and <br/>
their coaches have been glowing.   <br/>
Yesterday I had lunch with four women  from my original San Diego <br/>
un/homeschooling group.  There is no doubt about  it, the kids have grown up to be happy, <br/>
caring people.   <br/>
