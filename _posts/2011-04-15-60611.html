<div id="ygrps-yiv-272182192">Hey everyone, thanks for all of the feedback on schooling. It really seems that fulltime homeschooling/unschooling is the answer for me but I will continue to research.<br/>
That said- can anyone link me to some good research demonstrating how good homeschoolers/unschoolers do? This is not for me at all just for &#39;concerned&#39; family members. It seems that HSers do great in college, in jobs, in life in general...Is there any good &#39;research&#39; online to back this up?<br/>
<br/>
What I would really love but we a good DVD to watch with my wife. She always gets alot out of documentaries. Is there any good ones about HSing/USing? <br/>
<br/>
How bout any good information (dvd would be great) on why compulsory schooling is bad? I haven&#39;t really come up with any yet though someone just recommended Waiting For Superman...so maybe that is good...but Id really like a harsh critique of the foundation/maintenance/results of compulsory schooling...and it doesn&#39;t have to be an academic critique at all (but fine if it is). Maybe just a look at competition, bullying, sexism, racism and devaluization of life that is entrenched in alot of our school systems structure.<br/>
<br/>
Any good resources on any of this anyone?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all tons!!!<br/>

I don&#39;t mind if someone comes up with something for you, but it&#39;s not really the topic of this discussion list. :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you google &quot;the evils of school&quot; you can probably find so many stories you would feel suicidal, but what will your kids be doing while you&#39;re doing that?  How will you be toward them after you get all depressed?<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t help but want to encourage parents of young children to focus more energy toward joy and peace.<br/>

I&#39;ve sent The Fraiser Report on Home Education to quite a few people.  The author is/was associated in some ways, at some time, with HSLDA, which is a big yuck in my book, but the study is VERY positive (click on the &quot;free download&quot; toward the bottom of the page):<br/>

Some inspiring short videos that talk about creativity and how schools kill it, are Sir. Ken Robinson&#39;s TED talks:<br/>

Dr. Peter Gray&#39;s &quot;Freedom to Learn&quot; blog at Psychology Today is a wonderful &quot;mainstream&quot; voice in favor of unschooling. I&#39;ve read and enjoyed most of his posts. The ones on math and reading might be especially helpful:<br/>

lol no luck with the evils of school google search :( But you are right and I definitely do not want to be negative and get myself or my kids depressed. Its really information I&#39;d like to share with my parents. They cherish the school system dearly so I am just trying to give them an idea of some of the realities of the school system that aren&#39;t glorious as they perceive them.<br/>
<br/>
But more importantly I want to share with them information on the benefits of homeschooling/unschooling.<br/>
I apologize because that is actually why I started this thread.<br/>

<br/>
What my parents think isnt more important but it is important. i would like to try help them understand rather than it be something separates us. If it does separate us then it does, i know where I stand, but I would rather have them be a part of everything. My family and I (including my parents and siblings) have been through an awful lot of life altering experiences together(including 3 open heart surgeries for me, the last one being a year and a half ago- and I am only 34) so I atleast want them to understand where I am coming from.  So not having some sort of peace with my parents is not a good long term option for me- for as with my kids- i value their lives highly. Right now we live in Mn and they live in PA  :)  so that is helpful. I think its just going to take some time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-999825455">I hope this note I wrote may help you to ease your mind. I was like you looking for evidence...<br/>
<br/>
Here is the note<br/>
<br/>
One of the reasons that got me into homeschooling was that I wanted to homeschool my children to harvard. I thought homeschooling would be more effective for us to achieve that goal. <br/>
<br/>
I never thought homeschooling would lead to such joyful living, real and pure learning and happiness. What a big surprise!<br/>
<br/>
The happiness, the joy, the freedom, the love, the connection, the excitement, the anticipation, the relationship, the healing, the moments and moments of fun experience and memory......so precious. I would never want to sacrifice these for academic &quot;success&quot;. And they may not be mutually exclusive. I have the confidence that the children will be able to achieve that with passion and still have tons of fun.<br/>

<br/>
Your first post seemed more urgent.  Maybe that noise was just in my head.&lt;g&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
I asked because I&#39;ve seen a lot of people (women mostly) who are still, at their grown up age, acting like their parent&#39;s child, wanting or needed parental approval.    That&#39;s not healthy.       <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t try to sell unschooling to family members.   I said &quot;homeschooling.&quot;   Maybe that would make a difference with your mom and dad.  They can probably remember homeschoolers winning spelling bees, etc.  Maybe that won&#39;t be so scary.  <br/>
<br/>
Bombarding them with a bunch of anti school stuff might make you seem crazy.   They might worry more.    I think unschoolers  can get used to talking  with other unschoolers on email lists and forums and can forget how really crazy the idea sounds to people who aren&#39;t living this way.  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s helpful to keep in mind that one of the big things grandparents want is a sense of connection with their grandchildren. When kids aren&#39;t in school, that can feel awkward - what the heck do you say to a child other than &quot;what are you doing in school?&quot; Especially if you only see him twice a year? It can leave extended family members stymied. So it helps a whoooole lot to feed them useful information and conversation starters in the form of something grandparents usually like anyway - pictures and stories of their grandkids. Keeping a blog or sending regular notes (via facebook or plain old snail mail) goes a long way in that regard. And! they get to see their beloved grandchildren happy and adventurous, which can help to reassure them on that score.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can come across as some kind of weird cult if you try to explain it from a theoretical side first. Start with happy kids living rich, full lives and school starts to seem less of an issue. <br/>
<br/>
The only site I sent my parents when I was getting into unschooling was actually a homeschooling site - A to Zs Home&#39;s Cool.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/">http://homeschooling.gomilpitas.com/</a><br/>
 Its a huuuuuge site and that alone brought a big sigh of relief from my family. Like most people, they didn&#39;t realize how much is available for homeschoolers these days in terms of resources. <br/>

We haven&#39;t told my parents we are unschooling (though it is just our family&#39;s business :-).  <br/>
Your post further confirms that I am moving toward being more comfortable with my decisions about my life as an adult without worrying about what others think. <br/>

I am pretty new to all of this stuff so as of like 2 weeks ago I had never even heard of John Holt, John Gatto, or our friend here Sandra Dodd. But I thank all of you so much- these appear to be new &#39;mentors&#39; of myne who immediately compliment and complete many of my thoughts and beliefs. I have been a social activist most of my life (I have been fighting for the truth since my mid teens and am 34 now) and have learned alot about keeping my children out of school and learning/living naturally through socially conscious community groups and the likes of John Africa and the MOVE organization. I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on John Holts work and I know it is worth buying because I am going to want to share it.<br/>

&gt; Your post further confirms that I am moving toward being more comfortable with my decisions about my life as an adult without worrying about what others think. <br/>

&gt; The happiness, the joy, the freedom, the love, the connection, the excitement, the anticipation, the relationship, the healing, the moments and moments of fun experience and memory......so precious. I would never want to sacrifice these for academic &quot;success&quot;. And they may not be mutually exclusive. I have the confidence that the children will be able to achieve that with passion and still have tons of fun.<br/>

I love John Holt&#39;s stuff for sure, but some of it is fifty years old.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s worth reading all of it.  About Holt or anything, remember this:  Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.<br/>
<br/>
You can read enough John Holt online to fortify you until you decide what book to read.  Deb Lewis has written on a couple of his books:<br/>

<br/>
Here is the description:  &quot;The first generation of homeschooling movement is almost three decades old. It has been a stunning success. Even the most critical skeptics admit this. But, they ask, what about the second generation? Will the homeschool graduates continue what their teachers demonstrated? Will the second generation build on the legacy of independent home education, or abandon what their parents so bravely began? &quot;<br/>

He said 80 percent were leaving the church.  Even worse.<br/>
It is all about the Christian homeschooling movement and not about homeschooling in general.  Certainly not about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One of the guys speaks in military terms, of holding the ground they had gained.<br/>
<br/>
The younger guy was a good speaker.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that it was presented as a group thing, being abandoned.  As though it wasn&#39;t for the benefit of individuals at all, but as a political or social movement.<br/>
<br/>
For me and my children, that was done for the moment, for each child, as each day unfolded.  If they do or don&#39;t unschool any children they have, it doesn&#39;t negate what we did one bit.  My children&#39;s lives are not the same as they would have been had they gone to school, and that will likely affect their children and grandchildren no matter what role the school options of the future might play in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t know right now how schools will be later on, but the range of options will continue to expand, I&#39;m sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1487215813">Actually, of all of our friends the only one who has a strongly negative<br/>
opinion of our homeschooling (in concept mostly) is the one person that we<br/>
know who was homeschooled for any of his pre-college education.  AND he was<br/>
homeschooled for religious reasons by a very fundamentally Christian mom and<br/>
dad.  The only people that he and his brother associated with for those<br/>
three years were kids at church.  His parents believed that they were<br/>
protecting their children from ungodliness.  I also gather that they used<br/>
very school-at-home methods.  He is now agnostic at most as far as a<br/>
description of his belief in any higher power goes.<br/>
<br/>
Also, when I watched the trailer, the man I saw said that 80% of Christian<br/>
youth were leaving the faith, not just homeschooling Christian youth.  Most<br/>
of the least religious people that I know were raised in very strict<br/>
religious households that tended to be what I would call repressive and<br/>
authoritarian.<br/>

But you have no option, I&#39;m assuming.  If you allow the law to be broken on your property you ARE responsible.   Nothing about unschooling changes that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It is not actually in our home, but on the property in back acres. I<br/>

<br/>
The other parents probably don&#39;t either, so if the kids don&#39;t tell them, and go to your property, get drunk, and get hurt on the way home, you can be liable.  <br/>
<br/>
The best plan might be a campout where kids aren&#39;t expected to go home, but stay there.  If I were going to knowingly do something like that (and I have), I&#39;d offer beds to anyone who might not be good to get home on their own.<br/>

held legally responsible if a parent gets upset. (Depends on the state.)<br/>
<br/>
Some states prohibit parents from giving a child alcohol. From  <br/>
Wikipedia: &quot;As of January 1, 2010, 15 states and the District of  <br/>
Columbia ban underage consumption outright, 17 states do not  <br/>
specifically ban underage consumption, and the remaining 18 states  <br/>
have family member and/or location exceptions to their underage  <br/>
consumption laws.&quot; (I know there&#39;s a list there somewhere of what the  <br/>
laws are for each state.)<br/>
<br/>
Approached from a conventional parenting point of view parents would  <br/>
erect a wall between the child and what he&#39;s asking for and say &quot;No,  <br/>
period, it&#39;s illegal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As a partner to your child, the law is a reason why you don&#39;t want to  <br/>
be involved and if your son feels respected, he&#39;ll in turn not want to  <br/>
do something that could get you in deep trouble. You might want to  <br/>
investigate with him what would happen to him if he, as an underage  <br/>
person, hosts a party with beer and the police get involved so he can  <br/>
make  a better informed decision. My guess is the safest, as far as  <br/>
getting in legal trouble, is if no one&#39;s the host and everyone meets  <br/>
up bringing whatever they bring. Which might make it harder to control  <br/>
who comes.<br/>

<br/>
I understand wanting to keep him from harm. But if you break the law by making beer available to minors, what are you risking for yourself and the rest of your family in an effort to control the harm to which your son might be exposed (drinking + driving)??? <br/>
<br/>
What harm are you creating for other kids if you knowingly provide beer and they then drive home? Some of them may not be able to stay out overnight; some of them may not be able to tell their parents they&#39;ve been drinking and that it would be safer if they were *not* home by curfew. <br/>
<br/>
Your son&#39;s at an age where he will likely be exposed to beer and liquor and drugs at other people&#39;s parties, and you can&#39;t protect him from that exposure and you can&#39;t protect him from making the least-best choice in some of those situations. But you CAN be the person he trusts to come get him without complaint or lectures if he realizes he shouldn&#39;t be driving.<br/>
