<div id="ygrps-yiv-59086450">I just read an article in Stars and Strips, the newspaper for military<br/>
overseas, which had an article on homeschooling Wed. 26 Feb.  It was the<br/>
cover article for their &quot;Accent&quot; section.<br/>
<br/>
Amazingly enough, the child featured in the cover of the section, and first<br/>
discussed in the story was an unschooler!  And the author even got it right,<br/>
saying that unschoolers &quot;trace their origins to the late 1970&#39;s and writer<br/>
John Holt....&quot;  The parent quoted (Winifred Haun) was saying that &quot;My job as<br/>
Athena&#39;s parent is to do things that she can&#39;t do for herself yet, like<br/>
calling up to schedule a class or taking her to a performance.  Otherwise<br/>
it&#39;s up to her to steer the process.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The author of the article was Grant Pick of the Chicago Tribune.  Anybody<br/>
else see it?  I was pretty happy to it, especially in a conservative<br/>
publication like Stars and Stripes.<br/>
