<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271112479">I&#39;ve been accused of being a bully.  The quote (put in public, on  <br/>
someone else&#39;s blog) is this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-She&#39;s been a bully and disrespectful in the face of a humbled  <br/>
apology from someone wanting to listen and dialog, not once, not  <br/>
twice, but three times over twice that many years. It is sad for the  <br/>
very reasons you listed here: she does challenge thinking, gets  <br/>
questions going...I found it all very valuable until I experienced  <br/>
where the threshold of consistency ended: she&#39;s the boss, the  <br/>
authority, the one runnin&#39; the show. Not so mindful. It does however,  <br/>
free one to discard an ill fitting label, knowing I would no longer  <br/>
like to associate with it anyway.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
First, I have questions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Was it the same person three times in six years who came, caused a  <br/>
problem, &quot;humbly&quot; apologized and then was &quot;bullied&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Can someone staying on her own site and her own list who is  <br/>
badmouthed there, and on a couple of blogs, be considered to be the  <br/>
one doing the bullying?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I have comments.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A private apology for a public insult is never sufficient.  To be  <br/>
fair, I wasn&#39;t allowing the &quot;apology&quot; onto the list because it was  <br/>
wrapped in insult and kinda dripping with venom and defensiveness.   <br/>
It didn&#39;t feel like an apology.  It felt like someone begging me to  <br/>
let her back in please-please-please so she could be mean to me again  <br/>
once there was an audience.<br/>
<br/>
People who say &quot;I would unschool, but I don&#39;t like Sandra&quot; (or  <br/>
whatever else flimsy excuse they make) just didn&#39;t want to unschool  <br/>
in the first place, but wants to blame it on someone or something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some people do better if they feel they have dangerous enemies. Some  <br/>
people want to tag me to be their dangerous enemy.  I have no  <br/>
interest in being anyone&#39;s dangerous or dramatic nemesis.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
have a nemesis nor do I want one.  I hand out with my kids a lot and  <br/>
I write to other unschoolers.  People who aren&#39;t unschoolers  <br/>
sometimes try to stop me.  People who want me to say that anything in  <br/>
the whole world is unschooling if someone utters the magic word  <br/>
&quot;unschooing&quot; before requiring French lessons or Saxon math.  I won&#39;t  <br/>
do that.  So they try bullying.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone from Australia once wrote that they have the concept there of  <br/>
&quot;tall poppy syndrome.&quot;  If someone is prominent, others try to chop  <br/>
them down.<br/>
<br/>
My prominence is from consistency and longevity.   I&#39;m still here.   <br/>
If I were chopped down and weren&#39;t here, someone could claim they  <br/>
chopped me down.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someone chopped down the World Trade Center, and gets to say &quot;I did  <br/>
that!&quot;  (Or his cronies get to say it, and they like to think he&#39;s  <br/>
being congratulated in Paradise where he&#39;s sitting at the head table  <br/>
being backslapped and saluted, maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
Someone paints on a wall and sees that graffiti or vandalism and says  <br/>
&quot;I did that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Someone posts something hateful on a blog comment and says &quot;I did that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, what are her kids doing?  Has she helped anyone, or  <br/>
herself, or her kids?  Has she hurt me?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see comments like these, and I think &quot;I helped with that.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
They stopped bullying their kids and they feel better about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t go to anyone else&#39;s house to see what they&#39;re doing.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
e-mail people and invite them to my list; they find it on their own.   <br/>
If they come and start trying to change the list, or me, who&#39;s being  <br/>
the bully?<br/>

to see the honesty take off and become those you describe below. Lately I&#39;ve<br/>
felt like a line out of &quot;Silence of the Lambs&quot; when Clarice asks Lechter to<br/>
focus his seeing-powers into himself and describe what he sees. He clucks at<br/>
her for the silly request. When I&#39;m unwilling to look into myself<br/>

someone else) I *KNOW* that&#39;s a big sign for *ME* to do something different,<br/>
investigate and *DO* -- not kvetch, not bully, truly BE the change.<br/>

<br/>
not once, not twice, but three times over twice that many years.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-=-=-=-Wow! Someone&#39;s keeping score *with a calendar*?!?!?! That&#39;s funny!!<br/>
You&#39;d think if she put that much time and energy into making just ONE kid<br/>
happier than yesterday, she&#39;d not need to think of you, not one time.<br/>
I also think that being a jerk three times in six years is pretty dang good<br/>
for a grumpy butt like you :::beg::: Heck, I wish I was only *evil* that<br/>
often... another bar you&#39;ve set ;)<br/>
<br/>
It is sad for the very reasons you listed here: she does challenge thinking,<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; gets<br/>
&gt; questions going...I found it all very valuable until I experienced<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-=-=-=-=-Isn&#39;t it *indeed* your show? Not unschooling (like she wants to<br/>
give you credit for) , I mean your lists. That&#39;s the complaint area, yes?<br/>
You&#39;ve got a monopoly on *unschooling*?? Are you gonna trademark it? hee hee<br/>
hee<br/>
<br/>
First, I have questions.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Was it the same person three times in six years who came, caused a<br/>
&gt; problem, &quot;humbly&quot; apologized and then was &quot;bullied&quot;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-=-=-=-=-I know how you work personally to keep ickiness to a minimum.<br/>
Thank you for moderating as much as you do to keep *our* ickiness to a<br/>
minimum on this list and out of our discussions. Sometimes that&#39;s percieved<br/>
as icky by some, good thing they can either take a break and realize that<br/>
maybe there *is* something to what was said, or go somewhere else and have<br/>
their hands patted and heads stroked. I&#39;m glad this is not the place for<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
People who say &quot;I would unschool, but I don&#39;t like Sandra&quot; (or<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; whatever else flimsy excuse they make) just didn&#39;t want to unschool<br/>
&gt; in the first place, but wants to blame it on someone or something.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>-=-=-=-I know people like this. Sorry Sandra, you don&#39;t carry that kind of<br/>
power in my life and I *like* you! ;)  Why would I give someone I don&#39;t like<br/>
power/justification for my shittiness in my relationship with my kids? It&#39;s<br/>
just not rational or reasonable -- a far cry from mindful and attached.<br/>
<br/>

I&#39;m one of those people out here...reading often...posting only in my  <br/>
mind... I often hear Sandra&#39;s voice in my head and it&#39;s always one of  honesty, <br/>
reason and truth.    There isn&#39;t a day that goes by  as I look at our unschooling <br/>
lives that I don&#39;t say a silent &quot;thank you&quot; for her  words, her commitment and <br/>
the difference in my children&#39;s lives because  of our connection.  <br/>
So thanks from this part of the world too. The words and  ideas she shares <br/>
make our world better every day.<br/>

tells it like it is and is not harsh but just honest.  Sometimes the truth<br/>
hurts but if you&#39;re willing to examine yourself and apply the advice given<br/>
by other, more experienced, unschoolers on this list you will come out<br/>
better off.  Sandra has raised her children well.  My boys are 7 and 5 and I<br/>
appreciate the wisdom given by others to help us be better, respectful and<br/>

<br/>
Because it&#39;s not for absolutely definitely positively sure, I wasn&#39;t  <br/>
saying anything yet, but if it happens as is vaguely being planned,  <br/>
Holly and I will be in or near Portland, August, Bangor and maybe  <br/>
Houlton in the first week of October.<br/>
<br/>
If not, not.  But if so, that will be very cool.  I&#39;ve been to  <br/>
Joyce&#39;s house and around where the conference was in Massachusetts a  <br/>
few years  years ago.   In years before that I&#39;ve been to the Pennsic  <br/>
war in western Pennsylvania, and to Philadelphia once to visit an SCA  <br/>
friend and catch a plane, and I&#39;ve been to Washington a couple of  <br/>
times, and Virginia.  That&#39;s about the whole of my NE U.S.  <br/>
experience, and that was all after I was in my 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s.   <br/>
Holly&#39;s got the Boston trip, and now Rhode Island, and she&#39;s  <br/>
fifteen.  Cool for her!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching the special features and documentary this&#39;n&#39;that  <br/>
from Master and Commander and trying to figure out what&#39;s with New  <br/>
Zealand accents, and when an American speaks, wondering if I would be  <br/>
able to tell someone from NZ or Australia or Scotland what part of t  <br/>
he U.S.  that person was from.  Sometimes yes.  Sometimes I might be  <br/>
wrong.  One guy was &quot;sounds like Paul Simon,&quot; but that doesn&#39;t mean I  <br/>
can name the part of NJ or NYC he might be from, but probably guess  <br/>
he&#39;s Jewish.<br/>
<br/>
Holly sent me e-mail in which she said one of the guys she had met  <br/>
told stories like Marty but had a Yankee accent.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if I&#39;ll have to ask for repeats of things said to me in  <br/>
Maine.  Eeep.  I rescued my granny and my boyfriend from India from  <br/>
an endless loop of &quot;come again?&quot; &quot;pardon?&quot; &quot;come again?&quot; one day long  <br/>
ago...<br/>

  Subject: [AlwaysLearning] about bullies<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve been accused of being a bully. The quote (put in public, on <br/>
  someone else&#39;s blog) is this:<br/>
<br/>
  -=-She&#39;s been a bully and disrespectful in the face of a humbled <br/>
  apology from someone wanting to listen and dialog, not once, not <br/>
  twice, but three times over twice that many years. It is sad for the <br/>
  very reasons you listed here: she does challenge thinking, gets <br/>
  questions going...I found it all very valuable until I experienced <br/>
  where the threshold of consistency ended: she&#39;s the boss, the <br/>
  authority, the one runnin&#39; the show. Not so mindful. It does however, <br/>
  free one to discard an ill fitting label, knowing I would no longer <br/>
  like to associate with it anyway.-=-<br/>
<br/>
  First, I have questions.<br/>
<br/>
  Was it the same person three times in six years who came, caused a <br/>
  problem, &quot;humbly&quot; apologized and then was &quot;bullied&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
  Can someone staying on her own site and her own list who is <br/>
  badmouthed there, and on a couple of blogs, be considered to be the <br/>
  one doing the bullying?<br/>
<br/>
  And I have comments.<br/>
<br/>
  A private apology for a public insult is never sufficient. To be <br/>
  fair, I wasn&#39;t allowing the &quot;apology&quot; onto the list because it was <br/>
  wrapped in insult and kinda dripping with venom and defensiveness. <br/>
  It didn&#39;t feel like an apology. It felt like someone begging me to <br/>
  let her back in please-please-please so she could be mean to me again <br/>
  once there was an audience.<br/>
<br/>
  People who say &quot;I would unschool, but I don&#39;t like Sandra&quot; (or <br/>
  whatever else flimsy excuse they make) just didn&#39;t want to unschool <br/>
  in the first place, but wants to blame it on someone or something.<br/>
<br/>
  Some people do better if they feel they have dangerous enemies. Some <br/>
  people want to tag me to be their dangerous enemy. I have no <br/>
  interest in being anyone&#39;s dangerous or dramatic nemesis. I don&#39;t <br/>
  have a nemesis nor do I want one. I hand out with my kids a lot and <br/>
  I write to other unschoolers. People who aren&#39;t unschoolers <br/>
  sometimes try to stop me. People who want me to say that anything in <br/>
  the whole world is unschooling if someone utters the magic word <br/>
  &quot;unschooing&quot; before requiring French lessons or Saxon math. I won&#39;t <br/>
  do that. So they try bullying.<br/>
<br/>
  Someone from Australia once wrote that they have the concept there of <br/>
  &quot;tall poppy syndrome.&quot; If someone is prominent, others try to chop <br/>
  them down.<br/>
<br/>
  My prominence is from consistency and longevity. I&#39;m still here. <br/>
  If I were chopped down and weren&#39;t here, someone could claim they <br/>
  chopped me down.<br/>
<br/>
  Someone chopped down the World Trade Center, and gets to say &quot;I did <br/>
  that!&quot; (Or his cronies get to say it, and they like to think he&#39;s <br/>
  being congratulated in Paradise where he&#39;s sitting at the head table <br/>
  being backslapped and saluted, maybe.)<br/>
<br/>
  Someone paints on a wall and sees that graffiti or vandalism and says <br/>
  &quot;I did that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Someone posts something hateful on a blog comment and says &quot;I did that!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  Meanwhile, what are her kids doing? Has she helped anyone, or <br/>
  herself, or her kids? Has she hurt me?<br/>
<br/>
  I see comments like these, and I think &quot;I helped with that.&quot;<br/>

  They stopped bullying their kids and they feel better about it.<br/>
<br/>
  I don&#39;t go to anyone else&#39;s house to see what they&#39;re doing. I don&#39;t <br/>
  e-mail people and invite them to my list; they find it on their own. <br/>
  If they come and start trying to change the list, or me, who&#39;s being <br/>
  the bully?<br/>

Sandra&#39;s stuff since the old AOL days.  Recent discussions here have <br/>
really helped me with my relationship with my son.  We&#39;re both <br/>
stubborn and particular and on occasion when we&#39;re both tired and <br/>
hungry and cranky we can really butt heads.  And at those times when <br/>
it seems easier to be cranky, that I hear Sandra&#39;s (and others here) <br/>
voice to be nicer to kids and to say yes (which I do most of the <br/>
time), that I take a deep breath and switch gears.  Or if I&#39;ve <br/>
already been cranky, take a deep breath and go make things right <br/>
(apology, hug, go get the necessary item).<br/>
<br/>
So thanks from me, too!<br/>

some friends.  We were looking for a particular lighthouse we <br/>
intended to visit and although we were in the right area, we were <br/>
going around in circles.  We had the idea to ask someone for <br/>
directions, so we pulled over in front of a Victorian house where <br/>
there was a elderly looking man sitting out on his porch.  Jimmy, my <br/>
husband, walked up to the guy and asked him for directions.<br/>
<br/>
They spoke for a few moments (we could see the guy gesturing and <br/>
pointing and Jimmy nodding) and then Jimmy walked back to the car grinning.<br/>
<br/>
Kevin, our friend who was driving said, &quot;What did he say?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy said, &quot;I have NO idea!&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017887606">Hi. This is Melissa, who wrote the blog post praising Sandra&#39;s site and book that drew <br/>
negative comments from a reader who called Sandra a bully and made other accusations. I <br/>
wanted to go on the record, both here and on my blog (which I have done in three <br/>
comments below the post, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://liltinghouse.clubmom.com/the_lilting_house/">http://liltinghouse.clubmom.com/the_lilting_house/</a><br/>
2007/06/lovely_lovely_l.html), that while I&#39;m sorry the reader, Tia, was frustrated by her <br/>
experience on this list, I believe Sandra to be a person of integrity, most certainly NOT a <br/>
bully or mean-spirited in any way.<br/>
<br/>
I have been a lurker on this and other unschooling lists on and off since 1995, and I&#39;ve <br/>
learned a tremendous amount from Sandra and other voices here. I really appreciate the <br/>
time and energy you have poured into sharing insights and information. Thanks so much.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, we can *understand* the &quot;R&#39;s&quot; just fine, and we even think we&#39;re<br/>
saying them...<br/>
<br/>
My husband and I were married in New Hampshire in 1988, my whole family is<br/>
from Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
Dh&#39;s brother, a Midwesterner from birth, drove to the wedding from Logan<br/>
airport in Boston. Afterwards, he asked my mother for directions to her<br/>
house, where he would be sleeping.<br/>
<br/>
She said, according to John, &quot;Go straight to Zaya&#39;s packing lot. Then turn<br/>
left.&quot; Well, he drove straight and straight and straight for about 60 miles.<br/>
Never saw a packing lot (looking for trucks being packed) named Zaya&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Zayer&#39;s parking lot was only 5 miles from where they were. He didn&#39;t bring<br/>
phone numbers with him, and ended up sleeping at the airport, mystified.<br/>
<br/>
It was weeks later when he told me the story, and I was able to clarify what<br/>
she really said. After doubled-over laughter of course.<br/>
:o)<br/>

PS I eliminated my accent after months of conscious work during college. I<br/>
did it because I was tired of comments from people. Before that, I couldn&#39;t<br/>
hear the accent in anyone around me. After that, it was clear as a bell (and<br/>
I have to say a little irritating...I don&#39;t know why)!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve noticed around here (in Massachusetts) that most college <br/>
educated people do not have much of an accent. So I suspect that <br/>
they lose their accents at college. That&#39;s kind of sad because I <br/>
enjoy hearing different accents.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, most people here do not consider New Yorkers Yankees. You <br/>
have to be a New Englander to be called a Yankee.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and some of those R&#39;s that got dropped appear at the end of <br/>
other words, such as &quot;idear&quot; and &quot;drawr&quot;. It&#39;s said just ever so <br/>
slightly though. This is not unique to the local accent here. I&#39;ve <br/>
heard BBC reporters say Indiar many times. <br/>

<br/>
Right.  It&#39;s relative to where the speaker is, and to scale.  In  <br/>
England, I&#39;m a yankee.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If I tell you I live in northern New Mexico, that&#39;s technically  <br/>
true.  And it&#39;s good enough for distant places.  But within New  <br/>
Mexico, this isn&#39;t &quot;northern New Mexico.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Same with other local designations, I&#39;m sure.  I don&#39;t think southern  <br/>
California is 1/2 the state, nor is West Texas something to draw a  <br/>
line down the middle of Texas to find.<br/>
