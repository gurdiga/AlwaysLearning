&lt;&lt; There seems to be some kind of power struggle going on.  If it is not <br/>
 a power struggle, then the only other explanation is they don&#39;t <br/>
 really get the nuances of unschooling and are arguing out of <br/>
 ignorance. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I feel the same way. I won&#39;t import your quote right now, too much heat <br/>
going on for it to be helpful.  <br/>
It seems after a certain amount of time at a list, a person should get the <br/>
feel for it or move on to a list that they find more helpful.<br/>
Ignorance is understandable, outright stupidity is annoying.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Any good theories here? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Ok, you asked.<br/>
These are necessarily good theories, nor proveable, but they are just my <br/>
theories after all....<br/>
I think some people think unschooling/homeschooling are synonamous (sp?) and <br/>
once they learn that there is a BIG difference, they either don&#39;t want to <br/>
admit they aren&#39;t unschooling, or they think that unschooling is a big, huge <br/>
definition and feel threatened when someone says &quot;you aren&#39;t really doing <br/>
that&quot;.<br/>
Which I totally don&#39;t understand either, but it seems to piss some people off <br/>
to be told they aren&#39;t unschooling, as though unschoolers were saying &quot;you <br/>
aren&#39;t allowed to use that label&quot; instead of what is really being said.<br/>
I think they feel that people are trying to &quot;own&quot; unschooling, rather than <br/>
point them towards a better way of doing it.<br/>
At unschooling.com you&#39;ve got even more to deal with, in the fact that you <br/>
have someone totally intimidated by you, Sandra. Not only intimidated, but <br/>
angry that you have helped a lot of people. There is a huge amount of <br/>
jealousy imo.<br/>
Some people crave power, others simply enjoy being activists, there is a big <br/>
difference.<br/>
I enjoy activism on the unschooling front (now that I finally, really get it <br/>
myself) as I think most of the people here and over there do.<br/>
But some people just want to control. They want new people to come to them <br/>
and follow their advice. They want everyone to notice them. And when most <br/>
people are noticing others, they have to throw little tantrums to get the <br/>
attention back to themselves.<br/>
Combine that with the intimidation factor, and you&#39;ve got a conniving, <br/>
jealous, insecure problem.<br/>
ugh.<br/>
I think the intimidation with you Sandra, is because you can back up the <br/>
things you say with solid facts.  A lot of people get put off when the words <br/>
they say get questioned over and over but the person questioning is always <br/>
able to back up their point.<br/>
I know that was hard for me at first.<br/>
But then it caused me to think more carefully about what I was saying and <br/>
whether it was true or not. Many things I previously said or believed were <br/>
just cassette tapes running, without too much thought attached.<br/>
Some will get miffed and blame you for it, others are able to self examine <br/>
and think about what is being said.<br/>
Fortunately, most people that can&#39;t handle self examination, or any real <br/>
thought on the matter, go away. They might come back when they&#39;re ready to <br/>
delve deeper, but they usually don&#39;t hang out going &quot;nyah, nyah, you can&#39;t <br/>
tell me I&#39;m not unschooling!&quot; and argueing about sensible ideas.<br/>
Unfortunately for unschooling.com, we have exactly that problem right now.<br/>

Aaaah, thanks for the laugh everyone. You&#39;re all so damn witty!  These laughs <br/>
were really needed today.<br/>
Not to be a downer, but my Mom was buried a couple days ago, and my sis sent <br/>
me the pics last night via email. So I sat at the computer and cried for a <br/>
while before going to bed.<br/>
Then I get the joy of opening an Always Learning digest. Always uplifting it <br/>
should be called. <br/>
It&#39;s funny what a wonderful, uplifting and happy tone this list has compared <br/>
to the other. I wonder if any of the people that cry &quot;you&#39;re being mean&quot; at <br/>
Sandra ever notice the dichotomy?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it is just the former, though.  As when someone who uses ABeka says <br/>
&quot;but we unschool after 3:00 and in the summer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When people say a spider isn&#39;t an insect are they trying to &quot;own&quot; spiders? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I love when people say if a word isn&#39;t in the dictionary they can use it <br/>
however they want to.  Some extend that to words IN the dictionary! &lt;g&gt;  But <br/>
if no one had ever done that, Lewis Carroll couldn&#39;t have written that cool <br/>
thang (which is....   I wonder if I can find it).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s where I go to look things up when it&#39;s quicker than google <br/>
(occasionally):  sandradodd.com/biblicalsticks which is a sub-page of <br/>
Thinking Sticks, and has links to two concordances--the KJV Bible, and to a <br/>
site with tons of literature you can search. <br/>
<br/>
Got it.  From Through the Looking Glass.  But before pasting I must say that <br/>
for Christmas I gave away a DVD of the movie Jabberwocky, and that there is a <br/>
new gaming store in Albuquerque called &quot;Clockwork Jabberwock,&quot; where my kids <br/>
play on Saturday nights.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;...There&#39;s glory <br/>
for you!&#39; <br/>
`I don&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;glory,&quot;&#39; Alice said. <br/>
Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. `Of course you don&#39;t-- <br/>
till I tell you. I meant &quot;there&#39;s a nice knock-down argument for <br/>
you!&quot;&#39; <br/>
`But &quot;glory&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;a nice knock-down argument,&quot;&#39; Alice <br/>
objected. <br/>
`When _I_ use a word,&#39; Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful <br/>
tone, `it means just what I choose it to mean--neither more nor <br/>
less.&#39; <br/>
`The question is,&#39; said Alice, `whether you CAN make words mean <br/>
so many different things.&#39; <br/>
`The question is,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty, `which is to be master-- <br/>
that&#39;s all.&#39; <br/>
Alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute <br/>
Humpty Dumpty began again. `They&#39;ve a temper, some of them-- <br/>
particularly verbs, they&#39;re the proudest--adjectives you can do <br/>
anything with, but not verbs--however, _I_ can manage the whole <br/>
lot of them! Impenetrability! That&#39;s what _I_ say!&#39; <br/>
`Would you tell me, please,&#39; said Alice `what that means?&#39; <br/>
`Now you talk like a reasonable child,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty, <br/>
looking very much pleased. `I meant by &quot;impenetrability&quot; that <br/>
we&#39;ve had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well <br/>
if you&#39;d mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don&#39;t <br/>
mean to stop here all the rest of your life.&#39; <br/>
`That&#39;s a great deal to make one word mean,&#39; Alice said in a <br/>
thoughtful tone. <br/>
`When I make a word do a lot of work like that,&#39; said Humpty <br/>
Dumpty, `I always pay it extra.&#39; <br/>
`Oh!&#39; said Alice. She was too much puzzled to make any other <br/>
remark. <br/>
`Ah, you should see &#39;em come round me of a Saturday night,&#39; <br/>
Humpty Dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to <br/>
side: `for to get their wages, you know.&#39; <br/>
(Alice didn&#39;t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you <br/>
see I can&#39;t tell YOU.) <br/>
`You seem very clever at explaining words, Sir,&#39; said Alice. <br/>
`Would you kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called <br/>
&quot;Jabberwocky&quot;?&#39; <br/>
`Let&#39;s hear it,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty. `I can explain all the <br/>
poems that were ever invented--and a good many that haven&#39;t <br/>
been invented just yet.&#39; <br/>
This sounded very hopeful, so Alice repeated the first verse: <br/>
&#39;Twas brillig, and the slithy toves <br/>
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; <br/>
All mimsy were the borogoves, <br/>
And the mome raths outgrabe. <br/>
`That&#39;s enough to begin with,&#39; Humpty Dumpty interrupted: <br/>
`there are plenty of hard words there. &quot;BRILLIG&quot; means four <br/>
o&#39;clock in the afternoon--the time when you begin BROILING <br/>
things for dinner.&#39; <br/>
`That&#39;ll do very well,&#39; said Alice: and &quot;SLITHY&quot;?&#39; <br/>
`Well, &quot;SLITHY&quot; means &quot;lithe and slimy.&quot; &quot;Lithe&quot; is the same <br/>
as &quot;active.&quot; You see it&#39;s like a portmanteau--there are two <br/>
meanings packed up into one word.&#39; <br/>
`I see it now,&#39; Alice remarked thoughtfully: `and what are <br/>
&quot;TOVES&quot;?&#39; <br/>
`Well, &quot;TOVES&quot; are something like badgers--they&#39;re something <br/>
like lizards--and they&#39;re something like corkscrews.&#39; <br/>
`They must be very curious looking creatures.&#39; <br/>
`They are that,&#39; said Humpty Dumpty: `also they make their <br/>
nests under sun-dials--also they live on cheese.&#39; <br/>
`Andy what&#39;s the &quot;GYRE&quot; and to &quot;GIMBLE&quot;?&#39; <br/>
`To &quot;GYRE&quot; is to go round and round like a gyroscope. To <br/>
&quot;GIMBLE&quot; is to make holes like a gimlet.&#39; ...&quot;</div>

 </span></blockquote>Stupidity is annoying, yes, but it refers to innate<br/>
ability to learn and use what has been learned. Us<br/>
stupid people really can&#39;t help it. Some of us stupids<br/>
are ignarant too, because we have learning problems,<br/>
but smart ignorant people are beyond my understanding.<br/>
Maybe it is because I am a stupid ignarant person, but<br/>
I think there is NO excuse for a smart adult person to<br/>
be ignorant in any area in which they choose to<br/>
participate and express opinions. I thought that being<br/>
informed about ones opinions was one of the qualities<br/>
that constituted being an adult.<br/>

don&#39;t you think it could have been a HUGE reason why you have so much <br/>

Perhaps without that experience, you wouldn&#39;t have pointed quite so many <br/>

I was thinking about what you said, and I had a different take on it.  You <br/>
probably made school more bearable for the kids that had to be there.  If a <br/>
kid MUST be in a classroom setting, they at least deserve a teacher who <br/>
understands and cares.  &lt;shrug&gt;  I don&#39;t think you need to carry that burden. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think unschooling gets used in various ways in isolated pockets throughout<br/>
the country to define things that don&#39;t have a word for them.<br/>
<br/>
If you had only (locally) heard unschooling used for the learning kids do<br/>
when they aren&#39;t doing lessons, or used for what we&#39;d call eclectic, then<br/>
why, when you encounter some other group using unschooling differently,<br/>
should you assume the group is right and the people around you who&#39;ve helped<br/>
you a lot are wrong? Who *is* this other group who thinks they own the word<br/>
unschooling? So what if some particular dead guy made it up? Words change.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike the La Leche League, there aren&#39;t guide books to define terms for all<br/>
the hundreds (?) (thousands (?)) of support groups out there. For people not<br/>
on line, it undoubtedly feels like they&#39;re starting from scratch.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we could come up with terms for those things that unschooling gets<br/>
used for so we can hand them out so they don&#39;t have to keep using<br/>
unschooling ;-)<br/>
