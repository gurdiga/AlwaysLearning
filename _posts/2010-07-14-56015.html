<div id="ygrps-yiv-2141972713">Today, posted on an SCA-based list I have that can be still for months.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I haven&#39;t seen anything go on here in a while, which makes me sad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wrote (in addition to responding to the actual subject matter):<br/>
<br/>
People are busy.  If you post, they&#39;ll probably respond!<br/>
Nothing to be sad about.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say &quot;You&#39;re an adult; don&#39;t whine.&quot;  But I thought it.<br/>
