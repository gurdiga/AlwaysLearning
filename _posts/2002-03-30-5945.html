Museum in Atchison,  the Sedgwick Zoo and Botanical Gardens, the Wichita<br/>
Omnisphere Science Center and the KC Children&#39;s Museum.   There&#39;s the<br/>
National Black Historical Museum and the John Brown Museum and a cool<br/>
little town called Lundsford (sp?)  where they have cobblestone streets<br/>
and make Swedish salsa.<br/>
and have a GTO Museum if you like muscle cars.  ( I think you need a<br/>
tattoo to get in) <br/>
And the tall grass prairie... ( or is that Oklahoma?)  Well, Kansas is<br/>
pretty nice.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556391611">On the west side in Independence (or Liberty or Justice or something) there&#39;s <br/>
a newish museum of flight.  I don&#39;t know the name.  We were there when it was <br/>
still pretty rough, but that was COOL!  They let the kids just get in planes <br/>
and goof around.  Some of the stuff on the runway wasn&#39;t really cleaned up <br/>
yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Inside they had a temporary (I think) display on quilts based on airplanes, <br/>
from WWII.  Some women&#39;s magazines had printed quilt-square templates with <br/>
planes, and there were examples of quilts from the period. <br/>
<br/>
Bad and sad:  They did NOT have the patterns for sale in the gift shop.  They <br/>
hadn&#39;t thought of it.  OH NO!!!<br/>
<br/>
Other than that, I&#39;ve had fun in Kansas too.  There&#39;s a small anthropology <br/>
museum at the university in Lawrence that I just loved.  There&#39;s good music <br/>
and food there, too.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And the tall grass prairie... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s some in Kansas, because my friend Ted, who&#39;s an artist and <br/>
archeologist (way into pottery new and old), was involved in prairie <br/>
preservation.<br/>

My grandfather lived in Kansas City (dunno if it was<br/>
the Kansas or the Oklahoma side) as a child.  His<br/>
mother hid him under the bed during gun fights in the<br/>
street......<br/>

No, but this will make it easier to do so in the future. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have been failing to attend weekly folk music get-togethers here, and if <br/>
we don&#39;t get back into that habit we will be contributing to their demise.<br/>
