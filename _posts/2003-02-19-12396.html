<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Our 2 previous libraries (before we moved) had 6 week due dates for books<br/>
&gt; for teachers and homeschoolers.  I don&#39;t know if there was any limit on the<br/>
&gt; number. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We use the military library on post here, for which &quot;collection&quot; is the<br/>
wrong word.  They don&#39;t have a collection of books, they have a few books.<br/>
I have more than they do!  But we can check out from any military library in<br/>
Germany and then return to the nearest one.  So when we&#39;re at a big post, we<br/>
go to the library and then return to our cruddy local library.<br/>
<br/>
As far as due dates, they tell you when things are due.  4 weeks, I think.<br/>
And if you don&#39;t return your books on time, you eventually get a notice in<br/>
the mail saying that you are being bad because you have overdue books.  But<br/>
there&#39;s no fines, and the notices are generally sent when things are 3<br/>
months overdue, so most folks figure, SO WHAT!!?!<br/>
<br/>
I always wonder why they bother with due dates in the first place.<br/>

who has a library book from before Thanksgiving that she really is going to<br/>
read someday soon....</div>
