presenting to him any options that &#39;I&#39; thought too schooly.  I tell <br/>
the boys about all kinds of things which they show interest in or <br/>
not.  Do you limit what you tell your kids about by what you want them <br/>
to do, or let them look at all the options or information and make <br/>
their own choices?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244332266">You CANNOT tell them about all options. Impossible.<br/>
<br/>
So - that was an option you chose to tell him about. There are an <br/>
infinite number of other things you didn&#39;t tell him about.<br/>
