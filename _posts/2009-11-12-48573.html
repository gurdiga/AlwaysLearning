&lt;&lt;&lt;A friend of mine told me one day that her son was not  allergic to <br/>
milk, but she told people he was because she didn&#39;t want him  to have it.<br/>
One day she asked me to watch him, and as she was leaving, she  said <br/>
&quot;He&#39;s allergic to milk.&quot; He was like eight years old; not deaf, not  <br/>
out of earshot. So he knew his mom was lying. *I* knew his mom was  <br/>
lying.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When we first found out that Wyl had trouble with High  Fructose Corn Syrup <br/>
(HFCS), we had a hard time at restaurants finding out  ingredients in <br/>
things so he could chose things without it. We&#39;d ask the waiter  or manager very <br/>
nicely, tell them we didn&#39;t need to know *all* of the  ingredients (I know <br/>
how places are about their secret recipes, sometimes), but a  HFCS <br/>
*sensitivity* didn&#39;t seem to warrant much attention and they usually told  us they <br/>
didn&#39;t have any ingredients list to look at-even for things that I knew  (from <br/>
working in restaurants) had lists on them.<br/>
 <br/>
Some places, like McDonald&#39;s, have websites with *all* the  ingredients in <br/>
their core menu items, so we can go there and check what he can  have-we <br/>
have a good deal of what he can have at McDonald&#39;s memorized because our  local <br/>
homeschool groups meet there quite often in the cooler months. I wish  all <br/>
restaurants did that. <br/>
 <br/>
Once, when Wyl was off looking at aquariums or going to the  restroom when <br/>
the waiter came over, an idea occurred to me and I asked about  ingredients <br/>
because of an *allergy*. The difference was amazingly different. The  waiter <br/>
was very helpful and attentive and even brought me one particular label  to <br/>
read myself. Since then, I haven&#39;t had disinterest and only once or twice <br/>
was  there no label on a particular item we inquired about, but all the <br/>
others had  them on that particular day. <br/>
 <br/>
After the second time I tried &quot;allergy&quot;, I explained to  Wyl  and said that <br/>
by medical definitions, he doesn&#39;t have an allergy, but  using that word <br/>
really helps us get what we need to make an informed choice. He  is confident <br/>
enough to ask for himself, now, and he uses &quot;allergy&quot;, though he or  Dave or <br/>
I often assure the waiter or manager that it isn&#39;t an anaphylactic-type  <br/>
allergy and not life-threatening.<br/>
 <br/>
One local branch of a national chain has been *so*  friendly and helpful <br/>
that they have ordered a special pancake syrup  that hasn&#39;t got aspartame (we <br/>
like to avoid, but in avoiding HFCS, sometimes  that&#39;s our only alternative) <br/>
or HFCS. The manager keeps it in a special place in  his office and when we <br/>
come in, we just have to remind the waiter where it is  and they&#39;ll bring <br/>
it out to us. We didn&#39;t even think to ask that, he offered to  do this for <br/>
us, in the name of customer service, I guess. Or just because he&#39;s  nice. :~) <br/>
 <br/>
Occasionally, we talk about him not being &quot;medical definition  allergic&quot;, <br/>
and that his sensitivity may ease or go away some day (though Dave  still has <br/>
reactions to it).  He sometimes *does* choose to eat or drink  something <br/>
with HFCS in it, and it&#39;s usually a *long* time between those times,  because <br/>
he *doesn&#39;t* like how he feels when he&#39;s had it. <br/>
 <br/>
His brother doesn&#39;t yet show any signs of being bothered by it  and <br/>
sometimes people look at us funny when one kid doesn&#39;t have HFCS and the  other <br/>
does.  It&#39;s such a trigger-item in some circles that I think people  assume <br/>
that we&#39;re keeping it from our kids because of the natural-political  statement <br/>
it makes or the &quot;group&quot; it puts us in.<br/>
 <br/>
Though we&#39;ve never actually discussed that part, Wyl knows I&#39;m  lying (and <br/>
I suppose he knows he&#39;s lying as well) when we tell staff at a  restaurant <br/>
that he&#39;s allergic, but I&#39;m not lying *to him*-I&#39;m being honest with  him. <br/>
It&#39;s kind of weird to think of being dishonest to help my kid, but until I  <br/>
find something better that works across the board, I guess I&#39;ll stick with <br/>
what  works.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
