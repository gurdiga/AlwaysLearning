I typed up a report card for Alexx to get into college...  It was easy.  I took all the &quot;normal&quot; subjects--history, math, english, music, pe, etc.  And then I gave her a grade (As in everything).  Then I discriped what Alexx did in each subject.  &quot;Alexx has been volunteering at Rancho Los Ceritos, the local historic center, as a docent and also cataloging historical artifacts, after having completed their teen docent training program.&quot;  Alexx has been focused on real life math that she encounters daily in her life such as percentages, basic geometry, etc.&quot;  &quot;Alexx is currently reading blah blah blah.&quot;  The college thought it was great.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, about the math.  Alexx doesn&#39;t really do math on paper, never has, it&#39;s always been real life math.  She did have to take the math placement exam today, at her CC, we&#39;ll see how she did.  She wants to sit down and do written math this next year with me, so she can be prepared to do college level math.  I&#39;m not at all worried about it.<br/>
