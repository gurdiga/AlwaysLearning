<div id="ygrps-yiv-35770516">For the fourth time this weekend I just got a totally gross feeling, visceral <br/>
kind of creepy shuddery nearly-sick feeling.  I know exactly why, and I&#39;m not <br/>
knowing a good way to just get over it.  <br/>
<br/>
Help?<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s so far, and it&#39;s a wimpy nothing story and I&#39;m telling it with <br/>
apologies in advance.  It will probably seem stupid to most of you, but I&#39;ve <br/>
nearly puked and felt like crying.<br/>
<br/>
This is long and a bit gross, and medicalish, which will attract some of you <br/>
and not interest others.  Feel very free to pass it on by.<br/>
<br/>
Keith came and showed me a puncture wound and blood smear on his lower right <br/>
leg (calf kinda 1/3 way from the knee and at 2:00 if the shin is noon) and <br/>
said &quot;I can&#39;t tell if there&#39;s anything in here.  I was picking up dog shit, <br/>
and felt something and thought maybe it was a bee, and I slapped at it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I poked at it and there was DEFINITELY something in there, almost an inch <br/>
long, and not teensy.  A stick, it seemed.  And not near the hole.<br/>
<br/>
Had this been where Keith could see it well and get to it with his own left <br/>
hand, it would&#39;ve been no problem, but it was in an awkard place for a lefty <br/>
with a recently very bad right eye to do much about.  <br/>
<br/>
I could pinch either end of this thing and tell it was not really near the <br/>
surface on either side.  Keith got a needle and tweezers which was going to <br/>
do no good whatsoever.   <br/>
<br/>
I wanted to call our friend Steve who used to be an army medic in Viet Nam <br/>
and would think nothing of cutting Keith and putting in a stitch in our back <br/>
yard.  I wanted to take Keith to the clinic and pay $40 co-pay for them to <br/>
fix it.  No, he said, just take it out.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never been attracted to medical stuff.  I&#39;ve taken first aid courses, <br/>
girl scouts, red cross, school, brush up when I had a baby.  And I&#39;m find <br/>
with a kid emergency, and I can wrap bandages and although I don&#39;t like it, I <br/>
CAN do it.<br/>
<br/>
But one thing I&#39;ve never truly become comfortable with is what exactly is <br/>
inside people exactly where.  But I could tell this needed to be cut.  And <br/>
though we have in the past had disposable scalpels in the house, we didn&#39;t <br/>
yesterday.  I asked for a new Xacto blade, and just the thought made me <br/>
really glad I hadn&#39;t had breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up cutting Keith&#39;s leg three times.  Keith has a very high pain <br/>
threshhold.  If someone had cut my leg I&#39;d&#39;ve been screaming and yelling.  <br/>
Keith was very still and said &quot;go ahead, it&#39;s fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I have never cut human skin before, not counting my own accidently and really <br/>
fast.  But to look and think and consciously do it, I never had.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
like a formaldehyde frog, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I cut too shallow.  And I wanted to quit.  And Keith was being pretty <br/>
patient, knowing how I am.  He said maybe he should just wake Martin up (he <br/>
always calls Marty &quot;Martin&quot;) and get him to do it.  I figured I was better <br/>
than a groggy Marty, so I tried again.  And it took another cut on the other <br/>
side.  <br/>
<br/>
I was sticking fingernails into Keith-flesh to find the end of this damned <br/>
stick.  Finally I got it out with tweezers, and it was 3/4 inch long, a piece <br/>
of lumber.  Very sharp.  Fat, flat other end.  I thought it was a big thorn <br/>
at first until I washed it and saw woodgrain.  Room for growth rings to show. <br/>
 YUCK.<br/>
<br/>
But I was shocked at how strong skin is and how hard it was to cut it.  So <br/>
with this new knowledge I keep having memories of that and thoughts of other <br/>
wounds I&#39;ve had and seen and how much force it took.  It&#39;s just a piece of <br/>
new information, and kind of a new piece, and one I would have been happy to <br/>
have.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are things people don&#39;t want to learn, and I feel awful <br/>
whimpering about this when all my children are alive and healthy, that my <br/>
husband had a fat splinter.  It&#39;s not about that, it&#39;s about the physical <br/>
&quot;news&quot; of the situation and how it affected me.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not even sure what the point is.  Just I quickly feel like puking every <br/>
few hours this weekend, remembering that.<br/>
<br/>
If I could have typed it away or sung it away, or sewn it a little cap, that <br/>
splinter would have been SO merrily out of there!!<br/>
<br/>
So to those of you who ARE medically inclined and courageous and <br/>
knowledgeable, I&#39;m more impressed than before and grateful there are some <br/>
people who can and will do those things.<br/>
<br/>
Keith was glad and sympathetic to my discomfort, and we washed, <br/>
anti-bioticked and band-aided it, and though it&#39;s a little infected right at <br/>
the opening, just barely.  <br/>
<br/>
Keith never even winced.  He is so strong and so brave and I&#39;m such a total <br/>
crybaby wimp.<br/>

I wish it didn&#39;t make me feel better to know you felt queasy too, but it <br/>
does.  I thought there was something seriously wrong with me for it to make <br/>
me sick.<br/>
<br/>
It feels like adrenaline sick, like when I have a near-wreck but don&#39;t and my <br/>
legs ache and then I get shaky.   <br/>
<br/>
Keith was saying, &quot;Relax and breathe&quot; when I was holding three bloody kleenex <br/>
in one hand and a knife in the other.  Yeah.  I can&#39;t relax and breathe as <br/>
well as I usually can a day and a half later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517748056">Sandra, I&#39;m not medically inclined or anything, but I think it would <br/>
take great courage for ANYONE to cut into a loved one.  I&#39;ve even heard <br/>
of doctors who couldn&#39;t stomach it if it was someone they loved.  Good <br/>
for you!  I know we would have been making a trip to the dr&#39;s or the er. <br/>
  I&#39;ve often wondered what if something did happen to one of the kids or <br/>
Antone and I had to handle it right then.  I&#39;m hoping I never find out. <br/>

As far as feeling better, can you focus on how Keith is feeling now.   The good that you did and how he&#39;ll be fine now.     Try and not think about the other details?                    I&#39;m sure you&#39;re trying to do this but this is what came to my mind.              Good job,  Dr. Sandra,  &lt;g&gt;! Kelli                   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174467383">I think it&#39;s good someone without a medical background or interest feels<br/>
queasy about such things.   <br/>
I&#39;d be WAY more worried about you if you loved going after your husband<br/>
with a sharp new blade.<br/>
<br/>
And you did it.  That&#39;s something.  You&#39;re not a wimp if you did what<br/>
needed to be done.<br/>
When Dylan fell and gashed his forehead on my mil&#39;s coffee table she<br/>
screamed and ran outside!   If we hadn&#39;t been there what would have<br/>
happened?   I never left him with her, ever, and still wouldn&#39;t.<br/>
That kind of panic reaction is just freaky.<br/>
<br/>
So I think you&#39;re amazingly normal and healthy and I&#39;m happy to have<br/>
learned that about you.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of the other options would have been a little creepy, frankly. <br/>
But I&#39;m sorry you had to do it and sorry Keith was wounded.  Yuck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-105654223">There must be some tie in to the different intelligences that people have.  Is there a category for those who are fascinated, rather than repulsed, by medical stuff?<br/>
<br/>
My mom was a nurse by career, and it also seems to be a part of her personality.  I can handle minor things, but seeing inside bodies makes me very weak and queasy.<br/>
<br/>
She gave us our injections when we were kids.  (Although I&#39;m sure this was to save money, not because she really preferred to do it herself.  I think.)<br/>
<br/>
She is the best person to take care of you when you are sick.  She does things like fluff and turn your pillow to the cool side before you even think of needing it yourself.  When things happened, such as the time my brother got a huge piece of bark stuck inside his leg, or my other brother burned his hand, or the time I hit my head and had an immediate goose egg-sized bump, she acted calmly, applied the proper first aid, and did what needed to be done.<br/>
<br/>
She nursed my step-dad through chemotherapy and dying at home, including a final bath after he died but before we called the funeral parlor.<br/>
<br/>
How she was trained as a nurse is very interesting to me.  Nurses training in the 50&#39;s consisted of a three year residential program affiliated with a hospital.  From day one, they were actually DOING nursing, rather that spending two or three years in a classroom, THEN going into the hospital.  They had classes at the same time they did the apprenticeship/internship part.<br/>
<br/>
She now has severe rheumatoid arthritis and gives herself twice weekly injections, besides managing an arseol of medication.  She has tried, in vain, to teach me how to give her injections.  I just don&#39;t want to.  My kids have watched her do the injections, and Lisa did push the plunger once, after Mom inserted the needle.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a useful tip, for those who don&#39;t know it.  When you receive an injection, if you relax your muscles, the nedle will go in much easier.  If the muscles are tense, they resist the needle.  This is true for needles for blood draws too.<br/>

  For the fourth time this weekend I just got a totally gross feeling, visceral <br/>
  kind of creepy shuddery nearly-sick feeling.  I know exactly why, and I&#39;m not <br/>
  knowing a good way to just get over it.  <br/>
<br/>
  Help?<br/>
<br/>
  Here&#39;s so far, and it&#39;s a wimpy nothing story and I&#39;m telling it with <br/>
  apologies in advance.  It will probably seem stupid to most of you, but I&#39;ve <br/>
  nearly puked and felt like crying.<br/>
<br/>
  This is long and a bit gross, and medicalish, which will attract some of you <br/>
  and not interest others.  Feel very free to pass it on by.<br/>
<br/>
  Keith came and showed me a puncture wound and blood smear on his lower right <br/>
  leg (calf kinda 1/3 way from the knee and at 2:00 if the shin is noon) and <br/>
  said &quot;I can&#39;t tell if there&#39;s anything in here.  I was picking up dog shit, <br/>
  and felt something and thought maybe it was a bee, and I slapped at it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I poked at it and there was DEFINITELY something in there, almost an inch <br/>
  long, and not teensy.  A stick, it seemed.  And not near the hole.<br/>
<br/>
  Had this been where Keith could see it well and get to it with his own left <br/>
  hand, it would&#39;ve been no problem, but it was in an awkard place for a lefty <br/>
  with a recently very bad right eye to do much about.  <br/>
<br/>
  I could pinch either end of this thing and tell it was not really near the <br/>
  surface on either side.  Keith got a needle and tweezers which was going to <br/>
  do no good whatsoever.   <br/>
<br/>
  I wanted to call our friend Steve who used to be an army medic in Viet Nam <br/>
  and would think nothing of cutting Keith and putting in a stitch in our back <br/>
  yard.  I wanted to take Keith to the clinic and pay $40 co-pay for them to <br/>
  fix it.  No, he said, just take it out.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve never been attracted to medical stuff.  I&#39;ve taken first aid courses, <br/>
  girl scouts, red cross, school, brush up when I had a baby.  And I&#39;m find <br/>
  with a kid emergency, and I can wrap bandages and although I don&#39;t like it, I <br/>
  CAN do it.<br/>
<br/>
  But one thing I&#39;ve never truly become comfortable with is what exactly is <br/>
  inside people exactly where.  But I could tell this needed to be cut.  And <br/>
  though we have in the past had disposable scalpels in the house, we didn&#39;t <br/>
  yesterday.  I asked for a new Xacto blade, and just the thought made me <br/>
  really glad I hadn&#39;t had breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
  I ended up cutting Keith&#39;s leg three times.  Keith has a very high pain <br/>
  threshhold.  If someone had cut my leg I&#39;d&#39;ve been screaming and yelling.  <br/>
  Keith was very still and said &quot;go ahead, it&#39;s fine.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I have never cut human skin before, not counting my own accidently and really <br/>
  fast.  But to look and think and consciously do it, I never had.  It wasn&#39;t <br/>
  like a formaldehyde frog, that&#39;s for sure.<br/>
<br/>
  I cut too shallow.  And I wanted to quit.  And Keith was being pretty <br/>
  patient, knowing how I am.  He said maybe he should just wake Martin up (he <br/>
  always calls Marty &quot;Martin&quot;) and get him to do it.  I figured I was better <br/>
  than a groggy Marty, so I tried again.  And it took another cut on the other <br/>
  side.  <br/>
<br/>
  I was sticking fingernails into Keith-flesh to find the end of this damned <br/>
  stick.  Finally I got it out with tweezers, and it was 3/4 inch long, a piece <br/>
  of lumber.  Very sharp.  Fat, flat other end.  I thought it was a big thorn <br/>
  at first until I washed it and saw woodgrain.  Room for growth rings to show. <br/>
  YUCK.<br/>
<br/>
  But I was shocked at how strong skin is and how hard it was to cut it.  So <br/>
  with this new knowledge I keep having memories of that and thoughts of other <br/>
  wounds I&#39;ve had and seen and how much force it took.  It&#39;s just a piece of <br/>
  new information, and kind of a new piece, and one I would have been happy to <br/>
  have.<br/>
<br/>
  I know there are things people don&#39;t want to learn, and I feel awful <br/>
  whimpering about this when all my children are alive and healthy, that my <br/>
  husband had a fat splinter.  It&#39;s not about that, it&#39;s about the physical <br/>
  &quot;news&quot; of the situation and how it affected me.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not even sure what the point is.  Just I quickly feel like puking every <br/>
  few hours this weekend, remembering that.<br/>
<br/>
  If I could have typed it away or sung it away, or sewn it a little cap, that <br/>
  splinter would have been SO merrily out of there!!<br/>
<br/>
  So to those of you who ARE medically inclined and courageous and <br/>
  knowledgeable, I&#39;m more impressed than before and grateful there are some <br/>
  people who can and will do those things.<br/>
<br/>
  Keith was glad and sympathetic to my discomfort, and we washed, <br/>
  anti-bioticked and band-aided it, and though it&#39;s a little infected right at <br/>
  the opening, just barely.  <br/>
<br/>
  Keith never even winced.  He is so strong and so brave and I&#39;m such a total <br/>
  crybaby wimp.<br/>

&lt;&lt; The good that you did and how he&#39;ll be fine now.     Try and not think <br/>

<br/>
Well it makes me want to spend the $40 he saved! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
But then I cut him for nothing.  (Well, the hour and a half of sitting and <br/>
waiting we saved...)<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;d be WAY more worried about you if you loved going after your husband<br/>
with a sharp new blade. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Very good point!<br/>
<br/>
Later Marty said &quot;I could have done it, but I would have had to put duct tape <br/>
all over it first.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That referred to a time three years ago when I left for a while leaving the <br/>
kids, and Marty&#39;s friend Logan was over.  Logan can cause some trouble.  <br/>
Logan can&#39;t not.<br/>
<br/>
But they had duct taped Logan&#39;s wrists, and Logan wanted to be loosed.  Marty <br/>
cut the duct tape.  And Logan.   I drove up to them saying &quot;Marty cut Logan <br/>
with a knife!&quot;   Yikes.  We had NO butterfly bandages and we were out of <br/>
antibiotic (never again) so I dashed to a store one block away, and by the <br/>
time I got back Logan&#39;s MOM was here.    HOW embarassing.  So I have $18 <br/>
worth of bandage-assortment and the finest antibiotic non-prescription can <br/>
buy, and she&#39;s got a bleeding Logan (it wasn&#39;t so bad, but scary) in her car <br/>
going to take him for stitches.<br/>
<br/>
She wasn&#39;t angry.   She knows that Marty&#39;s a sweet guy who has never <br/>
initiated anything crazy, and she knows Logan suffers in the comparison.  <br/>
<br/>
Of course *I* was mortified, and feeling guilty, and so Marty suggesting he <br/>
could stab Keith through duct tape added to my queasitude.<br/>

I sympathize with you.  I had to remove a HUGE splinter (about 4&quot;) from<br/>
my husband&#39;s leg 3 years ago and he has little to no tolerance for<br/>
pain.  I still think about it occasionally and get the shivers.<br/>
<br/>
Keith is very lucky to have you, a lot of people wouldn&#39;t have done it<br/>
(I&#39;m not sure I would do it again!).  The icky thoughts will fade in<br/>
time.<br/>

&lt;&lt; My mom was a nurse by career, and it also seems to be a part of her <br/>
personality.  I can handle minor things, but seeing inside bodies makes me <br/>
very weak and queasy. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s mom was a nurse, and Keith seems to know almost as much as she did, <br/>
only just naturally and from curiosity and just always remembering every bit <br/>
of info like that he ever heard.  He knows where all muscles are, what <br/>
they&#39;re attached to, how to stretch to undo any cramp.  He just UNDERSTANDS <br/>
it, at some level past recitation and sketching.  Maybe he has genetically <br/>
the same set of interests and talents she had which made her want to go into <br/>
nursing, and to be a kind of frighteningly efficient nurse who always got <br/>
promotions and ended up running intensive care before she retired.<br/>
<br/>
I bet it is a separate set of skills.  There&#39;s a relation to kinesthetic, and <br/>
maybe some to spatial reasoning.<br/>

I could&#39;ve done what you did for Keith though. &quot;Sorry, babe...let&#39;s get you <br/>

Sitting and talking with you wasn&#39;t hard...I actually am glad that I got a <br/>
chance to spend some time with you.  It&#39;d be interesting to see what you&#39;re <br/>
like when you&#39;re not in excruciating pain, though :)  Maybe you&#39;ll come east <br/>
