I really enjoyed reading the quotes, and Sandra&#39;s new blog.<br/>
The discussion about living in the moment had me thinking about how much we cuddle in my house.<br/>
Some out there in the world might think it&#39;s excessive, I know it&#39;s magical.<br/>
Logan, (4 in December and still nursing) and I wake up in the morning snuggled together, and then Logan will go over to my husband Paul, hug him and tell him to move closer to us. We&#39;ll all take turns being in the middle and hugging and kissing each other.<br/>
We continue to cuddle at various other times during the day.<br/>
There are also lots of fun hiding games we play in bed, hiding under the covers, pretending to hatch out of an egg, or being wrapped up like presents.<br/>
When Logan is feeling tired, overwhelmed, or upset, he&#39;ll tell me we need to go lay in bed and cuddle, sometimes he&#39;ll nurse, sometimes not.<br/>
The day ends the same way.<br/>
<br/>
If Logan went to pre-school right now like all of his friends, we&#39;d be missing hours of wonderful cuddling!<br/>
