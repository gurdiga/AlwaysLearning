<div id="ygrps-yiv-1630953427">Five periods, four 7th grade, one 6th, doing a guest-stint for our former <br/>
next-door neighbor.  Holly was with me.  During one of the two prep periods, <br/>
Holly went to choir, two doors up, and sat in with the sopranos.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really exhausted.  It was fun, but a pretty energetic song&#39;n&#39;dance for <br/>
me.  It involved walking back and forth, up to people, back to the board, a <br/>
little drama and acting (think televangelist without a podium).<br/>
<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
you are awesome.<br/>
<br/>
you are as good at that as i am at speaking<br/>
<br/>
i wish i could engage them more often like that but my hands are so tied by <br/>
the curriculum<br/>
<br/>
that was just outstanding.<br/>
<br/>
what i am gonna do with them is bring in bisochitos and do the ferdinand the <br/>
bull thing with them, i have a hunch they will love it just like the 6th <br/>
graders did. many ways to skin a cat<br/>
<br/>
holly is terrific. DO YOU NOTICE how much more mature and informed she is <br/>
than those kids??????? see what i mean? there IS a difference<br/>
<br/>
--------------------<br/>
A good review, I guess.  We got a lunch, and Holly go to see another school <br/>
and see a lot of kids her age in action.  I got to do a favor for a friend.<br/>

You had said before that Holly was thinking of going<br/>
to school next year to try it out.  What was her<br/>
impression of the day?<br/>

What is most important and valuable about the home as a base for children&#39;s growth into the world is not that it is a better school than the schools, but that it isn&#39;t a school at all.  John Holt<br/>

impression of the day?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The classes she saw had between 12 (!) and 20 kids.  She told Mo, the <br/>
teacher, that she might like to go there if she only had to go once or twice a week. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;    She told me when we got home that it wasn&#39;t as preppy as I had led her <br/>
to believe it would be.  Well, I had no idea it would be so casual.<br/>
<br/>
The school had good equipment.  No pool, but I saw four pianos, an art <br/>
complex with dark room, peeked some at the library--glory.  The cafeteria is more <br/>
like a student union building than a school cafeteria.  They had lots of choices <br/>
of food at two stations, and it wasn&#39;t expensive.  They could take it and eat <br/>
it wherever they wanted to.  There were tables there, but some were out on <br/>
benches, or in classrooms, and there&#39;s another big room with tables in the <br/>
administration building called &quot;The Common Room.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So what Holly didn&#39;t know is tuition is $10,000 a year. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What Holly asked me last night was if I went and worked there, would there be <br/>
a discount on her tuition?<br/>
<br/>
I told her what Mo had told me, that if I went and worked there, her tuition <br/>
would be *free.*<br/>
<br/>
That was a moment of trepidation for me.  I asked quite gingerly &quot;Do you feel <br/>
like you really want to go there?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
***WHEW!!!!***<br/>
<br/>
But I have to say, there were other things about the job as a teaching job <br/>
that were appealing.  I feel a little like an evangelist who spent the evening <br/>
at a strip bar, perhaps.<br/>
(Without the hard-on and the need to take my clothes to the cleaners and <br/>
destroy all the receipts.)<br/>

&lt;&lt; Where all the rich white kids from the heights went. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There were kids from Los Duranes and otherwise around Old Town, there were <br/>
kids from one family I know lives in the North Valley (not poor, but still not <br/>
&quot;the heights&quot;) and there was one girl who was most definitely African American <br/>
and didn&#39;t seem half, but I didn&#39;t ask her where she lived.  One girl who was <br/>
good at the game and particularly talkative was half Sandia Pueblo and half <br/>
Oklahoma Indian (as she put it on her bio-display, and I assumed to be mixed of <br/>
the Oklahoma reservation which WAS mixed when they marched some of the <br/>
southeastern tribes there way back when).  Her oldest item was a basket she said they <br/>
thought might be 500 years old, and next up some pots that were made by <br/>
great-great-great aunts maybe 200 years ago. I only saw the choir and those five <br/>
small classes, and it&#39;s 6th through 12th so I maybe saw 10 percent of the kids <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Part of why I know where some of them lived was that the room was covered <br/>
with a project where they had used photos and clippings and such to show why <br/>
their families were in Albuquerque.  Some traced back a long way, some just to <br/>
parents.  Some had photos of where they were before.   The style and tone of <br/>
these things (mostly big posters, but not all) were because the teacher, Mo <br/>
Palmer, used to work at the museum as photoarchivist, so they were doing basically <br/>
the kinds of things museums do for history displays.    One kid did one side <br/>
with antique post cards of Iowa, and the other with antique New Mexico <br/>
postcards, because one of his parents was native and the other was from Iowa.<br/>
<br/>
I started my little presentation with a question about what the oldest thing <br/>
they owned was.  One girl said they had a really old chandelier in her house.  <br/>
Yeah, like pre-electricity. Turns out the oldest part of her house was from <br/>
the late 18th century, then had 19th century add on and 20th century upgrades.  <br/>
 That was most definitely not in the northeast heights.  The really old <br/>
chandelier had been there since it was installed, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
One  kid  cited as the oldest item in his house a certain Grateful Dead album <br/>
his dad owned. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And then my point would end up being that the words they use every day are <br/>
older than all that stuff.  They&#39;d call out a word from the dictionary and I&#39;d <br/>
tell them what language it came into English from.  I won three rounds and lost <br/>
two.   Then I&#39;d tell them how I was figuring them out, that it wasn&#39;t <br/>
memorization or guessing, and I&#39;d call words to them that they could &quot;guess,&quot; so that <br/>
they saw it wasn&#39;t guessing.  They&#39;re doing Spain and the Moors and though I <br/>
don&#39;t know a lot about words that came into Spanish (or English) from Arabic <br/>
languages, there are a few we came across and the teacher was collecting those, <br/>
while my main stories involved the Norman Conquest and the <br/>
English/French/Norse tales, and how Latin terms came to be in English even though English is a <br/>
Germanic language.  It was a lot to cover in 39 minutes.  Couldn&#39;t believe <br/>
their periods were only 39 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
But it it used to be just rich white kids from the heights, it doesn&#39;t seem <br/>
to be now.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960056794">I graduated in 1980.  My younger brother just missed graduating in &#39;82 (got himself expelled for fighting 2 wks before graduation) and my sister left in &#39;84 before graduating (she was class of 85).  We lived on Morrow, just above Indian School & Chelwood -- actually Manzano district, but my parents insisted we all transfer to Eldorado.  Once they got me in -- with a JROTC sign-up -- my brother and sister were able to follow on family transfers.   We all went to Jackson for middle school. Well, when I went there it was still a Jr. High.<br/>
 <br/>
The real joke on my parents was that they wanted us at Eldorado because they were worried about the kind of kids we&#39;d hang out with at Manzano.  My first husband was introduced to me by a friend from Manzano I&#39;d kept up with.  He was a LosAlamos boy, but still it managed to cancel out their desire to have me make a better class of friends! LOL  <br/>
 <br/>
gotta go -- Andy has invited me to go to bed with him to watch Robot Jones.  It&#39;s a date I can&#39;t refuse!<br/>

&gt; I didn&#39;t go to Eldorado, but my good friend did. My older sibs went to<br/>
&gt; Manzano, but I went to Sandia. But I did go (briefly) to McCollum, and<br/>
&gt; then to Kennedy.<br/>

&gt; I graduated in 1980.<br/>

&gt; &gt;I was stuck going to Eldorado too, just as my husband was.  I lived<br/>
&gt; &gt;right off of Morris and Montgomery, from 8th grade til,. well, till I<br/>
&gt; &gt;moved out.  My early years, I went to McCollum, which is Morris and<br/>

&gt; &gt;I graduated in 1983.  :-)  When did you graduate.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;Did you grow up in Albuquerque?  You seem very familiar with our<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;little town!  I grew up in the heights, but I wasn&#39;t one of those<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&#39;rich&#39; white girls. LOL  I was stuck going to Eldorado..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1004572850">My brother (Matt Caton) and sister, Sunny, both went to Eldorado in the 80&#39;s.  Neither graduated, since they both gave up school sometime after our folks separated in 81.<br/>
 <br/>
I have lost touch with everyone I knew at Eldorado, and kept in touch with only one friend from Manzano.  I have &#39;found&#39; a few old friends, but they&#39;re living the regular life, with kids busy in soccer, AP classes and bitching about working too much and fighting with their husbands all the time, usually about the kids.  One friend from jr. hi I do see regularly at the neighborhood Target where she works (great use of that essential college education!) and her accounts of having her kids in Christian school are downright surreal.  I keep waiting for her to ask about my kids&#39; school situ, so I can say, &quot;My kids don&#39;t go to school&quot; with no further explanation -- maybe she&#39;ll finally think I&#39;m weird and stop sharing her stories with me....<br/>
