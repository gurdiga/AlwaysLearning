<br/>
Sounds like quite the adventure.  My husband is army, and I&#39;ve done moves<br/>
without him, too.  It&#39;s not exciting, but it is doable.  You&#39;ll be fine!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re currently stationed in Germany, though my dh is in Iraq now.  I&#39;m<br/>
currently dreaming of a trip to Istanbul, but my son (6) is pushing for<br/>
Egypt.  We&#39;ll have to see.  I haven&#39;t been out of Europe yet in my travels,<br/>
but friends who&#39;ve been to North Africa and the more tourist-friendly parts<br/>
of the Middle East tell us that the locals have been very kind to them.  All<br/>
the instability in that part of the world has been so hard on the people<br/>
that make their living from tourist money, and they are happy to see<br/>
Americans and Westerners in general.  And most people do seem to grasp that<br/>
not every American agrees with every American foreign policy!<br/>
<br/>
Hop a space-A flight and come see us up in Germany when you need a break<br/>
from the heat.  It&#39;s cold and rainy here these days!  I hope that it all<br/>
goes smoothly for you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-35293151">Hi Brenda.  I remember those chilly, rainy days in Germany.  We were <br/>
there before we came to Florida, and I miss it sometimes. That&#39;s <br/>
funny about your son as my dd is DYING to go to Egypt.  I told her <br/>
that we would check it out after we&#39;ve paid off some bills.  I have <br/>
no idea how feasible it is.  It&#39;s really not that far at all from <br/>
where we&#39;ll be.<br/>
<br/>
Kate, are you in Dubai?  Wow!  We certainly won&#39;t be in a desert <br/>
climate - more tropical.  But I&#39;ve read that there are lots of really <br/>
great deals for travel in Turkey too.  So I am hoping we can do some <br/>
cool stuff with our limited funds.  <br/>
<br/>
I am not going with a cocky superior American attitude, but I do know <br/>
some people who have that!  There are a lot of rumors about the base <br/>
closing soon.  The main purpose of the base for the past 10 years has <br/>
been keeping an eye on Saddam.  These things always take a long time <br/>
though.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is really excited.  She is so fascinated with other <br/>
cultures, especially things that seem exotic where people where robes <br/>
& head coverings, LOL.  She loves reading about Egypt, India, and <br/>
Japan particularly.  My two dds often drape each other with scarves <br/>
that I have from when I worked at Pier 1 and dance around to belly <br/>
dancing music.<br/>
<br/>
Once we get settled and all, I could probably get some coins or other <br/>
little Turkish doodads that are cheap and send them out to anyone <br/>
who&#39;s interested.  Since we&#39;re on a base, we have American postage.<br/>

4-wheeling out in the desert. Wadis are a gully or water run off area (dry<br/>
stream kinda thing) and people drive over the dunes and bounce across those<br/>
areas. It&#39;s wild and fun but very hair raising. <br/>

here better than Dubai but Dubai is more touristy and has more western<br/>
stuff to do. You can also drink in more places and there are less<br/>
restrictions there on clothing etc. than we find.<br/>

limited fund traveling has been our lifestyle! I don&#39;t use Space-A either<br/>
as it&#39; just always been too damn tricky to get a family of 5 or 6 on. <br/>
