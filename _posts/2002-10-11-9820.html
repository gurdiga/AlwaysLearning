<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897445131">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
My boys love being out in the mud... We have a very small back garden<br/>
half of which is taken up with one of those huge wood climbing<br/>
structures (one of our purchases because of homeschooling, so the kids<br/>
had a park in their back garden) and the other half is basically mud<br/>
now.  The boys are out pretty much every day now that it&#39;s cool (even<br/>
when it was hot they are out there) looking for buried treasure.  DH has<br/>
a fit when they are out there because he gets to clean it all up.<br/>
Usually mud ends up on all the walls, Zak turns on the hose and the<br/>
entire back yard is flooded.  Personally I have no problem with this.  I<br/>
put them on my back and carry them to the bath when they are done<br/>
(leaving the clean up for DH of course)....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad to hear this is a &quot;normal&quot; thing for kids to do when they<br/>
are unschooled.  I keep thinking I have to provide all kinds of things<br/>
for them to do and again that&#39;s about me not them.<br/>
<br/>
We have been talking about sending Zak to an alternative school.  He<br/>
went for 1 hour with me to visit the other day.  The school is an<br/>
unschooling school with with other kids (some of who were in our home<br/>
schooling group)...  He seemed to enjoy it and then casually in<br/>
conversation last night (at 1am this morning actually) my husband<br/>
announces that when he was talking to Zak he asked him whether he liked<br/>
the idea of going to that school and he replied &quot;no I&#39;d rather be at<br/>
home otherwise I&#39;d really miss my family, even if I can do what I want<br/>
to do there, I would miss mommy&quot;....<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say this news at 1am from DH in casual conversation was<br/>
something that I tossed and turned about all night.<br/>
<br/>
Zak and I are off to see a Shakespeare play this afternoon, put on by<br/>
our home schooling group.  <br/>
<br/>
I am so conflicted about how to balance my work (have my own business<br/>
from home) and unschooling the kids.  Does this conflict ever go away?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is it possible to send him to this school part time?  If he could go a day<br/>
or two, or half days, or something like that, he might be comfortable away<br/>
from you for that amount of time.  Or can you trade time with other<br/>
unschooling parents?  Or can you work mostly when his dad is home to look<br/>
after him?<br/>

hours per week. She or he could keep the kids occupied while you could get <br/>
work done.<br/>
