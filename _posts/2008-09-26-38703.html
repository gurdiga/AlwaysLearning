(I hope one or two of those links stays whole through the e-mailing  <br/>
process.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a small part of it:<br/>
<br/>
***************************************<br/>
I have had many conversations with unschoolers about people we know  <br/>
saying, &quot;I unschool, except for math&quot; and how what we really hear is  <br/>
&quot;I unschool, but I don&#39;t trust my child to learn what he needs to  <br/>
know, when he needs to know it&quot;. Unschooling, no matter how natural  <br/>
or not it is to you, is a constant leap of faith. It always comes  <br/>
back to whether or not you’re going to trust yourself, your children,  <br/>
and your family as a whole, to hold hands and jump. Unschooling is  <br/>
about constantly adapting to the understanding that although the  <br/>
obvious, easy, mainstream answer is to say no, you&#39;re going to learn  <br/>
to say yes, to say yes to deciding to trust your children’s ability  <br/>
to decide on their own what they need, and when they need it, and how  <br/>
they are going to get it. The ability to let go of a well-trained  <br/>
reaction to just say no doesn&#39;t come easy. You can jump of the first  <br/>
cliff, but it&#39;s parenthood, and there&#39;re going to be ten dozen more  <br/>
even scarier jumps than your first. If unschooling were a tree  <br/>
divided into parts trust would be the trunk. It holds everything  <br/>
else, all of your other ideals and wants and opinions of unschooling,  <br/>
up. It is sturdy and un-swaying and most of all necessary. After all,  <br/>
without a trunk there is no tree.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt said, &quot;To trust children we must first learn to trust  <br/>
ourselves...and most of us were taught as children that we could not  <br/>
be trusted.&quot; You need to start reversing this curse; trust yourself  <br/>
and show your children that they can be trusted!<br/>
<br/>
You might have noticed by now that unschooling is not the easy way  <br/>
out. It just Can Not truly be done halfway or with except-fors like  <br/>
math or bedtimes or diet. I have many sane, nice friends who I call  <br/>
&quot;except-fors&quot;. The big difference between my family as unschoolers,  <br/>
and their family as &quot;unschoolers except for&quot;, is that none of them  <br/>
have anything like the relationship I have with my parents.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could express to you how much I want these parents to  <br/>
realize that they could all change that one small thing, that whole  <br/>
trusting thing, and there would be communication between these people  <br/>
who feel they are from and in different worlds.<br/>
<br/>
*************************************<br/>
<br/>
I think people who have asked recently what they can do to influence  <br/>
relatives who don&#39;t understand might find some great quotes from  <br/>
that, or might could print it out and pass it on.   I&#39;ll put it here,  <br/>
too, for ease of printing out.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a link to Rue&#39;s book on parenting, too, which would help  <br/>
anyone here who&#39;s having any kind of difficulties understanding why  <br/>
it would help to give children more freedom and how it would work.<br/>
<br/>
One more thing.  At Rue&#39;s blog, which you should get to with the  <br/>
links above, but if not here:<br/>
http://another-roadside-attraction.blogspot.com/<br/>
has links to the boingboing discussion of John Holt, in case any of  <br/>
you  missed that.  There are comments now, and I personally fear to  <br/>
go.  I have too much on my list of things I&#39;ve forgotten to do lately  <br/>
to get involved in that today, but some of you might have some time  <br/>
and energy to spare.<br/>
