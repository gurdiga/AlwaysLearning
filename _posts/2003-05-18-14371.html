<div id="ygrps-yiv-777015192">****&gt; The beach, the swimming hole - who needs a pool?<br/>
<br/>
Me?<br/>
<br/>
I hate to put my feet where I can&#39;t see the bottom. I&#39;m not a big fan of<br/>
<br/>
swimming in lakes and oceans. I will, but it&#39;s not as pleasant. I get a<br/>
little<br/>
antsy. Give me the pool anytime! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Actually Kelly, I think I said that because this is the first summer in<br/>
quite a while when we don&#39;t have access to a pool and I&#39;m a little down<br/>
about that.  I&#39;m trying to convince myself that we will have swimming<br/>
fun despite no pool.  I actually don&#39;t care much for the swimming hole -<br/>
one of my best friends would get in there with the kids and swim, I<br/>
stayed on the shore.  But she has moved and now it&#39;s up to me to get in<br/>
there and swim.  Wish me luck, maybe the yuck factor will be low this<br/>
year..<br/>
