Wow.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s news of a congressional whatever to designate one day a year  <br/>
eat-with-your-family day.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s to cut down on drug use.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wow.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the ultimate in statistical correlation misapplied.<br/>

announcements about that through the intercom, only they were saying <br/>
dinner, not the whole day.  Chamille was a bit disgusted with it.  I <br/>
believe her response was something like &quot;what the hell!?  Why do <br/>
people have to designate a day for eating together?  Why not just eat <br/>
together? Does it have to be dinner, what if they want to eat lunch <br/>
together?  Can they eat at a resaurant and have that count?  What if <br/>
nobody feels like making dinner that night, can they just eat snacks <br/>
while watching tv?  How does it stop someone from using drugs?  Why <br/>
don&#39;t people just hang out with their kids?  What if they do drugs <br/>
and eat together?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It was good for a giggle or two!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887707022">I agree.  I ate dinner with my parents every night and have very fond memories(total sarcasm).  especially of the ones with Dad drunk or better yet: holidays!!!  Drugs for me were either a nice break or a genetically predisosed inevitable... well, actually both.  See, *thats* the correlation.  Statistics ((eyesroll)).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400846334"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Family Day is September 24th.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of the Pizza Hut takeout boxes. Last few times I saw<br/>
them, they were covered with parenting advice. Suggestion on<br/>
conversation starters with your kids, what to ask if you wanted to<br/>
find out what they were up to in their lives, ways to squeeze in some<br/>
family time, such as eating dinner together once a week, etc.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s so ridiculous that we need to learn how to connect with our kids<br/>
through the advice on a pizza box that at first I thought it was funny<br/>
in an absurd sort of way and borderline insulting, but it occurred to<br/>
me that it&#39;s actually a pretty sad example of how disconnected many<br/>
families are.<br/>
