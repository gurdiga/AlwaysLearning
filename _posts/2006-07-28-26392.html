Third place.<br/>
<br/>
They went in pairs and he was last of an odd number so he got to pick  <br/>
who he bagged against as the bye.  He chose the regional manager, who  <br/>
beat him on time, but just by throwing the stuff in the bags however  <br/>
(because he wasn&#39;t really in the contest) which gave the judge a good  <br/>
opportunity for a dramatic double-take of fear when she looked in.   <br/>
But Marty fumbled the bar of soap, and then when he got it in the  <br/>
little bag, he dropped that.  So there went several seconds.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad we went, and we weren&#39;t at all the only people in costume!   <br/>
There were lots and lots.  The theme was &quot;Knights in Shining Armor,&quot;  <br/>
and the people from Marty&#39;s store had shields that said Marty and  <br/>
813, and there were photos of Marty in armor (two real and one  <br/>
photoshop).<br/>
<br/>
The bad thing was it was run as a crazed pep rally with tons of  <br/>
people screaming, and one store had brought a drum (snare drum and  <br/>
drummer), and some had air horns, and lots of people were whistling  <br/>
and screaming, and they dragged the whole thing out to nearly two  <br/>
hours.  It was pretty painful, but most of the people there were  <br/>
really happy.  It reminded me of a high school pep rally in a small  <br/>
gym, in all the worst ways, but I didn&#39;t even have bleachers to sit  <br/>
on.   It was Holly&#39;s first experience with that level of human frenzy.<br/>
<br/>
I feel sorry for the people who had come in tonight just to get some  <br/>
groceries and happened in on all that.  It&#39;s a big store, but there  <br/>
were four lanes open and four occupied by this wild party with  <br/>
placards and banners and plastic swords and kids dressed as fairy  <br/>
princesses and pirates and dragons and adults dressed as knights and  <br/>
monks and roman soldiers and cousins of Orcs and there was a DJ  <br/>
playing unexpected things for each paired race�radically different  <br/>
stuff.  One was a good rap song that would&#39;ve been helpful to get a  <br/>
rhythm going.  One was the theme from American Bandstand (not as  <br/>
good).  Marty<br/>
was working to something bizarre, some square dance song but I don&#39;t  <br/>
remember which.   Sometimes we couldn&#39;t even tell what the music was  <br/>
for all the screaming.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty got home he told us stories of what we had missed or  <br/>
couldn&#39;t know, and he was still totally adrenalated, so he walked up  <br/>
to the store to tell those who were working tonight how the contest  <br/>
went, and that let him walk off and discharge some of his energy so  <br/>
he could fall asleep and get up at 5:30 to go to work.<br/>
<br/>
He got a medallion that says Honorable Mention, and a $5 gift card  <br/>
(for having answered a trivia question). There were trophies for 2nd  <br/>
and 1st.<br/>
<br/>
Several of the people from his store thanked us for being supportive  <br/>
of the whole crazy thing.<br/>
<br/>
When they introduced him they didn&#39;t say he was homeschooled.  That&#39;s  <br/>
okay.  All I heard of the introduction, over the noise, was that he  <br/>
was planning to become a police officer someday.  I didn&#39;t know that  <br/>
was still the current plan.  Keith doesn&#39;t love that plan.  I asked  <br/>
him later what else he said.  He said he couldn&#39;t even hear so well  <br/>
himself, but they said he&#39;d been working there since December and  <br/>
that he was a really nice guy.<br/>

I am still laughing out loud at this description Sandra! Thank you for<br/>
sharing it. Tell Marty congratulations. I met him at Legoland last<br/>
March...actually had lunch with him and Mercedes&#39; gang, and he was SUCH a<br/>
delight! I can just see him bagging away!<br/>
