My son is really into making up his own recipes. The last time he made a &quot;cake&quot; I asked him if he wanted to look at some cake recipes to get an idea of the basic ingredients. He declined and proceeded to bake a very strange concoction that I didn&#39;t really enjoy. His siblings however thought it very tasty.<br/>
I tried to critique it with very detailed words &quot;it&#39;s a little bit dry, but very sweet&quot; etc.....<br/>
I also offered the cake recipes for reference again so he could try and figure out how to fix what he didn&#39;t like about his recipe....he declined once again.<br/>
I say offer the info. and let them go! She might like it just the way it is. I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to tell my son that the cake mix DID have flour in it, but he&#39;d probably respond with something about trying to thicken it up. LOL<br/>
Have info. available to her and offer it. If she doesn&#39;t want it then let her run with it and be supportive. It may turn out wonderful. My sis has a really incredible cake recipe that starts with a boxed mix and adds a bunch of other stuff to it. It&#39;s always a hit, so you never know!!<br/>

&gt;You are right Tia, it is realtive.  I don&#39;t use that<br/>

&gt;and misc (baking soda, spice, raisins, etc).  So you<br/>

&gt;Subject: Negotiating for Kids<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I said the sentence below, but there was more to it and it has been snipped.<br/>
&gt;My question was why use age as a difference?  If as unschoolers it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;advocated that we are all equal what does the teachers age have to do with<br/>
&gt;my six year old?  Either way I let him decide that he would speak for<br/>
&gt;himself with me standing right behind him.  The next week he didn&#39;t want to<br/>
&gt;go for the same reason he didn&#39;t want to go that week (he didn&#39;t want to sit<br/>
&gt;in the same place), so I didn&#39;t make him go.  This week he didn&#39;t want to go<br/>
&gt;again and it was the last class so I didn&#39;t make him go.... I&#39;m not signing<br/>
&gt;him up for anymore classes unless he really wants them, but that would be<br/>
&gt;part of learning about the unschooling process.  If this is a list for only<br/>
&gt;seasoned radical unschoolers I was unaware of that.  Because I disagree with<br/>
&gt;&quot;the leader&quot; does not mean I&#39;m wrong for my family.  There are no<br/>
&gt;authorities on unschooling.... Isn&#39;t that the whole point, that we each have<br/>
&gt;deal with our children the way that feels comfortable for our child and<br/>
&gt;learn what works and what doesn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I have not been responding to many of the posts because I feel that I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;want to get into a &quot;war of words&quot;, who can say things &quot;the best&quot; or<br/>
&gt;&quot;correctly&quot; so I&#39;ll go back to lurking, like many others and then when<br/>
&gt;someone says something I disagree with I&#39;ll just think it rather than bring<br/>
&gt;it up.  That way it&#39;s safer than having the whole of what I said pulled<br/>
&gt;apart.  It was one of the reasons to leave unschooling.com. picky, picky,<br/>
&gt;picky.....<br/>

&gt;Subject: Oatmeal Cookies<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I usually cut half the fat in cookie recipes with applesauce.  In some<br/>
&gt;recipes and for those with no nut allergies, you can substitute a couple<br/>
&gt;of tablespoons nut butter too for the same amount of margarine.  I&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;generally found you don&#39;t need the amount of fat they say.  You usually<br/>
&gt;don&#39;t need eggs in cookie recipes either.  &#39;Course I eat whale snot, so<br/>
&gt;there you go.   <br/>

&gt;writes:<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;It was a frustrating game,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;apparently the other team was elbowing our girls and pulling on  their<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;sleeves, and the refs didn&#39;t call any of it. Cacie could see why the<br/>
&gt;&gt; &gt;other girl would say this, it made some sense to level the field.<br/>
&gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; A good coach would be politely asking the ref why they weren&#39;t <br/>
&gt;&gt; calling  those penalties.  When refs let that stuff go, they&#39;re just<br/>
&gt;asking <br/>
&gt;&gt; for a rougher game.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think Cacie&#39;s coach is wonderful, and I think she&#39;s been lucky in<br/>
&gt;soccer to have two very gentle, nurturing head coaches (and both<br/>
&gt;assistant coaches have been good guys too, the one this year is a college<br/>
&gt;soccer player). Generally, in both of the leagues we&#39;ve played it, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;considered very bad form to contradict a referee&#39;s call or tell a ref<br/>
&gt;what calls to make, and I agree with that policy. It&#39;s a hard job, and<br/>
&gt;some of the refs are only 9 or 10 years old. They don&#39;t need someone<br/>
&gt;second-guessing their calls, even in a nice way. They can&#39;t see<br/>
&gt;everything. I know this coach has very respectfully spoken to the field<br/>
&gt;ref a couple of times after a game, about some calls, but I don&#39;t think<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s appropriate during a game. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The refs also seem to get better as the kids get older... Cacie plays on<br/>
&gt;a U9 and a U10 team, so the kids are  pretty young, and they tend to be<br/>
&gt;more thoughtless than vicious.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;But you can tell Cacie that the refs almost always  see the <br/>
&gt;&gt; retaliation, and will usually call the penalty on the person who <br/>
&gt;&gt; retaliated.  So that strategy would end up hurting her team.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I don&#39;t think they meant to retaliate, just to use the same tactics,<br/>
&gt;like, &quot;If someone from the other team is racing you for the ball, elbow<br/>
&gt;her out of the way, since that&#39;s what they alwsys do to us.&quot; Things like<br/>
&gt;that. The girl who had the idea is probably the most competitive kid on<br/>
&gt;the team, she and Cacie have argued before. Actually, this girl has<br/>
&gt;argued with a good number of the other girls. I had gone to my car so I<br/>
&gt;wasn&#39;t there when she and Cacie first got into it, but when I arrived<br/>
&gt;Cacie was in tears and there were three or four girls at her side<br/>
&gt;supporting her and telling her that G. has &quot;yelled at&quot; them, too. The<br/>
&gt;coach also hadled that nicely...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The game today was a very fairly-played 1-1 tie....<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dawn, I got lost in this thread.   Where Sandra say you were doing something wrong for your family? <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The way I saw it, she was speaking to the comment that a 6 year old could be &quot;expected&quot; to deal with an adult.   I imagine that thought set an idea in Sandra&#39;s head that she felt would benefit many of us.  If you had a notion that you were trying to toughen your son up by making him stand up to the teacher, you may have read what Sandra said and thought about it a little.  The rest of us got to think about this idea as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;You clarified that you were not trying to toughen up your little guy but did want him to feel he could question all people no matter their age.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;In a previous post, I *disagreed* with the concept that having family dinners was controlling.  After hearing my reasons, no one said they went against unschooling.  If they had I would have taken a harder look.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;At another time, I explained how we handle food choices in our home.   My ideas were challenged and I gained some new insight.  If I had not spoken up, I would not have benefited.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If you choose to stay in lurk mode, you will have to wait for someone else to ask the questions you want the answers to.  It may take longer but I guess it is safer.  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;If we all choose to lurk because we are afraid, we will miss out on some pretty great discussions.<br/>

&gt; &gt;...so I&#39;ll go back to lurking,...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hey Dawn,<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m sorry you feel like lurking.  I think we all understood your son<br/>
&gt;*wanted* to speak with the teacher.  Probably most of us would have done<br/>
&gt;the same thing, let him ask, be there for support, to clarify, whatever. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I think the broader subject of children being  left to deal with teachers<br/>
&gt;on there own  came naturally from that.  It&#39;s something  for all of us to<br/>
&gt;think about; do we advocate for our (less experienced, more easily<br/>
&gt;intimidated)  kids with people of authority?   Your post was a kind of<br/>
&gt;jumping off point.<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve appreciated your contribution to the list and I hope you change your<br/>
&gt;mind.  Thinking about this stuff makes us all smarter, better parents.   <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Anyone heard of Ellyn Satter&#39;s &quot;How to Get Your Kid to Eat, But Not Too<br/>
&gt;Much?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I read it nearly 8 years ago, but I remember thinking that she had a lot<br/>
&gt;of great stuff to say about the benefits of parents NOT controlling their<br/>
&gt;kid&#39;s eating from the very beginning, the psychology of eating, what is a<br/>
&gt;&quot;normal&quot; body size/type, etc.  Her bottom line is that it is the parent&#39;s<br/>
&gt;job to provide the food and the kid&#39;s job to eat... or not eat.  Reading<br/>
&gt;her book also helped me get over some of my own food hang-ups.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Pudginess before a growth spurt is normal for children, with some getting<br/>
&gt;more pudge than others.  Although extreme overweight is a risk factor for<br/>
&gt;several common American diseases, there are also skinny people having<br/>
&gt;heart attacks, strokes, or other health problems.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Oh, now I remember the other book I read that dealt with this issue! <br/>
&gt;Mother Dance, by Harriet Lerner.  She is a psychologist.  I found the<br/>
&gt;book hilarious and insightful on the issue of motherhood.  One of her<br/>
&gt;chapters deals with food and she tells of her own experience with<br/>
&gt;&quot;de-controlling&quot; her sons&#39; eating.  Very interesting.  At one point her<br/>
&gt;son ended up sneaking grapes at a buffet bc the parents were boycotting<br/>
&gt;something that had to do with grape-growing industry and would not allow<br/>
&gt;grapes in the house.  Sneaking food has more to do with control than with<br/>
&gt;whether the food is &quot;healthy&quot; or not.<br/>

&gt;Lots of food issues are control issues rather than<br/>
&gt;what they superficially appear to be. Anorexia is not<br/>
&gt;about beauty, but control. Diets and binge diets are<br/>
&gt;control....purging is about control. If contol was<br/>

&gt;Sneaking food does have to do with control.  However, an aversion to <br/>
&gt;sweets might have to do with a physical problem such as a hormonal <br/>
&gt;imbalance, hypoglycemia, etc. <br/>

&gt;Thanks Julie<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;About 2lb ( a mess) fresh, WASHED, locally grown<br/>
&gt;collards (local may be the difference), cut up with<br/>
&gt;most of the thick center vein removed. Cover with<br/>
&gt;water in a pot big enough to hold them all, add a glop<br/>
&gt;of vegetable oil (fat back or bacon  is<br/>
&gt;traditional....but so is arteriosclerosis), I use<br/>
&gt;canola. Salt, black pepper, and about 1 quarter cup of<br/>
&gt;sugar (honey has a nice flavor, too...bet your thyme<br/>
&gt;honey would be good and would make it yours). Stir it<br/>
&gt;all together and boil, reduce heat, simmer until they<br/>
&gt;are how as tender as you prefer.  I like mine with<br/>
&gt;vinegar (various kinds) DH likes his with corn-bread<br/>
&gt;crumbled or broken in chunks and salsa and LOTS of<br/>
&gt;Seminole Seasoning (a salt substitute with salt in<br/>
&gt;it)or hot sauce and Seminole Seasoning. Roy, and his<br/>
&gt;brothers, and most kids, like theirs, as is.  Left<br/>
&gt;overs can be frozen in the juice and zapped later, or<br/>
&gt;heated on the stove top.  Old country folks save the<br/>
&gt;pot liquor (the juice) and drink it as a beverage. <br/>
&gt;Collards are high in everything, including calcium,<br/>
&gt;iron, anti-oxidants, B vitamins, ruffage (give some<br/>
&gt;folks gas, but it is the same people who get gas with<br/>
&gt;brocoli, cauliflower, cabbage, and all the rest) and<br/>
&gt;other good stuff I don&#39;t really know about...a little<br/>
&gt;K and ????<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Adrian had a good appetite! and secure enough to be<br/>
&gt;willing to try new foods. <br/>

&gt;Subject: My daughter&#39;s baking experiments<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;From an unschooling perspective, how would you deal with this? My <br/>
&gt;daughter is 8 1/2 years old and is trying to create her own recipe <br/>
&gt;for a baking contest.  She baked her cake tonight and she&#39;s planning <br/>
&gt;on decorating it and letting us taste it tomorrow.  Here are the <br/>
&gt;ingredients she used:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2 eggs<br/>
&gt;6 oz. pack of strawberry jello<br/>
&gt;one box of vanilla cake mix<br/>
&gt;half a cup of butter<br/>
&gt;1 cup of milk<br/>
&gt;half a tablespoon of baking powder<br/>
&gt;half a cup of sugar<br/>
&gt;half a cup of water<br/>
&gt;2 cups of flour<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;So...If I taste this and it&#39;s not that good, do I tell her the truth? <br/>
&gt;(I&#39;m inclined to think I should.)  Do I point out to her that the <br/>
&gt;cake mix already contains flour and other ingredients so she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
&gt;have had to add them again?  Or do I not tell her and let her figure <br/>
&gt;it out on her own? <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks,<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;Yes...my oldest DS had a overt aversion to sugar in<br/>
&gt;all forms.  Then once when I was at work and XDH ,<br/>
&gt;well, anyway, DS (6 at the time) drank a 16 oz coke.<br/>
&gt;Caffine and sugar....Blam!! He hallucinated, poor<br/>
&gt;little guy was in a panic when I got home. Yosemite<br/>
&gt;Sam and dragons going in and out of the screen wire,<br/>
&gt;he was shivering, though it was a hot summer<br/>
&gt;night...Poor baby....He still sensibly avoids<br/>
&gt;artificial stimulants and excessive sugar. No problems<br/>
&gt;for other 3 DS.<br/>

&gt;She already baked it?  Actually it probably will be<br/>
