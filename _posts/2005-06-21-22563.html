<div id="ygrps-yiv-933114354">The Guardian had a review of Steven Levitt and his book Freakonomics<br/>
(<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1510858,00.html)">http://books.guardian.co.uk/news/articles/0,6109,1510858,00.html)</a><br/>
this morning.  I&#39;ve not read the book, but the first few paragraphs of<br/>
the review seemed like a nice example of how rewards can have a very<br/>
unintended result:<br/>
<br/>
Steven Levitt&#39;s three-year-old daughter, Amanda, had not long finished<br/>
potty training when she decided she actually preferred nappies.<br/>
Levitt&#39;s wife, Jeannette, used all the methods she knew to convince<br/>
the toddler otherwise but to no avail. Levitt, the author of hit book<br/>
Freakonomics, intervened. He promised Amanda some M&M&#39;s whenever she<br/>
used the potty.<br/>
<br/>
For the first few days it worked well with sweets changing hands in<br/>
return for timely toilet visits. On the third or fourth day Levitt,<br/>
38, took Amanda to the toilet. She passed just a dribble and took the<br/>
sweets. A few minutes later she was back on the toilet, passing yet<br/>
another dribble and putting her hand out for yet more sweets. She&#39;d<br/>
rumbled the system. Levitt smiles.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I never thought my three-year-old daughter could outwit my incentives<br/>
in just three or four days,&quot; he says. &quot;But it&#39;s a great example of how<br/>
incentives can have unpredictable effects.&quot; <br/>
