<div id="ygrps-yiv-1619390859">Monday, November 24th, will be the seventh anniversary of the  <br/>
AlwaysLearning list, and we&#39;ll begin our 8th year.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve missed most or all of the other anniversaries, but seven seems  <br/>
like a good, special number to note.<br/>
<br/>
The internet is going through another large change, and so these  <br/>
lists might become as outdated as usenet groups.   (Never heard of  <br/>
them?  Exactly.  Some of the still-living ones were moved to google  <br/>
groups, in a nursing-home sort of way.)   The happy burgeoning edge  <br/>
of internet exchanges is now ning groups and blogs.<br/>
<br/>
Still, with over 1900 members on the lists, we&#39;ll probably reach 2000  <br/>
before the end of the year.  I figure there are  a few hundred who  <br/>
aren&#39;t reading or whose mail is bouncing, but there are over 1000 for  <br/>
sure who do read sometimes and a few hundred who read very  <br/>
regularly.   The membership rolls are definitely not padded.  While  <br/>
some lists have invited lots of people and continue to gather up new  <br/>
members for the sake of bragging rights, this list has rarely been  <br/>
promoted.  Generally, people really want to be here and don&#39;t stumble  <br/>
on it by accident!<br/>
<br/>
The AlwaysLearning archive has over 40,000 posts, and few are fluff.   <br/>
In these seven years, five months have had over 1,000 posts.  Five  <br/>
months had fewer than 100.  With an average of close to 500 posts a  <br/>
month, that&#39;s a lot of information.   That&#39;s thousands of ideas and  <br/>
stories and questions and answers.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who&#39;ve read, contributed and taken these ideas  <br/>
out into the world within and outside of your families.  The world is  <br/>
richer.<br/>

I love anniversaries :-)!  I have been a part of this group for at least 4<br/>
years and I think learnt about it from Rue Kream&#39;s book - raising a free<br/>
child.  I cannot keep up with all of the emails, but I read the digest<br/>
regularly and follow the discussions that catch my eye.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for keeping this group going!  While local support was vital when<br/>
we decided to unschool (almost 7 years ago), but it is also nice to know<br/>
that you are supported nationally. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181585092">I realized that after I pressed the &quot;send&quot; button :)!  <br/>
<br/>
I was born and raised in Moscow, Russia - went thru the Soviet <br/>
educational system - one of the most rigorous educational systems in <br/>
the world - did extremely well.  Once I immigrated to the US, I <br/>
received an undegraduate and graduate degrees in business and law <br/>
degree immediately thereafter.  With a total of 18 years of highly <br/>
pressured schooling I totally embrace unschooling - I am a very <br/>
passionate advocate of unschooling!!!  I am delighted that my <br/>
children were born in United States and unschooling is a legal and <br/>
viable option, as I don&#39;t think it is legal to unschool in Russia or <br/>
if it is legal, it would be extremely difficult!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690714085">Hello Sandra and everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I just want to say thanks for the list. I&#39;ve never posted before and<br/>
don&#39;t even have kids (though someday I may) and began reading a few<br/>
years ago because I&#39;m a fan of John Holt. I have learned so much about<br/>
life, learning, problem solving, and relationships of all types from<br/>
having these email digests show up in my inbox in the midst of regular<br/>
life. As a result, I am often having some type of problem or other at<br/>
the time I skim over the posts, and reading people&#39;s posts helps me<br/>
get into more of a wise and compassionate mindset. <br/>
<br/>
Happy anniversary and add one more to the pile of congratulations for<br/>
having changed so many lives. It is a beautiful thing even just to<br/>
witness. <br/>

I do think the same principles that help people make their children&#39;s  <br/>

I like your world swoop! Another way might be to list countries<br/>
alphabetically (after USA), or list in order by number or participants from<br/>
there with more popular countries listed first (this is much harder to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-318243314">Hello, I&#39;m Mim, mama to two boys (9 and 6).  I&#39;ve been reading for a <br/>
little while, and will try hard not to flag Sandra&#39;s bullshit detector.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
So... &lt;gasp&gt;... my 9 year old wants to race... Race for real.  I don&#39;t <br/>
share that interest with him (except on the wii or the DS or the bumper <br/>
karts, all of which he is brilliant at).  I trust him to race.  But <br/>
racing means a lot of expense... a kart that&#39;s used will be a minimum of <br/>
$600.00, plus a LOT of constant maintenance (which we do not know how to <br/>
do), we&#39;d need a trailer, another $500.00, because the kart would never <br/>
fit in either of our cars.  Then there&#39;s the insurance... Yikes... lol<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;d need to enter races (yes costs), travel to races (obvious costs), <br/>
and hang out with heavily competitive kids who have been racing in karts <br/>
for years, because legally, those are where he can publicly race, just <br/>
cuz he&#39;s underage.<br/>
<br/>
Then there&#39;s hanging out with the parents who are VERY different from us <br/>
(racing parents with buzz cuts and beers?), and this doesn&#39;t include <br/>
uniforms we&#39;d have to get, the safety equipment.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to follow his passion, wish I could do ALL of it, despite <br/>
my being less than completely comfortable with it to varying degrees (I <br/>
think the people we&#39;d be with would worry me more than anything else), <br/>
but the cost is prohibitive at the moment.<br/>
<br/>
He definitely has passions, he&#39;s highly intelligent, and very good at <br/>
racing for sure.  What&#39;s the next best thing?  lol!  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
He can&#39;t even get a taste of it yet.  Even at the local park he&#39;s 3 <br/>
inches too short to race in the cars there.  There&#39;s a lot of legal <br/>
mumbo jumbo having to do with insurance mostly as to why there isn&#39;t a <br/>
legal place for him to go rent a car and race it then return it (like <br/>
ice skating, or bowling, wouldn&#39;t that be cool?) for him to get just a <br/>
taste.  It&#39;s all or nothing -- you have to buy it all yourself.  I&#39;ve <br/>
researched it.  I&#39;ve even tried to &quot;borrow&quot; someone&#39;s car, but he <br/>
refused because of the legal complications.<br/>
<br/>
Eeek.  I would appreciate input. Ideas?  Suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you very much,<br/>
and Happy Seventh Anniversary,<br/>
from a relative newbie,<br/>

<br/>
U.S.A., Canada, U.K., Germany, France, Spain, Italy, South Africa, India, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, <br/>
Ecuador, Costa Rica, <br/>
<br/>
And of course it depends upon where in a particular country a person is located, to determine the order of the swooping to make it more flowing.<br/>

Definitely Costa Rica should be last before returning to Albuquerque - the center of your world ;)<br/>

try ingratiating yourself into the scene, talk to other parents, and look for a kid that might <br/>
want to &quot;mentor&quot; your child.  That child could show yours the ropes, how to drive his kart, <br/>
racing strategy, etc.  And the parents could do the same with you--you know, mentor you so <br/>
that if you do begin to acquire what you need you can make informed decisions.  <br/>
<br/>
Passionate people will often be very responsive about helping someone new into their thing.  <br/>
I do that with people who are interested in natural horsemanship.  I&#39;ve given tons of free <br/>
instruction to people if they just show the slightest interest.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-353261463">Will do!  My dh is putting together more specific information, but I&#39;ll send this for now.<br/>
<br/>
Ross reminded me that people in karting are really helpful to one another and maintain a supportive community, in spite of the element of competition. He said that he&#39;s met more homeschooling families in karting than most other sports. Karting also seeks to include the whole family (not just having parents and sibs watch on the sidelines).<br/>
<br/>
It can be a great way to get to know the country (and other countries, if your budding F1 driver wants to further his or her career in Europe!) through travel. Michelle has travelled with us through the U.S. and Canada, plus Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane, Australia, going to her dad&#39;s racing or coaching events. Next year, we&#39;re going to France for the Le Mans 24 Hour race.<br/>
<br/>
Racing is expensive, there&#39;s no doubt about it. And it can be dangerous. But there&#39;s so much to be gained from pursuing it - community, new experiences, new places, and learning about one&#39;s self. It&#39;s also tons of fun!<br/>
<br/>
These are good things to know, going in, I think!<br/>

Maybe you&#39;ll find a family about to upgrade and can get their old  <br/>

have and that could be a starting kart perhaps.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859360626">Just wanted to take a moment and say thanks to everyone for the input, <br/>
the blog experience, the suggestions.  We are *loving* this!  O is <br/>
looking forward to being behind a real wheel.  He is also starting to <br/>
really get into entrepreneurial stuff.  We recently had to have 4 pine <br/>
trees cut down in our backyard, and he&#39;s been collecting the wood and <br/>
dragging out by wagons-full to the nearby main street and selling it to <br/>
passersby, but he thought it would be easier than it actually is (that <br/>
he&#39;d have more customers).  So this really fits, too.  Thank you Robin, <br/>
Robyn, Crystal, Sandra and anybody else I may have missed.  Looking <br/>
forward to helping him make this happen.<br/>

Right.  Down to South Africa, over an up to Ecuador and then Costa  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-624551524">I came really close to buying Richard (13) a kart for Christmas this year.  <br/>
There was someone selling one locally for a really good deal, but even a <br/>
good deal was a little too much for me at this point.<br/>
<br/>
Richard has wanted to race as long as I can remember.  When he was 18 months <br/>
old he was lining up toy race cars on a braided rug track (still does that, <br/>
here is a recent picture<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/5lfsly">http://tinyurl.com/5lfsly</a><br/>
and for years he called the Star Spangled Banner &quot;The Race Car Song!&quot;  <br/>
(Which makes him a redneck according to Jeff Foxworthy, &quot;you might be a red <br/>
neck if you think the last four words of the Star Spangled Banner are <br/>
Gentlemen, Start Your Engines!&quot;  Yeah, thats my boy!)<br/>
<br/>
When my step-dad passed away in February, he left Richard his Street Stock.  <br/>
It sits in front of our house, waiting for the day when we can get it on the <br/>
track.  Here is a picture of it: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/66atpf">http://tinyurl.com/66atpf</a><br/>
We may actually start with a Hobby Stock, hopefully we can do that as soon <br/>
as this coming year.  My brother used to race locally, and still has an old <br/>
Hobby around.<br/>
<br/>
Richard knows that I am working to get him on the track.  I have always <br/>
taken his dream of being a race car driver seriously, but there are serious <br/>
financial considerations to be worked out.  We will get there though.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to read more from Robin&#39;s husband.  Richard follows almost all <br/>
types of racing, and the 24 hour Le Mans race is one of his favorites.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187707503">My dad raced go-karts when I was little, when we still lived in  <br/>
Texas.  I remember going and watching one race.  I was probably  <br/>
four.  And  my dad took me for a little ride on the dirt road in  <br/>
front of our very rural house, and my mom threw a fit, and I never  <br/>
got to ride again.  Then she got jealous because my dad&#39;s racing  <br/>
friend was the (also grown; they were in their 20&#39;s, all of them)  <br/>
daughter of his boss at work.  So my mom made him sell his go-kart.   <br/>
He also sold his Harley 74, which I remember him rebuilding and  <br/>
painting inside the house that winter.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a sad thought for me this morning, to realize that it wasn&#39;t  <br/>
just the kids&#39; spirits my mom was willing to crush.  My dad was a  <br/>
sweetie, and my mom was not.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping pictures of bad choices and meanness in the back of my mind  <br/>
is a way I remind myself  how and where I want to be, though.  It&#39;s  <br/>
no good to obsess or wallow in it, but sometimes it&#39;s good to glance  <br/>
and remember.<br/>
<br/>
A friend&#39;s mom died on Friday.  They lived in the same city but  <br/>
hadn&#39;t spoken for five years.  He&#39;s 28.  She was 51.  She was a  <br/>
substance abuser of one or two sorts, and his parents had divorced  <br/>
when he was ten or twelve.  He suffered a very irritating stepmother  <br/>
who had declared aloud (to other women who are still around) that she  <br/>
was going to have that man, before she broke up that marriage.  They  <br/>
had another child.  My friend is the only child of the first  <br/>
marriage, and his mom died suddenly of a heart attack, leaving a  <br/>
mortgaged house full of stuff and a new car with a big loan.  It  <br/>
makes me think I&#39;m glad I&#39;m working to maintain good relations with  <br/>
my kids, and it makes me want to shovel a bunch of stuff out to the  <br/>
thrift store so Holly won&#39;t be stuck with so much physical detritus  <br/>
someday.  (I probably won&#39;t, but it makes me look around with  <br/>
sympathy for my kids.)<br/>
<br/>
Keith has an armored-combat hobby that&#39;s doing damage to his joints.   <br/>
He&#39;s picking his motorcycle up from the shop today.  My dad could fix  <br/>
his own motorcycle and go-kart.  Keith&#39;s not as  much a mechanic as  <br/>
that, but Keith inherited his brother&#39;s motorcycle.  I worry a  <br/>
little, but I do not shame or pressure him.<br/>
<br/>
My kids didn&#39;t have racing urges, but Marty has a jeep with a  <br/>
skateboard in the back, and I could caution and remind and shame, but  <br/>
I see it as part of the joy of his life.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-125368088">Sandra that makes me so sad to hear.  I also have a Mom that didn&#39;t <br/>
value my choices unless they met with her and my father&#39;s approval, and <br/>
even then, they were fearful to even support those choices, fearful of <br/>
my failing at them, not being good enough.  It is valuable to look back <br/>
in order to really see the distance you have come!  I am so very <br/>
grateful every day for the kind of life we are able to joyfully live, <br/>
that my kids feel me there with them with the wind on their backs, <br/>
sailing into their futures freely, without any judgment, and for the <br/>
kinds of friends I have attracted from my own healing as a result.<br/>
