<div id="ygrps-yiv-763733382">Our latest, possible, exciting news.  My sister (who has a 3 yr old dd, <br/>
a 22mth ds, and a baby due in November) has been asking me a lot about <br/>
unschooling/homeschooling.  We&#39;ve had many debates on the phone, mostly <br/>
because she thinks ALL unschoolers think only in black and white about <br/>
the evil of schools and believe all kids should be out of school.  But <br/>
she keeps asking questions, so I&#39;m hopeful because schools are evil and <br/>
all kids should be out of school ;)<br/>
One thing that might hold her back is that her in-laws were both ps <br/>
teachers.  So every book or article she borrows she intends to pass on <br/>
to her mil to get her okay on it.  <br/>
<br/>
Honestly,  I don&#39;t think she could ever completely unschool as a <br/>
lifestyle because she&#39;s adamant on schedules and forced feeding at <br/>
mealtimes and especially bedtimes. It bothers her to no end that I no <br/>
longer make my children eat anything they don&#39;t want to and that they <br/>
often stay up till all hours of the night to be with me.  She claims <br/>
that she needs her own time to herself, so she would never stop <br/>
enforcing bedtimes.  I think that&#39;s so sad because she works all day <br/>
while they&#39;re in a very regimented daycare and only sees them for a <br/>
couple of hours.  Of course, they couldn&#39;t stay up too late, now, <br/>
because the daycare refuses to let them sleep for any reason outside of <br/>
the allotted nap times.   UGH.  <br/>
<br/>
So wish us luck.  She&#39;s planning to stop working when the baby&#39;s born. <br/>
 Of course she&#39;s also planning to go back to school for her next career <br/>
as a acupuncturist.<br/>
She&#39;s a career woman, through and through.  But she&#39;s watching my <br/>
children and she&#39;s had so many problems with issues and sickness from <br/>
the daycare.  Oh,  I&#39;m so hopeful.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing, can anyone recommend a book or article that focuses <br/>
completely on unschooling without bashing the ps school system?  That&#39;s <br/>
what she keeps asking me for and everything I have eventually or <br/>
blatantly tears into ps school.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,  Heidi</div>

Honestly, homeschooling has pretty directly to do with public school, and <br/>
that can&#39;t be done away with.  The only reason rivers exist is that there&#39;s land <br/>
on either side of them.  The only reason stars show in the sky is that it&#39;s <br/>
dark.   If she&#39;s sending you on a snipe hunt, don&#39;t go.   She can&#39;t have what <br/>
doesn&#39;t exist, and homeschooling in the absence of any consideration of school <br/>
(even if only the years of conditioning of the parents) doesn&#39;t exist.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1096362201">Wow.  All I can say is your sil is lucky she was not blessed with a high need child.  Than again, I feel lucky to have been blessed with a high need child.  I will wish you luck.  I will wish her children luck.  I will even say a little prayer for them.  I guess it is especially difficult to hear stories like this because I had parents who were not present.  As an adult when my mom told me if she had to do it over again she would not have had kids I looked at her and said &quot;Than why did you have three?&quot;  She said it was because my dad wanted them.  Holy Mary mother of God people are insane.  We are all so lucky we survived.  Of course my brother is currently a drug addicted schizophrenic who I have not seen in over four years and I have had no contact with either of my parents for four years but I do thank God she was probably one of the best worst examples I could have been blessed with.  Thank goodness you are your nieces and nephews auntie.  My auntie Echo was a gift from God.  Love those kids as much as you can.  You may be the only mother figure they ever get in their lives.  Thanks for sharing the story.  I think I am going to send my Aunt Echo a card now.<br/>

It is not about homeschooling or PS or unschooling per se, but I think it is<br/>

unschooling primary goals is bashing school.  I know it can be hard to <br/>

schooling.  I would be joyfully amazed if my sister could make the <br/>
changes, but even if she did, her husband would never go for it unless <br/>
his parents okayed it or if a friend or colleague raved about it.  For <br/>
him, me and my family&#39;s feelings and proof aren&#39;t enough.  <br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, at least she&#39;s asking questions and reading a lot. <br/>
 I&#39;ll definitely recommend the books you&#39;ve all mentioned.  Thank you.   <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649183989">That&#39;s pretty much why she and I have our &quot;debates.&quot;  She feels one of <br/>
unschooling primary goals is bashing school.<br/>
 <br/>
******<br/>
 <br/>
And one of school&#39;s primary goals is bashing the real life children could live at home day after day, if not for compulsory school.  School is designed to convince us all -- kids and parents alike -- that schedules, organized socialization, and grades are necessary, even good.  <br/>
 <br/>
When people find out we&#39;re homeschoolers, they&#39;re quick to extoll the wonderful things about school, and share their concerns about what our kids are &#39;missing.&#39;  They try to pass that off as support for schooling, but when we we extoll the virtues of keeping our kids home, we&#39;re called school-bashers.  I wonder if they see themselves as natural life-bashers.  It&#39;s all about semantics and politics. <br/>
 <br/>
I used to fantasize about my brother and sister seeing our life and choosing to homeschool their kids.  I&#39;ve realized they just aren&#39;t there yet.  My brother&#39;s a single dad and his kids were terribly neglected by their Mom when she had custody (he only regained custody a little less than 2 yrs ago) so they need school in a way my kids don&#39;t.  My sister is very swept up in the pre-honors group her 12yo son is in and can&#39;t imagine why I wouldn&#39;t send my kids to school.  She actually went to work in a daycare center when her daughter was 4 because her daughter could go along for free and it would give her playmates.  What -- are there no playgroups in Ft. Worth? No other stay at home Moms with 4yo girls?  Sure there are, but the unquestioned choice is easier.  This way she gets 7 hrs a day (full-day kindergarten) to herself.  What she does with it, I don&#39;t know -- it&#39;s not like she&#39;s involved in anything outside the house, and her house is a mess!<br/>
 <br/>
So I concentrate on being available to the kids.  When my 15yo nephew says &#39;school sucks&#39; I say, &#39;yeah, it does.  That&#39;s why my kids don&#39;t go.&#39;  Maybe I can be the cool aunt who gives them permission to do what they want (and a copy of the Teenage Liberation Handbook!).<br/>

I rarely think about or talk about school.<br/>
<br/>
Tell her we&#39;re just trying to save the GOOD parts of school!<br/>
If she an&#39;t think of any, that will be something profound to consider. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I like the availablility of books, the playing with other kids, the haing <br/>
people who will answer questions, people who are interested in the world.   Music <br/>
art.  Other people.<br/>
<br/>
You can get all that outside of school and those are the good parts.<br/>
