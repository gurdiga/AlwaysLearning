she did was go to SandraDodd.com<br/>

redeeming social and educational value,<br/>
but it&#39;s aerobic humor if you just like the feeling of being surprised and <br/>
amused.<br/>

If you can&#39;t read this e-mail don&#39;t worry, it&#39;s just humor and of no import <br/>
otherwise.<br/>

I like &quot;lives bein&#39; changed an&#39; they&#39;re still bein&#39; changed, cuss it all <br/>
