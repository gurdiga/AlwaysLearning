<div id="ygrps-yiv-855995847">From the library we checked out &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish.&quot;  (I saw it several years ago when it came out, but my 10yo was a baby.)  What a wonderful film - the grandparents care for a motherless girl.  They&#39;re very loving to her and she&#39;s on a mission that unfolds for her as the film progesses.  School is never mentioned and the girl and her older male cousin accomplish something amazing through hard work, persistence and their own calling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I enjoy this film on many different levels...the myth of the <br/>
selkies, the music, the plot line about Fiona and her grandparents, <br/>
the stories the various characters tell, the lilting accents, the <br/>
cinematography...all of it! :)  can you tell I like this movie?  <br/>
<br/>
oh and my daughter likes it too.  She calls it &quot;the seals movie.&quot; <br/>
Last year, we saw an Irish dance troupe called Inishfree and she <br/>
squealed that it was similar to the name of the movie :)</div>

We loved The Secret of Roan Inish, too.  Another similar movie that <br/>
we like a lot is Whale Rider, which has just come out on DVD:  <br/>

me so much of this movie (which I also loved!)<br/>
