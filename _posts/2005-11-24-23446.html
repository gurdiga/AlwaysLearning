<div id="ygrps-yiv-769113809">In reorganizing the games section of my site, I changed some addresses, so I <br/>
wrote to a boy named Ryan who send me a poem a while back, to let him know, <br/>
and I asked him how it&#39;s going.   He&#39;s not unschooled or homeschooled, just <br/>
found my video games page and wrote to me.   He just responded:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thanks for the notification, here is a short summery of my gaming life. I <br/>
am<br/>
still playing video games, and sadly still arguing with my parents over<br/>
every last minute I play them. I am now in high school, and getting straight<br/>
A&#39;s which still will not get me off the hook. I enjoy RPGs and strategy<br/>
games though much of my gaming time is spent playing Guild Wars a<br/>
cooperative MMORPG on the internet (Elements wrath is my name for any fellow<br/>
player.) Though changes in the stereotypic view of a gamer are definitely<br/>
occurring, there is still a ways left to go before video games along with<br/>
computer games get the respect they deserve.    -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
His poem is here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/game/poem">http://sandradodd.com/game/poem</a><br/>
<br/>
and the games site can be accessed three reasonably good ways (all are still <br/>
being worked on, and some of the pages lead to are more interesting than <br/>
others, but it&#39;s a work in progress):<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/videogames">http://sandradodd.com/videogames</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/games">http://sandradodd.com/games</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/gameplay">http://sandradodd.com/gameplay</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Before I knew the site would be so big, I used games/page for the video page. <br/>
  Very bad name; no one will guess it.   So I changed it to videogames and <br/>
realized I should have a guessable &quot;games&quot; page too.   Unfortunately, some <br/>
people had links to the other one.    <br/>
<br/>
So for those who might have a link saved or published, or who have in the <br/>
past given a friend that link, please note that it&#39;s easier to remember now---<br/>
SandraDodd.com    and    /videogames<br/>
or /games will get you there.<br/>
