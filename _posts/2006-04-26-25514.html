Sorry  for those who see this several times!  Any other podcast-listeners  out<br/>
there?  Why isn&#39;t there a good unschooling one?  People write  such<br/>
incredible, beautiful, thoughtful things every day!  Wouldn&#39;t it  be great to<br/>
have even just a weekly sampling of the best  unschooling<br/>
writings-of-the-week in audio format?<br/>
<br/>
Anyone interested  in doing this?  If there&#39;s interest, I&#39;d do it but if<br/>
someone else is  working on it I don&#39;t want to steal their thunder.  I am<br/>
aware of the  radio Freeschool program and I enjoy it.  But I would like to<br/>
see  (hear) something regularly and specifically about unschooling, and not<br/>
from  any one or a few experts but from lots of voices!<br/>
<br/>
Anybody  else?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think that sounds like such a great idea.  I would  really be into <br/>
listening to something like that.<br/>
