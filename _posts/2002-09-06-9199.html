anyone ELSE pause to think that being a victim of rape<br/>
in Mary&#39;s time and place, incestual or otherwise, was<br/>
punishable by death?  Would YOU be anxious to tell?<br/>

1. Come, Redeemer of the world:<br/>
show that the Virgin gave you birth;<br/>
Let every age stare on with awe,<br/>
For such an issue fits our God.<br/>
<br/>
2. Not from the seed that&#39;s spawned by man,<br/>
But from a mystic breathing-on<br/>
The Word of God was turned to flesh<br/>
And fruit did flower in the womb.<br/>
<br/>
3. The cleft in the Virgin&#39;s body swelled,<br/>
But the portal of shame stodd untouched;<br/>
The banners of her virtues gleamed,<br/>
For she was temple now for God.<br/>
<br/>
4. Rise now out of that wedding chamber,<br/>
From that royal hall of modesty,<br/>
You giant of a double nature<br/>
And run your course rejoicingly.<br/>
<br/>
5. Away from his Father once he parted;<br/>
Now to his Father he returns;<br/>
He made a journey into Hell-depths;<br/>
Now to the seat of God he turns.<br/>
<br/>
6. O equal to the eternal Father,<br/>
Gird your loins with trophy of flesh;<br/>
Make the infirmities of bodies <br/>
Strong with your eternal power.<br/>
<br/>
7. Your cradle now is gleaming brightly;<br/>
The night&#39;s afire with new light;<br/>
May no darkness break these measures,<br/>
But gleam forever with true might.</div>
