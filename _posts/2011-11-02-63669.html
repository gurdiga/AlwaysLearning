<div id="ygrps-yiv-573453251">I thought I would pass this on.<br/>
The Smithsonian Institute will have an Exhibit next year on The Art of Video Games.<br/>
We have participated on voting for the games awhile ago and we really really want to go.<br/>
Plus my son wants to explore Washington DC and the Fallout 3 maps that are in the DC area.<br/>
Here is the link :<br/>

OH and if someone has any good suggestions as to hotels to stay in DC that are cheap and close to the museums or with easy access to the subwaysÂ  so we can get there it would be great. Please reply off list to Polykow at kmtel . com<br/>
Hope asking that is OK I wan to plan in advance to try to go.<br/>
