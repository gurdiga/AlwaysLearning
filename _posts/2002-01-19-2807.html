<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500524147">Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Mary, the mom with the rudish 7 year old. Thank you all for posting your <br/>
thoughts. I&#39;m getting exactly what I wanted from the list. A reminder that <br/>
loving my children is very important each and every day even when they seem <br/>
unlovable. Small moments of quality time being present sure refill those <br/>
cups. Children behave negativley sometimes because you (parent) are <br/>
expecting it and even setting the stage for the negative to unfold. When <br/>
kids have real work, they forget to pester eachother. Good physical activity <br/>
is essential to our home&#39;s peace. It is ok to let the kids enjoy their games <br/>
and tools, like TV and computer. My daughter seems more beautiful to me this <br/>
week than last because I see the beauty she radiates. I&#39;m getting blinders <br/>
for her saucy words. They can roll off of me and I can tell her when she has <br/>
hurt me. She is exploring relating. I want to be here for her to practice, <br/>
all of it.<br/>
<br/>
Again Thank you<br/>
Mary<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122266278">That&#39;s wonderful Mary! One thing that has really helped me is changing<br/>
the vocabulary I learned as a child, the kind of negative terms for<br/>
normal kid actions that were so common then, into words that are more<br/>
respectful of a child&#39;s reality. Changing the words in my head made *me*<br/>
more patient and understanding. So, children don&#39;t talk back in my<br/>
house, although they might interrupt and need a little guidance on how<br/>
to do that more effectively. And I try, don&#39;t always succeed, in seeing<br/>
the &quot;rudeness&quot; in my children as an opportunity to show them how our<br/>
actions influence how others respond to us. I think that I was really<br/>
short changed as a child when an adult would slap a label on an action<br/>
of mine without really trying to respond to the need behind it.<br/>
<br/>
I find that when a &quot;button&quot; of mine really gets &quot;pushed&quot; that I need to<br/>
look at it closely and use it as an opportunity to examine old hurts and<br/>
assumptions about life and living with others that I learned as a child<br/>
that might be valid and might not be. In other words, just because it<br/>
pushes me strongly doesn&#39;t mean I am automatically *right*.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231522236">Hi Mary,<br/>
I&#39;m glad things are happier at your house.  <br/>
You know, behavior of any kind is communication.  Good behavior is a kind<br/>
of communication we all accept.  And what we call bad behavior is just<br/>
what society has labeled unacceptable communication.<br/>
Communication is a very difficult thing.  It involves translating our<br/>
thoughts into language and then presenting it to someone who can<br/>
translate our language into thought.  Encoding and decoding.   Bad<br/>
behavior is a way to translate frustration into a (non verbal) kind of<br/>
language that others can decode.  The trouble is, sometimes we don&#39;t<br/>
decode it the way the person would like us to.  When you remember that<br/>
all behavior has a goal,  then you can understand that bad behavior,<br/>
misbehavior, has a goal as well.  The person is trying to tell us<br/>
something that they have not found the verbal language to express  and<br/>
they are trying to achieve some goal by communicating with you.  You may<br/>
not LIKE the method of communication &lt;g&gt; but it IS a connection between<br/>
you.  The real challenge is understanding that and helping the person<br/>
achieve their goal.  When you can do that, understand their particular<br/>
form of (misbehavior) communication, then ( this is my theory, anyway&lt;g&gt;)<br/>
 you can help them find less disruptive ways to communicate their<br/>
frustrations and achieve their goals. <br/>
Imagine what a parent&#39;s negative reaction to a child&#39;s (misbehavior)<br/>
attempt at communication says to the child.  &quot;I don&#39;t care what you<br/>
want.&quot;  &quot;I don&#39;t care what you need&quot;  That&#39;s what a child trying to<br/>
communicate a goal or desire (misbehaving)  hears in reply to her efforts<br/>
when a parent spanks. (ALSO, a form of nonverbal communication but<br/>
interestingly enough, NOT considered by the offender to be unacceptable.<br/>
)   Most parents would never say to a child who politely asks for<br/>
something to eat &quot;I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re hungry!&quot;  But that&#39;s exactly<br/>
what&#39;s happening when parents flip out over misbehavior.  That&#39;s the<br/>
message the child gets.  That&#39;s ugly.<br/>
When you think about it, there are lots of people who can&#39;t communicate<br/>
well with JUST language.  I think kids especially might not have all the<br/>
language skills yet to express complex thoughts and desires.  Must be a<br/>
real stinker!  <br/>
So when you think about it this way, you actually end up with an<br/>
intelligent child who is trying desperately to make connections, instead<br/>
of just a brat.  Sounds much nicer doesn&#39;t it?  It might not be as nice<br/>
to LIVE with, but no one ever said having a smart kid would be easy,<br/>
right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a little nephew, blind and deaf who has taught me worlds about<br/>
communication.  (Sometimes in a very painful way&lt;G&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
His mother has this quote on her wall, by Albert Camus<br/>
&quot;In the depths of winter I finally learned there was in me an invincible<br/>
summer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there Mary!<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t implying YOU are a spanker, just using an extreme example of<br/>
reaction to misbehavior. ( Just a little disclaimer. &lt;G&gt;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1248716284">Good morning, Mary!  I&#39;m so happy to see your happy message.  I know we talked<br/>
about the Spirited Child book, but I have to say that the most useful thing I&#39;ve<br/>
ever read -- and I just read it last week -- is the Mothering article on<br/>
compassionate communication.  It really goes to the heart of learning a new way<br/>
to connect with our kids.  If you don&#39;t get Mothering and you want to borrow<br/>
mine, stop by or give a call.<br/>

peace & oxoxoxox<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes that has helped us a lot too.  Language is so<br/>
important to communication.  The words that you use<br/>
color the physical body language that you use to<br/>
convey them.  Using negative or accusatory words that<br/>
place blame and guilt causes unconscious physical<br/>
messages to be conveyed in tone, inflection, stance,<br/>
gesture, etc.  It also causes automatic reactions in<br/>
listeners.  Even if a person is being addressed with<br/>
words they have never heard before and do not know the<br/>
meaning of (as in children) they will pick up all<br/>
those physical clues and infer meaning from them.<br/>
<br/>
One term we have found usefull is &quot;disrespectful.&quot; <br/>
That applies equally in our house to adults and<br/>
children, and we try our utmost to respect each other,<br/>
and to point out to the children (to facilitate<br/>
learning for them) when we have been disrespectful to<br/>
them in apologizing for bad behavior on our part.  We<br/>
try to remind them when their behavior is<br/>
disrespectful to others, and they have been really<br/>
responsive to this type of fair minded equal treatment<br/>
and meet the challenge of behaving respectfully<br/>
towards others with the same determination and effort<br/>
that my husband and I do.<br/>

<br/>
Her response to &quot;I&#39;m hungry&quot; was &quot;No you&#39;re not,&quot; or &quot;You&#39;ve never been <br/>
hungry a day in your life.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because she had been from a poor ignorant family and lived through dust-bowl <br/>
depression stuff, then WE were never allowed to say &quot;hungry.&quot;<br/>

I haven&#39;t known anyone in modern times (anyone my age or younger &lt;g&gt;) say any <br/>

I can really relate to this one!  Both of my parents were raised by <br/>
parents who came from depression-era, poor families who were just a <br/>
few generations out of slavery.  I see my parents, grandparents, and <br/>
great-grandparents behavior as being fear based;  they were so <br/>
accustomed to not having enough to go around, they adopted a <br/>
permanent scarcity mentality that I still see and hear in parents <br/>
today.  I wish I could say I haven&#39;t heard anyone tell a child, &quot;You <br/>
aren&#39;t hungry&quot; or &quot;No, you can&#39;t have more to eat.&quot;, but my son was <br/>
recently told this by a relative at the family Christmas dinner.</div>

Thank you for this! <br/>
I have been having some issues with what is  perceived<br/>
(by myself and others) as rude behaviour of Tamzin&#39;s.<br/>
Reading this helped me to take a step back and see it<br/>
from a different viewpoint. The behaviour is this: she<br/>
often &#39;blanks&#39; people when they speak to her,<br/>
particularly adults (and sometimes children she<br/>
doesn&#39;t know). She has done this in various degrees<br/>
for years. At first I thought it was shyness, but she<br/>
also does it to people she&#39;s known for ages (including<br/>
my mom). She says she doesn&#39;t know why she does it,<br/>
and she recognises that it&#39;s rude, but she can&#39;t seem<br/>
to stop herself when she&#39;s doing it. Also it seems to<br/>
be random (for example, she doesn&#39;t always &#39;blank&#39; my<br/>
mom, just about 1/3 of the time &lt;sigh&gt;).<br/>
I would appreciate some feedback from the group on how<br/>
to deal with this. I&#39;ve run out of ideas! By the way,<br/>
she&#39;s 7 years old. TIA<br/>
<br/>

non-commuicative to the point that she can&#39;t answer? She mentally removes <br/>
herself from the situation? Both of my kids have a behavior we call <br/>
&quot;shutting down&quot;. It usually comes out during stress, but not always. It <br/>
would be interesting to see if they&#39;re doing the same thing.<br/>
