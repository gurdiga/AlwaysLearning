<br/>
(I ripped this out of context and lost the thread.)<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to comment that it seems the necessary point about <br/>
motherly frustration is that we all feel it from time to time.  (Some <br/>
more than others.)  When the feeling of motherly frustration happens, <br/>
fixing it or letting it go are both better choices than justifying it.<br/>

a martyr, or blaming children for being so inconvenient CAN be avoided!<br/>
