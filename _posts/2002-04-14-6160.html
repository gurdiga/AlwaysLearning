 </span></blockquote>Just FYI. This article by Chris Cardiff is not about &quot;open schools&quot; -- it is <br/>
about public school homeschooling programs. It is in opposition to government <br/>
funding, in particular. He doesn&#39;t care at all what kind of learning <br/>
environment the school entails - he&#39;s opposed to it if it is government <br/>
funded. Period. Nothing to do with the type of school.<br/>
