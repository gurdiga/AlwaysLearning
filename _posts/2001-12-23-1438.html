<div id="ygrps-yiv-940544241"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;I used to LOVE to read those stories, and I think you should maybe pursue <br/>
&gt;&gt;it.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d love to, but how? I&#39;ve asked Casey, but she no longer remembers any of <br/>
it. I think dreams are a good avenue to the subconscious and perhap memories <br/>
of the past. Maybe I should listen even more closely to her dreams. Lately <br/>
she&#39;s been having recurring dreams that involve a whale/shark that is <br/>
threatening her. Hmmmm...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;If she gets interested in past life regression it would be interesting to <br/>
&gt;&gt;see if more of it comes out.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah. I&#39;ll probably have to wait until she gets older, though. Although with <br/>
Casey, you never can tell. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I have a friend who&#39;s BIG into that--she&#39;s a professional psychic, and she <br/>
&gt;&gt;cares SO much I can&#39;t keep a straight face.  It usually seems bogus and <br/>
&gt;&gt;worthless to me, and bad things to remember (we have enough grief and <br/>
&gt;&gt;angst from a single life without the burden of others) but then I hear <br/>
&gt;&gt;stories like this about Casey and a shiver goes down me and I remember how <br/>
&gt;&gt;exciting those stories are.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For Jon&#39;s last birthday, I gave him a reading with a local intuitive <br/>
reader/psychic. He asked if she had any feeling as to why he keeps <br/>
changing/losing jobs every 2-3 years like clockwork. It&#39;s a definite pattern <br/>
in our lives. She told him that in a past life he was a stonemason. He built <br/>
castles in medieval times. He had a lot of independence in this line of work <br/>
(for the times) so is not used to being tied down to one workplace. When the <br/>
castle is done, you move on to a new place. Interesting. It certainly would <br/>
help to explain all the rock collections he has around our house.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Damn me and my monkey curiosity to hell.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just the other night a friend was commenting that inserting the word monkey <br/>
into any statement makes it immediately funny and outrageous at the same <br/>
time. She was from Texas originally. Maybe it&#39;s another regional thing?<br/>

My parents were monkey Texans.  Might be genetic!</div>
