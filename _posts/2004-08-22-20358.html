I could put down a &quot;splat mat&quot; in the living room but I don&#39;t have one. <br/>
I&#39;d have to buy one, and I don&#39;t get out much. Plus I&#39;m broke. Maybe my <br/>
MIL will get me one if I ask.<br/>
*************Go to your local big box hardware store and int he paint <br/>
department they have plastic disposable drop cloths. I think They are about 3 bucks. <br/>
I bet you could find three bucks in change around the house!<br/>
