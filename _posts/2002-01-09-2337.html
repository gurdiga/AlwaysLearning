<div id="ygrps-yiv-2054906301">Dan has (thank you, Dan) scanned and uploaded the sample of my writing I <br/>
sent.  It has my nowadays normal handwriting and a little sample of my <br/>
backwards writing (which comes out in my Jr. High script, but backwards).<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s at Always Learning, at yahoogroups.com, under photos.<br/>
