Turns out only the third of these links works, and it&#39;s linking to  <br/>
pages that are gone, too.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone knows current links for the 1, 2 and 4 of the list below,  <br/>
I&#39;d love to update those.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If there are other resources for unschoolers with a Christian focus,  <br/>
please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
(Although I feel kind of the same way about that as I do any other add- <br/>
ons; unschooling works the same way for Christians, &quot;law of  <br/>
attraction&quot;oids,  republicans, vegetarians, Buddhists...)<br/>

<br/>
Radical Christian Unschoolers<br/>
&quot;a place for Christians to talk about real, radical unschooling...no  <br/>
curriculum talk, no coercive parenting, no chore charts or forced  <br/>
respect of children. It is for people who already &quot;get&quot; radical  <br/>
unschooling, and are living it in their homes.&quot;<br/>
The Inspirit site has information on the book Christian Unschooling -  <br/>
Growing Your Children in the Freedom of Christ,and there is a review  <br/>
on a different site, with other useful links (links page on Christian  <br/>
Unschooling) for Christians.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a great list of links to Christian unschooling resources from  <br/>
Home Sweet Homeschool.<br/>
