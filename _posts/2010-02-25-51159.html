talk about what their kids love. And it might show someone who&#39;s  <br/>

another window into our lives.<br/>

I know some of our manga ideas came from one of Joyce&#39;s previous posts  <br/>
about it.<br/>

live where there is bad weather and you&#39;ve been stuck indoors too much,<br/>
lately? Try to get some fresh air! <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll try to use the topics you&#39;re feeling cranky about and get them into an<br/>
area that might seem more relevant to you, okay? To cheer you up? <br/>

The list sometimes gets onto these kinds of subjects - specifics about some<br/>
kind of activity. It isn&#39;t the usual discussion about unschooling, but it is<br/>
part of people&#39;s unschooling lives. Asking about manga on a conventional<br/>
parenting list might not get nearly the kind of helpful information as here<br/>
- it might get criticism. A bit of discussion about specific activities can<br/>
be interesting, too, as examples of what people are doing in their own<br/>
real-life families as unschoolers. I wonder how many conventional families<br/>
would paint a whole wall with magnetic paint and the parents would spend<br/>
time thinking of interesting things that would work on that wall. Some, for<br/>
sure. But lots would think it was a bit overboard.  I know a lot of parents,<br/>
for example, who wouldn&#39;t let their kids use sidewalk chalk on their patios<br/>
or on the sidewalk in front of their houses because it &quot;looks tacky.&quot; I LOVE<br/>
walking by someone&#39;s house and seeing children&#39;s drawings all over the<br/>
sidewalk - I always picture that the kids are being allowed to have fun<br/>
INSIDE the house, too. I never knew there was magnetic paint. I know someone<br/>
who bought a new refrigerator and it was NOT magnetic - it changed the<br/>
nature of their lives not to have a refrigerator to hang stuff on.  Every<br/>
time I was in their kitchen I noticed it and it felt a little sad because<br/>
before they had that refrigerator, their old one had always been fun and<br/>
interesting to me. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers homes are very likely going to be someone unconventional. That&#39;s<br/>
what I&#39;ve noticed. Usually unschooling means more clutter, but not always.<br/>
ALWAYS it means more children&#39;s stuff being out and visible. I really don&#39;t<br/>
think unschooling is viable in a &quot;designed&quot; home, if you know what I mean,<br/>
where there are decorator touches and things are arranged just so. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I wish we&#39;d had a magnetic wall. I really think that would have been so fun.<br/>
I might still do that when I have grandkids. I wasn&#39;t even, at first,<br/>
picturing a wall to play on (although that sounds awesome) - I was just<br/>
picturing an entire big wall with lots of magnets to hang pictures and<br/>
postcards and notes and stuff like that. Magnetic letters and numbers and<br/>
cool fridge magnets. The refrigerator has never been big enough! <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Manga? I&#39;m clueless - know nothing about it. But, it interested me a lot<br/>
that so many parents were able to step right in with so much information.<br/>
THAT shows what supporting a kids&#39; interests looks like. Unschooling parents<br/>
don&#39;t need to know anything about manga UNLESS that&#39;s something their kids<br/>
are more and more into and then they need to be willing to learn a LOT in<br/>
order to expand on that interest, to build on it, to feed it and nurture it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
These are just two particular things - magnetic walls and manga - but the<br/>
responses about those were great examples of how unschooling works in<br/>
practice. I figured that there are people on this list who appreciated<br/>
seeing the responses even if they weren&#39;t interested in magnetic walls or<br/>
manga. The magnetic wall stuff was really about strewing - thinking about<br/>
something that might be interesting to the kids. The manga stuff was about<br/>
how to accommodate a kid&#39;s interest, how to support it, especially when it<br/>
was interfering with family life in some way.<br/>

At this point in time and various points in the past, we have shared homes with family members.

I would like to have more stuff out and leave things out but that isn&#39;t working for others in the house. Can strewing be kept &quot;neat&quot;? Does an unschooling home need to look cluttered?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572390048">It also provides relief from serious stuff sometimes. Being off and on this<br/>
and other unschooling lists, it&#39;s (a) a good reminder for people like me<br/>
still getting an unschooling nest going with the needed ideas and the<br/>
wavelength or vibe of attending to this sort of thing, (b) acceptance for<br/>
doing funky things is kinda low elsewhere (like Pam says), (c) it often gets<br/>
hilarious, and that tends to lift the &quot;difficulty&quot; learning curve of<br/>
unschooling out of the doldrums for people getting started who might be<br/>
getting tunnel vision about unschooling instead of enjoying their kids.<br/>

<br/>
I remember a couple summers ago, we had 4 neighbor kids over as well as our own two kids and they had a blast drawing with chalk on the deck and on our then just primed house.  They were so thankful that they were able to draw on our house, something that I didn&#39;t think was a big deal at all.  They can still draw on the house now that it&#39;s painted and it just hoses right off.  <br/>
<br/>
That same day one of the kids asked if they could paint.  I said &quot;sure&quot; and brought out all of our painting supplies and our big roll of butcher paper.  They had fun for a good couple hours experimenting with all sorts of different painting styles.  A lot of the paint ended up on our deck, and some of it is still there two years later.  It makes me smile when I see it knowing how much fun these kids had and most of all because they would never have been allowed to do something like that at their own houses.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-559600468">As a thought -  I&#39;m not even on any type of &quot;other parenting list&quot; - I&#39;m only on a couple of unschooling lists.  What if I&#39;d never heard of Manga or Anime and wanted to offer it to my son as something I learned about on here and thought my son might like it?<br/>
<br/>
- really not much different than when the discussion is about monkey platters, potty training, or some other thread.  <br/>
<br/>
To me unschooling is interwoven into the fabric of our lives - hard to tease it apart sometimes.  I&#39;m always learning about new ideas and new things/things to do that are out there in this whole wide world by reading my lists. The lists I&#39;m on are great idea prompters.<br/>

  This isn&#39;t my list, and actually I just answered one of these questions, but I&#39;m thinking things like what to stick on a magnetic wall and where to find Manga books aren&#39;t the best use of this list. Those things are easily found by googling, or on other parenting lists.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-517585738">Something that works well in our house is bin/box rotation of toys and interesting stuff. I have space in my attic and in the garage and a host of other nooks and cranny&#39;s to put boxes or bins of toys/stuff that hasn&#39;t really been played with recently. I go around every so often and put those items in a bin. Then I put it away. I rotate them and the kids ask for a fun bin also. My mom used to do this and I remember it was so fun to go through the bin and &quot;remember an old toy&quot; or just play with old toys/items that seemed now more interesting. <br/>
<br/>
My house can often look cluttered, but to manage it more I&#39;ve found this solution is fun and makes the kids an I very happy.<br/>
