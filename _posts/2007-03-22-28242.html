<div id="ygrps-yiv-1549061599">The next edition will be out on April 1st. The (always optional)<br/>
topics for this month are:<br/>
<br/>
***There are two topics this month. Answer both, one...or neither<br/>
and blog about something else (#1) Use the letters U-N-S-C-H-O-O-L<br/>
to write about unschooling. Use what ever method you want, for<br/>
example you can use each letter like &quot;U is for..., N is for..&quot;. Or<br/>
you can have each letter start a new sentence or paragraph or try<br/>
writing an acronym. (#2) A topic that comes up on the unschooling e-<br/>
mail groups a lot is TV/computer/video games and how hard it is for<br/>
parents to let go of control in those areas. What has been your<br/>
experience?****<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to answer it on your blog, here on this list or by e-mail.<br/>
Here is the link with the details, contact information and past<br/>
editions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558941242">Joanne forgot to post the topic, but I&#39;m such a fan, I looked it up:<br/>
<br/>
May &#39;07:<br/>
How has unschooling changed YOU? Yes, itâs about the kids, but is it <br/>
ONLY about the kids? I sometimes think unschooling has changed me more <br/>
than them. What are your thoughts? Also, here another short, just-for-<br/>
fun question this month; share two photos that show what unschooling <br/>
currently looks like in your house at this time. You can also tag them <br/>
at flickr with our new (thanks Mandy) Unschooling Voices Flickr tag.<br/>
<br/>
I see the tag isn&#39;t coming through, but here&#39;s the link to the main <br/>
page again:<br/>
