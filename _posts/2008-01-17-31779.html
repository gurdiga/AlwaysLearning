<div id="ygrps-yiv-674944493">I meant to comment on a question I had on the side.<br/>
<br/>
As a speaker, I need to go along with the policies of a conference as  <br/>
much as I can.    For me personally, I don&#39;t mind there being kids in  <br/>
the room while I&#39;m speaking.  If a mom is rocking a restless toddler  <br/>
or baby, that&#39;s fine with me.  Standing or sitting in back and  <br/>
playing with them doesn&#39;t bother me, as long as it&#39;s not bothering  <br/>
those who have come to hear.<br/>
<br/>
I think the main thing is courtesy for others.  If a child is crying,  <br/>
go outside with him so it doesn&#39;t disrupt the talk.  If he just wants  <br/>
to crawl around, let him crawl around in the back.  If an older kid  <br/>
is restless, give him paper and pens, maybe, and let him draw.<br/>
