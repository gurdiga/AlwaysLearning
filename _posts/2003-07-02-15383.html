&gt; the Little Blackfoot river.<br/>
&gt; The Little Blackfoot is my husbands current favorite fly fishing river.<br/>
&gt; Mostly because it&#39;s the one we&#39;re closest to and he can get there easily<br/>
&gt; after work and fish for a few hours.<br/>

and before that, I worked in Glacier Park during two summers.<br/>

You sound like you&#39;re having so much fun.  It&#39;s great, but I&#39;m jealous!<br/>

<br/>
We do have fun, but I miss Alaska! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We were just in Missoula yesterday, delivering my mother in law to the<br/>
airport.  It was hot, lot&#39;s of traffic, kinda smelly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We went out to Florence to see my friend.   The Bitterroot is a big and<br/>
busy place these days. <br/>
<br/>
We went to Caras park and tossed a Frisbee for a Jack Russell who&#39;s<br/>
person had worn out.  I threw it as long as I could and then Dylan threw<br/>
it and then we all sprawled in the grass while the dog harassed other<br/>
park goers.  His person said she expects us back there this afternoon,<br/>
same time, ready to go.  We probably won&#39;t make the eighty four mile<br/>
drive as Dylan would miss his Tae Kwon Do class. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sorry you&#39;re missing Montana.  We&#39;ll remember you to Glacier park when we<br/>
get there.  I can send you a Missoulian or an Independent if you want. <br/>
Or, maybe a nice bottle of wine from Lolo Peak Winery?<br/>
