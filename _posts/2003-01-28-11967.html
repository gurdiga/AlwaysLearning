&lt;&lt; No way<br/>
 I could just roll into Canada that I&#39;ve discovered yet.  *sigh*  But<br/>
 anyway... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Really? I never had any problem the four different occasions I went up there. <br/>
They asked a few basic questions and except for one time we were on our way.<br/>
The difficult time was when they searched our van, they were having problems <br/>
that week with something (I think it was illegal guns coming through, don&#39;t <br/>
remember) and were being hyper sensitive.<br/>
Other than that it was ultra easy.<br/>
&#39;Course we were just passing through....are you meaning trying to live there?<br/>

We had been there just a week or so.  <br/>
<br/>
I was surprised.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to Saskatoon, though, I&#39;m taking a passport with me.  We just <br/>
didn&#39;t have them for the kids when we went to Canada then. Holly has one now <br/>
from going to England, but the boys don&#39;t.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-814780742">I&#39;ve been to Mexico twice with my children.  I brought birth certificates (obtained from the county where they were born) and photo ID (from our state driver&#39;s license bureau) and a letter from dh stating that he was aware of our travel plans (he wasn&#39;t with us at border crossings).  Nobody ever asked them for any of it.  They were kinda bummed, as they were quite proud of their photo ID.<br/>
<br/>
When you say &quot;getting out&quot; do you mean from the US officials?<br/>

Lars doesn&#39;t have picture ID.  For Pete&#39;s sake, he&#39;s only 15.  No, he was<br/>

No, bringing children out of Canada without proof they were who we said they <br/>
were.<br/>
It was the Canadian customs guys.<br/>
<br/>
Our whole family was there, and my husband and I had drivers&#39; licenses from <br/>
New Mexico.  Maybe it was just routine, but the guys acted like we weren&#39;t <br/>
too bright not to have brought better kid i.d.  Maybe it was because we had <br/>
copies of the birth certificates so if we KNEW we needed that ID, we <br/>
should&#39;ve brought the real stuff.<br/>

of Canada.  At Blaine, you drive right past Canadian Customs and past the<br/>
Peace Arch.  You don&#39;t talk to anyone on the Canadian side at all.  Taking<br/>
the ferry from Victoria to Port Angeles, you talk with US Immigration on the<br/>
Canadian side, then US customs on the American side.  I guess maybe they<br/>
must do it differently at other border crossings.<br/>

Middle East country, it can be really hard for the custodial parent to get<br/>
them back.  I think it would apply to mother *or* father.<br/>

Iran does he need a notarized letter from their American mother saying it&#39;s <br/>
okay with her?<br/>
<br/>
(Not to be too specific, but....   too many of those stories went bad.  My <br/>
sister had an Iranian boyfriend in college.  I&#39;m SO glad she didn&#39;t get <br/>
pregnant.  A college friend of mine from Taos, a sheltered Catholic Martinez <br/>
kid with educated parents but not much worldliness married an Iranian and <br/>
went and lived there for a while, then he lived in Taos for a while and then <br/>
they divorced, childless.  So the thoughts have been near to me since the <br/>
1970&#39;s.)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep it&#39;s any single parent and it can be really tricky for divorced parents<br/>
such as a friend of mine who has no contact with her husband (he lives<br/>
somewhere in NZ on a sheep ranch:)<br/>
It can be a good thing this rule but as with any business rule things get<br/>
silly. My friends were on their way home to the Middle East on a return<br/>
ticket -- their kids are both blonde, blue eyed and dad was here working.<br/>
But I can understand the need for the rule.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the western women I know who are married to Arabs laugh at the<br/>
fears that people have for the safety of their children. The book and movie<br/>
&quot;Not without my children&quot; did a lot to make the world fearful of mixed<br/>
marriages in this part of the world. The ones I know have great<br/>
relationships so they feel really comfortable. Still it can be an issue.<br/>
Since we&#39;ve been here I&#39;ve seen 2 cases just in the UAE of women caught<br/>
trying to smuggle their children out of the country. Very tricky situation<br/>
as the man owns and has all rights to the children in a Muslim marriage.<br/>
