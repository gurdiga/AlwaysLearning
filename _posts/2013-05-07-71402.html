<div id="ygrps-yiv-497568570">Hi Everyone, <br/>
<br/>
I would like to ask for some ideas regarding some new doctor information and medical problems that were bad enough to have him hospitalized this week.  Due to two medical conditions, Tommy is not supposed to have gluten, dairy or sugar, including all fruit except grapefruit.  He really is supposed to eat mostly meat and vegetables which he does not really want.  Tommy is somewhat interested in smoothies and drink supplements but not so much.  He is also supposed to be asleep early, like 8 pm.<br/>
<br/>
Up to this point, Tommy has been shopping and eating what he selects plus bits of whatever I cook.  He also goes to sleep around 10:30 to 11 pm. <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas how we can gradually move toward the new food and bed guidelines?  I am a bit stumped partly because I am emotional about his health situation.  He is so happy with his program but I have seen that he is paying a price for it.  Outside of buckets of medication, diet and sleep seem to be ways that he can affect his health if he chooses...<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How much research have you done  yourself on his conditions? Are there alternatives? What happens -- you don&#39;t need to tell us but as a question to ask yourself -- if he eats some of these? If his body shuts down, that&#39;s a very different situation than getting a rash or getting constipated. Find out how much experimentation he can do so he can find what works for him. (And it&#39;s likely his body will keep changing as he grows so what&#39;s true today may not be true next month or next year.) <br/>
<br/>
Because of lawsuits and such, many doctors will tend to be very conservative with their recommendations. There may be more wiggle room than they&#39;ve suggested.<br/>
<br/>
Right now after the hospitalization crisis you may be focused on the doctors&#39; recommendations as like a magic talisman. If you follow what they said scrupulously, it may feel like you can ward off the evil demons. But their knowledge may not be up to date or may be focused on the western tendency to treat the symptoms rather than the underlying cause.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; He really is supposed to eat mostly meat and vegetables which he does not really want<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about cooking together? Instead of looking at what he can&#39;t have, focus on what he can and explore the possibilities. Explore ethnic foods. What about rice based products and other gluten substitutes? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Every week or so I make a chicken broth/stock which is basically chicken bones simmered for several hours in a huge pan of water with herbs, spices and some vegetables such as leeks, carrots, onions, garlic.    I add plenty of fat (butter) to the pan because then when it&#39;s finished I strain it and decant it into glass jars which keep for ages in the fridge.   The fat forms an airtight layer on the top keeping it fresh, and can be discarded when using each jar.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a friendly butcher you can probably get chicken carcasses (think they&#39;re called &#39;chicken backs&#39; in the U.S) and chicken necks and heads free or very cheap, as they are usually wasted.   <br/>
<br/>
It sounds a lot of faff but is actually quite easy and doesn&#39;t take long.   The resulting stock/broth is apparently especially nutritious because it has things like gelatine from the bones.   It&#39;s used a lot in natural therapies for treating a wide range of illness.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters love to have things like plain noodles, rice, pasta etc cooked in this broth.   It doesn&#39;t look an awful lot different to rice/pasta/noodles cooked in water, but they do now prefer the taste when it&#39;s cooked with the stock.   <br/>
<br/>
I think this is a great way for them to get the nourishment of the meat and veggies from the stock, while eating the plain carb meals that they love.<br/>

&quot;Supposed to&quot; literally... a doctor supposes you will do exactly what the doctor says.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mostly meat&quot;�does that include eggs, beans, nuts?  Fish?  <br/>
<br/>

Mashed potatoes with tuna or salmon mixed in?  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe find a group of moms (not here, because it&#39;s getting off topic) to help you brainstorm food ideas, and don&#39;t think of it as forever, and don&#39;t think of it as something you &quot;have to do,&quot; because one doctor makes a recommendation.   But after the first bit of responses here, ask other places for more detailed ideas, please.<br/>
<br/>
Supposed to be in bed early *probably* was recommended with the assumption that he &quot;had to&quot; get up early and go to school.  Go by how many hours, not by what time on the clock.<br/>

<br/>
If we were farmers and serfs we would be going to bed earlier. <br/>
There were always people who stayed up to guard, whether it was a caveman cave or a castle or a small walled city.  As towns became less walled, and more spread out,  there were and still are people up being guards (policemen, sheriffs, night watchmen of all sorts) and doctors, nurses, bakers...  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;unnatural&quot; for people to be awake in the dark.  But when someone is waking people up as soon as it gets light so that they can work in fields, build pyramids, get the sails up on the ship and scrub the decks... then for them going to sleep early is the only hope for health.<br/>

<br/>
You can force yourself to live on a day/night cycle that doesn&#39;t really work for you - people do, but the big driver is what time you wake up. You wake up earlier to make yourself more tired - which isn&#39;t particularly healthy and generally people living on a schedule that doesn&#39;t work for them will be more tired overall, have a harder time getting to sleep, and compensating for that one way or another.  <br/>

That very much depends on where you live. If we woke with the sun and went<br/>
to bed with it we&#39;d be getting a maximum of four hours of sleep at<br/>
midsummer and closer to 20 at midwinter. People in this part of the world<br/>
have been staying up later than the sun for many thousands of years longer<br/>
than we&#39;ve had electricity.<br/>
<br/>
If we&#39;re going to bed by the clock we&#39;re overriding our own individual<br/>
circadian rhythm.<br/>

<br/>
It sounds like what you&#39;re asking is how to get him to choose what you want him to choose - how to get him to the right answer, in a sense. That&#39;s a good setup for conflict, not easing in to something... and that&#39;s not going to be good for health either. <br/>
<br/>
Look for ways to expand his options rather than constrain them. Really do a bunch of research into different food theories - even things like Chinese medicine and Ayurveda, since those include ideas about what and how to eat for maximum health - and look for things which could appeal to your guy.<br/>
<br/>
And rather than thinking &quot;either/or&quot; consider that diet And medication may give you the widest range of options with the least frustration. Your son might prefer medication! And if it&#39;s the less stressful option from his perspective, that&#39;s going to make a difference in terms of his health - physical, emotional and spiritual.<br/>

Older houses have serious wooden shutters from the inside, so people can sleep with the sun shining.  I already wake up earlier than I would like sometimes, but when I visit England and Scotland, it gets light WAY, way early.  People adapt.<br/>

To assume that everyone is like we are where we live (whever that is and whoever &quot;we&quot; are) is called ethnocentrism, and I suppose in this case it&#39;s more latitude-centrism. :-)  In Hawaii and India, days and nights are about the same length.<br/>
<br/>
Look, New Delhi:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=176">http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=176</a><br/>
Sunset the same time two days in a row.  It takes a week for sunset to be three minutes later.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, in Edinburgh, two minutes a day:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=304">http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/astronomy.html?n=304</a><br/>

<br/>
Those things are fun to think about.    Half an hour difference, in Singapore, between their earliest sunrise and latest, so their daytime will always be about 12 hours.<br/>
<br/>
In Antarctica, six months, six months.<br/>

People who stay in caves a while still sleep. <br/>
People living on the space station still sleep.<br/>

And this story, which a friend sent me.  I&#39;ve seen it various places, but I like this simple telling of it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One zen student said, &quot;My teacher is the best. He can go days without eating.&quot; <br/>
The second said, &quot;My teacher has so much self control, he can go days without sleep.&quot; <br/>
The third said, &quot;My teacher is so wise that he eats when he&#39;s hungry and sleeps when he&#39;s tired.&quot;<br/>

So, thank you for focusing on all that we can eat!! <br/>
Maybe we can plant a little garden...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-585846378">Does he wake on his own or do you wake him?  Does he have &quot;blackout&quot;<br/>
curtains so that he is not susceptible to having light disturb him?<br/>
If he were able to sleep 12 hours at night (10:30 pm to 10:30 am)  then<br/>
perhaps still do an afternoon rest/or nap (blackout curtains can help there<br/>
also)  he might be able to log 14 hours daily which is not excessive even<br/>
for a healthy 5 year old.<br/>
<br/>
Observe, experiment..........what are the environmental differences when he<br/>
wakes refreshed or not?   How many hours continuous sleep, combined hours,<br/>
last eaten, weather, light conditions?   Does he have a snack available so<br/>
that if he awakens after 5-6 hours he can eat and drink and perhaps go back<br/>
to sleep?<br/>
<br/>
It is frightening when a child has been urgently hospitalized but I also<br/>
agree with others that you need to take time to do your own research and<br/>
look for extra opinions and support groups.  The less common or more<br/>
controversial (like Lyme) the disease the more likely the experts are<br/>
flying by the seat of their pants!  Particularly when they give you hard<br/>
and fast rules without explaining why they apply to your child.<br/>
<br/>
Does he have an appetite at all?  Is he growing?  Somewhere near expected<br/>
height and weight for age and family history?<br/>
&quot;Look&quot; healthy?  Have energy at least on refreshed days?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If he has enjoyed picking out is foods, perhaps you can experiment with him<br/>
as to whether a particular food causes some issue even 48 hours later.<br/>
Unless the hospitalization was for truly life threatening issues, take<br/>
changes very slowly.   He can get &quot;lots&quot; of sleep going to bed at 10:30 to<br/>
11............it&#39;s up to you to provide an environment where he can do so.<br/>
Changing a diet is a very personal and intimate endeavor.   Don&#39;t try to do<br/>
it all at once....and don&#39;t make it into a long list of &quot;you cannot<br/>
have&quot;.<br/>

If your son is waking up tired because he did not get enough hours of sleep I suggest you make sure his room is dark enough and quiet in the morning so he does not wake up before he is ready.<br/>
<br/>
What matters is how much sleep and not what time he went to bed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-296496357">Haven&#39;t posted here before, but felt compelled to toss my two cents in<br/>
on this issue:<br/>
I think it&#39;s highly unlikely that &#39;buckets of medication&#39; is a<br/>
better/more efficacious route. I am saying this as someone who has spent<br/>
the past four years on a gluten/sugar/dairy free diet (due to serious<br/>
health problems), and I have also spent the past year tapering off<br/>
prescription medication. <br/>
I think that you can provide food alternatives in the home that can<br/>
replace the foods your son is better off avoiding. Example: Replacing<br/>
milk with almond milk, wheat flour with brown rice flour, butter with<br/>
coconut oil, wheat bread with gluten-free bread, sugar with stevia and<br/>
xylitol. There&#39;s even a wonderful coconut milk-based &#39;ice cream&#39; that&#39;s<br/>
sugar-free! There is a way to work around the limitations so that it<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel like deprivation to him. It might take some extra time, and<br/>
a bit of trial and error on your part. You might even consider giving<br/>
these things up yourself if you are going to have him avoid them. I<br/>
think many people could avoid serious health issues by avoiding these<br/>
three things. As far as medication, I would recommend trying almost<br/>
anything before resorting to it. Many medications do nothing but mask<br/>
symptoms, kill your liver in the process, and leave your body less able<br/>
to fend off whatever it is it&#39;s trying to fend off. That&#39;s not ALWAYS<br/>
the case, but many times I&#39;ve found that it is. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Worth avoiding for who? Until *he&#39;s* ready to avoid it, then it isn&#39;t worth it to him.<br/>
<br/>
And his body is growing and changing. If he feels it&#39;s worth avoiding now, that doesn&#39;t mean he can&#39;t ever have it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The price is the relapse that appears to happen from sugar <br/>
&gt; consumption. He never eats just one piece of candy or one <br/>
&gt; blueberry. He eats the entire carton or a bouquet of lollypops<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s because the diseases haven&#39;t stopped him from having a 5 yo&#39;s body. A diet of meat and vegetables won&#39;t be right for a 5 yo body. <br/>
<br/>
Little kids need quick energy because they have small stomachs and large energy needs.  Even if he&#39;s not particularly active, his body is growing. Kids like sugar and carbohydrates not because their palates are unsophisticated but because their bodies are different from adults.<br/>
<br/>
What about foods that are sweet but bulkier so he isn&#39;t getting as much sugar all at once? Like cookies. If gluten is a problem, there&#39;s recipes for alternative flours.<br/>
<br/>
You and he might try keeping a journal -- though you&#39;ll probably do the bulk of the recording -- of what he eats, how much he sleeps, how he feels, and so on. Do it with the intention of noticing patterns with him as scientists do, not shaming him into eating a particular way.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously what you&#39;re dealing with is something that the medical community doesn&#39;t know a lot about. They&#39;re doing a lot of guessing. They&#39;re saying &quot;Try this. We think this might be a trigger.&quot; Then after a few years when they&#39;ve seen the effects of their suggestion, after &quot;rebels&quot; have ignored them and tried other things, they may change their recommendations.<br/>

If a child isn&#39;t eating and a mother is stressed, medication might be better for a while.<br/>

If the mom doesn&#39;t even consider it, she&#39;s not making a responsible choice.  If she doesn&#39;t consider it, she can&#39;t rationally decide against it.   <br/>

Be sure you&#39;re keeping track of good moments, days, moods as well as bad! Sometimes when people keep a health journal it&#39;s tempting to focus on the bad, especially when you&#39;re trying to figure out what to avoid, but it&#39;s just as important - and sometimes more so - to notice what better times have in common.<br/>
