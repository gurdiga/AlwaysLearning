not be right for your world, but it works in mine, so I thought I&#39;d share.<br/>

Congratulations! You have a healthy toddler! Despite our best efforts to <br/>
understand them, they can apparently either devour entire houses or live like <br/>
birds on the tiniest morsels, or both, on alternating days :^) <br/>
<br/>
First of all, don&#39;t worry. If he is healthy otherwise, there is no reason to <br/>
fear. He won&#39;t starve himself. My mom is a nutritionist, and she assures me <br/>
that I didn&#39;t grow up dead, despite being a non-eating toddler. <br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t worry about getting that &quot;balanced diet&quot; all in one day -- work it out <br/>
over the week, and you&#39;ll see he&#39;s doing pretty well. Believe me, he could be <br/>
doing a lot worse than rice crispies and milk. And if he likes raisin bran, <br/>
that&#39;s all the better (more iron & fiber)!<br/>
<br/>
As for junk food, rid the house of candy and other empty calories; offer <br/>
enriched substitutes. Does he like muffins? Great! Make yours extra-good by <br/>
adding in pureed butternut squash or pumpkin or carrots or zucchini to spike <br/>
the vitamins. Powdered milk, whole wheat flour, bran, these are also great <br/>
add-ins. If you are meat-eaters, powdered milk and shredded veggies added to <br/>
meatloaf ups calcium, protein and vitamins. There are recipes floating around <br/>
out there for healthy versions of a lot of &quot;forbidden&quot; things (cakes, <br/>
cookies, etc.) that are fabulous. Write me if you are looking for something <br/>
in particular and can&#39;t find it on the web. <br/>
<br/>
(Barring allergies or other food restrictions) apple, orange or pear slices <br/>
(etc.) can be dipped in yogurt, (natural) peanut butter or pureed OTHER <br/>
fruit. A wonderful playdough can be made from peanut butter, honey and <br/>
powdered milk. It&#39;s still a sweet, but you can control the level of honey. <br/>
French fries can be made from sweet potatoes and baked in the oven! These <br/>
have more vitamins and are truly yummy.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s a matter of presentation: toddlers who won&#39;t touch carrots or <br/>
other veggies when they are whole will sometimes happily wolf them down when <br/>
you shred them and make a pile of &quot;hay.&quot; Those who won&#39;t eat sliced cheese <br/>
might be very happy with string cheese. Leaving beans whole and eating them <br/>
like french fries can be fun. Dehydrated foods can be fun -- making your own <br/>
fruit leather can be something they can help with (stirring and measuring), <br/>
and can be a great alternative to candy or commercial &quot;fruit&quot; leather <br/>
(although I hear my mom&#39;s voice in my head still, &quot;whole fruits are better <br/>
than dried or juices&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
One of the things I&#39;ve noticed about my children-as-toddlers is that they are <br/>
very charmed by mini versions of anythings, mini-pancakes (which you&#39;ve <br/>
enriched with whole wheat, powdered milk and fruit or pumpkin, etc., and <br/>
which my daughter thinks are better than cookies), mini-meatloaves (just <br/>
enough for one toddler), mini-casseroles baked in their own little dish <br/>
(muffin or custard cups work well for both of the previous), mini-pastas, etc.<br/>
<br/>
When you do try new foods out, do them with a minimum of flourish or pressure <br/>
(but you already knew that). The only rule in our house is that you must <br/>
taste it once before leaving it alone on the plate (no yelling of YUCK, <br/>
please!). I only introduce one new food at a time. If it is rejected, I <br/>
rotate that one out for a while, but try it again a month or so later. <br/>
Typically, if you don&#39;t make a big deal about it, neither will they, and <br/>
exposure to a wide variety of foods will eventually yield results in their <br/>
willingness to try new ones.<br/>
<br/>
But it will not cure the bird appetite. For that, I just made a mantra of my <br/>
mom&#39;s words (He will not starve himself he will not starve himself he will <br/>
not starve himself He&#39;ll eat when he&#39;s ready he&#39;ll eat when he&#39;s ready...) <br/>
:^) Some folks give a multi-vitamin and others don&#39;t. Either way, just relax <br/>
and try not to...worry :^) If he&#39;s truly hungry, he&#39;ll let you know, and if <br/>
he&#39;s running around and active, that hungry time WILL eventually happen :^)<br/>
<br/>
Whoops--just noticed how long this got, sorry! Hope it helps. All the <br/>
discussion so far on other topics has been very interesting and helpful to <br/>
me. I&#39;m really glad to be here :^)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br>Grated cheese goes over well here. &nbsp;I still, even though the youngest is ten, grate about a third again more cheese than I need, because it will be eaten as soon as it leave the grater.
