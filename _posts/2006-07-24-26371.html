When They Were Your Age<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At age 53:<br/>
<br/>
Ludwig van Beethoven completed his Ninth Symphony despite being so  <br/>
deaf that, at the end of its first performance, he could not hear  <br/>
whether the audience was applauding.<br/>
<br/>
Best-selling American author Sidney Sheldon began writing his first  <br/>
novel.<br/>
<br/>
Inventor Walter Hunt patented the safety pin.<br/>
<br/>
Long-time dissident Vaclav Havel became president of Czechoslovakia.<br/>
<br/>
Jimmy Carter facilitated the Camp David accords between Israel and  <br/>
Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Robert E. Peary reached the North Pole.<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
=========<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m 53 because I was born in 1953.<br/>
<br/>
That must mean everyone is the age of the year they were born.<br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah...<br/>
Math&#39;s not my best area.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473251893">Yeah, love those facts - makes me feel like I&#39;ve still got time to find that<br/>
&#39;thing&#39; that&#39;s waiting to burst forth and be the (career) pinnacle of my<br/>
life! LOL<br/>
<br/>
Keep &#39;em coming.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers<br/>
