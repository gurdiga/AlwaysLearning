<div id="ygrps-yiv-210982638">So...<br/>
Sometimes I make two or three new pages in a week.  Sometimes I just  <br/>
add something cool and don&#39;t tell anyone.<br/>
<br/>
There is an announcements list, and sometimes I remember to mention  <br/>
something here on Always Learning.  Lots of news, not much organization.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;ve changed my plan again.<br/>
<br/>
Site news will be available two ways.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
and by e-mail by joining<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning</a><br/>
(you can send an e-mail to:)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">SandraDodd-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have used two other repositories of announcements and both are now  <br/>
abandoned.  But if you&#39;re looking to discover obscure unschooling  <br/>
writings you might have missed, maybe check one of these:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/announcements">http://sandradodd.com/announcements</a>   (2004-2005)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/blog">http://sandradodd.com/blog</a>  (2006 and early 2007)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going with the blogspot replacement because it&#39;s easier to manage.<br/>
That blog used to be for something else, so the first few entries  <br/>
won&#39;t match purpose and tone, but I figured I might as well leave  <br/>
them there.  I might turn them into articles someday...<br/>

of Marty there on that page...the one with the tiny girl.  I loved it <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-420633171">That would be my 5-y.o. daughter Si√¢n next to Marty :-)  I&#39;m so glad <br/>
Mary took that picture because we only took video.  Some of my <br/>
unschooling friends are geeking out along with me that she&#39;s on Sandra&#39;s <br/>
page ;-) <br/>
