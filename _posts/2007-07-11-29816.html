<div id="ygrps-yiv-353795719">Good day group I have a few questions  about classes or camps.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always seeing various &quot;day camps&quot; available during the summer and know of many homeschoolers/unschoolers that attend.  My question is, how do you address the schoolishness ?<br/>
<br/>
I do not want to set my son up for a situation where he is ridiculed by other children or adults about his level of writing - or even his own feelings of being inadequate - self comparison - been there done that with public school until mid 3rd grade. <br/>
<br/>
Plus - Our son is very social and very, very talkative.  He will monopolize a conversation if he can, especially with the adult (he really picks their brains) and he will talk to adults like an equal.  There was an incident last winter where the group activity leader initiated all the other children in the group to take a vote:   for Zac to have to be silent the rest of the group time.  arrrrrrrrr  - that was a homeschool group activity where hubby was present.  <br/>
<br/>
I would love to offer some of the camps that are available around here - we have camps available at science city, zoo, etc. that I think our son might be interested in except that he will not write & cannot spell. (he spelled sorry &quot;sre&quot; yesterday - if you say the letter sounds s-r-e it sounds like sorry; not all his spelling is this way but some of it is)  In fact he is just beginning to write a bit this summer all spontaneously on his own and I&#39;d hate to inadvertently crush that.<br/>
<br/>
Do I offer these camps to our son and let him choose?   Do I not offer in order to &quot;protect&quot; him - staying open to the possibility of these activities later on ? <br/>
<br/>
 We have been homeschooling / unschooling for 4.5 years - went straight from public school to unschooling.  He just turned 13.  - we don&#39;t want to have to begin deschooling all over ; )  But I don&#39;t want to over protect either. I don&#39;t tend to speak up for what our needs are (I dislike confrontations), I tend to withdraw to where we are happiest, path of least resistance. <br/>
<br/>
 We have attend many &quot;classes&quot; where one or both of us were available to go along and sit beside our son and write for him & work along side of him but those are usually classes designed for parents to be involved so there were always a few other parents in attendance also (it did not stick out that he was the only one with a parent beside him)  We have also attended many activities where we sat in the back, available for assistance.<br/>
<br/>
If he did chose to attend how could we help him and should we have a discussion with the people running the activity ?<br/>
<br/>
Do those of you that have children that attend these types of classes and camps ask the leaders before hand about how much schoolishness there will be. (not in those words of course - but details about requirements for reading, writing, sitting still & mute, etc.)   - then present all that information to your child - and then of course they choose what they want to do?<br/>
<br/>
What would be essential to go over with the instructors and your child?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-453315855">Hi Lisa,<br/>
 <br/>
I am going through this right now. My son went to a developmental school  up <br/>
through 3rd grade, I pulled him out last year (after the teacher  yelled at <br/>
him one to many times). So we&#39;ve spent the last year  deschooling. <br/>
 <br/>
He asked me if he could take some classes this summer, and reluctantly, I  <br/>
enrolled him (after talking to the person in charge who assured me that these  <br/>
classes were just for fun...no pressure classes). So he was signed up to  take <br/>
computers and arts and crafts. He came home after 2 days  crying that the <br/>
computer class was going to fast for him and he felt that he  couldn&#39;t keep up. I <br/>
spoke to the teacher and explained my son&#39;s  situation and he basically said <br/>
that if my son would pay attention he&#39;d  be able to keep up!  UGH! A simple <br/>
reminder to both of  us why were aren&#39;t in school anymore!<br/>
 <br/>
So now he&#39;s taking a science class. I spoke to the teacher beforehand and  <br/>
she assured me that there was no writing in class and that they were going  to <br/>
spend mornings making paper airplanes and slime. So far so  good. (Although the <br/>
arts and crafts teacher wasn&#39;t too happy when my son  quoted Austin Powers <br/>
when they were discussing volcanoes...).<br/>
 <br/>
He also just spent a week away at camp in the mountains. I noticed in his  <br/>
things there were some writing assignments...just simple fill in stuff and he  <br/>
told me he had no problems with it, and his spelling and writing are still very <br/>
 inventive. He was so happy to be at camp, that I&#39;m sure he doesn&#39;t even <br/>
remember  having to write at all. It was no big deal.<br/>
 <br/>
My son is also very social and he&#39;s very athletic too, so there are a  lot of <br/>
situations where we&#39;re with schooled kids and it can be difficult.  Usually <br/>
my husband or I are with him, so we can discuss things with him  afterwards.<br/>
 <br/>
So I guess what I&#39;m trying to say is that I would talk to the person in  <br/>
charge and ask about the &quot;academic&quot; part of the camp (if there is one). If  <br/>
there&#39;s a lot of schoolish like stuff, I&#39;d opt out (unless your son really wants  <br/>
it). I&#39;m always one for communicating with whomever is in charge of my child, in <br/>
 front of my child, that way everyone is on the same page.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know what others think about camp and summer classes...but this is  <br/>
just our experience this year!<br/>
 <br/>

****************<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d offer but talk seriously with him about the expectations and <br/>
options.<br/>
<br/>
In terms of any &quot;work&quot;, I think its important to remind him (and <br/>
yourself, too) that this is all totally voluntary on his part. He <br/>
doesn&#39;t *have* to do any given assignment. I&#39;d want to know <br/>
beforehand if there are going to be long periods of time when kids <br/>
are expected to sit in a desk and read or write simply bc those are <br/>
times when your guy may be bored and restless - but that seems <br/>
unlikely for a summmer day-camp.<br/>
<br/>

***********<br/>
<br/>
This seems like the bigger issue. You want to be able to put him in <br/>
situations where he can learn in his own best way - and for him that <br/>
involves a lot of talking, which doesn&#39;t lend itself well to groups <br/>
where several people are sharing one teacher or expert. I&#39;d be on <br/>
the look out for other option than classes for this reason - maybe <br/>
talk to some of the people who are putting on the summer classes and <br/>
see if they are available at other times one-on-one. <br/>
<br/>
Kind of depends on what your son&#39;s interests are, but just as an <br/>
example, a fellow I know teaches at a local science center that <br/>
offers a variety of classes year-round. Mo&#39;s not interested in <br/>
classes, but this guy also lives on a really sweet section of a <br/>
local creek that&#39;s Great for catching fish and crawdads and just <br/>
slithering with all kinds of snakes. So we go and swim at his place <br/>
and he comes out and identifies critters to Mo&#39;s heart&#39;s content. He <br/>
sometimes jokes about how much he would theoretically get paid to do <br/>
this, but really, he&#39;s passionate about creepy-crawlies and is <br/>
thrilled to have another person share that passion with him. That&#39;s <br/>
something he doesn&#39;t always get in a class - those moments <br/>
of &quot;oooooohhhhhh look at this! isn&#39;t it coooool?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not necessarily &quot;very social.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I talk a lot.  I process ideas by talking (or by writing, or having  <br/>
long discussions with friends late at night or on car rides).  My  <br/>
kids are like that.  The oldest one, especially, is that way.<br/>
<br/>
I have told Kirby a few times, when he was younger and more hyper  <br/>
especially, to be careful not to hog the air.<br/>
When he goes to a party it&#39;s easy for him to be &quot;the life of the  <br/>
party,&quot; and sometimes that&#39;s inappropriate.  Birthdays (other than  <br/>
his own).  Funerals.  So I&#39;ve coached him about when it&#39;s good to cut  <br/>
loose and talk, and when it&#39;s good to studiously wait his turn, or  <br/>
let others have more attention.<br/>
<br/>
Different situations have different expectations, and it&#39;s part of  <br/>
parenting to help kids understand that, and to help them figure out  <br/>
how to gauge it themselves, and how to practice fitting in when  <br/>
that&#39;s called for.<br/>
<br/>
When I run a workshop or give a talk, it wouldn&#39;t be okay for one of  <br/>
the participants to monopolize, to &quot;pick my brain,&quot; to talk to me  <br/>
like an equal, to be social or very, very talkative.  The others in  <br/>
the group might vote for that person to have to be silent for the  <br/>
rest of the workshop or the presentation.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to a workshop or a talk or a camp or a presentation, I  <br/>
don&#39;t talk to the presenter like an equal.  I let him have the time  <br/>
and space he&#39;s been alloted to make his presentation. I don&#39;t  <br/>
monopolize his time, even if I&#39;m the organizer.   I&#39;ve just finished  <br/>
doing that 19 times.  (I started to say 22, but I was the presenter  <br/>
three of the times).   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/thursday">http://sandradodd.com/thursday</a><br/>
<br/>
I still haven&#39;t made the last three summary sites.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of looking for a place where a child can be unreasonably  <br/>
talkative, help him learn when and how to wait.<br/>

<br/>
I totally agree with you on the points you made.  This is an area we are struggling with.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have some examples of words to use in those times of coaching - as he gets extremely frustrated with us when we try to coach him during these times.  We must be using the wrong words maybe ?<br/>
<br/>
When I say he is social - I mean he loves other people and being with them.<br/>
I wasn&#39;t trying to find a situation where he could monopolize - that would probably not be possible anyway.   I was trying to explain some of how he can be - and you understood me well on that.  <br/>
<br/>
We do work at helping him learn how to know &quot;when & how to wait&quot;  but maybe we need some ideas of how to do this better.  I don&#39;t need to be told exactly what to do of course - We just need ideas that will stimulate our own ideas and thoughts that will work with our particular child.<br/>
<br/>
Would we &quot;make&quot; him sit with us so we can help guide him?   I&#39;m obviously lost as how to do this without alienating him.<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s more an expression of your concern that he grow up happy  <br/>
with friends, and that he will be respected and invited back again,  <br/>
than an exact choice of words.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could use a parallel situation, an analogy.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be okay to go into a restaurant during a meal, or to  <br/>
someone&#39;s house during a meal, and sweep all the dishes and food onto  <br/>
the floor with both arms.<br/>
<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t be okay to go to someone else&#39;s party, bring in new food,  <br/>
put their food away, and change the music.<br/>
<br/>
When a class or party or discussion is disrupted or monopolized, it&#39;s  <br/>
basically doing the same thing.<br/>
Maybe use my other analogies of speakers, since you&#39;re talking about  <br/>
daycamp and fun-class situations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1458911020">Thanks for the &quot;ideas&quot; we will continue to work on this.<br/>
<br/>
However, for example, when we try to coach him he will often say:<br/>
<br/>
Then I never get a turn;  ( I let him know that yes, there may be times he does not get a turn )<br/>
I only want to be my authentic self;  <br/>
If they do not like me the way I truly am then .....; <br/>
<br/>
We have had many talks about being your true authentic self in various ways for various situations.  We talk about social rules - whether we agree with them or not is not the point.  If you step too far out of those boundaries then you will more than likely end up without friends.  <br/>
<br/>
I sometimes wonder if he does not read other&#39;s body language cues - so we&#39;ve been working on pointing out other&#39;s cues to him.  And you do not necessarily tell everyone everything.<br/>

*******************<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t found explanations to be necessarily all that helpful with <br/>
Ray, unless I could make them really short and simple. What has been <br/>
more helpful over the years is finding more situations where he can <br/>
interact one on one - including having one particular person <br/>
(usually adult, but not always) who is willing to befriend and <br/>
connect with him in group situations. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot; Different situations have different expectations, and it&#39;s part <br/>

that&#39;s called for.&quot;<br/>
***************<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t necessarily agree that kids need to &quot;practice fitting in&quot;. <br/>
Some kids seem to need to find ways to connect on a personal level <br/>
within group dynamics - that&#39;s what I see with Ray, and with my gf&#39;s <br/>
kid. When they can connect, the whole group runs more smoothly - but <br/>
that&#39;s not bc either kid is &quot;fitting in&quot; they&#39;ve just found a way to <br/>
meet their needs that also meets the needs of the group as a whole. <br/>
Figuring out how to do that takes facilitation more than <br/>
explanation - someone has to be willing to make that connection with <br/>
the kid.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Would we &quot;make&quot; him sit with us so we can help guide him?   I&#39;m <br/>
&gt;obviously lost as how to do this without alienating him.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is why its important to step away from the goal <br/>
of &quot;helping him fit in&quot; or &quot;helping him meet expectations&quot; - those <br/>
kinds of assumptions are sending you right to the question of how to <br/>
go about modifying his behavior, rather than trying to understand <br/>
where he&#39;s coming from and what his needs are and working to find <br/>
solutions that meet his needs *and* are respectful of others.<br/>

Your posts make it seem as though you are trying to teach him social <br/>
skills. That&#39;s something to watch out for. If he wasn&#39;t reading, <br/>
would you be trying to stuff phonics and context-clues into him so <br/>
that he would &quot;be aware of the nuances&quot;? or would you be trying to <br/>
meet him where he is, reading things for him when he asked, and <br/>
trusting that he would eventually be reading on his own? Right now, <br/>
its sounding as though you don&#39;t trust that *eventually* he&#39;ll have <br/>
the skills he needs, so you&#39;re trying to stuff some skills into him. <br/>
It doesn&#39;t work with social skills any more than it does academics. <br/>
<br/>
Like academics, it can actually undermine his eventual skillfullness <br/>
to have all this &quot;teaching&quot; going on. It undermines his self <br/>
confidence to tell him over and over &quot;no, that&#39;s wrong&quot; and can lead <br/>
to him being resistant and defensive - didn&#39;t you say in another <br/>
post that he&#39;s arguing with your suggestions? <br/>
<br/>
How can you facilitate more successful social interactions? That&#39;s a <br/>
better question than &quot;how can I make him aware...&quot; or &quot;how do I get <br/>
him to understand&quot;. More successful interactions will give him the <br/>
background to understand what makes an interaction successful. <br/>

I disagree, except for the &quot;teach&quot; exception.<br/>

When one of my kids couldn&#39;t read, I wouldn&#39;t have set him or her up  <br/>

I thought it was about THIS SUMMER, social situations that involved  <br/>
being in a group with several kids and an adult leader.<br/>
<br/>
IF he&#39;s going to be in such situations, he could use coaching (not  <br/>
&quot;teaching,&quot; but discussion and example and rationalization).<br/>

If he really wants to go to a restaurant, or I need for him to go to  <br/>
one for some formal-dinner reason, then it would be kind and good of  <br/>
me to try to help him be aware of why finger-pulls-long-booger-out-of- <br/>
nose is not a reasonable option at all.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not like learning to read.<br/>
Learning to read needs lots of little parts that come together into a  <br/>
large, complex set of mental responses.<br/>
<br/>
To be more still and more quiet in a social situation isn&#39;t NEARLY  <br/>
like reading.<br/>
To discuss with a child the needs of the speaker, and the needs of  <br/>
those trying to listen, isn&#39;t parallel to learning to read.<br/>

I think coaching an overly-talkative person to be quiet during a  <br/>
class or workshop is like showing a kid how and why to hold a book  <br/>
gently.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can know which end of a book is up and how to treat it gently  <br/>
without knowing how to read.<br/>
<br/>
Going into a formalish situation and being quieter isn&#39;t &quot;social  <br/>
skillfulness.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Social skillfulness is different from reading like logical thinking <br/>
is different from reading or playing music is different from <br/>
reading. Different intelligences involved. When someone doesn&#39;t <br/>
understand one kind of intelligence very well its sometimes helpful <br/>
to think about one of the other kinds of intelligence.<br/>
<br/>
Figuring out how to behave appropriately in social situations needs <br/>
lots of little parts to come together - they&#39;re different kinds of <br/>
parts and different kinds of responses than reading, but the <br/>
complexity is similar. Learning to be more still (or more quiet) <br/>
isn&#39;t one skill, its a bunch of overlapping skills. A large, complex <br/>
set of mental and physical responses. <br/>

<br/>
Okay, I cut that down alot so as not to repost the whole thing - <br/>
just specific lines that say &quot;often&quot; or &quot;many&quot; or talk in <br/>
generalities. That&#39;s where I&#39;m getting the idea that there&#39;s a lot <br/>
of &quot;coaching&quot; going on in a lot of different environments. Coaching <br/>
has its use, but if a parent is frequently trying to tell a child <br/>
how to behave or what the expectations are, that&#39;s going beyond <br/>
situational coaching. That&#39;s problematical. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have had many talks about being your true authentic self in <br/>
&gt;various ways for various situations. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why &quot;many talks&quot;? If parents are repeating the same information over <br/>
and over than either the child isn&#39;t ready for it, or its not the <br/>
kind of information the child can use.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If you step too far out of those boundaries then you will more than <br/>
&gt;likely end up without friends.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Scare tactics like that can bite you back later. If a kid is wild <br/>
and still has friends (maybe even friends who say things like &quot;I <br/>
forgive you&quot;), is mom lying? or has he just not gone far enough out <br/>
of the boundaries? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then I never get a turn;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d look into why he feels he &quot;never&quot; gets a turn. Maybe you&#39;re <br/>
putting him in situations where he has to wait longer than he&#39;s <br/>
really capable of waiting. That&#39;s not the sort of thing where <br/>
something needs to be explained to him - he needs to be in different <br/>
situations that meet his needs better. That&#39;s part of what I meant <br/>
in another post when I talked about facilitating successful <br/>
interactions. One way to do that is to look for ways to put kids in <br/>
situations that they can really handle - not ideally handle or <br/>
even &quot;reasonably&quot; handle by some external standard. If your guy <br/>
feels like he &quot;never&quot; gets a turn, look for ways for him to get a <br/>
turn more often.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I sometimes wonder if he does not read other&#39;s body language cues -<br/>
&gt; so we&#39;ve been working on pointing out other&#39;s cues to him. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Does that seem to help him understand? I&#39;ve seen people use this <br/>
strategy, but I&#39;ve never been able to tell if the child in question <br/>
actually understood more as a result or just got the hint to chill <br/>
out. It didn&#39;t seem to do more than frustrate Ray the few times I <br/>
tried it when he was younger. It may be that it is exactly the right <br/>
help for certain kids, though. <br/>
<br/>
If he doesn&#39;t seem to be understanding more about body language <br/>
despite having it pointed out to him, I&#39;d drop the matter and look <br/>
at reasons *why* he might not be seeming to understand body <br/>
language. It may be that he&#39;s understanding, but not responding in <br/>
ways you expect. It may be he&#39;s not understanding because his own <br/>
needs aren&#39;t being met and that&#39;s all he can think about. <br/>
<br/>
One of the mistakes I (and his dad and mom) have made is to assume <br/>
that since Ray loves to talk that *telling* him things is helpful to <br/>
him. What we&#39;ve found is that *conversing* with Ray is a useful way <br/>
to communicate with him. The give and take of conversation is more <br/>
valuble, more accessible to him than &quot;being told&quot;. <br/>

that if they have difficulties that it is alright and not make them <br/>
deficient or less of a person for it. All the labels in the world do <br/>
not and will not change who your child is. You know who your child <br/>
is and if you accept who he is and what his limits are then you will <br/>
both be okay. Sometimes we try too hard to find out what is wrong <br/>
with our kids instead of accepting them for who they are. <br/>

If your child does not do well in social situations then let him <br/>
either handle them in his own way or not be in them. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>There are options beyond this either-or, though. There were times <br/>
when Ray was younger when he wasn&#39;t really able to understand a <br/>
particular social environment, but did okay as long as someone was <br/>
there to help him out - distract him, take him outside, remind him <br/>
of particulars, whatever was appropriate for the moment. There are <br/>
times now when Mo isn&#39;t really able to understand what&#39;s going on in <br/>
a particular situation, but is willing to ask me for help or to run <br/>
some interferrence for her. <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a kid can only &quot;handle it his own way&quot; if all the adults <br/>
are on the same page wrt expectations - that&#39;s something I&#39;ve run <br/>
across with Ray many times bc he&#39;s consistently been big for his <br/>
age. We&#39;ve often had to deal with other people (kids and adults) who <br/>
expected him to be more mature until/unless we could explain that, <br/>
no, he&#39;s two or three years younger than he looks. We still have <br/>
trouble in that regard, sometimes. He&#39;s 13, but nearly six feet <br/>
tall. People are shocked when he does something really boyish. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sometimes we try too hard to find out what is wrong <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes, a friend of mine tells a story of wondering what was wrong with <br/>
her four year old son until she picked up a &quot;what to expect from <br/>
your 4yo&quot; book. That day she was able to call her dh and tell him &quot;I <br/>
found out what&#39;s wrong with ds! He&#39;s 4!&quot; Admittedly sometimes those <br/>
books can lead to anxiety, if a kid isn&#39;t falling in the right <br/>
developmental slots, but I&#39;m often pretty amazed at the expectations <br/>
people have of younger children, especially. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-596860889">You can&#39;t &quot;do&quot; anything about his spelling, but you could coach him a  <br/>
little on how to handle the fact that his spelling isn&#39;t very accurate.<br/>
<br/>
There is a little book called &quot;My Kid Can&#39;t Spell: Understanding and  <br/>
Assisting Your Child&#39;s Literacy Development.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got some good ideas for helping one of my daughters cope with not  <br/>
being much of a speller for many years. In her case, she could often  <br/>
recognize a correct spelling - if there was a list of words like:   <br/>
sed, sd, esd, sad, sid, said, sath, siad, and so on, she could very  <br/>
often pick out the correct one, even though she could seldom come up  <br/>
with it herself.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helped her feel better about her lack of spelling ability  <br/>
to have some things she could do, some strategies for dealing with it  <br/>
- I mean, in addition to asking someone else, &quot;How do you spell.....&quot;  <br/>
which is a perfectly good option, too.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t read the book, by the way and I kept it out of her sight  <br/>
because I didn&#39;t want her to think &quot;I&quot; was worried. I just wanted to  <br/>
help her out to the degree she wanted help. The focus is on how to  <br/>
handle not being able to spell, by the way, not on how to teach a kid  <br/>
to spell.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1999900767">Our son just turned 13.  To help him in times when we are not available and to give him independence while on line we purchased an item called Spelling Ace.  It works most of the time for him.  I say most of the time because there are times he spells the word so &quot;wrongly&quot; that the ace does not understand what he is looking for.  Or when he spells &quot;high&quot; as &quot;hi&quot;.  He keeps this and a calculator beside the computer.<br/>
<br/>
When we first got it last month he walked around playing with it for about a week - he took it everywhere he went.  You can also play some games on it.  Has a thesaurus and a few other features he does not use at this time.<br/>

This item has been very useful for him as he stays up late - way later than mom and dad ;)  There are also times when he is home alone - like today we are going to go wallpaper my sister&#39;s bathroom and he does not want to go.<br/>

  Lisa:  These are our (mom & dad) thoughts too but I just wanted to hear your opinion too - just in case we needed to look at it from a different angle.  Last winter we had a homeschool mom suggest we get him tested for Asperger&#39;s and we said we didn&#39;t see the point in it.  She was part of the group voting for him to be silent.  But that we were working with him on group skills, etc.  Our son chose to leave the group due to the pressure & negativeness he was receiving.  He&#39;d been happy with this group for several years but for some reason things changed last winter.<br/>

  Lisa:  obviously they are still there in some form or I would not have mentioned them?  Food for thought - thanks!  I&#39;ve been mulling this one over since yesterday off and on and I could write a book in response as there is a lot running through my head.  Not conflicting but peaceful thoughts.  I do think we need to be aware of his strengths and &quot;weaknesses&quot; to help facilitate successful interactions and activities away from home as well as at home.  For example if he wants to take a class we need to be aware that he may need some coaching.  Last Christmas all the siblings got together at my mom&#39;s for the first time in 27 years.  She asked that we all attend church with her and how it would mean so much to her, etc.    so we had to do some discussions and coaching with our son before hand about expectations in chruch services and how this meant so much to his nanna, etc.  Just a nice conversation with him not a lecture.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1849926032">-=-Last Christmas all the siblings got together at my mom&#39;s for the  <br/>
first time in 27 years. She asked that we all attend church with her  <br/>
and how it would mean so much to her, etc. so we had to do some  <br/>
discussions and coaching with our son before hand about expectations  <br/>
in chruch services and how this meant so much to his nanna, etc. Just  <br/>
a nice conversation with him not a lecture.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
We were discussing a situation involving a 22 year old friend.  It&#39;s  <br/>
not an Asperger&#39;s situation--he&#39;s extremely high on the  <br/>
interpersonals business, can read people like magic, but he&#39;s not the  <br/>
quietest or most tactful or patient of people.  Holly and I were  <br/>
discussing taking him with us to a formal in-costume discussion in  <br/>
another state.  (SCA context, so SCA costume.)<br/>
<br/>
Holly suggested that if we put him in a costume, and he sees all the  <br/>
other costumes, he wouldn&#39;t be able to sit still and be calm and  <br/>
quiet for two or three hours.<br/>
<br/>
I said then we make sure he has paper and pencils.  Holly agreed, and  <br/>
said he needs to be sitting at a table.<br/>
<br/>
This friend of ours draws.  He does pencil drawings while he&#39;s  <br/>
talking, while he&#39;s eating, while he&#39;s on the phone.  He&#39;s working  <br/>
for a dancing-tree logo for my website.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t draw, but I do fully and physically understand the value of  <br/>
doodling to keep my hyperactive tendencies under my own control.  In  <br/>
church, I was able to sit still for an hour because there were songs  <br/>
to sing sometimes, but during sermons (which I DID listen to and  <br/>
understand, and often looked up the passage to find how HORRIBLY out  <br/>
of context the preacher was taking it, or to find something he so  <br/>
TOTALLY could have tied in but he had missed it)...  During sermons I  <br/>
would write on the program.  I would mark parts of words out to make  <br/>
it say other things, or count the times &quot;the&quot; was used or color in  <br/>
the &quot;o&quot;s or circle some words and number them and then put a code to  <br/>
go from word to word and pass it to my friend Martha who, if she  <br/>
wasn&#39;t playing the piano or organ that day, would trade programs and  <br/>
I&#39;d see what she&#39;d done to hers.<br/>
<br/>
We could do it very unobtrusively and we didn&#39;t disrupt the service.   <br/>
We were two of the best kids at church--helpful, dedicated, but  <br/>
without the ability to chill to a standstill.<br/>
<br/>
So if our friend goes with us to Denver we will provide him a good  <br/>
place to sit where he can draw, and we&#39;ll debrief him all he wants  <br/>
later and on the drive home, and explain the things that were too  <br/>
foreign for him to get.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s right, though, that if we just dressed him up and put him in  <br/>
a candlelit environment with a bunch of strangers it wouldn&#39;t calm  <br/>
him, it would excite him and he&#39;d likely say things and act ways we&#39;d  <br/>
wish to undo.   He&#39;ll be happier if we help him hear the stuff  <br/>
without disrupting it.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t even have invited him, because he&#39;s not in the SCA, but he  <br/>
said on Saturday that he&#39;s sorry he missed last winter&#39;s philosophy  <br/>
discussions and he would love to be in a discussion about honor and  <br/>
virtue.   This thing next weekend is the only one scheduled.  Next  <br/>
winter I&#39;m doing something more like show and tell on those Wednesday  <br/>
nights, more about arts and that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1592263150">-=-so even if I did not respond to each post we did read them and  <br/>
make use of them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is it OK to say this on this list ? or was it just superfluous ?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s superfluous, but still reassuring, and it&#39;s okay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better not to respond to each post.  The best posts are  <br/>
syntheses and updates and refined questions.    Let us know, after a  <br/>
while, if any of the suggestions helped, or if you came up with other  <br/>
ideas the rest of us can use!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1739614104">-=-When we first got it last month he walked around playing with it  <br/>
for about a week - he took it everywhere he went. You can also play  <br/>
some games on it. Has a thesaurus and a few other features he does  <br/>
not use at this time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly has one of those we got her when she was learning to read and  <br/>
spell.  Something blue, for kids, from Radio Shack.  She played  <br/>
hangman LOTS with it, and it would show the word in cursive, too,  <br/>
writing it out slowly, which helped her lots of ways.  She had time  <br/>
to think about the spelling while it spelled it out (or she could  <br/>
skip that).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1136982955">Update.<br/>
<br/>
Dear son asked for horseback riding lessons again - he took them about 3 years ago for one summer.  He loved it and the instructor,  but the instructor lost her place.  He has asked since then about lessons.  About once a year he&#39;ll bring it up and we&#39;ll try to find a place, but we could never find a place close enough to do this long term.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,  he asked last week about it.  I found out through contacts that the lady he connected with so well is doing lessons again fairly close to us.  We talked to her today.  He will have his first lesson next Tuesday.  She wants to do a few private lessons to get a feel for what he remembers, she remembers that he took to the saddle really well, and then move him into a group.  I think this will work out great as a group experience for him.  He will have to follow the group rules due to safety, respect for the other riders and the horse, waiting his turn, etc.  But he will also be very active.<br/>
<br/>
I know this is not the same as sitting through something and having to be silent and waiting his turn but hopefully this will meet his needs - where he is now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s expensive too!  ; )<br/>
<br/>
He is very excited - talking about owning his own horse some day, etc.<br/>
