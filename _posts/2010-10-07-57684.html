<div id="ygrps-yiv-1368170653">He who pays the piper calls the tune.<br/>
<br/>
My dad&#39;s favourite phrase of all time and used any time we wanted anything that he would not agree to material or not. He was of course the piper and because we, my mum and siblings, did not bring any money into the house, we had no say in many things. I have not spoken to my dad since DD was about 4 months old but even at that point he was using another phrase that we were building a rid for our own backs by holding her so much and not leaving her to cry.<br/>

I have always heard it used as a justification for punishing a child. For example, if a child goes down the street and plays without permission, the child will pay by losing privileges or being punished according to the parents&#39; whims. It&#39;s very closely related to the phrase, &quot;It&#39;s time to pay the piper.&quot; I have heard people say you play you pay most of my life. I wonder if it is wrapped up in southern culture and has ties to the biblical notion of paying for ones sins. I don&#39;t have time to research it but that is the impression that I have always gotten whenever I hear it used. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1689379152">&quot;The world doesn&#39;t revolve around you&quot; was very popular with both of my parents.  It was made pretty clear to me as a young kid that I was &quot;selfish&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
A couple of others were &quot;You made your bed, now you have to lie in it.&quot; and &quot;You can&#39;t have cake and eat it too.&quot;  I had no idea what either of these meant as a kid but now I do and think they&#39;re damaging.  I&#39;ve seen the &quot;making your bed&quot; philosophy play out with my mom&#39;s interactions with Logan recently.  While she didn&#39;t use the phrase with him, the idea that a 4 year old should suffer because of something he did (drop a toy) is repulsive to me.<br/>

doing -- by playing -- what you&#39;ll have to do later will be worse as  <br/>
payment for your fun.<br/>

That&#39;s what I got out of it. Not sure if that was it, and I can&#39;t ask now. I<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband, the punk rock/metal head drummer, has a great song called &quot;Pay to Play&quot; which refers to injury sustained while playing hard...usually during more extreme sports like mountain biking, rock climbing, ice climbing, skateboarding, etc. The band members who wrote the song have all accumulated some pretty substantial injuries while playing.<br/>
<br/>
As a kid, when I heard that, it was usually in reference to, if you play now, you&#39;ll pay later by having work to do when you&#39;d rather not...like homework on a Sunday evening, for instance.</div>

-----I&#39;ve heard it in other contexts, but not to do with parents/children. To do<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m familiar with it as a saying in reference to sex too--as in a warning to men, that if he has sex with a woman, she&#39;ll make all sorts of demands on him. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever heard it used the other way around: a woman will &quot;pay&quot; for &quot;playing&quot; with a man, although that makes more sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, I&#39;m familiar with this saying in Hebrew though!<br/>

Always bugged me because so few things were given graciously and generously in my family, there were always strings attached - so I was essentially a beggar if I asked for anything at all. I learned to not ask.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, on the freecycle list I&#39;m on (an email list where folks can donate unwanted items to keep them out of landfills, or ask for items needed) someone posted a rant about someone who had made a request for a rug, then turned her down when she offered a blue one; the requester wanted a brown rug. She was VERY angry to have been turned down, and she used that phrase. The moderators wrote to say someone asking isn&#39;t begging, and they have the right to refuse items that won&#39;t work for them.<br/>

My dad&#39;s two favorites (and yes, this speaks volumes about his parenting):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Too much laughing leads to crying.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You want _______? People in Hell want ice water.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I remember so vividly being utterly confused by the latter when I was very young. I didn&#39;t really know what was meant by Hell, despite going to Catholic school, so I thought, well, why doesn&#39;t somebody just get them ice water, then?<br/>
<br/>
But I also remember feeling that maxims somehow carried more weight than casual speech, as if, because it was a codified phrase, it must be true at least for some people. <br/>
<br/>
Some of my favorite discussions with my almost 5 year old have been prompted by explaining what was meant by idioms and expressions. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490890439">I read a book about the hurricane that hit Galveston in 1900. People from around <br/>
the U.S., and maybe even further afield, donated lots of goods and clothes and <br/>
hand me down things. Apparently the citizens of Galveston were quite dismissive <br/>
of much of the care packages because they didn&#39;t see themselves as folks who <br/>
needed charity so they felt that the goods they received should be of higher <br/>
quality. Clara Barton is quoted in the book as saying that it is often a problem <br/>
in situations like that of the recipient of the hand out being more discerning <br/>
than the giver is anticipating. So, beggars are often choosers. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>That reminds me of the saying &quot;Waste not, want not&quot; too. Where I live there are a number of churches that distribute free bread and other foods - overstock and almost-out-of-date foods from local groceries. There&#39;s a surprising amount of pressure among people with low incomes to go and take what&#39;s there, regardless of whether its something you want. I have two neighbors who bring me food from those distributions and I&#39;ve started asking them not to, or at least being clear that the vast majority of it is going into my compost heap. The reactions I&#39;ve gotten are a mix of &quot;beggars can&#39;t be choosers&quot; and &quot;waste not, want not&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s an issue that comes up with a lot of families new to unschooling, too - kids &quot;wasting&quot; food (or paper or whatnot), and yet at the same time not wanting to tailor food (especially food, but art supplies and toys too) to what kids actually want. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324604190">My dad had a couple of these...he would often say that &quot;as long as we did our best&quot; it was ok, but if we didnt do as well as he thought we should, we got &quot;you are not living up to your potential&quot;. It never mattered if I felt it was my best, he was the one who decided how hard I tried, he always felt I could do better, do more.<br/>
<br/>
He also used to start off lectures to my brother and I saying &quot;You are not acting like the X year old that you are&quot; and the funny part was he always got our ages wrong. <br/>
<br/>
I also remember an incident with my mom-I must have been 3 or 4,and she was yelling at me, and I felt wronged, though I dont remember if I was doing something naughty or not, but I told her that when I grew up, I was going to be a mean mommy to my kids because she was so mean, and how did she feel about that?<br/>
<br/>
Ive often reflected on that incident...it has been a touchstone for me, because of course I realized that I never wanted my children to feel that way about me, and I realized that I was going to have to really learn a whole new way to be  a parent, and that I wanted a much different relationship with my kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-857464021">I&#39;m a mere lurker here, but can I pipe in for a minute to share a phrase? This one still hurts. My dad&#39;s favorite phrase and his basic philosophy of parenting was, &quot;buck up.&quot; As in suck it up, deal with it, too bad.<br/>
<br/>
I have such sad memories of my first semester at college. My parents settled me into my dorm five hours away from home at the college they picked out because they were paying for it, left me there with no car and no friends, and went home proud to have the first college student in the entire family. I would call home and cry and beg them to come get me and bring me home and let me go to a local college. Their response was always the same, &quot;buck up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I did. I hated being there so I took tons of hours of classes each semester and summer school and finished in three years instead of four so I could get out of there. I guess they look on that as success on their part. I bucked up and got that degree. I also married within two months of graduating and left their house.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so not a perfect parent, and am often impatient and harsh with my kids. And then I feel crushed when I am. But if nothing else, I&#39;ll never tell them to just buck up and deal with something that hurts or troubles them when I am perfectly capable of helping them find a solution that will bring them peace.<br/>

I found that dismissive and patronizing. Besides, what else is there? Life <br/>
itself is just a phase.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-==-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;&#39;s a phase.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think it *can* be dismissive, but I use it frequently. Many things *are* phases. Not everything and not for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My father thought it time to get me a horse when I was 13 because he was afraid it might be a phase and he wanted me to have a horse before I outgrew the phase and discovered boys. &lt;G&gt; Little did he know, it would be a l-o-n-g phase, and the *boys* that I eventually discovered would be my sons! &lt;G&gt; I haven&#39;t ridden since Cameron (22) was an infant, but at one time it was an all-consuming phase!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But *many* things are phases, and it can help a parent get through the difficult stage if she truly *knows* it&#39;s short term. Nursing is a phase. Holding their hands is a phase (Although both my boys will still hold my hand---it&#39;s not the same thing---or maybe it is. Maybe I&#39;m getting so forgetful that they feel the need to protect/watch out for *me*! &lt;G&gt;). Carrying them is a phase. Feeding them. Co-sleeping. Housing them. Some manners of dress. Some haircuts. A teen&#39;s seemingly excessive need for sleep and its accompanying wacky sleep schedule.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If parents can see the phase as just that: a period of need or discovery, it can make it easier to accept and enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s Goth phase was short. His skating phase. His filming phase. His magic phase. Honestly, I miss them all!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Many, many passions are phases. Some DO become lifelong passions, but many come and go. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe *just* drop the &quot;just?&quot; &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1068000860">&quot;One day, Kelly, he&#39;ll be bigger than you are.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Meaning: &quot;You&#39;re getting away with picking on him now because you&#39;re bigger; but when he gets bigger, he&#39;s gonna let you have it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He did.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My lesson? It&#39;s OK to hit others if you&#39;re bigger than they are. <br/>
