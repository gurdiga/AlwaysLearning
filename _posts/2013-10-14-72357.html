You may be thinking, &quot;No, I meant ....&quot; but because you&#39;ve worded it as you did, you&#39;ve wrapped feelings of unschooling (and your child) not letting you have a choice about staying home.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling itself is a choice. It&#39;s a choice to put as a priority your child&#39;s innate needs to grow up at home with her family as she learns about the world. And then you fit everything else around that including how you bring in enough money to live on. Some families pare back to the point where they can live on one person&#39;s income. Some split the work hours so one spouse works days the other nights. Some work from home. The possibilities are limited only by imagination (and then a bit by what&#39;s possible ;-))<br/>
<br/>
If your priority is to work outside the home and fit unschooling into that,  unschooling won&#39;t flow as well as it does for families who make unschooling their priority and fit everything else around unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1026927155"><p>I just wanted to second this question. If anyone doesn&#39;t mind sharing examples of how they fit work around unschooling, I&#39;d love to hear them. Everyday I&#39;m thinking about how important it is to me to unschool my 1-year-old, and right now I&#39;m mostly home with her--experimenting with saying yes more!--and working in the mornings and weekends. But working in my &quot;spare&quot; time has gotten exhausting, and our family is on the cusp of several different options. My husband has a job that almost supports us, but we live in an incredibly expensive area so he is looking at other jobs. I am also looking at jobs as a professor, but with half my heart in it because I only want one of us to be working and I am more excited about the idea of unschooling and staying at home than he is. Still, a huge part of me is afraid of dropping my career in academics, and right now I can tell it&#39;s too hard to maintain these intellectual projects in my &quot;spare&quot; time, especially if I have another kid. I have been reading and searching, and because of all these big changes in our lives it would be really helpful to me to see more examples and hear stories of work and unschooling from experienced parents (when they have time!).</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Kaitlin<br></p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1026927155ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In alwayslearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;jfetteroll@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-1026927155ygrps-yiv-1888110677">On Oct 14, 2013, at 12:22 PM, &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:anacarol.francisco@...">anacarol.francisco@...</a>&gt; &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:anacarol.francisco@...">anacarol.francisco@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-464085111">You can do anything that works for you and your family. Maybe your little one would enjoy spending time with Grammy or uncle or friends while your away for a bit. Maybe he/she will hate it and you will have to work something else out. Be perceptive as to what works for your family.<br/>
<br/>
Some of my kids would be fine, some would most certainly not. So, I stay home. At one point it involved having only one car. But the kids completely enjoyed walking, being pulled in a wagon, riding the bus or bikes until we could afford a second car. We gave up certain purchases and became very creative in our free to low cost entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
Just more thoughts to roll around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1198770430"><div dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-1198770430gmail_extra">I worked in several different jobs and worked sometimes from home during all of our years of unschooling. I worked part time almost all of that time, but full-time from home during just a bit of it. <br>
<br>Here are the ways I handled it:<br><br>Sometimes I worked in the evenings. I&#39;d be standing on the porch with a baby in my arms waiting for my husband to pull up and make the switch!<br><br>Sometimes I worked weekends - Friday nights and all day Saturday and Sunday.<br>
<br>Sometimes I worked where I could take a kid or two with me.<br><br>Sometimes I worked from home. (Picture me at the desktop computer with kids playing on a nearby computer and me nursing a baby while typing up a report.)<br>
<br>Sometimes I traded off with friends - they took my kids while I worked and I took their kids other times.<br><br>Sometimes I signed up all three kids for one activity that would give me a few hours on a regular schedule to work.<br>
<br>I hired a mother&#39;s helper for a while - she came and played with the kids and took care of their needs while I was in the other room working from home.<br><br>When the kids were old enough to be home without me, I worked early in the mornings. They&#39;d sleep while I was at work. I&#39;d get home around 11 or noon and we&#39;d still have plenty of daytime hours together.Â <br>
<br>I believe I pretty much always was a little low on sleep and I know for sure I didn&#39;t do a whole lot of housework. I also gave up on the idea of offering regular home-cooked meals to my family and gave in to eating out and eating take-out a whole lot more than I would have otherwise.<br>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060276068"><div dir="ltr">I&#39;ve worked part time since my son was born (he&#39;s nine now). We&#39;ve done a few different things over the years:<div><br><div>-When our son was born, and until he was six, my partner reduced her hours to four days per week, so she could have more time at home with our son and I could have a work day.Â </div>
<div>-I&#39;ve taught at the university most years, and always asked for an evening class, so I could work when my partner was home.</div><div>-I&#39;ve got an awesome mother who currently spends two days a week Â with my son. She&#39;s fully in support of unschooling and they have a lovely relationship. I schedule any outside the home work for those two days.</div>
<div>-I work from home, mostly, as a writer. My hours are very flexible. When my son was younger and needed me to be doing stuff with him all the time, I got up early and wrote before he woke up. Now that he is nine, I can often write while he has a friend over or is deeply absorbed in an activity that doesn&#39;t involve me.Â </div>
<div>-When my son was 6 or 7, and I had deadlines or had got myself into a situation where I&#39;d taken on more work than I had time for, I hired a mother&#39;s helper (lovely 12 year old homeschooler) for a couple hours so that my son had someone to play with while I frantically typed away in the corner of the living room. He enjoyed his time with her. Later on we hired a university student one morning a week to do some Minecraft related programming with my son, which he loved, and which gave me some extra time to work.Â </div>
<div><br></div><div>Overall, I&#39;d say I&#39;ve mostly worked anywhere from 12- 20 hours a week since he was a toddler, and while there have been stretches in which I could have used a bit more sleep, it&#39;s generally been great. I love having so much time with my son, and unschooling has made all of our lives happier and more relaxed and peaceful. And I love my work, and my son enjoys discussing the books I write and giving me ideas and celebrating at book launches... and I think it&#39;s good that he sees me pursuing a passion and making money doing something I love.Â </div>

Currently on Mondays a 70 year old wonderful lady who describes herself as their &#39;Dutch Grandma&#39; comes and takes the children out for six hours. They go to museums, the swimming pool, the beach, her house and have a truly wonderful time. She is totally on board with &#39;being enthusiastic and sharing passions and speaking and playing in Dutch with the children&#39; which was the only job description I gave her.</span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;" class="ygrps-yiv-1422701234yui_3_10_3_6_1381946169091_40"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">Does this mean that we are not to be described as unschoolers because I am not there with them during this time?</span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;" class="ygrps-yiv-1422701234yui_3_10_3_6_1381946169091_42"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;">I believe they are having a wonderful, authentic, enriching life experience which I can&#39;t give them (if I was there, they would not speak Dutch). As they get older I hope that we will come across other people who will provide experiences that I cannot. Currently this is a language. Soon, for one child, it may well be work-shadowing an architect.Â </span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;" class="ygrps-yiv-1422701234yui_3_10_3_6_1381946169091_44"><span style="background-color:transparent;line-height:1.22;"><br></span></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">The side benefit for me is that I am able to do small-time bits of work translating or admin related work for my very small business.Â </p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;" class="ygrps-yiv-1422701234yui_3_10_3_6_1381946169091_46"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">So what I&#39;m saying is, in a similar way to Joyce pointing out the many possibilities, family jigsaws evolve and come together in so many different ways.

Then I worked from home for a while but wasn&#39;t being paid enough to make ends meet so I got a part-time job which I&#39;ve been at for four years this November.

The 20 year old lives on her own but the 18 year old along with my 11 year old still live at home. My oldest two children&#39;s father passed away about 5 1/2 years ago so I was getting Social Security benefits for both of them until they turned 18. I get child support for my youngest child. None of these were enough to live on so I still chose to work part-time to make ends meet. I would love to stay home full-time.Â </font></div><div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color:transparent;"><br></font></div><div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color:transparent;">Once I lost the SS benefits for my 18 year old, things got really tough. I discussed working full-time with my children asking them if they&#39;d rather have me work full-time so we could stay in our rental home or would they rather have me continue working part-time and see what other options were available for me to do so. I talked to my mother who works full-time. We discussed getting a place together so that we could both help each other out. My aunt & uncle had a rental home that the renters were moving out of. It was perfect timing. My mom, my son, my youngest daughter, and I all moved in together. The rent is more than what both of us were paying but since we split the rent and all the utilities, it is cheaper in the long run. The house is also bigger than both of our two old homes put together so we have plenty of space for when we need our alone time or have friends over.</font></div><div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color:transparent;"><br></font></div><div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color:transparent;">Â It has helped me financially so that I can continue to work part-time and spend the majority of time with my children. It&#39;s helped my mom financially and also because my son helps by mowing the yard and with yard work as well as any other handyman job that needs done. I help with cooking dinner, dishes, laundry, and other cleaning so that my mom doesn&#39;t have to worry about those things. It&#39;s worked out really well for us. I work Mondays from 8am to 5pm, Fridays from 8am to 3pm, and then every other Saturday from 8am to 3pm. So, I&#39;m only gone 2 to 3 days per week. Either my son or my mom are with my youngest daughter while I&#39;m at work depending on their work schedules. However, I can also bring my youngest daughter with me on days that the doctor isn&#39;t in and we don&#39;t have patients.Â </font></div><div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color:transparent;"><br></font></div><div><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="background-color:transparent;">I work for a dental office. My daughter comes with me at least once a week on a day that it&#39;s just me in the office. She brings our laptop, notebook paper, pencils, crayons, and any other items that she wants. Those days are great because we can still be together even while I&#39;m working. I still have time to spend with her in between my job duties. So, that is how we made it work in the beginning and how we make it work now. It may change again someday but that&#39;s what works for now. Well, my daughter just came in the room so I&#39;m going to go spend time with her which is my favorite thing in the world to do. :-)</font></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2003767735"><div dir="ltr">Our daughter is 1.5 years old and I&#39;ve been doing bits and pieces of work and study since she was about 10 months old. My husband and I both work as researchers / tutors in the humanities at universities and I started back doing one subject a semester of my Masters when our daughter turned one.<div>
<br><div>Because both of our work arrangements are pretty flexible my husband has always come to my university class once a week with me and our daughter (uni is an hour drive away and class goes for three hours... way too long to go without a feed when she was little, she likes her milk!). If needs be, my husband would then make up a few extra hours on a Saturday. A couple of times when my husband had something on we brought some toys and she happily (in the main) sat through class with me.</div>
<div><br></div><div>One thing I loved (and still do!) about have uni readings to do and work that I can do on a laptop is that it means I have something to work on when our daughter naps during the day. As a result I have found it super easy to lie down with her for 1-3 hours while she naps without feeling like I wanted/needed to get up to do something. When I have time, I sometimes read a good book, but most of the time naps are a great chance to get some reading and/or work done while cuddling a beautiful sleeping bub :-) (I don&#39;t imagine it will work quite the same if/when number two comes along, but has been wonderful with our first!) I still manage to get some housework done, but that&#39;s almost always something I&#39;ve done when my daughter has been awake (it sometimes takes a lot longer, but most of the time she loves being involved).</div>
<div><br></div><div>We also spend two days a week around at my parent&#39;s house when our daughter gets to play with her grandma. When she was smaller grandma would always stay at home with our daughter while I worked in my parent&#39;s study so I could see her regularly through the day. Now that she&#39;s a bit older and happy to go without a breastfeed for much longer they often go out to play somewhere and also visit my grandparents (her great grandparents) once a week. I also do some work at night and sometimes on the weekend.</div>
<div><div><br></div><div>My husband asked me the other day if I would still choose to work if he earnt twice as much as he currently does. I said that I might not do paid work, but would probably still be involved in something. The reasoning for me is not that I don&#39;t like the idea of spending almost all of my time with my daughter, but because I love the opportunities she has to spend time with her dad, grandma and great grandparents. As a result, she has a very close bond with all of them (and other family members) - something we&#39;ve always wanted to let her have without feeling like she was ever forced to be away from me if she didn&#39;t want to be (in the early days I&#39;d be lucky to get 2-3 hours of work done a day). Her dad and I are both committed to learning more about unschooling and her grandma is also interested and interacts with our daughter in a very similar way to us.</div>
<div><br></div><div>Neither of us know exactly what we&#39;ll end up doing further down the track (once our daughter is school age and/or we have more children) but I&#39;m very comfortable with sticking to a &#39;bits and pieces&#39; approach to work for the time being and always have an eye out for anything that looks flexible enough to fit in with our lifestyle. Another factor for us is that my husband may need to spend a few years overseas for work at some point, which is another reason I gravitate towards work that can be done from home / remotely.</div>

Generally speaking, little kids need more direct attention than they will when they&#39;re older - if your little one isn&#39;t all that mobile yet, this may still be very theoretical for you ;) but toddlers, in particular, can take up a whole lot of time and attention because they&#39;re hugely interested in everything, can get to a lot of things, but still don&#39;t have the awareness to keep themselves safe. That doesn&#39;t necessarily mean staying home all the time - some kids like to be out and about, especially as toddlers, but others find outings stressful even when they&#39;re enjoyable. And many kids go through a stage where transitions are rough. Those are factors to take into consideration - sometimes it&#39;s better to mostly be at home, other times it can be better to mostly be out and about.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;As they get older and better able to meet some of their own needs, they won&#39;t need as much attention - there&#39;s a handy chart here:<br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely">http://sandradodd.com/howto/precisely</a><br><br>Older kids and teens can take up a surprising amount of time if they have a lot of out-of-home interests, too! They don&#39;t need quite so much direct attention, but they&#39;ll need transportation and help figuring out how to do the things they want to do.&nbsp;<br><br>Both my kids needed someone to be right there with them every waking moment for a few years, so during those years I was home with the kids.

<br>
What do you want to do?<br>
<br>
Do you have feelings of unschooling making you stay home? Or your child? Or other unschoolers?<br>
<br>
You may be thinking, &quot;No, I meant ....&quot; but because you&#39;ve worded it as you did, you&#39;ve wrapped feelings of unschooling (and your child) not letting you have a choice about staying home.<br>
<br>
Unschooling itself is a choice. It&#39;s a choice to put as a priority your child&#39;s innate needs to grow up at home with her family as she learns about the world. And then you fit everything else around that including how you bring in enough money to live on. Some families pare back to the point where they can live on one person&#39;s income. Some split the work hours so one spouse works days the other nights. Some work from home. The possibilities are limited only by imagination (and then a bit by what&#39;s possible ;-))<br>
<br>
If your priority is to work outside the home and fit unschooling into that,  unschooling won&#39;t flow as well as it does for families who make unschooling their priority and fit everything else around unschooling.<br>

If we do end up going overseas it will be for my husband to complete a PhD, so chances are he&#39;ll be making a lot less money than he is now. We don&#39;t yet know which country we&#39;re likely to end up in or for exactly how long, but the chances of a PhD at all are fairly high. So keeping my eye out for flexible, can-travel kind of work now is my way of building up links and connections with people and work places that I can draw on when we move. We both know we want to unschool our daughter, we both know we&#39;re likely to be more nomadic and poorer in a couple of years time and that grandparents are much less likely to be around to help us out. Rather than waiting for all of that to happen we&#39;re both trying to think of ways we can do little things now that will hopefully make things easier and more do-able then.</p> <div class="ygrps-yiv-2004807605ygroups-quoted"><br><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> ---In AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com, &lt;Sandra@...&gt; wrote:<br><br><div id="ygrps-yiv-2004807605ygrps-yiv-1537626591">-=-<span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">&nbsp;The reasoning for me is not that I don&#39;t like the idea of spending almost all of my time with my daughter,&nbsp;-=-</span><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">If that&#39;s your priority, it will help you decide what to do.</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">If you want unschooling to work, and to be the best kind of parent you can be, it would probably help if you look at WHY you &quot;don&#39;t like the idea&quot; of spending almost all your time with your daughter.</span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);"><br></span></div><div><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);">-=-</span><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Another factor for us is that my husband may need to spend a few years overseas for work at some point, which is another reason I gravitate towards work that can be done from home / remotely.-=-</span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">If he&#39;s going to be making twice as much as he makes now and you could afford to be a fulltime parent, especially in a different country, it could be really wonderful. &nbsp;If you&#39;re overseas, the grandparents won&#39;t be as readily available.</span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Your question is a big one, in that it&#39;s far reaching and nebulous, but I want to focus on a seminal bit: &nbsp;&quot;</span>Do I have to stay at home...&quot;</div><div><br></div><div>&quot;Do I have to?&quot;</div><div><br></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/haveto">http://sandradodd.com/haveto</a></div><div><br></div><div>Anything you feel you &quot;have to&quot; do is entrapping and stiffling.</div><div>Something you *choose* to do can be empowering and enlivening.</div><div><br></div><div>Sandra</div><div><br></div><div>P.S.... &nbsp;going to lift that last big for a Just Add Light and Stir. :-)</div><div>Anyone who doesn&#39;t know what I&#39;m talking about, here:&nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/</a></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255);font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;"><br></span></div></div></span></blockquote></div></div>

If she&#39;s happy spending time with
 you, and you&#39;re happy being with her, that&#39;s great. If she&#39;s happy also doing things with other people and there are other people around who want to hang out with her, that&#39;s great, too. It doesn&#39;t have to be all one thing or all the other, and it will very likely change over time. Don&#39;t get so bogged down trying to second-guess what&#39;s going to work for your kid in a year, two years, five years! It&#39;s not possible to do that much advance planning - you don&#39;t, Can&#39;t know how and when your child is going to change and grow, what&#39;s going to be interesting or important to her in the future. &nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom:1em;padding:0px;line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-size:12.727272033691406px;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;">&gt;&gt;We both know we want to unschool our daughter, we both know we&#39;re likely to be more nomadic and poorer in a couple
 of years time and that grandparents are much less likely to be around to help us out. Rather than waiting for all of that to happen we&#39;re both trying to think of ways we can do little things now that will hopefully make things easier and more do-able then.&lt;&lt;</div><div style="margin-bottom:1em;padding:0px;line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-size:12.727272033691406px;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;">If you know you want to home/unschool, plan to be available to your kid. Make that part non-negotiable. How it actually works out might change a whole lot over time - in the past decade my family has been through a number of different arrangements in terms of who&#39;s home and/or working at home, and when and how much - full time, full time packed into three days, part time, multiple part-time jobs, assorted ways of working from home, self-employment... it
 keeps changing as our lives and the world around us change, It helps to have a really solid sense of what&#39;s most important to you and be really flexible around that.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom:1em;padding:0px;line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-size:12.727272033691406px;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;"><br></div><div style="margin-bottom:1em;padding:0px;line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-size:12.727272033691406px;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;">Planning different kinds of work may or may not work out - and there&#39;s no way to predict that because you can&#39;t predict what kind of time and energy your child will need from you as she grows. She may need lots of attention some times. Or lots of running around to different activities. Or lots of
 time to socialize with other people. Or lots of regularity and predictability. Or a lot of help with transitions. Or a lot of time to focus. Any of those things can put a kink in your plans if you&#39;re trying to fit her needs in around your work - that&#39;s why it&#39;s important to be really solid about your priorities, so when what you imagine your life will be doesn&#39;t match up to the reality of your child&#39;s needs, you know where to put your energy.&nbsp;</div><div style="margin-bottom:1em;padding:0px;line-height:15.852272033691406px;font-size:12.727272033691406px;background-color:transparent;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;font-style:normal;">---Meredith</div></div></html></div>
