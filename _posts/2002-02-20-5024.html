I think I&#39;m freaked out. &lt;weak g&gt; None of you just called to mess with my<br/>

her son.  I told her I am not a tutor.  &quot;But you homeschool *your* kids!&quot; she <br/>
countered.  Apparently she could not understand the difference.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1429099583">Pam, <br/>
Sounds to me like she may have been trying to &quot;hide&quot; her kids from <br/>
someone (finding their names listed as students at any type <br/>
of &quot;official&quot; school)??? Just a thought.<br/>
Then again, a few years ago I was asked to homeschool a neighbor kid <br/>
because mom is a single working mother and the daughter was/is being <br/>
teased at ps.<br/>

<br/>
Can you handle some more kids around all day? Sounds<br/>
like the Mama&#39;s may have a good idea, from the<br/>
children&#39;s point of view. Maybe the KIDS asked to be<br/>
at your house.<br/>

Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Often thro the years I have had either kids wanting me to homeschool them <br/>
(one little neighbor boy hid in the closet when his mom came to get him to <br/>
send him off to afternoon kinder.), or neighbors wanting to know if I took <br/>
other peoples&#39; kids.   I thought this was especially &quot;interesting&quot; when I <br/>
would meet new neighbors - having just moved in - and want to set the record <br/>
straight right away why the kids where home - and just like that without even <br/>
knowing me, they would ask if I took other kids.  I think it is a commentary <br/>
on the dissatisfaction with ps, and also, lack of confidence or time on the <br/>
part of the parents.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been asked twenty times over the years--the most recent being a week <br/>
ago.  I used to explain in detail.  Now I just say, &quot;No, it doesn&#39;t work that <br/>
way.&quot;<br/>
