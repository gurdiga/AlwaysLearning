<div id="ygrps-yiv-2021827797">well, i looked up tcs, wondering what is said there specifically about coersion and i found this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Another possible misinterpretation of TCS is the idea that coercion is always wrong - that if one child is attacking another with a cricket bat, it is wrong to intervene. On the contrary, it is vital to protect the victim, and that might well involve stopping the attacking child against his or her will, i.e., coercively. That there would have been a way to avoid this in the first place is, at such a moment, irrelevant for all practical purposes. But in the bigger picture, it is reassuring: if the good things in life could be obtained by mechanically following a rule, then only a wicked and unworthy parent would ever fail to find a common preference with their beloved child. But TCS is not a rule. When we say that it is possible and desirable to raise children without intentionally coercing them, we don&#39;t mean that if everything goes wrong sometimes, you must be an evil shit unworthy of life, what we mean is: hey, there&#39;s hope - things need not be like this for ever!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
seemed relevant to recent discussions....<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>

  funny, because i looked up &quot;coerscion&quot; yesterday on dictionary.com- i had the same interpretation as you - that it was manipulative use of power - but the dictionary says this:<br/>
<br/>
        1. the act of coercing; use of force or intimidation to obtain compliance. <br/>
        2. force or the power to use force in gaining compliance, as by a government or police force. <br/>
<br/>
  but merriam webster says this (online at dict.com) - which is more what you were saying...:<br/>
<br/>
   Merriam-Webster&#39;s Dictionary of Law - Cite This Source - Share This <br/>
  Main Entry: co·er·cion<br/>
  Pronunciation: kO-&#39;&r-zh&n, -sh&n<br/>
  Function: noun<br/>
  : the use of express or implied threats of violence or reprisal (as discharge from employment) or other intimidating behavior that puts a person in immediate fear of the consequences in order to compel that person to act against his or her will; also : the defense that one acted under coercion <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-943869190">When &quot;not coercing&quot; is the top priority, the only thing that really  <br/>
matters, life is different than when the priority is creating a rich  <br/>
and stimulating learning environment or developing strong and happy  <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t so much that I disagree with them about working toward not  <br/>
coercing, but that I don&#39;t find their focus to be useful in creating  <br/>
the kind of family life that I want. My observation and opinion is  <br/>
that those who focus on not coercing are neglecting other important  <br/>
aspects of parenting.  If they are in a restaurant and their child is  <br/>
being disruptive, they wouldn&#39;t carry him outside, to avoid bothering  <br/>
other people. Not coercing is a higher priority than being  <br/>
considerate. If they are late trying to catch a plane and the child is  <br/>
busy playing and doesn&#39;t want to go, they would miss their flight, pay  <br/>
the penalty, go later, or not go at all, rather than coerce the child.  <br/>
Yes, when it is a matter of life and death safety issues, they say  <br/>
that coercion might be necessary (blame the parent for their poor  <br/>
planning), but otherwise, the child&#39;s judgment and parent&#39;s judgment  <br/>
are considered equally valid, ignoring the reality that parents may  <br/>
have much more information and more understanding of consequences,  <br/>
Plus, the parent is expected to be the one to give in when mutually  <br/>
agreeable solutions can&#39;t be found.<br/>
<br/>
I was influenced, for the better, by reading all the discussion about  <br/>
how to find mutually agreeable solutions - as I was reading about how  <br/>
far people were willing to go to get to that point, I practiced and  <br/>
learned, myself, how possible it was to work together, not against  <br/>
each other.<br/>
<br/>
I think, in practice, it goes too far - it ignores the reality that  <br/>
parents are more knowledgeable and more able to anticipate  <br/>
consequences in ways that children cannot. And, I don&#39;t think it is  <br/>
conducive to a congenial social life and I don&#39;t think it is fair to  <br/>
the children when they are allowed to be rude and inconsiderate and  <br/>
cause difficulties for other people. Yes, parents will give them the  <br/>
benefit of their own &quot;theories&quot; about what might happen if they walk  <br/>
around on grandma&#39;s coffee table or hit dad&#39;s boss&#39;s car with a  <br/>
baseball bat, but the parents will readily admit that they might be  <br/>
wrong and the child might be right that it is okay to do. Maybe the  <br/>
other person won&#39;t care. Maybe the parent will have to pay to have the  <br/>
damage repaired. Maybe it is worth it to the child. Maybe, though, the  <br/>
parent should take the child OFF the coffee table or take the bat out  <br/>
of the child&#39;s hands (against the child&#39;s will - meaning &quot;coercively&quot;)  <br/>
because the parent does have the experience and judgment to know why  <br/>
these are not good things for the child to be doing.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But &quot;to gain compliance.&quot;   That means first I would&#39;ve had to say  <br/>
&quot;Put the gun down,&quot; and wait.  And then &quot;Put the gun down or I will  <br/>
disarm you,&quot; and then wait. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If you suddenly disarm someone (a kid with a cricket bat, or a  <br/>
toddler with a tree branch), that&#39;s not manipulation.<br/>

I&#39;m on my kids&#39; side and they&#39;re on my side, and it works very well.   <br/>
Keith is on my side AND on Holly&#39;s side, when I call and ask his  <br/>
advice, from the grocery store, where I can&#39;t find anything we  <br/>
actually need at home and am just walking around there talking to  <br/>
Keith.  (What a day, and mostly good, but long.)<br/>

  iagree with this - i just also think that the problems arise when parents send a message that there is something WRONG with their child for even WANTING to climb on the coffee table, because they have been told, and they no better, and blah blah blah.  or for having the impulse and not stopping themselves.  <br/>
<br/>
  i think this scenario (the lecturing, shaming, etc.) is wayyy more common than the parent that leaves it up to the child about whether to hit dad&#39;s bosse&#39;s car with a baseball bat.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, you&#39;ll never know whether this is a real situation in any TCS  <br/>
family&#39;s real life, because they absolutely will not ever talk about  <br/>
their real children - it isn&#39;t allowed.<br/>
<br/>
So - yeah - isn&#39;t very likely we&#39;ll run into many TCS/NCP people at  <br/>
the soccer field or in the grocery store or at our family&#39;s  <br/>
Thanksgiving dinner!<br/>
<br/>
But, they&#39;ve had an influence in the online homeschooling world and  <br/>
they are very often unschoolers, so their ideas get confused with  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And there are people who think that IS exactly what we&#39;re promoting -  <br/>
letting kids &quot;run wild&quot; with no adult intervention even when kids are  <br/>
negatively impacting others.<br/>
