<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531950567">I&#39;m also on the unschooling basics list and someone replied to a post <br/>
with what I considered to be a thought that doesn&#39;t connect to what I <br/>
think unschooling is about.  In another note, she said that list and <br/>
others like it don&#39;t own the idea of unschooling and that there are <br/>
different degrees of unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought I remembered this very thing discussed on this list not too <br/>
long ago.  I know people can make up any definitions they want, but I&#39;m <br/>
not so sure about the idea of different degrees of unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s right.<br/>
<br/>
Someone who spent six hours a day (only 180 days a year) encouraging  <br/>
their children to learn school subjects in creative and individual  <br/>
and non-schoolish ways could say &quot;unschooling&quot; and it would be true.<br/>
<br/>
They wouldn&#39;t be unschooling as well as our family did (in my opinion  <br/>
and experience), but they would be unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There is unschooling that barely cuts it and unschooling that  <br/>
transforms families.<br/>
<br/>
I have unfinished collections of different unschooling &quot;degrees&quot; and  <br/>
facets.  (I guess my whole site is an unfinished collection, but  <br/>
these might be even more unfinished than other parts.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1659273039">I&#39;m enjoying this thread.  I&#39;ve wondered since my children are<br/>
deciding to give school a try this year, if I can still consider<br/>
myself an unschooler??  Part of me wishes they chose to stay home,<br/>
wonder what I could have done differently for them to desire to stay<br/>
home.  But they are wanting to do this so I feel like I want to<br/>
support them 100%!  I could take a negative stance and tell them how I<br/>
think that school is not the most conducive place to learn about life<br/>
(but they know that I feel that way).  But I don&#39;t want to be negative<br/>
about their choices.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s quite an adjustment for me. I had a conversation with Lydia today<br/>
and took your advice Sandra and said that schools can create a<br/>
distance between some parents and that is one of my worries.  It was a<br/>
good conversation. <br/>
<br/>
Even though it&#39;s not compulsory for them, I wonder if what we are<br/>
doing is still unschooling?  I shouldn&#39;t worry about what I am<br/>
considered though, and just realize that I&#39;m trying to make their life<br/>
happy and support their choices.<br/>
<br/>
We took our paperwork in and the principal again asked me if I wanted<br/>
to have Lydia &quot;tested&quot; for &quot;enrichment&quot;.  I&#39;m so bad and just had to<br/>
say &quot;don&#39;t all kids deserve enrichment?&quot; :)!  I said we&#39;ll just see<br/>
how things go and see what she wants to do.  <br/>
<br/>
Now my concern, worry, apprehension (I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m<br/>
feeling) is... what if she does like it??  Do some kids go to school<br/>
by choice and actually enjoy being there?  Will she eventually realize<br/>
what a waste of time it is??  I should probably be working on getting<br/>
rid of these negative attitudes of mine towards school??  <br/>
<br/>
This is difficult.  Has anyone else been through this??<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listening,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m thinking that your children can&#39;t be both schooled and unschooled, but that you can <br/>
continue to practice respectful parenting, which may be, in my opinion, more important to <br/>
recognize than to spend your energy pondering the other.  Your parenting doesn&#39;t have to <br/>
change, which means that your children still get to have their own voices in their own lives <br/>
and have your support and advice in creating their experiences.<br/>

seeds are planted, understanding is fostered.  These can continue no matter what.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s been my experience so far that when children want to go to school it is for social <br/>
reasons, and I do know some that don&#39;t like the school but do like the social life, and i <br/>
know one girl who likes the school work as well--but she is in a family where the mom <br/>
took a much more passive role, even when her children have asked for opportunities.<br/>
<br/>
Will she eventually realize<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what a waste of time it is??  I should probably be working on getting<br/>
&gt; rid of these negative attitudes of mine towards school??<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I did find school to be a waste of time.  The actual time I spent waiting for things was <br/>
mind-blowing.  I&#39;ve always been one of the first to finish any task in a group setting, so I&#39;d <br/>
sit and wait and wait and wonder why I was always waiting. <br/>
<br/>
I get that you don&#39;t want to have constant conflict with your kids over their choices, but it <br/>
also seems insincere to try to &quot;get rid of these negative attitudes..&quot;  If your attitudes are <br/>
beliefs that you hold based on research or experience, then getting rid of them to avoid <br/>
conflict probably isn&#39;t modeling what you really want to for your children.  Maybe you can <br/>
find a way to hold your own beliefs, but put supporting their desire to try school as <br/>
number 1.  That seems fair to me.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck with your transition, Joanna</div>

<br/>
Sure.  If they have a choice, why would they keep going if they  <br/>
didn&#39;t enjoy being there?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I get that you don&#39;t want to have constant conflict with your kids  <br/>

<br/>
I disagree with Joanna on this one.  If people couldn&#39;t get over  <br/>
their  negative attitudes, how would they ever change?<br/>
<br/>
If a parent&#39;s aversion to school is the only reason for unschooling,  <br/>
that&#39;s less solid than if the parent untangles her own hurts and  <br/>
fears and sees natural learning as a positive thing, not just the  <br/>
avoidance of a 20-year-old spectre in the mom.   That&#39;s not the only  <br/>
thing school avoidance can be, but it is sometimes that:  the mom  <br/>
wants to relive her own life through her children, and she hated  <br/>
school, so she will &quot;spare them&quot; from school whether they want that  <br/>
or not.<br/>
<br/>
A mom who is happy and hopeful and fun is way better to be with than  <br/>
a mom who frets and worries and reminds kids that school is  <br/>
horrible.  School might be better than that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the case here, it&#39;s just that that *can* be the  <br/>
case, sometimes.<br/>

I don&#39;t think school is this awful place, I think for some people it&#39;s<br/>
better than home.  However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the best place to be,<br/>
or the best way to learn about living and life and stuff!<br/>

activities 4-5 nights a week and loves to hang out with friends too! <br/>
I was just really enjoying our days!! <br/>
<br/>
I think Lydia has a pretty great attitude about it.  Her younger<br/>
neighbor friend was &quot;quizzing her&quot; and noticed Lydia didn&#39;t have the<br/>
greatest cursive skills.  She told her she wouldn&#39;t be promoted to 7th<br/>
grade if she couldn&#39;t write cursive.  Lydia came home and said &quot;in the<br/>
real world does it REALLY matter if you can write cursive Mom?!&quot;  We<br/>
both had a good laugh!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter, now 15, struggled with her decision to go back to school.  <br/>
She went for a semester in 6th grade and a class or two each year after <br/>
that until high school.  Last year, she decided to go back to school <br/>
full-time and, for the most part, is pleased with her decision.<br/>
It was hard for me to support her decision to go back to school, even <br/>
though I loved school as a kid.  What I had to do was recognize that <br/>
these were her choices, and while I could empathize with the inevitable <br/>
frustrations, I had to stop saying &quot;you know you could just stay <br/>
home.&quot;  She knows that and has made a choice to go to school.  It&#39;s my <br/>
job, as her mom, to be supportive and to keep the lines of <br/>
communication open by listening, helping her problem solve, etc.  I had <br/>
to make sure I was supporting her decisions and not trying to undermine <br/>
them, ykwim?<br/>
It&#39;s hard to have her gone every day - I miss her so much!  Her <br/>
decision to go back to school wasn&#39;t a reflection on &quot;home&quot; or &quot;me.&quot;  <br/>
So, some kids to choose to go to school and are happy there.  My <br/>
daugher has decided that it is worth it to put up with the inevitable <br/>
frustrations.  Her life, her choices.</div>

&gt; deciding to give school a try this year, if I can still consider<br/>
&gt; myself an unschooler??  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been through that and I still felt like an unschooler.  The key <br/>
for me was supporting my children, not supporting the school system.  <br/>
We talked about the rules at school and consequences of not following <br/>
them.  I always let my children make the choices though.  I helped <br/>
them see things from many angles.  <br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter went to public school for all of 3rd grade.  I <br/>
was sure she&#39;d tire of it after a few months and want to come back <br/>
home.  I was really surprised that she stayed all year.  She even <br/>
chose to go back for 4th grade.  After one month of 4th grade, Allie <br/>
decided school wasn&#39;t meeting her needs anymore and she came back <br/>
home.  <br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter has always been in school.  Her father and I are <br/>
divorced which adds an element of challenge to parenting.  She&#39;s <br/>
lived with me for the past 2 years, attending the local public high <br/>
school.  My parenting style is so very different from her dad&#39;s and <br/>
so her school experience has been different.  I give her complete <br/>
freedom to make choices.  Her dad would manipulate her into doing <br/>
things he felt was best for her.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; But I don&#39;t want to be negative about their choices.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s hard not to be negative if your personal experiences have been <br/>
negative.  But remember that you are likely raising your children <br/>
differently than you were raised.  They are approaching all things <br/>
with a different attitude than you likely did.  Their experience at <br/>
school might just be like any other experience such as taking a <br/>
class, joining a club, or just trying something new.  The other kids <br/>
at school have no choice to be there.  Your children do have a <br/>
choice.  My children always knew when they were in school that they <br/>
could leave at any time.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Now my concern, worry, apprehension (I don&#39;t even know what I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; feeling) is... what if she does like it??  Do some kids go to<br/>
&gt; school by choice and actually enjoy being there?  Will she<br/>
&gt; eventually realize what a waste of time it is?? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Been there, done that.  I had to remove myself from their <br/>
experience.  I think my kids know when something is a waste of time.  <br/>
Until they feel that way though, it&#39;s not a waste.  It&#39;s an <br/>
experience just like anything else they may try.  My feelings were <br/>
actually hurt when Allie didn&#39;t want to quit 3rd grade.  I really <br/>
couldn&#39;t understand what she was getting from being at school.  But <br/>
then again, I&#39;m not walking in her shoes.  As long as things were <br/>
working out for her and she was feeling good, that meant things were <br/>
going well.  She did reach a point where she felt school was no <br/>
longer meeting her needs.  But she also freely admits that she may <br/>
not be finished with school.  She knows she doesn&#39;t want to go this <br/>
year which would be her 5th grade year, but she has an interest in <br/>
trying middle school and high school.  We just take it one year at a <br/>
time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549967560"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; There is unschooling that barely cuts it and unschooling that  <br/>
&gt; transforms families.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I guess I do see that.  It&#39;s taken me longer than I imagined to <br/>
come to terms with unschooling and now that I&#39;m not struggling uphill <br/>
with it anymore, I guess I&#39;m starting to see things differently.  When <br/>
I first learned about unschooling, I was stuck on the academics part.  <br/>
I knew I didn&#39;t like formal learning and wanted help letting that go.  <br/>
I remember thinking how difficult that was while going through it, but <br/>
in hindsight that was much easier than learning to trust my children in <br/>
all other areas beyond academics.  It was a natural progression for me <br/>
that if I trusted my children in some areas, why shouldn&#39;t I be <br/>
trusting them in all areas?  I kept hearing all the voices spoken to me <br/>
over the years about how children need to be guided and taught how to <br/>
do everything because they were incapable of doing anything on their <br/>
own that didn&#39;t personally benefit them.  Heck, I still hear those <br/>
voices from family members who just don&#39;t understand the way I <br/>
understand.  <br/>

<br/>
I know I&#39;ve mentioned this elsewhere, but I feel the need to brag<br/>
apparently.;)<br/>

Kevin is my nephew! I remember when he was very tiny and my sister was<br/>
feeling a lot of pressure from the family to send him to school. I<br/>
talked her into homeschooling him for kindergarten, much to the dismay<br/>
of several family members! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423855224"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If a parent&#39;s aversion to school is the only reason for unschooling,  <br/>
&gt; that&#39;s less solid than if the parent untangles her own hurts and  <br/>
&gt; fears and sees natural learning as a positive thing, not just the  <br/>
&gt; avoidance of a 20-year-old spectre in the mom.   <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree with that.  I was interpreting O.P&#39;s statement differently.  A negative attitude <br/>
might come from hurts and fears, or it might have come from a genuine belief that natural <br/>
learning is better than a school situation.  The &quot;negative&quot; attatched to that might be <br/>
coming from the fact that now her kids want to do the school thing, which is in conflict <br/>
with what mom might think is best.  So it might just be a negative because it&#39;s not in <br/>
agreement, and for some women not being aligned in agreement can feel negative for it&#39;s <br/>
own sake.<br/>
<br/>
If mom works hard to change her mind about something just to be in agreement and <br/>
create harmony, even though it&#39;s not what she really thinks, I thought that would be <br/>
insincere, and I thought there might be other ways to approach it that could also create <br/>
harmony.<br/>
<br/>
It still, for me, comes back to mom looking into where her attitudes are coming from, and <br/>
then finding ways to have harmony that allow everyone space to think and feel what is real <br/>
for them. <br/>

<br/>
Okay. I understand your statement, then.   I had assumed it was  <br/>
school negativity behind the fears.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But in any case, if a child has no choice to be at home, or at  <br/>
school, it&#39;s different from having a choice!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Well okay, then, I guessed wrong. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly seriously considered school.  She used to ask me to drive her  <br/>
to the Middle School in our district and park with a good view of the  <br/>
door just before they let out.  She would watch all the kids come  <br/>
out.  A couple of them she knew.  One day she sat on a bench when  <br/>
Cameron Lovejoy was in town.  We went to the house for me to go to  <br/>
the bathroom or some such (less than a mile away) and came and parked  <br/>
and waited for her to be through sitting and being surrounded by  <br/>
schoolkids.<br/>
<br/>
She was fascinated by the backpacks and the books and the  <br/>
interactions, and how tired or excited they seemed to be--outfits and  <br/>
emotions.  Her regular interests. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do remember at the time that my biggest concern was that if she  <br/>
wanted to go, her handwriting would be a problem.  Not reading or  <br/>
understanding or math, but she had no cursive and her printing was slow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s much nicer now.  (She&#39;s sixteen and would have been in 10th  <br/>
grade/sophomore if she had gone this year.)<br/>

I could be wrong, but it sounds like you are bummed about &quot;losing your<br/>
little girl&quot;.   My mom went through this with me. I was 17 and in my junior<br/>
year of high school though. It was rough on me because she just wanted to<br/>
hold on and I just wanted to live my life like I had been living it (I had<br/>
tons of freedom and independence as a child/young adult).<br/>
<br/>
I know this is hard in the moment, but 10 years later my mom and I are still<br/>
really close. Our relationship didn&#39;t suffer. It evolved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745418861">For us I think how the child feels about school is the key thing. DS<br/>
tried it out for a year because he&#39;d had positive experiences with<br/>
formal academic study with the Open University (UK based distance<br/>
learning, but with optional tutorials once a month or so). I think he<br/>
was hoping for something that was a cross between the tutorials &<br/>
Scouts! He&#39;s interested in physics as a career, so some sort of<br/>
academic study is going to be needed somewhere. The difference is that<br/>
its all his choice. He tells me what he wants to do & I try to help<br/>
him find ways to make that happen. We&#39;re working on a home chemistry<br/>
lab so he can do more hands on experiments. For some things we utilise<br/>
courses as a resource. <br/>
<br/>
For us the defining thing is &#39;how would I/we react if one of our<br/>
children said they didn&#39;t want to do xyz?&#39; rather than what they&#39;re<br/>
learning about. My kids learn a lot by helping me do stuff, or by<br/>
wanting to copy what I&#39;m doing, but is it any less unschooling if what<br/>
they copy is algebra rather than baking?<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;m going to stop rambling now because I need some sleep.<br/>

&gt; I think Lydia has a pretty great attitude about it. Her younger<br/>

&gt; &gt; I disagree with Joanna on this one. If people couldn&#39;t get over<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; If a parent&#39;s aversion to school is the only reason for unschooling,<br/>

&gt; &gt; thing school avoidance can be, but it is sometimes that: the mom<br/>
&gt; &gt; wants to relive her own life through her children, and she hated<br/>
&gt; &gt; school, so she will &quot;spare them&quot; from school whether they want that<br/>
&gt; &gt; or not.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the case here, it&#39;s just that that *can* be the<br/>

<br/>
This is one of those teacher fibs.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has already failed a grade (like so many poor little boys  <br/>
who are kept back in first grade), it takes a lot for them to be kept  <br/>
back a second time, and because of social considerations and legal  <br/>
liabilities, as far as I know in any state in the U.S. (I could be  <br/>
wrong, but not that I&#39;ve heard yet) there is no such thing as failing  <br/>
three grades.  They don&#39;t want to be liable for physical or sexual  <br/>
abuse by a child who is &quot;too old&quot; to be with those other children.<br/>
<br/>
Increasingly, children are passed on to special ed teachers instead  <br/>
of being kept back, if they&#39;ve ever failed once.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
(Jeez I hate writing about school...  I almost feel dirty just having  <br/>
pulled out my teacher-knowledge.)<br/>
