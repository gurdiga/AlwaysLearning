<p>Many unschooled kids connect through gaming and skype. &nbsp;I&#39;d suggest you join Unschooling Gamers - there is a facebook group and also a yahoo group of the same name, and see if you can connect with kids who like the same games as yours. (if they game).&nbsp;<br>

Wait…<br/>
I hope you’ll find online things your kids like, but back up to that “year” thing… :-)<br/>
<br/>
The more school terminology you can avoid, the better your learning environment and your understanding of living in the world without schoolishness will be.  <br/>
<br/>
Above the problem of the school imagery, “frehman year of unschooling” suggests that in four years it’s done.  But deschooling will be ongoing, and can’t begin well in anyone’s “freshman year.”  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Don&#39;t use any of these school words: semester, grade, age level, grade level, scores, subjects, school year, school hours, school day. Don&#39;t even have a school minute. And when school is gone, life will be left.”<br/>
<br/>
I’m quoting myself from this page:  <br/>
