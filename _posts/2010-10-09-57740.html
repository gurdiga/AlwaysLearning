<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872080029">On the &quot;phrases&quot; topic, we were talking &quot;only a phase,&quot; and what  <br/>
wasn&#39;t mentioned there was perspective.<br/>
<br/>
The first time I went to a La Leche League meeting, there were two  <br/>
leaders named Carol and Lori.  Carol is the one who wrote about her  <br/>
son learning to read in his tens, when the three others had learned  <br/>
much earlier.   The other was Lori Odhner.  I credit them a lot. I  <br/>
credit them in my book.  I&#39;ve arranged for Lori to come to two  <br/>
homeschooling conferences where I was also speaking, to do workshops.<br/>
<br/>
Lori does an interesting marriage counselling ministry for her church  <br/>
(The New Church, it&#39;s called) and I&#39;ve been following it more closely  <br/>
because I&#39;m speaking at a marriage conference she runs every year, and  <br/>
I want to be up to speed so I don&#39;t say something offensive to their  <br/>
religion. So I&#39;ve been reading on their site, I ordered a book, and  <br/>
I&#39;m getting her daily e-mailing, &quot;Marriage Moats.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lori is a great writer.  She wrote articles for La Leche League  <br/>
magazines and newsletters and sites.  She has written beautiful  <br/>
songs.   Today she sent this. Benjamin is Down syndrome.  She has nine  <br/>
children now, but when I met her she had four, and when she had  <br/>
Benjamin she was in the middle of that series.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes scary things feel big and long.<br/>
<br/>
I know the eleven days I spent with my baby in the hospital when he  <br/>
was five months old with severe failure to thrive felt like eons. I  <br/>
forgot what sunshine felt like, and was shocked to blink in it again  <br/>
when we went outside to go to another building for an MRI.<br/>
<br/>
Then they actually let me take Benjamin home. I panicked. Life was a  <br/>
blur of caring for him, and I had no idea what my other six children  <br/>
wore or ate for those eleven days. All I remembered was holding  <br/>
Benjamin, nursing him, feeding him whole mashed avocados, taking  <br/>
copious notes, and praying.<br/>
<br/>
Gradually I began to calm down a notch. In fact there was a quilt  <br/>
meeting that I wanted to go to, which felt incredibly selfish to even  <br/>
consider. Yet, if I took all his medical equipment, just in case, and  <br/>
stayed only an hour, perhaps I could risk it.<br/>
<br/>
I gathered him up and started the drive along the Pasadena Freeway.  <br/>
Looking behind me to check on him every twelve seconds was reducing  <br/>
the quality of my driving, but I was nervous. Then the little voice  <br/>
inside me, the one I tell people they should listen to, said, &quot;Go on  <br/>
the side streets.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What? That was ridiculous. The freeway is faster and... and...<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Go on the side streets.&quot; it repeated.<br/>
<br/>
Reluctantly I steered toward the off ramp and started up California  <br/>
Boulevard. This blue blooded street is lined with fifty foot palm  <br/>
trees. The car&#39;s speed decelerated. My heart rate slowed down. On my  <br/>
right was a hospital where I brought flowers to a baby who later died.  <br/>
At least my child is alive, I thought. Then I passed the rehab center  <br/>
where I had visited a teenager who swallowed a bunch of pills. At  <br/>
least I am not facing that.<br/>
<br/>
Then my car went over a bump, and in that instant my voice said, &quot;This  <br/>
is a bump.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was outraged. How dare anyone suggest that this huge ordeal was only  <br/>
a bump. Harrumph.<br/>
<br/>
I arrived at the quilt store, and overheard the other ladies kvetching  <br/>
about the traffic on the freeway. Maybe that voice knew more than me  <br/>
after all.<br/>
<br/>
Twelve years later, it does look like a bump, if only because the  <br/>
bumps have gotten bigger. I am not suggesting that it was easy. It was  <br/>
the on ramp to life with a special needs child that still leaves me  <br/>
scanning for the exit.<br/>
<br/>
But it has also been the road that John and I have traveled together,  <br/>
taking turns driving, sometimes playful enough to turn on the music  <br/>
and sing.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115460931">Someone wrote this, and yes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-That article Lori wrote was so lovely. I could feel my shoulders  <br/>
relaxing, as she turned onto California Boulevard!<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would like to read more of her writings, so could you send me a  <br/>
link to her &quot;Marriage Moats&quot; emails? Are there other places to read  <br/>
her articles?-=-<br/>

<br/>
There is a religious component of Lori&#39;s life and beliefs, but it  <br/>
might only rarely be obvious in these posts.<br/>
Click on Marriage Moats and you can subscribe.  If one ever comes that  <br/>
seems odd, you can skip it by, but most will be as the one I sent.<br/>
