Please proof that for me, anyone who entered or knows of anyone who  <br/>
entered.  If anyone had an entry they just  hadn&#39;t turned in yet, I  <br/>
don&#39;t know what I was thinking with that 26th deadline.   If yours  <br/>
was already created, send it.  If you have clever ideas but no images  <br/>
yet, save them for next year.<br/>
<br/>
Because I came across a couple of these just by looking at blogs,  <br/>
there might be others out there.  When I&#39;m pretty sure I have them  <br/>
all, I&#39;ll show them to my impartial judges (and my family, and anyone  <br/>
else who comes by, and if any of you want to slip me an opinion on  <br/>
the side, that couldn&#39;t hurt).<br/>

state, along with a portfolio review of activities and such...how ever <br/>
we are being asked for a transcript for something now and a portfolio <br/>
or description letter wll not suffice they say!  I did put one together <br/>
when my daughter applied to the PSEOP program which allows highschool <br/>
level students the opportunity to take college classes paid for by the <br/>
school system...I&#39;m just trying to find the best way to go for us  <br/>

Each of my sons tested into Developmental Math (&quot;remediation&quot;, not<br/>
transferable as college credit) when they enrolled in community college.  At<br/>
the school they attended there are several levels before &quot;College Algebra&quot;<br/>
which is the first transferable college course.  The classes were indeed<br/>
filled with kids who had attended school for 13 years...........including<br/>
some with high school diplomas and transcripts listing them as &quot;honors&quot;<br/>
graduates.<br/>
<br/>
My older son moved up a level just a couple of  meetings in by doing a class<br/>
placement test rather the college placement test.  There were a few weeks of<br/>
struggling to &quot;learn the language&quot; but he finished that course and<br/>
subsequent courses at the top of the remaining students (the class size<br/>
diminishes pretty fast in some of these courses).  I don&#39;t remember the<br/>
exact course, but it was pretty early in the &quot;real&quot; college level courses<br/>
that he &quot;came out&quot; when a prof asked where he had gone to high school since<br/>
he seemed to have such a great foundation :-).   I believe it is because he<br/>
did not have to &quot;unlearn&quot; a lot of confused concepts.    He moved on to<br/>
higher math, transferring to University in the mathematics department and<br/>
then securing a very coveted and competitive slot in the computer science<br/>
department which is what his Bachelor&#39;s Degree is in.<br/>
<br/>
Next son  &quot;dual-enrolled&quot; in community college so he was able to &quot;count&quot; the<br/>
Developmental Courses   on a high school transcript, just not transferable<br/>
to University.    He had similar experiences as far as finishing each course<br/>
with an &quot;A&quot; (including when he moved on to College Algebra, Trig, Calculus)<br/>
but, to his brother&#39;s chagrin, decided that it was not necessary to continue<br/>
to have &quot;at least&quot; ONE math course each semester &quot;for fun&quot; forever and<br/>
ever.  His tastes ran more to laboratory science courses.   However, the<br/>
last few semesters at community college  he was hired as a math tutor in the<br/>
community college Learning Lab.........a position usually reserved for upper<br/>
level University students or University graduates.   He actually earned an<br/>
Associate&#39;s Degree (and had to decide whether to list Chemistry, Biology, or<br/>
Mathematics as the &quot;major&quot;) before he transferred to a University to earn<br/>
his Bachelors Degree.<br/>
<br/>
The point is that without any formal structured Mathematics classes before<br/>
entering community college, both were able to &quot;catch up&quot; to &quot;graduates&quot; of<br/>
13+ years in less than a year.<br/>
