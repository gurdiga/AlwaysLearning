 </span></blockquote>Kirby used to come home after whatever he was doing was over.  He&#39;d  <br/>
be out late for anime meetings (which met after the shop closed at  <br/>
midnight), role-playing games or CCG sessions, or movies.  Sometimes  <br/>
they would go eat afterwards.<br/>

I wouldn&#39;t replace curfews with &quot;You must tell me where you are and  <br/>
where you&#39;re going and who you&#39;re with!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not how it works.<br/>
<br/>
Our entire relationship is so NOT adversarial, so not based on  <br/>
control or power, that it is hard to even relate how it does work.<br/>
<br/>
I have never told me kids that they have to tell me where they are or  <br/>
who they&#39;re with. But they do. And I ask them without even thinking  <br/>
of it as  And they tell me if they&#39;re going to be late (Roxana,  <br/>
especially, is often out very late.)<br/>
<br/>
I guess my answer, to someone with very young children, is to not  <br/>
even think about it now - just build relationships based on mutual  <br/>
respect and trust and assumptions that the kids want to be in loving  <br/>
relationships with their family. What your teenagers will be like is  <br/>
a direct result of how you behave when they are young.<br/>

<br/>
Not necessarily.  What I think is key is looking at your concerns from <br/>
a reality based perspective which may vary from child to child and from <br/>
setting to setting.  Then talking to your kids just like you would a <br/>
friend and trying to find a way that you can all be happy.<br/>
<br/>
My 15yo comes and goes as she pleases.  She is extremely responsible <br/>
and while some of the stuff she does isn&#39;t stuff that I would choose to <br/>
do, she makes carefully thought out decisions.<br/>
<br/>
My 12yo is someone that I keep closer tabs on.  I don&#39;t tell him when <br/>
to come home but he is MUCH more likely to make impulsive decisions <br/>
that everyone involved regrets later.  He functions much more <br/>
responsibly when hanging out with &quot;straight arrow&quot; kinds of kids.  I <br/>
dont&#39; forbid him to hang out with questionable kids usually (although I <br/>
did finally put the kabash on a neighborhood kid that kept our entire <br/>
family upset and fighting due to issues of appropriate behavior on the <br/>
father&#39;s part).  But I do find myself going farther out of my way to <br/>
get him and the &quot;straight arrow&quot; kids together when they ask.  I check <br/>
in with him more, I call him to see if he wants me to drop off a pizza, <br/>
etc..<br/>
<br/>
I try hard to remember that I did a bunch of stupid stuff that could <br/>
have really gotten me hurt as a teen and much of it was before 11am, <br/>
forget 11pm.<br/>

  First off, do you *have* a 13 year old who is out and about after <br/>
11:00??? Is s/he out with people you don&#39;t approve of? In places you <br/>
don&#39;t approve of? Why?<br/>
<br/>
  To me it&#39;s the whole package. I can&#39;t imagine my 13 year old wanting <br/>
to be out that late---and where would he be?<br/>
<br/>
  Yes, it would matter where he was and whom he was with---but also <br/>
*why* he would want/need to be out that late.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m thinking back to when Cameron was 13. he had no reason to be out <br/>
that late---nor anyway to get there or get back home. Unless I was the <br/>
chauffeur (and then I&#39;d know where and when and who). It simply wasn&#39;t <br/>
an issue.<br/>
<br/>
  It became an issue at 16 when he had a car and a license that allowed <br/>
him out past dark. But not an ISSUE issue. We always knew where he was <br/>
and with whom. He has a cell phone. And he&#39;s not afraid to tell us <br/>
where he is/what he&#39;s doing.<br/>
<br/>
  If I were to &quot;disapprove&quot;---well, I&#39;d tell him. We&#39;d talk. We&#39;d try to <br/>
find a better way for him to get what he&#39;s looking for. But with an <br/>
open and trusting relationship, this hasn&#39;t been a problem.<br/>
