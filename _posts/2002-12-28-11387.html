<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030855811">I got a ukulele for Christmas.  It&#39;s the first instrument I&#39;ve ever owned, <br/>
though I took piano and french horn when I was 9 or 10.  I can already play 5 <br/>
or 6 songs and I am having a blast in my ignorant bliss.  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I was looking around the internet for ukulele songs and I came across <br/>
this link farm about ballads.  I thought some of you (Sandra) might be <br/>
interested.  It seems quite extensive.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I found a lot of sites about ukulele, but a lot of the songs have too many <br/>
chords for me right now (and I don&#39;t know the tunes).  I also found a site <br/>
with freeware that will write any song for uke and print the chord charts <br/>
with the lyrics.  Now I just need to learn a little about transposing so I <br/>
can feed in some of the Camp Fire songs I want to play.  I haven&#39;t googled <br/>
transposing, but I will.  <br/>
<br/>
How do you determine which key is best for your own voice?  My ukulele can be <br/>
tuned in G or C.  Some of the songs get too high for me in C.  Is it okay to <br/>
lower my voice an octave so I can sing in my range?  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to sound like an idiot.  I&#39;m basically an ignoramus when it <br/>
comes to music, but I&#39;m learning!!<br/>

<br/>
Sure it&#39;s okay to sing an octave up or down.  But by &quot;tuned in G or C,&quot; if <br/>
you mean different notes on different strings (and thereby different <br/>
fingerings, like the difference between standard guitar tuning and &quot;open <br/>
tuning&quot;) that won&#39;t change the vocal range.  <br/>
<br/>
Ukeleles are already so small and thumpy I don&#39;t guess a capo would make it <br/>
sound much thumpier.  But maybe it&#39;s not cool to use a capo on a ukelele.    <br/>
But if there is any such thing as using a capo, what that does is raise the <br/>
range of the ukelele up a step or two.   (Probably it&#39;s not done.)<br/>
<br/>
If by &quot;tuned in G or C&quot; you really meant you can play songs in the key of G <br/>
or the key of C (not having anything to do with what notes the strings are <br/>
tuned to) GOOD!  Depending on the range of each song (which you don&#39;t have to <br/>
understand, just goof around with), you can use one key or the other.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll look at that site after a while.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Mine is a soprano, the most popular kind.  Tuned in the key of G the notes of <br/>
the strings are GCEA.  Tuned in C they are ADF#B.  (Other kinds of ukes are <br/>
tuned in different keys.)  The fingering doesn&#39;t change with the key.  But I <br/>
would have to be damn good to play a G-tuned uke in the key of C.  (I think!) <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So the software I have that will take in a guitar song (for instance) and <br/>
spit out a uke song allows for transposing.  It does it by entering a value <br/>
of -4 to 4.  From what little I know about music, that probably means that +1 <br/>
means one key up?  <br/>
<br/>
I do know if I don&#39;t do it right, it comes out with a lot of flats and minors <br/>
and diminished notes that take all 4 fingers in odd positions to play!  Does <br/>
anyone know if there&#39;s a general guideline or rule of thumb about <br/>
transposing?<br/>
<br/>
Charles is sitting over there learning Oh Susanna on harmonica, so I guess <br/>
we&#39;ll have a duet pretty soon!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
