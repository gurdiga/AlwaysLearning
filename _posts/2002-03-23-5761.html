<div id="ygrps-yiv-419559472">I chose to start a business from home after having my first one.... DH<br/>
decided to quit a full time employed job to go contracting so he could work<br/>
as many hours as he could around our children...  DH is gradually quitting<br/>
his job and working with me in my business so that we can both be with the<br/>
kids on and off all day and get to go on trips with them....  All the while<br/>
being unschooled and doing things they enjoy... Personally I cannot imagine<br/>
a better lifestyle where we get to decide what we do and when we do it...<br/>
Having our life the way it is, is part of living an unschooled life.<br/>
