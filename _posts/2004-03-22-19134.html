&lt;&lt; I just hate it that some people doubt us and only believe the <br/>
professionals.  As far as I am concerned we are the professionals as far us our children <br/>
are concerned. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That truism always sounds good until you consider the parents whose <br/>
&quot;professional&quot; opinion is that their children need more discipline, that their children <br/>
are lazy and that their babies are trying to manipulate them by crying.<br/>
<br/>
Some parents are NOT professionals about children.  They&#39;re not even <br/>
respectable amateurs.<br/>
<br/>
If parents knew all they needed to know just because their sperm moved to a <br/>
receptive egg or because they carried a baby to term, lists like this wouldn&#39;t <br/>
be needed at all.  Child development studies wouldn&#39;t be needed.  <br/>
<br/>
So yes, as a &quot;there, there&quot; soothing moment telling someone &quot;you know your <br/>
own child&quot; can be good, but lots of people don&#39;t know their own children very <br/>
well at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think maybe it&#39;s directly connectable to Howard Gardner&#39;s Multiple <br/>
Intelligences.  Some people are not good at self-knowing (intrapersonal intelligence) <br/>
or at knowing others (interpersonal) and yet they have children too.  Some are <br/>
QUITE good at it, totally facile and smooth with understanding their <br/>
children, with being empathetic and respectful, and it hasn&#39;t occurred to them that <br/>
some other parents have little natural ability in that area.<br/>

You bring up a great point Sandra.  I realized during the past week that I was biased and also had many preconceived notions about the parent devoted to homeschooling.  I had presumed that they were intelligent, kind, devoted and understanding people.  I found out last week that this is not always true.  One mother on a homeschooling group is quite mentally ill and was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  I had  strong feelings about this situation. Probably because my preconceived notions were being shattered and I wanted to hold onto my illusions.  I feel my eggshell has cracked although I ended up pursuing a healthier network of people and found this site.  All for the best.  Thanks for the reality reminder.<br/>

A person can be quite seriously mentally ill and still be intelligent, <br/>
kind and devoted. They can still love and cherish their kids and want <br/>
the best for them. They can still be generous and loving.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The opposite is true as well. A person can be quite mentally sound and be <br/>
cruel and inhuman.  She can shame and strike her kids and not really care what <br/>
happens to them.<br/>

Sorry if I did not make my self clear,  I was talking about AP parents.  I am well aware of the the lack of connection that lots of parents have and it saddens me to see it.  <br/>
