<div id="ygrps-yiv-799794755">Today, I listened to a blog radio interview from the Unschoolers  <br/>
Winter Waterpark Gathering.  The interviewee was Ruth Radney, from  <br/>
Ohio.  I&#39;ve not heard of her before, but no matter.  In the interview  <br/>
a caller asked her what the difference was between homeschooling and  <br/>
unschooling.  Her answer was lengthy, but the gist of it was...<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a way of homeschooling.<br/>
Every family/child/child&#39;s learning is different.<br/>
Some like textbooks, to spend their time at the kitchen table or at  <br/>
little desks, prefer mixing textbooks with more relaxed time, online  <br/>
curriculum.<br/>
There are as many different ways to homeschool as there are families.<br/>
The only things she said about unschooling was, &quot;Unschooling is just  <br/>
in some ways more relaxed but also I think just as labor intensive as  <br/>
far as parental involvement providing opportunities for learning.   <br/>
Just a different approach with maybe fewer textbooks.  There are some  <br/>
unschoolers who prefer textbooks so that the children can choose what  <br/>
works best for them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Her answer didn&#39;t give me much of a difference between homeschooling  <br/>
and unschooling.  From this, I can see where some people give their  <br/>
kids breaks from the kitchen table or textbooks and say that they  <br/>
unschool, and thus misconceptions about unschooling, I think.<br/>
<br/>
There were some cute stories of kids making connections, and parents  <br/>
helping their kids with their interests, and one of a kid saying, no  <br/>
mom, I don&#39;t want any more lessons, I want to poke around on the  <br/>
piano how I&#39;m doing it.  It definitely wasn&#39;t radical unschooling,  <br/>
the interviewee suggested limiting time if your kids spend too much  <br/>
time doing something and lose track of time.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have to wonder what she means by limiting time because they loose track of time . Force them to stop because itsÂ  :eyeball roll: surely an addiction? Make them stop for a while because something else has to be done? <br/>
<br/>
I had to limit Court&#39;s time on WOW today because we had to go pick up her brother from school. We just moved and I don&#39;t know any neighbors yet that i could call to check on her or she could go running to if there was a problem . Its a good 15 minute drive to the school so if she were to call me I couldn&#39;t just dash home so I just dont feel ok leaving a 9 year old home alone in the current situation. <br/>
<br/>
Knowing she hates transition ...what kid dosent when they have to stop doing something they love ?...I made it as pleasant as possible for her. I gave her a few warnings ... 30 minutes left ..ok you are down to 5 and need to get where you can log out ...and asked if she wanted me to grab anything for her to take like her ipod. <br/>
<br/>
I see sometimes having to limit time on something as a necessary part of being part of a family. <br/>
