 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not an *other world spirit* channeler, though it sometimes helps to *put<br/>
on* Sandra or Joyce or Robyn or Ren and BE that mama for a moment, just to<br/>
see how their perspective is different than the one I feel *stuck* in.<br/>
Practicing as someone else helps me tailor the situation to diana, the ideal<br/>
diana in-the-moment.<br/>
<br/>
Visualizing is really important to Hayden (and the technique&#39;s been around<br/>
for far longer than the Hicks), who would take swim classes for two sessions<br/>
as a toddler -- the first to watch and the second to participate. Not<br/>
everything can be set up that way, however, some events are a one time only<br/>
situation. It helps to give him as much information as possible and for him<br/>
to *see* himself in his head having a good time. I.E. the Bender party we<br/>
attended last Sunday. When he practiced seeing what was possible, he came to<br/>
the party with a very different attitude &quot;This will be fun!&quot; than the one of<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m afraid I may not have a good time&quot; -- which thought would you rather<br/>
hang out with??<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I very much prefer thinking and doing to buck-passing and wishing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Dealing directly and sweetly with one&#39;s children does not require<br/>
&gt; consultation with departed &quot;sages&quot; nor does it need to involve<br/>
&gt; visualizing get-rich schemes or recommending that kids run away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling does require a new pattern of thought for the most of us. I for<br/>
one, accept lessons of wisdom where ever they may appear in my life (even on<br/>
the days I&#39;m actively NOT Lois from Malcom in the Middle) . I do *think* far<br/>
more than I *wish* :) and thinking positive, supportive and supporting<br/>
thoughts bring me closer to those who think the same way. If I was grumpy<br/>
and mean, I&#39;d have lots of grumpy and mean folks surrounding me, telling me<br/>
what a great job I&#39;m doing. Not who I want to *attract* with my thinking<br/>
process.<br/>
Thinking thoughts of constant overwhelm seems to bring about examples of why<br/>
I should be in constant overwhelm. When I want to be filled with thoughts of<br/>
*Abundance* and *Possibility* and I make my own internal shift, viola! I am<br/>
brought support for that way of thinking.<br/>
Call it magic, call it juju, call it the universe... thoughts attract<br/>
thoughts. I want my thoughts to be consciously in line with my end goal<br/>
(actively LIVING a joyful and peaceful life) and to *attract* others who<br/>
want the same things.<br/>
You&#39;re here, in my vortex, so something musta worked ::::vbeg::::<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This one bugged me:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;When a child has a dream and a parent says, &#39;It&#39;s not financially<br/>
&gt; feasible; you can&#39;t make a living at that; don&#39;t do it,&#39; we say to<br/>
&gt; the child, run away from home...<br/>
&gt; You must follow your dream.<br/>
&gt; You will never be joyful if you don&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; Your dream may change, but you&#39;ve got to stay after your dreams.<br/>
&gt; You have to.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Abraham, channeled via Esther Hicks<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ======================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe you misunderstood? The message to me, from the above quote, is a<br/>
parent who quashes a child&#39;s dream is not partnering with their child; in<br/>
fact, they are showing their own lack of support for the dream, thereby<br/>
causing the child to look elsewhere for support. Dreams and joy are<br/>
important *in every moment* -this is another reminder to hold those dreams<br/>
of children as the sacred gift they are. Our attitudes may not be so openly<br/>
spoken, the message is received just the same by our children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And when I went to see who Esther Hicks was, it reminded me that<br/>
&gt; someone told me there&#39;s a new &quot;radical unschooling&quot; list (and I call<br/>
&gt; it that because it is <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:radicalunschooling@yahoogroups.com">radicalunschooling@yahoogroups.com</a>) that, once<br/>
&gt; you go to the description says:  &quot;This is a discussion and support<br/>
&gt; group for Radical or Whole Life Unschoolers. This group is unique in<br/>
&gt; that we will have a focus on using the Law of Attraction in our<br/>
&gt; Unschooling lives. This is a progressive, revolutionary approach to<br/>
&gt; parenting that we are honored to be pioneering! &quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &quot;Pioneering&quot; the combination of that with &quot;the Law of Attraction&quot;<br/>
&gt; *maybe* (OR NOT, if the ReThinking Education conference wants to<br/>
&gt; claim that, as that&#39;s where the Esther Hicks quote recommending that<br/>
&gt; children with impractical ideas run away came from, but not<br/>
&gt; pioneering unschooling, nor radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pioneering the *discussion,* providing space for the conversation and the<br/>
shifts in perspective to occur.<br/>
Believe me, there&#39;s no one there believing they pioneered anything but their<br/>
own perceptions.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Is it necessary for me to explicitly state that I neither advocate<br/>
&gt; nor believe in the channeling of anyone or anything?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Nope :)  And we already see the benefits of changing one&#39;s perspective<br/>
(unloading the straw) with your help -- the RU list gives that kind of<br/>
thinking a different place to have this discussion, that&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
Will &quot;Radical Unschooling&quot; be painted with the crazy brush?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Too late, they already let me in the club :D<br/>
<br/>
Yes of course, curiosity leads to more curiosity and peace leads to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; more peace.  Respect leads to  more respect.  This has been being<br/>
&gt; said and explained and expanded and expounded on by people on this<br/>
&gt; list and others similar for YEARS, very  many more years than some<br/>
&gt; people have been parents at all.   Does it seem that when people<br/>
&gt; start talking about the law of attraction they&#39;re also asking for<br/>
&gt; money?  And that people want cash when they channel spirits or teams<br/>
&gt; of spirits (this &quot;Abraham&quot; isn&#39;t the Abraham most people think of,<br/>
&gt; it&#39;s some otherworldly committee who seem to have summarized some<br/>
&gt; cool Hindu and Buddhist ideas, summarized the Best of the<br/>
&gt; Rosicrucians, and is being marketed as something new).  Marketed is<br/>
&gt; the main part.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All of this information is available for free, as well. At my local library,<br/>
on line -- even at Oprah.com (Eckhart Tolle)-- and in gatherings of folks at<br/>
our local coffee shop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here is a WHOLE LOT of free information, better, purer, and it<br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t put any juju between you and your child:<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; If you live in juju, it will affect your hour, your day and your<br/>
&gt; lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you live in *stuck* it will affect....<br/>
If you live in *I CAN&#39;T* it will affect...<br/>
If you live in *too much* it will affect...<br/>
If you live in *last straw* it will affect...<br/>
<br/>
changing our thought patterns is required to bring in new thought patterns,<br/>
thoughts that better serve who we are and where we&#39;re going and what we&#39;re<br/>
doing in this very moment, right now.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Every moment spent hoping for magical benefits could be spent gently<br/>
&gt; and directly in contact with your children getting REAL benefits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Every moment believing in the best of our kids, is a moment spent gently and<br/>
directly in contact with children, getting REAL benefits.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Visualization is all of those things, in one&#39;s head :) I tend to think of it<br/>
as *seeing what&#39;s possible* before it happens. If I can *see* myself<br/>
handling the stress-filled moments, before they occur, with love, compassion<br/>
and thoughtfulness, it feels like *rehearsal* for those real moments when<br/>
knee-jerk may have been easy to fall back upon.<br/>
In the movie &quot;The Secret&quot; (mainstream introduction to LoA) when they talk of<br/>
visualization, I don&#39;t equate it to day-dreams or wishing or hoping... it&#39;s<br/>
the first step to opening yourself up to *Possibilities* -- if you can&#39;t see<br/>
yourself actually driving your dream car, how can you see the steps required<br/>
to make it happen?<br/>
I&#39;m the first to say &quot;Wish in one hand and $hit in the other -- see which<br/>
fills first&quot; -- this idea is far deeper than that, for me to even want to<br/>
explore it ;)<br/>
For us, right now, we&#39;re open to owning a dog for the first time. We (Scotty<br/>
& I) were filled to the brim with fear and still find it far more<br/>
comfortable to live in *it&#39;s impossible* to own a dog; when we look at<br/>
Hayden, however, we know there&#39;s got to be another perspective that will<br/>
fulfill this boy&#39;s Doggie Dream. (Hayden is WAY more important than our<br/>
fears!!) We packed up our thoughts and moved over to *what&#39;s possible* which<br/>
has opened our eyes to a multitude of ways that, indeed, we can be Calm<br/>
Assertive Pack Leaders -- yes, we&#39;ve watched The Dog Whisperer every day for<br/>
weeks!! I often practice, in my mind, going through the different principles<br/>
Cesar laid out for us. I see myself meeting our new dog, introducing myself<br/>
as a Calm Assertive Energy so the dog immediately recognizes me as Leader. I<br/>
want the principles to be firmly ingrained in me BEFORE we even meet our<br/>
potential dog-mate. (We don&#39;t know many local owners of &quot;balanced&quot; dogs, so<br/>
the opportunity to practice on real dogs is limited -- except the other<br/>
night when Hayden had a great experience with a pack, details on my blog)<br/>
It&#39;s another *aid* in unclogging our vision. Not the only, though an<br/>
incredibly helpful one.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-523480796">Visualization, for me, is different to observing. It&#39;s the creation<br/>
inside my head of a &#39;desired outcome&#39;. <br/>
<br/>
However, in my view at least, it really is no more than using ordinary<br/>
everyday imagination but in a deliberate self-directed way. It&#39;s the<br/>
outcome oriented purposefulness of &#39;visualization&#39; that I think<br/>
differentiates it from imagining, observing, watching, thinking<br/>
generally that also produces pictures in our heads. So perhaps I would<br/>
say that it&#39;s a thinking technique of a specific kind.<br/>

weight-loss journey. From the WeightWatchers website:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mental Rehearsing is practicing in your mind ahead of time, being in  <br/>
a challenging situation. Our minds and bodies are one system, so your  <br/>
mind can help you behave or act a certain way.<br/>
<br/>
Athletes, actors, musicians, artists, public speakers and salesman use  <br/>
mental rehearsing all the time. In fact, you probably do too, when you  <br/>
think about and rehearse what you&#39;ll say before making a tough phone  <br/>
call, or having a difficult discussion&quot;<br/>
