<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836240089">This is off topic, except for being about me, and learning, and connections.<br/>
<br/>
I was interviewed for a long podcast that was Not About UNSCHOOLING!  <br/>
That’s pretty exciting for me.  <br/>
<br/>
I’m not usually competitive, in my life, but I would like to invite people here to listen to it.   Some of you will be interested because you know me.  Some might just be curious to hear my voice and some stories about things that aren’t about my kids.  <br/>
<br/>
The competitive part is that this is a newish podcast.  This is episode 8.   I would like to be on there another time or two, and if a lot of people listen, I’ll be more likely to be invited again. <br/>
<br/>
ALSO… more practical for here, hearing my voice might help with the reading of posts from me here.  Seriously.  I write as I speak.<br/>
<br/>
I’m partly sorry for bringing a link that’s not about unschooling, but partly it might spark some memories and story telling and connections, and that’s all about learning.<br/>
<br/>
Some topics, in stories from the 1960’s:  David Bowie, Simon & Garfunkel, Donovan, and lots of side stories<br/>
<br/>
Even if you turn it on and don’t listen, it will up the count.  I think you might like it enough to listen, though.<br/>
