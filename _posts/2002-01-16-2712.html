<br/>
No, I didn&#39;t mean to suggest it was.  <br/>
<br/>
I have an e-mail pal named Wolfgang Marquardt (we&#39;ve met in person after <br/>
establishing our friendship online) who was born the same date and year as I <br/>
was, in northern Germany, and we&#39;ve shared our life stories.  His two kids <br/>
are 20ish, a boy and girl,  and they were raised pretty sweetly!!  But he&#39;s <br/>
been to my house twice and hung out with the kids and said he wished they had <br/>
been nicer with their kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I should ask him, now that he&#39;s living in Seattle, and has lived in Plano, <br/>
Texas (what a place for a German to learn America, huh??  &lt;bwg&gt;) how he sees <br/>
American childrearing.   His wife (recently ex wife) is a neo-natal care <br/>
nurse and so he would know stories about breastfeeding.<br/>

raised without any kindness. This is why he lft home and joined the<br/>
army. Just in time for World War 2. Whoops.<br/>
I have the disctinction of a father and grandfather who were on<br/>
different sides and probably faced each other at Dunkirk.<br/>
When my father came to England after the war he was astounded at the way<br/>
the english raised their kids. Nazi Germany made an effort to remove<br/>
kids from their parents with schools and then Jungvolk and Hitler Youth.<br/>
It was compulsory. Mnd you, they did get plenty of fresh air :)<br/>

old neighbor home as an au pair. She was an incredible caregiver---she adored <br/>
Cameron and was MORE than indulgent. But she INSISTED that he get 2 hours of <br/>
fresh air every day! Rain, snow, sleet, sun, whatever---just bundle him up <br/>
and go to the park or downtown to walk main street. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772672043">Okay, I have a report from a German born 7/24/53 who raised two kids who are <br/>
just lately grown.  Don&#39;t feel bad that I corrected his English once--our <br/>
original deal was I would help him with English because he wanted to get <br/>
fluent enough to move here.  He gets grumpy when I don&#39;t correct him.  And I <br/>
usually don&#39;t &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:  Do you have a minute?<br/>
WOLF0753:    yes<br/>
WOLF0753:    for you always<br/>
WOLF0753:    :)<br/>
SandraDodd:  It&#39;s like a business question, for me.<br/>
Germany has a bad reputation for meanness toward children (childrearing <br/>
coldness) in the 19th and early 20th century<br/>
SandraDodd:  Is it still that way?<br/>
WOLF0753:    i don&#39;t know waht it is yet<br/>
SandraDodd:  I think what I&#39;m asking is now that you&#39;ve lived in the U.S., <br/>
does it seem much different, the way people are with their children?<br/>
WOLF0753:    it is depents where you live..country or town<br/>
SandraDodd:  And how common is breastfeeding babies?  I figured you&#39;d know <br/>
because of Sabine&#39;s job.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Is it worse in the country?<br/>
WOLF0753:    country they are living very close together<br/>
WOLF0753:    and in town..they don&#39;t know the neighbor<br/>
WOLF0753:    i think the same is in the US<br/>
SandraDodd:  Which is nicer to the kids, when they DO know the neighbors or <br/>
when they don&#39;t, though?  <br/>
WOLF0753:    my brother for example has all his kids arround him in a house <br/>
living<br/>
WOLF0753:    all on his land<br/>
SandraDodd:  You mean his grown kids stayed nearby?<br/>
WOLF0753:    yes<br/>
WOLF0753:    incld his grand child<br/>
WOLF0753:    childs<br/>
WOLF0753:    all my brothres<br/>
SandraDodd:  But in the city you can&#39;t do that...<br/>
<br/>
(children)<br/>
WOLF0753:    no...there it is different<br/>
SandraDodd:  Did your wife and your sisters-in-law breastfeed their babies? <br/>
WOLF0753:    YEEES<br/>
WOLF0753:    that is different in europ<br/>
SandraDodd:  I&#39;m reading that it was VERY rare in 19th century Germany.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Good, that it&#39;s more common now.<br/>
SandraDodd:  So what about punishment, though, and just being sweet with <br/>
babies?  How was that when you were little, or with your kids?<br/>
WOLF0753:    they spend the first three years very close together, because a <br/>
study has shown breast feeting is very importand<br/>
SandraDodd:  I wish Americans cared more about studies like that!! The <br/>
government still will give moms bottles and formula.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Good for Germany!!<br/>
WOLF0753:    the study was made in the us<br/>
WOLF0753:    :)<br/>
WOLF0753:    my exwife went to a teaching class for a year to be able telling <br/>
the mother how importand it is<br/>
WOLF0753:    breast feeding<br/>
SandraDodd:  Have they cut down on spanking there too?  I hear it&#39;s totally <br/>
illegal in Sweden.<br/>
WOLF0753:    the fisrt 5 years you can rase the children and after you only <br/>
have to correct them again or remind them<br/>
WOLF0753:    i personally showed them my feelings instead of punching them<br/>
SandraDodd:  You&#39;re personally a nice guy, though! :-)<br/>
What about your neighbors?<br/>
WOLF0753:    my kids are telling me they would like to rase her kids like we <br/>
did with them<br/>
WOLF0753:    same with the neighbors<br/>
SandraDodd:  That must be good to hear from your kids!<br/>
. . . .<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:  Okay.  Thanks for the info!<br/>
SandraDodd:  Have a good day<br/>
WOLF0753:    you are always welcome<br/>
WOLF0753:    you too and say hello to your nice kids<br/>
SandraDodd:  I will!</div>

 </span></blockquote>Getting the kids outdoors everyday is emphasized in Charlotte Mason&#39;s books,<br/>
as crucial to healthy brain development.  I remember thinking that was kind<br/>
of quaint, until I realized that, in her time, all lighting and heat sources<br/>
were flame, which depleted the oxygen indoors.  People slept with open<br/>
windows in the middle of winter, too.  (Picked that factoid up from a<br/>
Dorothy L. Sayers &quot;Peter Wimsey&quot; mystery &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

I used to think the Londoners were crazy like that too, but when I was there <br/>
in the 70&#39;s there was a big campaign to clean up the public buildings.  They <br/>
were sandblasting soot off of government buildings and cathedrals and <br/>
palaces.  The place had become a soot-coated, dismal, dark place.  With wood <br/>
and coal fires, and the industrial days, and then cars, and then the wars... <br/>
well they hadn&#39;t really had a chance to clean up.  It looks really  nice now! <br/>
 But it seems for years it was black and greasy.  And people were breathing <br/>
that stuff, and leaning on it, and sitting on it.<br/>

I always sleep with my windows open, even in the icy depths of winter.<br/>
Must be my european upbringing. I get headaches in an over-heated stuffy<br/>
house. Most Americans seem to heat their houses to tropical temperatures<br/>
in the winter and then cool them to sub-zero in the summer. The nuclear<br/>
industy probably encourages this so they can build more stations :(<br/>
