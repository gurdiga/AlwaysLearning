<div id="ygrps-yiv-809348814">I&#39;m thinking about unschooling a child who, even after three years of<br/>
homeschooling, needs prompting to do work, and is not a book reader. She is<br/>
in 7th grade and struggling in math. She likes animals, bugs, and watching<br/>
movies. When she tested below grade level in English, I told her if she were<br/>
to watch her DVD&#39;s, she had to have the English subtitles on. She came up to<br/>
grade level last year in English. She still struggles in math.<br/>
<br/>
How does one unschool a reluctant learner? <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Most of the things worth doing in the world had been declared impossible<br/>
before they were done.&quot; -- Louis D. Brandeis<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hey, she sounds like fun! Does she like movies *about* bugs? There&#39;s <br/>
a whole glorious genre to explore, from the tacky B-movies to the <br/>
really chic artsy films like *Microcosmos* - has she seen that? Its <br/>
scrumptious! <br/>
<br/>
That may all sound beside the point since the question was:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How does one unschool a reluctant learner?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But really, the difference between a &quot;reluctant&quot; learner and an <br/>
enthusiastic one is that for the latter learning is part of her own <br/>
internal process of joyful discovery. There&#39;s nothing joyful about <br/>
being &quot;made&quot; to read or &quot;do math&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
What would happen if you helped her explore her interests rather <br/>
than insisting she ingest something unpalattable to her? Where might <br/>
she go, what might she do with animals or bugs or movies or some <br/>
combination - or maybe one of those would lead her in a direction <br/>
neither of you can yet imagine. <br/>
<br/>
She may not be able to articulate what she *wants* to do at this <br/>
point, so you may have to offer or strew ideas - but they should be <br/>
Fun ideas, offered for the potential joy, not entomology textbooks <br/>
or worksheets on animal tracks. Here&#39;s something fun, although you <br/>
may be half a world away for all I know, its a neat idea:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.life.uiuc.edu/entomology/egsa/ifff.html">http://www.life.uiuc.edu/entomology/egsa/ifff.html</a><br/>
(Its an Insect Fear Film Festival and there&#39;s a list of all the <br/>
films they&#39;ve shown in the past if she&#39;s interested).<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also no need to &quot;tie in&quot; to some strange new curriculum of <br/>
Animals-Bugs-and-Film, but the bug thing is really exciting to *me* <br/>
so I can&#39;t resist. That&#39;s a place to *start*, but don&#39;t discount <br/>
anything that you think she&#39;d enjoy. <br/>

Just curious here, why does she have to watch a movie with subtitles <br/>
on?<br/>
<br/>
Im going to take a guess here, but I bet you don&#39;t watch all your <br/>
movies with them on. Because I know I can&#39;t focus one bit on the <br/>
movie because I can&#39;t help be distracted by the words at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Why not juts let her enjoy the movie? Eventually she will see that <br/>
mom gets to enjoy something she doesn&#39;t and that will wreak havoc on <br/>
your relationship with her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Where<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;are the parameters?&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you read through the links Sandra sent you Deborah? The idea of<br/>
&quot;progress&quot; is another one from school-think. None of us know what are<br/>
children &quot;should&quot; be doing, or where they &quot;should&quot; be...only they do, and<br/>
they learn this through freedom, support, understanding, and a life with<br/>
interesting things going on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you an example from our home. I have four kids. They are 18, 16,<br/>
14 and 13. We&#39;ve had many things going on in our life and through watching<br/>
them, and through having many things going on that seemed to interest them,<br/>
they have been drawn to particular interests. I might even call them<br/>
passions. Daughter is in a professional dance company, son is in two jazz<br/>
bands, son is a poet and performance artist who has performed and helped<br/>
organize events, son is a video genius, well-belted in karate, and is great<br/>
in air soft tournaments, which he has organized at our house.<br/>
<br/>
They are all happy. They have fulfilling lives. They are smart. They<br/>
navigate the world easily. They are responsible and kind. Two have jobs.<br/>
They are seen as responsible, trustworthy and bright by outside people,<br/>
including their bosses. One says he is applying to music colleges next year,<br/>
and one says she is applying to Julliard after numerous performing in<br/>
musicals. What needs measuring?<br/>

that your daughter doesn&#39;t seem to be interested in anything right now. That<br/>

is a decompression time that can take months...and it is necessary for the<br/>
healing of the child and for the child to be able to trust that she is<br/>
really free and supported. It takes time. And trust. It is from that place<br/>
of feeling free and supported that our kids begin to get interested in life<br/>
again, like they were before schooling started.<br/>

<br/>
Jacki&#39;s response was good.  I&#39;d like to look at it from another angle.<br/>
<br/>
Parameters are limiting.<br/>
To put something inside a pre-designed box and decide whether it&#39;s a  <br/>
good fit involves stasis.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t about stasis.  It&#39;s about growth and change.<br/>
<br/>
While people are growing and changing they&#39;re learning  When you stop  <br/>
them to measure, they&#39;re not learning.  When you look at parameters  <br/>
instead of looking at your child, you&#39;re not learning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2105379977">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Is there a time when a parent thinks, &quot;This isn&#39;t working&quot;? What is the<br/>
marker of success or failure in unschooling? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If something is &quot;going wrong&quot; at my home, it is never because of<br/>
Unschooling. It&#39;s usually because I&#39;m doing something unhelpful - I&#39;m caught<br/>
up in wanting to be in control, I&#39;m caught up in regretful thinking, I&#39;m<br/>
distracted by something, I&#39;ve got PMS. Jayn is a really good marker of my<br/>
emotional state.<br/>
<br/>
Things that are problems at my home aren&#39;t about learning or academics. They<br/>
are always in the broad arena of Jayn&#39;s behavior towards us. At no time do I<br/>
ever think that schooling would be the solution. The solution is always<br/>
contained in a box marked &quot;More focused attention from Mum and Dad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that any time a parent new to unschooling starts thinking &quot;This<br/>
isn&#39;t working&quot; it is because they are holding on to an expectation.<br/>
<br/>
Expectations can get in the way of seeing what is really happening.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn was newborn, James and I would do what I suspect many parents do,<br/>
and wake up in the night to check that she was still breathing. She was so<br/>
tiny and breathed so quietly that even sleeping next to her we couldn&#39;t<br/>
always hear her, so we would put a hand on her to feel the movement as<br/>
gently as possible to not disturb her. Eventually she grew bigger and older<br/>
and we were able to let go of our anxiety and trust that she was breathing<br/>
and get on with just appreciating how beautiful she was.<br/>
<br/>
Coming to Unschooling is a bit like that. At first you may feel the need to<br/>
check that your child is learning, so try to do it without disturbing her.<br/>
Eventually - or probably quickly - it will become abundantly clear that she<br/>
is learning and you can let go of that checking, and just appreciate her<br/>
wonder.<br/>
<br/>
I started saying something about long term investments paying off, but James<br/>
called me on that idea, saying that looking at it in terms of payoffs isn&#39;t<br/>
helpful. James says, if you must have a payoff, the payoff is that your<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634682129">I have always told my patients (new moms) to go home and trust their gut.  Thats what they need to do to survive.  I decided to school Jonah because his teacher was abusing him and humiliating him.  Julia (7) however was doing beautifully in school.  I took her out because I trusted my gut.  She is always so touchy feely and clingy all evening and night.  So much so that I found myself always removing her arm from my chest and from around my neck (I breastfed each of them for 2.5 years).  I realized that she was just not getting enough of me.  I never had time to do homework with her, the older kids came first with their hours of work.  She also said that she missed me when she was at school.  Of course my entire family  are shocked, flabbergasted, appaled and can&#39;t understand why i took my kids out. h They have been warning me that I made a huge mistake.  Fortunately I have done attachment parenting before i knew what it was - i listened to my kids.  If they wanted me -<br/>
 they had me.  If they had to be in arms - even when my eldest was 3 - she was in arms.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to your kids.  They never lie.  <br/>

-=-How does one unschool a reluctant learner? -=-<br/>
<br/>
First, stop schooling her. To unschool, she and you (especially <br/>
you) will need to change expectations and habits. This is called <br/>
deschooling. There are several good articles here:<br/>
http://sandradodd. &lt;http://sandradodd. com/deschooling&gt; com/deschooling<br/>
<br/>
-=-needs prompting to do work, and is not a book reader-=-<br/>
<br/>
Reading is everywhere. If you define reading as &quot;book reading&quot; you <br/>
could use a change of view. Is she a magazine reader? Cereal box <br/>
reader? Video game instruction reader?<br/>
<br/>
-=-needs prompting to do work-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling can&#39;t involve &quot;work.&quot; Stop thinking of things in terms <br/>
of work one must be prompted to do.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She is<br/>
in 7th grade-=-<br/>
<br/>
She won&#39;t be, if you stop doing school. My kids didn&#39;t go to school <br/>
and were never in a grade. My youngest is 15. Before that she was <br/>
14. You&#39;ve described your daughter in school terms.<br/>
<br/>
-=-She likes ... watching<br/>
movies. ... I told her if she were<br/>
to watch her DVD&#39;s, she had to have the English subtitles on.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a good way to make her stop liking movies and not to be too <br/>
crazy about you.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend the deschooling site above and some reading here:<br/>

Just curious here, why does she have to watch a movie with subtitles <br/>
on?<br/>
<br/>
Im going to take a guess here, but I bet you don&#39;t watch all your <br/>
movies with them on. Because I know I can&#39;t focus one bit on the <br/>
movie because I can&#39;t help be distracted by the words at the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
Why not juts let her enjoy the movie? Eventually she will see that <br/>
mom gets to enjoy something she doesn&#39;t and that will wreak havoc on <br/>
your relationship with her.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Have you read through the links Sandra sent you Deborah? The idea of<br/>
&quot;progress&quot; is another one from school-think. None of us know what are<br/>
children &quot;should&quot; be doing, or where they &quot;should&quot; be...only they do, and<br/>
they learn this through freedom, support, understanding, and a life with<br/>
interesting things going on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll give you an example from our home. I have four kids. They are 18, 16,<br/>
14 and 13. We&#39;ve had many things going on in our life and through watching<br/>
them, and through having many things going on that seemed to interest them,<br/>
they have been drawn to particular interests. I might even call them<br/>
passions. Daughter is in a professional dance company, son is in two jazz<br/>
bands, son is a poet and performance artist who has performed and helped<br/>
organize events, son is a video genius, well-belted in karate, and is great<br/>
in air soft tournaments, which he has organized at our house.<br/>
<br/>
They are all happy. They have fulfilling lives. They are smart. They<br/>
navigate the world easily. They are responsible and kind. Two have jobs.<br/>
They are seen as responsible, trustworthy and bright by outside people,<br/>
including their bosses. One says he is applying to music colleges next year,<br/>
and one says she is applying to Julliard after numerous performing in<br/>
musicals. What needs measuring?<br/>

Subject: RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: Special Needs Unschool: Mine or Hers<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Is there a time when a parent thinks, &quot;This isn&#39;t working&quot;? What is the<br/>
marker of success or failure in unschooling? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If something is &quot;going wrong&quot; at my home, it is never because of<br/>
Unschooling. It&#39;s usually because I&#39;m doing something unhelpful - I&#39;m caught<br/>
up in wanting to be in control, I&#39;m caught up in regretful thinking, I&#39;m<br/>
distracted by something, I&#39;ve got PMS. Jayn is a really good marker of my<br/>
emotional state.<br/>
<br/>
Things that are problems at my home aren&#39;t about learning or academics. They<br/>
are always in the broad arena of Jayn&#39;s behavior towards us. At no time do I<br/>
ever think that schooling would be the solution. The solution is always<br/>
contained in a box marked &quot;More focused attention from Mum and Dad&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect that any time a parent new to unschooling starts thinking &quot;This<br/>
isn&#39;t working&quot; it is because they are holding on to an expectation.<br/>
<br/>
Expectations can get in the way of seeing what is really happening.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn was newborn, James and I would do what I suspect many parents do,<br/>
and wake up in the night to check that she was still breathing. She was so<br/>
tiny and breathed so quietly that even sleeping next to her we couldn&#39;t<br/>
always hear her, so we would put a hand on her to feel the movement as<br/>
gently as possible to not disturb her. Eventually she grew bigger and older<br/>
and we were able to let go of our anxiety and trust that she was breathing<br/>
and get on with just appreciating how beautiful she was.<br/>
<br/>
Coming to Unschooling is a bit like that. At first you may feel the need to<br/>
check that your child is learning, so try to do it without disturbing her.<br/>
Eventually - or probably quickly - it will become abundantly clear that she<br/>
is learning and you can let go of that checking, and just appreciate her<br/>
wonder.<br/>
<br/>
I started saying something about long term investments paying off, but James<br/>
called me on that idea, saying that looking at it in terms of payoffs isn&#39;t<br/>
helpful. James says, if you must have a payoff, the payoff is that your<br/>
child is allowed and enabled to become a passionate human being, happy in<br/>
their life, happy with their freedom to choose and engage in their passion<br/>
today. <br/>

that your daughter doesn&#39;t seem to be interested in anything right now. That<br/>
is what most kids seem like after being in structured school settings. There<br/>
is a decompression time that can take months...and it is necessary for the<br/>
healing of the child and for the child to be able to trust that she is<br/>
really free and supported. It takes time. And trust. It is from that place<br/>
of feeling free and supported that our kids begin to get interested in life<br/>
again, like they were before schooling started.<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Feedback&quot;?<br/>
Look directly at your child without looking at test scores and grade  <br/>
levels and comparisons.  If you can&#39;t do that, you will have some  <br/>
evidence that the problem is on your end.<br/>
<br/>
You have lots of choices.  You can send her to school.  You can do  <br/>
school at home, with a curriculum and a schedule and grades.  You can  <br/>
do other kinds of homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you want the benefits unschoolers are talking about, you have to  <br/>
unschool.<br/>
If you&#39;re going to unschool you must (no option, it won&#39;t work  <br/>
otherwise) deschool.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll have to take all the school parts of your life out--out of  <br/>
your head, out of your vocabulary, out of your schedule...<br/>

  The feedback/evidence we get is joyous, shining children who live free lives.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Sure, some folks don&#39;t make the leap successfully, but worrying about that won&#39;t bring joy into my family&#39;s life today.  Start with today - do what you love, help your children to do what they love.  Then do it again &#39;today&#39; every day.  I&#39;ve found that each time I make a step towards the life I want, it gets easier to make the next step the next day.  <br/>

My daughter was happy and full-filled in her silent moment while my head raced with expectations.  When you see your daughter sitting silently, try not to disturb her. She might be sailing along and your verbal expectations, wants, and concerns could be the iceberg that sinks her.  <br/>
<br/>
Typing from experience here. Don&#39;t sink your kiddo. <br/>

&gt;Coming to Unschooling is a bit like that. At first you may feel the need to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1153121966">Hi Sylvia,<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s wonderful to re-connect again... in more ways than one.   <br/>
Learning to be a yes-mom again, but still having difficulty when the  <br/>
fighting begins... not sure how to handle the onslaught of anger from  <br/>
Athena (dd).  It breaks my heart to see her like that.  At least  <br/>
there is progress.  Today, when she flew off the handle (she&#39;s 7)  <br/>
because dh went out with a friend and didn&#39;t take her and so resorted  <br/>
to saying hurtful things to me (which I looked beyond to the core...  <br/>
tried to.... made it there but then got lost in my own junk and we  <br/>
ended up spatting), but I hung in there and made myself shut up and  <br/>
stop trying to &quot;fix&quot; things.  We got to the root of the problem, and  <br/>
that is that she feels she doesn&#39;t get out enough.  So we talked  <br/>
about ways of getting out more (we live in the BOONIES with no car  <br/>
when dh isn&#39;t home so getting to the village isn&#39;t easy).  But from  <br/>
being here (this group) I realized that she feels a need, and if we  <br/>
take her out plenty of times to eat, she&#39;ll feel full and when her  <br/>
daddy goes out again, she probably won&#39;t freak out.  So we&#39;re saving  <br/>
up for a few nights on the town..... er.... village.<br/>
<br/>
Hugs,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965513688">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; OK It feels scary.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Do some people make it and others not? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One of the big ideas in discussing Unschooling is the concept of fear and<br/>
the idea that living in fear is a choice. There are tools that we can use to<br/>
dispel fear.<br/>
<br/>
Deborah there is a theme permeating many of your questioning posts which is<br/>
that you seem to want to hear about failures. You are not the first person<br/>
to come to the lists and want essentially statistics, or want to focus on<br/>
the problems to be overcome.<br/>
<br/>
This idea that a certain proportion must fail (so how do we avoid being in<br/>
that number) is SCHOOLTHINK! It is an assumption based on the experience of<br/>
being schooled and living with schooling because in school a certain<br/>
proportion of children do fail. They must fail because that is how the bell<br/>
curve works. And if too many of them are failing by the school&#39;s criteria,<br/>
they change the criteria to keep the bell curve even.<br/>
<br/>
There are parents who don&#39;t Unschool successfully and insist their children<br/>
go back into school. There are also people who &quot;try an unschooling approach&quot;<br/>
for certain topics or subjects.<br/>
<br/>
These people aren&#39;t getting to Unschooling. They are putting their feet in<br/>
the water and calling it swimming. Then they wonder why they aren&#39;t reaching<br/>
the opposite side of the pool.<br/>
<br/>
The people who continue to post on this and the sister lists are people who<br/>
are swimming. This list is populated with success. <br/>
<br/>
Tools for dispelling fear:<br/>
<br/>
One that has worked well for me is to examine the fear. Is it rational or<br/>
irrational? Is it some unexamined clichéd statement put in my head by my own<br/>
nutty mother or a pat phrase from the media? Does my observation of my child<br/>
or other people&#39;s children bear out the fear?<br/>
<br/>
Another is knowledge. This is a really useful one. Research the real<br/>
statistics. Look at the real experiences of people who are Unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Stay in the present. Look at what your child is doing today, instead of<br/>
worrying about the future, which will come anyway. What if some horrible<br/>
event took your daughter from you? Would you be regretting the math test she<br/>
didn&#39;t take next week?<br/>
<br/>
Focus on success. Focus on the positive outcomes. Learn what people are<br/>
doing right, instead of seeking out what they may be doing badly.<br/>
<br/>
Peter Kowalski has a column in each issue of Life Learning magazine<br/>
(www.lifelearningmagazine.com ) where he interviews grown up Unschoolers<br/>
about their lives and where they are now. By and large they are very<br/>
positive. I suspect that in the interest of being fair and balanced he asks<br/>
them a question along the lines of &quot;negative experiences from Unschooling&quot;<br/>
or things not learned that were subsequently a problem. Much of the time<br/>
these young adults do have some issue or skill that they didn&#39;t learn while<br/>
unschooling that they found they needed for their profession. <br/>
<br/>
So what do they do about it? They identify the problem and set about finding<br/>
the information, learning the skill or working around the lack - hugely<br/>
successfully. <br/>
<br/>
What they don&#39;t do is throw their hands up and say, &quot;Gosh Unschooling has<br/>
made me failure, I must be stupid, learning new things is hard&quot; or any of<br/>
the sad, discouraged mental tapes that go through the minds of schooled kids<br/>
who feel like they are failures, or have had their personal interests<br/>
belittled and dreams squashed by well meaning but unsupportive conventional<br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
The only regret that people express about Unschooling is that they waited to<br/>
begin.<br/>
<br/>
School will always be there. If for your family Unschooling does not lead to<br/>
a happier, more connected family with freedom and joy abounding, school will<br/>
still be available. But don&#39;t count on it - don&#39;t live with the idea that<br/>
she has to keep up just in case, or you will be foiling the process before<br/>
it starts. The longer your dd is in school, the longer she will need to<br/>
deschool. (Approx. 1 month per school year). Every time you say something<br/>
like &quot;Why don&#39;t you do this math page&quot; or &quot;Tell me about this book&quot; (with<br/>
the intention of gauging her reading competence) or &quot;No more tv today, do<br/>
something worthwhile&quot; it is like Snakes and Ladders - back you go to the<br/>
beginning of deschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Kids don&#39;t fail at Unschooling. <br/>

They can have it sabotaged for them, though.  (But that goes back to  <br/>
parental failure.)<br/>
