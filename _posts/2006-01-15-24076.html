<div id="ygrps-yiv-528608439">When I said my kids had not taken a class or done a workbook or <br/>
whatever, I was not saying I thought they never should or could if <br/>
they wanted to.  I imagine they will at some point.  I was just saying <br/>
they had not, that it was not yet part of their life experience.  They <br/>
are 7 and 9 and have not been interested in any activities of that <br/>
sort to this point.  There are a lot of people (homeschoolers) locally <br/>
who have their kids in various groups and classes and activities but <br/>
none have yet appealed to my kids, they haven&#39;t chosen any.  <br/>
