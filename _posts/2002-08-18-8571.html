<div id="ygrps-yiv-1184715639">I wanted to point out a couple more things.  I don&#39;t know how close to 17 <br/>
your neice is but in WA at 17 she can become an emancipated minor (ooo a <br/>
whole year early, I know) as long as no one contests it and it doesn&#39;t sound <br/>
as if her parents would.<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that she was interested in going into college too so another <br/>
thing you might consider is getting her into running start at CBC.  They can <br/>
start there through the high schoool if they are Juniors.  The way it works <br/>
then is they can graduate college with a AA degree at the time they would be <br/>
graduationg High school.  It&#39;s a good program if you can get in.  I had <br/>
friends who did it.  It might be worth it to check with a counselor at <br/>
Richland High.  It&#39;s 2 free years of college (I think you might have to pay <br/>
for books).  It sounds like she has the grades.<br/>
<br/>
Of course then you&#39;re involving yourself with the Public Schooles but it is <br/>
an option.<br/>
