because there are other fun things. What if we decided that there are other<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know about wise, but here is some food for thought. (Just for the<br/>
record, I don&#39;t completely agree with any of these, but they were<br/>
interesting to read about.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   - Kids who watch informative and educational shows as preschoolers tend<br/>
   to watch more informative and educational shows when they get older.  They<br/>
   use TV effectively as a complement to school learning.  On the other hand,<br/>
   kids who watch more entertainment program watch fewer informative programs<br/>
   as they get older  (Macbeth, 1996).<br/>
   - Preschoolers who viewed educational programs tend to have higher<br/>
   grades, are less aggressive and value their studies more when they reach<br/>
   high school, according to a long-term study (Anderson, et. al, 2001).<br/>
   - Finally, scientists from the University of Siena found that children<br/>
   experience a soothing, painkilling effect by watching cartoons.  So perhaps,<br/>
   a little entertainment TV can be a source of relief to kids who are stressed<br/>
   or are in pain.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787128669">There&#39;s this really cool commercial that&#39;s been playing on PBS recently that shows Big Bird going to a girls home, taking her by the hand and them going together to various well known places throughout the world.  At the end of the commercial it says &quot;T.V. can be a child&#39;s window to the world&quot;.  Of course it doesn&#39;t say all t.v. as it is a plug for PBS, but I like it nonetheless.  <br/>
<br/>
The reasons stated below for limiting t.v. are pure rubbish in my book and just reiterate what every other anti-t.v. group/person/study is spouting nowdays.  I&#39;m to the point now that I read stuff like that and just shake my head because my family has already disproved every single one of the anti-t.v. aruguments (maybe not everyone because my children aren&#39;t to adulthood yet, but you get the drift).  As far as limiting ones world and only calling certain shows &quot;quality&quot;, that&#39;s the same as only labeling certain toys &quot;educational&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
My house is more peaceful when my kids are able to pursue what interests them without judgement.  I know I wouldn&#39;t feel very peaceful inside if I was made to feel like my interests didn&#39;t matter because they didn&#39;t coincide with what my parents deemed &quot;quality&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of other fun things to do in addition to watching t.v., that doesn&#39;t mean that watching t.v. is less fun though, it&#39;s just something else to do, another choice if you will in the wide world of choices unschoolers get to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
Taking an analogy from the book &#39;Peace Begins With You&#39;:<br/>
<br/>
When one side wins (the mother/father who have control of the t.v.) and one side loses (the child who can&#39;t choose what he wants to watch on t.v.) that isn&#39;t peace.  When one side gets what they want or need (the mother/father who gets to make the choice) and the other (the child) gives up trying because &quot;those are the rules&quot;, that is not peace.  <br/>
<br/>
A quote from the book:<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Everybody is different.  They want and need different things, in different places at different times in their lives.  Peace is being allowed to be different-and letting others be different from you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Our children are their own people, they have different likes, dislikes & tastes than us.  For us to put our own wants and intersts onto someone else is just plain wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Children that are free to have their own minds and their own interests allow others to have their own minds and their own interests.  <br/>

2.  Who wants to sit mindless in front of the t.v.?<br/>
3.  I don&#39;t see how limiting it ensures only good quality.<br/>
4.  It&#39;s not peaceful and stress-free enforcing limits, and in my house, with no limits on t.v., we have lots more screen free time than otherwise anyway.<br/>
5.  Yes, there are other fun things to do.  How is that a reason not to watch t.v.?  Is it also a reason not to dance, build block towers, write stories, or tell jokes because there are other fun things to do besides those things, too?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>TV is a medium providing varying degrees of access to experiences not physically present, just like newspapers, magazines, radio, those holiday brochures you get in travel agents, billboards. I wouldn&#39;t be without one. I wouldn&#39;t be without my library of books. I can pick up a book any time I choose and put it down again any time I choose. I can switch on the TV any time I choose and switch it off any time I choose. Every TV I&#39;ve ever had has come with an on/off switch.<br/>
<br/>
1. Being sedentary is what correlates with poor health, weight gain, and low energy levels. That can be achieved in a number of ways - playing chess for hours every day, for example, which is what world champions are required to do. Having a job where you&#39;re at a desk in an office all day every day is another opportunity.<br/>
<br/>
2. What self-respecting TV aficionado would waste valuable viewing time on watching mindlessly?<br/>
<br/>
3. When it&#39;s on, it&#39;s &quot;quality&quot;. Hmm... That&#39;s an invitation to a six week long discussion of what exactly constitutes &quot;quality TV&quot;. I&#39;m pretty sure my ideas about that will differ to many people&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
4. The TV is off by default in my home too. That&#39;s always been the case.<br/>
<br/>
5. There are other fun things to do. Absolutely.<br/>
<br/>
Wise words? I&#39;ve no idea. Some random thoughts as I eagerly anticipate long hours glued to the idiot box every day through the upcoming soccer World Cup.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-343866661">Hi, Mary,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you mentioned about not watching TV too much.  I&#39;d let my oldest son, almost 3, to watch only PBS or Sprout or educational DVD/VT while I breastfeed my baby for a while.  after that, i would ask him please to turn the tv off and he just stand up and turn if off and start to do something with me.  And, if I&#39;m too sick with migraine headaches, then I&#39;d have to let him to watch all morning while i play with my baby.  I&#39;d start to do a few activities with them from PBS or Sprout after their nap time in afternoon time.  I think it&#39;s okay.<br/>
<br/>
I have tried to invite a few friends with their children to join with us to do something in the mornings, but their children sleep (babies/toddlers/preschoolers) LATE in the mornings!  the parents allow their children to watch too much tv and sleep in real late like at 10pm, 11pm, or midnight.  I feel it&#39;s not fun to invite them because i would end up being disappointed doing alone with my sons in the mornings.<br/>
<br/>
I beleive it&#39;s from the society and so many young children sleep in late and wake up late or have to get up early morning and they act grumpy - no energy to play.  <br/>
<br/>
tell me if you disagree with me - that&#39;d be fine - and i&#39;d like to hear your thoughtfuls.  thanks.  :)<br/>
<br/>
ANyway, thank you for sharing!  :)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-404554163">===1. Watching TV correlates with poor health, weight gain, and low energy levels.===<br/>
<br/>
Referring back to the article to which you linked, I don&#39;t understand why sitting in classrooms for 7-8 hours a day isn&#39;t considered a correlation to poor health, weight gain, and low energy levels (ie, couch potato-edness). That&#39;s approximately double the time that the &quot;average child&quot; spends watching tv daily, according to the professor quoted in the article. Pfft, what a double standard.<br/>
<br/>
There are many things a person could spend all day doing that required minimal physical exertion, but it&#39;s always tv and video games that get the bad rap. <br/>
<br/>
If a child came home from school and read for four hours instead of watching tv for four hours, that&#39;s considered acceptable -- even though reading isn&#39;t any more physically exerting than watching tv. (The irony is that some kids do come home and spend a crazy amount of time doing homework -- something that requires minimal physical exertion.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===2. Mindless TV-watching allows all sorts of images and values I don&#39;t necessarily endorse into my home. &lt;snip&gt; Leaving the tv on means having very little control of what information is infiltrated into your four walls.===<br/>
<br/>
I disagree. I like having the tv on in the background when I&#39;m doing things around the house or in my office. Sometimes, like today, it&#39;s on all day, but I&#39;m *always* aware of what&#39;s on -- and it&#39;s never anything I would be horrified for my son to walk in and see if I&#39;m not in the room -- Food Network, HGTV, Discovery Channel, History Channel, and USA Network. If my son has the tv on in the background while he&#39;s doing something else, he has it on channels he enjoys -- Nick, Cartoon Network, and Disney Channel. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand the statement that leaving the tv on means having very little control over what info &quot;infiltrates&quot; my house -- like all of a sudden my tv takes control over itself and changes to trashy shows and forces my son to watch them and zaps me if I try to change the channel or turn off the tv??? Good grief.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===3. Keeping TV watching down to a minimal level means that when it&#39;s on, it&#39;s quality. &lt;snip&gt; Watching tv as a family for four hours per week, instead of 28, means that those four hours are much more meaningful.===<br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe it&#39;s something the parent considers quality but the kids would rather take a pass on if they had the choice. Someone mentioned in the unschooling chat yesterday that her daughter&#39;s boyfriend was required to watch tv with his dad on Sunday nights -- the dad deems obviously deems it quality viewing, but does his son? <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that more tv viewing equates to it being less meaningful. Andrew rarely watches tv anymore, but when he was a bit  younger we watched it a lot of some days -- we&#39;d have marathon viewings of whatever his favorite series&#39; were. That time was just as meaningful to him and me as it would&#39;ve been if we&#39;d only watched 15 or 30 minutes of tv that day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===4. It&#39;s more peaceful, relaxing, and less stressful when the TV is off by default.===<br/>
<br/>
It depends on what&#39;s on the tv. I never watch news channels or talk shows because I personally find those stressful and as far from peaceful as you can get. No matter which channel we watch, when commercials come on the volume gets muted or turned way down -- we don&#39;t mind doing that (I find commercials on the radio equally as annoying). There are certain channels that are very relaxing for me to watch -- Food Network, Travel Channel, HGTV; hubby finds History Channel very relaxing. <br/>
<br/>
There are times I want quiet and the tv off, but there are times when I don&#39;t want the house totally quiet so I choose to have the tv on something that is relaxing for me to watch or have on in the background.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===5. There are simply other fun things to do.===<br/>
<br/>
Sure, there are plenty of fun things to do, many that don&#39;t involve the tv at all! But it doesn&#39;t have to be either-or kind of thing. Andrew and I embarked upon many a role-playing adventures after watching an episode of Pokemon or Digimon!! Even though he came up with his own ideas when we played with those action figures, he also liked drawing inspiration from the tv shows. <br/>
<br/>
I find Food Network to be a frequent source of inspiration. Duff Goldman of Ace of Cakes (on Food Network) is a great example of someone who took something they enjoyed doing and going outside the box with how they used it, and creating a successful business because of it. Instead of hiring a bunch of folks trained as cake decorators, he hired friends with artistic backgrounds . . . and it shows in their cakes! They make some truly amazing stuff, and they inspire kids and adults, alike.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
===Why would I trade watching someone else&#39;s (fake) life for living out my own?=== (quote from the article these &quot;5 great reasons&quot; came from)<br/>
<br/>
The article&#39;s author has obviously not watched &quot;Glee&quot; or &quot;LOST&quot; [g]. <br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m watching tv while I&#39;m doing needlework or cooking or paying bills, I am definitely living my own life. When my hubby and I were watching &quot;NCIS&quot; on Sunday and trying to solve the crime before the show did, we were definitely living our own lives -- just as much as we were earlier in the day when we puttering around in the backyard. <br/>
<br/>
When someone writes an article or a book, aren&#39;t they hoping someone (preferably many someones!) will trade living their own life for a few minutes or hours in exchange for reading about someone else&#39;s (fake or real) life???<br/>
<br/>
As with many things in life, it&#39;s all perspective [g].<br/>

I&#39;d encourage anyone who is interested, or who is fretting about weight, to read The Obesity Myth as one introduction to the topic.<br/>

much TV they watch; they still spend the same number of hours awake and the<br/>
same number watching TV regardless of when those hours are.<br/>
<br/>
The reason we have a late routine is because they like to spend a lot of<br/>
time with their father, who doesn&#39;t get home until eight or nine pm. We like<br/>
to have dinner together and yes, watch TV together, and a child who eats<br/>
dinner at nine doesn&#39;t want to go to sleep at half past. They want to tell<br/>
him about their day, and play with him, and be near him. I think giving them<br/>
that opportunity is far more important than being awake in the mornings.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you should try arranging to do things with your friends in the<br/>
afternoons.<br/>

<br/>
You could turn that around and say that poor health and low energy levels<br/>
correlate with watching TV  - my children watch more TV when they&#39;re unwell<br/>
or tired because it&#39;s restful as well as mentally stimulating. They also<br/>
watch at other times but no-one observing them leaping around the room in<br/>
front of the TV could accuse them of low energy levels.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t imagine mindless TV watching in our house; my children don&#39;t<br/>
tolerate what they consider to be rubbish and skip through adverts. I have<br/>
known people who claim to have been too tired to change the channel or find<br/>
the remote who have seen things they didn&#39;t want to but in my house if the<br/>
children are that tired I&#39;m changing the channel for them and giving them<br/>
food; that kind of tiredness usually means being tucked up in a blanket with<br/>
some hot chocolate and a familiar DVD on so they can fall asleep without<br/>
feeling they missed out.<br/>
<br/>
Having visitors allows all sorts of values I don&#39;t necessarily endorse into<br/>
my home, but I&#39;m not going to stop having friends round, even if they smack<br/>
their children and tell them they mustn&#39;t watch TV.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If the children REALLY want to watch TV and I won&#39;t let them, I doubt I&#39;d<br/>
find it peaceful, relaxing or stress-free. I know they wouldn&#39;t find it<br/>
stress-free.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>games, play lego, play with toys, jump on the trampoline, swing on the<br/>
doorway bar, eat food - all while watching TV. And while not watching TV.<br/>
And when something on TV has inspired then to the point that they can&#39;t wait<br/>
a moment longer, even until the programme has finished, before going to try<br/>
out their ideas.<br/>
<br/>
TV enhances our life so much I find it hard to understand the viewpoint of<br/>
people who don&#39;t use it, even though I know I had a wonderful childhood<br/>
without one. My children&#39;s lives just seem so much more rounded.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Referring back to the article to which you linked, I don&#39;t understand why sitting in classrooms for 7-8 hours a day isn&#39;t considered a correlation to poor health, weight gain, and low energy levels (ie, couch potato-edness). That&#39;s approximately double the time that the &quot;average child&quot; spends watching tv daily, according to the professor quoted in the article. Pfft, what a double standard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Whenever I hear this argument against TV that&#39;s the first thing I think of. Yes, it probably would be a problem for children who spend half the day sitting at a desk in school, especially when they might only get 5-10 minutes for recess and no PE class. Those children go from sitting at school to sitting at home, if not watching TV than doing homework.<br/>
<br/>
At my house, the TV may be on most of the day but the kids are not sitting in front of it like zombies. Most of the time, they are barely paying attention to it. It&#39;s background noise while they play with toys, run, jump, dance around, whatever. <br/>

I think incorporating media and snacks into a family&#39;s life is about<br/>
children&#39;s empowerment, not adult convenience.  Many studies don&#39;t seem to<br/>
take into account whether children have adult or human contact or other<br/>
options.  Intention gets lost.  My kids would rather go out than watch 8<br/>
hours of television most days, because some shows are boring.<br/>
So if they do a movie marathon it is a family affair to sit and watch--it is<br/>
not an opportunity for me to get other stuff done.<br/>

For a while (maybe still) someone was selling a clicker that would  <br/>
turn off any public TV.  People could use it from their pockets in a  <br/>
cowardly fashion.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve stayed in an airport 24 hours.  I&#39;ve sat at motor vehicles two  <br/>
hours.  I&#39;ve been in doctors&#39; offices worried and afraid and in pain,  <br/>
needing a distraction.  I&#39;ve been at department stores and just  <br/>
enjoyed the heck out of seeing some beautiful documentary showing on  <br/>
100 large and small screens all at once.<br/>
<br/>
And some people think TV is so evil that they would be doing the whole  <br/>
earth a favor by turning it off.<br/>
<br/>
It would be like running through snatching magazines and books and  <br/>

required minimal physical exertion, but it&#39;s always tv and video games  <br/>
that get the bad rap. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Ooooh!  Ooooh!  [hopping up and down in my chair with my hand  <br/>
stretched as far as  humanly possible]  I know!  Ask me!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, Sandra?&quot; (with an eye roll, and a sigh, like &#39;her again&#39;--though  <br/>
not all teachers did that, and not all readers do that)<br/>
<br/>
Teachers do as much as they can to make school interesting, including  <br/>
covering the windows with paper, or artwork, or paint, lest a child  <br/>
look out the window at clouds or trees or other people.<br/>
<br/>
TV can keep kids from doing homework, and from going to bed early so  <br/>
they won&#39;t be tired in school.  Never in all that has school itself  <br/>
been blamed for kids falling asleep in school.  That is always taken  <br/>
as absolute proof that the parents are bad parents for not enforcing  <br/>
an earlier bedtime.<br/>
<br/>
Video games are so exciting that the kids draw pictures of the  <br/>
characters and scenarios in their notebooks at school, and that seems  <br/>
proof to the teacher that the kids aren&#39;t listening.  No consideration  <br/>
of the **fact** that some kids need to doodle or fidget in order to  <br/>
sit still.  I was one of them, but because I got good grades, they  <br/>
said I was bored.  If I had had bad grades, I would&#39;ve been &quot;acting  <br/>
out&quot; or &quot;hyperactive.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When collectible cards were the big thing ten years ago, schools  <br/>
confiscated cards.  Kids risked that confiscation, just as they had  <br/>
with comic books in years before that, because the comics and cards  <br/>
were like technicolor compared to the grey-on-grey of the school  <br/>
lessons.<br/>
<br/>
The more exciting the outside world is, the more and more dull school  <br/>
seems.  And when something seems dull, that&#39;s because it is dull.   <br/>
Dull is in the eye of the beholder.<br/>

I hate TVs in public places not because I dislike TV but because if I&#39;m in an airport, say, I hate the extra noise. It feels like an imposition and an extra stressor on top of all the other ones I&#39;m dealing with to travel in that way. Most of the time TVs in public places aren&#39;t being watched.  If I had one of those clickers, and was sitting in a waiting area at the airport with a TV blaring and nobody actually watching it, I&#39;d gladly turn it off.<br/>

Right, what several peoples say.  School is more sitting than TV is.<br/>
<br/>
Also, correlation isn&#39;t causation.<br/>
Hospitals correlate with death, but that doesn&#39;t mean (necessarily)  <br/>
that it&#39;s the hospital that causes the death.<br/>
Anti-depressents correlate with suicide, but BIG DUH! !!  Pretty much  <br/>
only suicidal people take them!<br/>
<br/>
If a kid is sickly or weak, TV might be the best possible thing for him.<br/>
If a kid is chubby and the other kids are being hateful about it and  <br/>

&gt; -=-- Kids who watch informative and educational shows as preschoolers<br/>
&gt; tend<br/>
&gt; to watch more informative and educational shows when they get older.<br/>
&gt; They<br/>
&gt; use TV effectively as a complement to school learning. On the other<br/>
&gt; hand,<br/>
&gt; kids who watch more entertainment program watch fewer informative<br/>
&gt; programs<br/>
&gt; as they get older (Macbeth, 1996).-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So kids have real preferences and personalities and don&#39;t need to (or<br/>
&gt; maybe can&#39;t even if they wanted to) learn them from school.<br/>

&gt; (babies/toddlers/preschoolers) LATE in the mornings!  the parents  <br/>
&gt; allow their children to watch too much tv and sleep in real late  <br/>
&gt; like at 10pm, 11pm, or midnight.  I feel it&#39;s not fun to invite them  <br/>
&gt; because i would end up being disappointed doing alone with my sons  <br/>
&gt; in the mornings.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My daughter&#39;s natural rhythm was to go to sleep around 11 or 12 and  <br/>
sleep until 10 a.m. from the time she was born. It had nothing to do  <br/>
with TV watching. Perhaps that&#39;s true of your friends&#39; children, too.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I beleive it&#39;s from the society and so many young children sleep in  <br/>
&gt; late and wake up late or have to get up early morning and they act  <br/>
&gt; grumpy - no energy to play.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Many of our homeschooling/unschooling friends enjoyed relaxed  <br/>
mornings. If they had multiple kids, each one would wake up at a  <br/>
slightly different time (maybe babies first, older kids later or vice  <br/>
versa). As a group, we never, ever scheduled anything before noon.  <br/>
That seemed to work really well for everyone. We&#39;d have a few hours  <br/>
together, which was often enough for little ones who&#39;d nap in the  <br/>
afternoon. As kids got older, we&#39;d spend the day together.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure I get this point, though: society causes young children  <br/>
to sleep in late, wake up late or (conversely) have to get up in the  <br/>
early morning, so they&#39;re grumpy.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are grumpy no matter what time they get up! Food, drinks,  <br/>
cuddles, talking about dreams, so many things can help.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love to watch documentaries and TV shows about real events. I have learned so much more from those than I did in 16+ years of school. We recently had to cancel our extra cable because of finances so that now we only have the local broadcast channels. We have lost a major resource for learning. My 19yo recently discovered Hulu. He says you can watch almost any TV show episode, even the current ones. I need to get him to show me how to use it.<br/>
<br/>
My 6yo has brought up discussions about DNA, composting (which I&#39;ve just recently started trying), and a ton of other interesting subjects that I can&#39;t remember right now. I didn&#39;t bring them up. He heard about them from the TV.<br/>

I&#39;d bet you that those same adults would flip if my very big 19 year old smacked one of his very little brothers. Why would the rules change just because the bigger person is the parent? That makes it even worse, in my opinion.<br/>

&gt; For a while (maybe still) someone was selling a clicker that would<br/>
&gt; turn off any public TV.  People could use it from their pockets in a<br/>
&gt; cowardly fashion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve stayed in an airport 24 hours.  I&#39;ve sat at motor vehicles two<br/>
&gt; hours.  I&#39;ve been in doctors&#39; offices worried and afraid and in pain,<br/>
&gt; needing a distraction.  I&#39;ve been at department stores and just<br/>
&gt; enjoyed the heck out of seeing some beautiful documentary showing on<br/>
&gt; 100 large and small screens all at once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And some people think TV is so evil that they would be doing the whole<br/>
&gt; earth a favor by turning it off.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It would be like running through snatching magazines and books and<br/>
&gt; newspapers out of people&#39;s hands and throwing them on some Farenheit<br/>
&gt; 451 fire.   Only in that case the people know who did it and would<br/>
&gt; probably pummel him or call security.  With those pocket clickers, the<br/>
&gt; cowards weren&#39;t caught.<br/>

Right. Or for some, they watch only after a long hard day or week at<br/>
work. Maybe that&#39;s the sanction guys get for letting loose and<br/>
*really* having a blast watching football (or some other televised<br/>
sport). Tiger Woods! ;) Golfing. I heard some who were getting all<br/>
indignant about it (heehee... oops did I say that?). They were getting<br/>
into it.<br/>

we keep our children from meeting people, they will encounter values we<br/>
don&#39;t agree with. All it takes is for someone to say &quot;I&#39;ll wallop you if you<br/>
do that again&quot; - even if we never see those particular people again. Every<br/>
person who comes to visit - or who we visit, for that matter - brings a new<br/>
set of ideas and values and very often a dislike of some of our ideas. They<br/>
don&#39;t always come up in conversation, sometimes they do.<br/>
<br/>
TV isn&#39;t the only or the worst place children are exposed to values we don&#39;t<br/>
