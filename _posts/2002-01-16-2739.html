<div id="ygrps-yiv-76391572">Some of these threads hit a little close to home for me...I can&#39;t even put <br/>
into words how they make me feel.<br/>
So I won&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I did want to mention that my Grandmother immigrated to this country when she <br/>
was six years old, she is Swiss, spoke only German.<br/>
Strong German influence of course.<br/>
My father never remembers being held or cuddled...EVER.<br/>
He had a lot of issues as an adult to deal with because of it, but he&#39;s <br/>
always been a very warm and loving man. Very calm and caring with us.<br/>
His mother was cold and distant though. I think she&#39;s a fairly loving <br/>
Grandmother now, but I often see glimpses that tell me she thinks children <br/>
are a bother.<br/>
It&#39;s not how she treats my kids...she&#39;s really fun and good to them.<br/>
But things she says sometimes give it away.<br/>
She&#39;s changed a lot.<br/>
I never understood why the German mothers were considered cold and unloving. <br/>
It&#39;s a miracle any of those babies survived. Makes me sick.<br/>
<br/>
And as much as I believe we need some adversity to learn certain lessons, I <br/>
don&#39;t see any necessary lessons coming from rape, torture and abuse. sorry.<br/>
No way.<br/>
I like the way you put it Nanci.<br/>
There is no way to justify some of the random events that screw people up and <br/>
hurt them for life.<br/>
If you believe that a soul chooses all of that, then what would the purpose <br/>
be of intervention? If you think they chose it, then you&#39;d just stand back <br/>
and let evil things happen to them right?<br/>
That&#39;s the danger in that beleif system imo.<br/>
If I believe it&#39;s random, and not right...then intervention makes more sense.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Compassion is a thing to learn too. There&#39;s some quote which I can&#39;t<br/>
recall but it&#39;s something to do with &#39;if evil didn&#39;t exist, there could<br/>
be no good&#39;<br/>
I personally think that we don&#39;t &#39;choose&#39; things to happen (can&#39;t<br/>
imagine 6 million jews choosing Germany for starters) but things happen<br/>
and we can &#39;choose&#39; to learn from them.<br/>
We do attract some things - pessimists find that things go as they<br/>
forsee, and also our perception of an event depends on who we are and<br/>
how we deal with it. The human race seems to lurch from one atrocity to<br/>
the next but is learning all the time. You think back 500 years about<br/>
how things were. People in thrall to fear of the church, peasants bound<br/>
to cruel lords, slavery etc. Things on a grand scale change but as<br/>
individuals we focus on little bits of that tapestry.<br/>
umm, I&#39;ve actually forgotton what point I was trying to make now....<br/>
