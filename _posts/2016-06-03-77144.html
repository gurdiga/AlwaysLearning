<br/>
“Always” should set off your alarms.  Work on helping to stop and hear “always” or “never.”  They’re rarely stating a truth.<br/>
<br/>
Didn’t you hope he would grow up?<br/>
Is it possible that you, the mom, fear his changing from boy to man?<br/>
<br/>
Consider that.<br/>
<br/>
And as comparisons go, the best one might be to compare what he knows and is doing to what he might be doing if he were in school.  MANY boys that age want to drop out. They get involved in dangerous activities of one sort or another, with groups of other boys.  They can become belligerant in school, and defiant.  If he’s not doing all of that, then he might be still at an advantage.  <br/>
<br/>
If before he’s been eager to go out, maybe he’s at an age where he sees the disadvantages.  Maybe his skin is embarrassing him, or maybe he’s feeling gangly and too old for boys’ things, and too young for men’s things.  Maybe he’s right!  Maybe it’s a good time for him to cocoon himself and wait until he wants to venture out.<br/>
