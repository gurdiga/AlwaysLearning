Does CafePress have a european printshop?<br/>
<br/>
We ordered ours when you did and they arrived on Friday.    I sent  <br/>
another order for Bo, who did the tree art (used in the &quot;O&quot; and all  <br/>
over my site), and Kirby (who hadn&#39;t gotten back to us about what he  <br/>
wanted before we ordered the first time).<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll still be good next year, unless this year is such a dismal  <br/>
failure people fear to try again.<br/>

ooooh.<br/>
An international conspiracy!<br/>
That&#39;s even cooler.<br/>
<br/>
WOULD any agency attempt to prevent us from taking a day off from  <br/>
learning!?  The cads...<br/>

Questions to determine creativity and curiosity, to see whether  <br/>
they&#39;re flexible thinkers, whether they believe children are humans  <br/>
(not grubs)... stuff like that.<br/>
