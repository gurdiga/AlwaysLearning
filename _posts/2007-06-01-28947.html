<div id="ygrps-yiv-677873685">I wanted to thank everyone who helped me work through my little spell. <br/>
(I had been having thoughts of enrolling my kids in school for a few <br/>
weeks to give myself a break and satisfy their curiosity.)<br/>
<br/>
Many of your comments really set me back on the right path. Especially <br/>
what Pam said about how it&#39;s not at all helpful to have thoughts of <br/>
school in the picture at all, even as a &quot;last resort.&quot;  So true!  I <br/>
realized it&#39;s like getting married and on your way up the aisle <br/>
thinking &quot;If this doesn&#39;t work, I can always get a divorce.&quot;  It may <br/>
be true, but it&#39;s not going to help you commit to having good marriage <br/>
no matter how difficult things get.  <br/>
<br/>
I had never had any doubts about unschooling before, so it was kind of <br/>
a scary thing to go through. Your responses really helped re-energize <br/>
me. I knew I could count on you!</div>
