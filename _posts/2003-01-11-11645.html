<div id="ygrps-yiv-494562158">IF A DOG WERE YOUR TEACHER, you would learn stuff like this:<br/>
<br/>
 -When loved ones come home, always run to greet them.<br/>
 -Never pass up the opportunity to go for a joyride.<br/>
 -Allow the experience of fresh air and the wind in your face to be pure<br/>
  ecstasy.<br/>
 -When it&#39;s in your best interest-practice obedience.<br/>
 -Let others know when they&#39;ve invaded your territory.<br/>
 -Take naps and stretch before rising. Run, romp, and play daily.<br/>
 -Thrive on attention and let people touch you.<br/>
 -Avoid biting, when a simple growl will do.<br/>
 -On warm days, stop to lie on your back on the grass.<br/>
 -On hot days, drink lots of water and lay under a shady tree.<br/>
 -When you&#39;re happy, dance around and wiggle your entire body.<br/>
 -No matter how often you&#39;re scolded, don&#39;t buy into the guilt thing and<br/>
  pout. Run right back and make friends.<br/>
 -Delight in the simple joy of a long walk.<br/>
 -Eat with gusto and enthusiasm.<br/>
 -Stop when you have had enough. (Don&#39;t know about that one)<br/>
 -Be loyal.<br/>
 -Never pretend to be something you&#39;re not.<br/>
 -If what you want lies buried, dig until you find it.<br/>
 This one is the best...<br/>
 -When someone is having a bad day, be silent, sit close by, and<br/>
  nuzzle them gently.....</div>
