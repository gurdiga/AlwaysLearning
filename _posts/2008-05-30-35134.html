<div id="ygrps-yiv-1418357607">My daugher(9) has always been interested in clocks.  She taught herself <br/>
to tell time at the age of 6 1/2 by staring at the analog clock for <br/>
long periods of time, looking at the analog clock and then looking at <br/>
the digital clock on the microwave, and by asking me what time it is (a <br/>
lot!).  One day she came up to me and said, &quot;Mommy, I can tell time.&quot;  <br/>
At first I didn&#39;t believe it because I had never &quot;taught&quot; her much <br/>
about the clock (pre unschooling days).  She told me the time on the <br/>
clock and she was correct.  She&#39;s been able to tell time to the minute <br/>
since then.<br/>
<br/>
This morning the clock on my nightstand said 7:00 a.m.  My daughter cme <br/>
in to wake me because she was concerned because Curious George was not <br/>
on and it ALWAYS comes on at 7:00 a.m.  I said, &quot;Maybe my clock is <br/>
wrong.&quot;  She checked the clock on the vcr and it was 4 minutes behind <br/>
my clock.  She was confused as to why the clocks were different.  She <br/>
said that maybe the clock on the vcr was wrong and that Curious George <br/>
was just not going to come on anymore.  We had a discussion about how <br/>
clocks can be wrong (human error, malfunctions, etc.).  I told her that <br/>
the clock on the vcr was probably more accurate than my alarm clock <br/>
because it receives a signal and sets the time automatically.<br/>
<br/>
That lead to her wondering how people know what time it is in the first <br/>
place -- how they know what time to set their clocks to.  I got online <br/>
and found a coule of sites for kids that talk about the history of <br/>
clocks (obelisks, sundials, waterclocks, etc.)  She looked at some of <br/>
the animated clocks on the computer and said she wanted a sundial <br/>
(she&#39;s made this request before).  She got curious about the Obelisk <br/>
and wondered how people could tell time if it was so high up in the <br/>
air.  I told her we could make a sort of obelisk by using a stick or <br/>
something and marking the time with chalk on our sidewalk.  I noticed <br/>
the paper towel holder which is on a stand so I grabbed that and we <br/>
headed outside.  She is excited about marking the time each hour.<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that she wants to know more about how we know nowadays <br/>
how to set our clock.  I googled Greenwich but I just couldn&#39;t come up <br/>
with anything that would show pictures (we found pictures of the <br/>
outside of The Royal Observatory in Greenwich, London but no pictures <br/>
of the inside or anything to do with any kind of Main Clock or <br/>
something that everyone sets their clocks and watches to) or <br/>
information that would be good for a kid.  <br/>
<br/>
This is, of course, leading to the Prime Meridian and I&#39;m not sure how <br/>
to go about helping her understand this.  Help!  I checked our library <br/>
website and couldn&#39;t find any books or videos on this subject.  Does <br/>
anyone have any links or ideas to help me help my daugher?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997426716">I just found a book at the library book sale called &quot;It&#39;s About Time.&quot;  <br/>
It&#39;s by Marilyn Burns, from the Brown Paper School series.  It is <br/>
copyright 1978 (which was a good year, for some of us), but still has <br/>
lots of useful information about time that I imagine is, ahem, timeless-<br/>
-history of time and time zones, circadian rhythms in people and <br/>
animals, stuff like that.  I notice that copies are available on Amazon <br/>
starting at 26 cents.</div>
