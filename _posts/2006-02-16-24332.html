<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840864859">Hi,<br/>
I joined recently but hadn&#39;t gotten around to posting an intro yet.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been enjoying reading the posts and have already learned quite <br/>
a bit.  I&#39;ve been mostly unschooling my 3 kids (8, 6, and 4) but <br/>
still need help in some areas.  We don&#39;t do any school work type <br/>
things and I think I mostly need help adjusting my attitude in other <br/>
areas.  I am also on the unschooling basics list and have finally <br/>
been making more time to read posts.  In the last couple of days <br/>
alone some of the discussions have really made me change my attitude <br/>
towards chores.  I realized I have been nagging my kids about <br/>
picking up all the stuff they leave around.  I think the main <br/>
turning point was a couple of days ago I asked my youngest to please <br/>
pick up all the stuff he had set up around the house for his &quot;indoor <br/>
yard sale&quot;.  His response:  &quot;But mom I haven&#39;t finished my yard sale <br/>
yet&quot;.  I asked him if he wanted some help.  He wanted me to be a <br/>
customer so I picked out several things I wanted to &quot;buy&quot;.  After <br/>
paying for my purchase I asked him if now I could put those things <br/>
away.  He said &quot;They are yours now so you can put them away&quot;.  My dd <br/>
decided she would also make purchases and then she put those things <br/>
away.  After lunch he said he was closing up and we put the rest of <br/>
the things away together.  It was so much fun!  I then went into <br/>
each room and tidied up a bit and really enjoyed thinking about <br/>
everything they had learned from each little mess I cleared away.  <br/>
It wasn&#39;t even that hard working around all the legos still in use.  <br/>
It turned out to be a great day, the house looked so much better at <br/>
the end of the day and I was free of the stress from nagging about <br/>
the mess.  I&#39;m looking forward to more days like this.<br/>

I can remember days (years ago) when I went to bed angry or  <br/>
frustrated because nobody appreciated me and kids were lazy or  <br/>
whatever negative thing I was thinking that day.  It&#39;s MUCH better no  <br/>
(and the house is cleaner too), and we all LIKE each other, and  <br/>
people say &quot;thank you&quot; a lot.<br/>
<br/>
Peace is more important than clean dishes, and people *can* have both.<br/>

You know, there was some point in our journey that I realized all the<br/>
energy spent trying to get other people to do tasks, took MORE energy<br/>
than doing the task itself.<br/>
Once I realized this, it really freed me up to just DO the task and<br/>
fill the house with positive energy.:)  I still see my dh do this<br/>
occasionally. Trying to find out WHO left the milk out and making them<br/>
come put it away. It takes several minutes, when putting the milk away<br/>
would have taken him 3 seconds!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-688696915">This sounds like me, only it was just last week!  It really is reassuring that even you have been there.  You give me hope.<br/>
A couple of years ago you responded to a whiny post of mine (on another list).  My kids were 5, 3, and 1 at the time.  You told me that eventually they would dress themselves and go to the bathroom alone, etc. (and you were right!)    I was having a really bad day and your response really did help.  Not sure if I ever thanked you.....thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776036287">Yes, yes, yes!  This is exactly what I am talking about!  This is the very loud bell that has just recently gone off in my head.  I have people like you to thank for it, Ren.<br/>
Just tonight DH went outside where the kids were playing to find out who left the fridge open and he didn&#39;t close it before going outside!  But I must admit that I have done similar things and he is the one who calls me on it.  We will eventually get there together.  I&#39;m feeling so enlightened.<br/>

You&#39;re welcome.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m feeling frustrated and whiney with my own children, I  <br/>
sometimes remind myself that they do dress themselves and go to the  <br/>
bathroom alone, and breathe in a big breath of gratitude that they  <br/>
can do so.  Some parents are not so fortunate.<br/>
<br/>
My kids aren&#39;t perfect, but they&#39;re capable of taking care of their  <br/>
own needs in so many ways that my life is conveniently simple  <br/>
compared to many.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>==========================<br/>
<br/>
When my kids did get to the point that they were learning on their  <br/>
own, and learning things they might not even have shared with me, at  <br/>
least I was still involved by cleaning up after them, replenishing  <br/>
their supplies, making sure the tape or scissors or whatever were  <br/>
where they could find them the next time, etc.<br/>
<br/>
In the model of &quot;The Open Classroom,&quot; that&#39;s one of the main tasks of  <br/>
the teachers, is keeping the &quot;learning centers&quot; appealing and  <br/>
functional and safe.   Getting kids to help is possible sometimes,  <br/>
but it&#39;s not the kids&#39; &quot;job&quot; to do that, at school, ultimately.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that part of the &quot;job of an unschooling parent&quot; is to  <br/>
make sure it&#39;s easy for their kids to learn.  Sometimes that involves  <br/>
maintaining learning stations, even if we don&#39;t think of them in  <br/>
those terms so overtly.<br/>
<br/>
If the kitchen is clean and there are staples, people can cook.  If  <br/>
clothes are clean and in good repair, kids can be creative with what  <br/>
they wear, and make good choices about what&#39;s good for the day&#39;s  <br/>
weather and activities (rather than having to wear the only clean  <br/>
thing).   If the swingset is working, or the trampoline, or  <br/>
whatever&#39;s out in the yard.. if the bicycle has air in the tires and  <br/>
a chain...     Well, you know.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby took their armor and went with Keith and Holly to  <br/>
Arizona.  Yesterday after they left, I saw that Marty had left his  <br/>
mouth guards.  Marty has expensive braces, and getting hit in the  <br/>
face (having one&#39;s helm push into his face from a blow with a rattan  <br/>
weapon) could be very painful, and not good for the whole teeth-and- <br/>
braces project.  I found someone to take them out there, and then  <br/>
made another call to find someone who was leaving here even sooner.   <br/>
Kirby called and said he had forgotten his cup.  So that went too.   <br/>
They have them by now.   They could have bought more of both of those  <br/>
at some store in Phoenix, but Keith wanted to get out there and set  <br/>
up several large complicated canvas tents before dark.  This saved  <br/>
money and trouble of finding a store (in a strange city, with a large  <br/>
van pulling a trailer), and it was a way for me to add to the fun and  <br/>
learning that will happen for Kirby and Marty this weekend.  They get  <br/>
to participate in combat tactics with large groups�hundreds on a  <br/>
side.   Kirby wouldn&#39;t be allowed on the field without a cup.  Marty  <br/>
could go out without a mouth guard but I&#39;m glad he won&#39;t have to.  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t shame them about forgetting the things.  Keith and I have  <br/>
forgotten lots of things over the years.  I just assisted.<br/>
<br/>
Whose line was it that she &quot;creates a clean canvas&quot;?   Deb Lewis  <br/>
maybe?  It&#39;s creating a clean canvas, or restocking the shop between  <br/>
jobs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-239291308">Sandra, it sounds like your family may be participating in either the<br/>
Renaissance Festival here, or the Estrella War maybe? In any case, I live<br/>
not too far from either and if your guys want a house to freshen up in or<br/>
hang out in or shower in or whatever, they can come over. We consist of 17yo<br/>
ds, 16 yo ds, 13yo dd and 12 yo ds, dh, my mother, and me. A big house with<br/>
lots of video games, board games, food, and a few animals.<br/>
<br/>
We are planning to go to Estrella tomorrow. We&#39;re psyched! I&#39;ll send you my<br/>
phone number offlist if they want to come at any time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1825074861">Wow, my first emails from this list and people are talking SCA talk, how<br/>
cool!<br/>
 <br/>
My intro,  I am Leslie---or in the SCA, Marsaili ingen Domnaill.  I am a<br/>
SAHM to 6 children--one girl-17 and 5 boys-16, 14, 9, 7 and 3 months old.  I<br/>
homeschooled my children for 3 years about 3 years ago but my marriage ended<br/>
and I had to go back to work full time so I wasn&#39;t able to homeschool<br/>
anymore.  2 years ago I met the man of my dreams and we have been together<br/>
ever since and he wants me to be a SAHM again (if that is what I<br/>
want---which I do!!) so I am able to homeschool again---which is great<br/>
because I REALLY dislike the public school system and I am tired of debating<br/>
issues with teachers, principals and counselors.<br/>
 <br/>
We live in the Barony of the Cleftlands---in the Middle Kingdom.<br/>
(Cleveland, Ohio for all you non-scadians)  I am homeschooling 3 of my boys,<br/>
the 14, 9 and 7 year olds---the 14 year old may go to high school next year<br/>
if he wants to--which he has said he is interested in but I&#39;m hoping we can<br/>
get him interested in staying home. My older kids are both juniors and I<br/>
felt that since they made it through high school this far, they should<br/>
graduate with their friends, which is what they wanted to do anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
We haven&#39;t been too involved in the SCA in a couple years because I was<br/>
working so much (I just stopped working in October, right before the baby<br/>
was born)  I am hoping to rekindle the family&#39;s interest in the SCA again--<br/>
to start attending meetings and events---maybe even possibly going to<br/>
Pennsic---it&#39;s been 3 years and I&#39;m having withdrawals!<br/>
 <br/>
Ok, that&#39;s a bunch about me and us---right now I am concentrating on reading<br/>
about different styles of learning--I just bought a bunch of John Holt&#39;s<br/>
books off of Amazon and I am eagerly awaiting them as well as some other<br/>
popular homeschooling books.  I am looking forward to meeting you all and<br/>
hopefully learning a lot from you and adding what I can with what little<br/>
experience I have!<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
We used to go to fighter practice in the Barony of Arenal (Pensacola)<br/>
a while back.  I really didn&#39;t care for the P&#39;cola group, but did meet<br/>
a few very cool folks there and had fun attending some feasts and such.<br/>
<br/>
The kids interest waned, but recently Sierra asked me about going<br/>
back. We still have the basic garb and feast gear we got started with.<br/>
I just found the local group and their fighter practice isn&#39;t very far<br/>
from our home. So we may become SCA folks again....with the exception<br/>
of my dh, who just doesn&#39;t quite get it.<br/>

&gt; When my kids did get to the point that they were learning on their  <br/>
&gt; own, and learning things they might not even have shared with me, at  <br/>
&gt; least I was still involved by cleaning up after them, replenishing  <br/>
&gt; their supplies, making sure the tape or scissors or whatever were  <br/>
&gt; where they could find them the next time, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the model of &quot;The Open Classroom,&quot; that&#39;s one of the main tasks of  <br/>
&gt; the teachers, is keeping the &quot;learning centers&quot; appealing and  <br/>
&gt; functional and safe.   Getting kids to help is possible sometimes,  <br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s not the kids&#39; &quot;job&quot; to do that, at school, ultimately.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems to me that part of the &quot;job of an unschooling parent&quot; is to  <br/>
&gt; make sure it&#39;s easy for their kids to learn.  Sometimes that involves  <br/>
&gt; maintaining learning stations, even if we don&#39;t think of them in  <br/>
&gt; those terms so overtly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If the kitchen is clean and there are staples, people can cook.  If  <br/>
&gt; clothes are clean and in good repair, kids can be creative with what  <br/>
&gt; they wear, and make good choices about what&#39;s good for the day&#39;s  <br/>
&gt; weather and activities (rather than having to wear the only clean  <br/>
&gt; thing).   If the swingset is working, or the trampoline, or  <br/>
&gt; whatever&#39;s out in the yard.. if the bicycle has air in the tires and  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Did you know that you don&#39;t have to teach them to clean?<br/>
<br/>
Many of the products we use today weren&#39;t around when we were growing up, <br/>
and certainly weren&#39;t around when our parents were growing up.   We learned <br/>
to use them by watching the commercials, buying the stuff and reading the <br/>
directions on the back.<br/>
<br/>
When someone says they are going to &quot;be teaching them how to perform many <br/>
of the cleaning functions in the house&quot;, that usually means something else <br/>
than just showing them once how to clean a toilet or a bathtub.  Usually <br/>
what it really means is making kids help keep the house up to Mom&#39;s (or <br/>
Dad&#39;s) standards, without Mom having to do all the work to reach those <br/>
standards.<br/>
<br/>
I think if I couldn&#39;t keep the house up to my standards by myself, maybe I <br/>
should lower my standards rather than impose them on someone else.  Or hire <br/>
a cleaning service.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077885333">I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve posted here yet, so here&#39;s a quick intro:<br/>
I&#39;m a first-time mom to 9mo Dmitri and live in upstate NY with dh Joe.  I&#39;m<br/>
on a number of unschooling lists and find that a lot of what is discussed<br/>
guides me in my day-to-day life with Dmitri.  So much of what is said<br/>
regarding living with young people also applies to living and learning with<br/>
the very young.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; My kids are 7-1/2 (fraternal twin boys) and I expect that they can<br/>
pick up their own rooms (we do this every night before bed so that it<br/>
never gets to the point of being overwhelming for them.)  And if they<br/>
leave their shoes, blankets, or whatever in the family room, I do make<br/>
them come get them and put them in their room.&gt;&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
Wow, twin boys! I imagine there&#39;s lots of fun chaos at your house.<br/>
<br/>
If they are always picking up their rooms at your direction, how will they<br/>
ever distinguish when to pick up their rooms from natural motivation?  I am<br/>
still sorting out cleaning issues after being directed to clean my room on a<br/>
regular basis in my youth.  I certainly learned how to keep a clean house,<br/>
and I also learned how to have torturous, judgmental thoughts about having a<br/>
clean house.  I would have loved it if my mother could have realized that<br/>
she could have worked with me, not as my adversary.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But I definitely do<br/>
most of the rest of the housework because I am always &quot;finishing the<br/>
job to MY SATISFACTION&quot;, but I will be teaching them how to perform<br/>
many of the cleaning functions in the house.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I do all of the housework here for a variety of reasons--dh works FT, I have<br/>
higher standards for cleaning so I clean to make myself happy, and we play<br/>
to our natural strengths (mine is cleaning, dh&#39;s is cooking).  I&#39;m wondering<br/>
if parents need to overtly teach kids how to do housework.  Dmitri is<br/>
already fascinated with the process of doing the laundry. &lt;g&gt;  I remember<br/>
having a burning desire (no pun intended) to be able to use the iron and to<br/>
use the washer and dryer.  I had no burning desire to do the things my<br/>
mother forced me to do.<br/>

picked up!  And they expect me to tip-toe around all of the junk on<br/>
the floor to put them to bed at night?!  No way.  My rule is simple -<br/>
if the floor is not picked up so that I don&#39;t risk stepping on<br/>
something and hurting my foot, then I can&#39;t read to them of tuck them<br/>
into bed.  The rest of the room is definitely not how I would LIKE to<br/>
see it. And sometimes I do clean off the top of a nightstand or<br/>
dresser because *I* can&#39;t stand to look at it.  Of course, they don&#39;t<br/>
always like that because I am likely to throw something away that they<br/>
wanted to keep - like a stick or rock or some such thing!<br/>

something that I specifically asked/told them to do because I agree -<br/>

will I overtly finish a job.  Something like &quot;after you clean the<br/>

agree with you.  But as a full-time working mom, I don&#39;t think I<br/>
should also HAVE TO BE the full-time maid. I was raised, and believe<br/>
it to be true in my house now, that everyone who lives in the house<br/>
and makes the messes should pitch-in to help clean up the messes.  My<br/>
dh also does all of the cooking/kitchen cleaning, with me only once in<br/>
a while cleaning the kitchen for him.  I do all of the &quot;kid stuff&quot; in<br/>
the evenings while he is in the kitchen (we both work full-time at the<br/>
moment.)  My kids are not on any regular chore schedule or chore<br/>
chart, but when I see something that needs to be done that I think<br/>
they could do to help, I tell them it&#39;s time to pitch-in and help to<br/>
benefit everyone.<br/>

<br/>
That wasn&#39;t stated; you wrote that out of your own self.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can learn to clean without &quot;being made&quot; to clean, for one thing,  <br/>
and I was talking about what makes unschooling work well, and having  <br/>
resources and space helps unschooling work well.<br/>
<br/>
Over the years my own views on chores changed due to discussions on  <br/>
this list and UnschoolingDiscussion, from ideas some moms had who  <br/>
were honestly getting along better at their houses than we were.   <br/>
I&#39;ve collected some of the best writings here.  It seems odd at  <br/>
first, but created outcomes I never could have imagined.<br/>

&gt; growing up,<br/>
&gt; and certainly weren&#39;t around when our parents were growing up.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>==========================<br/>
<br/>
I agree entirely.<br/>
<br/>
I figured out how to clean my wooden hottub efficiently and well,  <br/>
through trial and error.  I change methods from time to time, just to  <br/>
give the wood the benefit of a different treatment—sometimes bleach,  <br/>
sometimes 409, sometimes just a hard spray of water if it wasn&#39;t too  <br/>
dirty.  Once I used dish soap, and probably will again at least once  <br/>
when summer comes.  No one taught me that, and there&#39;s some tricky  <br/>
business to cleaning a big barrel with a fence inside it and an  <br/>
underwater stove.  I clean it every week, and it&#39;s fun.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s former job involved cleaning a leatherworking shop.<br/>
His current job involves cleaning up breaks and spills in a grocery  <br/>
store, sweeping, and cleaning toilets.   He picked it up very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby used to work at a gaming shop.  He vacuumed voluntarily before  <br/>
he ever worked there.  Holly used to go and vacuum sometimes to help  <br/>
him clean up after he was hired.  He dusted, swept, maintained  <br/>
cardboard recycling and dumpster runs, kept a storage shed organized,  <br/>
and cleaned bathrooms.  No training for any of that, just native  <br/>
intelligence and having seen other people use those simple tools.<br/>
<br/>
His current job has a backpack vacuum like the Ghostbusters, and he  <br/>
helps clean and organize an  industrial kitchen, in the course of  <br/>
working at a pizza restaurant.<br/>

enjoying reading and learning!  I had to comment on this, though.  I <br/>
have to agree; we don&#39;t have to teach our kids how to clean.  I never <br/>
cleaned, washed clothes, or cooked until I got married at the age of <br/>
27.  I&#39;m 39 now and I have to tell you that I&#39;ve never ruined a load <br/>
of clothes (my washing machine explains how to seperate clothes right <br/>
on the lid!)  I haven&#39;t ruined any meals (I started simple and I used <br/>
the cookbooks I got for wedding gifts) and I can run a vacuum and <br/>
dust with the best of them!<br/>
<br/>
My mother felt that I would have to &quot;grow up&quot; soon enough. She <br/>
believed in letting me be a kid until I needed to be an adult.  <br/>
Amazingly for the times, she believed that when that time came, I <br/>
would be able to rise to the occasion.  Things seem to be going well <br/>
and my dad recently told my dh that they were very proud of me and <br/>
that I was a great mom and wife.  Dh seems to agree.<br/>

they thought it was taking up too much room in your closet?<br/>

Our children learn to respect others only when we as parents can show <br/>
them respect.  That has to be the core of our relationship with our <br/>
children.  A child is just as important as an adult.  They depend on <br/>
us to protect them and advocate for their rights.  That starts in our <br/>
own home.  imho<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can say for myself that I didn&#39;t have any chores as a child or teen. We<br/>
had a maid that cleaned and did our laundry. I left home not knowing how to<br/>
cook or clean. Today and almost any day of the week you can literally eat<br/>
off my floors. I taught myself out of necessity and desire. I also think<br/>
that I got used to having a clean home as a child and am uncomfortable in<br/>
anything else. I have a friend that was made to do a lot of chores as a<br/>
child and her house is filthy to the point of being unhealthy. My point is<br/>
that, in my experience, forcing chores on a child will not ensure that they<br/>
learn anything of value and they may often see housework as drudgery and<br/>
something to be avoided. I do ask my children to help me by cleaning up<br/>
after themselves and most of the time they do. If they forget I do it for<br/>
them just as I would for dh or a guest in our home. *I* am the one who wants<br/>
a neat and clean home. If I have a problem with the messes it is *MY*<br/>
problem. I have no right to push my issues or discomfort on others. I want<br/>
my family to have a clean and comfortable home to live in. It is my gift to<br/>
them. It is no longer a gift when I demand that they reciprocate. Who could<br/>
appreciate a gift like that?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Wow, this just kind of made me sad thinking about the kids putting <br/>
themselves to bed because their room isn&#39;t clear. I can totally <br/>
understand and empathize how much it *hurts* to step on little kid toys, <br/>
having done it myself, and one of the things I ask my girls to do is to <br/>
clear a path when they want tucked in or when they want to fall asleep <br/>
with me and be carried in later--though making a nest on our bedroom <br/>
floor is always a popular option, too. I&#39;ve found finding a way to work <br/>
together to create a solution that works for everyone to be way better <br/>
for living joyfully than creating rules.<br/>
<br/>
This also reminded me of a recent post regarding &quot;mean moms&quot; that I <br/>
tweaked a bit and rewrote, a section of which addressed room cleaning <br/>
specifically....<br/>
<br/>
Someone on Ubasics posted this blurb that was circulating and being <br/>
celebrated on a local list of hers. I re-wrote it from my own <br/>
perspective and wanted to share that here as well...<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;<br/>

 &gt;   that motivates parents, you will tell them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>****************************************************<br/>
Just for kicks, I wanted to write this out as it would look for me....<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Someday, when my children are older, I will tell them:<br/>
<br/>
I loved you enough to care about where you were going, with whom, and <br/>
what time you&#39;d be home and to help you get there, have fun, and come home.<br/>
<br/>
I loved you enough to be silent when you needed me to be silent and to <br/>
be there when you needed to talk, to give you the space to discover for <br/>
yourself who your true friends were and to help you pick up the pieces <br/>
when you were hurt.<br/>
<br/>
I loved you enough to help you pay for the bubble gum you wanted and to <br/>
make things right when they felt wrong.<br/>
<br/>
I loved you enough to stand by you for a lifetime, to be by your side <br/>
for two hours while we cleaned your room, a job that would have taken me <br/>
15 minutes, but the conversation was too precious to lose.<br/>
<br/>
You learned that I wasn&#39;t perfect as we shared our lives together.<br/>
<br/>
I loved you enough to let you make choices even when the stakes were <br/>
high and to help bear your burden whenever I could.<br/>
<br/>
But most of all, I loved you enough to always help you get what you <br/>
needed, to put our relationship first and to walk in your shoes instead <br/>
of engaging in battles.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you came to me, because in the end, you&#39;ve helped me grow and <br/>
become a better person, so I won, too, in this relationship.<br/>
<br/>
And someday, when your children are old enough to understand the <br/>
principles that guide this legacy of parenting, I hope you tell them how <br/>
they helped you grow and become a better person.<br/>
