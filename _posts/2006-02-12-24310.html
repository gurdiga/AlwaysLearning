<div id="ygrps-yiv-234323287">&lt;&lt;Is there any way to encourage his interests more?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest stopping the required journaling.  I love spending time with my animals, really LOVE spending time with my animals.  I get lost in it and spend much more time than necessary on feeding, talking, grooming, training, medicating, etc..  It is something that is mine, that I can and do share with others but don&#39;t have to.  I don&#39;t know that I would feel the same about it if someone else were reading about it.  I might be more self-conscious that I was doing it &quot;right&quot; rather than doing what feels right to me.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling, in its current definition, means to live as though there were no such thing as school.  To simply ignore that aspect of our society.  Would you ask your son to journal if there was no such thing as school, if tomorrow (future test scores, college entrance) weren&#39;t where you were focused?  Live for today, let today be fun and carefree and tomorrow really does take care of itself.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;show progress&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember when your son was very small and you took lots of pictures and made notes in his baby book?  It didn&#39;t involve him at all.  It was your joy to notice new things that he noticed, to help him reach things he couldn&#39;t quite reach by himself and then rejoicing with him when he finally got it independently.  You can still do that.  You can still have that enthusiasm in watching him grow and learn and you can document it without him being involved at all.  Many, many unschoolers use portfolios to show progress to authorities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417409684">Hi Rhonda,<br/>
 My name is Julie and we live in central Arkansas. You have to remember<br/>
that EVERYTHING they do is learning in some format or another!!!! Cooking<br/>
is math, reading and science. Teaching them how to use the ATM machine is<br/>
math and reading and money concepts. My 2 year old already helps gather<br/>
laundry and brings the little trash cans to empty into the big trash<br/>
cans. When we put the laundry away it becomes a catching game with the<br/>
socks, I throw them to my 2 year old and she throws them to her big<br/>
brother so they are both learning hand eye coordination. We do also read<br/>
a lot (I even got a Christmas card from the library because we check so<br/>
many things out!!! Videos as well as books.) There are a lot of<br/>
educational videos available like the NOVA series on PBS and Nature<br/>
videos, history of wars and ancient civilizations etc. My son is a very<br/>
visual learner so we watch a lot of learning videos and he doesn&#39;t even<br/>
miss regular TV. We have never watched cartoons unless they were learning<br/>
or religious cartoons or on PBS. We don&#39;t own a play station etc. and the<br/>
only games he has for the computer are actually teaching games like the<br/>
Jump Start series etc. Right now he is &quot;playing&quot; a 4th grade geometry cd.<br/>
We Un school so pretty much anything goes at our house. We do LOTS of<br/>
nature study and the kids garden with their Grannie. My son plays golf<br/>
with his Grandpa so that is PE as well as swimming hours every day during<br/>
the summer. <br/>
<br/>
You just have to start rethinking everything you do and see it as a<br/>
learning tool. Believe me it gets easier as you go along taking advantage<br/>
of every situation to turn it into a learning experience. (I hated it<br/>
when I was a kid and my parents would say the standard lines of &quot;because<br/>
I said so&quot; or &quot;because I&#39;m the boss&quot; instead of explaining what ever it<br/>
was I had a question to. I think people alienate their children when they<br/>
don&#39;t take the time to really connect with their kids and explain &quot;Life&quot;<br/>
to them. Children tend to grow up feeling resentment and anger towards<br/>
their parents when the parents don&#39;t &quot;bother&quot; to treat their children&#39;s<br/>
questions as something valid and worth explaining. The only stupid<br/>
question is the one that isn&#39;t asked!)  It was really easy for me at<br/>
first to have that public school attitude of having to sit down and &quot;do<br/>
your home work&quot; but for us that just doesn&#39;t work all the time. (Don&#39;t<br/>
get me wrong, he does have to do work books and hand writing but I don&#39;t<br/>
force the issue and usually tell him if he wants to watch a non-learning<br/>
video he has to do at least 10 pages in one of his work books. More if it<br/>
is a really long movie. hee hee hee And I usually don&#39;t get the attitude<br/>
when we do it this way!)  He can learn his times tables bouncing a ball<br/>
against the barn wall faster and easier than having to &quot;sit still and<br/>
focus&quot;. It is amazing what he can remember when I make it fun or a game.<br/>
By 2 1/2 he knew how to say carbonation and knew it meant &quot;bubbles in the<br/>
coke&quot; and knew that the flashlight reflected off the windows at night and<br/>
that reflection also meant his image in the mirror. People don&#39;t realize<br/>
that just because a child cannot verbally communicate so that WE can<br/>
understand him, doesn&#39;t mean that they don&#39;t understand what is said to<br/>
them or what is going on around them. My baby will be 2 on the 18th of<br/>
February but already can follow a three part sentence of &quot;go over there,<br/>
pick that up and put it away&quot; of course I am more specific and tell her<br/>
exactly where and what to do but you get my meaning. She also knows quite<br/>
a few signs so she can communicate with her hands. This was really<br/>
helpful about a year ago and up to this point when she didn&#39;t have as<br/>
many verbal skills. But now she has about a 500 word vocabulary. Of<br/>
course Mommie is usually the only person who can understand and translate<br/>
but she is using so many new words on a daily basis it amazes me! She<br/>
also understands more and hears more than you think she would at this<br/>
age. (and repeats everything!!!) She was across the room from my husband<br/>
and I this morning and I told hubby with a lowered voice that they could<br/>
go down later while I was taking a nap and get the paper and yesterdays<br/>
mail. Well she dropped her toy and came running saying &quot;ail ail&quot; she<br/>
knows we usually drive the car to the mail box because it is about 1/4<br/>
mile away from the house and she loves going for a ride and wasn&#39;t going<br/>
to miss out! Especially since it was with her Daddy! <br/>
<br/>
We are blessed to live in a state that has so much freedom to teach our<br/>
children. I am definitely learning too as we go along. I went to public<br/>
school until the end of 9th grade then transferred to a private Catholic<br/>
school for 10th thru 12th. But I seem to be learning A LOT of things that<br/>
either weren&#39;t taught or I just don&#39;t remember being taught. Our favorite<br/>
part of home schooling is the freedom to pursue whatever we want to<br/>
study.  We love snuggling upon the couch with hot chocolate and a book or<br/>
educational video in the winter and doing most of our school work outside<br/>
when it is spring and summer.  Try checking out 4H and your local<br/>
community center but also other town&#39;s community centers and home school<br/>
groups. I belong to at least 5 or 6 local groups within a 40 mile radius<br/>
and either get a news letter or and e-mail of what&#39;s going on and I have<br/>
quite a few &quot;just e-mail&quot; groups to get advice, support and adult<br/>
conversation! lol We drove 45 minutes the other day to another city that<br/>
was offering a FREE 3 to 4 hour archery class. I took my 10 year old son<br/>
and his 8 year old cousin and they both had a blast. Because we only had<br/>
gas expenses it was worth the trip and they boys learned quite a bit<br/>
(remember to always take snacks so you don&#39;t have to eat out unless that<br/>
is part of the treat too). We are lucky that so many of our small little<br/>
towns have their own group activities so we don&#39;t have to drive to far to<br/>
do things on a weekly basis. But that doesn&#39;t stop us from taking a road<br/>
trip when the time is right or it is really something cool we have been<br/>
wanting to do. Especially if it is free!!! lol<br/>
<br/>
The greatest advice to newer home schoolers is cherish every single day<br/>
with your children even if you don&#39;t think you got anything done.  They<br/>
grow up too fast!  There is never enough time to learn everything that<br/>
there is to learn in the world, so don&#39;t worry about it. Like I said<br/>
before I am also learning so much more than I ever did in school. And if<br/>
I don&#39;t know we can always look it up on the Internet. It has been a<br/>
wealth of information that we have used so many many times from<br/>
everything to cooking recipes to how to make a catapult and everything in<br/>
between!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps some.<br/>
Blessings,<br/>
Julie C.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Right.  And more and more are using blogs to keep records (with  <br/>
photos, sometimes) of what they have done.<br/>
<br/>
No journal, portfolio or blog, though, should be just about what your  <br/>
son is doing while you watch, but should include things you did  <br/>
together and things he did with other people.<br/>
<br/>
If you go here and click on the unschooling blog ring link (lower  <br/>
right) you can look at other unschooler&#39;s blogs.  I think from that  <br/>
page you can start your own blog too, if you don&#39;t already have one,  <br/>
but there are other and lots of blog sites.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com</a><br/>
Or you could start from one of these:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have never had to keep records, but you will see some other blogs  <br/>
that do more resemble documentation of busy unschooling lives.<br/>
<br/>
Another place to look for inspiration is this collection of  <br/>
descriptions of particular unschooling days from many families:<br/>

<br/>
Encourage his interests by taking interest in him and his interests,  <br/>
and by sharing your interests too, and expanding in any direction,  <br/>
and all directions.<br/>
<br/>
Here are ideas for starting to go about that:<br/>

  That might seem a small tweak, but it&#39;s like standing at edge of  <br/>
the grand canyon.  If you have your back to the canyon you&#39;ll still  <br/>

If you have never watched cartoons unless they were &quot;learning  <br/>

experience seems much smaller, because there is no cartoon that will  <br/>
not be in some way &quot;a learning cartoon.&quot;  The most learning that  <br/>

I did a workshop on questions once with Richard Prystowsky, and he  <br/>
suggested (if I remember correctly) that a stupid qustion was one to  <br/>
which the questioner knew the answer, and just wanted to see if the  <br/>
other person knew.  Quizzes.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes a question the questioner could have figured out on his own  <br/>
can be a bad question (It&#39;s not helpful to call things &quot;stupid&quot; if it  <br/>
can be easily avoided).<br/>
Sometimes a question asked solely to keep a conversation going,  <br/>
without any thought to whether it would be irritating to the other  <br/>
person is a less-than-brilliant question.<br/>
<br/>
To recite what others have said about questions without *really*  <br/>
analyzing that in the light of unschooling and interpersonal  <br/>
relationships isn&#39;t rethinking everything.<br/>

They said &quot;be your child&#39;s partner, not his adversary.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a mother feels she is tricking her child, or laughs at his  <br/>
struggle, or is making him earn privileges, she is not being his  <br/>
partner.  She is being his taskmaster and adversary.   If a child can  <br/>
only win by the mother losing (definition of an adversarial  <br/>
relationship), frustration is ahead for both.<br/>

<br/>
-=-We love snuggling upon the couch with hot chocolate and a book or<br/>
educational video in the winter and doing most of our school work  <br/>
outside<br/>
when it is spring and summer. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There are thousands of better things to do outside than schoolwork,  <br/>
and the relationship built between parents and children who share  <br/>
learning experiences—REAL ones— is larger and deeper than any  <br/>
curriculum in the world.<br/>
<br/>
There will be time for schoolwork when you&#39;re dead, and if not...  <br/>
well, you won&#39;t need it then anyway.<br/>
<br/>
There is time for learning every moment, but that joy will die with  <br/>
too much schoolwork (no matter where on your property you are when  <br/>
the schoolwork is happening).<br/>

&gt; &gt; Hi.  My name is Rhonda.  I live in Missouri, and started homeschooling<br/>
&gt; &gt; my son,13, about a year ago.  At first, I tried things from books, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; workbooks.  I have found he is bored with that, and is learning more<br/>
&gt; &gt; by doing things he likes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; He has learned a lot about dinosaurs, and space.  He is also very<br/>
&gt; &gt; interested in planes, monster trucks, and space shuttles.  He builds<br/>
&gt; &gt; with legos a lot, and also has some other models he has put together.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have him write in a journal about what he is doing, and about<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever he feels like writing about.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My question is, how do I know if he is learning enough?  Is there any<br/>
&gt; &gt; way to encourage his interests more?  I live in a state where I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; supposed to document 1000 hours per school year of instruction, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; keep grades, or some alternative way of showing his progress.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder how I can do that with him directing his studies.  Any  <br/>
&gt; &gt; suggestions?<br/>
&gt; &gt; He seems less bored with what he is doing than he ever did with  <br/>
&gt; &gt; bookwork.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for any helpful suggestions.<br/>

you *are* forcing it.  If he can&#39;t do what he wants until he has satisfied <br/>
your requirements for school, then you are not unschooling.<br/>

school-at-home.<br/>
<br/>
You said, &quot;You have to remember that EVERYTHING they do is learning in some <br/>

<br/>
We went to the park last spring and there was a family with 4 boys there, <br/>
as well as several children playing on the playground.   Aaron was so <br/>
excited to see that there would be lots of playmates there.   But the mom <br/>
said they couldn&#39;t play until they finished their schoolwork.  So they sat <br/>
at the picnic table and did school workbooks for an hour, being redirected <br/>
back to their books if they stopped to watch the other kids having fun, <br/>
while the baby sister sat in her stroller.  Every time the baby fussed she <br/>
got flicked on the leg.<br/>
<br/>
How sad not to be able to enjoy the warm weather, to not be able to use <br/>
their bodies to run and jump and play, to use their minds to create an <br/>
imaginary world of pirates or Star Wars or Swiss Family Robinson or The <br/>
Jetsons, to not be able to interact with the other children and form <br/>
friendships and make teams and work co-operatively.<br/>

&gt;there is to learn in the world, so don&#39;t worry about it. Like I said<br/>
&gt;before I am also learning so much more than I ever did in school.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then why are you bringing school into your home?   Let go of the workbooks <br/>

<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sure it helped to show how not to unschool.  If this is your concept of <br/>
unschooling, then you need to read more, think more, and then read some <br/>
more.  Read Sandra&#39;s site.  Read John Holt.  Read Joyce&#39;s website.  Read <br/>
the archives at several different unschooling lists.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry this sounds like an attack.  But if you bring school-at-home and <br/>
coercive parenting to an unschooling list and try to insist that it is what <br/>
it is obviously not, it needs to be pointed out.  For your sake.  For your <br/>
children&#39;s sake.  For the other new unschoolers on the list&#39;s sakes.<br/>

Julie, you may feel badly right now.  After having had the noble and<br/>
enthusiastic intention of helping and contributing to a newcomer you got<br/>
some very honest and direct responses.  This list is full of wisdom, and I<br/>
learned both from your original post and from the responses to it.  I hope<br/>
you learn from the responses too, rather than feeling horrible/angry and<br/>
thereby not hearing their messages!  Remember, as parents we are &quot;always<br/>
learning&quot; too!!!!  <br/>
<br/>
I am shedding many layers of school-ish conditioning I have. There are days<br/>
that I am quietly fearful, and suddenly find myself requiring my son to do<br/>
school-ish activities (I sometimes think I have a split personality...the<br/>
school-marm sneaks in through the back door of my mind without me noticing<br/>
until I see Tobin&#39;s look of dread!).  This is very humbling for me, because<br/>
I have read Holt, I have read Sandra&#39;s work, and many others, and I thought<br/>
I grasped the philosophy at its core!  I thought that that knowledge would<br/>
flow out freely with little or no hick-ups because I really believed in it<br/>
all and had conviction...but the reality is that it is a bumpy process for<br/>
me.  I may be a beginner for a long time... (BTW, I am really enjoying the<br/>
unschoolingbasics group...  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolingbasics-subscribe@yahoogroups.com">unschoolingbasics-subscribe@yahoogroups.com</a>)<br/>
<br/>
Posting on this site is not for the faint at heart!  It will probably be<br/>
questioned or made clear if you make comments/suggestions that do not<br/>
resonate with unschooling philosophy.   (I do wish honesty could be gentler<br/>
sometimes...but would we hear the message???)  <br/>

him!  Just try to forget about the learning part when you can manage  <br/>
to do so. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Rent lots of DVDs together and let those be springboards for bringing  <br/>
music into the house, or needing maps or history (just touch it,  <br/>
don&#39;t STUDY it), or using IMDB.com or Amazon.com/s extensive lists  <br/>
and cross-lists to find related movies, and you can be discussing all  <br/>
KINDS of stuff in no time.<br/>
<br/>
Let him do his own thing sometimes, but don&#39;t depend on that for his  <br/>
whole &quot;education.&quot;  Spend more time with him doing things that you  <br/>
both enjoy.  Go more places, bring things into the house, visit  <br/>
people, bring people into the house... Mix it up!<br/>

keep thumb-tacked to the wall above my computer:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*This is Where Unschooling Lives* talk:<br/>
****************************<br/>
 From that place of knowing what&#39;s real and what&#39;s True as defined by my<br/>
children&#39;s hearts, I place my feet in the direction of the next right thing to<br/>
do and I move forward.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I find it extremely helpful to remember that this is actually my job <br/>
description<br/>
as an unschooling parent.  To trust in my children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In fact, here are some other things that I believe are in my job description:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
·       to help my children get what they need and desire in order to live a<br/>
joyful life;<br/>
<br/>
·       to nurture and encourage that which they love to do;<br/>
<br/>
·       to be a student of them, actually, and learn about them.learn from them<br/>
~ I have always loved being a student of my children;<br/>
<br/>
·       to learn about real learning, watching how the connections are made in<br/>
their lives from focusing on the Joy and allowing their lives and spirits to<br/>
unfold as they grow and learn.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It is my job to be the person who gives my children the freedom to really learn<br/>
by playing around with the world.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So if you find yourself unable to trust and if you&#39;re feeling the need to<br/>
control, make a conscious choice to change your job description!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Change it from being the controller of your children&#39;s lives to the one who<br/>
actively brings joy into their lives.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On our &quot;This is Where Unschooling Lives&quot; board, you&#39;ll see a bumper sticker <br/>
that<br/>
says, &quot;How can I connect with my children today, expand their worlds, bring joy<br/>
into their lives, nurture and encourage what they love to do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I made that bumper sticker at the request of Anna, from the Shine list, who <br/>
told<br/>
me that she kept going back to those words that I once wrote.  And I looked<br/>
again at it and thought, &quot;That&#39;s it!  Right there!  That&#39;s my job description!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Having those words on our board does the same for me as they do for Anna.they<br/>
put my job description right there in my sight every single day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I check in on it periodically to make sure I&#39;m fulfilling that which I feel is<br/>
my job as an unschooling parent.  I make sure that I&#39;m offering my children <br/>
more<br/>
than they would get in a classroom.  I check on it and decide from there what<br/>
the next right thing to do is.<br/>
