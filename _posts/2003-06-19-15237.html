<div id="ygrps-yiv-424788164">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been away from elists for awhile. Real life took me down many different adventures. Ashley finished 3rd grade at ps. She is now finished with going to school and planning the rest of her life. Things she found out were that she likes being given work to acomplish, likes striving for the best. Thinks her teacher was a really nice person. She is not fond of the playground dynamics. She wants more reading time. She made a few friends who she will keep in touch with. Ahhh. she came home.<br/>
<br/>
Riley and Tessa continue growing and unfolding all the time. Riley&#39;s top perm. teeth are poking through. Tessa feels so grown up at 3.5 and continues to nurse to sleep each night. We have been camping at Lake Tahoe and Indian Grinding Rock as well as Monterey this year. We adopted 2 guinea pigs, are bug sitting too many stickbugs, and will snakesit for a friend who is off to England. Our homeschool support keeps shifting and changing. One thing I do notice is I spend way more time with kids than I do adults these days. Feeling a bit out of touch with friends, yet bonding deeply with the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Two of my kids have big toe ouches. Bad ones. Makes me wonder about the put your shoes on rule that so many of the families I know have. My kids really have had the choice, unless going places were shoes are required. I want them to have shoes on more, yet don&#39;t force the issue. I always have their shoes with us. When out and about they all prefer to be barefooted. Riley also wiped out on his bike yesterday. Bandaids and ice. Loads of TV to pass the day while ouchy toes and skinned knees heal. Ashley is across the street at Girl Scout day camp for the week.<br/>
<br/>
I will be attending the LLLI conference for a day or 2 as well as HOME=ED. Conference in Sacto.(I am coordinating the little kids playroom at HOME=ED and could always have more volunteers). Anyone else out there going to these functions?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have this thing with shoes, too.  Will doesn&#39;t like to wear them, but he <br/>
will for certain reasons (baseball).  He also has a medical condition called <br/>
Raynaud&#39;s phenomenon, which causes his fingers and toes to be hypersensitive to <br/>
heat and cold.  It&#39;s painful and unpredictable.  So I just don&#39;t make him wear <br/>
shoes--but I DO make him wear gloves in the winter!  Strange, huh?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, his feet are like leather on the bottom.  They&#39;re not tender at all.  <br/>
He gets cuts on them sometimes and sometimes he doesn&#39;t even notice.  He can <br/>
run like the wind in the front yard and on the gravel driveway.  But if you <br/>
put him in baseball cleats and he gets a hit, it&#39;s like watching molasses run <br/>
the bases.  (Good thing he can hit it far!)  My dad grew up on a farm in that <br/>
&quot;one pair of shoes a year&quot; era.  So in warm weather he went without.  He sees <br/>
nothing at all wrong with no shoes on kids.<br/>
<br/>
But lots of people have a problem with it.  We went camping with our Camp <br/>
Fire council a few weeks ago and the new program director was going on and on at <br/>
the leader meeting about how she requires all CF kids to wear closed-toe shoes <br/>
at all times.  While I was sitting there in my Birks, and Will was playing <br/>
baseball with the Boy Scout troop across the field, running the bases in his <br/>
soccer slides.  I have a feeling this will be a point of contention with her at <br/>
day camp in two weeks!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think my point was that I suspect Will has developed some kind of <br/>
sixth-sense with regard to where his feet are at any given time.  He hardly <br/>
ever does hurt his feet.  He doesn&#39;t feel the sharpest rocks in the driveway, the <br/>
way I do.  I think it&#39;s because he rarely wears shoes.  Shoes are a modern <br/>
invention, you know?<br/>

Maybe you can find canvas baseball shoes a little loose on him.<br/>
I had a pair of used Loony-Toons high tops that I LOVED and wore for years, <br/>
until there were holes in the cloth.  <br/>
<br/>
I could tighten them at the ankle and the other parts weren&#39;t pushing on me <br/>
anywhere.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I so agree.  Jackson wears shoes all the time, with the exception of bed and <br/>
shower.  He was raised on a farm so I can see where that might be important.  <br/>
He just doesn&#39;t understand why I love our silk Persian and Turkish rugs.  <br/>
Sooooo soft and cool on the feet.  Gotta love it.  And Why I love to walk in the <br/>
grass barefoot (guess that really comes from the farm LOL).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know what I thought might work?  Running shoes...those really thin shoes <br/>
that marathon runners wear.  I haven&#39;t been to look, because I always forget <br/>
about them when it&#39;s time for baseball.  But I think the good running he does <br/>
when barefoot is based on his whole foot being able to feel the ground, and <br/>
those running shoes might give him that kind of feeling.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone familiar with running shoes?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1206994712">We&#39;ve always been barefoot people around here.  All our shoes live at the front door, or in the car. Gary grew up all over -- his Dad was in the AirForce -- but his folks are from Hawaii, where most everyone goes barefoot.  The only shoes anyone wears are flip-flops.  <br/>
 <br/>
We lived in outside a very small town in Oklahoma until I was about 12, and were barefoot 24/7 from March 1 to late October.  I remember taking a note to school each March that gave us permission to be barefoot at school.  All the school required was parent&#39;s permission, and we didn&#39;t need shoes again until Nov!  It was a rural, poor area and most of us only owned one pair of shoes each summer -- nice ones to wear &#39;into town, otherwise no one really bothered with shoes.  <br/>
 <br/>
As kids, we used to see who could stand the longest on the asphalt blisters that come up on the road as the days warm up.   I always won, because even then the skin on my feet was like elephant-hide!<br/>
 <br/>
And of course, Andy almost never wears his sneakers, preferring flip-flops (we call them slippers, Hawaii fashion).  Sneakers are only to keep socks clean so he can wear them in playland at McDonalds.  He takes off the socks as soon as he sees some other kid barefoot.  Then again, Andy seldom dresses for any kind of cold/wet weather either.  I have photos of him on the playground, running around in shorts, t-shirt and flip-flops in a cold, mid-December rain two years ago!  Every other kid in the picture is dressed like Nanook of the North, and Andy looks like Island Boy!<br/>

later,&quot; because it would have totally sidetracked a busy conversation, and now she&#39;s <br/>
off at an overnight party.<br/>
<br/>
Highest grades.  Usually those over 3.5.  Some towns publish it in the <br/>
newsletter.  Some schools put the names up in a trophy case (temporarily, not like <br/>
engraved).  Some places and times, kids might get special privileges for a <br/>
little while.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty went to the Junior Police Academy, one of the requirements was to <br/>
be an honors student.   I wrote and said we had no GPA, no report cards, but <br/>
that he had never failed to do what we asked him to do and that it was hard not <br/>
to be the best in your class when you&#39;re the only one. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They let him in.<br/>
<br/>
I still need to tell this list about that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s JUST a high grades thing.<br/>
