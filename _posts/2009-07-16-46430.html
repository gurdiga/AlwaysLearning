If you have any friends or relatives who can read German or would like  <br/>
to try, there&#39;s something.<br/>
<br/>
It has been deposited (in its English original) in the upcoming Big Book<br/>

And now I&#39;m leaving to see Schuyler!!  Holly made me a peanut butter  <br/>
sandwich so she would know I wouldn&#39;t be hungry in the plane, and now  <br/>
she&#39;s ready to drive me to the airport.    HOW COOL!   Very sweet of  <br/>
her.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It will hardly seem that I&#39;m gone, from the point of view of this  <br/>
list, except posts might not be approved as quickly as if I were not  <br/>
asleep on an airplane or being a happy tourist.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t forget Learn Nothing Day!   Six days away.   Learn a lot before  <br/>
then so the day off won&#39;t put you behind!<br/>
