<div id="ygrps-yiv-2030862381">I&#39;ve been stalling on a writing project, and would like for any of you who <br/>
are interested to look over my shoulder and maybe help me out, because I have <br/>
felt stuck on it.  Here were some of my instructions.  The topic is to <br/>
describe different styles of homeschooling.   If you&#39;re interested, please <br/>
read this and then the draft of my section which is below the line (lower <br/>
down).     (If you&#39;re not interested, sorry for the not-just-unschooling <br/>
post.)<br/>
<br/>
Earlier I had this, but it was softened somewhat. (This was general to the <br/>
whole project mailing list:)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The word length allowed for your section is 2000.  In answer to your <br/>
questions, I did not get an attachment so I don’t know what tone you were <br/>
using.  We were shooting for an authoritative tone, but not harsh or ‘know it <br/>
all’ in style.  We really want to make sure that there are professional <br/>
references included, as the audience we are targeting is composed of people <br/>
that value research and such…&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[my draft is only 824 words, so there&#39;s room to beef up]<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I think the main thing to remember is that the audience may know nothing <br/>
about homeschooling, may be resistant to wanting to understand homeschooling, <br/>
and may actually be attempting to prosecute a homeschooling family.  This <br/>
last point is the main way we anticipate the readers coming in contact with <br/>
the publication  We want to make sure that this publication does one thing <br/>
very well: as simply as possible covers the basics, but at the same time <br/>
supports it in as many ways as possible with scholarly research and studies.  <br/>
I anticipate that the audience will not understand homeschooling for several <br/>
reasons, but the one we need to make sure to keep in mind throughout the <br/>
project is that they probably need to get as much information as they can, as <br/>
quickly as they can, and as simply as they can.  It can be a challenging way <br/>
to have to think while writing because it may seem so foreign...you may want <br/>
to consider it like drafting text for a school textbook on <br/>
homeschooling...sort of like you have a section of a chapter to write.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We are walking a fine line because the targeted audience will have degrees <br/>
and feel like their opinions on homeschooling are correct (because of their <br/>
education), but many have a somewhat negative view of homeschooling....most <br/>
of which actually comes from lack of knowledge about it (in my opinion and <br/>
experience, at least).  No educator is taught about homeschooling unless they <br/>
have gone to the most alternative of schools---and even then I have only seen <br/>
homeschooling briefly addressed in university curriculum.  So, we need to <br/>
give it to them simply, and quickly, but with a strong infrastructure of <br/>
research and support wherever possible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Methods of Homeschooling<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling methods cover the same range educational theory does, in that <br/>
some believe strongly in &quot;the three R&#39;s&quot; as the frontline of their efforts, <br/>
and others lean more toward deductive reasoning and &quot;learning to learn.&quot;  <br/>
This range of choices is a great advantage to homeschoolers, because each <br/>
family and each learner can eventually discover which method works best for <br/>
their personalities, learning styles, talents and needs.<br/>
<br/>
The most structured homeschooling situation involves a purchased curriculum, <br/>
used on a school-style schedule.  The oldest of these is The Calvert School, <br/>
purchased by the school year and by individual grade.  Once for missionaries&#39; <br/>
children and the bedridden, it comes with all necessary supplies, including <br/>
pencils.   Two in current use are Abeka and Sonlight, both with a Protestant <br/>
Christian point of view.  Seton is a popular Catholic curriculum.  For older <br/>
students, The American School is sometimes employed.  The same curriculum <br/>
once advertised on matchbook folders for returning GI&#39;s  in the 1950&#39;s and <br/>
60&#39;s, it is one way to obtain a high school diploma.  There are several other <br/>
curriculæ on the market as well as online courses. <br/>
<br/>
Some families design their own curriculum, mixing and matching different <br/>
sources, perhaps using a purchased math series, but designing their own <br/>
literature courses and using a history overview such as The History of US, or <br/>
other such summaries.  In this way the child goes at his own pace through <br/>
materials and the families supplements as interest and need dictate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The advantage is that it looks like school.  For many children that is also <br/>
the disadvantage, if school&#39;s methods are not suited to their learning style. <br/>
 And another disadvantage is it takes learning designed for large groups and <br/>
applies it to one child, which is not usually an efficient use of time and <br/>
effort in a home environment.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A less linear and more intensive  method is &quot;unit studies.&quot;    Units can be <br/>
purchased or downloaded from the internet, or easily designed by parents.  <br/>
With unit studies, a subject such as &quot;Japan&quot; or &quot;whales&quot;  is chosen, and the <br/>
student explores the history, geography, literature and science regarding the <br/>
topic, working in mathematics and writing about aspects of this study, in <br/>
order to simultaneously study a particular subject and exercise the various <br/>
disciplines the parent wishes to teach.  With unit studies, art and music are <br/>
easily incorporated.  Units typically last a week or two.  <br/>
<br/>
Thematic studies are common at many alternative schools of late.  While <br/>
similar to unit studies, a theme such as &quot;treasure&quot; or &quot;families&quot; is the <br/>
focus of inquiry for a month or more, and are easy to adapt to a <br/>
homeschooling situation.  Sometimes classic literature provides the base <br/>
theme, as advocated by Charlotte Mason&#39;s methods. <br/>
<br/>
Both unit studies and thematic studies can be used with children of different <br/>
ages and  abilities simultaneously, which is a great advantage to children <br/>
learning together without the limits of &quot;grade levels&quot; to the advantage of <br/>
all the learners and facilitators.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some homeschoolers say they are using a &quot;relaxed&quot; or &quot;eclectic&quot; method, by <br/>
which they mean they are picking and choosing from the methods above as suits <br/>
each child&#39;s strengths and learning style.  The flexibility of being able to <br/>
focus on the learner instead of the material itself is the greatest benefit <br/>
of homeschooling, and once the parents gain confidence in their child&#39;s <br/>
leaning, both child and parent can adapt learning to their everyday lives in <br/>
a way schools dream of doing, but homeschoolers can actually accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
The ultimate dream of educators was once called &quot;the open classroom.&quot;  When <br/>
applied to homeschooling, it is also known as &quot;natural learning,&quot; <br/>
&quot;interest-based learning&quot; or for those who come to this method by the <br/>
writings of John Holt, &quot;unschooling.&quot;  This is similar to unit studies, <br/>
without having clearly delineated units.  A child&#39;s interest in Mongol tribes <br/>
might last his whole life, with him coming back to that and building on it <br/>
whenever opportunity arises.   If one has a fascination with flight, the <br/>
parents will encourage that as long as the interest is strong, and be willing <br/>
to drop it or return to it a month or two years later, while other interests <br/>
are interwoven, and parents learn to see the learning opportunities in both <br/>
special and common everyday activities, rather than separating &quot;schooltime&quot; <br/>
from living.   With natural learning, summer and vacations are often the <br/>
richest learning seasons, and it doesn&#39;t matter what grade a child would be <br/>
in if he were in school.  He learns every day.<br/>
<br/>
The advantage is that an enriched life becomes the classroom and the <br/>
disadvantage is that outsiders find it harder to see the learning as it <br/>
happens.   While this method rarely worked in public school settings,  it can <br/>
work given the real world as the open classroom. With the state of the <br/>
internet, video information, and the easy availability of a quality and <br/>
quantity of excellently illustrated books never imagined thirty years ago, <br/>
the world is accessible to people as never before.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-919782853">**We were shooting for an authoritative tone, but not harsh or âknow<br/>

<br/>
That strikes me as impossible.  I think your basic tone IS<br/>
authoritative, but some people will insist on perceiving it as harsh or<br/>
know-it-all.  I don&#39;t see anyway to avoid that without wishy-washying it<br/>
all up.<br/>
<br/>
(Unless you can get a very sensitive &quot;canary&quot; to play &quot;harshness<br/>
detector&quot; for you and tweak the word choices a tiny bit.)<br/>
<br/>
**&quot;I think the main thing to remember is that the audience may know<br/>
nothing <br/>
about homeschooling, may be resistant to wanting to understand<br/>
homeschooling, <br/>
and may actually be attempting to PROSECUTE a homeschooling family.**<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s scary!  We want to explain the types of homeschooling so well<br/>
that prosecutors will know that a judge is more likely to &quot;throw the<br/>
book&quot; at unschoolers than at anyone else.  Man, that would give me<br/>
writer&#39;s block!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;quoting about unit and thematic studies&gt;&gt;<br/>
	&quot;which is a great advantage to children <br/>
	learning together without the limits of &quot;grade levels&quot;<br/>
	 to the advantage of <br/>
	all the learners and facilitators.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would just say advantage to children of different ages learning<br/>
together and leave out your message about the pointlessness of grade<br/>
levels.  I think it will be clearer to the intended audience.  Otherwise<br/>
you are trying to make two points in the same sentence.  (Let&#39;s not make<br/>
it too tough on them. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
**The advantage is that an enriched life becomes the classroom and the <br/>
disadvantage is that outsiders find it harder to see the learning as it <br/>
happens.**<br/>
<br/>
I would say something about this type of learning having a different<br/>
scope and a different sequence than a state defined course of study. <br/>
(Unless you&#39;d rather they not realize that.)<br/>
<br/>
**The ultimate dream of educators was once called &quot;the open classroom.&quot;**<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this is going to resonate with people who are currently<br/>
attending or recently graduated from teacher certification programs. <br/>
It&#39;s pretty dated.  Wrapping your arguments up in the very latest shiny<br/>
buzzwords might be helpful.  (I&#39;ll try to think of some.)<br/>
<br/>
Betsy<br/>
<br/>
PS  (I&#39;m not sure that *I* have the background knowledge to understand<br/>
the difference between designing one&#39;s own curriculum and being<br/>
eclectic.  Maybe we could talk about that a little here on the list. <br/>
Perhaps we don&#39;t all define it in the same way?  Most everyone I know<br/>
IRL is somewhere in the relaxed, eclectic, do-it-yourself category.  But<br/>
it&#39;s darned hard to make the labels stick.)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959988972">It doesn&#39;t read academically enough for me, but I&#39;m not sure that&#39;s what <br/>
you&#39;re striving for, so...<br/>
<br/>
When it comes to needing footnotes and references, you can always do it the <br/>
old college-trick way!  We used to get as many books on the subject as we <br/>
could lay our hands on, leaf through them and write all our footnotes FIRST <br/>
(so it was chock-a-block-full!), re-arrange them to &#39;flow&#39; then finish by <br/>
writing &#39;filler&#39; sentences to pull the reader from one footnote to another.<br/>
<br/>
We used to joke about who could get the highest number of footnotes on one <br/>
double-spaced page.  Of course, the professors loved it because it looked <br/>
like you worked really hard finding notes to fit your thesis, when all you <br/>
did was find some good notes and base the paper on them.<br/>
<br/>
...and you will be editing what you wrote for grammatical purposes, <br/>
right?  I mean, you&#39;re in the brainstorming part of writing now, eh?<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for reasons homeschooling is &#39;good&#39; for society, or <br/>
answers a need, start quoting business books (like The Future of Success by <br/>
Robert B. Reich, where he says, &quot;We are entering the Age of the Terrific <br/>
Deal, where choices are almost limitless...And who doesn&#39;t want a better <br/>
deal?  Only the indolent, insane or congenitally complacent would pass up a <br/>
product that&#39;s obviously better or cheaper, an investment with higher <br/>
return...You owe it to yourself, your family.  You owe it to <br/>
capitalism.  The system works only if people are pushing for the best <br/>
deals.  Otherwise, producers fail to innovate or invest...  When millions <br/>
of people are constantly seeking something better...all resources are put <br/>
to their best uses.  People work hard.  Economies surge forward.  This has <br/>
long been the American way.&quot; (pg 13)    Then follow up with some commentary <br/>
on how the educational system will be as effective as the economic system, <br/>
so long as there are people constantly seeking something better for their <br/>
families, working hard, surging forward (and now you&#39;re going to tell them <br/>
how varied families are working hard and surging forward trying new <br/>
methodologies all for the benefit of the American public and the American <br/>
Way... (Heidi leans away to politely regurgitate.)  Shoot, you could <br/>
probably quote some Aristotle for good measure...  He&#39;s impressive.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also do some relating on how current homeschool philosophies are <br/>
similar to those of our founding fathers, etc.  If someone wants to attack <br/>
homeschooling, make sure they know they&#39;re attacking &quot;Amurika&quot; in all her <br/>
technicolor glory!<br/>
<br/>
But again, I&#39;m not sure what angle you&#39;re writing from/in, so....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427708474">**If you&#39;re looking for reasons homeschooling is &#39;good&#39; for society, or <br/>
answers a need, start quoting business books (like The Future of Success<br/>
by <br/>
Robert B. Reich, where he says, &quot;We are entering the Age of the Terrific <br/>
Deal, where choices are almost limitless...And who doesn&#39;t want a better <br/>
deal?  Only the indolent, insane or congenitally complacent would pass<br/>
up a <br/>
product that&#39;s obviously better or cheaper, an investment with higher <br/>
return...You owe it to yourself, your family.  You owe it to <br/>
capitalism.  The system works only if people are pushing for the best <br/>
deals.  Otherwise, producers fail to innovate or invest...  When<br/>
millions <br/>
of people are constantly seeking something better...all resources are<br/>
put <br/>
to their best uses.  People work hard.  Economies surge forward.  This<br/>
has <br/>
long been the American way.&quot; (pg 13)  **<br/>
<br/>
This would be great, and ironic, because Reich wrote a long &quot;white<br/>
paper&quot; about the threat of homeschooling and why the government had a<br/>
vested interest in regulating it.  So, yeah, use his words to support<br/>
homeschooling.  That&#39;ll teach him. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
