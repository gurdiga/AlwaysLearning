<div id="ygrps-yiv-642226819">&quot;....you yourselves must be filled with wonder and when you have<br/>
acquired that, you are prepared.&quot;<br/>
- Montessori, Her Life and Work :: The Penguin Group, 1987 :: p. 309<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We must help the child to act for himself, will for himself, think<br/>
for himself; this is the art of those who aspire to serve the<br/>
spirit.&quot; <br/>

I don&#39;t see Maria Montessori&#39;s theories exactly replicated in Montessori<br/>
schools today, I have researched the schools in my area and found them very<br/>
very lacking. But, I do love Maria Montessori and her wonderful<br/>
understanding of children! Her quotes bring tears to my eyes so many times<br/>
and enrich my parenting untold countless ways. Her counsel to be a student<br/>
of the child is just precious to me. Just thought I&#39;d share.<br/>
