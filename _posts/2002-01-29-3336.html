<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165044489">This is the text from the list welcome/guidelines (posted on <br/>
Yahoo).<br/>
<br/>
Since we have so many new members who may have joined <br/>
through other avenues than the front entrance, I thought I&#39;d better <br/>
post this so everyone&#39;s clear on what the purpose and <br/>
guidelines for the list are:<br/>
<br/>
Discussion for homeschooling fans of John Holt, whose books <br/>
Learning All the Time, Never Too Late, and Teach your Own have <br/>
made unschooling a sweet and viable option for thousands of <br/>
families.   <br/>
<br/>
This is a moderated group, with trapdoors for the uncooperative. <br/>
(Not moderated in the advance-approval way, but in the be-nice-<br/>
to-play way.)   It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean more <br/>
toward pure unschooling than neutral, general homeschooling <br/>
discussion--there are hundreds of general homeschooling <br/>
discussions for newcomers.   It&#39;s to focus more toward how <br/>
people learn no matter where in the world they are, rather than <br/>
on what&#39;s legal in any particular country or jurisdiction.   <br/>
<br/>
