<div id="ygrps-yiv-515234148">&lt;&lt;The sandwich could be wrapped up for later, too.  Maybe you or your <br/>
husband would want it for a snack later if the kids don&#39;t, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
need to be eaten RIGHT then.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You could make it and then cut it in four squares.  Give your kiddo one <br/>
square and immediately bag the rest and put in fridge.  Then if kiddo wants <br/>
more, it&#39;s there and if it&#39;s not eaten by kiddo, then it&#39;s pretty fresh for <br/>
someone else.  This might take the &#39;waste&#39; irritation from your brain.  Hey, <br/>
and hubby will be very happy that something is all ready for his taking. <br/>
Dave LOVES when I have items ready in the fridge.  Ohhhhh, and kiddo can <br/>
then grab said piece of sandwich as wishes also.  Hmmm, win/win and win!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;-=-What is one more glass? -=-&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorscha used to be a glass maniac.  We came up with a few solutions that <br/>
worked for both of us.  She keeps a glass at the kitchen sink (she&#39;ll run in <br/>
and grab a drink) and also in the bathroom.  Then she also keeps a giant <br/>
tumbler with no spill lid at her computer area / family room.  I will clean <br/>
it and refill everyday.  As for glasses outside, we have a cabana with a <br/>
fridge full of drinks.  I keep water bottles in there and have a trashcan in <br/>
the area.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sorscha and I are quite opposite in our lifeways.  I&#39;ve tried to come up <br/>
with solutions that work for both of us instead of being &#39;BitchMom&#39;. I don&#39;t <br/>
want &#39;BM to be my legacy.   Sorscha is a snacker (maybe your kiddo is also). <br/>
She rarely eats what I would consider a meal.  I&#39;ve found that if I keep <br/>
easy, small &#39;foods&#39; on hand for her, then she&#39;ll just grab and go.  Sooo, <br/>
the fridge is full of precut veggies and fruits.  It&#39;s also filled with easy <br/>
grab lunchable type things (you can make these yourself or purchase).  The <br/>
pantry is filled with &#39;grab&#39; containers with lids. Now that she&#39;s older I <br/>
have EasyMac and other quickie hot options available (she&#39;s not into using <br/>
the stove at this point so they need to be microwave ready).  About 1/2 the <br/>
time she prefers me to gather her food and bring it to her (it&#39;s because she <br/>
loves me) and the other 1/2 she grabs herself.  I also keep trashcans in <br/>
several rooms.  This helps the trash get to where it needs to go and not on <br/>
the floor.  Win/Win again.  Hey, and often times I will come into the family <br/>
room area and just pick up the wrappers, etc. that don&#39;t make it in the <br/>
trash but since THERE IS a trashbag in here it&#39;s not a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For me, the goal is finding solutions and not &#39;bitch&#39; opportunities.  The <br/>
other day I came home to find a huge mess from the contractor and the <br/>
neighbor&#39;s irrigation ditch (that flows through our yard) had overflowed by <br/>
about 25 feet into the chicken coop and Sorscha&#39;s sandbox.  I was like a <br/>
two-year-old (I was already tired and hungry from a long day) and I began to <br/>
cry being overwhelmed and all.  Fortunately Dave was pulling in the driveway <br/>
and saved the day.  Husbands&#39; rock! Later in the evening when Sorscha and I <br/>
were hanging for bed I said, &quot;Sorry I was a wienie today.&quot;  Sorscha said, <br/>
&quot;Your not a penis Mom, your a vagina.&quot;  I just thought that was funny and <br/>
that I would share.  Sorscha could have chosen to say something rude or mean <br/>
(the way that some Mommies choose to).  She could become BitchKid - it would <br/>
make sense if I chose to model BitchMom.   Instead, she chose humor and <br/>
love.  Kids&#39; rock!<br/>

<br/>
The other day Holly and I had an argument, and were both really not  <br/>
liking the other.  It involved us cleaning things out of Kirby&#39;s room  <br/>
so she can use it for other purposes.  We said we&#39;d save it for a  <br/>
year in case he wanted to move back.  His year&#39;s almost up, he&#39;s up  <br/>
for a promotion; he&#39;s not moving back.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We were not agreeing on what and how and each of us felt put-upon and  <br/>
resentful, and we got into the cutting comments.  I left the house,  <br/>
saying I was gong to go buy some more plastic tubs.  The store was  <br/>
out, but just being outside in the air and wind and being able to  <br/>
breathe without Holly looking at me was good.<br/>
<br/>
While I was gone, she went and talked to Keith who was doing a jigsaw  <br/>
puzzle a few rooms away (the library, for those who know where  <br/>
Kirby&#39;s room is/was).  He had heard the sniping, and he heard Holly&#39;s  <br/>
side.  Then I came home, cleaned a little more (packing up toys,  <br/>
actually, more than cleaning) and then went and sat with Keith at the  <br/>
puzzle table.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s responses were perfect, and soothing, and he said he knew  <br/>
Holly&#39;s side, and was willing to tell me if I wanted to know, and I  <br/>
said no, I didn&#39;t want to know, because I didn&#39;t care.  I was still  <br/>
frustrated and felt like I didn&#39;t love her.  I knew it would pass,  <br/>
but it hadn&#39;t passed yet.<br/>
<br/>
He was sweet and patient (getting older helps &lt;g&gt;), and let me vent a  <br/>
bit and then just work the puzzle with him and be calmer.<br/>
<br/>
Of course Holly and I were fine after a while and I loved her and  <br/>
she  has been sweet since.  It was a bad half hour, not even a bad  <br/>
afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But about Sorscha&#39;s humor, I just want to take this out by itself for  <br/>
a moment:<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Sorry I was a wienie today.&quot; Sorscha said, &quot;Your not a penis Mom,  <br/>
your a vagina.&quot; -=-<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking what the percentage of families might be in which  <br/>
that would be considered humor and not the worst possible thing a  <br/>
child could say, that would bring a rain of shame and punishment  <br/>
down.   Most kids aren&#39;t allowed to use ANY humor that would  <br/>
challenge a parents pronouncements in the last way.<br/>
<br/>
And most parents don&#39;t apologize to their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t our kids all really lucky!??<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-989795293">When me and his dad were separated, our then 4 year old ds used the word<br/>
&quot;penis&quot; at the caretaker&#39;s dinner table.  It was a huge offense for her and<br/>
soon afterward she quit.  This after raving and saying he was a model child<br/>
(whatever that is) for several weeks.  It took one word to turn that around<br/>
for her.  Ds was crushed because she was very vocal about him being a<br/>
problem for her.<br/>
<br/>
Contrast that with a few minutes ago.  We were looking at a funny email (it<br/>
was something about global warming).  There&#39;s a picture of some humanoid<br/>
grilling utensils with two hot dogs grilling on the appropriate appendages,<br/>
and ds said... &quot;So *that&#39;s* why they&#39;re called wieners!&quot;  We just chuckled<br/>
and said yeah!  Very cute and funny.<br/>
