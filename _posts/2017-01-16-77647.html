<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564584815"><div dir="ltr">My son has a friendship that is tricky- for both of us, though for different reasons. <div><br></div><div>Part of me wants to support him in the friendship and help make it work, because he cares about this friendship, even though it is difficult. But another part of me wants to just stand back and not be active in supporting it, and let it run its own course. </div><div><br></div><div>My son has known this boy- i&#39;ll call Tom- since they were in a preschool together. Even when they were young, there was almost always a conflict or point of tension in their time together. It was like they were thick as theives, or in conflict. </div><div><br></div><div>Tom spent 4 nights with us this past summer and 3 days were great, but the 4th totally fell apart. It was too long. They both behaved in ways that were frustrating and hurtful for the other one. We worked it out as best we could, and they have hung out together since.<br></div><div><br></div><div>A weekend or so ago, Liam (my son) went to Tom&#39;s for the afternoon. This was rare- usually Tom is coming to our place, for a variety of reasons. When I went to pick Liam up, I could tell something had happened. Liam was chattier than usual, and Tom as kind of lurking on the sidelines. Tom&#39;s dad mentioned there was an issue, but he had let the boys work it out and he would let Liam tell me about it. When we got in the car, I gave it a little time then asked if he would share what happened. He said no, and he never would. </div><div><br></div><div>He has asked to have Tom over again, but I feel like I am not willing to have him over until I know what happened. I am very familiar with how they usually clash at our house, but I&#39;m not sure what would have happened at his house. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Liam refuses to tell me. I don&#39;t know if this is because he is ashamed for some behavior of his or what. He often shuts down when he perceives or knows he is at fault. i have not pressed it, but just left it as- well, i would like to be prepared for anything that might come up, and for me that means having some idea of what happened at your last playdate. when you&#39;re willing to share, let me know.</div><div><br></div><div>a little more background: <br></div><div><br></div><div>The boys specifically bond around gaming. They had great times playing Minecraft via Skype or Facetime a couple years ago. But of course we have been unschooling the last 2 years and my son has had unfettered access to game time and any other games he wants to explore. Tom&#39;s family regulates his game time and does not allow him to get any games they deem &#39;violent.&#39; This has meant that most of the other games my son has been into, Tom doesn&#39;t have and cannot play. </div><div><br></div><div>For awhile when Tom came over, I would allow him to use my laptop. Tom would want to game way more than Liam did. Also, Liam moved beyond Minecraft into other games Tom didn&#39;t know, so there would be conflict around that. Liam and I did talk about these things- he wanted Tom to have lots of time to play because he knew he didn&#39;t get that time at home, but it was hard for him to navigate. I tried to help as best as I could without being intrusive. </div><div><br></div><div>When I found that Tom had created a user account on my computer without asking- or maybe it was a Google profile. In anycase, I was uncomfortable with that and decided that my computer is no longer a default computer for the kids&#39; friends. </div><div><br></div><div>The couple of times he has been over since I made this decision have been OK, but not great. </div><div><br></div><div>There have been other behaviors on Tom&#39;s part that are hard for me. He will push on things I have said &#39;no&#39; to, I think because he perceives that I always say yes, because clearly Liam is able to do what he wants. There&#39;s a flavor of wheedling and honed negotiating that bothers me. </div><div><br></div><div>Oh- and when he comes to us, the dad will say- &#39;please don&#39;t let them game for hours and hours.&#39; which puts me in an awkward position. Last time he asked that they go outside and then acknowledged that Tom didn&#39;t have appropriate footwear (or clothes) for the foot of snow we have on the ground. But- we outfitted him in extras and I felt obligated to take them sledding (or some other outdoor activity) which he was not very happy about. </div><div><br></div><div>It just all feels yucky and hard. </div><div><br></div><div>My feelings are my feelings, and I am willing to set aside the things that bother me for the sake of my son&#39;s friendship and find work-arounds if that&#39;s the best thing. But I&#39;m not sure that it is. </div><div><br></div><div>Thoughts and suggestions appreciated! <br clear="all"><div><br></div>-- <br><div class="ygrps-yiv-1564584815gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><div><div dir="ltr"><font color="#3d85c6">Kelly Callahan CCH </font><div><font color="#3d85c6">Concentric Healing Classical Homeopathy<br></font><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.concentrichealing.com/"><font color="#3d85c6">www.concentrichealing.com</font></a></div><div><br></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:concentrichealing@..."><font color="#3d85c6">concentrichealing@...</font></a></span></div><div><span style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><font color="#3d85c6">(207) 691-6798</font></span></div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ConcentricHealing" style="font-size:12.8px;">facebook</a><br></div><div><br><br></div><div><i><br></i></div></div></div></div></div></div>

An account on your computer is better than using your account, isn’t it?  Unless you have a computer for them to use, for a guest to use, letting him have a user area on yours might be a good thing.<br/>

I don&#39;t think having a long-term friendship is any more valuable then a shorter one that has better chemistry. </div><div>Sometimes long term friendships can take on a sense of obligation, because you have known the person for so long, there&#39;s history, it would be disloyal to shift away because of that history, etc. this has been my experience of some of my own longterm friendships and it&#39;s been confusing and painful at times.  I&#39;m not going to support this friendship just because it&#39;s several years old out of obligation, or some belief that it&#39;s a better friendship because it&#39;s been going on for 5 years. </div><div>In this case, my son appears to still want to hang out with Tom despite the challenges, so I&#39;ll trust him on that.  </div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1553580645gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:#fff;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1553580645m_-7922006959564438723ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1553580645m_-7922006959564438723ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1553580645m_-7922006959564438723ygrp-text"><p>

He didn&#39;t ask. It was my machine that I was lending to him to use, happily, but I do think creating one&#39;s own user account without any consultation to the owner is not OK. I think at age 11, one knows this. Maybe he didn&#39;t, but I didn&#39;t want to embarrass him about it. When he asked why I wasn&#39;t letting him use it anymore, I just said that I had made that decision about all visitors because it was my work computer. And this is true. </div><div>It isn&#39;t just with this one child. I have decided not to lend my machine, it&#39;s to all kids who come over. I use it for work and knew that if something were to happen to it by mistake, it would be a hardship for me and I don&#39;t want to put any kid in any situation where a thing of value could be broken that I would be very upset about. <br></div><div><br></div><div>We have a Wii-U that multiples can play. My son does take turns on his own machine with friends, though probably not as often as the friend would like and I make it a point to check in about that. </div><div><br></div><div> I appreciate the suggestion to do outings and let go of what happened at the last playdate. That was what my sensible mind was telling me to do. My small mind was getting wrapped up in details :/</div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1553580645gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:#fff;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1553580645m_-7922006959564438723ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1553580645m_-7922006959564438723ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1553580645m_-7922006959564438723ygrp-text"><p>

Which isn&#39;t fair to either of them, though because I am involved, as the adult who drives and supervises and provides for the boys when they are with me, I want to do with ease and happiness and figure out what&#39;s blocking me from doing so. </div><div><br></div><div>I&#39;m not irritated with the boy specifically; I have compassion for him, I think things are not always so sweet and nice at home though I know his parents are good people. I mean, mild irritation for some behavior but i can let it go. </div><div><br></div><div>I mentioned in the original post about being asked to not let the boys game for &#39;hours and hours&#39; by the dad everytime we do a pick up.  I feel a sense of obligation to the parents, even though the boys might be having a great time. I have thought about other threads that have come up about kids coming over from different houses where the culture was different- and I&#39;ll go back and try and find some of those specifically to re-read the ideas and advice. </div><div><br></div><div>The other piece is that I have realized about myself is i really don&#39;t like being in a position of controlling another person, which is why I love unschooling so much, even though we have only been doing it a couple years. When I look back on the years we were conventionally parenting, the stress at that time for me was when my kids did not want to do what my husband and i wanted to, or i was giving into social pressure to have my family be a certain way. I value agency and choice for myself, and so to impose a way of being and doing on someone else makes me feel uncomfortable. I thought it was hard because they weren&#39;t doing what I wanted them to, but in retrospect i realize it was because I did not like being in that position of having to control another person to meet an outside standard or expectation. </div><div><br></div><div>So having this kid in my home who loves this thing his parents DON&quot;T want him to do and who tell me not to let him do it is part of that irritation I&#39;m feeling. </div><div><br></div><div>Which of course brings it back to my problem and seeing what I can do to shift my perspective and create some ease in myself so I can support the friendship my son clearly wants. </div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><br></div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-879231295gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:#fff;"><div id="ygrps-yiv-879231295m_7887045062852716581ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-879231295m_7887045062852716581ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrps-yiv-879231295m_7887045062852716581ygrp-text"><p> <br>

      <p>-=- I don&#39;t think having a long-term friendship is any more valuable then a shorter one that has better chemistry. -=-<br>
<br>
And no one should need to choose between two friends that way.<br>
<br>
There IS value in being around people who have known you since you were little.  I’m surprised at your rejection of the idea of the value.  It sounds personal  Please don’t discourage a friendship your child has because of your own baggage or prejudice.<br>
<br>
-=-I&#39;m not going to support this friendship just because it&#39;s several years old out of obligation, or some belief that it&#39;s a better friendship because it&#39;s been going on for 5 years. <br>
In this case, my son appears to still want to hang out with Tom despite the challenges, so I&#39;ll trust him on that.  -=-<br>
<br>
If YOU don’t like the other boy, you might have legitimate reasons.  You  might not.  You might not even realize that you’re irritated with him separate from what your son wants (if you are).  Try to be clear, in your own mind.  I could be wrong, but the tone of your first post, and the more defensive tone of the second make me wonder whether you’re not looking to build a case against the friend.  Do other things and let the boys have the friendship, I think.  That’s my best suggestion.  <br>

<br/>
It’s why I recommended public places.  Maybe a couple of hours in a non-video-game environment elsewhere, and then back home to the games.  It would be easier than saying no to your own son in his own home.  <br/>
