<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785131150">&lt;&lt; Sandra, when I read your response, I realized that I hadn&#39;t been clear in <br/>
my post (well, I didn&#39;t &quot;realize&quot; that, I knew it all along).  I was listing <br/>
the ways I&#39;ve heard math described<br/>
rather than saying that &quot;music is a tool&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know.  It was rhetorical exploration of the idea, not argument with a <br/>
particular statement.<br/>
<br/>
Keith found and sent me the rest of his exchange (I&#39;m sending only his end, <br/>
because I had his permission):<br/>

<br/>
Sandra sent me your note.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; ... and my husband still won&#39;t loosen the structured math reins ... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Math is a highly structured abstract modeling tool and requires a strong<br/>
<br/>
sense of discipline, but ...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A true math student must possess a strong passion for discovery in a realm<br/>
<br/>
which has little direct connection to the world of our five senses.  My<br/>
<br/>
experience says that the passion will grow in children if they are shown the<br/>
<br/>
myriad of modeling applications in their everyday world (physics, chemistry,<br/>
<br/>
finance, sports, arts, etc).  All growth takes time and gentle nurturing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about educating the parents as much as educating the<br/>
<br/>
children.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know the ages of your children (or yourself or your husband :) but<br/>
<br/>
it doesn&#39;t really matter.  Think of your everyday actions, then look at how<br/>
<br/>
they can be represented with math.  Scaling of cooking ingredients (ratios),<br/>
<br/>
boiling water (physics or chemistry), bouncing a ball (physics), watching<br/>
<br/>
the moon circle the earth (geometry), (as in why does a ball fall to earth<br/>
<br/>
but the moon does not?).  Find art with a protractor, compass, straight<br/>
<br/>
edge, (like the Greeks) or just play with graph paper (geometry & trig).<br/>
<br/>
Look for symetry in nature or man made artifacts (ratios again).  Look for<br/>
<br/>
applications of fractions (ratios, division, combinatorics).  Talk about the<br/>
<br/>
lottery or statistics in elections or sports.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Algebra and calculus are abstractions to be delved into once you see the<br/>
<br/>
need for modeling in the first place.  Interest in &quot;the need&quot; I find to be<br/>
<br/>
hinged on a budding interest in some tangible format.  Do they like<br/>
<br/>
architecture or engineering (mud pies to model planes)?  How about<br/>
<br/>
competitive puzzles (board games, cards, video games)?  My son (12) just<br/>
<br/>
finished reassembling a TV. (The picture was cutting out.)  He now knows<br/>
<br/>
that the insides are not some kind of magic.  We talked a little about<br/>
<br/>
circuits and assembly and troubleshooting.  In the process of finding the<br/>
<br/>
broken circuit, we talked about TV signals and waveforms and how both audio<br/>
<br/>
and video came from the same antenna.  I didn&#39;t try to go into the math of<br/>
<br/>
electronics (really complicated modeling), but he now is a little more<br/>
<br/>
interested in just how that stuff works.  It took him 3 days of putzing<br/>
<br/>
around with it, (and a $20 part) and mostly all I did was encourage him to<br/>
<br/>
be careful and take small steps.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think the greatest thing I have learned from homeschooling, it the fact<br/>
<br/>
that it is ok to say, &quot;I don&#39;t know, let&#39;s find out.&quot;  The other side of<br/>
<br/>
that is being able to judge when the child is bored with the subject and you<br/>
<br/>
can let it slide.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>
<br/>

------------- and I answered 11/6 --------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Combinatorics:<br/>
<br/>
Consider a lottery drawing of 3 balls from 3 separate pots of 10 balls each.<br/>
<br/>
The odds of picking a specific combination of numbers is:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1/10 * 1/10 * 1/10 = 1/1000 or one in one thousand combinations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Now consider drawing the 3 balls from a single pot.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
1/10 * 1/9 * 1/8 = 1/720 or one in seven hundred twenty combinations.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Combinatorics is the study of ratios.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Computer Programming:<br/>
<br/>
This is more like logic than math, but the same principals apply.  My<br/>
<br/>
recommendation would be to buy your son a simple programming environment<br/>
<br/>
(like Visual Basic or even better Microsoft Access) and a couple beginner<br/>
<br/>
books on programming.  Even so, it will require a rigorous effort because of<br/>
<br/>
how &#39;dry&#39; the materiel really is.  The artistry of programming is in<br/>
<br/>
conceptualizing just what it is you want to accomplish.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Glad you enjoyed this<br/>

<br/>
In keeping with the musical theme of my recent posts, it&#39;s also like a big <br/>
music jam, and one introduced theme can lead to a little spate of solos.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re creating a &quot;wall of sound&quot; of unschooling ideas.<br/>
