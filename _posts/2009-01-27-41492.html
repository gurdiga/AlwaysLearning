<div id="ygrps-yiv-1537180632">I have been thinking of starting my first family blog and have been  <br/>
mulling over names. I&#39;m trying to find something that has meaning for  <br/>
me and my family (as opposed to just me). I&#39;m going back to places  <br/>
we&#39;ve been, books, songs, movies, tv shows and computer games we&#39;ve  <br/>
all enjoyed together for inspiration, but haven&#39;t settled on anything  <br/>
yet. I&#39;m making a list.<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling when the right one pops up, I&#39;ll know it, somehow. I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to overthink it (something I am prone to do &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know if that helps :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1358784031">DD suggested home rules ...which is nice <br/>
<br/>
Then we started talking about how we dont stay home all the time :) <br/>
<br/>
Then we started talking about how someone might go looking for some sort of set of house rules or scheduling or something like managers of their homes and end up on our blog. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071865268">I&#39;d recommend you pick an easy address for you blog - regardless of<br/>
the blog title. i.e. Hahamommy.blogspot.com is easy, I *am* hahamommy,<br/>
though the blog is actually titled &#39;The Journey of Nani Moon&#39;<br/>
You could pick some thing easy like<br/>
nicolesmusings.whateverblogsource.com and then play with titles until<br/>
you find one that sticks!<br/>
