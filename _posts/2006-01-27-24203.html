<div id="ygrps-yiv-850723902">I also have an only child, a daughter who is almost 13. When she was<br/>
younger she could make &quot;friends&quot; in the strangest places. Maybe they were<br/>
only &quot;friends&quot; for an hour, but she interacted with these other children<br/>
and felt that (to her anyway) they were her friends. Now that she is<br/>
older, she has lots of internet &quot;friends&quot;, she volunteers with friends<br/>
and she has friends in her Teen Tracks and Young Marines programs. Also<br/>
she has lots of friends at our local library (she is on the Teen<br/>
Council). We just joined some unschooling lists and are hoping to meet<br/>
some AZ familys at various &quot;park days&quot;. Still finding and interacting<br/>
with other kids is an issue, because she feels that she never has enough<br/>
friends.<br/>
