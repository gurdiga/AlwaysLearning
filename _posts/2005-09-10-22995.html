<div id="ygrps-yiv-994804421">&quot; We have been embracing the<br/>
whole TV thing, and you&#39;re right!....have had a lot of fun the last few<br/>
days hanging out and watching and discussing all those silly cartoons.<br/>
Much better than being uptight about it all. It seems that it is<br/>
simply a mind shift that has to take place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is really cool!  Those mind shifts are a big deal, we can&#39;t see<br/>
the postives unless we choose to, but ridding ourselves of old habits<br/>
isn&#39;t easy. It&#39;s simple, but not easy. Once you&#39;re there, you wonder<br/>
why it was so hard though!!<br/>
I&#39;m glad you found your shift.:)<br/>
