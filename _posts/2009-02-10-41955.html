<div id="ygrps-yiv-205807320">We have been unschooling my 14 year old and 4 year old for 4 years now and<br/>
now have a fairly new addition.  Both the older kiddos hit all the infant<br/>
milestones early and were walking at 8 months so I never had this worry<br/>
before.  Emma is not even showing signs of rolling over any time soon and<br/>
the &#39;standard&#39; is they *should* be rolling by 6 months.  I am trying to keep<br/>
in mind that she is not her brothers or other kids and she will do things on<br/>
her own time but there is that element of worry that keeps nagging at me<br/>
since she will be 6 mo old on Friday.  I would love to hear stories of your<br/>
kids and when they started to roll over, especially if they were &#39;late&#39; in<br/>
doing so.  I am looking for reassurance, mainly but also if there is<br/>
something I need to be doing with her?  I feel very much like a first time<br/>
mom with her.<br/>
 <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-556046484">Samuel did everything in the &quot;wrong&quot; order as a baby.  He hated to lay flat so he was always held.  He sat up at 8 months, crawled a few days later, rolled from crawling, and was walking within a month.  He is 6 and just learned the monkey bars.  <br/>
<br/>
Have you had her checked for ear infections?  I think that was what got Samuel &quot;out of order.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other game we played that both boys loved, is I would lay them on the floor or bed and sing there were 5 in the bed and the little one said roll over...  Eli was almost 2 and loved the game at least as much as Samuel who was a baby.  I rolled both boys around with the song and they loved it.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841038528">Thanks Amanda! Great idea to play the &quot;Little One Said Roll Over&quot; game.I<br/>
have been rolling her over making silly noises and such but I think Aden<br/>
would get into the game too if I sang that song!  <br/>
 <br/>
~~~ Have you had her checked for ear infections? ~~~<br/>
She has been to all her check-ups and they check her ears each time and say<br/>
they look great so, no ear infections.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1056005096">My son did not rollover until he was 7 months. At 9 and  half he was running. Kids do things at different times.<br/>
He also did not sit until he was around 8 months ( unassisted).<br/>
I never worried about hitting milestones. I have seen kids walk at 9 months or 17 months.<br/>
Like kids that read late, when they are older you cannot tell the difference between who started early or who started late.<br/>
My niece did not walk until she was 17 months old. At 14 she is a talented track runner in school. She is super fast.<br/>
My nephew did not talk  anything one could understand  until he was 4 . At 7 he has an amazing vocabulary and speaks crystal clear.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1213360540">====I am trying to keep in mind that she is not her brothers or other <br/>
kids and she will do things on her own time but there is that element <br/>
of worry that keeps nagging at me since she will be 6 mo old on <br/>
Friday.  I would love to hear stories of your kids and when they <br/>
started to roll over, especially if they were &#39;late&#39; in doing so.====<br/>
<br/>
Keep in mind that children are always learning something, and it&#39;s <br/>
usually not what you think they &quot;should&quot; be learning.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest son never seemed particulary dexterous.  The whole rolling <br/>
over thing was a little challenging for him.  He had a lot of trouble <br/>
with putting beads on a string as at toddler.  As a five years old, <br/>
coloring was a real challenge.  However, language was definately his <br/>
thing.  He was speaking in complete sentences at 18 months, and by <br/>
the time he was two I could have an intelligent conversation with <br/>
him.  I was shocked to discover he could read shortly after his 4th <br/>
birthday.  It seems he put all of his focus into language and the <br/>
whole motor skills thing just didn&#39;t interest him.<br/>
<br/>
Imagine my suprise as I watched my second son develop.  At 11 months <br/>
old I found him in the bathroom sink.  A few days later I found him <br/>
on the kitchen counter eating cookies.  At 18 months he was climbing <br/>
stairs using alternating feet (a 3yo skill).  However, he wasn&#39;t <br/>
talking much by the time he was three.  He didn&#39;t know any of his <br/>
colors at four.  At five he still didn&#39;t know many of his body <br/>
parts.  It seems he focused on motor skills and didn&#39;t pay much <br/>
attention to language.<br/>
<br/>
At 11 and 8, both of my boys are talking, reading, and running just <br/>
fine.  While your little one may not be rolling over, she is <br/>
certainly focusing on some other goal.  If you continue to worry and <br/>
focus on the rolling over, you may interfere with the skill she is <br/>
focusing on.  Just continue to play with her and meet her needs, and <br/>
don&#39;t worry so much about what she&#39;s not doing.  Focus instead on all <br/>
of the great things she is doing.<br/>
