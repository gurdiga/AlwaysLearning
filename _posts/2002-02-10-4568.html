 </span></blockquote>As a kid and teenager, at my father&#39;s house, we weren&#39;t allowed<br/>
to eat any sugar except honey and pure maple syrup and we weren&#39;t<br/>
allowed to have any white flour or anything with chemicals, artificial<br/>
preservatives, artificial colors or artificial flavorings (My father is <br/>
an M.D. who specializes in nutrition, allergies and preventative <br/>
medicine).<br/>
<br/>
After leaving home at 18, I went nuts eating junk food.  I still have<br/>
a very hard with sweets,,,and my weight keeps going up and up <br/>
and up.  I hate it,,,but it&#39;s either I eliminate sweets all together or<br/>
I can&#39;t control myself,,,,I will eat and eat until it&#39;s gone.  One day<br/>
about a year ago, I made a huge batch of cookies,,,,,72 cookies <br/>
in all.  I ate them all in a three day period.  Ugh,,,,<br/>
<br/>
Nowadays, we have had to cut out all the sugar and gluten, out<br/>
of necessity,,,,my husband has diabetes and a gluten intolerance<br/>
that directly affects his diabetes.  If he eats anything at all with<br/>
gluten, his blood sugar goes WAY up.  My father (his doctor)<br/>
told me recently that my kids are probably very suseptible to getting<br/>
juvenile diabetes because it&#39;s running in their genes on both sides<br/>
of the family (I don&#39;t have it though).  He recommended eliminating<br/>
the sugar and gluten for them too (he said it&#39;s healthier that way <br/>
anyway).  We have done pretty well in doing that, but I will still let <br/>
them eat whatever they want at birthday parties, special occasions <br/>
and on Halloween.  Both kids have also inherited my dairy intolerance <br/>
(it causes horribly painful IBS for both of them),,,so we use soy milk, <br/>
rice milk, or oat milk whenever something calls for cow&#39;s milk.<br/>
<br/>
I really don&#39;t want food to be an issue, but in our case, it just is.<br/>
What I&#39;ve done is buy lots of stuff we all *can* eat and stocked the <br/>
kitchen with that.  That way, they can eat anything they want that&#39;s <br/>
in the house, whenever they want. <br/>
