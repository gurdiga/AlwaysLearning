<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541494918">Growing up I was always taught that TV was bad, video games are for those with no imagination and unless it is extremely bad weather, a child should be outside. To hear someone encourage video game time and TV time, no matter the time and without disruption, is just a little different for me since it was not how I was raised and how society says how our children should be raised.Wait a second........ Sorry but I just had to laugh at what I just wrote HAHA!! I can&#39;t believe I just said that &quot;what society says how our children should be raised&quot;! I can&#39;t believe I am letting society rule how I want to raise my children. I am letting the way I was raised and the way society says children should be raised, dictate how I am raising my children and it just now dawned on me. These are MY children. I really feel a lightbulb just went off in my head.<br/>
<br/>
Why do I let video games bother me so much? It really makes no sense to me why. He is learning hand eye cordination, he is learning new skills and trying to master levels (trying to succeed in what he is doing), pushing himself to get better and better on every level, he is playing with his brother (age 3) and sister (age 4) and teaching them how to play which in turn is teaching them hand eye coordination (he never liked to play with his brother or sister when he was going to public school, why I don&#39;t know), and he is sharing.<br/>
<br/>
I do not understand why I let TV bother me either. He watched various &quot;educational&quot; shows (History Channel, Animal Planet, Travel Channel, Weather,Food Channel and so on). These shows make him interseted in other things so he searches for books on those topics at the library.On top of that, I think he is a visual learner. I think he learns better watching tv then reading a million words a day. Why didn&#39;t I see all this before!<br/>
<br/>
Huh! It is like a huge light just popped on in my head. And it is what you all have been saying all along. My children are learning ever minute of everyday. I feel silly now. I am still gonna do a fully deschooling process because my family still needs this, but I feel better knowing that even while deschooling they are still learning no matter what we do. It is almost like even if you wanted to you can not escape learning something in some way, shape, form or fashion. Thanks!<br/>

Even in that long post I just wrote, I left out something important.<br/>
<br/>
Respect and honor your child&#39;s interest by giving them the space and <br/>
time to enjoy and pursue it without unwanted interruptions. Long hours <br/>
of uninterrupted play time or viewing time are one of the gifts we can <br/>
give our kids.<br/>
<br/>
Some people find that their kids become miserable and cranky or <br/>
aggressive when they spend a long time playing video games or watching <br/>
television. I think this is often due to not eating enough, but also <br/>
could be that those young bodies need more activity. Solve the first <br/>
problem by keeping them fed - put plates of easy-to-nibble- at foods <br/>
nearby - crackers and cheese and sliced apples or grapes or pieces of <br/>
leftover turkey. Get insulated coffee cups with lids and put chicken <br/>
or veggie broth in them so they can sip at it and it stays hot. Also, <br/>
make sure the game is physically comfortable - watch him play and see <br/>
if things need to be moved around. Does he need a better chair? Higher <br/>
or lower screen? Lighting changed so it isn&#39;t reflecting in the <br/>
screen? Better speakers? Also, if playing computer games, is the <br/>
computer fast enough for the game? It can be really frustrating to try <br/>
to play a game on a computer that isn&#39;t really quite adequate.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a little concerned that my long list of examples of how you can <br/>
support and expand and build on video game and tv interests could make <br/>
some people think that they should constantly barrage their child with <br/>
other things to do. Be sensitive and be aware of whether your offering <br/>
ideas is welcome and whether it seems be well accepted. You&#39;ll build <br/>
credibility as your offerings are discovered to be worthwhile.<br/>

<br/>
Wow! Good for you! It was funny to read your words as it happened!<br/>
 <br/>
I am struggling with the same thing and can&#39;t quite put my finger on what is<br/>
bothering me. Maybe by typing I will figure it out?!<br/>
 <br/>
My son is 4 and loves to play wii. I&#39;m trying to remember how it all<br/>
started. My husband got the wii for his birthday almost 2 yrs ago (Jan) from<br/>
his mom (who called every store every day until she got one at 7am!) and<br/>
previously we were not a gaming family. DH played computer games on his own<br/>
(I played some on my own too, but not much). DS was 2.5 at that time and we<br/>
didn&#39;t think much of exposing him to the wii. He was able to play the<br/>
simpler games with us like baseball, tennis, and bowling and we enjoyed time<br/>
as a family. He would join us when he wanted to or do something else if he<br/>
didn&#39;t want to play. When we got Guitar Hero, DH and I would take turns<br/>
playing while DS would jam along on his little acoustic guitar, striking<br/>
poses and dancing around.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m not sure when, but I think DS got more interested in the wii when we got<br/>
Cars. He could drive all over town for hours, just checking things out (how<br/>
it&#39;s designed, very cool actually) and playing various driving games. Mario<br/>
Kart was another favorite. At first he would just drive all over, exploring<br/>
the track and came in last place every time, but he did not care! It was<br/>
really funny to see how much fun he had letting his character drive off a<br/>
cliff over and over and over! He would jump and squeal with glee! Back then<br/>
he could play for a while and then turn it off.<br/>
 <br/>
Ice Age 2 was a turning point. That game required a nunchuk plugged into the<br/>
wiimote, so the difficulty factor went up! He was often frustrated by what<br/>
he wanted his character to do but couldn&#39;t make the moves for and would ask<br/>
me to do certain moves for him. There&#39;s one timed game that he still asks me<br/>
to play, so he can advance faster, but he jumps and cheers me on the whole<br/>
time!<br/>
 <br/>
I could write about other woes we&#39;ve had related to the wii, but not sure<br/>
how long I want this to get. Here is 1 aside: We got Kung Fu Panda which he<br/>
absolutely loved for a while, and would move all over the living room while<br/>
playing. He went on a kung fu kick and would do karate moves all day long,<br/>
wherever we went. Spinning, chopping, kicking, ending with a still pose,<br/>
hand out, concentrating on remaining still and stealthful. He still does<br/>
this sometimes, now with the addition of rolling on the floor on his<br/>
shoulder and popping up. Anyway, I have a friend I used to get together with<br/>
often who has a son 14 mos younger than mine and they seem to be good<br/>
friends also (although more and more I&#39;m feeling bad for making them be<br/>
together). So we noticed a lot of turmoil when my DS would act out karate<br/>
moves on his friend, who would cry and run to mommy. (I believe the problem<br/>
was the age/skills gap, not that my son was trying to be mean. We have<br/>
another friend who we don&#39;t see as often whose son is the same as mine, and<br/>
when my son did his moves on that kid, he&#39;d do his own right back!) So my<br/>
friend claimed that my son was too violent because he watched excessive<br/>
violence on TV and in movies and played Kung Fu Panda which is rated for<br/>
kids 10 and up (because of the cartoonish violence?). She is a public school<br/>
teacher... &#39;nuf said?<br/>
 <br/>
So fast forward to October of this year. I bought Lego Indiana Jones for the<br/>
wii because I thought he would like it. Also the game seemed harder than<br/>
other games we had and I thought he&#39;d enjoy working on new skills. We&#39;d<br/>
watched Raiders of the Lost Ark and he had totally fell in love with Indy<br/>
and the adventure of it. (Indy is the reason he added the shoulder roll.)<br/>
Well, he became engrossed with the game! He played it morning noon and<br/>
night! It was really hard to get him to go anywhere with me (even to see his<br/>
friends), and if we did get out of the house, he would continually talk<br/>
about going home so he could play more wii. In 3 weeks he had completed the<br/>
entire game, playing some levels multiple times (although I&#39;m sure there are<br/>
parts he hasn&#39;t done, secrets to find etc. but he did finish the game).<br/>
During this time the 4th movie (Crystal Skull) came out on DVD and DH bought<br/>
it along with Temple of Doom and Last Crusade (we only had Raiders). So as a<br/>
family we watched one Indy movie a night for 4 nights. (I don&#39;t know what<br/>
unschoolers think about ratings except it&#39;s probably more about what&#39;s<br/>
appropriate for each child, but my son LOVED all 4 movies and is hardly<br/>
phased by the violence. At least he is not afraid of it.)<br/>
 <br/>
He saw a preview for the Lego Batman game and began asking me to take him to<br/>
the store to buy it. Every day... can we go to Game Stop? How about Target?<br/>
I was kind of put off because I&#39;d just spent $50 (oops, not true, I&#39;d bought<br/>
it used for $40) on a game he only played for 3 weeks! I resisted for a<br/>
couple of days, saying games were expensive, then I realized I had cashed<br/>
his birthday check from my mom for $100. I told him about HIS money and<br/>
asked him if he wanted to spend it on Batman. (As much as a 4 yr old can<br/>
understand money, but he was included in the process.) We went to Game Stop<br/>
and found a used copy for $45 (and I saved another 10% with my membership<br/>
card!). So $40 was spent and he was happy as a clam. Back home he got to<br/>
work on Batman. He played for a week as the heros before I asked if he had<br/>
unlocked any of the villain levels (which I had read about in the manual).<br/>
He said no and was so excited to figure out how to play as a villain! Then<br/>
he conquered all of the villain levels. <br/>
 <br/>
Then he started asking to go buy Lego Star Wars, which is the one I<br/>
initially wanted for ME and DH! I sort of resisted rushing right out the<br/>
first moment he asked for it, but 2 days later we were in Target and they<br/>
had it for $19.99 so I got it! He thought that&#39;s why we were there anyway. I<br/>
wondered why it was so cheap, but the salesman said it had come out first,<br/>
probably the appeal had worn off with 2 other Lego games on the market. But<br/>
it is really neat! You can play as any character (you collect/unlock more as<br/>
you play) in Episodes 1-6, so any movie. We have seen all 6 movies with him<br/>
too.<br/>
 <br/>
I really like playing wii with my son... sometimes.... and I&#39;ll pick up a<br/>
wiimote and drop into his games and drop out if I need to. When he didn&#39;t<br/>
want me to play with him, he&#39;d attack my character and kill me multiple<br/>
times until I quit. Now he just says, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to play&quot; which makes<br/>
me sad.<br/>
 <br/>
My biggest problem I thought was how he ONLY wants to play wii all day and<br/>
all night, but now I think it&#39;s my husband. Or at least the family dynamics<br/>
that are going on here. I am trying to support DS in his game playing. I<br/>
bought him a small lego set with Indian Jones and 2 other characters that he<br/>
carries around with him when we go out. We&#39;ve checked out Star Wars books<br/>
from the library, including a cookbook that we have been using. DH has been<br/>
pretty supportive as well, although in a more passive way, sometimes I see<br/>
him as too hands-off. <br/>
 <br/>
I often retreat to my office in the basement late in the evening to catch up<br/>
on email, read group posts, or to do actual work for my job, and leave the 2<br/>
of them in the living room. DS plays wii and DH either reads a book, sleeps<br/>
on the couch, or does something on his laptop. At some point (1-2am?!) I<br/>
will go upstairs to find DH either asleep or gone to bed and DS still<br/>
playing wii. I usually announce that I am going to bed and ask if he wants<br/>
to join me. He usually says no, he wants to keep playing wii, eyes fixed on<br/>
the tv and not me. I know he is tired. He looks like a zombie already. I say<br/>
he can come up with me and I&#39;ll help him brush his teeth, get into his<br/>
jammies, and read him stories. If he wanted to stay down here and play, he&#39;d<br/>
be all alone because I was tired and going to bed. He usually opts to go<br/>
with me, but sometimes he really puts up a fight about playing. This is<br/>
where it gets weird for me. I want him to go to bed, but I don&#39;t want to<br/>
force it. I do say he can play more tomorrow. I try to hold him in my lap<br/>
and give him a break from staring at the screen so he might see that he<br/>
really is tired. He might sit quietly and decide he is tired, or he might<br/>
wiggle away and fight with me. I don&#39;t really feel all that comfortable<br/>
leaving a 4yr old downstairs playing wii by himself while I go to bed (where<br/>
DH is already snoring), but once I actually did it. I went upstairs and<br/>
brushed my teeth and went to bed. I read a book for a while then turned out<br/>
the light. I couldn&#39;t sleep though. DS kept playing, then quit the game and<br/>
turned off the wii and the tv and the lights and came to bed (we co-sleep),<br/>
probably 3am. He was asleep in under 2 mins. The next morning I woke up<br/>
before DS, but I got out of the shower to find him on the couch playing Star<br/>
Wars again!<br/>
 <br/>
Lately DH has been more stern about the wii playing. He was OK with it for a<br/>
while, but is getting uncomfortable with the amount and intensity of DS&#39;s<br/>
wii obsession. Once he hid all of the wii remotes and I had to appologize to<br/>
DS because I didn&#39;t know where they were. DH prefers to watch a movie or<br/>
Mythbusters while we all eat dinner (which seems to be a reasonable request)<br/>
but DS will ignore requests to turn the wii off. DH will say we&#39;re making<br/>
dinner, you can play until it&#39;s ready. Dinner will be ready in 5 minutes,<br/>
you might want to quit when you get to the end of a level. Two minutes. Then<br/>
dinner goes into the living room and he makes one more try (which I don&#39;t<br/>
like, but he seems out of options) and says pause the game now or I&#39;m going<br/>
to turn it off. DS usually pauses, but has also ignored his dad, at which<br/>
point Dad goes to the box and holds down the power button. Then there is<br/>
crying and screaming and rolling on the floor. If the wii remote gets banged<br/>
down, there is yelling about how that&#39;s not how to treat things, or be<br/>
careful or you&#39;ll break it and not get to play wii anymore! (Last night he<br/>
said this and DS said but there&#39;s 2 more wiimotes up there.) I chimed in and<br/>
said but if you break 1, then all 3 of us won&#39;t be able to play Mario Kart<br/>
at the same time. The equipment is expensive, please take care of it.<br/>
 <br/>
It sounds like others have had this issue with game obsessions, but I got<br/>
the impression it was usually with older kids who had gone to school and<br/>
were in the process of deschooling. It feels so weird for a 4yr old who has<br/>
never gone to school to be this way, and often feels like our family is out<br/>
of control. We only have 1 TV and DH is missing his shows a lot! When he<br/>
gets his &quot;turn&quot; with the tv, he&#39;ll usually watch 3-4 hrs of recorded shows<br/>
(DVR) and DS will get antsy and keep asking to play wii again. We&#39;re not<br/>
getting to play our games anymore. We recently did get Star Wars out of the<br/>
wii and all played Mario Kart. DH and I reunited our band (I play bass) on<br/>
Guitar Hero Aerosmith and played til our fingers hurt! <br/>
 <br/>
It bothers me that DS does not really want to do anything besides play wii.<br/>
I usually don&#39;t force too much, just give him options. I did force an outing<br/>
yesterday. We met up with some other unschoolers at a kid-friendly pizza<br/>
place with play structures!!! He knew one of the girls already and we met a<br/>
few more. He had a great time playing there, but it was hard to get him<br/>
there. Then when we were packing up to go, he said I want to go home and<br/>
play wii.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for letting me pour it all out here! Sorry it got so long!! Help if<br/>
you can!!!<br/>

<br/>
Over 2000 words.  Very long.  Save it.  Read it again in six months,  <br/>
and then a year, and you&#39;ll see how far you&#39;ve come (and how much  <br/>
older he is).<br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t be four forever.<br/>
<br/>
I have fallen asleep on the couch near where a  young child was  <br/>
playing, at night, with the house locked up.  Or I&#39;ve laid down on a  <br/>
floor bed near a child who was watching a movie.<br/>
<br/>
You talked about &quot;force&quot; but I think of &quot;persuasion.&quot;   It seems  <br/>
somehow that you&#39;ve told him he can play as long as he wants to and  <br/>
it&#39;s set up a situation where someone loses and you&#39;re starting to  <br/>
think it has to be him or you (it seems).    You could tell him the  <br/>
house needs to be quiet so you and his dad can sleep, and that if he  <br/>
wants to stay up it needs to be something very, very quiet.  Could he  <br/>
watch a DVD in the bedroom with headphones?  They make pillows with  <br/>
speakers in them so only one person can hear it.   Maybe you could  <br/>
set an alarm so he could get up and play early, and then if he opts  <br/>
to sleep instead, bonus.<br/>
<br/>
My kids never went to school, and so I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a school  <br/>
thing to binge.  One of mine was a remote-control-thrower for a  <br/>
while.  But about everything, they asked if they could do something,  <br/>
and we nearly always said &quot;Yes&quot; with a condition.  &quot;Yes, until  <br/>
dinner,&quot; or &quot;Yes, if you can be quiet,&quot; or &quot;Yes until 10:00.&quot;<br/>

&gt; started.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was like a gorgeous love story that suddenly turned into a tragedy.<br/>
<br/>
From the outside looking in it looks very clearly like the only reason there <br/>
is conflict in your family is because someone is trying to control your son <br/>
away from his passion. It is hard to force children away from their passion <br/>
in the absence of rules/punishments and in the presence of caring about <br/>
their feelings. Whenever we try to control Jayn in similar ways - reducing <br/>
her choices - because we are locked into some idea of &quot;enough&quot; that is not <br/>
her idea of enough, the negative results are very similar. She will fight <br/>
for what she sees as her rights. I doubt that introducing or resorting to <br/>
punishing behavior like holding down the button is going to be helpful in <br/>
the long run. Sometimes Jayn has an expectation that her dad is going to try <br/>
to control her and be pushy even before he starts to talk to her, so she <br/>
comes in to a conversation (about changing the tv channel,or sharing a bag <br/>
of candy with him for examples) with defenses up. I have found that the best <br/>
thing is almost always to accept her no unconditionally, not argue, and that <br/>
frees her to choose to be generous and kind after a few minutes. Encouraging <br/>
dh to see it that way and act accordingly is not always easy when he is <br/>
stuck in a place of &quot;she should...&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m reading that maybe the real problem is a conflict over resources. If you <br/>
only have one tv set and your son is monopolising it, then I guess your dh <br/>
is feeling hard done by. Can you work on that issue? Can you get another set <br/>
dedicated to the Wii? I expect that a bunch of used tv&#39;s will become <br/>
available cheaply very soon with the changeover from analog to digital.<br/>
<br/>
I wish Jayn would let me go to bed while she stays up alone in the living <br/>
room! She is too scared to be alone and cries. I can&#39;t drag her to the <br/>
bedroom before she is ready to sleep because she disrupts dh&#39;s sleep with <br/>
impatient, rowdy behavior. So in the past I have napped on the sofa. I do <br/>
this rarely now because it hurts my back (really saggy in its old age - er <br/>
the sofa I mean) but maybe that would work for you. I&#39;m looking forward to <br/>
the time when Jayn will have her own room so that she will have a space she <br/>
feels safe to be alone in (I hope) and of course it will include her gaming <br/>
systems and her own satellite linked tv set. We&#39;ll work out which system <br/>
will be in the living room in due course.<br/>
<br/>
BTW you can take your old games and dvd&#39;s to the Game Stop or EB Games, and <br/>
probably other games stores too, and trade them in to get discounts on new <br/>
games and gear. Your ds might like a Nintendo DS with the similar games to <br/>
take with him to places.<br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s what we did when t.v. and video games became a  contention point for <br/>
the t.v. Dave rigged the second one (flat panel) up right  next to the original <br/>
one so that while some are watching and some are playing,  we can still be <br/>
next to each other and share in each others&#39; moments. There was  a time shortly <br/>
after that when even 2 t.v.s didn&#39;t seem to be enough, so we  found another <br/>
flat panel on sale and set that up on the other side of the  original. <br/>
Apparently, it wasn&#39;t needed, because it isn&#39;t used at all, now. The  feeling of &quot;lack&quot; <br/>
was satisfied and 2 in one room seem to be enough. We also  have hand held <br/>
games (Gameboys and Nintendo DSs) which are good for travel, but  they&#39;re also <br/>
nice for those rare occasions when the two t.v.s seem to be less  than enough <br/>
for a moment. They&#39;re nice to play solo or in pairs or groups as  well, with <br/>
the wi fi features on the DSs. In fact, the DSs are our bedtime  ritual, now. <br/>
Storm and I play together in bed until we get sleepy and then we  set one aside <br/>
for a &quot;night light&quot; (that I turn off later to save batteries), and  shut the <br/>
other off and snuggle to sleep.<br/>

that he was awake longer. It&#39;s mom&#39;s separation anxiety. :)<br/>
<br/>
I read that it wasn&#39;t about noise, it was purely the amount time being spent <br/>
and the use of the tv at dinner time, that was bothering the dad.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is a difference between a child throwing a remote because of <br/>
frustration with the game, which as I remember (perhaps wrongly) is the kind <br/>
of throwing that you have shared about before, Sandra, and parent induced <br/>
anger and frustration at being thwarted. There has been an interesting study <br/>
done with chimpanzees about the difference between &quot;unwilling&quot; and &quot;unable&quot;, <br/>
that is part of one episode of  &quot;The Baby Human&quot;. Chimps and children can <br/>
see the difference between the two. Chimps get furious very fast by the <br/>
&quot;unwilling&quot; to give them the treat, (like taunting) and are sanguinely <br/>
acceptant of &quot;unable&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
In the absence of punishments how did you insist that 10pm or the other <br/>
conditions are complied with when your kids were that young and empathy had <br/>
not yet awakened?<br/>
<br/>
That has been my problem since forever, every time this idea, the &quot;if/then&quot; <br/>
contracts idea, comes up. Jayn tests the &quot;contract&quot; every single time. All <br/>
these contracts have ever done at our place is turn Jayn into a contract <br/>
breaker, so I&#39;ve let go of them and I discourage dh from trying to make them <br/>
with her. Because we don&#39;t want to live in rules/punishment mode, the only <br/>
consequence has been our frustrated disapproval, or future based threats <br/>
like when Jayn refuses to leave the party when it has ended,  &quot;This behavior <br/>
makes me unwilling to bring you back next time&quot; or &quot;People won&#39;t want to <br/>
spend time with you if this is how you treat them&quot;. It feels horrible, even <br/>
though it is truth at the time.<br/>
<br/>
Enacting &quot;you can watch tv in the bedroom as long as you are quiet&quot; in an <br/>
attempt to sleep myself has been a disaster. It used to be that if she was <br/>
rowdy in our one bedroom, and wanted me to stay awake and watch the movie or <br/>
play with her no matter how exhausted I was, the only recourse was to return <br/>
her to the living room, and punish her (as she sees it) by leaving her there <br/>
(with the same movie, a snack and a blanket). She would return to the <br/>
bedroom shortly, crying, and I would still have to get up and go turn off <br/>
the electronics if we wanted to save the power.<br/>
<br/>
She is now 100 pounds. I can&#39;t carry her anywhere anymore so now I don&#39;t go <br/>
to bed until she is ready or fallen asleep on the sofa herself. I sometimes <br/>
nap near her as I have said. I tell her when I am tired, but it is not worth <br/>
my own anger over the poking and noisemaking to go to bed with her still <br/>
alert, and if I leave her in the living room she cries and howls for me. <br/>
Plus it is very important that I protect dh&#39;s sleep now that he is working <br/>
full time. It is better for me just to accept that I am going to be tired <br/>
and stay up with her, until she eventually matures in her own time and <br/>
starts consistently caring about other people&#39;s feelings and needs. I&#39;m <br/>
seeing more glimpses of it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s frustrating because clearly conditions and/or &quot;if/then&quot; contracts have <br/>
worked really well at Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s houses by their own histories, <br/>
but their kids accepted them. And mine WON&#39;T. Maybe she&#39;s just flat <br/>
contrary. My choice is not to live in a constant state of battle, as any <br/>
attempt to enforce a condition creates.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of a kid staying happily to play in the living room and then coming <br/>
to bed quietly when ready after turning off the lights...that sounds like <br/>
heaven and I wouldn&#39;t try to change that one little bit!<br/>

question.  Margaux very rarely will accept that and any attempt at<br/>
trying is generally met with anger or tears.<br/>
<br/>
Margaux is getting better at doing things when asked though, so it&#39;s<br/>
possible kids like that just need more time.  Saying &quot;yes&quot; a lot helps,<br/>
making things happy and light and fun helps.  Every little bit helps,<br/>
but direct coersion or control is met with a brick wall.  (like; &quot;them&#39;s<br/>
fighten words&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I totally chalk it up to personality.  Some kids really are born very<br/>
very intense and some aren&#39;t.  If you have an intense kid, you KNOW it! <br/>
I would never understand it if I didn&#39;t have one myself, and one that<br/>
totally isn&#39;t that way to contrast it with.<br/>
<br/>
I told my husband a long time ago that it would be easy to squash that<br/>
intense spirit and that instead we should encourage it.  That intense<br/>
spirit can become very useful and powerful, just more difficult to live<br/>
with sometimes!</div>

i just wanted to say that that has been my experience too - with my son, however not as much with my daughter.  so i really do believe that there are individual temperaments at work here too.  soem kids (people) just have a stronger sense of  what gordon neufeld calls &quot;counterwill&quot; - i have found that my son has both a strong sense of counterwill AND an extraordinary sensitivity to how others are feeling/impacted by his actions, and these two combine to produce feelings of intense conflict and guilt and thus anger, when someone else&#39;s needs are in direct conflict with his.  so he used to agree to &quot;contracts&quot; but then be tortured by the conflicting needs  once the terms  came &quot;due&quot; and it was just a set up for disappointment and disaster and stress, as you describe in your home.<br/>
<br/>
i can&#39;t remember how old jayn is, but what i have found is that as he ages (and deschools - which is probably not an issue in your home?), he has naturally found ways to be both more considerate of other people&#39;s needs nd in tune with his own at the same time.  but certainly not all the time and certainly not compared to many  kids his age - unschooled or not.   i too have found that surrender to our reality, compassion for the intensity of his needs, and gentle, gradual encouragement to move toward a more collaborative model, one &quot;issue&quot; at a time, has worked really well, and in fact, is the only thing that &quot;works.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
and the use of the tv at dinner time, that was bothering the dad. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
===================================================<br/>
 <br/>
Oh yes, it is ME having anxiety! Until recently breastfeeding was part of<br/>
his night time routine, a good way to calm him down after being so active.<br/>
It seems he has given that up to playing wii! Where has my baby gone?! (He<br/>
could be my only child.) I am worried about leaving him awake downstairs all<br/>
alone. It doesn&#39;t seem like 4 is old enough to allow that kind of behavior<br/>
(is this my mainstream brain talking?) and is it safe? Is it cruel or kind?<br/>
We are all night owls here, but sometimes he can outlast us old parents! Dad<br/>
does have to work in the mornings. Weekends we are all up late together.<br/>
 <br/>
I think the biggest anxiety factor is when Damon (the DS) plays wii all day<br/>
and into the night, going to bed at 4:30am and sleeping until 1:30pm or so,<br/>
which happened the other day! We checked the console stats and he played for<br/>
13 hours. We are on a totally different schedule from most people! I was OK<br/>
with it being off, I love sleeping in too, but as it slides further away<br/>
from the norm, it just feels even weirder. It is hard to make plans unless<br/>
others are available in the afternoons or evenings. Will we ever get back on<br/>
a semi-normal sleep pattern? We can&#39;t even meet Daddy for lunch (our usual<br/>
fun bonding ritual) because when he calls at 1pm to make plans, Damon<br/>
probably just woke up and we&#39;re not ready to go anywhere.<br/>
 <br/>
I hear you Robyn and Jenny about having strong willed children!!!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;From the outside looking in it looks very clearly like thet<br/>
only reason there is conflict in your family is because someone is trying to<br/>
control your son away from his passion. It is hard to force children away <br/>
from their passion in the absence of rules/punishments and in the presence<br/>
of caring about their feelings. Whenever we try to control Jayn in similar <br/>
ways - reducing her choices - because we are locked into some idea of <br/>
&quot;enough&quot; that is not her idea of enough, the negative results are very <br/>
similar. She will fight for what she sees as her rights. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
======================================================<br/>
 <br/>
I know, I feel it too, and I can&#39;t figure out how to come to terms with it.<br/>
In writing, I discovered that a lot of the frustration on the part of my<br/>
husband is because he has to fight with his son for tv time, something he<br/>
holds dear and uses as a way to unwind after a long day at work. We used to<br/>
play games together, before Damon got his passion ignited. I like the word<br/>
passion better than obsession. I couldn&#39;t think of a better way to put it, I<br/>
didn&#39;t want obsession to seem negative. Passion is better.<br/>
 <br/>
I suppose we should talk about a 2nd TV. We are supposed to be remodeling my<br/>
large (read: wasted space) office into more of an office/play room and have<br/>
plans to put a tv there. So then does the wii go there or is that where<br/>
someone goes to watch their shows? We like playing on the big screen!<br/>
 <br/>
DH is not fully on board with unschooling, just so you know. He thinks we<br/>
are lazy parents and I&#39;ve latched onto this term to describe, make sense of,<br/>
and sort of validate my lazy lifestyle. I don&#39;t see it that way, but it&#39;s<br/>
hard to have a comeback when he thinks we did nothing all day. He recently<br/>
said our son would be better off in school. He says he has so much potential<br/>
and he is wasting it; he can&#39;t read, he can&#39;t write, he won&#39;t let me cut his<br/>
hair or go get it cut so it&#39;s all shaggy in his eyes, he doesn&#39;t use the<br/>
potty (what he actually said was the kid sits around in his own feces, which<br/>
is true but if I go near him to clean him up, with NO meanness whatsoever,<br/>
he hits and kicks and throws things at me, even calls me names while I try<br/>
to get him to just lay down then he stops so we don&#39;t get the carpet messed<br/>
up and steps nicely into a fresh pull-up), and he wastes his days playing<br/>
wii. I said with a laugh, well I&#39;d like to have his life! <br/>
 <br/>
This did not help and the arguement only got worse. He is concerned that<br/>
Damon will not be prepared for the real world, like we are living in a<br/>
bubble or fantasy world. I tried to explain that he has incredible dexterity<br/>
and strategy planning skills. He has mastered games rated for 10 year olds!<br/>
In 3 weeks!He knows enough math to know if he can buy a new character or not<br/>
(or just clicks the button to see if it lets him). He knows who won when we<br/>
play against each other. He can read enough to know which menu to choose and<br/>
how to change options and settings as he sees fit. But because Daddy said<br/>
(in front of him) that he can&#39;t read, he isn&#39;t reading anymore. He has<br/>
memorized books (since he was 2) and when I ask him to read me those<br/>
stories, he says he can&#39;t read. I say he can read some, or he knows the<br/>
words of how the story goes and that is the beginning of reading. <br/>
 <br/>
Does this sound harsh? Is this familiar to anyone, having a spouse doubt<br/>
what you are doing when they are at work? He says this is his life we are<br/>
messing with and I say that&#39;s something I think about every day, and I will<br/>
not let him be squashed down by the public school system or have his spirit<br/>
crushed by anyone. I don&#39;t really want to think about divorce! Can we get to<br/>
a better talking place? What can be done when 2 parents have different ideas<br/>
of what is &quot;right&quot; for their mutual kid?!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is interesting to me because as time has gone on Jayn has become way <br/>
more intense than she was as an infant and toddler - at least that is my <br/>
perception of her. I would never have considered her intense at all when she <br/>
was 2 and 3 years old, especially compared to the stories others told.<br/>
<br/>
What is also interesting is the most recent issue of Skeptic magazine. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/index.html">http://www.skeptic.com/the_magazine/index.html</a> In it is an interview of two <br/>
scientists working on twin studies and looking at the old &quot;nature vs <br/>
nurture&quot; issue. One was asked what was the most surprising thing that he had <br/>
learnt. I&#39;m going to quote directly from my copy here.<br/>
<br/>
Tom Bouchard:<br/>
&quot;My really big surprise was that when we started studying twins reared apart <br/>
I clearly expected there would be some traits that were entirely <br/>
environmental and some others that were heavily influenced by <br/>
genetics....Well our first glance at the data...showed that this was clearly <br/>
wrong. When more data came in from other studies, including data from twins <br/>
who had not been separated, the answer became even more obvious - genetic <br/>
factors are important for almost every behavioral trait and become even more <br/>
so over time.<br/>
    One of the problems was that when we first analyzed the data we didn&#39;t <br/>
differentiate the twins by age. We were pooling observations from <br/>
adolescents, teenager and even adults. Well, we now know that there are <br/>
sizable environmental influences early in life, while genetic factors become <br/>
increasingly powerful over time. This is exactly the opposite of <br/>
conventional wisdom...We all assumed that environmental effects would <br/>
accumulate. So when you look at an adult, you&#39;d expect a larger influence <br/>
for environment and a lessened effect for genetics. It turned out to be <br/>
exactly the opposite.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They were looking at monozygotic twins reared apart and at families with <br/>
unrelated children close in age adopted into the family:<br/>
&quot;Monozygotic twins reared apart provide a good estimate of the influence of <br/>
common heredity; unrelated children adopted into the same home gauge the <br/>
influence of the common family environment.&quot;<br/>
(I am taking the word &quot;common&quot; here to mean &quot;shared&quot; rather than <br/>
&quot;ordinary&quot;.)<br/>
<br/>
I think this has clear implications for parenting, especially the importance <br/>
of Attachment Parenting in infancy.<br/>

that she has a number of avoidance/distraction behaviors when she is called <br/>
on her own unpleasant or uncool actions by her father or me, no matter how <br/>
gently. I still rely on somber silence a lot rather than verbally pointing <br/>
out the obvious, which gives her the chance to stop, reflect and choose to <br/>
change in her own time.<br/>

<br/>
Megan&#39;s &quot;cool new thing&quot; interest takes about two or three weeks<br/>
to fade.  Maybe your son&#39;s is three weeks?  Or until he finishes<br/>
the game?  Until Megan started finishing entire games I didn&#39;t <br/>
know it was possible!  I guess I thought the games went on<br/>
forever.  It was something I&#39;d never really thought about.  But <br/>
she is so proud to complete entire games and whenever<br/>
she starts a new game that is her goal.  The only game she<br/>
really wants to finish, but has not been able to is Ratatouille.<br/>

<br/>
He saw a preview for the Lego Batman game and began asking me to<br/>
take him to the store to buy it. Every day... can we go to Game<br/>
Stop? How about Target? I was kind of put off because I&#39;d just<br/>
spent $50 (oops, not true, I&#39;d bought it used for $40) on a game<br/>
he only played for 3 weeks! <br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
We use gamefly.com  It is like Netflix, but for video games.<br/>
Right now we have one game out at a time and it costs about <br/>
$15/month.  It gives Megan lots of variety for a good price.<br/>
There have been times when we had more games out a time <br/>
(one for DH or myself and one for Megan.  Or one for all of us<br/>
to play and one that just one of us is interested in)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I often retreat to my office in the basement late in the evening<br/>
to catch up on email, read group posts, or to do actual work<br/>
for my job, and leave the 2 of them in the living room. DS plays<br/>
wii and DH either reads a book, sleeps on the couch, or does<br/>
something on his laptop. At some point (1-2am?!) I will go <br/>
upstairs to find DH either asleep or gone to bed and DS still<br/>
playing wii. <br/>
<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Are you uncomfortable with your DH doing other things<br/>
while DS plays wii?  Maybe there&#39;s a wii game they could play<br/>
together?  Or is DH really needs to decompress maybe he could<br/>
hang out in your office space and read?  There are lots of tv<br/>
shows available online now.  Maybe you could find links (if <br/>
available) for your husband&#39;s favorite shows?  And then you<br/>
could hang out with DS and use the laptop if you need to?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It feels so weird for a 4yr old who has never gone to school<br/>
to be this way, and often feels like our family is out<br/>
of control. We only have 1 TV and DH is missing his shows a lot!<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Could you check freecycle or Craig&#39;s List for a second tv?  <br/>
Or maybe there is a way to transfer content from a dvr to a<br/>
computer?  How much pressure do you think would be removed if <br/>
you obtained a 2nd tv?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It bothers me that DS does not really want to do anything <br/>
besides play wii.  I did force an outing yesterday.  Then when<br/>
we were packing up to go, he said I want to go home and play wii.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
When Megan is going through a growth spurt she becomes a complete<br/>
homebody.  Can you plan on staying home for a week and just let <br/>
him play?  Without checking how long he&#39;s been going?  Can you<br/>
provide food and company and relax about the rest?  <br/>

<br/>
Good point.  The gaming TV wouldn&#39;t need a digital converter to play  <br/>
DVDS and computer games.  You could also put it in a part of the  <br/>
house that&#39;s far from the bedroom.   Don&#39;t put it in a cold garage or  <br/>
a scary or uncomfortable place, though.  That&#39;s the way some families  <br/>
penalize game playing, by making it very uncomfortable.  Think of  <br/>
reading on that one too.  What if your parents or spouse or landlord  <br/>
said &quot;Okay, you can read all you want, but only outside on the porch,  <br/>
by porchlight or flashlight&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I wish Jayn would let me go to bed while she stays up alone in the  <br/>
living room! She is too scared to be alone and cries. I can&#39;t drag  <br/>
her to the bedroom before she is ready to sleep because she disrupts  <br/>
dh&#39;s sleep with impatient, rowdy behavior.-=-<br/>
<br/>
My kids weren&#39;t that way, but we also had a larger living space, even  <br/>
when they were little, than I think Robyn has.  And having more than  <br/>
one child can sometimes make it easier.  If three people are asleep  <br/>
it&#39;s more alluring and persuasive than if one person is asleep, it  <br/>
seems here sometimes.  And Holly was five when we moved to a bigger  <br/>
house in which the kids had their own rooms.  They still could sleep  <br/>
with us or each other, and they did sometimes, and I slept with Holly  <br/>
a lot, so there were options and that added flexibility.<br/>
<br/>
We always had a &quot;quiet after 10:00&quot; deal, because Keith works early  <br/>
and I didn&#39;t want neighbors calling the county on me for not having  <br/>
my kids in the house and quiet.  And we&#39;ve had a &quot;quiet until noon&quot;  <br/>
deal (or until everyone&#39;s awake) so the kids could get enough sleep,  <br/>
even if they stayed up late.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-878431640">-=-I think there is a difference between a child throwing a remote  <br/>
because of<br/>
frustration with the game, which as I remember (perhaps wrongly) is  <br/>
the kind<br/>
of throwing that you have shared about before, Sandra, and parent  <br/>
induced<br/>
anger and frustration at being thwarted. There has been an  <br/>
interesting study<br/>
done with chimpanzees about the difference between &quot;unwilling&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;unable&quot;,<br/>
that is part of one episode of &quot;The Baby Human&quot;. Chimps and children can<br/>
see the difference between the two. Chimps get furious very fast by the<br/>
&quot;unwilling&quot; to give them the treat, (like taunting) and are sanguinely<br/>
acceptant of &quot;unable&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re right.  I hadn&#39;t really thought of that difference.  I was  <br/>
thinking of the cost of remote control replacement and finding ways  <br/>
for the child to deal peacefully, and sometimes that comes with age.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In the absence of punishments how did you insist that 10pm or the  <br/>
other conditions are complied with when your kids were that young and  <br/>
empathy had not yet awakened?-=-<br/>
<br/>
 From the time they were nursing babies, they would lie down with us  <br/>
when we went to sleep, or down next to me if I was up writing or  <br/>
watching a movie.  If we were out and they fell asleep on the way  <br/>
home, we&#39;d put them in bed.  Bed was always a nice and good thing,  <br/>
not a &quot;get in and stay in&quot; thing.  Sleep didn&#39;t have directly to do  <br/>
with bed.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/sleeping">http://sandradodd.com/sleeping</a><br/>
<br/>
I collected some stuff there (and I know Robyn and some others have  <br/>
seen it, and I&#39;m sure some of the newer list members didn&#39;t know it  <br/>
existed, so there it is).<br/>
<br/>
If I was too sleepy to stay awake and Kirby wanted to stay up (when  <br/>
he was very little) I would set up a soft, quiet situation for him,  <br/>
with a place to fall asleep in the living room (a futon and pillows  <br/>
and blankets, all set up in a nice way) and some non-messy and non- <br/>
noisy snacks in a bowl, and a sippy cup or a bottle of juice (because  <br/>
it&#39;s still good when it&#39;s warm, unlike milk), and remind him to be  <br/>
really quiet.<br/>
<br/>
When they were older and it wasn&#39;t just one kid up, sometimes they  <br/>
would get in an argument or just get to talking too loudly and I&#39;d  <br/>
come and say if they couldn&#39;t be quiet they needed to go to bed.   <br/>
Because we had a good relationship and they liked being able to stay  <br/>
up, they would be quiet or go to bed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;This behavior makes me unwilling to bring you back next time&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;People won&#39;t want to spend time with you if this is how you treat  <br/>
them&quot;. It feels horrible, even though it is truth at the time.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what the difference is.  Partly, I&#39;m not afraid to tell  <br/>
my kids what I think is true about the effects of their behavior.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t know if it&#39;s just personality differences or they&#39;ve seen me be  <br/>
right or what.   Did Jayn&#39;s ideas about her rights and the idea that  <br/>
she can refuse to leave a party when it&#39;s ended come from messages  <br/>
based on unschooling discussions?  Because if so, I think it set up a  <br/>
bad contract (without people having thought of it that way) way  <br/>
early--that she &quot;had rights&quot; to do what she wanted.    In our family  <br/>
it was always privilege and gift, so instead of one big &quot;do whatever  <br/>
forever&quot; that we had to be frustrated about it was &quot;Can I do this?&quot;   <br/>
Yes!   &quot;Can I do it longer?&quot;  Not this time, sorry.    &quot;Can I do it  <br/>
next time?&quot;  We can come back tomorrow, even.<br/>
<br/>
We went out of our way to find them cool opportunities and they were  <br/>
often (not always) aware that they had more fun lives than some other  <br/>
kids, and so they cooperated with us to maintain that mood and momentum.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Enacting &quot;you can watch tv in the bedroom as long as you are  <br/>
quiet&quot; in an attempt to sleep myself has been a disaster.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not something you can enact, when it&#39;s her behavior.  I would&#39;ve  <br/>
said &quot;It&#39;s just not okay.  I have a physical need to sleep, your dad  <br/>
has to go to work, NOBODY would think it&#39;s okay--not the neighbors,  <br/>
not child welfare, not the police, not a judge.  You can lie down  <br/>
next to me and be quiet, or you can listen to music with headphones,  <br/>
or you can watch a movie quietly, but those are  your choices right  <br/>
now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s frustrating because clearly conditions and/or &quot;if/then&quot;  <br/>
contracts have worked really well at Sandra&#39;s and Joyce&#39;s houses by  <br/>
their own histories, but their kids accepted them. And mine WON&#39;T.  <br/>
Maybe she&#39;s just flat contrary.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she&#39;s genetically resistent.  Maybe there are personality  <br/>
traits that are clashing with yours?  But I&#39;m suspecting that  <br/>
somewhere back there she was told she has rights that she doesn&#39;t  <br/>
naturally or legally have.  Maybe a bigger living space or a detached  <br/>
house would be important to move toward if you can.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-574068872">-=-I am worried about leaving him awake downstairs all<br/>
alone. It doesn&#39;t seem like 4 is old enough to allow that kind of  <br/>
behavior<br/>
(is this my mainstream brain talking?) and is it safe? Is it cruel or  <br/>
kind?-=-<br/>
<br/>
How could it be cruel?<br/>
<br/>
Can you sleep where he is?  That would help him learn to be quiet.  I  <br/>
think that helped with my kids, that they were doing things where  <br/>
someone else was sleeping quite often, and they did figure out to be  <br/>
quiet, and we were quiet for them when they were sleeping too.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s safe and he&#39;s not going to use knives or the stove or go  <br/>
outside, and if you would wake up if he called you, it doesn&#39;t seem  <br/>
dangerous to me.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. It is hard to make plans unless<br/>
<br/>
others are available in the afternoons or evenings. Will we ever get  <br/>
back on<br/>
a semi-normal sleep pattern? We can&#39;t even meet Daddy for lunch (our  <br/>
usual<br/>
fun bonding ritual) because when he calls at 1pm to make plans, Damon<br/>
probably just woke up and we&#39;re not ready to go anywhere.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If Damon&#39;s in on the plans, he could go to sleep with you, and maybe  <br/>
wake up early and play games when his dad goes to work, and then he&#39;d  <br/>
be awake at lunch.  It&#39;s a problem to try to make plans without  <br/>
everyone involved having had enough notice to  plan on being awake  <br/>
and ready.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I discovered that a lot of the frustration on the part of my  <br/>
husband is because he has to fight with his son for tv time,  <br/>
something he holds dear and uses as a way to unwind after a long day  <br/>
at work.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Get another TV.  That&#39;s easy.  They&#39;re not expensive anymore, and  <br/>
there are  used ones at thrift stores and TV repair shops.  You might  <br/>
ask on freecycle.  In the U.S., lots of people will be getting TVs  <br/>
for Christmas this year because the flat screens have become less  <br/>
expensive and there&#39;s a big signal conversion coming soon.  Maybe you  <br/>
could ask on a freecycle list to be the recipient of someone&#39;s old TV  <br/>
after Christmas, if you can&#39;t find one today or tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
A TV is less expensive than a single visit to a therapist.<br/>
<br/>
If your child were in school you&#39;d have that much expense just in  <br/>
clothes and lunches and transportation.  Unschooling isn&#39;t free.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I like the word passion better than obsession. I couldn&#39;t think of  <br/>
a better way to put it, I didn&#39;t want obsession to seem negative.  <br/>
Passion is better.-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652066456">-=-Well, we now know that there are<br/>
sizable environmental influences early in life, while genetic factors  <br/>
become<br/>
increasingly powerful over time. This is exactly the opposite of<br/>
conventional wisdom...We all assumed that environmental effects would<br/>
accumulate. So when you look at an adult, you&#39;d expect a larger  <br/>
influence<br/>
for environment and a lessened effect for genetics. It turned out to be<br/>
exactly the opposite.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen that in a lot of people, that they do become more like  <br/>
their parents when they reach their 30&#39;s and 40&#39;s, no matter how  <br/>
determined they were not to be.  The idea that 21 is &quot;grown&quot; does  <br/>
damage to people&#39;s expectations, too.  It&#39;s better to let them know  <br/>
that there&#39;s another kind of maturity around 30 (give or take a  <br/>
couple of years), and there&#39;s something yet again when they&#39;re 50  <br/>
(give or take five or ten years).<br/>
<br/>
It was VERY unpopular in the mid 20th century to say that things like  <br/>
dishonesty and irresponsibility could be inherited.  People stopped  <br/>
saying it, but it didn&#39;t stop manifesting itself all around them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think this has clear implications for parenting, especially the  <br/>
importance of Attachment Parenting in infancy.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It says much to adoption, too, thought that&#39;s too unpopular to say in  <br/>
the early 21st century.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246080922">-=-I was kind of put off because I&#39;d just spent $50 (oops, not true,  <br/>
I&#39;d bought<br/>
it used for $40) on a game he only played for 3 weeks! -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Only played for three weeks&quot;?  He SERIOUSLY and dedicatedly and  <br/>
intensely played for three whole weeks.  That was less than $15 a  <br/>
week.  Less than $3 a day.  At video arcade rates, fifty cents can go  <br/>
pretty quickly.  And he still owns the game, and might play it again  <br/>
in a few months or years.  My kids have very often gone back to games  <br/>
they played years before, and with their maturity and new skills they  <br/>
have an entirely different experience with the game.<br/>
<br/>
When my kids were babies I started reading magazines instead of the  <br/>
full fat history and biography and folklore research stuff I read  <br/>
before they came along.  Magazines were lighter (so if I dropped it  <br/>
reading I wouldn&#39;t wound a nursing baby) and if I got food on it it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t much loss, and if I put it down or lost it, ditto.<br/>
<br/>
I realized that it seemed to me that a magazine I read slowly was a  <br/>
better use of money than one I could zip through quickly.  Then I saw  <br/>
that if I bought a magazine and it was hard going or not really  <br/>
interesting enough for me to read quickly, that it was NOT a good use  <br/>
of money.<br/>
<br/>
So with a game, if it took him forever to get through it, that&#39;s not  <br/>
as good per dollar as something that captures his attention, that he  <br/>
can keep up with and really play.<br/>
<br/>
Is a three hour movie a better use of a movie ticket than a less-than- <br/>
two-hour movie?<br/>
<br/>
Is driving five miles to a boring, irritating friend&#39;s house a better  <br/>
use of gas money than driving twenty miles to a wonderful,  <br/>
interesting friend&#39;s house?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2107673183">***My son is 4 and loves to play wii. ***<br/>
<br/>
First off, I&#39;m totally amazed at a 4 year playing that much (having the attention span) and completing games!  Wow!  That&#39;s awesome :)<br/>
<br/>
***He saw a preview for the Lego Batman game and began asking me to take him to<br/>
<br/>
the store to buy it. Every day... can we go to Game Stop? How about Target?<br/>
<br/>
I was kind of put off because I&#39;d just spent $50 (oops, not true, I&#39;d bought<br/>
<br/>
it used for $40) on a game he only played for 3 weeks! ***<br/>
<br/>
3 weeks?  only 3 weeks?  That actually sounds like a pretty good amount of time to be spent on a game.  If you think of the money you spent per week, it&#39;s only $16-$17 per week.  If you broke it up into hours spent I&#39;m thinking it would put it into perspective too.  If your child was doing some other activity you would be paying a lot more per hour.  I&#39;m thinking of the art classes my daughter is taking right now..  adding in the art supplies and all that.<br/>
<br/>
Through our gaming years we&#39;ve run across some games that definitely have more playability than others.  But 3 weeks is a good amount of time.  I&#39;m talking we&#39;ve bought games and we&#39;ve seen in a couple of hours that it&#39;s pretty boring.  We&#39;ve chalked it up to experience and we&#39;ve learned.  Alec (ds15) now knows what type of games are worth his and our money, but that&#39;s taken some time to learn.<br/>
<br/>
I think others have said this, but can you get another TV?  Can you get another game system too?  Really.  It sounds like all of you enjoy it so why not delve into your passions?  My son recommends the X-box 360 for games for older peoples :)  and I LOVE our PS3.. such beautiful graphics.<br/>
<br/>
Remember he&#39;s only 4 also,  it will take some learning on his part that he can come back to his game.  I&#39;m thinking in reference to getting to meals or leaving the game.  I know lots of adults who have a hard time leaving what they are absorbed in,  and he&#39;s only 4.   I would also make sure there&#39;s lots of good food right by him too, protein is a must for us.<br/>
<br/>
I was also going to ask if he&#39;d be interested in learning more about karate or other martial arts?  It sounded like he was into that too.   I&#39;m sure there are studios around and he would have fun doing his kicks and moves with other people who like that too :)<br/>

&gt;holds dear and uses as a way to unwind after a long day at work. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;re in the same boat with our 3.9 y/o son, competing for screen time.  We<br/>
have TiVo, so lots of flexibility.  I&#39;ve also ripped about 50 of his<br/>
favorite DVD movies to AVI files.  And I often save his favorite shows off<br/>
the TiVo to a PC and convert those to AVI.  Besides the PC, we have 3<br/>
laptops in the house including his own, for YouTube and movies.  His laptop<br/>
has over 100 AVI files on it...all his favorite movies and shows, plus<br/>
several completely new ones that I&#39;m strewing on there.  And he has a Cowon<br/>
A2 which is a Portable Media Player (PMP) kinda like a video ipod, but<br/>
bigger, more features, and a 4&quot; screen and 10-hour video battery life.<br/>
<br/>
I got him his own laptop and the PMP several months ago, when I first sensed<br/>
any screen &quot;competition&quot;.  I was just looking for ways to expand his options<br/>
and *our* options (plus the PMP is awesome for plane and car trips...no<br/>
discs to organize/transport/scratch).  And it works, sometimes.  But here<br/>
lately when his mom or I want to watch something on the big screen, he<br/>
starts yelling for one of &quot;his&quot; shows.  It doesn&#39;t seem to matter how much<br/>
he&#39;s already watched that day.  If I&#39;m working from home that week instead<br/>
of flying away to a client, I&#39;m down in my basement office all day, and he<br/>
watches whatever he wants all day.  After I finish work, we wrestle and<br/>
otherwise play hard, then a couple hours later I start winding it down, tell<br/>
him I want to watch something on the TV so let&#39;s take some toys to the<br/>
couch, and 75% of the time he resists it.  We offer to put whatever he wants<br/>
on his laptop or PMP, including new DVD&#39;s he&#39;s never seen before (in his<br/>
laptop).  But, no, he wants to watch &quot;the big TV&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So we&#39;ve been talking about getting a second TV for several months, but it<br/>
doesn&#39;t seem like a good option.  Because, along with wanting to watch the<br/>
Big TV, he also wants one/both of us in the room *with* him.  Putting a TV<br/>
in the bedroom or guest room or downstairs in his basement playroom or in my<br/>
office...we&#39;ve offered all of those suggestions, and he nixes them.  He<br/>
wants to watch THE big TV, in the family room, with us there too, period.<br/>
It seems like the best option right now would be to put a second TV in the<br/>
family room, but then we&#39;d have the competing noise.  We all cosleep, so<br/>
we&#39;ve never setup a &quot;bedroom&quot; for him.  He has the entire big basement as a<br/>
play room, but that&#39;s it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not into TV that much.  I like watching MotoGP motorcycle racing when<br/>
it&#39;s in-season, and other than that I watch Jon Stewart and Colbert once or<br/>
twice per week (on the TiVo, not live, sometimes watching 2 or 3 episodes in<br/>
a row in one night, on Thursday).  With those, I just wait for him to fall<br/>
asleep, and help facilitate that by watching something with him until he&#39;s<br/>
dozing cradled in my arm.  He and I both love Spongebob and sometimes South<br/>
Park, so he falls asleep to one of those at least 2 or 3 nights per week.<br/>
He and I have gotten into the new Time Warp show (super-hi-speed cameras<br/>
freezing cool events) the last couple weeks.  And he/mom/I all enjoy Two and<br/>
a Half Men, although I think he mainly enjoys the audience laughter while<br/>
we&#39;re laughing at the raunchy humor (I had a roommate in the mid-90&#39;s who<br/>
was a narcissistic &quot;player&quot; type like Charlie, plus was a bodybuilder, so<br/>
Charlie is doubly funny to me).<br/>
<br/>
As of today, I think that even if I bought four new 40&quot; TV&#39;s and spread them<br/>
around the house, each with their own TiVo box and DVD player, he would<br/>
still want to watch whatever TV I/mom were interested in at that moment, but<br/>
with a different show (&quot;his show&quot;) on it.  We have a Wii, but he&#39;s not very<br/>
into it yet.  We all play it a total of 3-4 hours/week.  And if mom/I want<br/>
to play a Tennis match on it, for even a half hour, we have to wait until he<br/>
is VERY occupied with something (more difficult now that it&#39;s colder and the<br/>
big backyard isn&#39;t as attractive to him).  We have a sitter every Friday<br/>
night, and while we initially hired her so we could go out for a Date Night<br/>
(he doesn&#39;t like sit-down restaurants), about half the time we stay home.<br/>
He plays with the sitter downstairs (big basement), and we (as a couple,<br/>
with a 2-month-old attached to mama) read or snuggle.  Sometimes we&#39;d like<br/>
to watch TV or play Wii as a couple, watching a show that he wouldn&#39;t enjoy,<br/>
but we avoid that because the few times we&#39;ve tried it, he comes running<br/>
wanting one of &quot;his&quot; shows.<br/>
<br/>
No solutions for you Kim, but it&#39;s helping me to type this.  I do intend to<br/>
get a 2nd TV, as others have suggested.  I just don&#39;t know where in the<br/>
house it will go.  And I&#39;m still struggling to figure out the ways we the<br/>
parents are contributing to this Competition dynamic.  Back in the spring,<br/>
it was pretty obvious...my wife or I would just say, &quot;No, you&#39;ve had the Big<br/>
TV for X hours today, and now WE want to watch something, so that&#39;s what<br/>
we&#39;re going to do&quot; and we&#39;d spend 5 or 10 minutes trying to help him choose<br/>
something else to watch/do on his laptop holding and consoling him as he<br/>
cried about it, etc.  We were in a tense place in our marriage, she was<br/>
pregnant, I was more cranky, and the whole house had an edge to it.  And<br/>
even though his laptop is on the kitchen counter, really IN the family room,<br/>
he only seems to want to watch it when it&#39;s his idea.  If we ask if he wants<br/>
to watch some new and cool on his laptop, he resists.  Today is completely<br/>
different in that our marriage is solidly back on track, yet I&#39;m thinking<br/>
that those couple months of being more coercive/firm about the TV around<br/>
March/April are still playing out in his attitude and actions.  -=b.<br/>

<time> 3 Dec 2008, at  9:39am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1712336586">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Did Jayn&#39;s ideas about her rights and the idea that<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; she can refuse to leave a party when it&#39;s ended come from messages<br/>
&gt; based on unschooling discussions? &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all! That would be ridiculous. Nor have her father or I ever told her <br/>
she had that &quot;right&quot; which is nonsensical,  nor modelled persisting in <br/>
hanging around places we weren&#39;t welcome either. I would say that in her <br/>
mind she wasn&#39;t &quot;refusing to leave&quot; places; she was just wanting to keep on <br/>
swimming or playing with her friend, that on a few occasions have become <br/>
somewhat embarrassing power struggle - once with me that I can recall, and <br/>
once when she was with dh - but I won&#39;t assert that my memory is so <br/>
faultless that there may not have been a few more times that I just can&#39;t <br/>
remember, but these two times loom large.<br/>
<br/>
We often have visitors that don&#39;t want to leave when their parents say so <br/>
too, because they are having a great time. Sometimes it takes a few times <br/>
saying &quot;it&#39;s time to go&quot; and other words like &quot;we can come back soon&quot; for <br/>
them to leave willingly too. I don&#39;t think they are unschoolers, although <br/>
they may be.<br/>
<br/>
Also we weren&#39;t saying &quot;If you don&#39;t leave now you will never come back&quot; or <br/>
&quot;you will go into time out when we get home&quot; or &quot;you just lost tv for today&quot; <br/>
or &quot;do you want a smack&quot; or any of the stuff that make kids who want to stay <br/>
at fun, interesting places leave immediately when ordered to (supposedly).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; From the time they were nursing babies, they would lie down with us<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; when we went to sleep, or down next to me if I was up writing or<br/>
&gt; watching a movie.  If we were out and they fell asleep on the way<br/>
&gt; home, we&#39;d put them in bed.  Bed was always a nice and good thing,<br/>
&gt; not a &quot;get in and stay in&quot; thing.  Sleep didn&#39;t have directly to do<br/>
&gt; with bed. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So did Jayn. I&#39;ve written before about when she was younger on numerous <br/>
occasions. She just went to bed with us and nursed to sleep. She still falls <br/>
asleep on the sofa about half the time and I &quot;sleep-walk&quot; her into the <br/>
bedroom. I often think of you or Keith, Sandra, doing the same with your <br/>
kids, as you have reported.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&gt; Because we had a good relationship and they liked being able to stay<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; up, they would be quiet or go to bed. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This seems to be implying that Jayn and I don&#39;t have a good relationship, or <br/>
that any challenging behavior coming from our children must be because our <br/>
relationships with them aren&#39;t sufficient. I would be sad to think that this <br/>
is what you mean to say.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that Jayn and I do have a good relationship and that many of the <br/>
challenges I have, especially in being tired, are because she really does <br/>
want even more from me, even more of my attention and time and the fun we <br/>
have together. She wants me to play, draw, swim, write down her stories, <br/>
sew, read to her, make food, watch tv with her, play computer games, walk <br/>
around our favorite stores, listen to her adventures a lot, lot, lot. About <br/>
a 1000 percent more than I ever wanted my mother in my life at the age of 9. <br/>
You know that time versus age graph you made that is a diagonal line? Well <br/>
our graph looks like a horizontal line most of the time based on her <br/>
desires. Plus we laugh our asses off together.<br/>
<br/>
Our relationship is my priority.<br/>
<br/>
 &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; I would&#39;ve said &quot;It&#39;s just not okay.  I have a physical need to <br/>
sleep, your dad<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; has to go to work, NOBODY would think it&#39;s okay--not the neighbors,<br/>
&gt; not child welfare, not the police, not a judge.  You can lie down<br/>
&gt; next to me and be quiet, or you can listen to music with headphones,<br/>
&gt; or you can watch a movie quietly, but those are  your choices right<br/>
&gt; now.&quot; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Of course* I have said very similar things to this. We have had <br/>
conversations about child welfare and the possibility of other people <br/>
calling the police at different times including, I&#39;m sorry to say, in the <br/>
heat of my anger. She knows that I&#39;m tired if I have gone into bed. She <br/>
knows that dh has to sleep for work. And if she is in the bedroom poking me, <br/>
or pushing on dh with her feet and I say any of these things the next moment <br/>
she is crying even more loudly and coming up with more choices that involve <br/>
me getting up, and disturbing dh even more.<br/>
<br/>
No one ever told her this behavior was OK, appropriate, or acceptable, or <br/>
one of her choices. On the contrary I would remove her sometimes with a lot <br/>
of anger and frustration. &quot;That&#39;s not one of your choices&quot; is one of my <br/>
favorite phrases in making things clear to Jayn. Now I don&#39;t even try to <br/>
take her in to the bedroom or go in myself unless *she* is truly ready and <br/>
tired, because it isn&#39;t worth a battle.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the real crux of it. When Jayn is having some kind of issue that is <br/>
making her behavior challenging in my judgment, the answer is for me to <br/>
change what I can change - which is MY attitude and MY behavior and MY <br/>
responses. Because when I am trying to change who she is, the results are <br/>
anger and stress.<br/>
<br/>
Just like I put a lot of energy over the years into keeping her quiet rather <br/>
than disturb our neighbor below. Just like I would always take her for a <br/>
walk or carry drawing stuff rather than let her disrupt other diners in <br/>
restaurants. Just like I don&#39;t let her cut in lines but have various little <br/>
games and toys to keep it fun. Just like I didn&#39;t let her twirl in her <br/>
aunt&#39;s chotchkie filled living room. Just like I don&#39;t let her monopolise <br/>
the only swing at the park for hours. Just like I don&#39;t let her talk loudly <br/>
in the movie theater. Just like I ask her to keep her shoes on at the <br/>
grocery store. Just like I prevent her from touching things at museums. <br/>
(These last two are Jayn&#39;s cheerful contributions to this list).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; But I&#39;m suspecting that somewhere back there she was told she has <br/>
rights that she doesn&#39;t  naturally or legally have.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See above.<br/>
<br/>
This is stemming entirely from information that I have given in the course <br/>
of looking for help clarifying my thinking. I kinda thought I had pretty <br/>
much put this to rest with the reply I made the other day. I&#39;ve been <br/>
thinking it over since then, and truly I think it is temperament and <br/>
personality, not some wrong information that I&#39;ve given her. Have you more <br/>
reasons to believe this than what I have said over the last couple of days? <br/>
Is there something in any of my posts from long ago that you can remember <br/>
that I could look at?<br/>
<br/>
I think she is interested in finding how far her edges are in the world. I <br/>
see part of my role as parent to help her keep within the limits of decent <br/>
and lawful behavior, until such time as her own empathy and good sense show <br/>
her the value of those limits. In this I include such information as the <br/>
idea that people hearing a child screaming at 2am might call the police, and <br/>
the police might call CPS and while we have good food available and a <br/>
reasonably clean kitchen and bathroom, we would still be placed under <br/>
scrutiny and our freedoms within our home curtailed. I see the unschooling <br/>
angle being how I do this, with kindness and understanding and the <br/>
assumption that she is doing her best and will learn in time, without the <br/>
necessity for arbitrary &quot;practice&quot; limits or imposed punishments.<br/>
<br/>
And in the end, most of the time, really the vast majority of the time <br/>
unless she gets particularly hungry or is extra tired (which would be my <br/>
responsibility to notice the signs of and address), she is very pleasant, <br/>
kind, generous and courteous outside of our home with friends and strangers <br/>
both.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of days ago I found Jayn sitting a bit weepy on the sofa. She told <br/>
me that she is sorry she has been mean to me. I thanked her and she suddenly <br/>
said, &quot;I know it&#39;s been for about two years&quot;.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe such things should be said by every parent, when there is no  <br/>
anger.  These things are true.  It might be worth being sorry that it  <br/>
was said in anger, but I think it should be said.  I can&#39;t give my  <br/>
children permission to be more  noisy than courtesy or the law  <br/>
allows, without being answerable to the neighbors or the police.   <br/>
That&#39;s not anything to be sorry about.  We chose to live in town  <br/>
instead of out in the country and that affects the amount of noise we  <br/>
can make.<br/>
<br/>
-=-In this I include such information as the idea that people hearing  <br/>
a child screaming at 2am might call the police, and the police might  <br/>
call CPS and while we have good food available and a reasonably clean  <br/>

the necessity for arbitrary &quot;practice&quot; limits or imposed punishments.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems you&#39;re making suggestions to her about her own behavior  <br/>
(going by just that bit quoted above), and making it her choice and  <br/>
her responsibility.  What I said in such cases is &quot;It&#39;s my job to  <br/>
keep you inside and quiet, and if I don&#39;t do that we could have to  <br/>
deal with the police.&quot;  I would explain that the neighbors and the  <br/>
city expect them to be in bed, especially when most kids have school  <br/>
the next day, and so they either need to be in bed or be so quiet  <br/>
that the neighbors don&#39;t know they&#39;re awake.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked whether unschooling ideas were a factor the response was  <br/>
&quot;Not at all! That would be ridiculous.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ridiculous&quot; is not a good word to use when people are helping other  <br/>
people figure out how to live more peacefully.  &quot;Ridiculous&quot; means  <br/>
worthy of ridicule.  I don&#39;t like having honest questions called  <br/>
&quot;ridiculous.<br/>
<br/>
MANY (many) people have come through these lists saying &quot;I thought I  <br/>
had to let my kids do whatever they wanted to do,&quot; and &quot;When can I  <br/>
say no, if I&#39;m going to be an unschooler?&quot; and lots of other such  <br/>
unschooling-based fallacies with which they&#39;ve already upset the  <br/>
apple cart of their family&#39;s interpersonal relations.   They seem to   <br/>
have adopted some &quot;unschooling rules&quot; that tied the parents&#39; hands  <br/>
and tipped the relationship toward the child&#39;s &quot;rights&quot; and  <br/>
&quot;freedoms.&quot;   It&#39;s happened within the past month more than once, not  <br/>
just on this list.  It&#39;s not a silly question.  And with all other  <br/>
questions (although I&#39;m sorry I particularlized it by using Jayn&#39;s  <br/>
name), if others on the list wonder it of their own situations, they  <br/>
clarify.<br/>
<br/>
When people read these discussions they can become clearer on what  <br/>
they believe by whether things sound true and useful or off and wrong  <br/>
to them.  That&#39;s fine!  That&#39;s how people clarify and sharpen their  <br/>
own arguments and reasons.<br/>
<br/>
-=-A couple of days ago I found Jayn sitting a bit weepy on the sofa.  <br/>
She told me that she is sorry she has been mean to me. I thanked her  <br/>
and she suddenly said, &quot;I know it&#39;s been for about two years&quot;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s interesting, and cool.<br/>
<br/>
Holly cried very hard once because she had been mean to a friend of  <br/>
hers.  They were 12 or so.  That girl had been awful to Holly, to her  <br/>
face and behind her back, for years, but when Holly finally came to  <br/>
the point that she felt she had been mean, she was in tears.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I see the unschooling angle being how I do this, with kindness  <br/>
and understanding and the assumption that she is doing her best and  <br/>
will learn in time, without the necessity for arbitrary &quot;practice&quot;  <br/>
limits or imposed punishments.-=--=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t agree with practice limits or punishments, but I don&#39;t always  <br/>
assume my kids are doing their best.  And if something isn&#39;t  <br/>
discussed or pointed out, they might &quot;learn in time&quot; that they can do  <br/>
it lots, and it can become a habit that will be harder to break later  <br/>
than if they&#39;d been asked to change it sooner.  I don&#39;t mind a bit  <br/>
trying to help my children behave in more socially acceptable ways,  <br/>
or to see (which they&#39;re good at) that there are better and worse  <br/>
times and places for certain behaviors.  I asked them when they were  <br/>
little not to eat with their mouths open or to bite their forks or to  <br/>
make noise when they drink.  It wasn&#39;t a big deal.   It was changing  <br/>
them, but they don&#39;t mind assistance to fit in more smoothly and  <br/>
comfortably in the world.  I&#39;ve changed a lot over the years I&#39;ve had  <br/>
kids, too--sometimes from ideas other parents shared with me, and  <br/>
sometimes from things my kids or my  husband said might be better  <br/>
done another way.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an unschooling angle, necessarily, to assume that  <br/>
a child is doing her best in every instance.  People don&#39;t always do  <br/>
their best.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1804619909">Just because you son has completed that game it does not mean he is done with it forever.<br/>
My son is 6 and started playing the a Nintendo DS at 4 and we than got the Wii a few months before he was 5.<br/>
He has completed some games and than months or even a year later he comes back to them and does some of it. What happens is that <br/>
at different ages they may get different things from the games. Or like you said my son has gone back to a completed game to do the secrets and extra stuff.<br/>
Also since my son is now able to read a little bit he can read some stuff that he could not before.<br/>
I have completed Super Paper Mario on Wii and I loved that game and sometimes I go back to some fun parts just because.<br/>
We do that a lot with Mario Galaxy ( I highly recommend for you son).<br/>
Its such a fun and pretty game.<br/>
Go ahead and get him the Lego Star Wars for Wii. It is very much like the Indiana Jones and he will love it.<br/>
We have it also in the Nintendo DS so my son can take with him when we go out.<br/>
Having and Nintendo DS makes it a lot easier to leave the house or go to bed since you can sit in bed and play ans just turn around and sleep.<br/>
I even have one for me with my games.<br/>

YOu know it has worked for us for years to have one TV right next to the other. We have had no problem with the noise really.<br/>
Its like being in a group of people with two conversations going on at the same time. You kind of tune out the other with no problem.<br/>
you can also get headphones for TV. Even wireless ones.<br/>

look at games as toys. And a $40 toy we expect to be played with for  <br/>
a long time. But if you see it as entertainment, it looks different.  <br/>
Where else can you buy 3 solid weeks of entertainment for $40? For an  <br/>

you spent $60 on dinner that lasted maybe 2 hours tops? A movie at a  <br/>
theater can easily be $40 for 3 people if you eat there, more if you  <br/>
have dinner before hand even at McDonalds.<br/>
<br/>
And, if he&#39;s ready to give up a game (and it&#39;s okay if he isn&#39;t),  <br/>
check out selling them on Amazon. You can get a much better deal  <br/>
selling them there than at GameStop.<br/>

What it stirs for me right now is the idea of &quot;fill his cup&quot;, emotionally<br/>
and otherwise.  I don&#39;t remember if I originally got the concept from<br/>
unschooling philosophy, unconditional parenting (Alfie Kohn), TCS, Scott<br/>
Noelle&#39;s ideas of &quot;attraction parenting&quot;, or somewhere else in the<br/>
reading/thinking I&#39;ve done, but in most situations where there&#39;s a question<br/>
of &quot;fairness&quot; or a competition for a resource such as the TV, I try to look<br/>
for an underlying need that&#39;s not getting met...for attention or time with<br/>
me or whatever it might be.  I have chosen to believe that if John&#39;s cup is<br/>
full, if his needs/wants are fully met, then we have less drama overall in<br/>
the house.  And experimentally/experientially, this seems to be the case.<br/>
Some days, trying to get everything done, it feels like a high-minded ideal.<br/>
But in those times (especially on the weekends) when I can get away from<br/>
corporate life and earning money and other adult concerns, and completely<br/>
connect with John for uninterrupted hours and hours, life flows magically.<br/>
On those days, he&#39;ll *want* to watch motorcycle racing with me on TV,<br/>
instead of complaining about it as soon as I turn it on and insisting it&#39;s<br/>
&quot;his turn&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Days when we&#39;re connected like that, nothing I say or do or offer to him is<br/>
challenged or questioned.  He&#39;s happy-go-lucky.  Life is fun.  Problems are<br/>
solved easily and quickly.  Other days, when the attachment/connection is<br/>
weaker, it feels like all day is one drama after another.  Problems get<br/>
solved, but it doesn&#39;t feel like we&#39;re solving the &quot;right&quot; problems.  And<br/>
attempts to talk and reason through things are met with his high-pitched<br/>
scream voice to loudly drown out my attempts to calmly offer any of the<br/>
several other options.<br/>
<br/>
So if his figurative &quot;cup&quot; were full, I don&#39;t think there would ever be a<br/>
need for a physical representation like you described...a way to demonstrate<br/>
how much time he got on a resource such as the TV, to somehow convince him<br/>
that it&#39;s &quot;enough for now&quot;, and now it&#39;s my turn.<br/>
<br/>
I say all this to say that, even though I&#39;d be willing to spend $2000<br/>
outfitting every room in the house with a home entertainment system to<br/>
increase his/our options (all except the master bedroom, where my wife<br/>
believes it would be bad feng shui to have a screen), it doesn&#39;t seem like<br/>
I&#39;d be solving the &quot;right&quot; problem.  -=b.<br/>
