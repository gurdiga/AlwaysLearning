<div id="ygrps-yiv-531186462">Hi Barbara!<br/>
 <br/>
I saw your post and I wanted to pass along a few ideas that seemed <br/>
to work for our family.<br/>
 <br/>
I have 3 boys (12, 7, and 6) and we are unschoolers, and they all <br/>
love the challenges of the computer, but as you said some of the <br/>
games we have were &quot;dumbing them down&quot;.<br/>
 <br/>
So the boys really &quot;fell into&quot; these really, but how about real life <br/>
games, like Rollercoster Tycoon, monopoly tycoon, moon tycoon. There <br/>
are many different versions out there, you can try scholastic&#39;s <br/>
website for some or your local computer stores too!<br/>
 <br/>
These games teach real life skills like how to design and build and <br/>
run your own park, real estate or space homes. Everything from <br/>
purchasing land to budgeting to handling satisfied and unsatisfied <br/>
customers, keeping the parks cleaning and staying in the black <br/>
instead of in the red in your own business and much more are <br/>
all &quot;real life skills&quot; that she can learn while at the same time <br/>
have fun too! :)<br/>
 <br/>
They are so much fun to play and she is learning too! :) And they <br/>
are a great adventure which I know you said she likes! :)<br/>
 <br/>
Hope this helps! :)<br/>
Good Luck and let me know if she likes them if you try them! :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1497893986">We have free trial download versions of zoo tycoon and zoo tycoon marine park.  My girls do enjoy them.  Lisa likes SIMS, too.<br/>
<br/>
I just got a copy of Kid Pix 3.  I bought it on ebay packaged together with Print Shop, both for under $8 including shipping.<br/>
<br/>
I installed kid pix yesterday and had a blast playing with it myself.  Lisa played for about 5 minutes and Jackie hasn&#39;t even peeked at it yet.<br/>
<br/>
I did buy it with Jackie in mind, as she does a lot of drawing.  Lisa, who is more likely to create with words than with pictures, actually has spent more time using our computer art programs.<br/>
