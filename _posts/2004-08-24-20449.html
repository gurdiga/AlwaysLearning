&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve met some wonderful parents that have married lifestyle and <br/>
<br/>
unschooling, and now can tell the differences between which <br/>
<br/>
unschooling families &quot;do&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t&quot;.  I hope I&#39;m making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense to me.   Unschooling works best when the children&#39;s learning <br/>
isn&#39;t limited (in the parents&#39; mind) to school subjects.  That&#39;s a big given, <br/>
most of us would probably say, but there are lots of people who want to say <br/>
unschooling is nothing more than not using a curriculum.  And I think they&#39;re <br/>
right, at a basic definition level.<br/>
<br/>
If someone takes that definition home and says &quot;Now I am an unschooler,&quot; and <br/>
simply lives in the absence of a curriculum, without changing any behaviors or <br/>
philosophies or expectations, I dont think it will be long before he&#39;s trying <br/>
unit studies, or looking for a curriculum, or putting the kids back in school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds.<br/>
It&#39;s simple, but not easy.<br/>
<br/>
Still, there are people who don&#39;t want to be disturbed by too much detailed <br/>
recommendation on life changes.  And that&#39;s fine.   I don&#39;t make a commission <br/>
when someone decides to unschool or anything. My own kids are very happy and <br/>
whole.  I didn&#39;t need others to give me permission to do what I did, past the <br/>
legal options which were pretty wonderful to have!<br/>
<br/>
In May there were problems on a list Home Education Magazine sponsored, and <br/>
three or four of the main writers there went off to form their own list for <br/>
beginners.  I wasn&#39;t on either list (Unschooling101 or UnschoolingBasics), but in <br/>
the discussions of the weekend, I predicted that either unschooling.com was <br/>
going to be shut down or that I would lose my column.<br/>
<br/>
A week later I received a short note from Helen Hegener saying she was <br/>
dropping my column.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know until the July issue arrived whether I would be in that one.  I <br/>
was, so Stephanie, if you didn&#39;t get the July issue you missed the last <br/>
column of mine in there.  Sorry.  But now that September&#39;s out, I&#39;ll put it online. <br/>
 It&#39;s called &quot;Playing.&quot;  I&#39;ll try to do that today and put the URL here.  <br/>
I&#39;ll also announce it on the announcement list I keep which anyone can subscribe <br/>
to.  That&#39;s linked two places:<br/>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/articles">http://sandradodd.com/articles</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-I hope that Sandra continues to write, it needs an unschooling <br/>
perspective.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems the magazine would like to move toward there not having a <br/>
specifically-separate unschooling perspective (I haven&#39;t seen the new issue), but <br/>
unschooling being presented as just another point on the how-much-structure <br/>
continuum.    And in a way that&#39;s all it is.  In a legal way that&#39;s all it is.  And <br/>
that&#39;s important at that level.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not as though I&#39;ve ever stopped writing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a new magazine that just started up called Live Free / Learn Free.  <br/>
I have an artile in their first issue, which is out.  You can get info on that <br/>
by writing here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:folkypoet@...">folkypoet@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I wrote about Kirby not going to college yet, and how his dad and I felt <br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday morning Holly and I will be going to Massachusetts for a week to <br/>
confer, converse, and otherwise hobnob with my fellow unschoolers, and to spend a <br/>
few days with Joyce Fetteroll and her family.  She and Kathryn visited us a <br/>
couple of years ago, and I&#39;m anxious to see her house and her neighborhood.  <br/>
Most of the moderators of this list will be in Massachusetts, so don&#39;t get too <br/>
wild while we&#39;re gone, please. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

Sandra,  this really bums me out.  :(    Yours was the first column I would turn to when I got the mag.<br/>

<br/>
It does seem like it (HEM) is trying to separate itself from unschooling.   Or I guess maybe from those of us who live our lives as unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been wondering if that&#39;s why the message boards have been down.  Is it going to come back all revamped and we won&#39;t recognize it and it won&#39;t be as unschooly? But how can that be?  It&#39;s unschooling.com?  hmmmmmmm.... Maybe I&#39;m getting paranoid.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
<br/>
I know,  but I liked it there too,  you would reach that many more people.  If Helen and others could see how much our lives have benefited in pushing unschooling to the limits.  Pushing it into our lives.  Living an unschooling life, not just &#39;not using a curriculum&#39;.    <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll stop now and save the rest of my rant for a letter to HEM.<br/>

<br/>
To those of you who are going to the conference,  see you there!  I&#39;m so glad that the Live and Learn Conference will be true Unschooling!   :))<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not attending to sign up with a program that does your reporting and <br/>
gives you $1500 or something.  It is being registered.  But LOTS of states make <br/>
homeschoolers register.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not attending public school to go to a parochial schoo, either, but it&#39;s <br/>
not homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not attending public school OR being registered with a school district <br/>
to sign up with Clonlara, but instead of them giving you money, you give them <br/>
money.   Yet that&#39;s considered to be homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not an easy place to draw a line.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Helen is aware but not in the immersive, living it way radical unschoolers<br/>
are. People have told her it&#39;s life changing for them. (And others have said<br/>
how mean everyone is too.)<br/>
<br/>
The problem is that in order to get that life, people need to let go of<br/>
certain conventions and thoughts. But not everyone is willing to let go of<br/>
so much to get that.<br/>
<br/>
Helping people let go involves defining what is and isn&#39;t unschooling. But<br/>
Helen doesn&#39;t want to define unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I think what Helen wants is to define (without actually spelling it out)<br/>
unschooling as learning by living and to create a place where anyone who is<br/>
drawn to the idea can get together and share their journeys. She doesn&#39;t<br/>
want to impose her definition on people. She wants them to come to their own<br/>
definition.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with the idea -- but with a lot of caveats. ;-) I think lots of<br/>
families could benefit from understanding and seeing in action that kids<br/>
learn by living, even if the parents couldn&#39;t fully let go. Best is everyone<br/>
radically unschooling :-) But that&#39;s not going to happen! Better could be<br/>
more people letting go of as many schoolish concepts of learning as they&#39;re<br/>
comfortable with -- as Pat Farenga defines unschooling -- because they can<br/>
see people who are letting go of all of that and kids still learn.<br/>
<br/>
I do think UnschoolingDiscussion, AlwaysLearning and unschoolingbasics (and<br/>
perhaps others I don&#39;t know about) offer that information. *But*, as a side<br/>
effect, the comraderie on the lists tends to be limited to radical<br/>
unschoolers which means others who like some of the ideas can feel excluded.<br/>
<br/>
(Not intentionally. It&#39;s just a natural side effect of any group that&#39;s<br/>
drawn together around an idea. If someone is drawn to the comraderie of the<br/>
group but not to the idea, they&#39;re going to feel excluded when it&#39;s pointed<br/>
out that they haven&#39;t embraced the idea that&#39;s drawn the group together.)<br/>
<br/>
So I agree with the concept of creating a place for people to hang out who<br/>
are drawn to some of the ideas of unschooling. The flaw, though, is that<br/>
without a group that&#39;s actively at the radical end, showing people how far<br/>
it&#39;s possible to go, the group will tend towards choices based on comforting<br/>
fears.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the set up at AOL was great. There were folders for all styles. It<br/>
felt like one big community without having to interact with everyone in the<br/>
community. People could &quot;go elsewhere&quot; (a different place under the same<br/>
roof) when advice didn&#39;t suit them without having to &quot;go elsewhere&quot; (out<br/>
into the big world of 10,000 unfamiliar doors to choose from) :-)<br/>
<br/>
(I wonder if I were starting out today if I&#39;d find unschooling. I started<br/>
out so far away and there&#39;s so much information available now that I would<br/>
think it&#39;s hard to sample a bit of everything. Investigating just one aspect<br/>
of homeschooling could feel like a full time committment!)<br/>
<br/>
Ideally there could be something similar for &quot;unschooling&quot; (defining it<br/>
broader than here). There could be a Radical Unschooling folder and then<br/>
other folders for other definitions of unschooling. That way people could<br/>
choose without feeling it&#39;s radical or nothing.<br/>
<br/>
*I* have zero interest in creating a place like that. ;-) But I would like<br/>
to see radical unschooling ideas out there for people to sample easily to<br/>
give another avenue for the idea that there&#39;s something other than<br/>
control/neglect to trickle out along into mainstream society.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
There are a lot of unschooling lists out there.  Some are more radical than<br/>
others.  I think there is a place for all of them.  I liken it to<br/>
Christianity.  All the different churches believe in the same general<br/>
philosophy, but what it means to them differs from church to church.  Some<br/>
unschooling lists have a broader view of what unschooling is and lots of<br/>
people feel comfortable in that setting. Not often is someone told they<br/>
aren&#39;t unschooling, although they might offer alternatives to what is not<br/>
working or ways to lighten up and follow their children&#39;s lead.  Other lists<br/>
are more radical and included in the discussion are the more radical<br/>
parenting ideas.  <br/>
 <br/>
I have been on different unschooling lists for almost 4 years, I think.<br/>
(feels longer) At different times I&#39;ve gotten more benefit out of different<br/>
lists.  I&#39;ve joined this list off and on over the last couple years and each<br/>
time that I left I left with an issue to work through.  (TV, setting own<br/>
bedtimes, other parenting issues)  Things I&#39;ve read here have made me<br/>
uncomfortable at times precisely because they challenged my thinking.  I<br/>
have grown more from the more radical lists than from any other lists.  That<br/>
doesn&#39;t lessen the value of the other lists.  They served their purpose.<br/>
Two different lists particularly helped me through those times when I<br/>
started to panic and lose my confidence in the process of learning. I needed<br/>
their gentleness at that time, I think.  But now, I need the directness of<br/>
this list.  I am confident in the unschooling part but I could still learn<br/>
more about the parenting end of things.  I&#39;ve relaxed dramatically over the<br/>
years on that end, but I am sure I still have more to learn.  This list<br/>
challenges me to think about everything and to live life in this moment.  At<br/>
this time in my life, I need a list like this one.<br/>

really thought unschooling was different.<br/>
<br/>
Over a year or so, those who only kind of unschooled wandered off, though, <br/>
because you can&#39;t get much fire up over &quot;I don&#39;t use a curriculum.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;I do, but I wrote my own.&quot;  <br/>
&quot;Oh.  Cool!&quot;<br/>
&quot;So how do you teach reading?&quot;<br/>
&quot;We make him sound out words, but if he&#39;s not reading by summer, we&#39;re <br/>
putting him in school.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Well that makes sense.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I made those quotes up, but I have read similar things since I joined the <br/>
homeschool BB at *Prodigy.   Just lame, half-hearted, unexamined half-baked ideas <br/>
without solid basis, without commitment, without principle, philosophy or <br/>
fervor.   It doesn&#39;t lead to unschooling.  It leads back to the belief that some <br/>
curriculum somewhere is the right way, or that at least you tried and now your <br/>
kids can go back to school.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;ve met some wonderful parents that have married lifestyle and <br/>
<br/>
unschooling, and now can tell the differences between which <br/>
<br/>
unschooling families &quot;do&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t&quot;.  I hope I&#39;m making sense!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It makes sense to me.   Unschooling works best when the children&#39;s learning <br/>
isn&#39;t limited (in the parents&#39; mind) to school subjects.  That&#39;s a big given, <br/>
most of us would probably say, but there are lots of people who want to say <br/>
unschooling is nothing more than not using a curriculum.  And I think they&#39;re <br/>
right, at a basic definition level.<br/>
<br/>
If someone takes that definition home and says &quot;Now I am an unschooler,&quot; and <br/>
simply lives in the absence of a curriculum, without changing any behaviors or <br/>
philosophies or expectations, I dont think it will be long before he&#39;s trying <br/>
unit studies, or looking for a curriculum, or putting the kids back in school.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t as easy as it sounds.<br/>
It&#39;s simple, but not easy.<br/>
<br/>
Still, there are people who don&#39;t want to be disturbed by too much detailed <br/>
recommendation on life changes.  And that&#39;s fine.   I don&#39;t make a commission <br/>
when someone decides to unschool or anything. My own kids are very happy and <br/>
whole.  I didn&#39;t need others to give me permission to do what I did, past the <br/>
legal options which were pretty wonderful to have!<br/>
<br/>
In May there were problems on a list Home Education Magazine sponsored, and <br/>
three or four of the main writers there went off to form their own list for <br/>
beginners.  I wasn&#39;t on either list (Unschooling101 or UnschoolingBasics), but in <br/>
the discussions of the weekend, I predicted that either unschooling.com was <br/>
going to be shut down or that I would lose my column.<br/>
<br/>
A week later I received a short note from Helen Hegener saying she was <br/>
dropping my column.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know until the July issue arrived whether I would be in that one.  I <br/>
was, so Stephanie, if you didn&#39;t get the July issue you missed the last <br/>
column of mine in there.  Sorry.  But now that September&#39;s out, I&#39;ll put it online. <br/>
 It&#39;s called &quot;Playing.&quot;  I&#39;ll try to do that today and put the URL here.  <br/>
I&#39;ll also announce it on the announcement list I keep which anyone can subscribe <br/>
to.  That&#39;s linked two places:<br/>

-=-I hope that Sandra continues to write, it needs an unschooling <br/>
perspective.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It seems the magazine would like to move toward there not having a <br/>
specifically-separate unschooling perspective (I haven&#39;t seen the new issue), but <br/>
unschooling being presented as just another point on the how-much-structure <br/>
continuum.    And in a way that&#39;s all it is.  In a legal way that&#39;s all it is.  And <br/>
that&#39;s important at that level.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s not as though I&#39;ve ever stopped writing. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There is a new magazine that just started up called Live Free / Learn Free.  <br/>
I have an artile in their first issue, which is out.  You can get info on that <br/>
by writing here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:folkypoet@...">folkypoet@...</a><br/>
<br/>
I wrote about Kirby not going to college yet, and how his dad and I felt <br/>
about that.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday morning Holly and I will be going to Massachusetts for a week <br/>
conference. . .<br/>
<br/>
[And the saved post ended right there, so I&#39;m guessing I never mailed it.]<br/>
========<br/>
<br/>
Live Free/Learn Free has had three issues and seems to be doing well!<br/>
<br/>
Since the shakeup of six or eight months ago, I&#39;ve seen other situations in <br/>
which a choice is made between politics and philosophy.  It&#39;s can be rough for <br/>
all involved.  But it comes back to principles and priorities.  For me, a <br/>
learning environment is primary.  Government funding doesn&#39;t enter into my <br/>
thinking.    For people who are and wish to be political activists, my attitude might <br/>
seem irresponsible.  But I&#39;ve seen political activists whose children&#39;s needs <br/>
come second to political action.  It&#39;s just a different set of priorities.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m interested in discussing the nature of unschooling further, if this isn&#39;t <br/>
WAY, way too old a post. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
