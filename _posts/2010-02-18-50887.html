I&#39;m not saying that when someone gets hit by a car it&#39;s school&#39;s  <br/>
fault, but I will say that high school does not prepare you for the  <br/>
real world.<br/>
<br/>
(High schools having school zones)<br/>

She was commenting on the laws here, by which an elementary school has  <br/>
a schoolzone speed of 15 miles per hour, it&#39;s 20 for a middle school,  <br/>
and 25 mph for a high school.<br/>
<br/>
There.  A perspective from an 18 year old who never spent her days  <br/>
within a schoolzone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1814716665">It&#39;s funny, I just copied and pasted a facebook set of comments of Chamille and some person she doesn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
The background is this... Chamille has a friend that broke up with another friend.  She broke up with him to get back together with another boy, who happens to be cruel and abusive.<br/>
<br/>
So Chamille wrote this on the girl&#39;s facebook page:<br/>
<br/>
Chamille: STUPID CHOICE MAKER, STUPID STUPID STUPID! you were seriously famazing :[ f**king cool too.<br/>
<br/>
Other Person:  Everyone makes mistakes<br/>
<br/>
Chamille: some mistakes are avoidable. I wouldn&#39;t say it was a mistake, just a bad choice.<br/>
<br/>
Other Person: Its the same thing<br/>
<br/>
Another Person chimed in: no she didnt have to hang out with him in the first place<br/>
<br/>
Other Person:  Maybe she didnt. But choices are made that are bad. And mistakes are the outcome. I could say some things that you have done. But im not going to. youve made worse<br/>
<br/>
Chamille: a mistake is more something along the lines of doing something and then realizing it was wrong, a bad choice is something you do that you KNOW is gonna turn out bad. usually.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think Chamille&#39;s got a pretty good idea about the difference between making mistakes and making choices.  That thought &quot;everyone makes mistakes&quot; is so pervasive.  Of course everyone makes mistakes, one can&#39;t say that isn&#39;t true, but Chamille is right, some mistakes are avoidable by making good choices.  The girl in question wasn&#39;t making a mistake, she was making a choice, to call it anything else would be untrue.  That pat on the back of &quot;everyone makes mistakes&quot; might help the girl feel better about her choice when the inevitable happens and the boy pushes her down the stairs again, but it doesn&#39;t change the fact that she made a choice.<br/>

Yet another unschooled teen saying wise things!<br/>
