<div id="ygrps-yiv-410107195">Knowledge is power--its an adage I firmly believe. It occurs to me that<br/>
parents worry about appropriateness they often want to protect their child&#39;s<br/>
&quot;innocence&quot; about sexual humour or &quot;real life&quot;.   I remember as a child<br/>
reading and watching &quot;inappropriate things&quot;.  I would watch inappropriately<br/>
sexual movies or violent movies on television late at night as my parents<br/>
slept.  I watched Love American Style when I was young.  So, as an eleven<br/>
year old girl I knew how to avoid child molesters, knew that the creepy men<br/>
offering car rides or conversation were not always safe.<br/>
<br/>
I also knew how to recognize safe situations and safe adults, too.  I<br/>
developed through tv and books deemed too old a safe way to experience the<br/>
world.  Everything contradicted everything else; so I learned to make<br/>
decisions and choices that seemed logical to me.<br/>
<br/>
Most fears protecting children from sexual &quot;knowledge&quot;  are misplaced.<br/>
 Judgement and knowledge are important skills we should all foster.  I think<br/>
after finding myself targeted by creepy men and one woman as a child under<br/>
the age of thirteen I was able to understand what was happening, but<br/>
unfortunately couldn&#39;t tell the appropriate adults in a manner that would<br/>
not have them gasping in horror at my precocious and inappropriate<br/>
knowledge.  How to explain why and how I understood this person&#39;s interest<br/>
and keep myself safe were not possible in the world adults constructed for<br/>
cute innocent little girls.<br/>
<br/>
I remember at a camping trip organized by the Catholic School I went to one<br/>
of the employees was very interested in me.  He sat next to me and as he<br/>
flattered me my guard was up.  The moment his hand touched my thigh and<br/>
creeped higher toward my groin, I knew to avoid him and without missing a<br/>
beat looked him in the eye and intercepted his hand as it reached my groin<br/>
and moved it.  He felt safe enough doing this as other children and teachers<br/>
at the school sat having dinner.  Ah, the long tablecloths. I changed seats<br/>
and gave him a long glare. He started chatting with another girl on the<br/>
other side of him. I had to play a very scary cat and mouse game.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I did not enjoy the trip.  I couldn&#39;t tell my friends or the<br/>
guardians responsible for my well-being about creepyman&#39;s creepy behaviour.<br/>
 I did feel very smug when I reached home that I had outsmarted the man who<br/>
had wanted to &quot;touch&quot; me.  I wasn&#39;t sure whether he would have raped me:  it<br/>
scared me and angered me.  But I had a lot of bravado and indignation.<br/>
 Looking back I can&#39;t believe the situations I managed to get myself out of<br/>
and back then my secret weapon was that they (the sexual predators) did not<br/>
expect me to &quot;recognize&quot; or contextualize their behaviour. I could also not<br/>
tell my parents about the creepy situations because then I would have had to<br/>
explain the years of sneaking inappropriate books and watching inappropriate<br/>
movies.<br/>
<br/>
I remember one man at a family reunion asking one of the younger kids to get<br/>
me to go into a dark bedroom where he was waiting on a water bed.  Years<br/>
later the younger cousin as a teen, who still remembered the incident after<br/>
the man who hadn&#39;t been a blood relative was divorced from his &quot;ticket&quot; into<br/>
the family, said he was really horrified by what could have happened to me.<br/>
 He realized with horror what the man&#39;s talk about how pretty I was meant<br/>
and he could get over his part in trying to trick me into going upstairs to<br/>
be alone with this guy.  He said he couldn&#39;t believe what happened when he<br/>
thought about it and I said it was fine, because  I had known as soon as I<br/>
swung the door open not go in the room and what to say.  We marveled at the<br/>
things that had gone on under the noses of our parents.<br/>
<br/>
But they knew more I discovered years later when my cousin&#39;s mother and I<br/>
talked.  I said one of the things that hurt me the most as a girl was when<br/>
she took a picture I had given her down.  She said she took the picture down<br/>
after a couple of grown men had made inappropriate comments about me as a<br/>
 thirteen year old, and she was worried about me starting to draw<br/>
inappropriate attention.  I remember her face when I told her some of the<br/>
stories had happened before I&#39;d even turned thirteen.<br/>
<br/>
I even had memorized Statutory Rape Law, and could spout it.  I&#39;d have to<br/>
say the line between scaring a child straight with discipline for her own<br/>
good and a child understanding humour or danger is blurred by most parents.<br/>
Having someone safe to talk to and having a safe space to encounter<br/>
situations is a good thing. Knowing &quot;sexual humour&quot; or understanding how to<br/>
judge adult intentions was a positive factor for me.  Being able to tell<br/>
adults around me about other adults being dangerous and the reasons why they<br/>
were would have probably saved other children from danger and possibly harm.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
As I meet more and more adults who weren&#39;t lucky enough to recognize<br/>
predators--good little girls who had their innocence and obedience create<br/>
havoc in their lives I wonder at the idea of sheltering children we have<br/>
created.  In older days on farms children saw life, death and sex through<br/>
the life of animals.  We don&#39;t see the rooster and the hen mating, nor eat<br/>
the pig slaughtered in the yard--but life hasn&#39;t changed much.  Sheltering<br/>
children from work or exploitation in factories is different from hiding<br/>
life from them.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this was the reason I got into so many arguments with other parents<br/>
about how I respected my children&#39;s personal boundaries and sovereignty.<br/>
 Protecting children with vague streetproofing drills is silly--though<br/>
possibly better than nothing.  Scaring them is horrible.  Protecting them<br/>
from the Family Guy, which spoofs the elderly pedophile in a safe space<br/>
seems much better to introduce a topic.<br/>
<br/>
Life is out there in all its elements--laugh at it in a safe space, and ask<br/>
and answer questions.  But I don&#39;t think its wise to go out of our way to<br/>
shield children.  Its better to build relationships based on love and trust<br/>
and see the world as partners.<br/>
