&gt; I&#39;ve <br/>
&gt;been &quot;riding the bike&quot; or in other words, unschooling instead of <br/>
&gt;thinking about unschooling.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>A friend of mine used the phrase &quot;play the dusty piano&quot;.  It means <br/>
basically the same thing as what you&#39;re talking about.  Don&#39;t let the <br/>
dust and the have-tos keep you from doing what&#39;s really important. <br/>
 Don&#39;t skip playing the piano just because you haven&#39;t dusted it.<br/>
