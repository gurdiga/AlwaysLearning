<div id="ygrps-yiv-2100151623">Thank you for all of the wonderful ideas and wisdom. Lots of great ways to play with fire!<br/>
<br/>
In general, this all really helped me rethink how I was parenting. As she has gotten a little older, I started establishing rules without even realizing it. She&#39;s exploring more, but still much too young for long explanations, so I was taking the easy way out. It didn&#39;t seem like it, I just thought I was keeping her safe, but the responses helped me realize that it will be much better in the long run if I support her in her interests instead of thwarting them and relegating those activities to a time or place out of my presence.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
<br/>
love, sarah<br/>
