<div id="ygrps-yiv-533564322">You know it&#39;s interesting. I had the same reaction about Roseanne ...<br/>
realistic reactions to the situations. I never enjoyed some shows and<br/>
the Cosby Show is a prime example of parenting that had me cringing.<br/>
The kids were grown on All in the Family but even that show was<br/>
realistic in terms of how people express their feelings in their<br/>
environment .... in other words, people (children) can only express<br/>
feelings as openly as the environment allows it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d also love to hear other shows commented on for the parenting<br/>
style. What are some of the best or worst, in your opinion. Coming at<br/>
this from a viewpoint of unschooling is a study of the general<br/>
population of parenting styles, for sure... well, for me it is.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; LOL --  what she did was TALK with her kids - sometimes only after<br/>
&gt; blowing up and being super strict/mean, but eventually always was<br/>
&gt; clearly trying to see from her kids&#39; point of view. Also, the show<br/>
&gt; showed realistic kids&#39; reactions when their parents were cracking down<br/>
&gt; on them. They didn&#39;t show the kids being shamed and punished and then<br/>
&gt; meekly coming out and saying something like, &quot;Okay, you were right and<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m going to be good from now on.&quot; No - they showed how the initial<br/>
&gt; problem usually was blown up into a much bigger issue by the parents,<br/>
&gt; when they didn&#39;t take time to work it through with the kid, but just<br/>
&gt; imposed their authority. This was in contrast to the Cosby Show, which<br/>
&gt; was completely unrealistic in how the kids reacted to constantly being<br/>
&gt; made fun of and restricted and punished. Cosby Show was really an<br/>
&gt; updated &quot;Father Knows Best&quot; - and not as sweet.<br/>

It was all so cringe-worthy I couldn&#39;t get through the whole episode. Had they really never talked to this boy about masturbation before? Is breaking into your daughter&#39;s bedroom and hacking into her computer really the best response to finding out she&#39;s dating someone? I turned it off when the single mom, who&#39;d been insisting her troubled daughter was trustworthy enough to babysit, snuck around to spy on her daughter through the window. I couldn&#39;t take it anymore. I wonder what I missed--the part where she slips on something and makes a noise and her daughter discovers her spying and they have a big fight?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve tried two episodes and couldn&#39;t get all the way through either, though the first time it wasn&#39;t about parenting, but about an interaction between two adults that depended on someone acting stupid because otherwise there&#39;d be no story. I have very little patience for that kind of thing.<br/>

Never forget the Chicken Heart, though.   When you&#39;re disturbed,  <br/>
cringing, unhappy or setting the couch on fire and smearing Jello  <br/>
everywhere, remember this:  Turn off the radio.  (or TV)<br/>

These are 40-some years old.  It will take 12 minutes to listen to  <br/>
both.  There&#39;s no video.  I have the album on vinyl.<br/>
Cosby was born in 1937, so he was a kid in the 40&#39;s, pre-TV, pre- <br/>
inflation (comment on the price of the couch), and pre-political  <br/>
correctness.<br/>

Chamille and I sat down to watch the very first episode when it came out because it was this same person.  We got about 5 min into it and she said, &quot;this is way too much about school, it&#39;s going to annoy me, it already is and it just started.&quot;  So we changed the channel!<br/>

in jr. high. We got to go see him do a live show 2 summers ago, at our <br/>
county fair. He was great - there were times we thought he was wandering <br/>
too far off topic and losing his train of thought, but he always wrapped <br/>
it all back up in the end. He brought some little kids up on the stage <br/>
and did a &quot;Kids say the darndest things&quot; bit. He asked one little girl, <br/>
&quot;What is your favorite subject in school.&quot; She said, &quot;Math.&quot; He <br/>
INSTANTLY and loudly commanded, &quot;GO BACK TO YOUR SEAT.&quot; Then muttered <br/>
stuff about not wanting kids like her around. The audience thought it <br/>
was hysterically funny, but I thought the little girl was probably <br/>
scared and embarrassed and hurt.<br/>
<br/>
When Rosie went through her Roseanne and Cosby Show stage, we watched <br/>
both of those shows several times every day - for a year or more. She <br/>
concluded that, of the two sets of parents, she preferred the Conners <br/>
(because they admitted when they were wrong and because they seemed to <br/>
care a lot more about how their kids felt). But that doesn&#39;t mean she <br/>
didn&#39;t love both shows.<br/>

different families - much of it, most of it, is about parents and <br/>
children (a bit is about adult-adult relationships).  If we only watched <br/>
shows about people who behave well, it wouldn&#39;t be that interesting, <br/>
would it? I mean - do you not watch Romeo and Juliet because they act <br/>
stupid? Talk about cringe-worthy! (Not that Parenthood is very high <br/>
quality - it isn&#39;t.<br/>
They don&#39;t pay attention to the details of the reality of children&#39;s <br/>
lives at all. This week&#39;s soccer scenes were ridiculously inaccurate. <br/>
Their team played the same team,, twice in a row - same coach, different <br/>
uniforms. The parents all stood at the sidelines, nobody was sitting. <br/>
The coaches were blowing whistles - huh? That&#39;s the ref&#39;s job. And on <br/>
and on....no credibility when it comes to accuracy in that sense.)<br/>
<br/>
But the writing is all about how parents and children might relate - and <br/>
I really do find that interesting to watch and think about and talk <br/>
about with my daughter. I don&#39;t judge a show based on whether or not I <br/>
like the way the parents parent, but on whether it is thought-provoking <br/>

It disturbs me when bad examples are broadcast to the world and some  <br/>
people will take them as good examples.  Whether it makes sense or  <br/>
not, i don&#39;t want to be there.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was little she knew that kids&#39; shows were fishing for kids  <br/>
to respond, at least mentally, about the answer to a little problem or  <br/>
situation--for kids to figure it out.   She told me that situation  <br/>
comedies about families were like that for parents, for the parents to  <br/>
think of what they would do, and to feel better if they could think of  <br/>
something better.   So Pam and Holly seem less disturbed by the whole  <br/>
thing than I am.<br/>
<br/>
My boys weren&#39;t as interested in talking about family dynamics as  <br/>
Holly was, and we found lots of examples in real life or movies.<br/>
<br/>
Another factor:  Twice we&#39;ve been &quot;a Nielsen family.&quot;  I got used to  <br/>
the idea that what we watched counted for 1200 families or whatever it  <br/>
might&#39;ve been from time to time, and it made me more aware of what I  <br/>
was watching, and lending that &quot;vote&quot; to.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For me, I&#39;m gonna say it fails on all three counts :-)<br/>
<br/>
Really, though, I think shows with crappy parenting fall into the category, for me, of stuff I just don&#39;t need to see more of. I don&#39;t watch shows or movies with kids being kidnapped, or with graphic rape scenes, or with people being publicly humiliated, or where the humor is mostly based on people who supposedly love each other making nasty jokes at each other&#39;s expense. I just don&#39;t enjoy any of those things. I actually have very little time to watch TV--maybe an hour a day, often less. I&#39;m actually that rare person who wishes she had time to watch _more_ TV than I do. So I cut shows out of the rotation pretty ruthlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Now, if I had older kids (my oldest is just about to turn 9), and they were really into any of those shows... Well, I&#39;ve watched Dragonball Z and more hours of Dora the Explorer than I can count (I find Dora the Explorer--the show, not the little animated person--very annoying), so I&#39;d probably dive in with these shows too. My kids and I already talk about how my oldest son and I really don&#39;t like, say, the graphic cadavers in NCIS, but Carl, who just turned six, is fascinated by them (he likes anatomy books, too). If the show is on, Carl tells me and Eric when we can stop covering our eyes. So I think if there was someone in the house who was finding Parenthood entertaining or interesting, or even annoying in a thought-provoking instead of (to me) &quot;Oh, more of this tired old crap&quot; way,  we&#39;d be watching it and talking about it, too.<br/>

are any parents and kids in the show at all. But most of them are not <br/>
&quot;about&quot; parenting - which is why I think we&#39;re enjoying Parenthood. It <br/>
isn&#39;t a very good show, but we&#39;re having a pretty good time cringing <br/>
together and talking about it.<br/>

<br/>
She watched Arthur, episode after school-promoting episode, when she was <br/>
little, and, back then, she was always most interested in, guess what,  <br/>
how the parents and kids treated each other. I remember her talking <br/>
about how the parents sometimes set the kids up to &quot;be bad&quot; by not <br/>
thinking ahead. The episode where DW plays with grandma&#39;s doll was one <br/>
of those, for anybody who knows the show.<br/>

<br/>
A year or two before Connor and Macalla were teenagers we&#39;d watched those<br/>
Nanny shows, where the lady dressed a bit like a modern day governess would<br/>
come in and tell the parents how to get the <br/>
children &#39;to behave&#39;.  At certain points in the show I would have a hard<br/>
time watching.  I loved the conversations that came from watching that show<br/>
though.  Even dh, Mark, if he was home would <br/>
watch with us.<br/>
 <br/>
Recently I happened to catch a little bit of this show here in the UK called<br/>
outnumbered.  This bit had so many funny lol moments (atm I don&#39;t know which<br/>
one that was).  Since then I&#39;ve watched a <br/>
couple of the shows.  I think this show could possibly be the best parenting<br/>
show out there at the moment.  It&#39;s so obvious these traditional parents are<br/>
trying so very hard at being the best parents <br/>
they can with the information they have.  The dad seems to be especially<br/>
bumbling and out of his depth that even though his parenting can make ya<br/>
cringe and maybe go &#39;oh no! &#39; I think one can&#39;t <br/>
help but feel for him and want to give him a big ol&#39; hug sometimes.  It&#39;s<br/>
made very obvious to the viewer how smart the *children* are and not the<br/>
parents!  At least to me, more traditional parents <br/>
possibly would see it differently I suppose.  At times I do find the<br/>
parenting style a little hard to watch and take a break but so far I keep<br/>
coming back!  <br/>
 <br/>
I looked on wiki and there&#39;s been an American pilot made of the show.  In in<br/>
the UK version there is plenty of improvisation from the children.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
know that before and so like the show that little <br/>
more now. <br/>
 <br/>
Here&#39;s the first part and episode of the show.  There&#39;s not a ton lol<br/>
moments with this one but imo the bit starting at 2:39 totally is.  <br/>

their understanding of &quot;how the world works&quot;. By the time someone  <br/>
becomes a parent, they&#39;ve absorbed thousands and thousands of examples  <br/>
of parents and children as adversaries from real life and stories.  <br/>
Undoubtedly how their parents handled situations makes the largest  <br/>
impression, but hundreds and hundreds of TV examples of the parent as  <br/>
wanter of what&#39;s right and sensible and the child as wanter of what&#39;s  <br/>
unreasonable with the goal of getting the child to accept they&#39;re  <br/>
wrong and the parent is right aren&#39;t insignificant.<br/>
<br/>
When they&#39;re faced with a real life conflict, they&#39;re drawing  <br/>
conclusions from how things should or need to work based on all that  <br/>
&quot;data&quot; they&#39;ve been unwittingly collecting.<br/>
<br/>
Probably how much thought someone gives to what they see depends on  <br/>
their interests and type of intelligence. I know my radar gets alerted  <br/>
to irritating parenting on TV more than when I was a kid.<br/>

<br/>
I remember watching  A Christmas Story &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085334/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0085334/</a>&gt;<br/>
when I was in college and thinking it was really funny. This past winter one<br/>
of Molly&#39;s friends was in a local theatrical production of it.<br/>
<br/>
I borrowed the movie so we could watch it before going to see the play. I<br/>
was horrified at how immature, manipulative and mean the parents were! It<br/>
was just awful.<br/>
<br/>
When I first watched it in the 1980&#39;s I was probably viewing if from the<br/>
child&#39;s point of view, and the way the adults behaved seemed perfectly<br/>
normal. Now I&#39;m viewing it from a sensitized parent&#39;s point of view &lt;g&gt; and<br/>
it was hard for me to sit through.<br/>

difference between watching parents parent badly in stories and being  <br/>
entertained by someone trying to accomplish something with inadequate  <br/>
skills is whether they know they&#39;re failing or not. What I find  <br/>
irritating is when what I see as bad parenting is assumed by the  <br/>
writers to be accepted as good and necessary parenting.<br/>

I have a hard time watching shows where the people just act stupid, though. That seems to be the trend with many network TV shows these days. The situations are meant to be funny based on reality but they are so ridiculous and the people so stupid that it&#39;s not a study of humor behavior anymore but just a bunch of the most outrageous situations and behaviors that the writers or directors could come up with. I&#39;m with Su on that. I just can&#39;t sit through it. It&#39;s too annoying.<br/>

There is a Brit show that had parenting I really liked.  It was based  <br/>
on a novel, I guess (or a series?) and it was Fortysomething.  It was  <br/>
more like a mini-series.  The parents were played by Hugh Laurie and  <br/>
Anna Chancellor.   She usually gets stuck playing snooty but not  <br/>
here.  And he plays a doctor but not at all like Dr. House. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
American fans of House might like to see him in his own accent and  <br/>
gait, rather than pretending to be a limping crotchety American.<br/>

<br/>
They have three teen/young-adult sons who live with them, and they  <br/>
relationships are more real than most fiction shows.   Maybe parenting  <br/>
is nicer in the U.K. in general, and that&#39;s a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
I watched Precious yesterday for the first time.  I had been afraid to  <br/>
watch it, but although it&#39;s not a picnic, it&#39;s not unrelenting, and  <br/>
there are bright parts.  (Oooh!  &quot;unrelenting&quot; and &quot;relentless&quot; are  <br/>
used in there, and that&#39;s probably where i got that.)  That is an  <br/>
especially dark example of some very, very bad parenting.   I&#39;m not  <br/>
recommending it, just saying compared to that, Fortysomething is a  <br/>
glorious picnic with fireworks and warm blankets.<br/>

those adults were pretty mean.   Of course reading them as an adult I  <br/>
see that they were created to be monstrously cruel or stingy or  <br/>

<br/>
What I like about that show though, is that he KNOWS he stinks at it.  He tries all the traditional parenting stuff and it rarely to never works for him, often backfiring.  What is nice about that particular show is that they show the kids view and why they did what they did, sometimes in a direct reaction to the bad parenting, or they show why they did what they did to get in trouble in the first place.  As the audience you get to have empathy for the kids and see exactly how Bernie Mac messes up.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I kind of like the Middle.. atleast a few of the episodes I have watched.  One evening my 8 year old and I were watching it and it was an episode when the mom was trying not to yell at the kids.  It brought up  a couple discussion about yelling, patience, what helps and what doesnt etc...  I go through periods of time when being patient gets very difficult for me.  I really struggle sometimes cause I know what I need to do, but then I yell.  Today, the kids have been bickering alot, my husband left for a two week trip this morning, and we are all feeling it.  And then I topped it all off with by yelling at them to stop fighting!!!!   I think sometimes shows like that can be fun because we can laugh at ourselves, see how silly we most probably look when we are less than perfect ourselves.</div>
