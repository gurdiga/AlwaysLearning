<br/>
It might be easier, but it might be better to begin early to be aware  <br/>
that what one writes and does is subject to the scrutiny and opinion  <br/>
of others, and practice even as a teen to be courteous and fair and  <br/>
honest in the way information is presented.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Your friend was fired from her job for being rude in public, not  <br/>
because the co-worker saw it.<br/>
<br/>
Consideration for others is important in all kinds of situations, web  <br/>
or no web.  Helping children find ways to be sneaky will just  <br/>
encourage them to be sneaky adults.<br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was one of Rohana&#39;s (now 18 yrs old) original friends.  I have friends who<br/>
haven&#39;t seen their children&#39;s MySpace or Facebook pages.  They are surprised<br/>
that I am my child&#39;s friend.   Rohana helped me create my own MySpace at<br/>
first (and her dad&#39;s too).  She&#39;ll tell me that she&#39;s updated her blog and<br/>
that I should read it...and this is my &quot;stepdaughter&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Then again, this is a young woman who has always had a burning desire to<br/>
cook, and is now off at a culinary arts program (much to her bio-mother&#39;s<br/>
dismay - she wanted Rohana to get a &quot;real&quot; education at a 4 yr college).  I<br/>
guess to Rohana having her parents (me and her dad) as her online friends is<br/>
pretty cool.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing that these kids who don&#39;t want their parents on MySpace don&#39;t<br/>
want their parents in their REAL lives.  <br/>

<br/>
That surprised me with its power when I read it.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s true, and I think it&#39;s right, but isn&#39;t it a huge  <br/>
difference?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I wake up at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and can&#39;t go back  <br/>
to sleep, so I get up.  Sometimes Holly&#39;s still up.  The other night  <br/>
I said I just couldn&#39;t sleep and was kinda nervous (I had to go to  <br/>
the dentist).  She asked if I wanted to lie down in her bed.  That  <br/>
was so sweet.  And sometimes if one of us is sick, even though she&#39;s  <br/>
sixteen, she&#39;ll ask me to lie down with her.  I rarely make it all  <br/>
night there, but she&#39;d be fine with it if I did.<br/>
<br/>
She has the queen sized bed her dad and I used to have.<br/>

 <br/>
I&#39;ve been having trouble sleeping lately.   Most likely, a  combination of <br/>
owning a rooster and getting older...Menopause symptoms really  are wrecking <br/>
havoc on me...&lt;g&gt;   Anyway, Logan is usually up and  on his computer.  He&#39;s <br/>
recently began playing World of Warcraft and loves  to watch all the late night <br/>
talk shows.<br/>
 <br/>
I show up in his room at wee hours and he&#39;s always so happy to offer  his bed <br/>
as he&#39;s in a gaming chair.<br/>
He updates me on WOW and usually says things like, &quot;You can just sleep in  <br/>
here, Mom, and I&#39;ll take the top bunk. It&#39;s comforting to snuggle under his  <br/>
covers as he plays his game and he seems to enjoy me being there.  I  usually <br/>
stay for awhile until I think I can sleep again and then head back to my  room.<br/>
 <br/>
He helped me create a MySpace account a long time ago but I haven&#39;t used  it. <br/>
 Brenna uses both Facebook and Myspace and we were discussing the  article <br/>
about adults being on social networking sites.  She said that she  loves it when <br/>
an adult she knows asks to be on her &quot;friends&quot; list. <br/>
 <br/>
Both kids have real life friends of all ages and I don&#39;t see them  <br/>
differentiating  between them because of age.  Another unschooling  family was staying <br/>
with us recently and I was noticing how all our children talk  to the other <br/>
parents so engagingly and enjoy the company of not only the other  kids but the <br/>
adults as well. <br/>
It&#39;s one of many things I enjoy when we go to unschooling  conferences.  <br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s so different than most of the kids we know from traditionally  parented <br/>
and schooled families.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-272053180">Well - it is really all about kids being unhappy that it might impede  <br/>
them from discussing their secret lives that they don&#39;t want their  <br/>
parents to know about. Some people mix up the ideas of &quot;autonomy&quot; with  <br/>
&quot;secret.&quot; Teens and young adults do need autonomy - but that doesn&#39;t  <br/>
translate into  &quot;kids need to have secret lives.&quot; Still, it is the  <br/>
parents who make it feel to the kids like they need secret lives.<br/>
<br/>
I get it - and don&#39;t entirely blame those kids. They don&#39;t want their  <br/>
parents or parents&#39; friends accidentally finding out things about them  <br/>
- they&#39;re worried about getting into trouble. And, the parents are  <br/>
often on there to spy, anyway, not for the social networking purposes.  <br/>
I&#39;d resent that, too.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have lots of adult MySpace friends (including me) and that is  <br/>
great for them, they consider their adult friends as much their real  <br/>
friends as anybody else. And, they&#39;re not hiding anything for two  <br/>
reasons: 1) they have nothing they feel like they need to hide and 2)  <br/>
if they did have something that other kids would hide, they wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
need to hide it because they aren&#39;t afraid of being punished.<br/>

I understand the concerns of those kids, but it&#39;s perpetuation of  <br/>
&quot;us&quot; and &quot;them.&quot;  Interesting the &quot;expert&quot; (a market researching  <br/>
expert) said &quot;forty&quot; as a cut-off age.  There are plenty of teenagers  <br/>
whose parents are not yet forty (some not yet thirty), as a result in  <br/>
many cases of THOSE once-teenagers having kept secrets from their  <br/>
parents too.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s evidence of the larger problems of society, and evidence of  <br/>
better than average conditions among unschooling families.<br/>
<br/>
The point about employers seeing things is true.  If people want real  <br/>
privacy, they can use the phone or e-mail or IM.  Putting something  <br/>
on a webpage, even if it&#39;s friends only, still opens it WIDE up to  <br/>
friends of friends, and anyone with screen capture, printer or  <br/>
webpage save.<br/>

   <br/>
  I had to laugh at this. My dh (a public high school teacher) has had a myspace page since it&#39;s beginning and has tons of students and former students as his friends (as well as his own kids). My dh is always the teacher the kids go to when they have a problem. They know they will get non-judgemental and respectful advice (and help when needed) from him. Of the homeschoolers I know that have myspace accounts, all of them have their kids, and their kid&#39;s friends in their networks. They also all have their accounts private (the kids that is). <br/>
  I think the media latches onto, and encourages, the image of sullen teens who don&#39;t want anything to do with their parents (there are many movies and tv shows that play to that image). I know there are a lot of teens out there that don&#39;t want to interact with their parents, because they can&#39;t have an honest relationship with them. I believe our culture encourages the great divide between kids and their parents mainly by encouraging an authoritarian parenting/family style which pervades every segment of society. By this I mean, the schools, the workplace and social situations.<br/>
  I think a lot of homeschoolers, especially unschoolers, have a culture unto themselves. It&#39;s a culture of mutual respect, communication, understanding, and cooperation. Sadly, I believe there are many, many kids out there who never get a chance to experience this culture in their lives and they will go on perpetuating the division between the ages.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would definitely agree with that!  One part of the article comes to <br/>
mind, the one about the college student afraid others might see <br/>
drunken college pictures.  I guess either you shouldn&#39;t be <br/>
irresponsible with alcohol, or you shouldn&#39;t post up drunken pictures <br/>
of yourself, or allow others to do so.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s self incriminating stupidity!  I&#39;ve posted rants on my blog <br/>
and later removed them because, I realized that something could <br/>
easily backfire in such a large public forum!  It&#39;s common sense to <br/>
monitor yourself when you put something out in public.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I am an adult who has almost all teens as myspace <br/>
friends.  For a lot of those teens, I&#39;m the only adult friend they <br/>
have on myspace, but they requested me as a friend not the other way <br/>
around!  I&#39;m Chamille&#39;s mom, so therefore, I&#39;m &quot;cool&quot;.  They really <br/>
like it when I take the time to comment on their stuff.  Every time <br/>
Chamille updates her myspace, she insists I check it out.  She wants <br/>
me to see all the great stuff she&#39;s done and goes into great detail <br/>
about how she learned how to make it &quot;do&quot; that by changing this or <br/>
that html code.  <br/>
<br/>
Her best friend isn&#39;t even allowed to have a myspace and can only <br/>
communicate via the internet through a parent chosen site that I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t let my own daughter sign up for because it required too much <br/>
private information on my end.  Apparently, it&#39;s some sort of highly <br/>
parent regulated little kid site, pretty useless for what teens like <br/>
to do.</div>
