<div id="ygrps-yiv-912806077">I just wanted to apologize for all my ramblings this morning. I hope I didn&#39;t cause any confusion to newbies like myself...already confused enough...lol. I read the suggested readings [the best of other unschoolers & about the list.] It was all very helpful. Now, I&#39;m off to read some more :) And maybe ask a question or 2.</div>
