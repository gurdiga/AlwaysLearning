If a child loses privileges, that&#39;s punishment.<br/>

If you live in Albuquerque, there aren&#39;t fines.  Where there are  <br/>
fines, they&#39;re punitive measures intended train people to bring books  <br/>
back on schedule.  The library isn&#39;t a commune, though.  It probably  <br/>

the borrowers.<br/>

family.  I owe them safety and comfort, and by virtue of our  <br/>
unschooling choice, I owe them scads of opportunities and exposure to  <br/>
cool stuff and people and places.  I have way more duty to fulfill  <br/>
than they do.  It&#39;s not &quot;There are five of us so each does 20% of the  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1126807167">Two quick points jump out at me in your post, Sandra.<br/>
First, you may have had a slight misreading of my use<br/>
of the word &#39;communal&#39;. I meant it in it&#39;s more basic<br/>
sense--a gathering of two or more people who by virtue<br/>
of choice (or birth, or force, or what have you) live<br/>
together in a family, town, country, world, etc. In<br/>
such a situation there are principles which govern the<br/>
behavior of participants. Whether on chooses to live<br/>
by those principles is, of course, up to the<br/>
individual. My point was that there are consequences<br/>
to not doing so. <br/>
<br/>
I also can&#39;t help but notice your use of the word<br/>
&#39;exposure&#39;, recalling that my use of the word and<br/>
concept was what sort of tripped this wire in the<br/>
first place. I wonder why?<br/>
<br/>

-i notice there&#39;s another kim who&#39;s active; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
want her to get blamed for my rabbler ousing ;-)<br/>
