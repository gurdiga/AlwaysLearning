<div id="ygrps-yiv-1686180078">Hi, <br/>
   <br/>
  I have been homeschooling my kids for over four years and now want to try unschooling.  My first year I used all ABEKA. The second and third year I used a unit study.  Then, came a baby with health problems and a lot less time to focus and keep up with the unit study.  Now the only structured curriculum I have for my 5th grader is ABEKA math, for my 8th grade daughter an 8th grade math book that she has finished and now she has asked me for a new one and some spelling book she found around the house and does on her own.  She reads A LOT and they both take dance, piano and soccer outside of the home.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I have been a &quot;stressed out&quot; mom who needs to get back on track with my kids.  My son seems angry and hyper a lot of the time.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I have been reading your messages and started trying unschooling on my own, but I am unsure if what I am doing is okay.  My son just plays on the computer all day and night long.  My daughter seems to balance everything out on her own.<br/>
   <br/>
  Could someone give me some advice on where to start with the unschooling approach.  Or is it too late because of the ages of my two older kids and the damage that has been done?<br/>
   <br/>
  Thanks,<br/>
  Michelle<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643046565">There&#39;s a special exhibit of Andrew Wyeth&#39;s paintings at a nearby  <br/>
museum. Here&#39;s a bit from a newspaper article, quoting the curator:<br/>
<br/>
**Born in 1917, Andrew Wyeth was too high-strung and his health too  <br/>
precarious to sit in a classroom, so he was home-schooled. &quot;His  <br/>
imagination and restlessness were cultivated--today they might be  <br/>
medicated,&quot; says Ms. Foster.**<br/>
<br/>
This connects, for me, with my son. Right now, he&#39;s the youngest (age  <br/>
14) in the cast of a production of &quot;Cats&quot; that is getting rave  <br/>
reviews and selling-out every performance. He&#39;s playing Mungojerrie,  <br/>
a role that requires tremendous energy, stamina and confidence.<br/>
<br/>
Also in the cast are some guys in their 20s who were remembering  <br/>
working with Ben when he was 8 in a musical version of the first  <br/>
Redwall book. He drove them NUTS! They&#39;ve been telling stories about  <br/>
how he&#39;d just be so excited and loud and annoying all the time. I  <br/>
remember how they complained about him and how the director would say  <br/>
&quot;he&#39;s doing exactly what I want him to do.&quot; Thank goodness for that  <br/>
director. He&#39;s also now in &quot;Cats,&quot; playing old Gus.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a father of two energetic boys. He and I have tried to explain  <br/>
to these 20-something guys that &quot;quiet&quot; doesn&#39;t automatically equal  <br/>
&quot;good&quot; and that squashing a kid&#39;s energy and enthusiasm isn&#39;t the  <br/>
only way to &quot;deal&quot; with him. They&#39;re not buying it!<br/>
<br/>
One said that he&#39;d never have predicted that the &quot;wild maniac&quot; Ben  <br/>
would grow up to be the reliable, hard-working young man that he is now.<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;This is what a super-energetic kid looks like when he isn&#39;t  <br/>
told for years and years that he&#39;s *bad*. Just like I didn&#39;t allow  <br/>
you guys to call him *bad* back then, I haven&#39;t allowed anyone to  <br/>
call him that for his whole life. And now he&#39;s got all this energy  <br/>
and power that he&#39;s been learning about and growing into control of.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just imagine the world without the art of Andrew Wyeth--if his energy  <br/>
had been squashed and he&#39;d been drugged into being &quot;good.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693028968">***I love Andrew Wyeth, he is, without a doubt, my favorite artist. (if you <br/>
don&#39;t mind me asking, what state are you in? I would love to see that very <br/>
special exhibit!) I&#39;ve have quite a few books about his art and life and I don&#39;t <br/>
want to imagine the world without the art of Andrew Wyeth. &lt;g&gt;  I also LOVE <br/>
your post!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt; that &quot;quiet&quot; doesn&#39;t automatically equal &quot;good&quot; and that squashing a kid&#39;s <br/>
 </span></blockquote>energy and enthusiasm isn&#39;t the only way to &quot;deal&quot; with him. They&#39;re not <br/>
buying it!&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
**There are so many people in the world who don&#39;t buy that, how sad. When my <br/>
dd, now 12, (who never really got in trouble at school but has always been <br/>
full of life and questions) was in school she once told me that &quot;She wished she <br/>
was a shy kid.&quot; I said &quot;HUH?!! What the heck would make you say that!?&quot; She <br/>
replied with &quot;Because it seems like most of the time, teachers just like the shy <br/>
kids the best.&quot; I got sick to my stomach, that comment from her was one of the <br/>
many BIG &quot;kicks in the butt&quot; I got towards hs&#39;ing/unschooling. I told her &quot;No <br/>
Katie, it&#39;s not that they &quot;like them better&quot;, they are just easier to deal <br/>
with in the class room, it makes for an easier work day, nothing more. &quot;Liking <br/>
them better&quot; has nothing to do with it. What teacher wouldn&#39;t love to have a <br/>
room full of quiet little kids who just sit there like little robots, never <br/>
asking why, doing what they&#39;re told, being just too shy to rock the boat?!&quot; I feel <br/>
so sorry for kids in schools that are treated like that. I cringe when I <br/>
think of all the wasted talent out there being squashed by the ps system and <br/>
unfortunately, some of their parents.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1450104682">Sorry for this &quot;me too&quot; post but when I was in first grade, I remember<br/>
being punished for socializing and talking.  Once I was made to stand<br/>
in front of class, holding one foot up behind me.  *If* I had been<br/>
shy, it would have been punishment.  I thought it was a hoot.  But<br/>
very soon my funloving nature was made to be tamer in school.  By the<br/>
time I hit 3rd grade (sounds familiar) I was all washed up socially. <br/>
I agree.. it&#39;s bs, but apparently necessary to run a school.<br/>

Any statement about what all teachers like (or would love) is bound  <br/>
to be false.  Sorry.<br/>
Teachers are individuals just as the kids are.  Some like quiet and  <br/>
some like noise and some like odd curiosities and some like the  <br/>
&quot;correct answers&quot; (according to the teacher&#39;s manual, right or wrong).<br/>

It&#39;s SO COOL to know (and have) kids who are &quot;allowed&quot; to be  <br/>
themselves all along instead of waiting until they&#39;re &quot;grown&quot; to  <br/>
attempt it with stunted selves.<br/>

The talk I&#39;m planning for the September Live and Learn conference  <br/>
(unless I change my mind again &lt;g&gt;) is &quot;Big Noisy Peace.&quot;<br/>

***WELL, I wish my kids had YOU as one of their teachers when they were in <br/>
school then! :o) Out of the 6 or so long years our 2 dd&#39;s were in the ps system <br/>
there is only ONE teacher like you that comes to my mind, my dh&#39;s and my girls <br/>
minds......it was my 11 yo&#39;s kindergarten teacher. WONDERFUL woman! We loved <br/>
her!  I understand what you are saying, didn&#39;t mean to generalize...... with 2 <br/>
kids and 6 years, I felt that was a whole lotta teachers to only have ONE out <br/>
of the whole bunch that didn&#39;t mind (and even encouraged) the <br/>
&quot;question-acting, quirky kids&quot; and who (I felt) at the same time treated those kids with <br/>
respect in doing so. I felt sorry for most of the kids I saw in school. There were <br/>
SO many who got shot down on a regular basis.**** <br/>

<br/>
**** Hearing about unschooling (and things like that statement above) was <br/>
like a big fat *flood light* popped on in my head &lt;g&gt; and I found myself doing <br/>
the &quot;coulda shoulda woulda&quot;s&quot; a lot in the beginning.....Life gets better every <br/>
day, now we&#39;re just happier and moved forward. :o)<br/>
<br/>
Sure wish we could make it to the September Live and Learn conference!  Just <br/>
not something we can do this time around. *****<br/>
