<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787636327">Seth is going to NBTSC this year (in Oregon) and we are discovering that for<br/>
a minor under 15 to travel alone (unaccompanied minor) the airlines require<br/>
an additional fee of $100 both ways and will escort the kids from gate to<br/>
gate and basically babysit them.  All that would be great if Seth weren&#39;t a<br/>
pretty independent and competent kid who will be 14 at the time of travel<br/>
and would find having a babysitter appalling.  My first inclination is to<br/>
just say he is 15 and hope for the best but I worry that they will ask for<br/>
birth certificate for proof.  I am wondering if anyone here has experience<br/>
with this or knows someone who does?  <br/>

&quot;Children who are 12 years of age or older travel under the same<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-861812283">Jessica, 15, has flown unaccompanied on Southwest since age 13. She <br/>
flies several times a year and always on Southwest (at first because of <br/>
the lower age requirement, now because of frequent flier miles!). She&#39;s <br/>
had good experiences.<br/>

Different airlines have different policies.  Holly used accompanied  <br/>
minor when she went to England, and I was very glad of it.  Try  <br/>
another airline if you can.<br/>
<br/>
Go by the age he&#39;ll be when he flies.  Maybe go through a travel  <br/>
agent who might know of a form to fill in to waive the unaccompanied  <br/>
minor.  I bet there is one.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No it doesn&#39;t, but Eugene is very near Ptld, OR, and I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
surprised at all if there were some other kids going to Eugene from<br/>
Ptld.  Perhaps you should ask here...<br/>
