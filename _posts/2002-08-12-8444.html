&gt;Oh If ONLY!  I hate that scouts is seperated into<br/>
&gt;different sex groups.  I wish there was an all family<br/>
&gt;inclusive, non-authoritarian, non-military,<br/>
&gt;non-religious (or multifaith embracing) group like<br/>
&gt;that.  The legal implications alone of trying to<br/>
&gt;create a scouting alternative is so daunting, not to<br/>
&gt;mention the financial aspects.  <br/>

Been around since 1910...first group to go co-ed, in the &#39;70s.  Totally <br/>
diverse.  Just came out with a new program called Community Family <br/>
Clubs, (but our club has always included all ages and up to adults).  <br/>
