What happened to the 15,000 words?<br/>
I know that this is not true for Lexie and others on this list, but what <br/>
about other kids?  Like the ones I teach?<br/>

<br/>
I have a 12 year old and I think it&#39;s mostly true for him as well. In<br/>
comparison, I had a much wider vocabulary at that age, but when I wasn&#39;t<br/>
reading, I was watching TV. IMO, both of those areas have been dumbed down<br/>
in the last 30 years. The kids and I were watching the 1940 Lassie Come Home<br/>
and Sean complained about the &quot;King James&quot; language. I pointed out that it<br/>
was dialect, but even then, there was more description used. It had a<br/>
broader vocabulary than they&#39;re used to in contemporary media. I&#39;m not a fan<br/>
of the &quot;classics&quot; in literature, but even what I read (biographies, animal<br/>
books, Nancy Drew) had a wider vocabulary than most of today&#39;s fiction. My<br/>
TV (westerns, Perry Mason, Star Trek) gave me wider exposure as well than<br/>
today&#39;s hit list (my kids are hooked on the entire Disney Channel lineup, so<br/>
perhaps there is decent programming out there beyond the Lizzie McGuire<br/>
genre that I haven&#39;t seen....) <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to generalize too broadly, but as much as I strew, my kids just<br/>
aren&#39;t exposing themselves to the range of material I did, and consequently<br/>
have smaller vocabularies. In some respects, it&#39;s a moot point, since I have<br/>
to tone down my own vocabulary 90% of the time anyway. I&#39;m not worried about<br/>
it, since vocabulary development is something that continues life-long. <br/>

Rod Serling&#39;s commentary on the Twilight Zone episodes sprang to mind.<br/>
Holly was really interested in those for a while, and I was surprised by the <br/>
level of the vocabulary.   <br/>
<br/>
I had written something about a certain episode, the one where William <br/>
Shatner plays a guy who sees a gremlin on the wing of a plane while they&#39;re in <br/>
flight.   I went to google and looked it up and found a teacher had written a whole <br/>
(irritating teacher) lesson on that (and some other ones).  I can&#39;t bring the <br/>
URL because it was a downloadable .doc, with an option for .html, but if you <br/>
go to google.com and put in <br/>
vocabulary twilight zone shatner<br/>
it might come up first again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll go back and look for the quote, instead of the vocabulary list.  I&#39;m <br/>
going to send this, though, because I came to a site that froze my computer last <br/>

The Twilight Zone original TV series was a great &#39;word&#39; program.  Rod Serling <br/>
was a master of the metaphor and a surgeon of the simile.  He would take <br/>
words and mold and shape them into short stories – vignettes that would bring home <br/>
a point with a crash.  Take a look a one of  Serling&#39;s figurative passages <br/>
here, from Time Enough At Last (November 20, 1959). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Witness Mr. Henry Bemis, a charter member in the fraternity of <br/>
Dreamers.  A bookish little man whose passion is the printed page but who is <br/>
conspired against by a bank president and a wife and a world full of <br/>
tongue-cluckers and the  unrelenting hands of a clock.  But in just a moment Mr. Bemis <br/>
will enter a world without bank presidents or wives or clocks or anything <br/>
else.  He&#39;ll have a world all to himself.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1475246105">Well this touched a current nerve with me!!  We&#39;re at the end of Lemony<br/>
Snickets first Unfortunate Series book and I was very surprised and<br/>
disgusted that any word that&#39;s longer than six letters is defined in the<br/>
book!!!  Hello!!!  What ever happened to picking up the meaning from the<br/>
text????  I will have to say I was already predisposed to not like the books<br/>
as I had heard and read that nothing good ever happened to the kids and I&#39;m<br/>
a sucker for happy endings. But I tried to go into them with a open mind as<br/>
my kids really wanted to listen to them (we&#39;re listening in the car) and I<br/>
had heard mixed reviews.  So that may be part of what irratates me about the<br/>
fact that he defines so many words, I feel that it interrupts the flow of<br/>
the story and that it&#39;s dumbing our kids down, let&#39;s assume that they can&#39;t<br/>
figure anything out for themselves and hand them it on a silver plate so<br/>
when they encounter that word again they won&#39;t remember what it means.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1017036554">AHA!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

breakdown. Mr. Wilson has that fear no longer... <br/>

FADE OUT<br/>

<br/>
When we watched that, Holly just looked at me with her head rared back, like <br/>
he had started speaking a foreign language.  And he really had, because that <br/>
stilted a level of language, especially in a medium like 50&#39;s TV where someone <br/>
couldn&#39;t rewind or look up a transcript, is not really communication.  At the <br/>
pace at which he presented it, it was just pretty much noise, honestly.  I <br/>
could only catch half of it the first time through, and even having it <br/>
&quot;rewindable&quot; (DVD), to explain it to a bright kid like Holly was not really possible.<br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m not recommending it as a vocabulary tool, just pointing out that yes, <br/>
he used loftier language, but as to whether it was useful information, I don&#39;t <br/>
think so.<br/>
<br/>
I remember reading in the late 1960&#39;s that the policy of Newsweek and Time <br/>
was to set their text at an 8th grade reading level.   Before anyone gets <br/>
excited, though, the whole concept of &quot;reading level&quot; is a construct of school <br/>
textbook analysis and production, born of remedial reading specialists getting mas<br/>
ters&#39; degrees in ultimately ruining people&#39;s lives and the school system as <br/>
well.  (Bad attitude on my part, but justifiable.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Reading level is a formula that has to do with the average and maximum length <br/>
of words (syllables, I think, but maybe letters--if anyone knows, tell us!) <br/>
and the average length of sentences.    That&#39;s why book with &quot;first grade <br/>
reading level&quot; have choppy little sentences, and as the level gets higher they get <br/>
longer.<br/>
<br/>
So if public writing like Newsweek aims for 8th grade (on the reading-level <br/>
word/sentence count) that leaves whatever was rated &quot;college level&quot; for <br/>
textbooks and William F. Buckley columns.  But honestly, I can read Buckley and I <br/>
don&#39;t WANT to.  It makes my skin crawl and my nervous system curl at the edges, <br/>
knowing he&#39;s purposely obfuscating, in prevention of ease of access to the <br/>
common seeker of editorial profusion, thereby rarifying that audience or <br/>
readership to whom he might thereafter feel any responsibility of clarity.<br/>
<br/>
He makes it difficult on purpose because he&#39;s a snob writing for snobs, and <br/>
doesn&#39;t WANT to speak to common people.<br/>
<br/>
So somewhere in the vocabulary recalbration from the 50&#39;s to now, perhaps a <br/>
class of language is being closed down.<br/>
<br/>
Language is living and changing, and it&#39;s possible that telling people to cut <br/>
the upper-class clap-trap isn&#39;t really a bad thing.  If people want to read <br/>
Robert Louis Stevenson novels as a hobby, that&#39;s fine.  I can read Chaucer, but <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t bring it out and inflict it as a read-aloud on my family unless I <br/>
were clueless and sadistic.  (Come to think of it, a socially clueless <br/>
acquaintance of mine DID just exactly that once, at a &quot;bardic&quot; event where people <br/>
were going around a circle and sharing some evocative-of-pre-1600 entertainment <br/>
like a song or a story, she chose to read a long (ten minute) passage in Middle <br/>
English, which might as well have been Tibetan, and that&#39;s really not a nice <br/>
thing to have done.<br/>
<br/>
So I defend the smaller vocabulary which is clearer and more accessible to <br/>
not only 20th generation English speakers, but to those whose parents were <br/>
Vietnamese, Mexican, or Turkish.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1307237324">Everyone is totally excused from reading this.  It&#39;s too much and depressing.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little hyper report on Robert Louis Stevenson I just wrote.  I&#39;ll do <br/>
him and his fans a favor in the next post and quote something simple and <br/>
positive.<br/>
<br/>
First, a quote from something by him about himself as a child.   Not a <br/>
character, but autobiographical:<br/>
<br/>
 “I would lie awake to weep for Jesus, but I would fear to trust myself to <br/>
slumber lest I was not accepted and should slip, ere I awoke, into eternal ruin.”<br/>
<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
I was looking for examples of really too-long Stevenson sentences ( I think I <br/>
counted one off once at 62 words, in Treasure Island, with the verb coming <br/>
WAY near the end so that it could only be understood by the reader going back up <br/>
and re-reading).  I found a couple of damning examples from letters.  He KNEW <br/>
his sentences became unintelligible.   Why was his editor afraid to say &quot;HEY, <br/>
DUDE!  PEOPLE CAN&#39;T READ THIS!&quot;?    The intimidation of class and education <br/>
shushed folks up just as in the Emperor&#39;s New Clothes.  To say &quot;I can&#39;t read <br/>
this&quot; was to admit ignorance, so they all pretended Stevenson&#39;s stuff was <br/>
perfection.  The stories are good.  The images are great!  The writing is like a <br/>
rough sea and I&#39;m not willing to ride it, personally (me with an English degree <br/>
and all that, I don&#39;t care:  the Emperor&#39;s Pirate Outfit is made of a tacky, <br/>
outdated, sea-sickening material).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an example from a letter:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;MY DEAR S. C., — Your delightful letter has just come, and finds me in a New <br/>
York hotel, waiting the arrival of a sculptor (St. Gaudens) who is making a <br/>
medallion of yours truly and who is (to boot) one of the handsomest and nicest <br/>
fellows I have seen. I caught a cold on the Banks; fog is not for me; nearly <br/>
died of interviewers and visitors, during twenty–four hours in New York; cut <br/>
for Newport with Lloyd and Valentine, a journey like fairy–land for the most <br/>
engaging beauties, one little rocky and pine–shaded cove after another, each with <br/>
a house and a boat at anchor, so that I left my heart in each and marvelled <br/>
why American authors had been so unjust to their country; caught another cold <br/>
on the train; arrived at Newport to go to bed and to grow worse, and to stay in <br/>
bed until I left again; the Fairchilds proving during this time kindness <br/>
itself; Mr. Fairchild simply one of the most engaging men in the world, and one of <br/>
the children, Blair, AET. ten, a great joy and amusement in his solemn <br/>
adoring attitude to the author of TREASURE ISLAND.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Here I was interrupted by the arrival of my sculptor. I have begged him to <br/>
make a medallion of himself and give me a copy. I will not take up the sentence <br/>
in which I was wandering so long, but begin fresh.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
&quot;The sentence in which [he] was wandering so long&quot; was the entire first <br/>
paragraph, which never came to its point.<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
From another letter:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;DEAR MR. BARRIE, - This is at least the third letter I have written you, but <br/>
my correspondence has a bad habit of not getting so far as the post. That <br/>
which I possess of manhood turns pale before the business of the address and <br/>
envelope. But I hope to be more fortunate with this: for, besides the usual and <br/>
often recurrent desire to thank you for your work-you are one of four that have <br/>
come to the front since I was watching and had a corner of my own to watch, <br/>
and there is no reason, unless it be in these mysterious tides that ebb and <br/>
flow, and make and mar and murder the works of poor scribblers, why you should not <br/>
do work of the best order. The tides have borne away my sentence, of which I <br/>
was weary at any rate, and between authors I may allow myself so much freedom <br/>
as to leave it pending. We are both Scots besides, and I suspect both rather <br/>
Scotty Scots; my own Scotchness tends to intermittency, but is at times <br/>
erisypelitous - if that be rightly spelt. Lastly, I have gathered we had both made <br/>
our stages in the metropolis of the winds: our Virgil&#39;s &#39;grey metropolis,&#39; and I <br/>
count that a lasting bond. No place so brands a man. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
-------<br/>
<br/>
From a letter to his mother!!!  (I don&#39;t want letters like this from my <br/>
children, ever----and his description of the locals proves his snobbishness, but he <br/>
WAS &quot;of a class&quot; that should not have required him to touch elbows on <br/>
sidewalks with stupid lazy people.)<br/>
<br/>
WICK, FRIDAY, SEPTEMBER 11, 1868.<br/>
<br/>
MY DEAR MOTHER, - <br/>
<br/>
. . . Wick lies at the end or elbow of an open triangular bay, hemmed on <br/>
either side by shores, either cliff or steep earth-bank, of no great height. The <br/>
grey houses of Pulteney extend along the southerly shore almost to the cape; <br/>
and it is about half-way down this shore - no, six-sevenths way down – that the <br/>
new breakwater extends athwart the bay.  Certainly Wick in itself possesses no <br/>
beauty:<br/>
<br/>
. . . .<br/>
<br/>
The streets are full of the Highland fishers, lubberly, stupid,<br/>
inconceivably lazy and heavy to move. You bruise against them,<br/>
tumble over them, elbow them against the wall - all to no purpose;<br/>
they will not budge; and you are forced to leave the pavement every<br/>
step<br/>

As a child I didn&#39;t get it really but listened and spooked very well.  Frankie 9 watched it with me one night, at the beginning when they say for the next 30 min they would take control of his mind LOL he said what did he say?/ and I explained to him the best i could and we both ended up huddled on the couch with daddy.... it was fun.  But I wouldn&#39;t want to do a lesson on it.. that would ruin it, and yukk that is not fun. Thanks for getting all that though, imagine thinking that much.  Do they have books of the twilight zone episodes?  I think I would like them for myself.  Stepheny<br/>

one of my grandmothers gave me when I was a child, I still have, and I read to <br/>
Holly from it sometimes:<br/>
<br/>
XXI<br/>
Escape at Bedtime <br/>
<br/>
The lights from the parlour and kitchen shone out <br/>
Through the blinds and the windows and bars; <br/>
And high overhead and all moving about, <br/>
There were thousands of millions of stars. <br/>
There ne&#39;er were such thousands of leaves on a tree, <br/>
Nor of people in church or the Park, <br/>
As the crowds of the stars that looked down upon me, <br/>
And that glittered and winked in the dark. <br/>
The Dog, and the Plough, and the Hunter, and all, <br/>
And the star of the sailor, and Mars, <br/>
These shown in the sky, and the pail by the wall <br/>
Would be half full of water and stars. <br/>
They saw me at last, and they chased me with cries, <br/>
And they soon had me packed into bed; <br/>
But the glory kept shining and bright in my eyes, <br/>
And the stars going round in my head. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the part I love so much: <br/>
 &quot;the pail by the wall <br/>
Would be half full of water and stars. &quot;<br/>

and the saddest to me of that collection:<br/>

I<br/>
Bed in Summer <br/>
<br/>
In winter I get up at night <br/>
And dress by yellow candle-light. <br/>
In summer quite the other way, <br/>
I have to go to bed by day. <br/>
I have to go to bed and see <br/>
The birds still hopping on the tree, <br/>
Or hear the grown-up people&#39;s feet <br/>
Still going past me in the street. <br/>
And does it not seem hard to you, <br/>
When all the sky is clear and blue, <br/>
And I should like so much to play, <br/>
To have to go to bed by day? <br/>
<br/>
---------------<br/>
<br/>
Maybe having that imbedded in my unconscious is  part of why I don&#39;t make my <br/>
kids go to bed early; never once have I done it.  Playing is more important <br/>
than bed, and sleeping by the clock is Victorian meanness.<br/>
<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of sleeping, though, I found this:<br/>
<br/>
Little known facts about R.L.S. : <br/>
<br/>
Scotsman invents sleeping bag! R.L.S. has a good claim to be the inventor of <br/>
the Sleeping Bag, taking a large fleece-lined sack with him to sleep in on the <br/>
journey through France described in his book Travels with a Donkey in the <br/>
Cevennes. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1590323004">I&#39;ve been reading your commentary on RL Stevenson with great amusement. <br/>
A few years ago I attempted to read Treasure Island to the kids, but had to quit <br/>
after page 3 because the writing style was so difficult to read. We ended up <br/>
getting a book on tape from the library, and LOVED it. I had never read it <br/>
before, so I was really thrilled to discover where exactly all of those common <br/>
pirate references originated: Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum, pieces of eight, <br/>
walk the plank, dead men tell no tales, etc. (Actually, it reminded me of going <br/>
through The Pirates of the Caribean ride at Disneyland.) Anyway, when I had <br/>
to get the book on tape I felt like a bit of a failure, so your comments on his <br/>
purposefully bad writing was insightful. I just figured that his writing style was <br/>
indicative of the way people spoke back then, so I&#39;ll take your word as an <br/>
English major that that was not the case after all.<br/>

<br/>
After we listened to Treasure Island, we listened to Across the Plains, in which <br/>
he described his trip on the Transcontinental Railroad, often in the company <br/>
of the lower classes.<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday, we finished reading Huck Finn, quite a relief to me as the <br/>
narrator of Twain&#39;s ridiculously long sentences. Good example of what a run-<br/>
on sentences are in classic literature. Enjoyed the book, but again it was <br/>
difficult to read aloud for me.<br/>

My comment: <br/>
Yeah, that seems right to me.  I was reading Lydia some short stories by Kipling the other day, and had to look up one or two words *myself* during each story -- either to see what they meant or how to pronounce them. <br/>

He still didn&#39;t get to play as long as he wanted to, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567605580">**Reading level is a formula that has to do with the average and maximum <br/>
length<br/>
of words (syllables, I think, but maybe letters--if anyone knows, tell us!)<br/>
and the average length of sentences.  **<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used a formula from one of my husband&#39;s reading textbooks.  It has <br/>
to do with counting the lengths of sentences and with counting the <br/>
number of syllables in 100 word samples.  (It&#39;s supposed to be done with <br/>
three samples.)<br/>

Sandra, if you really want to see it I think I know what textbook it is <br/>

Below is a link to Fry&#39;s Readability graphs. You&#39;re supposed to count out 100 <br/>
word passages (avoiding dialogue), go back and count the number of <br/>
complete sentences/100 words, and go back again and count the number of <br/>
syllables per 100 words, and then look it up on the graphs to find reading <br/>
level. My understanding is that for better accuracy, you should repeat this <br/>
process 3 times per book.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1181309239">Hmmm... it didn&#39;t seem to me that there were that many words defined, I<br/>
would have said fewer than ten in each book. I thought it was a humorous<br/>
device, the narrator actually interupts his own story fairly frequently<br/>
to add information or forecast doom or whatever. I see it as a stylistic<br/>
thing... some of the definitions are kind of fun, too. I generally don&#39;t<br/>
like dumbed-down stufff, but this did&#39;t bug me for some reason.<br/>

They&#39;re not books you can take seriously in any way, for sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1199362714">Oh, just wait.  The definitions get funnier and funnier.  I suggest you get <br/>
  the next one tape and get the whole melancholy of it all.  What&#39;s the guy from <br/>
  Rocky Horror??  Tim somebody.  He reads some of them, and the author does <br/>
  others.  I recommend the guy from Rocky Horror, first.  <br/>
<br/>
  We&#39;ve read all but 3 and drooled over book the tenth at Sam&#39;s today.<br/>
<br/>
  Tuck<br/>
<br/>
  He&#39;s written the next one?!!!!! We finished the Carnivorous Carnival ages ago and have been not so patiently waiting for the next one. The boys will be excited to hear this. We also love the books read by Tim Curry. <br/>

Yeah yeah!  His last name just wasn&#39;t in my head.  I kept wanting to say Tim <br/>

He does a really disgusting cough on Lemony Snicket that Will and I still <br/>
imitate.  lol.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571770610"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;In some respects, it&#39;s a moot point, since I <br/>

&gt;development is something that continues life-long. <br/>
&gt;Karen<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a recent run in with an example of how a large<br/>
vocabulary can have negative social impact.  <br/>
<br/>
I was sitting in this week in a job skills training<br/>
class at a local college.  We were performing a mock<br/>
interview for a woman with a lot of experience as a<br/>
CNA and other related medical areas.  She was asked<br/>
what she expected as a salary, and was at a loss as to<br/>
a polite way to word a response without aiming too<br/>
low, or scaring them away with a highball figure.<br/>
<br/>
We did a round table discussion afterwards, throwing<br/>
out suggestions for improving her weaker answers and<br/>
pointing out where her answers were strong.  When she<br/>
asked about how to answer the salary question, I<br/>
suggested something along the lines of &quot;I am hoping<br/>
for a salary commensurate with with experience, but I<br/>
am flexible about my starting wage.&quot;  The instructor<br/>
of this college level course, easily 20 years older<br/>
than me and with a masters degree, looked at me<br/>
strangely and laughed out loud.  She said,<br/>
&quot;Commensurate?!  That&#39;s related to depressive<br/>
feelings.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
It was my turn to look quizzical.  I articulated<br/>
carefully &quot;Com-men-su-rate?  Are you certain?&quot;  She<br/>
nodded, so I said &quot;I don&#39;t mean commiserate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She looked at me blankly and said  &quot;oh&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The woman who was doing the mock interview didn&#39;t know<br/>
the word either, and asked me about it.  So I got the<br/>
dictionary and showed it to her and she experimented<br/>
with using it, or similar wording, in different ways<br/>
to ask for an appropriate salary.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I was a very big hit with the<br/>
instructor, although I certainly was not trying to<br/>
embarrass her in any way.<br/>
