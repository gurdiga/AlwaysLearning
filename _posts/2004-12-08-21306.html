<h4>Q at 2004-12-08 02:08:00 +0200 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780861804">I&#39;ve been in the group for awhile, and have lurked on Unschooling Discussion<br/>
for about a year now...I decided it was time to stick my nose out<br/>
of the Lurkers&#39; Lounge and say hi, and thank you for the inspiring and<br/>
stimulating discussions.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Quenby, from Connecticut and Southern California but<br/>
living in Tokyo, Japan with my (yes, he is Japanese) husband of 14 years<br/>
and our two beautiful bicultural kids, ages 1 and almost 5.<br/>
Homeschooling/Unschooling  is technically illegal here in Japan but in fact<br/>
there are people doing it. My kids are still<br/>
very young, so to be honest I am making this up as I go.<br/>
I&#39;m already a bit of a rebel because my older child isn&#39;t in a preschool<br/>
every day.<br/>
I credit this group, Unschooling Discussion, and Sandra in particular,<br/>
with helping me to question many of my beliefs about education.<br/>
<br/>
In particular, if any of you are unschooling bilingual, bicultural kids I am<br/>
very interested in hearing about your experiences. I&#39;m on a couple of<br/>
bilingual parenting lists but they are geared more towards a traditional<br/>
schooled approach.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1517555700">I&#39;ve been on this list for quite a while now (I&#39;m also on other lists <br/>
where I mostly lurk as well) and have really learned/questioned *so <br/>
much* from the stimulating and inspiring discussions (as well from J. <br/>
Holt&#39;s and other&#39;s books and also many websites, including Sandra&#39;s) <br/>
here and there.... thank you all for this !!<br/>
I&#39;m Sandrine, I live in France and am the mother of 2 boys aged 5 and <br/>
2... I&#39;m also pregnant with our 3rd child, due in march 2005.<br/>
I started looking for information on how to homeschool legally in France <br/>
when my oldest was about 2 y.o. because I didn&#39;t feel like sending him <br/>
to school not at 3 (K) or even later... I (can&#39;t really say &quot;we&quot; because <br/>
DH is still a bit reluctant to the whole homeschooling thing, not to <br/>
mention unschooling) slowly moved from an eclectic homeschooling <br/>
approach to unschooling because it just makes so much more sense that <br/>
way, both for me and my kids (I wish it did too to their Daddy...).<br/>
<br/>
Well, wasn&#39;t that hard after all to finally post my intro :)<br/>

  I think my dh has caught the &quot;fever&quot;.  Yesterday I came home to find him cleaning my teen sons bedroom out of pure joy and thoughtfulness. (Our son has been very busy in a play production and at the end of an online class he is taking, and had commented on his lack of time to clean his room.) And this morning he realized there weren&#39;t enough video games to go around and went and bought another used game system.  It&#39;s only taken him about a year and one seminar with Sandra and Pam : )  to catch on, so thought that would give some of you hope.  However, I&#39;ll have to think on admitting whether he&#39;s surpassed me yet.  LOL<br/>

It got better gradually.<br/>
But still, what you describe above is better than a husband who says &quot;Put <br/>
them in school&quot; period.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of trying to justify every single thing, concentrate on the kids&#39; joy <br/>
and happiness and learning and THAT will start to justify your actions for <br/>
you.  As your husband starts to see it work, instead of hearing your <br/>
reassurances, he will become a believer.<br/>

I remember my husband&#39;s skeptical confusion about breastfeeding and family <br/>
bed, and then his STRONG defense of them later.  But I wasn&#39;t able to think <br/>
about that when I was first homeschooling because I had three little kids (5, 2 <br/>
and not quite born) and it was hard to think of much of anything very clearly.   <br/>
<br/>
The perspective of a few years does help, and the relative calm of having <br/>
kids who are able to put their own shoes and coats on and fasten their own <br/>
seatbelts helps immensely!!<br/>

My husband has been very supportive from the start so I count myself<br/>
extremely fortunate.  However, I do from time to time forward a certain<br/>
thread I think is worthy of reading.  We are still not totally on the same<br/>
page when it comes to bedtimes and such.  But to defend him at the same<br/>
time, I am myself, moving more in that direction.  This has really been a<br/>
journey for me personally.  I am presently reading Valerie&#39;s book, &quot;The<br/>
Unprocessed Child&quot;.  Oh my goodness, if you haven&#39;t read it, I highly<br/>
recommend it!  This might be a great time to share some reading with your<br/>
husband.   It is really stretching me to think in ways my brain never knew<br/>
to think.  I have a friend whose husband is being oh, how should I say<br/>
this...obnoxious!  Printing worksheets, making the kids write 4 times a<br/>
word, etc., etc. I told both of them that in order to be together they<br/>
really needed to read, read, read.  I am what I consider still a newby at<br/>
this.  We are only 1 year into the process and a process it has been :)<br/>
Don&#39;t know that anything I have said was really helpful but more than<br/>
anything I want to say, hang in there and don&#39;t loose your focus.  Enjoy<br/>
watching your kids grow.  Those are moments you can&#39;t retrieve.<br/>

I noticed Keith being the one to reassure me sometimes about a year and a <br/>
half ago.  I was worried Kirby and college; Keith wasn&#39;t worried.  I was worried <br/>
about Marty and Holly going to the state fair without an adult; Keith wasn&#39;t <br/>
worried.  I was worried recently about Kirby driving five hours away without <br/>
anyone else; Keith wasn&#39;t worried.<br/>
<br/>

Sandra, thanks for the links. Also emerging from lurkdom.  Must be <br/>
outing month for Lurkers!<br/>
<br/>
The bedtime thing has been an issue at our house lately (sleep isn&#39;t <br/>
the issue it&#39;s just when they want to do it and it&#39;s my issue, not <br/>
theirs).  This is the most dfficult thing I&#39;ve had to deal with I <br/>
think since they were born. Short intro, 2 sons 15 and 12 (on <br/>
12/22). Older went to PS kinder and that was it for us. YS has only <br/>
been in a school to assist with a squid dissection class.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>
impressed by the whole school thing. Husb and I are pretty much in <br/>
agreement on our parenting styles.  When we&#39;ve hit these speed bumps <br/>
before I&#39;ve always tried to look back on how good things have gone <br/>
but it&#39;s more difficult this time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear stories from the other side-Kids Stayed up Until 3 <br/>
am Every Night-Brains Intact-No Mush Here, Officials State.<br/>
<br/>
This is the one board I read that I have to get up and walk around <br/>
sometimes to let things settle.  Or sometimes I stay away for a bit <br/>
but I always have to come back.  I know I can tell I&#39;m learning when <br/>
I&#39;m a bit uncomfortable and challenged.  It&#39;s a good feeling.<br/>

I don&#39;t know how well this applies, since Jayn is 5, but this is how our<br/>
sleep schedule works. I am reposting from another list, since nothing much<br/>
has changed.<br/>
<br/>
Slightly modified Quote begins:<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is recently 5 and continues to live in the rotating sleep pattern that<br/>
has become the norm at our house. <br/>
<br/>
Jayn lives on a 26-28 hour day. She sleeps for close to 10 hours and then<br/>
stays awake for 16 - 18. Since the world is rotating once every 24 hours,<br/>
this means we (she and I) are on a permanent slow march around the clock.<br/>
Sometimes she divides her sleep into two 5 hour sessions on a completely<br/>
unpredictable basis. In our household we are generally over the course of a<br/>
month or 5 weeks spending about a third of that time on a &quot;night shift&quot; when<br/>
Jayn gets up in the early evening and goes to be after the sun has risen.<br/>
Another part of the time she is getting up in the middle of the night and<br/>
going to bed in the mid afternoon - this is usually when she will take a nap<br/>
and somehow flip around to being on either nights or days. <br/>
<br/>
She has never had a set bedtime, and when a toddler simply went to sleep<br/>
with us. Dh and I were fortunate in that he was at home after a knee<br/>
replacement for the vast majority of her young life, so he and I were able<br/>
to have our adult together time in the morning. Recently he has returned to<br/>
work in the film business, on a varying schedule, so one of the limiting<br/>
factors in how I am able to cope with the pushing through to nights is the<br/>
need to avoid disturbing his rest. In the past, Jayn has been able to be<br/>
awake for a couple of extra hours in the bedroom watching tv and asking<br/>
periodically for a snack, while I snoozed. Now that dynamic occurs with me<br/>
on the increasingly uncomfortable (as we both age) sofa.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is not comfortable being alone and lonely during the nights, so I stay<br/>
with her. These quiet, intense times have been the scene of some of our most<br/>
enriched imaginative games and discussions. They can be wonderful nights. It<br/>
is only when she does her sudden flips that I have a serious tiredness<br/>
problem. When she moves into it gradually, I am able to just follow her,<br/>
still usually getting up an hour or so sooner than she awakens. I keep<br/>
myself alert by typing on the computer sometimes [or sewing], when she is<br/>
engaged with her dolls. Sometimes she watches DVD&#39;s, and there are times<br/>
when I watch some other DVD&#39;s on my computer or the portable player at the<br/>
same time. <br/>
<br/>
Being up all night has some restrictions that are not manifest during the<br/>
day. The first is obviously the need for quiet. Luckily our apartments have<br/>
wonderfully thick walls, and have all been soundproofed by the Los Angeles<br/>
Airport Authority. I have to help Jayn avoid jumping games, as we are on the<br/>
second floor. She gets her activity by doing sofa jumping, cycling on the<br/>
exercise bike, and after the sun comes up. <br/>
<br/>
The other restriction is the limited social contact she has during that 10<br/>
day(night) period. We struggle to get to her dance class (1pm on Tuesdays)<br/>
and the park playdate following. Sometimes she is literally getting out of<br/>
bed to rush to class, at other times, about to go to bed as soon as we get<br/>
home. I would expect her to miss one every now and then, but so far the<br/>
enjoyment she gets out of class has motivated her to get up and go, even<br/>
when sleepy. [Except for one time, when she was just too tired to get up<br/>
after only 3 hours of sleep - so missed one class in a 10 week session] In a<br/>
way it is worse since it interrupts the cycle and I am the one getting<br/>
insufficient rest when these jumps occur.<br/>
<br/>
When she is on a day schedule, I get her outdoors as often as possible. Up<br/>
until a couple of weeks ago [now about 2 months] we were swimming whenever<br/>
we awoke during daylight hours. We have an understanding group of home<br/>
schooling friends who never call here before 10am and are kind about making<br/>
playdates in the afternoon. We have a sorta kinda regular Friday playdate,<br/>
that we can cancel with one phone call without rancor. It is a fine balance<br/>
between going places at a certain time and how long the drive home then is -<br/>
sometimes a nap during that drive is utterly disastrous. It only takes 15<br/>
minutes of sleeping for Jayn to be refreshed enough for seven more energetic<br/>
hours, regardless of when she awoke that &quot;morning&quot;. Awakening her when she<br/>
doesn&#39;t wish to get up is futile. She has chosen to miss birthday parties<br/>
and sleep instead. Trying to manipulate her into sleeping - even with<br/>
nursing, darkened rooms, quiet time, warm baths, valium (JUST KIDDING!) any<br/>
kind of trick at all - is equally pointless. She has kept on playing and<br/>
chatting happily for hours after I would have expected collapse. <br/>
<br/>
The only time that we ever have any kind of emotional conflict or issues<br/>
between us over sleeping, is when I am not being acceptant of Jayn&#39;s<br/>
schedule. It is true that I am sometimes tired. However I have to choose to<br/>
not be resentful or fight her process, or I am tired *and* grumpy. I adapt<br/>
my other activities - cleaning, laundry, shopping, errands - around her.<br/>
Thank goodness for 24 hour markets!<br/>
<br/>
Dh makes time to play with Jayn when he gets home from work. Again the only<br/>
times when there are conflicts [about sleeping] between us, are when he<br/>
loses his sense of acceptance about the sleep schedule - if he is feeling<br/>
lonely or left out. Most of the time he is a miracle of acceptance.<br/>
<br/>
I have the expectation that this is temporary. I have been sometimes<br/>
reassured by other Unschoolers that this will likely pass. Eventually Jayn<br/>
may need fewer sleep hours so her days will regulate back to being 24 hours<br/>
long. Also she will gradually become more self sufficient and less needy of<br/>
company or assistance, so in time I will be free to follow my own preference<br/>
of sleeping, which is to go to bed between midnight and 2am and rise around<br/>
10-10.30am. (Theater hours) For all I know she will become the same morning<br/>
person my dh is. Or she may be a night owl, which is what I suspect.<br/>
<br/>
I occasionally talk to her about what she is missing by being awake at night<br/>
instead of during the day. She often talks about activities she wants to be<br/>
part of - such as ice skating or gymnastics. I will have to make sure that<br/>
these classes are not early in the morning. Our ability to get to something<br/>
regularly scheduled before 11am would often be pretty impaired by both my<br/>
tiredness and her schedule. <br/>
<br/>
We eat at appropriate times (ie when we are hungry but that is about every<br/>
4-5 hours with odd snacks between for Jayn) relative to when we get out of<br/>
bed, rather than the clock. Often this means Jayn and I are eating our lunch<br/>
or breakfast with dh who is having dinner. Jayn tends to eat a lot of one<br/>
thing at each sitting, and a bite or two of the other parts - like a lot of<br/>
chicken, a lot of potato, a lot of broccoli, a lot of chocolate chip<br/>
cookies, a lot of turkey ham sandwiches, a lot of apple - but it all<br/>
balances out over the course of her day or week.<br/>
<br/>
I know that the way we live with Jayn&#39;s rotating sleep schedule is probably<br/>
out on the extreme edge of child led living. But it really is easier than<br/>
the alternative - a constant struggle with Jayn over her sleeping. One of<br/>
the reasons we were drawn to homeschooling in the first place was to be free<br/>
from early mornings for someone else&#39;s convenience. Jayn has always had the<br/>
opportunity and freedom to sleep when she wanted to, so I have to believe<br/>
that this schedule is natural to her. Fortunately we have a lifestyle that<br/>
permits us to honor her unusual needs. There are others that would not -<br/>
being farmers, needing two incomes, having multiple children - so I am not<br/>
recommending it, just offering a description.<br/>
<br/>
The opportunity to write about this, and remind myself that my attitude is<br/>
what the makes to most difference to my happiness, at any time of the day or<br/>
night, is very much appreciated.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My whole kids&#39; lives is the tale of that.   <br/>
Anything I&#39;ve ever written speaks to children who went to sleep when they <br/>
were sleepy.  Not &quot;3 am every night&quot;--that&#39;s as inflexible as 8:30 very night.<br/>
<br/>
The principles regarding sleep are that sleep has a biological purpose and <br/>
the clock doesn&#39;t know when people are sleepy.   People WILL sleep.  They must <br/>
sleep.  They LIKE to sleep, when they&#39;re sleepy.   People NEED to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Given all that, the &quot;when&quot; of sleeping has to do with consideration for <br/>
others.  Is the person (child or adult) scheduled to be somewhere the next day?  We <br/>
say &quot;Count backward...&quot; here and it means when do you need to get up?  How <br/>
many hours will you have slept if you go to sleep now?  In an hour?  When do you <br/>
need to go to sleep to be sufficiently prepared for tomorrow?<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;tomorrow&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;a school day&quot; but has its own individual unique <br/>
tomorrowness, then each evening&#39;s decisions are likewise unique.   If tomorrow is <br/>
&quot;nothing scheduled,&quot; a child who&#39;s actively engaged in something at midnight has <br/>
no read reason to go to sleep just because something *might* happen at 9:00 the <br/>
next day.  Something *is* happening at midnight.  So the priorities of <br/>
learning and of living with awareness in the moment trump the &quot;maybe&quot; of an <br/>
unscheduled tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
And another consideration is for them to be quiet and not disturb those who <br/>
are asleep.   For our kids, the privilege of being up later than the neighbors <br/>
and parents has always been contingent on them doing it so quietly that it&#39;s <br/>
not an inconvenience for anyone else.<br/>

Our 16 y/o dd sleeps from about 4 or 5 am til 10 or so. There is always a tv or stereo on and at least one light all night long. LOL DD and I read alot so we&#39;ve stayed awake reading as well.<br/>

We had NO schedule.  My hubby worked shift and was either working nights or<br/>
days, so we would stay up all night with him and watch movies.  This went on<br/>
for years, everyone just moving along to their own rhythm.  Then my 12 year<br/>

up all night and sleeping all day, this will never work.&quot;  Family members<br/>
laughed and said, &quot;He&#39;ll never be able to wake up early because you have not<br/>
put him on a schedule.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Well, this whole year, he has NEVER slept in late; in fact, he wakes up at<br/>
5:00am to play DIABLO for two hours before leaving for school.  SOooooo, I<br/>
guess people can do what they need to do when they need to do it.  If it&#39;s<br/>
not a &quot;habit&quot; it can be, quickly, we are very adaptive!  So, don&#39;t worry<br/>
about not having a schedule, because when you NEED to have one, it only<br/>
takes a few days to make a new habit for yourself!<br/>

that&#39;s great!  I secretly felt that it was not a biological factor that <br/>
caused our actions, but a desire which creates the motivation... I like <br/>

We run the gambit here for sleep schedules. I have four children 10, 12, 14,<br/>
& 15 and one dh. We all have our own preferences for sleeping, and I think<br/>
the challenge for us is making it work for all of us. My 12yo dd started<br/>
middle school this year (first time in ps) by her choice. This has really<br/>
given us some problems sleepwise to solve. The way our house is structured,<br/>
you can hear anything that&#39;s going on from most of the bedrooms. It actually<br/>
wouldn&#39;t be too bad if she closed her door, but she doesn&#39;t like to. She<br/>
wants the light out but the door open. So we&#39;ve had some discussions, some<br/>
of them heated, about when/if the house should be quiet. Two of the boys<br/>
tend to hit the hay by midnight, and my 15yo has a different sleep schedule<br/>
each day and I guess the word &quot;schedule&quot; doesn&#39;t really apply to him. He can<br/>
be up till dawn, or asleep at 8pm. My dh is unintentionally loud in general,<br/>
and he has the dangest time moving around quietly. My boys like music,<br/>
movies, TV, video games, and goofing off together, and they do these things<br/>
at all awake hours. It is hard for them to remember that someone is trying<br/>
to sleep. Some of the solutions they have come up with together include<br/>
finding where they can be in the house to be louder that dh won&#39;t hear so<br/>
much, dh is wearing earplugs, she is trying to sleep with her door closed, I<br/>
sometimes go to bed with her with the door closed, etc. I guess the<br/>
important thing for us in this situation was that we listened to each other<br/>
and tried to come up with ways to respect everyone&#39;s needs. It is in process<br/>
still, but mostly works okay for now.<br/>
<br/>
Someone mentioned that when someone wants to be up to do something with a<br/>
schedule, like attend school, the inspiration is there to do it. That is<br/>
certainly the case at our house as well. My 15yo has weekly film production<br/>
sessions that start at 9 and he hasn&#39;t missed a one, even though he&#39;s the<br/>
one that is most likely to still be up at dawn. My daughter hasn&#39;t been late<br/>
for school yet. If I made them do these things, I imagine it wouldn&#39;t work.<br/>
And I like Sandra&#39;s words about looking at what the day ahead requires for<br/>
sleep. That&#39;s the kind of structure we work with as well.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays!<br/>

Thanks for your thoughtful reply.  In our household, I work, and <br/>
sometimes at very strange hours.  Sleep is very important to me, I&#39;m <br/>
one of those people who doesn&#39;t function well on less than 8 hours. <br/>
This has been my challenge, coming to a place that works for all of <br/>
us.  All the replies so far have added something to the think tank. <br/>
Thanks to all.<br/>
