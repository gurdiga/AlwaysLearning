<div id="ygrps-yiv-1489583649">I made it and I&#39;m an American living in the UK. I started unschooling in the U.S. and when I moved over here I stayed happily latched to my unschooling title. I also tend to read much more heavily on the U.S. sites than I do on any UK ones. <br/>
<br/>
Run.ning is pretty new. And the UKUnschoolers is a little newer. There are 9 members, one who lives in the U.S. It is hard to have a local group cover a whole country. The ideas to be discussed are better off being talked about on a less location specific forum, and the specifics of local LEA problems aren&#39;t going to be easily addressed by 9 people from across all of the UK. But it is fun to have 8 people, who I didn&#39;t know before I created the group, suddenly appear. <br/>

I think it&#39;s great that people find each other on ANY list, but with  <br/>
the over-thousand, international aspect, try to keep this list for  <br/>
writing that can benefit large numbers of people.<br/>
<br/>
Having done my list-owner duty, I have to say that stuff like this  <br/>
thrills my anglophiliac soul:<br/>
<br/>

Gawd, I love England.  I can&#39;t believe I waited until I was too old  <br/>
to emigrate.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, but I love New Mexico, too. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been to England twice.  Here&#39;s some account of my second visit:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eastyorkshire">http://sandradodd.com/eastyorkshire</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly went again, after that:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/england">http://sandradodd.com/england</a><br/>
<br/>
and spoke at a homeschooling get-together (HesFes).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was an odd plan, to send Holly to Europe without a parent, but I&#39;m  <br/>
THRILLED that we could afford it, that we had a family on the other  <br/>
end we trusted and who knew her so well.  It was wonderful for her  <br/>
and I had fun keeping up with them and building that website.<br/>
