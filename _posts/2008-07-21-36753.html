<div id="ygrps-yiv-1278866292">Speaking of old tapes that just pop out of our mouths:<br/>
<br/>
I had an &quot;old tape&quot;  moment last night and Zac (age 14) promptly brought me back to &quot;now&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I was tired and was headed to bed.  He decided he wanted me to write out this list of songs he wants to purchase & down load to his MP3 player.  We had already discussed it previously and he knew we had agreed to purchase the songs.   He pulls up &quot;favorites&quot; where he has a ton of songs from You Tube marked.  I told him I was really tired and was basically in bed (steps from it).  I ask if he could please write them.  He said he cannot read his own writing.  Trying to encourage him I said if he slowed down and took his time he could do it.  He again insisted that he could not do it.  OLD TAPE MOMENT:  I said - so who&#39;ll write for you when I&#39;m not around?  He instantly came back with &quot;I&#39;ll figure that out when the time comes. But that time is not here yet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think he&#39;s been reading this list ;)<br/>

dh lorenzo has the worse writing...I love to write things nicely and<br/>
do so willingly for him.  Nowadays he has a slew of volunteers for<br/>
writing lists, addresses whatever, but he refuses to have help typing<br/>
on the computer! onefingered slow but independently clear writing.<br/>
