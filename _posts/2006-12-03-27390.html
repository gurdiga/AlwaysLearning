<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997092590">This morning I hadn&#39;t gotten up yet, and Brian (newly<br/>
9) was yelling, &quot;Yay! Yay, I got it!&quot; When I got up<br/>
and asked him what was up, he had written down page<br/>
numbers for the users guide for &quot;Locomotion,&quot; his<br/>
computer game.<br/>
<br/>
This is the kid that I&#39;ve joked has had a five-year<br/>
unit study on trains, starting on his fourth birthday.<br/>
He got his first train set, a Thomas one, and was off<br/>
and running. He&#39;s learned about interpersonal<br/>
relations through trains, geography, mechanics,<br/>
history, all sorts of things through the filter of<br/>
trains.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s learning about economics with the programs<br/>
that allow you to run a rail empire. He&#39;s excited this<br/>
morning that he&#39;s figured out how to build an airline<br/>
in the game--his interest is shifting to other<br/>
elements of transportation, especially ships and<br/>
planes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just great to watch--not flat like it types up.<br/>

So... do you have any photos? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll make a page on it and link it from nest and connections if you  <br/>
want.<br/>

<br/>
(&quot;Flat representations canï¿½t show these connections. Neither could an  <br/>
elaborate three-dimensional model,...&quot;  from the connections page.   <br/>
Another connection!)<br/>
