<div id="ygrps-yiv-1267745343">There will be a smaller-than-the-Albuquerque-version of Always Learning Live at a YMCA camp, May 18-20 near Worcester, Massachusetts.<br/>
<br/>
Plans are still being firmed up, and I don&#39;t know yet what it will cost, but there are some bunk beds and lots of tent space.<br/>

<br/>
There&#39;s a &quot;form&quot; there for pre-registration (or intent to think about attending, at least).<br/>
