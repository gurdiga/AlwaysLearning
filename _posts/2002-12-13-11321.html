<br/>
Both of you bring up some issues I do deal with with Riley. He does not eat<br/>
complete meals, he loves bread, nibbles on other food. 1 slice of pizza fills<br/>
him up. He has a limited palette of foods he likes and is just too busy to<br/>
bother with sitting down and eating for a while. Fish, chicken, steak are his<br/>
favorite protein foods. He will not even stay in the house when I cook beans,<br/>
let alone try one. Eggs come and go for him. Cheese sometimes. Peanut butter<br/>
bugs him, nuts sometimes will be eaten. He does crave sugars. I try complete<br/>
protein breads when I can find them at the store. Today he took a nap. Maybe<br/>
he has been too busy. Fatigue greatly increases his temper. <br/>
<br/>
His testicles are OK, I do wonder about his teeth, though. He had crowns put<br/>
in at 2, severe rot on his 2 fronts. 1 was damaged and pulled. His other could<br/>
be bugging him. He also is just started to lose teeth, lots are wiggly in his<br/>
mouth. He has 3  permanant front teeth too, so will need another<br/>
surgery/pulling sometime soon. I&#39;ll call his dentist. <br/>
<br/>
I thought about food sensitivity, but frankly I feel it is more his temperment<br/>
with a slightly hungry body, and I want him to gain selfcontrol. His dad and<br/>
his granddad both deal with this. We are trying to show him words work, ask<br/>
for help, walk away. We pound pillows. Reading turns him mellow again, yet I&#39;m<br/>
not always prepared to do this. And yes, I will find a rope to tie to the<br/>
pole. It was dark and cold the other night and I was finished jumproping too.<br/>
Thank you for giving me ideas to think about. As always, I learn a ton reading<br/>
from the list.<br/>

Me too.  Sometimes I get an anti-egg spell and can&#39;t stand them, and other <br/>
times they&#39;re my main food.<br/>
<br/>
Teething could be a factore.<br/>

Probably not just &quot;Slightly hungry, &quot; but hungry for something.<br/>
<br/>
Self control can come later.  If food fixes it, feed him!<br/>
<br/>
Will he eat cashews?  PayDay bars?<br/>

Have you ever closely watched how certain foods make him act? Just try being <br/>
more attune and observant maybe, especially with the dyes....just see if you <br/>
can figure something out.<br/>
Also, from everything you&#39;ve written here (and I&#39;m no expert) he sounds just <br/>
like a chammomilla child.  It&#39;s a homeopathic remedy and fairly cheap to get <br/>
a hold of (around 5-7 dollars usually for one bottle) that can be hugely <br/>
calming for those irritable, cranky types.<br/>
They taste like little sugar pills, so it&#39;s easy to get a child to eat them. <br/>
And it has the added benefit of distraction! When Jalen is getting all worked <br/>
up it sometimes calms him down just to put a yummy in his mouth.:)<br/>
Try to get 200cc if you can find it.<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of food dye, Jalen (22mo) got a hold of some bright blue Jelly <br/>
Belly&#39;s last night. I just changed a diaper that looked like intensely green, <br/>
mushy playdough...blech! (hope no one was eating when you got that visual) <br/>
grins....<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mary, I have been meaning to post on this issue, but<br/>
just do not have a lot of online time right now.  We<br/>
are out of town through the holidays dealing with my<br/>
hubby&#39;s accident and subsequent medical and insurance<br/>
issues.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I have a son who is just turning 6,<br/>
Thomas.  Thomas has a number of allergies, both severe<br/>
(life threatening), to milder (affecting skin or<br/>
sinuses, etc) to more subtle, behaviorally affecting<br/>
ones.  Thomas cannot eat nuts at all, and we must be<br/>
very cautious with eggs, and dairy products.  Thomas<br/>
is very sensative to what he eats in general.  <br/>
<br/>
Thomas also suffers from impulse control issues, is<br/>
extremely passionate and intense, and has obsessive<br/>
compulsive tendancies.  He is impatient and easily<br/>
frustrated.  He has sensory integration problems also,<br/>
and insists on only certain types of material for<br/>
clothing, certain cuts and styles, no tags, seams,<br/>
etc, and will not wear socks or underwear.  He also<br/>
has trouble focussing when there are distractions<br/>
around, like people talking in a room where he is<br/>
trying to watch tv.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing we did for him was to go to an all<br/>
organic diet.  Eliminating the chemicals, dyes and<br/>
preservatives from his diet made a huge difference in<br/>
his ability to get himself under control, and has<br/>
increased his patience and ability to cope with<br/>
stress.  Going organic also increased his tolerance<br/>
level for his many allergies, and he does not have<br/>
severe reactions as reasily, nor suffer from chronic<br/>
sinus congestion as much.<br/>
<br/>
The first thing we did though, before going organic,<br/>
was to limit refined sugars.  Rather than rationing<br/>
his treat intake, we began using honey and molasses in<br/>
baking, and buying organic treats from our local co-op<br/>
with cane sugar and other non-refined sweeteners.  He<br/>
moderates himself with these kinds of treats much<br/>
better than he was able to with the refined sugars. <br/>
We also are careful to not buy breads, soups, juices,<br/>
etc with corn syrup or other refined sugars in them. <br/>
This helped his anger management and self control a<br/>
lot.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing we did was limit his wheat intake.  We<br/>
noticed that Thomas was a what junkie, sometimes<br/>
wanting nothing but wheat products all day, eating<br/>
plain bread or toast, empty hot dog buns, plain<br/>
noodles, etc.  When he was eating this way, he was out<br/>
of control a lot.  Eliminating wheat from a western<br/>
diet is extremely hard.  We simply try to limit his<br/>
intake by using wheat alternatives as much as we can,<br/>
and buying bread with little or no wheat gluten in it.<br/>
 I buy spelt, rice, potato, and other flours to keep<br/>
on hand for sauces, gravies, soups, cooking in general<br/>
and baking.  I use at least half oat flour (grinding<br/>
up rolled oats in the food processor) in baking most<br/>
of the time, buy corn and rice noodles, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
With Thomas we also have to just occassionally stay<br/>
home when we have plans to go out, because he is not<br/>
able to cope at that time.  Or one of us stays home<br/>
with him.  He needs extra patience when he has a<br/>
change in his routine.  We try to keep him away from<br/>
really large or overstimulating activites, because he<br/>
gets overloaded and has meltdowns.  But he can take<br/>
them in moderation (like the hockey game with his dad<br/>
and uncle and brother last week.)  He likes to stay<br/>
home a fair amount, and is shy of crowds.  I see this<br/>
as him regulating his stimulation that way.  We try to<br/>
find special things to do with him that he can handle,<br/>
and when we do go to large or noisy functions, we take<br/>
our cues from him about how long he can stay before<br/>
getting burnt out.<br/>
<br/>
He is improving over time, as he matures.  He is very<br/>
challenging and exhausting right now, but I know he<br/>
will not always be that way.  At the moment, with our<br/>
family crisis and being away from home, he is proving<br/>
to be very challenging for us.  But we get by, one day<br/>
at a time.  You sound like a great Mom, Mary, and I am<br/>
sure that you and Riley will find solutions for his<br/>
challenges.  <br/>
<br/>
I was impressed by the self control Riley exhibited in<br/>
the car conversation about being left out, and his<br/>
great degree of empathy for Cassie in not wanting to<br/>
hurt her feelings.  Or maybe he just didn&#39;t want to<br/>
get into a fight ;-)  Empathy is something Thomas<br/>
struggles with.  Some days he is so empthetic he will<br/>
cry when someone else hurts themselves, and other days<br/>
he is downright coldhearted.  Sometimes he cycles<br/>
through varying degrees multiple times, back and<br/>
forth, in one day.  It all depends on the thousand<br/>
little things going on around and in him every day. <br/>
Anyway, hang in there Mary, you&#39;re not alone.<br/>
