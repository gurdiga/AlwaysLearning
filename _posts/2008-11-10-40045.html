<div id="ygrps-yiv-2018125842">Teachers get paid money to keep kids in a room and attempt to  <br/>
implement a curriculum.<br/>
Homeschoolers who choose to use a school-at-home method of some sort  <br/>
do the same thing, at home, for their own children, and they like to  <br/>
think of themselves as teachers because they believe learning can  <br/>
only happen when someone does what a teacher says.<br/>
<br/>
Natural learning, whether in a classroom or in an unschooling  <br/>
situation, has to do with the discovery and analysis of ideas and  <br/>
facts and reactions and connections by people who are learning in  <br/>
their own ways.  In a classroom or alternative school, the  <br/>
&quot;teachers&quot; (who still get paid to keep kids in a room or some known  <br/>
area of containment) are facilitators--they help the kids make  <br/>
discoveries and help them clarify their ideas and find more  <br/>
resources.  In unschooling, the parent facilitates learning day and  <br/>
night for years without days off.  And when unschooling becomes well  <br/>
integrated into a family&#39;s life, there&#39;s not a difference between the  <br/>
parenting actions and the facilitation actions.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Facilitate&quot; means to make something easier for someone else.<br/>
