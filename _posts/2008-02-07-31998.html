<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242428328">Hello all!<br/>
I don&#39;t think I have done an intro here. I&#39;m Courtney and am <br/>
unschooling along side my awesome son John, 7.<br/>
Anyway. I was hoping to get some recomendations for websites where I <br/>
can find fun activities for us to do. I am not very creative naturally <br/>
(maybe due to my 20+ yrs of schooling :) and find it hard to come up <br/>
with something different when we are bored. The sites could be arts & <br/>
craftsy, games, ects. Thanks in advance!<br/>

Instead of looking for schoolish websites with projects and  <br/>
instructions,  I recommend you look at unschooling websites and see  <br/>
what other families have done.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the websites below DO have museum-section type things, and  <br/>
online games:<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with something different when we are bored. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I made a surprisingly lengthy list of all the things that my dd and I like <br/>
to do under several headings and keep a copy on the fridge door. I have it <br/>
divided into sections - Outings, At Home, Quiet things, Games, Arts and <br/>
Crafts, and Physical. It is helpful especially when I am tired.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn&#39;s current favorite gaming websites are Webkinz and EverythingGirl.com.<br/>
