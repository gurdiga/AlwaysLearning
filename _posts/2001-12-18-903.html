<div id="ygrps-yiv-1962199371">We&#39;ve used almost all the miquon books -  from orange to yellow.<br/>
It was before we were unschooling, though.<br/>
My kids liked it okay, I usually *made* them do about 10 pages a week.<br/>
Using the cuisenaire rods for general playing and demonstrating concepts and ideas in the book were fun.<br/>
They were able to understand the concepts pretty easily.<br/>
I would use the books now ONLY if my kids were asking to do some workbook-type math.<br/>
Also, they are generally for grades K-3.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes - we have them. Just like everything else in our house they lay around <br/>
and get shuffled around and each of the kids has, at some time or another, <br/>
picked them up and enjoyed fooling with them. <br/>
<br/>
They are workbooks - but the kids can&#39;t really just pick them up and &quot;do&quot; <br/>
them - they don&#39;t have instructions in the workbook. You have to have what is <br/>
called the &quot;Lab Sheet Annotations&quot; to give instructions to the child about <br/>
what to do in the workbook. It emphasizes using manipulatives - cuisinairre <br/>
rods in particular. <br/>
<br/>
I like them - if I had to have a math program for my young child, these would <br/>
be a nice, gentle approach. But they aren&#39;t the best for my &quot;leave it laying <br/>
around&quot; curriculum &lt;BEG&gt; because they require the adult interaction. There <br/>
are cool workshops or even lame workbooks that let kids fool around on their <br/>
own, but these are definitely not like that. On the other hand, I think that <br/>
pulling out the Miquon math books to work on was one way my kids discovered <br/>
they could nearly always capture my undivided attention. <br/>
