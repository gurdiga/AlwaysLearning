<div id="ygrps-yiv-1452264816">I heard the commercial again this morning -- the one where the boy <br/>
gives his Mom his improved report card for her birthday, and she&#39;s <br/>
just so happy she could cry.  <br/>
<br/>
Then the narrator goes on.... &#39;if your child is having problems, or <br/>
just not being challenged enough....&#39;  Not challenged enough -- what <br/>
the heck is that about?  Like being stuck in school 7 hours a day, <br/>
with whatever homework isn&#39;t enough &#39;challenge?&#39;  How hard does a kid <br/>
have to work, to show he&#39;s being challenged?  I mean, if he&#39;s making <br/>
A&#39;s easily will working him so hard that his grades drop indicate <br/>
he&#39;s finally being challenged?  Or will he still be expected to make <br/>
A&#39;s, AND work harder?  Does your boss troll the office, doling out <br/>
busy work to folks who don&#39;t look challenged enough?<br/>
<br/>
Most schoolkids, when you figure in time to and from school plus <br/>
homework, already put in a longer day than adults who work full-<br/>
time.  Sounds to me like it&#39;s just a way to keep a kid so busy <br/>
parents don&#39;t need to spend any of their own time with the poor kid.  <br/>
Telling a kid he&#39;s not challenged enough, so you&#39;ve signed him up <br/>
with a tutor sounds punitive. Of course, it&#39;s really just another way <br/>
for Sylvan to make more money on anxious parents who never feel their <br/>
child is &#39;good enough.&#39;  Just another way to make parents and kids <br/>
feel inferior and to take more of their money..<br/>

&lt;&lt; Sounds to me like it&#39;s just a way to keep a kid so busy <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Yeah, and for parents to feel &quot;involved&quot; with their child without actually <br/>
becoming involved.  They&#39;ll hire another adult to be &quot;involved&quot; and at an expert <br/>
level!<br/>
<br/>
When I used to run an unschooling playgroup, a family came and the mom was a <br/>
nervous, impatient person.  The dad was laid back.  The kids were quiet and <br/>
what they (the family) really wanted was two things:  playmates for their little <br/>
girls (who were pre-school age at the time) and possible customers for the <br/>
mother&#39;s Sylvan reading business.<br/>
<br/>
Huh.<br/>
<br/>
Well they weren&#39;t the only family to use that playgroup as a sort of &quot;singles <br/>
bar&quot; for kids. &lt;g&gt;   Worse things can happen.   So Holly started hanging out <br/>
with those girls a lot, which was good because they swam daily, and Holly <br/>
learned to swim really well from hanging out with them in the pool at their <br/>
apartment complex.    The parents have ended up divorced and she&#39;s visited in both <br/>
new homes and we got to go to the mom&#39;s wedding when she remarried.  It turned <br/>
out good for Holly, after all, but there was a weirdness in their original <br/>
intent. <br/>
<br/>
Holly sat in at Sylvan a time or two after playing with the girls where their <br/>
mom worked.  I know the mom thought Holly NEEDED tutoring, but I was equally <br/>
as sure she did NOT.     So I think she sneaked her a lesson or two, which <br/>
only gave Holly more experience about what&#39;s out there in the world that she <br/>
might need, or not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1713798267">Sort of on this same vein of not being challenged enough.  Logan and I were at the park the other day when the school kids got out.  There were a few moms there talking about how the kids didn&#39;t have any homework that week because it was standardized testing week.  The moms decided this would never do so they were going to make up homework for their kids to do.  The schools have decided testing is enough for one week, but not these moms.  The poor kids were going to have to do homework that their mom&#39;s made up.  Talk about doing work for nothing!  I wanted to scream, but just walked away.  This was after one of the mom&#39;s had spanked her kid right there at the park.  He had been out of school for 2 minutes, how could he have needed a spanking already?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-830325180">Oh, last summer I ran into the woman who was my best friend in jr. high school -- we see each other every so often because she works at the local Target.  She went on and on about how she and her dh had just moved their two sons from one Christian school to another.  Turns out the new school is more stringent academically than the old one, so her son is now bringing home C&#39;s instead of A&#39;s (the older boy, the younger had only completed pre-K at the last school.)  Her solution was to borrow copies of the textbooks for last schoolyear from the new school, and have the boys spend 2 hrs every day reviewing so they&#39;d be ready for next year.  She actually said, &#39;I know Lucas is going into kindergarten, but there&#39;s so much he can forget over the summer.&#39;  He was only 5 -- he&#39;s not learned enough in school to have much to forget!  She explained that she was very worried about her 10yo&#39;s math performance, because you know how important Algebra is to doing well in college and that college is<br/>
 the only way to well in adult life.<br/>
 <br/>
I almost bit a hole in my tongue.  I wanted to say &#39;Right, and that college degree you got is serving you so well, working as a shelf stocker here at Target.&#39;  People just don&#39;t get it.<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is where I&#39;m having a problem.  I have family and friends who are <br/>
really into the whole school mentality and I&#39;m can&#39;t just sit and listen <br/>
very well anymore.  One of my best friends was so upset at her son last <br/>
week.  He hadn&#39;t done his math homework the night before, so she made <br/>
him sit at the table that morning to do it before the bus came.  She <br/>
went upstairs to shower and dress, but ran back down for something and <br/>
caught him using her calculator.  She was furious and told me on the <br/>
phone that he was going to be in huge trouble when he got home from <br/>
school.  I had to say something.  So I said, &quot;Aren&#39;t you a little proud <br/>
of him for figuring out how to best solve HIS problem.  I can only do <br/>
most math with a calculator.&quot;  Hell, I was proud of him!  But she just <br/>
sort of hurummphed and ended the topic.  <br/>
<br/>
Another example is my dd&#39;s birthday coming up on the 29th.  She&#39;s <br/>
forgoing a party so she can can have a day in the city at the zoo, the <br/>
play McDonald&#39;s and a movie.  She desperately wants her best friend to <br/>
come and share the day.  It&#39;s fine with me, but her mom, another friend <br/>
of mine, says she can&#39;t let her dd miss a day of school for playing. <br/>
 Her dd is in kindergarten.  I&#39;m REALLY sure whatever happens in that <br/>
classroom that day is going to be vital to that girl&#39;s future (please <br/>
note the heavy sarcasm).  Elysia&#39;s heart is set on going on that day, <br/>
not another.  That&#39;s fine.  It&#39;s just frustrating when your friends <br/>
can&#39;t seem to see the forest for the trees.  That little girl won&#39;t <br/>
remember March 29th two days after it&#39;s happened because it will be just <br/>
another day at school, whereas, she could have had a great, memorable <br/>
day with us.  <br/>

I&#39;ve had this problem with friends whose kids are in preschool.  PRESCHOOL!!  They won&#39;t let them miss a day of preschool to go on a cool trip with us.  They will remember a trip to the zoo much longer than whatever they did that day in preschool.  It makes me crazy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I understand completely.  My son&#39;s best friend was inducted into the Junior <br/>
Honor Society last week at his middle school.  I have been to graduations that <br/>
were less formal than this.  The speaker, yes they had a keynote speaker, got <br/>
up and asked these kids if they wanted to be successful.  Of course they all <br/>
nodded their heads and we in the audiance did as well.  The woman then <br/>
proceeded to ask them what they felt success meant and proceeded to ask them :  Would <br/>
you feel successful if you had a nice car,  lived in a $300,000 house, could <br/>
go away on fancy vacations and she was serious.  Nothing about having a great <br/>
family or being happy it was all about money and she was dead serious.  I <br/>
almost stood up in the middle of the whole thing and asked if there was anyone else <br/>
in the audiance who was as offended by this as I was.  I felt that these <br/>
children needed to be removed from the building.  It is getting very difficult to <br/>
keep my mouth shut.<br/>
As an aside the woman, who had five kids of her own, said that her oldest two <br/>
had not been focused on success because the oldest had run after a boy and <br/>
had a child and the next did not go to college and was in the Marines about to <br/>
be shipped to Iraq.  All I could think was that maybe if she had defined <br/>
success differently, her kids might have beed different or she might have been able <br/>
to accept them as they were.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-685006516">You posted that your husband has a SSN and works for a French firm.  <br/>
Are you considered permanent residents, under the law? Do you <br/>
recieve health benefits from the governement? <br/>
<br/>
I ask because we live in Prague, Czech Republic.  Basically, we live <br/>
under the radar. :)  My husband&#39;s firm is NOT Czech and we travel <br/>
out of the country every three months or so to get our passports <br/>
stamped.  We don&#39;t get benefits, we pay out of pocket expenses for <br/>
everything and are often charged more for things because we are not <br/>
permanent residents. BUT we are FREE to do as we like. And that is a <br/>
good feeling.<br/>
<br/>
Find out how the French government classifies your family and then <br/>
you&#39;ll know if they have the &quot;right&quot; to police your actions <br/>
concerning education.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck<br/>
