<div id="ygrps-yiv-1081836225">This is an interesting topic....<br/>
I think there ARE some people who can&#39;t or shouldn&#39;t unschool. A big issue is <br/>
trust...the bottom line is that you have to trust (your child? the universe?) <br/>
that your kid WILL learn, left to his or her own whims. You also have to <br/>
trust that that learning will help them have good lives.<br/>
<br/>
Some people trust their kids, for the most part, but are afraid in some <br/>
cases. I think about an unnamed person who worries that some of her kids have <br/>
too many &quot;issues&quot; or disabilities to be trusted. These people mean well, but <br/>
the fear gets in their way.<br/>
<br/>
I would never suggest unschooling, or even homeschooling to my sister. She <br/>
adores her kids, and is VERY involved in my nephew&#39;s school and advocates for <br/>
him passionately. If they were home, though, she&#39;d drive him nuts (and <br/>
vice-versa). She worries too much, and she could never let go enough. <br/>
Everyone would be in tears regularly.<br/>
<br/>
I think most, if not all kids can probably unschool (unless they&#39;ve been to <br/>
damaged in the curiosity department, maybe?), but that there aren&#39;t that many <br/>
parents who can. And lots of those parents REALLY want to be able to, or <br/>
there wouldn&#39;t be all those people SAYING they do unschool, when they clearly <br/>
don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
So, the real question is...how do we figure out who can/should unschool? I <br/>
recently talked to a beginning homeschooler who wanted to know what to do. I <br/>
suggested he read around at Unschooling.com. I said he&#39;d likely have one of <br/>
two reactions: &quot;This could never work. My kid would never do anything!&quot; or <br/>
&quot;This is really exciting! I wish I could have done this!&quot; (He turned out to <br/>
be an unschooler.)  I suppose you could also get the &quot;This sounds cool, but <br/>
you have to TEACH math.&quot; (Maybe that&#39;s the eclectic homeschooler?)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe we need one of those personality quizzes to determine what kind of <br/>
Homeschooler you are?<br/>
