<div id="ygrps-yiv-1998826988">School Blamed for Daughter&#39;s Internet Liaison<br/>
<br/>
(Honeoye, N.Y.) AP - Luann Waden recently filed a notice of claim  <br/>
that she plans to sue the Honeoye Central School District.<br/>
<br/>
She blames the school district after her daughter ran off with a guy  <br/>
she met online.<br/>
<br/>
Waden said she made clear on a consent form at the start of the  <br/>
school year that her 15-year-old daughter was not to be allowed  <br/>
Internet access. But the girl used the school computers to access the  <br/>
Web site MySpace.com, where she met 18-year-old Michael Macbeth.<br/>
<br/>
In March, the Ontario County Sheriff&#39;s Office arrested Macbeth on  <br/>
charges of endangering the welfare of a child after he picked up the  <br/>
girl at Honeoye High School.<br/>
<br/>
The school attorney wouldn&#39;t comment about the allegations.<br/>

So unless it was an all-girls&#39; school, the mom had just sent the girl  <br/>
to a place that was FULL of boys (maybe hundreds) between 15 and 19,  <br/>
so why blame the school or MySpace or the internet if the girl wanted  <br/>
to go somewhere besides home after school?<br/>

<br/>
  Or, if it was an all-girls&#39; school, maybe that was why she wanted to go somewhere else after school?  I have a public school teen- her choice, most definitely NOT mine. She has access to friends, to the internet, to boys, phones, etc.  She doesn&#39;t ask to use the PC or get told to get off after so long- unless someone else needs to use it, and I don&#39;t worry about what she does if stays up after me at night.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;m unsure why a parent would deny the child the use of the internet at school?  I wonder if this parent also denied use of the internet in her home or if she only allows it during certain hours, has parental blocks, etc? I couldn&#39;t imagine.  I trust my kids and wouldn&#39;t dream of such a thing- not just with the internet but with everyday life.   <br/>
