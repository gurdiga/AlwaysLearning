It&#39;s not a disease.<br/>
He is dyslexic, perhaps.<br/>
Why do you care?  Who brought it up or tested him or labelled it?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Why?<br/>
Why, if you&#39;re unschooling, are you wanting to &quot;orientation train&quot; a nine year old?<br/>

Why was he diagnosed?<br/>
<br/>
In school, it&#39;s a problem since schools need kids reading  <br/>
independently by 3rd grade. At home, it&#39;s not a problem unless the  <br/>
parents elevate book learning above other kids of learning.<br/>

Sandra has a lot of links about reading at<br/>

<br/>
Also if you search for dyslexia on her search page<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/search">http://sandradodd.com/search</a><br/>
<br/>
That will turn up a bunch of links  about dyslexia.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How do you know? Is it something he complains of? That&#39;s an important point. My daughter might be diagnosed with dyslexia if she was in school, but its mostly a non-issue for her. The only time it has ever been a problem is when she&#39;s come to work with me and wanted to label some boxes by hand and kept getting her 2s and 5s reversed - potential disaster! So we had a brief, gentle conversation about that and she worked out a strategy to be sure her numbers were all the right way &#39;round. <br/>
<br/>
Better than a training program is to research the strategies used by adult dyslexics, if your son is complaining of problems or is getting frustrated. My ex went through some training program or other and intensive tutoring in school as a child, but it didn&#39;t change the fact she was dyslexic - so she learned a set of skills to help her live in the real world. Those are the skills your son needs if he&#39;s struggling either to read or write - real adult skills. Some of them are listening skills - the adults I know with stronger dyslexia all have much better verbal memories. My ex got through a masters degree in art history without taking notes, since she couldn&#39;t read her notes anyway. Some are sight-reading skills, like holding a page of words at arm&#39;s length so you rely more on word shape and context than individual letters. Adults with dyslexia often can read street-signs farther away than adults without because they don&#39;t rely on letters as much. Doing things with your eyes closed is another adult dyslexic trick - tricky to write that way if you&#39;re trying to stay neatly in the lines, but handy now and then.<br/>
<br/>
Kids often go through a period of reversing letters and numbers and grow out of that. That can make lessons and training programs seem more effective than they really are. But a large part of the &quot;problem&quot; of dyslexia stems from the ways schools teach and test reading and writing. Those problems can be left behind with school. <br/>

<br/>
The biggest question is: Â Why is this a problem that you think needs to be fixed with special intervention?<br/>
