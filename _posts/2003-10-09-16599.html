Hey, I loved and STILL loved reading those kind of things as a kid.  How to <br/>
organize a wedding.   Baby shower games.  Ideas for birthday party favors.  I&#39;d <br/>
read accounts of funerals to see how pall bearers seemed to be chosen.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never read anything cooler, though, than old etiquette books that tell <br/>
what color livery servants should wear, and what the separated duties of <br/>
upstairs maids and chamber maids and downstairs maids and such should be.  Calling <br/>
cards and home visits.  And how to respond to a formal invitation if you can&#39;t <br/>
go, and how to send gifts for weddings for people you don&#39;t even know!!    <br/>
That was a trove of social trivia, and sometimes in there you can see the roots <br/>
of things we still do today.   Pretty cool!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726176226">I think my favorite old read was a parenting book my mother got when she <br/>
was pregnant with my sister.  It had great information on breastfeeding, <br/>
for the most part, but the other stuff (diet, hygene, dress, etc.) was <br/>
just too much.  I laughed all the way through it.  The assumption was <br/>
the pregnant woman was married and a stay at home mom. <br/>

I also have a 1940something planned parenthood book.  That&#39;s even better.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1721180687">I found an old preggie guide from the 70s in a junk shop a few years ago.  The photos were hilarious.  The chapter on conception had a couple walking along the beach at sunset.  The chapter on labour starting had a woman at the kitchen sink (naturally) leaning forward a tiny bit, with one hand on her side.  Then when you get to the serious end of labour there was a photo montage of the three stages of labour - very dramatic shots - all from the waist up!!!!!!!<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
