I would say to keep it in the cue for when your five year old is a bit older--there&#39;s plenty of <br/>
time!  Neither of my kids likes to be scared, although of course what they find scary changes <br/>
so much as they age.  Still, I&#39;m shocked sometimes about what movies other peoples kids <br/>
have seen, because at any given age, their kids are usually watching more than what mine <br/>
are.<br/>
<br/>
It is getting really fun with ds--almost 13.  His tastes are getting more sophisticated all the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
We like to go to dove.org to check out movies--not for their recommendations, but because <br/>
they are pretty detailed about what levels to expect.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ah, but according to Miriam Webseter&#39;s online dictionary, cue is a  <br/>
valid spelling for queue; it&#39;s the 4th entry.  I don&#39;t know exactly  <br/>
when that change came about.  But it was worth reading your email to  <br/>
learn about nudzh!!!<br/>
