<div id="ygrps-yiv-1107071205">Hello, I am a new member of this list, having found it via Sandra&#39;s<br/>
website. I am currently researching unschooling. We have been<br/>
homeschooling for just over 2 years now, and are getting steadily more<br/>
&#39;relaxed&#39;. I homeschool 2 children aged 16 and 11. I also have an 18<br/>
year old. As yet we are not unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to discern what people actually mean by unschooling and so<br/>
have found your recent discussions interesting. It seems to me there<br/>
are two major differences between a type of &#39;benign neglect&#39; and<br/>
unschooling. <br/>
<br/>
The first seems to be  a steady diet of interests and resources fed to<br/>
your child with a lack of attachment to these resources in yourself.<br/>
For example you may leave a number of informative magazines (or other<br/>
items)around, but you do not mind if your child chooses to ignore<br/>
them. (ditto for trips etc. You go to the zoo, but you do not require<br/>
your child to &#39;do&#39; or &#39;see&#39; anything in particular whilst there)<br/>
<br/>
The second seems to be &#39;availability&#39;. For example if your child wants<br/>
to know how the lawnmower works, you are immediately available to help<br/>
her wrestle with the sticky garage door, provide screwdrivers for<br/>
removal of covers etc to see inside said lawnmower. (One may even get<br/>
the lawn cut, but maybe that&#39;s getting &#39;attached&#39; again!)Or available<br/>
to drive to the library, or the beach or wherever. <br/>
<br/>
I can see at once in families there must be some give and take and<br/>
someone needs to make sure there is some balance here, as bullying<br/>
between family members is all too common. It should not always be the<br/>
same person who gives up their visit to the park in order to allow<br/>
another family member to visit the library. Ditto with financial<br/>
resources, computer time, parental availability etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now do you experienced unschoolers feel I am on the right track here?<br/>
It is very hard to understand unschooling, particularly if you have no<br/>
 practical examples around you to observe. But I am trying....<br/>

<br/>
Bullying isn&#39;t common when people have lots.  Lots of time,  <br/>
attention, freedom, etc... bullying isn&#39;t too common.<br/>
<br/>
If you start from negative presumptions, it&#39;s harder to expect good  <br/>
things to happen.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The tone of this sounds too forced.  &quot;Diet&quot; and &quot;fed&quot; aren&#39;t as  <br/>
descriptive as &quot;interesting things provided.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE some of the things I share with my kids.  I&#39;m quite attached  <br/>
to them, myself.  I learned to accept that my kids might not always  <br/>
love the same things I do.<br/>

<br/>
A child is very unlikely to wonder  how a lawnmower works when it&#39;s  <br/>
sitting quietly in the garage.  But when someone&#39;s mowing, it might  <br/>
be cool to take the time to show her, if she&#39;s interested.  If she  <br/>
asks between times, open a webpage!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It would seem, however, we are on the same idea...the semantics are<br/>
more of a problem than the concepts.<br/>
<br/>
Then one realizes just how much the way one SAYS a thing affects the<br/>
way one thinks about it.<br/>
<br/>
I think this is one of the problems about learning about unschooling.<br/>
Its so very easy to &#39;get it wrong&#39;. I, like many other &#39;schooled&#39;<br/>
adults I know (I am sure there are some people not so affected but<br/>
sadly I have met more like me) find that when I get things wrong, I<br/>
retire from the discussion. Unschooling is easy to &#39;get wrong&#39;. It is<br/>
easier to get out the workbooks. It takes determination and resistance<br/>
to the above mentioned conditioning to carry on finding out.<br/>
<br/>
However, I am determined to discover more about unschooling, so carry<br/>
on. Put me straight. Semantics are important. They way we speak (or<br/>
write) reflects the assumptions we live by, and many assumptions can<br/>
do with a review in the light of day every now and again!<br/>
