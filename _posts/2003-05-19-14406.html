&gt; and emmy for the best children&#39;s series Reading<br/>
&gt; Rainbow.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He said that this may be the last year of the show due<br/>
&gt; to lack of funds.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I feel this is something that can&#39;t happen.  I have a<br/>
&gt; hard time with this happening when there is so much<br/>
&gt; stuff on there that is not good.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you for letting me sound off.<br/>

out whatever kind of sheets he wanted for it.<br/>
<br/>
He asked for Levar sheets, which unfortunately did not exist. We loved <br/>
Reading Rainbow. I&#39;m sad it might end. And I&#39;m still so sad about the death <br/>
of Fred.<br/>
