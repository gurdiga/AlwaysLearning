I found this looking for images for The Lyrics Game (the word today is  <br/>
&quot;spot&quot; and I was going to look for an explanation of card spots or  <br/>
dice spots).   It&#39;s pretty nice!   Might be worth a bookmark, and I  <br/>
take it from the copyright notice it might be maintained by kids, and  <br/>
by the ad/catalog that it might be in the U.K.<br/>
<br/>
They have sections on art, history, recreation, science, society and  <br/>
technology, with discussion forums.<br/>
