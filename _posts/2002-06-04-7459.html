<div id="ygrps-yiv-461570172">We are planning on purchasing a gaming system for my son&#39;s birthday this year.  Can any of you recommend a system?  It&#39;s been a long time since my husband & I played Nintendo ;-) and are clueless about the new systems.  I figured some of you would have some 1st hand knowledge of XBOX, etc and the games available.  (Dillon will be 10 and already loves playing Majesty type games on his computer and everything on his Gameboy!...He also has a little sister who is almost 6).  What do you and your kids like? <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Though all the game systems have titles exclusive to those systems, there<br/>
are some popular recurring characters that are exclusive to Nintendo like<br/>
Mario and Pokemon.<br/>
<br/>
Nintendo tends to have a lot more games for the under teen group and fewer<br/>
for teens.<br/>
<br/>
The new titles for the GameCube are coming out *slowly* so they may not have<br/>
much to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
The XBox just dropped $100 so it&#39;s down to the $200 range now. That probably<br/>
indicates it hasn&#39;t been as popular as Bill Gates hoped but he&#39;s got a lot<br/>
of money to keep it afloat for a while ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Could you fantasize with him which system he&#39;d buy and why? You might be<br/>
able to pull it off and make it sound like general conversation and not<br/>
fishing for present ideas ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-29161999">My son just bought a GameCube after considerable debate. (Then they dropped<br/>
$50; it was quite frustrating for him to get a lesson in economics this<br/>
way!) Have him go to a Target or game store and play all the different<br/>
systems so he&#39;ll get a feel for each. Sean balanced the games available vs<br/>
cost vs expected lifespan vs graphics. Don&#39;t forget the different features,<br/>
like Playstation being able to play DVDs. That&#39;s what he wants now....<br/>

<br/>
If you go to a gaming/computer shop or ToysRUs you can try the games out, <br/>
usually.  <br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s being played here seems to be quick and competitive games on the 64, <br/>
and long drawn out role-playing things on the PS2.  Kirby complained that <br/>
there were NO role playing games for 64, but just got one which was for <br/>
either 64 or game cube this week. (I keep writing while they&#39;re asleep and I <br/>
can&#39;t check, and when they&#39;re awake they take the computer away from me! &lt;g&gt;) <br/>
 Whatever was on the cover of Nintendo Power, he went and bought.  I LOVE him <br/>
having a job!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115165368">We bought a Nintendo64 at Christmas and have sinced realized the benefits<br/>
of other systems.  I don&#39;t regret the purchase though since the games are<br/>
much cheaper due to it&#39;s discontinuance.  We&#39;re able to buy a lot of<br/>
games from ebay and used game stores.<br/>
<br/>
I think my next purchase will be the Playstation 2 because they seem to<br/>
have the kind of games that interest me the most.  I also like the idea<br/>
of getting a gaming system and DVD player in one.<br/>
<br/>
However, we are HUGE fans of the Zelda series of games so I know we will<br/>
be getting the Gamecube eventually as well.  Video games have become a<br/>
big hit with the entire family and we spend a lot of hours together<br/>
watching one or the other play.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749790701">Hi Cindy,<br/>
I asked my 2 teenage sons, who&#39;ve been playing vid games most of their lives, to comment on your question.  Below&#39;s my 19-year old&#39;s response; hope it&#39;s helpful!<br/>
--Juanita (Ithaca, NY)<br/>

<br/>
Well, choosing the best system is all about picking genres.<br/>
If you like games oriented towards a younger audience, a Gamecube would be the best choice, PlayStation 2 has more adult oriented games, and although I do not have one, XBox seems to be more on the PlayStation side.<br/>
This is of course not set in stone, for example; GameCube has the game Resident Evil, which is absolutely not for children, and it&#39;s not hard to find games like Super Bombad Racing for PlayStation.<br/>
So, it&#39;s really up to how adult you want the games.<br/>
Also, the GameCube does not play DVD movies and the XBox requires a special remote control to do so.<br/>
So the PlayStation has a slight advantage being the only one that can play DVDs straight out of the box.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>

Many games won&#39;t work without them.  And get the brand name, not the <br/>

little more $$ that have 1,056 blocks.  We got our GameCube from an eBay<br/>
auction, and it came with a standard card, extra contoller and a game; one<br/>
of the first things my kids did was buy the upgraded card.<br/>

&gt;(Same for X-Box.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually the X-box has an 8Gb hard disk (~50,000 blocks of memory) for<br/>
internal storage, so it isn&#39;t necessary to buy the memory cards for the<br/>
controller(s) unless you want to take your saved games to a friend&#39;s house<br/>
and play there.  There are some times when this would be nice, like with<br/>
Halo, where your character has certain level limitations based on your<br/>
experience, so starting a new character isn&#39;t optimal.<br/>
<br/>
We have a PS1, PS2, Dreamcast and X-box (and a gameboy advance<br/>
but that&#39;s a whole different realm). We use the X-box more than<br/>
anything else.  We&#39;ve rented the gamecube and it didn&#39;t motivate a quick<br/>
purchase.  If your children are under 10 and you aren&#39;t planning to play a<br/>
lot,<br/>
I&#39;d say PS2 is probably the best value because of the many child-oriented<br/>
games.<br/>
<br/>
For older kids and adults the X-box has a noticeable edge, but it will<br/>
probably<br/>
become overwhelming within a year or so when Microsoft releases and<br/>
mass markets it&#39;s broadband, real-time, internet gaming and another hundred<br/>
titles or so.  X-box is the only High Definition compatible gaming console,<br/>
and it has a built in cable modem along with the built in hard disk.  It<br/>
also<br/>
serves as a DVD movie player like the PS2.<br/>
<br/>
There are plenty of sites on the web that compare features and games - these<br/>
can help you decide - check out your favorite search engine.</div>
