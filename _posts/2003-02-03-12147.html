<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531528452">&lt;&lt;In some school<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;districts, 20 percent of the students are medicated,<br/>
&gt;lining up each day at the<br/>
&gt;nurse&#39;s office to receive their midday dose.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is so sad.  Sounds like years ago when I worked for a short time in a <br/>
mental institution and the residents/patients would line up for medications.<br/>
