And then  asked does it take coal or can<br/>
you use wood in the stove?   <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wood.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve never lived when or where people burned coal.  I suppose I&#39;ve  lived <br/>
where, kind of, but not when.  I&#39;ve never seen or smelled a coal  fire.  I have <br/>
seen a couple of long-abandoned coal bins in old houses in  New Mexico.  <br/>

&quot;Here,  the voice belongs to a disaffected 16-year-old, Jason Block, <br/>
who decides  to invent a new religion with a new god--the town&#39;s water <br/>
tower. Finding  converts is surprisingly easy. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Brett (one of the unschoolers who&#39;s grown up knowing my kids all along) had  <br/>
a religion five or six years ago.  It had rules he would amend  periodically.  <br/>
Holly was thrilled (and also eight or nine) when they let  her &quot;join their <br/>
religion.&quot;  She took it nearly seriously.  The rest  knew it was a total goof.<br/>
 <br/>
There was a little cult that existed only at certain summer campouts, too,  <br/>
called &quot;The Spoonies&quot; and they all carried wooden spoons, and if our friend <br/>
Anne  came by they all pulled them out and held them upright and said &quot;I have my  <br/>
spoon!&quot;   It had started with a need for wooden spoons in a big shared  camp <br/>
once, and somehow evolved.   One of those spoonie-spoons  (Marty&#39;s) is in our <br/>
drawer right now.  <br/>
 <br/>
In AA, for the benefit of those without formal religious belief (when my  mom <br/>
was going years back), they used to say (might still do some  places)...   In <br/>
AA they used to say that you could define whatever you  wanted as your <br/>
&quot;higher power,&quot; even if it was a fence post.  You just  needed a point of focus.<br/>
 <br/>
If you think of it that way, I think some people unconsciously worship  <br/>
job-advancement, money, or formal education.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ohhh yes...definately.  That recent unschool basher who was on this <br/>
list would fall into the latter category.  My parents would as <br/>
well.  If they have any real religious ferver it&#39;s always been for <br/>
education, college in particular but formal education in general and <br/>
knowledge overall, most particularly if it comes with a formal <br/>
degree or other certification attached.  Ironically, as they age <br/>
(their in their 70s now) they are changing radically.  My father, <br/>
former school board member and educational Abraham who literally <br/>
sacrificed us on the altar of his educational beliefs, actually said <br/>
to me &quot;I wish your brother would homeschool their kids too, like you <br/>
are doing.  Your boys are so happy and they don&#39;t have the social <br/>
and other problems his girls are having in school.&quot;  Which is as <br/>
close to saying &quot;I was wrong to scoff and deride your homeschooling <br/>
choices initially&quot; as he&#39;ll ever get.  Wonders never cease.<br/>

That is a big one!<br/>
When Keith&#39;s mom included a line in the middle of a letter saying we had  <br/>
done a good job, I photocopied it, circled it and put it on the wall for a  year!<br/>

Tell the  grandparents its a temporary schedule change, not a permanent one.  <br/>
(As  you and the kids wish.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t buy them with promises.  You could say &quot;Might be temporary&quot;  or <br/>
&quot;at least until fall.&quot;  That way you don&#39;t have to figure out a way to  get out <br/>
of it AGAIN.<br/>
