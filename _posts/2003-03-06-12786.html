<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; People in Saskatchewan were very friendly.  I had a way better time than I<br/>
&gt; thought i would have.  I was afraid I&#39;d be all alone surrounded by strangers,<br/>
&gt; but it never felt that way from the moment I saw Ian and Barbie at the<br/>
&gt; airport.<br/>
