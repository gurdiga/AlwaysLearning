&gt; A complaint about this group?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Man.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These people are unschooling real kids and still have enough time to<br/>
&gt; complain about THIS group?  Sheesh.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I didn&#39;t complain about anything today until just now. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We found a moth we&#39;ve never seen before and we&#39;re trying to identify her.<br/>
&gt;  We pulled up big radishes today and picked the first peas from our<br/>
&gt; little garden.  I have too many zucchini and will have to sneak around<br/>
&gt; the neighborhood tonight in my jammies leaving unwanted squashes on the<br/>
&gt; neighbor&#39;s door steps.   We practiced a Christmas duet on the piano. (We<br/>
&gt; should have started in January.&lt;G&gt;)   We found some inner tubes to take<br/>
&gt; to the lake on Tuesday.   We saw ten Killdeer at the river and four<br/>
&gt; Spotted Sandpipers.<br/>
&gt; A Hummingbird landed on Dylan&#39;s arm.  We&#39;re starting the new Harry Potter<br/>
&gt; book tonight.  It was 93 degrees here today and it&#39;s supposed to be<br/>
&gt; hotter tomorrow.  (should make that zucchini grow!)  AND I like this<br/>
&gt; list. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sorry you had a bummer moment Ren.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1460925986">I am complaining!!!! &#39;cause I have no garden. I live<br/>
in rocks.. I love rocks, but want a garden. I want too<br/>
many zucchini.  I am a newbie and I love this list. I<br/>
love to hear of the purest form of unschooling and<br/>
then I will move forward and do whatever the hell I<br/>
want, as usual..Except grow zucchinni,, NEXT<br/>
SUMMER&gt;&gt;&gt;I am still deschooling my daughter.She is<br/>
nearly 14 and a company girl.. I am hoping for a<br/>
learner not a hoop jumper.. I want a wand or a twitchy<br/>
nose , like Samantha. And poof we will lean into it..<br/>
My other five love it are learning and thriving and<br/>
exploring.Each day I marvel at their insights and<br/>
adventure.<br/>
My theory is follow Thumpers Dads advice ... Was it if<br/>
you can&#39;t say anything nice say nothing at all.. and<br/>
for crying out loud do not go be backstabbing sneaks<br/>
and say it to someone else.. I hate that... KAY thanks<br/>
I am tired now.. My puppy just ate my daughters thongs<br/>
... She is gonna be mad... <br/>
Once again thank for all the inspiration and giggles.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1690271181">***I usually shred it for bread, zucchini bread, ***<br/>
<br/>
I do shred some and freeze it.  It&#39;s watery but works ok in muffins and<br/>
such. <br/>
<br/>
I make zucchini patties with tofu and cornmeal and grated carrots, too. <br/>
<br/>
But when my family starts giving me that look that says &quot;you bring one<br/>
more zucchini into this house and we&#39;ll club you with it&quot;   I start<br/>
giving them away. &lt;G&gt; (the zucchini, not the family)  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-945748149">I love baby zuchinni.  Try to pick them when they are no longer than 6 inches.  Good raw, or grilled/steamed/BBQd whole.  If you really have a lot of small ones, you might find a local gourmet grocery store to sell them to.  Baby vegetables are tres chic...<br/>
<br/>
When we find a giant zuchinni, which happens too often because they really get away from you, we slice it in big rounds, BBQ it with sauce, and eat it on a burger bun with grilled onions, good cheese, and sometimes even a burger patty!<br/>
