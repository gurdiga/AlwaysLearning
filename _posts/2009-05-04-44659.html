I linked it here because I can remember this:<br/>

They say there are 200,000 unschoolers in the U.S. (I think they&#39;re  <br/>
talking U.S.).  Interesting, and it doesn&#39;t surprise me as high or  <br/>
low, but I do wonder where it might&#39;ve come from (that number).  It  <br/>
came from plotting a curve with percentages from something Pat Farenga  <br/>
said a few years ago, but still...<br/>

It was such a last minute thing. The author was very patient with me after asking a couple weeks ago, but her deadline was looming so I finally answered her questions just last night...it was late and I was tired. Wasn&#39;t sure if I was making sense or not.;)<br/>
