The principle is to be guided by their interests not to override  <br/>
theirs with your agenda. Many beginning unschoolers override their  <br/>
kids interests with schoolish things. You&#39;re trying to override your  <br/>
kids interests with anti-(overtly)educational things ;-)<br/>

If they&#39;re enjoying it, yes, of course.<br/>

If they&#39;re liking it and you&#39;re doing it for fun, and if you&#39;re willing to turn it off if they&#39;re tired of it, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
My kids liked storytelling tapes, too, in the days of CD tapes in cars. :-)  And Raffi.  <br/>

Will look at more CDs like the phonics one but maybe mix in some story&#39;s and see what other kids listen to music wise. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-70634467">Our family loves audio learning.  Many libraries have what is called<br/>
&#39;full-cast&#39; readings of popular novels, like the Lemony Snicket series,<br/>
meaning that they have voice actors reading the parts of the characters in<br/>
the book.  My mother in law got hooked on Junie B Jones that way!  There<br/>
are also tons of online radio shows that can be downloaded and we have<br/>
gotten a lot of enjoyment from the ZBS foundation shows, including Cactus<br/>
Kapoor and Ruby the Galactic Gumshoe.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.zbs.org/catalog/">http://www.zbs.org/catalog/</a><br/>
<br/>
These are all fun and entertaining and your kids will learn to listen<br/>
intently.  There are also lecture series and the like at libraries.  If my<br/>
kids asked for that sort of thing (they loved schoolhouse rock) then I<br/>
checked it out for them, but it would be their idea.  I am just the<br/>
facilitator.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>With great power comes great responsibility. :-) So make it your  <br/>
responsibility -- your joy really! :-) -- to use the greater power of  <br/>
your knowledge of the world to share things you believe they&#39;ll love.<br/>
<br/>
They can tell you what they like and don&#39;t like. But their ability to  <br/>
tell you what they want is limited by their knowledge of the world. So  <br/>
even if you stepped entirely back to give them full freedom to decide  <br/>
what they wanted to hear -- which no unschooling parent should be  <br/>
doing! -- the pool of ideas they have to draw from is very very  <br/>
limited. It&#39;s up to you to tap into what they enjoy and provide more  <br/>
of that. It&#39;s up to you to get to know them better so you can more  <br/>
effectively narrow down the world of choices to what you believe will  <br/>
delight them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1532320021">My 6 & 4 year olds love to listen to Beatrix Potter stories on CD, music from the Putumayo series, but also my music, not that my collection is large or even up to date. But I really enjoy playing my favourite songs for them, and listening to them discover songs they particularly like (The Lion Sleeps Tonight is a big hit at our house!) We bounce along in the car all singing away - great fun.<br/>

Parents should have ideas, too.  It&#39;s not much of a friendship when one friend gets all the ideas and the other is &quot;just&quot; something.  It&#39;s not much of a partnership when one partner isn&#39;t allowed to initiate anything.<br/>

Schoolhouse Rock is fun, but older parents are more likely to know about it than younger parents or children.  It&#39;s okay to introduce it, as long as it&#39;s not &quot;required&quot; or forced on a child as an educational thing, but is just fun for its own sake.<br/>

Then it would be good to look at what the kids like about them - maybe they&#39;d like some blocks or magnets or marble runs or games and the manipulatives do some of what they want but could be expanded upon in a dozen other ways that don&#39;t &quot;look&quot; quite so educational. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Maybe you are, maybe not. What do they like about that music, those songs? A lot of times, kids like music that&#39;s simple and sing-able, so that may be the bulk of the appeal, so its worth exploring other music which is simple and easy to sing. Old Woodie Guthrie kids&#39; songs come to mind, and Rafi, and nursery rhymes set to music. <br/>

I don&#39;t have a Sirius account at the moment, but Pandora is free, and I see they have a &quot;family&quot; section which has sub-categories of Toddler, Lullabye, Folk, and Kids&#39; Indie (oooh, They Might be Giants!). <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Legos are a specific thing and &quot;math manipulatives&quot; is a big category of<br/>
lots of things. If you named specific ones, I would say the same thing<br/>
about them as Lego. My family LOVED pattern blocks and so I bought several<br/>
sets and invested in the really nice wooden ones. I also bought magnetic<br/>
ones and fraction pattern blocks.  Those are &quot;math manipulatives&quot; - at<br/>
least that&#39;s how they are sold.<br/>
<br/>
We also had geoboards - lots of fun with those. Cuisenaire rods are cool<br/>
because of the relationships between the rods - the kids played with them<br/>
sometimes in various ways. Dice are &quot;math manipulatives&quot; that schools<br/>
sometimes call &quot;number cubes&quot; &lt;G&gt; and we have zillions of them...I have<br/>
little teensy ones and eraser ones and ones that have one die inside<br/>
another one and, of course, there are all the different &quot;sided&quot; ones and so<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
My kids also liked the math wrap-ups -- these are really intended to drill<br/>
kids on math facts, but they are set up like interesting hands-on puzzles<br/>
and my kids not only liked the store-bought ones, they made their own based<br/>
on things like &quot;characters in the Redwall books.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It bothers me that unschoolers are actually &quot;anti&quot; school supplies to the<br/>
point of avoiding them. When I go in school supply stores or look at their<br/>
websites, I look for the cool stuff. It is harder to find these days - in<br/>
the late 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s school supply stores were filled with cool<br/>
math and science and literature stuff...those were the days of &quot;whole<br/>
language&quot; and &quot;constructivist mathematics&quot; and &quot;hands-on science&quot; and<br/>
&quot;authentic assessment&quot; (that last means not doing paper and pencil tests).<br/>
<br/>
Yes, be careful not to think math manipulatives are better than Legos or<br/>
blocks just because they are sold in school supply stores. But don&#39;t throw<br/>
them out because of it either.<br/>
<br/>
So - for the cd&#39;s, it isn&#39;t that they are educational that matters, it is<br/>
what kind of music, rhythms, rhymes, lyrics, voices, instruments, etc.,<br/>
that the kids like that matters. If there are more of that style, get those<br/>
- don&#39;t worry about whether they are considered &quot;educational&quot; or not.<br/>
<br/>
Same with computer games, if they are fun, get more like them. My kids<br/>
liked the &quot;Mighty Math&quot; series of computer games...so I got more of those.<br/>
Yes, they are intended for an educator market...they have weird<br/>
capabilities of tracking what level of math the kids are doing. We ignored<br/>
that and they loved playing the games. Same with The Logical Journey of the<br/>
Zoombinis and Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego and Reading Rabbit and<br/>
Math Workshop and on and on.<br/>

words forced) their child to do something that wasn&#39;t needed to say, save<br/>
their life (if my child needed insulin and refused it, there would be<br/>
forcing used).  My children were always very self possessed and so forcing<br/>
them into something would have been far more work than it would probably<br/>
been worth.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and it seems weird to be an &quot;older&quot; parent, but I guess since I am<br/>
looking down the barrel of &#39;45&#39;, that would make me older.... LOL<br/>
