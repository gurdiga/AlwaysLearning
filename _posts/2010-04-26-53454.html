<div id="ygrps-yiv-494408599">I just started unschooling (I don&#39;t even think we are to the &quot;radical&quot; parts yet) so the WHY is still fresh in my mind.<br/>
 <br/>
The decision was made because of ME, not THEM (my girls.)  The yelling, cajoling, demanding, bribing, etc was not working to get the desired result.  (I assume all of you would agree that eye rolling and begrudging obedience is NOT anyone&#39;s &quot;desired result.&quot;)<br/>
 <br/>
I didn&#39;t like the person I was turning into when I was trying to turn them into the people I wanted them to be.  So, after hearing about (but not seeing) the GMA segment and doing some research (I had heard about unschooling but not actually looked into making it our choice) I decided that it couldn&#39;t do any more damage than I was doing.<br/>
 <br/>
It is amazing how much more peaceful things are around here.  After just one week of saying &quot;Yes&quot; more and not trying to turn the girls into little robots who read on cue and math on cue, etc, we are all happier.<br/>
<br/>
I can see the education still taking place as I approach how we spend the day from a place of peace rather than stress.<br/>

If you see it as learning rather than education it will be even better!<br/>
