<div id="ygrps-yiv-2056316526">Tonight I was reading Calvin and Hobbes and was struck by the fact that most of the strip involved Calvin dealing with the misery of school, bedtimes, dinnertime, and angry, manipulative parents. I couldn&#39;t help but see it through unschooling glasses and decided to read up a little on the creator Bill Watterson. I found an interview and read this:<br/>
<br/>
Interviewer: What attributes do you wish were seen more commonly among children?<br/>
Bill Watterson: Good parents!<br/>
<br/>
What a great answer.</div>
