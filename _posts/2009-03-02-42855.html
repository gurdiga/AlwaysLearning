<div id="ygrps-yiv-1716198046">Hi, I finally signed up for this list and I&#39;ll introduce myself soon. <br/>
But I have a pressing question I need to discuss first.<br/>
<br/>
I am so shaken up right now. I just learned this morning that a young <br/>
(7yo) boy was molested, at knife point, at our local municipal building <br/>
two days ago. This is the building that houses our library (aka our <br/>
home-away-from-home). It is also the building which houses the police <br/>
department. Safe, right?<br/>
<br/>
My parenting style is...well...you can probably deduce just from my <br/>
presence in this group that I trust my kids to lead and show when they <br/>
are ready to handle new challenges. Things like exercising independence. <br/>
My eldest is a very emotionally precocious and responsible 5. Two weeks <br/>
ago I got read the riot act by a volunteer at our local community center <br/>
for having let him &quot;run around&quot; unattended. What I *had* done was show <br/>
him around the building, explain the boundaries that I wanted him to <br/>
observe, introduce him to the staff on duty, and walk him to the <br/>
restroom. When he expressed a desire to &quot;do it himself&quot;, I reminded him <br/>
of where I would be--at the other end of a short and open hallway. And I <br/>
left him to navigate his way back, which he did promptly and without <br/>
incident. He handled himself appropriately, and I praised him for his <br/>
maturity.<br/>
<br/>
The tongue-lashing I got from the volunteer later (he watched for us and <br/>
accosted me on our way out the door) threw me. On one hand, I know what <br/>
my child is able to handle and fully trusted him. On the other hand, I <br/>
realize that he is very young and less likely than an older child to be <br/>
able to protect himself and more likely to raise suspicion from <br/>
onlookers. I was unsettled for quite a while, not sure whether I thought <br/>
the man was a grouchy old fuddy-duddy or I was an irresponsible parent. <br/>
Or neither.<br/>
<br/>
Now I am smacked in the face with a reminder of how we can&#39;t trust even <br/>
the familiar, safe, known places to be free from threat. My son is more <br/>
familiar with the library than with Grandma&#39;s house, and is completely <br/>
comfortable there. I like that comfort. I like that he has the <br/>
confidence to navigate the building on his own. And suddenly, I am <br/>
terrified that a knife-wielding pedophile is going to attack him the <br/>
second he is out of my direct line of sight.<br/>
<br/>
I guess what has my mind churning right now is...how do you strike a <br/>
balance between encouraging your child&#39;s independence and recognizing <br/>
their maturity level...and just plain protecting them from the Big Bad <br/>
World? As a mother reading that news story, I feel compelled to hover. <br/>
As a mother who wants to preserve my children&#39;s confidence, I am afraid <br/>
that too much hovering will do them a disservice. I suppose it&#39;s really <br/>
a matter of striking a healthy balance. I&#39;m not sure how or if I will <br/>
recognize that.<br/>
<br/>
I do not yet fully trust either my child or the world enough to leave <br/>
him completely on his own in public situations, but I do &quot;allow&quot; him (by <br/>
virtue of trust and not-overly-hovering) more liberty than many of his <br/>
age-peers. I am finding it difficult to reconcile this desire to honor <br/>
his independence with my duty (and biological imperative) to protect him.<br/>
<br/>
I would be very interested in hearing others&#39; views on this.<br/>
<br/>
TIA,<br/>
Heather</div>

<br/>
How many five year olds walk to school, or from one place to another  <br/>
at school?  Maybe not &quot;on their own&quot; completely, but without their moms.<br/>
<br/>
How many of those who are sexually assaulted are 18?  21?  30?    <br/>
LOTS.   Tons.    Age isn&#39;t magic.<br/>
<br/>

Or neither.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Did you talk to the librarian?  Maybe you should.  Just to express  <br/>
your frustration about that day.  Maybe the library has a specific  <br/>
policy you violated, and maybe not.  Volunteers aren&#39;t authorized to  <br/>
pull policies out of their asses, though.  Maybe he overstepped and  <br/>
maybe he didn&#39;t.  And I don&#39;t think you should mention the assault if  <br/>
you talk about it; that&#39;s a separate thing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You can&#39;t child-proof the world.  It&#39;s better to world-proof your  <br/>
child, in small ways.  We always told Holly if someone grabbed her to  <br/>
scream so loud he would let her go.  No molester is going to stab a  <br/>
child for screaming (not if he&#39;s in a building where other people are,  <br/>
anyway).  He&#39;ll run like crazy if the kid&#39;s as loud as Holly was when  <br/>
she was little.<br/>
<br/>
Being alert and having a Plan B is about as much as anyone can do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1501154928">original poster here, just with a further thought...<br/>
<br/>
I realize that I have to do some &quot;stranger danger&quot; talks. Frankly,<br/>
I&#39;ve been avoiding them because it&#39;s hard to do it without being<br/>
overly scary. I remember my parents--my dad especially--basically<br/>
drilling it into our heads that all strangers are potential attackers.<br/>
He was constantly telling me to kick, bite, and taught me (in theory!)<br/>
how to gouge out someone&#39;s eyes. I looked at *everyone* as a predator.<br/>
ALL men wanted to harm me. I grew up very anxious. <br/>
<br/>
I do not want my kids to grow up in fear, or mistrusting everyone. I<br/>
think that overall most people ARE kind...or at least nonthreatening.<br/>
And it feels hypocritical to tell the kids &quot;don&#39;t talk to strangers&quot;<br/>
and then they see me saying hi to random people, like at the park. &quot;Do<br/>
you know that man, Mommy?&quot; Well, no, I&#39;m just being friendly. I&#39;ve<br/>
always been more like, &quot;It&#39;s okay, you can say hi to the checkout<br/>
lady&quot; and &quot;Strangers are just friends you haven&#39;t met yet&quot;...I want<br/>
them to believe in the goodness of humanity, not to be terrified<br/>
little xenophobes!<br/>
<br/>
So I guess that&#39;s part of what&#39;s troubling me. Figuring out how to<br/>
world-proof them without going too far. Teaching them caution without<br/>
giving them fear.</div>

&gt; balance between encouraging your child&#39;s independence and recognizing<br/>
&gt; their maturity level...and just plain protecting them from the Big Bad<br/>
&gt; World?&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have said to Jayn in asking her to change her behavior in public places, <br/>
that while I know that she is ok or safe or careful or whatever, that others <br/>
who see her don&#39;t know her and might be alarmed and speak to her harshly. I <br/>
guess in this case the person spoke to you harshly.<br/>
<br/>
If there is someone targeting youngsters they will probably be looking for <br/>
ones that seem alone and unsupervised, and maybe seem lost or quiet. I like <br/>
Sandra&#39;s suggestion of clarifying the policies, but I wonder if there is a <br/>
way that you could &quot;split the difference&quot; between the distance you are <br/>
keeping now, and hovering right on top of him or not letting him explore. <br/>
Show anyone observing that you are connected and aware of him.<br/>
<br/>
When Jayn was little we did tell her that there were people who sometimes <br/>
stole children, that an adult who needed help of any kind - like directions <br/>
or a lost puppy - should be asking a parent and that if anyone who invited <br/>
her to go anywhere with them, she should run and check with me or Daddy.<br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling that all the staff at the library and community center will <br/>
likely be on edge for a while, especially until the predator is caught.<br/>
<br/>
I would encourage you to describe the world as big and beautiful and <br/>
interesting as much as you can instead of bad and scary. There are parts of <br/>
the world where there is a culture of violence and poverty and sometime <br/>
hopelessness. I hope that few or none of us live in those parts of the <br/>
world.<br/>
