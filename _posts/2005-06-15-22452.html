<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think my topic/question got hijacked by a (ahem)<br/>
confused person, to put it nicely.  A lot of it was<br/>
fascinating stuff regarding reading and learning,<br/>
mostly what came from other folks on the list, not<br/>
so...disturbed.<br/>
<br/>
To get back on track for my own dilema, the above<br/>
quote (sorry I didn&#39;t get who said it) is where I am<br/>
having difficulty at this time.  The question about<br/>
the library program was an outgrowth of what I now<br/>
realize is more an issue of finding things to do in<br/>
general.  It&#39;s not so much availability or access, as<br/>
we can make that happen despite not living &quot;in town&quot;<br/>
as I&#39;m sure others here who live in the country can<br/>
attest.  The problem I am running into is lack of<br/>
interest from the kids.  They both hate or are<br/>
adversely affected by crowds and busy/overstimulating<br/>
environments.  More than 8 people makes them squirmily<br/>
uncomfortable, just because of personality/temperment<br/>
and other factors.  We have not always lived out of<br/>
town, and they have been around malls, fairs, and<br/>
other public events/places plenty of times.  They are<br/>
not uncomfortable due to lack of crowd experience,<br/>
they just don&#39;t like it very often or for very long. <br/>
They will make exceptions to spend an hour or two at a<br/>
fair for example, but then they are done and want to<br/>
go someplace quiet.  They can handle anonymity in a<br/>
large crowd better than they handle a group of 10 or<br/>
30 as well.<br/>
<br/>
Both my boys dislike class type settings, taking<br/>
&quot;direction&quot; and so forth.  Even when we play board<br/>
games at home we usually toss the rules and make up<br/>
our own.  They love fantasy play, athletic games but<br/>
not &quot;sports&quot; per se, making art, watching movies,<br/>
cooking, books, games, music, dance, puzzles, their<br/>
trampoline, water play, the beach, the park, camping<br/>
and other things.  The trouble is that I have yet to<br/>
match up any of these things with any activities, or<br/>
to offer things that may expand their world/interests<br/>
in which they have shown the least bit of interest.<br/>
<br/>
At this time the only thing they are interested in is<br/>
1-2 dates a week to get together and play with a<br/>
friend or two at home or elsewhere and a weekly<br/>
library trip.  They are happy to stay home the rest of<br/>
the time, playing inside and outside with us and each<br/>
other.  They don&#39;t see any neighbors as we are in the<br/>
middle of a forest and our driveway is nearly a mile<br/>
through the woods to a dead end private road.  They<br/>
have said they want more friends, which I am trying to<br/>
facilitate, but it&#39;s hard to meet families when we&#39;re<br/>
home so much.  They have hinted at wanting more stuff<br/>
to do but shown no interest in what&#39;s been offered. <br/>
I&#39;m worried that I am not offering enough, or the<br/>
right things, or falling down on the job as a<br/>
homeschooling/unschooling parent and could use some<br/>
encouragement here.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe my problem is that my kids just seem emotionally<br/>
young, compared to other kids (schooled kids?)  Should<br/>
I just shut up and be happy that they are still so<br/>
young at heart and their needs are so uncomplicated?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Marty hates  it.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not precisely.  Hubby and I don&#39;t care for those much either and <br/>
it&#39;s likely our opinions are either genetically or environmentally <br/>
influencing the boys.  I guess I mean activities outside of home, <br/>
where they can meet and interact with other kids and with adults who <br/>
are not us.  Fun things for them to try and places to check out.  I <br/>
am not trying to get rid of them or wanting to spend less time with <br/>
them, just concerned that they don&#39;t see much of others.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; These things expand their world and interests:<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah...I can hear that in their expanding questions and discussions <br/>
with us.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Your kids are happy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>OK, deep breathing.  I do know this, about overscheduled kids, and I <br/>
hear from friends who visit (kids *and* their parents) about how <br/>
lovely, quiet, fun, interesting, fill-in-the-positive-blank our <br/>
woods are compared to town.  I should just make &quot;They are Happy&quot; my <br/>
mantra I guess, to remind me where to focus.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Bring in more movies, food to cook, new music, more puzzles, new <br/>
 </span></blockquote>water play  equipment and different beaches.<br/>
<br/>
Actually we do all of this regularly, but I didn&#39;t think of it as <br/>
expanding their horizons.  We just got new art supplies, 6 new <br/>
puzzles, tried some new recipes, got some new music, and borrowed <br/>
some cool movies/shows from the library this week.  I guess more of <br/>
the same is in order is what they are telling me.<br/>
<br/>

here of course, where it belongs.  I don&#39;t burden the kids with my <br/>
baggage, or I try not to anyway.  I gotta get off the computer now <br/>
though, because one of my boys just discovered a passion for <br/>
cartooning and wants me to write the dialogue for the comic book <br/>
he&#39;s making for his dad for Father&#39;s Day, and the other game loving <br/>
son is helping me design a roughly Clue based game for Daddy called <br/>
Pirate Treasure and I need to make cards and game pieces and stuff <br/>
with him now that we have basic game play worked out.  Plus I have a <br/>
pile of books on bigfoot to read to a newly obsessed child and a <br/>
camping trip to plan somewhere closeby to &quot;look for Bigfoot.&quot;<br/>

They<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; have said they want more friends, which I am trying to<br/>

&gt; home so much.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your kids sound a lot like mine.  Most of the time they are content to do<br/>
the at-home things we do all the time.  For us, its board games, reading to<br/>
them, riding our horse and hanging out at the barn, swimming in the pool,<br/>
playing on the computer, watching TV, etc.  But once in a while they seem a<br/>
bit restless and in need of more interaction with other kids.  <br/>
<br/>
In the past I have arranged play dates via a local home school list.  I have<br/>
organized wiffle ball games and it worked out well because only a handful of<br/>
kids came and that was the perfect amount for us.  Is there some interest<br/>
that they have that you can use to help them meet other kids with similar<br/>
interests?  Or maybe ask if there are kids out there on a local homeschool<br/>
list of similar ages who might like to come jump on your trampoline or<br/>
something like that.  It can be hard (outside my comfort level) to reach out<br/>
to others sometimes but I have always been glad that we made the effort when<br/>
we did, even if it didn&#39;t work out that we made a new friend each time.  If<br/>
the kids seem to want to meet some new friends, I remind them that once upon<br/>
a time the friends they have now were strangers and if we hadn&#39;t made the<br/>
effort to get to know them, we would have missed out on a great friendship. <br/>
<br/>
The most recent friends my kids have made are kids who ride at the barn we<br/>
board at.  They are both public schooled kids but they all share an interest<br/>
in horses and that is what matters to the kids.  We have the flexibility to<br/>
work around their school schedules and get together when it works for them.<br/>
And summer vacation starts this week so we should be able to see them more,<br/>
very soon.<br/>
<br/>
For the last year or so my kids were content with having one close friend.<br/>
I sometimes felt like it would benefit them to make more friends and branch<br/>
out a little bit but that was my concern and not theirs.  In their own time<br/>
they eventually found the need to branch out and make more friends.  I am<br/>
wondering if the need for more friends is truly theirs or is it something<br/>
that you are feeling that they would benefit from?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; They will make exceptions to spend an hour or two at a<br/>

&gt; large crowd better than they handle a group of 10 or<br/>
&gt; 30 as well.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My kids are also like that.  They can handle a fair much better than a<br/>
birthday party with a dozen kids with expectations that they participate.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Both my boys dislike class type settings, taking<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s awesome and creative.<br/>
<br/>
  They love fantasy play, athletic games but<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; not &quot;sports&quot; per se, making art, watching movies,<br/>
&gt; cooking, books, games, music, dance, puzzles, their<br/>
&gt; trampoline, water play, the beach, the park, camping<br/>
&gt; and other things.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not everyone is cut out for organized sports but as long as they feel their<br/>
life is rich and rewarding, that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
  The trouble is that I have yet to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; match up any of these things with any activities, or<br/>
&gt; to offer things that may expand their world/interests<br/>
&gt; in which they have shown the least bit of interest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But you don&#39;t need to do organized things.  It might make you look like a<br/>
better homeschool mom to outsiders if your kids were involved in lots of<br/>
outside activities, but it isn&#39;t necessarily what will make your kids happy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I&#39;m worried that I am not offering enough, or the<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would continue to offer things that you think might interest them and be<br/>
prepared to accept a &quot;no&quot; if that is how they feel.  I felt the same way<br/>
myself for a long time and then I offered horse back riding lessons and that<br/>
was the beginning of a new found interest/love for all of us.  It&#39;s been an<br/>
amazing ride.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe my problem is that my kids just seem emotionally<br/>
&gt; young, compared to other kids (schooled kids?)  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So do mine.  Isn&#39;t it great that they can be at whatever emotional level<br/>
they are naturally without feeling the need to keep up with other kids their<br/>
age?<br/>
<br/>
Should<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I just shut up and be happy that they are still so<br/>
&gt; young at heart and their needs are so uncomplicated?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think being happy that your kids are happy is a good idea.  No need to<br/>
worry if they are happy and content.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-286140992">My ds is 15 and only likes groups of 2 or 3, he gets it from his Nana. lol  We have found 2 other guys his age and they bowl, have book discussions, play Magic, have LAN parties, talk on AIM, they went to a homeschool prom.  This has worked out great and I think they may end up life long friends who can depend on each other and that is very important to have someone who you can talk to and lean on if need be.  I never put him in a class situation that just does not work with him.  He also likes to be with people who are older than he is.  I think because he is not so into the &quot;teenage&quot; thing.  He thinks its silly.<br/>
 <br/>
Also I have learned to listen to my ds and I don&#39;t mean just hear, I mean watch actions/expressions so on.  I can tell about 90% of the time when he is not comfortable and does not want to be, go or stay somewhere and I try to respect that.  It is hard because I am a control freak and I think things should be my way because that is best,  I am learning to let that go.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t know if this helps, but I just thought I would through it in.<br/>

<br/>
This was another post where I kept waiting for the problem to be revealed.<br/>
All I saw was that they are hoping for some more friends, but it didn&#39;t<br/>
sound like a scenario of desperate urgency. You are supporting your<br/>
children&#39;s needs and individual preferences, by your own description. <br/>
<br/>
Life can be allowed to be simple and good and free of drama, without us<br/>
having to create a fear of impending doom or wondering if it is too good to<br/>
be true. Every ointment doesn&#39;t have to contain flies. Time to start<br/>
trusting yourself, as you seem to already be trusting your kids. :) <br/>

and families for whom that kind of lifestyle works.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve not had good results from trying to meet people from our only <br/>
local homeschooling list, mainly because of lack of understanding, <br/>
patience or flexibility re: high functioning autism.  It makes me <br/>
very leery of that list.  I had thought about posting something on <br/>
the board at the county library as an option, and I have posted to a <br/>
local homeschooling register site with no results to speak of after <br/>
a couple of years.  I just accidentally found out about a group of <br/>
unschoolers meeting on Fridays at the gym of the town community <br/>
center to play and we&#39;re going to try that group next.  Hopefully <br/>
good things will come from that.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I am wondering if the need for more friends is truly theirs or is <br/>
&gt;it something that you are feeling that they would benefit from?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good question.  Well, Thomas (8.5) has specifically asked for more <br/>
friends recently.  He just met a little girl last weekend (one of <br/>
the Friday group at the community center) who he instantly fell in <br/>
love with though, so he&#39;s excited about that.  He keeps talking <br/>
about (sigh) Mahhd-ah-liine (the little girl, Madeline) in this sing <br/>
songey voice.  He&#39;s always been a sucker for girls.  <br/>
<br/>
Alex (7) I am concerned is getting really quirky because his <br/>
(almost) only friend and playmate is his autistic brother Thomas.  <br/>
He&#39;s picked up problem behaviors that we&#39;ve been trying to help his <br/>
brother to overcome, as well as typically autistic self soothing <br/>
stims like rocking, humming and hand flapping.  Alex also <br/>
specifically asks for breaks from his intense and often overbearing <br/>
brother.  When we go on playdates he often uses the time when Thomas <br/>
is playing with another child to go off on his own or to visit with <br/>
the adults.  I wonder if he would be more inclined to make friends <br/>
of his own, something he seems to have no interest in, if he didn&#39;t <br/>
feel such a pressing need to get a break from his brother.  He plays <br/>
well with other children, but doesn&#39;t ask for them, seems to be able <br/>
to take or leave them when they are there although he&#39;s eager to go <br/>
to playdates when we ask him.  In fact he is agreeable to any other <br/>
event or activity we ask him about but often doesn&#39;t like them after <br/>
he arrives.  I am processing as I write, and thinking that maybe <br/>
what&#39;s really going on is that Alex doesn&#39;t know what he wants right <br/>
now and just says yes to everything so that he can try it out and <br/>
see how it feels.  It&#39;s me that the uncertainty bothers.  It will be <br/>
intresting to see where he settles in his interests and social <br/>
proclivities.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not concerned with what others think or how I look to them.  <br/>
Just ask my long suffering extended family (haha)  :-P  I am mainly <br/>
trying to help them meet other people and saw the organized <br/>
activities as possible venues for that.  Even if we didn&#39;t stick <br/>
with them we might meet some cool people, Alex could maybe get a <br/>
break from Thomas and be involved in something that didn&#39;t concern <br/>
Thomas at all, which would be a relief to Alex I know, and Thomas <br/>
could meet more friends and take more focus away from his quietly <br/>
overwhelmed brother.  I think I am going to need to look for other <br/>
avenues though.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So do mine.  Isn&#39;t it great that they can be at whatever emotional <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes!  I love that they are free to be themselves and so confident.  <br/>
They don&#39;t worry about what people think of them or about fitting in <br/>
with the crowd.  They never express concern about being like or <br/>
unlike others.  I didn&#39;t mean it was a problem for me when I <br/>
said &quot;maybe the problem is&quot;  I meant maybe it was part of the <br/>
problem with finding things they would like to do or that suit <br/>
them.  <br/>

I&#39;m so very sorry Nanci, I sure didn&#39;t mean to minimize your concerns or<br/>
issues, although now I see that is how it came out. <br/>
<br/>
Far from intending that, I was trying to offer some praise and encourage to<br/>
you to appreciate yourself for all the good things you are clearly already<br/>
doing. Thanks for the gentle redirection of thought.<br/>
<br/>
I hope the new Unschooling group you found works out.<br/>
