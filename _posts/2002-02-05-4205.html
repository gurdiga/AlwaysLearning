<div id="ygrps-yiv-892522917">We eat dinner together every night. SOmetimes that&#39;s in a fast food place,<br/>
sometimes in front of the TV (pizza and movie nights) mostly at the table.<br/>
The kids are free to go elsewhere (and eat later or earlier) but due to<br/>
spillage problems in our home and white carpeting and a $300 cleaning bill<br/>
recently (for stairs and one room only!) we eat together at our table. We do<br/>
this because we really enjoy the 20 minutes or so of sit down, no<br/>
distractions, lots of conversation. The kids eat and then get up and go back<br/>
to whatever they are doing. We do the family dinners but it is far from<br/>
forced and they&#39;re fun for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069986014">OH! I forgot to mention that I really really like to cook. If I didn&#39;t we<br/>
probably wouldn&#39;t sit down together. On the days that I am tired and don&#39;t<br/>
feel like cooking, we eat whatever, wherever, whenever.<br/>
