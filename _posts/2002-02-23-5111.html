<div id="ygrps-yiv-867442041">I hope it&#39;s OK to ask this question here.  I think y&#39;all are much smarter<br/>
than Marilyn Vos Savant!  So here goes:<br/>
<br/>
I am the moderator for a yahoogroups list for my local homeschool group. <br/>
A woman who just subscribed said since she subscribed she began to<br/>
receive a lot of offensive junk e-mail.  She thinks it is related to her<br/>
joining the list.<br/>
<br/>
About two months ago, I also started to receive lots of junk e-mail<br/>
solicitations for viagra, earn money at home, and related subjects and<br/>
many of them do have subject headings that are not the sort of thing I<br/>
would choose to read about.  When I complained to dh, he said just delete<br/>
and forget about it.  So I have been, until I received the e-mail today<br/>
from the new list member.<br/>
<br/>
Has anybody else experienced this?  Do you think it could be related to<br/>
yahoogroups?  I am going to write to yahoo to ask if they know or can do<br/>
anything about this.  Any other suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; About two months ago, I also started to receive lots of junk e-mail<br/>
solicitations for viagra, earn money at home, and related subjects and<br/>
many of them do have subject headings that are not the sort of thing I<br/>
would choose to read about.  When I complained to dh, he said just delete<br/>
and forget about it.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I do when I open my e-mail is delete the solicitations to <br/>
borrow money or see farmgirls have sex with animals or to have a bigger <br/>
penis.  Then I read the rest of the mail.<br/>
<br/>
When I go to the physical mailbox in front of my house, first thing I do is <br/>
throw away things I really didn&#39;t want, and then I bring the &quot;real&quot; mail on <br/>
in the house.<br/>
<br/>
Similar with TV (I get up and pee, or eat, or feed the fire, or the cats <br/>
during commercials) and the newspaper (when I read it, I read very little of <br/>
it).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The way yahoogroups works is anybody can join any and every group.  And when <br/>
you&#39;ve joined you can see the list and you can get the e-mail, which comes <br/>
from addresses, and there they are.<br/>
<br/>
There are also random e-mail-address-generator machines, it seems, the same <br/>
way there are random phone-number dialers.   So there&#39;s no refuge.  Even <br/>
unlisted numbers get called by those machines.<br/>
<br/>
I think your husband&#39;s right.  Just figure out which ones not to read.<br/>
<br/>
And if and when you&#39;re sending e-mail to real friends, make it clear by the <br/>
subject line that you&#39;re not advertising for them to view the cam of people <br/>
enlarging their farm animals&#39; penises.<br/>
<br/>
People change their e-mail addresses sometimes to get rid of junkmail, but <br/>
it&#39;s not long before they&#39;re getting similar stuff at a new address.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a byproduct of being in a free country based very heavily on capitalism.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1495708112">You can say that again!  I recently changed my email address after having<br/>
the same one for 5 years (imagine how much spam I got in that amount of<br/>
time!).  It didn&#39;t take more than a week for me to be &quot;found&quot;, and I get<br/>
almost as much spam as before.<br/>

spam over the 4 years we&#39;ve been on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1185411527">I don&#39;t get any spam (probably that will change today)<br/>
on this yahoo addy.  We get lots on our provider addy<br/>
(ATT).  <br/>
<br/>
Do not respond to the the &quot;unsub reply click here&quot;<br/>
footnotes.  That merely confirms that you are a valid<br/>
address....and you&#39;ll get more!<br/>
<br/>
I used to trace the source for spam to be able to make<br/>
valid abuse complaints...lots came from foreign<br/>
origins.  China, area&#39;s of the Ukraine, northern<br/>
Africa, Russia, lots from Korea..... I downloaded<br/>
Cyrillic, Arabic, other scripts....was pretty<br/>
interesting for a while. Making complaints to the<br/>
foreign  service providers. Once got a map to an<br/>
office in downtown Moscow to the complaint office!<br/>
Then it got boring.  All the same. Spam. Sleaze is<br/>
sleaze is sleaze. <br/>
<br/>
If you play around with a turd, eventually some of it<br/>
will rub off. Now I just delete.<br/>
<br/>
Wonder if there are incripted messages in some of this<br/>
stuff that are subversive (besides the general<br/>
degenerate nature of it).  Maybe it is on the order of<br/>
pushing...to undermine the health of the general<br/>
population? Or like these bothersome viruses.  Just<br/>
ugly for ulgy&#39;s sake.  The same sort of ugly that<br/>
scratches stranger&#39;s parked vehicles.<br/>
<br/>
Beauty is only skin deep, but ugly goes clean to the<br/>
bone. And it is internationally pervasive....not<br/>
restricted to capitalists.<br/>

<br/>
You can join the groups which are lying out there open to join.  It&#39;s <br/>
possible to set groups up as closed or invitation only or secret or whatever.</div>
