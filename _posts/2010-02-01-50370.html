<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121673810">I have googled and looked at Sandra&#39;s site, I&#39;m not sure how else to find it.<br/>
I remember an article that I thought was titled *It&#39;s not the unschooling*<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about when challenges in life arise unschooling seems to get blamed but it&#39;s not the unschooling.<br/>
Anyone know what I&#39;m talking about?<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

If you lose it again, google Mary Gold and unschooling, or remember  <br/>
that I have a Mary Gold page.  Or just ask us again. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
