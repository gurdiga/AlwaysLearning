<div id="ygrps-yiv-757597645">OK, this durned Yankee stands corrected &lt;g&gt;.  I lived in Tennessee for 3+<br/>
years and didn&#39;t hear it there....maybe because most of my friends and<br/>
colleagues were also from out of state and I didn&#39;t notice it amongst the<br/>
natives...<br/>
<br/>
Though I did learn to understand a heavy southern drawl (a la Tom on<br/>
Survivor).  My roommate (from PA) would hand me the phone when our landlord<br/>
called.....she could never understand a word he said, lol.<br/>

I&#39;m up in the P&#39;cola area, where are you? You must be near the Everglades if <br/>
your name &quot;Sharon of the Swamp&quot; is a sign of geographical location!!!<br/>
I can vouch for the Coke/soda issue being a Southern thing.<br/>
If someone asks if you want a Coke you then tell them what kind (Dr. Pepper, <br/>
Pepsi etc...) No one says &quot;pop&quot; ....our former favorite word for the bubbly <br/>
stuff..... it&#39;s soda down here.  And that is any fizzy drink. <br/>
We got some really funny looks when asking for Pop our first year.<br/>
But then, I live in a place where people call their kids &quot;Bubba&quot; and &quot;Billy <br/>
Bob&quot;...????<br/>
People push buggies in the store, not carts.<br/>
They are always fixin&#39; to go somewhere, and the y&#39;all can be said more ways <br/>
than I ever would have guessed...as in, all y&#39;alls. Wow!  <br/>
My favorite saying is &quot;We&#39;re gonna be fried like pie&quot; on a really hot day.<br/>
These Southerners have a way with words, I&#39;m tellin&#39; ya.<br/>

the rural-New Mexicans (those speaking the Texas-sort-of-thing) who couldn&#39;t <br/>
understand one another.  I had to learn some vocabulary myself, though, in <br/>
addition to accent.   &quot;A film and a pie&quot; (as in pizza and a movie) was very <br/>
foreign.<br/>

Hi Ren<br/>
<br/>
I am about 30 miles NW of Jacksonville on the St.<br/>
Mary&#39;s river, which drains from the Okeefeenokee<br/>
Swamp. Yesterday Roy waded across the river, to<br/>
Georgia, without getting his shorts wet. It is that<br/>
warm, and, at least, right here, that shallow. Need<br/>
some REAL rain. The river is sometimes 20 to 40 feet<br/>
deeper....more down river.<br/>
<br/>
I used to live in between Crawfordville and Sopchoppy,<br/>
south of Tallahassee, with the Wildlife Refuge as my<br/>
back yard. That too, is a lot of swamp.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I just got a reminder from the school board about<br/>
evaluations and tests and such.  Do you have an open<br/>
minded qualified person to do your evaluation? Does<br/>
he/she charge and arm and a leg? <br/>
<br/>
DH is an Amtrak engineer and is in Pensacola more<br/>
often than at home, just now. Perhaps we could all<br/>
meet sometime.?  I have other friends who play a lot<br/>
of music in your area, they live in Tallahassee,<br/>
though. There are, also, a couple of quite active<br/>
bands of Muscogee Creek and Echota Tsalagi Indians.<br/>
Though I have mostly lost contact with folks over<br/>
there, in the last few years. <br/>
<br/>
Ya&#39;ll can reply off list, if&#39;n ya&#39;ll wanna.<br/>
<br/>
