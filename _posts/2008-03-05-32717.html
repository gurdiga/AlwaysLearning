 <br/>
Thank you very much for all the resources you provided. I have saved them and read most of them. I plan to keep going back to learn more, also I plan to check on some of them books mentioned at the library.<br/>
 <br/>
As for their counselors due to anxieties and some other personal issues I have not considered changing as of yet. They both have wonderful counselors, my concern was how does a single parent with no reliable income explain they are getting the experience that will teach them. I write that and it still sounds crazy to me. I know that over time they will gain knowledge of things on their own like I have read in so many articles. But putting it into words to another person seems to be hard for me to do, perhaps that is the main issue.<br/>
 <br/>
Actually my belief of natural learning is hard to be thought out because I seem to worry to much about the little things . I feel I have plenty of deschooling to still do. As far as coming across not confident enough etc, I am very bad for that and that is something I need to work on as well.<br/>
 <br/>
As for explaining to anyone how I intend to do things differently.  I did not mean to offend anyone and I wasn&#39;t wanting to come off that way. I just worry I may not have enough going on for them other then reading. My youngest don&#39;t care much for reading.  Honestly, I much rather do the natural learning, I see the difference already and it has only been a month since they have been out of public school. As I said I have a lot more deschooling, and growing to do I realize that.<br/>
 <br/>
Anyways, again if I offended anyone that was not my intention, and I apologize. Thank you again for your input. Off to read some more, take care.<br/>
 <br/>
P.S. Off Topic~ If I may ask, are you still active in the SCA? I have only been involved for about a year, so I have much to learn. But I am amazed with everything we have experienced. My girls learned Drumming, and my oldest loves to forge, belly dance etc. Anyways I was interested in knowing if your family ever travels to the Kingdom of Northsheild? <br/>
 <br/>
Thank you,<br/>
 <br/>

You can&#39;t rely on explaining it.  It will need to become evident.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. I know that over time they will gain knowledge of things on  <br/>
their own like I have read in so many articles. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not good enough for the long term.<br/>
It&#39;s a good start, but you need to know that they HAVE gained and ARE  <br/>
gaining knowledge, as they would have even if you had never read a  <br/>
single article.  And for that to happen, you can&#39;t just &quot;know&quot; but  <br/>
you need to be doing.<br/>
<br/>

feel like we&#39;re unsure.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re confident then you won&#39;t feel the need to convince him (and  <br/>
get his approval basically).<br/>
<br/>
I know that&#39;s easily said, but it&#39;s something to keep in mind:  <br/>
Getting to the point where you don&#39;t feel you need others to agree  <br/>
that you&#39;re doing right.<br/>
<br/>
You could gather a reading list and give it to the counselor if he  <br/>
wanted to find out more about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No one was offended :-) The help here is often in the form of trying  <br/>
to get people to see their lives through their children&#39;s eyes rather  <br/>
than the eyes of &quot;here&#39;s how things should be&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
So what does life look like through their eyes? Are they happy? Do  <br/>
they feel confident you&#39;re helping them get what they&#39;re reaching for?<br/>
