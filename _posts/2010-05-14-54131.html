<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145881818">I think in this setting there are a few things you could do.  First have you had a conversation with your mother (or whoever is saying no) about how you feel in regards to food for the kids.  Maybe you could just explain that your kids do fine with a small snack before dinner, simple as that.  also I think it&#39;s a great opportunity to discuss with the kids that people have different rules and when we are with them or living in their house then you need to follow those rules.  In life it&#39;s just a lesson learned that people believe different ways and although we don&#39;t have to agree we do need to respect that.  To me this seems like a great life lesson of respecting differences and confronting the rules we don&#39;t agree with.  Maybe it will work out that after a discussion your mother will be able to try and trust the kids and they will see that a respectful discussion can work to solve differences.  HTH<br/>
