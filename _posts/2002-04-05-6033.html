<div id="ygrps-yiv-675235410">Our support group got a phone call yesterday from an organization called <br/>
Teaching Tolerance, and they interviewed the leader about the diversity <br/>
of our group for an article she is writing.  We don&#39;t know how she got <br/>
ahold of us, but I believe it was from our website, which contains our <br/>
mission statement, which is a statement about diversity.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this woman was asking about homeschooling resources about <br/>
diversity, specifically.  All that we could come up with off the top of <br/>
our heads were some of the doll-making catalogs that many of the <br/>
unschoolers in our group use.  I remembered The Drinking Gourd, but I <br/>
could not recall the woman&#39;s name (even though I met her in Dallas!), <br/>
and we weren&#39;t sure if she was still in business.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of any other resources we could send to this woman for <br/>
her article?  <br/>

me to be a useful thing for unschoolers.  Perhaps it involves my prejudice <br/>
against myopic New Yorkers; maybe not.  <br/>
<br/>
Referring her to Donna&#39;s probably the best idea.<br/>
