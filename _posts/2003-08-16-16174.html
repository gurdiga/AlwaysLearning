An article of mine is here.  It was supposed to be in the fall issue of real <br/>
magazine, and might yet be.  I received an unclear communique saying &quot;Hi <br/>
Sandra - instead of waiting for the Fall issue of the magazine, we decided to place <br/>
your article in the online portion of the magazine immediately.  We felt <br/>
people needed to read it prior to the school year beginning.  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s clear as far as it goes, but I don&#39;t know whether it will also be in <br/>
real print.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to see Weird Al tonight!  I would partly rather be in Sacramento <br/>
but maybe next year.  I really like Weird Al.  I&#39;m sorry I ended up making <br/>
ticket arrangements for 13 people, because it would have been MUCH easier just to <br/>
get my three kids and go, instead of <br/>
hosting/coordinating/collecting/negotiating...<br/>

This line made me smile....<br/>
In education classes, we were assigned to read what John Holt thought was <br/>
wrong with the schools. He said that sitting in rows taking notes was no way to <br/>
learn. I sat in my desk and took notes about his theories and findings.   <br/>

Nice picture, by the way, Sandra.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-649141589">Thanks for the article.<br/>
I sent it to some friends and family.<br/>
My ds Jack is 6 and will be 7 in Oct.  He isn&#39;t reading and I don&#39;t <br/>
know if he will be soon or if it will be much later.  Outside <br/>
pressure is the only thing I&#39;m worried about, and I don&#39;t always have <br/>
the energy to explain why I&#39;m okay with him not reading or anything <br/>
else he &quot;should&#39; be doing.  Articles like yours help me keep friends <br/>
and family informed/reminded of my philosophy and maybe help them not <br/>
to worry. (or maybe it adds to their worry! who knows....)<br/>
<br/>
Also, my dd Carly is so into Wierd Al right now!  She downloaded some <br/>
of his songs off the computer and knows all the words to most of them.<br/>
Have you heard the Hardware Store song?  He lists at a very fast pace <br/>
all the things you can find in a hardware store.  It&#39;s great.  She&#39;s <br/>
trying to master that one.  Very difficult.<br/>
I love Omish Paradise. (sung to Gangters Paradise).<br/>
And the Emminem one about watching TV til your brain turns to mush is <br/>
really funny.<br/>
He came to our area about 5 years ago, but we weren&#39;t into him at the <br/>
time.  I hope he comes back soon!<br/>

    Great article! I passed it on as well. :-)<br/>

&quot;The function of the child is to live his own life - not the life that his<br/>
anxious parents think he should live, nor the life according to the purpose<br/>
of the educator who thinks he knows what is best. All of this interference<br/>
and guidance on the part of adults only produces a generation of robots.&quot;<br/>
