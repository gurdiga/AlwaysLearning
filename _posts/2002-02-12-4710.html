<br/>
&lt;&lt; So what *does* a person need to know to be knowledgeable?  Isn&#39;t that <br/>
going <br/>
to be different for everyone?  What do *you* need to know, right now, to <br/>
become more knowledgeable?   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I vote for &quot;How to use google.com.&quot;<br/>
I&#39;m just a few minutes behind knowing everything--I just have to figure out <br/>
what to put in the search box. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We use it EVERY DAY.  This week&#39;s examples:  song lyrics, to find out who <br/>
wrote a song,  how to order a light bulb for the lava lamp, to get the <br/>
address of a relatively nearby doll hospital, whether it might snow, I looked <br/>
up something I don&#39;t remember now for my husband last night, to check the <br/>
name of a movie, to look for spellings, to get forms one of the kids needed <br/>
for an SCA event (consent for treatment in case of accident with a parent in <br/>
another state)...<br/>
<br/>
Knowing how to find out is better then memorizing stuff anyway because things <br/>
change.  Geography changes, prices and phone numbers and the number of <br/>
counties in New Mexico and what&#39;s a mammal and the hours of stores change.<br/>

We used it yesterday to learn more about gila monsters (saw some in Arizona,<br/>
at the University where my sil works). We discovered you can buy gila<br/>
monsters over the internet. &lt;g&gt; We&#39;re not going to do it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120761567">Were you here in Arizona??? We have two big book sales going on in<br/>
Tucson, and I wondered if you would come... saw lots of people who were<br/>
clearly dealers, they knew what they were doing!<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s illegal to buy gila monsters, though, isn&#39;t it? We had one as a pet<br/>
for a while when I was a kid, and I know it was illegal then. A friend of<br/>
my dad&#39;s who worked at the desert museum gave it to use, though...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-77036946">I was in Tucson on Friday and Phoenix on Saturday (and a lot of little <br/>
bookstores, too!) Came home with a couple hundred very good books.<br/>

I don&#39;t know what the legalities are, but they definitely were offered for<br/>
sale at the sites we were on. Maybe in some states you can have them (heck,<br/>
in some states you can have lions!)<br/>

Wow. I was at the Brandeis sale Friday, got a $2 video that&#39;s been going<br/>
for $50, and some books... today at the library book sale I got all the<br/>
books I could carry for $13.25. Half price day :-)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You inspired me... I found a lot of info at www.drseward.com... kind of<br/>
nuts, if you ask me, but informative. It&#39;s illegal to capture and/or<br/>
possess wild-born gilas. It is legal to buy and own a gila that was bred<br/>
in captivity, in most places (some city or county laws vary). I&#39;m not<br/>
sure why one would want to...<br/>
