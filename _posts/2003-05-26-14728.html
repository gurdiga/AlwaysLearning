<div id="ygrps-yiv-172353764">Kelly,<br/>
I think you&#39;ll be extremely pleased with Dee&#39;s<br/>
FunShop--whatever it is---because she was terrific at<br/>
balancing the needs of the different families. Some<br/>
wanted her to be &quot;scientific&quot; and all that.  Others<br/>
wanted her to be laidback and fun.  She did a great<br/>
job satisfying everyone which would have been an<br/>
impossible task for moi.  Sometimes we homeschoolers<br/>
can be quite demanding! ; )  She had great freebies<br/>
too.  <br/>
<br/>
My friend and I were later chatting about the workshop<br/>
Dee did and decided that it was a godsend having<br/>
someone come and do something that was high interest,<br/>
good quality, and yet understands our kids.  Sometimes<br/>
we have brought people in or have gone somewhere and<br/>
you can tell they are thinking our kids are<br/>
maladjusted because they don&#39;t go to school.  Ever<br/>
have that? The presenter asks a question and usually<br/>
it is worded in a weird way and the kids don&#39;t say<br/>
anything and you can tell he&#39;s thinking &quot;These kids<br/>
need to be in school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Dee mentioned that she homeschools her kids so I think<br/>
that makes a huge difference.  Her kids were very<br/>
poised and knowlegeable which I thought showed good<br/>
role modeling for my kids.  That kids could learn<br/>
something and then go out and talk about it in public.<br/>
<br/>
Dee let our kids hold the gators and snakes.  She was<br/>
real casual about it.  She brought small stuff so<br/>
nothing was intimidating. I even held something!  She<br/>
asked that parents not force kids to hold anything<br/>
they were uncomfortable with though.  One mom, who<br/>
isn&#39;t a member of our group but was invited by another<br/>
member, got a snake and gave it to her 6 year old son.<br/>
 I can&#39;t explain it but the mom was kinda arrogant and<br/>
acted like she knew it all.  Like it was her son&#39;s<br/>
right to hold and do whatever with the snake.  The kid<br/>
was holding the snake and it was wrapped on his wrist.<br/>
 It was a really small snake.  The kid then decides he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want the snake and flings it across the room. <br/>
Dee didn&#39;t freak. She calmly went and got the snake<br/>
and went right on answering the kids questions as if<br/>
nothing had happened.  The mom didn&#39;t apologize and<br/>
thought it was funny!!  Some of us were burning with<br/>
embarrassment.  But Dee never mentioned it and said<br/>
she had a great time and that we  had great kids.<br/>
<br/>
There is another guy in her lab who goes around too.<br/>
We saw them at a community event last year. He brings<br/>
a retired (woman) school teacher with him as an<br/>
assistant. You DON&#39;T want them if Dee can&#39;t make it.  <br/>
The retired teacher was VERY ARROGANT.  The guy gave<br/>
an ok talk. He was kinda charismatic in his own way<br/>
because he is a tall blond, good speaking voice, but<br/>
he wasn&#39;t into kids. That was evident. He kept them<br/>
all at an arm&#39;s distance. When his time was up, they<br/>
packed up and left.  They weren&#39;t into hanging around<br/>
and talking to every kid like Dee.  I think the guy<br/>
and teacher both had an attitude about homeschoolers<br/>
IMHO.  Dee is petite and I think especially the young<br/>
kids warm up to her very easily.  The guy is over 6 ft<br/>
tall and the young kids were afraid of him. The<br/>
assistant had an attitude, even more than the guy.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a question about FunShops so I can tell my<br/>
friends more details.  Are they just for kids?  I mean<br/>
are the workshop leaders going to expect just kids<br/>
(and sometimes parents)?  Are kids going to be allowed<br/>
to come and go? Just wondering because if I left my<br/>
kids in a FunShop so I could go to a workshop or talk,<br/>
then I would want to know that they stayed there until<br/>
I got back.  How will that work?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it is mommyitis but I couldn&#39;t figure out WHEN<br/>
the Funshops were scheduled.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No. No age descrimination. Any one can participate in any presentation or <br/>
workshop (except maybe the &quot;For Dads Only&quot; one! &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
 I mean &gt; are the workshop leaders going to expect just kids<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; (and sometimes parents)? <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>They should expect everyone/anyone. Smaller children may need an old sibling <br/>
or parent nearby. Just depends on what they&#39;re offering. Some may appeal to <br/>
certain ages and not others---ya&#39; never know!<br/>
<br/>
 Are kids going to be allowed<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to come and go? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yep. We just ask that they are quiet when it&#39;s necessary! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Just wondering because if I left my<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hope they&#39;d come get you if they needed you. There will be volunteers in <br/>
the funshop room to escort smaller ones. They are NOT babysitters, but they will <br/>
offer assistance. And the rooms are RIGHT next door to each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maybe it is mommyitis but I couldn&#39;t figure out WHEN<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Funshops are scheduled at the same times as the main presentations. I won&#39;t <br/>
be REALLY scheduling them until right before the conference---maybe two weeks <br/>
or so out. If I were to do them today, I&#39;d have to change a dozen times between <br/>
now & then! You can keep checking back at the website---but don&#39;t expect <br/>
finality until just before. The final schedule will also be in the handbook, so <br/>
you&#39;ll know what&#39;s where when.<br/>

&gt;Kelly, I was wondering the same thing.  Also, what if one of my girls decides in the middle of a Funshop that she wants to be with me instead? HeidiC.<br/>
