Nature  supplies these elements in each plant<br/>
in quantities sufficient to  metabolize the carbohydrate in that<br/>
particular plant.**   [  quoted from Dr. Martin ]<br/>

That sounds bogus to me.  Plants don&#39;t  form their leaves and roots for the <br/>
purpose of being  eaten.<br/>

================<br/>
Especially, they don&#39;t form leaves particularly to be eaten by humans.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
And &quot;nature supplies&quot; a heck of a LOT of plants that people can&#39;t eat at  <br/>
all, whatsoever.<br/>
 <br/>
Oh well.<br/>
Reminder to those who want to come here to defend controlling and limiting  <br/>
children:  The list has very many successful longtime unschoolers who know  <br/>
from personal experience what the problems are with controlling and limiting  <br/>
(and some of them know it because they see the stunning differences in children  <br/>
who are rarely-to-never controlled or limited.<br/>
