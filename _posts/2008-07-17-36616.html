<div id="ygrps-yiv-1988682506">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to say &quot;Hi&quot; as a new member of the group. I am teaching my<br/>
little girl at home - she&#39;s 5 years old - and am coming to the realization<br/>
that what we have been doing - and the only thing that works with her - is<br/>
basically unschooling. I&#39;m looking forward to learning from those<br/>
experienced in unschooling and gaining a sense of community rather than<br/>
feeling isolated. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for letting me learn along with everyone else.<br/>
<br/>

Hi, Becky.  There&#39;s some excitement in Georgia this week because  <br/>
Kelli Traaseth&#39;s family just moved there from Minnesota (making those  <br/>
in Oregon who wanted them to move there a little sad and a little  <br/>
jealous).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kelli&#39;s blog is<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/">http://ourjoyfullife.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and so with that you&#39;ll know you&#39;re not the only on in Georgia.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And here&#39;s something along the lines of socializing:<br/>
<br/>
Radical Unschoolers&#39; Network<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://familyrun.ning.com/">http://familyrun.ning.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a little bit like Facebook, but all unschoolers, and it&#39;s so new  <br/>
that you can be one of the first few in there.  There are serious  <br/>
discussions there too, and also fun&#39;n&#39;games.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The AlwaysLearning is fairly serious, for being a big list and for  <br/>
looking at unschooling from a philosophical and analytical angle.   <br/>
It&#39;s not as serious as it sounds, but it&#39;s not a &quot;how&#39;s your dog?&quot;  <br/>
list, either, whereas some others are more chit-chatty.<br/>
<br/>
There are links to lots of new unschooler aids here:<br/>

If the &quot;choose your own adventure in the prairie dog village&quot;  <br/>
organization of my site bothers you, Joyce has one organized  <br/>
absolutely differently.  Profoundly differently.  And some people  <br/>
like Joyce&#39;s writing voice better, too.  That has never hurt my  <br/>
feelings at all.  She&#39;s very scientific (try to hear Yul Brynner&#39;s  <br/>
voice in &quot;The King and I&quot; on that &quot;scientific&quot;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635173604">Thank you so much Sandra for the welcome and the heads up about the new<br/>
Georgia resident - I looked at Kelli&#39;s blog and she moved to the town where<br/>
I grew up!  I live less than 20 miles from there now! Very cool :-)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I will look into the Radical Unschooler&#39;s Network too and I&#39;m reading and<br/>
