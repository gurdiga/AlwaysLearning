<div id="ygrps-yiv-38467404">I don&#39;t think I have introduced myself yet.  I am Mary and my husband, Gus,<br/>
and I have a 10-year-old son, Jake Henry.  We live in Connecticut and I am a<br/>
co-leader for our unschooling group.  Are there any radical unschoolers on<br/>
this list that live in CT?  Please reply to me off list.  I&#39;d love to know<br/>
radical unschoolers in my state.<br/>

<br/>
Try the New England Unschooling list:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NewEnglandUnschooling/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NewEnglandUnschooling/</a><br/>
<br/>
Luz and Ned Vare are on there and have a group in CT. I think someone  <br/>
recently posted a statewide inclusive group for CT. The list isn&#39;t  <br/>
very busy so it should be easy to find in the archives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692278645">Linnaea uses Skype most nights to talk to her friend near Newcastle. There <br/>
are chat features and they can talk, they play World of Warcraft or Sims 2 <br/>
or other things and talk about it. I really love the way Skype has allowed <br/>
their relationship to continue even after we moved. The Skype account with a <br/>
working microphone is schuyliz, the one without a working microphone, but <br/>
with the computer that is on much of the time is simonwaynforth, if anyone <br/>
wants to contact us via Skype.<br/>
