  I am a very new member of this list and am in the phase of reading and learning.  I hope it&#39;s not too soon to post this question but Joyce&#39;s recent comment made me wonder.<br/>
<br/>
  How would you (veterans on this list) describe the difference between unschooling and radical unschooling?  Is it a matter of taking unschooling principles and applying them to everything (house rules, food, bedtime,etc) or is it something more or something completely different?<br/>
  I appreciate your thoughts and also---if I&#39;m asking a question too soon please tell me!  <br/>

<br/>
Radical from &quot;radix&quot; or root - and the root of unschooling is learning. The principles of how people learn don&#39;t change between learning to read and learning about social skills and responsibility. <br/>
<br/>
The following link is nice in that it says &quot;principles of unschooling&quot; but you&#39;ll see every point is about learning: <br/>

<br/>
So it&#39;s not so much &quot;applying the principles of unschooling&quot; as seeing learning in everything and therefore the principles apply.<br/>
