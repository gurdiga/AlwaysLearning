<div id="ygrps-yiv-418872013">This is an area I am highly lacking in, unschooling a &quot;special needs&quot; child.<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter with a brain tumor. She has a hand full of obvious <br/>
differences, mostly hormone and growth related. She also has a handful of <br/>
diagnosis that the Dr.&#39;s would love to saddle her with.<br/>
<br/>
I hesitate to do anything more or less with her than my other children, <br/>
aside from obvious care taking stuff. I also wonder what I might have burned <br/>
in my brain from society that is norm or not.<br/>
<br/>
She was 6 when diagnosed and is 13 now. I have just now started to see some <br/>
pronounced differences.<br/>
<br/>
Any helpful hints?<br/>
<br/>
Peace.<br/>

21 years in the unschooling world and still so much to learn!<br/>
