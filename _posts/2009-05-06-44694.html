<div id="ygrps-yiv-1141029773">After reading everyone&#39;s advice about my daughter not being able to get out<br/>
of the school mind-set, I realized something. how would she ever get out of<br/>
it if I couldn&#39;t? While I thought I was trying to make learning fun and<br/>
interesting, I still had one thing in common with public school. I was<br/>
trying to *make* her learn. even if I was asking her what she wanted to<br/>
learn. And even though my younger two have no problems telling me what they<br/>
like and don&#39;t like and what they want to learn about and don&#39;t (my 7 year<br/>
old announced last night he doesn&#39;t really like the book we&#39;re all reading<br/>
together- Stuart Little - and would rather I read Magic Treehouse to him by<br/>
ourselves J) I&#39;m still driving myself crazy doing lesson plans and flipping<br/>
through workbooks (and buying workbooks! UGH!) trying to find the perfect<br/>
page that looks fun for them or deciding what we &quot;need&quot; to be learning, only<br/>
to hear moans and groans from them. So I really thought about it. seriously,<br/>
did I need lesson plans to teach them to walk, talk, use the &quot;potty&quot;, ride<br/>
their bikes, sing their abc&#39;s, recognize shapes, count, write their names.<br/>
NO! They learned these things through play and everyday living, and all on<br/>
their own time scale, might I mention. For instance, my middle daughter had<br/>
no interest in potty training. I tried to force it and have her trained by 2<br/>
&quot;like the books say&quot;, until I realized that it really didn&#39;t matter, put her<br/>
back in diapers, and she told me when she was ready to &quot;go potty&quot;. My son<br/>
potty-trained early, but preferred to use the back yard (LOL). He rode his<br/>
bike much younger than the girls, but my oldest walked the youngest and my<br/>
middle daughter has always had the largest vocabulary. Anyway.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So I sat them down this morning, while they were playing games on the<br/>
computer and thinking I had forgotten that today was a &quot;school day&quot; and told<br/>
them that I had been thinking. I didn&#39;t mention the unschooling community to<br/>
them, so they wouldn&#39;t think, &quot;Oh goodness. Mom&#39;s been on the internet<br/>
again.&quot; I told them that I&#39;d been thinking about how we learn and what we<br/>
learn and how we&#39;d learned things in the past. I told them that I didn&#39;t<br/>
think it was necessary that we use workbooks and textbooks. I also made it<br/>
very clear that I wanted their opinion on my ideas and that I was open to<br/>
however they wanted to do things; if they enjoyed workbooks and textbooks<br/>
then they were free to continue with them, even if just for certain<br/>
subjects. I told them that I think we spend too much time at home instead of<br/>
at museums and shows and the park. I told them that there are so many neat<br/>
movies we could be watching together during the day, or fun games on the<br/>
computer, or doing more art projects which they all really enjoy. My younger<br/>
two were thrilled with the idea of putting away the workbooks and &quot;playing&quot;<br/>
all day. I made sure they understood that we would still be learning, but<br/>
that we didn&#39;t have to plan what we would learn, it would just happen. And<br/>
some things we would make happen by planning trips or renting certain<br/>
movies, whatever interested them that day. To my surprise, my 6th grader<br/>
perked up at the conversation. at first she was hesitant, and said that<br/>
there&#39;s no way she could learn what she needed to without reading a book,<br/>
and how did I expect her to learn as much science just by visiting museums<br/>
(she really said that, can you believe it?). so we talked about museums and<br/>
all the different kinds we have around us and all the other ways to learn<br/>
about something. She asked if she would still write stories, and I told her<br/>
of course! We could all sit around some days with our notebooks and write<br/>
stories to share with each other, and then illustrate them if we wanted to.<br/>
We could take all day, or 30 minutes. Then I explained to her that when we<br/>
go back through the stories and edit and revise, she would be learning about<br/>
grammar. she asked, &quot;Mom, how am I going to learn all the names of stuff by<br/>
doing that. my books talk about reflexive pronouns and demonstrative&quot; (and<br/>
she threw out other words to me that I don&#39;t remember). I told her that if I<br/>
was being honest, there are lots of things that I don&#39;t remember the exact<br/>
name or classification, but that I am an excellent writer which means I know<br/>
how to use them in my sentences. She said that made sense. she is also a<br/>
good writer, and wasn&#39;t exactly sure why she had to memorize ALL the<br/>
classifications of every word. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This part is funny. she has agreed to giving this whole &quot;learning is fun&quot;<br/>
thing a shot since there isn&#39;t much of the &quot;school year left&quot;. (while we&#39;re<br/>
making progress, obviously we still have a little bit to go! LOL)<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
So we boxed up all the workbooks and textbooks today, except for the ones<br/>
they like that have fun little activities. filled the shelves in the office<br/>
instead with all of our games and crossword puzzles, mad libs, art stuff,<br/>
blocks, etc. We had some shopping to do at Target, so we picked up some fun<br/>
&quot;educational&quot; games while we were there. a couple of games for their<br/>
Nintendo DS&#39;s and one for the Wii, along with shovels and wild flower seeds<br/>
to plant in the garden, a &quot;sea-monkey&quot; acquarium (I still don&#39;t know what<br/>
that is!), a microscope. all stuff they wanted. We&#39;re going to the Farmer&#39;s<br/>
Market in town tomorrow, and to the planetarium on Saturday (my younger two<br/>
are enthralled with space and stars right now). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I still have to consciously work on my thinking, too. like the fact that<br/>
it&#39;s ok if we go to the planetarium on Saturday instead of during the week,<br/>
because &quot;school&quot; doesn&#39;t have to be &quot;Monday-Friday&quot;. we can learn every day<br/>
(isn&#39;t it funny that we actually think we can&#39;t &#39;learn&#39; on the weekends when<br/>
we&#39;re involved in public school!) But I feel like I&#39;ve made (or am making)<br/>
the plunge, and finally on the right track. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thank you guys for all your kind words, encouragement, advice, kick in the<br/>
pants, and whatever else you threw my way! I&#39;ll have lots more questions,<br/>
but I know that I will always get great answers with this group!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1727695717">Your post was happy and full of change, and I&#39;m still going to  <br/>
critique some of your current thinking, for the benefit of the  <br/>
discussion.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. I was<br/>
trying to *make* her learn. even if I was asking her what she wanted to<br/>

they<br/>
like and don&#39;t like and what they want to learn about and don&#39;t-=-<br/>
<br/>
I never asked my kids once what they wanted to learn.  Never.   I knew  <br/>
they were going to learn from whatever they saw and did, so I put  <br/>
things out for them to find and learn from (or not).   And I would  <br/>
switch those things around, and bring things back out a year or five  <br/>
later, and just put them in view and easy reach and not announce them.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/strewing">http://sandradodd.com/strewing</a><br/>
<br/>
-=So I really thought about it. seriously,<br/>

<br/>
You thought to yourself &quot;did I need lesson plans to teach them to  <br/>
walk, talk...&quot;<br/>
But you wrote it to all of us.   Please think about whether you taught  <br/>
them to walk.  Please consider deeply whether you taught a child to  <br/>
talk.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-I told them that I think we spend too much time at home instead of<br/>

neat<br/>
movies we could be watching together during the day, or fun games on the<br/>
computer, or doing more art projects which they all really enjoy.=-<br/>
<br/>
My first thought was to wish you hadn&#39;t set them down and had a talk.   <br/>
The &quot;now everything changes&quot; speech can be disturbing for kids whose  <br/>
mom assured them earlier that they would never get to heaven (job/ <br/>
money/reproduction) if they didn&#39;t go to school (or approximate school  <br/>
at home).    You could have said &quot;Sure, why not?&quot; hundreds of joyous  <br/>
times, but now you&#39;ve given one big bewildering &quot;yes&quot; and now you&#39;ll  <br/>
need to say &quot;no&quot; sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-. To my surprise, my 6th grader<br/>
perked up ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
To my surprise, you&#39;re still writing to this list and calling her a  <br/>
6th grader.  You could say &quot;My oldest&quot; or &quot;My 12 year old&quot; or something.<br/>
<br/>
-=and how did I expect her to learn as much science just by visiting  <br/>
museums<br/>
(she really said that, can you believe it?)-=-<br/>
<br/>
Of course I believe it.  Why don&#39;t you?  You were trying to make her  <br/>
learn yesterday.   Now you&#39;ve told her you&#39;ve been wrong for years and  <br/>
everything she&#39;s believed has been removed.  That&#39;s like divorce, or  <br/>
leaving a church abruptly.   Slow down.<br/>
<br/>
And did you really say she could learn just as much science &quot;Just&quot; by  <br/>
visiting museums?<br/>
<br/>
While you&#39;re checking your speech for &quot;taught&quot; and &quot;6th grader,&quot; check  <br/>
for &quot;just,&quot; too, because it&#39;s an insidious little word.<br/>
<br/>
If she goes to a museum and likes something, she could talk to the  <br/>
docents about it, look at what they have in the gift shop, come home  <br/>
and get on the internet, you could rent DVDs about it (just get one  <br/>
and don&#39;t make a big deal about whether she watches it or not).   She  <br/>
could keep that interest for two days or twenty years, but if you try  <br/>
to manage and control that, you&#39;re screwing up natural learning.    <br/>
Encourage!  Facilitate!   Don&#39;t &quot;require.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-We could all sit around some days with our notebooks and write<br/>
stories to share with each other, and then illustrate them if we  <br/>
wanted to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
What if every day each person writes when she wants to, and shares if  <br/>
she wants to, and illustrates if she wants to, without a family  <br/>
project some days?<br/>
<br/>
-=- Then I explained to her that when we<br/>
go back through the stories and edit and revise, she would be learning  <br/>
about<br/>
grammar. -=-<br/>
<br/>
What if you only edit and revise by individual request?  What if you  <br/>
drop the phrase &quot;edit and revise&quot; and think of it as &quot;helping&quot;?    <br/>
Sometimes people don&#39;t want or need help.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Mom, how am I going to learn all the names of stuff by<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As the parent, you&#39;ve been in school much longer than any of your kids! <br/>
You will need the most deschooling!  That&#39;s often how it is, the kids<br/>
&quot;get it&quot; so much easier and quicker than our old parental and schooled<br/>
selves.<br/>
<br/>
When in doubt, look directly at your kids and see them for their<br/>
wonderful selves and all the cool things they love to do.  It always<br/>
helps!  I use this in all times of stress and uncertainty!  I go and BE<br/>
with my kids and bask in their awesome kidness and sure enough, my<br/>
thoughts have changed direction, and my focus is back on living happily<br/>
with my kids!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; So I sat them down this morning, while they were playing games on the<br/>
&gt; computer and thinking I had forgotten that today was a &quot;school day&quot;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and told<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; them that I had been thinking.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And soon, you&#39;ll forget what grade they are in!  I always have to stop<br/>
and think and count back, when asked what grade one of my kids would be<br/>
in.  Well, they aren&#39;t in one are they?  Grade levels are purely for<br/>
organizing large amounts of kids, and since I only have 2, such<br/>
organizations really aren&#39;t necessary or even relevant in our life!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;I told them that there are so many neat<br/>
&gt; movies we could be watching together during the day, or fun games on<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; computer, or doing more art projects which they all really enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Movies can provide such great connecting moments!  Something light and<br/>
fun, no hidden motives, no alternate agenda, just being together<br/>
watching a movie.  I really think they are a really good tool for<br/>
deschooling.  Movies provide relaxed entertainment that gives food for<br/>
thought!</div>
