<br/>
If you mean juding that, indeed, you have fewer years of experience then that <br/>
is just a fact.<br/>
<br/>
If you mean judging that your &quot;ideas&quot; are less brilliant - than that&#39;s silly, <br/>
we&#39;ll all judge your ideas on their merits, I&#39;m sure.<br/>
<br/>
If you are under 34, you are closer in age to my daughter than to me. Your <br/>
experience AS a teenager and young adult can be valuable to me and I <br/>
appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
If your children are under 11, then your experience with your own children <br/>
isn&#39;t as valuable to me because I&#39;ve been there 3 times with my own kids and <br/>
umpteen b&#39;zillions of times with my family and friends&#39; kids. Not that your <br/>
kids and your experiences might not be a little different and they certainly <br/>
are often interesting to me - I ENJOY hearing about them - and once in a <br/>
while someone might come up with a really interesting new idea, but mostly <br/>
I&#39;ve heard it before and seen it with my own eyes. It isn&#39;t a reflection of <br/>
any of you not being brilliant and wonderful and insightful and fully <br/>
understanding of unschooling ideas. It isn&#39;t YOU - it is me - I&#39;m just not <br/>
needy in that way anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So we don&#39;t have a fully symmetric relationship. That&#39;s life. It is as it <br/>
should be. Don&#39;t get all heated up and feel like you&#39;re not respected. You <br/>
are. I cannot begin to tell you how much I admire many of you. But, it is <br/>
natural for the old to remind the young to slow down and stop talking <br/>
themselves and to spend some time listening instead, especially when they are <br/>
talking talking talking and not appearing to realize that they aren&#39;t really <br/>
paying attention, but just spouting their own opinions. Societies in which <br/>
age and experience are not respected are really sad - this society is so very <br/>
much like that and it limits our ability to make social progress. Each new <br/>
generation discounting the value of the experience of the previous one. <br/>
Sadder to see it in unschoolers, for some reason.<br/>

nothing more to learn.  I may be talking a lot now,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Kitrina --<br/>
<br/>
 So you&#39;re making the point that younger newer parents may have something <br/>
useful to offer? Nobody has once said that isn&#39;t true.<br/>
<br/>
You might ask yourself why you are repeatedly making a point that nobody is <br/>
disagreeing with.<br/>
<br/>
After having having muddled debates that end up with other people telling us <br/>
that we&#39;re missing the point or arguing a point that isn&#39;t relevant, some <br/>
people learn by experience to spend more time getting really good clarity on <br/>
what the other person means before they argue back. Trial and error - lots of <br/>
discussions over many years -- these were learning experiences. This might be <br/>
one for you.<br/>
<br/>
Can you see the difference between saying:<br/>
<br/>
1. Younger newer parents have nothing useful to offer.<br/>
<br/>
2. Younger newer parents here on this list have the opportunity to learn from <br/>
the experience of long-term mindful unschooling parents with older kids. If <br/>
the younger newer parents dig in their heels and argue too much, instead of <br/>
doing more listening, they&#39;ll miss out on good information and advice. So - <br/>
in the Monday tv debate - when long-term unschoolers were talking about how <br/>
unlimited tv HAD worked in their families, over the years, and people with 2 <br/>
year olds were sending us websites to convince us that tv would turn our kids <br/>
into zombies, younger newer-to-unschooling parents were advised that they&#39;d <br/>
be better off to talk less and listen more.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody made statement 1 and it just makes your inexperience (in discussions <br/>
of this kind) more and more apparent when you keep arguing as if they did.<br/>

I don&#39;t think they&#39;d like it.  I didn&#39;t like it when I was <br/>
breastfeeding my eldest and an older, more experienced mom told <br/>
me that formula wouldn&#39;t hurt her, that it wouldn&#39;t hurt her to <br/>
be left with a babysitter so I could go to my uncle&#39;s wedding, <br/>
that she needed to learn to separate from me.<br/>
<br/>
They might have been older and more experienced, but I had <br/>
access to information that wasn&#39;t available to them when their<br/>

<br/>
Do new unschoolers have access to information we didn&#39;t have when our kids <br/>
were little?  <br/>
<br/>
YES!  <br/>
<br/>
Where did they get it?<br/>
<br/>
In large part, from some of us!<br/>
<br/>
The internet is full of information placed there by volunteer homeschooling <br/>
parents.<br/>
<br/>
John Holt&#39;s books would probably be long out of print if a whole bunch of <br/>
people hadn&#39;t asked for copies.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
But you didn&#39;t hear advice like that at La Leche League meetings.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
If you went to a specific place for ideas, you weren&#39;t out in the wild whole <br/>
world.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re not asking that 22 year old women listen to all 45 year old women on <br/>
the planet.  We&#39;re asking that they not come to an unschooling group and <br/>
belittle the advice of moms who have unschooled for years, whose kids are <br/>
older, have jobs, relationships, etc., and tell us that based on their <br/>
experience with their toddlers, we&#39;re not right.<br/>

generalized to every interaction between young and old, inexperienced and<br/>

<br/>
When a point of argument over philosphy is continuing because someone lacks<br/>
personal experience with applying the philosophy, there is a good reason to<br/>
suggest they sit back and listen for a while. It&#39;s especially true when<br/>
someone is insisting that something is necessary and others are saying they<br/>
have real life experience not using it and their kids have turned out fine.<br/>

anyway. Slow down, read several times and think more about what someone might <br/>

people read it (as opposed to my style which is long-winded and lots of times <br/>
people only read bits of it). More blunt  is also effective because it leaves <br/>
room for the reader to do the thinking - doesn&#39;t do it all for them. But when <br/>
people just read it quickly just react and don&#39;t slow down and think about <br/>
what the person might mean - they often misread blunt as defensive or rude or <br/>
hostile. Try assuming that it is not that and see if you understand things a <br/>
bit differently.<br/>

arguments end up being because one side is arguing A vs B and the other side<br/>
is arguing C vs D and they&#39;re both certain they&#39;re having the same argument<br/>
and wondering why their explanations are falling flat. As an example (rather<br/>
than a point to be discussed ;-) it struck me after it died down that the<br/>
most recent argument on the unschooling list was one side arguing that a<br/>
gentler approach was better than a harsh approach and the other side was<br/>
arguing that freedom of expression was better than censorship. There was a<br/>
classic discussion on the unschooling message board where there were 3 or<br/>
more separate arguments going on and no one had a clue that they weren&#39;t all<br/>
having the same argument. ;-) It can be hard to see when you&#39;re in the<br/>
middle of it trying to make your point to people who seem more dense than<br/>
you thought possible ;-)<br/>

NOT work as unschooling because &lt;reason here&gt;<br/>

cancer, induces hearing loss, yadda yadda yadda. There have been studies!<br/>
Old Timer: Well, we long time unschoolers don&#39;t see that as true in our<br/>
experience. If you are coming here for advice on unschooling, why do you not<br/>
want to listen to our answers? We are more experienced than you in this<br/>
area. We are older, therefore we have been doing this longer and have more<br/>
experience.<br/>
Newbie: Are you saying I am young and don&#39;t have anything good to say at<br/>

As a newer unschooler who has purposely stayed out of this whole discussion, I&#39;ve been making a few judgements of my own. It&#39;s very easy to do when you just read and are not in the middle of it all. It seems to me that the same discussions are taking place over and over about 20 times. It&#39;s like deja vu.

their permission. I think that&#39;s what most of these newbie vs. oldie<br/>
discussions come down to - Newbie says &quot;I want to unschool but I must<br/>
control X, or this terrible thing will happen.&quot; Oldtimer replies, &quot;Well,<br/>
I don&#39;t control X, and nothing terrible has happened, it&#39;s been great.&quot;<br/>
And it&#39;s fine up to that point, and some people (like Pat) say, &quot;Wow,<br/>
that&#39;s really wonderful, I&#39;m so glad to hear that it&#39;s worked that way,<br/>
now I&#39;m less afraid to try it for myself.&quot; Other people, though, seem to<br/>
have a great deal of trouble accepting or understanding new ideas about<br/>
freedom and control that contradict old ideas, which I think is natural,<br/>
to some degree... but often their response is to quickly throw up a<br/>
flurry of expert opinion, and/or illogical and/or defensive arguments, <br/>
and/or personal attack. I understand why these ideas are threatening and<br/>
scary for people, I do, but after a while it just gets wearing and isn&#39;t<br/>
much fun. Often, the first step in learning something new is to stop<br/>
fighting the ideas at the doorstep and just let them come in, and examine<br/>
them, and play with them, and then come back and ask real questions based<br/>
on that thoughtful knowledge.<br/>

I can see how it would be tiresome to have to keep stating<br/>
the obvious time and time again.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there are any *things* that are inherently outside<br/>
of the scope of unschooling.  I do think there are a whole<br/>
bunch of adult behaviors that are, and a bunch of others that<br/>
can be, depending on the situation.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes.  <br/>
<br/>
I just don&#39;t think that they can be distilled into doctrine.<br/>
Every definition of unschooling I&#39;ve tried doesn&#39;t quite fit<br/>
the truth of unschooling that I feel in my heart and that I&#39;ve <br/>
experienced in my life.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve known unschooled children who chose adult-led, structured<br/>
learning situations.  Do they suddenly stop being unschooled if <br/>
they decide to take piano lessons, join a softball team, use a <br/>
curriculum, learn to read, memorize the multiplication tables, or <br/>
make sure that they&#39;ve got the basics covered?  Do they stop<br/>
being unschooled if they go to school by their own choice?<br/>
What about college?<br/>
<br/>
The children matter.  I want to help them do what they&#39;re trying<br/>
to do.  A lot of these adult-made ideas get in the way of my doing<br/>
what they need and want me to do.  On several occasions, I&#39;ve gotten<br/>
into the trap of worrying about whether what I was doing fit some<br/>
adult&#39;s theory rather than whether what I was doing worked for<br/>
my children.<br/>

[You don&#39;t need to answer that.  I&#39;m sure someone somewhere<br/>
has come up with a line of reasoning as to why children should<br/>
be required to play soccer.]<br/>
<br/>
If you define &quot;unschooling&quot; as &quot;child-led,&quot; you could argue that<br/>
no adult-led soccer program could work with unschooling.  And, for<br/>
some kids, you&#39;d probably be right. <br/>
<br/>
To me, unschooling is about freedom.  It seems contradictory <br/>
to declare certain options outside of unschooling.  Why should <br/>
unschooling limit the possibilities available to children?<br/>

&quot;Because if I let you quit this, you&#39;ll never learn to stick with things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because you need the exercise.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because you need to learn teamwork.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Because I always wanted to play soccer and didn&#39;t get to, so you&#39;re going<br/>
to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These are all reasons that real people have really given their children.<br/>
These are just the ones I know of. The people in the world who actively try<br/>
not to control their children&#39;s lives, learning and thoughts are in the<br/>
minority.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;m afraid that those who are wanting to be heard and taken seriously may <br/>
have just shot themselves in the foot.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Over and over about twenty times.<br/>
<br/>
I have one young in-real-life friend who moans that same thing, and announced <br/>
to me that she didn&#39;t need to show any respect for my age or my SCA rank, and <br/>
that I would have to earn her respect.  Whatever.  What would I do with the <br/>
respect of a person like that?  She took four giant steps backwards in <br/>
earning my respect, but that&#39;s okay--there are hundreds of people I respect <br/>
in person, and she apparently had no interest in being among them.   AND, she <br/>
said, almost in the same words as were expressed here, it was wrong to judge <br/>
someone based on age.   And we were young once too.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, but when I was her age I&#39;d been working in my profession for four <br/>
years, and was a regional SCA officer about to become corporate.  She had <br/>
just finished college and was holding regional office and was telling me I <br/>
was a has been and she was the new generation.  Bummer for the new generation!<br/>
<br/>
If you watch Alice&#39;s Restaurant on DVD, one option is an Arlo Guthrie <br/>
commentary through the whole movie.  I rented it because Holly has listened <br/>
to a sound recording of it fifteen times or so.  Not the original, but from a <br/>
concert in the mid 1990&#39;s, so it has some newer additions.  (So she&#39;s <br/>
memorized one with some different lines!)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is of and for a sub-generation of people who had slogans like <br/>
&quot;don&#39;t trust anyone over 30,&quot; and so forth.  That 1960&#39;s generation gap was <br/>
some serious stuff, with deadly consequences in many cases.  But in the <br/>
commentary he says that the preparation of the DVD had some problems because <br/>
some of the people working on it thought the man playing his dad was really <br/>
Woody Guthrie (who was already dead when the movie was made) and that the <br/>
character singing the Joni Mitchell song (&quot;Songs for Aging Children&quot;) WAS <br/>
Joni Mitchell.  He said something like, &quot;But they were all like twenty-five <br/>
[years old],&quot; and kinda chuckled.<br/>
<br/>
So the point is it&#39;s not what you say you know, it&#39;s what you do.  Instead of <br/>
insisting I respect her in advance of her actually doing anything, my real <br/>
life friend should really hush up about it, do some things which are worthy <br/>
of respect, and let that grow on its own.  <br/>

&lt;&lt; Is there really anything that doesn&#39;t work with unschooling? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Control, lessons, homework, shaming, ignoring, over-scheduling...<br/>
<br/>
Lots of things can cancel out unschooling progress, or can stunt a child&#39;s <br/>
opening up.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This seems to be shifting the argument from the merits of the case<br/>

Too bad.  You&#39;ll follow people who haven&#39;t earned or been given any <br/>

I&#39;d like to politely request a return to the topic of unschooling, and a<br/>
cease-fire on critique of posting style.<br/>
<br/>
On Monday, I hoped for an end to this type of post by Friday. Five days is<br/>
enough. Let&#39;s get back to unschooling. It&#39;s 6 p.m. Pacific Time, we can<br/>
still make it.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Huh? &gt;&gt;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
She means we didn&#39;t have much to read (I used to wait two months for Growing <br/>
Without Schooling to arrive), there weren&#39;t many others to talk to, there <br/>
were NO webpages, no books on unschooling, just John Holt (who was never a <br/>
parent, who never homeschooled anybody) and the rumors that there were other <br/>
unschoolers out there.<br/>
<br/>
I was lucky.  I knew two unschooling families in person and had read lots of <br/>
alternative education stuff in college.  I was way ahead of the game and <br/>
STILL had to wait two months to read Growing Without Schooling cover to cover.<br/>
<br/>
Someone can read unschooling.com for one day and have more information than <br/>
was available ten years ago.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what she means.<br/>
<br/>
So younger, newer people are coming here and yawning and saying we&#39;re not so <br/>
hot, and the reason they know what they know is because of some of the very <br/>
people they&#39;re being disdainful of.<br/>
<br/>
I believe perhaps that&#39;s what was intended.<br/>
<br/>
I could be wrong.<br/>

It was a re-phrasing to show you what you had said, which I was thinking <br/>
maybe wasn&#39;t what you really meant.  &quot;The merits of the case&quot; often have to <br/>
do with the credibility of the witnesses.<br/>

&gt;Of course you wouldn&#39;t like it if someone gave you unsolicited advice on a<br/>
&gt;topic that you never brought up. That would be understandable.  That&#39;s not<br/>
&gt;what I saw happening. This is what I understood to be said.<br/>
&gt;Newbie:&lt;Fill in the blank&gt; is unschooling.<br/>
&gt;Old-Timer: Well, in my experience with unschooling, &lt;fill in the blank&gt; does<br/>
&gt;NOT work as unschooling because &lt;reason here&gt;<br/>
&gt;Newbie: But &lt;fill in the blank&gt; is dangerous and addictive and causes<br/>
&gt;cancer, induces hearing loss, yadda yadda yadda. There have been studies!<br/>
&gt;Old Timer: Well, we long time unschoolers don&#39;t see that as true in our<br/>
&gt;experience. If you are coming here for advice on unschooling, why do you not<br/>
&gt;want to listen to our answers? We are more experienced than you in this<br/>
&gt;area. We are older, therefore we have been doing this longer and have more<br/>
&gt;experience.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>*Here* is where the problem started, at least the way I saw it.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Newbie: Are you saying I am young and don&#39;t have anything good to say at<br/>
&gt;all?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This was a completely different &quot;newbie&quot; than the one above, and I think <br/>
she generalized what Sandra said as applying to anything any younger parent <br/>
of younger kids might have to say.  And she objected to that.<br/>
