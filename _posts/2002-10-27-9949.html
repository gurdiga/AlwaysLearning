I would imagine that any gooey/sticky syrup would work. They probably<br/>
recommended the karo because it wouldn&#39;t show on white/very light wool.<br/>

dark too) I looked at the bottle I have and it says *Light corn syrup, High <br/>
fructose corn syrup, salt, vanilla* I use it to make pecan pies. Yumm! And I <br/>
have seen it as an ingredient for making fake blood too. If you don&#39;t have <br/>
any there, and can&#39;t find a substitute tomorrow, would you like me to UPS it <br/>
to you?<br/>

<br/>
Corn syrup.   Clear and made from sweet corn.<br/>

It would seem then that this is the 100th anniversary (this year) of Karo <br/>
Syrup, the only kind my mother ever owned when I was growing up.  <br/>

Well, I&#39;m staying on one floor for a long time.  It&#39;s one step down and one <br/>
big step and then three small steps up (and a lot of flat between) to get to <br/>
my own bed, and I&#39;m staying here.  I just can&#39;t bear the thought of falling <br/>
again rightnow.  It&#39;s a full flight of steps (8,  a landing, then 7 more) to <br/>
get up to the kitchen.  I&#39;m not going.  From that level it&#39;s another 8 to get <br/>
into the library (the room above the garage).  I&#39;ll go there for Christmas, <br/>
maybe.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m spooked about any moving.  I&#39;ve been out of the house twice, to a funeral <br/>
(my favorite high school teacher, Jacqueline Littlejohn) and to the doctor to <br/>
get a new cast.   That doesn&#39;t involve stairs.  Just bumping along through <br/>
the back yard to the alley.  It&#39;s not a pretty vision. <br/>

It would be really easy to take off, though.<br/>

I remember having infants and going to photographers and hearing/learning <br/>
that they put little bows on baby girls&#39; heads with thick sugar water for <br/>

cue-ball.  And my formula was made with it, too.  :P<br/>
