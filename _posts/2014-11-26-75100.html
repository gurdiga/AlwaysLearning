<div id="ygrps-yiv-516709676">We are in the process of adopting an almost 4 year old. She&#39;s been in the hospital much of her life then with a foster mom who is an rn before she was put in placement with our family. She was with an rn as she is still medically fragile (soft remission from a very aggressive childhood cancer).<br/>
<br/>
I would like some advice on how to respond to her chronic lying. She had invetro drug exposure,  massive chemotherapy and radiation, and I can only guess what life was like for her living in the hospital with no mommy and then a very rigid foster mom. I&#39;m guessing her lying is related to transition or possibly organic in nature from all the legal and illegal drugs in her life or even hereditary.<br/>
<br/>
She does seem to have memory issues and trouble retaining simple things like nursery rhymes,  number sequences and accusing people of hurting her. She said the foster mom was mean and broke her leg and she needed a cast. The actual truth is that she needed surgery and the hospital casted her leg. Many other lies that daily and just don&#39;t make sense (at least to me).<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s young and has experienced so much trama in her lititle life so I expect her to cope with her new, hopefully happy, life with our family and show issues from past tramas. She has been with us for 3 months and I am just being her loving mommy friend so hopefully she will one day trust me. <br/>
<br/>
In the meanwhile.... knowing what you now know,  how would you deal with the lying?  I&#39;m thinking redirecting but how do I do that and should I address the lies or ignore them for now and see how that works?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-702889824"><div dir="ltr">I would listen, listen, listen and then try to reflect back to her what she said.  This will feel stilted, but it works and will hopefully let her know that you hear her.  A three year old should not be expected to be able to report accurate facts. And the facts aren&#39;t really what is important.  What is important is to respect her &quot;take&quot; on the facts of her traumatized life, her feelings about all of the pain.  So when she says that her leg was broken and was in a cast, you say that back to her in warm loving tones.  I would not redirect her from this and other awful memories because this is her way of processing those memories, of making sense of what has happened to her. Redirecting her may make it seem that you do not value her experience of her life.   It will get better, she will talk about these things less and she will talk about happier things eventually.  <div><br></div><div><div>She may not remember that her painful leg injury was not inflicted out of meanness, and how would she know?  I doubt that she can fully comprehend what has happened to her in the fog of trauma and loss.  It may be valuable, years from now, for you to keep a journal or scrap books about her life.  As she grows she may periodically need to rehash and re-interpret these events and it may help (with or without a therapist&#39;s help) to have these things when she is much older and trying to make sense of vague memories.</div></div><div>chris</div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-702889824gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-702889824gmail_quote">On Tue, Nov 25, 2014 at 11:24 PM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616820516"><div dir="ltr">There&#39;s an excellent chapter in &quot;Nurtureshock&quot; by Po Bronson and Ashley Merryman<div><div><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/NurtureShock-New-Thinking-About-Children/dp/0446504130/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417018043&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nurtureshock">http://www.amazon.com/NurtureShock-New-Thinking-About-Children/dp/0446504130/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417018043&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=nurtureshock</a><br></div><div>on kids and lying. Nurtureshock is not on its face an unschooling book, but it is not inconsistent with unschooling, particularly in that its primary focus is fact-based responses to &quot;common knowledge,&quot; and it turns a lot of &quot;common knowledge&quot; on its head. It also helps get your head around what to do with new information. Kinda like this list! :)</div><div><br></div><div>One of the things that they point out in their analysis is that little kids are literalists, and thus are deeply influenced/affected by all the semi-truths and white lies that swirl around them. In the medicalized and chaotic world your little girl is coming from, her feelings that the world has not been honest with her could be profound, and she could be reflecting this. One example from the book was an almost-6-year-old child who got very angry with his/her (can&#39;t remember which) mother for saying something about him being 6 (in reference to what type of game someone else should bring, the mother said &quot;oh, something age-appropriate for a 6-year-old, or something like that). The mother wasn&#39;t even thinking about it, and certainly wasn&#39;t lying, per se, but the kid called her out because, really, it wasn&#39;t true that the child was 6. If your little girl has spent her life fielding half-truths and un-truths (this won&#39;t hurt, this will only hurt for a minute, you&#39;re safe here, etc. etc.), she may be trying to process now what&#39;s the difference between truth and lies, where&#39;s the line, what is reality. Does that make sense? </div><div><br></div><div>Also, her need for attention and affirmation is probably profound (my own kids have talked about injuries that they never had, or that were nowhere near as injurious as they would have others believe, and I believe that stems from a desire for connection to the person they&#39;re talking to -- Hey! I had that same injury! -- and/or a desire for attention -- Hey! I was wounded! Comfort me! -- and they haven&#39;t seen nearly the trauma that your little girl has. Her need for affirmation and comfort and love is probably heartbreakingly deep. </div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, I would read that. They give a lot of good advice about how to address your own language around truth and lying, and how to address it when you see/hear it in your kid. Also a lot of comforting information about why kids lie, and when they lie, and what it says about their development. There is a lot about what your little girl is doing that is completely normal/common/healthy, despite the unique (or, sadly, not unique enough) experiences she has had, and they have good advice for how to address it so as to emphasize that you value truth-telling. And we need to be much more aware of how much adults tend to lie to and around children, and cut it out if we want them to be honest with us. As with all values, you have to live it if you want your kids to believe that you value it. </div><div><br></div><div>Strength, </div><div>Kimberley </div><div><br></div>-- <br><div class="ygrps-yiv-1616820516gmail_signature"><div dir="ltr"><span style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;border-collapse:collapse;line-height:15px;">“It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate<br>between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the<br>vital connection between them.”<br>-- Leo F.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1844406581">Hello jencookies43,<br>I&#39;m so moved by your daughter&#39;s story.&nbsp; She&#39;s suffered more in her 4 years than many do in a lifetime!&nbsp; Her lying just reminded me of an author I heard interviewed on NPR last year who relayed that as a child, he told stories and people called him a liar... and now he tells stories and people call him a writer!!&nbsp; Ha, ha!&nbsp; That kind of puts things in perspective a little bit!&nbsp; <br><br>Then, I had the thought that perhaps you could get her a blank notebook (maybe with a pretty picture on top to make it look special) and invite her to &quot;write&quot; stories just like the books writers make.&nbsp; She would dictate stories to you and you write them down.&nbsp; You can point out to her that the stories can be real or pretend... just like in real books!&nbsp; This could lead to natural discussions about what is real and what is pretend.&nbsp; She may not accurately distinguish the two (or want to) but she&#39;ll understand the concept.&nbsp; It would be fun and perhaps therapeutic for her to illustrate the stories as well.&nbsp; I have a notebook of stories that I wrote and illustrated in second and third grade that I read occasionally to my now 6 year old boy and he loves it and has &quot;written&quot; (dictated) and illustrated some of his own.&nbsp; He asked me to illustrate some and write my own stories in his notebook too so it has been a fun collaborative activity.&nbsp; I just had another thought that you could purchase the notebook together so that she could choose the cover that she likes.&nbsp; OR, create your own cover!&nbsp; The possibilities are endless to turn her imagination into fun, creative activities!!<br><br>The only other thing I can think of is that when my son said things that were clearly not true and intended to avoid something he did or didn&#39;t want to do, I would just give him a sly, playful look and say &quot;are you tricking me?&quot;&nbsp; He would always laugh and admit it.&nbsp; But my son doesn&#39;t have a history of trauma like your daughter does so I don&#39;t know if it would be useful.&nbsp; But worth a try if she seems to be using not telling the truth to artificially adjust reality to her wishes.<br><br>Best,<br>Jenn <br>a newly unschooling Mom</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928560179">It is developmentally completely normal for 3 year olds (and 4 year olds, and 5 year olds) to lie. They are at an age when they are experimenting with what you know and what they know, and whether you know what they know. This is probably particularly important for her, since you were not around when all these things were happening to her so she has very little idea what you really might know. Lying at this age is not something you have to &#39;do&#39; anything about for most children, they grow out of it when in a supportive environment.  So I would see it as normal experimentation, rather than as meaning that there is something wrong with her, whether it be due to genetics or environment. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, she has had a really difficult start to life and as such the lying might have more significance than it would for another child. I would pay attention to it, but not in a &#39;how can I change this&#39; way but more as an insight into how she is processing her experiences and what her fears might be right now. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like her physical and medical needs have had priority in her life up to now and that her emotional needs may not have received as much attention.  It is possible that as she feels more secure with you her emotional needs will become more obvious - meaning that her behaviour may become more challenging.  Again, focusing on connection and attachment will be important in helping you all manage the repercussions of what happened to her when she was tiny. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am not clear from your post what the &#39;chronic lying&#39; is about on a daily basis. Apart from saying the foster mother hurt her, what is she lying about? Are there themes you can identify - e.g is she hiding things from you - might she be afraid you will take things away? Is she lying about her behaviour - might she be fearful you will send her back to hospital if she is &#39;bad&#39;?  Is she trying to make sense of what happened to her - medical treatment to young children may well feel like someone is hurting them deliberately?<br/>
<br/>
It is possible to reflect back without confirming what she says - you could say something like &#39;it felt like your foster mother hurt you when your leg was hurting&#39;.  I would ask yourself in each moment  how you can connect to her experience and build a relationship with her, rather than what you can do about her lying. <br/>

When she is much older, if she is still telling this story, I would help her understand (maybe through therapy) that she was suffering, but not because of a leg broken at the hands of another person, but because of everything she was experiencing in her young life, which was no less serious.</font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font face="arial, sans-serif">I believe she&#39;s not lying to be deceitful.&nbsp; It sounds to me like she&#39;s telling stories to help people understand her internal state.&nbsp; I think the best thing you could do for her is to help heal that pain by giving her a lot of love and positive, empowering attention.&nbsp; I love the book &quot; I Like Myself&quot; by Karen Beaumont:<br><br><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/I-Like-Myself-Karen-Beaumont/dp/0152020136/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1417106363&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=i+like+myself" style="color:rgb(17, 85, 204);">http://www.amazon.com/I-Like- Myself-Karen-Beaumont/dp/ 0152020136/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp; qid=1417106363&amp;sr=8-1&amp; keywords=i+like+myself</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font face="arial, sans-serif"><br></font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><font face="arial, sans-serif">Ethan used to love it too, especially the ending.&nbsp; We used to say it aloud together.&nbsp; I have fond memories of that.</font></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-family:arial, sans-serif;">Maybe picking up some picture books from the library about lying and the consequences of lying might help if the story telling continues.&nbsp; Maybe a movie or tv show.&nbsp; Humourous ones would be a great way to keep it light.&nbsp; Introduce them casually, without direct reference to her actions.&nbsp; One here, one there, in and among all the other fun reading and activities you will get to do with her in the days to come. &nbsp;<br><br>As you mentioned too, it could be from the drugs she was exposed to during her treatments.&nbsp; I recently visited my mom who was in the hospital being treated for a broken sacrum.
