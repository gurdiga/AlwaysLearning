<div id="ygrps-yiv-670863155">and you&#39;d like to visit the coast off 101, we&#39;re about 6 hours from San Francisco and 2 hours from the border (of Oregon, that is). Stop by! We have a teeny house, but there are lots of places to camp in the vicinity, and some fun people to meet.<br/>
<br/>
And if you want to see where I live, go see The Majestic. They were here for months filming earlier this year. Or Outbreak, a lot of the outdoor scenes were filmed here too. My house is in Outbreak for about 1 tenth of a second.<br/>
