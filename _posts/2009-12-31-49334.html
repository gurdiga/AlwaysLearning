<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118800626">Yes, yelling seems to happen with kids at one time or another. Like Sandra said there are some that use the term &quot;indoor voices&quot; I&#39;m one of those... it worked for my kids and it works with other kids as well. It&#39;s an easy concept for kids to grasp.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
With my own children, I use the &quot;walk in the other person&#39;s shoe&quot; way as often as possible. So if they yelled inappropriately (and we were alone at home) sometimes, I would answer yelling. It gave them pause and they would think about volume before doing that again. Or I would ask, what kind of voice is that? Indoor voice or Outdoor voice? Mostly my kids were unaware that they had become loud. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Elijah has very sensitive hearing so I&#39;ve been protective of him in that way and on occasion have asked other children when they&#39;re screaming in a building to stop, other times I&#39;ve opted to leave the building (yes, Kate has left the building ;) just like Elvis). <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
A few weeks ago when at a homeschool xmas party in a community room (with businesses within ear-shot and we want to use this room again) some kids were running and yelling - the moms were deep in conversation, so I motioned to the kids, got them in a huddle and whispered, &quot;Do we like this place?&quot; They all whispered, &quot;yes&quot;. &quot;Then we need to remember we&#39;re inside, not outside.&quot; They whispered, &quot;Oh yeah&quot; and &quot;we forgot.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One of the keys to my children has been presenting the same message in a variety of ways, instead of repeating the same phrase over and over - however, when you find a phrase that works, for me, Indoor voice or Outdoor voice, use it well and then then it won&#39;t be often. <br/>

Good points!<br/>
<br/>
Explaining why and how keeps it from being &quot;a rule&quot; and gives them the  <br/>
tools to make conscious decisions in various situations.<br/>

If &quot;inside voice&quot; is helpful and the kids understand it, that&#39;s  <br/>
great.  It is better for them to understand what and why and what the  <br/>
parent intends by &quot;inside voice, because sometimes it&#39;s okay to be  <br/>
loud inside (a puppet show, or singing full voice) and sometimes it&#39;s  <br/>
not okay to be loud outside (a graveside service, or walking around  <br/>
after 10:00 at night in a quiet neighborhood, or during an outdoor  <br/>
wedding ceremony).<br/>

So, what do unschooling parents do in situations like that, if the child <br/>
won&#39;t be quiet at night in the neighborhood or during an outdoor wedding <br/>
ceremony?  I haven&#39;t encountered it so much yet with my daughter, but I <br/>
can imagine that some time she might not want to quiet down.  What if <br/>
she wanted to be loud, and didn&#39;t want to leave?  Would you pick up a <br/>
child and just take them out of earshot or home?   As you&#39;ve said <br/>
before, its a bit of a difficult task sometimes to take out the <br/>
authoritarian and punitive stuff and figure out what to replace it with!</div>

Don&#39;t set them up for failure.  If you&#39;re a team with your child and  <br/>
your husband or your best friend or a houseguest, don&#39;t choose places  <br/>
to go where they can&#39;t be comfortable or behave appropriately, because  <br/>
it reflects on the whole team.<br/>

I absolutely would.  Especially for a wedding.  There aren&#39;t re-dos on  <br/>
weddings.  If a kid in the wedding party (flower girl, ring bearer)  <br/>
gets loud, that&#39;s a whole different deal than if an uninvolved guest- <br/>
child gets too rowdy.<br/>

<br/>
If you can avoid those situations, that&#39;s best.  If you can&#39;t and your child is being loud in a place they shouldn&#39;t, then you should remove them.  If I&#39;m in a movie theater and there is a noisy child disrupting the movie, I&#39;d really like it if the parent takes them out, even if they are crying louder as they go.  I would do that if one of my young kids were being loud in a movie theater.  I used to take Margaux to movies when she was a baby and nurse her to keep her quiet.  When she was a bit older and wasn&#39;t able to sit through a movie quietly, I&#39;d take a bathroom break or a snack bar break or whatever and miss a portion of the movie so that others around us wouldn&#39;t have to miss the movie because of one noisy and disruptive child.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s not a punishment to leave a place, then a child will learn to leave easier as they go along, or learn to be quieter if they really want to stay somewhere.  The best case scenario is to not take a child or put them in a situation in which they can&#39;t behave in the expected way without an out.  If it can&#39;t be avoided go prepared with lots of quiet distractions and little snacks.  I used to always carry a purse with lots of goodies in it, both food and items for just those emergencies that couldn&#39;t be avoided, as does happen occasionally.<br/>
