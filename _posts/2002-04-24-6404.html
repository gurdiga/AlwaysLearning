 </span></blockquote>&lt;&lt;Pam, this information is very helpful.  Do you think all children <br/>
have these traits naturally.  If not, will they strive for <br/>
improvement in these areas on their own given support? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Those traits will develop naturally in the course of the children doing what <br/>
they love and from their taking advantage of natural opportunities in their <br/>
lives.  They don&#39;t need to &quot;strive for improvement,&quot; the same way they didn&#39;t <br/>
need to &quot;strive to learn to speak English.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
The best support a parent can give a child learning to speak English is to <br/>
speak happily of many things, to respond to his questions, to expose him to <br/>
other uses of language (poetry, songs, plays, word games), other accents, <br/>
funny rhymes...<br/>
<br/>
The best support a teenager can get for developing as a whole person is to be <br/>
treated as a person with a life instead of a future-person in preparation for <br/>
a life which might begin (if he&#39;s ready) when he&#39;s 18.<br/>
<br/>
Modelling language with proper grammar is a good way for parents to help kids <br/>
with grammar.<br/>
<br/>
Modelling curiosity, joy in life, responsibility, punctuality and so forth is <br/>
the most support a child needs.  (Well, that and his own alarm clock, and the <br/>
ways and means to pursue the curiosity and joys.)<br/>
