&gt;     Connie I applaud you for being on the slopes. I&#39;m way too afraid of<br/>

for the first time on Xmas day (after my marriage ended, and the kids were at <br/>
dad&#39;s), a friend invited me to join their family to ski.  I am a chicken, and <br/>
never have been very athletic, but I did like it, and have continued.  I&#39;m <br/>
slow and careful, but love being on the mountain, and having that sport to do <br/>
with my kids, and other friends-or by myself-it is very peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
ps- I do have very long hair - which might make up for being short!!  :-)<br/>
