showing the parents wheeling down the aisles singing while the kids drag and <br/>
mope about going back to school? <br/>

Ugh!<br/>

There was one this fall for Gateway computers (I think) where two young<br/>
teens are in the back seat of the car, dressed in summer clothes chanting,<br/>
&quot;We&#39;re going to the water park!&quot;  over and over.  Then they notice books,<br/>
lunches, and backpacks on the floor.  The door locks go down, the door<br/>
handle breaks off, the windows won&#39;t go down, and the kids start screaming,<br/>
&quot;NOOOOOOOOOO&quot; with their faces pressed to the glass, realizing they can&#39;t<br/>
escape.  Dad in the front seat has a smile on his face.<br/>

up, made and ran those ads, and that others probably<br/>
enjoy them.  I guess I am far enough away from the<br/>
mainstream not to even find that remotely funny as<br/>
black comedy.  It&#39;s like making fun of a rape, or a<br/>
mugging.  It perpetuates and validates the abuse of<br/>
children&#39;s rights.  It wrenches my heart for those<br/>
poor kids who live in a world where they have no<br/>
voice, no defenses, no choices, no respect.  Kids: The<br/>
last greatly abused minority.<br/>
