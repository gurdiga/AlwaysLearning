<div id="ygrps-yiv-221062980">Anyone here ever been to the Maryland Home Ed conference?<br/>
I hear it has an unschooling slant, and a friend of mine has asked me <br/>
to meet her there.  I was wondering if anyone from this list is <br/>
going, or has anyone gone before.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Joanna</div>
