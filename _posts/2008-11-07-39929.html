<div id="ygrps-yiv-355519507">hi,<br/>
<br/>
my family has been invited to a native american festival next week.  it looks fun and exciting and i&#39;m sure my children (ages 10, 7, 4 and 1) and i will enjoy it immensely!<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m looking for help from the wise members of this list...here is my dilemma:  <br/>
<br/>
sadly, my childrens&#39; only direct exposure to native americans has been through disney&#39;s peter pan and pocahontas movies.  they have been asking questions about the festival and, of course, they are expecting to see stereotypical images there.<br/>
<br/>
i&#39;m hoping someone here can give ideas for books, videos, etc which will hold their interest and give a more realistic portrayal of the lives of the people on a whole. because they are now interested,  i would like to introduce them to america&#39;s true history, (without being too scary or too graphic for my sensitive 10yo son) and give them some nuggets of info which will help them understand a little bit of the history of these beautiful people.<br/>
<br/>
if they are still interested, i would like to continue this with them through the thanksgiving holidays so that they can begin to understand the misconceptions taught in history to their schooled friends (indian/pilgrim type stuff).<br/>
<br/>
can anyone share their favorite resources?  i&#39;m sure i&#39;m missing something.  in my conversations with them, i don&#39;t feel confident with my answers to their questions.  thanks in advance for any ideas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124745737">If you go to my blog (www.iggyjingles.blogspot.com) you will see a doll I <br/>
just made. It is for a wedding present and in the blurb are some links to <br/>
the wedding performed by a Native American shaman in Sedona, AZ. It was very <br/>
cool and different. Follow the links from my page and the wedding&#39;s pages <br/>
and there are some paths to cool Native American spirituality sites such as <br/>
Kokopelli and the Spider Woman.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m telling you this circuitous path rather than just posting the links <br/>
because a) I want to show off my art doll, and b) I think it is interesting <br/>
to see some contemporary Native Americans celebrating and sharing their <br/>
culture in this unique way.<br/>
<br/>
I always tell Jayn (9) that Pocahontas was a real person, but that this <br/>
Disney story isn&#39;t how it all happened. There is a lot of stuff about <br/>
Thanksgiving too. I personally think it is important to recognize that <br/>
&quot;Native American&quot; is not one big homogenous group. Different tribes in <br/>
different parts of the country lived very different kinds of lives, <br/>
influenced strongly by geography.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn is also getting more interested in Kaya the American Girl character. <br/>
Somewhere back in the Funkhouser line (dh&#39;s mother&#39;s family) Jayn has at <br/>
least one Native American ancestor.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1269468489">ah, thank you, katy!!!<br/>
<br/>
i was worried about using the kids&#39; books at the library but hadn&#39;t considered books by native american authors...duh!  can you hear me smacking my forehead??!!!<br/>
<br/>
we are in north alabama, so i&#39;m assuming there will be people of local descent (cherokee and choctow, maybe?)  i haven&#39;t been able to find anything online about the festival itself.  <br/>
<br/>
the friend who invited us went last year and is a very traditional homeschooler.  so her 14yo son has been through the conservative christian curriculum. she said to expect dancing, food and demonstrations.  last year the kids threw spears at targets.  that&#39;s all i know!<br/>
<br/>
thanks, too, for the addams family suggestion.  my husband is a huge fan, so i&#39;m sure he&#39;ll remember the episode and we&#39;ll be able to find it!<br/>
<br/>
:)  kelli<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;they have been asking questions about the festival and, of course, they are expecting to see stereotypical images there.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What type of festival? The traditions of the different groups/tribes can vary widely. I don&#39;t really have any ideas for a quick introduction into Native Americans in general. My family has been pretty surrounded by Native culture all of my life, both due to location and my dad&#39;s job. We live in southern New Mexico, very close to the Mescalero Apache Nation, and my dad worked with the tribe quite a bit and had many friends on the reservation. <br/>
We also have close friends whom we consider family who are Laguna Pueblo (mom is Laguna, dad is Spanish, actually). Apache and Pueblo traditions are very different. <br/>
I don&#39;t know as much about the traditions of the other Native peoples in the US as I do Apache and Pueblo.<br/>
<br/>
I would search online for the specific festival that you will be attending. Since it is a festival, there will probably be more stereotypical images present than usual. Many may be in full ceremonial clothing. I have met people though, who came to the southwest truly expecting all indians they met to be wearing deerskin dresses and feathers. <br/>
<br/>
Here is a website that gives a history of the Mescalero:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.innofthe">http://www.innofthe</a> mountaingods. com/mescalerohis tory1.asp&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.innofthe">http://www.innofthe</a> mountaingods. com/mescalerohis tory1.asp&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And here is a website with some info about the Laguna and other Pueblos:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.indianpu">http://www.indianpu</a> eblo.org/ 19pueblos/ laguna.html&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.indianpu">http://www.indianpu</a> eblo.org/ 19pueblos/ laguna.html&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The library should have children&#39;s stories by Native American authors, and about their beliefs and traditional life. We have tons of them, ones I see in this room are <br/>
Snail Girl Brings Water, a Navajo story, retold by Geri Keams<br/>
Little Man&#39;s Family (also Navajo), by J.B. Enochs<br/>
Circle of Wonder: A Native American Christmas Story, by N. Scott Momaday (Jemez Pueblo story, there is another version also that I haven&#39;t seen) <br/>
Sing Down the Rain, by Judy Moreillon (Papago)<br/>
Antelope Woman, an Apache Folktale, by Michael Lacapa<br/>
<br/>
The scene in the Addams Family Values where Wednesday and Pugsly are in the Thanksgiving play is great, that could be an opening to talk about Thanksgiving myths. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652907057">-=-i&#39;m hoping someone here can give ideas for books, videos, etc  <br/>
which will hold their interest and give a more realistic portrayal of  <br/>
the lives of the people on a whole. because they are now interested,   <br/>
i would like to introduce them to america&#39;s true history,-=-<br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t need a lot of history to understand food and dances.   <br/>
Don&#39;t overdo it.  Let them learn from the festival itself.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could tell them that the people who used to wear armor and  <br/>
live in castles became the same people who drive cars and ride trains  <br/>
now, and it&#39;s the same with Native Americans, generally.  They once  <br/>
lived another way and now they live pretty much like other people.   <br/>
If you&#39;re in northern New Mexico or Arizona, there are still older  <br/>
people living in the old pueblo buildings or hogans, but they&#39;re  <br/>
probably very near younger relatives who have washing machines and  <br/>
computers, and they  probably have TV and radio in the older house.   <br/>
Running water and electricity, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
But if you talk about that, tell them there are also still older  <br/>
people whose greaty great grandparents were European or African and  <br/>
they might also be living in really old houses without fancy  <br/>
bathrooms (maybe outhouses) and such, so it&#39;s not limited to just  <br/>
Native Americans.  And most of the people still living those ways are  <br/>
great grandparents.<br/>
<br/>
Rather than speaking of full history of Native Americans (which isn&#39;t  <br/>
ever going to be &quot;full history,&quot; but a series of various approaches),  <br/>
it might be best to talk generally of changing cultures.<br/>
<br/>
-=-i&#39;m hoping someone here can give ideas for books, videos, etc  <br/>
which will hold their interest and give a more realistic portrayal of  <br/>
the lives of the people on a whole. because they are now interested-=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask at the library.  There was a book when my children were  <br/>
younger called &quot;Children Just Like Me,&quot; I think, and that one might  <br/>
be great to look at.  There was a Navajo kid (Pueblo maybe, but I  <br/>
think Navajo) with a Gameboy and kids from other places all over the  <br/>
world, with photos of their parents and siblings and houses.<br/>
<br/>
There was a book in those days too called Material World and I bet  <br/>
there&#39;s a website of some of that.<br/>
<br/>
-=-if they are still interested, i would like to continue this with  <br/>
them through the thanksgiving holidays so that they can begin to  <br/>
understand the misconceptions taught in history to their schooled  <br/>
friends (indian/pilgrim type stuff).-=-<br/>
<br/>
Be careful of replacing one set of stories with another.  Try to say  <br/>
there&#39;s confusion and there was then too, and conflicting accounts,  <br/>
and people can never really know what happened  exactly in history.   <br/>
Set the stage for their curiosity or things they can connect to, but  <br/>
to say &quot;That is a lie, and here s the truth&quot; is probably not a good  <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
-=-in my conversations with them, i don&#39;t feel confident with my  <br/>
answers to their questions.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Google.<br/>
Maybe go to U.K. google and look for English sites.  Their kids&#39;  <br/>
history is WAY better than ours, generally, and their ways of  <br/>
describing native American (and first nations, as they&#39;re called in  <br/>
Canada) is clearer than anything I&#39;ve ever seen in the U.S.<br/>

And language and religion.  All different.<br/>
<br/>
Navajos and Apaches are related.  Some of the northern pueblos along  <br/>
the Rio Grande have the same languages, and some have related but  <br/>
different languages.  The dances are more similar than the speech.   <br/>
The traditional feast-day foods are the same.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d look online, lightly (no in-depth analysis) and maybe see what  <br/>
the library might have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-93667166">Here&#39;s a site which explains pow-wows (I&#39;m sending the &quot;etiquette&quot;  <br/>
page, but look at the sidebars on the left about halfway down &quot;What is  <br/>
a Pow-wow?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.powwows.com/info/?p=45">http://www.powwows.com/info/?p=45</a><br/>
<br/>
My dd and I went to a pow-wow in WA a couple of years ago during a  <br/>
bald eagle festival. We had a wonderful time and felt very welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Go to Oyate.org for more really good Native American (and First  <br/>
Nations from Canada) resources - lots of Thanksgiving-related stuff:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oyate.org/catalog/index.html">http://www.oyate.org/catalog/index.html</a><br/>
<br/>
If you have the inclination, purchase &quot;The Dead Dog Cafe Comedy Hour&quot;  <br/>
CD. I used to listen to it on CBC in Canada - it&#39;s brilliant!  <br/>
Directed, produced and acted by First Nations people. There&#39;s a &quot;Spin  <br/>
the Wheel for Authentic Indian Names&quot; segment which used to be online,  <br/>
as well as on the radio. My name is &quot;Crystal Rosewood Lips&quot; &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.oyate.org/catalog/humor.html">http://www.oyate.org/catalog/humor.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I also love reading the reviews on that page for the &quot;Caucasian  <br/>
Americans&quot; workbook and &quot;10 Little White People.&quot; Snort-worthy....<br/>
<br/>
I like Sherman Alexie&#39;s work. He has a new book out for young adults  <br/>
&quot;The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian.&quot; Two movies of his  <br/>
&quot;Smoke Signals&quot; and &quot;The Business of Fancy Dancing&quot; you might want to  <br/>
watch on your own first, as your 10 year old is sensitive to certain  <br/>
themes. You can check out reviews on Amazon or Blockbuster. Alexie  <br/>
also writes some great poetry.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, while searching around, I found this blog written by Debbie Reese,  <br/>
a Nambe Pueblo Indian woman. It has lots of possibilities!<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/">http://americanindiansinchildrensliterature.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
My dd&#39;s heritage on her dad&#39;s side is Nez Perce, so we got into  <br/>
American Girl dolls for a few years. Kaya is the doll and her story is  <br/>
told in a series of books. They might be at the library, certainly  <br/>
some are at bookstores, and definitely on the American Girl website.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, you might want to read the review of the Kaya books  <br/>
on Ms. Reese&#39;s website (written by Barbara Slapin from &quot;A Broken  <br/>
Flute: The Native Experience in Books for Children&quot;). There are  <br/>
definitely errors in those books, some serious, some not. Still, I&#39;d  <br/>
say they are better than Pocahontas.<br/>
<br/>
We also purchased a couple of books that provide overviews of culture,  <br/>
tribes, nations and history: DK Eye Witness Books &quot;North American  <br/>
Indian&quot; and Franklin Watts (publisher) &quot;How Would You Survive As An  <br/>
American Indian?&quot; (both originally published in the UK). I think these  <br/>
are relatively easy to find, but I can&#39;t vouch for their complete  <br/>
authenticity. We also have a number of books about the Inuit in  <br/>
Canada, written by Inuit authors, but they&#39;re not easy to find.  <br/>
Oyate&#39;s probably your best bet.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and while I think of it, if your kids aren&#39;t interested, you can  <br/>
still be!<br/>

my kids are asking hard questions, so i told them we would get more information from the library and look for dvd&#39;s to rent online.  the trail of tears runs through where we live (the path of the creek indians, anyway).  within an hour&#39;s drive are the indian mounds, part of the railroad route and several museums with native american artifacts.  there are also several historic marker locations.  i&#39;m sure we will find enough locally to feed their interests, assuming they don&#39;t end with the festival!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-500746120">I have beautiful Apache Tears that my grandfather gave me. Having those around has sparked conversations both about myths and about the Trail of Tears, initially, and then as I thought about where the Apache live and realized that they wouldn&#39;t have walked that Trail I looked it up on the internet and discovered the specifics it of the story. <br/>
<br/>
I really like Louise Erdrich&#39;s books. She has a lot of novels about a group of related and unrelated individuals living on an Anishinaabe reservation in North Dakota that are really good and well developed. She has also written a few children&#39;s books. She has a series called Little Frog that begins with The Birchbark House, the only one I&#39;ve read. Again, it&#39;s a really well told story of an Ojibwa family life.<br/>
<br/>
When I was young one of my favorite books was about a girl named Mary Jemison. She was a child of parents who had immigrated from Ireland to America and were living in Pennsylvania. They were attacked by Shawnee Indians, and most of the family were killed. Mary, however, survived and was sold to two Seneca sisters whose brother had been killed and who adopted Mary. I have more than one version of her life, they are both children stories. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.letchworthparkhistory.com/jem.html">http://www.letchworthparkhistory.com/jem.html</a> is a small biography of her life. Oh, wow, here is the book of her life: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/bl_nlmj00.htm.">http://womenshistory.about.com/library/etext/bl_nlmj00.htm.</a> <br/>
<br/>
There is a fantastic book that I read a few years ago called 1491: New Revelations of the Americas before Christopher Columbus. Oh, it is a really good book about what life was like in the Americas prior to &quot;discovery&quot;. It&#39;s isn&#39;t romantic, it isn&#39;t a lens painted with vaseline that makes you think of Native Americans as less or more than other people. I really liked that book. <br/>

i spent a long time at the oyate site--thanks for sending the link. they have a list of &quot;not recommended&quot; books, and i was surprised at how many of the titles were familiar to me.  i was not familiar with the list of books which were recommended.  my 10yo son was interested in the childrens&#39; stories there.<br/>
<br/>
my kids are asking hard questions, so i told them we would get more information from the library and look for dvd&#39;s to rent online.  the trail of tears runs through where we live (the path of the creek indians, anyway).  within an hour&#39;s drive are the indian mounds, part of the railroad route and several museums with native american artifacts.  there are also several historic marker locations.  i&#39;m sure we will find enough locally to feed their interests, assuming they don&#39;t end with the festival!<br/>
<br/>
thanks for the suggestions,<br/>
