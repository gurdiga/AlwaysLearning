<div id="ygrps-yiv-237641063">&lt;&lt;Just be really careful if you spend time on the alt.med.fibromyalgia newsgroup&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That format is so difficult for me to understand!  I much prefer an email list. It seems to make more sense.  I can&#39;t figure out who is posting to what or where or why.  Does that format get easier over time?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I haven&#39;t found a fibro list I liked, so I do the newsgroup thing.  The way <br/>
my reader (Forte Free Agent) is set up, you first download all the new <br/>
headers for each group you&#39;re &quot;subscribed&quot; to.  Subscribing just means <br/>
you&#39;ve set up your reader to check that group.  The headers show the <br/>
subject line and who the post is from.  Then you mark the ones you want for <br/>
download.  I imagine it works differently with different readers.  Free <br/>
Agent is free if you want to try it.  I&#39;ve been using it for years now.<br/>
