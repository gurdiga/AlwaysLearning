wrote back that she really appreciated it and that she would try to look more <br/>
closely at what the kids DO know, rather than what they do not know. I had <br/>
also added some stuff about how grandmothers can be supportive and she seemed <br/>
to really like some of my ideas. She said she felt much better and more <br/>
positive. I think we were right that this IS an unschooling mom and a <br/>
grandmother who just didn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; but I was pleasantly surprised at how <br/>
willing she was to be &quot;educated.&quot;<br/>
