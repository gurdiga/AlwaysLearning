<div id="ygrps-yiv-1952106400">Sounds like DH&#39;s father&#39;s family.  Tha annual family<br/>
&quot;reunion&quot;.....is interesting.  The count was higher,<br/>
for a while, but as they age and pass over....<br/>
of course, we get to hear more &quot;stories&quot; with some<br/>
family members not present...and me only being in the<br/>
family by marraige, I get to hear more :-) as it is<br/>
not assumed that I already know. But intoverts all. <br/>
They eat, visit two hours, and run away. Poof. Gone.<br/>
