Where do you get that info. then?<br/>
I&#39;m one of those that is inclined to unsubscribe, for the simple fact<br/>
that my time online is severely limited right now and it&#39;s SOOOoooo<br/>
easy to have all my groups at Yahoo. It may have it&#39;s quirks, but it&#39;s<br/>
easy for me right now.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m having such a difficult time making the conversion, surely<br/>
there are others?<br/>

Hi all! Yep, as of just a minute ago, there were 1212 members at UD.  <br/>
You can find this info on the Unschooling Discussion group page...at <br/>
the top of the page (right under Unschooling Discussion) there are <br/>
three options:  Start a new topic, Unsub or change membership, and <br/>
About Group.  If you click on About Group, it&#39;ll take you to the page <br/>
with group numbers, description of the group, archives, and even top <br/>
posters for the month (I think that&#39;s a really cool feature...I dunno <br/>
why). ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Ren, this is what I did to help with the move.  I already had a gmail <br/>
account that I wasn&#39;t using much, so I went ahead and joined UD under <br/>
that account (autodidactsanonymous) and unsubbed my yahoo ID.  I have <br/>
a <br/>
little Gmail letter icon to announce when there&#39;s new mail on the <br/>
bottom of my screen, and I click on that to open up gmail (in a new <br/>
window).  I&#39;ve found that I really like the way gmail works, and I&#39;ve <br/>
joined a couple of other groups with my gmail account so I can read <br/>
my &quot;daily&quot; groups right from gmail.  These groups include *this* one <br/>
(yes, I still have the yahoo account, I had forgotten about that), <br/>
Unschooling Discussion, and Shine.  There were times in the past <br/>
(when <br/>
all my groups were on yahoo) when I felt *completely* overwhelmed <br/>
with <br/>
too many emails.  I would go back and forth, changing my membership <br/>
from digest to read on list only, then back to individual posts.I <br/>
don&#39;t like reading my fave unschooling lists on <br/>
digest...I just feel like I miss too much, and I&#39;d rather have each <br/>
post separate.  NOW, it seems easier to me...Gmail pops up, and I <br/>
read <br/>
my &quot;conversations&quot; together.  There are features of google groups <br/>
that <br/>
I still haven&#39;t played around with, and I&#39;m certainly no expert, but <br/>
I <br/>
just wanted to share what I had done to &quot;help with the move&quot;, on my <br/>
end.  Something to think about, maybe?  I&#39;d sure hate to lose <br/>
your voice on *any* of my lists!<br/>

I personally hate Gmail.  I wont use it.  The  google groups i am fine with.  <br/>
They seem just like Yahoo to me.  I  dont do the digest i get each e-mail so <br/>
it wasnt any differnt from google to  yahoo group mail for me.  My husband <br/>
uses gmail and has since the beta came  out.  I tried it for about a day LOL.  <br/>
And hated it.  But i also  dont like yahoo mail. I prefer the way AOL does mail <br/>
over everything  else.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Try not to use the word &quot;hate&quot; on this list if you can help it.  It  <br/>
will be an exercise in choosing words with care.  Save &quot;hate&quot; for  <br/>
life threatening things and you might find you never really have the  <br/>
feeling of &quot;hate&quot; at all.<br/>
<br/>
You might hate me pointing this out, but it will be better for the  <br/>
list and better for your kids.<br/>
<br/>
Now let&#39;s not talk about the relative merits of different e-mail  <br/>
programs!<br/>
<br/>
The list is going to stay here, but it needs to be about unschooling  <br/>
things, and about things we have found useful and useable and likable  <br/>
and happy.<br/>

<br/>
That was sweet, but I&#39;m not much of a &quot;voice&quot; at any lists other than<br/>
Unschooling Basics and Imagination Tribe!!:)<br/>
<br/>
I won&#39;t be much of a voice even if I get comfortable with the Google<br/>
thing. Not enough time right now.<br/>
