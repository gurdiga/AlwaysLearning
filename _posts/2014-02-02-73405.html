<div id="ygrps-yiv-328522112"><p>I have a couple of questions/stumbling blocks right now. We have been unschooling for nearly 3 years.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I have recently come through a months-long depression where I was neglectful of my kids. I was physically present and did my best to continue making small better choices, but as I am coming back to my more normal self, I can see some big problems that my limited participation created.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The first is that life is not sparkly here. It is mostly peaceful and even enjoyable most days, but it isn&#39;t sparkly and we all feel it. Adding to that, or maybe as a result of my depression, the kids (9 and 6) are in a period where they don&#39;t want to leave the house. We had one activity (open gymnastics) that we maintained each week that both girls enjoyed, but that has now been let go because the oldest says she finds it boring because she doesn&#39;t enjoy the company of the other children there.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I find my offers of trying new things rejected by the kids, usually because they don&#39;t want to go out, but also because my oldest doesn&#39;t enjoy trying new things- she is uncomfortable with uncertainty and the possibility she will not be good at something. She also gets carsick on most rides over 30 minutes, so she generally declines anything she doesn&#39;t already find significantly interesting. This can limit my ability to introduce new fun things to both of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The girls&#39; main focus is Minecraft and skyping with other children online, which I also find very fun. I have put my energy into learning enough about servers, mods and game maps to get each their own server, and do my best to maintain them. We only have 2 computers, so I don&#39;t get to play along with them very often, but I am nearby to help, to read things, to reload the map, etc. I watch Minecraft videos with them sometimes and, although I have trouble watching more than 20 minutes (due to motion sickness), I can and do frequently watch short clips of the funny parts they want to share.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>These are some of the ways we are reconnecting as I am finding myself again and my mental health improves. But I want to go farther with bringing the sparkle back. And I am unsure how to accomplish this from inside the house.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The second challenge is that the kids are both night owls. My oldest (9) usually gets tired and goes to bed around 2am, sleeping until about noon. But my little one (6) will frequently stay up all night watching YouTube videos, kissing her dad goodbye in the morning and then heading to sleep at 6 or 7 am, to sleep most of the day. And when they are sleeping for a big part of the day, we aren&#39;t connecting and I feel neglectful and lazy.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>When we have actual plans, like when we were going to gymnastics, I can usually help my youngest fall asleep by midnight so she can get up (and feel pretty good) by 9:30am. But often she will argue, wanting to stay up later, when I know she wont let me wake her in the morning if she stays up too late. And this arguing takes place when I am also tired and wanting to head to bed. I frequently revert to the &quot;for your own good&quot; argument for lack of other, better tools and options, and frankly I would rather stay home than fight over going to bed. But I know there are other options, even though right now I cannot see them.</p><p><br></p><p>It occurred to me a couple of nights ago that I could transition my sleep cycle to match theirs or come a bit closer, so I am not as tired at midnight; so I can be more present and helpful when they are awake, even at night. But I am somewhat resistant to this change- I cannot yet accept it would be ok for a mom of young children to sleep until noon. Even though I can see this would be more helpful overall, I can feel my resistance and have taken only minimal action toward this goal- setting my morning alarm for 10am instead of 9 so I can sleep a little longer and stay awake and moderately functional until 2am.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I really connected to something recently posted to the Unschooling Facebook group: &quot;Unschooling is not &quot;whatever you want honey I&#39;ll be over here doing my own separate thing I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll figure it out.&quot; That would be neglect. We need to consistently be providing something better, richer, interesting, more vivid [than] they would be getting in school. It&#39;s not up our kids to ask for enrichment. It is up to us to provide it.&quot;</p><p><br></p><p>That type of neglect is kind of how it feels right now at my house. And the kids&#39; sleep cycle is part of this issue. Because I am awake hours before the children, doing my own thing and then they are alone once I go to bed. I am uncomfortable with how disconnected I feel from them, even though during the hours we are awake together I am actively helping, providing food/snacks, being present. I think it is not enough time- and in part it is the idea of their ages that makes me uncomfortable. If they were teenagers with night owl schedule, I might feel differently (or not) but I am hung up on their young age and my ideas about &quot;good moms&quot; and how this sleep cycle limits our options for activities with other kids and families.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I would really like some feedback on improving my perspective and on providing vivid, inspiring, sparkly things into our environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p><p><br></p><p>(As a footnote, my depression is clinical and chronic and has been under good control for more than 6 years. This was an unusual challenge and I am steadily getting back to normal.)</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-895537326">Yes. On depression I have found Sandra&#39;s words about avoiding the news, sad movies and sad music to be helpful and came to discover as management strategies in my own life for sake of self preservation.  My ability to tolerate these has learned over the years. I cannot engage in any of the above or else I am overwhelmed with big black clouds that I find hard to push away.  And yes many years ago when I went through a bout of moderately bad depression (and is something I choose to continually manage) i found anti depressants were needed in conjunction with therapy because I found that the medication enabled me to work on the thinking patterns but without the medication I was unable to be receptive to the strategies.</div>

<div>Recently my son has gone through a period of&nbsp;feeling bored, generally 
restless &amp; dissatisfied.&nbsp;One of the things we&#39;ve done is scavange 
pieces from their swing set, which is buried in snow, and bring them into his 
room.&nbsp; We put the rock climbing stuff on the wall (screwed into 
studs).&nbsp; I bought a&nbsp;$3 part&nbsp;from the hardware 
store&nbsp;(&nbsp;IDK what it&#39;s called but it&#39;s basically a big screw with a 
hole at the end of it).&nbsp; My husband screwed it into a stud in my son&#39;s 
bedroom&nbsp;ceiling and we hung a rope swing from it.&nbsp; He just loves 
swinging on that thing!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Watch comedy!&nbsp; Our new favorite show is &quot;Ridiculousness&quot; on MTV.&nbsp; 
It&#39;s basically&nbsp;funny people showing funny clips of people falling and 
hurting themselves, for the most part.&nbsp; But dang it&#39;s funny!&nbsp; My son, 
hubby and I watch it together &amp; we&#39;ll all be rolling.&nbsp; I find it bonds 
us to laugh together and also I sleep so much better after a good laugh.&nbsp; 
There is a related show called &quot;Fantasy Factory&quot; which is also funny &amp; goes 
to show that you&nbsp;CAN make a living watching You Tube videos and spending 
your time doing things you enjoy!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1544808556">I suppose I could put that on a page.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago on a forum I wrote something about happy music instead of sad, comedies instead of dramas.   A mom (someone I know and like) jumped in REALLY angry and said that depression was all biochemical and NOTHING could cheer someone up or stave off that depression.<br/>
<br/>
I knew better from personal experience, and from helping friends.  I could induce depression in friends [if I wanted to, which I do NOT] with just the right messages I know would break their hearts and spirits, and with some well-chosen (or random) local news broadcasts, and being negative everytime I saw them, and ...  I&#39;ll stop there lest someone picture it all too clearly and get on the downhill. If they were smart, they would run me off.<br/>
<br/>

Many of the things we routinely recommend to help unschooling families are also helpful to anyone&#39;s mental health and wellbeing.  Gratitude, recognizing and appreciating abundance, avoiding negativity...<br/>

Feeling like I needed to escape my children created pressure that built until I exploded sometimes. The kind of self-destructive behaviour that comes with depression made me tell myself what a bad mum I was, which, of course, became a self-fulfilling prophecy. I could go on.</span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1699102148Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1699102148Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;">My point is that I reversed patterns that were 25+ years old not with drugs (although I needed them to literally survive my worst ever few months) but with doing masses of work examining and changing my thoughts. Therapy can help this but it didn&#39;t help me - just made me keep living in the past and dwelling on my illness. But I did positive affirmations, listening to upbeat music, dancing, actively telling myself different stories (ie. Swapping &#39;I&#39;m dreading today. I need a break&#39; for &#39;I can&#39;t wait to be with my kids today&#39;) and doing it even when I didn&#39;t feel it and with a smile. All that stuff and others changes your biochemistry. It also doesn&#39;t work overnight, od course, but the &#39;fake it til you make it approach was very powerful for me.</span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1699102148Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;"><br></span></div><div><span class="ygrps-yiv-1699102148Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;">I even pretended I was on a &#39;how to be a fantastic mother&#39; tv show once...guess what?

It details the different neurotransmitters or happy hormones with ideas for how you can support them nutritionally or with supplements to help get you through the really rough patches while you deal with the issues in your life that might be bringing you down.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">A bit more google searching will tell you that meeting small goals will help with dopamine production, even a little bit of exercise will help with serotonin, endorphins and dopamine, connecting with loved ones will elevate your oxytocin. Alongside seeing the abundance in my life and being grateful for it I found having a list of small, actionable things I could do to make myself feel better really helped bring the sparkle back into all our lives - jump on a trampoline for a few minutes, put on some upbeat music, watch Louis C.K. on youtube, drink your favourite juice, call a friend, basically do things that bring joy back into your life and then you might have enough to spread around.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">It sounds like you have been managing your depression for a long time but I put this out there for anyone else on the list who might feel depressed.&nbsp;<br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I love Sandra&#39;s idea to use your upswings if you have them. You might try charting your moods on your calendar so you could stock up on groceries, movies, things to do at home when at a low ebb and plan for fun adventures when back on a up. That might make things feel a bit more manageable.&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">All best with it,&nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Tamara</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764"><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413">-=-&quot;And the kids&#39; sleep cycle is part of this issue. Because I am awake hours before the children, doing my own thing and then they are alone once I go to bed. I am uncomfortable with how disconnected I feel from them, even though during the hours we are awake together I am actively helping, providing food/snacks, being present. I think it is not enough time- and in part it is the idea of their ages that makes me uncomfortable. If they were teenagers with night owl schedule, I might feel differently (or not) but I am hung up on their young age and my ideas about &quot;good moms&quot; and how this sleep cycle limits our options for activities with other kids and families. &quot;
…-=-</div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;">Due to my husband&#39;s work schedule, it has worked best for me to modify my sleep cycle to fit my children&#39;s sleep needs.  My oldest (she will be 9 in May) would never feel comfortable being awake at night if both myself and her father were asleep (though she will read or play quietly for a while in the morning if she wakes before me).  </span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;">Both of my children have changed their sleep patterns throughout the years, sometimes going to sleep around 9pm, more often 11pm-12am, and sometimes staying up until 2am or later.  Currently my youngest (who will be 2 in March) will stay up until 2 am if she was tired enough for a nap during the day.  They are both up until around midnight and wake about 11-13 hours later depending on age/nap. I would not function well if I didn&#39;t adjust my sleep cycle to theirs.  I either go to sleep when the last one has fallen asleep or sometimes I spend some time online or unwind with some media.  </span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;">Even so, I tend to wake naturally 7-9 hours later (too many days with less than 7 hours of sleep makes me grouchy).  It doesn&#39;t always feel proper to me to be waking up so late but the alternative-me being awake while they sleep and vice versa wouldn&#39;t work for our family (when they have shared sleeping space with me, they both have always woken if I leave the room for more than a few minutes. To preserve their sleep I try to stay close).  I have the best days when I get enough sleep but wake up a bit before the youngest so I have time to get myself ready for the day.  </span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;">We try and schedule any appointments (home maintenance, etc at the home or anything outside the home) for the afternoon.  We often ask maintenance personnel to not knock or ring if arriving before noon.  Because my oldest would still not be comfortable being up on her own at night and obviously it would not be safe for my toddler to be on her own at night, I modify my sleep schedule. I have night owl tendencies but I have never had the opportunity to sleep this late until I had children!</span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;"> Even though they sometimes stay up really late I find our present arrangement nets us all with a good amount of sleep.  I already have many fond memories from connecting with both of my kids during their very late nights.  If they are happily playing at something even late at night I can sometimes also sneak in a little laundry, cleaning, etc.  We just consider our days shifted.  An added bonus is both of my girls have more happy awake time in the evening when their dad is home from work, to connect with him. </span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;"><br></span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:1.22;"> Kristi</span></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><br></div><div id="ygrps-yiv-1131924764ygrps-yiv-1121463413"><span style="line-height:16px;">(Edited by Sandra --This came all as one big lump, and I broke it into paragraphs.  I hope I didn&#39;t guess badly.)</span><br></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-811955408"><p>So much of the philosophy of unschooling is relevant to managing depression.</p><p><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Be mindful, make small choices that are better each time. &nbsp;Go slowly and breathe. &nbsp;It takes time for change to happen, whether that is seeing the learning in computer games or climbing out of depression. &nbsp;It is frustrating to be able to see where you want to be and feel that it is a long way away and will take a long time to get to. &nbsp;Rushing won&#39;t get you there any faster. &nbsp;When you rush you get it wrong, you fall down and you have to start again. &nbsp;Sometimes from further away. &nbsp;Accept that you are where you are now and move from there, without rushing. &nbsp;Rushing is stress, tension, haste, tightness. &nbsp;Those feelings will not help you to see clearly or move in the right direction.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Sandra&#39;s right, don&#39;t feed the depression. &nbsp;Don&#39;t face into the dark, you can&#39;t get to where you want to be if you are facing the wrong way. &nbsp;Be mindful of the little things, especially when it is hard. &nbsp;Eating, sleeping, being active... in every area of your life look for the better choice. &nbsp;Each choice is a step, decide where you want to go and make all those little steps lead you in THAT direction. &nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">If your depression is recurrent make the time when you are in a better mental space to work on why. &nbsp;Maybe biology is part of it, but it won&#39;t be all of it. Work out your triggers, and if you are carrying bad things with you find a way to move past them and let them go. &nbsp;Get counselling if you need it. &nbsp;If there is darkness in your past and pain and fear keep biting you in the ass and dragging you back into the dark place then find a way to get past it. &nbsp;Don&#39;t ignore it just because it&#39;s gone for the moment. &nbsp;Slay your demons while you are not depressed because demons are tougher to beat when it is dark. &nbsp;</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Again, unschooling philosophy will help. &nbsp;Fear is fear, and there is a lot of talk on this list about moving past fear. &nbsp;Not by fighting it. &nbsp;Fighting is tense and will bind you closer to your fears. &nbsp;Relax, soften, let the bad things go because you don&#39;t need to keep holding on to them. &nbsp;Turn towards something better.</p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br></p><p style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">Nadia</p></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-358245129"><p dir="ltr">Which came first your depression or the kids migrating to a nighttime schedule? We&#39;re night owls here, but I am a mom that sleeps in with her kids and stays up, mainly because I always have stayed up late. (Husband has a flexible career and mostly works from home, so he shares our schedule.) I think we really have a delayed sleep phase disorder, so even when we try to shift our schedules for a long while i.e months, we never feel rested, are more irritable, and it just really isn&#39;t us. This really impacts our life in society. Because we can&#39;t always get to the fun stuff we&#39;d like to do, things like classes, meet-ups, museum open hours, etc or we have to alter our schedule for a while, which ends up wearing us all out. This happens every summer when kids want to go to summer day camps. And I can begin to feel guilty and sad that we miss out because of our sleep schedule. So I cannot think about what we are missing out on, instead I have to think about what we can do.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Especially if this is new to you, this time change your girls are living, and especially if it is uncomfortable for you to live in their time zone, I imagine this alone could trigger depression. Or at least aid it, since now you are having hours alone, in which you might be missing them, and then they are waking up and wanting to play minecraft, waking too late to go out and really do things, or their lack of desire. (Our girls are 6 &amp; 8, minecraft is #1 here too) Also not being able to participate in their world may also not be helping. Old mac minis can run at the low end of about $250 for the computer alone on eBay. Some Universities sell used parts, monitors, mice, etc. at very inexpensive rates. </p>

<p dir="ltr">It can be depressing to know you miss out on life because of sleep alteration. It can also get that way if you need outings, and aren&#39;t able to get them. What about walks, can you get out at least for yourself and take a walk? Then you could bring things back the girls may find interesting, meanwhile you&#39;d get a moment out and to breathe in fresh air. Also check you vitamin D levels this time of year. Low vitamin D can bring on depression.</p>

<p dir="ltr">I haven&#39;t struggled with deep depression in a very long time. All the therapy advise is invaluable. Before having kids, I went to a cognitive therapist, did homework, found out that I really am responsible for my own feelings, and got a handle on depression. It really changed my outlook. I still get low, still can fall into guilty thoughts about mothering, still need feedback from friends and support. But I can self talk my way out of lows.</p>

<p dir="ltr">My ways to combat the impacts of our altered sleep is that I plan activities when I feel the best, so in your house since you can do mornings, I would look for activities when they feel best. I aim for away from home activities that begin at around 1pm, and at home activities don&#39;t usually begin until 3-5pm. By then they&#39;ve gotten some playtime in, and are ready to chop the day up a little. One of our daughters, at around 9pm, suddenly wakes up, and asks us a lot of questions and wants to make cookies, or bread, which if I was tired at 9 would be miserable for me! So I do wonder if part of their altered schedule could be negatively impacting you.</p>
