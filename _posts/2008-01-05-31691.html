 </span></blockquote>Illiteracy in schooled kids is caused by humiliation: not being able  <br/>
to do what (supposedly) everyone else can. Kids can either give up as  <br/>
failures or decide reading is dumb.<br/>
<br/>
Illiteracy in the world is caused by a lack of support, lack of  <br/>
resources. Without a need to read, without a print rich environment  <br/>
where others are there to offer help and support as someone figures  <br/>
it out, there isn&#39;t a reason to pick it up.<br/>

We don&#39;t need to all agree.<br/>

I have seen my three children learn to read in their own ways, and have documented it i <br/>
public so others who were trying it could be encouraged.  <br/>
<br/>
I have three cats.  They all have tails and four legs.  That doesn&#39;t mean there are no cats <br/>
without tails, and no three-legged cats.<br/>
<br/>
There might be a child who doesn&#39;t learn to read for some reason or combination of <br/>
reasons.  There have always been, and always will be.  Unfortunately, school teaches that if <br/>
a child does what teachers tell them to do, they will learn all the things in those books the <br/>
teachers distribute and then pick back up (or charge for if they&#39;re lost).  Schools teach that <br/>
memorizing phonics rules equals reading.<br/>
<br/>
I would bet big money that in 30 years if an illiterate adult is found in a text-rich culture, <br/>
it will be a person who went to school and was beat down and discouraged, or it&#39;s a <br/>
person with mental or visual processing exceptions and problems.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1808900896">My dad reads better now than he did when I was a kid.<br/>
I remember realizing he was stumbling with his paperwork for something, I<br/>
joyfully jumped in and helped. I didn&#39;t realize it was a cause of<br/>
embarrassment for him.<br/>
My kids wanted to be read to when they were young, and asked him often. I<br/>
think their non-judgment of his skill combined with the bonding of the<br/>
activity gave him the reinforcement he needed. He&#39;s read to me over the<br/>
phone for the first time in the past few years. It&#39;s a cool progression.<br/>
He&#39;s also opened up about other things in his childhood and how they could<br/>
have been handled better; especially bedwetting.<br/>
He was an unexpected support of our lifestyle choices :D Our trust that<br/>
Hayden would read has resulted in Hayden reading. Our trust that Hayden will<br/>
outgrow bedwetting when he&#39;s supposed to, our support and acceptance of the<br/>
process, has avoided giving him a stigma of shame. In both cases, we have<br/>
eliminated the opportunity for Hayden to carry the same scars my Dad has to<br/>
carry around. And given Dad an opportunity to heal by sharing himself with<br/>
us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648441715">Wow, Sandra.  I am glad I read your post.  My daughter is struggling <br/>
with reading.  She will be 9 in April.  I taught public school for 9 <br/>
years before I had her, grades 1-3 during that time period.  I tried <br/>
to teach reading using the whole language approach, but was pretty <br/>
much forced to teach the phonics approach because that was the <br/>
curriculum we had to use, plus the dreaded Iowa tests. <br/>
<br/>
When I decided to homeschool my daughter, of course I took <br/>
the &quot;school&quot; approach (I had not heard of unschooling until this past <br/>
fall).  I think I am a big reason for why she is not reading.  I <br/>
tried everything on that poor child.  She just wasn&#39;t ready to read, <br/>
but I kept forcing her (that was the &quot;teacher devil&quot; in me - as John <br/>
Holt said).  Boy, I tried quite a few programs to no avail.  I even <br/>
thought maybe she had dyslexia and even went to a dyslexia <br/>
conference.  It didn&#39;t seem to really fit, although she has a few of <br/>
the symptoms which probably most kids do at one point or another. <br/>
<br/>
It makes me sad that I didn&#39;t just stop and really look at her and <br/>
see the frustration, sadness, anger, and humiliation she was <br/>
experiencing.  I just kept plugging away saying school teacherish <br/>
things like &quot;You know that word.  You&#39;re just not trying&quot; and &quot;what <br/>
sound does that letter make?&quot;  &quot;Come on!  Just sound it out.&quot;  Of <br/>
course, most of the time I was frustrated as well and I know beyond a <br/>
shadow of a doubt she knew it just based on the tone of my voice.  <br/>
<br/>
When I began reading about unschooling and reading your website, John <br/>
Holt&#39;s books and every other thing I could get my hands on, I guess I <br/>
saw the light.  I backed off completely.  No more workbooks. No more <br/>
forcing her to read aloud to me.  No more turning everything into a <br/>
reading lesson.  She is s-l-o-w-l-y starting to chose to read a few <br/>
very easy books on her own.  I guess in a way, she is having to <br/>
deschool as far as reading goes.  <br/>
<br/>
The amazing thing is that she is so confident with math.  I never <br/>
really did a lot of math instruction with her because I was so intent <br/>
on her learning to read at a young age.  She has no fear of math and <br/>
is always coming up to me with the newest thing she learned, math <br/>
wise.  One day, she made a discovery all on her own that anytime you <br/>
double a number, whether that number is odd or even, the answer is <br/>
always even.  She decided one day to learn her doubles and she did.  <br/>
I noticed a few months back that she would stop in front of the <br/>
analog clock and stare at it for a long time, run off and play, then <br/>
return to stare some more.  By the end of the week, she had pretty <br/>
much figured out how to tell time.<br/>
<br/>
I think because I love to read, I want her to &quot;hurry up&quot; and read <br/>
because I just &quot;know&quot; that she will enjoy it as well.  I am having to <br/>
really step back and let her come to reading on her own terms.<br/>
<br/>
My son is 5.  You can bet that I have not made the same mistake.  He <br/>
is not interested in reading right now, not even really interested in <br/>
letters.  I am reading to both children lots and lots, we go to the <br/>
library several times a week, they dictate stories to me that I type, <br/>
and they &quot;write&quot; letters and cards (my 8 year old still just makes <br/>
scribbles and won&#39;t attempt to try to write words unless she <br/>
absolutely knows how) to relatives and friends that we actually send <br/>
(I remember as a teacher I&#39;d have the kids &quot;write&quot; letters or cards <br/>
to book characters that never got mailed - what an idiotic thing to <br/>
do!).<br/>
<br/>
I guess if I were to continue on the path of forcing my daughter to <br/>
read and using all sorts of programs to entice her and bribe her <br/>
(such as &quot;Book It&quot; etc.), she would end up being one of the illerate <br/>
people that we hear so much about.  I am hoping that it is not too <br/>
late and that some day, she will decide to read and will want to read <br/>
for the enjoyment of it.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for reading this long post!<br/>
<br/>
Melissa<br/>
