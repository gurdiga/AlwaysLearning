<div id="ygrps-yiv-21312808">Hubby and I decided when Zak was born not to determine the amount of his tv<br/>
watching and we believe that because of that he doesn&#39;t watch that much.<br/>
Especially lately with the Lego Racers taking over his life!!!  Hubby or I<br/>
will get a family movie and ask the kids if they want to watch it with us<br/>
and sometimes Zak will say &quot;no thanks I&#39;m doing something else&quot;...  Max will<br/>
watch about 5 mins of Cailou and then be off building a Thomas the Tank<br/>
track..  Max would much rather dance in the kitchen with me to loud soul<br/>
music than watch tv.<br/>
<br/>
Before I finished this e-mail Zak and I made chocolate covered strawberrries<br/>
while Max is napping... Now Zak is back at his computer and I&#39;m back at<br/>
mine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1261288374">I have never limited the TV and both children, 11 and 4, can take it or<br/>
leave the thing.  My daughter, in fact, asks if she can shut it off quite<br/>
often.  I am an addict, not to watching so much as just the sound of it,<br/>
so it&#39;s on more because of me than them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655002568">Lexie uses the closed captioning to learn the words to the songs, (right<br/>
now, Jesus Christ Superstar, next Cats).  She can sing them all word for<br/>
word.<br/>
<br/>
She also told my parents,when they complained about our use of closed<br/>
captioning, that she likes it because it helped her learn to read AND<br/>
that they would help janene learn to read, and also, that sheliked<br/>
seeing the differences between the closed captioning and the audio.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes.  And the actors tend to pantomime a little more<br/>
than  people with parcels and children in their arms. <br/>
And their speeches don&#39;t overlap or interrupt.<br/>
Advertisements were VERY helpful in learning to use<br/>
appliances and food packages.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Another way advertisements helped was in seeing the packaging.  I remember<br/>
spending a long, long time looking for mustard at the Swiss grocery store.<br/>
I finally looked up the word so I could ask the clerk &quot;Wo is der Senf?&quot;<br/>
Of course the clerk answered me in Swiss German but he also took me to the<br/>
aisle where it was located.  It was in a tube - heavier than our<br/>
toothpaste but otherwise the same.  I could have spent months looking for<br/>
yellow jars and never found it!  Tomato past was also sold in tubes then<br/>
and there.<br/>
