 </span></blockquote>Yes Sandra, you are so right about this. I didn&#39;t want them in Private school <br/>
because of what I had experienced and decided to let them do Public from the <br/>
beginning. I had never heard of unschooling at that time and the only <br/>
homeschooling I had ever heard of was completely religious based, so I really <br/>
had no idea that my way of learning was out there, just thought I was weird. <br/>
I was a super active room mom and sure enough, I saw not much was different <br/>
in the Public venue than in my school experience, they just didn&#39;t pray. Then <br/>
I found HSC and that led to an unschooling thread and then to <br/>
Unschooling.com. That was 3 years ago. We unschooled from the moment I <br/>
cleaned their desks out at school. It was such a relief and it fits our home <br/>
so well even though my kids do not learn the same way I do at all. But we are <br/>
learning from each other, that it is ok to learn our own way. Either way we <br/>
have all grown leaps and bounds and the only regret I have is that I didn&#39;t <br/>
know I was &quot;OK&quot; and could trust my kids would be too, from the beginning. I&#39;m <br/>
happy to have found all of you too!<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
