<div id="ygrps-yiv-389928505">Many years ago I made a resolution I have kept without fail and it has made <br/>
my whole life happier.<br/>
<br/>
I decided never, ever to make a New Year&#39;s Resolution.<br/>
<br/>
And every year I live a calm and happy life with the happy expectation of <br/>
good things to come.  It&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
The sad thing is that friends around me begin to whimper within days of <br/>
January 1 about how they have failed to keep their resolutions.<br/>
<br/>
Why wait until January 1 to break a bad habit or take up a new good habit?  <br/>
Do it when you think of it, but don&#39;t make yourself or the rest of the <br/>
universe any promises you might end up breaking.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my best advice for New Year&#39;s Eve.  Laugh or party or sleep, and wake <br/>
up without fear of failure!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515471623">Another option is a very loose intention list for the coming year. I&#39;ve done <br/>
this for the last few and I really like it. Not the &quot;I will do this as of Jan <br/>
1&quot; or &quot;I&#39;ll stop this as of Jan 1&quot;.  But rather have a list, sort of journal <br/>
style, of some things in life I&#39;d like to focus on more in the coming months.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s neat to write some goals on paper, and the change of year can be a good <br/>
time for it. It&#39;s also neat to pull it out again a few months later and see <br/>
what I&#39;ve done and see what I know longer want to do. And if there&#39;s <br/>
something I&#39;ve wanted for a few years  and haven&#39;t done it, then I get to <br/>
figure out if it&#39;s something I really wanted in the first place or what&#39;s <br/>
behind me not doing it.<br/>
<br/>
This type of list doesn&#39;t make me feel obligated or burdened in the least. <br/>
More of a self awareness thing. I journal a lot and I think of the New Year <br/>
list as sort of a broader perspective of where I&#39;m at and where I want to go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2144284829"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;I decided never, ever to make a New Year&#39;s Resolution.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I wholeheartedly agree! Last night dh asked what my resolutions were. I told<br/>
him:<br/>
&quot;To be perfect.&quot;<br/>
Then I went on to explain that very few people keep their resolutions and if<br/>
I am going to pick some arbitrary flaw to change, I may as well just try to<br/>
be perfect. This is something I KNOW I will fail at, because no one is<br/>
perfect, it is an unattainable goal and therefore all the pressure is taken<br/>
off me to do something &quot;real&quot;.<br/>
I do have one resolution but not for new years - it is to be much more<br/>
active on this list and my homesteading list (by the grace of Dodd). But as<br/>
you can see, i am starting today rather than some pseudo-start date.<br/>
