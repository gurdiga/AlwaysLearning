<div id="ygrps-yiv-592487950">This was posted on another list.  Sorry for those of you who might get it <br/>
twice.  I looked for the original, but I&#39;m guessing it was on a news service <br/>

other research they&#39;ve done.<br/>

where they&#39;ll feel safe, according to Michael L. Commons and Patrice M.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;       The pair examined childrearing practices here and in other<br/>

<br/>
may<br/>
lead to incidents of post-traumatic stress and panic disorders when<br/>

children reach adulthood.<br/>

they&#39;re overly sensitive to future trauma.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&quot;It<br/>
accounts for cross-cultural differences in children&#39;s emotional response<br/>
<br/>
and<br/>
their ability to cope with stress, including traumatic stress.&quot;<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

are<br/>
on<br/>
the wrong track: physical contact and reassurance will make children<br/>

head<br/>
out on their own.<br/>

sleep<br/>
with their babies and respond rapidly when the baby cries.<br/>

Miller<br/>
said in their paper on the subject.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

themselves on independence to the point of isolation, even when<br/>
undergoing a<br/>
difficult or stressful time.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

on<br/>
their own.<br/>

sleep with their infant children, to keep their toddlers nearby, perhaps<br/>
<br/>
on<br/>
a mattress in the same room, and to comfort a baby when it cries.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

concerns<br/>
that a baby would be injured by a parent rolling on it if the parent and<br/>
<br/>
baby shared the bed. Additionally, the nation&#39;s growing wealth has<br/>
helped<br/>
the trend toward separation by giving families the means to buy larger<br/>
homes<br/>
with separate rooms for children.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

Nope. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

There was a list of published articles under the Miller-professor&#39;s site, and <br/>
she&#39;s done lots of research in this parental contact/cross-cultural stuff.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1424823678">My first child was kept in bed with us for many months and then(foolishly listening to others)we kicked him out.  This was very difficult for me, but I was young and thought everyone else knew what they were talking about. My son is now 6 and back in bed with us at his request. I am sure he feels safe again because he goes to sleep with the sweetest grin on his face every night as I sing to him.  My deepest desire is that this will magically erase what I feel was a major trauma of his infancy.  I wish I would have known.  No, I wish I would have trusted myself, I did know.  <br/>
