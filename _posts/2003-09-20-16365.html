<div id="ygrps-yiv-910878394">&lt;&lt;I believe I&#39;m finally knowing myself and liking who I am&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hear you Ren.  I was raised where pretty much everyone was just like us.<br/>
Everyone was white, Christian, school attending, small town morals, etc..  I<br/>
grew up planning to go to college, work as a professional, have 2 kids who<br/>
attended schools and daycares.<br/>
<br/>
What a shock to learn that I am meant to be a holistically oriented, organic<br/>
goat farmer with strong Pagan leanings?  Poor dh, the last few years have<br/>
taken their toll.  He always knew I was different.  Its just that neither<br/>
one of us had any idea HOW different.  Its difficult at times because, even<br/>
though I love him dearly, he IS Corporate America with a capital &quot;c&quot; and<br/>
that is his chosen path that he loves.<br/>
<br/>
I find that I tend to kind of drag out telling him of all my personal<br/>
changes to give him time to adjust.  Once I realized that I didn&#39;t HAVE to<br/>
be a certain way, it was like flood gates opened and I have been &quot;morphing&quot;<br/>
every since.  But I am so happy, truly contented and the kids sense it as<br/>
well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1228874453">Julie, That is so funny. My DH is a company man too.  He is a good <br/>
hubby thought, lets me do my thing and shakes his head and tries to <br/>
keep up.. <br/>
