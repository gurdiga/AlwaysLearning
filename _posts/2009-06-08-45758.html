<div id="ygrps-yiv-1677559872">Hello!<br/>
<br/>
My son is 2.5 yo and we have decided to unschool. I feel so strongly about<br/>
it, and feel in so many ways it has changed my life. I&#39;m currently getting<br/>
ideas from some Montessori books about how to get started with reading and<br/>
writing (we made and decorated our movable alphabet today!) I know I am just<br/>
having to learn to relax and not have every moment filled up every day with<br/>
activities, and I have found this message board so helpful in finding my<br/>
way, but I was wondering if you all could give me some ideas about the kinds<br/>
of things you did/do with your toddlers. Games, etc. We do so much already,<br/>
but I&#39;m most interested in breaking out of our cycle and trying something<br/>
new.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance!<br/>
<br/>
M. Cossey<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-608305846">M. Cossey, you didn&#39;t name your post, so I&#39;ve named my response.<br/>
<br/>
There was a chat a while back specifically about things to do with  <br/>
toddlers, and there are many links that came out of the discussion!<br/>
