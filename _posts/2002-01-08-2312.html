<div id="ygrps-yiv-718470189">I read this last night and thought it was cool and wanted to share.  From<br/>
&quot;Zen Mind, Beginner&#39;s Mind&quot; by Shunryu Suzuki.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Ancient painters used to practice putting dots on paper in artistic<br/>
disorder.  This is rather difficult.  Even though you try to do it, usually<br/>
what you do is arranged in some order.  You think you can control it, but<br/>
you cannot; it is almost impossible to arrange your dots out of order.  It<br/>
is the same with taking care of your everyday life.  Even though you try to<br/>
put people under some control, it is impossible.  You cannot do it.  The<br/>
best way to control people is to encourage them to be mischievous.  Then<br/>
they will be in control in its wider sense.  To give your sheep or cow a<br/>
large, spacious meadow is the way to control them.  So it is with people:<br/>
first let them do what they want and watch them.  This the best policy.  To<br/>
ignore them is not good; that is the worst policy.  The second worst is<br/>
trying to control them.  The best one is to watch them, just to watch them,<br/>
without trying to control them....The true purpose is to see things as they<br/>
are, to observe things as they are, and to let everything go as it goes.&quot;<br/>

The essence of unschooling, for me.<br/>
Thanks Julie :-)<br/>
