<div id="ygrps-yiv-165473937">I want to thank everyone for the input on the<br/>
different scouting organizations.  It has been really<br/>
helpful to me to hear what the personal experiences of<br/>
others has been. <br/>
<br/>
I especially want to thank whoever it was that posted<br/>
about Roots & Shoots.  Sorry, I am fighting off the<br/>
flu and feeling fuzzy headed.  I am ordering their<br/>
leader&#39;s handbook, and unless there is something there<br/>
to dissuade me, I anticipate getting involved with<br/>
their programs.   I have located another local family,<br/>
possibly two, with kids my kid&#39;s ages, who are<br/>
interested in Roots & Shoots as well.  So that speaks<br/>
to me serendipitously.  I located them through our<br/>
local homeschooling exchange as well, so they are<br/>
homeschoolers as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to a great list.  I knew I could count on<br/>
you for no nonsense practical wisdom and no flaming. <br/>
By the way, I think it&#39;s funny that this &quot;quiet back<br/>
room&quot; of a list has almost 300 members!  Perhaps it&#39;s<br/>
not that it is small, perhaps reason and intelligence<br/>
level of the members has more to do with it&#39;s<br/>
outstanding atmosphere, and the brilliance of a<br/>
certain big-hearted list momma who happens to be<br/>
crippled right now.  Get well soon!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
REALLY?<br/>
<br/>
Last time I looked it was 150.  Good for me, for not looking more. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I decided I was going to feel happy if it hit 100, and that would make it <br/>
worth maintaining.  150 seemed so past my &quot;goal&quot; that I quit looking.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the kind words.<br/>
