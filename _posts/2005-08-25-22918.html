And it&#39;s not even about unschooling!   That&#39;s the shocking part. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He found something in the SCA section of my website about it being rude to <br/>
come up with an unpronounceable SCA name and then to expect people to know how <br/>
to pronounce it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was interviewed yesterday morning (Tuesday).   Wednesday mid-afternoon I <br/>
get a call from my friend Cathyn asking if I had been interviewed by the BBC <br/>
recently.    Yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
Well his wife got e-mail from her friend in Minnesota...<br/>
<br/>
Last week I was interviewed two other times, one by someone writing a <br/>
technology and business article on TVs in kids&#39; rooms, and then later in the week by <br/>
someone from Salon.com.   THAT one was about unschooling, and when that <br/>
article is available I&#39;ll let you know.<br/>
<br/>
Busy strangers-on-the-phone week.   Fun. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-744743608">How cool!  And a good article -- what fun to be in it.  I constantly deal with people mispronouncing our last name:  Valenzuela   -- and our daughter, Noelle, is constantly called Nicole by people.  I can understand the hard time with Valenzuela, but calling Noelle by the name Nicole?  I don&#39;t get that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-474153575">That was an interesting article.  And the comments from  some people were <br/>
funny. <br/>
 <br/>
My dad told me that &quot;life is hard enough, without saddling  your kid with a <br/>
hard name.&quot;  His kids are named John, Steve and  Karen.  Believe it or not, <br/>
lots of people think Karen is spelled with a C,  and it&#39;s mostly men who make <br/>
that error.  I guess it reminds them  of Carol.  My kids are Jake, Jon and Will.  <br/>
Jake was pretty exotic for  rural Arkansas in 1982, but turned out to be <br/>
pretty popular!  3 Jakes one  baseball team when he was 8!<br/>
 <br/>
I suppose it&#39;s because it&#39;s in Britian, but I thought it odd  that it said <br/>
&#39;people from New York call her &quot;Sarndra&quot;,&#39; and they  spelled with that extra R <br/>
in the middle.  I would have spelled it  Sahndra.  Later or in the comments <br/>
they use an AR in another word where I  would have put an AH to denote that <br/>
sound.  R is more of a hard consonant  to me, than H.<br/>
 <br/>
I grew up in Chicago, with a lot of Irish around  me.  I&#39;ve been interested <br/>
in dialect and pronunciation ever since I moved  from there to Arkansas when I <br/>
was 11.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote> Me too. <br/>
And I&#39;d&#39;ve spelled the southern way &quot;Say-en dra&quot; but I guess   he was writing <br/>
what Brits would pronounce.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about some of the kids in England not hearing the different between <br/>
the way they pronounced &quot;Holly&quot; and the way she did.     He couldn&#39;t hear it <br/>
either at first, but we talked about it and he pronounced the two different <br/>
ways.<br/>
<br/>
What he said was clear and true, but over-simplified (but it was a REALLY <br/>
short article so that&#39;s understandable).   I said older relatives from Texas <br/>
pronounced it all stretched out, and older people from the NE U.S. tended toward <br/>
the &quot;Sahndra&quot; version.     He left out it being older people.   I had said <br/>
people younger go with the way I say it maybe because of Sandra Bullock or other <br/>
Sandras being out there and having their names pronounced.<br/>
<br/>
The way he found me was googling &quot;unpronounceable names&quot; and he got an <br/>
article I wrote years ago about SCA naming practices, mostly of local groups, but <br/>
the last paragraph was:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Personal names are absolutely more personal. If an individual wants to have <br/>
an unpronounceable name, it&#39;s his or her own business. If an individual wants <br/>
to have an unpronounceable name and then expect every herald to magically <br/>
deduce it and every chronicler to unfailingly spell it, this is about like putting <br/>
a chip on your shoulder and then knocking it off yourself. If your name is odd <br/>
or foreign, you must graciously live with the inconvenience and you should be <br/>
the one to apologize if a herald mispronounces it.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Oh. And I had said &quot;Anyone who can read Middle English,&quot; and he said &quot;fluent&quot; <br/>
because I guess it&#39;s funnier. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

I don&#39;t know that Brits hear that difference. Bugged the hell out of me <br/>
to hear &quot;Princess Dianer&quot;<br/>
