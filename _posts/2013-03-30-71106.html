<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536317946">I know this isn&#39;t an unschooling question, but I&#39;m not sure where to ask a question like this.<br/>
<br/>
My children all have ipods now, and we are wanting to set them up with an email account.  It gives us options on the ipod - yahoo, aol, google, etc.  We&#39;re not sure which one will serve them better.  We don&#39;t know a lot about the email servers, so I was wondering if any one here could offer suggestions, so that we can get them set up.  I was going to go with google (not really sure why), but then I thought, &quot;what if they want to get on a yahoo group later on??&quot;  Is google (or others for that matter) the same way (as far as having &quot;yahoo&quot; type groups - like this one)?<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions?<br/>
<br/>
thanks in advance,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>An email address is like a phone number. It doesn&#39;t matter who you get the address (or number) from. They work the same. A Yahoo address will work on Google groups and a Google address will work on a Yahoo group.<br/>
<br/>
The big differences are in how good the spam filters are and how easy it is to read. (Though there are programs like Microsoft Outlook and Apple&#39;s Mail that download mail onto your computer.)<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re using AT&T which should allow you to add more email accounts. The downside of using an email from a provider is if you change providers, you need new email addresses.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything special out there for kids but I let it through just in case someone knows.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-852112619">You can connect to Yahoo and many other sites using a Google account.<br/>
That&#39;s how I joined this group. Having a Google account brings access to<br/>
many useful applications; in addition to Gmail, there is Google Drive (free<br/>
cloud storage), Google + (lightweight social networking), Google Music<br/>
(free music streaming service), Google Voice (a free phone number and<br/>
texting application), and many others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627966070">I agree with the google sentiment. All my kids have gmail accounts and <br/>
it allows their relative to email them notes etc and I am fairly <br/>
confident they will be able to keep it as they grow up. The <br/>
features/spam filtering/etc are all the best with google&#39;s service.<br/>
<br/>
And yes I know this isn&#39;t a gmail account that I am using but I have had <br/>
this from before gmail existed, I have a gmail account I use for all my <br/>
family/friend correspondance.<br/>
