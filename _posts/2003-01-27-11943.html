Class based on &#39;Lord of the Rings&#39; languages helps give a weighty college<br/>
subject more pop<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
By LINDA K. WERTHEIMER / The Dallas Morning News<br/>
<br/>
AUSTIN – The University of Texas students scribbled their names in a strange<br/>
language. The A&#39;s looked like F&#39;s, the P&#39;s resembled gibberish.<br/>
<br/>
They were in their second day of learning Old English runes, the writing<br/>
system used by author J.R.R. Tolkien to invent the languages Elvish, Orcish<br/>
and Dwarvish for The Lord of the Rings.<br/>
<br/>
At UT, the tongues revived by the hit film trilogy are being used to teach<br/>
the millennial generation this semester. Already, students are raving about<br/>
the new course, titled &quot;The Linguistics of Tolkien&#39;s Middle Earth.&quot; Both<br/>
sections of the class are full, and hundreds of students are on waiting<br/>
lists to get in.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So far, I love it. I like the visual, seeing the runes on the board,&quot; said<br/>
Elizabeth Nelson, a 19-year-old UT senior who has three fairy tattoos. A<br/>
tattoo of the Lady Galadriel is on her midriff. &quot;I like being able to say<br/>
that I know how to write my name in runes. Lots of my friends are jealous.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
UT isn&#39;t alone in jumping on the Tolkien bandwagon. This fall, three<br/>
Dallas-area universities will team up to teach a literature class about the<br/>
trilogy for students from the University of Dallas in Irving, Southern<br/>
Methodist University and the University of Texas at Dallas.<br/>
<br/>
The trend isn&#39;t new. For at least two decades, some professors have taught<br/>
popular culture classes about film and TV shows and at times faced ridicule<br/>
from colleagues. The difference now is that more professors are unabashedly<br/>
linking movies and books their students adore with traditional, often<br/>
weighty subjects, from physics to philosophy. Pop culture is no longer<br/>
viewed as a nonsensical subject.<br/>
<br/>
The idea of connecting traditional classes and popular culture grew rapidly<br/>
the last five years, said Robert Thompson, a Syracuse University professor<br/>
of media and popular culture. Textbooks such as The Simpsons and Philosophy:<br/>
The D&#39;oh! of Homer and Seinfeld and Philosophy: A Book about Everything and<br/>
Nothing helped move the trend along, he said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;College students know an enormous amount about television, about popular<br/>
music,&quot; Dr. Thompson said. &quot;If we can use that knowledge to invite them into<br/>
other kinds of work, it&#39;d be silly not to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But professors can&#39;t simply show film clips and play sound bites of popular<br/>
music.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you&#39;re trying to teach Plato using Seinfeld and Simpson, that&#39;s a fine<br/>
thing to do,&quot; he said. &quot;But if you never get around to reading Plato, you&#39;ve<br/>
failed.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At Hobart and William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y., students have been<br/>
able to sign up for &quot;Beam me up, Einstein: Physics through Star Trek&quot; since<br/>
1997. Don Spector teaches the course every other year for nonscience majors.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Spector shows bits of Star Trek episodes based on whether there&#39;s a<br/>
physics principle he can teach. Students, for example, watch a clip about a<br/>
cloaking device. (Translation for nongeeks: a gadget that renders objects,<br/>
typically spaceships, invisible and undetectable.) Then the class talks<br/>
about what principles could be used to create the device.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have fun with it. I like teaching in this way better probably because<br/>
they are more engaged with it,&quot; Dr. Spector said. &quot;Physics always has this<br/>
reputation of being so hard and so out there. It helps the physics to bring<br/>
something that&#39;s so accessible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Lyrical literature<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
David Gaines, chairman of the English department at Southwestern University<br/>
in Georgetown, Texas, teaches a literature class based on Bob Dylan.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not, &#39;Let&#39;s just listen to &quot;Tangled Up in Blue&quot; 70 times and go home<br/>
and listen to it more,&#39; &quot; Dr. Gaines said. &quot;It&#39;s a way to engage students<br/>
with materials they&#39;re interested in and urge them to take that a little<br/>
further.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Using the work of Tolkien as the focus for linguistics makes perfect sense,<br/>
he said. The students think critically about a book they have read for<br/>
pleasure in the past.<br/>
<br/>
The three Dallas-area schools teaming up for the class this fall will link<br/>
the Tolkien trilogy to religion, medieval philosophy and other areas, said<br/>
Dennis Kratz, a UTD professor and dean who will help teach the course.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What&#39;s really happening today is the old notions of pop culture and high<br/>
culture, except for the extremes, have blurred,&quot; Dr. Kratz said. &quot;When you<br/>
redo La Bohéme as Rent, is that high culture or middle-brow culture?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The Lord of the Rings is a bit of both, he said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I just think it&#39;s such a very deep, satisfying, intellectually pleasing<br/>
work of literature, and yet it&#39;s fun,&quot; Dr. Kratz said.<br/>
<br/>
UT instructor Fred Hoyt, a graduate student, created the Tolkien course to<br/>
meet a requirement that he create an introductory linguistics class. Both<br/>
sections of his classes, one with 30 students, one with 70, filled<br/>
immediately; he would have been able to fill each class 10 times over, based<br/>
on waiting lists.<br/>
<br/>
Linguistics link<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Hoyt said there&#39;s a logical connection between the famous author and<br/>
linguistics. Mr. Tolkien was a linguist before he was a novelist. One of the<br/>
required texts in the new UT class is The Languages of Tolkien&#39;s Middle<br/>
Earth, another author&#39;s interpretation of the invented tongues. Mr. Tolkien<br/>
based the languages on Old Norse, Old English, Gothic, Welsh and Finnish.<br/>
Mr. Hoyt, like many of his students, began reading the author&#39;s books as a<br/>
child. He said the work gave him a love for new languages, though he didn&#39;t<br/>
know about linguistics at the time.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Part of the reason I wanted to offer this course was when I was an<br/>
undergraduate, I wish I had known about linguistics,&quot; he said. &quot;In my<br/>
department, there&#39;s more focus on teaching. Linguistics is hard. It&#39;s more<br/>
like we&#39;re realizing we always could&#39;ve gotten to more people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
His hope is that some students will want to study the discipline after<br/>
taking his class.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not about the movies. The stuff we&#39;re interested in is the stuff left<br/>
out in the movies,&quot; he said.<br/>
<br/>
Students must read The Lord of the Rings and familiarize themselves with the<br/>
appendix that explains the development of the languages. They&#39;ll study Old<br/>
English runes, but they&#39;ll also learn Angerthas Daeron, the Elvish runes<br/>
that Mr. Tolkien created, and Angerthas Moria, the Dwarvish runes.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ll talk about how Elvish sounds melodic and the Black Speech in the<br/>
trilogy sounds harsh.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The good guys in his book speak beautiful languages, and the bad guys speak<br/>
ugly languages,&quot; Mr. Hoyt said.<br/>
<br/>
Students said professors are right to find ways to connect teaching to<br/>
students&#39; lives.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If it&#39;s interesting and relevant, you&#39;ll learn it better,&quot; said Alex<br/>
Hancock, a junior.<br/>
<br/>
Professors, even when they include popular film or books, are careful to<br/>
teach in depth, said UT senior Travis Lara.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s not more bells and whistles,&quot; he said. &quot;It&#39;s more involvement with<br/>
students.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Eric Lee, an engineering major, never intended to study linguistics until he<br/>
saw &quot;Middle Earth&quot; in the course title.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I saw it advertised on the front page of the UT Web site,&quot; Mr. Lee said. &quot;I<br/>
was like, &#39;Cool. I have to take this class.&#39; &quot;<br/>

&quot;Gibberish&quot; has to do with unintelligible sounds.  Not what things look like.<br/>

So I was prepared for that particular writer to be confused about other <br/>

<br/>
Anglo Saxon &quot;runes&quot; isn&#39;t right, but it&#39;s close enough for someone who <br/>
doesn&#39;t know what gibberish means.<br/>
<br/>
Teaching those languages as languages is pretty useless, but if the professor <br/>
is using it as a way to discuss the history of Germanic languages and how <br/>
they became the Scandinavian languages, and English and Flemish, that could <br/>
be cool.<br/>

AHA!!!!  The author trips on his unintelligible tongue again, and forgets <br/>
that studtying Tolkien&#39;s BOOKS as literature has zip to do with film or TV <br/>
shows.<br/>
