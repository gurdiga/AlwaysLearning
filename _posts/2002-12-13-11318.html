<div id="ygrps-yiv-2088312333">Hey Everyone!  <br/>
  <br/>
I&#39;m wondering if anyone minds if I quote and forward some things from this list to my homeschool group&#39;s info list?  I&#39;m particularly thinking of  Robin&#39;s rant about homemaking etc., and all the great responses esp. in digest # 653.  It&#39;s a huge issue for many of us in the group right now and I know people would be thrilled to know they&#39;re sure not alone!<br/>
<br/>
Also I&#39;m in the process of putting together my personal/business web page and would like to post some quotes from some of you on my unschooling page, mostly philosophical type stuff, nothing personal.  I could/would give credit or use things anonymously.   Would that be okay?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much for putting yourselves &quot;out there&quot; where we all can find you.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-99909498">You can quote anything of mine, anytime. <br/>
<br/>
Probably you should ask individuals.  Some people might want to polish or <br/>
revise before making something more permanent.  Or they might not want their <br/>
kids names out there that way.  (I know this list is &quot;out there,&quot; but it&#39;s <br/>
harder to find than a webpage, in some ways.  The archives are anyway.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285545783">I don&#39;t mind being quoted, but hope that if you see a punctuation or spelling error, you fix it. Sometimes when I&#39;m posting, I don&#39;t proof read very well! Also, if this is going on a website, I&#39;d love the url! <br/>
Thanks! <br/>
Warmly,<br/>

  Hey Everyone!  <br/>

I don&#39;t know if you would ever need any of mine, but it&#39;s always ok with me.<br/>
Anything I put online is ok to use. If I don&#39;t want it used, I wouldn&#39;t post <br/>
it here!<br/>

But Ren, you&#39;re smarter than some people who seem not even to want their <br/>
public posts quoted back to them later the same day!!! <br/>
