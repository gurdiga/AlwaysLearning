<div id="ygrps-yiv-1933899274">Although it wasn&#39;t let through to the list, some of you might have received an e-mail about someone going to London and being mugged and needing money.  It&#39;s a scam (and maybe an automatically generated one), and it&#39;s popped up on and off for years.  <br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t respond to it.   <br/>
<br/>
Sorry to put this on Always Learning, but I would hate for anyone to lose any money (or computer security) over it.<br/>
