<div id="ygrps-yiv-1324373727">Here is a blurb from a cool website about Capsicin.....it has tons of info. <br/>
about the healing properites, history and more.  It even has the chemical <br/>
breakdown I posted.<br/>
And here is the link:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lifebalm.com/cayenne_herb.html">http://www.lifebalm.com/cayenne_herb.html</a><br/>
and a tidbit of info:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Cayenne pepper is the name for the hottest form of Capsicum, which can take <br/>
other forms. If its heat is 1 BTU, this mild Capsicum is called paprika; if <br/>
it is from one to twenty-five BTU, it is called simply red pepper; but over <br/>
twenty-five BTU rating is termed Cayenne. Therefore Cayenne is the strongest <br/>
of the Capsicum family. In Mexico alone, many varieties (some claim fifteen <br/>
or more) of peppers are grown, each with a distinctive flavor, and often very <br/>
hot indeed. Other important varieties are grown in Japan (predominantly used, <br/>
dried, in cooking), the United States, and Africa, the latter being valued as <br/>
a high-quality medicinal Cayenne. <br/>
<br/>
One of the United States varieties, imported from the Mexican state of <br/>
Tabasco, has attained great renown. An American soldier, returning from the <br/>
Mexican War of 1846-48, brought some pepper seeds to Edward Mcllhenny, a <br/>
banker, who grew plants from them in Louisiana. McIlhenny found that the <br/>
peppers made a delightfully piquant sauce. During the Civil War, he left <br/>
Louisiana, but when he returned, finding his plants still flourishing, was <br/>
persuaded to market his sauce. Since the war had left him without an income, <br/>
he thought this was worth a try, and the venture proved successful; Tabasco <br/>
Sauce is a gourmet treat throughout the world (Heiser: 12).</div>
