You have to trust that the child will learn&#39;<br/>
&#39;Unschooling&#39; movement leaves education choices up to kids<br/>
<br/>
December 24, 2006<br/>
BY ROSALIND ROSSI Education Reporter<br/>
Eighteen-year-old Abby Stewart got word this month that she won early <br/>
admission to elite Princeton University, even though she has never set <br/>
foot in a high school classroom.<br/>
She also wrapped up a huge challenge -- dancing the Snow Queen role in <br/>
&quot;The Nutcracker Suite&quot; at the Athenaeum Theatre -- largely because she <br/>
has never set foot in a high school classroom.<br/>
<br/>
Five years ago, frustrated with the pace and depth of a Chicago Public <br/>
School gifted program, Abby withdrew from eighth grade and entered <br/>
uncharted territory -- a branch of home schooling often called <br/>
&quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Under this ultimate form of &quot;child-directed&quot; learning, Abby used no set <br/>
curriculum. She called her own hours, worked at her own pace and, most <br/>
important, followed her own interests -- without taking tests or <br/>
receiving grades. Some days, she&#39;d wake up, grab a bowl of cereal and <br/>
go back to bed with a book.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, she has amassed a six-page reading list ranging from <br/>
Charles Darwin&#39;s The Origin of Species to Holt, Rinehart and Winston&#39;s <br/>
Calculus to 16 Shakespearean plays.<br/>
&quot;I do exactly what feels right to me,&quot; says Abby. &quot;If I want to just <br/>
read literature for three weeks or three months, that&#39;s perfectly fine <br/>
with my family.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The flexibility of unschooling made it easier for Abby to take ballet <br/>
classes six days a week, resulting in the shopping bag full of pointe <br/>
shoes in the corner of her Hyde Park bedroom and her recent role in <br/>
Ballet Chicago&#39;s Studio Company production of &quot;The Nutcracker Suite.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abby also volunteers three days a week at the Field Museum, where she <br/>
reduces animal carcasses to bones. Her first day at work, she was given <br/>
a pair of gloves and a scalpel and directed to the remains of a <br/>
Siberian tiger.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Compared to a kid in high school with worms and frogs, it&#39;s pretty <br/>
heady stuff,&quot; said her dad, Dana Stewart, a sleep researcher at the <br/>
University of Chicago Hospitals.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Delight-driven learning&#39;<br/>
By some counts, Abby is part of a growing movement, at least in the <br/>
Chicago area.<br/>
Federal officials estimate that about 1.1 million students nationwide <br/>
were home-schooled in 2003, up a hefty 30 percent from four years <br/>
earlier.<br/>
<br/>
Although numbers on unschooling are more difficult to come by, since <br/>
1999, at least five unschooling online support groups have sprung up in <br/>
Illinois, four of them concentrated in the six-county Chicago area, <br/>
said Melissa Bradford, founder of Many Rivers Unschooling, serving <br/>
mostly DuPage and Will counties.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s definitely growing. Look at our group,&quot; said Winifred Haun, a <br/>
choreographer and dancer who co-founded Northside Unschoolers of <br/>
Chicago in 2001 with some half-dozen families. Last year, membership <br/>
hit 100.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is rooted in the ideas of education reformer John Holt, who <br/>
said children are innately curious and will learn what they need to <br/>
know when they need to know it.<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t mean unschoolers won&#39;t ever take conventional classes.<br/>
<br/>
Art enthusiasts may take art classes. Teens who want to go to college <br/>
may take community college classes first.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers figure out what they want to do in life and then learn what <br/>
they need to get there. Advocates say they absorb material better by <br/>
learning it when they need it.<br/>
<br/>
One unschooling Web site calls the approach &quot;delight-driven learning.&quot; <br/>
Author Pat Farenga, a student of Holt&#39;s, calls it &quot;the natural way to <br/>
learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is the way we learn before going to school and the way we learn <br/>
when we leave school and enter the world of work,&quot; Farenga writes in <br/>
Teach Your Own: The John Holt Book of Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
One Northside Unschoolers mom was seeking an alternative to the test <br/>
emphasis and heavy homework in her public school. Other unschooling <br/>
parents may want to avoid labels schools put on especially active kids <br/>
or late readers.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The hardest thing for most people ... is that you have to trust that <br/>
the child will learn,&quot; said Mary Griffith, author of The Unschooling <br/>
Handbook: How to Use the Whole World As Your Child&#39;s Classroom.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For those of us who had late readers, it was really hard. A lot of <br/>
unschooled kids don&#39;t learn to read when they are 6. Sometimes waiting <br/>
until they are 7, 8 or 9 is quite common,&quot; said Griffith.<br/>
&quot;But once they learn to read, they read anything and everything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&#39;Noodling around&#39;<br/>
The tools of unschooling in the early years are scattered across a <br/>
third-floor playroom of Winifred Haun&#39;s turn-of-the-century Oak Park <br/>
home.<br/>
Dice and board games help daughters Athena, 10; Iris, 5, and Selene, 2, <br/>
learn math -- and social skills. Pads of paper, pencils and markers are <br/>
there for writing and drawing. Books are omnipresent.<br/>
<br/>
This &quot;unschooling&quot; morning, Iris and Athena have completed math <br/>
problems they asked their dad, Stephen Parke, a Harvard grad and <br/>
physicist at Argonne National Laboratory, to create.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Iris was interested in 1 plus 1 is 2,&quot; Haun says, so Parke&#39;s worksheet <br/>
expands the idea all the way up to 50 plus 50. Athena&#39;s problems amount <br/>
to early algebra.<br/>
<br/>
Selene plays on a futon as Iris works with her mom on sewing and Athena <br/>
announces &quot;I need to practice my writing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Athena has seen what she&#39;s missing -- and doesn&#39;t miss it.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;ve been to school for a day. It was fun, but I like it here better. <br/>
In school, they just sat there while the teacher talked,&quot; Athena says.<br/>
<br/>
Athena knows some question whether home-schoolers will develop the <br/>
proper social skills away from a classroom full of kids their age.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I say home-schoolers do get social skills,&quot; Athena says. &quot;I go to <br/>
choir where there&#39;s one other kid who&#39;s home schooled. And I go to a <br/>
home-schooling group where there are kids of all ages. And I have Girl <br/>
Scouts and ballet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Haun said some days her kids &quot;just noodle around, but they are <br/>
investing in days when they produce more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Besides, she said, &quot;You can teach your kid in 90 minutes a day what it <br/>
takes the school six hours. ... The other 4Â½ hours are, &#39;Stand up. Sit <br/>
up. Let&#39;s go to the bathroom. Let&#39;s take attendance. ...&#39;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If my daughter needs to know ... how to find her friend&#39;s name in the <br/>
phone book, I can take five minutes and explain to her about <br/>
alphabetizing,&quot; Haun said. &quot;I don&#39;t have to test her. I know when she <br/>
can look up the name on her own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In their teenage years, said Grace Llewellyn, author of The Teenage <br/>
Liberation Handbook, unschooling kids can study biology with a <br/>
textbook, in a community college or with software. Or they can befriend <br/>
a doctor and brainstorm on books to read or projects to do. Or they can <br/>
volunteer to work in a veterinarian&#39;s office.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;The sky is the limit,&quot; Llewellyn said.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The college question<br/>
Abby&#39;s dad and mom, a hospice social worker, gave their three children <br/>
a taste of school (all won admission to gifted programs), and <br/>
eventually let them decide if they wanted to stay there. All three <br/>
wound up pretty much unschoolers, with the oldest graduating from <br/>
Dartmouth in June.<br/>
Abby wanted to go to college, too, and plunged into subjects she&#39;d need <br/>
to get there.<br/>
<br/>
To prepare for the SAT college admission tests, she bought some test <br/>
prep books and took some old subject matter tests. She posted knockout <br/>
scores: an overall SAT of 2,350 out of 2,400.<br/>
<br/>
To pad out her track record, she also took the SAT world history, <br/>
literature and U.S. history tests, scoring 800, 790 and 780, <br/>
respectively, on an 800-point scale.<br/>
<br/>
Not all unschoolers or home-schoolers have Abby&#39;s scores, but on <br/>
another popular college admission test, the ACT, test-takers who <br/>
identified themselves as home-schoolers have scored a notch above the <br/>
national average for the last decade. This year, they averaged 22.4 on <br/>
a 36-point scale compared with a national average of 21.2.<br/>
<br/>
Before Abby got the news last week that she had won early admission to <br/>
Princeton, she had researched applying to seven other colleges and <br/>
found them &quot;pretty forgiving&quot; about her lack of a traditional <br/>
grade-point average.<br/>
<br/>
At Harvard University, admissions director Marlyn McGrath Lewis said, <br/>
unschoolers without transcripts can submit college admission scores, <br/>
and then &quot;tell us what they have done in the way of academic <br/>
preparation for college, and we&#39;ll take it from there.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some may wonder if unschoolers can adjust to the structure of college <br/>
life. After the regimen of ballet classes, Abby doesn&#39;t expect problems.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooler Sam Dickey, 23, an Oak Park native now attending Beloit <br/>
College after four years at a community college, said he has no <br/>
difficulty making it to classes. He found he performs well on deadline <br/>
and is a &quot;very good writer&quot; despite never having written a research <br/>
paper before college.<br/>
<br/>
But just like traditional schoolers, not all unschoolers want college.<br/>
<br/>
Jan Hunt, an unschooling counselor who operates the Natural Child <br/>
Project Web site, said her unschooled son didn&#39;t go to college. He <br/>
started a computer consulting company instead.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;He continually beats us at Trivial Pursuit. He&#39;s an incredible <br/>
editor,&quot; said Hunt. &quot;He can do any math problem in his head. I have the <br/>
proof in the pudding right here.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Not for everyone<br/>
Yet even advocates caution that unschooling is not for everyone.<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s just kind of a scary way of doing things. Not many people are <br/>
willing to go out on that limb,&quot; said Dorothy Werner, founder of Home <br/>
Oriented Unique Schooling Experience, an Illinois home-schooling <br/>
support group.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You have to trust that children want to learn. You can&#39;t believe that <br/>
children must be forced to learn,&quot; Werner said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parents who need to be in control ... would have a hard time. If you <br/>
want your child to be learning the same factoids as the child next <br/>
door, unschooling is not for you.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Home-schooling researcher Michael Apple, an education professor at the <br/>
University of Wisconsin-Madison, is &quot;wary of the hype.&quot; He wonders what <br/>
unschoolers are really learning about people of other races, religions <br/>
and cultures.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is no public accountability,&quot; Apple said.<br/>
<br/>
Counters unschooling author Farenga: &quot;Who is going to be the commissar <br/>
of correct thought?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
William Schubert, professor of curriculum studies at the University of <br/>
Illinois at Chicago, home-schooled his daughter using a few unschooling <br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
He says unschooling can be positive, but requires time, resources and <br/>
&quot;dialogue with ... well-educated people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We don&#39;t know that children are innately curious. The question is <br/>
open,&quot; Schubert said. Some unschoolers &quot;may not get any further than <br/>
eating candy bars.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling may be easier for parents with the time and resources, <br/>
Farenga agrees, but &quot;everyone can find that within their own little <br/>
sphere.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not trying to make this sound like it&#39;s easy,&quot; Farenga said, &quot;but <br/>
it&#39;s not easy if your child is failing or hurting in school, either.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Abby and others insist every child has a passion waiting to be ignited.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Every person has something they absolutely adore and would like to do <br/>
for the rest of their life,&quot; Abby said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If you can pinpoint that, and have your kids run with it, you&#39;d be <br/>
amazed how excited your kids can be about learning.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1961246157">Hi All! <br/>
Do any of you know the Stewarts personally?  I&#39;d like to welcome her <br/>
to NJ! I know she&#39;s going to be busier than a 1-armed paper hanger <br/>
once she gets here, but I&#39;d like to welcome her all the same. Our <br/>
family lives on the coast, but I&#39;m sure that there are quite a few <br/>
people in the Princeton area who would like to to welcome her as well.<br/>
Happy New Year!<br/>
