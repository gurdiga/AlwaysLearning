FAB response Joyce!!!  I don&#39;t think the Coke snorting thing would go over as <br/>
well with the poor lady. :)<br/>
I have to wonder if she&#39;s using the term unschooling when she means <br/>
homeschooling?<br/>

Boris and Natasha meet Cruella de Ville you mean?<br/>
&quot;Comrade Konrad and Lydia Mensapolite lured the children into their Austrian <br/>
chateaux with promises of enrichment for the gifted...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I am curious, but I don&#39;t expect the &quot;movement&quot; to go far.  When a family&#39;s <br/>
priority is giftedness, they often end up putting their kids back in school.  <br/>
Maybe it won&#39;t happen here, but I&#39;m thinking of half a dozen families who <br/>
talked long and hard about unschooling but ended up putting the kids in <br/>
private schools so they could brag about the costs and the opportunities.  <br/>
And honestly, there ARE opportunities just from being in and around privately <br/>
schooled kids.  So it&#39;s not evil all in and of itself.  <br/>
<br/>
I do feel sorry for kids who are identified as &quot;third graders&quot; or <br/>
&quot;schoolkids&quot; or &quot;profoundly gifted&quot; or any other thing besides their name or <br/>
their relationship to other real people.  Carol&#39;s daughter, Kirby&#39;s friend, <br/>
Liam&#39;s sister, the girl who works at the wildlife center--those things <br/>
describe a Renee who&#39;s a regular in our lives.  I like &quot;Renee,&quot; when people <br/>
will know who it is! <br/>

 </span></blockquote>A friend of mine was extolling the benefits and opportunities of private <br/>
schools the other day. She went on and on about the networking and social <br/>
skills ones child would gain by attending a private school. I don&#39;t think <br/>
there are any private schools in our area like this, but I could understand <br/>
this if we were on the East or West coasts (of America) or somewhere <br/>
overseas. Although I could see (in our area) the benefits of being able to <br/>
hobnob with the bigwigs at Boeing, Goodyear, Sprint, or the farmers at the <br/>
local co-op.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I must have made the mistake once (or twice &lt;g&gt;) of, when asked by someone <br/>
what grade Moly was in, saying &quot;Since she is x years old I suppose she would <br/>
be in x grade.&quot; Now Moly tells people she is in x grade. It frustrates me, <br/>
more because I am sure it is my fault, but I have tried to explain that she <br/>
shouldn&#39;t limit herself or define herself into such a small box. She doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to get it though.<br/>

peope how old she is. (A way that people oddly seem more interested in than<br/>
her actual age. Just one of those weirdnesses of adults ;-) To her it&#39;s no<br/>
more of a box than being 6 or 9 or 15.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Very true! I never thought of it that way. I just assumed that because she <br/>
had heard me make that statement that she was also putting herself into that <br/>
school equation. Thanks Joyce!<br/>
