<div id="ygrps-yiv-121097929">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking for some ideas like, &#39;I spy&#39;, word bingo, games we can do in the <br/>
car would be especially good....anything really. My daughter doesn&#39;t know <br/>
all the alphabet (she knows most of it) - so I&#39;m looking for things she <br/>
would enjoy at that level.<br/>
<br/>
She is 7, and enjoys anything that has a &#39;winner&#39;, and also anything <br/>
humorous. She wants to be able to read, and is possibly a fair way off from <br/>
that, but she wants to feel as though she is doing something to move things <br/>
along. I read to her every day, and she sometimes plays on Starfall and the <br/>
like, I read her other games for her when she is playing them, and read <br/>
signs to her etc....but I am a little lacking in imagination for more fun <br/>
things we could do.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any ideas.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2046454062">We used to play &quot;I&#39;m thinking of an animal&quot; when our son was young<br/>
<br/>
This involves one of you thinking of an animal, and the other trying to guess by asking questions, to which you can only answer yes, or no<br/>
<br/>
When we first started playing, I would have to help him decide on the questions, and then help him remember the facts he had established, but it got easier as he got older<br/>
<br/>
So, I would start with &quot;I&#39;m thinking of an animal&quot;, and I would usually get him to make his first question &quot;can it fly?&quot; or &quot;has it got legs?&quot;<br/>
if I answered yes to the legs, next question could be &quot;has it got 4 legs?&quot; and so on<br/>
<br/>
We would also try to establish things like &quot;have we got one as a pet?&quot; or &quot;Could someone keep one as a pet?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;Have you seen one in real life?&quot; (if the answer to that was yes, then &quot;Was it walking down the street?&quot; or &quot;Was it in a zoo?&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
We started with easy ones like giraffe and elephant (the early questions were often &quot;Does it have a long neck?&quot; or &quot;Does it have a trunk?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The hardest one was one my son was &quot;thinking of&quot; when he was about 10 years old.......the facts were<br/>
it had no wings<br/>
it had fur<br/>
it could live in your house<br/>
it was smaller than our cat<br/>
it had legs..... and then I established it had THREE legs....and I was totally confused....<br/>
<br/>
The answer was his cousin&#39;s hamster (which really did have 3 legs, as one had been amputated following an accident )<br/>
<br/>
Hope you enjoy playing as much as we did (and still do occasionally, and M is 14 now !)<br/>

live in Alaska and we sell Apples.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then the next person says, &quot;My name is Bonnie and my husband&#39;s name is Bob.<br/>
We live in Boston and we sell Bricks.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And so on through the alphabet making up names, places, and things to sell.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t have to know the alphabet, you can just tell her which is next.<br/>
 The most fun part of the game was to try to say funny things - unusual<br/>
names, funny places to live (like Disneyland), and especially funny things<br/>
to sell.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1282796920">My almost-7-year old likes what we call word smushing, which we often play on car drives. We play at putting two words together (often from things that we see or things in conversation) to make a new one, so a brown sheep is a breep, a cool song is a cong, a green light is a gright, and his current favourite, something that&#39;s both great and brilliant is grilliant :)<br/>

Maybe rhyming back and forth until someone can&#39;t rhyme, so the last one who named a rhyming word &quot;wins.&quot;  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>We used to play the &quot;animal game&quot; - one person would start with whatever animal they could think of. The last letter of that animal&#39;s name would be the next person&#39;s play. For example:<br/>
<br/>
1st play: Giraffe<br/>
2nd play: Elephant<br/>
3rd play: Tarantula<br/>
<br/>
Most times, when the letter &quot;t&quot; would come up, Senna would play &quot;teacup poodle&quot; or &quot;teacup animal.&quot; It became a running joke!<br/>
<br/>
We still play a version of that game, but with Pokemon names, generations, trainers&#39; names, etc., mostly when we&#39;re waiting for food at a restaurant or waiting for dad to get off a plane. <br/>
<br/>
We used to give Senna hints for answers when she was little; now she helps us with Pokemon names!</div>

<br/>
Does anyone have any more ideas? We do a lot of driving around! I’d also love suggestions for things we could do at home. Playing with words or letters on paper somehow....? All the fun ideas I find require a level of knowledge that my daughter doesn’t have yet.<br/>

I am happy and confident enough to know that she will learn eventually, but she does not want to wait. She wants to do things with me that will help her learn, but she doesn’t want to do ‘school’.

It&#39;s like walking. She can&#39;t practice her brain into developing faster.<br/>

So have fun with her doing things she enjoys. But don&#39;t lead her to believe playing games will get her reading.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1935784348">----Playing with words or letters on paper somehow....? All the fun ideas I find require a level of knowledge that my daughter doesnât have yet. ----<br/>
<br/>
My son also loves all things to do with humor and he&#39;s also 7, so I have included a few word/ letter games he has enjoyed recently.    <br/>
<br/>
I have put sticky notes on his stuffed animals to show what they are saying (they always &quot;say&quot; something funny).   We have also had scavenger hunts where there is a start and then each piece of paper says where to go next.  <br/>
I use very repetitive sayings for each game and keep the words simple, phrases short, and help read when needed.  You can supplement with pictures, too.  Example - for sticky notes on the animals, they might all say &quot;I like______.&quot;  Then finish with a word and a little picture to show that word  cookies, cake, etc...whatever your daughter will think is funny.   <br/>
Look through photos or pictures in magazines and have your daughter come up with funny captions which you write underneath.  You can go back and read them whenever she likes.  <br/>
When playing word games like rhyming, and coming up with words beginning w/ specific letters of the alphabet, try to go with themes and words your daughter thinks are funny.  My son loves bodily functions so our games often seem to revolve around poop, pee, farting, etc.   <br/>
Recently, my son has been asking to spell things and the other day in the car he wanted me to give him words to spell.  It turned into a &quot;game show&quot; complete with outrageous &quot;prizes&quot; (like a 20,000 foot eel)  for each word.  I used short easy words and said the sounds slowly so he could pick out each letter.  Your daughter might like a &quot;game show&quot; game like that (and you could adapt it in so many ways) since you could think of funny things for her to &quot;win.&quot;<br/>
Ask your daughter for game ideas, too.  Have fun. <br/>

were both reading before she was born and then she wasn&#39;t an early reader<br/>
like they had been, so, for her, it was hard to wait for her time to come.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I did was to ask her, &quot;What word do you want to read?&quot; I&#39;d write<br/>
the word on a blank index card, she&#39;d often draw something on the back of<br/>
the card. We kept them in an envelope and those were her special words.<br/>
She&#39;d come get them and practice reading them. They were not beginning<br/>
reading words - they were words like &quot;umbrella&quot; and &quot;dinosaur.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Also - some really great books by Patty Wolcott are super fun to read, use<br/>
all kinds of words, but are very very simple and repetitive. Rosie could<br/>
&quot;read&quot; them and have fun with them years before she caught on to the<br/>
letters/sounds connections. &quot;The Marvelous Mud Washing Machine&quot; is the<br/>
best! &quot;The Cake Book&quot; - also fun. Unfortunately - all out of print and some<br/>
are super expensive used. But - libraries used to have many of them. You<br/>
can find a list of them here on Amazon:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Patty-Wolcott/e/B001H6T0GQ/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1360443571&sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Patty-Wolcott/e/B001H6T0GQ/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_1?qid=1360443571&sr=8-1</a><br/>
<br/>
We had a set of Bob Books - she used those as little mini coloring books<br/>
(they are black and white line drawings). Each little book has words based<br/>
on just a sound. She liked those, but she really did NOT learn to read from<br/>
them - it was years later before she actually was able to read.<br/>
<br/>
So - those kinds of things can sort of keep her satisfied, maybe, but they<br/>
won&#39;t get her reading any faster than her brain is ready. And if they are<br/>
pushed at all as &quot;reading lessons&quot; then they could even do harm if she felt<br/>
frustrated and like she was failing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772745548">My kids, 5 and 7, really like old fashioned hangman. The older one can read<br/>
now, but the younger doesn&#39;t yet, and we played when the older didn&#39;t read<br/>
either. They know letters, and they like guessing them until they get the<br/>
word. Sometimes I change the word if they get frustrated so that they<br/>
&#39;win&#39;. We take turns writing the letters and drawing the hangman guy. You<br/>
get the idea - keep it light, keep it fun!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61834485">We would pick a book with large clear print (I think Kipper, Maisy Mouse or <br/>
Meg and Mog were best), then choose just one word that M would read out.<br/>
<br/>
So, the word might be &quot;the&quot; or &quot;ball&quot;, but he would watch out for the word <br/>
as I read the book aloud. It helped him follow the words as I read, and we <br/>
found he began to recognise the words when we were out and about.<br/>
<br/>
We also did things like counting the number of &quot;and&quot; were written on a menu <br/>
in a cafe. (and before we learned whole words, we would scan menus and signs <br/>
for a certain letter - often &quot;h&quot;, although I am not sure why we picked that <br/>
one)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, I know! And I have explained this to her, gently. She is just starting to put some pieces together I think, I have seen her spontaneously read a couple of words. And she is doing a lot of ‘what does that say?’, and I notice her looking so intently at certain things when I read them out to her.<br/>
<br/>
I have no understanding of how learning to read ‘happens’. Therefore I have no idea how to meet her request to help her. I imagine I could ‘teach’ her, through forceful repetition and memory, but she doesn’t want that and nor do I. I have no idea how she came to read the words she did, nor any idea how she comes to do the maths that she does, it all comes seemingly out of nowhere! Which is so good, and assures me that all is well. But she wants to feel that we are ‘doing’ something.<br/>
<br/>
I just feel a bit stumped. All the ideas I have are ‘schooly’. We have been given all manner of games and workbooks, we have ‘learn to read’ books, none of these appeal to either of us.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I’m looking for ideas that will help me to provide a rich environment for her that will facilitate this desire she has.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-786263523">Thank you Pam, I feel understood!<br/>
<br/>
Exactly this, I do not want to do anything that could make her feel <br/>
frustrated, but nor do I want her to feel that her request for help has gone <br/>
unmet.<br/>
<br/>
I love the cards idea! This has partly come up from her friends being able <br/>
to read, but also partly with her frustration at not being able to navigate <br/>
her new pokemon game without my help. I help her willingly, but she wants to <br/>
do it herself. I think she might like to have the words she needs written <br/>
down. Well, I will ask her.<br/>
<br/>
I will look at the books too. Thank you.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; ----Playing with words or letters on paper somehow....? All the fun ideas I find require a level of knowledge that my daughter doesn’t have yet. ----<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son also loves all things to do with humor and he&#39;s also 7, so I have included a few word/ letter games he has enjoyed recently. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have put sticky notes on his stuffed animals to show what they are saying (they always &quot;say&quot; something funny). We have also had scavenger hunts where there is a start and then each piece of paper says where to go next.  <br/>
&gt; I use very repetitive sayings for each game and keep the words simple, phrases short, and help read when needed. You can supplement with pictures, too. Example - for sticky notes on the animals, they might all say &quot;I like______.&quot; Then finish with a word and a little picture to show that word cookies, cake, etc...whatever your daughter will think is funny. <br/>
&gt; Look through photos or pictures in magazines and have your daughter come up with funny captions which you write underneath. You can go back and read them whenever she likes. <br/>
&gt; When playing word games like rhyming, and coming up with words beginning w/ specific letters of the alphabet, try to go with themes and words your daughter thinks are funny.  My son loves bodily functions so our games often seem to revolve around poop, pee, farting, etc. <br/>
&gt; Recently, my son has been asking to spell things and the other day in the car he wanted me to give him words to spell. It turned into a &quot;game show&quot; complete with outrageous &quot;prizes&quot; (like a 20,000 foot eel) for each word.  I used short easy words and said the sounds slowly so he could pick out each letter. Your daughter might like a &quot;game show&quot; game like that (and you could adapt it in so many ways) since you could think of funny things for her to &quot;win.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Ask your daughter for game ideas, too. Have fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-223433258">My youngest & I play a game called &quot;Everything, Everything, Everything&quot;, which is like &quot;Rock, Paper, Scissors&quot;, but instead of being limited by those 3 items, you can play anything at all. So, at 1,2,3, Go! we each would make a hand symbol for anything that came to mind, and then we&#39;d argue why our thing would &quot;win&quot; over the other. Lots and lots of laughs and fun - the hand symbols themselves often got us cracking up! And, while it doesn&#39;t involve writing or spelling, it certainly used lots of words! You never know where the connections of what makes up reading are going to come! My youngest seemed to form more connections with sound, and hearing things, then when we&#39;d read a book or something, he&#39;d remember a word he&#39;d heard. &quot;Oh! That&#39;s the word in that song, isn&#39;t it?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He made up a game that&#39;s also lots of fun - as you talk, replace one letter with another, then say words with the replacement letter. Let&#39;s say, replace all R&#39;s with T&#39;s, so that phrase above would become &quot;teplace one lettet with anothet&quot;. It&#39;s done by sound, so I don&#39;t think you&#39;d need to be able to spell to do it. It was amazing to me how quickly we&#39;d adapt our speech and (mostly) understand one another!  We&#39;d also replace 2 letters, which was more difficult but still doable. We found replacing 3 made it too hard to understand! We played that game a LOT a couple years ago, it&#39;s fun remembering. Temembeting.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-74390592">We played something like this, which we called sausage and mash<br/>
<br/>
I  would read a book aloud, and every word which began with &quot;s&quot; had to be replaced with &quot;sausage&quot; and every &quot;m&quot; with &quot;mash&quot; <br/>
<br/>
so, ... The girl skipped to the shop and bought some milk, became ... the girl SAUSAGED to the SAUSAGE and bought SAUSAGE MASH. <br/>
<br/>
We sometimes used other substitutes, and these got more bizarre as our son got older.<br/>
<br/>
You could try more than 2 substitutes at once, but it gets very confusing<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Playing with words or letters on paper somehow....?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I know part of your thought is to give her something to reassure her that she&#39;s practicing reading, but the actual skills involved in reading are so varied that working a jigsaw puzzle, playing a board game, even skateboarding use some of the same skills: pattern recognition, parts-to-wholes, sequencing, segmenting, using context clues. It might help her to know that! Reading looks like a magic trick revolving around words and letters... but actually, like any magic trick the real &quot;magic&quot; is the part you don&#39;t see. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I have no understanding of how learning to read âhappensâ.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s complicated! It involves several different sets of skills working together - and a slightly different set of skills depending on one&#39;s perceptual preferences. Some people are more visual, some more auditory, some more kinesthetic - everyone combines that to and extent when reading, but the exact mix varies considerably. Really, anything she does - Any kind of game or project or activity - will tie in to how she&#39;s learning to read. <br/>
<br/>
Oh! and a big part of &quot;learning to read&quot; is really learning about literacy in a wider sense. When kids learn to read early, all that happens After they crack the code, but when kids learn to read later, they&#39;re still learning about literacy itself. In that sense, your daughter is learning to read in a different order than what you expected - but she&#39;s still learning all the same/right things. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;We do a lot of driving around!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Audio books - and if she worries that she&#39;s &quot;not learning to read&quot; by listening, reassure her that she Is, she&#39;s learning about books and stories, the flow of language, vocabularly, grammar, plot, character development, symbolism... etc. Radio programs, too - NPR (in the US) is a good source of talk radio and newspaper-style reporting, as well as some entertaining shows and some actual on-air word games (Says You is very fun and funny). TED talks. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Playing with words or letters on paper somehow....? <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pictionary! and there&#39;s a Lego version: Creationary. <br/>
<br/>
Memory games of all kinds - memorizing things for fun, the memory game with cards, shell games, the party game where you look at a picture or collection of things and try to name them all a few minutes later. Hidden picture games. <br/>
