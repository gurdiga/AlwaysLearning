 </span></blockquote>I wrote a post on another list last week which got no response at all, but<br/>
I&#39;d love to discuss with *someone*!  Your dad may be the answer to the<br/>
question I pose at the very end, although I&#39;m sure there are other answers.<br/>
A hit-and-run poster with an addy which included &quot;charter.net&quot; posted,<br/>
causing quite a stir; my reply follows:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess there are many reasons people have for home schooling their<br/>
&gt; children, however, the practice seems to be moving from an occasional<br/>
&gt; thing to something that threatens the public school system.  There is<br/>
&gt; no question that everybody will not be able or want to home school<br/>
&gt; their children.  Our country became great and will remain great<br/>
&gt; because all of the public are educated in the public school system..<br/>
&gt; Not to have a public school system would result in our living in a<br/>
&gt; country  with countless uneducated masses.  The public school system<br/>
&gt; is being left with those parents who are disengaged from the<br/>
&gt; education of their children while those of us who care about<br/>
&gt; education are withdrawing our support.  Lots of time and effort are<br/>
&gt; put into home schooling... How much better our public school system<br/>
&gt; would be if you parents would put even a small percentage of that<br/>
&gt; time into volunteering your help, opinions and concerns with the<br/>
&gt; public school system.  Just think about that.......<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This post has given me something to think about... the term &quot;Stockholm<br/>
Syndrome&quot; popped into my mind reading it; you know, when victims identify<br/>
with their captors.  I just love to Google anyway, so I found this below.<br/>
I&#39;d never thought about public school and its students, teachers, graduates<br/>
and supporters in this way before:<br/>
<br/>
from <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010802090349/www.pt7.com/public/articles/stockh">http://web.archive.org/web/20010802090349/www.pt7.com/public/articles/stockh</a><br/>
olm.htm<br/>
<br/>
Emotional Bond <br/>
The Stockholm Syndrome is an emotional attachment, a bond of interdependence<br/>
between captive and captor that develops &#39;when someone threatens your life,<br/>
deliberates, and doesn&#39;t kill you.&#39; (Symonds, 1980) The relief resulting<br/>
from the removal of the threat of death generates intense feelings of<br/>
gratitude and fear that combine to make the captive reluctant to display<br/>
negative feelings toward the captor or terrorist. In fact, former hostages<br/>
have visited their captors in jail, recommended defense counsel, and even<br/>
started a defense fund. It is this dynamic, which causes former hostages and<br/>
abuse survivors to minimize the damage done to them and refuse to cooperate<br/>
in prosecuting their tormentors. &quot;The victims&#39; need to survive is stronger<br/>
than his/her impulse to hate the person who has created the dilemma.&quot;<br/>
(Strentz, 1980) The victim comes to see the captor as a &#39;good guy&#39;, even a<br/>
savior. This condition...occurs in response to the four specific conditions<br/>
listed below:<br/>
<br/>
*    A person threatens to kill another and is perceived as having the<br/>
capability to do so.<br/>
*    The other cannot escape, so her or his life depends on the threatening<br/>
person.<br/>
*    The threatened person is isolated from outsiders so that the only other<br/>
perspective available to her or him is that of the threatening person.<br/>
*    The threatening person is perceived as showing some degree of kindness<br/>
to the one being threatened.<br/>
<br/>
It takes only 3-4 days for the characteristic bond of the Stockholm syndrome<br/>
to emerge when captor and captive are strangers. After that, research shows,<br/>
the duration of captivity is no longer relevant.<br/>
***<br/>
<br/>
I realize children are not actually threatened with *death* in kindergarten,<br/>
but consider the trauma of separation from the parent; those photos of<br/>
children clinging to mommy as they are taken, crying, aboard a bus that<br/>
first day of school are a regular feature of September newspapers, and<br/>
something our society takes for granted as *normal,* a part of growing up.<br/>
Kids get used to it, right?  (They can&#39;t escape.)  After a month or two,<br/>
(with compliance from their parents, who continue the school&#39;s program by<br/>
enforcing homework and sending them back every day) they love school, don&#39;t<br/>
they?  The teacher gives out stickers and candy and grades (sometimes good<br/>
ones which please the parents) and is kind (unless a child misbehaves; it<br/>
only takes one or two &quot;examples&quot; to bring the rest under control).<br/>
<br/>
The duration of captivity seems to continue into adulthood for some people.<br/>
I wonder what makes the difference in those of us who reject school?<br/>

<br/>
Regarding the reply that you posted, I&#39;m afraid I have to disagree <br/>
with two of the points that you made:<br/>

are disengaged from the&gt; &gt; education of their children while <br/>
those of us who care about&gt; &gt; education are withdrawing our <br/>

<br/>
While I believe that in general homeschooling parents are by <br/>
necessity more involved in their child&#39;s education than parents of <br/>
publicly or privately schooled kids, to suggest that the parents of  <br/>
schooled kids are less involved is sort of a broad and unfair <br/>
generalization. While my kids were in the public school system, I <br/>
worked in the classroom on a weekly basis, drove on fieldtrips <br/>
and participated in the PTA. It was partly because of my direct <br/>
involvement with the school that I made the decision to <br/>
homeschool my children.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of time and effort are&gt; &gt; put into home schooling... How <br/>

school system.  Just think about that.......<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid that many of the issues that I had with the school <br/>
system were related to district policy, the tenure system, faculty <br/>
politics, and the inability or unwillingness of teachers to innovate, <br/>
and were not solvable by spending more of my time at the <br/>
school. It&#39;s been my experience that teachers do indeed <br/>
appreciate an extra pair of hands in the classroom, but really <br/>
don&#39;t appreciate it when you state your concerns. The school is <br/>
more than happy to have parents work on fund raising, or help <br/>
out in the cafeteria. They&#39;re not as thrilled at the prospect of <br/>
parents meddling in their jobs, but that&#39;s what it would take to <br/>
solve many of the problems.<br/>

What I mean is, some people seem to get &#39;addicted&#39; to things <br/>
and need &#39;crutches&#39; more than others.  By &#39;addicted&#39; I mean <br/>
emotionally and/or physically.  I am one of those that don&#39;t seem <br/>
to get attached to things in a compulsive way.  Maybe that allows <br/>
some people to think outside the box more so than others.  I do <br/>
know that for my mom it&#39;s been a struggle to understand <br/>
homeschooling, and she definitely struggles to think outside the <br/>
box.<br/>
 <br/>
By the way, thanks so much to those people we had lunch with at <br/>
the conference and to Sandra and Pam S. especially for helping <br/>
so much in my endeavour to enlighten my mom.  She was very <br/>
impressed with you guys and it helped her tremendously to hear <br/>
unschooling described in such a succinct and eloquent manner.<br/>
<br/>
What I had, that influenced me, was 3 years of &#39;alternative&#39; <br/>
education in an &#39;experimental&#39; classroom from 3rd to 5th grades.  <br/>
This meant no desks, lots of free and outside time, and we <br/>
estimated the amount of work we could do in a week and so <br/>
were sort of (we had to do some work in each subject area, after <br/>
all it was still public school!) allowed to be in charge of what we <br/>
were doing.  Just a few weeks ago (before we went to the <br/>
conference) my mom commented on how &quot;damaging those <br/>
years were to my education&quot;.  I countered with, &quot;on the contrary, I <br/>
think it was those years that liberated me and allowed me to see <br/>
what education and learning could be&quot;.  I don&#39;t think I could ever <br/>
accept the &#39;norm&#39; again after that.  I knew there was a better way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-306772731">Actually I made a mistake.  Parents had to volunteer in the classroom 2<br/>
hours a month, and only 50% of the parents did this, and this was a<br/>
special program that had one class in each grade.  Most of the school<br/>
was no participation from parents except field trips, PTA (which takes<br/>
time away from family).  Lisa<br/>

I agree with this.  My son was in the PIC classroom  which stands for<br/>
Parents in the Classroom.  This involved monthly meetings and<br/>
volunteering 2 hours a week.  If you worked you could do that work by<br/>
making phone calls, and other things at home.  About 50% of the parents<br/>
were involved all the time.  Lisa<br/>

<br/>
Hi, Nancy-<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the reply that you posted, I&#39;m afraid I have to disagree <br/>
with two of the points that you made:<br/>
<br/>
The public school system&gt; &gt; is being left with those parents who <br/>
are disengaged from the&gt; &gt; education of their children while <br/>
those of us who care about&gt; &gt; education are withdrawing our <br/>
support. <br/>
<br/>
While I believe that in general homeschooling parents are by <br/>
necessity more involved in their child&#39;s education than parents of <br/>
publicly or privately schooled kids, to suggest that the parents of  <br/>
schooled kids are less involved is sort of a broad and unfair <br/>
generalization. While my kids were in the public school system, I <br/>
worked in the classroom on a weekly basis, drove on fieldtrips <br/>
and participated in the PTA. It was partly because of my direct <br/>
involvement with the school that I made the decision to <br/>
homeschool my children.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of time and effort are&gt; &gt; put into home schooling... How <br/>
much better our public school system&gt; &gt; would be if you parents <br/>
would put even a small percentage of that&gt; &gt; time into <br/>
volunteering your help, opinions and concerns with the&gt; &gt; public <br/>
school system.  Just think about that.......<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid that many of the issues that I had with the school <br/>
system were related to district policy, the tenure system, faculty <br/>
politics, and the inability or unwillingness of teachers to innovate, <br/>
and were not solvable by spending more of my time at the <br/>
school. It&#39;s been my experience that teachers do indeed <br/>
appreciate an extra pair of hands in the classroom, but really <br/>
don&#39;t appreciate it when you state your concerns. The school is <br/>
more than happy to have parents work on fund raising, or help <br/>
out in the cafeteria. They&#39;re not as thrilled at the prospect of <br/>
parents meddling in their jobs, but that&#39;s what it would take to <br/>
solve many of the problems.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding the Stockholm Syndrome:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I wonder what makes the difference in those of us who reject <br/>
 </span></blockquote>school?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s usually the parents who are doing the rejecting, rather than <br/>
the inmates, I mean, kids. I enjoyed (? was saddened!) reading <br/>
the section about the Stockhlom Syndrome while thinking of the <br/>
teacher-student relationship. There&#39;s certainly food for thought <br/>
there.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-648183837">&lt;&lt; I was very amused<br/>
that the reporter for the small village weekly started his report on the<br/>
school board meeting where the code was discussed by detailing the dress of<br/>
the school board members in attendance - shorts, tee shirts, sandals... all<br/>
items that would be forbidden to students under the proposed code.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS wore &quot;shorts, tee shirts, and sandals&quot; to a<br/>
professional school board meeting? No wonder people are starting to take<br/>
them less seriously.<br/>
