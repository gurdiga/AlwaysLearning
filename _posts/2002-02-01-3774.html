&lt;&lt; Yesterday, I made chocolate chip cookies.  About 10 min. before dinner my <br/>
dd asked if she could have one.  I told her I was not going to tell her what <br/>
to do but explained my thinking on the matter.  She decided to wait.  My dh <br/>
said &quot;I&#39;m glad you didn&#39;t ask me because you probably would have been sent to <br/>
your room after throwing a fit about not being *allowed* to have a cookie&quot;.  <br/>
Later on that night he told me he had a talk with my dd about how smart her <br/>
mother is.  I think I can get used to this new status! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe next time you can just say &quot;If you want to&quot; and maybe a time or two <br/>
after that you could say &quot;Yes&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
My kids still ask. I&#39;m not really sure why.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I get grumpy at Holly for asking me so many things.  I think she <br/>
has friends who ask and get told no a lot, and she likes to ask and get told <br/>
yes.  <br/>
<br/>
But for example, yesterday when we were getting ready to go to the <br/>
homeschooling group meeting, she said &quot;Mom, my nose hurts.  Can I take a box <br/>
of kleenex?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
WHY on the entire earth would I say no?  She&#39;d already talked to me about her <br/>
throat hurting a bit in the mornings, but not after lunch (it&#39;s very cold and <br/>
dry here this week--we don&#39;t have a humidifier) and that her nose was a <br/>
little snotty, but not enough to take medicine, and she definitely wanted to <br/>
go.<br/>
<br/>
I said &quot;Sure, you know you can.  Why do you ask me these things?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She just laughed and said &quot;I don&#39;t know.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m so glad you wrote this! Cacie asks me stuff a lot, and I&#39;ve never<br/>
quite understood why and it makes me feel bad sometimes, like she really<br/>
doesn&#39;t feel free to just do stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, sometimes I say &quot;no&quot; as sort of a joke, and she does this<br/>
thing where she smiles and lifts her chin and just does it anyway, so I<br/>
think she *knows*... I mean, I can see it on things where she might not<br/>
be sure her plan is going to work, like &quot;Can I use baking soda instead of<br/>
baking powder?&quot; (except that she didn&#39;t ask and we ended up with very<br/>
baking soda-y cookies) but she asks on things like kleenex boxes too<br/>
sometimes...<br/>
<br/>
Actually, she doesn&#39;t ask as much as she did when she was 7 to 8 ish, so<br/>
maybe it was a stage, or maybe it was the influence of too many old<br/>
British books and shows... &quot;Mummy, may I have a cookie, please?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes when it&#39;s really late Holly will ask if she can go to bed, and <br/>
sometimes I jokingly say no, and sometimes I seriously say no, but ask her to <br/>
do some stuff first--feed the cats, or practical little pre-sleep stuff.   <br/>
But certainly if she didn&#39;t ask and we just found her asleep, nobody would <br/>
say &quot;YOU didn&#39;t say &#39;Mother May I?&#39;&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s just conversational, with her and Cacie.  Or maybe they like <br/>
hearing &quot;Sure!&quot; a lot.  (I wish I could have heard that a lot when I was a <br/>
kid.)<br/>

they care about your needs and concerns, too, and they&#39;re checking<br/>
to make sure that their plan works for you, too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Good point.<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking, and I ask other people too.  I ask my husband or I run an <br/>
idea by him and say &quot;okay?&quot; at the end, meaning &quot;Do you see a problem with <br/>
this that I don&#39;t?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And to the kids too, I&#39;ll say &quot;After I take Kirby to karate, I&#39;m going to the <br/>
store, okay?&quot;  Partly I want an acknowledgement that they heard me.  Party <br/>
it&#39;s an indicator that they should make requests for the shopping list or say <br/>
they want to go too.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they picked it up from me.<br/>

I&#39;m so glad to hear that Tamzin&#39;s not the only<br/>
unschooler who asks permission to do stuff when the<br/>
answer is always yes. She always asks me if she can<br/>
watch a video or have something to eat or play on the<br/>
computer.<br/>
The computer I can understand, because I use it too. I<br/>
rarely watch TV though (she basically *owns* the TV<br/>
&lt;g&gt;). And I certainly have never refused her food (oh,<br/>
except the time she wanted to eat the moldy<br/>
croissant)!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My kids can watch tv anytime they want. But they ALWAYS ask if it is okay to <br/>
turn on the tv. So once somebody heard me saying that my kids had free access <br/>
to the tv and they sort of &quot;called me on it,&quot; in a critical way -- saying -- <br/>
&quot;They don&#39;t have free access, they have to ask your permission.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well - they do say, &quot;Can I watch such-and-such a show?&quot; But they aren&#39;t <br/>
asking permission - they are being polite and getting information. They want <br/>
to know if somebody else is about to want to watch something else, for <br/>
example. Or are we going to have to walk out the door to go someplace in the <br/>
middle of the show. And, maybe, they are even wondering if having the tv on <br/>
is going to bother anybody else (they know that I get tense and cranky when <br/>
the noise is there, in the background, for too long). But, now that we have <br/>
wireless headphones the noise isn&#39;t an issue anymore. YAY!!!!<br/>
