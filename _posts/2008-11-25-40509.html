<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567180466">This is anonymous but I have the okay to bring it to the list:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Anyway, my question pertains to my 6 yo son and eating.  I have  <br/>
always in the past put controls on his eating (at which I cringe when  <br/>
thinking about after what I now know) such as only &quot; healthy foods&quot;  <br/>
and sugary things very limited, organic foods, etc.  So, as you can  <br/>
expect, now that I say &quot;yes&quot; to things he asks for, he is really  <br/>
having fun.  He has been eating LOTS of cookies, ice cream, cake,  <br/>
etc.  I have been preparing monkey platters (but realize I need to  <br/>
get more creative) but he prefers the fun foods at this time.  What  <br/>
concerns me is not what he is eating because I do realize balance  <br/>
will take some time as he was pretty controlled for his whole life  <br/>
but more of &quot;how long will this last&quot; before he balances out.  What  <br/>
concerns me most is his health and frankly, he is gaining weight at a  <br/>
noticeable rate.  My husband is really concerned because he struggled  <br/>
with weight issues himself at my son&#39;s age and worries that our son  <br/>
will too.  As a mom, it is hard for me to watch him gaining weight so  <br/>
fast and instinctually not do anything about this!  However, as I  <br/>
understand it, if I put the controls back on it will keep going...and  <br/>
I really believe that at some point it will balance out...just at  <br/>
what cost to his health and weight.  I hope I am not sounding  <br/>
superficial b/c, truly, I&#39;m not...  We&#39;ve been practicing unschooling  <br/>
since the beginning of October.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;d really appreciate any help, insight, advice or comments you  <br/>
have as I really respect your ideas and love Always Learning!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1990555275">I started out ust saying &quot;yes&quot; but then I think at some point I said <br/>
something to the effect that he can eat what he wants.  He even told my <br/>
mom that he has the ability to make a decision about what and where he <br/>
eats so I think I must have told him this at some point.  I do realize <br/>
that it really is just a month so he may feel like the controls may <br/>
snap back, but my fear is that he will gain a fast, unhealthy weight <br/>
for which he&#39;ll then struggle with for a long time...perhaps even his <br/>
whole life.  As a mom, it&#39;s just so hard to stand by and watch that <br/>
happen...even though I know the outcome will be so worth it.<br/>
<br/>
His body doesn&#39;t seem as healthy as it once did...I plan on being more <br/>
active myself in the hopes it gets him interested so I&#39;m hopeful that <br/>
may help.  <br/>

I personally would try not to worry about it.  A lifetime of controls around food could take a bit of time to balance out.  <br/>
<br/>
I think kids can read us (and our feelings) very well.  It sounds like there is some fear about your ds&#39;s future health and well-being in your post.  Maybe he is feeling that fearful vibe, esp. if you&#39;re thinking these thoughts while preparing/offering him food.  Perhaps he doesn&#39;t think you&#39;ve really let go of the controls, or that you aren&#39;t comfortable with his food choices, and this might be influencing his eating?<br/>
<br/>
Another thought I have (that might help *you* to feel better/more relaxed on this issue) is to try to fit in some more really fun, exciting, active activities into your days--paintball, laser tag, ice skating, etc. (if ds is game of course) so that you&#39;re all getting lots of exercise while encouraging connection and learning together?  Perhaps finding ways to be really physical together might help you to let go of some of that fear around the food/weight issue??<br/>
<br/>
Just some thoughts I had!  I&#39;m pretty new here, so do let me know if any of my ideas are out of line w/ radical unschooling!  <br/>

 <br/>
I know that both of my boys tend to a) eat more b) gain weight  when they are <br/>
hitting a growth spurt. They usually go through a growth spurt at  the same <br/>
time, but Wyl (9) is heading into one, now, where Storm (4) seems to be  on his <br/>
usual path. Up until Wyl was around 6, he was *very* thin-to the point  that <br/>
I was starting to get concerned. He had also had a very long (years) period  <br/>
where he barely grew at all. A few months after his &quot;thinness&quot; had seemed to <br/>
get  extreme and I was really getting worried, he really started getting round <br/>
in the  middle. He got a good-sized belly and then suddenly grew several inches <br/>
and  evened out. His growth spurts have been much more even since then (not <br/>
so much  gap between them and not so much variance in the thinness/chubby belly <br/>
 department), but the pattern remains: eat then grow.<br/>
 <br/>
I think partly because we trust him to know what his body  needs food-wise <br/>
and partly because we&#39;ve not commented (within his hearing) on  his body size, <br/>
along with talking about nutrition information regularly with him  and among <br/>
the family, he has a healthy food concept. As his dad and I are both  <br/>
overweight, I occasionally worry that they (more Wyl than Storm) might develop  weight <br/>
problems, but then I remember that they have an *entirely* different  <br/>
relationship with food *and* their bodies than either one of us did/do - plus,  even <br/>
though I am obese, I like who I *am* and that is very, very important in  the <br/>
scope of things. I would far rather be fat and like me than be thin and hate  <br/>
myself.<br/>

I think the less focus on weight the better, especially in growing  <br/>
kids who do tend to bulk up several times during childhood before a  <br/>
growth spurt. This is normal and natural for them. The focus should  <br/>
be on what makes healthy bodies: finding ways that the kids enjoy to  <br/>
be active, making sure the healthy food is easy or easier to get than  <br/>
the snacky foods.<br/>

<br/>
He should feel free to ask. And he should feel that there&#39;s an  <br/>
unlimited amount (that you&#39;ll always get more from the store if he  <br/>
wants it). But you don&#39;t need it around just because you&#39;re saying yes.<br/>
<br/>
Better is baking together. There&#39;s the King Arthur Flour Whole Grain  <br/>

There are probably a lot of others too.<br/>

Yes, I guess my thought was that I *should* have a little extra <br/>
around so that he would feel like if he asked for it, it was <br/>
available to him.  But as someone else posted too, I think it makes <br/>
more sense that if he asks for it I&#39;ll put it on the shopping list.  <br/>
However, he often goes food shopping with me and chooses his snacks <br/>
and sweets so more gets purchased those times than if I went food <br/>
shopping myself :)  Last time we went shopping he wanted a large pie <br/>
and ice cream, I told him he could make a choice for one of these (I <br/>
guess not so unschooling) but I was concerned that was really too <br/>
much.  I guess that may have given him a message that there really <br/>
are still controls and limits? Would others have bought both pie and <br/>
ice cream?  Or is it really ok to just say, ok, one thing this week <br/>
and one thing next week?<br/>

however, he does have an interest in eating all (literally) the <br/>
cookies I make that day :0  <br/>

&gt; I was starting to get concerned. He had also had a very long <br/>
(years) period  <br/>
&gt; where he barely grew at all. A few months after his &quot;thinness&quot; had <br/>
seemed to <br/>
&gt; get  extreme and I was really getting worried, he really started <br/>
getting round <br/>
&gt; in the  middle. He got a good-sized belly and then suddenly grew <br/>
several inches <br/>
&gt; and  evened out. His growth spurts have been much more even since <br/>
then (not <br/>
&gt; so much  gap between them and not so much variance in the <br/>
thinness/chubby belly <br/>
&gt;  department), but the pattern remains: eat then grow.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I think partly because we trust him to know what his body  needs <br/>
food-wise <br/>
&gt; and partly because we&#39;ve not commented (within his hearing) on  his <br/>
body size, <br/>
&gt; along with talking about nutrition information regularly with him  <br/>
and among <br/>
&gt; the family, he has a healthy food concept. As his dad and I are <br/>
both  <br/>
&gt; overweight, I occasionally worry that they (more Wyl than Storm) <br/>
might develop  weight <br/>
&gt; problems, but then I remember that they have an *entirely* <br/>
different  <br/>
&gt; relationship with food *and* their bodies than either one of us <br/>
did/do - plus,  even <br/>
&gt; though I am obese, I like who I *am* and that is very, very <br/>
important in  the <br/>
&gt; scope of things. I would far rather be fat and like me than be thin <br/>
and hate  <br/>
&gt; myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2140592944">-=-I think the less focus on weight the better, especially in growing<br/>
kids who do tend to bulk up several times during childhood before a<br/>
growth spurt.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And especially just before Thanksgiving and Christmas.  Don&#39;t even  <br/>
look at it until after a solid deschooling period and into the more- <br/>
active summer months.<br/>
<br/>
Marty and Kirby both went through pudgy phases and then came out  <br/>
taller and thinner again, three or four times, and they never had  <br/>
food rules or deprivations.  Their dad was BIG from infancy.  He&#39;s a  <br/>
little over 6&#39; and his parents are 5&#39;7 and 5&#39;1 or so.  His brothers  <br/>
are shorter than he is.  His mother shamed him ceaselessly.  Proof is  <br/>
that at the table, out for lunch, last Thursday, she asked him how  <br/>
much he weighs, because he went for another plate at a Chinese  <br/>
buffet.  Keith&#39;s 52 and his mother is still ragging on him.  Holly&#39;s  <br/>
boyfriend was there to meet them for the first time and he was kind  <br/>
of stunned, even though his own mother is a shaming kind of mom.  He  <br/>
told Keith later than it seemed he (Brett) was the only one at the  <br/>
table who was surprised that the question had been asked.<br/>
<br/>
School and Keith&#39;s mom were both cruel to him when he was a kid.  My  <br/>
kids didn&#39;t have school or a food-controlling mom.  I bet all of us  <br/>
know unhappy thin people and happy fat people and shamed-to-death  <br/>
people of all sizes, so the real question for this list isn&#39;t how to  <br/>
control of manipulate people, but how to provide an environment in  <br/>
which they can grow in such calm self reflection and awareness that  <br/>
they can learn naturally from the things around them.<br/>
<br/>
My sister got divorced recently (the second time) and she lost a lot  <br/>
of weight, from stress and workaholic tendencies and increased  <br/>
smoking.  She thinks it&#39;s cool.  She&#39;s suddenly unhealthily thin (111  <br/>
pounds at one point recently and she&#39;s 5&#39;5&quot; so there&#39;s one extreme:   <br/>
the idea that emotional upheaval would create gauntness and that it&#39;s  <br/>
a great thing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Styles change over generations and from culture to culture, and  <br/>
people agitate over not having the ideal size, hair, lips, feet...    <br/>
One of the best things about unschooling is that we can focus on  <br/>
strengths and joys instead of imperfections (whether seasonal,  <br/>
temporary or permanent).<br/>

I used to tell my kids they could pick one thing, but it wasn&#39;t like  <br/>
&quot;you can&#39;t pick two things,&quot; it was like &quot;Is there something you want  <br/>
to get?&quot;  And when I leave for the store, anytime, I ask everyone in  <br/>
the house if there&#39;s something they want from the store.<br/>
<br/>
If you go and are just browsing and considering buying every single  <br/>
thing, and if he&#39;s been told no for six years, then yes, he might  <br/>
load up on more stuff than he really even wants to eat.  So maybe  <br/>
start sticking to a list for a while.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I go and browse a store.  Now it&#39;s Holly who says no all  <br/>
the time.  I&#39;ll try to buy her clothes and candy and new chapstick  <br/>
and shoes and she says no, she doesn&#39;t need them, but it&#39;s kinda cool  <br/>
to be the mother of a girl, and the youngest, who&#39;s very politely and  <br/>
enthusiastically saying &quot;Thanks, but I already have enough  <br/>
shoes&quot;  (lest anyone think it&#39;s the sullen refusal of a kid who wants  <br/>
to prove she can say no).<br/>

****What about having him carry whatever he picks through the store?  Well, maybe not the ice cream, but a bag of chips or whatever he picks.  It might be easier for him to only pick one thing if it is in his hands.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-721638784">-=-Yes, I guess my thought was that I *should* have a little extra<br/>
around so that he would feel like if he asked for it, it was<br/>
available to him. But as someone else posted too, I think it makes<br/>
more sense that if he asks for it I&#39;ll put it on the shopping list. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Try to see a large range of options, and not just huge quantities or  <br/>
nothing but a list to write on.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, he often goes food shopping with me and chooses his  <br/>
snacks and sweets so more gets purchased those times than if I went  <br/>
food shopping myself :) -=-<br/>
<br/>
I have a recommendation I think you should adopt immediately, and as  <br/>
retroactively as possible.<br/>
<br/>
Rid your vocabulary of &quot;snacks&quot; and &quot;sweets&quot; and &quot;treats.&quot;  Start  <br/>
thinking of food as food.<br/>
<br/>
-=-he ... chooses his snacks and sweets-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does he get to choose which cheese you get?  Which vegetables?    <br/>
Juice?  Bread?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do try to get him to bake with me but he doesn&#39;t have an  <br/>
interest, however, he does have an interest in eating all (literally)  <br/>
the cookies I make that day :0 -=-<br/>
<br/>
Anyone whose cookies have been counted in the past will want to eat  <br/>
lots-to-all.<br/>
<br/>
No one who has had lots-to-all from birth or for many years will want  <br/>
to eat them all.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t need to have an interest in baking for you to bake things  <br/>
for him.  Part of the glory of cookies and cake are the smells and  <br/>
sights--the bowl and spoon to lick, the feel of them hot, the  <br/>
incomparable combo of a fresh cookie and a glass of milk.<br/>
<br/>
The last two times I made cookies, I only cooked up one tray at a  <br/>
time.  The rest of the dough went into smallish containers in the  <br/>
back of the fridge.  A few days later, I made one tray of cookies.  A  <br/>
few days later, more.  My husband likes the raw cookie dough, and he  <br/>
ate a little, knowing it would be there later.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I guess that may have given him a message that there really are  <br/>
still controls and limits?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, you&#39;re still talking about controls and limits with us, about  <br/>
him.  And even if you swore a solemn oath that you would never limit  <br/>
him again, he has a lifetime of experience with you, and probably  <br/>
expects this to be temporary.  Every time you show fear or  <br/>
frustration, whether you verbalize it or not, he&#39;ll probably stuff  <br/>
his cheeks like a chipmunk thinking the whole happy deal is about to  <br/>
be rescinded.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would others have bought both pie and ice cream? Or is it really  <br/>
ok to just say, ok, one thing this week and one thing next week?-=-<br/>
<br/>
First, I would have.  But on the other hand, we keep vanilla ice  <br/>
cream as a staple item.  When it&#39;s gone we get more, and it stays in  <br/>
the freezer always, like milk and butter and eggs stay in the fridge  <br/>
always, and bread is always in the breadbox.     One can&#39;t have pie  <br/>
with ice cream unless one has both.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, you have set up two choices:  Both every time, or measured  <br/>
out by the week.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Or is it really ok -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Really ok&quot; encompasses a world.  It&#39;s really okay to spank your kid  <br/>
and ground him.  It&#39;s legal, and millions of parents want you to do  <br/>
that so they feel better.   I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re trying to figure out  <br/>
what will help him make better choices about food and to help him  <br/>
learn, and so saying he can choose one thing a week seems to me to be  <br/>
arbitrary, and a week is a long time to a six year old.<br/>

<br/>
In my head I heard the insulting kind of mom-voice that says the cake  <br/>
is evil and the apple will redeem it.<br/>
<br/>
Having sliced-up apples in a bowl on the table already, or setting  <br/>
them out while you&#39;re making a cake or getting him a slice, without a  <br/>
speech to go with it, seems great and wonderful.  Asking if you can  <br/>
give him an apple to go with cake seems very different to me.<br/>
<br/>
And if one&#39;s worried about weight gain a piece of cake and an apple  <br/>
is more fattening than just a piece of cake.  It might help it pass  <br/>
through more quickly, but...<br/>
<br/>
Now maybe apple slices baked or microwaved with sugar and cinnamon on  <br/>
them... with ice cream... :-)<br/>
<br/>
Apple slices with a little bit of cake frosting for dip... that might  <br/>
satisfy a cake or pie urge sometimes.  Apple slices with a little  <br/>
saucer of cinnamon and sugar to dip in sounds like something I want  <br/>
right now!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>she&#39;s 5&#39;5&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
**Im assuming you mean your sister in her particular situation is<br/>
unhealthy, not that anyone who is 55 and 111 lbs is unhealthy, cuz<br/>
youre logical like that &lt;g&gt; so my response isnt directed towards what<br/>
you said, just inspired by it.  So heres where reading that led me<br/>
 <br/>
Keeping weight a non-issue is just as important for kids who are thinner<br/>
than average as it is for any other kids.  Im 5 4 ½ and usually weigh<br/>
between 106-112 pounds.  Other than a few years when I was having babies<br/>
I have always been very thin, and I have always heard much more than I<br/>
would like to about it (although never from my parents, thankfully).<br/>
People call me skinny or say Im scrawny or, and this really happened <br/>
a man I had never met before, at a party, as I walked away to get food <br/>
that Im built like a carrot stick. I think I can honestly say that not<br/>
a month of my life (since I was old enough to remember) has gone by<br/>
without at least one comment about my size.  That had some serious<br/>
affects on me when I was a teenager.<br/>
 <br/>
When I was about eleven I was at a friends house. We were making dinner<br/>
with her mom.  My friend said something about me being skinny and her<br/>
mom said, Shes not skinny, shes thin.  Thats one of my first<br/>
memories of thinking about how the words we choose matter.  I was<br/>
reminded of that moment yesterday. Dagny and I were watching the clip<br/>
thats all over the internet of Martha Stewart and Snoop Dogg making<br/>
mashed potatoes (dont ask me why  apparently if I see a link enough<br/>
times I will eventually click on it) and Martha called Snoop skinny.  He<br/>
said, Im athletically built. Thats what you call this.   I filed<br/>
that away for future use.  <br/>
 <br/>
Recently at a homeschooling gathering a mom said to me, What do you<br/>
think about food?  I said, I love food. I think food is good.   Of<br/>
course, she wasnt asking whether I liked food, but what I thought about<br/>
limiting food. My answers the same either way. <br/>
 <br/>
People grow in all sorts of shapes and sizes and will have different<br/>
shapes and sizes in different seasons of their lives.  Thats not<br/>
something to worry about.  ~Rue<br/>

You&#39;re right.  I meant to make the example that sudden weight gain is  <br/>
lately  met with panic, while sudden weight loss can be praised, even  <br/>
when it&#39;s evidence of fearful stress and substance overuse as it is  <br/>
with my sister this season.  She&#39;s usually been in the 125 range and  <br/>
took a dive toward 100 all of a sudden.  All she got in person was  <br/>
praise, but it wasn&#39;t praiseworthy.<br/>

&gt; So, as you can<br/>
&gt; expect, now that I say &quot;yes&quot; to things he asks for, he is really<br/>
&gt; having fun.  He has been eating LOTS of cookies, ice cream, cake,<br/>
&gt; etc.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Can you take joy in the fun he&#39;s having?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I have been preparing monkey platters (but realize I need to<br/>
&gt; get more creative) but he prefers the fun foods at this time.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The division between &quot;fun foods&quot; and &quot;not fun foods&quot; is odd. You know that<br/>
you can make an entire forest on your plate from broccoli, right?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  What<br/>
&gt; concerns me is not what he is eating because I do realize balance<br/>
&gt; will take some time as he was pretty controlled for his whole life<br/>
&gt; but more of &quot;how long will this last&quot; before he balances out.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You still sound concerned, if you want it to stop.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  What<br/>
&gt; concerns me most is his health and frankly, he is gaining weight at a<br/>
&gt; noticeable rate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Why are you noticing? I mean... is he outgrowing his clothes? How old is he?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; My husband is really concerned because he struggled<br/>
&gt; with weight issues himself at my son&#39;s age and worries that our son<br/>
&gt; will too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So this isn&#39;t about your son, it&#39;s about your husband.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; As a mom, it is hard for me to watch him gaining weight so<br/>
&gt; fast and instinctually not do anything about this!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
So go play in the park more. Don&#39;t worry about his eating so much.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; However, as I<br/>
&gt; understand it, if I put the controls back on it will keep going...and<br/>
&gt; I really believe that at some point it will balance out...just at<br/>
&gt; what cost to his health and weight.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You might want to do some serious research into your own fears. I really dig<br/>
the stuff on the junkfood science website, about the American weirdness<br/>
about obesity. We have the most messed-up attitudes about food, and people<br/>
discuss &quot;the French paradox&quot; whereby the French eat all kinds of things we<br/>
think of as &quot;unhealthy&quot; but don&#39;t have all the &quot;effects&quot; we do. They&#39;re<br/>
beginning to figure out that eating with joy and pleasure seems to matter.<br/>
<br/>

FWIW, my older son was HUGE as a baby.... and now he&#39;s so skinny we have to<br/>
put him in drawstring pants because otherwise they slide down when he runs.<br/>
My younger son was a skinny baby, and is now thoroughly solid. Same genes,<br/>
same family, same diet, totally different attitude towards eating (for<br/>
Rowan, it&#39;s something he does because he must. For Kestrel, eating is the<br/>
focus of his world)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1522489213">i totally agree this can be said in different ways!  sometimes though, i offer a glass of milk (no allergies here) with cake or with chocolate or cookies - partly because BOTH my kids and I love that combo but sometimes they don&#39;t think of it, and also because it does address that potential need for protein to combine with the sugar....<br/>
<br/>
but that when talking about weight gain, of course it does add  more calories, too, but i also think a glass of milk and a peice of cake may sometimes fill someone up enough to not choose a second peice of cake, for instance.<br/>
<br/>
i feel for the OP, because my son, who used to be really very thin has gained a lot of weight this year - both coinciding with being 9-10 (when my daughter and i both went through a pre-growth spurt weight gain phase, and i think a lot of kids do), and coinciding with our transition to fully unschooling.  however, it&#39;s been almost a year now for us, and i really have seen him go from the &quot;over consumption&quot; described in the original post to a place of really no extra energy or focus given to sweets or chips, etc. than to any other  food, and a place where he turns down sweets as often or way more often than he seeks them.  it is just a nonn-issue now.  but the weight remains, and although i am personally not too worried about it, and have never mentioned it to him - HE is very very self conscious about it and hates it, hates his body, is very self deriding (even though he has never heard any of use speak about ourselves or anyone else that way), but feels incapable of making lifestyle changes (too much pressure for him right now) to actively address it.  <br/>
<br/>
my hope and assumption is that  his body will continue to change, with growth and development and that his negative feelings about it are short term, both because of future changes (physically) and because he will also be growing and developing emotionally.  i would love input though, from anyone whose *child* was concerned, but not old enough/emotionally ready to alter their life to prioritize it.  but i do want to reassure the OP that the hyperfocus on foods will very very likely fade as the trust that this approach is here to stay builds.<br/>
<br/>
warmly, Lyla<br/>

that<br/>
you can make an entire forest on your plate from broccoli, right?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I missed that one the first time.<br/>
<br/>
He got that &quot;fun food&quot; idea from his parents and from the way food  <br/>
was handled before last month, so you need to give it time.  Half a  <br/>
year or more.<br/>
<br/>
During that time, maybe read all this:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a><br/>
<br/>
And maybe read it all (and there&#39;s a lot of it) again in a month or  <br/>
so.  It can&#39;t hurt.  Every moment you spend reading there and the  <br/>
links from those, you&#39;re not pressuring or watching or measuring or  <br/>
worrying your child, and the less you look at him and think about  <br/>
food, the less he&#39;ll think about food too.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Eeek.  That program...  Channelling 40,000 year old anybody.  I  <br/>
object.  Not as good as looking at living children in our own homes.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s  a little bit on eating in peace and joy, though:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/eating/peace">http://sandradodd.com/eating/peace</a><br/>
<br/>
As to a mom changing her point of view on what&#39;s &quot;fun&quot; (regarding  <br/>
food or anything), there are words and phrases that live in people  <br/>
like tumors and they come back and get big when there&#39;s worry, and  <br/>
they have recordings in them, and sometimes mean faces and finger- <br/>
wags.   The fewer of those recordings your own children have of you,  <br/>
the better.<br/>
<br/>
These are bigger than just separating &quot;fun food&quot; from [what kind of  <br/>
food?], but it&#39;s the same idea, and trying to take all words  <br/>
seriously is good.  People don&#39;t say or write something without it  <br/>
having passed through thought.  It&#39;s easier to change words than  <br/>
thoughts, and by hearing the words it&#39;s easier to be aware of the  <br/>
thoughts.<br/>

**Absolutely. <br/>

I was thinking a bit more about this, and about the fact that probably<br/>
most of the times people comment to me they mean it some sort of<br/>
positive way.  From my end, though, that never made any difference.<br/>
Making an issue of someone&#39;s size doesn&#39;t bring anything good to them,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1471958951"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; shopping myself :) Last time we went shopping he wanted a large pie<br/>
&gt; and ice cream, I told him he could make a choice for one of these (I<br/>
&gt; guess not so unschooling) but I was concerned that was really too<br/>
&gt; much. I guess that may have given him a message that there really<br/>
&gt; are still controls and limits? Would others have bought both pie and<br/>
&gt; ice cream? Or is it really ok to just say, ok, one thing this week<br/>
&gt; and one thing next week?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, it depends.  We don&#39;t have food restrictions in our house, so that<br/>
is what my kids are used to.  So, naturally I would assume that if there<br/>
was a request for both pie and icecream, that they had a good reason. <br/>
Pie a la mode perhaps!  Perhaps it was your son&#39;s way of trying to make<br/>
it a healthier choice.  Eating more fruit is good, if he was seeking out<br/>
a fruit pie with ice cream.<br/>
<br/>
Pies are good!  Pies can be good for you too, make some, they are<br/>
relatively easy, and it&#39;s not too late to go buy some while there&#39;s<br/>
still ice cream in the freezer!<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes my kids don&#39;t want anything extra from the store, just the<br/>
normal stuff, sometimes they request grapefruits, that was the last<br/>
request at our house when asked.  They&#39;ve been eating a lot of<br/>
croissants and cinnamin rolls and muffins the last week or so, so we&#39;ve<br/>
been buying that sort of stuff.  They&#39;ve done that before, and then when<br/>
they are tired of it, I will almost garauntee there will be some of it<br/>
left sitting on the shelf for a week or so, before I throw it out or<br/>
offer it to a guest.  They will even say to please not buy anymore<br/>
cinnamin rolls or whatever, because they really are tired of them.<br/>
<br/>
And sometimes, we really are going to the store with $20 and need<br/>
certain things, and they know not to ask for something huge or lots of<br/>
extra, or if they ask, they may already know that it&#39;s possible for the<br/>
answer to be &quot;no, not on this trip to the store, but maybe in a few<br/>
days&quot;.</div>

what you&#39;re eating, only eating things you really enjoy, and eating  <br/>
small portions.<br/>
<br/>
My weight loss depended on me knowing that I was never ever again  <br/>
going to deprive myself of anything I wanted to eat. Given that, I  <br/>
could freely decide what it was I actually DID want to eat and I could  <br/>
freely enjoy eating it.<br/>
<br/>
I gained back some weight after I reached my official &quot;goal weight,&quot;  <br/>
probably a result of residual feelings like &quot;Now I&#39;m FREE&quot; - so  <br/>
apparently I hadn&#39;t completely internalized the idea that I was  <br/>
already free. But after a few months of gaining, I started losing  <br/>
again when I realized I&#39;d stopped enjoying food. I once again reminded  <br/>
myself to eat what I love, no more and no less. I spent a couple of  <br/>
months eating a lot of sweets and then took stock and realized that I  <br/>
enjoyed the sweets a whole lot more when I was more choosy about them.<br/>
<br/>
Those childhood/teenagehood feelings of being limited and controlled  <br/>
are strong in our heads - I&#39;m not devastated that I regressed, I&#39;m  <br/>
glad I can recognize what&#39;s going on with me and that I know how to  <br/>
recover.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245387069">There is also a really good book written by a couple of MDs - &quot;Let  <br/>
them Eat Cake: the Case Against Controlling What Your Children Eat.&quot;  <br/>
I&#39;ve seen it, and bought it several times to give away. There are lots  <br/>
of copies available used and very cheap - just barely more than the  <br/>
shipping cost.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a summary of the book:<br/>
<br/>
Pediatrician Klenman and child psychiatrist Jellinek believe that too  <br/>
many well-meaning parents take food and rules far too seriously for a  <br/>
child&#39;s own good. While the food choices children make are sometimes  <br/>
dreadful, parents should not act as food police. Instead, all would do  <br/>
well to place food choices in proper perspective: children are not  <br/>
middle-aged people, their nutritional needs are different from  <br/>
adults&#39;, food is (usually) not a life-and-death issue for them, and  <br/>
one or two not so nutritious meals will not hurt them. Therefore,  <br/>
suggest the authors, kids shouldn&#39;t worry about cholesterol or feel  <br/>
guilty because they enjoy a candy bar. Although some parents may  <br/>
believe otherwise, these doctors declare studies have shown that  <br/>
banning sweets is counterproductive. Children, they say, should be  <br/>
offered choices and encouraged to try new foods. This is a sensible,  <br/>
well-written and unhysterical approach to what some may consider a  <br/>
parental nightmare: children who have minds of their own when it comes  <br/>
to food. In addition to questions most often asked by parents, the  <br/>
authors also provide in-depth discussion of food safety, food  <br/>
allergies and eating disorders.<br/>
