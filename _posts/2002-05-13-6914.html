 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I had some &quot;challenges&quot; with the military and the vaccination issue too.  <br/>
Before we went to Ok. we had to have physicals and were told by the military <br/>
that all had to be updated with shots.  We went to the lawyer on base (he was <br/>
so thrilled thinking it would be a big case - he was tired of power of <br/>
attorney).  In the end I found an ad in Mothering magazine to write to this <br/>
&quot;church&quot; and get a letter from them saying that vaccination was against our <br/>
religion.  I sent them a donation!!!  That worked to get us exempt from the <br/>
govn requirement.  Used that old letter again when my oldest son was in the <br/>
college dorm and they said he needed to have something - I think MMR??  <br/>
Anyway, we went to Okinawa in our sadly unvaccinated state :-).<br/>
<br/>
An American friend had Ok. midwives at her homebirth.  Her husband was not <br/>
military.  I went to an Ok. clinic to get set up for my Rh- shot after birth. <br/>
 Told the young doctor there that I had had all my babies at home (not true, <br/>
unfortunately).  He just gave me tubes to collect cord blood.  When we went <br/>
in for the shot, an older doctor was there and was VERY disapproving of what <br/>
we had done, but did give me the shot.<br/>
<br/>
I think attended homebirths were ok there, but the majority of women went to <br/>
birth centers and had doctors for &quot;western&quot; style births.<br/>
