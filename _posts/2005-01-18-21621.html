Lately I am a failure to finish Kirby&#39;s shower.  I&#39;m up to  the  <br/>
grout-sealing <br/>
and teensy detail stuff.  I should just go  and do that.   Really.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I may have you beat, I started the boys&#39; bathroom the summer of 2003.  <br/>
OK---the tile is all done. I finally finished grouting it and sealed it a  few weeks <br/>
ago. <br/>
 <br/>
Left to do: <br/>
put shower fixtures on<br/>
caulk<br/>
shave the bottoms of the doors and reinstall<br/>
lay threshold (and grrrrrout!)<br/>
buy, cut, paint, and nail up baseboard<br/>
 <br/>
You&#39;d think in two years I could have found the time to do these piddly  <br/>
little things. I can (and probably WILL) do *many* more piddly things  before <br/>
these are done!<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a lister---I write lists. Every day. My goal is to do one *big*  thing OR <br/>
two *little* things every day. (That&#39;s not including all the  &#39;every day&#39; <br/>
things that get done---laundry, dishes, etc.) This list includes the  conference, <br/>
home repairs, bee checks, biggish garden projects, dog baths (for my  own), <br/>
etc.<br/>
 <br/>
Often those little things get lost----but the caulk gun made it from the  <br/>
garage to the porch yesterday---and into the kitchen today! &lt;G&gt; Maybe  there&#39;s <br/>
hope! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Good luck with your grrrrout sealing!<br/>
