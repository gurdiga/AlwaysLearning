<div id="ygrps-yiv-800168857">Greetings fellow unschoolers!<br/>
<br/>
My good friend Blake Boles (who brought you Unschool Adventures) has a new project up his sleeve for teen un/homeschoolers-- Homeschool Leadership Retreats! Below is his pitch for HLR, and I will be working as a volunteer at the first retreat in May. Check it out!<br/>

I&#39;m proud to announce a NEW program for teenage homeschoolers & unschoolers: Homeschool Leadership Retreats.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschool Leadership Retreats (&quot;HLR&quot;) offers fun, independence-building sleep-away programs for self-directed teens ages 14-17.  We give teens the tools, attitudes, and confidence to figure out and pursue their dreams.<br/>
<br/>
Our first retreat will be held in Ashland, Oregon, from May 9-23, 2010.  This two-week adventure includes exciting community-based activities, interactive leadership workshops, and special trips to Crater Lake, the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, and a high ropes course!  <br/>
<br/>
You can learn more about HLR and our upcoming retreats at:<br/>

An $150 Early Enrollment discount is available until January 9th, and $200 work-trade scholarships are available as well.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your time!<br/>
