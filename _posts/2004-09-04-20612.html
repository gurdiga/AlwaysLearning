<div id="ygrps-yiv-1938777343"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; they immediately proclaim that my daughters are just &quot;naturally&quot; that way<br/>
&gt; and that THEIR children are much, much different temperamentally.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hear this ALL the time!  It would never work with *their* children, you<br/>
just don&#39;t understand, etc.  That seems to close the subject in their mind<br/>
&#39;whew! I don&#39;t have to do this respectful parenting thing - my kids are<br/>
just too wild&#39;.  <br/>
