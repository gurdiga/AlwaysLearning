May contain nuts.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I exchanged a couple of e-mails with James Atherton, who studies (in  <br/>
quite an unschooling kind of way) and writes about learning in a way  <br/>
most-to-all of you would really appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
But I just  noticed as I was filing the letters (&quot;filing&quot; on my  <br/>
computer) his sigline:  &quot;May contain nuts,&quot; in reference to his  <br/>
webpages, which have really easy access to some other theorists&#39;   <br/>
ideas too.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a great directory page to the learning theories.  Even if you  <br/>
just like graphics or page design and don&#39;t care about the content,  <br/>
it&#39;s worth a look:<br/>

<br/>
I loved this, from his resume:<br/>
<br/>
======================================================================== <br/>
=============<br/>
Current research<br/>
<br/>
Further development of doctoral research in the light of theories of  <br/>
complex adaptive systems<br/>
<br/>
Computer-aided and experiential learning<br/>
<br/>
Unintentional learning and hidden curriculum in FE/HE/professional  <br/>
training<br/>
<br/>
------------------------------------------------------------------------ <br/>
----------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Lots of what he&#39;s writing about has to do with adult education, the  <br/>
kind of training businesses do with/for/on their employees, and  <br/>
that.  I used one of his graphs on this page, which I don&#39;t think I  <br/>
had announced yet:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>
and we corresponded about that and some other stuff, but it was (from  <br/>
my point of view) concerning a philosophy discussion series I&#39;m  <br/>
having within the SCA.<br/>
<br/>
Those of you who care about such things as models of learning,  <br/>
though, could find some cool things to think about, like this page  <br/>
that talks about different ways of learning, and one is a pretty  <br/>
clear picture of the &quot;collect the dots&quot; stuff I&#39;ve talked about at  <br/>
conferences.  You don&#39;t need to read the words; the graphs are clear:<br/>

<br/>
I like the way his pages have comment boxes and links along the side  <br/>
as you learn.  I might try to learn that code trick.<br/>
Here&#39;s something on learning curves and that second graph is really  <br/>
helpful to me, to see how something can be useful even if it&#39;s not  <br/>
yet &quot;internalized&quot; (second nature).<br/>
