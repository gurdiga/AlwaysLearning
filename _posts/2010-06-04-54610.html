<div id="ygrps-yiv-2022166933">Regarding mathematics, I just heard that Martin Gardner died in May. We have<br/>
some of his puzzle books for kids.<br/>
<br/>
Quote from one of his obits:<br/>
&quot;He was not a mathematician � he never even took a maths class after high<br/>
school � yet Martin Gardner, who has died aged 95, was arguably the most<br/>
influential and inspirational figure in mathematics in the second half of<br/>
the last century.&quot;<br/>

Molly spent several weeks this winter making flexagons - it was an outgrowth<br/>
of her interest in paper airplanes and origami. Gardner was the person who<br/>
popularized them. Here&#39;s a link that we used to find out how to do flexagons<br/>
and many variations<br/>
