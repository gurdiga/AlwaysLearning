<div id="ygrps-yiv-113059647">Julie Brennan at Livingmath.net has a great compilation ....<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.livingmath.net/Library.html">http://www.livingmath.net/Library.html</a><br/>
<br/>
There are really too many there to choose from  :-)  We have by no means <br/>
tried all of the books on her site, and just because I don&#39;t say it&#39;s <br/>
one of our favorites, doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t good (we may not have read <br/>
it yet).  Sometimes I&#39;m really surprised by my kids....they didn&#39;t like <br/>
the Greg Tang books *at all*, but Math Talk, a book of poems, was a big hit.<br/>
<br/>
Just to illustrate how these books can get into your head....We read The <br/>
Number Devil as a read aloud and finished it recently.  There was a lot <br/>
of cool math in there, some of it left me scratching my head (not out of <br/>
lack of understanding, but of wonderment).  If math had been presented <br/>
to me as a child the way it was in that book, I would have found it a <br/>
lot more interesting.  There are mysteries to solve that I had no idea <br/>
existed before this book!  It left me with an understanding of how <br/>
mathematicians can dedicate their lives to solving one of these <br/>
mysteries.  The book was fun even for my 5 year old, even though the <br/>
majority of the math was over her head.  Yesterday, a good week after we <br/>
finished the book, my 9yo came to me in bed first thing in the morning <br/>
and told me that 128 was a &quot;hopping number&quot; (a term used in the book for <br/>
powers of 2;  128 = 2^7).  Then he said, &quot;mom all the hopping numbers <br/>
will be even.&quot;  Then he told me the next few hopping numbers.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
A big plug for Cyberchase too....today my 10 and 9yo&#39;s were discussing <br/>
the fraction 3/5. The 10 told the 9yo, that&#39;s the same as 6/10, and <br/>
60/100 and the same as 60%.  The 9yo said &quot;oh yeah&quot; and then proceded to <br/>
determine decimal and percentages for 1/3, 1/5 and 3/4.  I asked them <br/>
where they learned all of that, and they said &quot;Cyberchase&quot;.  In all <br/>
seriousness, I&#39;ve had college students that couldn&#39;t do this, so I&#39;m <br/>
impressed that my kids could pick it up in ONE episode!  They must have <br/>
explained it well.<br/>

where they learned all of that, and they said  &quot;Cyberchase&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
 <br/>
Holly learned a TON from Cyberchase, and watched it religiously for a  while, <br/>
yelling for me to come and see the good parts (because she&#39;d seen all the  <br/>
episodes and knew what was coming).  <br/>
 <br/>
Now she&#39;s learning as much (but more subtly) from playing video games that  <br/>
aren&#39;t overtly mathematical.<br/>
 <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t try to press a kid to watch cyberchase just to learn math, but  if <br/>
you-the-mom (whichever reader, nobody in particular) would watch it you might <br/>
 like math more, and your kids might come to see what you&#39;re watching, and <br/>
you  might see it enough to be able to call them for the good parts.  One thing  <br/>
Holly&#39;s shown everyone in our family is when one of the real-life characters  <br/>
complains that they put her on the outside track in a race, and that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
fair, so she runs around the outer AND the inner uncomfortably bent over <br/>
pushing  a measuring wheel to prove it&#39;s longer than the others, and ends up <br/>
showing the  kids that it&#39;s not longer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is longer, though, of course. And the person on the outer track <br/>
SHOULD complain. That&#39;s why races starts are staggered. For example, on <br/>
a typical track, it takes 4.00 laps to go one mile on the inside lane <br/>
and 3.6 laps to go one mile in lane 8.Think about it - the distance <br/>
around a dime versus the distance around the world? The bigger the <br/>
circle, the bigger the circumference, for sure.  On a track, this gets <br/>
pretty complicated to calculate, because it isn&#39;t a &quot;circle&quot; and so you <br/>
have to take into account the &quot;sharpness&quot; of the turns being different <br/>
in the different lanes and how much of the race is straight. But there <br/>
are formulas to do this and people who are into racing are VERY well <br/>
aware of the differences in distance. They use these formulas for <br/>
figuring out how far apart the racers are when they start a race - how <br/>
staggered the starting points are in the different lanes will be <br/>
different depending on the length of the race.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944038828">But it is longer. The circumference of a larger oval (or circle) is greater than that of a smaller oval (or circle).<br/>
<br/>
In races, like the Olympics, they stagger starting and ending points because of this.<br/>
<br/>
Is this a TV show? I&#39;ve never heard of it (we don&#39;t have cable, though) but I do like watching shows and finding the errors.... ;-)<br/>

Right. She ran the marked courses from the staggered starting lines to show  <br/>
they were the same distance.<br/>
