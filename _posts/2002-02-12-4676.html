Hi Pat,<br/>
<br/>
I think it takes time for many of us to rediscover how fascinating the world<br/>
is.  I think it is a gradual thing....as we move away from the frantic need<br/>
to follow some type of schedule or curriculum, as we begin to once more<br/>
actually breathe rather than pant, as we relax into ourselves, our children,<br/>
and our lives....it starts to happen.<br/>

<br/>
Now that I have a purpose to be knowledgeable, maybe I can pursue this.  Too bad my memory is not what it used to be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So what *does* a person need to know to be knowledgeable?  Isn&#39;t that going <br/>
to be different for everyone?  What do *you* need to know, right now, to <br/>
become more knowledgeable?  What&#39;s the next step on *your* path?  I think <br/>
that&#39;s actually more valuable than knowing what your kids need to <br/>
know.  (If that&#39;s even possible, given the ways that the world will have <br/>
changed even by the time they grow up.)<br/>
