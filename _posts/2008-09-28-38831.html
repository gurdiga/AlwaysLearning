<div id="ygrps-yiv-1575903971">I have been homeschooling my son Storm(8) for 3 yrs this year I have <br/>
found the amazing unschooling idea which to me is a god send for Storm. <br/>
He is just that kind of kid. He hates sitting down and being forced to <br/>
read and write he wants to do.The thing I need help with is this. My <br/>
hubby worked from home the other day and saw that our day had shifted <br/>
away from last years model of following the curric. and lots of work <br/>
pages/instruction and he said &quot;you haven&#39;t done any school work!&quot; He <br/>
now thinks we are doing our son a disservice keeping him home and that <br/>
he will be so far behind his peers. I am educating him on unschooling <br/>
but in the meantime are there activities/ideas/things I can do that are <br/>
unschooling friendly so when my hubby asks what we did there shows <br/>
some &quot;educational pursuit&quot;? I am new at this!:)I hope to get much <br/>
better and more confident before my other 2 are older...</div>

 </span></blockquote>The trick is to see the learning in what they&#39;re doing. Playing with  <br/>
LEGOs isn&#39;t just playing with LEGOs. It&#39;s structural engineering.  <br/>
It&#39;s 3D modeling. It&#39;s fractions. (How many smaller bricks can fit in  <br/>
when you don&#39;t have any of the bigger bricks left?) (Others will have  <br/>
some more ideas, I&#39;m sure.)<br/>
<br/>
Well, I shouldn&#39;t say trick. Real learning is messy. It bears no  <br/>
resemblance to school learning. If you pay attention to how your  <br/>
youngest are learning language it looks nothing like Spanish class!  <br/>
And yet it works beautifully and painlessly. The same can&#39;t be said  <br/>
about Spanish class ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So by breaking real learning down into schoolish looking learning, it  <br/>
does a disservice to real learning. Dumbing it down so to speak! It&#39;s  <br/>
not a goal of unschooling to see how unschooling matches school. But  <br/>
seeing how kids are learning what they might in school by playing  <br/>
*can* be a way to soothe fears so a parent can absorb what&#39;s even  <br/>
better about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And it can help spouses. Spouses are often cut off from so much of  <br/>
what goes on, they only get glimpses of the surface. He&#39;s worried   <br/>
because he cares.<br/>
<br/>
The thing that seems to have helped a lot of dads is getting them to  <br/>
an unschooling conference so they can see older unschooled kids who  <br/>
aren&#39;t slack jawed droolers useful only for the loading docks at Wal- <br/>
Mart ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a list at the Radical Unschooler&#39;s Network:<br/>

(Unfortunately the tags are case sensitive so the lists are on two  <br/>
separate pages.)<br/>

<br/>
Ah.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s oldest brother was the jock star of the family (didn&#39;t waste  <br/>
ANY of his time with music or theatre or hobbies, got a degree with  <br/>
Navy ROTC, went to the Navy, married into money (in addition to  <br/>
saving his own with furious interest; that was his hobby), was  <br/>
ignored out of the navy, went to work for a naval contractor, didn&#39;t  <br/>
do fantastically well there, separated from his family, took a part- <br/>
time job at WalMart because he as renting a room from an elderly  <br/>
person (one of a series of three over several years) and retired and  <br/>
now works at WalMart.<br/>
<br/>
If Marty were to go and work at WalMart (which he isn&#39;t planning to  <br/>
do), he could probably do better in life than Keith&#39;s brother did,  <br/>
and Keith&#39;s brother &quot;did things right.&quot;  His parents were proud of him.<br/>
<br/>
This is not about WalMart.  It&#39;s about prejudices and expectations  <br/>
and the promise of the glory of staying on the assembly line.<br/>
<br/>
If someone new to unschooling is trying to sort out what their fears  <br/>
are, it might help enormously to make a list of friends and  <br/>
relatives, their degrees and education and certifications and all  <br/>
that, and what they&#39;re doing for a living now.  I think everyone&#39;s  <br/>
list will have people with &#39;degrees they don&#39;t use&#39; (as they say,  <br/>
which is tacky, but for the sake of this I&#39;m using it) and some with  <br/>
great jobs that needed no degree at all.<br/>
<br/>
