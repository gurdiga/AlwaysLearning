<div id="ygrps-yiv-1834495573"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote> Hey, there are families with terminally ill children who make them go to<br/>
 school to the end.  WHY!?? (Why!?? said the mom who doesn&#39;t make her kids<br/>
go<br/>
 to school at all....)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yeah that was the other thing!  Probably so that the child can still lead<br/>
a<br/>
&quot;normal&quot; life. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that is what it is!  I am on an e-mail list of other parents of kids<br/>
with cancer, and this is what they talk about.  For a lot of the kids who<br/>
have been in school, it&#39;s more of a &quot;be with my friends&quot; kind of thing (the<br/>
same thing I hear from potential homeschoolers....the parents are ready to<br/>
pull the kids out but the kids don&#39;t want to leave their friends, or be<br/>
&quot;weird&quot; or whatever.  I&#39;m the opposite.  Even knowing that my child has an<br/>
80%+ cure rate, I want to spend as much time with him as possible, because I<br/>
want to have no regrets later (also one of the reasons I homeschool....who<br/>
knows what tomorrow will bring?)<br/>
