<br>someone who marked mistakes on kids&#39; work with a circled LO for learning 
<br>opportunity. &nbsp;It&#39;s a step, anyway.
<br></blockquote>
<br>
<br>It reminds me of school reform, though, or what passes for it sometimes.
<br>
<br>Schools got really excited about the idea of going from &quot;grades&quot; to indicators (and called them different things). &nbsp;But when an A,B,C,D,F system is changed to VG, G, NI, U, it doesn&#39;t take kids half a second to figure out what&#39;s what. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>I always saw red marks on writing as learning opportunities. &nbsp;That&#39;s because I wanted to learn. &nbsp;I had friends who hated red marks. &nbsp;If I got a paper with an A and no marks, and one of my two best friends in 9th grade (thinking of my favorite English teacher) got the same, they were happy, content, relieved! &nbsp;I was grumpy. &nbsp;I wanted my feedback!! &nbsp;I could have written and gotten nothing back in the privacy of my own home. &nbsp;But when the teacher found that out, he started critiquing semi-colons and dashes and word choice, and I was happier. &nbsp;
<br>
<br>In a homeschooling situation, I suppose it would depend totally on the child&#39;s temperament, the mom&#39;s attitude, and what disadvantage red marks brought. &nbsp;Was the child going to have to do the work again? &nbsp;Endure a &quot;lesson&quot; in something he just slipped up on but understands? &nbsp;If it&#39;s just a mark he can pursue or let lie, it wouldn&#39;t be too bad, I suppose.
<br>
<br>All that&#39;s just another good reason to walk away from school methods. &nbsp;Much effort and emotion stirred up over something that doesn&#39;t need to involve emotion or repetition or potential for shaming.

I graduated from UCSC in 1977.  Yes, some evals were like this, especially <br/>
the big freshman classes (Biology 101) -- but most of mine were pretty <br/>
thoughtful.  Classmates went on to medical and law school; I&#39;m sorry UCSC <br/>
went back to grades.<br/>
<br/>
As far as preparing kids for college &quot;learning opportunity marks&quot; -- by then <br/>
I hope they&#39;ll have enough confidence in themselves. and desire to learn a <br/>
particular subject, to examine feedback without falling apart or working <br/>
solely for the mark.<br/>

admissions are competitive, the learning environment really is not <br/>
(or was not when I was there).  Of course there are red marks, but as <br/>
students we _wanted_ them, in the way Sandra described in her earlier <br/>
post.  There are no general ed requirements -- each student is <br/>
responsible for coming up with a plan of study (through courses as <br/>
well as non-classroom-stuff), which they write up as a &quot;contract&quot; <br/>
that they then have with a faculty advisor.   It&#39;s still school for <br/>

interested in entering institutional schools.<br/>

When I went there (in late 80&#39;s/early 90&#39;s) it was way less expensive <br/>
for me than UC Santa Cruz (and I was a Santa Cruz resident)!<br/>

<br/>
I went to a funky private school for 2nd through 4th grade in the<br/>
seventies where we had no grades, the teachers wrote a class description<br/>
and a brief narrative report for each student, and then the students did<br/>
the same for each teacher. None of the stuff we did was graded, except<br/>
for math, which was a self-paced program that you worked through by doing<br/>
a pretest, then completing whatever stuff the pretest showed you needed<br/>
to learn, then post-testing, then either going on or doing more stuff...<br/>
but it was all mastery-based, if you got some problems wrong it just<br/>
meant you had to do that chapter... it was cool, not perfect, but<br/>
definitely my best school experience. I had a class in tea-making one<br/>
year, we were organized in multi-age &quot;pods&quot; of about 60 kids, and you<br/>
went to various classes within your pod.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180758345">My oldest daughter went to school for 5 years - K through 4th grades - and <br/>
second daughter went for 2 years and they never had a test or a report card. <br/>
They did portfolios --- it was actually very cool. The teacher had these <br/>
boxes - one for each kid - and stuff they did was stored in there for a <br/>
couple of months. The teacher also took a lot of photos - because there was <br/>
lots of active hands-on stuff and presentation-style stuff or game-play going <br/>
on in that classroom - that she couldn&#39;t &quot;store.&quot; Every couple of months the <br/>
kids would all get their boxes out and sort through the stuff - the CHILD <br/>
would decide (sometimes with some urging from the teacher) to keep a few <br/>
things for their portfolio and they&#39;d bring the rest home. I was there to <br/>
help on some of their &quot;sorting days&quot; and it was really fun. It was like going <br/>
through the past few months and remembering all the stuff they&#39;d done - the <br/>
kids would be pulling stuff out and showing it to each other and just having <br/>
a great time. <br/>
<br/>
In place of report cards there was a sheet of paper with learning objectives <br/>
on it and the teacher would circle those that were going to be focused on for <br/>
that child for the upcoming time period. It wasn&#39;t an indication of grades <br/>
earned - there were NO exams of any kind in that school - only what they <br/>
called &quot;Authentic Assessment&quot; which meant the kids did presentations or <br/>
created websites or wrote songs or made up games of various kinds or whatever <br/>
-- lots of different ways of providing opportunities for the teacher to <br/>
observe the student&#39;s abilities and skills and plan activities to support <br/>
them learning what she/he thought they needed to learn. <br/>
<br/>
(Sounded pretty wonderful until that last line, didn&#39;t it? &lt;BEG&gt;)<br/>

private school with mutual evaluations and no grades to a standard public<br/>
school. The second day, I got a paper back that I had done on the first<br/>
day, and it had a big &quot;E - &quot; in red at the top. I was just horrified...<br/>
my only experience with grades was through books, and I figured that it<br/>
went A,B,C,D,E,F and I had almost failed. It took me a day to ask anyone,<br/>
and then they explained their (E)xcellent, (S)atisfactory, (N)eeds<br/>
Improvement system... but the whole idea of being grades wigged me out<br/>
for quite a while, and then I did get pretty obsessive about it. <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I didn&#39;t want to be there at all, I spent years pining for my old<br/>
school...<br/>

red letters all over her essay - which she&#39;d written in her typical very <br/>

just the basics -- no - he scrawls across the front of her paper, right over <br/>
the whole front page:<br/>

<br/>
At home, of course, not in class &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
She is very good at people-understanding --- she realized that she should <br/>
have known that this anal-retentive guy was NOT going to appreciate reading <br/>
her ideas, creatively written. This guy LOCKS the classroom door on the <br/>
stroke of the starting time and, even in a 3-hour class, nobody is allowed in <br/>
if they are even one minute late. <br/>
<br/>
So - she basically realized that she has to think about the teacher - not <br/>
just do the assignment, but do the assignment the way she thinks the teacher <br/>
wants it done. <br/>
<br/>
Since then, she and I have both spent time trying to get information about <br/>
the teachers BEFORE she signs up for the classes --- she&#39;s had great luck <br/>
with most teachers who have really enjoyed and appreciated her creativity. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Ah.<br/>
&gt; &gt; B is almost as good as an &quot;A&quot; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; S is satisfactory!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe the 10 points was for it being the quantity and length <br/>
&gt; required, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; for being technically proficient, and the B.S. was commentary on <br/>
&gt; the amount <br/>
&gt; &gt; of analysis he thought went into it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Tacky teacher.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was three years ago - her first semester of college courses. She was <br/>
very young (just turning 14) and he was a pretty &quot;scary&quot; teacher in that he <br/>
was sharp-tongued and frequently shamed students in class. She didn&#39;t want to <br/>
bring attention to herself so she didn&#39;t ask him anything. Its too bad she <br/>
got one of those types of teachers that first semester - but she&#39;s had <br/>
wonderful luck since then, mostly okay teachers, a couple of truly GREAT <br/>
ones, and, unfortunately the only other really bad one was a math teacher who <br/>
clearly didn&#39;t see math as a spiritual/artistic/remotely enjoyable pursuit.<br/>
