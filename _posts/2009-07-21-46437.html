What is it?  that&#39;s what you left out. :-)<br/>
Is it like a parent auxiliary for the school?   Then it wouldn&#39;t make  <br/>
sense.<br/>
Is it something that parents and kids do together?<br/>
Is it for projects parents do that are of interest to kids.  Like  <br/>
parental show-and-tell?  That sounds fun.<br/>
<br/>
My answer:   It depends.<br/>
<br/>
My recommendation:  You could go to one session and let them see it  <br/>
and then you&#39;d have better reason to accept it and go with it, or to  <br/>
dissuade them.<br/>
<br/>
If it turns to &quot;no,&quot; find something cool to do on Monday nights for a  <br/>
while in those days.  Really cool.  Outside the house.<br/>

of the theater or motocross or meat or Pizza Hut, but their kids were  <br/>
increasingly curious? Wouldn&#39;t you want to say try it out, support  <br/>
their interests?<br/>
<br/>
 From a fear point of view, it makes as much sense to keep them away  <br/>
from the school as it does for parents to keep their kids away from  <br/>
sugar and commercial TV. From a supporting their interests point of  <br/>
view, your fear is your deal not theirs and is getting in the way.<br/>
<br/>
Why do you fear that this is likely to be more drawing than what you  <br/>
do at home? (If that&#39;s not your fear, think about what your fears and  <br/>
what&#39;s the worst that could happen.) By not allowing them to go, are  <br/>
you may doing as some teachers have done: covered the windows with  <br/>
paper so the teacher is the least boring thing in the room. If you  <br/>
fear home isn&#39;t as exciting as the program, then it&#39;s time to jazz  <br/>
things up!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-760615155">Denying them an activity when they&#39;re curious about it will only fuel their curiosuty. I&#39;d let them at least check it out, keeping your own hangups to yourself (or at least on the down-low). But stay involved and aware of what happens there, and always make it clear they can drop it any time they want.<br/>
<br/>
But it sounds to me like they just want to do a fun activity with their friend. Does their friend attend the school? If so, he&#39;s probably stoked about the PPP thing; I&#39;m sure the school talks it up a lot. Can you maybe get them involved in something *else* together on another night? Around here, there&#39;s a tactical laser tag night every week that all the boys want to join, schooled or not. Maybe finding something really awesome for them to do together will wipe the PPP out of their minds. :o)<br/>

I bring this up because most of the responses seem to treat it as an<br/>

The schools have LOTS of those, but they like to blame and shame them,  <br/>
and keep them back, and label and drug them.  Sometimes.<br/>

Depending on the state, public schools can offer all kinds of things <br/>
that are available to kids who don&#39;t go to the public school.<br/>
<br/>
Our local school district has instrumental music, for example, that is <br/>
open to all kids - not just public school kids. It is offered at the <br/>

Just so you know - there are LOTS of public schooled kids not reading at <br/>
7 and 8 - lots not reading at 9. My neighbor is currently teaching 3rd <br/>
grade and she told me the other day that more than half the boys in her <br/>
class were not reading at the end of the school year.  I asked her how <br/>
they take the standardized tests and she grimaced and said she figures <br/>
they just fill in the answer sheet randomly. She is new in my <br/>
neighborhood and stopped to talk to me when she saw some homeschooling <br/>
bumper stickers on my car - the bumper stickers are not unschooling, <br/>
just state homeschool association logo. So, she was chatting with me and <br/>
then, kind of shyly, she said, &quot;I&#39;ve heard of something called <br/>
unschooling and I, well, I really like the idea. Have you ever heard of <br/>
it?&quot; Her kids are 4 and 2.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - just wanted to let you know you don&#39;t have to be fearful of <br/>
people finding out they aren&#39;t yet reading. Just be matter-of-fact about <br/>
it and confident that they are on the road to reading.<br/>

Until you wrote, I had not considered how much their individual personalities also play into the decision not to put them in situations which would point out their non-reading.  Eli is VERY easily frustrated, and VERY loud about it.  Samuel on the other hand, gets very quiet and withdrawn when upset or confused or frustrated.  He would sit quietly and hide his head while getting more and more upset.<br/>
<br/>
I guess not leaving them without myself or dh has a lot of reasons behind it.  Much like our decision to homeschool and unschool!!<br/>

her Girl Scout Leader, for example. And there were times I told adults <br/>
in authority - &quot;Remember you have kids here who aren&#39;t reading yet; <br/>
please don&#39;t embarrass them.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just saying you probably don&#39;t have to worry about the school <br/>
officials thinking it is unusual for kids not to be reading by 9 years <br/>
old - because they know it is common. For them, it would be easy to just <br/>
say, &quot;We&#39;re working on it.&quot; It is other adults and some kids who can be <br/>
thoughtlessly mean about it.<br/>

I did let that through, though I was tempted to return it.  And I&#39;m  <br/>
not going to read it, because it&#39;s not in my area.<br/>
The questions were about what YOUR question really was.<br/>
<br/>
My son, Kirby, is a good counsellor.  A friend of his was depressed  <br/>
once and wanted Kirby to help him.  He asked him to help him.  So  <br/>
Kirby asked him what was going on, and the friend told Kirby &quot;It&#39;s all  <br/>
in my livejournal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So before Kirby could voluntarily help someone, he was expected to go  <br/>
and read who knows how much on a livejournal!?<br/>
<br/>
Not good.<br/>
<br/>
If people are helping you freely, make it easy for them.  And the  <br/>
first step of making it easy is to think carefully about what help you  <br/>
want and why.  Phrase your question clearly and carefully.  Just the  <br/>
act of thinking as clearly as you can will be helpful, and then the  <br/>
ideas you get will be more to the point, and the time people spend  <br/>
will be less wasted.<br/>

it to be with their friend? Is it to do specific things that the  <br/>

Finding out their motivation for wanting to go would be a first step.<br/>
<br/>
If they still want to go, do they know the requirements the program  <br/>
has for all of you? (It is the Co-op, not the PPP, right?) If so, then  <br/>
do it with them. Because it is a public-school program, you can leave  <br/>
any time. Maybe not without a big hassle (schools never want to lose  <br/>
funding), but you can do it.<br/>
<br/>
Focus on what they want to experience and go from there.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m curious to know what you mean by &quot;being watched by the system&quot;. If you&#39;re homeschooling legally, there is not much &quot;the system&quot; can do. And do you really think they &quot;watch&quot;? It&#39;s helpful, when there&#39;s a fear, to pull it out into the light and see if it survives scrutiny. That will bring you a much higher level of peace and security than feeling like you need to &quot;hide&quot; anything from anyone!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807073053">I&#39;m new to this list, so I&#39;m trying to lurk a bit, but I feel the need to jump in here. It&#39;s proper to call minority groups by what they prefer to call themselves. Autistic people generally prefer the term &quot;autistic&quot;. Mothers who want to feel more hopeful that their kids might &quot;get better&quot; have pushed for use of &quot;has autism&quot;. Autistic people themselves (whose opinions are rarely asked for) generally see autism as something that is part of them and cannot be cured or removed, and thus prefer &quot;autistic&quot;. It&#39;s a descriptive term, not a definitive one. It&#39;s just like you wouldn&#39;t say someone &quot;has gayness&quot; or &quot;participates in Christianity&quot; when you could just say they are gay or Christian. Those terms don&#39;t imply someone is &quot;defined&quot; by being gay or Christian or [trait], but it does imply that trait is an integrated part of who the person is. Saying &quot;has [trait]&quot; implies a hope that the trait can be removed from the person, which is unrealistic at best and offensive at worst.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Similarly deaf people usually prefer &quot;Deaf&quot; (with a capital D) to &quot;hearing-impaired&quot;. Different groups call themselves different things, but if you say &quot;has autism&quot; or &quot;is hearing-impaired&quot; to people who belong to those groups you might not get a friendly response.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
White people in this country have spent years arguing over what to call Indians, whether they should be &quot;Native Americans&quot; or &quot;American Indians&quot; or whatever. Eventually people got the bright idea to actually ask them what they call themselves. Turns out it&#39;s &quot;Indian&quot;, which they&#39;ve been called for as long as English has been part of their reality, or simply whatever specific tribe they belong to. Big surprise there? Not to me.<br/>

Disclosure is one issue, and how to disclose is another.  When sharing such personal (and sometimes loaded) information, your hope is always that the one with whom you are sharing will view your child as a unique individual with the autism being just a part of who he/she is.  Saying &quot;she&#39;s autistic&quot; can feel like you&#39;re giving the impression that it affects everything and all that she is--which is untrue and can make the autism seem more pervasive than it is.  Saying &quot;she has autism&quot; can, in a positive way, feel like you&#39;re saying it&#39;s just a part of who she is.

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Autism is classified as a Pervasive Developmental Disorder. It&#39;s pervasive by definition.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had many friends who&#39;ve been diagnosed with Asperger&#39;s (who generally refer to themselves as &quot;Aspies&quot;) and have read many autobiographies of people on the autism spectrum. Most of them have argued that autism *does* affect everything and all that they are. They see it as a part of their personality, a part of who they are. (I feel the need to emphasize that they&#39;re also PROUD of it!) I don&#39;t understand how the way a person&#39;s brain operates and the way they process sensory input could NOT affect everything about them. That doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t have an identity or a personality. It&#39;s just that autism is a part of that. It&#39;s woven into who they are like threads in a blanket.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I am, from all that I&#39;ve read, most likely an Aspie myself. I am also a woman, a brunette, a Unitarian, an unschooler, a 23-year-old, a Southerner, a musician, a Trekkie, and a Beatles fan. None of those things by itself IS who I am, but each of those things is part of who I am, and each thing affects the other things. Remove any one of those threads and you&#39;d have a different blanket. They all affect everything and all that I am. Everything counts!<br/>

themselves. Autistic people generally prefer the term &quot;autistic&quot;. -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Proper&quot; according to which rulebook?  I ask, because if autistic  <br/>
people &quot;generally prefer&quot; anything, who decided that and persuaded  <br/>
most but not all of them?  And if a minority of the minority group  <br/>
prefers a different designation, is it proper to respect that?  What  <br/>
if one person in a family prefers Black over African American?  What  <br/>
if some Indians (generally within a tribe) prefer &quot;Native American&quot;  <br/>
over &quot;Indian,&quot; while another group doesn&#39;t even use &quot;tribe&quot; because  <br/>
it&#39;s not the way they consider themselves?  Santa Clara Pueblo isn&#39;t  <br/>
part of &quot;the same tribe&quot; as San Ildefonso Pueblo. They&#39;re a pueblo,  <br/>
not a tribe.  Perhaps in dealing with federal bureaucracy they fill  <br/>
out &quot;tribal&quot; paperwork, it&#39;s not the term they use.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico, the designations for the major ethnic groups are  <br/>
Hispanic, Anglo and Indian.  If people outside of that area tell us  <br/>
condescendingly that those terms aren&#39;t right, those outsiders are  <br/>
wrong.  The Hispanic people of northern New Mexico are not &quot;Latino.&quot;   <br/>
Some aren&#39;t &quot;Spanish surnamed,&quot; though most are.  (Some of the Anglos  <br/>
and a lot of the Indians are, as well.) The Anglos are not &quot;white,&quot;  <br/>
though sometimes when filling out a &quot;check one box&quot; form that&#39;s my  <br/>
only choice.  And on forms created and maintained by the state of New  <br/>
Mexico, sometimes I check &quot;Anglo.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So please don&#39;t think that I haven&#39;t considered the realities of  <br/>
teminology and expectations.<br/>
<br/>
For purposes of people getting good information from this list, and  <br/>
advice that will help them move toward unschooling and confidently  <br/>
stay there, labels should be examined within each user, and looked at  <br/>
from every angle, but *mostly* from the point of view of whether it  <br/>
helps natural learning and mindful parenting.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t care what people call their kids, really.  I care how people  <br/>
seem to be thinking about their children in the context of discussions  <br/>
about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
It is proper for me to use terminology on this list that will help  <br/>
people understand unschooling.<br/>
