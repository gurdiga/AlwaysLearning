<div id="ygrps-yiv-260099319">The last two items ask the same thing and it had already been asked  <br/>
before anyway:<br/>
<br/>
-=-How does unschooling prepare children for a world that is not  <br/>
catered to their interests?<br/>
<br/>
-=-How does a child from this lifestyle learn to be independent when  <br/>
the parent has facilitated their needs, wants and learning from day  <br/>
one?-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the author of those questions has followed the links given in  <br/>
earlier posts, the answers are all there.<br/>
<br/>
I will ask counter questions:<br/>
<br/>
How does school prepare children for a world that does not cater to  <br/>
their interests?  (I rephrased the awkward ending.)<br/>
<br/>
How does a child from a traditional family learn to be independent  <br/>
when the parent has controlled and denied and limited him from day one?<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-268314161">-=-How does unschooling prepare children for a world ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
No matter what comes after that, unschooling isn&#39;t taking children  <br/>
aside and preparing them for eventual entry into the world.   <br/>
Unschooling is bringing children into the world and letting them be  <br/>
there always.  My babies were in the world.  My older kids were in  <br/>
the world, not in school-being-prepared-for-the-world.  My young  <br/>
adult children are still in the world, where they&#39;ve been for 22, 19,  <br/>
17 years.  They interact with people who still don&#39;t feel that  <br/>
they&#39;re &quot;in the world&quot; yet.  They think they have to finish college  <br/>
and THEN &quot;enter the world.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Tonight we were at a birthday dinner with an extended family we&#39;ve  <br/>
known as long as Holly remembers.  One woman has lately finished a  <br/>
master&#39;s degree in English.  She&#39;s teaching at a community college,  <br/>
teaching English and sociology.  She said she has many homeschoolers,  <br/>
some as young as 16, and they are far and away the best and most  <br/>
interesting and most interested students in her classes.  She said  <br/>
they ask interesting questions, they have interesting comments,  <br/>
they&#39;ll volunteer to do things and to answer questions, they care  <br/>
about how to use commas, and they pay attention.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-246598950">I wonder if she meant &quot;How will they be able to get a good job and<br/>
support themselves without a traditional education? Are you just<br/>
preparing your child for a life where the best job they can get is<br/>
working at McDonald&#39;s... but they probably wouldn&#39;t want to do that<br/>
anyway as they are so self absorbed and used to having every whim<br/>
catered to?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OK, maybe the last part of the question isn&#39;t helpful, but &quot;how will<br/>
they get a job?&quot; is probably something a lot of people wonder.  If I<br/>
wasn&#39;t projecting snarkiness, I could probably have phrased the last<br/>
bit as &quot;how will they function in an environment (office with a boss<br/>
telling you what to do) when they are not used to being told what to<br/>
do and having to do it even when they don&#39;t enjoy it or find it<br/>
interesting?&quot;<br/>
