<div id="ygrps-yiv-1782658585">Last night we were at Girl Scouts.  We meet at a school.  There has <br/>
never been any bells or anything because the school is closed, but last <br/>
night they had a &#39;science&quot; night, so there were hundreds of people there <br/>
going from classroom to classroom doing experiments.  At some point, <br/>
they rang the bell.  Ashi is our only schooled child there, and she just <br/>
hung out and didn&#39;t freak.  Taylor and William, who have been to school, <br/>
were asking if that was the bell (the bell at their school was <br/>
different, plus, they mostly school at home).  The four unschooled kids <br/>
were freaking out.  Lexie thought it was a fire alarm, and wanted us to <br/>
all leave.  She finally convinced me to get up and look outside to see <br/>
if others were evacuating.  They rang the bell twice, once as a warning <br/>
and once 10 or so minutes later.  I was very interested in the various <br/>
children&#39;s reaction to the bell. <br/>

Those bells may prove to be very important in the REAL WORLD. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391542994">Where we live, there&#39;s an elementary school at one end of the block (maybe 1/2 mile) and a middle school just around the corner.  Near enough that we can hear the mid-school loudspeaker from our front yard, and routinely we hear kids on the playground mid-day at the elem school.  My kids are fascinated by both sounds.  Andy has noticed that we don&#39;t hear the recess-kids more than once or twice a day, and finds it sad that&#39;s all the time they get to play.  Dan is always asking me &#39;what they say?&#39; when we hear the PA.  Of course, we can&#39;t make out actual words, tho the occasional word or phrase will come in clearly -- must be about wind patterns or something.  <br/>
 <br/>
We walk by the mid school every time we go to the park -- usually daily in warm weather -- and the only time we ever see kids outside is when they change classes or are running/playing soccer during PE on the field between the school and park.  On occasion, we&#39;ve heard the bell as we walk by.  Andy also thought it was a fire alarm at first.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979795980">Earlier this week, in the local paper&#39;s health column, the topic was &#39;When is a Child Too Sick to Go to School?&#39;  It was a long-winded statement from the local &#39;pediatrician expert&#39; about the many values of the importance of school and so on.<br/>
 <br/>
Interestingly, when he wrote about good reason to miss school, he opened with highly contagious diseases.  His comment was, &#39;schools, like army camps and prisons are breeding grounds for highly contagious illnesses.&#39;  I thought &#39;how funny, were those really the only comparisons he can make?&#39; and realized actually they are.  Well, he could compare school to hospitals, but that wouldn&#39;t make his case very well.  Even school advocates can see the similarities, I guess, but they just see it as inevitable and essential to a child&#39;s development.   School can certainly feel like both army camp and prison for lots of kids.<br/>
 <br/>
Then, it came to me -- the biggest difference between the above comparisons is that they&#39;re by choice.   Army service is voluntary.  In a way so is prison -- at least you got there by your own poor choices.  But school is the forced attendance by children whose only &#39;crime&#39; is being children.  And so many parents don&#39;t know they have any other choice.  <br/>

<br/>
Oh good one!!<br/>
<br/>
And the same way people will say school will prepare you for a job, for <br/>
college, for whatever...   Well it&#39;s preparing people for prison, too.  Only a few <br/>
will become doctors, but everyone has to take biology and chemistry (in some <br/>
schools).  Only a few will become prisoners but everyone has to practice lining <br/>
up and eating in 20 minutes in shifts and exercising wanly in the exerise <br/>
yard and then going back into their cells.<br/>
<br/>
School built up to a crescendo in the 1960&#39;s--it wasn&#39;t sucking so much.  The <br/>
early 20th century problems were being solved, child labor laws were in <br/>
place, there were lots of new schools with new facilities, the president was saying <br/>
&quot;More recess!  More sports equipment!  Everyone exercise!&quot; and there was lots <br/>
of educational research saying &quot;make it more fun!  Make it more <br/>
individualized!&quot;  But from the 70&#39;s on, things just seemed to go to hell.  The new research <br/>
couldn&#39;t be implemented well when kids were there under coercion.  The <br/>
special services people needed for individualization cost TONS, and by the time they <br/>
split people out to individualize, that itself caused problems they couldn&#39;t <br/>
solve, and now we&#39;re in the morrass of mess we&#39;re in now.  An organism too big <br/>
for its skin or something.  Can&#39;t support its own weight.   <br/>
<br/>
But it seems, as with other organisms there was a maturation and a flowering, <br/>
and that flowering is past.<br/>

Hi we are an englsih family Jay mum 51 Martin 34 Axel 7 & Criag 5 <br/>
living in a small French village.  Across the road from us is the <br/>
village school.  We are the only family they have know here to <br/>
unschool never before has anyone not sent their children to school.  <br/>
We are about to face our 1st test of Axel our 7 year old, over here <br/>
it is up to the individual inspector what they do and they are the <br/>
ones who make the dicision as to whether you are doing it right or <br/>
not.  So we have no guide lines.  It has made us sit down the 4 of us <br/>
and review our situation.  We cannot stay here it is too stressful as <br/>
some of the  friends  the boys had when we 1st moved here have been <br/>
kept away  when the families realised that they would not be going to <br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment we are deciding were our next move should be and <br/>
whether we can keep our 2 houses here and use them for the <br/>
unschooling movement</div>

I find it scary that these people can come out in the open and say <br/>
these things without really realising what they have said. Is it a <br/>
subconsious thing in them that they know what is wrong.<br/>

<br/>
When will people realise that children are more capable of knowing <br/>
what is right for them because they come without all the baggage we <br/>
grown -ups have because of our past.<br/>
