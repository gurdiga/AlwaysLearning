Monday night 10EST or 9 Central time so I&#39;m hoping to watch it then.<br/>
And yes I thought the posted article was scewed, how could she be<br/>
doing all the things listed and NOT be learning anything? Yet they<br/>
just took her statement that sounded kindof like a public schooled kid<br/>
would say when asked &quot;What did you learn in school today?&quot; and the<br/>
answer be &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; or &quot;Nothing&quot;. I&#39;m interested in seeing the clip.</div>

I have lots of things to say about universities - good and bad - but  <br/>
I&#39;m, quite honestly, suspicious of your motives. Are you an  <br/>
unschooler? Do you have children? Are you considering unschooling  <br/>
your own children?<br/>
<br/>
We would object to you hijacking this list for your own purposes  <br/>
unrelated to unschooling, Elliot. And we have no idea how you intend  <br/>
to utilize the opinions you solicit here.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest that if you are more upfront about your intentions that  <br/>
maybe you&#39;ll get some good discussion going about how unschoolers  <br/>
view universities.<br/>

On Unschooling Discussion, of which I am a part owner, I asked  <br/>

To come and tell us what unschooling SHOULD be as a movement is  <br/>
somewhat of a tacky beginning.  I&#39;ve been unschooling since my 19  <br/>
year old was five, and it has worked in wonderful ways I never  <br/>
foresaw.  I keep this list so that people can discuss unschooling.<br/>

&quot;Do tell&quot; has never been a polite response.  I&#39;m sorry unschooling  <br/>

<br/>
If you&#39;re looking for places where people think university is bad,  <br/>
you will probably not find it in any movements concerning learning,  <br/>
not even unschooling.  You&#39;ll find it where people have found it for  <br/>
a thousand years:  among disaffected lower classes who couldn&#39;t  <br/>
afford to go and so they declaim it as stupid and elitist.  Check a  <br/>
bowling alley or pool hall.  Check a piercing parlor mid-day and ask  <br/>
any school-age-looking folk there.   Don&#39;t be surprised if you don&#39;t  <br/>
find college educated people there, though.<br/>
<br/>
My personal opinion:<br/>
The best reason not to go to a university would be lack of desire to go.<br/>
The worst reason to go would be that someone else was pressing you to  <br/>
go upon pain of disownment.<br/>

<br/>
Are you looking for an excuse not to go to college? <br/>
Other options?  Are you looking for ways to support<br/>
kids who don&#39;t want college?<br/>
<br/>
I think there are lots of reasons not to go to<br/>
college.  I think if you have no interest in college,<br/>
you shouldn&#39;t go.  I think if you can learn the same<br/>
skills without going and you don&#39;t need the piece of<br/>
paper and you aren&#39;t craving that kind of social<br/>
environment, you shouldn&#39;t go.<br/>
<br/>
I think trade or tech schools or studying on your own<br/>
are options that are equally valuable.<br/>
<br/>
I was pretty young when I got my BA.  Afterward, I<br/>
started three different advanced degrees as an<br/>
unmatriculated student: technical writing,<br/>
architecture and English lit.  I didn&#39;t finish any of<br/>
them.  I didn&#39;t need the advanced degree in technical<br/>
writing because I got a job doing it anyway.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
finish English lit because I decided I didn&#39;t want to<br/>
teach (so I look up syllabi from time to time to read<br/>
without the report and writing and deadline pressure).<br/>
 I got pregnant during the architecture pre-course<br/>
work.  I decided I wanted to stay home.  I am so glad<br/>
I got that choice!<br/>
<br/>
I liked college, but it is not for everyone.  At this<br/>
point, I don&#39;t really want to go back.  I like<br/>
learning on my own.  The money for a college education<br/>
could certainly be used to educate oneself in a<br/>
completely different way.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of brilliant people never go to college.  I like<br/>
to think about Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and others<br/>
who are financially successful without college.  <br/>
<br/>
There are also a lot of people who are financially<br/>
successful who did go to college.<br/>
<br/>
As an unschooler, it is cool that college feels like<br/>
more of a choice and less like an obligation.<br/>

actual real experience.<br/>
<br/>
Elliot - the very purpose of this list is to share what you think is  <br/>
too private to share. We learn from each others&#39; experiences and  <br/>
ideas - not from theories spouted by people who may or may not have  <br/>
any children or whose children may be axe murderers, for all we know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is the modern version of women (and some men, these days)  <br/>
sharing words of advice and wisdom as they do their laundry together  <br/>
in the river. Everybody would know each other and know each others&#39;  <br/>
kids and, most definitely, those whose kids are admired would be the  <br/>
ones whose advice would be sought.<br/>

<br/>
-=-Is it unschooling to suggest such blanket accusations of the people<br/>

<br/>
&quot;Is it unschooling&quot; isn&#39;t any sort of question to ask.  Unschooling  <br/>
isn&#39;t a religion, and you seem to be asking it as though you were  <br/>
asking &quot;Is it Christian to...&quot; (and even that question is rarely a  <br/>
question, but a church-lady kind of insult).<br/>
<br/>
A man came here expecting unschoolers to badmouth universities.<br/>
The man expressed what seemed to be disgust with the idea that we  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t meet his expectation.<br/>
<br/>
He was in the wrong place.<br/>
My point was that if he wanted people who were anti-higher-education,  <br/>
to go to places that were socially known NOT to be hotbeds of PhD  <br/>
activity.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s not be dishonest about social realities.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Are we above<br/>
people without college degrees or those with piercings and tattoos?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Who&#39;s &quot;we&quot;?<br/>
Many of the people on this list have no college degrees.  Many have  <br/>
piercings and tattoos.  Many don&#39;t.  It&#39;s never an issue, because  <br/>
we&#39;re dealing in ideas about natural learning, and about parenting.<br/>
<br/>
Many of the people here have MAs and PhDs, but you don&#39;t see them on  <br/>
this list going on about it, because it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same for anyone.   Snobbishness about  <br/>
universities, or the decrying of universities, is not an unschooling  <br/>
issue.  The man had come to the wrong place.<br/>
<br/>
What matters on this list, what is valuable, is the ability to  <br/>
contribute ideas that help other people unschool.  The guy pressing  <br/>
us to badmouth universities without being willing to tell us whether  <br/>
he was an unschooling dad or not was dropped from the list.  We&#39;re  <br/>
not on his topic anymore.  He needs to go elsewhere.  A used  <br/>
bookstore in a college town or an artsy coffee shop with an extensive  <br/>
magazine section or an art gallery will NOT be the places he will  <br/>
find anti-university sentiment in abundance.    A clothing resale  <br/>
shop that only hires severely punk/goth clerks would be a more likely  <br/>
anti-higher-education source (in Albuquerque that would be Buffalo  <br/>
Exchange &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
For the purposes of this list, as was pointed out to him, what is  <br/>
important is respect for our children&#39;s choices, and giving them  <br/>
freedom to choose, whether that choice is for higher education or not.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m trying to make sense of this whole bit.  To me it just seems like<br/>
outright classist snobbery. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You must have made a guess about what class you think I am or am  <br/>
from, then, to make that statement.<br/>
Maybe we should drop it and go back to talking about unschooling.<br/>
