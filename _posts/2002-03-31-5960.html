<div id="ygrps-yiv-1805330624">Yes Karin we are here in Tucson and you are more than welcome to come visit.<br/>
I also belong to Sonoran Desert Homeschoolers that has a park meeting on<br/>
Tuesdays at Ft. Lowell Park so if you come maybe you could come that day and<br/>
meet the rest of us on this list from Tucson, who attend that meeting.<br/>

<br/>
~Mary &gt;&gt;<br/>

Maybe a trip down to Tucson would be in order!<br/>
<br/>
You are in Tucson, right Dawn?<br/>
