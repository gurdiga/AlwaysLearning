<div id="ygrps-yiv-933176005">We have never set bedtimes nor sent our boys to bed, we share a bed(10ft wide) and usually go to bed at the same time.  When they were very small I would sleep during the day with them on a bed in the Family playroom. How ever I have noticed that the boys now 6 & 8 will only go to bed if both of us go too.  Some times if Martin has been working he goes to bed early but neither of the boys want to go with him.  Sometimes I go to bed first and again neither wants to go with me.  I see them yawning and rubbing their eyes but they stay up.  Sometimes however they want to go to bed when we do not and I have to say I feel resentful at having to go to bed.  I do usually get up again when they are asleep but I do not want to have to go through the palaver of getting undressed and then dressed again.  I would like them to feel secure about going upstairs on their own or with just one of us so do not make any comments verbally but I am sure they must pick up on my non verbal messages. I actually need the least sleep and find if I do fall asleep while waiting for them to I wake up about 2 unable to sleep again till  about 6 and then am tired for the rest of the day.  Any suggestions.<br/>

 <br/>
Encourage them to fall asleep wherever you are going to be?  <br/>
 <br/>
If you will be in the living room, tuck them in on the couch or a pallet on  <br/>
the floor and make sure they know you&#39;ll carry them up when you go to bed.   <br/>
They don&#39;t have to sleep on the bed.  I used to just sit down with mine  <br/>
wherever they were most comfortable (not in the bed) and wait for them to go to  <br/>
sleep, then leave them there until I was ready to go to bed.<br/>

<br/>
When my four were around those ages, we too were still in the thick of<br/>
family bed time. I learned that I needed to stop expecting that anything was<br/>
going to happen the way I wanted it to. Seemed the moment I wanted something<br/>
to go a certain way with my children was the beginning of my time of<br/>
resentment, frustration, irritability, and lousy mothering. Most of my<br/>
frustrations were built around what I thought was supposed to happen (i.e.,<br/>
kids have a bedtime and should sleep in their own rooms) based on societal<br/>
norms, even ones I didn&#39;t buy into, and even though my experience with my<br/>
children told me differently.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you limit what YOU want out of bedtime, and see what<br/>
they need during bedtime. If they want to go to bed and want you with them,<br/>
but you have something you wanted to watch on TV or something you wanted to<br/>
do, then record what you wanted to see, or postpone what you want to do. I<br/>
know this may seem confining, and other people may have other suggestions,<br/>
but it is what I found to be necessary. Raising children was a big purging<br/>
session for me. I found myself often letting go of desires, ideas, etc. When<br/>
I felt frustrated I learned to ask the question, &quot;What do I WANT that is<br/>
causing me to be frustrated right now&quot; and I usually found that I wanted to<br/>
see a show on TV, or quietly read the next paragraph of a book, or go to<br/>
sleep with everyone else going to sleep at the same time, or go to the<br/>
bathroom alone. Once I figured out my want, it was easier to let go of it,<br/>
or reconfigure it so that I would get something of what I wanted in a<br/>
different way or at a different time. Having my children&#39;s needs come first<br/>
was the priority. And I think this is much of what parenting is supposed to<br/>
be about. And then comes the part where you put joy into these &quot;sacrifices&quot;.<br/>
I think you are right that the children know you are resentful, so the<br/>
sooner you let that go and enjoy this part of your day together, the better<br/>
your evenings will go.<br/>
<br/>
This does bring up the bigger picture of how we as parents (figurative &quot;we&quot;)<br/>
came to think that our desires come before our kids needs. It is not only<br/>
common occurrence in this country, we are drilled to be &quot;independent&quot; and to<br/>
make our kids that way too by ignoring their needs and showing how we go for<br/>
ours. (Not speaking about the poster btw, I think we&#39;ve all had some of the<br/>
experience you present, just talking about how we got here.)<br/>
<br/>
Last thought: For us, bedtime gradually evolved. They got a little older and<br/>
spread out a little more, and went to sleepovers at friends&#39; houses, and<br/>
liked to have their own space, and I&#39;m sure it happens differently for<br/>
different families, but for us our 16, 15 and 12 yo sleep mostly in their<br/>
own rooms now, though I do get pleasant surprises in the middle of the night<br/>
still (and I LOVE those times) and my 11 yo still sleeps with me and waits<br/>
for me to go to bed, or falls asleep wherever he is. He still has friends<br/>
sleep over and sleeps in his room with them and he happily sleeps over<br/>
friends&#39; houses. I&#39;m just grateful at this point for any time that we have<br/>
together, even snuggling at night.<br/>

 <br/>
This might not apply to the original author, but just as a piece of data  <br/>
into the larger stream, remember menopause.  When women get older they will  <br/>
sleep differently.  It seems one of the easiest and biggest strains on  <br/>
relationships is that menopausal women will blame others for making them  uncomfortable <br/>
and for keeping them from sleeping when it&#39;s just hormonal  changes.  <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve known several couples get divorced from inflexibility and lack of  <br/>
awareness and compassion.  It doesn&#39;t just goe one way, either.  Some  men get <br/>
angry when their wives have a hormone storm.  Sometimes wives just  want to be <br/>
self-righteous and blame others for their natural discomforts.  <br/>
 <br/>
Once again, being compassionate about kids&#39; changes can help affect how  <br/>
adults respond to their own and each others&#39; needs and changes.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking about some things along these same lines for several  <br/>
days.   I&#39;m noticing all the unexpected bonuses that came along with  our <br/>
unschooling lifestyle.  As I became more aware of my kids needs and  responded to that <br/>
it just naturally carried over to my husband.<br/>
 <br/>
Our relationship is so much stronger now and part of it is just because I&#39;m  <br/>
nicer now!  :-)<br/>
I think I used to so controlling of our lives that it affected us all in a  <br/>
negative way.  I&#39;m still working on it but just the awareness of what I was  <br/>
doing has led to changes.<br/>
 <br/>
There are very few times when our lives don&#39;t seem in harmony these  <br/>
days...it&#39;s the best bonus I could have every imagined.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1974653334">Not only are my boys in the same age range as the<br/>
original poster (ie:7 and 8yrs) but I also have an<br/>
autistic child who is strongly affected by ANY<br/>
activity taking place in the house while he&#39;s trying<br/>
to get to sleep and desperately needs solid routines<br/>
in order to not be so flustered and upset that he<br/>
can&#39;t sleep at all.<br/>
<br/>
We share a room with the kids, but not a bed, although<br/>
they often fall asleep in bed with my and my hubby<br/>
moves them to their beds when he gets home (he works<br/>
late at night.)  One thing that has worked for me to<br/>
get much needed quiet time to myself and still meet<br/>
their needs at bed time (when I am home alone with<br/>
them) is to have a soft light on and to read to<br/>
myself, do a crossword, write, etc. while in bed,<br/>
after the boys have had a story or whatever and are<br/>
all settled down.  They are used to this routine and<br/>
will generally fall asleep fairly quickly while I do<br/>
this.  Then if I want to get up again and do something<br/>
I am still awake.<br/>
<br/>
Another problem we have is that one of our boys is an<br/>
early bird and the other a nightowl, yet neither wants<br/>
to be up alone.  We&#39;ve worked out some early morning<br/>
quiet cuddle time in our bed while we doze with the<br/>
early bird and/or his own quiet play time in another<br/>
room if he is feeling up to that, and nightlights for<br/>
reading or very quiet play in bed by the night owl<br/>
while others fall asleep and/or quiet play time in<br/>
another room on the rare occassions that he is ok with<br/>
that.  Everybody has to give a little in order for<br/>
everyone&#39;s needs to be met, and us adults try hard to<br/>
accurately define what our needs are versus our wants<br/>
which can be compromised in order to meet the kids&#39;<br/>
real needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-480265027"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;but I also have an<br/>
 </span></blockquote>autistic child&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is autistic too and I just wanted to say how thankful I am to have<br/>
found unschooling for him (as well as my other kids). Mostly I needed the<br/>
support to let go of my fear for him and his future and the pull to<br/>
subscribe to everyone else&#39;s ideas of what we should do for him. There was<br/>
valuable information for us on the internet and from those who had similar<br/>
situations, but it still came down to what his needs were, which many times<br/>
were not at all what the &quot;professionals&quot; said they were. As far as sleeping<br/>
goes, he has evolved into a 16 yo who sometimes stays up all night working<br/>
on his passions, and sometimes crashes at 7pm and sleeps till morning. It<br/>
seems to have worked to let him be himself, even though that is very<br/>
different from his siblings. He has figured out through experience that if<br/>
he has to do something the next morning, he has to go to sleep by a certain<br/>
time. I don&#39;t think he&#39;d have gotten that if I implemented his schedule for<br/>
him. I did read every night at bedtime when they were younger, and he did<br/>
settle in better with that routine, and definitely had difficulty with<br/>
change, and so we had to work with those things. It hasn&#39;t been a clean-cut<br/>
experience. It can look and feel messy, or sometimes seem like it takes<br/>
forever for there to be a positive result from trusting the process of<br/>
freedom for him. But I have to say that he has grown in leaps and bounds by<br/>
being able to completely indulge in his passions. He&#39;s learned most things<br/>
in life (including about relationships, body language, innuendo, etc., the<br/>
areas that are his biggest challenges) from  having the freedom to do what<br/>
he wants.<br/>
<br/>
As a family, we still have to make compromises for the needs of each<br/>
individual (as the last poster said). My daughter entered school in the 7th<br/>
grade this year (her choice) and has to get up early. We have all agreed to<br/>
be quiet near her room by 9:30 at night. My autistic son&#39;s room is the<br/>
farthest from the other bedrooms which gives him the freedom to have his<br/>
sleep/work schedule. This process started when they were really little.<br/>
<br/>
Just some more thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-695410979">Hi Karen,<br/>
<br/>
Last night was a good example, Martin went off to bed and I stayed.  Neither of the boys wanted to go up so they put on a video.  I finished what I was doing and stared to watch the video with the boys.  Axel our eldest got down on to floor and start to fall asleep I asked Craig if he was tired and he said yes so we went to bed.  My concern is that they were both tired but did not say and would Craig would have stayed up just to not go to bed without me.  I also have to say that at the moment I am not physical able to carry up my youngest as he is now the heavier of the 2.  Martin is able to carry both the boys up so that is not a problem.  What I think is bothering me is that although Axel wanted to go to sleep he would not go up stairs even though Martin was up there.  Our house is very open plan and I would very happily take him up. <br/>
   <br/>
  Encourage them to fall asleep wherever you are going to be? <br/>

I am trying very hard to see the resentment part of it all and do realise that sometimes this is what it is, I then just go with the flow and go to bed and get up latter.  I really think the thing that bothers me is that when one of us is up stairs in bed that when either Axel or Craig want to sleep they don&#39;t go up there.  I love sharing the bed with them all and love the hugs and cuddles and the morning snuggles.  I am just concerned over the need they have to only be in bed with both of us there.  I am wondering if maybe they are frightened of something but unable to vocalize it.<br/>

I used to make a bed on the couch or on a folding futon on the floor when  a <br/>
kid wanted to fall asleep where I was when I was still awake and up, or if  <br/>
one wanted to stay up watching a movie after others were asleep, I&#39;d make a  <br/>
soft, warm bed where he could see the TV, make sure he had water, kleenex, the  <br/>
remote control, maybe a flashlight, and then if he ended up sleeping there all  <br/>
night that was fine, but if he came into bed with us later or to his own bed, <br/>
 that was fine too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1463931701">I would be very happy for either of the boys or both of them to stay up if they wanted but if we both want to go to bed then they will come up even if they do not want to.  Craig will not sleep on the edge of the mattress as he is frightened of monsters getting him.  Axel does not mind but gets fed up if he always has to do it.  It is not about liming them over when they go to bed it is more about some unknown something that stops them from staying up alone or going to bed with only one of us.  I do not want to control their lives in any way and know that there are still things I have to let go of.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose what I am saying is do I just let this continue until they feel more secure about night time and sleeping or is there something I can do to ensure that they feel safe.<br/>

I think there are often more times than not that the &quot;core&quot; reason for a<br/>
child&#39;s insecurities is never found, and that it often isn&#39;t all the<br/>
important to figure out. It seems much more important that children&#39;s needs<br/>
regarding their insecurities are met. I have fretted many many times over<br/>
trying to figure out why my children have feared something. Someone once<br/>
suggested to me that I may never know, but suggested that I make sure to<br/>
take them seriously and be there for them. Somehow this freed me up from<br/>
fearing their fears and made it easier to be pleasant and loving with them<br/>
without questioning whether it was right or not, or whether they were in<br/>
some kind of psychological peril. When they feel secure, it is much easier<br/>
for children to take the next step.<br/>

didn&#39;t start unschooling til she was 8, so she got the brunt of most <br/>

was, but they don&#39;t ever have to be scared at night.  One thing we <br/>
did was move our bedroom down stairs.  The kids have thier rooms <br/>
upstairs and my oldest sleeps in hers and all the fears pretty much <br/>
disappeared for her around 12 to 13 yrs old.  But my younger 2 sleep <br/>
downstairs with us.  We also got a tv in our room so we usually <br/>
watch videos or Nick at Night til they fall asleep.  Sometimes we <br/>
just read and talk.  <br/>
I think the brain developes more reasoning skills when kids hit <br/>
puberty and they can handle being alone more.  <br/>

It doesn&#39;t matter if they say they&#39;re tired or not.  You can tell when  <br/>
they&#39;re tired.  Help them recognize the symptoms.  Be aware that Child  A has been <br/>
awake for more hours than he usually is, etc., and bring it up.   That doesn&#39;t <br/>
mean you have to go to bed with him.  Give him &quot;permission&quot; to  sleep <br/>
anywhere.<br/>
 <br/>
Is it a problem if they sleep where they fell?  We&#39;ve often let our  kids <br/>
just sleep wherever it is they fell asleep, knowing that they know where  we&#39;ll <br/>
be if they wake in the night.  My youngest sleeps with the TV on, so  if he <br/>
falls asleep on the couch (he usually says, &quot;I think I&#39;ll just sleep down  here&quot; <br/>
right as he&#39;s dropping off) we make sure not to turn off the TV when we go  up <br/>
to bed.  <br/>
 <br/>
And I sleepwalk my kids when they&#39;re too big to carry....wake them us just  <br/>
enough to get them on their feet and stumble them to wherever (usually the car  <br/>
in our case).  My kids don&#39;t have any trouble getting back to sleep after  <br/>
that.<br/>

My  younger kids (5 and 8) don&#39;t like to go upstairs by themselves at  <br/>
night.  Sometimes in the day too, (esp. if they have just seen  <br/>
something scary on tv).<br/>
<br/>

I remember *being* like this.  We had a &quot;rec room&quot; in the basement  when I <br/>
was a kid.  Lots of room for lounging about, and so the whole family  spent <br/>
Saturday nights down there watching TV and drifting off to sleep after the  news <br/>
(no one wanted to wake up enough to get up and turn the TV off, so I would  <br/>
often wake up when the &quot;ant races&quot; came on).  <br/>
 <br/>
I remember one time, when I was about 9.  It was springtime, and we  had all <br/>
been out doing stuff all day, playing or working in the yard.  The  house was <br/>
cleaned up and I was freshly washed.  Dad asked me to go upstairs  and adjust <br/>
the thermostat, something I&#39;d never done before.  I was proud  that he asked <br/>
me to do something important and just for adults, but I was scared  to DEATH.  <br/>
I said I didn&#39;t want to.  He cajoled me into it, and it was  obvious my <br/>
brothers weren&#39;t going to budge.  I finally opened the basement  door, flipped on <br/>
the hall light, looked up the stairs for a second...I KNEW my  family was <br/>
watching to see if I would run.  I took a deep breath and  started up the stairs at <br/>
kid-pace, but not running.  Turned the corner at  the middle landing and RAN <br/>
the rest of the way to the thermostat just at the top  of the stairs.  <br/>
 <br/>
I stood there, breathing heavily, and remembered the instructions.  I  <br/>
adjusted it just like Dad told me to do.  Proud of myself for doing it  &quot;just <br/>
right&quot;, I took a deep breath in appreciation of the heat coming  on.  Then, I <br/>
realized I wasn&#39;t afraid anymore.  I stood there at the  top of the stairs, took a <br/>
look around the living room, flipped off the light and  walked calmly down the <br/>
stairs.<br/>
 <br/>
My pride had overcome my fear.  <br/>
