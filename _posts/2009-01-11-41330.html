<div id="ygrps-yiv-704490618">Megan(7) loves animals.  Right now, rabbits and dogs are her favorite domestic animals.  <br/>

<br/>
As a comprise, Megan wants me to explore chances for her to work with or be around animals.  Our local humane society has a very firm &quot;you must be twelve years old&quot; rule.  Megan isn&#39;t interested in a 4-H club or anything like that and she specifically wants to work with rabbits or dogs.<br/>
<br/>
I met an officer from the local K-9 unit a few months ago and I plan to call him and ask if he has any suggestions.  I plan to call the local rabbit rescue and ask if they accept volunteers.  I will also email places that train service dogs in our area (Portland, OR).  I can also make a list of breeds Megan likes and look into those rescues.  She isn&#39;t picky about the breed.  She just loves animals.<br/>
<br/>
We watch shows about dogs on tv (Dogs 101, Breed All About It, etc).  There is a dog show this week we can go to (we&#39;ve watched them on tv, but this will be our first &quot;in person&quot;).  I am very grateful for patient dog owners at pet stores who let Megan pet their dogs and ask questions.  We have dog books and talk about dogs all the time.  She has several vet games for the computer and the DS.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-519129283">gosh I know this feeling! I was the same way about horses :)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how much time you have available to you, but what about<br/>
some in house petsitting? Maybe you guys could find someone or a<br/>
couple of people who would love to have someone spend some time with<br/>
their dog while they&#39;re at work? I&#39;m thinking of someone who has their<br/>
own fenced place so doggie could do a pee pee and then have someone to<br/>
give them some love and attention. There are always people who have to<br/>
go to work but hate to leave their dogs all day and lots of times they<br/>
can&#39;t afford to pay someone to come by. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-400121411">So your mom would not allow an indoor dog that is smaller right?  It seems<br/>
you&#39;ve covered many of your options and that you&#39;ve probably already asked<br/>
the question I&#39;ve asked.  We have a dachshund who is very very docile and<br/>
mild.  If jumping on the furniture or on people or something like that is<br/>
the problem, you could research ways to suggest or explain to the dog such<br/>
ideas and help the dog avoid certain behaviors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959668213">I&#39;d check with other shelters and even foster organizations.  I  <br/>
realize you probably can&#39;t do an in-home foster, but maybe working a  <br/>
Saturday at a petsmart adoption day through a foster organization or  <br/>
just visiting to walk/love/socialize the dogs would be an option.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>hi,<br/>
<br/>
i think you could look for people with dog/s that could do with a <br/>
some help in caring for and exercising them. Particularly older <br/>
people or perhaps with disability. So, you could contact local vets <br/>
for instance, explain what you are offering and they might put you in <br/>
touch with someone for example who might be arthritic and would love <br/>
help brushing their dog, taking it for walks etcetera. Similarly - <br/>
find your version of what in Australia is &quot;guide dogs for the blind&quot; <br/>
or other therapy dogs living with disabled people... I could see a <br/>
wealth of opportunities for all of you, with this approach. It should <br/>
also avoid the &#39;insurance bogey&#39;. Just get to know a couple of dogs <br/>
and their owners and visit regularly. Maybe put an add on a notice <br/>
board at a retirement village that allows pets?<br/>
 <br/>
I know of a family who used to dog and house sit for a (very rich) <br/>
couple for periods of a month or more - living in luxury and caring <br/>
for a lovely dog.... <br/>
<br/>
 Down the road a ways, Megan might start her own business, offering <br/>
in home petcare and so on.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime keep watching dog stuff - I highly recomend a British <br/>
dog trainer - Victoria Stilwell - who had a show &quot;It&#39;s me or the <br/>
dog&quot; - she really knows her stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Bake healthy dog treats, or make toys for dogs at the pound. Search <br/>
thrift shops for tennis balls, blankets and towels that that dog <br/>
shelters would need. Go there regularly and I&#39;ll bet that long before <br/>
12yrs old, Megan, with you Gwen, are helping out.<br/>
<br/>
best of luck,<br/>

<br/>
If you need help finding a rescue organization, let me know... my  <br/>
sister does dog rescue in San Diego, and is in touch with other  <br/>
organizations and individuals around the country who do the same, so  <br/>
she might know of some people in your area.  My sister had a young  <br/>
person and her mom come over to walk dogs a while back and she loved  <br/>
having the help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-601941239">Maybe a smaller rescue society would be more friendly than the humane<br/>
society.  I know that in my town there is a woman who runs a rescue<br/>
society out of her house.  I imagine that she would love someone to<br/>
come over and play/work with the dogs although I expect she would want<br/>
you to be there so that she didn&#39;t feel like she had to watch your<br/>
daughter.  Maybe a smaller rescue society would work better.  Check<br/>
out www.petfinder.com.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she could set up a dog walking business.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she could set up a doggie day-care-ish business where she would<br/>
visit their house and play with their dog at their house or take the<br/>
dog on a walk while the owners are at work.  Dogs get lonely and she<br/>
would probably be happy to charge low enough rates that you would get<br/>
some happy takers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she could set up a business as a pet sitter where you two could<br/>
visit during the day to play with and feed the pets.  I know cats can<br/>
get away with a visit a day (scoop, feed, pet).  I don&#39;t know if you<br/>
would need to stay in the house all day with the dog... but it sounds<br/>
like she might not mind that :)<br/>
<br/>
In my area there are some parks with farm animals.  They have rabbits,<br/>
but no dogs.  If you have a park like that in your area, they might be<br/>
more flexible about volunteering.  The zoo might have rabbits too.<br/>
Again, I think you would need to volunteer with her for them to say<br/>
yes.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all I can think of for now, but hopefully there are some new<br/>
ideas in there.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; We have a cat and a rabbit (Flemish Giant).  But what Megan would really<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; like is a dog.  Megan wants a dog more than anything.  A dog isn&#39;t possible<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; right now with our living situation (we live with my mom, it is her<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; house/her rules and the yard isn&#39;t properly fenced.  The fencing will be<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; repaired in the spring...and I am hoping to revisit the issue then....but I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; don&#39;t expect her to change her mind).  Adding a rabbit or cat or gerbil or<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; mouse or rat or anything like that also isn&#39;t an option for the same<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; reasons.  I&#39;m a cat person by nature, but she wants a dog so badly that I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; turning into a dog person!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; As a comprise, Megan wants me to explore chances for her to work with or be<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; around animals.  Our local humane society has a very firm &quot;you must be<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; twelve years old&quot; rule.  Megan isn&#39;t interested in a 4-H club or anything<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; like that and she specifically wants to work with rabbits or dogs.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I met an officer from the local K-9 unit a few months ago and I plan to call<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; him and ask if he has any suggestions.  I plan to call the local rabbit<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; rescue and ask if they accept volunteers.  I will also email places that<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; train service dogs in our area (Portland, OR).  I can also make a list of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; breeds Megan likes and look into those rescues.  She isn&#39;t picky about the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; breed.  She just loves animals.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; We watch shows about dogs on tv (Dogs 101, Breed All About It, etc).  There<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; is a dog show this week we can go to (we&#39;ve watched them on tv, but this<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; will be our first &quot;in person&quot;).  I am very grateful for patient dog owners<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; at pet stores who let Megan pet their dogs and ask questions.  We have dog<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; books and talk about dogs all the time.  She has several vet games for the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; computer and the DS.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Is there anything I&#39;ve missed?   What else can I do?<br/>

<br/>
This was our experience too.  We checked EVERY humane society animal<br/>
shelter in the Portland area.  None of them let kids help directly with<br/>
the animals.  Kids can help by doing fundraisers or donating physical<br/>
items.  By the time Chamille was old enough to help, she had moved on to<br/>
other things.  It was kind of sad really.<br/>
<br/>
There is one organization specific to our area, called Oregon Friends of<br/>
Shelter Animals &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ofosa.org/volunteer.htm">http://www.ofosa.org/volunteer.htm</a>&gt;  .  Chamille made<br/>
their myspace page for them.  I know they have the same kind of age<br/>
policy, but they are always desperate for helpers, especially weekends<br/>
at petstores.  They may be willing to have a child tag along side mom<br/>
while mom helps with pet adoptions.<br/>
<br/>
They agreed to have Chamille volunteer to make their myspace page<br/>
without even knowing that she was underage.  When they found out her<br/>
age, they didn&#39;t seem to care and kept trying to get us to do more<br/>
volunteer stuff.  There may be other organizations like that one around.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille was much the way you describe your daughter.  She wanted a dog<br/>
more than anything else in all the world.  We ended up getting a dog. <br/>
My husband was the main objecter here.  I finally convinced him by<br/>
saying that if we wait too much longer to decide, the dog will be ours<br/>
and not hers, because it will end up living her much longer than she<br/>
will.<br/>
<br/>
What is your mom&#39;s main objection to having a dog?  I find our cats<br/>
probably do more damage than our dog ever has, and not all dogs are<br/>
barkers or diggers or howlers.<br/>

shelter allows 8-15 year olds to volunteer with an adult partner.<br/>
<br/>
Pet sitting or dog walking sound like really good options too. What  <br/>
about lunchtime dog walking for people who are at work all day?<br/>
<br/>
If she just wants to play with dogs, you might find a nearby off- <br/>
leash dog park, and just go visit one. My son struck up all kinds of  <br/>
friendships (human and canine both) at the one we used to go to.<br/>

&gt; hi,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; i think you could look for people with dog/s that could do with a<br/>
&gt; some help in caring for and exercising them. Particularly older<br/>
&gt; people or perhaps with disability. So, you could contact local vets<br/>
&gt; for instance, explain what you are offering and they might put you in<br/>
&gt; touch with someone for example who might be arthritic and would love<br/>
&gt; help brushing their dog, taking it for walks etcetera. Similarly -<br/>
&gt; find your version of what in Australia is &quot;guide dogs for the blind&quot;<br/>
&gt; or other therapy dogs living with disabled people... I could see a<br/>
&gt; wealth of opportunities for all of you, with this approach. It should<br/>
&gt; also avoid the &#39;insurance bogey&#39;. Just get to know a couple of dogs<br/>
&gt; and their owners and visit regularly. Maybe put an add on a notice<br/>
&gt; board at a retirement village that allows pets?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I know of a family who used to dog and house sit for a (very rich)<br/>
&gt; couple for periods of a month or more - living in luxury and caring<br/>
&gt; for a lovely dog....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Down the road a ways, Megan might start her own business, offering<br/>
&gt; in home petcare and so on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the meantime keep watching dog stuff - I highly recomend a British<br/>
&gt; dog trainer - Victoria Stilwell - who had a show &quot;It&#39;s me or the<br/>
&gt; dog&quot; - she really knows her stuff!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Bake healthy dog treats, or make toys for dogs at the pound. Search<br/>
&gt; thrift shops for tennis balls, blankets and towels that that dog<br/>
&gt; shelters would need. Go there regularly and I&#39;ll bet that long before<br/>
&gt; 12yrs old, Megan, with you Gwen, are helping out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; best of luck,<br/>
&gt; Claire<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1574930030">Are there any other rescue groups near enough for y&#39;all? If so, check them out. Our local animal shelter has a rule that you need to be 13 or older to volunteer without a parent, otherwise, a parent or other guardian type person needs to be there... <br/>
<br/>
Something to be aware of if you have pets, by going to shelters, there might be a higher risk of bringing &quot;things&quot; home to the other animals, even if you wash up, etc... we rescued a dog that was wandering around in our neighborhood, she was pregnant, skinny/hungry, scratched up, gave birth 10 days after we found her/took her in... when the puppies were around 7 weeks old, we had problems with parvo...everything is fine, now.. just something to be aware of.<br/>
<br/>
Animals find us: you see, we have a sign around our house that says &quot;free cat & dog food&quot; that only cats & dogs can see! :)<br/>
<br/>
Some of the other ideas, petsitting, etc., that others have suggested are great ones...maybe also see about helping out at a vet&#39;s office?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-322764914">The objections to a dog (remember, these are my mom&#39;s, not mine):<br/>
<br/>
dogs are messy<br/>
dog pee kills the grass in the yard<br/>
dog poop in the yard is gross<br/>
dogs shed<br/>
she doesn&#39;t like having &quot;stuff&quot; out so a water dish and/or food dish left on the floor bothers her<br/>
<br/>
My mom has never wanted a dog, but when I was nineteen (no longer living at home), she bought my brother a black lab for Christmas.  He was seventeen and had always wanted a dog, but hadn&#39;t asked for one in years.  The dog was very loving and sweet, but no one spent any time with her.  With no training or attention, she was a handful.  She also grew bigger than a male lab, so she this massive force of energy who got into everything.<br/>
<br/>
She has brought up the idea of getting a dog a few times and then she gets mired in all the reasons she doesn&#39;t want one.  At one point, she suggested the dog could live in the backyard and the kids could visit it there.  That would be so unfair to a dog!<br/>
<br/>
My mom doesn&#39;t see fun or toys or projects.  She just sees messes and things to clean up<br/>

So your mom would not allow an indoor dog that is smaller right?  It seems<br/>
you&#39;ve covered many of your options and that you&#39;ve probably already<br/>
asked<br/>
the question I&#39;ve asked.  We have a dachshund who is very very docile and<br/>
mild.  If jumping on the furniture or on people or something like that is<br/>
the problem, you could research ways to suggest<br/>
 or explain to the dog such<br/>
ideas and help the dog avoid certain behaviors.<br/>
