<div id="ygrps-yiv-1668277221">I make my living in the videogame biz and have for over 15 years. I&#39;ve been<br/>
trying to stay out of this conversation. My input is the games your son is<br/>
trying to master are too advanced for his current skillset and since he sees<br/>
his brother playing same said games his ego is getting too many hits. His<br/>
skills will get better from use over time, but only to the level of ability<br/>
he personally has and if his brother is just better at the hand/eye<br/>
coordination necessary, he might always be behind his brothers levels on the<br/>
same type of game, just like if they were playing football, one might be<br/>
varsity material, one might not be in football but might be in wrestling.<br/>
There are lots of different genres of games. If he can have an xbox and only<br/>
different games on the xbox that are only his to play (his own system and<br/>
the ps2 his brothers with his own games) maybe he could master different<br/>
types of games without his ego getting killed. Can&#39;t really know this is<br/>
what is happening since I don&#39;t know him, but it looks that way from the<br/>
outside looking in. -Arlynn<br/>

You can speak what you believe the truth is, but you don&#39;t get to say  <br/>
&quot;It&#39;s truth because I said it,&quot; as regards how children learn or how  <br/>
children feel.  Well... you CAN say it but people will nail ya for  <br/>
it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

responses to statements in the same paragraph.)<br/>
