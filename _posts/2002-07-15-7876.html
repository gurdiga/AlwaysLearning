I am in the same boat.  I&#39;m almost 36.  I&#39;ve had a book inside of me for <br/>
years, but have never been able to put it down on paper.  EVERY time I start <br/>
to hammer out the storyline in my mind, I can hear Mrs. Andersen from 6th <br/>
grade - &quot;One would never know by reading your writing that you are <br/>
tremendously gifted.  Oh, and you really can&#39;t even draw a stick man, can <br/>
you?&quot;    OUCH!  I had written (on my own, not for an assignment) a story <br/>
about a team of astronauts who find themselves pulled through a wormhole in <br/>
space and facing the danger of getting sucked into a black hole.  It was very <br/>
dramatic and exciting, well-researched, and I thought it was pretty darn <br/>
good.  Mrs. Andersen didn&#39;t.  You know, since then not only have I not <br/>
written much else, but I haven&#39;t even wanted to READ any science fiction <br/>
since that day.  Every time I think of picking up some good science fiction, <br/>
I&#39;m just flooded with embarrasment over my &quot;poor&quot; effort.  <br/>
<br/>
When my kids write, I let them know that whatever they wrote is perfectly <br/>
brilliant.  Even if there&#39;s something a little &quot;off&quot; with it, their ideas are <br/>
brilliant and their writing is, for the most part, wonderful.  Both boys are <br/>
planning to be authors, in addition to their &quot;daytime ordinary jobs&quot;.  : )<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and - Hey,Mrs. Andersen?  Maybe I can&#39;t draw a stick man, but I&#39;m a damn <br/>
sight kinder than you were...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1410456385">This is from another list -- I thought it good timing for our discussion <br/>
here. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pam<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Rules for Writing<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;1. Always avoid alliteration.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;2. Prepositions are not words to end sentences with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;3. Avoid cliches like the plague.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;4. Employ the vernacular.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;5. Eschew ampersands & abbreviations, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;6. Parenthetical remarks (however relevant) are unnecessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;7. It is wrong to ever split an infinitive.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;8. Contractions aren&#39;t necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;9. Foreign words and phrases are not apropos.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;10. One should never generalize.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;11. Eliminate quotations. As Ralph Waldo Emerson once said: &quot;I hate<br/>
&gt;quotations. Tell me what you know.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;12. Comparisons are as bad as cliches.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;13. Don&#39;t be redundant and don&#39;t use more words than necessary because<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s highly superfluous.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;14. Profanity sucks.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;15. Be more or less specific.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;16. Understatement is always best.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;17. Exaggeration is a billion times worse than understatement.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;18. One-word sentences? Eliminate.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;19. Analogies in writing are like feathers on a snake.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;20. The passive voice is to be avoided.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;21. Go around the barn at high noon to avoid colloquialisms.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;22. Even if a mixed metaphor sings, it should be derailed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;23. Who needs rhetorical questions?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;24. Sentences without verbs--bad idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;25. Avoid run-on sentences they are hard to read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;26. Don&#39;t use no double negatives.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;27. Verbs has to agree with their subjects.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;28. Avoid commas, that are not necessary.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;29. Place pronouns as close as possible, especially in long<br/>
&gt;sentences--such as those of ten or more words--to their antecedents.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;30. Use parallel structure when you write and in speaking.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;31. Take the bull in hand and don&#39;t mix metaphors.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;32. Never use a long word when a diminutive one will do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;33. Unless you are quoting other people&#39;s exclamations, kill all<br/>
&gt;exclamation points!!!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;34. Proofread carefully to see if you any words out.<br/>
<br/>

what we do from today onward is up to us. The only one stopping you now is<br/>
you holding onto Mrs Andersen as an excuse.<br/>
<br/>
Mrs Andersen is dead. If she shows up in your head again tell her to shut<br/>
up. :-)<br/>
<br/>
The way I write is to write bits and disjointed pieces in a loose leaf<br/>
notebook. Just snippets of conversation that pop into my head, ideas of<br/>
things that might happen, descriptions, pieces of scenes. Order doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter. Neatness doesn&#39;t matter. Occasionally I type them into the word<br/>
processor in some sort of order. Then I print them out and pick at them,<br/>
cross things out, reorder, add more ideas. (I use an outline but it isn&#39;t<br/>
necessary.) Eventually a story forms around it.<br/>
<br/>
There are obviously lots of other methods and the fact that I&#39;ve never<br/>
published anything shouldn&#39;t deter you ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-8904217">Now, I know I went to school, and I know I had an English teacher and I<br/>
remember vaguely a writing assignment or two, but that&#39;s it.  What I<br/>
wrote and why is lost.  Whatever they tried to teach me about writing,<br/>
grammar, sentence structure, is lost. <br/>
I can&#39;t tell you the mechanics of good writing, I only know when I read<br/>
it nothing else exists for that moment.  <br/>
I don&#39;t write well but I write a lot.   I write long letters to friends<br/>
who seem to understand the words and that&#39;s good enough.  I write<br/>
compulsively.  I wake up in the night and  write something for my son to<br/>
read when he&#39;s old and I&#39;m gone.  I write poetry because there is no  way<br/>
to not write it.  <br/>
It&#39;s not good either, but I can stack the really bad ones up and burn<br/>
them and I can keep the ones that don&#39;t make me blush for burning later. <br/>
<br/>
I wish I could blame an unsuspecting English teacher but the truth is I<br/>
don&#39;t even remember the names of the teachers I had.  I&#39;m certain they<br/>
did their job but I just wasn&#39;t there mentally. Accounted for but not<br/>
present. <br/>
My brother is some big genius.  Really.  He  reminds us all the time. <br/>
His whacky English teacher  freshman year told him he was a wonderful<br/>
writer, and If I knew who that crazy old bird was I&#39;d hunt her down and<br/>
thump her.  He&#39;s ever since written long and hideous essays on anything<br/>
and everything, religion lately.   I would pay good money for a Mrs.<br/>
Anderson.   <br/>
I&#39;m loving this discussion about writing.  My son is a writer, it&#39;s easy<br/>
to tell even at ten.  I can&#39;t imagine a teacher squashing it out of him. <br/>
I don&#39;t really think it would be possible and luckily we&#39;ll never have to<br/>
find out. <br/>

&gt; ourselves why we can&#39;t do something that we are deep down afraid we&#39;ll fail<br/>
&gt; at or don&#39;t really want to do but think we should or would like to achieve<br/>
&gt; without putting in the effort. Unless there&#39;s a whole lot of words left out<br/>
&gt; of your quote from before:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;ve had a book inside of me for<br/>
&gt;&gt; years, but have never been able to put it down on paper.  EVERY time I start<br/>
&gt;&gt; to hammer out the storyline in my mind, I can hear Mrs. Andersen from 6th<br/>
&gt;&gt; grade - &quot;One would never know by reading your writing that you are<br/>
&gt;&gt; tremendously gifted.  Oh, and you really can&#39;t even draw a stick man, can<br/>
&gt;&gt; you?&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; it sounds like the only thing standing between you and writing is Mrs.<br/>
&gt; Andersen. If Mrs. Andersen is dead, who else is it who&#39;s stopping you &quot;EVERY<br/>
&gt; time&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;&gt; but I haven&#39;t even wanted to READ any science fiction<br/>
&gt;&gt; since that day.  Every time I think of picking up some good science fiction,<br/>
&gt;&gt; I&#39;m just flooded with embarrasment over my &quot;poor&quot; effort.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And apparently &quot;she&quot; is stopping you from reading science fiction too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ultimately, of course, only you can answer the question &quot;Why would I need an<br/>
&gt; excuse?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm.  I don&#39;t recall saying that the experience with Mrs. Andersen was the <br/>
only thing keeping me from writing.  I said that everytime I think about <br/>
getting down to it, I remember what she said.  Of course since I am a normal <br/>
human being with an exceptionally stressful set of circumstances in my life, <br/>
there are many other things that go into it as well.  I didn&#39;t feel the need <br/>
to outline those since we were talking about teachers, and how they reacted <br/>
to our writing.  Not realizing that I would be called to task and told I was <br/>
making excuses, I didn&#39;t put my entire life and circumstances into my post so <br/>
that everyone would get the whole picture.  Nor do I intend to do so.<br/>
<br/>
And apparently &quot;she&quot; is stopping you from reading science fiction too.<br/>
<br/>
No.  The sick feeling that I got that day is brought to the surface when I <br/>
think about science fiction writing, since my story was science fiction.  I <br/>
don&#39;t feel a compelling desire to read science fiction, and am incapable of <br/>
doing so.  I said that every time I think about it, I&#39;m flooded with <br/>
embarrassment.  Does that affect my decision whether or not to read the <br/>
genre?  Well, sure, to a degree.  But so do many other things.  Mrs. <br/>
Andersen&#39;s unkind words and my reaction to them are not the sum total of my <br/>
life experience.  Again, I joined the discussion with a description of my <br/>
experience with my 6th grade teacher because it was on topic.  That <br/>
experience (along with many others) has had some part in making up my psyche, <br/>
which in turn has some part in determining how I approach things.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, of course, only you can answer the question &quot;Why would I need an<br/>
excuse?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Right.  The answer:  I don&#39;t.  I haven&#39;t actually ever tried to make one.  <br/>
You decided that that&#39;s what I was doing.  Interesting idea, but it doesn&#39;t <br/>
apply here.  I have enough important things happening in my life that it <br/>
isn&#39;t more than a small drop in the bucket.  <br/>
<br/>
I do find myself curious about why, considering the several anecdotes that <br/>
were posted in this thread, you decided that I, and only I, was making <br/>
excuses for not writing.  I found it startling and, well, high-handed.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1545099548">Deb:  I just been reading a book about Woody Guthrie with my kids.  He<br/>
was a writer of simple words people could relate to.  He wrote a song<br/>
daily sometimes two or more.  You sound like a writer.  Woody Guthrie<br/>
was a writer because writing is an action.  If you do it, you are.  You<br/>
write very well.  People can understand you and that is one of the main<br/>
points isn&#39;t it?   One aspect of school writing was a 4th grade teacher<br/>
who was consider very good, told the kids to write and do it creatively<br/>
but make sure words are spelled right.  Editing always comes later.<br/>
When you edit when you write creatively, you are breaking the flow,<br/>
censoring the mind, breaking the spirit.  Write from the heart and<br/>
anything you want to.  Hold back nothing.  Than in a week or two,<br/>
sometimes more, go back and read it with an objective eye.  The third or<br/>
fourth time around make sure the words are spelled in similarity with<br/>
the dictionary.  I have taken creative writing courses and there are all<br/>
sorts of ways to connect words together in a flow that feels comfortable<br/>
to you.  Don&#39;t despair, say adios to the inner critic and invite her<br/>
back later.  Lisa<br/>

 <br/>
Now, I know I went to school, and I know I had an English teacher and I<br/>
remember vaguely a writing assignment or two, but that&#39;s it.  What I<br/>
wrote and why is lost.  Whatever they tried to teach me about writing,<br/>
grammar, sentence structure, is lost. <br/>
I can&#39;t tell you the mechanics of good writing, I only know when I read<br/>
it nothing else exists for that moment.  <br/>
I don&#39;t write well but I write a lot.   I write long letters to friends<br/>
who seem to understand the words and that&#39;s good enough.  I write<br/>
compulsively.  I wake up in the night and  write something for my son to<br/>
read when he&#39;s old and I&#39;m gone.  I write poetry because there is no<br/>
way<br/>
to not write it.  <br/>
It&#39;s not good either, but I can stack the really bad ones up and burn<br/>
them and I can keep the ones that don&#39;t make me blush for burning later.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could blame an unsuspecting English teacher but the truth is I<br/>
don&#39;t even remember the names of the teachers I had.  I&#39;m certain they<br/>
did their job but I just wasn&#39;t there mentally. Accounted for but not<br/>
present. <br/>
My brother is some big genius.  Really.  He  reminds us all the time. <br/>
His whacky English teacher  freshman year told him he was a wonderful<br/>
writer, and If I knew who that crazy old bird was I&#39;d hunt her down and<br/>
thump her.  He&#39;s ever since written long and hideous essays on anything<br/>
and everything, religion lately.   I would pay good money for a Mrs.<br/>
Anderson.   <br/>
I&#39;m loving this discussion about writing.  My son is a writer, it&#39;s easy<br/>
to tell even at ten.  I can&#39;t imagine a teacher squashing it out of him.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t really think it would be possible and luckily we&#39;ll never have<br/>
to<br/>
find out. <br/>

You are just so nice.  Must be a Montana thing, eh? &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>??????????What is happening in Great Falls?<br/>
<br/>
I lived in Great Falls when I was 5.  Walked through a<br/>
tunnel of snow to get to Longfellow Elementry School.<br/>
Alone.  There was one little Black boy in my<br/>
Kindergarten class. No Indians (at least local ones)<br/>
allowed. But as there was only one Black family in the<br/>
whole city it was not worth building a whole school in<br/>
order to enforce discrimintation.  I walked home with<br/>
him one day. Mother was in a panic when I didn&#39;t come<br/>
home....but his mother called the school to say where<br/>
I was and I got found. I also walked lots of other<br/>
places alone. <br/>
But this was in 1953-4. The olden days.<br/>
<br/>
One little girl stuck a pencil in my eye. It went<br/>
between the eyeball and the socket. Miss Grapes called<br/>
my mother....when she got there I had a pencil<br/>
sticking out of my eye. I only have a small blue-grey<br/>
scar from it. Apparently the child was mad becuase my<br/>
hand-print plaster-cast-thingy was smaller than hers.<br/>
???? Dunno.<br/>
<br/>
It snowed July 4. We ate watermelon and I wore my<br/>
halter-top upside down.  I also learned to<br/>
dissassociate in Great Falls. I actually thought that<br/>
I was flying, though. Maybe I did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-399068073">Deb, I know.  Great Falls is very dysfunctional most often.  There are<br/>
kids everywhere far from any kind of parent running around everywhere.<br/>
Just got to light a candle for the boy and family and pray he gets home<br/>
soon.   The book we are reading is a biography called &quot;This Land Was<br/>
Made for You and Me&quot; by Elizabeth Partridge.  The author grew up in a<br/>
rather &quot;Bohemian&quot; family.  They traveled together in a used limousine<br/>
that they painted metallic gold and made into a camper.  In the<br/>
afterward she wrote,  &quot;.For graduation, Miss Brown decided we&#39;d sing<br/>
&quot;this Land is Your Land.&quot;  We practiced quietly for several weeks in our<br/>
classroom.  A day before the ceremony, we walked two by two down to the<br/>
auditorium for a dress rehearsal.  Miss Brown wanted us to be perfect.<br/>
I knew we&#39;d be perfect.  I loved the song and felt good inside as I<br/>
sang.  &#39;Let your voices fill the auditorium,&#39; Miss Brown said, signaling<br/>
us to begin.  But her bright smile quickly gave way to a frown as she<br/>
listened.  &#39;Keep singing,&#39; she said, and walked in front of us, arms<br/>
crossed,.When she got to me, she shook her head.  &#39;No, no,no,&#39; she said.<br/>
&#39;You&#39;re off key.  Stop singing.  Just mouth the words.&#39;  A burning heat<br/>
flooded my face.  Stop singing?  My warm, confident feelings crumbled to<br/>
shame.  I felt angry and hot inside.  But I didn&#39;t say anything.  Not to<br/>
her, not to anyone.&quot; (page 201 &quot; This Land Was Made for You and Me&quot;)<br/>
She wrote this biography to heal from that very experience.  Woody<br/>
Guthrie was a great writer of books but they are not objective, and this<br/>
book is great.  Peace, Lisa<br/>
