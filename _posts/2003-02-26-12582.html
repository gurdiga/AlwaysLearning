&lt;&lt; I like this list, but I&#39;d have to say that I like the WAY <br/>
 unschooling.com is set up.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think there is some confusion about unschooling.com......we&#39;re talking <br/>
about the email list which is connected to the message board but operates <br/>
just like this list. :)<br/>
It has some die hard unschoolers also on this list and nothing that is <br/>
anti-unschooling would get ignored, believe me!!<br/>
That&#39;s where some of the difficulties lie, many people don&#39;t want to hear <br/>
that they are not unschooling.<br/>

growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
