<div id="ygrps-yiv-1059136751">Sitting here flipping through the TV I caught the Emmy<br/>
Awards on.  It just so happened that LeVar Burton won<br/>
and emmy for the best children&#39;s series Reading<br/>
Rainbow.  <br/>
<br/>
He said that this may be the last year of the show due<br/>
to lack of funds.  <br/>
<br/>
I feel this is something that can&#39;t happen.  I have a<br/>
hard time with this happening when there is so much<br/>
stuff on there that is not good.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for letting me sound off.<br/>
<br/>
Leslie<br/>
