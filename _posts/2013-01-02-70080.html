I&#39;m still exhausted from the just-finished Albuquerque Symposium. In four months.... Minneapolis! May 2-5, 2013.<br/>
<br/>
Coming after that... less elaborate events without hotels, but with Joyce Fetteroll and sometimes others:<br/>
Lisbon, Portugal June 1-2      <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradoddemlisboa.blogspot.com">http://sandradoddemlisboa.blogspot.com</a><br/>
Selkirk, Scotland (maybe another town nearby, and either the third or fourth weekend of that five-Saturday month)<br/>
Leiden, The Netherlands, June 29  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://altijdlerenlive.wordpress.com">http://altijdlerenlive.wordpress.com</a><br/>
<br/>
 Joyce and I will be at Julie Daniel&#39;s  &quot;Learning Trust â€” Trusting Learning&quot; LiTTLe Conference July 13-14 in Ashford, Surrey, west of London.  RIGHT near a railway station, in a school.    The site is being updated, but the physical location will be the same as last year&#39;s.   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.lttl.org.uk/index.html">http://www.lttl.org.uk/index.html</a><br/>

The ALL Unschooling Symposium in Leiden does not have a hotel, but I&#39;ve listed some child friendly accommodation possibilities on this page for places in and around Leiden: www.altijdlerenlive.wordpress.com/holiday<br/>
<br/>
It might be nice to combine the symposium with a family vacation to the Leiden area. There will be two early afternoon home learning meetings happening the Friday before the symposium and the Tuesday after the symposium where Sandra (and probably Joyce) will be present to answer questions.<br/>
<br/>
If you have unschooling friends that you&#39;ve wanted to go on holidays with, this might be a great time to have that vacation.<br/>
