<div id="ygrps-yiv-592211187">I think you can set an atmosphere in the house -- I mean - you can fake it <br/>
even if you have some math issues yourself &lt;G&gt;. Hang up the Math Calendar for <br/>
Kids - act like you can hardly wait everyday to fool with that day&#39;s puzzle <br/>
(it has interesting problems and the answer is always the date - so getting <br/>
the answer is never the point which might remove a little anxiety right <br/>
there! &lt;G&gt;).  Just saying things like, &quot;Hey, that is cool,&quot; makes a <br/>
difference, I think.  And the other thing is to get a feeling for what math <br/>
really is -- that computational skills are to math what phonics are to <br/>
reading -- not much fun and not satisfying in and of themselves -- sort of <br/>
necessary eventually and most often just picked up along the way but you <br/>
don&#39;t need to wait until you know it ALL before you can start enjoying real <br/>
math any more than you wait until a kid knows all the phonics rules before <br/>
they can start enjoying books.<br/>
