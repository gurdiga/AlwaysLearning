<div id="ygrps-yiv-2146194597">Chloe (5) and I just got done playing Doctor...usually she is the <br/>
doctor. Today I got the job. She had ailments that I *fixed* and <br/>
then it just turned into a really relaxing and quiet massage for <br/>
her. Then we sat on the couch together and ate while looking up at <br/>
all her balloons (left over from her birthday). It was peaceful and <br/>
nice, neither of us said much. Then she just asked me to turn on <br/>
Seasame street for her. She watched her favorite parts and is now <br/>
back in the office quietly spinning on the chair. We were suppose to <br/>
take this field trip down to Sea World today with our homeschooling <br/>
group, but Raiden (15mos) got sick last night and is not up to par <br/>
so we missed the field trip. I&#39;m so glad. I love days like this. She <br/>
just asked me to go play Monopoly, I hope Raiden will continue to <br/>
sleep, I love to spend time with her like this :)<br/>
