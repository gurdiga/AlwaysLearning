My mom had kids born in 1953, 1955, and 1959 and breastfed all of us. <br/>
Southern California. Was this really unusual? I never knew that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2027330849">When I was breastfeeding Simon my dad made mention of Gussie from A Tree Grows in Brooklyn. The conversation wasn&#39;t strictly polite. It&#39;s a mean reference. It&#39;s from 1943. I went looking for the quote on-line. I don&#39;t have the book anymore. <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the whole section: <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Gussie, a boy of six, was a murky legend in the neighborhood. A tough<br/>
little hellion, with an overdeveloped under lip, he had been born like<br/>
other babies and nursed at his mother’s great breasts. But there all<br/>
resemblance to any child, living or dead, ceased. His mother tried to<br/>
wean him when he was nine months old but Gussie wouldn’t stand for it.<br/>
Denied the breast, he refused a bottle, food or water. He lay in his<br/>
crib and whimpered. His mother, fearful that he would starve, resumed<br/>
nursing him. He sucked contentedly, refusing all other food, and lived<br/>
off his mother’s milk until he was nearly two years old. The milk<br/>
stopped then because his mother was with child again. Gussie sulked and<br/>
bided his time for nine long months. He refused cow’s milk in any form<br/>
or container and took to drinking black coffee.<br/>
<br/>
Little Tilly was<br/>
born and the mother flowed with milk again. Gussie went into hysterics<br/>
the first time he saw the baby nursing. He lay on the floor, screaming<br/>
and banging his head. He wouldn’t eat for four days and he refused to<br/>
go to the toilet. He got haggard and his mother got frightened. She<br/>
thought it wouldn’t do any harm to give him the breast just once. That<br/>
was her big mistake. He was like a dope fiend getting the stuff after a<br/>
long period of deprivation. He wouldn’t let go.He took all of his mother’s milk from that time on and Little Tilly, a sickly baby, had to go on the bottle.<br/>
<br/>
Gussie<br/>
was three years old at this time and big for his age. Like other boys,<br/>
he wore knee pants and heavy shoes with brass toe tips. As soon as he<br/>
saw his mother unbutton her dress, he ran to her. He stood up while<br/>
nursing, an elbow on his mother’s knee, his feet crossed jauntily and<br/>
his eyes roving around the room. Standing to nurse was not such a<br/>
remarkable feat as his mother’s breasts were mountainous and<br/>
practically rested in her lap when released. Gussie was indeed a<br/>
fearful sight nursing that way and he looked not unlike a man with his<br/>
foot on a bar rail, smoking a fat pale cigar.<br/>
<br/>
The neighbors found<br/>
out about Gussie and discussed his pathological state in hushed<br/>
whispers. Gussie’s father got so that he wouldn’t sleep with his wife;<br/>
he said that she bred monsters. The poor woman figured and figured on a<br/>
way to wean Gussie. He was too big to nurse, she decided. He was going<br/>
for four. She was afraid his second teeth wouldn’t come in straight.<br/>
<br/>
One<br/>
day she took a can of stove blackening and the brush and closed herself<br/>
in the bedroom where she copiously blackened her left breast with the<br/>
stove polish. With a lipstick she drew a wide ugly mouth with<br/>
frightening teeth in the vicinity of the nipple. She buttoned her dress<br/>
and went into the kitchen and sat in her nursing rocker near the<br/>
window. When Gussie saw her, he threw the dice, with which he had been<br/>
playing, under the washtubs and trotted over for feeding. He crossed<br/>
his feet, planted his elbow on her knee and waited.<br/>
“Gussie want tiddy?” asked his mother wheedingly.<br/>
<br/>
“Yup!”<br/>
<br/>
“All right. Gussie’s gonna get nice tiddy.”<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly<br/>
she ripped open her dress and thrust the horribly made-up breast into<br/>
his face. Gussie was paralyzed with right for a moment, then he ran<br/>
away screaming and hid under the bed where he stayed for twenty-four<br/>
hours. He came out at last, trembling. He went back to drinking black<br/>
coffee and shuddered every time his eyes went to his mother’s bosom.<br/>
Gussie was weaned.<br/>
<br/>
The mother reported her success all over the<br/>
neighborhood. It started a new fashion in weaning called, “Giving the<br/>
baby the Gussie.”<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I wish my mom was alive so I could ask her why she breastfed in the <br/>
50&#39;s. We were upper middle class - both of my parents had college <br/>
degrees and we lived in the southern california suburbs. My mom had <br/>
multiple majors in college that included psychology and journalism plus <br/>
a teaching credential. My dad majored in English.They weren&#39;t at all <br/>
counter-culture - they were very comformist. My dad was a republican and <br/>
my mom a democrat, though &lt;G&gt;. My dad was president of the chamber of <br/>
commerce and in the elks club and rotary club and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
I never thought about her breastfeeding, but remember it well - I even <br/>
remember doing it MYSELF - I have sisters 3 and 7 years younger than I <br/>
am, so I suspect it was her letting me nurse later, after they were born.<br/>

very middle class.  She nursed all of her babies.  She told me a story<br/>
about how she blacked out her bathroom windows, so that she could get up<br/>
with her babies in the middle of the night and change their diapers and<br/>
nurse them in half light during the mandatory black outs in the 40&#39;s.  I<br/>
can&#39;t even imagine how someone would use a bottle in complete darkness! <br/>
But it was the 40&#39;s and I think things changed in the 50&#39;s in regards to<br/>
breast feeding.</div>

Also he only had to go 2 days a week as Ed kept him the other 3 days due to his schedule accommodating that.  Oh and I did not go back to work until Zac was 8 months old.  He never would take breast milk in a bottle - but man did he nurse the exact minute I walked into her house.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1681124110">I have this book by Sarah Hrdy called Mother Nature. There is a big section on wet-nursing in France in the 1700&#39;s. The statistic she gives is this: of the 21,000 births in Paris in 1780, only 5 percent of them were nursed by their own mothers. Infant mortality rates were really high with under this system. There were actually public service sorts of messages encouraging women to breast feed their own children. <br/>
<br/>
Hrdy examines the reasons behind sending your child off--only the wealthiest could afford in-home wet nurses, so most the infants of the middle class would be sent to the country to a wet-nurse--and in part concludes that it was because the income or the unpaid labor of the mother was pivotal to her families well-being. Much the same reason why many mothers chose to send their children away now. It was also a way to have more babies. For the wealthy who could afford to have a live in wet-nurse children survived 80 percent of the time, the same as if they were breastfed by their mother. There was also a greater likelihood for a daughter to be sent to be wet-nursed and a son to be kept at home. Certainly first born son&#39;s were most likelihood to be kept at home. <br/>
<br/>
It is another demonstration of the wonderful luxury and boon that I have in my life. I not only got to breastfeed my children until they were done but I also still get to stay home with them earning nothing and contributing nothing to my families economy. <br/>

For a few decades, when there&#39;s a cost analysis of raising a child,  <br/>
education is the biggest thing on the list.  If that current view of  <br/>
what it costs to raise a child is good, should unschooling be  <br/>
considered to be contribution to those &quot;costs&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Probably not, in terms of &quot;the economy.&quot;    Pam?  What&#39;s the &quot;worth&quot;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1137036643">Unschooling was a natural fit for us - we did not know it was called that, we called it homeschooling but we dreamed and dreamed and talked about what homeschool would look like for us.  We never ever did school at home when we brought him home mid 3rd grade.  We just simply brought him home and started living - doing more of what we were already doing when not in school -  Playing in the creek, catching crawdads, finding rocks, digging fox holes in the yard, playing with Lego&#39;s, water fights, watching TV/movies, playing games, going places, doing things.   Later we found out that what we were doing was called  &quot;unschooling&quot; and &quot;radical unschooling&quot; through the local group we joined - thankfully it was mainly unschoolers & radical unschoolers - started by Radical unschoolers - I say thankfully as it gave us others to connect with, that were unschoolers and radical unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
It came to a point we just could not take it anymore (school) - Zac could not take it anymore and we knew it was NOW or lose him.  That was 6 years ago this January and it has been great ! He is 14 and our relationship is fantastic!  <br/>

So true. I never thought of homeschooling until I had my son. Once he was born and in my eyes nursing<br/>
I could never send him away ,<br/>
My grandmother breastfeed all her kids in the 40&#39;s .She had 4 and my mom was the oldest born in 1940.<br/>
That was in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. She was privileged and married to a Doctor.<br/>
I remember when young my family saying how my aunt was selfish for not breastfeeding her kids. Breastfeeding was the norm and still<br/>
is in Brazil.<br/>
The breastfeeding campaign there is big.<br/>

transportation services, housekeeping services, education services, <br/>
cooking services) does not count in GDP.<br/>
<br/>
But, that&#39;s truly an accounting problem, not a reality. If economists <br/>
could agree on a way to put a dollar value on our &quot;home-production,&quot; the <br/>
problem would be solved. It is the same problem as making comparisons <br/>
between countries - in advanced countries many more activities are <br/>
handled through market transactions, while in poorer countries, these <br/>
same activities are done by people for themselves - things like taking <br/>
care of their children, growing food, laundry, housekeeping, cooking.<br/>
<br/>
Also, some would argue that we could &quot;do more.&quot; They mean we could <br/>
produce in fields that contribute more to the world. I could be a <br/>
research economist and help figure out how to prevent recessions, for <br/>
example. They say my intelligence is being wasted. (I don&#39;t agree - what <br/>
on earth could be more important than figure out how to successfully <br/>
parent the next generation?)<br/>
<br/>
We are &quot;producing&quot; - we&#39;re producing just as surely as if we were <br/>
hiring/paying for the same services. And our &quot;output&quot; is higher <br/>
quality,&quot; to boot! Our &quot;production&quot; ought to count double! And that&#39;s <br/>
not even counting the contribution we may be (hopefully are) making to <br/>
improving understanding relationships between parents and children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1346252062">-=-I remember when young my family saying how my aunt was selfish for  <br/>
not breastfeeding her kids. -=-<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was four months old, Keith and I took him to my dad&#39;s mom&#39;s  <br/>
family reunion, in Roby, Texas.   My grandmother was the second of   <br/>
eight siblings, and they lived in New Mexico and Texas when they were  <br/>
growing up.  They were all still alive then, in 1986.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a conservative, non-drinking Baptist crowd.  They&#39;ll play dominos  <br/>
but not cards at the reunion.<br/>
<br/>
I had worn a nursing shirt, so I wouldn&#39;t have to undress at all to  <br/>
nurse him.  When he wanted to nurse, I went back to the far end of the  <br/>
building (a county community center kind of place), and looked at the  <br/>
bulletin board, reading all the details of announcements about a town  <br/>
I didn&#39;t live in, while Kirby nursed.<br/>
<br/>
My Mamaw came up and looked at the bulletin board, too.  After a bit  <br/>
she said, &quot;I don&#39;t know why those other women don&#39;t *feed their  <br/>
babies.*&quot;  (I&#39;d put that in italics, if I could, to show how she  <br/>
emphasized those last three words, slowly but meaningfully, without  <br/>
looking directly at me or Kirby.  And think it with a west Texas  <br/>
accent, if you can.)  There were two other moms of young babies there,  <br/>
even younger than Kirby, bottlefed.<br/>
<br/>
That same day she said another thing I should note.  My Mamaw birthed  <br/>
five boys.  The first two, a set of twins, were stillborn.   I&#39;ve seen  <br/>
their graves.  She named them Horace and Morris.  Later there was  <br/>
another set of twins in her extended family, and they used those names.<br/>
<br/>
Her three living sons were Kirby (my dad), Rex (who died last month)  <br/>
and John Quincy, who died a few years ago.  I&#39;m the oldest in that  <br/>
line now.<br/>
<br/>
But what she said, when she got to meet my first child, was &quot;I think  <br/>
every mother should have a daughter.&quot;<br/>
She was still alive when Marty was born, so she knew I had two boys.   <br/>
She died before Holly was born, so I very often think of her when I  <br/>
appreciate having a daughter.  I think of how much she would have  <br/>
liked to have had a daughter.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s something special there, in my nursing a baby, named after my  <br/>
dad, in front of his mother, who wanted a daughter.<br/>

THis older couple sat next to us in the Golden Circle ( best seats one can get) and I don&#39;t know if they where horrified or not that I nursed her there. I notice one of the riders took a longer look at us when she rode by during the show. It was funny.<br/>
I was being discreet and did where a beautiful nursing top I got years ago. BUt nursing a 3 year old that is as tall as a 4 year old or more is not as discreet as nursing a younger child.<br/>

we&#39;d all 4 traveled to California. I sat on my MIL&#39;s queen sized bed (where<br/>
Mitch had slept with her until he was 10), nursing both of the kids; each<br/>
sprawled out their own way, taking up the entirety of the bed.  She stood in<br/>
the doorway and watched, she who&#39;d never nursed, who&#39;s son received human<br/>
milk for the first time during his cancer treatment as an adult.  She got<br/>
it. For the first time, I could see in her eyes that she understood what<br/>

<br/>
Jayn nursed until she was 8, by which time it was mostly at night and always <br/>
at home. She and I came to a mutual agreement to curtail the public nursing <br/>
somewhere around 4 I guess. She was and is extra tall, so she looked older, <br/>
but it seemed to be her idea borne of observing that none of her friends <br/>
around here still nursed.<br/>
<br/>
My very, very (very) sore nipples prompted me to insist that she wean, about <br/>
a year ago now.  It is one of the few things that I have insisted on from <br/>
her. I found that I was unwilling (to the point of dreading) to hug or <br/>
cuddle with her because it inevitably led to her asking to nurse. When we <br/>
stopped nursing I made a concious effort to hug and cuddle her lots more. <br/>
There were a few hard nights, and the occassional wistful mention of it from <br/>
her, but she now seems to have accepted it, and she has become super cuddly <br/>
affectionate.<br/>

page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lazy">http://sandradodd.com/lazy</a><br/>
on the right side, a little way down.<br/>

And because of my looking at that page just now, I wanted to say  <br/>
something I&#39;ve been thinking for a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
To everyone now and in the future:<br/>
<br/>
   I wanted to find a time and reason to brag up Joyce.   Joyce  <br/>
Fetteroll very quietly does as much for unschooling as anyone ever  <br/>
has.  She&#39;s about to catch up with John Holt in terms of hours of  <br/>
thinking and writing.  She&#39;s passed him in direct experience long ago.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll make a whole post so it can be found again in the archives more  <br/>
easily.  But read that link above and think of how many people, if  <br/>
their mothers read that page, will be spared a moment, as Robyn just  <br/>
described, in which they have a moment  in which they reel and feel  <br/>
their whole life has just shifted and schismed.    If our kids do feel  <br/>
that, in 40 years, let it be because they suddenly realize how much we  <br/>
did for them and how little we &quot;had to&quot; do it, within the prevailing  <br/>
culture of the day.  Let it be a shift to appreciation, and not a  <br/>
sinking feeling that life could have been so much easier.<br/>

If she had only known about the charm hold, it might have been a very<br/>
different story.  It was about 16 weeks before Karl figured out how to<br/>
nurse.  I breastfed constantly because he wasn&#39;t getting very much<br/>
milk the way he was trying to suckle, which was more like licking<br/>
instead of sucking.<br/>
<br/>
Breastfeeding is certainly not always trouble free.  I so love it when<br/>
people are able to get the support they need.  I&#39;m sorry about your<br/>
mother.  Gosh that&#39;s sad.<br/>
