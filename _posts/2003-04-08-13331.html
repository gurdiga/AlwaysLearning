<div id="ygrps-yiv-338022423">Well, as far as my friend is concerned, it&#39;s now a moot point. Her cat <br/>
died yesterday. She said she thought he hadn&#39;t been in his body for <br/>
quite awhile--that he came back periodically to &quot;check in&quot; and then <br/>
left again.<br/>
<br/>
She lives in a mobile home court that has restrictions against burying <br/>
animals (may be a state law, although it never stopped us), so she&#39;s <br/>
planning to start her garden early and plant a few bulbs VERY deep.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; But that last few minutes of her life, putting her out on the table <br/>
and getting the shots were not nice.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Tiger, one of our cats, needed to die last summer (we just knew it <br/>
about a day in advance) none of our usual vets (three in the practice) <br/>
were available to come to our home, so they gave me a pill that relaxed <br/>
him for the car ride and we took him in. They ushered us into one of <br/>
the treatment rooms where the lights had been dimmed and a candle was <br/>
burning. We gathered around Tiger and my daughter held him when the <br/>
injection was given. He (Tiger) gave one last long moan and left. Even <br/>
the vet cried.<br/>
<br/>
One of our remaining cats is 16 and our dog is almost 13, so I guess we <br/>
have some sad times ahead.<br/>
