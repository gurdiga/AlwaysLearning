<div id="ygrps-yiv-2111599508">I just got a joke from 1961 &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m listening to a Twilight Zone episode I&#39;m recording for Holly.  It&#39;s <br/>
called &quot;90 years without slumbering,&quot; and is based on the song &quot;My <br/>
Grandfather&#39;s Clock.&quot;  She likes that song, and she likes Twilight Zone.<br/>
<br/>
So...<br/>
The old guy, who&#39;s played by Ed Wynn, known by Holly from Mary Poppins, goes <br/>
to a psychiatrist.  <br/>
<br/>
At some point he says &quot;Do you think I&#39;m crazy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The doctor hesitated and said &quot;&#39;Crazy&#39; is a big word.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s funny.  <br/>
In the 60&#39;s people were really afraid of psychiatry.  Very skeptical.  But <br/>
the &quot;right&quot; phrase would have been &quot;schizophrenic is a big word&quot; or some <br/>
such.   &quot;Crazy&quot; isn&#39;t a big word.  Lots of good jokes on Twilight Zone just <br/>
go by, since there&#39;s no laugh track, and it&#39;s not usually intended to be <br/>
funny anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Look what I found!! This kinda follows (in an overkill kind of way &lt;bwg&gt;) a <br/>
conversation at unschooling-dotcom, but it will be more interesting here.  On <br/>
some website someone has annotated this twilight zone episode MUSICALLY.  <br/>
Check it out:<br/>
<br/>
     R2 M1521 Cue IV[&quot;You Really Believe That?&quot;]Lento in C. 26 bars, 1 <br/>
minute. <br/>
                 Scene:At Carol&#39;s suggestion, Sam visits a psychiatrist who <br/>
asks &quot;You really <br/>
                 believe that?&quot; when Sam states that if the clock stops, <br/>
he&#39;ll die. <br/>
                 The harp sff is again acciaccatura Bb up to Bb whole note, <br/>
then tacet till <br/>
                 Bar 5. <br/>
                 The divisi clarinets play ff half note dotted dyad notes <br/>
D/Ab, repeated <br/>
                 next bar. The bass clarinet plays E half note dotted, ff &gt; <br/>
followed by a <br/>
                 quarter rest. After a quartervrest, the vibe plays rising <br/>
quarter notes Ab, <br/>
                 Bb, Cb, sounding pp. Repeated next bar. <br/>
                 In Bar 2, the bass clarinet plays F half note dotted. <br/>
                 In Bar 3, the clarinets play unison half notes Bb to Ab <br/>
to(Bar 4)F whole <br/>
                 note. The bass cl plays half notes D down to C to(Bar 4)Ab. <br/>
In Bar 4, after <br/>
                 a quarter rest, the vibe sounds rising quarter notes Ab, Bb, <br/>
Cb. Etc etc. <br/>
                 In Bar 10, the cue changes to &quot;Allegretto&quot; in 6/8 time as <br/>
the flute and <br/>
                 oboe are soli playing a cheerful melody. The flute plays <br/>
descending <br/>
                 quasi-triplet notes(D/C/Ab to ascending quasi-triplet <br/>
F/Ab/C. Repeated <br/>
                 next bar. Then, in Bar 12, the flute plays quarter note D to <br/>
Eb 8th note, C <br/>
                 down to Ab 8th note up to(Bar 13)D half note dotted. <br/>
                 In bar 10, meanwhile, the oboe plays descending <br/>
quasi-triplet Bb/Ab/F, <br/>
                 and rising D/F/Ab. Repeated next bar. In Bar 12, the oboe <br/>
plays Bb quarter <br/>
                 rinforzando up to C 8th, then Ab quarter down to F 8th up <br/>
yo(Bar 13)Bb <br/>
                 half note dotted. <br/>
                 In Bar 13, the clarinets take over that melody pattern. Etc. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s just one scene.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597230396">Oh!  You have to admit, the music from the Twilight Zone was absolutely <br/>
FANTASTIC!  And, it was great television, too.  I sure wish we could see <br/>
it.  That annotation you found is a cool find.  That was back when <br/>
television stations had in-house orchestras for playing scores and stuff <br/>
like that.  I think it was easier to be a working musician back then <br/>
because of that.  The digital age has made some things a lot easier and <br/>
made other things (like in-house studio orchestras) dinosaurs.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for posting that!<br/>

We&#39;re getting them from Netflix.  They&#39;re not copy protected, so I&#39;m putting <br/>
Holly&#39;s favorites on video.  From websites, we downloaded lists of what <br/>
episodes are on which disks and separately a directory of all the episodes.  <br/>
So we can look up episodes I remember or thing she&#39;s heard about or seen <br/>
reference to on other shows and we order that DVD.   We&#39;ve had lots of fun <br/>
with them!<br/>

<br/>
We&#39;re working our way through the episodes on DVD. Our library has the set. <br/>
Some of them have sparked a lot of discussion with my kids. Lots of them set <br/>
off hoots at the special effects.<br/>
<br/>
The fear of nuclear war and global devastation weaves through so many of the <br/>
episodes that it&#39;s really brought home to my kids what it felt like growing <br/>
up right at that time. They didn&#39;t quite get the emotional impact of &quot;bomb <br/>
drills&quot; when I&#39;d talked about them before.<br/>
