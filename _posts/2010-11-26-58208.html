<br/>
This is mostly just a post about how I think I finally feel comfortable that I&#39;ve &#39;got&#39; unschooling.  Its a strange experience.  I have had so many doubts, or moments where I just don&#39;t know what to do.  I&#39;ve felt at times like I should be able to find mutually happy-making solutions to conflicts, but I can&#39;t always.  And lots of other difficult moments, or conflicts between what my husband and I are capable of doing/giving and what our children want.  And at each of those moments, I&#39;ve felt at a loss, felt like we weren&#39;t unschooling &#39;right&#39; or these conflicts wouldn&#39;t arise.

&quot;Unschooling is the opposite of both authoritarian and hands off parenting. It&#39;s neither about creating rules to remote parent nor about letting kids jump off cliffs. It&#39;s about being more involved in kids lives. It&#39;s about accompanying them as they explore, helping them find safe, respectful and empowering ways to tackle what intrigues them.&quot; (on Family RUNning, March 5, 2009)<br/>

And suddenly, I realized that I&#39;ve done all of that!  What a moment.  Its not perfect, of course, the kids will grow and change, the challenges will be different.  But I&#39;m very excited to believe in myself that this is working!  <br/>

<br/>
Good for you. It is amazing when you have that &#39;aha&#39; moment as Oprah would say.  <br/>
I know when I finally &#39;got&#39; it I was so excited and I had to resist the <br/>
temptation to tell everyone about it, as  others tend to think you&#39;re a bit nuts <br/>
- well maybe thats just my family!<br/>

If you&#39;ve adopted a set of principles and priorities, it will make decisionmaking easier.  And I don&#39;t mean to choose your five and write them down.  I mean to consider what&#39;s important in a situation when you&#39;re making a decision.  And those things can vary.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s 11:00 at night and a child wants to do something that&#39;s outside the house or noisy, the idea of quiet time and consideration for others who are sleeping should take precedence, for sure.<br/>
<br/>
All other things being equal, for me I decided in favor of something new and different, over something same-old, when there was a draw about which thing to do or which way to go.  I decided to take the &quot;more learning&quot; path, if some kids wanted that and some wanted to just do nothing.  (Of course the first option might be to only take the kids who want to do the cool new thing, if there&#39;s a place to leave the other one(s) but that isn&#39;t always the best option anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
It depends.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to explain unschooling, partly because the best answers are &quot;it depends,&quot; followed by questions for the parents to consider while they&#39;re making their decisions.<br/>
<br/>
It depends on time available, time of day, safety, resources, the effect on other people, need for food or rest, and other factors I can&#39;t think of right now. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Some days a certain request would be just perfectly WONDERful to do/pursue, and the same request on another day might be a total flat-out &quot;no&quot; (Or a &quot;maybe later, but not during a funeral,&quot; or whatever it is).<br/>
<br/>
Getting unschooling is a process.  There will be more to get once you&#39;re comfortable with the new understandings and behaviors.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1504557128">Right now my children want to only watch TV and play among themselves or<br/>
with some friends they have. Any other suggestion goes down flat. So I just<br/>
let it be. The other day I myself started some painting after my morning<br/>
chores and guess what my daughter joined me in a while. And then the most<br/>
wonderful thing happened for next three days she painted for hours, of<br/>
course with the TV switched on.<br/>
<br/>
These things do not happen all the time, that too is something that I am<br/>
learning. So if I set this as an example and do it all the time then it<br/>
might start to look like manipulation!!! You see my intention was not to get<br/>
her away from TV. It was simply I and I wanted to paint......what happened<br/>
was a very pleasant surprise. And I liked that.<br/>
<br/>
Another hilarious thing happened or you might it call it a &quot;ahem where do I<br/>
look situation&quot;. We just got a DVD on ships and sailors from the British<br/>
Council Library, my son loves ships so he chose the DVD. Well the first shot<br/>
had a ship and then the next shot had sailors with pleasure women. And these<br/>
women were very fast taking off their clothes. I did not know what to do? So<br/>
I just stayed calm and then guess what happened Ishaan (my 5 year old)<br/>
shouted for his sister and then they both watched the shot and laughed<br/>
loudly and said yuck yuck yuck several times before they almost fell off<br/>
their seats laguhing. so I laughed along and then Ishaan said, &quot;hey mom<br/>
where are the ships man???&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I suggested we try DISC 2. So that is what we did and that had sailors<br/>
enjoying jazz on board!!! By then my son had lost his patience and has<br/>
decided to take BCL to task for deceiving him!! He does not want to look at<br/>
the DVD any more.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter of course asked me a few questions on the women so I answered<br/>
matter-of-fact. They let the case rest.... Now Ishaan is watching BOLT and<br/>
my daughter is watching a Hindi love story &quot;Love Aaj Kal&quot; meaning loves as<br/>
it is today and as it was in the past????<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s a big part of every facet and aspect of living.<br/>
<br/>
The very same action in one friend can be love, and from another friend insult.   Some people can&#39;t read those things and some can.  Some kids don&#39;t read the parents very well and some do.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mean to complicate the whole thing, and Kelly&#39;s right that the reasons for doing something make a difference in the realm of learning and parenting, for absolute sure.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>
<br/>
For anyone who has been confused at all about what &quot;interpersonal intelligence&quot; might involve, it is, in part, sensing intentions.<br/>
And &quot;intrapersonal intelligence&quot; includes being clear about one&#39;s own intentions.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids know things about other people that you don&#39;t think they could &quot;know,&quot; it&#39;s worth considering that the kids have more ability in that area than the parent.  And vice versa, if a mom is very perceptive and the child seems more clueless, maybe he just doesn&#39;t have as much of that as the mom has.<br/>
<br/>
AND:  Anyone who grew up doing what other people told them to do, and believing what other people told them to believe, will need some recovery time to regain the ability to trust their own instincts, same as about food or sleeping.<br/>

<br/>
I grew up in an isolated rural area with few social opportunities and was<br/>
also isolated due to hearing loss as well. I *know* how easy it is for Karl<br/>
to talk to people and interact, that he knows more about that than I do. My<br/>
siblings and I, who disagreed with the decision, know more about those<br/>
things than my parents who isolated themselves. We were interested in such<br/>
things.<br/>
<br/>
None of us have exactly the same views or experiences leading to the same<br/>
conclusions as the parents. And that will be true to some degree for almost<br/>
every parent and child. I don&#39;t have to look for each and every unique<br/>
difference between me and my child, and I&#39;m glad that the uniqueness of the<br/>
individual is frequently part of the discussion on unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s installment from Sandra&#39;s blog Just Add Light and Stir was about<br/>
that very thing:<br/>

<br/>
Let me reword that: Since the uniqueness of individuals is frequently part<br/>
of the discussion on unschooling, I don&#39;t have to look for it since by now<br/>
it&#39;s obvious that there are a number of diverse ways, abilities, views and<br/>
so on between me and my child.<br/>
