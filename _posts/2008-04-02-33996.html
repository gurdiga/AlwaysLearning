<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120362176">My daughter, Allison (10), has always been a night owl.  She&#39;s <br/>
encountering an old problem in a new way that has us stumped.<br/>
<br/>
background:  When she was 8 years old, she loved homeschooling but <br/>
reached a point where she felt very lonely and bored.  She asked to go <br/>
to school because she wanted to be around a bunch of kids.  She stayed <br/>
in school all that school year.  Because of the fun she had in 3rd <br/>
grade, she started school the next school year, which was last August, <br/>
as a 4th grader.  After a month of school, she decided 4th wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to be as great as 3rd and returned to homeschooling.  She stayed <br/>
in a quiet state of being from August until late February when she <br/>
seemed to return to her very active, fun seeking, social personality.  <br/>
<br/>
She plays with brother who is 11 years old, but he prefers spending a <br/>
great deal of time alone in his room.  He isn&#39;t as active as she wants <br/>
to be.  She&#39;s feeling lonely, bored and restless.  She&#39;s talked about <br/>
going back to school because at least she has something to do there <br/>
and is around a lot of kids.  But I&#39;ve noticed that the time she <br/>
really seems most lonely and bored is in the evenings and late at <br/>
night.  She sleeps until about 1:00pm most days.  By dinner time, <br/>
she&#39;s the most energetic and ready for something, though she can&#39;t <br/>
seem to explain what she feels like doing except to say she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want to be in our house or our yard.  She&#39;ll tell me she wants to go <br/>
somewhere and do something.  I spend a great deal time of with her <br/>
doing what she wants but she says it&#39;s not enough.  Although she loves <br/>
being with me, I&#39;m not a girl her own age, her own words.<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t really want to return to school, mostly because of the <br/>
hours.  She prefers going to bed past midnight and sleeping until <br/>
afternoon.  She truly hates waking up at 7:00am.  Her ideal situation <br/>
would be to have a place to go from 6:00pm to midnight to just play <br/>
with other children.  She said that if there was a school open at <br/>
those hours, she would want to be there.  We live in a one-street <br/>
neightborhood with few kids.  She has tried to be friends with them <br/>
but they are never out when she wants to be out.  <br/>
<br/>
How can I help her with this?  I&#39;ve tried offering her ideas but she&#39;s <br/>
so bored with all the same old options.  I would love some new ideas!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Seems her choices are school or isolation.<br/>
<br/>
Do you live somewhere that doesn&#39;t have any activities at all for  <br/>
children to do outside of school? Are there no other homeschoolers  <br/>
where you live?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve encountered that here too.  There are supposed to be quite a few<br/>
other homeschooled kids in the area, but we never seem to be able to<br/>
connect with any of them, either interest wise, time wise, or whatever. <br/>
We&#39;ve done classes, regular homeschool outings, email groups, girl<br/>
scouts, etc.  Nothing has seemed to work.  We met one really wonderful<br/>
family and our daughters absolutely loved each other, then they moved to<br/>
California, we still talk, but it&#39;s not the same.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter became really good friends with a neighbor girl, but the<br/>
parents are so horrible that it makes the relationship stink for the<br/>
girls too.<br/>
<br/>
The late night itch to go and do and be is really strong because all day<br/>
long while she&#39;s awake, she is wanting to meet all the people that she<br/>
knows online, and by the end of the day, she becomes a little anxious<br/>
about it.  Beyond, trying over and over and over, there is little else I<br/>
can see to do.<br/>
<br/>
I totally know what this other girl is going through (OP).  It does help<br/>
when I go and do things with my daughter, but I&#39;m still not another girl<br/>
near her age.  I have a great relationship with my daughter, but she<br/>
really would like to have some &quot;in real life&quot; friends and it&#39;s easy to<br/>
become discouraged when you keep trying and puting yourself out there<br/>
with no success.<br/>
<br/>
Right now we are in a lull, partly because of weather, and partly<br/>
because we are considering a big move.  A big move could open more<br/>
doors, although where we are considering moving is not at all where our<br/>
daughter wants to move.  She wants to move to CA, and neither my husband<br/>
or I want to move to CA.  Part of moving is to move somewhere more<br/>
affordable, not less.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I guess my point is that I understand, and I can also see how a<br/>
child could feel totally alone despite great effort to find friends and<br/>
others to connect with.</div>

<br/>
The parents should make the children&#39;s lives busy and full.  They  <br/>
might go a while without a same-age, same gender friend, but it&#39;s no  <br/>
guarantee or natural state of humans, nor even the best thing.  It&#39;s  <br/>
a school thing.  And lots of kids at school don&#39;t have friends.  Or  <br/>
they might have one friend and five tormenters.<br/>
<br/>
Some families have glorified ideas about school, and pass it on to  <br/>
their kids.<br/>
<br/>
Find clubs or groups for whole families, maybe--hiking clubs, or  <br/>
gardening, or photography.    And it might not be specifically for  <br/>
families, but if you do something with your kids and other people (we  <br/>
always had the SCA, and then La Leche League for many years), then  <br/>
you&#39;ll meet other kids either directly or indirectly.    Martial arts  <br/>
has been the shared activity for some families, and they meet  <br/>
others.  Music.<br/>

We&#39;ve been more lucky with my youngest dd.  She is doing girlscouts <br/>
and sports and easily makes friends.  My sons best friends live 2 <br/>
hours away. He&#39;s not into sports.  He has just made a new friend this <br/>
year that seems to be working out well, but they don&#39;t live close and <br/>
we have to arrange for get togethers.  He&#39;s had a couple of other <br/>
friends, but they move away.  He thinks he&#39;s cursed.  He&#39;s not <br/>
complaining of boredom though.  <br/>
My oldest went through the same thing and had 3 hs friends move away <br/>
through the years and the one that didn&#39;t move,was the one she had <br/>
the least in common with.  They grew apart as they got older. <br/>
In our area, it seems most homeschoolers are very christian  and very <br/>
stuctured.  It&#39;s been very hard to get folks to come out and play, <br/>
even with weekly park days through the spring and fall ( I usually <br/>
get 2 to 4 families that come).  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>She has one unschooling friend that we see occasionally.  We don&#39;t <br/>
live near enough for unplanned get togethers.  She has one public <br/>
schooled friend who is so busy with school and extra-curricular <br/>
activities that they talk only talk on the phone every few weeks or <br/>
so.  We know another homeschooling child, he&#39;s an only child, and <br/>
he&#39;s best friends with my son.  We see him and his mom once a <br/>
month.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling for 6 years and have been involved <br/>
in 3 homeschool groups and actively involved in church.  After all <br/>
that time and all our efforts, our friends are the ones listed above.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter did cheerleading in the fall, then went into basketball <br/>
with the county recreation dept. and is now taking swim lessons at <br/>
the YMCA.  She enjoys herself when she&#39;s with other kids but the <br/>
relationships don&#39;t last outside the planned activity.  We are <br/>
looking forward to cheering again in the fall.  We have found <br/>
several summer weekly camps at the county rec. dept. that she thinks <br/>
will be great fun.  But they don&#39;t start until mid-June.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure there are other homeschoolers around but we haven&#39;t seen <br/>
them in a while.  We used to take some homeschool classes but we <br/>
lost interest in the church scene and the closest homeschool classes <br/>
center closed.  She didn&#39;t like the classes anyway because they were <br/>
too structured.  Like I said before, she&#39;s a night owl.  She prefers <br/>
staying up super late and sleeping until late afternoon.  She wants <br/>
to be active after 6pm and the only thing she&#39;s been interested in <br/>
doing is swimming.  She doesn&#39;t want to take any of the other <br/>
classes we discovered.  She says she isn&#39;t interested in them.  She <br/>
knows she wants something but she can&#39;t verbalize what it is other <br/>
than to say she&#39;s tired of being in the house and with us so much.  <br/>
I really don&#39;t know what to do.  This is a time when my mother would <br/>
have told me to suck it up and deal with it.  I don&#39;t want to say <br/>
that to her but I can&#39;t give her a solution she finds acceptable.  <br/>
I&#39;m really not sure what else I can do.<br/>

  Hi Beth,<br/>
  I have a night owl too, so I have an idea of what you&#39;re dealing with. Luckily, I&#39;m a night owl too so Tamzin and I have good chats and play games into the night. Also, she&#39;s not as social as your dd (she likes her alone time), but she still likes to have other girls in her age range to pal around with. Mom is fun, but so are friends &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
  I started trying to grow our local homeschool group (if you don&#39;t have a local group, start one) to find other tweens and teens in our area. I put up flyers and listed our group on homeschooling websites. It&#39;s now blossomed and grown and my dd has made several new friends that are also unschoolers and also night owls &lt;g&gt;. It does take time, but you also have to be proactive and creative in finding other people. Maybe your dd could take some classes in subjects she&#39;s interested in. Even if she meets other schooled kids that she clicks with, she can hang out with them after school and on weekends. That might fill her social need enough that she would be content hanging out with you and pursuing more solitary interests late at night.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-72017741">What about evening type activities?  Sports, girl scouts, gymnastics, a friend over a couple times a week, etc.?  Even if it&#39;s for just a couple of hours in the evening, it may enough of a distraction to get her to midnight without feeling completely bored.  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
But you can&#39;t change the world.  At night, most of the stores are  <br/>
closed.  Movies, even in big cities, quit showing around midnight.   <br/>
She&#39;s too young to be out without her parents late at night anyway,  <br/>
so even if there were places and things, a formal OR informal (or  <br/>
assumed) curfew would pretty much prohibit her being anywhere but  <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These aren&#39;t things you can do much about.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s a deal:  Some games go 24 hours a day, like WoW, Halo2,  <br/>
and she could play with people from other continents, and have  <br/>
friendships within the game, maybe.<br/>

one thing they did a lot was stay until the shop closed (later on  <br/>
Fridays and Saturdays than other days) and join or lead a pick-up  <br/>
game or continuation at someone&#39;s house, sometimes ours.  We have a  <br/>
garage-sized room above the garage, and that was a gaming room for  <br/>
years (still, occasionally), and it&#39;s far enough from where Keith-the- <br/>
