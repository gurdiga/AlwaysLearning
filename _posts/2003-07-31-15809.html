<div id="ygrps-yiv-1370859268">-=-Maybe you need even MORE of a description Sandra? I hate to think <br/>
people can&#39;t figure it out on their own, but I&#39;m just getting fed up <br/>
with people whining about lists that don&#39;t fit their needs rather <br/>
than just finding lists that do.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Ren,<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind a newcomer coming by, but what bothered me (if the complaint you <br/>
saw was from/about the same person) was someone doing the &quot;Can you help me <br/>
even though I doubt unschooling really works, and I really care whether MY child <br/>
learns, though you all probably don&#39;t care about yours&quot; kind of question.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I&#39;m paraphrasing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Probably I should have just not responded.  Maybe a bunch of other people <br/>
here should have responded and been really sweet to her and sent here to a better <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
People wait for me to respond sometimes, and then sometimes those same or <br/>
different people complain about the number of commas and exclamation points I <br/>
used.   <br/>
<br/>
If I went to a dog list and said &quot;I&#39;ve always had cats all my life, but I <br/>
just got a dog and I don&#39;t understand him and I thought maybe you people could <br/>
help me IF you actually have dogs.  My main concern is that I&#39;ve heard dogs <br/>
aren&#39;t just big cats, but I&#39;ve looked at mine and he has the same basic shape and <br/>
structure and since I know more about cats, I figured if I treat him like a <br/>
cat, he&#39;ll eventually act like one.  He&#39;s loving the cat food, and he&#39;ll sit on <br/>
my lap, but I don&#39;t know why he won&#39;t just climb up on one of the fabric <br/>
shelves and sleep like I want him to.  He keeps hanging around me and looking at <br/>
me.  So probably this is a problem I could solve on my own, and I&#39;m going to go <br/>
and buy him some catnip now, but I thought I&#39;d give you all a chance to tell <br/>
me I&#39;m doing the right thing,&quot; how nice should they be to me?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It was the same person.  And this was one of the rare instances where I<br/>
thought you had misread her intentions.  I thought the way she phrased her<br/>
question was more just a newbie fear that it really *wouldn&#39;t* work, and<br/>
then she&#39;d be responsible for ruining her kids or something.  It was all<br/>
over before I had a chance to say anything though.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s where a different list intro might help.  &quot;You&#39;re welcome here, even<br/>
if you&#39;re not sure about unschooling, but it would be best to just read for<br/>
a while before asking questions.  By then, many of them will already have<br/>
been answered.&quot;  Or something like that.<br/>
