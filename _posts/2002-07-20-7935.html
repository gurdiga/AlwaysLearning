<div id="ygrps-yiv-953343209">I ordered the Thinking Sticks a while ago, and we LOVED them. (I think Sandra <br/>
said we were her first Paypal cutomers!) Anyway, at Christmas we have a <br/>
tradition of making gifts for one another, and, inspired by the TS, I made my <br/>
son and partner a Skit Kit. The sticks have characters, situations, places, <br/>
props, etc., and they can take one, two, or more and create quick skits. <br/>
We&#39;ve also used them for the church Youth Group.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-864255388">-=- I have two orders today for Thinking Sticks, one from Australia<br/>
and one from the U.K.  I&#39;m nearly out of Thinking Sticks and so<br/>
needing to make some anyway -=-<br/>

Hi Sandra -- I&#39;ve looked up Thinking Sticks on your site but I can&#39;t<br/>
quite get a grasp on what they are / how they are used. Can you<br/>
explain a little bit? I&#39;m intrigued.<br/>

If I explain too much, the directions won&#39;t be as fun as they are.<br/>
<br/>
You throw two sticks down and think of a connection between those two  <br/>
things that no one in your group has stated before.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s more, but that&#39;s enough.<br/>
<br/>
They first came out of a workshop years ago on hard thinking made  <br/>
simple (I think it was called).<br/>

me, and &quot;controls&quot; them. We take it in turns to ask for a colour and <br/>
she pulls out a stick that colour, then reads the 2 words off it, <br/>
then we all have a bit of a free-for-all coming up with connections.<br/>

It leads into all sorts of conversations, musings, questions to look <br/>
up later...<br/>
<br/>
I decided to get them because postage for Sandra&#39;s book or for <br/>
Sandra&#39;s book + thinking sticks was the same amount. It seemed silly <br/>
to &quot;waste&quot; that extra postage potential. &lt;vbg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-92622317">These sound fantastic for grabbing for on the go times.  Due to hubby&#39;s illness we end up in doctor offices a lot and this sounds like something fun we could tote along and do together.  Thanks for the info.<br/>

They&#39;re very portable, and there are lots of games to play with them.<br/>
