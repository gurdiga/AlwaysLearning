<div id="ygrps-yiv-1605654151">I&#39;ve been part of this group for a while, and haven&#39;t actually asked<br/>
for the support i need and needed when i joined. So i thought i&#39;d<br/>
post, and ask for some advice on one of the many topics i probably<br/>
need advice about. My sons are seven and four, and i<br/>
homeschool/unschool them. Our normal methods of punishment include<br/>
grounding and time outs, and when the kids don&#39;t respond to those<br/>
spanking. I&#39;ve been reading the articles about not spanking on the<br/>
Sanda Dodd website, and i really dislike the idea and act of spanking<br/>
my sons, but i don&#39;t understand how to respond when grounding and time<br/>
outs don&#39;t work. I assume it would have been easier on me and them if<br/>
i had practiced different approaches to parenting earlier, but what<br/>
can i do now to help change their habits of misbehavior and my habits<br/>
of how i respond to it? It seems like trying to be more compassionate<br/>
and respectful toward them is just something they use to take<br/>
advantage of me. Any advice will be open mindedly considered and<br/>
appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Conventional parenting is about controlling kids and shaping them  <br/>
into what we think it best for them to be. The problem is that it  <br/>
assumes kids are naturally bad, that they don&#39;t want to be kind and  <br/>
helpful.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>First change you. Change how you see them and their behavior. Change  <br/>
how you interact with them.<br/>
<br/>
Assume that kids are doing the best they can with the skills they  <br/>
have. Be their partner rather than their molder and shaper.<br/>
<br/>
It will probably be rough. Ask lots of question here! If you&#39;ve been  <br/>
controlling them, they&#39;re going to test what were previously limits.  <br/>
(I wouldn&#39;t suggest eliminating all rules. If you&#39;ve used &quot;I do this  <br/>
because I care,&quot; as an method to get them to do what you want, it&#39;s  <br/>
going to seem like you don&#39;t care if you let go of rules all of a  <br/>
sudden.) Your goal isn&#39;t to obey rules but to make choices based on  <br/>
principles. But it will be difficult getting. Though not any more  <br/>
difficult than what you&#39;re doing now. And with better results!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It seems like trying to be more compassionate<br/>

&gt; advantage of me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you can give us some examples people can give you a different  <br/>
perspective and new ideas.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be easy. It will help lots to not see it as them taking  <br/>
advantage of you but healing from the control. Controlled people  <br/>
often don&#39;t respect those controlling them. It&#39;s a form of self  <br/>
protection. And it will take a while before they trust that you&#39;re on  <br/>
their side, there to help them get what they want rather than being  <br/>
their adversary in getting them to do what you want.<br/>
<br/>
Think about it this way: If your husband had the power to make you do  <br/>
things you didn&#39;t believe were best for you, would you respect him  <br/>
and his ideas? In a situation like that the options are: pretending  <br/>
and then sneaking behind his back to do what you think is right,  <br/>
fighting against his control of you, or giving up and accepting that  <br/>
you don&#39;t know anything and should just go along with whatever he  <br/>
tells you to. Is that what you want?<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that if you&#39;ve relaxed rules and then given up and  <br/>
put them back, it encourages them to believe that any relaxation of  <br/>
rules is only temporary and they need to take advantage of the  <br/>
freedom while they have it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1928453814">All of Joyce&#39;s post is great.<br/>
<br/>
If you give us some specific examples, as she suggested, we can help  <br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a list you can join for ideas.  Pam Sorooshian owns it.  It&#39;s  <br/>
to discuss ways to live without spanking.  Pam was never spanked as a  <br/>
child, so it&#39;s not a recovery action for her, it&#39;s just to help  <br/>
others get ideas and understand.  If you join you could read the  <br/>
archives and any files they have there.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NoMoreSpanking/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/NoMoreSpanking/</a><br/>
<br/>
The intro says:<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of the NoMoreSpanking list is support for parents who  <br/>
wish to discover and utilize alternatives to spanking their children.  <br/>
This list is not for debating, but is for providing help,  <br/>
information, ideas, and encouragement for those who prefer not to use  <br/>
corporal punishment on their children.<br/>
<br/>
The point of view of this list is that punishment may control a  <br/>
specific behavior but that it interferes with the long-term goal of  <br/>
promoting self-control and that alternative nonpunitive ways of  <br/>
relating to children are preferred. Punishment includes hitting,  <br/>
spanking, swatting, shaming, ridiculing, threatening, using harsh or  <br/>
cruel words, penalizing, holding back rewards, or other methods that  <br/>
assert adult power or vent adult frustration. We are seeking  <br/>
alternative approaches that provide guidance to our children that  <br/>
will encourage self-control, thinking before acting, learning to take  <br/>
responsibility for their own behavior, and especially that will  <br/>
promote a lifelong warm, close, and open relationship between parent  <br/>
and child.<br/>
<br/>
Questions and suggestions and support are welcome from parents, no  <br/>
matter what their parenting philosophies or practices, but this is  <br/>
not the place for argumentative posts, particularly those that  <br/>
justify spanking.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joyce and Sandra already gave you great information. You might also find <br/>
Alfie Kohn&#39;s book _Unconditional Parenting_ a useful tool to help shift <br/>
your thinking about reward/ punishment based parenting. Seven and four <br/>
are still really young--it&#39;s never too late to shift to respectful, <br/>
gentle parenting practices. In addition to the &quot;no more spanking&quot; list <br/>
and this list, you may find the AlwaysUnschooled yahoo list, which is <br/>
geared towards radical unschooling of young children, helpful in your <br/>
journey as well.<br/>
<br/>
Regardless of which list, however, posting about specific problems, as <br/>
Sandra mentioned, helps people brainstorm with you for alternative <br/>
solutions in that kind of moment. Specifics are often more helpful than <br/>
generalities.<br/>

punishment is part of it?<br/>
<br/>
What rules are they breaking or what sins are they committing?<br/>
<br/>
If you find ways to see yourself as their lovely assistant, whose job  <br/>
it is to help them get what they want, it will be harder to find them  <br/>
&quot;breaking rules.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re not getting along with each other, first you should be  <br/>
right with them more often and not leave them alone, but you might  <br/>
consider some of the ideas here, too:<br/>

<br/>
If they&#39;re not going to bed on time or finishing all their food or  <br/>
they&#39;re watching too much TV...<br/>
If you stop having rules about things like that, they can&#39;t break the  <br/>
rules.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-262014994">Elizabeth Crary has some great books to read with kids regarding problem solving and situations with other children. In each book there is a situation( a boy doesn&#39;t know how to deal with his noisy sister) some given ways to deal with the problem(leave the room,distract her, get help) and then outcomes. The books are great as they give kids options and ideas. Great place to start discussions on how we treat each other, how to solve problems and how we can choose how we view situations.<br/>

Been lurking and this thread caught my attention because I have a 2 yo that is a handful. Now, she&#39;s never been punsihed, or even had stern words (Idon&#39;t believe in stuff like that) but her tantrums are becoming a real problem. She wont sit in a chair to be fed but she&#39;s now becoming too heavy to feed on a lap, she hates going in the car seat and screams the entire journey, she screams in shops cos she hates shops, she screams in her wheelchair cos she hates that and wants to be carried.<br/>
  I just don&#39;t know how to get through to her. She&#39;s blind and brain damaged and can&#39;t move a muscle (apart from her mouth!) but she&#39;s smart (or so I&#39;m told) so she should be cappable of learning that being a tyrant is not a way to live and its stressing us all out. We are traped at home because of her behaviour.<br/>
  Any ideas?<br/>

  They tend to go for the putting the kids in school as soon as possible thing. I don&#39;t think that because Celyn has a few problems that she can&#39;t learn through unschooling type methods. Its just figuring out how.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know about the blindness, Shyrley.  Sorry.<br/>

  Makes it a little bit more tricky cos she can&#39;t use her hands either. But its a cortical blindness. There&#39;s nothing wrong with her eyes. Hopefully, with lots of work we can train her brain to see again.<br/>

  I think institutions (and I&#39;m assuming you&#39;re talking about schools rather than residential type places) are seriously bad places for kids with problems. they don&#39;t get the one-to one they need to develop.<br/>
  I know she&#39;s not being a tyrant really! She&#39;s like any 2 year old would be if you tied them up and blindfolded them. She wants but can&#39;t *do*!<br/>
  But I&#39;m hoping that one day someone will say &#39;hey, I tried this and it worked.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
If your whole family is trapped at home, will unschooling work for  <br/>
any of the kids anymore?<br/>
<br/>
  Well, they are pretty do their own thing anyway. The boys play computer and Magic all day, go to the park, go get groceries etc. H chose to go back to school last September cos she actually likes structured learning. She said she felt like she wasn&#39;t learning academic stuff with my methods. She seems to be enjoying it and knows she can leave at any point but she likes getting A&#39;s in tests. Its just her prefered method. Bit weird to me but we&#39;re all different. I do worry about this will change her values, the whole A = worthwhile person type thing but its her journey.<br/>
  Hubby and I are discussing him giving up work and becoming Celyn&#39; s full time carer. there&#39;s many reasons, mostly my health and slipped disc in my back but the boys are right up there. Once DH is at home then I can do stuff with the boys. There will be time. The last 3 weeks DH has been home and when C&#39;s respite carers have been here he&#39;s taken them digging on our allotment which they love, he&#39;s played Magic with them, done electronics, made cakes. Its what I always pictured unschooling to be! There just needs to be 2 of us to do it. I took them to a hands on science thing they asked to go too.<br/>
  But I am doing my best to make things ok despite the extra stuff Celyn brings.<br/>
  (but I could do with 6 pairs of hands and a lottery win....)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-997985368">Shyrley, we just met on one of the other unschooling lists. We have a  <br/>
friend with cerebral palsy, a little girl who is now three. It sounds  <br/>
like hers is less severe than your daughter&#39;s, but when I met the  <br/>
family a year ago, Rose was completely non-verbal and unable  <br/>
physically to support herself, roll over, manipulate an object. Rose  <br/>
is not completely blind but her vision is very limited. At two, she  <br/>
responded to voices with a smile but not much else.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will be true for your daughter, but the second  <br/>
half of her third year has been huge for Rose, developmentally. She&#39;s  <br/>
using words, can sit in her mother&#39;s lap unsupported, can reach for  <br/>
and grab a toy and amuse herself with it for awhile. She got glasses  <br/>
that seem to help her vision. It&#39;s made a big difference in the whole  <br/>
family&#39;s life--not least because everything Rose manages to do opens  <br/>
up that many more possibilities for her in the future. But also  <br/>
because Rose finally has some control over her body and her life.<br/>
<br/>
A book my friend recently read that she said was very helpful was  <br/>
&quot;What To Do About Your Brain-Damaged Child.&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/">http://www.amazon.com/gp/</a> <br/>

ref=sr_1_1/102-4413944-5599367?%5Fencoding=UTF8<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t read the book and have no idea how it reads from an  <br/>
unschooling perspective. But my friend said it was the first  <br/>
parenting book she ever read that had anything to do with her and her  <br/>
life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1971120530">Thanks. Thats amazing and gives me hope. Loooking back over the last 2 years Celyn has made huge strides froma  baby not expected to live or be a vegetable to an opiniated little red haired madam. having the ed Psych tell us she wasn&#39;t retarded was the best thing ever (and I mean no disrespect to people who are retarded or have mental impairments.)<br/>
  Hubby and I give Celyn 100% input all the time to help her. Some of it is a bit against my principles -  for example, Celyn has already realised that trying to reach is tough. So she doesn&#39;t do it, she knows her minions will hold the toy for her or press her switch. So I&#39;m telling her if she doesn&#39;t press her switch then the toy wont move and I ain&#39;t doing it. I also make her signal yes and no or pick up rather than make assumptions. She has tantrums sometimes about being made to do stuff but heck, she&#39;s 2.<br/>
  But thanks for that. It gives me hope.<br/>
