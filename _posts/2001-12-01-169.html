<div id="ygrps-yiv-1235638621">I think I just said &quot;Gardner&quot; in a post discussing math books, and that&#39;s <br/>
confusion for sure.  This is an interview with Howard Gardner.  It was on an <br/>
NEA site, so prepare for a little irritation; you&#39;ll know which are the <br/>
questions, I think.  If not, the original was at  <br/>

Extra! Extra!<br/>
Interview with Howard Gardner<br/>
<br/>
Howard Gardner, director of the Project Zero at the Harvard Graduate School <br/>
of Education, introduced the theory of multiple intelligences in 1983. <br/>
Gardner spoke recently with NEA Today&#39;s Stefanie Weiss, and a condensed <br/>
version of that interview appears in the March issue. Just for NEA Today <br/>
Online readers, here&#39;s the full interview.<br/>
<br/>
Can you give a shorthand version of your theory of multiple intelligences?<br/>
<br/>
Multiple intelligences is a psychological theory about the mind. It’s a <br/>
critique of the notion that there’s a single intelligence which we’re born <br/>
with, which can’t be changed, and which psychologists can measure. It’s <br/>
based on a lot of scientific research in fields ranging from psychology to <br/>
anthropology to biology. It’s not based upon based on test correlations, <br/>
which most other intelligence theories are based on.<br/>
<br/>
The claim is that there are at least eight different human intelligences. <br/>
Most intelligence tests look at language or logic or both – those are just <br/>
two of the intelligences. The other six are musical, spatial, <br/>
bodily/kinestheic, interpersonal, intrapersonal, and naturalist. <br/>
<br/>
I make two claims. The first claim is that all human beings have all of these <br/>
intelligences. It’s part of our species definition. The second claim is that, <br/>
both because of our genetics and our environment, no two people have exactly <br/>
the same profile of intelligences, not even identical twins, because their <br/>
experiences are different. <br/>
<br/>
This is where we shift from science to education. If we all have different <br/>
kinds of minds, we have a choice. We can either ignore those differences and <br/>
teach everybody the same stuff in the same way and assess everybody in the <br/>
same way. Or we can say, look, people learn in different kinds of ways, and <br/>
they have different intellectual strengths and weaknesses. Let’s take that <br/>
into account in how we teach and how we assess. <br/>
<br/>
So how should teachers who believe in your theory change their approach to <br/>
teaching?<br/>
<br/>
Multiple intelligences (MI) is a tool. It’s not a goal. That means that you <br/>
have to decide what you want to teach, and that should be based on what you <br/>
think is important. Nowadays often it’s other people who are telling us what <br/>
to teach. That’s not what I favor. But whoever makes the decisions, once <br/>
those decisions are made, that’s when MI can come into action. <br/>
<br/>
In my own work, I’m a proponent of teaching for understanding, which means <br/>
going deeply into topics so that students can really make use of knowledge in <br/>
new situations. This is very, very different from most teaching, where people <br/>
memorize material and can reproduce it on demand but can’t make use of it in <br/>
new situations. That’s what understanding entails. If you favor education for <br/>
understanding the way I do, then MI can be extremely helpful. Because when <br/>
you are teaching a topic, you can approach the topic in many ways, thereby <br/>
activating different intelligences. You can provide analogies and metaphors <br/>
for different domains, invading different intelligences, and finally, you can <br/>
present the key ideas in a number of different languages or symbol systems, <br/>
again activating different intelligences. <br/>
<br/>
But obviously you can’t do that if you’re going to spend five minutes on a <br/>
topic and then move on to something. Then you’re almost constrained to <br/>
present it one way, which is usually verbally, and to give people a <br/>
short-answer test. You can see that I’m very much in opposition to the <br/>
current state and national trends, which create more tests, often of a <br/>
short-answer sort, favoring coverage or noncoverage and not probing deeply <br/>
into what people really understand.<br/>
<br/>
Can standardized tests ever hope to measure children’s full intelligence?<br/>
<br/>
I’m not in favor of tests that are designed to measure people’s <br/>
intelligence, because frankly I don’t care what intelligence or intelligences <br/>
people have. I care whether they can do things which we value in our culture. <br/>
What good is it to know if you have an IQ of 90 or 110 – or even if you can <br/>
jack it up to 120 through a lot of training – if, in the end, you can’t do <br/>
anything. <br/>
<br/>
I think our assessments ought to focus on the kinds of things we want people <br/>
to understand, and they ought to give people a chance to perform their <br/>
understandings. Because, at the end of the day, it doesn’t matter if you have <br/>
an IQ of 160 if you sit around and do nothing. What’s important is whatever <br/>
IQ you have or whatever profile of intelligences you have, that you can <br/>
demonstrate knowledge and understanding of things that matter.<br/>
So do you think the high-stakes testing movement that we’re seeing now is <br/>
going to force people to abandon different approaches to teaching?<br/>
<br/>
Yes. Current approaches almost inevitably push people to teach to the test, <br/>
because those tests are so high-stake both for students and for teachers. <br/>
Now, in principle, one could have assessments which probe understanding, and <br/>
they could even be standardized. I would be much more in favor of those <br/>
assessments. But those assessments would have to give people lots of choices. <br/>
Because, say you’re doing American history, you have to say to people, “I <br/>
want you to discuss, let’s say, the role of immigration in America, but you <br/>
can discuss it with reference to any one of 20 different groups or 20 <br/>
different issues.&quot; If, on the other hand, you require people to know all 20 <br/>
different groups and all 20 issues, then obviously, they can’t know very much <br/>
about any one of them. It’s just a very superficial, Jeopardy-style <br/>
knowledge. <br/>
<br/>
Now let’s be clear about this: Assessment is fine. Even standardized <br/>
assessment is fine, if it looks at things which are important and allows us <br/>
to probe in-depth what people understand. But if it’s just whether you <br/>
memorized the encyclopedia and can spit it out, it’s of no value, because a <br/>
year later, even six months later, you’ll have forgotten everything because <br/>
you will not have had any kind of understanding.<br/>
<br/>
How do you respond to those who say that MI theory is appealing, but there’s <br/>
no proof to back it up?<br/>
<br/>
There’s no short answer to that question. To begin with, it’s a scientific <br/>
theory, and so it needs to be evaluated on the basis of the science on which <br/>
it draws. And I think it does quite well in terms of the scientific evidence, <br/>
even the evidence that’s accumulated since the theory was first propounded 20 <br/>
years ago. I have a new book coming out this fall called Multiple <br/>
Intelligences Reframed, where in fact I discuss a few new intelligences, and <br/>
also discuss the scientific evidence for it. So when people say it hasn’t <br/>
been proved, we first have to say what’s the scientific evidence for and <br/>
against it--and I think the scientific evidence stacks pretty well.<br/>
<br/>
Now, I’ve never espoused a particular program in schools. There are no <br/>
Gardner schools, and there is no MI approach. So when people say it hasn’t <br/>
been proved, it’s a senseless statement. What you have to say is, “Has this <br/>
particular implementation of MI theory, in this particular place, produced <br/>
better student learning?” <br/>
<br/>
Mindy Kornhaber at Project Zero has been investigating 42 different schools <br/>
which have been using MI theory for at least three years, and those schools <br/>
report a lot of success with students, on both hard measures--how they do on <br/>
tests--and on softer measures, like absenteeism and parental involvement. <br/>
<br/>
When I was interviewed by Time magazine and asked about the effects of MI in <br/>
schools, I was very cautious, because even if those schools are doing <br/>
wonderfully, we don’t know for sure whether it’s because of MI. There are a <br/>
hundred different things that could be going on in those schools. <br/>
<br/>
I was criticized for being honest. The implication was that if I lied and <br/>
said these schools are better and we know it’s because of MI theory, then <br/>
therefore the theory would have been proved correct. <br/>
<br/>
So this question is much more detailed and technical than the question itself <br/>
implies. But if you want a flip answer, the flip answer is, if we know the <br/>
other approaches haven’t worked because we wouldn’t be in the situation <br/>
we’re in if they had, then you’d be a fool not to try something new. <br/>
<br/>
But as I hope I’ve made clear to you, there isn’t a single MI approach. <br/>
Basically, the idea is if you value the differences among students and take <br/>
them very seriously, that should have implications for how you present <br/>
material. That’s the only absolute implication from the theory. But whether <br/>
you teach seven courses or eight courses or you teach something seven ways or <br/>
eight ways, or you teach to strength or you teach to weakness, those are all <br/>
decisions made by educators. They don’t follow from the theory. <br/>
<br/>
Are you working with any particular schools? Are you working with the Key <br/>
School now?<br/>
<br/>
I continue to have relationships with certain schools where I’ve known the <br/>
people for a long time. One of them is the Key School, which is now called <br/>
the Key Learning Community. Another is the New City School in St. Louis. I <br/>
visit those schools on a regular basis. I will visit both schools this year <br/>
again. But it’s their school. It’s not my school. And I take great pride <br/>
when good things happen there, but I’m not egocentric enough to assume that <br/>
it’s because I make visits out there or because they’ve read my books. It’s <br/>
because they’re good educators.<br/>
I think this is really important for your readers to understand, because most <br/>
names they’ve heard of and most approaches they’ve heard of, somebody’s got <br/>
a line, so to speak, or a set of principles, so to speak, or a program or a <br/>
package. I’ve got nothing like that. I’ve got a set of ideas, and I’m most <br/>
interested when people use those ideas in ways that make sense to them, not <br/>
when somebody else tells them you’ve got to teach this in seven different <br/>
ways because Gardner says there’s seven different intelligences.<br/>
<br/>
How can people sort through all the MI stuff that’s out there?<br/>
<br/>
As a matter of principle, I don’t endorse any commercial products, so no <br/>
conclusions should be drawn one way or the other. I would say that it <br/>
probably is a big mistake to rely only on one person or one book. In the new <br/>
book, Multiple Intelligences Reframed, I list almost 100 books on the topic <br/>
and hundreds and hundreds of articles, and so I think any smart consumer <br/>
ought to:<br/>
<br/>
*   Look at a number of different publications, <br/>
*   Visit a number of different schools or go to a number of different <br/>
workshops--God knows there are enough of them,<br/>
*   And most important, start a learning community at your own school, where <br/>
you read some of the texts, hopefully including mine, where you talk about <br/>
the ideas, where you examine your own intelligences--where you’re strong, <br/>
where you’re weak, how that affects your teaching, what you might do <br/>
differently if you had a different set of intelligences. Watch some of the <br/>
teachers, exchange and trade classes, and then begin to try things out with <br/>
kids and see whether, if you take a more pluralistic approach, that you <br/>
achieve greater success with kids with whom you’re not having success.<br/>
<br/>
There’s no point in doing anything with MI if you think you’re doing a great <br/>
job. You just keep doing what you’re doing. It’s when things aren’t going as <br/>
well as you want, when there are certain kids who you’re not reaching, or you <br/>
have kids who are excited but they’re not able to demonstrate their <br/>
understanding, then you’ve got a problem. That’s when I think you should <br/>
look at ideas like MI and see if they’re useful. <br/>
<br/>
I have another book coming out this year, called The Disciplined Mind: What <br/>
All Students Should Understand. And in that book, I talk about what <br/>
understanding is, and how elusive it is, and how we can approach deeper <br/>
understanding for our kids. At the end of the book, I show how to take three <br/>
topics, one from science (the theory of evolution), one from the arts (the <br/>
music of Mozart), and one from history (the Holocaust), and really engender <br/>
deep understandings by taking an MI approach very seriously. It&#39;s not only <br/>
what I mentioned earlier – the entry points, the analogies, and the model <br/>
languages – but also giving students lots of different ways of showing how <br/>
they understand something. <br/>
<br/>
I was once interviewed on radio about MI. I said I bet you could teach about <br/>
the Civil War using dance, and I got lots of hate mail. I thought about it <br/>
for a while, and I thought about the Spanish Civil War and the painting <br/>
Guernica. And I said I bet you more people understand more about the Spanish <br/>
Civil War from Picasso’s Guernica than from reading the textbook on the <br/>
topic. Almost anything can be illuminated in surprising ways if you open up <br/>
your mind to the variety of intelligences.<br/>
<br/>
Where is it said that the only way to learn about something is to read a <br/>
chapter on it and answer a set of short-answer questions? Certainly in other <br/>
countries, they don’t do that. But part of our numerical, standardized test <br/>
bias is many people think that’s the only way to show something. And the <br/>
greatest paradox is that people who were often the worst students when they <br/>
were young are the ones who believe that the strongest, whereas people who <br/>
were better students, who had more of a liberal arts education, understand <br/>
that the questions we ask are more important than the answers that we come up <br/>
with, and the more ways that we can think about something, the deeper our <br/>
understanding is.<br/>
<br/>
What do you say to people who say that linguistic and logical-mathematical <br/>
intelligences are more important than the other six?<br/>
<br/>
There’s no question that if you have a certain combination of language and <br/>
logic, you’re going to be facile in handling the kinds of tests we usually <br/>
give, and as long as you stay in school, you’ll think you’re smart. If you <br/>
ever should walk out into the street, you might be in for a huge shock. <br/>
Conversely, if you’re not good in language and logic in school, you’ll have <br/>
a harder time because you’ll think you’re dumb, and you kind of have to get <br/>
through school to show what it is that you can accomplish in life. <br/>
<br/>
However, there’s a very important distinction between the intelligence and <br/>
the domain. An intelligence is a way of processing, which your mind/brain <br/>
has. A domain is a subject or topic that you want to master. Any domain can <br/>
be mastered through a lot of different intelligences. You don’t have to use <br/>
language and logic.<br/>
<br/>
So if you’re trying to understand history or science or arts, you can use <br/>
intelligences like spatial intelligence or musical intelligence or personal <br/>
intelligence or the naturalist intelligence. A large part of education, <br/>
whether it’s self-education or scholastic education, is figuring how to get <br/>
your particular mind/brain to learn what it is that it needs to learn. <br/>
<br/>
So if you’re not very good in language and logic, you’ve got three choices: <br/>
one is to punt, the other is to improve those--and if you can improve them, <br/>
great--and the third is to say, well I can learn about things in other ways. <br/>
Let’s see whether I can use those other ways to do a better job.<br/>
<br/>
I’m very bad with maps, spatial kinds of things, geometry. I try to exercise <br/>
my spatial muscles, and they’ve probably gotten somewhat better. But there <br/>
are lots of other ways to find your way around besides maps, and it’s often <br/>
very good to use the intelligences that are there. <br/>
Indeed I often say that if anybody doesn’t believe in multiple intelligences, <br/>
they should go on an automobile ride with three other people and get totally <br/>
lost and see how each person tries to get back home. That will make them an <br/>
instant convert to the theory of multiple intelligences. People do not think <br/>
the same way.<br/>
What does a first grade teacher need to know about MI compared to, say, a <br/>
high school biology teacher?<br/>
The very basic claims that I talked about, namely that we all have these <br/>
intelligences but that we differ from one another. I think that’s clearly <br/>
something everybody should know. But the task of a first grade teacher is not <br/>
identical to that of a high school teacher. One thing which I think the <br/>
United States is very bad on is most first grade teachers don’t know what’s <br/>
going on in high school and vice versa, and I think we both lose that way. <br/>
I’m in favor of what are called pathways, where you really think education <br/>
through from K to 12. <br/>
That being said, I believe that the purpose of later education – middle <br/>
school, high school, and beyond – is to master the disciplines. So the <br/>
question that I confront in The Disciplined Mind is, how can our knowledge, <br/>
given the intelligences, help us learn to think like a historian, like a <br/>
scientist, and so on? If we don’t change the way people think about those <br/>
things, then school is a waste of time after elementary school.<br/>
On the other hand, in elementary school, that’s basically not a time for <br/>
disciplined learning. It’s a time for getting excited about learning, to be <br/>
curious about things, to be motivated, to want to find out more, and then to <br/>
begin to introduce some very gross distinctions – like the difference between <br/>
something that happened that we’re trying to describe historically and <br/>
something that was invented, like a fable. That’s the kind of thing that kids <br/>
need to begin to understand when they’re 8, 9, 10, 11 years of age, because <br/>
otherwise they won’t understand history. <br/>
Similarly, science consists of claims for which evidence exists, and you can <br/>
accumulate more evidence, for or against a particular point. That’s very <br/>
different from something that’s just a question of opinion or belief. And <br/>
again, that’s the kind of thing that should be handled in the elementary <br/>
years because otherwise you’ll never be able to learn the disciplines. <br/>
