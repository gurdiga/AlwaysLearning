&lt;&lt;&lt;-=-I really truly believe that life is for LIVING not for  watching other <br/>
people live!-=-&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I think there is a lot to be said for watching people. I have learned a  <br/>
whole heck of a lot over the years watching people. From the time I was very,  <br/>
very young (under 5) to at least when my oldest was born (I don&#39;t have much time  <br/>
for just watching any more), I have loved people-watching. One of my <br/>
*favorite*  activities (before kids) is going to the mall on Christmas Eve and sitting <br/>
smack  in the middle and watching the folks. The most people I can imagine in <br/>
one place  to watch. What I&#39;ve learned while watching other people has helped <br/>
me in my  relationships with friends, love-interests, customers, strangers, <br/>
businesses and  most certainly my children.<br/>
 <br/>
It may fit into those &quot;learning styles&quot; kind of things, since some people  <br/>
learn by doing, some learn by reading, some by watching... I&#39;ve learned a lot  <br/>
about what I want (which is what brought unschooling fully into our lives) and  <br/>
what I *don&#39;t* want by watching. I&#39;ve also learned a lot of nuances, how the  <br/>
details of little things work between people by watching. Watching has been  <br/>
pretty good for me.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

I used to like to watch other people in church.  I could learn a lot  <br/>
about what people thought about the sermon by watching their facial  <br/>
expressions.  Most seemed to think they wished it would be over. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
And I used to feel sorry for the organist and music director because  <br/>
they were stuck being up there in front of everyone with their facial  <br/>
expressions part of the whole tableau.  They had to be attentive and  <br/>
approving and not bored-looking.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve watched lots of people performing (plays, music, juggling/ <br/>
comedy).   The line between watching other people work or build or  <br/>
play sports or music and doing it oneself isn&#39;t so black and white.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>People watching, now that&#39;s an activity in and of itself!  We often go<br/>
out of our way to go THROUGH downtown rather than around it on the<br/>
freeway, just for this alone!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a whole different thing than watching someone else live their<br/>
life and not really doing anything yourself.  Kind of like how the<br/>
character &quot;Kelly&quot; is in the american version of  &quot;The Office&quot;.  She<br/>
absolutely lives for Hollywood gossip and has made it her life, well<br/>
that, and her sort of ex-boyfriend.</div>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think this is a recent phenomenon, though, nor necessarily evil.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who collect things.  A guy sold his collection of  <br/>
mechanical banks at auction.  It made millions of dollars.  Was that  <br/>
living his life?   Probably the fifteenth or twentieth bank he  <br/>
bought, his relatives were rolling their eyes about how he should get  <br/>
a life.<br/>
<br/>
What if he had been saving Paul Newman souvenirs?  Paul Newman died.   <br/>
People care.<br/>
<br/>
What if someone is an expert on baseball stats?<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t know by watching what a person does whether it&#39;s valuable  <br/>
emotionally or intellectually or morally to them.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s mom has always thought his SCA activity was stupid and a  <br/>
waste of time.  She was embarrassed that he dressed up and had a made- <br/>
up  name.   Years back she worked at a hospital (head nurse of ICU)  <br/>
and a friend of ours who was an anesthesist discovered the  <br/>
connection.  She told Keith&#39;s mom, at work, how wonderful Keith is,  <br/>
how talented, and how popular.  His mom was more impressed then, but  <br/>
she was impressed because a medical professional said Keith was great.<br/>
<br/>
Keith is waking Marty up right now to go to fighter practice (armored  <br/>
combat get-together that happens every week here, and has since  <br/>
before I knew Keith).   He told me a while ago that he doesn&#39;t feel  <br/>
very good and doesn&#39;t want to go, but Marty is just really getting  <br/>
into it lately and Keith wants to be supportive, and he likes to see  <br/>
people&#39;s reactions to Marty.<br/>
<br/>
So even though Keith and Marty are doing something of questionable  <br/>
value on the general market of the respect activities get, Keith is  <br/>
directly proud of Marty, and involved, and interested.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure stamp collecting or playing WoW would be any better or  <br/>
worse.  Golf?  If Keith and his son played golf every week, more  <br/>
people would be impressed.  I wouldn&#39;t be among them.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Today we went to see the film of the last performance of RENT on  <br/>
Broadway. I&#39;ve seen RENT live quite a few times, including on Broadway  <br/>
just a few months ago. I got pretty caught up in the performance and I  <br/>
started to applaud with the filmed audience. One of my daughters  <br/>
touched my arm and I caught myself - I was the only person in the  <br/>
theater who was applauding. Later in the show, other people did the  <br/>
same thing, though.<br/>
<br/>
Not just &quot;watching&quot; - but sitting in a theater watching a film of a  <br/>
show being performed in front of an audience of people who were &quot;just  <br/>
watching.&quot; &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It got me thinking about applause and audience reaction to a  <br/>
performance. A &quot;good&quot; audience can make show better. And vice versa.<br/>
<br/>
Hmm, which means it is a good idea to clap and yell bravo like crazy  <br/>
in the beginning of a show - get the performers psyched up.<br/>
<br/>
But, the applause won&#39;t have any effect when the show is on film -  <br/>
guess that&#39;s one reason why people didn&#39;t applaud. It was an odd  <br/>
feeling for me - I&#39;m used to expressing myself during a show!<br/>

<br/>
Half the people watching that with us were applauding.  I wasn&#39;t, but  <br/>
I did a couple of times gasp or say &quot;Wow&quot; and I didn&#39;t feel so bad  <br/>
saying something aloud, because I wasn&#39;t going to distract those  <br/>
actors. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One guy couldn&#39;t help singing along once in a while, but it was  <br/>
fine.  He wasn&#39;t distracting the performers either!<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I were doing something together and we discussed it and now  <br/>
I&#39;m sharing feedback with Pam (and others) who also saw it.  We&#39;ve  <br/>
already talked (Holly and I) a fair amount about Desperate  <br/>
Housewives.  They&#39;re not &quot;real&quot; but the discussion was real.  They&#39;re  <br/>
as real as Lucy Ricardo or Nicholas Nickleby or Hamlet.<br/>
<br/>
The nature of reality is always an interesting topic to me, and I  <br/>
think it&#39;s very important for unschoolers to consider what&#39;s &quot;real&quot;  <br/>
when they&#39;re talking about video games and other media in which kids  <br/>
are involved.<br/>
<br/>
My kids had very early exposure to ideas about what&#39;s real.  Their  <br/>
dad had swords that &quot;weren&#39;t real.&quot;  They had little foam swords that  <br/>
both were and were not real, depending on one&#39;s point of view.   <br/>
Keith&#39;s rattan sword was more &quot;real&quot; than their foam bats.   And  <br/>
Keith has reproduction swords.  Also not &quot;real&quot; meaning not a museum  <br/>
piece 800 year old sword.  Yet all of them &quot;could put your eye out&quot;  <br/>
and that.  But none of it was &quot;violence.&quot;<br/>
