<div id="ygrps-yiv-1778888738">We scrub our vinyl pool weekly, we use it daily. Happiness to me is seeing Tim<br/>
dunk in after cycling home from work. He cycled yesterday. It was 107 in<br/>
Davis. We make a date and the two of us tackle the grime together, getting<br/>
filthy and wet and we too like the clean look of fresh water afterwards.I&#39;ll<br/>
have to hint to the kids how yummy homemade frozen yogurt would taste. Our<br/>
machine is modern and is a joyful experience whenever we make a batch of ice<br/>
cream. I bought our machine for my birthday and picked fresh strawberries too.<br/>

Our air cond. cut out yesterday. We will have it serviced tomorrow. It&#39;s<br/>
staying cool with the windows closed.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-87768891">They do make chlorine tablets and ph kits for vinyl pools; I found ours at<br/>
WalMart. It&#39;s the same stuff as the bigger sizes for regular pools, though,<br/>
and I ended up buying the regular. I would put it in and stir with a long<br/>
net (we had one that was eight feet across) and it kept the changes down to<br/>
a minimum. It was a pain to clean!<br/>
