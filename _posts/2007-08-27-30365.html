<div id="ygrps-yiv-2015099102">I am just reading A.S. Neill&#39;s Summerhill for the first time and he <br/>
makes a big point on distinguishing in his mind Freedom vs. License.  <br/>
He seems to label license as letting the kids do whatever they want <br/>
and freedom as letting them do what they want as long as it does not <br/>
infringe on the rights of others.  He is big on property rights, and <br/>
some of the things he sees as license, I have no problem with.  For <br/>
example,<br/>
<br/>
1.  Painting the door on the house.  I let my kids paint whatever <br/>
they want with washable paints and am open to most suggestions for <br/>
changing the color of things/walls with regular paint.  It is just a <br/>
door, I have no problem with this.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Walking on the table.  I have no problem with this if it is not <br/>
dinnertime and the table loaded with food.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Jumping from a piano to a couch.  Jumping around the house from <br/>
and onto various items of furniture is a common game at our house.  <br/>
If something gets broken, it is just a piece of furniture and can be <br/>
replaced.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess my question is this:  Am I going to far and possibly <br/>
hurting my kids development by not enforcing (or even wanting to <br/>
enforce) more property rights?  Or, possibly this is just another <br/>
example of Neill being ahead of his times on some thinking, but <br/>
behind on others (ie, the use of fines and punishments, sexism, etc.)?<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone have any thoughts on this issue?<br/>

be if you didn&#39;t clarify with your kids that what was acceptable at their <br/>
house, with their furniture etc, may not be acceptable at someone else&#39;s <br/>
place or a public/community property place. The property itself has no <br/>
intrinsic &quot;rights&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There is a great scene in the recent &quot;Yours, Mine and Ours&quot; where one of the <br/>
teenage boys spray paints his side of the ceiling. His roommate (from the <br/>
other family) calls it &quot;vandalism&quot;, he calls it &quot;decorating&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
More later maybe speaking as a renter, but now I&#39;m being called.<br/>

<br/>
A piano isn&#39;t just a piece of furniture.  It&#39;s a musical instrument.   <br/>
I&#39;m guessing you mean from the piano bench to the couch.  There are  <br/>
probably better things to jump from.  Pianos aren&#39;t easily useable  <br/>
without the bench or stool.<br/>

<br/>
If you own the door and you don&#39;t mind washing off what will come off  <br/>
of tempera or whatever (some will stain) then I see no problem, but I  <br/>
think the kids should know very, very clearly that it&#39;s you giving  <br/>
them special permission to paint that one door, not that all doors  <br/>
are for painting or that if anyone else says &quot;no&quot; about having a door  <br/>
painted that they&#39;re unreasonable poots.<br/>
<br/>
-=-2. Walking on the table. I have no problem with this if it is not<br/>

<br/>
The tradition in Western culture, Europe and north America, is NO  <br/>
FEET on dining tables.  Seriously.  Work benches, work tables, coffee  <br/>
tables *maybe* (is it for food or just for looks?), but seriously, to  <br/>
put shoes or feet on a dining table is kinda nasty, along the lines  <br/>
of eating with your left hand in much of Africa and the Middle East.   <br/>
Not good to encourage.  Kids can (and should) understand what&#39;s what  <br/>
and what&#39;s expected and what will gross other people out.<br/>

<br/>
This is where personal taste comes in I think.  We always wash the <br/>
table before eating, so there are no germs, etc. on it.  So &quot;nasty&quot; is <br/>
really just a pre-conditioned notion set by society and/or personal <br/>
preference.  It is not really a factual description of the consequences <br/>
of the actions.  The table is not nasty when it comes time to eat just <br/>
because kids were standing on it two-hours before.<br/>
<br/>
I do agree that it is important to stress that rules are different at <br/>
home vs. other peoples homes.  This I think is the main argument for <br/>
not allowing the sort of leeway I described.  It can be hard for a <br/>
young child to know the difference between home and visiting.<br/>

It&#39;s not about germs.  Those traditions are older than microscopes.<br/>
<br/>
In Africa, you could totally sanitize your hands, but that wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
change the fact that someone had just used an ass-wipe hand to touch  <br/>
communal food.<br/>
<br/>
Modern people are much less likely to have walked in horse plop and  <br/>
pig poo these days than they used to, but the idea of the dirtiness  <br/>
of shoes (and the reality, usually) is still the same.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;s just &quot;peronal taste.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think we limit our children when we don&#39;t let them know what most  <br/>
people expect of them as to etiquette and courtesy.<br/>

<br/>
But where do you draw the line between letting them know what most <br/>
people expect of them as to etiquette and courtesy and forcing them <br/>
into conforming to etiquette and courtesy that you do not believe in <br/>
just so they can fit in at some point in the future?  Do they have to <br/>
say &quot;sorry&quot; or &quot;thank you&quot; when they don&#39;t mean it just to conform to <br/>
common courtesy?  Or is the line somehow drawn at courtesy and <br/>
etiquette in relation to property?  If so, isn&#39;t that valuing property <br/>
over the feelings and experience craving of a child?  <br/>
<br/>
And related to that question, won&#39;t they just figure out what most <br/>
people consider etiquette and courtesy based on their own experiences <br/>
and make their own choice on whether or not to conform?  Isn&#39;t this <br/>
very similar to a child choosing what interests her or not?<br/>
<br/>
My children are little, so I am still working through all this in <br/>
practice and in my head.  The discussion is helpful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When you sit down to eat a meal, the food is on plates, so by your  <br/>
logic, why clean the table at all? Probably just because it is to  <br/>
your personal taste. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Saying it is &quot;just&quot; a notion set by society and personal preference  <br/>
makes it sound like those notions should always be disregarded. But,  <br/>
I do want my kids to be socialized to the extent that they can go  <br/>
places, stay with other people, and be welcome guests.<br/>
<br/>
In case this seems unlikely as a problem - I had a someone here once  <br/>
who did lean back in his chair and put his feet, wearing shoes, up on  <br/>
the dining room table. Seemed rude to me and made me think he didn&#39;t  <br/>
know how to behave courteously. I don&#39;t like people to put their feet  <br/>
up on the couch, either, or other furniture we have in our living  <br/>
room, if their feet are dirty or if they are wearing shoes that  <br/>
they&#39;ve worn outdoors. Our kids are older (my baby is 16) and we have  <br/>
decent furniture, these days. I&#39;m not saying keep kids from playing  <br/>
on the furniture at all, but it is important for them to know when  <br/>
and where it is okay and when and where it is rude.<br/>

unless the kids were wearing shoes in which they&#39;d been running  <br/>
around out in the back yard where the dog poop has not been cleaned  <br/>
up &lt;BEG&gt;. But the fact is that people are going to feel squeamish  <br/>
about it, and it would be a disservice to let kids think that nobody  <br/>
minds about feet or shoes on the dining table.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with that.  If you want your kids to treat your property like that, that is your choice.  But they need to know not to treat other peoples property that way.  When my kids were little they loved jumping on the couch.  We had a really old couch and we let them.  When we got a new couch we didn&#39;t let them jump on it.  We told them that they need to be nice to things so they will last and stay nice.  The old couch had tears in it from jumping.  They were not happy that they couldn&#39;t jump on it, so they earned some money and bought an old couch from the thrift store to put in their play room.  So while I expected them to respect my property, I didn&#39;t just tell them NO, they had other options.<br/>

Letting them know cultural expectations is nothing at all like  <br/>
&quot;forcing them into conforming to etiquette and courtesy that you do  <br/>
not believe in.&quot;  Discussing and explaining isn&#39;t &quot;forcing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To divide the world into black and white doesn&#39;t help a person think  <br/>

and possibilities.<br/>
<br/>
I DO believe in courtesy and etiquette.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have an example of courtesy you don&#39;t believe in?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have a young friend who asked for social assistance from me a few  <br/>
weeks ago.    Since then he has botched two introductions.  I spoke  <br/>
with him about it just yesterday.  One introduction was made  <br/>
awkwardly, so I had no idea what his mother&#39;s name was.  &quot;My mom&quot; was  <br/>
nothing I should be calling her.  Then in another case Holly and I  <br/>
stood by while he talked at length with another mom and daughter at a  <br/>
store.  After they left I asked if he had forgotten the mom&#39;s name.   <br/>
He said no, not at all, and named her.  So I asked why he hadn&#39;t  <br/>
introduced us.<br/>
<br/>
No one has ever explained the purpose or etiquette of introductions  <br/>
to this young man.  He&#39;s 22 years old, and went to school, and has  <br/>
rented an apartment and had several jobs.  He&#39;s handicapped, socially.<br/>
<br/>
So I tried to explain the theory, but he was offended by the idea  <br/>
that first he had to decide which person &quot;ranks.&quot;  He likes to think  <br/>
all people are equal, and refuses any suggestion that he should ever  <br/>
defer to anyone (he didn&#39;t have any idea what the term &quot;deference&quot;  <br/>
even meant, so I said it was like the social right-of-way).  He wants  <br/>
to learn the niceties of social interactions, but after years of  <br/>
saying it was stupid and of feeling himself opposed to authority  <br/>
figures, he has made so much posing noise that he can&#39;t comfortably  <br/>
learn those things.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby, a friend of his (my oldest) has been good at introductions  <br/>
since he was eight or nine.  One day Holly said &quot;I wish I was as good  <br/>
at introducing people as Kirby is,&quot; so I coached her a bit.  Marty&#39;s  <br/>
nervous, but I think he&#39;s picked some technique up from seeing Keith  <br/>
and Kirby and some other adult friends of ours make smooth  <br/>
introductions.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When Jayn was little it was a case of telling her just as we were arriving <br/>
that she couldn&#39;t run, or whatever, here, but not expecting that the words <br/>
alone were sufficient. She needed me to stay with her and head off any <br/>
inappropriate behavior. I also modelled asking the host&#39;s permission if Jayn <br/>
indicated that she wanted to climb or touch.<br/>
<br/>
It was really rare that I took her to places where her usual inclinations <br/>
had to be suppressed much. The most nerve racking place we visited was her <br/>
101 year old aunt&#39;s house who had precious china knick knacks about on low <br/>
surfaces. Instead of twirling and dancing inside, we ended up going outside <br/>
to pick lemons and oranges off the trees instead, and dancing in the <br/>
driveway, which the old lady loved.<br/>
<br/>
Now older, Jayn has become able to take her cue from the host children if <br/>
visiting kids, and also remembering the verbal coaching most of the time.<br/>
However I don&#39;t usually feel the need to destroy her present happiness in <br/>
(for example) walking across the back of the sofa by choosing that moment to <br/>
say, &quot;Most people don&#39;t want you to do this&quot;. It is better to mention <br/>
different behavior expectations on our way to the outing, and also for me <br/>
not to make assumptions about what other people expect. Most of our friends <br/>
are almost as relaxed as we are, some even more so.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could remember any particular moment or age that it became clear <br/>
that Jayn understood that home is one place, and other places are different, <br/>
but I can&#39;t. It seems like she always did, but that may just be one of her <br/>
intelligences. She is really good at asking, either me or someone else (or <br/>
asking me to ask on her behalf).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that is the most useful thing to tell them - just to ask first or at <br/>
least check in with you or the host *before* climbing on to the top of <br/>
someone else&#39;s piano.<br/>

unless their kids are doing it first or you ask their parents.<br/>

some things people do not want to see- like your kid picking their <br/>
nose- it is something they may do in front of you but not in front <br/>

leads to discussions of how other people live when I have to explain<br/>

kids.  I don&#39;t believe it is an issue at all, but would of course<br/>
respect someone else&#39;s contrary view in their home.<br/>
<br/>
I also hate giving thank you notes for gifts, does that count?  Seems<br/>
like the gratitude should be implied and the note is a waste of time<br/>
and paper.  Plus just one more obligation to get done and feel guilty<br/>
if you don&#39;t do it.  I have always thought that it was a silly tradition.<br/>
<br/>
It just seems like kids will pick-up what they need about social<br/>
customs just by interacting in society and some simple discussion by<br/>
us as parents.  I don&#39;t think I need to place any sort of priority on<br/>
social nicities, I have confidence if the kids can learn to read and<br/>
speak, they can learn that people think it is appropriate to make<br/>
introductions and decide what to do with that knowledge on their own. <br/>

like the gratitude should be implied and the note is a waste of time<br/>

  Okay, maybe this is just the eco-weeko in me, but wouldn&#39;t you want to encourage your kids to care for the things in your home, rather than encouraging destruction? To me it would be a sad waste of resources (time, energy, wood, craftmanship, etc.) to okay the destruction of a piano because it&#39;s a piece of furniture (I personally consider it a musical instrument) and can be replaced. <br/>
  When my kids were smaller, jumping on the bed and couch were commonplace, but there was also more delicate furniture that was off limits for jumping on. Even if we could&#39;ve afforded to replace the broken furniture, I wouldn&#39;t want my broken furniture to end up in the already overcrowded landfills.<br/>

isn&#39;t making sense.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re using examples of how your children behave at home as examples  <br/>
of &quot;appropriate behavior&quot; (because it&#39;s okay in your home) and you&#39;re  <br/>
getting answers that say no, that&#39;s not appropriate and kids need to  <br/>
know it isn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Kat used to lie sprawled out on the table the way she would on the  <br/>
floor to eat. I didn&#39;t need to tell her not to do it at other  <br/>
people&#39;s homes or at restaurants because she naturally picked up that  <br/>
it was okay at home and not elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Can a parent depend on a child to naturally pick up the difference  <br/>
between what they can do at home and what they can do elsewhere?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
Does that mean parents need to tell their kids what they need to do?<br/>
<br/>
No.<br/>
<br/>
It means you observe your kids and get to know them and respond to  <br/>
your kids in ways they need. If you pick up that they need some  <br/>
coaching on the differences in rules from one place to the next, or  <br/>
on how to behave in special situations then you coach them. If they  <br/>
seem to get it, then you don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just sensitivity to other people&#39;s (including your children&#39;s)  <br/>
needs to help figure out how to be social beings.<br/>
<br/>
I think what confuses people on the issue of letting kids do what  <br/>
they want is that while kids may want to jump on Aunt Sorcha&#39;s couch,  <br/>
kids also want people to like them. They sometimes need help in  <br/>
meeting both those goals.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-893802154">My parents didn&#39;t entertain much and those that did come over were family or friends.  The rule was pretty much help yourself (to drinks, snacks) and clean up after yourself (dishes in sink or dishwasher).  Fairly casual.  <br/>

But I never really learned the social graces of offering drinks or food when guests (usually still only close family or friends), and since I don&#39;t drink coffee personally and don&#39;t own a coffee maker, even that (offering a cup of coffee, which is the polite thing to do) isn&#39;t something I have.<br/>

Actually, I think the discussion helped me clarify my position.<br/>

I took away from the discussion that everyone has their specific <br/>

<br/>
Property rights and social conventions seemed to be two big <br/>

walk on my dining room table) are irrational. Different, yes. Valid,<br/>
possibly. Irrational, I don&#39;t know, certainly not for me to judge. I see the<br/>
end of this thinking path to be: those who&#39;s sensitivities I see as<br/>
irrational don&#39;t have anything to offer me. When, in fact, I&#39;ve learned the<br/>
most from those who think differently than I. Your children may be set up to<br/>
only enjoy the company of those who think the same way they do, if those who<br/>
think differently are said to be irrational. They&#39;re gonna miss out on a<br/>
whole &#39;nother spectrum of folks with whom they could have great<br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking comes from discussions of differences, not of judging them.<br/>

<br/>
I do think it is important to have tolerance of differences, but that <br/>
does not mean you have to eliminate the discussion on whether or not <br/>
they make any sense.  If a factual discussion leads to the conclusion <br/>
that something is irrational, so be it.  I do try to be aware of my <br/>
irrational prejudices, to reduce my kids exposure to them and to keep <br/>
them out of our discussions.<br/>
<br/>
For example, if someone grabs something from my daughter because they <br/>
don&#39;t think she should have it (say lotion for example), I do not teach <br/>
her that it is rational action and that it is a perfectly fine way to <br/>
act.  I discuss that it was a disrespectful and violent action that was <br/>
irrational.  I also discuss that some people live there lives that way <br/>
and that we have to try to be tolerant of their choices.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter sees my sister spank my nephews, I explain that it is <br/>
irrational, violent and disrespectful, but that is how they live.  We <br/>
don&#39;t criticize the action to them, we just tolerate the behavior and <br/>
use it as an opportunity to teach.  The teaching is a judgment.<br/>
<br/>
I would say that spanking children and grabbing from children are <br/>
commonly accepted in society, but I will not teach my children to <br/>
respect these actions.  Judging in both situations is appropriate in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Society is too afraid to judge.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All three of my kids are pretty high on the interpersonal &quot;pick-it-up  <br/>
naturally&quot; scale. But, even so, I coached them a lot, over the years,  <br/>
on things like how to make someone feel comfortable, how to treat  <br/>
guests in our home, and, yes, how to make introductions. That seems a  <br/>
source of anxiety to a lot of people - maybe they worry that they&#39;ll  <br/>
forget names or insult one or the other by not introducing them  <br/>
correctly. A kind of holdover from when introductions had to be just  <br/>
right - my dad&#39;s parents, my grandparents, were international  <br/>
diplomats, and very very knowledgeable and aware of etiquette rules.  <br/>
My dad was raised with the idea of all that being very important and  <br/>
I absorbed some of that, too. But, we aren&#39;t usually introducing  <br/>
sensitive dignitaries or royalty or even people obsessed with their  <br/>
status, right? So we can let go of all that concern about doing it  <br/>
&quot;right&quot; and just do it nicely.<br/>
<br/>
  Sort of reminds me of the same kind of anxiety people have about  <br/>
doing arithmetic in front of other people (like dividing up a  <br/>
restaurant bill, for example). They feel under pressure, on the spot,  <br/>
they think there is one right exact way, and they go blank and feel  <br/>
awkward.<br/>
<br/>
So, you&#39;re not alone, I don&#39;t think.<br/>
<br/>
These days, there aren&#39;t a lot of formal niceties to worry about -  <br/>
the POINT of manners is usually just to make people comfortable.  <br/>
We&#39;re not usually having to worry about protocol and all that. So, to  <br/>
introduce people, you can usually just be very very casual and say,  <br/>
&quot;Johnny, this is my friend, Jane.&quot; Then, to Jane, &quot;Johnny&#39;s son and  <br/>
mine are friends.&quot; Or whatever little thing seems appropriate. It is  <br/>
nice to say something more than names, because it gives the two  <br/>
people just being introduced something to say next - a little hook  <br/>
for a couple of more pleasantries.  In the above intro, for example,  <br/>
Jane can now say, &quot;Oh, how old is your son?&quot; Or something else that  <br/>
just gets a little conversation going.<br/>

rule like &quot;no jumping on any furniture&quot;, but most of us have things <br/>
that we don&#39;t want our kids to jump on for various reasons.  If <br/>
it&#39;s, say, a piano, is it something that just sits there without <br/>
getting used or is it the most important thing in big sister&#39;s life <br/>
right now?  Is it something with a lot of sentimental value to me, <br/>
so that I might say, &quot;Will you please jump on the couch or bed <br/>
instead? My grandpa gave me that chair specially and I really want <br/>
it to stay nice.&quot;  IRL, I ask my dd not to jump on my bed because <br/>
there&#39;s a ceiling fan directly over it and it&#39;s dangerous to jump <br/>
there.  We have a trampoline, and our couch is old and pretty torn <br/>
up, so it&#39;s fine with me if she jumps on that.<br/>

&gt; and that we have to try to be tolerant of their choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Great example! If a 2.5 year old grabs a toy, it is absolutely<br/>
developmentally appropriate for them to be unable to understand the concept<br/>
of sharing. Doesn&#39;t mean the behavior itself is irrational or somehow<br/>
*wrong.* If it&#39;s a grownup taking something (the lotion they don&#39;t think<br/>
your dd should have), I&#39;m sure in their own mind they have a perfectly<br/>
rational explanation for their actions. Kind? maybe not. Irrational? tough<br/>
call.<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter sees my sister spank my nephews, I explain that it is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; irrational, violent and disrespectful, but that is how they live. We<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t criticize the action to them, we just tolerate the behavior and<br/>
&gt; use it as an opportunity to teach. The teaching is a judgment.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which is probably why I avoid *teaching* of any kind.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>
<br/>
I would say that spanking children and grabbing from children are<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; commonly accepted in society, but I will not teach my children to<br/>
&gt; respect these actions. Judging in both situations is appropriate in my<br/>
&gt; opinion.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Society is too afraid to judge.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Which society to you live in? It cannot be where I am! :D I find judgment<br/>
everywhere I go!!<br/>
Possibly one of the largest, toughest challenges to MySelf has been the<br/>
letting go of my inner judge and accepting the flow of life without judging<br/>
what happens as good/bad/right/wrong... it just IS -- what *I* do in<br/>
situations, how *I* choose to react to those situations is often where the<br/>
self-judging comes in. Choosing something different than the status quo<br/>
around you is just that, a choice. Pointing out to our children that there<br/>
are other, different (kinder, calmer, feel-better) choices available is<br/>
doing more for them than was done for the child who grows up to spank her<br/>
kids.<br/>

rational.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
I got a thank you card from my niece today. She is 20 and moved into  <br/>
her first apartment and I took her a plant. She wrote a thank you  <br/>
note that said:<br/>
<br/>
***<br/>
Dear Aunt Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much for the plant. I put it on the balcony, and it is  <br/>
growing well there. It is in bloom and smells so good.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
<br/>
Love,<br/>
<br/>
Becky<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
I gave the plant to her in person, so I think it was unnecessary to  <br/>
send a thank you card when she already said thank you in person.<br/>
<br/>
My sister, Becky&#39;s mom, always made her kids write thank you cards  <br/>
after birthday parties, etc.. I didn&#39;t like getting them because I  <br/>
could just picture them sitting at the table, wishing they were off  <br/>
playing, while their mom made them write a note to me. I didn&#39;t like  <br/>
them associating me with that. I never made my kids do it. I&#39;m sure  <br/>
my sister thought that was discourteous, but even Miss Manners  <br/>
doesn&#39;t think you ought to send thank you cards if you received the  <br/>
gift in person.<br/>
<br/>
And, now her 20 yo is sending thank you cards on her own because she  <br/>
thinks it is the right thing to do.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll hurt her to send thank you cards and there will  <br/>
be people who will be happy to get them. I&#39;d rather have had a quick  <br/>
phone call, myself, than a formal little card that I just tossed into  <br/>
the recycling box.<br/>
<br/>
Recognition that you&#39;ve received a gift and that you appreciate it is  <br/>
a good thing. I&#39;ve flaked on doing that and felt bad about it.<br/>
<br/>
Sitting kids at a table and forcing thank you cards out of them - not  <br/>
so good.<br/>
<br/>
But there are lots of other ways to help them show their appreciation.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166936805">-=-Property rights and social conventions seemed to be two big<br/>

 &gt; I do feel the need to point out when people are not being rational in<br/>

 &gt; children.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Years ago there was an infamous discussion at unschooling.com, in  <br/>
which a proponent of a parenting philosophy called NCP (non-coercive  <br/>
parenting) assured us all that her children COULD walk on coffee  <br/>
tables, because if they wanted to she would make sure somehow that  <br/>
they were able to do it.  I told her to stay away from my house,  <br/>
then.  That seemed unreasonable to her.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t care.<br/>
<br/>
And honestly, I own two ratty coffee tables, and if her kids came  <br/>
over and wanted to walk on them I would have said &quot;absolutely; go for  <br/>
it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What I would NOT have is someone else telling me what her kids could  <br/>
do in my house with something I owned.<br/>
<br/>
So if &quot;property rights&quot; seem no more than an irrational sensitivity,  <br/>
keep your kids away from my car, my house, my computer, my pets and  <br/>
my yard.<br/>
<br/>
And do I feel like I &quot;own&quot; my pets?  I feed them all they want and  <br/>
they have a door to get out of the house, and the dog and three cats  <br/>
can leave the yard.  Do they?  They&#39;re all nine to eleven years old.   <br/>
They&#39;re here every day (one cat was missing for a few days and showed  <br/>
up sick, but is fine now).   We&#39;re nice to our pets.  We share our  <br/>
house with them in exchange for the things they do for us.  The city  <br/>
of Albuquerque certainly considers them ours, though, and we could be  <br/>
legally or financially liable.   And if anyone from outside our  <br/>
family was abusive to any of them I would turn fiercely protective.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps it&#39;s just a social convention, or perhaps it&#39;s property  <br/>
rights, but it&#39;s not an irrational sensitivity.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626447644">I&#39;m still not getting the focus on things being &quot;irrational.&quot; I agree  <br/>
with you on the rest - violent, disrespectful, not nice, unkind,  <br/>
mean, and on and on....I&#39;m not afraid to judge, obviously &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Meaning of &quot;irrational&quot; - not logical?<br/>
<br/>
So - okay, just thinking out loud, trying to follow your reasoning....<br/>
<br/>
You think it is irrational to not want kids walking on the dining  <br/>
table because there is no logical reason for not letting them do it,  <br/>
right?<br/>
You think it is irrational to hit or grab things from kids because  <br/>
there is no logical reason for it?<br/>
<br/>
So your objection to these things is based on whether there are  <br/>
logical reasons for them, or not?<br/>
<br/>
The problem I see with this line of reasoning is that common  <br/>
courtesies may not seem logical/rational in a narrow context, but  <br/>
they are rational when looked at from a larger perspective of people  <br/>
all getting along happily with each other.<br/>
