&gt; **Protecting children from sitting in the &#39;W position&#39; while playing :-)**<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>O.M.G!!  Seriously!  My daughter sat that way (they called it the butterfly<br/>
sit) a lot, it was pretty much the only way she sat on the floor.  She still<br/>
does it a lot.<br/>
<br/>
**&quot;W-sitting can prevent a child from developing more mature movement<br/>
patterns necessary for higher-level skills.&quot;  ***<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 8 yrs old now, she had no trouble &quot;developing more mature movement<br/>
patterns&quot;.  Geez.  For what higher-level skills?  They seriously think this<br/>
way of sitting is going to disable a child for life?<br/>
<br/>
She used to go to a gymnastics class when she was little and the teacher did<br/>
comment on it, but, only said that not everyone can sit that way because of<br/>
the one muscle, it&#39;s shorter on some people.  She did say something like<br/>
it&#39;s better to mix it up and sit different ways, but, she wasn&#39;t worried<br/>
about it.<br/>

I&#39;m relatively new to unschooling and all the ideas behind it. Sometimes it&#39;s hard for me to distinguish between things that are wrong or right. At the moment I just try to imagine if something will make our family happier or not. If not, then ignore &lt;g&gt; This was obviously something to ignore, other things are not as easy!<br/>

Within the lifetime of my oldest child, the official advice for  <br/>
putting babies down to sleep was they must be put face down or they  <br/>
could DIE of crib death.  Anyone putting a child down another way was  <br/>
so neglectful we can&#39;t even think about it.  And then, no, oh wait....  <br/>
on their sides!  Yes.  That is the only thing that will ensure that  <br/>
they don&#39;t die of crib death.     And then it was on their backs.   <br/>
WHAT!?  SERIOUSLY!?<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who&#39;s the mother of three and was an EMT for a long  <br/>
time, and taught emergency medical aid and first aid for years.  She  <br/>
had been on many calls of crib death, and her theory was that they  <br/>
were over-dressed.  Too hot  many layers of clothes, too wrapped up.<br/>
<br/>
On a lighter note, also in my lifetime, hamburgers have been guilty of  <br/>
causing obesity and death, but every part of the burger has been the  <br/>
villain, and also the savior of Real LIVES, in a process-of- <br/>
elimination-and-restoration rotation.<br/>
<br/>
I think people should take everything with a grain of salt, especially  <br/>
a hamburger.<br/>
