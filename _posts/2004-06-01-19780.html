<div id="ygrps-yiv-581496461">Well, we&#39;re back home.  Canada&#39;s Wonderland was fun, but very, very wet. <br/>
 It was a steady rain all day which left us all with wrinkled fingers <br/>
despite our raincoats.  The girls enjoyed it.  I did, too.  Thank you <br/>
all for your advise.  We all dressed in red tops, although they were <br/>
usually covered by the rain ponchos.  I gave each of the three older <br/>
girls a whistle to wear on their wrist in case they needed to get our <br/>
attention quickly.  They never needed them.  The only problems we had <br/>
were getting in an equal amount of fun time for everyone because it <br/>
turns out Aislinn, the eldest, adores rollar coasters, while Elysia, the <br/>
next oldest, detests them.  Soleille was scared and overwhelmed at <br/>
first, but then was okay as long as she could be with and/or see me.  I <br/>
was the ONLY one allowed to push her stroller.  Leiren, our 18m old, was <br/>
great.  She sat in her little umbrella stroller bundled up in a pink <br/>
raincoat poncho that was about 5 sizes too big for most of the day.  The <br/>
few rides she went on, her face was just kind of blank with wonder. <br/>
 Nobody had much of an appetite, so all we bought for food was a bag of <br/>
chips.  Of course, we had to by a supply of candy bars before we left <br/>
because there&#39;s always some that you can only get in Canada.  Mmmmm, <br/>
 Coffee Crisp Candy Bars!!!<br/>
<br/>
So, I was talking to my mil this morning to thank her for watching our <br/>
dog.  She went on and on about missing those times years ago when you <br/>
could take your kids to an amusement park and just let them go off on <br/>
their own.  Then she went on to plug the Disney Cruise Ships because on <br/>
those there&#39;s babysitters so the parents can go off and be alone. <br/>
 Listening to her makes me feel very sad for my dh.  Her ideal vacation <br/>
has always been to get away from her children.  I can&#39;t imagine missing <br/>
those awesome moments of my children&#39;s lives that will be savored <br/>
memories (hopefully).  To me, that&#39;s way more fun than sitting in a <br/>
beach chair for an hour.  <br/>
<br/>
The girls want to go again next year.  Although, I still think one of <br/>
their favorite parts was jumping on the hotel beds for two hours ;)  One <br/>
of my favorite parts is coming home again.  It&#39;s like taking off your <br/>
fanciest dress after a great party to slip into your most comfortable <br/>
sweats.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you all had a great weekend.  Happy June!   Heidi</div>
