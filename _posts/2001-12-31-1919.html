 </span></blockquote>They don&#39;t really mix with other people either. The same goes for<br/>
school-at-home-types. There were about thirty families in the area I<br/>
lived and we all met up frequently and all were unschoolers. Coming to<br/>
curriculum-land (US) has been a  huge shock. When I say we unschool and<br/>
that the children direct their own learning, pretty much doing what they<br/>
like, even if it three weeks on the Nintendo, they shake their heads<br/>
with horror. I know several women who test frequently in order to make<br/>
sure their kids are &#39;ahead&#39; of the schools.<br/>
Virginia law requires testing once a year (unfortunately). I haven&#39;t<br/>
really thought about what I&#39;ll do if that ever arises but for now the<br/>
education authorities remain ignorant of my presence :)<br/>
Next year we move to New York state which is even more draconian. Sigh.<br/>

That&#39;s kind of what I meant about finding it hard to<br/>
adjust to life over here. I didn&#39;t know one single<br/>
family who did &#39;school at home&#39;, we were all<br/>
unschoolers (there were 25-30 families in my area). I<br/>
miss the comraderie and connections we had there :-(<br/>
We also had a &#39;learning centre&#39; a 5 minute walk from<br/>
our house. Lucy (the person who started and ran it)<br/>
collaborated with Roland Meighan to start it up, it<br/>
was excellent. It was a place where kids could go to<br/>
hang out and there was loads of stuff around for them<br/>
to dip into if they wanted. Lucy also scheduled people<br/>
to come and present specific topics (french, science<br/>
projects/labs, and whatever else there might be an<br/>
interest in). I wish there were enough unschoolers<br/>
around here to start up a similar centre. Sigh. <br/>

We stayed &quot;underground&quot; last year (we came over in Oct<br/>
2000). Luckily, it seems pretty easy and<br/>
straightforward to unschool in California. Good luck.<br/>
