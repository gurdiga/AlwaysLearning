We  leave <br/>
food down for her and the cats all the time.<br/>
<br/>
The vet started  to give the speech about it being bad, I guess, but <br/>
here was this dog  that&#39;s fine and fit. So what she said was she was <br/>
surprised the dog wasn&#39;t  overweight.<br/>
<br/>
Because there&#39;s food down, the dog eats when she&#39;s hungry.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have a cat (around 15 years old) who&#39;s never had a serious lack of food,  <br/>
never starved, never had to compete for food. His mother was with us a few <br/>
years  before he was born in our dining room, and he&#39;s never been outside the  <br/>
house except being carried to the car for vet trips or moving. We leave food  <br/>
down all the time for our cats, too. Sometimes, we get busy and the dish gets  <br/>
emptied (rare)-not daily, maybe once a week-for an hour or a few hours. As soon <br/>
 as that food hits the empty dish (the sound draws all the cats), and the <br/>
humans  have vacated the room, he goes straight to the dish, eats until he&#39;s so <br/>
full  that he barfs it back out again, then proceeds to eat (fresh food from <br/>
the bowl)  until he&#39;s had enough and walks away. Weirdest thing we&#39;ve ever seen. <br/>
We call  him our bulimic cat. I never really thought about it being about <br/>
&quot;perceived  lack&quot; until something clicked when I read what you wrote. It doesn&#39;t <br/>
*seem* like  a serious amount of time to be &quot;lack&quot; or &quot;panic&quot; or some sort of <br/>
mental state  that one would never have enough food again, but apparently, it <br/>
seems that way  to him... Could easily be applied to one&#39;s kids-not <br/>
necessarily lack of food,  per se, but perception. <br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

Whoa...my cat does this too.  (Pardon the &quot;me, too&quot; post.)  And I  made the <br/>
same connection when I read Sandra&#39;s post.<br/>
 <br/>
So yeah, it must be that &quot;perceived lack.&quot;  Unless maybe they&#39;re twins  <br/>
separated at birth. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
