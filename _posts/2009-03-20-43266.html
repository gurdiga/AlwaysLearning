<div id="ygrps-yiv-2051460815">Hello everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This is Debbie Harbeson, the person who wrote to Joyce Fetterol about<br/>
reading which was forwarded to this list for discussion last month.<br/>
<br/>
I want to thank everyone for your responses and the way you helped me<br/>
understand much better how unschoolers think about reading and the<br/>
reading process.<br/>
<br/>
I learned a lot, and it especially helped me realize how much I had<br/>
(unfortunately) &#39;re-absorbed&#39; some old institutional ways of thinking<br/>
about reading when I became involved in that job I had (which I do not<br/>
have any longer.) So thanks, I really appreciate the feedback from<br/>
everyone.<br/>
<br/>
And now I have an invitation to all of you.  <br/>
<br/>
I have a project I am doing for my homeschooling freedom blog<br/>
(http://www.homeschoolingisfreedom.blogspot.com) and would love to have<br/>
anyone on this list participate.  I named it &#39;homeschoolingisfreedom&#39;<br/>
because that&#39;s a main focus for me as to why homeschooling works and my<br/>
goal is to create a place where anyone who is interested can read short<br/>
interviews of lots of homeschooling families answering the questions<br/>
below. I think it could help people understand the benefits of the<br/>
freedom and why it&#39;s so necessary to successful homeschooling.  Perhaps<br/>
it could even be useful if we ever get into a situation where the<br/>
government wants to add regulations.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, I think it could be a great ongoing document, a<br/>
database if you will, demonstrating how individual families make<br/>
positive use of the freedom and flexibility unregulated homeschooling<br/>
allows.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to interview your families.  If you are interested, please<br/>
send me an email to:<br/>
Debbie@...<br/>
<br/>
I hope some of you will be a part of this project. I promise it will be<br/>
fun!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much,<br/>
<br/>

There weren&#39;t any questions.<br/>
<br/>
Do you mean &quot;interviews&quot; or answers to a questionnaire?  (Interviews  <br/>
are cooler; questionnaires can be fun; it&#39;s not the same, though.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1106889357">Interviews would be cooler.  But time is always an issue with<br/>
homeschoolers who are busy with their kids.  I&#39;m happy to do a live<br/>
interview with anyone who might want to do it that way.<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve set this up to be simple and easy and it focuses on three main<br/>
points: freedom, flexibility and fun.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone can easily see what I&#39;m doing by just going to the blog<br/>
(http://www.homeschoolingisfreedom.blogspot.com).<br/>
<br/>
I was trying to shorten my message earlier, but here are the questions:<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
1. How long have you been homeschooling (or if finished, how long did<br/>
you homeschool)?<br/>
<br/>
2. One of the main benefits of homeschooling is the freedom and<br/>
flexibility it allows. Can you give us a few examples of how this<br/>
freedom and flexibility benefited you (your family)?<br/>
<br/>
3. Another benefit of homeschooling is the fun factor. Can you give us a<br/>
few examples of some especially fun times you had as a result of<br/>
homeschooling?<br/>
<br/>
4. We all have funny experiences while homeschooling. Can you share one<br/>
of yours with us?<br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
People have been having a great time with it.  I think it&#39;s great to<br/>
include the kids of course and some families have chosen to do that.<br/>
Some people send in a picture of an activity they might have done or<br/>
just a fun family picture.  If anyone has a blog or website they want me<br/>
to link to, I&#39;m happy to do that as well.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you have any other questions and I hope to see some<br/>
responses soon!  I can only imagine the many different answers to the<br/>
questions that would come from folks on this list.<br/>
<br/>
You can email me at the address I&#39;m listed on here or at<br/>
