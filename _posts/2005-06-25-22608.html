<div id="ygrps-yiv-1031825326">Warning: This is LONG..... And anyway, everyone on this list has <br/>
probably heard this a million times.  I am just journaling this out, <br/>
so if you find yourself getting weary, there&#39;s always that delete <br/>
button.  <br/>
<br/>
In a nutshell -- it&#39;s on the no-spank issue.<br/>
<br/>
I have not posted much at all, have lurked on this list for several <br/>
months gathering info for dh and me about unschooling among other <br/>
things.  It&#39;s the only thing I want to do for my children&#39;s <br/>
schooling, and as long as they&#39;re happy with it, that&#39;s great.  My <br/>
personality fits it to a T.  In the meantime, we (me & dh) strive to <br/>
unload our baggage.  Ds is not quite 2 and I have one on the way.  <br/>
As far as formal whatevers with the so called powersthatbe, we have <br/>
some time to play with.  As far as anything else goes... well we <br/>
have some time to play with as comes with the territory, but as you <br/>
have said, Sandra ... on your huge fun site ... as fast as we can <br/>
process our baggage is as fast as we should go.  I agree.  I hope <br/>
that Chenzo (short for Vincenzo) will benefit.<br/>
<br/>
So here I am reading the new links you announced for your website, <br/>
and getting caught up in your no spank pages ....emailing dh (poor <br/>
guy) repeatedly with commentaries on your articles.  This is not the <br/>
first time I&#39;ve been on your site.  I&#39;ve visited and lurked there <br/>
for 2 or 3 years now, ever since I found I was going to have <br/>
Chenzo.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a story about talking back, a painful reminder of my own <br/>
childhood, in an article on Lying (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/s/lying)">http://sandradodd.com/s/lying)</a> -- <br/>
and the punishment a child may expect as a result.  I concur with <br/>
the author&#39;s comment.  I, too, didn&#39;t understand what was meant <br/>
by &quot;talking back.&quot;  For me this was a double whammy because I have <br/>
profound hearing loss.  Naturally I misunderstand LOTS of things.  I <br/>
learned to keep my mouth shut so as not to rake up hellfires.  I <br/>
ALWAYS lied when my parents insisted on explanations for my <br/>
behavior.  I learned I was ALWAYS wrong (insert sarcasm from me <br/>
there) because for one thing the comment often came my way that <br/>
nobody asked me to &quot;think&quot; (sarcasm I got from a parent).  In hopes <br/>
of dodging the tongue lashing often followed by other punishments, I <br/>
hedged and tried not to commit to anything.  Last but not least, I <br/>
tried to avoid losing family affection.  But this is a permanent <br/>
fixture of the strained &quot;I love you&#39;s,&quot; mostly referring to times of <br/>
relative peace (with my relatives of course).  I learned that in <br/>
such a family I couldn&#39;t win and often wondered what I was doing <br/>
there.  This is all very bitter of course.  What else?<br/>
<br/>
I say relative peace, because as a no-spank parent, well ... I am <br/>
far from being at peace.  I know that love is real even in such <br/>
circumstances.  That&#39;s good information to have and a relief to my <br/>
soul.  But now I also know love loses it&#39;s flavor when it&#39;s based on <br/>
conformity and self-protection.  What there is to bridge such a gap <br/>
with is a mystery to me.  Once again, I am compelled to keep my <br/>
mouth shut, love being a curse to conformity.  <br/>
<br/>
We (me and dh) find ourselves unceremoniously and quietly putting on <br/>
the shelf family members we can&#39;t leave ds with.  This is an ongoing <br/>
diplomatic process that is resulting in a silent stalemate.  And it <br/>
leaves our burgeoning family out of the context of a larger extended <br/>
family, Chenzo included.  We had hoped to keep the channels open <br/>
without finding ourselves in open &quot;war.&quot;  If only we could stave it <br/>
off long enough, maybe somebody would come around.  We showed up for <br/>
Christmas, Thanksgiving and occasional Mother/Father&#39;s Day and <br/>
assorted birthday celebrations.  And we often came home stung by <br/>
words we did nothing to invite.  <br/>
<br/>
So dh has sworn off the loyalty parade.  I can&#39;t say I blame him.  <br/>
Of course I would dearly love to discuss these issues calmly within <br/>
and outside family circles but I know better.  There are those who <br/>
adamantly disagree with no-spank and other of my views, and there <br/>
are others who only half disagree but want for the sake of family <br/>
peace to defend those who speak against... won&#39;t hear of... my so <br/>
called vain philosophies.  So there we sit outside the &quot;circle of <br/>
trust&quot; and like the Fockers, can&#39;t decide if we&#39;re f**ck&#39;d or if we <br/>
should get some &quot;Fockerization&quot; going on (watch &quot;Meet the Focker&#39;s&quot; <br/>
if you don&#39;t know what I mean-- it&#39;s hiLARious).  Anyway, it looks <br/>
like open &quot;war&quot; is upon us, at least from that quarter --my side of <br/>
the family.<br/>
<br/>
We (me and dh) have found ourselves at the same fork in the road <br/>
over and over and over.  It&#39;s exciting in a way, that we are where <br/>
we are, cleaving to one another and forsaking all others-- isn&#39;t <br/>
that idea the most romanticalest (sorry, another word merge)?  We&#39;re <br/>
like Alice in Wonderland in surreality (probably not a real word <br/>
either but that&#39;s where we&#39;re at).  I am torn between being without <br/>
extended family support altogether or being lectured at about the <br/>
nonexistent dangers of NOT spanking, not formally &quot;schooly&quot; training <br/>
our children up.  <br/>
<br/>
I now see ultimately that golden quiet (be it 180 from peaceful) is <br/>
better than having discussions or loud flaming disagreements.  <br/>
Nobody can tell anybody anything anyway.  For each person and at <br/>
every moment, yes, there is potential for epiphany.  And so we <br/>
struggle with personal baggage and that&#39;s certainly work enough.  <br/>
Golden quiet means relief from the need to convince others of my no-<br/>
spank or other points of view.  After all, I&#39;m every bit <br/>
as &quot;enculturated&quot; as the next person though I diligently wrestle <br/>
free of it.  I did not coin that word -enculturated- but it <br/>
describes perfectly what we are going through.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of culture, as I ramble onward to dh&#39;s side of the family: <br/>
what culture this is that we&#39;re making, I don&#39;t know, but it looks <br/>
to be pretty interesting.  Cenzo is not obedient.  I&#39;m very happy <br/>
about that.  He&#39;s quite independent in more and more ways than ever <br/>
before.  I actually welcome this.  (Bravo me!)  Cenzo is actively <br/>
trying to make sense of his spanked cousins behavior.  Of course it <br/>
makes no sense.  They hit and loudly say &quot;NO!&quot;  Cenzo does the <br/>
same.  Haha.....  yeah, that&#39;s a no-brainer.  I can&#39;t help but see <br/>
that there&#39;s no need to hit any child but the oldest, since spanking <br/>
works it&#39;s way to the youngest in unbroken chain from child to child <br/>
(and from child to pet or object when no person is available), a <br/>
transfer of violence downward through the ages.  I am ambivalent for <br/>
Chenzo because though he loves his cousins, he rightly does not <br/>
trust them.  <br/>
<br/>
I am leaving my sil&#39;s house 4th of July weekend when dh comes to <br/>
take me home.  Whew.  Can hardly wait to get out of here.  Our visit <br/>
has been quite an eye-opener: ie., spanking is contagious and I need <br/>
to get away from it.  I have swatted Cenzo on about 3 or 4 occasions <br/>
and been impatient in my dealings with him several times since being <br/>
here.  I forgive myself but now that I know the danger of <br/>
associating with spankers, I can more easily guard against it.  I&#39;m <br/>
not strong enough yet.  I am sad for the people we leave because <br/>
there is NOTHING to be done for them from my standpoint without <br/>
brooking interference in my own affairs ... no thank you of course.  <br/>
That&#39;s the family on dh&#39;s side.  And yes.  I am writing this on <br/>
THEIR computer.  :-/<br/>
<br/>
So here we are without support from extended family.  What to do, <br/>
what to do?  As a telecourse professor said &quot;Get you a rabbi!&quot;  He <br/>
was referring to getting a &quot;study buddy&quot; to cram for tests.  There <br/>
is no test, of course, but we want to learn as much as possible <br/>
about... well anything we like and to have a happy life.  So <br/>
the &quot;rabbi&quot; we&#39;re consulting and conspiring with is the internet, <br/>
and that will have to do for support and family at the moment.<br/>

intend to treat me this way in the future, you&#39;ll have to do it from a <br/>
distance, because I don&#39;t want to (drive/fly however long/far) just to be abused.   <br/>
I say &quot;it&#39;s no longer okay&quot; but really it was never okay.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what might be worth saying, but *in writing* and keep a copy, so they <br/>
can&#39;t claim you said anything different.<br/>
<br/>
-=-those who speak against... won&#39;t hear of... my so<br/>

<br/>
They still don&#39;t want you to think.   They still think they can keep you from <br/>
thinking by pressure, words, attitude.   What real benefit will there be to <br/>
your son if you accept their attempted thought-control?   What will break the <br/>
cycle if he learns to smile and lie and say &quot;I love you&quot; to people who turn <br/>
around and smack him (verbally or emotionally, if not physically)?<br/>

<br/>
Pretty romantisational.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Arm yourself gradually with research and articles and experiences.   Don&#39;t <br/>
argue with them, give them books to read.   Say &quot;If you want to discuss this <br/>
after you&#39;ve read this, let me know.&quot;    That means &quot;READ IT OR SHUT UP,&quot; but it <br/>
doesn&#39;t quite *sound* that way.    It means &quot;Until you&#39;ve read this, you&#39;re <br/>
unqualified to have an opinion on it,&quot; but don&#39;t say it that way.<br/>
<br/>
If they ask how long you&#39;re going to coddle him, say &quot;while he needs it,&quot; and <br/>
if they ask how long you&#39;re going to homeschool, say &quot;as long as it&#39;s working <br/>
out well for us.&quot;   US.   Not them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I am torn between being without<br/>
extended family support altogether or being lectured at about the<br/>
nonexistent dangers of NOT spanking, not formally &quot;schooly&quot; training<br/>

<br/>
Are you going to get the lectures either way?<br/>
Could you turn it around and start mock-lecturing them about what they should <br/>
be doing with their lives until they tell you to stop it, and then say &quot;Oh.   <br/>
I learned from your behavior that adults are supposed to tell other adults to <br/>
live their lives differently.   I&#39;ll stop if you&#39;ll stop.&quot;   (I guess that <br/>
one&#39;s just a fantasy, but the others aren&#39;t.)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
When my mother-in-law (who was a nurse) was irritatingly critical about our <br/>
decision not to circumcise, I loaned her three books with sticky-notes on the <br/>
appropriate passages.   She took them to read, brought them back the next day <br/>
(they had been RV-camping nearby), set them very NICELY on a table, and said <br/>
that things had changed since she went to nursing school.<br/>
<br/>
When it came to homeschooling, I offered to lend her the books we read before <br/>
we made our decision, and she declined. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=- Cenzo is not obedient.  I&#39;m very happy about that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s not being ordered around, though, how would you know?<br/>
If you say &quot;Stop!&quot; a the side of a road or a river, would he stop?<br/>
If your mom says &quot;Don&#39;t climb up on my coffeetable, does he do it anyway?   I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t think that would be something to be happy about.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Cenzo is actively<br/>
trying to make sense of his spanked cousins behavior.  Of course it<br/>
makes no sense.  They hit and loudly say &quot;NO!&quot;  Cenzo does the<br/>
same. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve broken off friendships with others just because they spanked.   I told a <br/>
family once they could NOT spank their child in my house, when they <br/>
threatened.   I don&#39;t want my kids to have to see it; it&#39;s just too disturbing. <br/>
<br/>

associating with spankers, I can more easily guard against it.  I&#39;m<br/>
not strong enough yet.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I used to get hyper vigilant about my kids&#39; behavior when I was in a place <br/>
where the others were over-controlling their own kids and being irritated that <br/>
mine were there.   I really wanted mine to just not make waves, don&#39;t rock the <br/>
boat, and I&#39;d be sharp and impatient in those instances, but they always <br/>
understood during the debrief in the car afterward (or wherever) why I was nervous <br/>
in such situations.   <br/>
<br/>
When you let Cenzo do something the other kids aren&#39;t allowed to do, you <br/>
really mess that family&#39;s dynamics up.   You make them more skittish and nervous <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Staying at ANYone&#39;s house can be stressful after a few days, I think, even if <br/>
your parenting is the very same.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe in the future you could plan to try to get together in public places <br/>
designed for kids to have fun and be loud.   Those have been the best times with <br/>
my husband&#39;s parents, when we&#39;re at the children&#39;s museum or miniature golf <br/>
places.   In our house they&#39;re critical and uncomfortable, and at their house <br/>
we&#39;re stifled.<br/>
<br/>

news and to admit frustrations.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
Hey Sandra.  I had this nice point by point reply going and the <br/>
internet gulped it... isn&#39;t that typical?  <br/>
<br/>
I guess it was a bit disingenious to say it&#39;s a &quot;visit&quot;  to my sil <br/>
considering that me and dh temporarily separated.  We had a lot of <br/>
new experiences on top of old hurts and anger to sift though, and so <br/>
here I&#39;ve been for over 2 months *pant, pant, gasp, augh* ... a very <br/>
long visit indeed.  (Did I tell you I&#39;m going home July 4th <br/>
weekend... yeah!!!  We&#39;re thrilled.)  <br/>
<br/>
There has been conflict in sil&#39;s mind over my lack of schedule, our <br/>
parenting differences [which emphasizes the unfairness to the <br/>
cousins who get spanked, corrected, disrespected, talked to, NOT <br/>
listened to, monitored at bedtimes (dusk) and mealtimes (everything <br/>
on their plates gone) ... none which I would ever do with Chenzo, <br/>
who&#39;s not quite 2 years old yet anyway].  I&#39;m a very bad example to <br/>
her children who are well routinized.  We sleep downstairs in the <br/>
basement, another floor entirely but the cousins can&#39;t help but <br/>
notice we wake up late some days and early other days.  I guess it <br/>
is disrespectful of me not to protect her children from seeing that <br/>
there is a different way-- brainwashing gone awry.  This is not <br/>
intentional on my part --just the way I am-- but I have wished many <br/>
a time that I had somewhere else to go, for ALL our sakes.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re stifled, yes, but -needless to say- this is the last time I&#39;ll <br/>
be staying here for this type of &quot;visit.&quot;  I have a friend who has <br/>
an old dog (15 years old) she doesn&#39;t want to put down even though <br/>
she would love to have me there.  I almost went.  She and I are of <br/>
similar minds about most things&gt;  But her dog is old and sick and <br/>
hates to be left out, and it would be a very unpleasant extremely <br/>
stressful life not to mention cruel to listen to a crying dog shut <br/>
off from us in another room during his indefinite last days.  This <br/>
poor dog is a biter and I couldn&#39;t guarantee Chenzo wouldn&#39;t get <br/>
hurt since he&#39;s not even 2 years old yet.</div>
