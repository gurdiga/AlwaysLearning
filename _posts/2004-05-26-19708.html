<div id="ygrps-yiv-831222628">OK I know I&#39;m late on this thread but I didn&#39;t see this one mentioned.<br/>
Thoroughly Modern Milly----with the great Julie Andrews.<br/>
It&#39;s a great musical, a good example of the older genre with well written<br/>
music, well performed and a wonderful story that takes place during the<br/>
flapper era in the 20&#39;s.  It&#39;s rated G (though someone says the B word at<br/>
some point I think) And its now playing live in LA if some of your wealthier<br/>
students (do you have any?) wanted to go see it live.  I heard it was a nice<br/>
production.<br/>
