<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811884941">&lt;&lt;It makes me seem like a bad guy.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Right when I read this I thought, &quot;That is EXACTLY how I have felt the past <br/>
year or so with our local Unschooling Tribe.&quot;  A few weeks ago, I handed <br/>
over the &#39;complete operation&#39; to Sylvia & Beth because I kept &#39;feeling&#39; that <br/>
even though we are run as a democracy, that ultimately if people were not <br/>
&#39;happy&#39; with the tribe / left  / whatever, that the brunt of unhappiness <br/>
turned to me in emails, etc.  For me, the best choice was to &#39;step away&#39; <br/>
because I knew that I had amazing woman who could take over the next phase <br/>
on our tribe&#39;s journey.  I&#39;m grateful.  So anyway, I can relate with what <br/>
Sandra wrote - sometimes it&#39;s gets yucky being the so-called bad guy all the <br/>
time.  Especially when as a Radical Unschooler, I am striving for peace, <br/>
kindness, and an overall joy / zest for life.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;It may make you feel like a bad guy but I don&#39;t think it makes you seem <br/>
like a bad guy.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I differ with this thought because I experienced otherwise.  Even if 99% <br/>
(insert clause of pretend statistic here) of a list, tribe, group, etc. want <br/>
something run a certain way, that still leaves the hypothetical 1% who your <br/>
possibly gonna get a nasty email from.  It&#39;s tiring on the soul to be called <br/>
the ultimate bad guy and the crappiest Radical Unschooler on the earth.<br/>
<br/>

*Who knows she not a bad guy but sometimes wanted to be one and send <br/>
something really nasty back.  I think the best nasty email I got was one <br/>
that said, &quot;YOUR A BUNCH OF FREAKS AND DESERVE EACH OTHER!&quot;  &lt;bg&gt;  I love my <br/>
freaky tribe!</div>
