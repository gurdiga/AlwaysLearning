<div id="ygrps-yiv-329359723">When my oldest was about 3, we lived in a neighborhood in which all the<br/>
streets had &quot;Park&quot; in them...Park Valley, Willow Park, Memorial Parkway,<br/>
etc..  Often confusing even for adults new to the area.<br/>
<br/>
We were out for a walk one day and run across a kid about 5 on a bike,<br/>
bawling his head off in a panic.  It was his first day at a new babysitter&#39;s<br/>
home and he had gone out to ride his bike, turned the corner when he had<br/>
been told not to and couldn&#39;t find the street again.  About the time we<br/>
stopped, a lady in a van stopped to help as well.  Neither of us knew each<br/>
other or the kid so we didn&#39;t feel comfortable letting the other leave with<br/>
the kid.  Finally, we all piled into the van, stroller and all and drove<br/>
around the neighborhood looking for something that looked familiar to the<br/>
little boy.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, the kid calmed down enough to answer questions and we discovered<br/>
his older sister was in 2nd grade at the local elementary school.  We called<br/>
up there, talked to the sister who could tell us where the parents worked<br/>
and we were able to get in touch with them.  The parents told us how to get<br/>
to the babysitter&#39;s who was also in a panic searching for the kid.  I like<br/>
to think one of the parents quit work to stay home with the kids after that.<br/>
