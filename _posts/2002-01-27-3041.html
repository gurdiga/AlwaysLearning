<div id="ygrps-yiv-665248590">I think Joyce is right on. Leave the discussion over there.<br/>
Kathy,<br/>
I guess everyone has clarified, I just wanted to explain for myself though....<br/>
I think doing what&#39;s best for your family is a great idea!<br/>
I was balking at people coming for advice in the unschooling context, that <br/>
were doing things/having ideas directly in conflict with unschooling and <br/>
being told to&quot;just do whatever works for you&quot;<br/>
If Sandra, Joyce, Mary and others had done that to me, I would still be <br/>
limiting certain things in my childrens lives that I have now let go of. This <br/>
has led to greater joy and growth in our home and I would just hope that <br/>
anyone seeking information would be given good information. Not just a <br/>
friendly pat on the back, YK?<br/>
Sorry it wasn&#39;t clear.<br/>
<br/>
Dianna, glad another Mum has lousy handwriting...it seems everyone I know has <br/>
some form of pretty writing. I&#39;m bad at calligraphy too!! haha<br/>
My dh is good at it. I do the artwork, he does the calligraphy when I have a <br/>
project that requires it.<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s good to hear from a Dad. Welcome Nanci K.&#39;s dh!!<br/>
