<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026683662">I belong to the California Homeschooling List and I&#39;ve been following this<br/>
article with interest.  For those that don&#39;t live in CA I thought you might<br/>
like to read about something that&#39;s happening there to a homeschooling<br/>
family.  For those of us currently living in Arizona, we could feel grateful<br/>
we are not subjected to the same laws.....Dawn<br/>

Here is today&#39;s ACTION ITEM:<br/>
<br/>
ISSUE: Today&#39;s item is a little long, but we hope you&#39;ll<br/>
<br/>
see why the detail was necessary. Conservatives across<br/>
<br/>
America are needed right NOW to stand up for educational<br/>
<br/>
choice. According to WorldNetDaily.com and the California<br/>
<br/>
Homeschool Network(www.californiahomeschool.net), the right<br/>
<br/>
of parents in California to direct the education of their<br/>
<br/>
own children is being called into question by school<br/>
<br/>
officials acting above the law. It&#39;s time for us to take<br/>
<br/>
action.<br/>
<br/>
Facing a possible jail sentence for &quot;contributing to the<br/>
<br/>
delinquency of a minor,&quot; California homeschooling mom Sandra<br/>
<br/>
Sorensen claims the San Juan Unified School District and<br/>
<br/>
Carmichael Elementary School have been harassing her and<br/>
<br/>
her family since they withdrew their son from the &quot;unhealthy<br/>
<br/>
environment&quot; of the government-run school system. According<br/>
<br/>
to Sorensen, Carmichael principal Deborah Kraus made numerous<br/>
<br/>
threats in person and over the telephone to her since the<br/>
<br/>
January decision.<br/>
<br/>
After discovering that their son&#39;s teacher was allowing<br/>
<br/>
students to write suspension notices for other students,<br/>
<br/>
the Sorensen family of Sacramento decided to homeschool<br/>
<br/>
their 10-year-old son. They researched the California laws<br/>
<br/>
regarding homeschooling, and followed them to the letter.<br/>
<br/>
Then the phone calls from the school started. School<br/>
<br/>
officials that should know better told the Sorensens that<br/>
<br/>
homeschooling is illegal, that one must have a credential<br/>
<br/>
to homeschool, and that proposed coursework must be<br/>
<br/>
submitted for approval. They began demanding tons of<br/>
<br/>
documentation of their home school -- requests for<br/>
<br/>
documentation that are not supported by California education<br/>
<br/>
code. Officials accused Sorensen of neglect, reporting her<br/>
<br/>
to California child welfare authorities, and began plans to<br/>
<br/>
prosecute her in the Sacramento County courts. By this time<br/>
<br/>
the Sorensens were in touch with CHN and were well aware of<br/>
<br/>
the requirements of the California Education Code. They knew<br/>
<br/>
they had complied with the letter of the law -- could school<br/>
<br/>
officials really require more than the law requires?<br/>
<br/>
Now school officials have taken the law into their own hands<br/>
<br/>
and accused the Sorensen child of truancy. They are citing<br/>
<br/>
&quot;unexcused absences&quot;, which were in fact after his parents<br/>
<br/>
had officially notified them under the law that they had<br/>
<br/>
withdrawn him from public school. The Education Code does not<br/>
<br/>
grant the local school any authority over private (home)<br/>
<br/>
schools or their students. But this has not prevented Joseph<br/>
<br/>
Tucker, of the Student Attendance Review Board (SARB), from<br/>
<br/>
calling a SARB hearing.<br/>
<br/>
ACTION ITEM: Mr. Tucker, apparently with the blessing of<br/>
<br/>
Principal Deborah Kraus, has made it known to the family that<br/>
<br/>
this would all &quot;go away&quot; if they would just enroll their son<br/>
<br/>
in the government-run school system. In other words, he is<br/>
<br/>
abusing the power of his position to intimidate this mom and<br/>
<br/>
dad into following HIS choice for their child&#39;s education<br/>
<br/>
instead of their own. Conservatives and limited-government<br/>
<br/>
advocates across the country need to stand with this family and<br/>
<br/>
say to these educational bureaucrats: &quot;Enough!&quot; CLICK BELOW to<br/>
<br/>
quickly contact Tucker, Kraus, and the entire School Board and<br/>
<br/>
demand that they stop this assault on parental rights:<br/>

They&#39;re not in California either. That&#39;s part of the problem.  Except for a <br/>
little thing that says parents educating only their own children at home <br/>
don&#39;t have to be fingerprinted, there isn&#39;t homeschooling there.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico, homeschooling is defined and there&#39;s a letter of intent, which <br/>
you have 30 days to file.  So the first 30 days are free if you then send in <br/>
your letter of &quot;intent to establish a homeschool&quot; (which is a form to fill <br/>
out).  During the 30 days you can say &quot;We are going to homeschool,&quot; and the <br/>
school can&#39;t say &quot;truant.&quot;  The letter doesn&#39;t go to the school, it goes to <br/>
the state. (Used to go to the district, which in Albuquerque is such a big <br/>
entity that the school might never be notified anyway.)<br/>
<br/>
So legally we&#39;re better off here than Californians are.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying the school personnel aren&#39;t being butts; they are.  And ha<br/>
rrassment is illegal even if the kid were enrolled.   <br/>
<br/>
But as to &quot;legally homeschooling,&quot; that itself might be hard to prove.  <br/>
They&#39;ll win, but win what?  It puts the spotlight on laws and lack thereof <br/>
which some Californians would rather have left alone, maybe.<br/>

We don&#39;t really have any yet, except filing with the county stating you are hs&#39;ing your kids (shhh - haven&#39;t done that yet!) But there is a bill in the legislature right now (HB 2440) trying to make hs&#39;ers have regular testing. I sure hope it fails. :-/<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434365122">This is a fairly unusual problem in California -- we have the occasional <br/>
school official or DA (usually filing charges in response to a custody<br/>
problem) getting hysterical. The inclusive California group, HSC (CHN is a<br/>
Christian group, as you might guess from the HSLDA reference later in the<br/>
article) and their legal folks are working with the family&#39;s attorney (who<br/>
is experienced in working on homeschooling cases) on this case and<br/>
recommends NOT sending letters to the school officials, etc., as it tends to<br/>
muddy rather than help (and as I understand it, the request below is old,<br/>
and CHN has also at this point stopped asking for letters to be sent).<br/>
<br/>
I expect we&#39;ll see an update sometime soon that the matter has been settled,<br/>
as happened in three cases in Alameda county last year once HSC got involved<br/>
and the DAs were all brought to their senses.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, California is a simple place to homeschool, though we have no<br/>
&quot;homeschooling law&quot;. I would hate to see what a homeschooling law here might<br/>
look like. :/<br/>

&quot;homeschooling&quot; - legally, we&#39;re lumped in with all of the private<br/>
schools in the state, so if the legislature wanted to make a new law to<br/>
hassle us (like requiring testing, or portfolioes, or whatever), they&#39;d<br/>
have to fight not only the homeschoolers but all the private schoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Arizona used to require testing of homeschoolers, and I would not be at<br/>
all surprised if they did so again, especially since a lot of the<br/>
Christian homeschoolers would be for it. When we first lived in Arizona,<br/>
no one I knew even registered, because the penalty for not registering<br/>
was a $50 fine and then you had to register. Big whoopie. <br/>
