<div id="ygrps-yiv-11708004">Hi all -<br/>
I think I&#39;m coming in the middle of this thread but what Nanci and Pam struck <br/>
me...<br/>
<br/>
My middle child (son) is a homebody and always has been....when he was <br/>
younger I was into the &quot;Mom&#39;s Club&#39; and all it&#39;s fieldtrips and <br/>
playdates....really, almost every day we had &#39;plans&#39;....<br/>
<br/>
one time when he was 3, he screamed and cried about not wanting to go to the <br/>
open gym at the gymnastics facility - a really fun place....we went but could <br/>
not get in bec. it was full.....<br/>
<br/>
that day was one in a series of  big a-has for me....I should have listened <br/>
to him....we should not have gone....(luckily, dd was indifferent).....maybe <br/>
he knew it wouldn&#39;t work out...??....<br/>
<br/>
becoming more aware of his needs to stay home made me more aware of my &#39;need&#39; <br/>
to go out......what was THAT all about?.....his refusal to make it easy for <br/>
me to go on in my &#39;escapism&#39; and delusion helped lead me to a place of being <br/>
comfortable with quiet, being &#39;alone&#39; (with 3 kids!), and being HOME.....(I <br/>
had always been a traveller and a go-er and a volunteer - I was afraid of <br/>
being out of the loop)......<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, he was a daily prompt to take things easier and STAY HOME....to <br/>
enjoy being home and to find stuff to do here at home....like bake bread, <br/>
make soup, garden, de-clutter, paint, take more care in household duties, <br/>
etc....(like do laundry with an appreciation and a smile bec. it&#39;s not rushed)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps some would have labelled him &#39;difficult&#39; - and I did too bec. that <br/>
kind of internal change can be difficult - but now I honestly consider him an <br/>
angel for REQUIRING me to take a turn in my path.....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the prompt in this thread.....I&#39;m feeling a lot of love for that <br/>
kid, right now....<br/>
