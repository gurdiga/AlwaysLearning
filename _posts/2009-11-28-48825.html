<div id="ygrps-yiv-474853255">Six weeks from now there will be something in Santa Fe that&#39;s never  <br/>
happened before--a symposium on longterm unschooling.   Attendees who  <br/>
reserve a condo soon will have a one bedroom with a fireplace for $79  <br/>
a night (plus tax), or a two bedroom for $99, or a three bedroom  <br/>
(there&#39;s only one left) for $149 per night.  Each condo has a dining  <br/>
room and living room, a couch someone could sleep on, many of them  <br/>
nice fold-outs.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re furnishing firewood and kindling.  I was out cutting mint stalks  <br/>
this morning to tie into little bundles for kindling.<br/>
<br/>
Because there are condos left and the time for the discount to expire  <br/>
is fast approaching (end of November), if anyone wants to speculate on  <br/>
a room now is the time.  It&#39;s possible that a reserved room at  <br/>
discount rate could be transferred to someone who hasn&#39;t yet decided,  <br/>
or who gets a trip for Christmas or something. :-)<br/>
<br/>
A cancellation might cost one night&#39;s rent, but that would be a  <br/>
donation to the conference, in a way, if anyone wants to take such a  <br/>
risk that they won&#39;t end up going and no one will pick up the room.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to reserve a condo for relatives or friends to come and  <br/>
hang out with you, that&#39;s fine now too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really excited about the fact that all of Joyce&#39;s family will be  <br/>
there, and all of Pam&#39;s and all of mine.  I don&#39;t figure that will  <br/>
happen again, ever.<br/>
<br/>
To reserve condos:<br/>

or if you reserve directly with Fort Marcy and they give you the  <br/>
conference rate, let me know if you&#39;re wanting to transfer that to  <br/>
someone else later.<br/>
<br/>
The schedule is here:<br/>

(Pam, do you have a name for your session yet?)<br/>
I don&#39;t worry about what exactly Pam or Joyce will say.  It will be  <br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m speaking first about what we&#39;ve learned in the past many years  <br/>
about unschooling, and at the end will talk about what we&#39;ve learned  <br/>
in those past three days.   There will be a session of the teens and  <br/>
young adults, and there will be a dads only session.   Six sessions,  <br/>
three evening gatherings, lots of visiting time, and fireplaces.   <br/>
Peace and big ideas.<br/>
