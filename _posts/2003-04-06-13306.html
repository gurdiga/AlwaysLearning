Nah!)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that the schooled mindset seems to be MUCH more ingrained in <br/>
PARENTS. My friends who have no children really GET unschooling and are VERY <br/>
supportive---even the &quot;educators&quot;. It&#39;s as if the DAY you have a child---  <br/>
&quot;education&quot; becomes all-important. Like they can&#39;t see any further than a <br/>
good school (and we all know how they sell houses! &lt;g&gt;)!<br/>
<br/>
How weird is THAT?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry for those two children. And glad Julian has you!<br/>
