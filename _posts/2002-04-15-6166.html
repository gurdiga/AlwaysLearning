 </span></blockquote>Hi all -<br/>
Thanks, Sharon of the Swamp, for your words.....I feel the same way.....&quot;not <br/>
doing&quot; is a choice I make specifically and repeatedly.....I also try to make <br/>
the conscious choice to &quot;not do for my kids&quot;  (when I think, &quot;I should take <br/>
them to ...&quot;  I try to stop) .....I do not try to &#39;provide&#39; opportunities, <br/>
books, educational stuffs, etc.....In fact, I&#39;m getting rid of my collection <br/>
of such materials.....I am trying  to respond to dks.....mostly I think <br/>
responding/treating them with lovingkindness is the best thing I can do for <br/>
them.....well, I don&#39;t really know that except that it is healing to me.....<br/>
<br/>
Some people value collecting books/libraries and having shelves of <br/>
&#39;materials&#39;....I don&#39;t.....I like to read books and then send them away.....I <br/>
don&#39;t like &#39;educational stuff&#39; like microscopes and math manipulatives.....if <br/>
it becomes appropriate for our family to get something, we try to....NOT bec. <br/>
we are trying to teach something but bec. ds wants to use a microscope just <br/>
like he&#39;d like more characters for his &#39;doll collection&#39; or more Pokemon <br/>
cards....<br/>
<br/>
I DO think that NOT DOING is a BIG part of unschooling.......and can be the <br/>
most &#39;educational&#39; part..... : )<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought or two.....<br/>

How can you do that? it&#39;s like sending away my friends!!!!<br/>
Hey, send them my way, I&#39;ll never make them feel unwanted. &lt;snif&gt; poor<br/>
little books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-54964566">oops. I must have misrepresented myself.  I have lots<br/>
of books. And lots of stuff and materials. A good part<br/>
of this is on shelves. Sometimes. I don&#39;t like to get<br/>
rid of books.  I even experience pain when returning<br/>
library books......<br/>
<br/>
To me, Not Doing is NOT DOING....for a while....sort<br/>
of like looking at the negative light, for while, to<br/>
see the different patterns. Not a permanent, all the<br/>
time thing.  I DO lots, too. <br/>
