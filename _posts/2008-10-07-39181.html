animal movies (Bambi every day for months! Lion King, 101 Dalmations,  <br/>
etc.), but the both of us *loved* &quot;Enchanted.&quot;  We particularly  <br/>
enjoyed the one little girl sitting -- or rather, standing -- behind  <br/>
us, in a theater otherwise full of older adults, who was so absorbed  <br/>
in the story she started talking to the screen, warning the princess  <br/>
to not eat the apple!  To the grown-ups, it was a comedy/parody, but  <br/>
to this little girl, it was still a princess movie :-)<br/>

I love when that happens.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago we went to a production of Little Shop of Horrors at Menaul  <br/>
High School.  They have an OLD gymnasium, 80 or 100 years old.  It  <br/>
was only half full or so, and I had taken lots of kids and we met up  <br/>
with others.  The back row was Kirby and Marty and other friends, so  <br/>
they had a good view of the thing that  happened.   A friend named  <br/>
Megan was young--fiveish--and sitting with me and Holly in the third  <br/>
or fourth row back, or so.   She didn&#39;t know the story.   When Mr.  <br/>
Mushnik leaned over to give the plant some water, Megan sat up  <br/>
sharply and said (to the actor, that loudly) &quot;NO!  DON&#39;T!&quot; and it did  <br/>
add greatly to the performance.  &quot;Mr. Mushnik&quot; paused, and looked at  <br/>
Megan thoughtfully and then went back to watering the plant with a  <br/>
posture that said &quot;Going to do it anyway.&quot;  It was SO COOL that a  <br/>
teenaged amateur actor in a high school show was able to incorporate  <br/>
that unexpected outburst into what he was doing.<br/>
