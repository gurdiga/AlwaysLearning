<div id="ygrps-yiv-983524199">My mom recently told me that my SIL read that certain hormones are more active when sleep occurs during early morning hours.  In other words, that early to bed, early to rise is healthier than getting enough sleep but at the wrong hours.  Someone reassure me that my kids aren&#39;t doomed because they go to sleep at 10 or 11 pm and wake up between 8 and 10 am!<br/>

hours just before RISING. And everyone has a &quot;rising&quot; unless they&#39;re <br/>
comatose.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, at 6:30/7:00 I&#39;m considered an early riser! &lt;G&gt; Around <br/>
UNschoolers, that&#39;s comparable to waking up at MIDNIGHT! &lt;BWG&gt;<br/>

up late.  Usually 11:00 or 12:00.  This morning we woke at around 10:00 I saw <br/>
the boys (8 and 5 years old) starting to move around.  I said &quot;let&#39;s get up <br/>
and get moving&quot;.  My oldest said &quot;why&quot;.  I though then said &quot;no reason&quot; and <br/>
we went back to sleep for about 30 minutes more.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1680453849">ROTFLMAO! Kelly this was just too funny! Recently I&#39;ve been getting up<br/>
at 7- 7:30 AM. I&#39;m quite amazed. Maybe it will change back with summer.<br/>
    Ds17 sleep till 2-3pm since he&#39;s up til 3am on a pretty regular bases.<br/>
Makes it hard when we leave for snowboarding at 9am once a week. He had a<br/>
white out(snow blindness?) yesterday. The only thing we can figure is that<br/>
he hadn&#39;t had enough sleep. He does get up to go but he hasn&#39;t been able to<br/>
get to sleep before 3am.<br/>
