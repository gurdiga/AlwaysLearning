<div id="ygrps-yiv-239956396">Another mom mentioned this as a cute thing her 2.5 year old son says:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My bed is sad because it doesn&#39;t want me to sleep in it. It wants me<br/>
to sleep in Mommy & Daddy&#39;s bed!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder how many other things children say to express their desires<br/>
that gets written off as &quot;cute&quot; and then dismissed...<br/>
<br/>
Which is why I give my kids the benefit of the doubt when they tell me<br/>
&quot;my tummy hurts.&quot; They might mean something different, like &quot;I&#39;m<br/>
hungry&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m tired,&quot; so I try to watch and see what they need, vs.<br/>
just &quot;You&#39;re fine, eat your food&quot; or something worse that I&#39;ve seen<br/>
others do. <br/>
<br/>
I can remember at least two instances where my mom did not understand<br/>
why I was screaming, and both times I had significant physical<br/>
injuries (well, not ER type injuries, but enough that a scream wasn&#39;t<br/>
an expected reaction.)<br/>
<br/>
But it hurt that she first accused me of being loud instead of trying<br/>
to discover what actually happened.<br/>

subtle, yet still disrespectful.  It&#39;s traditional parenting all the<br/>
way.  For some reason traditional parenting causes parents to ignore<br/>
their basic parenting instincts.  It&#39;s this huge layer of stuff that<br/>
gets inbetween a parent and child relationship that is really so basic<br/>
in nature.<br/>
<br/>
Treating children with respect and really listening, from that early<br/>
age, is what I see that directly leads to teens that are respectful and<br/>
kind and really great!</div>

<br/>
Today I was in a store and a woman had a child in the cart, maybe 3 years<br/>
old.  The child was crying and the mom in a sing song voice said to him,<br/>
&quot;Are you having a melt down?&quot;  I was so saddened.  I guess I shelter myself<br/>
enough in general that I don&#39;t hear that type of outright disrespect very<br/>
frequently.  I hear the more subtle type and see all the ignoring that goes<br/>
on but not that.  And I see it more with teens since I have a teen and a<br/>
pre-teen.  I can&#39;t imagine not listening to my children.<br/>

Maybe she thought she was &quot;acknowledging his feelings&quot; or  <br/>
communicating peacefully with him.  She might feel it was a better  <br/>
choice than threatening to hit him, or just hit him, or yell at him,  <br/>
and it was better than those.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the recommended scripts over the years have been things that  <br/>
seemed to be more like training for the mom than ANY benefit to the  <br/>
child.  Maybe I&#39;m wrong, but when a mom says &quot;I think you&#39;re angry,&quot;  <br/>
I&#39;d hate to be the kid, especially if &quot;NO SHIT, EINSTEIN!&quot; (or maybe  <br/>
&quot;y&#39;think so, Freud!?&quot;) wasn&#39;t an appropriate kid response.<br/>
<br/>
When one of my kids was angry I didn&#39;t tell him so.  I might say &quot;If  <br/>
you&#39;re too angry to deal with it, maybe walk around a bit to get the  <br/>
adrenaline down.&quot;  Something practical.   Not a yah/duh &quot;You seem to  <br/>
be angry.&quot;  Help or get out of the way, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1518238229">Yeh I&#39;ve tried talking about feelings and found it to be pretty much<br/>
ridiculous ineffective and unhelpful.  I&#39;m glad I ran into Raising Our<br/>
Children Raising Ourselves (with the emphasis on raising ourselves, for me<br/>
anyway).<br/>
<br/>
Kids are so direct and I agree with a lot that Naomi says about that and<br/>
also not telling kids what they feel.  If I ask Karl is he mad (because<br/>
sometimes there seems to be more going on) he has been known to say that<br/>
he&#39;s *not* mad but SAD and other things like &quot;no! I&#39;m fine.&quot; very calmly,<br/>
when I mistake excitement and maybe a need for food as anger or<br/>
aggravation.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not that hard for some people (me!) to misread feelings.  Heck I<br/>
know I&#39;m not Einstein.  ;)  But there are ways to get around that problem.<br/>
If you&#39;re not fluent in body language or kid-ese, Naomi&#39;s book might be a<br/>
good start at becoming fluent.  Well and for that matter so are the<br/>
unschooling lists and Sandra and Joyce&#39;s websites.  If you don&#39;t know, you<br/>
can find out.  Yay!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If I said something like that (I&#39;m quoting myself), they could say  <br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not really angry, I&#39;m just frustrated&quot; or something.  It&#39;s not a  <br/>
guaranteed read.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m clearly frustrated and someone &quot;soothingly&quot; says I seem to be  <br/>
frustrated, I breathe and work on not saying &quot;You seem to be an  <br/>
idiot,&quot; though.  In my experience &quot;Can I help?&quot; isn&#39;t a bad response  <br/>
to someone&#39;s frustration or anger.  If they say no, at least you  <br/>
offered.  If they burst into tears or give you a task, that&#39;s better  <br/>
than nothing, usually.  If someone offers to help, I can say &quot;No, but  <br/>
thanks&quot; and it reminds me that my fury or frustration isn&#39;t helping  <br/>
others around me.<br/>

the cart around lazily saying &quot;Oh, you&#39;re OK...&quot;  I almost cried.<br/>
