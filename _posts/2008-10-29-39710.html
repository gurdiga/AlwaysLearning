<div id="ygrps-yiv-81386978">Our unschooling journey began as a reaction.  It began as a reaction<br/>
to a horrible public school experience.  That was years ago.  Our<br/>
journey has evolved into something entirely natural now.<br/>
<br/>
My question is, for those who had a child in the PS system and began<br/>
homeschooling because of it.  Have you noticed residual effects?  I<br/>
notice that Skylar, 10, still has emotional issues tied to school,<br/>
some he doesn&#39;t realize, some really bother him.  <br/>
<br/>
He was emotionally beat down and I&#39;m wondering if that will always be<br/>
there?  Will he always be bothered by how many times he was sent to<br/>
the principals office?  Or publicly embarrassed by a teacher?  I<br/>
wonder at what age he might begin to be able to see unschooling for<br/>
what it is.  I guess that&#39;s a matter of &quot;when he is ready&quot;.  But will<br/>
he see it when he has children?  Or will he see it as a teenager?<br/>
<br/>
I realize that my questions may not be expressed well, and that they<br/>
may not be answered.  But it&#39;s something I&#39;m a little concerned about<br/>
and wondering how it&#39;s worked out for others.  Thanks.</div>

<br/>
&quot;Unschooling for what it is&quot; is problematical.  It&#39;s not for my kids  <br/>
what it might&#39;ve been for me.  Kirby said &quot;I have no basis for  <br/>
comparison&quot; when someone asked him if he liked it better than school  <br/>
once.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of polluting the present with your concerns about the past  <br/>
and the future, how about reminding yourself that many very happy  <br/>
todays are the best bet for balancing out emotional beat-down.   Let  <br/>
that go.  Don&#39;t let the embarrassment affect you today.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since starting over isn&#39;t an option for you, maybe instead of  <br/>
comparing the vector you foresee (or that you want us to help you see  <br/>
more clearly) to him as a hypothetical school-free boy, how about  <br/>
looking at what he has with unschooling compared to what he would  <br/>
have if he were still in school?<br/>
<br/>
Then you&#39;ll feel more confident, I think.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-939464897">Just wondering whether this question is about the child&#39;s residual<br/>
effects or about the parent wanting confirmation that they&#39;ve done the<br/>
right thing to &quot;fix&quot; the problem?  Don&#39;t take that personally, please,<br/>
I just thought it might be an interesting side-note to this issue,<br/>
because I have wondered, in regards to my thirteen year old, who has<br/>
never been to school but who knows lots of school kids, whether she<br/>
&quot;gets&quot; unschooling.  She isn&#39;t interested in talking about it at all,<br/>
and she doesn&#39;t identify herself that way.  It bothered me, until I<br/>
realized my issue was to some degree more about whether she would<br/>
feel, later, that I made good choices for her by choosing unschooling<br/>
over a schoolish way of life.  I think I wanted some sort of<br/>
validation from her, which is totally not fair.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s an excerpt from Dragonfly&#39;s blog.  You are not alone.  It doesn&#39;t<br/>
necessarily answer your question, but apparently this is true for other<br/>
kids too.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well, we are coming up on six years of homeschooling. The girls are 16<br/>
and 14. And do you know what? We are still seeing the effects of that<br/>
time they spent in school. Chloe is an instinctive mathematician who<br/>
before school used to beg us to give her story problems to do. Then came<br/>
the awful day when she came home from school and announced that she<br/>
hated math. She is only now getting over her resistance to &quot;formal&quot; math<br/>
(as opposed to real life math, which she does all the time).<br/>
<br/>
As you might imagine, my strongest advice to you as parents of young<br/>
children is &quot;Don&#39;t send your kids to school.&quot; Any school, public or<br/>
private, can lead to the kind of damage we&#39;ve seen in our kids. We<br/>
thought trying school would be a harmless experiment, something we could<br/>
change our minds about if needed, but we did lasting harm to our kids&#39;<br/>
curiosity and natural joy in learning.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The post is mostly about convincing someone to NOT send their kids to<br/>
school and it has some local stuff at the bottom.  I know she wrote<br/>
&quot;homeschooling&quot; in there, but they are a family who unschool and<br/>
Dragonfly&#39;s been writing on various message boards for a while.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Neither of my girls have been to school, so I&#39;m not really the best one<br/>
to answer this.  I see kids all around me that are school damaged.  I<br/>
see kids that survive in spite of school and parents.  I see kids that<br/>
are crushed by school and family and I wonder if they will survive.  It<br/>
can be mind numbing if I think about it too much.<br/>
<br/>
What helps is to look at how wonderful and awesome my kids are and let<br/>
that other stuff fade into the background.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you could view this as any other kind of life altering event,<br/>
know that it will always be there somewhere, but it doesn&#39;t have to be<br/>
the focus of living.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I see adults all around me, some my age and some younger, and older,  <br/>
with scars from school.<br/>
<br/>
I could examine them minutely and get all depressed, or I could turn  <br/>
the other way and come back online and help people learn to be sweet,  <br/>
peaceful parents.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My mother was damaged by school.<br/>
<br/>
My dad was crushed by school.<br/>
<br/>
They both tried to help me so that school didn&#39;t crush me.<br/>
<br/>
I did what I could do for my kids, too.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m working on the assumption that moving toward viable, rich  <br/>
unschooling and finding ways to nurture our kids is the goal of  <br/>
everyone here.   Nobody grows up without any regrets at all, as far  <br/>
as I know.  The best we can do is to make more peaceful choices.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah totally.  That is problematical. It&#39;s interesting how as a parent<br/>
unschooling is &quot;something&quot;, but as a child it&#39;s organic in nature.  So<br/>
yeah, he may never see it as I do.  I&#39;m not hoping he will either.  So<br/>
that&#39;s good. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, polluting seems a little strong of a word.  It was a curiosity<br/>
for other&#39;s experiences that brought me here.  It surely doesn&#39;t<br/>
pollute the present.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then you&#39;ll feel more confident, I think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My confidence is less and issue than his.  I&#39;m not wishing his<br/>
experiences were different.  My confidence in unschooling is on stable<br/>
ground.  His wavers a little.  He still has thoughts of needing to<br/>
&quot;measure up&quot; to some invisible standard.  But we help with those as<br/>
they come.  <br/>
<br/>
I think I should have remembered before I posted that one&#39;s previous<br/>
experiences shape who they are today.  That his experiences may affect<br/>
him negatively today, but may affect him positively tomorrow.  i maybe<br/>
should look to my own life and the decisions I&#39;ve made despite some<br/>
emotional baggage.  <br/>
<br/>
Love it when I answer my own questions.</div>

certainly not about confirmation.  In no way am I trying to fix him. <br/>
He is who he is who he is.  :-)<br/>
<br/>

This is something though.  I have secretly wondered in the past why he<br/>
wasn&#39;t as proud to be an unschooler as I was!  But it&#39;s obvious<br/>
really.  He&#39;s young and unsure of a lot of things in his life, never<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One thing that really helps kids, and reluctant spouses, are<br/>
conferences.  When a kid is young and unsure, then meets a whole bunch<br/>
of other kids, doing what they are doing, it&#39;s very life affirming! <br/>
There is something about knowing your not alone, unschoolers are very<br/>
much the minority, so it can feel that way sometimes!<br/>
<br/>
Both of my girls have really enjoyed going to the conferences that we&#39;ve<br/>
been to.  Each time, it&#39;s been eye opening for both of them.</div>
