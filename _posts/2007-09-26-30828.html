<div id="ygrps-yiv-781498070">I just wanted to share my recent experiences with math & my 7 yo son...since the topic came up...<br/>
   <br/>
  We are visiting my parents in India & ds Nishay, figured out (listening to adult conversation, I suppose), the exchange rate - one $ is 40 rupees. The other day, he asked me how much something cost & I said 1000 rupees. About 30 sec or less later he said - $25 - not too bad...<br/>
  Then today we were out & there was a toy we were contemplating buying. He asked me how much it cost  - 30 rupees....I could almost hear the wheels in his head! He said - oh - 75 cents. <br/>
   <br/>
  He keeps doing it too - every day.....<br/>
   <br/>
  I couldn&#39;t help but have a really silly grin on my face! I love it!<br/>

This is interesting all by itself, but even more, for me, because I  <br/>
just put up a blog post that leads to an article about Holly, when  <br/>
she was young and we visited England, and I had mentioned she  <br/>
understood the money better than I did. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

There&#39;s a mystery photo there, too, and some encouragement of people  <br/>
to be more easily amused.<br/>
<br/>
That is NOT, by the way, the classic mentality of an educator.  In  <br/>
the absence of a test, nothing is trivia!<br/>
