Int&#39;l school students, dropouts get university break<br/>

International school graduates as well as some 110,000 Japanese students who <br/>
drop out of high school annually will soon be qualified to sit for university <br/>
entrance examinations, officials said Tuesday.<br/>
<br/>
Previously, under a directive of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, <br/>
Science and Technology, only high school graduates, those who finish primary <br/>
and secondary education abroad, and those who pass special qualification <br/>
tests are able to apply to universities.<br/>
<br/>
Therefore, high school dropouts and those who graduate from international <br/>
schools and Korean high schools in Japan are not qualified for universities.<br/>
<br/>
But officials of the Education Ministry have now decided to alter the <br/>
directive to the effect that anyone over 18 years old is able to enter <br/>
universities when they are deemed qualified by each university&#39;s own <br/>
screening.<br/>
<br/>
The new directive that allows almost anyone over 18 years old to sit for <br/>
university entrance examinations will apparently come into effect from the <br/>
next school year.<br/>
<br/>
Up until now, because of the old directive, hundreds of international school <br/>
graduates, some 1,000 Korean high school graduates and 110,000 Japanese high <br/>
school dropouts have had to pass special qualification tests before applying <br/>
to universities in Japan.<br/>
<br/>
The change in directive is good news especially for high school dropouts <br/>
because it will drastically clear them from the burden of the special <br/>
qualification tests.<br/>
<br/>
The qualification tests have required most high school dropouts to pass paper <br/>
tests in some 10 subjects such as mathematics, Japanese and English.<br/>
<br/>
Private and local government-run universities have already begun admitting <br/>
international school graduates, but state-run universities have required them <br/>
to pass qualification tests first. (Mainichi Shimbun, July 2, 2002)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1722009331">Why the change, I wonder?  Is enrollment in universities down and they&#39;re<br/>
looking to boost it or have there been legal problems or what?   Very<br/>
interesting.  <br/>
<br/>
Noemi, do you know more about this?  <br/>
