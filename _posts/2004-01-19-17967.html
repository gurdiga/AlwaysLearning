<div id="ygrps-yiv-42298029">I do not.  I do sometimes suggest to Lexie she not read something for a <br/>
bit, like I&#39;ve asked her not to read holocaust books (of which we have a <br/>
great deal, as it&#39;s a subject I&#39;m interested in) and she&#39;s agreed.  I <br/>
guess we try to have a relationship of trust, I trust her and she trusts <br/>
me and so when I say &quot;I don&#39;t think this is a good idea, when you are <br/>
older we can read those&quot; she trusts that. <br/>

beforehand and read every book. What a complaete pain! She also had a verbal list <br/>
of what my 11 yo daughter was not allowed to &#39;discuss&#39; with her 11 yo <br/>
daughter, completely failing to appreciate that girls need to talk to their own age <br/>
group about &#39;stuff&#39; like periods etc etc. The friendship nearly ended over this <br/>
as Heather would be so anxious about what she could and could not say to her <br/>
friend.<br/>
Gawd knows what she was afraid of.<br/>
<br/>
I used to try and joke about it by asking her to ask her daghter not to talk <br/>
to Heather about fashion and malls which I detest.<br/>
Personally I think the more you censor the more attractive the censored thing <br/>
becomes. You are also destroying trust between yourself and your child as <br/>
well as telling your child that they do not have the ability to decide what is <br/>
best for them. Hence adults who contsantly turn to &#39;experts&#39; or peer groups to <br/>
make their minds up for them.<br/>

want to.<br/>
<br/>
 I do find myself getting a little apprehensive on occasion when getting <br/>
together with other families if I don&#39;t know them very well and I am not sure what <br/>
level of life they are on, LOL. I just made that up cause I don&#39;t know how <br/>
else to say it, we talk about a lot of things here so I never know what will <br/>
come up that may be too adult for some kids. I think my kids are pretty good at <br/>
assessing any situation and adjusting their interactions as needed but <br/>
sometimes with older kids I worry my kids might assume too much, well, I mean they may <br/>
not always realize that we are living on a different level than mainstream <br/>
USA and they are not above the occassional colorful word.<br/>
<br/>
LOL, now that I think about it I too have to stop and think now and then as I <br/>
am so used to talking to my own kids that I sometimes forget that not all <br/>
kids are as used to having in depth conversations with adults, this is probably <br/>
coming out all wrong so I hope ya&#39;ll can hear what I&#39;m trying to say. I don&#39;t <br/>
mean it to sound high fallutin (Is that how you spell it) I liken it to the <br/>
gradual process we went through when we started listening to books on tape, as <br/>
our listening ability developed we were able to follow more complex books, I <br/>
think the same thing happens with the conversations we have with each other and <br/>
our families. A &quot;What did you do in school today&quot; conversation is far different <br/>
from discussing the problems inherent in compulsory education, a conversation <br/>
which we recently had. I think I will stop here to see if I am making sense <br/>
to anyone, I know what I mean but it may sound like gibberish to you, LOL.<br/>

set up it looks like the most efficient way to control what children are exposed <br/>
to en masse. It goes well hand in hand with age segregated schooling, we <br/>
don&#39;t have to know anything about any particular child at a certain age we can <br/>
just make judgments across the board as being &quot;good&quot; or &quot;not good&quot; for kids of a <br/>
certain age. And I&#39;m sure if serves it&#39;s purpose for anyone not prepared to <br/>
question it&#39;s reliability. However, when we take the time to know our kids, to <br/>
talk and discuss whatever comes along with them then we are more in tune with <br/>
life and so are they. <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I drive my 16yro nuts listening to his music with him in the <br/>
car. I am always asking &quot;what is he/she saying&quot; and &quot;what does he/she mean by <br/>
it?&quot; Since we know each other so well I find him censoring me, LOLOL<br/>

We used to censor heavily, then as we let go of the<br/>

<br/>
Right now my 14yo is listening to Rammstein, I think<br/>
that is the group&#39;s name (everything is in German so I<br/>
don&#39;t have any idea what they are singing about).  She<br/>
was reading To Kill a Mockingbird but decided she<br/>
didn&#39;t like it (broke my heart but I kept my mouth<br/>
shut).<br/>
<br/>
My 12yo is reading Kenshin graphic novels right now<br/>
(and begging me to buy more!).  <br/>
<br/>
My 5yo refuses to watch anything that isn&#39;t animated,<br/>
and loves Pokemon, and he has me reading Magic Tree<br/>
House books to him that he found on our shelves the<br/>
other day.<br/>
<br/>
Believe it or not, not one of them has become a porn<br/>
addict or junkie or taken up drinking and smoking<br/>
because of the rules being gone.  Amazing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434092135">I would never censor my child&#39;s reading.  When my oldest was little, before I <br/>
was an unschooler, I use to read most of the books she read so that we could <br/>
discuss them.  I tend to enjoy reading childrens literature so this was just <br/>
something I naturally did.  With five children, 3 of whom read a lot, this just <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be practical.<br/>
<br/>
I was just discussing this question with Emily (who is reading over my <br/>
shoulder), and she was rather shocked.  For one thing, she says, most of the books <br/>
in the teen section at our library are watered down &quot;pop&quot; stuff.  *Note* she <br/>
enjoys these a lot, but she said she felt that someone&#39;s reading ability could <br/>
be stifled if they weren&#39;t allowed to read novels from the adult section.  She <br/>
also noted that as far as things like explicit sex and violence (which I <br/>
assume is what the censoring mother is worried about?) go, the books in the teen <br/>
section are not censored by the librarians.  Books go into the teen section <br/>
because someone feels that the books will particularly appeal to teens.  You will <br/>
find plenty of sex and violence in these books.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO I think that it&#39;s more important that children are comfortable talking <br/>
with their parents about anything.  Then censoring doesn&#39;t seem to be much of <br/>
an issue.  I wonder if some parents think there is a *magic* age at which it&#39;s <br/>
OK for children to read whatever they want.  This seems rather humorous to me. <br/>
 I&#39;m imagining an 18yo running to the adult section of the library and <br/>
pulling down lots of books to check out hoping to find out what secrets are in <br/>
them.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heh. That is so true. Number of people in VA thought that somehow their kids <br/>
would become drug taking swearing porn addicts if they even associated with my <br/>
uncensored kids!<br/>
Despite my lack of rigid control my kids can be pleasant and polite and will <br/>
often censor themselves. (They do swear in temper however but you can&#39;t have <br/>
everything!)<br/>
They&#39;ve played GTA:Vice City and haven&#39;t wanted to go out and run people over <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
Personally I think that the more control you try and execrcise, the more it <br/>
will backfire when they are finally free. A controlled girl I know has been <br/>
overheard saying that she will read bad things, kiss loads of boys and go wild <br/>
when she reaches 18. Maybe she wont but she obviously resents the parental <br/>
strictures and while she is loving that is a line of bricks in any potential wall <br/>
between her and her parents. I&#39;m sure they would be mortified if they realised <br/>
this.<br/>
<br/>
Hows the weather over there in VA? Still numbingly cold?<br/>

choices.  And, of course, she can read any book that can be found, <br/>
locally as well as through inter-library loan.  <br/>
<br/>
She recently rejected Eragon, couldn&#39;t finish it, said it was boring, <br/>
too much a male&#39;s point of view, but loves Melanie Rawn and is <br/>
writing her own fantasy novel, from more of a woman&#39;s point of view.  <br/>
Favorite novels she read this past year include The Cider House Rules <br/>
and Les Miserables, among many others.  <br/>
<br/>
Favorite music groups include many international groups, in Russian, <br/>
Japanese, Italian and Finnish.  And then she loves Josh Groban, too, <br/>
plays the songs he sings on the piano and is choreographing a skating <br/>
program to one of his songs for her next exhibition.  She likes some <br/>
rap and some ghetto music, but not all.  And she likes jazz, too, is <br/>
buying tickets to a jazz concert for her boy/friend&#39;s birthday next <br/>
weekend.  And he is composing a piece for her to skate to for the <br/>
upcoming exhibition, too.  <br/>
<br/>
No censorship here at all. <br/>

Mom had me terrified of boys when I was a kid, (I think mostly I was just <br/>
terrified of her and not the boys) I would get so worried when boys would some over <br/>
to play at my friends house and this was when we were just kids. Kind of <br/>
ironic that I grew up and had 6 boys.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123575647">Jane,<br/>
This is just my opinion, and I do not expect people to change their minds to <br/>
my way of thinking. But since you asked;)<br/>
<br/>
I do censor what my children read, to an extent. Here is why. I do this for <br/>
the same reasons that I censor what they watch. I do not allow them to watch <br/>
movies where people are having sex, or running around naked. <br/>
My daughters are 11 and 14.<br/>
I watched Matrix Reloaded, which they wanted to see. There was one scene <br/>
Where Keanu and the woman were having sex. They can&#39;t watch it. I just think that <br/>
(my opinion only) those types of things are inappropriate for my daughters. I <br/>
love horror movies. They are my favorite, but I will not allow them to watch <br/>
most of them because of the sex. The same thing goes for books.<br/>
My favorite books are by Stephen King and Anne Rice. There are sex &quot;scenes&quot; <br/>
in books as well.  Romance novels (like from Harlequin) have parts that are <br/>
pretty much porn. They do not need that kind of information at their ages, in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
I do not just say &quot;NO!&quot; I read the entire book, or watch the entire movie, <br/>
first. Then I make an informed decision.<br/>
<br/>
At their ages, I no longer worry about the violence in movies. They have been <br/>
raised away from such stuff as much as possible, so that is not a factor for <br/>
my daughters. They know it isn&#39;t real, they know it isn&#39;t okay, they can watch <br/>
it. So far, there have only been two movies, without sex, that I have not let <br/>
them watch, and both had explicit pictures of murdered children that I found <br/>
very disturbing. One was a Jack Nicholson movie, and the other was a <br/>
documentary (2 part), Paradise lost, about a true case.<br/>
<br/>
My sister, though, puts no such limits on my nephew (9 years) about even <br/>
violence, and he has watched Matrix Reloaded. So every parent is different I guess.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

Subject: censorship<br/>
<br/>
  I have a friend that&#39;s an unschooler that censors her childs reading.<br/>
Today she said her 13 year old is only &quot;allowed&quot; to read childrens and teen<br/>
books - mainly when it comes to novels. I&#39;ve never felt the need to censor<br/>
my boys reading.  I&#39;m not sure what she&#39;s trying to protect her from and<br/>
wasn&#39;t in the mood to debate it  but now I can&#39;t stop thinking about it. One<br/>
of my boys does read a lot of very grown up stuff and seems fine with it. We<br/>
talk a lot about all kinds of things that he has read about. Do you censor<br/>
your kids reading? Why or why not? Do you think it&#39;s dangerous to censor?<br/>
<br/>
  Thanks, Jane :)<br/>

Stated that way, it&#39;s a rule that I would definitely never put onto *my* kids <br/>

I don&#39;t think every parent is different.  That would suggest that all of the <br/>

If the question is about cause and effect, it will help all those reading for <br/>

<br/>
When I was growing up (public school in the &#39;60s) some of my friends had been <br/>
told NOTHING about sexuality.   Starting their periods was a surprise to <br/>
them.  They had no idea what to expect from boys.   Some &quot;got in trouble&quot; (and it <br/>
was trouble even if they didn&#39;t get pregnant, if they no idea what all that <br/>
could lead to legally, emotionally, physically).  <br/>
<br/>
Today&#39;s modern version of that is abstinence, and &#39;just say no.&quot;  No to <br/>
EVERYthing?  &quot;Just&quot; say no with no information about what they&#39;re saying no to?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
We went to see Matrix Reloaded.  My boys are 6 and 9.  We saw the first one <br/>
and really liked it.  My boys liked the action in the second one but on the <br/>
whole thought is was a very confusing movie, me too.  LOL.  As for the sex scene <br/>
they really didn&#39;t think much of it.  My youngest said it was too boring and <br/>
it was a good time for a potty break.  They both love action movies.  <br/>
<br/>
For the most part they are very good at censoring themselves.  They know what <br/>
they do and do not like.  Sometimes if I know a movie might have a scary part <br/>
I will tell them so they are prepared ahead of time.  My oldest hates scary <br/>
movies, he is nine.  He will choose to not watch or when it starts to get scary <br/>
he will leave the room for a few minutes.  They think of sex scenes as <br/>
boring.  It isn&#39;t what they want to watch and will generally go play with LEGOs or <br/>
something, it has no interest for them.  Now when the action comes back on they <br/>
want to watch.  <br/>
<br/>
They also don&#39;t like a lot of violence that is &quot;real&quot; looking.  They loved <br/>
LOTR.  Again thought some of the slower non-action parts were a little boring, <br/>
especially my youngest, he is six.  They didn&#39;t like The Patriot.  To them it <br/>
was too real and too bloody.  They left the room and played on their computers <br/>
during that one.  <br/>
<br/>
They are good at censoring for themselves.  And I am sure their tastes will <br/>
change over the years.<br/>

things. I hold to my feelings, and they hold to theirs.<br/>

1. It is geared towards older teens/adults I guess.I read it first. <br/>
She also watched the series on TV, except for the episodes with the <br/>
sex scenes. She likes Harry Potter, and a couple of other series of <br/>
books for her age about wizards and such.<br/>
<br/>
I noticed that people were giving examples of what their children <br/>
were reading, so I thought that I would as well.<br/>
<br/>
My 14 year old likes the Dear America series, My America Series, and <br/>
anything she can find having to do with horses.<br/>
<br/>
I have not told them what they can or cannot talk to their friends <br/>
about. They need to be able to discuss things with them. I also talk <br/>
with them about such issues as violence, sex, things we hear about on <br/>

Good point! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Lots of teen books are about adults being stupid and irritating, and teens <br/>
needing to depend on their own cleverness to overcome being practically <br/>
abandoned in the world of school.<br/>
<br/>
High school fantasy books are read by midschool/jr  high kids.  Midschool <br/>
fantasy is read by elementary kids. &lt;g&gt;   Same way the kids on commercials are <br/>
often a few years older than the target audience, because they want to identify <br/>
with older kids.<br/>

what will happen in a situation that is not familiar,<br/>
not even in situations that are similar to others he<br/>
has experienced.<br/>
<br/>
That is just Andrew, and it is ok.  Reading Anne O.&#39;s<br/>
essay really helped me see that, and be ok with who<br/>
Andrew is.  ANYWAY...I am digressing a bit...<br/>
<br/>
But it caused me problems because before I had always<br/>
censored what he watched, never even gave him the<br/>
option, knowing that he had this inability.<br/>
<br/>
Once we let go of the rules, though, I didn&#39;t realize<br/>
he might still want me to preview things for him.  It<br/>
seemed so controlling to me.  One day I popped<br/>
Gremlins into the dvd for the 5yo and I to watch, and<br/>
didn&#39;t even think that it might be too much for the<br/>
12yo, but ever since then he has nightmares and can&#39;t<br/>
go to bed alone.<br/>
<br/>
He felt betrayed by me.  It has happened several times<br/>
over the past 6 months or so, before I realized he<br/>
really did want me to preview things and tell him what<br/>
to expect so he could decide.  I would bring home<br/>
movies or netflix would arrive, and you could see the<br/>
anxiety in his eyes.<br/>
<br/>
The pressure to watch things he never before would<br/>
even have been allowed to watch is there as well, from<br/>
siblings, cousins, friends, even Dad, until I finally<br/>
explained to him it was not good to push him in either<br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
So I have two who are relishing their new freedom, and<br/>
one who is scared to death of it.  He doesn&#39;t feel<br/>
safe any more.  He never knows if he walks into the tv<br/>
room if someone will be watching something that will<br/>
freak him out.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts about this?  Some way to find a balance?<br/>
<br/>

My 14 year old asked one day if we could rent The Ring. She said my <br/>
sister had seen it and thought Skye may like it. She asked if I would <br/>
watch it with her , and I did. It is a newer movie, sort of <br/>
horror. . . maybe a psychological thriller. Not sure. She enjoyed the <br/>
movie very much. Another one that she likes (a bit scarrier) is one <br/>
about killer tooth fairy, which she also asked me to watch with her.I <br/>
did. She also likes Stephen King movies like It, Cujo, Silver Bullet <br/>
and The Stand. I think that the next one we are watching together is <br/>
Salems Lot. My sister bought her The Ring for Christmas and she was <br/>
very happy for it.<br/>
<br/>
My 11 year old has the option of watching all of the above movies as <br/>
well, but she will not. She doesn&#39;t like them. They make her <br/>
feel. . . uncomfortable? is that the word I&#39;m looking for. Not <br/>
scared. She much prefers comdies like Miss Congeniality, Sweet Home <br/>
Alabama, Nine Months.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, there are hints of sex in these movies, but no one is naked, etc.<br/>
<br/>
They both know what sex is, as we discuss things, and they come up <br/>
with some very interesting questions for me:0<br/>
<br/>
My nephew(9) loved Matrix Reloaded, I just find the one scene <br/>
inappropriate for my own childrens viewing. That is why I said that <br/>
it was just my opinion.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;My sister, though, puts no such limits on my nephew (9 years) <br/>
about even <br/>
&gt; violence, and he has watched Matrix Reloaded. So every parent is <br/>
different I <br/>
&gt; guess.&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went to see Matrix Reloaded.  My boys are 6 and 9.  We saw the <br/>
first one <br/>
&gt; and really liked it.  My boys liked the action in the second one <br/>
but on the <br/>
&gt; whole thought is was a very confusing movie, me too.  LOL.  As for <br/>
the sex scene <br/>
&gt; they really didn&#39;t think much of it.  My youngest said it was too <br/>
boring and <br/>
&gt; it was a good time for a potty break.  They both love action <br/>
movies.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the most part they are very good at censoring themselves.  They <br/>
know what <br/>
&gt; they do and do not like.  Sometimes if I know a movie might have a <br/>
scary part <br/>
&gt; I will tell them so they are prepared ahead of time.  My oldest <br/>
hates scary <br/>
&gt; movies, he is nine.  He will choose to not watch or when it starts <br/>
to get scary <br/>
&gt; he will leave the room for a few minutes.  They think of sex scenes <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; boring.  It isn&#39;t what they want to watch and will generally go <br/>
play with LEGOs or <br/>
&gt; something, it has no interest for them.  Now when the action comes <br/>
back on they <br/>
&gt; want to watch.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They also don&#39;t like a lot of violence that is &quot;real&quot; looking.  <br/>
They loved <br/>
&gt; LOTR.  Again thought some of the slower non-action parts were a <br/>
little boring, <br/>
&gt; especially my youngest, he is six.  They didn&#39;t like The Patriot.  <br/>
To them it <br/>
&gt; was too real and too bloody.  They left the room and played on <br/>
their computers <br/>
&gt; during that one.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They are good at censoring for themselves.  And I am sure their <br/>
tastes will <br/>
&gt; change over the years.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-882845507">WOW! Okay. My 14 year old asked me a few months ago and asked when <br/>
she could wear tampons. I told her when she was an adult, and she got <br/>
upset with me. I WAS WRONG! When I buy my tampons, I know what I use, <br/>
and I just run in the store and grab. I never bothered to lokk at <br/>
anything else. They actually do have tampons for teens. I did not <br/>
know! Just in too much of a hurry to pay attention I suppose. <br/>
<br/>
I appologized and ordered a couple of free samples from a company <br/>
that sells them for teens (?) not sure on the companies name.<br/>
<br/>
I sat down with her and explained how to put it in. We looked at the <br/>
directions that came in the box so she could see what I was <br/>
explaining to her. She tried using the ones that I had ordered for <br/>
her, and didn&#39;t like them. She said that they are uncomfortable, and <br/>
I explained that if she really wanted to use them, then she should <br/>
practice a few more times. She just said, &quot;no thank you, I&#39;ll just <br/>
stick with pads.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She may decide later on that she wants to use them, at least then <br/>
I&#39;ll know that she can, and not make that mistake again;)<br/>
