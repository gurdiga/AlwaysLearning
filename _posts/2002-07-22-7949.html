<div id="ygrps-yiv-1535793869">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Below is a message I received from an off-list friend of Dana&#39;s, in case<br/>
anyone is looking for specific ways to help her through losing her child.<br/>

hi,<br/>
<br/>
i don&#39;t belong to your lists, but am a friend of dana and her family. would<br/>
you be so kind as to pass this on to your lists?please let me know.<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
i know that there nothing is we could give the hoffman-wilson family to make<br/>
up for their loss, but i have decided to make a care package for all of<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
matt, dana, lauren and ema.<br/>
those of you living in montana may wish to send a letter or package from<br/>
there, but my hope is to have a package full of joyful oddities for all of<br/>
them. hopefully it will bring a little bit of sunshine and joy to them,<br/>
espeically knowing how much everyone is thinking of and praying for them.<br/>
perhaps you would like to make or buy something or send a letter. i will be<br/>
sending out care packages via fedex this friday (if there is enough stuff,<br/>
or<br/>
<br/>
monday)and next friday or the following monday. whatever you send to me, i<br/>
will pass on to their family.  you may of course contact me via phone or<br/>
email<br/>
