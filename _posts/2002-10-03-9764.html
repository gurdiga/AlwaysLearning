<div id="ygrps-yiv-490617275">My family and I recently moved from Indiana to<br/>
California and desparately miss the fall and all of<br/>
its colors, we were looking on the map of places to go<br/>
in the future during the fall season and picked Prince<br/>
Edward Island home to Anne of Green Gables.  Has<br/>
anyone been there, I would love for you to share your<br/>
experiences.<br/>

I haven&#39;t been, but I love all the Anne books and have read them all ten<br/>
times.  (OK, I started young and never stopped.)<br/>
<br/>
Would love to hear about your trip when you get back.<br/>

PS  I&#39;m not enjoying the Anne cartoons on PBS because the animation<br/>
seems so ugly to me!</div>

 </span></blockquote>I love my Anne of Green Gables books too. I also like Emily of New Moon. I <br/>
too don&#39;t like the cartoon, but I loved the TV show. Well, except for the <br/>
part that it didn&#39;t follow the books too much. But it was still good. There <br/>
is an Emily of New Moon show on WHAM! but, I haven&#39;t seen it to comment on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-652118102">Yes, we went there when I was younger.  ( also Nova Scotia) I remember antiquing, walking along gorgeous beaches and deep sea fishing. It reminded me of Cape Cod with a European flair if that helps! Mary in Va.<br/>

Well, Nancy, you&#39;re still ahead of me as I don&#39;t even know what WHAM! is!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It is a TV station, we get it on satellite. I think it might be out of <br/>
Canada, but could be very wrong. Speaking of Canada, I have noticed that a <br/>
lot of programs Moly likes to watch come from there. She loves the station <br/>
Discovery Kids, and many (all?) programs on that station come from Canada. <br/>
Another show called The Worst Witch, airs on HBOF and it too comes from <br/>
Canada. My point? I guess that I really appreciate the quality programs for <br/>
kids that come from Canada, it seems like they take care in what they produce <br/>
for children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m kind of out of touch with the kids shows now (ds is almost 15) but we<br/>
were just in Washington State for a week, and Lars was complaining about the<br/>
lack of channels on my mother&#39;s cable.  It seems that her cable doesn&#39;t get<br/>
any Canadian stations.  Up here we get both the Canadian and U.S. stations,<br/>
so we actually have more choices.<br/>
