&quot;Don&#39;t be afraid of showing affection. Be warm and tender, thoughtful and affectionate. Mankind is more helped by sympathy than by service. Love is more than money, and a kind word will give more pleasure than a present.&quot; <br/>
~ Jean Baptiste Lacordaire<br/>

The Things We Steal From Children <br/>
Dr John Edwards <br/>

My teacher should have ridden with Jesse James, <br/>
My teacher should have ridden with Jesse James, <br/>
<br/>
My teacher should have ridden with Jesse James, <br/>
For all the things she stole from me. <br/>
<br/>
Poem by a 12 year old <br/>
Australian student <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
One evening, on returning from lecturing to my<br/>
students, my wife asked me: &quot;And what did you steal<br/>
from your students today?&quot; The question rocked me, and<br/>
as I examined my practice under her skilful<br/>
questioning, I realised how much of the processes I<br/>
kept for myself. <br/>
<br/>
So we sat down and together we wrote the following: <br/>
<br/>
If I am always the one to think of where to go next. <br/>
If where we go is always the decision of the<br/>
curriculum or my curiosity and not theirs. <br/>
If motivation is mine. <br/>
If I always decide on the topic to be studied, the<br/>
title of the story, the problem to be worked on <br/>
If I am always the one who has reviewed their work and<br/>
decided what they need. <br/>
How will they ever know how to begin? <br/>
<br/>
If I am the one who is always monitoring progress. <br/>
If I set the pace of all working discussions. <br/>
If I always look ahead, foresee problems and endeavour<br/>
to eliminate them. <br/>
If I swoop in and save them from cognitive conflict. <br/>
If I never allow them to feel and use the energy from<br/>
confusion and frustration. If things are always broken<br/>
into short working periods. <br/>
If myself and others are allowed to break into their<br/>
concentration. <br/>
If bells and I are always in control of the pace and<br/>
flow of work <br/>
How will they learn to continue their own work? <br/>
<br/>
If all the marking and editing is done by me. <br/>
If the selection of which work is to be published or<br/>
evaluated is made by me. <br/>
If what is valued and valuable is always decided by<br/>
external sources or by me. <br/>
If there is no forum to discuss what delights them in<br/>
their task, what is working, what is not working, what<br/>
they plan to do about it. <br/>
If they have not learned a language to discuss their<br/>
work in ways that are intrinsically growth enhancing. <br/>
If they do not have a language of self-assessment. <br/>
If ways of communicating their work are always<br/>
controlled by me. <br/>
If our assessments are mainly summative rather than<br/>
formative. <br/>
If they do not plan their way forward to further<br/>
action. <br/>
How will they find ownership, direction and delight in<br/>
what they do? <br/>
<br/>
If I speak of individuals but present learning as if<br/>
they are all the same. <br/>
If I am never seen to reflect and reflection time is<br/>
never provided. <br/>
If we never speak together about reflection and<br/>
thinking and never develop a vocabulary for such<br/>
discussion. <br/>
If we do not take opportunities to think about our<br/>
thinking. <br/>
If I constantly set them exercises that do not<br/>
intellectually challenge them. <br/>
If I set up learning environments that interfere with<br/>
them learning from their own actions. <br/>
If I give them recipes to follow. <br/>
If I only expect the one right conclusion. <br/>
If I signify that there are always right and wrong<br/>
answers. <br/>
If I never openly respect their thoughts. <br/>
If I never let them persevere with something really<br/>
difficult which they cannot master. <br/>
If I make all work serious work and discourage<br/>
playfulness. <br/>
If there is no time to explore. <br/>
If I lock them into adult time constraints too early. <br/>
How will they get to know themselves as a thinker? <br/>
<br/>
If they never get to help anyone else. <br/>
If we force them to always work and play with children<br/>
of the same age. <br/>
If I do not teach them the skills of working<br/>
co-operatively. <br/>
If collaboration can be seen as cheating. <br/>
If all classroom activities are based in<br/>
competitiveness. <br/>
If everything is seen to be for marks. <br/>
How will they learn to work with others? <br/>
<br/>
For if they <br/>
have never experienced being challenged in a safe<br/>
environment. <br/>
have had all of their creative thoughts explained<br/>
away. <br/>
are unaware what catches their interest and how then<br/>
to have confidence in that interest. <br/>
have never followed something they are passionate<br/>
about to a satisfying conclusion. <br/>
have not clarified the way they sabotage their own<br/>
learning. <br/>
are afraid to seek help and do not know who or how to<br/>
ask. <br/>
have not experienced overcoming their own inertia. <br/>
are paralysed by the need to know everything before<br/>
writing or acting. <br/>
have never got bogged down. <br/>
have never failed. <br/>
have always played it safe. <br/>
How will they ever know who they are? <br/>
<br/>

I liked this &#39;verse&#39; especially, but even there, it can be boiled  <br/>
down to<br/>
<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt; If I do not teach them...<br/>
&gt; How will they learn?<br/>

<br/>
(line 3, and the last line)<br/>
<br/>
Even someone with that much awareness can still feel that they must  <br/>
be taught.<br/>
<br/>
And the last verse is quite pro-school, and pro-frustration, and pro- <br/>
pressure in ways I&#39;m sure the author/teacher would justify for hours.<br/>
<br/>
The fantasy environment being spun out there is better than school,  <br/>
but it&#39;s still school.<br/>
I&#39;m glad there are school reformers, for sure, and glad there are  <br/>
things out there to help teachers think too, so that they don&#39;t have  <br/>
their creativity and potential stolen by the courses teachers are  <br/>
expected to follow without thinking.  But it&#39;s just another way to  <br/>
tweak school.<br/>
