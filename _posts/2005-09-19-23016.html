Do you have a maid ? I don&#39;t . I HAVE to do other work.<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t add the caps.<br/>
Another HUGE boost to understanding how unschooling can work well is to see <br/>
the choices we make, and to see them as the choices they are.<br/>

My hubby is rarely around and it is just me and a HUGE house.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
You could choose to live in only a few   rooms, or to move to a smaller <br/>
house, or to hire help.<br/>
Not choosing those things, is a choice, too.   <br/>
Thinking in terms of &quot;have to&quot; makes a person feel helpless and frustrated.<br/>
Thinking in terms of choices is strenghthening and expansive.<br/>
