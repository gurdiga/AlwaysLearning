<div id="ygrps-yiv-1930431243">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;No Boca nuggets in Paradise? What about Chico? You<br/>
need to come to the<br/>
coast. Or tell the store how much you like them, maybe<br/>
they&#39;ll start<br/>
selling them.<br/>
Ann&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, I keep hassling them (in a nice friendly sort<br/>
of way &lt;g&gt;). Eventually they&#39;ll get sick of me and get<br/>
them (I hope). I haven&#39;t found them in Chico yet<br/>
either - weird.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965599783">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;What about &quot;Not Chicken Nuggets&quot;? I actually like<br/>
those better than <br/>
boca<br/>
nuggets but they are harder to find.<br/>
They also make &quot;Not Corn Dogs&quot; Totally gross.<br/>
Elissa, who will soon be singing<br/>
Yippee - Kai - Yay!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never seen those. I&#39;ll keep a look out. Tamzin<br/>
and I have tried EVERY single veggie dog type thing on<br/>
the market over here. IourHO, they are all YUCKY! In<br/>
fact, I&#39;m feeling a bit envious of her at the moment<br/>
because she went to see her dad in the UK yesterday<br/>
for 3 weeks and she will be eating lots of YUMMY<br/>
veggie dogs.<br/>
On that note (that I&#39;ve got time on my hands for 3<br/>
weeks)...I went and saw The Count of Monte Cristo<br/>
tonight (the movie, that is). I loved it! All that<br/>
period clothing and swashbuckling stuff. The lead guy<br/>
is gorgeous!! I want to dream about him tonight :-)<br/>
