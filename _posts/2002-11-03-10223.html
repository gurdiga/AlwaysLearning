&gt;&gt; Just curious, I don&#39;t mean to enflame, and you probably do, but I feel<br/>
&gt;&gt; compelled to play the flip side--<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just asking, but did you MEAN to imply that she is wanting to flame?  Maybe<br/>
&gt; you meant &quot;probably don&#39;t,&quot; instead of &quot;do&quot;?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; joc<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Woops!<br/>
That was a bad edit. It should have read &quot;I don&#39;t mean to enflame, and you<br/>
probably don&#39;t either,...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
ThatÂ¹s what I get for posting in a hurry. Sorry about that.<br/>
