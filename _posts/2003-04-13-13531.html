<div id="ygrps-yiv-456862682">I thought this list would really like to hear my husband&#39;s words to his mom <br/>
after she asked about this &quot;unschooling&quot;. She&#39;s not said a word for over <br/>
three years since Ben said, &quot;This is OUR decision.&quot; Here is his response! <br/>
<br/>
~Kelly<br/>
<br/>
Mom-<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for breakfast and the conversation on Friday morning. I&#39;d have enjoyed <br/>
extending our conversation, but our time was limited.  We can continue at any <br/>
time; my schedule is open.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you also for asking about the boys&#39; learning and for your concern for <br/>
Cameron.  Since our decision to unschool the boys, I think that was the first <br/>
time that I felt that someone in my family actually was curious without <br/>
interrogating me about why we&#39;d taken the boys out of school.  I certainly <br/>
will accept some of the responsibility of not helping where that was <br/>
concerned.  To help your curiosity, I&#39;m providing you with some suggested <br/>
books, websites, and other resources to have you read.  Taking the time to do <br/>
this will answer many of the questions that you have while giving you tons of <br/>
other questions which are certain to come up.  While I don&#39;t mind answering <br/>
the questions, these resources will help you to understand at least partly <br/>
where we&#39;re coming from; you can then ask questions which are more in-depth <br/>
and from a point of learning vs questioning the decision and whether or not <br/>
it is the right one.  The &quot;why&quot; is less important than the process that we <br/>
followed to get to the decision as well as the process of the boys&#39; learning.<br/>
<br/>
One note from our conversation: I truly meant what I said about children and <br/>
decisions.  I think that adults spend way too much time trying to tell <br/>
children what&#39;s right and wrong vs listening to their children to find out <br/>
what&#39;s right for that child.  Children who have the freedom that Cameron and <br/>
Duncan have understand this, and, more often than not, make excellent choices <br/>
for what is right for them.  While direction is offered, we offer it only <br/>
when requested.  Does this mean that Duncan and Cameron don&#39;t understand our <br/>
principles and values?  Far from it.  They know that we&#39;ll freely provide <br/>
whatever direction that they need; we just don&#39;t believe in imposing our <br/>
respective wills, morals, rules, or any other restrictive bias onto them just <br/>
because we may have been brought up a certain way or because we&#39;re bigger or <br/>
because &quot;we said so&quot;.  In the end, we are also learning as we go with this, <br/>
too; the difference is that we know this is the best decision that we have <br/>
made to help them with their &quot;education&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally, adults, for the most part, forget what it was like to be 4 or 7 <br/>
or 13 or 17.  Those of us who remember do not make it a habit of directing <br/>
our children&#39;s destiny or dictating what they should do and when.  Our <br/>
children are not drones, told to learn what the State (re: school system) <br/>
will have them learn, nor expected to be a success based upon what society or <br/>
friends or relatives or we define as a success.  We believe that our children <br/>
are free to define when, where, how, and why they learn something; that they <br/>
are free to determine their own meaning of what is successful or not.  Most <br/>
adults don&#39;t even know what success is.  They just believe what society tells <br/>
them, and they go along with that, never living up to the potential of where <br/>
their dreams truly lead.  Cameron and Duncan will know how to learn, know the <br/>
value of learning, know that there is more than one way to learn, and know <br/>
how to use their imagination and dream.  Equally important is that they&#39;ll be <br/>
able to determine for themselves what success is and how to truly define it, <br/>
and they&#39;ll be able to do this before the age of 18.<br/>
<br/>
One final note along the lines of how we see children:  they are not flowers <br/>
waiting to bloom at some special age; they have bloomed already.  We must <br/>
treat them with respect for who they are at age 1 or 4 or 10 or whatever age <br/>
they are and trust them at those ages as well.  If we wait until they&#39;re 18 <br/>
and on their own, we&#39;ll have missed a 17+-year opportunity to provide them <br/>
with the most basic guiding principle of being human: treat others as you <br/>
would have them treat you.  I&#39;d worry that my kids would resent me more for <br/>
not allowing them to learn this (notice that I wrote &quot;learn&quot; and not &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
-- there is no such thing as a teacher if someone is not truly willing or <br/>
ready to learn) before I&#39;d worry about resentment for not having sent them to <br/>
school.  I can live with this because we&#39;ve given them the authority, tools, <br/>
resources, and freedom to define their own &quot;education&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I offered those three prior paragraphs as a small insight to me and, to a <br/>
large degree, Kelly and how we think.  It is not meant to be seen as right or <br/>
wrong or a &quot;that&#39;s the way it is, so f--- you&quot; attitude.  I offer no <br/>
apologies and expect no evaluation or criticism of our thought pattern.  I <br/>
merely offer it as information and, coupled with the resources below, as an <br/>
opportunity for you to understand what we know about unschooling and our <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
I love you-<br/>

<br/>
Books about Unschooling:<br/>
<br/>
The man that coined the word &quot;unschooling&quot; was John Holt. The &quot;Father of <br/>
Unschooling&quot;, he died in 1985---but he was the instigator of modern home <br/>
learning and is still the &quot;authority&quot; on learning. You can find all his books <br/>
at the library. He began as a school reformer, but soon realized that schools <br/>
were unreformable. His first books are attempts to change the way schools and <br/>
teachers teach and respond to children; the later books show how learning <br/>
really occurs and that children are naturally curious, creative, and <br/>
intelligent---that they are natural learners: &quot;Fish swim, birds fly, humans <br/>
learn.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How Children Fail,  How Children Learn, and Learning All the Time are three <br/>
good ones.<br/>

Get a REAL Education. The parable at the beginning alone is worth the price <br/>
of the book.<br/>
