 </span></blockquote>Thanks, Sandra.  I&#39;m still hoping you&#39;ll look the book over for a little <br/>
blurb on the back cover.  I seem to be way behind with my &quot;schedule&quot;.  I did do a <br/>
hike on the Appalachian Trail, but then needed to come home early, <br/>
unexpectedly, as my son Devin had a serious accident.  He&#39;s had surgery,and has re-hab.  <br/>
They are thinking he will re-gain the use of his right hand, but it will take <br/>
many months.<br/>
<br/>
When the Inn owner was shuttling me to the bus so that I could get home, he <br/>
said my son should realize how lucky he was to have a mom that would cut her <br/>
hike short, because he was hurt.  <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say anything, but I can&#39;t imagine a mom who wouldn&#39;t need to get <br/>
home to an injured child.  I don&#39;t think hiking by myself for days with Devin on <br/>
my mind would have done anything but make me crazy!!<br/>
