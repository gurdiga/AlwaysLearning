&gt; really.....went to an event last year but didn&#39;t really get it together <br/>
&gt; until <br/>
&gt; a couple months ago.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, are you still going to the conference? The boys could bring their <br/>
&gt; youth combat gear if other SCA&#39;ers will be there.<br/>
&gt; I think Sandra&#39;s kids are coming, at least some of them.<br/>
&gt; My kids had that look of awe at our first event. They could hardly believe <br/>
&gt; how cool it was. They still love it and look forward to fighter practice <br/>
&gt; every Sunday. Tell Julian he&#39;ll be among some like minded folks (in more <br/>
&gt; than <br/>
&gt; one way)!!<br/>

do combat stuff until they were older... But Julian would LOVE to see this <br/>
stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Getting excited,<br/>
