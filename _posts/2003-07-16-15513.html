<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866691357">I have also been amazed at the vocabulary that my kids have learned from<br/>
games.   And most are video games and gameboy games.<br/>
<br/>
They come to me,  Mom, what does this mean?  And I&#39;m like,  &quot;Wow! Um,,,&quot;   I<br/>
have to think a bit,  they aren&#39;t exactly simple terms,  and they (the kids)<br/>
are all over them!   I should write some down too!    Just to impress<br/>
Grandmas and Grandpas.<br/>
<br/>
Another realization I had about video games came last week when I was trying<br/>
to play Yu-gi-O with them,  OMG,  where is my brain?     It is very complex<br/>
and challenging.   Have any of you read through the instruction booklet for<br/>
that game?   I had to keep going back and forth,  rereading this and that,<br/>
trying to keep this card straight from that card.  And talk about<br/>
vocabulary!<br/>
<br/>
I always knew that they were learning tons from all these games, but I never<br/>
knew the degree of difficulty that I would have trying to play!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They think I&#39;m pretty lame,  I can handle Ms. Pacman  :0)  Oh,  and just<br/>
found out I can handle a mini game in Mario 4, called Book Squirm--its fun!<br/>

    I think YuGiOh is very complex. I&#39;ve read and re read that instruction<br/>
book. I think the boys learned how to play more from the PS2 game. I still<br/>
don&#39;t get it all.;-)<br/>
    All my boys enjoy Warcraft. They try to explain some of these to me and<br/>
I&#39;m the one having the hard time. LOL!<br/>

Raine replies: I leave that to my hubby! He owns a gaming store which sells, and hold tournaments, for games like Yu Gi O, Pokemon, Magic, etc... He gets to teach all the kids (and adults) who come in how to play. Usually it&#39;s my kids teaching me! lol<br/>
I&#39;d like to add my two cents about Sim-type computer games. THEY ROCK! My friend&#39;s husband has worked for Disney for some 25 years, and he told me they built much of California Adventure on that game before presenting it to be built.<br/>
Hooray for games!<br/>
