<div id="ygrps-yiv-1373783695">The &quot;demonic rock group Led Zepplin?&quot;  oh pleeeeezz.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, thanks for the earlier posts on the Christian shunning of Harry and <br/>
their embrace of  Bilbo.  A lady wandered into out unschoolers game club <br/>
the other day.  She had some comments about a Simpsons Chess Set that <br/>
was being used.  She didn&#39;t allow Simpsons to come into her house. To <br/>
which one of the other moms said, &quot;Oh we watch the Simpsons every day. <br/>
 It&#39;s always on from 6:00 to 7:00 and we always watch it.&quot;  &quot;Oh.&quot;  The <br/>
anti-Simpsons lady later began talking about LofR and talked about how <br/>
her daughter had all the posters and they were collecting the figurines, <br/>
and got the DVD, etc.  After she left, the pro-Simpsons mom and I <br/>
 wondered about how that lady could be so anti-Simpson yet pro-LofR. <br/>
 I&#39;m still wondering.<br/>

<br/>
Well Bart says &quot;eat my shorts,&quot; but Frodo says sweet mushy things about his <br/>
uncle, his friends, duty, courage....<br/>
<br/>
I really enjoyed the movie, but I&#39;m sorry and curious about why they didn&#39;t <br/>
say that it was Frodo&#39;s birthday too, and his thirty-third, his coming of <br/>
age.  They just talk about Bilbo&#39;s birthday, but the really cool thing about <br/>
that party was it was eleventy-leven for Bilbo AND 33rd for Frodo, right?<br/>
<br/>
Oh well...<br/>
<br/>

there were huge rumours about Jimmy Page being a satanist <br/>
and satanic messages if you played certain songs backwards.  I <br/>
still remember my friends and I trying to play records backwards <br/>
to see if we could &#39;hear&#39; anything exciting.  And of course, we all <br/>
had crushes on Jimmy and Robert &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
