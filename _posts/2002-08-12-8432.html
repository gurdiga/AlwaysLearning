<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816277506">Although I drink water, I&#39;ve never managed the huge quantities recommended, <br/>
and have always questioned the claims that lettuce didn&#39;t count or tea didn&#39;t <br/>
count, or soda or fruit.  Since it&#39;s also claimed that water isn&#39;t so helpful <br/>
to digestion (some dieticians recommend against eating and drinking at the <br/>
same meal because the enzymes don&#39;t work as well on the food), how COULD that <br/>
much water be useful?  If cells use water at their own level (cellular) how <br/>
can they tell water that came in &quot;straight&quot; from water that is taken from <br/>
tomatoes or lettuce or Dr Pepper?<br/>
<br/>
So I thought these things and asked other people for years, but they grunted <br/>
and said &quot;It&#39;s not the same.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
When I was in college taking psychology I remember a teacher who was a good <br/>
storyteller telling us that any substance in excess could cause death.  And <br/>
as an example he told us about a young woman whose dad died and she started <br/>
drinking water and within just a couple or three days she was dead of that.  <br/>
Like drowning, he said.  The organs couldn&#39;t process the water out and it <br/>
built up and up.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if she had lived in the desert she could have just evaporated it out.<br/>

Water intoxication re: polydypsia is one of the three &quot;P&#39;s&quot; hallmark signs of <br/>
diabetes. Polyphagia (eating too much) Polyuria (urinating too much) and <br/>
Polydypsia (drinking too much) Although none of these things necessarily <br/>
indicate diabetes, together they are indicators. Psychogenic Polydypsia (not <br/>
always occurring with diabetes.) a condition that causes the sufferer to <br/>
exhibit symptoms of intoxication. Literally the person will act drunk, talk <br/>
drunk, walk drunk... the cause? Water. I have seen patients on water <br/>
restricted diets go to great lengths to drink. The end result is or can be <br/>
dangerous. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1242993931">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
We live on a small Greek island where the luxury of water is scarce.   <br/>
We have a water tank that we fill up before the summer that we use  <br/>
for all household uses except drinking.  On top of that we have a  <br/>
summer rental business.  All the rentals run off the water tank.    <br/>
Water, for us, is a luxury and one to be used sparingly.  So...  my  <br/>
daughters LOVE to take looooong, leisurely showers.  Can anyone help  <br/>
me think of some creative ways on how to best deal with the scarcity  <br/>
of water and their desire for long showers?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564926739">Would it be possible to reuse the water by using a pump to catch <br/>
what&#39;s in the tub and pump it up to shower down again?  Thinking of <br/>
those in-house waterfall things where there is a continuous stream <br/>
of water but the volume of water is the same.  If the weather is <br/>
nice maybe they could shower outside in a kiddie pool with some sort <br/>
of water pump/recycler?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840334214">Thanks everyone for your replies.<br/>
<br/>
The pool idea might work well for us this summer.... it brought me to  <br/>
a new idea of taking outside showers in a tub and then using the  <br/>
water to water the plants.  I could do that with an environmentally  <br/>
safe soap/shampoo (we often use raw eggs, baking soda and vinegar  <br/>
which works well enough and won&#39;t fry the plants).<br/>
<br/>
This will probably work best for now.  It would be great to get a  <br/>
grey water system working here but we&#39;re not ready for that  <br/>
financially.  Hopefully by next summer.<br/>
