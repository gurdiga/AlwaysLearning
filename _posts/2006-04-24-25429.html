<div id="ygrps-yiv-46062852">&quot;What do you do when the situation calls for immediate intervention,<br/>
like when one is holding a stick with a burning ember on it and waving<br/>
it near the other, or when one is throwing rocks in the general<br/>
vicinity of the other (and hitting them, accidentally)?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Intervene means to get INVOLVED immediately, not stand and talk.<br/>
When something needs immediate intervention, I move quickly towards<br/>
the person and STOP the activity that could lead to harm.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is unwilling to move a hot stick away from people, I will<br/>
keep it until they can be safe with it.  There&#39;s no punishment<br/>
involved, but there IS safety. I don&#39;t wait for someone to get burned<br/>
to DO something.<br/>
<br/>
Usually, I find that Jalen is perfectly happy to continue the activity<br/>
in a different area or aimed in a different direction (&quot;throw the<br/>
rocks that way, not towards Sierra&quot;) and that&#39;s fine. Sometimes he&#39;s<br/>
not and I let him know that the burning stick (recent true example)<br/>
will have to be put down or given to me if he won&#39;t keep it away from<br/>
faces.<br/>
<br/>
Freedom does not include the right to harm other people. They really<br/>
don&#39;t want to anyhow...but a 5y.o. doesn&#39;t always think through the<br/>
consequences. He&#39;s 5. That&#39;s part of my job as a parent. His job is to<br/>
be fascinated with burning sticks.<br/>

dangerous implement is external enforcement (as are more subtle rewards such<br/>

You have the power to totally screw them up and make their lives a  <br/>
living hell.<br/>
If you can see how you would do that, there&#39;s your list of things NOT  <br/>
to do.<br/>
<br/>
You have the power to create a rich, happy nest where they can&#39;t help  <br/>
but learn.<br/>

If punishment is a bad, hurtful thing, then the flipside of that  <br/>

I know the arguments against rewards *in schools* and in operant  <br/>

Those kinds of rewards (M&Ms for a baby who goes in the potty) aren&#39;t  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Handicap yourself.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a game called The A-MAZE-ing Labyrinth.  Each player has a  <br/>
pile of cards (things to find), and the way to play with different  <br/>
ages is to make the piles unequal. Inequality makes it fair. &lt;g&gt;   <br/>
Young players only have a few cards.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been with my husband for 27 years.  Six &quot;in sin&quot;, 21 &quot;real.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Around year five or so he said in deep frustration one day that it  <br/>
wasn&#39;t really fair that we could only use words in discussions,  <br/>
because with words I always won.  If physical altercations were legal  <br/>
and accepted, then he could win sometimes.  But he had learned very  <br/>
young, being a big strong guy, not to use that tool in everyday life  <br/>
at all.<br/>
<br/>
I started consciously trying to do the same thing in discussions.  If  <br/>
I saw that he was flustered or fishing for a word, I would wait,  <br/>
instead of winning just because I could.  He was right.  I was taking  <br/>
advantage of him, without having realized it and without having  <br/>
intended to.   I&#39;m really glad we had that conversation.  Otherwise  <br/>
I&#39;d have no stories about 27 years, and my kids would have divorce  <br/>
and stepparent stories, and school stories no doubt.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
A friend of mine married someone who was pretty, and sweet, and...   <br/>
sweet and pretty.<br/>
<br/>
I was one of the first ones he told when he was going to ask her.  I  <br/>
told him the story (he knows both Keith and me very well) and told  <br/>
him that because he could both physically and verbally best her every  <br/>
time, easily, he needed to decide early on that he wouldn&#39;t do it.<br/>
<br/>
I was given a simple but valuable gift when Kirby was a baby.   A La  <br/>
Leche League leader told me that I should be his partner, and not his  <br/>
adversary.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all.<br/>
<br/>
If one person on a team is strong and powerful, that&#39;s good for the  <br/>
team.<br/>

The team model should help with that too.  They shouldn&#39;t need to  <br/>

How could it be made &quot;symmetrical&quot;?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
-=-Aren&#39;t you sending a message, though? Mom holds the wallet, and  <br/>

<br/>
This is so odd a thought I don&#39;t know what direction to go.<br/>
I have ALWAYS desired to make their lives wonderful from before they  <br/>
were born.  They know that.<br/>
<br/>
Every one of my kids has turned down offers of cash and purchase in  <br/>
the past couple of weeks.  Marty and Holly, separately, turned down  <br/>
the offer of a cellphone.  Kirby has had one for a while.  I just  <br/>
lately needed to get one, and offered each of them an add-on phone on  <br/>
the account.  Both thought of it and said they didn&#39;t think they  <br/>
needed one right now.    Both (separately) have turned down offers of  <br/>
eating out.  And I&#39;m guessing some readers might be picturing a  <br/>
hostile refusal, a reactionary kind of &quot;screw you&quot; or &quot;never mind,&quot;  <br/>
but really it was very gentle and an honest lack of desire to eat  <br/>
out.  They wanted to stay home. (Well in Holly&#39;s case we were out,  <br/>
but she wanted to come home and eat here instead.)<br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid I took every scrap of money, attention and outing I  <br/>
could get.  I was needy, as attention went, and as material goods  <br/>
went.   My kids aren&#39;t.  But even when Kirby was little and his toys  <br/>
mostly came from garage sales or were homemade, he wasn&#39;t needy.  It  <br/>
all has to do with giving them as much of YOU as they want.<br/>

<br/>
Characterize it as keeping them safe. How&#39;s that?<br/>
<br/>
If wielding power is your best choice, then so be it. Sometimes just  <br/>
a word will work - so say, &quot;Stick!&quot; instead of grabbing the stick. If  <br/>
you don&#39;t have time for that - if the burning stick is heading toward  <br/>
the other child&#39;s face, grab the stick, of course.<br/>
<br/>
The point is to think of other options, if at all possible.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll get better at other options if you make a list of alternative  <br/>
responses and always consider at least one of those along with the  <br/>
use of power that otherwise seems required.<br/>

now &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to add that in listing alternative options, if you automatically<br/>
say &quot;yes&quot; (at least in your head) to whatever the child is doing or wanting,<br/>
it can help you navigate through the &quot;how&quot; it can work<br/>
<br/>
So switching the &quot;no&quot; to &quot;yes&quot; can look like:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Yes, you can have the hot-ended stick, and here&#39;s how that can work...&quot;<br/>
show him where it can be pointed, show how it draws on the concrete, look at<br/>
the glowing patterns it makes as it waves in the dark...continue with what<br/>
the child is interested with the stick in a safe way.<br/>
<br/>
First saying &quot;yes&quot; keeps things moving, flowing, living. The automatic no is<br/>
a jolting stop to that flow.<br/>
<br/>
And safety indeed comes first, as long as it is a REAL safety issue, not one<br/>
that we were brainwashed with growing up (&quot;a child should never hold a<br/>
hot-ended stick&quot;). There are many safe ways a child can do that.<br/>
