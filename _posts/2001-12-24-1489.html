<div id="ygrps-yiv-1384145652">Yesterday we had Christmas with my mother.  Her response to my<br/>
daughter&#39;s gift, &quot;Oh I don&#39;t need this.&quot;  Turning to me, &quot;You take it,<br/>
you can use it more than me.  What am I going to do with it?&quot;  As my 11<br/>
year old daughter fought to keep back the tears, my mother smiled at<br/>
her, expectantly, with an expression on her face that I don&#39;t<br/>
understand.<br/>
<br/>
To my gift, eight books in a series, &quot;Couldn&#39;t you find any MORE of<br/>
these?  I doubt I&#39;ll have them read by this time next year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then she told us about my sister&#39;s gift to her from the day before, &quot;It<br/>
was a CD of somebody or other but I just gave it right back to her and<br/>
told her to take it home.  I don&#39;t have a CD player!  What was I going<br/>
to do with that!?&quot;  And the look on her face, joyful.  A glint in her<br/>
eye like she&#39;d won that battle.<br/>
<br/>
After all these years, I&#39;ve come to expect this behavior from her but it<br/>
was hard to see her do it to my daughter.  And I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever<br/>
seen the happiness on her face before.  I always try to understand<br/>
things before I can let go of them.  Why would someone be like that?<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, it will be different next year.  Merry Christmas.<br/>
<br/>

. . a simple answer to a probably complex situation. If it were me, I think I <br/>
would either forgo the gifts, or make a donation to a charity in her name (my <br/>
sister does this and I think it is wonderful!!). . . something like an abused <br/>
womens shelter maybe. . . or whatever you feel you want to give to. <br/>
<br/>
My mom always says don&#39;t get us anything, so I started doing that a few years <br/>
back, but I really don&#39;t think she meant it, and no one else listened to her <br/>
but me. Oh well. :)<br/>

&lt;&lt;  Turning to me, &quot;You take it,<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m building up the courage to call Keith&#39;s mom and say &quot;Hi, Merry Christmas, <br/>
sorry we didn&#39;t send a card or anything, but here&#39;s what the kids are up to.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been at her house for Christmas twice.  They&#39;ve returned gifts.  <br/>
Christmas and birthdays.  They&#39;ve said gifts were unnecessary.   I saw her <br/>
open stuff from my brother in law who wasn&#39;t there and laugh at what he sent. <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s awful and evil.<br/>
<br/>
So I don&#39;t feel bad that we didn&#39;t send gifts, but we had planned to send a <br/>
card with thank-you notes writte in it for the gifts they sent.  <br/>
<br/>
Same gift as last year, and the year before... a $25 check for me, Keith, and <br/>
each of the kids.  That doesn&#39;t suck, y&#39;know--$25 apiece.  But it&#39;s not sweet <br/>
and personal and special.  And so although it totally deserves <br/>
acknolwedgement, what are we supposed to do on our end?   Send them each $25??<br/>
<br/>
We gave my father-in-law one of the two copies of the Homeschool Book of <br/>
Answers we had, because there&#39;s a photo of Kirby and Marty in there, and <br/>
quotes.    *I* thought if I were a grandparent I would LOVE to have a book <br/>
with a photo and quote from a grandchild of mine.<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s brother came up to see us a few weeks later, after having visited the <br/>
parents, and brought the regular thing--a plastic grocery bag with the past <br/>
several month&#39;s worth of New Mexico Magazine, National Geographic and the <br/>
National Parks magazine.   It&#39;s cool that they give us their used magazines; <br/>
I don&#39;t mind.   But in with the magazines was that book.<br/>
<br/>
I cried.<br/>
<br/>
Then I loaned it to some new homeschooler who never returned it (well,t phone <br/>
call. &lt;&lt;joy&gt;&gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No ideas that are very positive. :-/ That&#39;s pretty toxic behavior and I&#39;m so <br/>
sorry that you&#39;ve had to endure it for so long. (Not to mention the ache I&#39;m <br/>
feeling for your sweet daughter.) Maybe your Mom has some negative <br/>
associations with Christmas? Maybe she doesn&#39;t feel worthy of gifts and is <br/>
then trying to bring everyone else down to her level? Maybe no one ever <br/>
taught her manners!?<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ll probably never figure it out completely. My best advice, not that you <br/>
asked for it, would be to find another way to celebrate the holidays with <br/>
your mother. It doesn&#39;t have to be about gift giving at all. I can imagine <br/>
future holidays with a lovely card for mom (maybe) and a peaceful <br/>
celebration with friends and immediate family. It can be whatever you choose <br/>
to make it. From your post, though, it sounds like you&#39;ve already reached <br/>
that conclusion.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes for a happier rest of the holiday.<br/>
~Mary<br/>

marionette from my dear sil that had me in tears today. It&#39;s a bit of a <br/>
bizarre gift, but I do truly appreciate the thought behind it.)<br/>
<br/>
Are Keith&#39;s parents usually the evil type? Could it maybe just be a complete <br/>
and total lack of &quot;getting it&quot;? Obviously I&#39;m just trying to find the silver <br/>
linig since I don&#39;t know these people at all and you do. It&#39;s just so hard <br/>
to acknowledge evil behavior for its&#39; own sake.<br/>

<br/>
Hey, Keith&#39;s mom must confer with Jon&#39;s mom! That&#39;s the same gift we get for <br/>
every Hanukah and birthday. I know what you mean about it not being very <br/>
personal. I&#39;ve gotten past that for the most part. They really don&#39;t want <br/>
gifts in return and are usually thrilled with the thank you notes and <br/>
pictures we send. Those always come several weeks later, though.<br/>

end up ahead since it would be hard to spend $125 on a small arrangement. <br/>

I keep a mental list of &quot;things I must remember when I&#39;m a grandparent&quot;. Not <br/>
returning sentimental gifts would be right up there on the list.<br/>

That&#39;s a good idea.  Once we sent flowers.  <br/>
<br/>
If she laughs at that, it will be to the closing door behind the delivery <br/>
boy, and I won&#39;t have to know.<br/>
<br/>
She likes photos of the kids.  We sent the family photo for her birthday in <br/>
the fall.  She seemed truly happy.<br/>
<br/>
I should try to upload the family photo to this site.  Education I might save <br/>
for tomorrow or Wednesday.<br/>

If that&#39;s the way they truly are, I personally would never bother with <br/>
another gift. It&#39;s lost on them. They just don&#39;t get the value or sentiment <br/>
behind it. I&#39;d stick with cards and photos. That way you haven&#39;t forgotten, <br/>
you&#39;ve just scaled it way back. And you&#39;d let your kids know you don&#39;t have <br/>
to open yourself up to possible hurt to play the game with people like that. <br/>
