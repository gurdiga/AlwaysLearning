<div id="ygrps-yiv-1250738394">Info about blue laws and funny ones from around the country follows. <br/>
<br/>
In SC we can buy film, but not a camera; detergent, but not a sponge. It is <br/>
illegal to change your underwear in a public restroom. It USED to be illegal <br/>
to carry a chicken in under your arm when crossing in front of the Dillon <br/>
County courthouse, but that one&#39;s off the books now. We, of course, cannot <br/>
buy alcohol on Sunday and all public bars must close at midnight Saturday <br/>
(unless they buy an expensive waiver to renewed weekly/monthly). Depending on <br/>
your county, some stores are closed on Sunday, some cannot open until 12 or <br/>
1, and some are open according to the management&#39;s wishes.<br/>

blue laws<br/>
blue laws,<br/>
legislation regulating public and private conduct, especially laws relating <br/>
to Sabbath observance. The term was originally applied to the 17th-century <br/>
laws of the theocratic New Haven colony; they were called &quot;blue laws after <br/>
the blue paper on which they were printed. New Haven and other Puritan <br/>
colonies of New England had rigid laws prohibiting Sabbath breaking, breaches <br/>
in family discipline, drunkenness, and excesses in dress. Although such <br/>
legislation had its origins in European &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/40700.html&quot;">http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/40700.html&quot;</a>&gt;Sabbatarian&lt;/A&gt; and &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/45055.html&quot;">http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/45055.html&quot;</a>&gt;sumptuary laws&lt;/A&gt;, the <br/>
term &quot;blue laws is usually applied only to American legislation. With the <br/>
dissolution of the Puritan theocracies after the American Revolution, blue <br/>
laws declined; many of them lay forgotten in state statute books only to be <br/>
revived much later. The growth of the &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/10544.html&quot;">http://www.encyclopedia.com/articles/10544.html&quot;</a>&gt;prohibition&lt;/A&gt; movement in the 19th cent. <br/>
and early 20th cent. brought with it other laws regulating private conduct. <br/>
Many states forbade the sale of cigarettes, and laws prohibited secular <br/>
amusements as well as all unnecessary work on Sunday; provision was made for <br/>
strict local censorship of books, plays, films and other means of instruction <br/>
and entertainment. Although much of this legislation has been softened if not <br/>
repealed, there are still many areas and communities in the United States, <br/>
especially those where religious fundamentalism is strong, that retain blue <br/>
laws. The Supreme Court has upheld Sunday closing laws ruling that such laws <br/>
do not interfere with the free exercise of religion and do not constitute the <br/>
establishment of a state religion.<br/>
