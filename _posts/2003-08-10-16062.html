habaneros, banana peppers, New Mexico 6-4 peppers (never heard of &#39;em), pimentos, <br/>
red and orange bells, Big Bertha Bell peppers, red hot cherry peppers, <br/>
cubanelles, and fajita bell peppers.  He just bought every variety Wal-Mart had, 2 or <br/>
3 of some, and planted them.  So what do they do with the roasted peppers and <br/>
exactly what kind of peppers would be good for roasting?  I know the <br/>
cubanelle&#39;s are good roasted.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I cut up every pepper in the house and stir fry them.  Sometimes <br/>
it&#39;s good and sometimes it&#39;s not.  :)  Roasting might be a better option.<br/>
