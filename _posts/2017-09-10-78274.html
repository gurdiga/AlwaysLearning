<div id="ygrps-yiv-311434580">If it weren’t so much work (there are 2500) it would be fun, somehow, to have all the titles listed in one place, as links.  But there’s no “one place” to see 2500 titles, either, except, you know… on the blog.  <br/>
<br/>
Here’s one month’s listing, a few years old:<br/>
<br/>
	• The beauty around you<br/>
	• Knowing peace<br/>
	• Be very engaged<br/>
	• A world of input<br/>
	• I&#39;m not guessing.<br/>
	• What kind of peace?<br/>
	• Best and highest good<br/>
	• Science experiment, festival, and a game<br/>
	• Two-way change<br/>
	• What is choice?<br/>
	• Happy choices<br/>
	• A time and a place<br/>
	• Roses and different directions<br/>
	• More and better<br/>
	• Embracing and supporting<br/>
	• Picture it clearly<br/>
	• Patient, attentive, calm and accepting<br/>
	• Respect your kids<br/>
	• Enough to share<br/>
	• Choice makes a big difference<br/>
	• A good mom<br/>
	• Gradually cooler<br/>
	• It doesn&#39;t hurt to think about it.<br/>
	• Helping one another grow<br/>
	• Don&#39;t bother<br/>
	• Avoid struggles<br/>
	• Better at understanding<br/>
	• Meditation?<br/>
	• Changes happen.<br/>
	• Patterns and angles<br/>
	• Playing with dolls<br/>
<br/>
Almost, the titles themselves could be poetically arranged, and helpful.  <br/>
<br/>
You could play with the randomizer (“Surprise  Me,” on the righthand side) or the “You might also like” that should show under each post.<br/>

<br/>
Enjoy the boost, if you’re needing one, and have fun with the photos if you’re already as peacefully energized as you can be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909319831">On that very-old page (which I restored with a Wayback Machine copy), linked in the last post, is this, from Joanna Wilkinson (who might still be in this group):<br/>
__________<br/>
When I started posting, was when I started really learning. I had read for about a year (on the AOL boards) and when I thought I finally understood enough to post, I began. That&#39;s when I went from, liking the unschooling philosophy, to actually living it.<br/>
 <br/>
Writing it out and defending my ideas was like going into light speed toward unschooling. <br/>
&quot;Ah ha&quot; moments were popping in my brain right and left. It was exhilarating.  <br/>
<br/>
I would write many posts and just delete them, because I had answered my own questions in the process. I could &quot;hear&quot; what the other posters would reply in their responses to me and knew what I needed to work on without ever hitting send. <br/>
<br/>

(I fixed a typo and put in some breaks for those reading it in 2017 instead of 2003, but I think it’s still true that writing and defending ideas is where learning happens.  Or at least writing them. Or at least reading and guessing what others will say. :-)<br/>
<br/>
In Phoenix last weekend, Jennifer Anderson spoke, and said she reads at Radical Unschooling Info when she feels she needs help—just reads ANYthing, any topic that has lots of responses.  And that as she reads she thinks, and takes in the soothing ideas, and I hope if that’s not what she meant that she will be here and clarify.<br/>
