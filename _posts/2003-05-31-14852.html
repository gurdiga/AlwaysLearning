<div id="ygrps-yiv-405224097">Holly LOVES weddings, and we got her into this one, including the rehearsal <br/>
dinner, by playing the music.   IF anyone&#39;s interested (it wouldn&#39;t hurt my <br/>
feelings if you weren&#39;t!) or if anyone went to UNM and wants to look at the <br/>
Alumni chapel, or if anyone does SCA or Ren stuff and wants to look at costumes, <br/>
there&#39;s that.<br/>

<br/>
we were standing across from each other, in the fourth row (I think) and did <br/>
three pieces (procession, candle-lighting and recession), elaborately with <br/>
changing harmonies.  First The Ash Grove, for candles the tune Maddy Prior and <br/>
June Tabor used for &quot;The Seven Wonders&quot; on the Silly Sisters album, and for <br/>
recessional a ballad tune.  The words are not at all wedding-like, but few there <br/>
knew which ballad it was.  (It&#39;s about a woman drowning a guy who tried to kill <br/>
her for her clothes and steal her horse. &lt;g&gt;  But musically it&#39;s great. )  We <br/>
followed the minister out, playing still, but stayed inside the church <br/>
because had we gone outside playing, the wondrous acoustics of that little chapel <br/>
would have turned to the sudden thinness of playing in the great outdoors.  So <br/>
we used the chapel as an amplifier, even after people were outside doing the <br/>
sword-arch thing.  It was a big adobe Renaissance boom box.<br/>
<br/>
Because we wear 11th century costumes &quot;in real life,&quot; we had  no snazzy 17th <br/>
century stuff, but hey, we matched. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
For the reception later, we played a Bouree from Terpsichore by Praetorius.<br/>
I&#39;m playing it at the homeschooling talent show in SC, too, but won&#39;t have <br/>
Keith to harmonize off of.<br/>

Nothing came up for the 17th but I tried the 18th and found them.  This<br/>
would be a fun wedding to attend.<br/>
