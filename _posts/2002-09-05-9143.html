<div id="ygrps-yiv-336865908">When I was about 10 or so I read a book about a girl named Elspeth who (after <br/>
her parents died) took her little brother from their home in either Ireland <br/>
or Scotland to Liverpool. From there they got on a boat to Canada and went to <br/>
either Manitoba or Saskatchewan as pioneers. I really want to find this book <br/>
again! The copy I read had a picture of a girl and a little boy standing on a <br/>
ship deck against the railing. Anyone know what book I am talking about? <br/>
Title? <br/>
Thanks!<br/>
