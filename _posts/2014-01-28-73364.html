<div id="ygrps-yiv-955584097"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;line-height:107%;">I
am looking for a thread that I believe was on this forum. &nbsp;The subject was about an unschooler getting in to the Institute of Art and Design, Chicago - I *think*. &nbsp;The school location doesn&#39;t matter so much.&nbsp; What I am most interested in is the application
process I read about. &nbsp;I vaguely remember
a portfolio and an alternative to submitting a formal high school transcript. (essay maybe?)&nbsp; It stood out in my mind
as being an example of a very creative approach.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Can anyone help?<br>
