&lt;&lt;   Maybe we could share ideas for living lightly. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I would love ideas for folks right in the city. There is obvious <br/>
environmental stuff we can do, like recycle, ride our bikes etc..<br/>
But I&#39;d love ideas on how to make our home and property more self sustaining <br/>
and also how to get off the power grid in town!! We&#39;ve talked about doing <br/>
some solar stuff but I don&#39;t know anyone else that has done this in <br/>
town....anyone?<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
