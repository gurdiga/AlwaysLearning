<div id="ygrps-yiv-420072776">I was a very serious college student, mostly because of abject poverty and<br/>
being desperately tired all of the time because of working at least one job<br/>
and going to college full time.<br/>
<br/>
Then I went into a very serious profession- social work.<br/>
<br/>
The greatest gifts of my life was first meeting my husband who managed to<br/>
re-ignite my sense of fun and then my children who helped me resuscitate<br/>
 that sense of wonder about the world that children have.<br/>
<br/>
 When I looked at them as older toddlers/young children, I did NOT want<br/>
them to be forced to put that sense of  wonder and curiosity away so that<br/>
they could conform to the arbitrary standards in a classroom.  From there,<br/>
I discovered unschooling and finally radical unschooling.  So I guess it<br/>
was (at least in part) my urge to keep all of that fun at home in the<br/>
family that lead to homeschooling.  Huh!<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; In the chat on Wednesay the 15th, we were talking about words that can<br/>
&gt; cause problems.  We were discussing &quot;just.&quot;   I want to take a tangent,<br/>
&gt; thought, from something I wrote:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Sandra Dodd*: So treating children as whole people and not &quot;just kids&quot;<br/>
&gt; is good.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Sandra Dodd*: That&#39;s one of the cruelist minimalizations: He&#39;s just a<br/>
&gt; child.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Sandra Dodd*: But then… when I got used to being more respectful of<br/>
&gt; children, I bristled when an adult told another adult &quot;you&#39;re being<br/>
&gt; childish.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; *Sandra Dodd*:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m reading Alan Cumming&#39;s memoir *Not My Father&#39;s Son*.  He and his<br/>
&gt; brother were abused and terrorized, growing up, by a mean and physical dad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Nearly halfway through the book (page 124) he talks about the relief he<br/>
&gt; felt after he and his brother, when they were in their 30&#39;s, I think,<br/>
&gt; finally  meeting and talking with their dad about that childhood.  it<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t go well, and for sixteen years after that, there was no contact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;ll quote most of a page:<br/>
&gt; _______________________<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ...the ensuing silence and absence of him from our lives because of this<br/>
&gt; confrontation enabled us both to move on.  We both felt a freedom from his<br/>
&gt; legacy, and a clarity, that we had never before experienced.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For me, I found myself embracing the childhood I felt I had missed.   My<br/>
&gt; flat began to fill with games I had either played as a boy or lusted<br/>
&gt; after.  I discovered I loved the color yellow and so I had all my walls<br/>
&gt; painted in a bright shade of it.  I saw a large floor lamp in the shape of<br/>
&gt; a daffodil, and I had to have it. I bought action figures from TV shows of<br/>
&gt; my youth and placed them in pride of place on my mantlepiece.  i started to<br/>
&gt; collect marbles again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I realized that I was living my life backwards.  I had to be a grown-up<br/>
&gt; when I&#39;d been a little boy, and now I was tending to the little boy inside<br/>
&gt; who&#39;d never had the chance to properly play.  I didn&#39;t question it.  I went<br/>
&gt; with it.  I liked it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I am referred to often as having a childlike quality, or being pixielike.<br/>
&gt; At first, when these sorts of descriptions began to be attributed to me, I<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t like them.  Childhood for me had such negativie connotations that<br/>
&gt; the idea that I was in some way overly connected to that time in my life<br/>
&gt; was a cuase for concern, not celebration.  *Why* was I so childlike?  Was<br/>
&gt; I in some way emotionally retarded, trapped, trying desperately to<br/>
&gt; reconfigure my past before I could move on?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Eventually I began to feel more comfortable with it all.  Childlike, I<br/>
&gt; realized, tends to mean open, joyous, maybe a bit mishievous, and I am<br/>
&gt; happy to have all those qualities.<br/>
&gt; _________________________________<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some adults have an inability to play—to be playful, or light-hearted.<br/>
&gt; Unschooling parents need to be able to play.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Some might go too far, and want to quit their jobs and not take<br/>
&gt; responsibility for providing well for their family—that&#39;s not what I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; recommending.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I suppose &quot;childish&quot; can be a deserved warning.<br/>
&gt; Child*like*, though, has the potential to be a very good thing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Do you know quotes or stories about benefits of adults maintaining<br/>
&gt; attributes usually considered &#39;childish&#39;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; A couple of links on my site that come to mind (not for quotes, but for<br/>
&gt; anyone new to these discussion who might want to read more):<br/>
