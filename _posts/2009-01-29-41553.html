<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635218828">I think this is such an interesting story.<br/>
The woman who wrote the article below for a nyc blog called mommypoppins.com is <br/>
definitely not an unschooler, but you will get the beauty of it.<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to take my ds to the show.<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;ve probably already heard about the Calder Exhibit at the Whitney. It&#39;s been promoted <br/>
a lot. People love Calder&#39;s Circus, which is a miniature reproduction of an actual circus, <br/>
made from wire, cork, wood, cloth and other household objects. Calder would perform the <br/>
circus for people as his &quot;day job&quot; and the exhibit has videos showing how he performed it, <br/>
bringing it to life for kids.<br/>
One of the things that I love about the Alexander Calder story is something I learned <br/>
about him on a PBS American Masters program. Apparently, when he was a child, all <br/>
Calder wanted to do was play with wire. He loved to make little toys and things with scraps <br/>
of wire and his mother completely indulged this. I love this story because as a parent, we <br/>
all know that child who refuses to do what they are supposed to do and is obsessed with <br/>
one seemingly useless endeavor. How aggravating it is to try to bend children to our will <br/>
and get them to conform to the requirements of society. I love the idea that there is value <br/>
in the play of children and their obsessions and that, let to flower and grow, we may all be <br/>
surprised by what comes out of them.<br/>
Why kids will like Calder: The Paris Years<br/>
Calder exemplifies the mystique of the artist as a child who never grew up. His work is <br/>
whimsical, imaginative and fun. Of course, kids will be drawn to the Circus piece, which is <br/>
basically a big (beautiful) toy, and watching a grown man play with it is even more fun. But <br/>
children also like Calder&#39;s wire portraits for that same whimsy and imagination. They are <br/>
child-like, innocent and puzzling. And of course his mobiles are so popular for children, <br/>
they became a nursery staple.<br/>
<br/>
What to do and talk about:<br/>
Puzzle over the fact that Calder invented the mobile. Really, something that we have in our <br/>
rooms at home started out as an art object, invented by an artist? Cool.<br/>
After being inspired by how Alexander Calder uses everyday objects to create new things <br/>
and his inventiveness Children may be inspired to try their own inventions and creations. <br/>
Buy a little bit of wire or use other household items to create your own animals, people, <br/>
circus or anything you feel inspired to do. Or if you&#39;re not a do-it-yourselfer try a wire art <br/>
kit, which has everything kids need to make colorful jewelry or other fun stuff from wire.<br/>
There&#39;s also an exhibit of Calder&#39;s jewelry at the Metropolitan Museum of Art that might <br/>
make a nice counterpoint for a second trip</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1268494529">The show sounds great, but this quote was amusing:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; -=-Children may be inspired to try their own inventions and creations.<br/>
&gt; Buy a little bit of wire or use other household items to create your  <br/>
&gt; own animals, people,<br/>
&gt; circus or anything you feel inspired to do. Or if you&#39;re not a do-it- <br/>
&gt; yourselfer try a wire art<br/>
&gt; kit, which has everything kids need to make colorful jewelry or  <br/>
&gt; other fun stuff from wire.-=-<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That kinda misses the point.  YES, if a child wants to try it, great.<br/>
But I can picture lots of moms saying &quot;Put down that Lego/violin/ <br/>
videogame/Barbie and come and make something with this wire!&quot;<br/>
