<div id="ygrps-yiv-2006189534">I hate to even say this outloud but I was self abusive until I was able to cope with the sexual abuse I had been victim too.  My sister in law too.  Same reason.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1612823919">No offense taken at all.  I can honestly say she is not being abused. <br/>
 I&#39;m with her and her 3 sisters 24/7.   They don&#39;t do things with their <br/>
dad and the only people they&#39;re with, w/out me, are grandparents and <br/>
then it&#39;s as a group and not overnight.  I agree that sexual abuse is a <br/>

Hi Heidi,<br/>
<br/>
She sounds similar to my son, though he just turned 12.  He&#39;ll sometimes say things like this when he is frustrated, though he will say it rather nonchalantly, not angrily.  For example when something goes badly wrong in a video game he&#39;s playing he&#39;ll sometimes remark in frustration &quot;I want to kill myself&quot;, though I don&#39;t recall him really being physically abusive to himself.<br/>
<br/>
He met once with a psychologist through school when he was 7 and she felt that he just didn&#39;t have the appropriate words to express his feelings.  I was a bit unsure about that because his vocabulary was very good, but I noticed that he does have a hard time figuring out his own feelings, sensations etc.  If that makes any sense.  He has a hard time answering questions at the doctors for example about how he&#39;s feeling.  I usually will watch for signs and symptoms he mentions and write them down before we go.  Even when I ask if he&#39;s hungry he&#39;ll say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; and I&#39;ll say &quot;Well, take a moment to check your stomach and see&quot;, or something along those lines to prompt him to listen to his body messages.<br/>
<br/>
I too find it upsetting when he talks like that but I focus on rephrasing what he&#39;s really feeling: &quot;that is really frustrating&quot; or &quot;boy, I can see why that makes you angry&quot;.  Now that he&#39;s older I will call more attention to it: &quot;Do you really mean that or are you just frustrated?&quot;  And once in a while I&#39;ll mention that it scares me and it would be helpful if he could say specifically what he is feeling instead.  It doesn&#39;t happen often, only when he gets really frustrated, and he throws the comment out and then he&#39;s back to what he was doing.  Or he moves to a new activity.  It bothers me enough that I really pay extra attention for any other clues that he is unhappy, but mostly he&#39;s excited about his games or humming away to himself as he plays in the basement with his stuff and his fave music on in the background.  He just seems really, really happy!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if any of this helps but I do understand how upsetting it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1466670077">Thanks Pam.  I&#39;ve been thinking about all the times she&#39;s said these <br/>
things lately and it&#39;s always when she frustrated and upset.  She spends <br/>
all her time with an 18 mnth old, a 6 yr old and an 8 yr old, so I know <br/>
she&#39;s always trying to keep up with the older girls and gets upset when <br/>
she can&#39;t do want they do just they way they do it.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked her last night, when she was happily hanging out with me, if she <br/>
thought she would ever really hurt herself and she said no.  I guess <br/>
I&#39;ll just keep doing what I&#39;m doing by gently supporting her.  I very <br/>
much hesitate to get &quot;professional&quot; help because it would make her feel <br/>
like something was wrong with her and I also don&#39;t want any of my <br/>
children labeled in any way.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your thoughts on this.   Heidi<br/>

&gt;Yesterday, after she Soleille ran through her list of all the awful stuff she was going to do to herself, I asked her if she wanted to have a rest.  She ended up sleeping for an hour and a half.  The trick, I think, is getting her to rest without it seeming like a time-out or a punishment.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2143974236">I wish I knew where it came from.  I&#39;ve searched his whole life looking for something I&#39;ve done or said to make him have these feelings.  He has always been really sensitive emotionally and I guess it stems from that.  It just makes me really sad that he feels like he needs to be punished.  I really hope I never did anything to make him feel that way.<br/>

other way).  My earliest memory of wanting to hurt myself was <br/>
actually in Jr. high school, when I was first afflicted with severe <br/>
depression.  I had thoughts of killing myself and sometimes I did <br/>
small acts like scratching myself.  Even now, if I am feeling very <br/>
depressed about something I will have thoughts of harming myself. I <br/>
have thought about why I have this tendency, and what I have come up <br/>
with is that in those moments I have such strong feelings of hurt or <br/>
anger or frustration that the only way I could possibly get another <br/>
person to understand is by hurting myself.  I have had thoughts <br/>
about how if I slit my wrists then maybe people would realize how <br/>
bad my emotional pain is.  When I think about this, as I am typing, <br/>
I think it seems strange and crazy and doesn&#39;t make any sense, but <br/>
in the moment of strong emotional turmoil I seem to think it would <br/>
be a good idea.  I have never tried to commit suicide, I have only <br/>
done minor things to inflict pain on myself, like claw or scratch <br/>
myself, and then only RARELY.  I don&#39;t understand why I feel the <br/>
need to express my strong emotions this way.  I don&#39;t blame it on my <br/>
parents, they were wonderful.  I tend to think it is part of my <br/>
temprament.  I am very intense and negavtive feelings, even now as <br/>
an adult, can overwhelm me.<br/>
I don&#39;t recall having these feelings as a child, but I also never <br/>
experienced depression until I was older (15 or so). I guess it <br/>
might be good to see if your child has depression, but then again I <br/>
too would be nervous about taking my child into a therapist, <br/>
although with her being only 3 1/2 she probably won&#39;t think much of <br/>
it.  It might just seem to her like any other doctor visit.  <br/>
Anyway,<br/>
this is my experience, and I don&#39;t know if it is helpful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-504351578">First, having experienced the down side to therepy (for me as a teen) I would <br/>
warn against it. depending on who the therapist is and their experiences it <br/>
can be very harmful. <br/>
<br/>
My son went through years of similiar behavior and our doctor (also a friend <br/>
of the family who shares his honest opinion and gut feeling and not what he <br/>
has to say to cover his butt)  advised we ride it out and that it would end. <br/>
It&#39;s difficult but the more you react the worse it probably will be. If you feel <br/>
films are influencing this I&#39;d say to stop showing the films around <br/>
her....perhaps they are too much for her to handle as these kids tend to be quite <br/>
sensitive and this is her way of processing what she&#39;s feeling and experiencing.<br/>
<br/>
A great website that might be helpful is the naturalchild.org w/a wealth of <br/>
info, articles and links and actually the woman who runs it, Jan Hunt...is a <br/>
wonderful person and a therapist who you may find to be helpful. She does very <br/>
reasonbably priced phone consults and she&#39;s about helping you adjust your own <br/>
behaviour and how that relates to your children. I have not used her services, <br/>
though, personally...although I have thought about it. I feel Jan is a very <br/>
rare and kind person and children are her number one priority...period.<br/>
<br/>
I recently wrote an article that you may find helpful. It was created for a <br/>
non-profit that educates parents and schools on alternatives to hitting, but <br/>
there are some tips and more sources you might find helpful. Email me and I&#39;m <br/>
happy to send it to you.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps.<br/>
Hang in there,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662051379">Thank you, Miranda, for sharing this.  I actually think I may have found <br/>
a way to show my daughter just how hard it is for others to watch her <br/>
hurt herself.  Things seem to be a little better and now she&#39;s thinking <br/>
of the natural consequences of hurting herself before she does it.  I <br/>
don&#39;t know what the future will bring, but I know to look for signs in <br/>
her for anger and hopefully can teach her how to head it off and deal <br/>
with it in a healthy way.  Thanks again.   Heidi<br/>
