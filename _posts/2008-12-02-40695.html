<div id="ygrps-yiv-254975620">6. Don&#39;t worry about how fast or slow they are learning. Don&#39;t test  <br/>
them to see if they are &quot;up to speed.&quot; If you nurture them in a  <br/>
supportive environment, your children will grow and learn at their  <br/>
own speed, and you can trust in that process. They are like seeds  <br/>
planted in good earth, watered and fertilized. You don&#39;t keep digging  <br/>
up the seeds to see if the roots are growingï¿½that disrupts the  <br/>
natural growing process. Trust your children in the same way you  <br/>
trust seeds to sprout and seedlings to develop into strong and  <br/>
healthy plants.<br/>
