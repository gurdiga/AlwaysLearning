&lt;&lt; ** I was just thinking today how glad I was to be unschooling because my<br/>
 kids <br/>
 can dress how they want. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
YES!  My kids had me buy several colors of the hairspray paint. We keep it <br/>
with the art supplies and they pull some out whenever they feel like having <br/>
colorful hair for the day.<br/>
Thank goodnes that unschooling gives them the freedom to express their <br/>
uniqueness in many, many ways.<br/>

&gt;My 13 ds would have to cut off his dreadlocks (shave his head) if he went to<br/>
&gt;school around here, according to the neighborhood kids.<br/>
&gt;   Has there been a discussion about &quot;haircut codes&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It just amazes me that all this garbage is coming back.  When I was in high <br/>
school, we still couldn&#39;t wear pants or go barefoot, and the boys&#39; hair <br/>
couldn&#39;t touch their collar.  No beards for the boys either.  I clearly <br/>
remember my music teacher arguing that males had to earn the right to grow <br/>
a beard.  I guess what he really meant was earn the right not to have to <br/>
shave it off.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
