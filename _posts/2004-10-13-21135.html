also likes &quot;Wake Up Snoozer&quot;, it&#39;s a Hamtaro game, and the Jr. &quot;I Spy&quot; <br/>

I&#39;m wondering if anyone has any recommendations for software for a 4 <br/>
yr. old - we have Reader Rabbit, but not much else.  He has played <br/>
Curious George at the library and liked that quite a bit but I&#39;d like <br/>
to buy him something that he doesn&#39;t have access to from the library.  <br/>
Any suggestions?  Thanks so much,<br/>
