<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078475668">Thanks for the post!  Mike (13s) watched with me.  He wanted to know <br/>
more about Hubbel, so Googled it ... which lead him to wonder about <br/>
black holes ... which lead him to www.howthingswork.com ... after <br/>
reading until he was satiated with black holes ... he&#39;s now gone on <br/>
into cloning.  MAN ... I love how self learning works!  Thanks again <br/>
for the cool site.  Deborah</div>
