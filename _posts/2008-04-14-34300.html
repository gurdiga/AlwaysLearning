<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255662862">Some random thoughts that I had this weekend while my parents visited<br/>
us in DC (both of our families are originally from upsate NY but we<br/>
moved to DC while my husband goes to business school).<br/>
<br/>
I have been discussing a lot of ideas with my mom. She is my sounding<br/>
board -- always listens, always supporting... She is a teacher (I had<br/>
her for 2 years in highschool for math!) and I was also a teacher for<br/>
4 years before my daughter was born. My mom actually was the first one<br/>
to say to me that she thought I should think about homeschooling<br/>
because I would &quot;be so good at it&quot; (definitely more of a schooly<br/>
mentality). My reaction at the time, was &quot;why would I do that?!?&quot; Now<br/>
I&#39;m thinking about it but it is not exactly what she had in mind :-)<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, we were discussing some parenting things and she said once<br/>
again that she feels like &quot;as long as you love them (your kids) they<br/>
will turn out ok&quot;. She also mentioned once again how much she did<br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; and how happy she is with how things went with my sister and<br/>
I. The things that she did &quot;wrong&quot; were things like rocking me to<br/>
sleep, letting me nap in a swing etc. It was the first time that I<br/>
said, &quot;Mom, what I&#39;M saying is that those things WERE NOT wrong!&quot; It<br/>
is so funny how even after all this time she labels them wrong....<br/>
even when she sees me doing things the way I am.<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t say it to her but I disagree with the statement &quot;as long<br/>
as you love them&quot; for a few reasons. First of all I think that almost<br/>
ALL parents love their children (maybe on different levels?) and that<br/>
definitely does not mean that all parents are doing a great job.<br/>
Second of all, I like to believe that the choices we make really do<br/>
make a difference in our lives and our children&#39;s lives. I think that<br/>
my mom did many of the attachment parenting things without<br/>
knowing/labeling. My sister and I never really rebelled! And her and I<br/>
have always had a great relationship.... I understand her desire to<br/>
not JUDGE others because I really try not to do that too (and don&#39;t<br/>
enjoy the feeling when others are doing it to me!) -- but on some<br/>
level I know that I do because I feel so strongly about the choices I<br/>
am making... any thoughts?</div>

<br/>
I get so mad when I hear people say this, especially when their parenting<br/>
style is SO different than mine!  I&#39;ve put so much thought into what I do as<br/>
a parent.  I read and I research and I ask myself and others ALL SORTS of<br/>
questions, so that I can be the best parent that I can be!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read &quot;Freakonomics?&quot;  One of the conclusions the authors make is<br/>
that it really doesn&#39;t matter what we do as parents, just that we care<br/>
enough to get involved.  I think this is something that I can hear and then<br/>
ignore.  Even if this is true, it is not really useful to know.  If we think<br/>
that it doesn&#39;t matter, and we stop caring about the decisions we are<br/>
making, then we&#39;ve just become the type of parents that don&#39;t make<br/>
thoughtful decisions, which (according to them) is what makes us good<br/>
parents in the first place.<br/>

ok&quot;. Not sure that&#39;s true either but it&#39;s closer!<br/>
<br/>
Parents can do all sorts of horrible things in the name of love. But  <br/>
unless it feels like love to the child -- not just &quot;I&#39;m doing this  <br/>
because I love you!&quot; -- it isn&#39;t going to be reacted to as love.<br/>
<br/>
Parents control tightly because they love their kids and don&#39;t want  <br/>
them to come to harm. But it feels like distrust. It feels like the  <br/>
parents wants are important and the child&#39;s wants are wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can push their kids to succeed academically so they can be  <br/>
the best they can be. And the children feel inadequate and only  <br/>
acceptable when they perform in the way that pleases their parents.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not love if it doesn&#39;t feel like love.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>There&#39;s judging someone&#39;s actions and judging. I tend to think  <br/>
everyone does what they believe is right for them. From their point  <br/>
of view, from their understanding. But that doesn&#39;t make them right!  <br/>
Even someone who is hurting others to get relief from some huge hurt  <br/>
that was done to them throughout their childhood feels they&#39;re right  <br/>
in some way. If you could get inside their heads you could understand  <br/>
why they choose to hurt, *but* understanding doesn&#39;t mean they  <br/>
couldn&#39;t be making way better choices. It doesn&#39;t make their actions  <br/>
right. It doesn&#39;t make their choices right.<br/>

  I hear this a lot, and I also hear the antithesis re. permissive... &quot;if parents cared, they wouldn&#39;t let them do that&quot;.  It&#39;s why I&#39;ve struggled to go whole-heartedly into non-coercive parenting...I always hear that negative voice in my head that it equals &quot;not caring or not loving&quot;.  I like what Joyce had to say about if it doesn&#39;t FEEL like love, it&#39;s not received as love.  <br/>

They&#39;re not the same thing.  Some things might look the same, but the  <br/>
basis is different and the principles are different in some ways.  I  <br/>
will  be persuasive if  I think one of my kids (or friends) is  <br/>
missing an important angle.  I will never &quot;be permissive&quot; where  <br/>
&quot;permissive&quot; is taken to mean &quot;Whatever; I don&#39;t care what you do.&quot;<br/>

  By permissive, I just meant giving permission all the time where I used to say NO most of the time...not in a &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot; way, but in a mindful way, so to me it is interchangeable in that context.  I know that some people take it as &quot;I don&#39;t care&quot; and that&#39;s what I was trying to explain....that I hear that negative voice when I want to give permission, but am trying to mindfully give permission and overcome that voice :)  Thank you for the reminder to be more specific.  <br/>
