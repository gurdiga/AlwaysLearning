<div id="ygrps-yiv-111931547">I saved this but don&#39;t remember where I first posted it.<br/>
Last night I was feeling uncomfortable about the tone of all these  <br/>
discussions, but I do believe that parents must become unschooling  <br/>
parents, and that makes the difference.<br/>
====================================================================<br/>
<br/>
&quot; Your sense of self will cease unexpectedly. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
I got this &quot;fortune&quot; from a Neopets &quot;Island Mystic.&quot;  It&#39;s a column  <br/>
A, column B, column C random construct, I&#39;m sure, but I thought it  <br/>
was interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Just this morning while doing dishes I was thinking about the simple  <br/>
but serious dilemma involved with discussing unschooling, which is (I  <br/>
think, this morning) that some people want to do it without changing  <br/>
themselves or their families or their relationships and others  <br/>
believe that the change is what does it altogether.<br/>
<br/>
And I was thinking about philosophy (the idea of it) and spirituality  <br/>
(the reality of the effect of spirituality) and was thinking about  <br/>
the brain research that says there&#39;s a place in your brain that is  <br/>
stimulated during meditation or prayer, and that the sense of being  <br/>
one with the universe has a physical (physical meaning biochemical,  <br/>
so physical on a cellular level) reality.<br/>
<br/>
Probably feeling &quot;one with&quot; one&#39;s children is some of that.  Probably  <br/>
the difference between feeling adversarial (separate and &quot;right&quot; or  <br/>
martyred or resentful) and feeling that you are your child&#39;s partner  <br/>
and ally has something to do with that part of the brain.<br/>
<br/>
And if so, this all probably has something to do with Howard  <br/>
Gardner&#39;s intrapersonal intelligence (knowledge of self) and the  <br/>
proposed-but-not-fully-accepted intelligence being referred to as  <br/>
metaphysical or spiritual.<br/>
<br/>
Then my dishes were clean and I stopped thinking about it, until I  <br/>
was playing Neopets and wondering whether the unexpected cessation of  <br/>
one&#39;s sense of self was a bad thing, or maybe kind of a good thing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Maybe with other practices, but with Zen, that IS it.<br/>
You can do a lot of other explanations (and it takes all that to<br/>
really understand Zen) but at the crux of it, it&#39;s the art of<br/>
&quot;nothingness&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something Osho said about it:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Dhyana means a state of no-mind--no concentration, no contemplation,<br/>
no meditation, in fact--just silence, a deep, profound silence where<br/>
all thoughts have disappeared.  When there is no ripple in the lake of<br/>
consciousness; the consciousness is functioning just like a mirror<br/>
reflecting all that is--the stars, the trees, the birds, the people,<br/>
all that is--simply reflecting without any interpretation, without<br/>
bringing in any prejudices.<br/>
<br/>
The state of &quot;no-mind&quot; or loss of self is the ultimate in enlightenment.<br/>
<br/>
But it takes a whole lot more explaining to get that core of Zen.<br/>
<br/>
And I&#39;m talking about Zen as pure Zen...not the religion.<br/>
<br/>
And I didn&#39;t mean to go OT....<br/>
