<div id="ygrps-yiv-1906940635">She doesnt need a kit, unless the convenience of having it prepared (all the stuff bought, strips cut, etc. outways the fact that she would be paying 5 or more what the stuff costs).   She would probably appreciate having another person to help -- I have known people who did their own entirely, but it would seem pretty awkward to me.  A friend did mine. <br/>
<br/>
Get the plaster strips at a crafts supply store (I&#39;ve been told you can also get them at a medical supply store) and if she wants some plaster to smooth it down, get it at a Home Depot kind of place.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-216222920">I made one. I didn&#39;t use a kit. It is really not hard, you just have <br/>
to have someone who can work fast. I bought the cheesecloth that has <br/>
plaster in it. You just dip it in water and smooth over the tummy as <br/>
you go. I had my husband and Chloe do it. They did a great job. It <br/>
is really messy, but so fun. I&#39;m so glad we did it. I still have to <br/>
paint it. It is on my &quot;to do&quot; list :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Dh and I made a belly cast when I was pregnant.  I<br/>
just used gauze strips and plaster of paris.  It<br/>
turned out great.  It was messy but fairly easy.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t do belly casting but did do breast casting.  Got some left over cast <br/>
material from the emergency room.  If you know someone there it is the best <br/>
place to save some money.  They cut off what they need for a cast then the rest <br/>
is thrown away.  It is never touched by a patient but it is cut off pieces, <br/>
usually about 6-8 inches in length.  But great for casting.  I just sprayed <br/>
some of that spray cooking oil on myself then put some of the strips in warm <br/>
water and casted away until it was a few layers thick.  By the time I got to the <br/>
last layer it had started so set so I just pulled it off and let it set a while <br/>
before I did anything with it.  <br/>
<br/>
For the breast casting I tore up one of my old BDU shirts (Jackson and I met <br/>
in the Army) then decoupaged the little pieces onto the casting.  Also my name <br/>
tag and insignia etc on it.  Then gave it to Jackson for a birthday present. <br/>
<br/>
It really isn&#39;t that hard.  You can also buy that casting stuff.  Not sure <br/>
how much it is.<br/>

There are kits you can buy online; <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.bellycast.com/">http://www.bellycast.com/</a> only something <br/>
like $22.00, and all you have to do is grease yourself up and have someone put <br/>
the plaster strips on you. The *how to* section says that you will need help <br/>
as it is almost impossible to put the strips on without making wrinkles. Renee&#39; <br/>
was just wondering if she could just buy plaster strips at a hobby store and <br/>
do it herself. This site (one of many) tells exactly how to do it. I&#39;m <br/>
guessing that she could do it with her husbands help. She was just wondering if I <br/>
knew anyone who has done it. I have seen them, and I think they are great. One I <br/>
saw had the mothers hands on her belly cast too. Most are just a cast of the <br/>
belly and chest. Renee&#39; is going to bring it down with her if she does it, and <br/>
we are going to paint it or maybe decoupage it. I think they are a beautiful <br/>
keepsake. Let me know if you do one!<br/>

have someone else do it for you, I&#39;d think.<br/>

You paint them, or decoupage them, or leave them plain, or... and many people <br/>
display them. The one&#39;s I have seen are just beautiful. It is a lovely <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-959642238">Ok, I just have to jump in on this one!<br/>
The plaster bandaging is inexpensive, yes. But it does not give you a high quality casting! If you want a professional grade casting, visit life casting (online) and check out their kits and truly professional grade materials. Once you get the idea of how it&#39;s done, you may want to check out the casting materials (probably under sculpting) at Dick Blick art supplies. <br/>
A really good casting shows every little detail, the belly button and everything look perfect. Plus it is made of a material that is of archival quality and will last forever.<br/>
But if that isn&#39;t your goal and you just want something cheap and easy, do the plaster bandaging yourself. Just use vaseline smeared over your belly first. If you really build it up thick enough, you could even use the mold to pour some material into for a more detailed cast of your belly.<br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.artmolds.com/">http://www.artmolds.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Using a small kit at lifecasting (artmolds) you can get some really beautiful hand casts. Be sure to check out their pictures of complete body castings...very cool!  This is an area of art I want to explore in depth. I&#39;d like to work my way up to doing body castings...we&#39;ll see.<br/>
