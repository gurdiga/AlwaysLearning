<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260325277">This list isn&#39;t for selling things.  If someone has something to sell, MAYBE <br/>
if you can&#39;t resist, put a note saying &quot;I have some things to sell, e-mail me <br/>
if you&#39;re interested,&quot; but three posts listing things with prices seems to be <br/>
something that will not make the over-400 list members more glad to be on this <br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to make a rule against selling things. <br/>
I want list members to understand the principle that the list exists to <br/>
discuss unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want to be unfriendly, but I&#39;d like for others to consider the <br/>
friendly-factor when they decide how to use the list too.   <br/>
