<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391598151">Dear Sharon,<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s very Optimistic of you.  And kind.<br/>
<br/>
But I am fully aware that I stayed away from the<br/>
pursuit on purpose.  Being forced to write about<br/>
issues that didn&#39;t interest me made me not want to<br/>
write at all ...   and eventually to come to avoid it<br/>
entirely.<br/>
<br/>
I have addressed writing Specifically.   But the same<br/>
statements could be applied to any course of study<br/>
that is coerced and involuntary.  Golfing, knitting,<br/>
reading, cooking, ...   <br/>
<br/>
My G__,  I imagine even Talking could become an<br/>
activity to loathe and run from if you were<br/>
&quot;instructed&quot; in how to do it &quot;properly&quot;.  And if <br/>
every time you opened your mouth some &quot;expert&quot; opined<br/>
on your every word.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I believe writing is as well learned as reading and<br/>
speaking are by example.  By reading , being read to,<br/>
and developing a personal and positive relationship<br/>
with letters, sounds, words, literature and finally<br/>
putting it together as the individual feels<br/>
comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t sit our children down at the table on the day<br/>
they are born and begin instructing them on the rules<br/>
of language.  They learn to speak by speaking and<br/>
being around those who speak well is the best teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Walking is learned by doing it.  By gradually<br/>
mastering the steps that lead to it.  Not by reading<br/>
about them or being lectured on them.  Having a hand<br/>
to hold every now and then works wonders.  Being<br/>
talked at about what is the&quot;correct&quot; way to walk would<br/>
be as useless as instruction in most pursuits is. <br/>
Maybe knowledge of the activity would be advanced, but<br/>
the do-er still has to find her own way.<br/>
<br/>
That is the perspective I was coming from.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Dear Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I hate that you seem to have taken this personally.<br/>
The examples you have listed below could apply just as<br/>
easily.  If I spend time around an accomplished<br/>
calligrapher or read about it and am fascinated,<br/>
become interested , begin practicing the techniques<br/>
and ASK for instruction then that is the perfect time<br/>
for the accomplished one to offer it.<br/>
<br/>
The same would be true for any art, music, dance,<br/>
etc......<br/>
(Brick laying or shoe selling for that matter.)<br/>
<br/>
The harm is in the involuntary &quot;educating&quot;.  The<br/>
mandatory and proscribed &quot;methods&quot; used in teaching<br/>
tend to kill the joy and render the student<br/>
irrelevant.<br/>
<br/>
That any writing could be viewed apart from its<br/>
content will never make sense to me.  Maybe this is a<br/>
very personal view. But without the idea or<br/>
perspective coming across, it&#39;s just a waste of time<br/>
and paper.  There are better uses for trees than that.<br/>
Writing is about Expression.  Techniques and rules<br/>
can&#39;t stand alone.<br/>
<br/>
I think that writing ought to be reserved for those<br/>
who have something to say.  Reading and being read to<br/>
teach much about good writing and a willing listener<br/>
will pick it up.  <br/>
<br/>
Just as &quot;late&quot; readers tend to &quot;make up&quot; for YEARS<br/>
worth of non-reading, those who write when they have a<br/>
thought worthy of penning can quickly and easily<br/>
acquire the mechanical imperatives of good writing.<br/>
<br/>
Most importantly to me, those who are not forced to<br/>
write when they have nothing to say will not be pushed<br/>
away from it out of desperation. <br/>
<br/>
I know, as anyone else here does, that your approach<br/>
to learning is a very positive one. It is clear that<br/>
you gave your students as much freedom and latitude as<br/>
the system you were functioning in allowed.  <br/>
<br/>
It is the System that I find fault with, not those who<br/>
operate within it and attempt to maintain their<br/>
Integrity. <br/>
<br/>
Any system that requires its participants to mirror<br/>
creativity with on-demand assignments is working<br/>
against itself. <br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt; That idiot teacher could do no better than mark<br/>
&gt; up my<br/>
&gt; paper for &quot;incorrect sentence structure&quot;.  Makes you<br/>
&gt; wonder if any of these teachers actually consider<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; merits of REAL Literature, with all it&#39;s rule<br/>
&gt; breaking<br/>
&gt; and original perspective.  Or, do they actually<br/>
&gt; Enjoy<br/>
&gt; the crap examples in grammar text books? &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I was teaching writing to kids I very rarely<br/>
&gt; commented on the structure <br/>
&gt; or content, because in many cases that was their<br/>
&gt; private business.  I usually <br/>
&gt; ONLY went for mechanics of writing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I&#39;m teaching beginning calligraphers, I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; want them to imagine what <br/>
&gt; a Carolingian &quot;f&quot; COULD have looked at, I want them<br/>
&gt; to learn to copy actual <br/>
&gt; period examples.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I&#39;m helping people learn to play recorder (as I<br/>
&gt; did with Kirby a couple <br/>
&gt; of nights ago), I really do want them to tongue<br/>
&gt; every note.  YES there are <br/>
&gt; exceptions galore after you learn to do it right,<br/>
&gt; but it&#39;s one thing to <br/>
&gt; choose when not to tongue, and another not to have<br/>
&gt; the skill to do it and so <br/>
&gt; just skip and claim &quot;art.&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With calligraphy, in fact there might be hundreds of<br/>
&gt; different examples of <br/>
&gt; extant Carolingian hand, with a large range of forms<br/>
&gt; of letters.  But that&#39;s <br/>
&gt; not the same as &quot;unlimited&quot; or &quot;no rules.&quot;  Some of<br/>
&gt; the most wonderful <br/>
&gt; calligraphy is someone &quot;doing a riff&quot; on some<br/>
&gt; descender, or getting way artsy <br/>
&gt; with a line ending or a capital letter.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Literature is full of exceptions.  Jazz is full of<br/>
&gt; exceptions.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But when a person is cluefree about how to do<br/>
&gt; something &quot;right,&quot; his <br/>
&gt; &quot;embellishments&quot; aren&#39;t creativity so much as<br/>
&gt; flailing around.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some people&#39;s flailing around creates art.  There<br/>
&gt; are artists and musicians <br/>
&gt; who pretty much made it up on their own.  Some have<br/>
&gt; an audience of one, <br/>
&gt; though, and are only amusing themselves.  Others<br/>
&gt; discover something that has <br/>
&gt; broader appeal.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt; Or, do they actually Enjoy<br/>
&gt; the crap examples in grammar text books?&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have always enjoyed the history of English, the<br/>
&gt; technicalities of <br/>
&gt; punctuation, the changing fashions involving word<br/>
&gt; use and style.  I&#39;ve never <br/>
&gt; expected everyone else to think it was cool, but I<br/>
&gt; actually enjoyed the crap <br/>
&gt; examples in grammar textbooks, sometime.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That said, I never once used a grammar text book<br/>
&gt; when I was teaching.  We <br/>
&gt; kept the books in their boxes at the back of the<br/>
&gt; room, and used dictionaries. <br/>
&gt;  We played games with parts of speech sometimes, and<br/>
&gt; goofed with them various <br/>
&gt; ways.  We would lay out all the synonyms we could<br/>
&gt; think of for something and <br/>
&gt; try to identify without looking them up which were<br/>
&gt; of what origin, and which <br/>
&gt; were the oldest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;But I am certain that the passion I have for<br/>
&gt; the written word was long delayed due to those years<br/>
&gt; of forced writing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;Shame on them.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not ashamed for using writing to help people<br/>
&gt; write.  Our usual in-class <br/>
&gt; writing system was that they were to write three<br/>
&gt; one-page (or longer) <br/>
&gt; anythings.  Little stories, reviews, opinions.  It<br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t matter.  Three <br/>
&gt; pages.  They picked the one they liked best, or<br/>
&gt; thought was the best on top, <br/>
&gt; fastened the three together and over the weekend I<br/>
&gt; read through at least all <br/>
&gt; the top pages, sometimes more.  I wasn&#39;t criticizing<br/>
&gt; their organization or <br/>
&gt; style.  That was going to get better as they just<br/>
&gt; wrote more.  I was only <br/>
&gt; looking at mechanics.  Spelling, grammar,<br/>
&gt; punctuation, sentence structure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could have collected my paycheck without doing<br/>
&gt; that.  I could have passed <br/>
&gt; out those books and gone through some dumbass<br/>
&gt; exercise every day and NEVER <br/>
&gt; worked outside my prep period, but I didn&#39;t. <br/>
&gt; Because I like writing and I <br/>
&gt; know writing is scary, I tried to help make it a<br/>
&gt; common, non-threatening, <br/>
&gt; amusing thing for them.  If they hadn&#39;t had me as an<br/>
&gt; English teacher they <br/>
&gt; would have had someone worse.  So I&#39;m not very<br/>
&gt; ashamed of the way I taught.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m somewhat ashamed that I couldn&#39;t change things<br/>
&gt; more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is interesting Melinda. My youngest son was put into speech <br/>
therapy in junior kindergarten. He was set up with a special summer <br/>
program at the hospital. He was supposed to go twice a week <br/>
throughout the summer. Upon intake, the speech pathologist did not <br/>
feel he needed intervention. She felt most of his difficulties would <br/>
self-correct. However, since the school requested the intervention <br/>
she began a program. After one week, she cut the sessions to one a <br/>
week. Then after three weeks she &quot;graduated&quot; him from the program.<br/>
<br/>
The next year in school, he was back in speech therapy within the <br/>
school system. He participated until the end of Grade One. This was <br/>
his last year of formal schooling. They kept sending home target <br/>
sounds that he was pronouncing correctly at home. I think that he was<br/>
self-conscious at school. Therefore it was more of a school related <br/>
condition than a physical difficulty. <br/>
<br/>
Granted he has a class 2 maloccusion which he needs to have <br/>
orthopedic intervention for. This has caused a little difficulty, but <br/>
I believe the school-based speech therapy drew too much attention to <br/>
the problem and did not offer solutions in respect to the skeletal <br/>
defect. He is doing much better at home. Of course!!<br/>
