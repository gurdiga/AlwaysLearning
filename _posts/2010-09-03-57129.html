<div id="ygrps-yiv-935544980">I am keeping up with the topic of being in the south and how the people treat you whether you are christian or not or what church you go to(if you do).<br/>
I have a small question if you don&#39;t mind, I am from New York and have moved here to florida in the early 90&#39;s having  found out how true it is as too whether you are accepted or not in a small town if your christian. I&#39;m not but i do have a friend that is and so much of what she says shocks me because i find it to be silly and illogical.<br/>
Like,the wine Jesus and others drank wasn&#39;t fermented and achohol drinking is a sin. Well,isn&#39;t the definition of wine fermented grapes?<br/>
They should call it grape juice right? I never dispute what she says to keep her friendship but that feels like lying to myself ya know? Like this:<br/>
She was visiting one day and my son was joking around saying he was the king of the house and she said no,your daddy is the king of the house!<br/>
How would you respond to that? <br/>

It&#39;s illogical maybe, but it&#39;s not silly.  It has all sorts of solid  <br/>
historical bases in the history of Protestantism and American morality.<br/>
<br/>
There are mentions of dancing in the Bible, too, but Baptists shun  <br/>
dancers and dancing pretty much.  My dad was pushing the envelope to  <br/>
go out and dance the two-step at honky-tonks, with his mother being as  <br/>
religious as she was.<br/>

<br/>
You must be in Northern Florida.  They say Florida isn&#39;t really &quot;the  <br/>
South.&quot;  (just joking, partly...)<br/>

<br/>
If it were me... I would just smile and change the subject politely.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe after she leaves, explain to your son (if you can; if you  <br/>
understand it) why the friend believes that way.  Don&#39;t tell him it&#39;s  <br/>
silly and illogical.  He&#39;ll know you don&#39;t agree with it, but you  <br/>
could explain her side to him so that as he gets older he can avoid  <br/>
baiting her.  Some things could be offensive and the older he gets,  <br/>
the more they will judge him by his own behavior and blame the mom.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Something I&#39;ve learned to say when another adult is &quot;correcting&quot; one if my kids is &quot;It&#39;s okay with me (if he/she does/says that).&quot; That&#39;s really circumstantial, though. There are things that are totally fine in my house but not someone else&#39;s or in public - and beyond that things that will draw the wrong kind of attention in public which *I* might be okay with under certain circumstances, but may make a friend uncomfortable. Swearing comes to mind as an example - if a friend of mine told Mo not to swear in public I wouldn&#39;t say &quot;its okay with me&quot; although I would talk about that with Mo at some point. <br/>

<br/>
If it really feels like lying, then maybe that&#39;s not a friendship worth holding on to. If you can step past the idea of lying, though, to accepting that you can&#39;t change her or her opinions and its not going to help anything to try, then the relationship might work better. Can you agree to avoid talking about religion?<br/>
