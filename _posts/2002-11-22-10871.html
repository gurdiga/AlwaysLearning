<div id="ygrps-yiv-1840455196">Someone, Ren? Posted about Gypsies earlier, was it this list?<br/>
Man, I&#39;m behind and confused.  <br/>
<br/>
My uncle married a wonderful Gypsy woman.   She was the most beautiful<br/>
and really lovely person I&#39;ve ever known.  She was funny and loving and<br/>
an amazing cook.   <br/>
He had met her Large, extended family while they were dating, but after<br/>
he proposed, he invited everyone out to dinner.   On the way they stopped<br/>
into a department store and everyone looked around and had a nice time.  <br/>
 At dinner, in the restaurant my uncle was presented with many gifts from<br/>
the various relatives, none gift wrapped &lt;g&gt; many with the price tags<br/>
still on.  Everyone was so happy and loving and thrilled to be able to<br/>
give him something.   This was 1948 or &#39;49.   Quite an evening for my<br/>
uncle.<br/>
<br/>
They were married until he died in 1993.   She died a few years later. <br/>
They had wonderful kids and a happy life and developed and maintained a<br/>
strict family policy of NO stealing.  One that could never be enforced<br/>
with the rest of her family.    Nice folks except for that one little<br/>
thing.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
One of my aunts sisters is still alive, living in California, and she<br/>
writes and calls and stays in touch with the rest of the family.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-137028108">There was a gypsy family in Espanola.  Well, the grandmother had been there <br/>
for years.  But for a while a grandson and his dad/her son were there.  He <br/>
came to school maybe four times in the course of the year, but the girls <br/>
LOVED just looking at him.<br/>
<br/>
I was interested to know that one reason people didn&#39;t want to rent to <br/>
gypsies is that they considered them dirty.  They would use the bathtubs to <br/>
store dirty laundry or some such.  But their tradition/religion says that <br/>
bathing in standing water is really bad, and only running water should be <br/>
used.  So showers are fine for them, but tubs are unuseable.<br/>
