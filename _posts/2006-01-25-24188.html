<div id="ygrps-yiv-901547935">Living in a small quiet town, I was shocked to see a large crowd of<br/>
people surrounding TV cameras at my local Winn Dixie supermarket. I<br/>
figured something really bad had happened. As I approached I<br/>
realized they were filming a television show for a new savings<br/>
concept that is being used. They were pulling people out of the<br/>
crowd to partake and the man in charge asked if I was interested.<br/>
Well I nearly fainted but thought that this was a once in a lifetime<br/>
opportunity so I agreed. We were all told to fill out shopping carts<br/>
to the top with any products that we desired. Once this was<br/>
accomplished we were given coupons for almost every item in the<br/>
carts. Then we were told to go to the check out. My bill came out to<br/>
$ 579.74 then I presented the coupons that were given to me through<br/>
this program and the final bill was only $ 26.33! For participating<br/>
the company let us keep all the groceries and items in the cart and<br/>
gave us complimentary memberships. I used mine the following week<br/>
and experienced the same huge savings. The company&#39;s website is at<br/>

that I want to share this great tip!</div>
