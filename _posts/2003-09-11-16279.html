<div id="ygrps-yiv-1194014474">Can anybody recommend on-line sites for free computer learning?  I want to learn about both computer hardware and software.  I&#39;ve tried google, but have not found the right combo of words, because I&#39;m only finding sites that charge for info.<br/>
<br/>
I bought a used computer yesterday.  It has a partitioned hard drive, whatever that means!<br/>
<br/>
The kids are having a blast with a program on it called sound recorder.  It&#39;s baxically like a tape recorder on the computer.  They are using it in combo with the karaoke machine and also playing that they are radio djs.<br/>

My husband had really good luck at    www.geek.com<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of a busy site - might take some searching to get at what <br/>
you want to know.<br/>
<br/>
I read some of the geekToons - they are, um - geeky. . . . .<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1536291863">I like <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.pcpitstop.com">http://www.pcpitstop.com</a> for troubleshooting my computer.  It has a test that is free that will test your computer and tell you what you need to tweak to fine tune your hard drive.  The entire site is free.  There is a pop-up ad for a free tune-up that is not free.  Don&#39;t get confused by it.  It also has a forum where you can ask questions or just read all the advice given to others.  It doesn&#39;t matter what software you have, the geeks there know them all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll have to check out Geek.com.  I have a favorites folder for sites regarding my computer, but I&#39;ve never been to this one.<br/>
