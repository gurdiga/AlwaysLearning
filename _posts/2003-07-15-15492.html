<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290879531">Dear Unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
I have a longing not fulfilled. I am sure that someone out there can help<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I wish someone could tell me the name of the movie that the song &quot;Day Dream<br/>
Believers&quot; The Monkeys was made to movie theme song. (That is what husband<br/>
said.  I heard the song on the radio and husband said the title of the song<br/>
were &quot;Day Dream Believers&quot;.  I knew the song and had heard that it were a<br/>
movie song. I never figured out the title of it.  I grew up in a small city<br/>
200 km fm the Paraguay border in Brazil.  At that time Brazil was military<br/>
ruled and foreign culture &quot;invasion&quot; were strongly guarded.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why, but that song is attached to the words that sounds like &quot;<br/>
bee gee&quot;.  I wonder why...<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the help.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432666552">The lyrics to the song are below (just for fun) and a Google search turns up<br/>
quite a number of Monkees sites. This one seems to be populated by happy<br/>

Daydream Believer<br/>
<br/>
By John Stewart<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I could hide &#39;neath the wings<br/>
Of the bluebird as she sings.<br/>
The six o&#39;clock alarm would never ring.<br/>
But it rings and I rise,<br/>
Wipe the sleep out of my eyes.<br/>
My shavin&#39; razor&#39;s cold and it stings.<br/>
<br/>
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.<br/>
Oh, what can it mean.<br/>
To a daydream believer<br/>
And a homecoming queen.<br/>
<br/>
You once thought of me<br/>
As a white knight on a steed.<br/>
Now you know how happy I can be.<br/>
Oh, and our good times start and end<br/>
Without dollar one to spend.<br/>
But how much, baby, do we really need.<br/>
<br/>
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.<br/>
Oh, what can it mean.<br/>
To a daydream believer<br/>
And a homecoming queen.<br/>
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.<br/>
Oh, what can it mean.<br/>
To a daydream believer<br/>
And a homecoming queen.<br/>
<br/>
[Instrumental interlude]<br/>
<br/>
Cheer up, Sleepy Jean.<br/>
Oh, what can it mean.<br/>
To a daydream believer<br/>
And a homecoming queen.<br/>
[Repeat and fade]<br/>

I can&#39;t recall that &quot;Daydream Believer&quot; was from that movie or not.  I have<br/>

Hi Noemi,<br/>
I was wondering if you were thinking about the movie Shrek which has a Monkey song,  &quot;I&#39;m A Believer&quot; in it? <br/>

Believers&quot; The Monkeys was made to movie theme song.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that was FROM the movie &quot;Head,&quot; but it might have been IN the <br/>
movie.<br/>
<br/>
Some Country & Western female singer redid that song later and it makes NO <br/>
SENSE from a feminine perspective.  It doesn&#39;t make much sense from a male <br/>
perspective!   <br/>
<br/>
But then I bet Cathy&#39;s guess could be right:  &quot;I was wondering if you were <br/>
thinking about the movie Shrek which has a Monkey song,  &quot;I&#39;m A Believer&quot; in it? <br/>
&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a Believer has a chorus that goes <br/>
&quot;Then I saw her face, <br/>
now I&#39;m a believer<br/>
Not a trace of doubt in my mind<br/>
I&#39;m in love<br/>
I&#39;m believer, I couldn&#39;t leave her if I tried.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And the reason they probably thought of using it was it starts off &quot;I thought <br/>
love was only true in fairy tales&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The other one&#39;s chorus is<br/>
&quot;Cheer up Sleepy Jean<br/>
Oh what can it mean<br/>
To a daydream believer<br/>
and a homecoming queen.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ah, here:   Daydream Believer<br/>

The group spelled their name in a strange way, &quot;Monkees&quot;.  This spelling<br/>
may be helpful if you are using a search engine to find more information.<br/>
<br/>
I loved their TV show when I was a little girl, but I don&#39;t actually<br/>

This is the Anne Murray of &quot;Blame Canada&quot;?<br/>
&quot;Not a dollar one&quot; is idiomatic English.<br/>
Davey Jones is from England (but he didn&#39;t write it).<br/>

<br/>
Beat.<br/>
Mersey Beat.<br/>
Beatles.<br/>
<br/>
So the word &quot;monkey&quot; already HAS a musical reference:  &quot;key&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So somebody respelled it in some sort of monkey-see-monkey-do way, but <br/>
missing the principle behind the thing, the only musical reference was re-spelled to <br/>
NOT be a musical reference.  &quot;Monkees.&quot;<br/>
