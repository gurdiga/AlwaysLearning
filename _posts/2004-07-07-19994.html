I used to say &quot;We&#39;ll keep doing it as long as it&#39;s working out.  We&#39;re having <br/>
LOTS of fun,&quot; and smile really big right into their brains.  <br/>

This sounds familiar.  After the Rethinking Education<br/>
conference Memorial Day weekend, my parents met us in<br/>
Dallas for a few days.  One of the first things Mom<br/>
asked was &quot;so how&#39;s unschooling going?&quot;  I reply<br/>
&quot;GREAT!&quot;  She rolls her eyes & says &quot;I know it is<br/>
great for you & Chris but what about the kids?&quot;  As if<br/>
we don&#39;t really care about them at all!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1180323853">How funny.  I have heard the same thing from my mother.  She actually thinks I am homeschooling the lazy way.  It is really sad how some people just do not understand what unschooling is all about.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think that in our society parents make so many of these kinds of <br/>
decisions for their kids without considering the kids&#39; feelings, that maybe <br/>
they *do* think that. Of course it wouldn&#39;t take much to just *ask* the <br/>
kids. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Well you could tell her (tongue in cheek, ready to run) <br/>
that the way you raise her resulted in a lazy adult<br/>
<br/>
so you&#39;re trying something else!  &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
