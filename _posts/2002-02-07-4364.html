<div id="ygrps-yiv-1313322694">We have a rather distressed couch that we can&#39;t afford to replace right now. <br/>
Anyone know how to fix broken couch springs? Or can we sell this thing for <br/>
lots of money? The upholstery&#39;s in pretty bad shape too...that should add to <br/>
the value.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1345573588">The springs can be retied....but you do have to take<br/>
off the upholtery to do it. It is really a pain. And<br/>
the new upholstery fabric...or whatever you use will<br/>
cost more than $25 for a new-to-you one from Salvation<br/>
Army or yard sale. Somewhere I have a diagram of how<br/>
to tie the springs....if you REALLY want to do that,<br/>
post off list and I&#39;ll hunt it up and scan to you.<br/>
