<div id="ygrps-yiv-1533612249">I love Houston weather and lived there many years.  March can be kind of<br/>
tricky.  It is often quite wet and not warm enough for that to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I like June.  Days in the upper 80&#39;s, low 90&#39;s with almost daily<br/>
brief showers about 5:00.<br/>
<br/>
If you are looking for something drier, think San Antonio<br/>
