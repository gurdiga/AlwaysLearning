The text is below, or you could go to the site and see it where it&#39;s supposed <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m making reference to the traditional claim about randomness, patterns in <br/>
the universe, whatEVER it all is, in my next HEM column, so  I did a google <br/>
search just to refresh my memory of the origin of the claim that an infinite <br/>
number of monkeys at typewriters would eventually type &quot;Hamlet.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Here is one of my favorite online authors, making sense, as usual.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Monkeys, Numbers and You<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
by Lore Sjöberg<br/>
<br/>
The saying is as follows: if you take X monkeys, set them at typewriters, and <br/>
have them type for some indefinite period of time, eventually they will <br/>
compose Y, where X is a positive whole number -- generally a large one -- and <br/>
Y is one or more of the works of Shakespeare, often Hamlet. That&#39;s leaving <br/>
aside the whole &quot;infinite monkeys&quot; thing. Obviously enough, an infinite <br/>
number of monkeys will instantly come up with Hamlet, along with every other <br/>
piece of literature from the past, present, and future.<br/>
<br/>
No, no, let&#39;s deal with the merely impossible: some definite number of <br/>
monkeys pounding away like so many journalists in black-and-white 40&#39;s crime <br/>
movies, working towards the Holy Grail of simian stenography, the text of <br/>
Hamlet. But why Shakespeare? Why Hamlet? There are a lot of things that <br/>
monkeys chained to typewriters can accomplish, let us not forget. Here, then, <br/>
is a list of things our theoretical monkeys are -- mathematically speaking -- <br/>
likely to come up with long before they finish Hamlet.<br/>
<br/>
Several perfect cryptograms of Hamlet.<br/>
<br/>
A long Usenet argument over whether Boba Fett is alive, complete with <br/>
spam-blocked e-mail addresses.<br/>
<br/>
The phrase &quot;Jesus Christ my ass is chafed&quot; repeated for the length of two <br/>
letter-sized pages.<br/>
<br/>
The text of Hamlet, except everyone dies of food poisoning in Act II.<br/>
<br/>
A brief but accurate write-up of the most embarrassing thing you ever did, <br/>
with full names, dates, and places.<br/>

recent Fraiser? He went to his son&#39;s Bar Mitzvah and blessed him in Klingon. <br/>
Too funny. Later the Rabbi said &quot;You must be very proud... (and as Frasier <br/>
and Lillith nodded and smiled, he said) of your son, not yourselves.&quot; <br/>
