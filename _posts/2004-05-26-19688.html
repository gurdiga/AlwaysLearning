-=-A child is not old enough to be in charge of their<br/>
overall well being, safety, etc... -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think people are recommending that children &quot;be in charge of&quot; things, but that they not be controlled.  Giving them choices is not putting them in charge of their well being.<br/>
<br/>
-=- What is appropriate for<br/>
an eight year old to decide for him or herself is not<br/>
appropriate for a five or two year old. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Letting a child make some decisions is not the same as abandoning a child in the wide world to make all his own decisions without assistance or input .<br/>
<br/>
-=-So yes, i will screen<br/>
my sons books while he is young.  Yes i do monitor the<br/>
computer while he is young.  This is called healthy<br/>
protection. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You are calling it healthy protection.<br/>
&quot;This is what I call healthy protection&quot; might be a better way to phrase it.<br/>
<br/>
But by using that phrase, you&#39;re suggesting that people who give their children more freedom are not providing a healthy or protective environment.   Or maybe you&#39;re imagining something different than people are trying to describe.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Would you really let a five year old access to<br/>
pornography, murder scenes, etc...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Do you believe that your monitoring is all that stands between them and porn?<br/>
I&#39;ve had three five year olds who weren&#39;t  &quot;monitored&quot; in the way I think you might be describing, and yet they didn&#39;t even like romance or kissing.  They only liked stories/movies/websites with kids, dogs, cartoons...  <br/>

<br/>
I totally agree with Sandra on this point.  I have 5 kids who have complete<br/>
and unlimited access to the computer, video games, television, pay-per-view.<br/>
Nobody is even interested in watching R rated movies that have the rating<br/>
due to sexual content.<br/>
<br/>
Fear based parenting is not the best of all options.<br/>
