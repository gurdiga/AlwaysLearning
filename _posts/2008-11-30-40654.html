this <br/>
game.  You can find user comments and ratings, tons of pictures of <br/>
the <br/>

<br/>
This game is great for those who enjoy adventuring and monster-slug-a-<br/>
thons.  Also remember that it can take 2-4 hours to play, depending <br/>
on <br/>
the number of players, with a minimum age of 12.<br/>
<br/>
Other games he might be interested in:<br/>
<br/>
Warcraft: The Boardgame - not as highly rated as Titan, but takes <br/>
less <br/>
time to play, costs less - <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/7479">http://www.boardgamegeek.com/game/7479</a><br/>
<br/>
not to be confused with<br/>
<br/>
World of Warcraft: The Boardgame - also very good <br/>

So that should get you started.  I encourage anyone who is interested <br/>
in boardgames to use the massive information that boardgamegeek.com <br/>
has <br/>
available, it can really help in making the right decision when <br/>
considering a game to purchase.  I&#39;ve been a user on BGG for 6 years, <br/>
as well as an avid boardgame player and collector.   <br/>
<br/>
I see that you were shopping at Cardhaus - they are wonderful people <br/>
there in Lynnwood and truly have the best prices in this area.<br/>
<br/>
Other online sources:<br/>
boardsandbits.com - good prices, cheap shipping, but sales tax<br/>
thoughthammer.com - good prices, no sales tax, free shipping over $125<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to contact me directly if you have questions :)<br/>
GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!<br/>
