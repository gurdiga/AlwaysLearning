<div id="ygrps-yiv-1069670237"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;...how gymnastics is for Casey. It&#39;s her time to be<br/>
&gt;part of a team, work on specific skills, have an<br/>
&gt;actual teacher (Casey likes this), set goals and make<br/>
&gt;new friends. Lots of the other girls are burning out<br/>
&gt;by going to school all day and then gym. When<br/>
&gt;parent&#39;s ask what I  would suggest, I always say the<br/>
&gt;kid is overscheduled. Time to drop school. ;-) You <br/>
&gt;should see the looks I get.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of somethng I saw recently.  There is<br/>
a family (can&#39;t remember the name) with five kids who<br/>
are all pianists.  The kids developed a passion for<br/>
piano very early on and eventually their school<br/>
schedule began to conflict with piano, not leaving<br/>
them the time they wanted to play.  So the parents&#39;<br/>
solution:  Nix School, buy 5 grand pianos.  They stood<br/>
behind their children, cheering, all the way, and<br/>
homeschooled them.<br/>
<br/>
When the eldest reached the age for college, she<br/>
wanted to try for Julliard (spelling?) of course,<br/>
which is so very tough and exclusive and lets so very<br/>
few people in every year.  She got in, much to her and<br/>
her family&#39;s joy.  Then her sister got in, and then<br/>
another of the kids, and etc.  Now ALL FIVE are<br/>
studying there.  The eldest two girls play together,<br/>
whether on one piano or two pianos, in performance. <br/>
Their instructors say they have an almost spooky<br/>
emotional link and know what the other is going to do<br/>
before they do it.  They also look a lot alike.  The<br/>
others all have unique and original styles and are all<br/>
outstanding of course.<br/>
<br/>
Julliard has NEVER had siblings accepted at the same<br/>
time before, and certainly never 5 together.  I cannot<br/>
recall if they have ever had ANY siblings accepted. <br/>
Because it is so remarkable, it was in the news.<br/>
<br/>
What did the parents&#39; do when all five kids got<br/>
accepted?  Well they sold their house and moved near<br/>
Julliard, so all the kids could live at home and save<br/>
money on the incredible tuition at Julliard.<br/>
