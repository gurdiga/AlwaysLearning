<div id="ygrps-yiv-1210219974">Hi Julie,<br/>
<br/>
We are just getting started with dairy goats.  Adriane (10) got a kid (La<br/>
Mancha/Nubian) to raise for a 4-H project.  She is doing quite well showing<br/>
the goat.  In fact, we are off to Fort Worth for 4 days next week.  I can&#39;t<br/>
wait.<br/>
<br/>
  Then I got a little La Mancha buck for me.  He had quite a bit of<br/>
secondary horn growth but had such a sweet nature I didn&#39;t figure it would<br/>
be a problem.  Found out that when he hit about 120 pounds and discovered he<br/>
was a boy,  it was a problem.  So he is off to the vet tomorrow to be<br/>
dehorned.  Vet warned me it would be hard on him, so I&#39;m kind of worried.<br/>
But Junior had reached the point of being dangerous.  He knocked a hole in<br/>
the barn while we were out of town and just the other day about took me down<br/>
and bruised my leg up.  Do you have any experience in that area?<br/>
<br/>
We also raise rabbits (waiting for babies as we speak....so to speak) and<br/>
are hoping to put in chickens in the Spring.  We only have a couple of acres<br/>
so we are kind of limited.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi again.. Julie<br/>
Yes, I have a very naughty Nubian buck.. he&#39;s 7 months old now and I think<br/>
I&#39;ve about given up on teaching him any manners. (I also have a Ram that&#39;s<br/>
worse..I think they compare notes each night and see who will be the one to<br/>
&quot;do me in&quot; the next day..LOL..) I have my kids disbuded around 10 days of<br/>
age or so.. as soon as the horn bud is poking through the hair.. horns<br/>
aren&#39;t allowed around here at all! Dangerous to me.. and to other goats and<br/>
a real problem with getting stuck in fences too.<br/>
I&#39;ve also raised Rabbits..mostly the Angora type for fiber..I have a flock<br/>
of Rhode Island Red chickens and Japanese Silkie bantams ..plus my daughters<br/>
two Appaloosa horses and my 3 Sheep and 4 Nubies.. we only have a couple of<br/>
acres too.. so our hay bill is pretty high in the winter months.<br/>
If you want to &#39;talk goat&#39; feel free to email me private anytime.. since all<br/>
this farm stuff might be boring for everyone else.<br/>
