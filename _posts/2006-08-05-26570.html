really well like what Deb Lewis looks like.***<br/>
<br/>
Yes, well at least you recognize that what I look like is important and<br/>
useful.  I usually have to remind people. <br/>
<br/>
But since you don&#39;t remember, I&#39;ll refresh you.  <br/>
I&#39;m stunningly beautiful with a definite air of intelligence about me. <br/>
(Or maybe that &quot;definite air&quot; of something is the dog poo stuck to my<br/>
shoe...) <br/>
<br/>
Deb Lewis, looking important and useful here in my pj&#39;s with my hair<br/>
uncombed.</div>
