<div id="ygrps-yiv-834696876">That was amazing. I&#39;m sitting here crying. Thank you so much for<br/>
sharing it! If only more people lived life this way. <br/>
<br/>
One quote from the his lecture about having fun that really hit home,<br/>
he said, &quot;I&#39;m dying and I&#39;m having fun&quot;. wow. <br/>

I watched this a while ago.  What I truly found inspiring about him, is<br/>
that he never ever claims to know it all.  In fact quite the opposite. <br/>
He found clever ways to find the answers and get what he wanted.<br/>
<br/>
I love how he talks about his parents.  How they supported his dreams<br/>
and ambitions.  This is my favorite part of unschooling.  Saying &quot;yes&quot;<br/>
and finding ways to make it happen, helping my kids get what they want<br/>
in life.<br/>
<br/>
We know a lot of parents that say &quot;no&quot; a lot and belittle their<br/>
children&#39;s dreams and ambitions and force their kids to focus on the<br/>
parent&#39;s narrow view of success and what is &quot;right&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I want my kids to feel empowered, so I empower them.  I don&#39;t want their<br/>
view of the world to be tainted by &quot;can&#39;t&quot;, &quot;shouldn&#39;t&quot;, &quot;wouldn&#39;t&quot;, and<br/>
the like.  I want their world to be full of &quot;yes I can&quot;, I shall find a<br/>
way to do what I want to do with my parent&#39;s blessing and help.<br/>
<br/>
So many parents set their kids up where the kids have to defy their<br/>
parents to get what they want in life.  That is such a huge obstacle and<br/>
burden for a young person, almost to the point of self defeating.  Some<br/>
young people don&#39;t have that strength of character or drive to jump that<br/>
hurdle and so, stay stuck in that world.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-245155788">Jenny, what you wrote is beautiful.  I added all of the end of it to  <br/>
the page on &quot;yes&quot;:<br/>

Over the past few week or so I&#39;ve heard several direct examples and  <br/>
some stories of the kneejerk &quot;no&quot; so common to parents.  Maybe the  <br/>
balance will tip.  My nephew broke up with a girlfriend because she  <br/>
had a young son she was lying to, and as he said &quot;She would be  <br/>
telling me a story she had already told me three or four times, and  <br/>
tell him to stop interrupting.&quot;  He wants to be with someone who is  <br/>
kind and honest.  Good for him.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard for my kids, too, to be around people saying &quot;No&quot; for no  <br/>
good reason.  I&#39;m not glad they&#39;ll have that tension, but I&#39;m glad  <br/>
for what it means about their lives, and how it will improve their  <br/>
children&#39;s lives.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a really hard time being around people that don&#39;t let kids<br/>
interrupt a conversation because the &quot;adult&quot; is talking.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
known to let the adult continue with what they are saying, respond with<br/>
a pat reply and then give my complete full direct attention to the child<br/>
that had interrupted.  I&#39;ve been hugely surprised at the content which<br/>
the child had to put out there with thoughts and words, and it is very<br/>
very often part of the adult conversation that they&#39;d been listening to<br/>
and &quot;interrupting&quot;.  I&#39;ve been glad, every time that I&#39;ve done this. <br/>
Partly because I get to hear more and indepth aspects to conversations,<br/>
but also, generally the parent that did the shushing will not do it<br/>
again and will actually acknowledge the child as part of the<br/>
conversation from that point onward.<br/>

friend, which I&#39;ve written about a few times.  We have a family joke<br/>
now, when someone is being extreme and unreasonable/illogical,<br/>
hypocritical, we call them &quot;george&quot; Or &quot;pulling a george&quot;.  Sorry for<br/>
anyone who is named George, who is nice and not all those horrid things<br/>
mentioned.... but still that is our big joking insult here.</div>
