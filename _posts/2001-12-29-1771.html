Speaking of which, Wallace Shawn said, &quot;I don&#39;t happen to have a sense<br/>
of humor personally, so I don&#39;t know what&#39;s funny ...  This happens to<br/>
be a feature of my life generally.  I do things, and other people laugh<br/>
at them.  I rarely know what the joke is supposed to be or why they&#39;re<br/>
laughing.  I&#39;m usually just trying to express my genuine view of<br/>
things.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Inconceivable!  Or maybe he was kidding?  I admit to having a Wally<br/>
moment over the fanny-doolies.  I don&#39;t get them, that is, I don&#39;t get<br/>
what&#39;s funny about them.  Is it explainable?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d never heard the term but I&#39;ve played the game for years (I called it<br/>
&quot;In My Family&quot; and played with my class during school hours *gasp*). It&#39;s<br/>
basically a catagorization thing - you give examples of things that are<br/>
&quot;in&quot; and &quot;out&quot; of a category, and the person tries to guess the category.<br/>
So, I could say &quot;Bowling is in my family, but swimming isn&#39;t. Basketball<br/>
is in my family but archery isn&#39;t.&quot; and you would try to guess the<br/>
category. We play that a person can ask, &quot;Is X in your family?&quot; and you<br/>
tell them yes or no....  I don&#39;t think they&#39;re funny, really. Fun,<br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
We also do Hinky Pinkies, if anyone knows those. You think of two (or<br/>
more) rhyming words that go together and then give a clue that doesn&#39;t<br/>
use the word - so, you could think of &quot;fat cat&quot; and the clue would be &quot;An<br/>
overweight feline&quot;. Actually, that&#39;s a hink pink, because it&#39;s two<br/>
one-syllables words... there are hink pinks, hinky pinkies, hinkedy<br/>
pinkedies, etc., and you specify which you&#39;re doing with the clue.<br/>
<br/>
I played both of those as a kid... Cacie and I also play &quot;I&#39;m a Harry<br/>
Potter character&quot; (think 20 Questions, although we don&#39;t limit it) but<br/>
that&#39;s a much never invention... it&#39;s also harder than it sounds, we&#39;ve<br/>
both read the books at least twice each and still stump each other.<br/>

It&#39;s a kind of riddle.  You have to know why she likes some things and <br/>
doesn&#39;t like others.  Or in the format it was presented to me, Why some <br/>
things ARE and some aren&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
If you try to create one and you fail, that proves you don&#39;t know what &quot;it&quot; <br/>
is.</div>

Just a note:  That one&#39;s not a Fanny Doolie.<br/>
It&#39;s another similar situation, but in case you&#39;re going to go back through <br/>
to get it, Carolyn, ignore the bowling and basketball examples or you might <br/>
have a headache.<br/>

Doolie&#39;s into the Families  game, but generally they weren&#39;t as much fun<br/>
for kids who aren&#39;t into spelling much... I think we originally expanded<br/>
it for my brother, who couldn&#39;t spell... weren&#39;t Fanny Dooly&#39;s on some<br/>
old TV show in the seventies?<br/>
