<div id="ygrps-yiv-1310568267">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I fail to connect actors to movies, but remember authors and book titles. I have always thought my lack of concentration is left over from the hours spent listening to someone else tell me what I need to know. Public School, then University. Count up the years, 21 years spent of my 38 years in someone else&#39;s class. Being told what is important to know, what will be tested. I received honors from College, straight A&#39;s mostly, even in organic chemistry and biochemistry, and women&#39;s history. I still find it difficult to talk about politics and actors.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I have been exploring drawing. I am learning to see shapes like I have never before. Believing you can is a large step to getting there, believing you can not can cause the path to vanish.<br/>
