<div id="ygrps-yiv-2057243288"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;I don&#39;t think we need new vocabulary to treat our<br/>
&gt;children as kindly and respectfully as we treat our<br/>
&gt;adult friends.  We don&#39;t need to have a special <br/>
&gt;philosophy to acknowledge that it&#39;s their house too,<br/>
&gt;not just ours.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Here Here!  I get sick of all the conflicting<br/>
philosophies, special vocabularies, nitpicking<br/>
interpretations, when really it&#39;s all about treating<br/>
human beings like human beings, no matter what size<br/>
they are.<br/>
