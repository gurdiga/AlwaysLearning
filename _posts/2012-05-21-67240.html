I should have mentioned this sooner. It begins today.<br/>
<br/>
People can, perhaps with the cost of a long-distance call (perhaps not; depends on the person&#39;s electronic resources and location, I suppose) hear one or more of 19 speakers including me (on May 28) and Pam Sorooshian (May 30).  The presentations are intervews by Michele Barone, pre-recorded, then set into a sense-making order. :-)<br/>
<br/>
This is a note from the organizer: <br/>
<br/>
-=- Everyone who signs up for a FREE ticket will have 24 hours of free access to the all of the interviews. After that time they will be offered an option to purchase unlimited access to the interviews as well as an Unschooling Forum for additional guidance. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t fully understand this.  I think if someone wants to hear me or Pam, they go in that day, and can listen to others, as well.  It wouldn&#39;t be possible to hear them all in 24 hours (and also sleep, eat, take care of kids), but there will be an offer there to pay something (I *think* it&#39;s about $80, but I don&#39;t know---if someone sees it, please report back here) for access to them later, whenever.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s always a call-in-and-listen deal.<br/>
If so, there is Skype (which might be free for such matters) and... what else that doesn&#39;t involve holding a phone?  (speaker phone...)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry I&#39;m a bit vague on this, and would appreciate others clarifying, especially those who have already signed up or maybe been to the page today.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
You have to sign up for your free summit &quot;ticket&quot; in order to hear the<br/>
calls each day.<br/>
<br/>
If you go onto the website: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschoolingsummit.com/">http://unschoolingsummit.com/</a><br/>
there is a place to sign up and to get your free tickets.  Once you sign up<br/>
for your tickets you will get an email for each day.  That email contains<br/>
the number to call and the code to enter to get to that talk.  So, you can<br/>
listen at that time (the times and instructions come in the email) OR for<br/>
the 24 hours following that talk you can call in and hear that particular<br/>
talk.  So, it&#39;s each 24 hour period after that days calls that they will be<br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want to call in and listen every day (or every 24 hours) you<br/>
can purchase the whole summit and hear it whenever you have time.<br/>
<br/>
That is how I understand it, and I hope it&#39;s accurate.<br/>

I just looked at the email I got and there is also a link for a webcast of<br/>
the interview.  So, you could listen from a computer (or phone probably)<br/>
too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1789098562">If you get a free ticket, you can listen to each of the interviews when<br/>
they are released/played or up to 24 hours from the time they are played.<br/>
<br/>
If you upgrade to the paid version, you can download each one (only after<br/>
it has been release/played).<br/>
