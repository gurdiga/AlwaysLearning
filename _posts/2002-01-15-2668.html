<div id="ygrps-yiv-577576887"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Actually, many cultures will pre-chew the infant&#39;s food and deposit it in his <br/>
&gt; mouth---the origin of the kiss. Animals will do this too---to a further <br/>
&gt; degree---and regurgitate the partially digested food for their young. So, <br/>
&gt; really, no blenders were needed! :-) (ever wonder why your dog licks your <br/>
&gt; face?)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>True.  But that&#39;s still a lot more work than breastfeeding.  I don&#39;t<br/>
doubt that toddlers were given other foods as well as human milk, I just<br/>
can&#39;t see a mother spending her day chewing and spitting enough food to<br/>
support a child when she could just put him to the breast.  The same<br/>
goes for making oatmeal or mush.  Why would she provide all her child&#39;s<br/>
calories in this labor intensive manor if she didn&#39;t have to?  Nobody is<br/>
claiming that these babies didn&#39;t touch foods other than human milk, but<br/>
I don&#39;t think they would have been completely weaned from their mothers&#39;<br/>
milk until they could eat the same food as the rest of the family.  <br/>
<br/>
As for the age of weaning in mammals, perhaps I was mistaken about the<br/>
second set of teeth.  But they certainly don&#39;t wean until the first set<br/>
is fully in and the infant can eat solids.<br/>

<br/>
Can you see a mother spending her day and night cleaning and filling bottles <br/>
with formula instead of just putting him to the breast?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And who are these hypothetical other mothers?  Today babies are being born in <br/>
every country, to people of every language, in the whole world.  Not all have <br/>
any options for bottle, but I doubt ANY will be exclusively breastfed until <br/>
they have a bunch of teeth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1603778008">Moses (DS3) was almost 3 months old when we went on<br/>
our Japanese sojourn. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t know the language, was quite &quot;poor&quot;, had no<br/>
blender, no access to familiar baby-foods. I chewed<br/>
rice for him at about 5 months. And<br/>
chewed(peeled)apples. I mashed bananas with fork.  I<br/>
chewed other stuff for him as he got older. The hard<br/>
part was not swallowing the juice (from the apples,<br/>
other fruit). He called a bite of apple an<br/>
&quot;ummmba-um&quot;. I did this at home, in private so as not<br/>
to gross out anyone.  DS1(8) and DS2(5) didn&#39;t think<br/>
anything of it, one way or the other. Ya&#39; just do what<br/>
ya&#39; gotta do, whatever your cultural background.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-632428917">Just FYI: my grandmother (born 1900) told me once that she was proud of the<br/>
fact that she never chewed for her babies. Other moms would, she said, and<br/>
they&#39;d line up the little balls of pre-chewed food on the edges of their<br/>
plates, and then would pop them in the babies&#39; mouths when they were hungry.<br/>
This would have been late 1920&#39;s and early 1930&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
She also said that as the oldest of twelve, she&#39;d hoped to have the first<br/>
grandchild. The Christmas after my aunt was born, however, three of her<br/>
sisters and her mother all had new babies! Two months ago, on her 101st<br/>
birthday, she sang my daughter a song her daddy used to sing to her... sorry<br/>
to ramble, but it&#39;s fascinating talking with her and I wish I had learned<br/>
more when she could have told me.<br/>

 I have one breast-and-bottle fed and one strictly breastfed, and both of <br/>
 them are as picky as one could imagine.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
Pam<br/>
<br/>
My oldest was only breastfed four months (I was young and didn&#39;t know better, <br/>
poor guy) and he will eat a huge variety of foods. My next was breastfed 19 <br/>
months and has always been VERY picky and craves sweets.  Number three was <br/>
breastfed two years and eats almost anything......<br/>
Then we&#39;ve got baby boy who is nursing a LOT at 18 months and is very, very <br/>
picky about his solids as of yet.  I am guessing he will nurse for a much <br/>
longer time than the rest of them.<br/>
Hopefully the pickiness won&#39;t last.  I think breastfeeding does expose them <br/>
to a lot of different tastes, and of course it&#39;s best anyway.<br/>
But genetics has a lot to do with it also.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Then she spoke.<br/>
<br/>
 Good for you! <br/>
<br/>
I must have looked confused because she went on,  Good for you for <br/>
<br/>
breastfeeding. So many moms are not breastfeeding today.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was a baby, we went to a family reuinion in Texas.  He was four <br/>
months old. <br/>
<br/>
It was in a big hall, and there were 120 people or so in there at the time.  <br/>
<br/>
When he wanted to nurse, I carried him back to the farthest wall from where <br/>
most people were, and I nursed him while reading a bulletin board and from a <br/>
distance others probably thought I was just rocking him to sleep, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
My grandmother, who was 82 or so, came back there and looked at the bulletin <br/>
board too.  It was a kind of &quot;leaning on a truck&quot; moment  (as in <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/truck)">http://sandradodd.com/truck)</a><br/>
and she said, &quot;Good for you.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Same thing.&lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
But her next statement was &quot;I don&#39;t know WHY those other mothers won&#39;t FEED <br/>
THEIR BABIES.&quot;  There were two other infants in the room, both being bottle <br/>
fed.  <br/>
<br/>
I really liked what you wrote.  Good story, Joylyn.<br/>
<br/>
I was at the Wyoming branch of the library one day here, when Kirby was <br/>
little.  Not walking, but bigger.  Maybe nine months?  I should look it up, <br/>
if I wrote it down.<br/>
<br/>
An older woman kept looking at him and watching us, and finally she asked me <br/>
how old he was.  I told her.  She said her daughter had married and was <br/>
living in Norway, I think she said (a Scandinavian country) and had had a <br/>
baby boy that age, but she, the grandmother, hadn&#39;t gotten to see him yet, <br/>
and was having a hard time imagining how big he was, and might not get to see <br/>
him for another year.  She seemed really sad.  When we said goodbye and <br/>
parted, I thought...  I turned back quickly and said &quot;Would you like to hold <br/>
him?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She just lit up and was SO happy to have that surrogate moment.  It was sweet <br/>
for me to watch her be so happy to  hold Kirby in place of one she wouldn&#39;t <br/>
get to hold at that age.  <br/>
