<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072018504">My son is 5 and still sleeps with us.  I usually find myself completely<br/>
wrapped in his arms and legs when I wake up.  He&#39;s been this way since<br/>
birth, and would not sleep in his crib at all (we tried some when I was<br/>
overwhelmed and just needed a break from him - no go).<br/>
<br/>
Some nights we put him in his room at first (I lay with him until he&#39;s<br/>
asleep), but he knows beforehand that he&#39;s welcome in our bed when he wakes<br/>
up.  He&#39;s usually in our bed by midnight, but it gives us some couple time.<br/>
<br/>
Our older daughter slept with us until she was 7 or so, and on occasion<br/>
still wants to sleep with us.  Our bed isn&#39;t big enough, though (king, but<br/>
she&#39;s 9 and as big as me) so we squish in.<br/>
<br/>
Janet, who wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1314493051">&quot;I can understand the family bed (although we <br/>
didn&#39;t practice it) up until about 2 years of age and then it&#39;s just <br/>
not needed for most children,&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Do you really believe this? Human biological wiring causes us to need other humans. We are developed in a womb enveloped by another human being, hearing their heartbeat, feeling their warmth. How is it that at a certain age humans just suddenly wouldn&#39;t need another human to sleep near? I think some people do fine sleeping alone eventually, and others need another body near them all the time. Uniqueness of individuals.<br/>
If a parent has an idea that a two year old (or three or any age for that matter) can handle something just fine, without considering the individual development or looking for cues from the child, then they are not in touch with either their child or normal development stages.<br/>
<br/>
My Jalen is almost three, he most certainly needs someone sleeping with him at night. Sierra and Jared still prefer to sleep with me at ages 6 and 10. Honoring their needs is really important to me. They don&#39;t have nightmares, they are happy, calm and loving individuals. I have NO doubt that honoring their sleep needs has aided those character traits.<br/>

Co-sleeping is not an automatic nightmare preventative.  I still have <br/>
nightmares and vivid dreams, and my son had a nightmare just last night.  Co-sleeping <br/>
does provide a way for the child to get comfort on the double, without the <br/>
feeling of aloneness I always experienced when I awoke from nightmares alone in <br/>
my bed as a child.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree.  But I also think that a child who is afraid in another room <br/>
may suffer from more sleep disturbances such as nightmares than a child <br/>
who is comfortable in bed with a parent.  Also, when my daughter has a <br/>
nightmare, I am right there to comfort her, to talk about it, and to <br/>
help her go back to sleep.  However, if I was in another room, one of us <br/>
would have to get up in order to do this, which would even more disturb <br/>
a sleep cycle, and make it harder for people to go back to sleep.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-968049442">My dd is eight and still wants the family bed.   She told me the <br/>
other day that when she is about 10, she may sleep in her own bed <br/>
sometimes.  &quot;OK, either way is fine with me; I am happy with it as <br/>
long as you are happy with it,&quot; was my response.  <br/>
<br/>
I think this is also a very practical way to sleep, too.  Saves <br/>
space,  safer in case of fires and reduces those horrible acts of <br/>
kidnapping....bad guys don&#39;t like to deal with Moma--or Daddy-- <br/>
Bears in the bedroom...  Just think about it!<br/>
<br/>
And for parents that work outside of the home for many hours--this <br/>
is a perfect way to re-attach in the evening.  The children and <br/>
parents need this!  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480321566">So true Sheree! I know that dh will be disappointed when the kids (5, <br/>
3 and 1) move on from the family bed. When he gets home from work <br/>
late at night he always pulls our 5yo ds away from me and snuggles up <br/>
with him :) He also gets excited when he wakes up to find the baby <br/>
has crawled over everyone else in the middle of the night to cuddle <br/>
up with him.<br/>
