I still <br/>
don&#39;t see the correlation between maturity and setting boundaries, we <br/>
all need to set boundaries, it&#39;s part of adulthood.<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
<br/>
If you were going on and on like this at my house, I&#39;d probably ask you to <br/>
change the subject, and if you couldn&#39;t I&#39;d ask you to leave.<br/>
<br/>
As this list was created by  me for the purpose of discussing unschooling, <br/>
I&#39;m going to ask you to change the subject away from your feelings about posts, <br/>
and to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It really <br/>
was only about not wanting *unnecessary* mean stuff. No where on this <br/>
message board does it say &quot;If you post a request, brace yourself for <br/>
some serious harshing out&quot;,-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Shhhhh.....   Breathe, please, and calm down.  If you have unschooling <br/>
comments or questions, post them.  If you don&#39;t, write elsewhere.  A diary, maybe.  <br/>
To your mom, maybe.  Not to the 500 people on my list.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I  know none of us will ever have to see one another <br/>
face to face and in that there is a security, one in which we can say <br/>
*anything* we want to each other, but that doesn&#39;t mean that we have to <br/>
be mean to each other.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Many people here have met each other at homeschooling conferences.  There&#39;s <br/>
on in Boston in August, if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody is trying to be mean to you.  People aren&#39;t saying things to you they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t say in person, if you were blocking their attempts to answer your <br/>
questions in an unschooling context.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know I&#39;m not immature nor am I  extremely <br/>
offensive. I&#39;m a sensitive, loving person who tries to come from the <br/>
heart and not strictly from the mind, because when I disconnect from my <br/>
heart, I get bitchy and start hurting people&#39;s feelings.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t a &quot;feelings&quot; list.<br/>
It&#39;s to discuss unschooling.<br/>
If you can, do.<br/>
Whether you wrote from your heart or your mind, do it carefully, proofread, <br/>
see if there&#39;s anything others could find tacky, and if so don&#39;t post it here.<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to report me to yahoo if you want, but I think they&#39;ll just think <br/>
you&#39;re crazy.  The list is years old, and quite healthy.  All the posts from <br/>
all those years are there in the archive for you to read if you want.<br/>
<br/>
There are other unschooling lists.  Here are some with addresses:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/other">http://sandradodd.com/lists/other</a><br/>
<br/>
or you can go to yahoogroups and search for unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
This is certainly not the only place you can learn about unschooling.<br/>
