Homeschool Horror<br/>
Divinely ordained education, taught by martyrs<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BY QUINN COTTON<br/>
<br/>
You know how there are terrorist cells embedded throughout the world?<br/>
Well, in my neighborhood we have numerous &quot;homeschool&quot; cells humming <br/>
in the<br/>
cul-de-sacs. They&#39;re almost as scary as the terrorist ones in some <br/>
ways --<br/>
and they definitely have some traits in common with them.<br/>
<br/>
When we first moved to Charlotte, the houses next to us, behind us,<br/>
and diagonally across the street all contained children who <br/>
mysteriously<br/>
never seemed to leave home, and mothers with glazed expressions on <br/>
their<br/>
faces. The whole set-up of moms stuck with their school-age kids <br/>
24/7 gave<br/>
me the willies, and that was before I even had one of my own.<br/>
<br/>
Middle class areas seem to be magnets for little suburban<br/>
schoolhouses. Even though there must be homeschooling pockets all <br/>
over<br/>
Charlotte, somehow I don&#39;t picture your basic Ballantyne babe risking<br/>
breaking a nail on a chalkboard in the bonus room, or skipping a <br/>
tennis set<br/>
for an educational excursion to the sewage plant. Likewise, I doubt <br/>
many<br/>
Belmont moms miss a beat packing those kids off to public school. <br/>
It&#39;s the<br/>
middle class that gets suckered into the myth that mothers and older<br/>
children can survive being together all day without somebody being<br/>
strangled. The true &quot;haves&quot; and &quot;have-nots&quot; know better.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s scary is that a lot of the homeschooling faithful are as <br/>
fueled<br/>
by a fanatical, religion-based belief in their mission as Islamist<br/>
terrorists, and seem to be just about as brainwashed. Sometimes I <br/>
even<br/>
wonder if they&#39;re a manufactured race along the lines of the <br/>
Stepford wives<br/>
in Ira Levin&#39;s book, but assembled in fundamentalist Christian <br/>
churches<br/>
instead of family basements. Like the Stepford robots, they&#39;re <br/>
programmed to<br/>
fulfill their husbands&#39; fantasies, only in this case it&#39;s their role <br/>
as the<br/>
Ultimate Selfless Mothers.<br/>
<br/>
Other times I feel like the heroine in another famous horror story by<br/>
Levin, Rosemary&#39;s Baby, at that chilling moment when she puts <br/>
together the<br/>
anagram &quot;All of Them Witches&quot; and realizes it refers to her seemingly<br/>
harmless neighbors. Some of the homeschooling moms (HMs) are kind of<br/>
witch-y, with the uncut hair and the long skirts because pants on <br/>
females<br/>
are unholy, but the description that really applies to this coven <br/>
is &quot;All of<br/>
Them Zealots.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not only terrorist-like in their conviction that their <br/>
calling<br/>
is divinely ordained, homeschoolers also often have a broad martyr <br/>
streak.<br/>
Rather than suicide bombings, though, they commit &quot;suicide book-<br/>
learning,&quot;<br/>
sacrificing their own lives to teach their kids. I&#39;ve known one or <br/>
two to<br/>
get pregnant as an excuse to get out of homeschooling hell, but the <br/>
true<br/>
martyrs keep right on instructing, with the newest little pupil <br/>
glued to<br/>
their breast.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond a certain age, children and mothers are just not meant to be<br/>
isolated together. It&#39;s unnatural. Keeping the kids at home might <br/>
have<br/>
worked back in the Stone Age, but cave women would&#39;ve at least had <br/>
each<br/>
other for company, and I bet they made damn sure the youngsters <br/>
stayed off<br/>
in a group together while they grunted gossip and drank their Cro-<br/>
Magnon<br/>
coffee.<br/>
<br/>
Kids need their teachers to be adults, separate from their mothers.<br/>
That way they can idolize or despise them apart from a parent <br/>
figure, and<br/>
don&#39;t have to depend on one person for everything they require. Did <br/>
a parent<br/>
of yours try to teach you to drive? How&#39;d that go? &#39;Nuff said.<br/>
<br/>
All young animals must be immersed in a mass of their peers so they<br/>
can figure out what it means to function as a member of the larger <br/>
group.<br/>
Believe me, I&#39;m aware that homeschooling families get their children<br/>
together, since occasionally there&#39;ll be a flood of them from next <br/>
door<br/>
scrambling over the fence to play uninvited in our yard, but being <br/>
with<br/>
maybe a dozen other kids once in a while doesn&#39;t do the trick. It <br/>
takes<br/>
serious numbers for developing humans to catch on to the nuances of <br/>
accepted<br/>
behavior and to have a chance to make enough friends. I just can&#39;t <br/>
see<br/>
homeschooling providing adequate socialization.<br/>
<br/>
One of my neighboring HMs taught her two kids through eighth grade,<br/>
then threw them to the wolves in public high school. The boy ended up<br/>
dropping out and doing jail time, and the girl got pregnant.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I know that homeschooled kids have won high-profile academic<br/>
contests, but for every homeschooler who aces a spelling bee, <br/>
there&#39;s some<br/>
poor child being &quot;instructed&quot; by a parent who&#39;s barely literate <br/>
herself.<br/>
Teachers in the public school system are required to have <br/>
certification and<br/>
college degrees, yet any yahoo can force their kids to stay home as <br/>
long as<br/>
they pass an annual test.<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s really scary about homeschooling is what it can do to the<br/>
sanity of a mother deluded into thinking it&#39;s her Christian duty. No <br/>
woman<br/>
was ever meant to be trapped in a house all day with children old <br/>
enough to<br/>
spell &quot;homicide.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So if new neighbors move in next door and you notice that the kids<br/>
never leave for school and mom wears her hair in two braids, be <br/>
afraid. Be<br/>
very afraid.</div>

During primitive times families probably spent about 24/7 with each <br/>
other.<br/>
