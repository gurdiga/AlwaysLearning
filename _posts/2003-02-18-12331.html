I tried to cut and paste from your post about the Hawaiian terms for Ocean <br/>
and Mountain but it wouldn&#39;t let me. Your whole post was showing up as a link.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo....<br/>
It&#39;s Mauka and Makai. And the reason it works so well is that the mountains <br/>
are in the middle of the island of course, so you don&#39;t need North, South, <br/>
East, West. Everything is towards either the ocean or the mountains.<br/>
We named our youngest son after the ocean...Kai is his middle name.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
