<div id="ygrps-yiv-1979620766">Hello, I&#39;m new to this yahoo group, and already find it quite rich! Thank you for providing this &quot;fountain.&quot;<br/>
I have just begun my own blog about parenting, homeschooling and unschooling and although I&#39;m not &quot;completely there&quot; in the unschooling department- I&#39;m heading in that direction... I&#39;m writing the blog to define what I&#39;m doing so at least the people around me who don&#39;t understand can look at some of my writings.. It&#39;s also a place to compile cool info, and ultimately I want it to be a support for people who may be interested in going in a more homeschooling or  unschooling direction.<br/>
<br/>
This may be completely redundant and unnecessary to ask- but I wanted to make sure it was OK with you if I post links to your site on my blog. I&#39;ve read so many of your posts --Sandra especially-- and they are so spot on with what i want to say to people... <br/>

I&#39;ve actually already started doing this, but I&#39;ll take it down if you prefer I didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t really know blog etiquette yet.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks. Shauna<br/>

Any public site can be linked to any other public site, no problem!<br/>
<br/>
And you can quote what people write in public, but use quotes and credit them by name, and maybe link to the place where you read it.  <br/>
<br/>
A discussion like this one is less public.  It&#39;s still pretty public. :-)  But it&#39;s good to quote from REALLY unquestionably public places, like these:<br/>
