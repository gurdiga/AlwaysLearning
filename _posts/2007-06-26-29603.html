<br/>
And thank goodness no one is telling you that it&#39;s time to get off the computer! How much joy would have been robbed from the rest of us :)  That was really fun!<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been big on the computer today, (putting in some info for the questions about computer use earlier today)  playing Sandra&#39;s game, e-mailing different people, playing games.  My daughter even drew up a graph to watch prices within the World of Warcraft.  Amazing!<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d like to read about her venture into the world of economics,  its at my blog today. :)  And she also wrote about it at her blog. <br/>
