<div id="ygrps-yiv-1527424029">Hi all--<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been watching the conversations about TV and video games and <br/>
Barbie sheets and I finally figured out what I wanted to say.  I think.<br/>
<br/>
I do attempt to limit what my son sees.  At least when we are at home-- <br/>
when he visits his cousin 2 nights a week he has full access to all the <br/>
processed food and cartoon network he wants.  To my delight, he doesn&#39;t <br/>
want much.<br/>
<br/>
I limit which channels on TV because of all the advertising-- I REALLY <br/>
HATE advertising.  To me, it is a billion dollar industry whose sole <br/>
goal is to brainwash us into handing over our money.  I knew this and <br/>
thought about this ALOT when I worked in the industry at 22-- and 8 <br/>
years later I am still astounded at how effectively ads manipulate me.  <br/>
Even as I am watching and talking to myself about the manipulation, <br/>
they are working on me.  It&#39;s scary to me.  I know it sounds fanatical, <br/>
but it really is scary to me.<br/>
<br/>
And today I came across this link: &lt; <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://homepage.mac.com/gapodaca/digital/bikini/index.html">http://homepage.mac.com/gapodaca/digital/bikini/index.html</a> &gt;.  It&#39;s <br/>
essentially an example of exactly how they touch up the pictures in the <br/>
magazines.  I was surprised.  I knew they were touched up-- but I <br/>
didn&#39;t realize that even her hands were touched up, that her belly <br/>
button was touched up.  There are other pictures in this guys site and <br/>
even the shoe ads are fake.  Shoes!<br/>
<br/>
And I should mention that I do not and have never come anywhere close <br/>
to fitting our society&#39;s image of beauty.  So maybe that makes me extra <br/>
sensitive.  But the idea that my child would come to believe that <br/>
somewhere there are women who really look like that-- I know they are <br/>
fake but deep in my heart there is still a part of me that thinks I <br/>
should look like that when I wake up in the morning.  I can&#39;t tell you <br/>
how much it bothers me to know in my head that it&#39;s not reality, and <br/>
yet still find myself yearning to have what&#39;s in those ads-- a house <br/>
without dust, a spouse without pores (!) or lumpy sweaters, shoes that <br/>
have no wrinkles . . . stupid stuff.  I know it&#39;s stupid stuff, and <br/>
that knowledge doesn&#39;t seem to matter.<br/>
<br/>
And the Barbie sheets sort of goes along with that-- although he has <br/>
blue&#39;s clues sheets on the bed right now, lol.  I see the vast array of <br/>
character-based stuff for kids and it bothers me to realize that they <br/>
are crappy products.  On a base level, they are made of inferior <br/>
materials and will feel crappy to your skin within one washing-- the <br/>
company who made them didn&#39;t care about the quality of the sheets.  <br/>
They only cared about how they could get one more parent to hand over <br/>
some cash.<br/>
<br/>
The deal is, it&#39;s capitalism.  And I&#39;m coming to hate capitalism more <br/>
everyday.  And maybe it&#39;s because I get depressed in winter, or maybe <br/>
the hormones I&#39;m on trying to get pregnant, or maybe it&#39;s my feelings <br/>
over the current political situation . . . but I really hate the <br/>
society I am raising my child in.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;ve heard an argument that they will have to live in it, they might <br/>
as well get used to it-- that just reminds me of my mother, saying <br/>
&quot;he&#39;s going to spend the rest of his life behind a desk, he may as well <br/>
start practicing now [by going to school]&quot;.  Still, living in a bubble <br/>
doesn&#39;t make sense, either.  I guess right now my plan is to think very <br/>
carefully about the edges of the bubble, and make sure to expand it <br/>
regularly.  But really, I don&#39;t feel at peace with or without the <br/>
bubble.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

were retouched, and how,  but most of it was more like concrete evidence<br/>
of what we already know. If you play around with Adobe Photoshop you can<br/>
do some of the same things...<br/>
<br/>
I look at commercial TV as sort of a way we rip off the advertisers,<br/>
really. Ha-ha, you spent all this money that pays for the filming and<br/>
broadcasting of a show we like, and you&#39;re not getting anything back,<br/>
from us anyway. We usually don&#39;t watch the ads or buy stuff from them, so<br/>
we just get to reap the rewards for free!<br/>

Have you bought a Toyota lately?  One of those new luxury VW&#39;s?   Fanta?<br/>
A Playstation II that you didn&#39;t mean to buy?<br/>
<br/>
Are you a zombie?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I know it sounds fanatical, <br/>
but it really is scary to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your kids won&#39;t be afraid of the same things you&#39;re afraid of.  Maybe <br/>
they&#39;ll take it in stride if you don&#39;t demonize it.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;<br/>
And the Barbie sheets sort of goes along with that-- although he has <br/>
blue&#39;s clues sheets on the bed right now, lol.  I see the vast array of <br/>
character-based stuff for kids and it bothers me to realize that they <br/>
are crappy products. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The only character sheets we&#39;ve ever bought were USED, and the sheet I put on <br/>
my bed last night is a full-sized 100% cotton heavy flannel Ninja Turtle <br/>
sheet.  My husband and I don&#39;t agree on the amount of covers in winter, so we&#39;re <br/>
doing with separate covers.  He wants non-flannel.  I want flannel.  We got <br/>
that sheet for $3 at a thrift store.<br/>
<br/>
We have Barbie pillow cases, thrift store, that aren&#39;t great material, but <br/>
Holly likes them anyway.  Polyester doesn&#39;t bother her like it bothers me.  <br/>
<br/>
We have a Mario sheet from the thrift store.  Too cool to use.   HUGE piece <br/>
of Marioland print.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;They only cared about how they could get one more parent to hand over <br/>
some cash.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you ever handed over cash because your child wanted something and then <br/>
seen him light up happily?  It doesn&#39;t suck.   But used sheets, even cheaper!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The deal is, it&#39;s capitalism.  And I&#39;m coming to hate capitalism more <br/>
everyday.  And maybe it&#39;s because I get depressed in winter, or maybe <br/>
the hormones I&#39;m on trying to get pregnant, or maybe it&#39;s my feelings <br/>
over the current political situation . . . but I really hate the <br/>
society I am raising my child in.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a recipe for the depression-to-suicide range of thought.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t live there.  It&#39;s no good for you or your child.<br/>
Why get pregnant if the world is that horrible and you  hate it?  Poor child.<br/>
Just concentrate on making your already-existing child&#39;s life less horrible <br/>
and then you&#39;ll have done your job and you can die.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;  I&#39;ve heard an argument that they will have to live in it, they might <br/>
as well get used to it-- that just reminds me of my mother, saying <br/>
&quot;he&#39;s going to spend the rest of his life behind a desk, he may as well <br/>

<br/>
Well, you could kill your whole family.  Some people do that.  Would that <br/>
cheer you up?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;But really, I don&#39;t feel at peace with or without the <br/>
bubble.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t change the world very much.  You can&#39;t change it ENOUGH.  But you <br/>
can change your child&#39;s life right now, this second.  Go give him a big happy <br/>
hug.  Twirl him around.  Find little ways to make yourself happy.  You&#39;ve <br/>
discovered a BUNCH of ways to make yourself miserable, but it&#39;s not good at all, <br/>
not even a little bit.<br/>
<br/>
You won&#39;t end capitalism.   Don&#39;t think about it anymore.   <br/>
You COULD help make your neighbor&#39;s life sweeter today though, and maybe <br/>
someone you see out in public.  You could give your kid a great afternoon!!<br/>

<br/>
We like TV here and my son has had unlimited access to the television. <br/>
When he was four or five he thought everything he saw advertised was a<br/>
great idea.  He was really sure we needed things like an American Express<br/>
card and the Downy ball.  (I&#39;ve since heard glowing accounts of the<br/>
usefulness of the Downy ball, so no disrespect intended.&lt;g&gt;)  <br/>
<br/>
But as time went on he began to notice that every product advertised was<br/>
the best money could buy and every doo-dad and gizmo was going to make<br/>
life better.  He understood it couldn&#39;t all be true.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s a critical consumer and one of his pet peeves is that marketers<br/>
think kids are so dumb their going to eat some disgusting fruit roll up<br/>
thingy just because it has The Cat in the Hat on the box.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Advertising didn&#39;t brainwash him into believing he needs every new<br/>
product on the market.  His exposure to it was enough that he really had<br/>
time to think about the claims they were making and whether they could<br/>
all be true.  <br/>
<br/>
There are a lot of interesting things going on with advertising and<br/>
marketing and we&#39;ve had conversations about what makes a product<br/>
appealing and why advertisers would choose the spokesperson or model they<br/>
did.   <br/>
<br/>
I think advertising might be more seductive to someone who didn&#39;t have<br/>
time to explore it through exposure at an early age.  After all, most of<br/>
our kids don&#39;t have credit cards at six and seven &lt;g&gt;, but if they<br/>
haven&#39;t thought about the power of advertising by the time they&#39;re out on<br/>
their own with those credit cards, understanding the psychology behind<br/>
advertising could be pretty costly. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1692398119">You know, I used to feel this same way...my pet peeve was characters on<br/>
kids shoes. I felt that I needed to protect my kids from (as a friend of<br/>
mine puts it) &quot;the root of all evil&quot; marketing. <br/>
<br/>
As I have been reading more and more on unschooling.com, however an<br/>
interesting thing has happened. I have come to see my kids as a heck of<br/>
a lot stronger/smarter then I used to give them credit for. Instead of<br/>
someone who needs to be &quot;protected&quot; I see someone who  with whom I can<br/>
talk about this stuff with and who, given the chance, handles it pretty<br/>
dang well! My boys are 7 and almost 4 and I stopped controlling tv about<br/>
1.5 years ago. In that time I have seen Jason become very particular<br/>
about the shows that he watches. We have tivo and he has his favorites<br/>
set up to record regularly. If he catches a new show, I will ask if he<br/>
wants it recorded, often he will say no. He doesn&#39;t just watch tv to<br/>
watch tv (or because something is on)..he watches because he wants to<br/>
and he enjoys it.<br/>
<br/>
We have lots of ongoing conversations about marketing and good quality<br/>
vs cheap etc. He gets an allowance and is very picky what he spends his<br/>
money on. It is an ongoing process and I have to say that I like the<br/>
direction we are going in now. Yes, I have bought things that *I* would<br/>
not have a couple of years ago but the boys enjoy them and it is not<br/>
breaking the bank. It is also helping them see what kind of toys break<br/>
easily and how much they end up playing with them.<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest switches for me since I have loosened up controls is<br/>
seeing my kids as smart kids capable of making good decisions instead of<br/>
victims of marketing. I have to believe that my seeing them in this way<br/>
will only help them in the long run.<br/>

by refusing to get Barbie sheets (or whatever) for him if he wants<br/>
them.....but by living YOUR life according to your convictions.<br/>
<br/>
I am completely against conspicuous consumerism.  I think when we don&#39;t<br/>
value value....we lose something very important.  I think possessions are<br/>
over-rated.  My oldest, now 13, is only now able to see AND UNDERSTAND why I<br/>
live my life so differently from most of the people she knows.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how we manipulate a child&#39;s environment, I don&#39;t think we can<br/>
force that child to truly have the values we would choose.  The child might<br/>
learn not to argue about it because it makes life easier.  But for that<br/>
child to TRULY accept a value...it has to make sense to that child.<br/>

<br/>
Aaron (my 5yo) and I play a game with all the<br/>
advertising.  We started it a year ago, or so. <br/>
Whenever a commercial comes on for a toy or food or<br/>
something, we try to beat each other to say, &quot;I WANT<br/>
THAT!&quot;  Totally diffuses the power of the commercial.<br/>
<br/>
Recently we had a discussion about the difference<br/>
between the meanings of want and need.  So then he<br/>
added to our game, &quot;I WANT THAT! I NEED THAT!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You know, there was only one toy throughout the whole<br/>
Christmas season that he didn&#39;t play the game with? <br/>
It was Playdoh&#39;s Doh Doh Island.  For that toy, he<br/>
just watched, and then would say quietly, &quot;I hope I<br/>
get that for Christmas&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
He did.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193100905">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
Some of you know me from UnschoolingDiscussion.  My<br/>
name is Susan, I live in Virginia.  I have 3 beautiful<br/>
children (Sarah-14, Andrew-12, and Aaron-5) and a cool<br/>
DH named Ted.  We&#39;ve been homeschooling for 10 years,<br/>
and unschooling for the last 2 of those.<br/>

it so we cancelled it), but I think she&#39;s starting to...  she saw a lot of<br/>

~~~<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s important to note that the pictures are the guy&#39;s portfolio.  <br/>
Some of the pictures were for actual projects (Toy Story), but some of them <br/>
apparently had no link to any actual project.  And so the really bad picture of <br/>
the woman in the bikini was most likely photographed badly in the first place, <br/>
to make his changes, and thus his ability, appear more dramatic.  No <br/>
professional photographer would waste film on a model that was lighted so as to cast <br/>
deep shadows over the eyes, for instance.  Lots of the tricks are done with the <br/>
lighting and the camera, and this is a good example of that.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t actually think it&#39;s meant to be a commentary on how the fashion <br/>
industry operates.  Of course, they do retouch photos.  But let&#39;s see an actual <br/>
example from the cover of a magazine, eh?<br/>

I went further and saw the shoe. Shoes do actually look like his final<br/>
photograph when they come out of the box. But he started with a shoe that<br/>
was obviously worn and turned it into something that looked brand new. If a<br/>
company wanted him to photograph a shoe they&#39;d have given him some brand new<br/>
ones!<br/>

I think he was just trying to point out how easily manipulated a picture can <br/>
be and not to believe everything you see.  Thats his business fixing pictures.<br/>

actual <br/>
example from the cover of a magazine, eh? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We picked up a magazine that was anti-fashion last year (it was at Wild Oats, <br/>
and we were in line--) and it was showing people before and after make-up <br/>
(well yeah, that&#39;s why some people WEAR makeup, to look very different), and it <br/>
showed fashion poses lit well and badly.   But anyone who&#39;s photographed even <br/>
with a disposable camera has figured out there are some bad lighting conditions <br/>
and unfortunate poses.  And people who&#39;ve been to a portrait studio (not just <br/>
Sears, but even Sears or K-Mart have SOME fancy equipment) have seen <br/>
different kinds of lights, and diffusing cloths, and reflecting screens and them <br/>
saying tilt just a little *this* way.<br/>
<br/>
No matter how much lighting-magic or make-up, a person always looks better if <br/>
she has a look of interested curiosity or serenity or joy on her face than if <br/>
she looks surly or slow-minded, and those facial expressions can come and go <br/>
in the same person in the same set of photos!!<br/>

month about facial expressions, and they did a series<br/>
of photographs of several people, showing how their<br/>
facial expressions changed.<br/>
<br/>
I seem to recall it saying that a person&#39;s facial<br/>
expression changes every 2.5 seconds.<br/>

I wrote my college thesis (anthropology) on infomercials, technology and the<br/>
changing concepts of American identity.  I still LOVE to watch infomercials!<br/>
They are seductive, powerful pieces of advertising that are even more<br/>
hilarious when you dissect them a bit.  Watch for the &quot;show&quot; format and the<br/>
&quot;commercials&quot; in the middle of one (of course they advertise the product).<br/>
Also, try comparing the claims across products.  You will be skinnier,<br/>
richer, and happier whether you buy the rotisserie, the skin care line, the<br/>
gazelle-rider or the sell-your-own real estate program.  Oh yikes, don&#39;t<br/>
even get me started! LONG LIVE TONY ROBBINS!! LOL!!! ;)<br/>
