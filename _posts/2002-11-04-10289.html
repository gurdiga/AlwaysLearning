&lt;&lt; I wondered if a teacher would find it respectful for the principal <br/>
to require the teacher to earn breaks or get permission to use the <br/>
restroom.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not easy to get to the restroom when you&#39;re teaching.  Really.  When I <br/>
was teaching jr. high I was right across the hall from a girls&#39; room.  I <br/>
never used the teacher&#39;s.  It was far away.  But here are the problems:  <br/>
You&#39;re leaving the class unattended.  Depending on the barometric changes and <br/>
the mood of the group, that might not be advisable.  Some classes were calm <br/>
and collected, and that&#39;s when I&#39;d go.  A few had a kid who would NEVER pass <br/>
up a chance to act out, and if I left someone else would be bugged, hit, <br/>
irritated, have damage to his stuff, whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Also if I went in the restroom and girls were in there ditching or smoking or <br/>
whatever, it wasn&#39;t really okay for me to do or say nothing.  I was always on <br/>
duty, even if I just really wanted to sit in a quiet place for two minutes <br/>
and take a crap.<br/>
<br/>
And you do all honestly know or remember doing yourself just saying <br/>
&quot;bathroom&quot; in order to walk around, get into someone else&#39;s locker while <br/>
they&#39;re not there to defend it, or to peek in the window at your boyfriend?<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get into other lockers because I was lucky to remember the <br/>
combination to my own, but kids with good number memory could watch someone <br/>
open a locker and have it for the rest of the year.<br/>
<br/>
I know there are true stories of teachers being insensitive about kids <br/>
needing the bathroom.  <br/>
That&#39;s all true.  My kids have no concept of the idea of not going when they <br/>
need to.    But some people who haven&#39;t taught might have no concept of the <br/>
other side of the story.<br/>

habit of asking me to use the bathroom. This past summer, I finally told him <br/>
that he didn&#39;t have to ask me. So now he just tells me. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
The other day, one of my bestfriends called from a meeting in Kansas City to <br/>
ask me to go pick her son up from school. (I watch him after school for her.) <br/>
The school had called her on her cell and told her Travis had wet his pants <br/>
and needed a change. She told them I would pick him up for the rest of the <br/>
day. We got to the school and Jack asked Travis what had happened. Then he <br/>
asked was it because the teacher didn&#39;t see you raise your hand? Travis <br/>
looked down and said yes. The teacher was walking around the room helping <br/>
kids with an assignment and lots of other kids hands were raised. He said he <br/>
had tried to get his teachers attention by waving his hand and he even stood <br/>
up and called her name. She told him to sit down, and wait his turn. The <br/>
teacher was in the office when I got there to pick Travis up, and she made <br/>
the comment that children had to learn to wait. Travis looked up at me and <br/>
said, &quot;Nancy, I couldn&#39;t wait. It hurt so bad.&quot; Then he started to cry. I <br/>
started to cry. It was awful! I looked at the teacher and said, &quot;He isn&#39;t my <br/>
son and I can&#39;t speak for Sirena, but I hope that next time you have to pee, <br/>
the principal tells you that you have learn to wait.&quot; She just gave me a <br/>
funny look and said she doesn&#39;t have to ask the principal for permission to <br/>
use the bathroom, and I turned Travis and Jack out of the office and said <br/>
EXACTLY!  <br/>

<br/>
We were just there last October and I thought that was the perfect time. It <br/>
partly depends on what you want to do. If you want to do a lot of hiking, it <br/>
might be slippery - and although I am not the worrying parent in my <br/>
household, I was petrified hiking there! They have a good website with lots <br/>
of info.<br/>
<br/>
It is a truly awesome and amazing place.<br/>

maybe dangerous, but it&#39;s illegal to leave the kids alone.  You have <br/>
to wait until some other staff can be with them.  I remember being <br/>
pregnant with my first, and teaching.  I was so sick all the time, <br/>
and always having to run out of the room, fast.  Luckily I was <br/>
working with other teachers, so it wasn&#39;t so bad. <br/>

idea of homeschooling.  His son was in middle school, and having <br/>
terrible digestive problems...Turned out, he wouldn&#39;t use the <br/>
restrooms at school because there were no doors, no toilet paper, no <br/>
paper towels, and lots of bullies.  When my husband called the <br/>
principal, she said they just couldn&#39;t have tp, towels or doors, <br/>
because the kids just vandalized everything.  That&#39;s when my husband <br/>
dicided the socialization aspects of ps were not really necessary or <br/>
desireable after all.  <br/>

Not rainy.  Maybe snow, but it will evaporate the same day it snows, probably.<br/>
<br/>
For years we&#39;ve camped east of Phoenix in February.  Never snowed.  Has <br/>
rained a few times.  Gets to freezing at night sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The high desert is kinda like the moon.  We can have a temperature difference <br/>
of 35 degrees, just from the sun going down, or the sun coming out.  Look at <br/>
some weather charts with highs and lows.  <br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to be places like Minneapolis and Pennsylvania where it <br/>
didn&#39;t get cool at night, or didn&#39;t warm up in the daylight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-855827260">We went to the Grand Canyon early last spring and it was AWESOME!  It&#39;s not <br/>
so terribly hot and you can drive the whole length of the road (instead of <br/>
having to hop on a shuttle bus) *and* it&#39;s less crowded because so many <br/>
people are in school still.  (poor things.)  Winter/spring is probably the <br/>
very best time to go.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the south side and there are *lots* of really cool Indian ruins <br/>
and relics and such just to the east and NE.  You can walk right up and <br/>
touch some of them, climb inside and there&#39;s nobody around to give you the <br/>
evil eye... and no signs telling the kids to keep off/away/scram.  It&#39;s <br/>
terrific!<br/>
<br/>
As you leave the GC on the eastern most end, there&#39;s an archeological <br/>
village they&#39;ve dug out and re-created in some measure.  At that stop is a <br/>
little bookstore/gift shop.  We got lucky and hit on an older volunteer <br/>
there who when asked if there were any interesting archeological sites <br/>
nearby and finding out that we were homeschoolers, started holding forth on <br/>
this site and that one and how this one is busy, but that one is more <br/>
interesting even though hardly anyone ever goes there....  etc.  It might <br/>
have helped that we were buying some books on Indian art and fables at the <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe if you&#39;re lucky, she&#39;ll be there when you go through.  If not, get a <br/>
good map and just go exploring.  You&#39;re bound to hit something <br/>
great!  (although after a while, all the red cliff faces start to look the <br/>
teensiest bit alike...)<br/>
Take lots of film!<br/>

&gt; Sandra already responded to this and gave wonderful answers.<br/>
&gt; But about the weather, it&#39;s really hard to tell.<br/>
&gt; This is supposed to be an El Nino year, so there is an increased<br/>
&gt; chance for rain/snow this winter, so they say. In December, the usual<br/>
&gt; highs in the desert are in the 70&#39;s, and could be in the 50&#39;s as you<br/>
&gt; climb in elevation. It does get very cold at night like Sandra said,<br/>
&gt; even in the desert. We were at the Grand Canyon one year in April<br/>
&gt; after a freak spring snow storm. It was positively ICY at night (maybe<br/>
&gt; in the 20&#39;s or teens), walking around looking at the stars (we spent<br/>
&gt; the night there).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bring your winter clothes and a good jacket for night time.<br/>
&gt; But I&#39;d also bring some lighter clothes too, just in case. The weather<br/>
&gt; can be unpredictable that way.<br/>

think it&#39;s the closest major city to the Grand Canyon.<br/>
<br/>
Phoenix to G.C. is about a 4-5 hour drive. It&#39;ll be beautiful in December.<br/>
It&#39;s beautiful right now as a matter of fact. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra already responded to this and gave wonderful answers.<br/>
But about the weather, it&#39;s really hard to tell.<br/>
This is supposed to be an El Nino year, so there is an increased chance for<br/>
rain/snow this winter, so they say.<br/>
In December, the usual highs in the desert are in the 70&#39;s, and could be in<br/>
the 50&#39;s as you climb in elevation.<br/>
It does get very cold at night like Sandra said, even in the desert.<br/>
We were at the Grand Canyon one year in April after a freak spring snow<br/>
storm.<br/>
It was positively ICY at night (maybe in the 20&#39;s or teens), walking around<br/>
looking at the stars (we spent the night there).<br/>
<br/>
Bring your winter clothes and a good jacket for night time.<br/>
But I&#39;d also bring some lighter clothes too, just in case. The weather can<br/>
be unpredictable that way.<br/>

we generally stop there as a rest stop between Alb and Flagstaff.  In <br/>
December it will be nice, not hot.  They have a privately run cafe, a <br/>
nice visitor&#39;s center, etc.  If you plan to stay more than 45 minutes <br/>
there, then you would want to find a hotel at the nearest town.  If you <br/>
really want to talk to someone who knows all these areas very well and <br/>
can help you plan your trip, you might be able to talk with my dad.  He <br/>
could help you figure out miles where to stay, etc.  And he knows the <br/>
Arizona/New Mexico/four corners area very well.  Let me know if you wish <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1672199968">We are going to Vegas in two weeks.  My kids LOVE vegas.  What do we do <br/>
there...<br/>
<br/>
The star trek experience.  It is really cool, if you are a trekie, or <br/>
like the show a great deal.  It&#39;s 26 bucks for a day pass, you can go as <br/>
many times as you like...<br/>
<br/>
There are buffets. My kids love them.  They are cheap and some are very <br/>
good.  Avoid Circus Circus, it&#39;s yucky.  Mandalay bay is really good, <br/>
but also very expensive.  If you go on weekdays, you can get a hotel for <br/>
20 bucks and since food is cheap too, it&#39;s a deal.  Some of the hotels <br/>
have fun stuff for the kids.  Circus circus has some shows, the castle <br/>
one has some shows, one that Lexie loved which involved women dressed as <br/>
princesses and they sang songs and called kids up on stage to help sing. <br/>
 We were going every other week for a few months and lexie became a <br/>
favorite of them and was called up on stage each time we went, which was <br/>
3-4x each weekend.  There are train shuttles between the casinos, and <br/>
that&#39;s fun for the kids and a couple of the casinos have amusement parks <br/>
with rollercoasters, etc.  Circus Circus has a nice indoor amusement <br/>
park with shows and rides, most of which are good for kids ages 4-10 or <br/>
so.  At least Lexie, at age 4, enjoyed them.  There is the m&m store, <br/>
which we love, it has m&ms in all colors, including lots of different <br/>
purples, pinks, black, white, etc.  Very cool, and expensive, but fun <br/>
gifts.  Hoover Dam is close and the tour is worth it if you have kids <br/>
ages maybe 5 and older, we enjoyed it last time we went.  It&#39;s a <br/>
specatular dam and the history behind it and the men that died building <br/>
it, etc. is facinating.  Laughlin is fun for a night, cheap room rates <br/>
(on weekdays), the river boat tour is great there, bowling, and eating <br/>
at buffets.  My kids absolutely love buffets and they have it down.  We <br/>
go at 1030ish, eat breakfast, hang out while they set up lunch and then <br/>
eat lunch and lunch deserts, all for the cheaper price of breakfast. <br/>
 Then we eat a late buffet dinner, like 7ish, and no other meals. <br/>
 Buffets run from $2-3 per young kid, to $5 for older kid, adults are <br/>
from $6 for breakfast to $12 at the more expensive buffets, but we <br/>
generally stick to the middle price ones, and usually spend less than <br/>
$20 per meal.  We walk through the casino part of the hotels really <br/>
quickly, and spend our time elsewhere.  December in vegas is very nice, <br/>
the nights are cool, the days are comfortable, and early december won&#39;t <br/>
be busy, especially on a weekday so you&#39;ll get good room rates, and <br/>
incentives, like free breakfast buffets, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
My dad is more than willing to talk to you and help you plan an <br/>
itenerary.  He likes doing things like this.  so if you want his number...<br/>
