<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029062299">Isn&#39;t it amazing that George Carlin - mouthy comedian of the 70&#39;s, <br/>

<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The paradox of our time in history is that we have taller buildings <br/>
but shorter tempers, wider freeways, but narrower viewpoints. We <br/>
spend more, but have less, we buy more, but enjoy less. We have <br/>
bigger houses and smaller families, more conveniences, but less <br/>
time. We have more degrees but less sense, more knowledge, but less <br/>
judgment, more experts, yet more problems, more medicine, but less <br/>
wellness.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We drink too much, smoke too much, spend too recklessly, laugh too <br/>
little, drive too fast, get too angry, stay up too late, get up too <br/>
tired, read too little, watch TV too much, and pray too seldom. We <br/>
have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values. We talk too <br/>
much, love too seldom, and hate too often.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve learned how to make a living, but not a life. We&#39;ve added <br/>
years to life not life to years. We&#39;ve been all the way to the moon <br/>
and back, but have trouble crossing the street to meet a new <br/>
neighbor. We conquered outer space but not inner space. We&#39;ve done <br/>
larger things, but not better things.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul.. We&#39;ve conquered <br/>
the atom, but not our prejudice. We write more, but learn less. We <br/>
plan more, but accomplish less. We&#39;ve learned to rush, but not to <br/>
wait. We build more computers to hold more information, to produce <br/>
more copies than ever, but we communicate less and less.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion, big men and <br/>
small character, steep profits and shallow relationships. These are <br/>
the days of two incomes but more divorce, fancier houses, but broken <br/>
homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, throwaway <br/>
morality, one night stands, overweight bodies, and pills that do <br/>
everything from cheer, to quiet, to kill. It is a time when there is <br/>
much in the showroom window and nothing in the stockroom. A time <br/>
when technology can bring this letter to you, and a time when you <br/>
can choose either to share this insight, or to just hit delete.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Remember, spend some time with your loved ones, because they are not <br/>
going to be around forever. Remember, say a kind word to someone who <br/>
looks up to you in awe, because that little person soon will grow up <br/>
and leave your side. Remember, to give a warm hug to the one next to <br/>
you, because that is the only treasure you can give with your heart <br/>
and it doesn&#39;t cost a cent.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Remember, to say, &quot;I love you&quot; to your partner and your loved ones, <br/>
but most of all mean it. A kiss and an embrace will mend hurt when <br/>
it comes from deep inside of you. Remember to hold hands and cherish <br/>
the moment for someday that person will not be there again. Give <br/>
time to love, give time to speak, and give time to share the <br/>
precious thoughts in your mind.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Life is not measured by the number of breaths we take, but by the <br/>
moments that take our breath away.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your welcome!<br/>

he didn&#39;t write it.<br/>

the original, it mentions what an inspiring kind of guy the original author<br/>
was.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what Snopes has to say:<br/>
===========================<br/>
Origins: Â  In  May 1998, Jeff Dickson posted the &#39;Paradox of Our Time&#39; essay<br/>
to his Hacks-R-Us online forum, loosing it upon the Internet. The essay has<br/>
since been attributed to comedian George Carlin, an unnamed Columbine High<br/>
School student, and that most prolific of scribes, Anonymous.<br/>
George Carlin very emphatically denied he had had anything to do with<br/>
&quot;Paradox,&quot; a piece he referred to as &quot;a sappy load of shit,&quot; and posted his<br/>
comments about being associated with this essay on his own web site.<br/>
The true author of the piece is neither George Carlin nor Jeff Dickson, nor<br/>
is he anonymous. Credit belongs with Dr. Bob Moorehead, former pastor of<br/>
Seattle&#39;s Overlake Christian Church. (He retired in 1998 after 29 years in<br/>
that post). The essay appeared under the title &quot;The Paradox of Our Age&quot; in<br/>
Words Aptly Spoken, Dr. Moorehead&#39;s 1995 collection of prayers, homilies,<br/>
and monologues used in his sermons and radio broadcasts:<br/>
<br/>
The Paradox of Our Age<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have taller buildings but shorter tempers; wider freeways but narrower<br/>
&gt; viewpoints; we spend more but have less; we buy more but enjoy it less; we<br/>
&gt; have bigger houses and smaller families; more conveniences, yet less time; we<br/>
&gt; have more degrees but less sense; more knowledge but less judgement; more<br/>
&gt; experts, yet more problems; we have more gadgets but less satisfaction; more<br/>
&gt; medicine, yet less wellness; we take more vitamins but see fewer results. We<br/>
&gt; drink too much; smoke too much; spend too recklessly; laugh too little; drive<br/>
&gt; too fast; get too angry quickly; stay up too late; get up too tired; read too<br/>
&gt; seldom; watch TV too much and pray too seldom.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values; we fly in faster<br/>
&gt; planes to arrive there quicker, to do less and return sooner; we sign more<br/>
&gt; contracts only to realize fewer profits; we talk too much; love too seldom and<br/>
&gt; lie too often. We&#39;ve learned how to make a living, but not a life; we&#39;ve added<br/>
&gt; years to life, not life to years. We&#39;ve been all the way to the moon and back,<br/>
&gt; but have trouble crossing the street to meet the new neighbor. We&#39;ve conquered<br/>
&gt; outer space, but not inner space; we&#39;ve done larger things, but not better<br/>
&gt; things; we&#39;ve cleaned up the air, but polluted the soul; we&#39;ve split the atom,<br/>
&gt; but not our prejudice; we write more, but learn less; plan more, but<br/>
&gt; accomplish less; we make faster planes, but longer lines; we learned to rush,<br/>
&gt; but not to wait; we have more weapons, but less peace; higher incomes, but<br/>
&gt; lower morals; more parties, but less fun; more food, but less appeasement;<br/>
&gt; more acquaintances, but fewer friends; more effort, but less success. We build<br/>
&gt; more computers to hold more information, to produce more copies than ever, but<br/>
&gt; have less communication; drive smaller cars that have bigger problems; build<br/>
&gt; larger factories that produce less. We&#39;ve become long on quantity, but short<br/>
&gt; on quality. <br/>
<br/>
&gt; These are the times of fast foods and slow digestion; tall men, but short<br/>
&gt; character; steep in profits, but shallow relationships. These are times of<br/>
&gt; world peace, but domestic warfare; more leisure and less fun; higher postage,<br/>
&gt; but slower mail; more kinds of food, but less nutrition. These are days of two<br/>
&gt; incomes, but more divorces; these are times of fancier houses, but broken<br/>
&gt; homes. These are days of quick trips, disposable diapers, cartridge living,<br/>
&gt; thow-away morality, one-night stands, overweight bodies and pills that do<br/>
&gt; everything from cheer, to prevent, quiet or kill. It is a time when there is<br/>
&gt; much in the show window and nothing in the stock room. Indeed, these are the<br/>
&gt; times! <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Those intent upon taking inspiration from &quot;Paradox&quot; should consider the<br/>
following: during Bob Moorehead&#39;s tenure as pastor of Overlake Christian<br/>
Church, seventeen members of his congregation reported that he had sexually<br/>
assaulted them. These allegations, which surfaced in 1997, prompted his<br/>
resignation in 1998. After a year of publicly supporting Moorehead the<br/>
church elders withdrew their support, their own investigation into the<br/>
charges having led them to conclude their pastor had indeed been guilty of<br/>
molesting a number of male churchgoers.<br/>
<br/>
Its true authorship aside, the piece picked up its attribution to an unnamed<br/>
student who witnessed the killings at Littleton in the aftermath of 20 April<br/>
1999, while America was still struggling to make sense of that day&#39;s<br/>
horrific events. The killings at Columbine shook us deeply, leaving behind a<br/>
nation of survivors looking for the one set of answers which could begin to<br/>
explain the horrifically inexplicable. Having this essay flow from the pen<br/>
of an unnamed student who bore witness to this unspeakable act of violence<br/>
made sense Â surely such a teen would have valuable words of wisdom or<br/>
cautions we all should heed. The oft-repeated header &quot;A Columbine High<br/>
School student wrote&quot; infused the essay with the significance and meaning<br/>
folks thirsted for. (This belief that witnessing a tragedy or losing a loved<br/>
one imbues a person with special insight into the causes and cures of<br/>
society&#39;s ills also fuels the Internet version of the testimony given before<br/>
the House judiciary committee by Darrell Scott, father of Rachel Scott, one<br/>
of the teens murdered at Columbine High School.)<br/>
<br/>
It felt right that this essay emerge from the horror that was the Columbine<br/>
massacre. Certainly someone somewhere had to be able to make sense of all<br/>
this. Certainly some good, some protection against future acts of random<br/>
insanity, had to come out of all this grief and loss, else what had it all<br/>
been for? Yet that was not the case. The essay which has come to be called<br/>
&quot;The Paradox of Our Time&quot; was written at least four years before the<br/>
killings in Littleton, Colorado. There was no association between the essay<br/>
and the shootings, though many felt at least momentarily comforted by the<br/>
notion that there had been.<br/>
<br/>
We like pieces such as &quot;The Paradox of Our Time&quot; because they summarize all<br/>
the problems of modern society into a neat laundry list of &quot;What Has Gone<br/>
Wrong&quot; while presenting possible solutions by way of juxtaposition. The<br/>
pairing of &quot;We have multiplied our possessions, but reduced our values,&quot; for<br/>
example, implies that increased affluence is responsible for a decline in<br/>
morality and carries the underlying implication that if we turn our backs on<br/>
the almighty dollar, our kids will no longer murder one another.<br/>
<br/>
Clear-cut cause-and-effect pairings provide far more comfort than does<br/>
accepting the harsh reality that we live in a world of no assurances at all,<br/>
a world where bad things can happen at any moment, to anyone, for no<br/>
discernable (and thus no preventable) reason. Our ancestors coped with that<br/>
feeling of powerlessness by inventing myths about petty, lust-filled,<br/>
vengeful gods who, even if they were capricious in their actions and<br/>
insensible to the human misery their warring caused, were at least tangible<br/>
entities who could be identified as the cause of otherwise unfathomable<br/>
catastrophes. Our sophistication has loosed us from our belief in those<br/>
myths, leaving us vulnerable to a sense of a world careening out of control.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I clicked on the link to George Carlin&#39;s site and here&#39;s what he has to say<br/>
about The Paradox of Our Time. (Warning, contains some of seven words you<br/>
can never (or used to not be able to! ;-) say on television. BTW he now has<br/>
2443 dirty words collected at his website to expand on those initial 7.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &quot;PARADOX OF OUR TIME&quot;<br/>
&gt; One of the more embarrassing items making the internet/e-mail rounds is a<br/>
&gt; sappy load of shit called &quot;The Paradox of Our Time.&quot; The main problem I have<br/>
&gt; with it is that as true as some of the expressed sentiments may be, who really<br/>
&gt; gives a shit? Certainly not me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I figured out years ago that the human species is totally fucked and has been<br/>
&gt; for a long time. I also know that the sick, media-consumer culture in America<br/>
&gt; continues to make this so-called problem worse. But the trick, folks, is not<br/>
&gt; to give a fuck. Like me. I really don&#39;t care. I stopped worrying about all<br/>
&gt; this temporal bullshit a long time ago. It&#39;s meaningless. (See the preface of<br/>
&gt; &quot;Braindroppings.&quot;)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another problem I have with &quot;Paradox&quot; is that the ideas are all expressed in a<br/>
&gt; sort of pseudo-spiritual, New-Age-y, &quot;Gee-whiz-can&#39;t-we-do-better-than-this&quot;<br/>
&gt; tone of voice. It&#39;s not only bad prose and poetry, it&#39;s weak philosophy. I<br/>
&gt; hope I never sound like that.<br/>
