<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342365657">I didn&#39;t ask last year, but here&#39;s a polite passing-of-the-hat, for expenses for last year and this. Thanks for considering it!<br/>

The more people who post here, the busier this forum can be, so please do think of questions to stir Always Learning up!  I’m happy to participate.<br/>
<br/>
If you don’t have a question, but there’s a topic you think would be good for people to remember, or to play around with, bring it up!  Or send me a note if you’re shy, and I can.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>
