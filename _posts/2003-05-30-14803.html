&lt;&lt; So then I married my husband and he loved names like Agustus and <br/>
Americanus.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I keep trying to sell people on &quot;Americus&quot; as an SCA name.  &quot;Americus <br/>
Vespucci&quot; is SUCH a cool name.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s SCA  name (self chosen) is Bardolf.  I advertised for &quot;Bardolf <br/>
Vespucci&quot; for a while, but he wasn&#39;t going for it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
