<div id="ygrps-yiv-1551649997">I&#39;m a terrible blogger. I keep trying. I write prolifically on lists, <br/>
like this one, but go completely blank when I try to write on a blog.<br/>
<br/>
So - I have this little unschooling blog. It doesn&#39;t have a lot on it. <br/>
It is over a year old and I thought I&#39;d write more and collect more <br/>
stuff on it, but I haven&#39;t. I did just put the post about lazy <br/>
unschoolers there, and I took a look and thought there is just enough <br/>
that I should go ahead and tell people it exists. I&#39;m not making <br/>
promises, but my intention is to pay more attention to what I write on <br/>
lists or to individuals and to put more of that on the blog. If anybody <br/>
ever has the urge to remind me, it will always be appreciated, that&#39;s <br/>
for sure. I think I&#39;m good at responding to questions, but not in coming <br/>
up with them myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-620066908">Unschooling is really impossible to confuse with being lazy. It takes a <br/>
lot of time and energy and thought on the part of the parent. Now, for <br/>
some people, it is SO fun that it seems easy — just like anything else, <br/>
when you’re loving what you’re doing, it doesn’t seem like work.<br/>
<br/>
But – it really does take a lot of time and devotion and focus — the <br/>
parent needs to really think about the child. A LOT. The parent needs to <br/>
bring interesting things and ideas and experiences to the child and this <br/>
means being always on the lookout for what the child might enjoy. It <br/>
means becoming super aware of your child – not only getting a good sense <br/>
of what might interest him or her, but how does h/she express that <br/>
interest and what is the best way for you to offer new and potentially <br/>
interesting ideas, experiences, and things. The parent needs to consider <br/>
when and how to support the child in further pursuing a current interest <br/>
and when the child might be more interested in moving on to something <br/>
else. The parent needs to be aware of when the child needs someone to <br/>
talk to and be with and interact with and when the child needs more <br/>
solitary time to think and pursue an interest on his/her own. The parent <br/>
needs to get a sense of when the kid needs a more active social life and <br/>
when he needs to meet some new people or when he needs help in staying <br/>
connected with old friends.<br/>
<br/>
The parent needs to be so aware of the child that the parent <br/>
automatically thinks of him/her and partially sees the world through<br/>
h/her eyes.<br/>
<br/>
This is all a tall order. Overly self-centered people can’t do it <br/>
because it requires a lot of empathy. People with too many personal<br/>
problems that they haven’t addressed in their own lives probably can’t <br/>
do it because they are too distracted by those. People who are too <br/>
negative or cynical can’t do it because they tend to crush interest and <br/>
joy, not build it up. People who lack curiosity and a certain amount of <br/>
gusto for life can’t really do it.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, we grow into it. Turns out that we parents learn, too <br/>
&lt;g&gt;. So – when we are making moves, taking steps, in the direction of <br/>
unschooling, turns out the trail starts to open up in front of us and we <br/>
get more and more sure-footed as we travel the unschooling path.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion is that you ask yourself really honestly, is there <br/>
something more I could be doing for my child that would enhance my<br/>
child’s life? If the answer is yes, then make the choice to do it. Then <br/>
ask this question of yourself again and again and, each time, make the <br/>
life-enriching choice. Apply this to small things and to big momentous <br/>
decisions. Small things – could I make something for dinner that would <br/>
be special and interesting? Did I see a cool rock on the ground outside <br/>
– could I bring it in and wash it and set it on the table for others to <br/>
notice. Big things – would my child enjoy traveling – can we take a <br/>
family vacation that involves exploring things my child would find <br/>
interesting?<br/>
<br/>
In unschooling, “lazy” means not thinking about enriching and enhancing <br/>
your child’s life. You change this by doing it – one choice at a time.<br/>

<br/>
As much as it pains me to disagree with Pam Sorooshian, I disagree.<br/>
<br/>
GOOD unschooling, responsible unschooling isn&#39;t lazy.<br/>
<br/>
But there are moms who get tired of using a curriculum, or stress  <br/>
comes into their lives, or someone is dying or wounded, and they go a  <br/>
few months without the curriculum, or maybe a year, and they look back  <br/>
and say &quot;Oh! We were unschooling.  I guess we&#39;ll keep unschooling.&quot;   <br/>
And that can turn to lazy being called unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling done right is not laziness and doesn&#39;t allow for much  <br/>
laziness.<br/>
<br/>
Laziness (or just the lack of doing much for and with one&#39;s children)  <br/>
can be and has been called &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Then people like me say  <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s not unschooling,&quot; and people who aren&#39;t doing much for or with  <br/>
their children get all torqued and tell me I can&#39;t tell them they&#39;re  <br/>
not unschoolers, that I don&#39;t own unschooling.<br/>
<br/>

people say that kind of thing, too, but it is clearly not justifiable to <br/>

You&#39;re right BUT..... I bet there are hundreds of thousands of  <br/>
&quot;Calvert Curriculum users&quot; who bought it, got the receipt, put the  <br/>
books on the shelf, and didn&#39;t finish it all, or half, or 2/3, but  <br/>
they still have the receipts and they still have the books.  And so if  <br/>
someone says &quot;What curriculum?&quot; they say &quot;Calvert.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And in the say way I bet there are dozens of hundreds of unschoolers  <br/>
who start to unschool, but they really don&#39;t get it, but they&#39;ll say  <br/>
&quot;I read x and y magazines, and am on a, b and c unschooling  <br/>

Jill, if you come up with question prompts, could you put them out on the list so others can pick them up and blog too?  I deal with similar issues as Pam does!  It would be really wonderful to have more ideas and then see how others take them too.  I know there was a blog carnival thing on the family run list for a while, I never seemed able to participate, for some reason the ideas were too vague to me.  We could do it blog carnival style or just casual, which would be my preference.  You are good at coming up with ideas!<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
And THAT is where we get into the whole &quot;what is unschooling&quot; thing and who gets to define it!  I&#39;m pretty clear about what it looks like in my own house, but there are plenty of others that &quot;unschool&quot; and use charter schools or free schools and still call themselves unschoolers, or who put their kids in so many classes they have no down time.  I&#39;m left scratching my head a little wondering where they ever got the idea that they were unschoolers.  They may be super fantastic parents and the kids may be super fantastic kids and there is nothing wrong with making decisions like that for themselves, but I wonder why they call themselves unschoolers? <br/>
<br/>
 I think this is where the idea of &quot;child led&quot; gets really intertwined and mixed up into unschooling, and makes it look like unschooling is something different than what it really is.  The child might lead a parent to enroll them into a charter school, but that doesn&#39;t mean they are unschooling.  If Chamille decided to go to school, she&#39;d no longer be unschooling, she would be schooling by her choice and I&#39;d be perfectly fine with that, well maybe a wee bit cringing, but mostly fine.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think there will ever be concensus on this. People like to define each other and people like to define themselves. <br/>
<br/>
We are unschoolers. I *get* it. We haven&#39;t always unschooled. We are still deschooling in many ways. But there really is no doubt in my mind we are unschoolers. <br/>
<br/>
However, I&#39;m quite positive...there are some who would define us as *eclectic homeschoolers* or *lazy unschoolers* or *academic homeschoolers* or any number of other things. <br/>
<br/>
That is what people do. <br/>
<br/>
I am interested in experiencing more joy and inspiration in my life. I am interested in experiencing more interconnectedness with my kids...more of a partnership...I want to *allow* them to explore the world and interests that are important to them. I want to help their passions, goals, dreams etc come to life...as best I can...in a non-meddling sort of way. <br/>
<br/>
So...I say...we unschool. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure other disagree. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1128981210">+++Why would they define you in that way? Because you are not <br/>
unschoolers, yet?+++<br/>
<br/>
We are unschoolers. It&#39;s just that people like to define others. And some unschoolers are very dogmatic about unschooling. I&#39;m not really dogmatic about anything. <br/>
<br/>
I see unschooling as a spectrum. I can see how people say...unschooling &quot;except for math&quot;....I may not *agree* with it but I get what they are talking about. I *get* both sides. I see why they call themselves unschoolers and I see why others say that&#39;s not unschooling. But I personally don&#39;t make anykind of final call on it myself. <br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>
<br/>
I often compare stuff like this to veganism. I am currently vegan. I have been vegan on and off for a good chunk of my adult life. I have only recently (the last three years or so) embraced the label vegan. Otherwise I just called myself vegetarian....and that was because I was intimidated by others...who may not think I was being vegan *enough*<br/>
<br/>
I eat honey. I occasionally will have eggs...ONLY if they are either ours (from our chickens) or I know exactly how the hens are treated and where they are coming from. We are talking maybe a dozen eggs a year if that.   <br/>
<br/>
Now, there are people that would scream...YOU AREN&#39;T VEGAN!! And get quite angry about it. <br/>
<br/>
Kind of how I used to feel about people who call themselves vegetarian but still occasionally eats fish. It used to drive me nuts! Because well...fish isn&#39;t a vegetable, LOL. <br/>
<br/>
But then I decided to take a long hard look at things. What is it I wanted? I wanted to reduce suffering. I wanted people to eat more with compassion. Well, if someone is vegetarian all year but aises their own turkeys to eat on Thanksgiving and Christmas does it really matter what they call themselves?  They are way closer to vegetarian than anything else. <br/>
<br/>
AND they are ultimately reducing suffering...something I can totally get on board with.<br/>
<br/>
So, I guess I don&#39;t see why it&#39;s not possible to look at unschooling in the same manner. I don&#39;t agree with the all or nothing approach....but I do *understand* it. :)<br/>
<br/>
+++And do you unschool, then? Just curious &lt;g&gt;+++<br/>
<br/>
Yes and I would say we strongly lean toward the whole-life/radical unschooling end of the spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
:)<br/>

If you call yourself an unschooler, but you assign lessons, reading, <br/>
give tests, or grades, then I&#39;d probably think you don&#39;t get what <br/>
unschooling is (sorry - couldn&#39;t resist). I wouldn&#39;t bother to tell you <br/>
what I think unless there was a really good reason, though.I have a <br/>
friend who used Calvert Curriculum - graded her kids assignment with <br/>
letter grades, made her son a transcript that included Cs and Bs, not <br/>
all As. She sometimes referred to them unschooling - I just smiled and <br/>
let it slide. On the other hand, if she was going around speaking at <br/>
conference and talking about unschooling and making herself a public <br/>
figure, I would probably speak up to say that I didn&#39;t think what she <br/>
was promoting was unschooling.<br/>

When you define terminology that people assign to themselves...then you are defining people...whether you mean to or not.<br/>
<br/>
If someone says &quot;I&#39;m an unschooler.&quot; And because of how you see them behave or hear them talk you say &quot;That is not unschooling&quot; then you are defining them as &quot;not unschoolers&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Yes, this is part of how humans sort themselves into groups and find  <br/>
what is like and unlike each other.<br/>
<br/>
-=-We are unschoolers. I *get* it. We haven&#39;t always unschooled. We  <br/>
are still deschooling in many ways. But there really is no doubt in  <br/>
my mind we are unschoolers.<br/>
However, I&#39;m quite positive...there are some who would define us as  <br/>
*eclectic homeschoolers* or *lazy unschoolers* or *academic  <br/>
homeschoolers* or any number of other things.<br/>
That is what people do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If what you mean is that people look at what someone says and  <br/>
compares it against what they do and make discernments about if they  <br/>
match, then yes, I agree. But I dont think that anyone is about to  <br/>
call Sandra Dodd or Pam Sorooshian or Joyce Fetteroll eclectic  <br/>
homeschoolers, or lazy unschoolers or academic unschoolers. What they  <br/>
write about and what they live and how they have raised their  <br/>
children are the same. There is no &quot;do what I say, not as I do&quot;,  <br/>
there is no disconnect between what they say and how they live.<br/>
<br/>
No one could say that they were something they were not. And if  <br/>
someone did say something they werent, they&#39;d be able to describe,  <br/>
clearly, why they were not, and they wouldnt be like, oh, well,  <br/>
whatever, &#39;words, schwords&#39;. Because thinking and writing clearly and  <br/>
accurately and truthfully DOES matter. And writing to a list about  <br/>
radically unschooling about why its ok and not really that much  <br/>
different and no big deal to be lazy or eclectic or unschool  <br/>
academically just doesn&#39;t make much sense to me at all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-749223262">I&#39;ve always resisted labels for this very reason, Joyce. When I was a kid,<br/>
the word &quot;lazy&quot; was often applied to me but I eventually realized that<br/>
&quot;lazy&quot; meant something different from what I was, the definition was mostly<br/>
&quot;being like a child&quot; which is what I was! It wasn&#39;t as personal as I once<br/>
thought. &quot;Lazy&quot; was/maybe still is a concept that was intended to push kids<br/>
through to adulthood by skipping the inconvenience of growth. It&#39;s one of<br/>
the less happy examples of what happens when we &quot;stand next to puddles&quot; or<br/>
identify with labels. But even a good connotation put on a label can have an<br/>
unflattering effect on the people wearing said label.<br/>

The purpose of this list isn&#39;t to certify anyone an unschooler or  <br/>

to help those who DO want to understand unschooling at its deepest  <br/>

<br/>
There are people who like to think unschooling doesn&#39;t have any deep  <br/>
levels.  There are others who have not compromised their unschooling,  <br/>
who haven&#39;t gone back and forth from a curriculum to unschooling, from  <br/>
school to school at home, and &quot;back to unschooling.&quot;<br/>

There are people here who know people who HAVE done all of the above,  <br/>

Some people who take real money to speak at conferences about  <br/>
unschooling have kids who went to school.  If they &quot;got it&quot; (enough to  <br/>
charge hundreds or a thousand dollars to speak), why couldn&#39;t they do  <br/>
it?   (If they didn&#39;t get it or dedicate themselves to it, why be  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1892518634">I thought similar things when I read that. David was a vegetarian for a long time before he and I got together. It was important to him, his vegetarianism. I&#39;ve never been a vegetarian. I&#39;m an omnivore. Although the omni- was fairly limited for a long time. And David joined me, more and more, in my meat eating. Not out of pressure from me, but because he wanted to, for whatever reason. But he still called himself a vegetarian. One day he realised he was holding on to a label because it was an important part of how he defined himself. But it didn&#39;t fit anymore. The fact that he eats meat, occasionally, doesn&#39;t make him a good or a bad person, unless you are a chicken. He just likes to eat meat sometimes.  <br/>
<br/>
I suppose being labelled a vegetarian is a kind of a granfalloon, &quot;a proud and meaningless association of human beings.&quot; The assertion of being a vegetarian gave him something to hitch onto. However, coming onto a list that is about vegetarianism and saying that those folks who eat meat at holidays or who eat meat only once a month can be vegetarians too, well that feels strange. It&#39;s like coming on to a list that is about unschooling and saying that people can label themselves unschoolers even if it is just about intent and that should be fine. I met a woman who told me that she was an unschooler because she let her children switch from a subject or stay on a topic for longer or shorter periods of time than the curriculum she followed advised. That&#39;s a big stretch. I didn&#39;t argue, I didn&#39;t burst her granfalloon, but I recognized that she wasn&#39;t likely to be someone who I&#39;d look to for advise on how to unschool better. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-109512761">-=-I often compare stuff like this to veganism. I am currently vegan.  <br/>
I have been vegan on and off for a good chunk of my adult life. I  <br/>
have only recently (the last three years or so) embraced the label  <br/>
vegan. Otherwise I just called myself vegetarian....and that was  <br/>
because I was intimidated by others...who may not think I was being  <br/>
vegan *enough*<br/>
<br/>
I eat honey. I occasionally will have eggs...ONLY if they are either  <br/>
ours (from our chickens) or I know exactly how the hens are treated  <br/>
and where they are coming from. We are talking maybe a dozen eggs a  <br/>
year if that.<br/>
<br/>
Now, there are people that would scream...YOU AREN&#39;T VEGAN!! And get  <br/>
quite angry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Kind of how I used to feel about people who call themselves  <br/>
vegetarian but still occasionally eats fish. It used to drive me  <br/>
nuts! Because well...fish isn&#39;t a vegetable, LOL. -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
What I dont understand is why you feel like you need to embrace the  <br/>
label of Vegan, especially if you are not actually vegan. Vegan is  <br/>
pretty specific, it means no animal products. It doesnt mean, no  <br/>
animal products except twice a year or whenever you want.  If you use  <br/>
animal products or eat animal products, of what use is it call  <br/>
yourself Vegan? Who cares?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Well, if someone is vegetarian all year but aises their own  <br/>
turkeys to eat on Thanksgiving and Christmas does it really matter  <br/>
what they call themselves? They are way closer to vegetarian than  <br/>
anything else.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I suppose it doesn&#39;t matter what anyone calls themselves, especially  <br/>
if they dont care about being understood, trusted or believed. But I  <br/>
think its actually useful and important to use accurate and truthful  <br/>
words to communicate. That is why there are so many words to choose  <br/>
from. You dont have to say Vegan if you are not Vegan.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, I could tell myself and my husband that I am Faithful, and I  <br/>
am pretty sure that he would understand that to mean that I wasnt  <br/>
involved in a sexual relationship with another person. So, if he  <br/>
found out that every year at my office party, I fooled around with a  <br/>
coworker, I dont think it would fly for me to say, well, &quot;I&#39;m way  <br/>
closer to Faithful than anything else&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
However,I suppose since,  in the case of Unschooling, no one is  <br/>
committing or promising anything to anyone (Like being faithful to a  <br/>
spouse). So,  I guess if you are talking to your neighbors and  <br/>
friends you can (anyone can) say whatever you want about what you do.  <br/>
As Robyn points out, no Unschooling Police are going to come arrest  <br/>
you for false claims. No goon squad is coming to beat you up for  <br/>
saying you unschool if you dont or if you do unschool in the mornings  <br/>
or except for math or if you unschool in the summer while your kids  <br/>
are on school vacation.<br/>
<br/>
But like if Pam said, you were at an Unschooling conference or if you  <br/>
were writing advice to a radical Unschooling list, and you are  <br/>
advocating anything except real, actual unschooling, it does matter  <br/>
what you say and the words you choose.<br/>

But Nancy, look at the money you saved not buying that co-worker a  <br/>
gift!  It&#39;s Christmas.<br/>

<br/>
Honestly, the example above made me laugh out loud.  No one&#39;s around  <br/>
to hear me, though.<br/>
<br/>
Holly doesn&#39;t eat as much meat as others in the family.  She&#39;s not  <br/>
vegetarian, but we often make a meatless version of whatever we&#39;re  <br/>
doing, or at least save out some noodles before mixing meat into the  <br/>
noodles or pasta.  We say &quot;She doesn&#39;t like meat much&quot; when people ask  <br/>
about her dietary preferences.  I much prefer chicken and fish to  <br/>
beef, and always have.  Lots of people will draw the line at beef.    <br/>
But sometimes I eat a hamburger with gusto.  And in the past few  <br/>
months I&#39;ve been drawn to pork in various forms.  Kind of a craving.   <br/>
That doesn&#39;t change the fact that I prefer chicken to beef. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some people are this way with unschooling.  They just kinda are mostly  <br/>
unschoolers, but they do a math curriculum.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s fine with me.  I just want them to do it somewhere besides on  <br/>
this list!<br/>

I was like that.  I decided to stop eating meat 14 years ago after doing research in college about the food industry.  I was kind of proud to call myself a vegetarian.  Unschooling vegetarian single mom.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
<br/>
But there were times that money was really tight, really really tight.  Sometimes someone would fix Richard and I a meal, usually with meat.  I ate those meals thankfully and happily.  When my 90 year old grandmother invited us to her home in Illinois for a weekend, she made us meat.  I ate that thankfully and happily.  <br/>
<br/>
There were a few times on lists when I would write that I considered myself a vegetarian but that I ate meat when someone else cooked for me, and others would really jump on that.  I felt that they were really mean to me. &lt;g&gt;  One person wrote that even if I was going to someone&#39;s house for dinner, I could bring a dish so that Richard and I could still eat veggie.  She didn&#39;t get it &lt;G&gt;.  We were going to others houses because we couldn&#39;t, at the time, afford to make that dish!  <br/>
<br/>
I guess it was when reading one of the many discussions about not using labels that I realized that I was hanging on to that label.  I was a little surprised, I don&#39;t tend to like labels, but I was hanging on to a label about myself.  <br/>
<br/>
So, now I say I don&#39;t tend to eat meat.  Richard does eat meat, and that is ok.  He is very mindful about his food choices, much more than I am.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1766918658">-=-Um...no exactly the opposite. I&#39;m not trying to fit anyone into  <br/>
anything. I&#39;m saying...I don&#39;t care what people call themselves...it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t offend me.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That doesn&#39;t help anyone understand unschooling better.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Very off the mark. I am and have always a strong sense of self. I  <br/>
know who and what I am. Sometimes those things shift as I grow...but  <br/>
I&#39;m quite comfortable in my own skin. Labels or no labels. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If information wasn&#39;t wanted, it would have been better not to post.<br/>
If the responses weren&#39;t helpful, just leave them.<br/>
<br/>
I let this post through so I wouldn&#39;t return three in a row.  Please  <br/>
keep to what is useful for people reading about unschooling.<br/>
