<div id="ygrps-yiv-1078229031">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I read blog posts on a regular basis at two sites...since my family began our unschooling journey a few years ago, these (Sandra&#39;s and DaynaMartin&#39;s)remain at the top of my list of helpful places to learn and grow. I feel conflicted on a fairly regular basis regarding the differences in perspective I see. I tell myself to remain open and assimilate as much of the brilliance that I see...and i also wonder if any others have had experiences like this and can offer insight. Do I stick to the &quot;assimilate all&quot; philosophy...or do I somehow &quot;narrow it down&quot;...and if so, how does one go about doing this?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Neither! Make thoughtful choices based on your values and the goals  <br/>
you have for your family.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re trying to memorize &quot;right&quot; responses ;-) But the  <br/>
foundations -- the &quot;whys&quot; beneath them -- may be different. The goals  <br/>
-- where they&#39;re headed -- may be different.<br/>
<br/>
On this list the goals and foundations are living a learning filled  <br/>
life, growing great relationships, supporting a child&#39;s explorations,  <br/>
creating a peaceful home.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect there&#39;s some dissonance with what Dayna&#39;s writing so that&#39;s  <br/>
why it&#39;s not all meshing. For instance, what Sandra&#39;s saying may  <br/>
support relationships. What Dayna&#39;s saying may tear at relationships  <br/>
to support some other goal. (That&#39;s just a made up example since I  <br/>
don&#39;t read Dayna&#39;s blog.)<br/>
<br/>
People can meld philosophies to form their own philosophy, but it  <br/>
doesn&#39;t work to just pick the pieces you like from each. They won&#39;t  <br/>
necessarily work together. It&#39;d be like assuming all jigsaw puzzles  <br/>
are the same so if you mix two together and pick your favorite pieces,  <br/>
you&#39;ll be able to assemble a picture you really like.<br/>
<br/>
You need to start from scratch. Think about your goals, your values.  <br/>
And find what supports those, moves you toward them rather than away.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never heard of an &quot;assimilate all&quot; philosophy.  There&#39;s so much information in the world that no one could assimilate it all, and why try? <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a picture of a tool box that&#39;s come up today on a (very cool) blog called How to be a Retronaut, and while it&#39;s fascinating that so many tools were fitted into so small a space, it&#39;s also overwhelming.  <br/>

<br/>
Few people would need all those tools, and certainly not need them all at once.  The tool box and its arrangement are more art than practicality.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a display at the San Diego airport, of clocks, or clock-like art, at least.  Clock-esque. :-)  It first struck me as steampunk, and then as medieval, but it was art regardless.<br/>

<br/>
Unschoolers need some tools, but they don&#39;t need all the tools in the world, nor do they need all possible parenting tools in one moment.  It&#39;s about learning, and leaaning is gradually, because it builds on what one already knows.  <br/>
<br/>
No matter what one reads, all you can do is read a little and try it out and see if you can get it to work for you within your family.  And that doesn&#39;t happen in one second or one day.  It takes a while for you to even see how or whether it&#39;s working, and whether you can understand it and remember to apply it so that you can start to see differences.  That&#39;s what the wait a while and watch advice is about.<br/>

I&#39;ve been saying people should live a sparkly life  for most of the past twenty years.   One of the things I read yesterday during a presentation with Holly was written when she was two years old; she&#39;ll be twenty in November.<br/>

There are lots of unschooling voices to consider, but don&#39;t try to assimilate them all.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-701534049">I find too much information from too many sources is not always a good thing for where I am trying to be. So, I have chosen to stay with who has the most experience in unschooling and the grown children of that experience to boot. Sandra&#39;s various sources of information all feel right for me and my family. I never feel it necessary to veer off the path that her wisdom and years of experience bring to me. I am familiar with Dayna and her young children, but the same feeling about the information and insight as I have with Sandra, is not there for me with Dayna. Maybe another 10 or so years of experience and consistency will make Dayna&#39;s insight have more value for me.<br/>

And this is not just a thank you...I want other relative newcomers to know how much this list is transforming my life. I and my family are benefitting in profound ways from the knowledge we gain here.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-627582410">~~~Maybe another 10 or so years of experience and consistency will make Dayna&#39;s insight have more value for me.~~~<br/>
<br/>
I gained insight from Sandra, Joyce & Pam when their kids were relatively young! And there&#39;s a blogger writing now whose kids are, I think, 3 & 5, that really GETS radical unschooling principles and is able to write about them in a way that helps people understand them. For me, it&#39;s less about age of the kids and experience of the parent, and more about clarity of thought & writing, and what will help me (and others) support connection with my kids & natural learning best.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;m not overstepping anything here to say, my experience with Dayna&#39;s group & writing is that living by Law of Attraction principles trumps those things. That doesn&#39;t make it wrong! But it makes it different from my goals and values.<br/>
<br/>
On Dayna&#39;s list, advice that will move someone away from radical unschooling (as it&#39;s defined here, on Sandra&#39;s list) is rarely challenged and held up for discussion - the value of acceptance seems to be held higher than the value of clear dissection of thought. If that advice moves someone away from radical unschooling, then it&#39;s seen as, that&#39;s what that person attracted into their life, and it was for a reason, and the learning & experience the family gets from that detour or permanent exit was more valuable than radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
The information that the writing there is for living with Law of Attraction principles over unschooling principles isn&#39;t clearly stated there; it&#39;s all presented as radical unschooling, which is where some confusion happens. This is how I see it; perhaps others who&#39;ve read at both places would see it differently.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-79245535">It has appeared to me when having read Dayna (or seen her interviews on tv) that she does try to present herself as someone very well versed in unschooling. I have found this a little troubling in that it comes across as someone blowing their own horn for a variety of reasons, including, what has come across to some as self promoting (the un-nanny business she started). While I do feel there is enough opportunity in the universe for all of us to profit from in any number of ways, I was left feeling confused about the sincerity of Dayna&#39;s agenda and did not feel her information for myself was valuable enough to compromise feelings about it.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By &quot;assimilate&quot; do you actually mean &quot;to take on and incorporate as <br/>
one&#39;s own?&quot; There is a &quot;swallow it whole&quot; connotation there that isn&#39;t good.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you should read ANY of anybody&#39;s writing with the idea of <br/>
assimilating it. That smacks, to me, of reading someone else&#39;s ideas and <br/>
deciding to use their ideas in your life. &quot;THEIR&quot; ideas?<br/>
<br/>
I think you should read lots of people&#39;s ideas and then act on your own <br/>
ideas - the ideas you have that have been informed and influenced by <br/>
what you&#39;ve read, yes, but that you&#39;ve run through your OWN thoughtful, <br/>
critical, analytical, testing, examining, sensing brain that have <br/>
developed into your personal understanding and belief system.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that IS what you meant by &quot;assimilate&quot; but if you&#39;re trying to <br/>
adopt (take on as your own) ideas that seem contradictory, then, instead <br/>
of actually thinking for yourself, you&#39;re trying to take other people&#39;s <br/>
ideas and stick them in your head as if they were your own.<br/>
<br/>
Reading ideas from others that don&#39;t seem compatible with each other can <br/>
be useful in helping you build your OWN philosophical structure as you <br/>
examine both from the perspective of your own experience and subject <br/>
them to your own tests of logic and goodness. Apparent contradictions <br/>
and differing approaches can help you really zero in on what seems right <br/>
to you.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recommend reading one person and assimilating their ideas. <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site has a LOT of people on it so you can read lots of people&#39;s <br/>
ideas there, including mine, but I still recommend going outside that, <br/>
too, at least at first, to read ideas that Sandra wouldn&#39;t want on her <br/>
site. Part of knowing why you&#39;re choosing one direction is knowing, at <br/>
least to some limited degree, what lies in the other direction.<br/>
<br/>
After a while, your own philosophical structure and understanding will <br/>
be strong enough and clear enough that you might only read a few <br/>
people&#39;s writing because you&#39;ve figured out that that is where you get <br/>
the most help in carrying on in the direction that make sense to you in <br/>
the context of your own overarching philospohy/understanding of how life <br/>
and learning work.<br/>

<br/>
This specific point about Dayna&#39;s philosophy has been very clarifying for me...THAT is the difference: &quot;acceptance&quot; trumps &quot;clear dissection of thought&quot;. I also really appreciate your feedback around your interpretation of what Dayna does as possibly including other principles under the heading of &quot;radical unschooling&quot;. And finally, as I type this, I think that I am really appreciating being able to type this HERE:) I will put this in my back pocket as a memory of a good fit as I set out to &quot;frolic and splash&quot;!<br/>
