<div id="ygrps-yiv-246217982">I have e-mail from a mom in a country where homeschooling isn&#39;t  <br/>
legal.  I&#39;m going to change some details of the post to protect her  <br/>
identity and location, so first rule is not to ask personal questions,  <br/>
to respond to the information as presented.  If you&#39;re guessing the  <br/>
wrong country, that&#39;s no problem, because the archives of this list  <br/>
sit and will be helpful to someone who comes by.   &quot;Same old&quot; answers  <br/>
might not work as well here as they would in a place where one has  <br/>
support groups and can be out in the daytime.<br/>
<br/>
Separately, I&#39;ll post what I responded, but I hope some of you will  <br/>
respond without reading that or other responses, because when  <br/>
something is said separately by different people, it&#39;s very reinforcing.<br/>
<br/>
 From here to the bottom, then, is the post by a mom I will call Wendy  <br/>
(which is not her real name).  Wendy and her children Bob and John (my  <br/>
characters in the slightly edited version).<br/>
<br/>
===========================================<br/>
<br/>
[It started out saying the mom has found a way to make this work even  <br/>
though homeschooling isn&#39;t legal, and they&#39;ve been unschooling for two  <br/>
months.]<br/>
<br/>
I found a way to do it and I especially love what I read about the  <br/>
unschooling. But I need your help with something. My sons are [about  <br/>
9/10/11] and [three years older]  and they made very different school  <br/>
experiences. [Bob, the older one] made very bad ones and [John] I took  <br/>
out before he would make them..now, Bob likes to watch TV all day,  <br/>
John not really but he is not following his own way yet cause he  <br/>
thinks if Bob watches so much tv he should do this too or play pc games.<br/>
<br/>
  I am very new with unschooling and deschooling myself, as is Bob.   <br/>
John asks for learning not to get stupid, as he says.<br/>
<br/>
My problem at the moment is the difference in the kids&#39; needs.  <br/>
Probably its a question of having the trust, that John will find his  <br/>
own way, that I should just let him. And the other thing is the  <br/>
question, how much do I lead and offer, and when is it beginning to be  <br/>
too much? Me personally, I would love to just let them do what they  <br/>
want, and also just follow my own interests, but now my own interests  <br/>
seem to me egotistic to follow.<br/>
<br/>
I feel as if I would have to offer a lot here and there, drive them  <br/>
around and do things that might interest them. But I don&#39;t want to  <br/>
take that role; on the other hand I do, but I have no way yet.  It&#39;s  <br/>
all very confusing and sometimes all so natural.<br/>
<br/>
John today asked me, why I let them watch tv all day and play computer  <br/>
games and I couldn&#39;t really answer it. I said I want them to do what  <br/>
they like to do and then he asked me if they can do this everyday and  <br/>
I didn&#39;t know what to answer. I felt silly and confusing to John. How  <br/>
to explain something I just develop?<br/>
<br/>
I want them to see tv just as a normal option, so that it loses its  <br/>
big interest. But this is a rational thought and a plan and I don&#39;t  <br/>
feel right telling him that and even with this I don&#39;t know exactly  <br/>
why.  Just letting them seems so easy.<br/>
<br/>
Am I just acting egotistically, because this gives me also lots of  <br/>
free time, or do I really do this for them?<br/>
Why is it so difficult to just trust? And how is it possible, that two  <br/>
boys can sit in front of a tv and pc for 12 hours straight? Cause it  <br/>
was always restricted, okay. I want to change but I often don&#39;t know  <br/>
how to explain and how to combine all different interests, including  <br/>
mine. Sorry for my insecurity..<br/>
<br/>
What do I tell my boys? &quot;You know best what&#39;s good for you..&quot; doesn&#39;t  <br/>
sound right.  I read so much but don&#39;t have the right words yet..I  <br/>
hope you have the time to help me with your experience. Thanks for  <br/>
your great website. It&#39;s wonderful to read there.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506700351">My response to &quot;Wendy&quot;:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You should spend as much time with them as you would if you would if  <br/>
they were in school.  All the time you would have spent helping with  <br/>
homework, getting their clothes and supplies together, making their  <br/>
lunches, driving them--you should be spending that much time and more  <br/>
with them, helping them, bringing them food, SOMEthing.<br/>
<br/>
They do NOT &quot;know what&#39;s good for them.&quot;  You don&#39;t know either.  What  <br/>
you could come to know is that they are learning.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re not just sitting in front of a tv, unless it&#39;s turned off.<br/>
<br/>
Would you EVER write &quot;how is it possible that someone can sit and  <br/>
stare at a book for three hours straight?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to take this to Always Learning, but without your name, and  <br/>
I&#39;ll clean it up a bit and try to make it less obvious who it is.  If  <br/>
there is discussion, you probably shouldn&#39;t even respond.  There&#39;s no  <br/>
reason to say &quot;That was me.&quot;</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-115923172"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &quot;You know best what&#39;s good for you..&quot; doesn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; sound right.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems wrong to you and feels wrong to them because they&#39;re off  <br/>
balance right now because TV and computers were limited before.<br/>
<br/>
They know what they&#39;re off-balance selves need: more TV and computer.  <br/>
But it feels wrong because they may sense their balanced selves  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t need that much.<br/>
<br/>
If a big swimming pool has a tiny leak, you&#39;d only need to add a  <br/>
bucket of water to it each day. Adding a bucket each day would keep it  <br/>
balanced. If you don&#39;t add water to it each day, it will keep draining  <br/>
until it&#39;s empty. If you then added just a bucket a day, it wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
fill. If you only added 2 buckets a day, it would take months and  <br/>
months to fill. But if you turned the hose on and just let it run  <br/>
until the pool was filled, *then* you could add just a bucket a day.<br/>
<br/>
Right now they&#39;re in the let the hose run stage. But this won&#39;t last  <br/>
forever. They *will* eventually feel like they&#39;ve gotten to the full  <br/>
point where they just need as much as they need each day.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I want them to see tv just as a normal option, so that it loses its<br/>
&gt; big interest.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right now they can&#39;t see it as a normal option. Things you love that  <br/>
were very limited won&#39;t suddenly feel normal if there&#39;s a surplus. It  <br/>
takes a while to fill up, takes a while for the emotions to trust the  <br/>
head&#39;s knowledge. Just knowing that TV and computers are unlimited now  <br/>
isn&#39;t enough for the emotions to trust it. They need to experience it  <br/>
for months before the newness wears off and unlimited feels normal.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And the other thing is the<br/>
&gt; question, how much do I lead and offer, and when is it beginning to be<br/>
&gt; too much? Me personally, I would love to just let them do what they<br/>
&gt; want, and also just follow my own interests, but now my own interests<br/>
&gt; seem to me egotistic to follow.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t an easy answer to that because it depends on your and your  <br/>
kids&#39; personalities. You need to get to know them and their needs and  <br/>
let go of any voices that are telling you what kids-in-general need.  <br/>
You need to learn to listen to what they need.<br/>
<br/>
*But* what&#39;s especially confusing right now is your kids don&#39;t  <br/>
necessarily know what they need right now. They know what they were  <br/>
told they need. They know what other kids are told they need. They  <br/>
know they were told their own needs weren&#39;t as important as what  <br/>
adults wanted for them. So right now they&#39;re confused too.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s normal. Uncomfortable! but normal. Reassure them that they&#39;ll  <br/>
feel a bit off balance as their pools fill up. :-)<br/>
<br/>
What you can do is make sure the doors to other interesting  <br/>
opportunities are kept open. Make plans to get out of the house  <br/>
occasionally. Not to fix the kids but to shake up their days so they  <br/>
have different activities running through their lives. But right now  <br/>
the most important thing is the filling of their pools.<br/>

But don&#39;t expect right now to feel smooth. The days spent in school  <br/>
are like living with a broken leg. The days when unschooling runs  <br/>
smoothly are like living with two strong legs. But the deschooling  <br/>
phase between them is like living with a cast while the leg heals. It  <br/>
won&#39;t be as bad as school but won&#39;t be as smooth as unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1541380903">***My problem at the moment is the difference in the kids&#39; needs. <br/>
Probably its a question of having the trust, that John will find his <br/>

<br/>
It will happen at some point where you&#39;ll be able to follow your interests. <br/>
 What happened with me, is that my interests collided with my children and <br/>
meshed together.  One of my biggest interests IS my children and what they are <br/>
interested in.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a fairly long deschooling process for a 10 yr old.  Probably about half <br/>
a year.  The 3 yr old probably doesn&#39;t need to deschool.  If it were me, I&#39;d <br/>
leave the 10 yr old alone for a bit and do stuff with the younger one for now. <br/>
 Offer things up to the older one as you go along, but allow for it to be <br/>
optional.  He WILL start doing things again!  TV and PC games are fun and <br/>
engaging.  He wouldn&#39;t be doing that unless it was.  Part of what he&#39;s reacting <br/>
to, is the fact that it was controlled before and now it isn&#39;t.  He will want as <br/>
much as possible until he knows for sure that it won&#39;t get taken away.<br/>
<br/>
***I want them to see tv just as a normal option, so that it loses its <br/>
big interest. But this is a rational thought and a plan and I don&#39;t <br/>
feel right telling him that and even with this I don&#39;t know exactly <br/>
why. Just letting them seems so easy.***<br/>
<br/>
It might be better if the focus isn&#39;t on losing TV as a big interest.  Accept <br/>
that it is right now a big interest.  All kids have is right now.  It&#39;s possible <br/>
that TV will always be a big interest.  Some kids really like TV.  Some kids <br/>
grow up and become actors or producers or directors or animators or sound <br/>
technicians or advertisers.  Those are interesting fields to get into.  But, <br/>
that shouldn&#39;t be the focus either.  The focus is on right now.  He likes TV <br/>
right now and until that interest changes, engage him in what he likes right <br/>
now.  Offer more and different and better TV options, watch together, talk about <br/>
things, build things while you watch, find more games for the PC, offer more <br/>
options.  Eventually one thing leads to the next and in the ever expanding <br/>
world, he&#39;ll absorb more and learn more and connect more dots.  One day you&#39;ll <br/>
be out and about and he&#39;ll surprise you with something he knows that&#39;s really <br/>
cool and when you ask where he learned it, he&#39;ll tell you the show from TV that <br/>
he learned it from.<br/>
<br/>
***Am I just acting egotistically, because this gives me also lots of <br/>
free time, or do I really do this for them?<br/>
Why is it so difficult to just trust? And how is it possible, that two <br/>
boys can sit in front of a tv and pc for 12 hours straight?***<br/>
<br/>
Happy contented TV watching is great, but why they are watching is important <br/>
too.  If it&#39;s because there aren&#39;t any other options, then that&#39;s not a good <br/>
thing.  Watch with them.  Bring things into their space to do with them.  Go <br/>
places if you can.  If homeschooling or unschooling is illegal then you should <br/>
step it up at home and get out after school hours.  It doesn&#39;t need to look like <br/>
school or curriculum, but you should be able to see learning happening and be <br/>
able to describe it academically.<br/>
<br/>
The parents tend to need way more deschooling than the kids!<br/>
<br/>
***What do I tell my boys? &quot;You know best what&#39;s good for you..&quot; doesn&#39;t <br/>
sound right. ***<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t say anything like that.  I&#39;d spend more time with them and talk more <br/>
and be more engaged and through that find real talking points and real ideas to <br/>
play with.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-764868104">Ok. I&#39;m writing without reading any others answering you. The first thing<br/>
I&#39;d like to say is that tv and computer are fine for as many hours of the<br/>
day as one wants. Really. I personally don&#39;t think I could dream up a better<br/>
resource for homeschooling, although I&#39;m sure something else will eventually<br/>
come along that will blow those out of the water. Technological change is a<br/>
fascinating phenomenon in itself, and that includes telescopes which were a<br/>
window to the world and indeed other worlds beginning hundreds of years ago,<br/>
as well as microscopes and electron microscopes, applicable in so many<br/>
dozens if not hundreds of fields, then skip to photography within telescopy<br/>
and light spectrum studies with these through such amazing advances as the<br/>
Hubble telescope. The internet and tv are highly social and personal devices<br/>
which end users can learn about one or many things in multiple contexts.<br/>
<br/>
Getting rid of or downplaying the internet/tv is paramount to getting rid of<br/>
books, or surgery, or botany. Any technical advantage raises the level of<br/>
information exponentially and widens the field of inquiry possible. Why<br/>
would one want to go back in time or pretend there&#39;s no good use of these<br/>
things? It doesn&#39;t make sense to me.<br/>
<br/>
Emotionally and culturally there is almost always a sense of ruining what we<br/>
have by discovering new things. But it isn&#39;t actually desirable to go back<br/>
to the time before fire was discovered, is it? Or art? Or medicine?<br/>
<br/>
The second thing I&#39;d like to say is to let all your interests and those of<br/>
your children serve as inspiration for strewing new materials and ideas and<br/>
objects, like seasoning on the &quot;food&quot; for thought that you and your children<br/>
want to be into.<br/>
<br/>
Especially if you&#39;re not able to go out much. I have that too. I&#39;m in a<br/>
one-car situation where the dad drives to work everyday and we&#39;re without<br/>
transportation most of the day. Make home as interesting as you feasibly<br/>
can. I&#39;m about to borrow a microscope for Karl to do things with because I&#39;d<br/>
love to expand his world as much as I can and he&#39;s definitely interested in<br/>
looking at things closer up, hence my comments above about microscopes. We<br/>
just cut the huge field around our house and there are things we could make<br/>
slides of to look at. Also my uncle who was into astronomy and photography<br/>
of things astronomical recently died and I am thinking about asking to<br/>
borrow one of his telescopes maybe. I am excited for my own chance to dive<br/>
into these things. The winter skies are clearer around here and I might get<br/>
a lot of fun out of that. Karl can dive in as much as he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
Right now, Karl has discovered all kinds of games on youtube by surfing<br/>
walkthroughs, which he has been doing on a daily basis for months now. He<br/>
has a new game interest or discovery every other day. He wants to make his<br/>
own walkthroughs and when I get the money I&#39;ll get him the equipment to do<br/>
that with. Should be fun.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1095914474">We have a similar dynamic with the TV here.  Eli (9) really like to watch and <br/>
Samuel (7) tends to watch because Eli is.  The TV is in the living room so Eli <br/>
does not have to be alone to watch.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have begun to gently insist that we do something together every day.  Normally <br/>
it just happens, but if it does not I&#39;ll push it.  Right now the options are <br/>
normally something like:  Build the K&#39;nex model they are working on, playing a <br/>
video/board/card game we all like, reading a few chapters of a book we are <br/>
reading aloud, watching something we can all enjoy, taking a walk, etc.  Often <br/>
once we start something else they don&#39;t turn the TV back on so quickly, and when <br/>
occasionally they do, I know they are choosing it because they want to, not just <br/>
because it is there.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In our house, anything to break the rut of watching, even for a few minutes <br/>
often leads to new ideas.  Sometimes it is as simple as pausing the show to <br/>
check something said that sparks a discussion.  If you can find a way to pursue <br/>
your own interest in the same space they are in, connections seem to happen all <br/>
the time.<br/>

But you could be preventing the acquisition and the spark of new idea  <br/>
by &quot;breaking the rut.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When you refer to watching television as a rut that needs to be  <br/>
broken, you say more than you meant to.<br/>
You might have said more than you knew you were thinking.<br/>

If they were reading books, would you be relieved that something  <br/>

If he wants to know why, you can talk about how the way schools teach interferes with learning ¡V not a lot, just say that they do. In order for him to learn without school, he needs a break from schoolish stuff. <br/>
<br/>
Ray was nervous about unschooling when he came home at 13. He was nervous that if I didn¡¦t tell him what to learn, there must be some secret agenda (his bio mom has lots of secret agendas, so he had good reason to worry!).

 </span></blockquote>Depending on what you mean, offering and taking kids places and doing things with them is a big, important part of unschooling. Its easy to fall into a rut where kids (like adults) do things more on auto-pilot than because its what they really want to be doing. They¡¦ll need your help keeping their world big and fresh and open¡K eventually. Right now though, they need time to deschool so the help they need is different. They need you to hang out with them and offer plenty of love and care. Make fun snacks, offer fun movies, offer to learn to play a video game so you can play two-player games¡K whatever sorts of fun they like. Think of fun out-of-the-house things, too ¡V what might you do on vacation? What would be fun?<br/>
<br/>
Eventually that kind of thinking and planning will be part of your unschooling life, but more often it will be in response to what your kids enjoy already. Right now, their ability to enjoy life is a bit hampered, so it will be up to you to be gentle and kind and offer light-hearted fun that doesn¡¦t look anything like a ¡§learning experience¡¨.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Am I just acting egotistically, because this gives me also lots of  <br/>
&gt; free time, or do I really do this for them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That¡¦s a really important question to ask yourself! Unschooling isn¡¦t necessarily easier or more laid-back. Teens, especially, often want to get out and do things, so expecting unschooling to give you a lot of free time can set you up for a lot of frustration. <br/>
<br/>
«	Why is it so difficult to just trust<br/>
<br/>
How much were you trusted as a child? How much do you trust yourself now? Some of that is going to come into play ¡V that¡¦s why parents need to deschool too, often More than kids, we have decades more baggage saying ¡§you can¡¦t, you¡¦re not (qualified, old enough, ready, smart enough, rich enough, whatever)¡¨.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; And how is it possible, that two  <br/>
&gt; boys can sit in front of a tv and pc for 12 hours straight? Cause it  <br/>
&gt; was always restricted, okay.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And because they need time to relax and decompress. School puts a lot of pressure on kids! They need time to heal from all that pressure. <br/>
<br/>
Plus, you wrote that it has only been two months ¡V so they don¡¦t yet have any reason to trust that this will last. That¡¦s part of why people binge on something that has been limited ¡V you never know when you¡¦ll get it again, so get all you can Now. Heck, I do that with seasonal fruits and veggies to some extent! Once they have a sense that the tv will always be there (and they get caught up on all their favorite shows) the watching will grow less and they¡¦ll become more discriminating, too. <br/>
<br/>
For now, sit with them at least part of the day. If any of your interests can be accomplished in the same room, find a way to do that. See what they find interesting and what they¡¦re watching just because they can ¡V you don¡¦t have to say anything about that, just notice, so you can start to get a sense of what they enjoy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136539363">hi,<br/>
just wanted to ask a question related to this bit.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It doesn&#39;t need to look like school or curriculum, but you should be able to see learning happening and be able to describe it academically.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
my daughter is nearly 10 and has got into sims in a big way. she plays a lot and i create families with her sometimes when she asks and join in making houses and playing in them.  but how do i describe her huge interest in this game in academic terms to the LEA inspector who is coming to our house.  i do a lot with the children outside of the house which i can justify in academic terms, but if the inspector asks about what my daughter is doing in the house, this game is her main activity and i need to explain it.<br/>
<br/>
thanks for any ideas<br/>
blessings<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-832059293">I played SIMS a looooong time ago, so I checked online for a description of the newer version. Here is something I found:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/the-sims-game">http://www.answers.com/topic/the-sims-game</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very complex game!<br/>
<br/>
Here is part of that description:<br/>
&quot;You&#39;ll guide your Sims in life-development phases such as having children, feeding hungers, basic survival needs, hygiene, comfort, energy levels, fun, social interaction (e.g., dancing, affairs, marriage), body-building, cooking, skill development, and even bladder control. Chemistry between your Sims is a product of your manipulations as well -- slippery, smooth, introverted, extroverted, positive, and negative thinkers -- all form the level and style of interaction through conversations with other Sims.<br/>
<br/>
The Sims has a range of ten career tracks for your breadwinners to follow and each career advancement requires specific skills for success. For example, a minimum-wage mailroom clerk must have Body, Charisma, and Repair Skills while a person in the medical field must have Logic to go along with Repair skills. There are ten levels of positions within each of the ten career tracks -- your Sims can work their way up in career fields such as entertainment, law enforcement, crime, medical, military, politics, athletics, science, or extreme (daredevil).&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In these two paragraphs, I&#39;ve already found lots of things I could use to describe it in terms an inspector would like:<br/>
<br/>
Strategy (that&#39;s a big one, this game is all about strategy)<br/>
Math<br/>
Basic psychology<br/>
Building organizational skills<br/>
Exploring career tracks<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Video games are amazing learning tools, in my opinion!<br/>

Sims is a huge multi-task game.  You need to keep track of everyone and <br/>
everything going on in the game.  It&#39;s hugely about social interactions, cause <br/>
and effect, fashion, architecture, design, strategy, family relations, working <br/>
within a system, keeping track of time and bodily functions, and learning cheats <br/>
around things.  It&#39;s also very interesting to compare new and old versions, <br/>
extension packs, and ways things have improved or changed to make things work <br/>
better.  The newest version, I heard, lets you angle things, which is super <br/>
awesome.  In real life one can put a chair in a corner with tables on either <br/>
side and STILL be able to use it.  There is a brilliant video, horror spoof, on <br/>
college humor...   <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1922223">http://www.collegehumor.com/video:1922223</a> <br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter spent a LOT of time finding ways to kill her sims.  It&#39;s <br/>
morbid, but it was fascinating.  The easiest and quickest way is to put them in <br/>
a swimming pool and take out the ladder.  I thought that was interesting.<br/>
