<div id="ygrps-yiv-1749718749">Yesterday was interesting, cool, and sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Julian (14) and I were doing some cleaning in the Library, where we&#39;d piled <br/>
lots of stuff. I was going through a box and came across his &quot;School Days&quot; <br/>
book, from when he spent time in school through the third grade.<br/>
<br/>
We looked through it together. There were his report cards, some examples of <br/>
&quot;work&quot;, his school pictures, his first baby tooth, a letter to Santa, and his <br/>
birthday party invitations. His first few years at school were not <br/>
particularly scathing, actually. The teachers liked him a lot, although they mentioned <br/>
his handwriting (which is still awful) and his lack of participation in class, <br/>
except for when they were doing arctic and carribean animals (&quot;Yeah, you&#39;re <br/>
finally doing something that interests him!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
His first few years mentioned that math was his strongest subject, and the <br/>
second grade teacher mentioned that he was great at creative writing! <br/>
<br/>
The third grade teacher wanted to refer him to special ed because of his <br/>
handwriting, his lack of participation in class, and that he wasn&#39;t memorizing his <br/>
times tables. He came out of the third grade with little confidence, <br/>
especially in math and writing.<br/>
<br/>
I said that I wish I could run into her. Julian laughed and said, &quot;With your <br/>
car?&quot;  I said no, but that I would tell her how much she had hurt Julian, but <br/>
that I was also grateful in one way, because third grade finally convinced his <br/>
other two parents that we should pull him out of school.<br/>
<br/>
Then, last evening, we attended a candlelight vigil in support of equal ma<br/>
rriage rights for gay folks. I was a speaker, and Julian spoke too. We live in <br/>
Massachusetts, and my partner, Beth, and I are planning to get married <br/>
(legally!) on June 5th. <br/>
<br/>
Julian was sweet and eloquent, speaking in front of lots of people. He said, <br/>
&quot;I hope the legislature understands that, even if my family looks different <br/>
from other families, that we&#39;re still a family and deserve civil rights. I hope <br/>
that they won&#39;t write discrimination into our constitution.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, a man came up to him and asked if it was hard to talk about being <br/>
gay with his friends. Julian explained that he is not gay, and the man <br/>
started apologizing profusely. Julian said it wasn&#39;t a big deal, that he didn&#39;t <br/>
consider it an insult. It reminded me of when he was little and people thought he <br/>
was a girl. They&#39;d get all flustered, but he didn&#39;t think that was an insult <br/>
either.<br/>
<br/>
This kid is so cool. I&#39;m so lucky to get to hang out with him.<br/>

<br/>
He sounds so cool!  It&#39;s tons of fun to get to hang with them, isn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I said that I wish I could run into her. Julian laughed and said, &quot;With your car?&quot;  I said no, but that I would tell her how much she had hurt Julian, but that I was also grateful in one way, because third grade finally convinced his other two parents that we should pull him out of school.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I had a previous teacher encounter a couple weeks ago.  I was at Toys R Us with my two youngest and at the cash we ran into my eldest son&#39;s 3rd grade teacher.  I must say that she was the one great teacher we ran across (he left midway through grade 4).  She was on maternity leave with 2 young kids in tow.  She asked after Joseph and I said he was doing great.  She was happy to hear that; then I added, &quot;we&#39;re homeschooling, not sure if you knew&quot;.  She didn&#39;t, and quickly followed that up with &quot;How does that work?  You have the curriculum?&quot;  I explained the provincial curriculum is available online but you don&#39;t need to follow it, just tell them you&#39;re homeschooling and that&#39;s that.  I could just see the wheels turning as she plopped her purchases on the counter ... likely imagining how she&#39;d feel when her kids got one of the many other teachers that don&#39;t care about the students as much as she does.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t know what I&#39;d say if I ran across his 4th grade teacher however!  Hopefully along the lines of what you suggested ... or maybe I&#39;d lose my nerve and just gush about what an amazing kid he is and how happy we are to have him home with us.  Which he is and we are!  &lt;g&gt;<br/>

HEY!  They showed that on the news this morning, a view from the air (window <br/>
maybe or helicopter?)<br/>
I thought you might have been there, but didn&#39;t know you&#39;d be a speaker!<br/>

In some disturbing news, I recently heard about a<br/>
local teacher who has been fired (legally!) apparently<br/>
due to her sexual orientation.  <br/>

As much as I&#39;d like to be famous like that, you probably saw one from Boston. <br/>
We were in Salem, and there were about 100 people there.<br/>

Well from this distance, they&#39;re the same. &lt;g&gt;</div>
