<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083956787">Lydia, my daughter, has decided to give 6th grade a try this year. <br/>
She&#39;s been going back and forth for a few years now and this year<br/>
she&#39;s decided to do it. To find out for herself what this school world<br/>
it like and meet some more kids her age.  So far, it&#39;s been ok.  She<br/>
finds the work boring and pointless but she likes lunch and taking the<br/>
bus home.  She&#39;s noticed her handwriting quickness and neatness aren&#39;t<br/>
up to par (but we&#39;ve discussed that it&#39;ll improve as she does it more)<br/>
but her typing skills are way ahead  :-)  .  So far the monotony of it<br/>
all is worth the social stuff to her.<br/>
<br/>
She took a timed math facts test on Friday (addition, subtraction,<br/>
multiplication and division) and was pretty discouraged.  The kids<br/>
sitting next to her flew through it and she turned in a blank division<br/>
paper.  She&#39;d never done bracket division.  She practiced this weekend<br/>
and I emailed her teacher and told her Lydia was worried that the<br/>
teacher would think she was being difficult by turning in a blank<br/>
paper.  The teacher emailed me back and said that Lydia shouldn&#39;t<br/>
worry, that she thinks Lydia is a sweetie and she&#39;ll have no trouble<br/>
catching up.<br/>
<br/>
Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Since then Lydia has felt the she&#39;s pretty average in the class and<br/>
feels she&#39;s catching on easily.  She mostly gets discouraged with the<br/>
homework and the point of actually having to do some of the boring<br/>
stuff they do.<br/>
<br/>
Then today the dean of students calls me and ask me if I have any<br/>
testing from Lydia&#39;s homeschooling days.  I say no, I had been her  <br/>
supervising teacher and the state doesn&#39;t require testing then(the<br/>
requirement in IA is either working with a licensed teacher or<br/>
testing).  She then says she would like to test Lydia because her<br/>
teachers have some concerns.  Apparently she wasn&#39;t &quot;even able&quot; to<br/>
find the US on a world map.  I have no idea how they asked her this<br/>
question cause I know she knows where the US is. We have a globe we<br/>
refer to in our living room quite often and also a US map in the hall<br/>
near her room with stars on it of all the places we travel to and a<br/>
world map in the basement where the kids hang.  I do know that they&#39;ve<br/>
sent homework home with totally distorted (photocopied) maps w/out<br/>
borders (like borders of states and countries) on them and the kids<br/>
are supposed to figure out what goes where.    We got a map of a<br/>
themepark we were at a couple weeks ago and she was able to find the<br/>
rides she wanted to ride just fine... ;-) :-D !<br/>
<br/>
Then the dean tells me they would like to do a baseline test on Lydia.<br/>
 Honestly, I&#39;ve got pretty negative views of testing and think they<br/>
are a horrible way to assess children.  So, I said no, I prefer you<br/>
don&#39;t test her.  I prefer you judge her by the work she does in school.<br/>
<br/>
So, my question to you.  (sorry this is getting so long)  Do I ask<br/>
Lydia if she wants to do this test?  AND do I even tell Lydia that the<br/>
dean called me with these concerns?  If I do, she&#39;ll be bummed and<br/>
think less of herself.  I don&#39;t want that.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday before school Lydia was saying she wants to quit.  I don&#39;t<br/>
know how long this school experience will go on.  I wouldn&#39;t be<br/>
surprised either way (staying or leaving), she is enjoying being<br/>
around all those kids.  Lydia is a hardworking, organized, highly<br/>
motivated girl.  I have NO worries that she&#39;ll be able to do whatever<br/>
she sets her mind to.  Those personality traits will be much more<br/>
beneficial to her than writing neat or being able to multiply and<br/>
divide quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, I know this really isn&#39;t an unschooling question but I<br/>
would really like your opinions on this.  Part of me is probably just<br/>
feeling defensive of our lifestyle choices and I don&#39;t want that to<br/>
interfere with my handling of these situations.<br/>
<br/>
I should also say that I wrote one of her teachers (the one the dean<br/>
mentioned) and he emailed me back.  He didn&#39;t mention any concerns he<br/>
had to me (which is what I asked) just said she is delightful and he<br/>
is trying to get to know her better.  <br/>
<br/>
This is part of what I wrote to him:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Lydia has not had a traditional approach to learning.  She is a very<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; intelligent, hard working, bright, sweet girl who has chosen to go to<br/>
&gt; school herself.  I would have preferred she stayed home and learned<br/>
&gt; through real life experiences and by following her interest and<br/>
&gt; passions.  But this is something she wants to try/do and I want to be<br/>
&gt; supportive and helpful in any way that I can for her.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>He thanked me for the background.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any advice.<br/>

<br/>
Very cool.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could say that if the teachers&#39; concerns have to do with  <br/>
&quot;good grades,&quot; that you aren&#39;t worried about that.  You could just  <br/>
say that Lydia&#39;s there to learn, not to compete.  (You wouldn&#39;t have  <br/>
to say &quot;to learn about cafeteria lunches and the schoolbus.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Apparently she wasn&#39;t &quot;even able&quot; to find the US on a world map. I  <br/>
have no idea how they asked her this question cause I know she knows  <br/>
where the US is.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The word (the panicked thing &quot;they&quot; say) is that a large percentage  <br/>
of U.S.  high school graduates can&#39;t find things on the map.  Maybe  <br/>
quiz the dean of students.  Show him a word map and ask him really  <br/>
quickly to show you Somalia or Finland and see how calm he is.  I  <br/>
don&#39;t know...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could tell them that as far as you&#39;re concerned you&#39;d  <br/>
rather have her home, but she&#39;s there because she wants to be there,  <br/>
and you don&#39;t want them doing ANY damage to her.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do know that they&#39;ve<br/>
<br/>

borders (like borders of states and countries) on them and the kids<br/>

<br/>
Maybe you could take one of those in and point at the outside edges  <br/>
and say &quot;What&#39;s there?&quot;  or &quot;Is this water?  Space?&quot;  (I&#39;m  <br/>
fantasizing; sorry. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>

Judge her in what way, though?  Are they thinking of &quot;holding her  <br/>
back&quot; or something?<br/>

for a minute (remedial funding).  But Lydia told me yesterday that <br/>
there were kids in her class that didn&#39;t do as well as she did in <br/>
math and she was pretty much in the middle.  <br/>
<br/>
I asked her teacher what his &quot;concerns&quot; were and he didn&#39;t give me an <br/>
answer.  I personally just think they put a lot of stock in what <br/>
these test say and want to see what she does and doesn&#39;t know so they <br/>
can take credit for her leaps and bounds this year!  She will have <br/>
learned so much....(barf!)!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, I need to hear these unschooling perspetives. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089011450">Given her reaction to the math test and to school in general, I would<br/>
guess that even finding out that her principal wanted her to take a<br/>
test like that would cause her anxiety and negative feelings.  My<br/>
inclination would be to say no to the principal and not mention it to<br/>
your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
I would want the teacher to talk to me directly, and it sounds as<br/>
though that is what is happening (yay!).  It could be that there are<br/>
some simple things that the other students have been exposed to (like<br/>
bracket division) and that going over with them at home might make<br/>
things at school more comfortable for her.  Easy enough to do :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-244409169">Part of me thinks you should protect your daughter as much as possible <br/>
while she is in school, but another part thinks she should understand <br/>
everything that school is about, crap and all. Testing is HUGE here.  <br/>
It&#39;s all about $$$.  They probably want to know where she needs the <br/>
most help, so they can work on that, so she won&#39;t screw up test scores <br/>
for them.  Who knows though.  It might just be some anti homeschooler <br/>
who wants to prove to others just how little she has learned while <br/>
homeschooling.<br/>
My daughter went to school in 9th grade.  I felt she was ready <br/>
emotionally to handle all the crap that comes and make choices <br/>
accordingly.  She was, and I had very little involvement with the <br/>
school.<br/>
I&#39;m very glad she didn&#39;t show any sign of wanting school til then.  I <br/>
know it would have been much more challenging for both of us had she <br/>
gone any earlier.<br/>
You might want to talk to her about staying just long enough to make <br/>
some good friends, then make a lot of effort to get them together.  <br/>
