&lt;&lt; Most of the ones I would say have already been suggested, but I haven&#39;t <br/>
noticed Camelot yet.  My 6 yro and 4 yro loved the Richard Harris musical. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some kids who might otherwise have bypassed it, too, might find greater <br/>
interest because of his having played Dumbledore.<br/>
<br/>
Henry V (without even being a musical!) got another pass here after the <br/>
second Harry Potter movie was out, so they could see Kenneth Brannagh, and there&#39;s <br/>
Bilbo, being Flewellyn (Ian Holm).<br/>
<br/>
Brian Blessed&#39;s in it too, who&#39;s also in Man of La Mancha, and some of the <br/>
Black Adder episodes.<br/>
<br/>
Robbie Coltrane&#39;s there, who&#39;s Hagrid, and also the Ghost (combo ghosts) on <br/>
Black Adder&#39;s Christmas Carol.<br/>
<br/>
Those were pretty good connect-the-dots bits for my kids!</div>
