<div id="ygrps-yiv-102090176">Is anyone coming down to the conference from New England that would <br/>
be willing to share a ride? I am looking for a ride for myself and <br/>
my 13-yo daughter. I would share the gas and the driving. <br/>
<br/>
Also, I am looking to room share with someone. I did not reserve a <br/>
room because I did not think we would be able to come but my <br/>
situation changed and now we can go. <br/>
