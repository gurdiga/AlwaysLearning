<div id="ygrps-yiv-807870453">An artist on Fiverr took my lettering and made a coloring page. <br/>

There’s a bit more info, and a direct link to a large file, in case you might want to print it, or import it to a computer-coloring place. :-)<br/>
<br/>
While you’re at that link, if you don’t know much about Learn Nothing Day please look at the archives for more art, fun reports of attempts at learning nothing, and more art.  July 24, 2016 will be the 9th Learn Nothing Day.<br/>
