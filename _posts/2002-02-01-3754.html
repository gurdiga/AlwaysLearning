years old. It won&#39;t have much impact - since 99 percent of people already <br/>
think the law says they have to send their kids to kindergarten when they&#39;re <br/>
five.<br/>

I have my full name and my phone number listed on the California website <br/>
(www.hsc.org). And I get phone calls regularly from people considering <br/>
homeschooling. I&#39;ve never once had ANY problem - my name and number have been <br/>
up there for years.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Well are you?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My screen name is LouisaM, a reference to Louisa May Alcott.  When I<br/>
first started using the internet I was told to NEVER give out your real<br/>
name so I used a screen name.  I always sign my posts with my real name,<br/>
Kris.<br/>
<br/>
I still use the screen name because those who know me via the internet<br/>
know me by that.  I want to be accountable and easily recognized all<br/>
times so I&#39;ve never changed it.  I used to be paranoid about this kind of<br/>
thing but time and seratonin boosters have healed that.<br/>
