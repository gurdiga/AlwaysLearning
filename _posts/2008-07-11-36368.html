<div id="ygrps-yiv-1220758549">Today my kids, ages 12 & 7, came to me and said they&#39;d like to sell <br/>
their Nintendo DS units and games that go with, to raise money to buy <br/>
other toys.  I&#39;ve not given my okay yet -- dh is really reluctant to <br/>
let them sell toys he feels they&#39;ll likely miss very soon.<br/>
<br/>
Some history on these games.  We gave them each a new DS January 07, <br/>
and they were thrilled. Played them virtually all the time.  Andy <br/>
(12yo) wore his out.  In January 08, our home was broken into, all <br/>
the electronics were stolen, including the DS and games, one of our <br/>
computers (we interrupted them, and the left one puter behind as they <br/>
fled), our DVD player, digital camera, etc.  By the time we&#39;d dug up <br/>
the info for the insurance company (which always pays so little <br/>
anyway), it was mid April before we replaced their DSs.  Within days, <br/>
Dan -- who had considered a guitar instead, but chose the DS, had <br/>
regrets almost immediately.  He often misplaces his DS for days, and <br/>
tho he has several games he doesn&#39;t play it all that often.  Andy <br/>
really enjoyed his DS, tho recently he plays with it less. He often <br/>
only owns one game, preferring to spend his allowance on other <br/>
things. <br/>
<br/>
I say all this to explain that I can see they aren&#39;t all that <br/>
attached to their DS, but I do find having those makes a convenient <br/>
distraction on road trips.  We&#39;re taking a family trip over Labor Day <br/>
to San Francisco, so about 18 hrs in the car each way.  Time to fill <br/>
without DS games - which has dh concerned it will be a l-o-o-n-g road <br/>
trip, with seriously bored, restless children.<br/>
<br/>
Two weeks ago, we got a PS2 -- the boys choice for their part of the <br/>
stimulus check -- and 4 games.  The boys love it, and have spent <br/>
hours each day playing their games on it.  They&#39;ve decided that&#39;s <br/>
enough for them, and they&#39;d rather trade their DS for other toy <br/>
purchases.  Dan still would like an electric guitar.<br/>
<br/>
My concerns are ..... the novelty of the PS-2 will wane, and they&#39;ll <br/>
wish the still had DS games; they won&#39;t get much money for their DS <br/>
stuff, will spend it away on smaller toys of fleeting value to them, <br/>
and when they realize they&#39;d like DS again, they&#39;ll need to save up <br/>
their allowances to buy new, because our budget simply won&#39;t cover <br/>
new DS for each boy.  <br/>
<br/>
They&#39;ve often traded games and smaller things, sold toys to friends, <br/>
etc to raise smaller bits of money and seldom regret it, but this <br/>
seems like a big deal to me. <br/>
<br/>
Our policy has always been that once we give them an item, it&#39;s <br/>
theirs to do with as they wish.  Any past &#39;sell-offs&#39; have always <br/>
been smaller toys, not big things, which made it easier to hold to.  <br/>
<br/>
I really want to trust their judgment and choice in this, but I don&#39;t <br/>
want them to seriously regret their choice? <br/>
<br/>
Anyone have experience with this?  Suggestions for how to respond?  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re off to Gamestop to see what they could get for their DS items --<br/>
 just recon, no one is going to sell anything today.  Dh really wants <br/>
them to wait a week or two to be sure they really want this <br/>
before &#39;allowing&#39; them to sell their own stuff.  I find myself <br/>
defending their right to make their own choices, but want to protect <br/>
them from the risks -- not to mention I don&#39;t want to hear dh later <br/>
point out that we shouldn&#39;t have let them do this if they have <br/>
regrets.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82953977">Well - here&#39;s one idea! I&#39;ve DONE this, by the way (not with DSs, but  <br/>
with other things).<br/>
<br/>
Figure out how much they can get for them, give them that money (since  <br/>
you said it probably won&#39;t be that much - I&#39;m sure not nearly what the  <br/>
cost new). Tell them that &quot;YOU&quot; really want to have those DSs around  <br/>
for road trips, so you&#39;re willing to give them the money that they&#39;d  <br/>
get if they sold them elsewhere. This seems fair, since it is YOUR  <br/>
decision, not theirs. I think it would be really nice of you to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have a stash of stuff that is for road trips? We have some  <br/>
games and coloring books and other stuff that is stashed away (with  <br/>
other travel stuff like earplugs, splitters for ipods, little zip bags  <br/>
that I use to hold different things when we travel, travel sized  <br/>
soaps, shampoos, little pillows/blankets, luggage tags, flashlights,  <br/>
and other stuff like that. Maybe you could say that you want to buy  <br/>
them for your travel stash and you could really put them in there. If  <br/>
they do decide they want them, you can be generous and say, &quot;Sure, go  <br/>
get it out of the travel stash.&quot; If that does happen, they&#39;ll realize  <br/>
it and be grateful that you bought them and they&#39;ll learn to be a  <br/>
little less quick to want to get rid of stuff. If it never happens,  <br/>
you&#39;ll have them for trips and they&#39;ll be more special since they  <br/>
won&#39;t be playing with them in between. Win-Win! If you don&#39;t already  <br/>
have a travel stash, this could be a good time to put that kind of  <br/>
stuff together.<br/>

for his DS and associated games.  Andy could only get about $52 (his <br/>

<br/>
There is no way I can &#39;buy&#39; their games from them for those prices.  <br/>

<br/>
yeah, it feels unfair to say &#39;we don&#39;t want you to sell your games&#39; <br/>
but I&#39;m pretty sure Andy will regret selling his game almost <br/>
instantly if he does.  While we were in gamestop, another customer <br/>
offered that he&#39;d pay us more for a used DS than gamestop was <br/>
offering. Still a deal for him, since GS gets 110 for a used DS <br/>
(they&#39;re only $130 new), and offered us only $50. It certainly would <br/>
have been a win-win for us and the buyer.  BUT, I&#39;d told dh today <br/>
would only be recon, no selling allowed.  I&#39;d have to deal with his <br/>
unhappiness.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s part of it, too.  Dh works hard for the money we spend.  I <br/>
don&#39;t work at all, and we do give the boys as generous an allowance <br/>
as we can afford.  Two months ago, we spent $325 on new DS and two <br/>
games for each boy. Now, Andy would be happy to sell his for $50 to <br/>
buy a bunch of $5 toys he&#39;s currently collecting (Bakugan balls).  <br/>
Once he bought those, they&#39;d have no resale value and, based on past <br/>
experience, in something less than 2 weeks, he&#39;ll have moved on to <br/>
the next must have collectible toy.  And he will very likely regret <br/>
selling his DS.  For dh to see &#39;his&#39; money so quickly parlayed <br/>
into &#39;junk&#39; toys at less than half the value of what he spend it <br/>
frustrating.  <br/>
<br/>
My feelings are mixed, too.  While I think it&#39;s responsible and <br/>
admirable to recognize you&#39;re done with something, resell it and buy <br/>
something you like better, there&#39;s a part of me that feels like re-<br/>
selling stuff to buy more stuff screams of desperation and poverty.  <br/>
I know that&#39;s my own money issues talking. I&#39;d love to be able to buy <br/>
them as many video games and toys as they want, but that&#39;s just not <br/>
possible.  Seeing them go over their toys, see which they think they <br/>
can do without, just to raise more money to have toys everyone else <br/>
can afford, pushes all my &#39;lack&#39; buttons.<br/>
<br/>
Andy really wishes I&#39;d let him sell his game to the customer at <br/>
Gamestop.  I almost wish I had, too.  <br/>

that and get the full amount.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of that -- since that&#39;s so final -- what if they sell one or  <br/>
more of their games on Amazon? My daughter has done that and they&#39;ve  <br/>
sold quickly at good prices. Or maybe they have other things around.  <br/>
Books they&#39;re not going to read anymore. (Though the games go quickest.)<br/>
<br/>
(If you need help selling, I can walk you through it, but they  <br/>
already make it incredibly easy. Just go to the page and click on the  <br/>
&quot;Sell Yours Here&quot; button.)<br/>

*****<br/>
If I could afford to buy him $50 worth of new toys, I wouldn&#39;t need to ask this question.  We can&#39;t afford every toy they want. <br/>
 <br/>
At the end of it all, Dan did sell his DS and games for the $93.60 Gamestop offered him.  Almost didn&#39;t happen because the game was lacking its serial number sticker (fell off).  He has his money and is happily shopping on ebay for a guitar.<br/>
 <br/>
Andy ultimately chose to keep his DS, traded in the game he doesn&#39;t enjoy, and some credit on the Gamestop members card, plus a small subsidy from me and ended up with a game he likes, but is not entirely happy with.  Not an uncommon problem with Andy and video games, so no surprise there. <br/>
 <br/>
This was only reached after a long phone conversation with dh about the fairness issue of not allowing them to re-sell gifts we gave them, not wanting them to resent things they&#39;d once loved and now were forced to keep to appease us.  Really, tho, his biggest concern is that he&#39;s watched Andy suffer buyer&#39;s remorse too many times to be entirely comfortable with the idea of Andy selling one formerly beloved toy for what&#39;s likely a passing fancy. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2072236385">I didn&#39;t mean to offend by pointing out that we can&#39;t afford all the toys they ask for.  <br/>
 <br/>
With or without more funds, I can see where the question of &#39;letting&#39; kids sell toys is a bigger question than how much money we have. <br/>
 <br/>
We did buy Dan the desired electric guitar this morning, with an additional $40 from the regular budget, while Andy is still considering his options, feeling he&#39;s not ready just yet to part with his DS.  <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, I realize musical instruments are considered an educational expense for kids in school.  We bought our oldest a drum set when he was in school, tho he was 13, not 7.  Dh felt 7 is a little young for the expense of an electric guitar kit ($130).  His concern is that it won&#39;t be a good fit, and won&#39;t be well cared for.  Tho I suppose if we find it&#39;s not a good fit, we can always sell it on ebay and use the money for something that is a better fit.  <br/>
 <br/>
Really for me, it&#39;s the bigger issue of wanting to help them avoid disappointment when they impulsively trade one possession for another.  I find that I feel too attached to the outcome and their decisions about more expensive items that we can&#39;t afford to replace, if/when a child changes his mind. <br/>
