<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737006978">Caitlyn, almost 7, decided about a month ago that she no longer wanted to eat chicken because she had finally made the connection that chicken (something she liked to eat) was the same animal that ran around at the farms that we buy our meats from (and she adores chickens). So we respected her wishes and I&#39;ve stopped giving her anything that has chicken in it. Stephane and I still eat chicken, but have tried to be a bit more discreet - ie me not talking about how we&#39;re eating chicken for dinner.&nbsp; <br><br>Last night we were watching Earthflight which is all about birds and their lives and includes natural predators hunting the birds. Caitlyn turned to me and said &quot;mommy, do you think you and daddy could stop eating chicken too?&quot; I told her that I would talk to her dad about it and we would discuss it as a family. Incidentally, she said she&#39;s fine with eating beef - knows it&#39;s from a cow and said but I love chickens and I don&#39;t want to eat them.<br><br>We&#39;re willing to work around this, although I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m completely ready to stop eating chicken since it often comprises a couple of meals a week for us and would require shifting eating habits for him and I. But we&#39;re open to it. I also wonder if beef and pork (which we rarely eat anyway, might not be far behind). <br><br>Looking to hear if anyone has had any experiences with this and also different ways of looking at solutions. <br><br>Thanks<br>Laura &amp; Caitlyn (almost 7)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-804508699">I wouldn&#39;t stop eating chicken, but I WOULD shield a sensitive child.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;ve already said you&#39;re being discreet about it.  That&#39;s kind. <br/>
<br/>
Holly babysat for a girl who loved birds of all sorts, and wouldn&#39;t eat chicken or turkey or duck. No birds.   When she went to school, later, because of family circumstances, I don&#39;t know how that was handled, but I hope kindly.<br/>
<br/>
If a child asked me why I was eating chicken, I would say people are generally omnivores. My own ancestors are.  My grandparents raised chickens and killed one every Sunday for Sunday dinner.  Maybe you could talk about different traditions and religions and who will or won&#39;t eat what animals (not a full breakdown, but maybe a few examples) without trying to gross her out—just present the idea that there are people who won&#39;t eat various kinds of things—dogs, shellfish, cows, pigs—and other people who will, and do, and that it&#39;s been that way for thousands of years.  Not as persuasion or argument, just as information.  She has years to think about it and might change her own dietary preferences several times.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-993074699">My sister raises and LOVES her chickens as pets. She does eat their eggs. Really she loves all birds. She has been a vegetarian most of her life because she doesn&#39;t see the purpose in killing and eating animals. <br/>
<br/>
I, on the other hand, love meat and it is a part of my everyday diet. When I go visiting my sister we never expect to be served meat at her house. We graciously eat whatever foods she prepares for us. However, she does like to surprise me with a meat dish every now and then and has no problem with me or my family eating meat. When she visits me, I prepare our typical meals plus special no meat dishes for her. In other words, we do not impose our beliefs on each other. We have discussed our thoughts about meat together but have never said to each other, &quot;Don&#39;t eat meat or you need to eat meat.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I think being kind and discreet, as you&#39;ve been, is good. I would also talk about how each family member has their own thoughts and beliefs and those should be respected without forcing others to believe what they believe.  All on a scale she can understand. Even coming to a compromise and your family having more meatless meals per week, if that&#39;s what everyone can agree on. Ask her if she&#39;d like to help research new and fun meatless recipes with you. It could turn out to be a fun experience for your family. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this is maybe the key point. I&#39;ve been vegan for a long time,<br/>
and vegetarian for even longer. In all honesty, it does upset me that<br/>
people I love do something I consider to be morally wrong. However, as<br/>
an adult, I understand that it&#39;s their decision and not mine, and I<br/>
don&#39;t say that to them or encourage them to change their beliefs. But a<br/>
child doesn&#39;t necessarily understand that social expectation yet. From<br/>
her point of view, if this is a Bad Thing to do (whatever &#39;bad thing&#39;<br/>
means to her exactly), then it&#39;s a Bad Thing whoever is doing it, and<br/>
it&#39;s not unreasonable that she would like for other people not to do it<br/>
either. Equally, it&#39;s not unreasonable for you not to take her beliefs<br/>
as your own! But that&#39;s not an obvious principle. It&#39;s a useful one to<br/>
come to terms with, though, for social reasons. <br/>
<br/>
If it really does bother her that other people don&#39;t share her views,<br/>
maybe you could help her explore other more socially acceptable options<br/>
for persuading people. She could look into something like the Vegetarian<br/>
Society if that exists where you are, or other campaigns or<br/>
organisations that act to inform people about the issues she&#39;s concerned<br/>
with. Of course, those have their social boundaries too (eg not passing<br/>
campaign postcards around at the dinner table!) but you can talk to her<br/>
about that as well. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-402147361">I believe our bodies have certain needs that it&#39;s important to stay attuned too. If I don&#39;t eat beef for long periods of time I literally start feeling ill. If I drink caffeinated beverages my throat will hurt. If I eat soy and too much gluten, I gain weight. Meat seams to work best for my body as well as a lot of green veggies (not raw, but cooked). My son feels sick when he eats meat everyday. His lips tingle and get swollen when he eats certain fruits and when he&#39;s sick he finds avoiding corn, soy and wheat help his immune system, get its healing done faster. Amazingly enough, we took him for allergy testing after several bouts of hives and grains where one of the things that showed he had a slight intolerance to. But we already knew that because we listened to his body. The kids can eat candy and feel great, I eat candy (sugary things) and I tend to not feel well. Except chocolate. I don&#39;t care how sick I get!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Same with other things in life. I get on a swing and I&#39;m going to barf. The kids can swing to the moon and back and have wonderful fun!!  I&#39;m good at pushing them on the swings and pretending to be their rocket power.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe explaining things like this to your little one might help. We all have different needs and desires. I realize that hers seem to me to be more of an ethical/humane one, but other discussions might come up now or later that might be good for you to store away.<br/>
