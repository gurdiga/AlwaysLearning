infant do it. I didn&#39;t see Karl roll over once. (I wasn&#39;t looking for<br/>
it either but if I had, it might have worried me some.)<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think rolling over is a stage but something the majority of<br/>
babies do of their own accord. So much so that it&#39;s in baby books with<br/>
a date line for the mother to record the details if she wants to.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying there ARE no stages. I&#39;m just saying that not<br/>
everything is necessarily a stage just because many babies do<br/>
something.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes, spare your kids frustration as much as possible while they learn, which<br/>
&gt; is really all the time (this list IS always learning).  Frustration is an<br/>
&gt; inevitable part of life, it will happen at some point that a child is<br/>
&gt; frustrated and there may be little a parent can do to change things, other<br/>
&gt; than being there and being kind and sympathetic.  So, anytime a parent can<br/>
&gt; avoid frustrating a kid, that seems like a positive good thing!  When my<br/>
&gt; babies struggled to do things, I didn&#39;t sit there and watch them struggle, I<br/>
&gt; helped them, either by handing them the thing they wanted, or sitting them<br/>
&gt; up to see, or rolling them over, or picking them up to be held and loved up.<br/>
&gt;  It&#39;s not as if infants need to be trained to roll over.  They will do it<br/>
&gt; now or later.  Once that infant is 2, they&#39;ll be able to roll over, barring<br/>
&gt; physical handicaps.<br/>
