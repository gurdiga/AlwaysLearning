<div id="ygrps-yiv-2126715865">**I&#39;m with Kelly.  I always want to know what is going on with my kids<br/>
and <br/>
a good purveyor of information can be very useful.  Sometimes it can be <br/>
annoying -- because the tattler&#39;s motives may not be of purely helpful <br/>
intent.  Sometimes (or many times) they just wanna see someone get in <br/>
TROUBLE.**<br/>
<br/>
Oh!  In nonpunishing families &quot;telling&quot; what happened doesn&#39;t actually<br/>
get anyone into &quot;trouble&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally have always been a tattler -- I think because I am<br/>
genetically predisposed to gossip.<br/>

True!<br/>

Kinda like if you&#39;re unschooling and so learning is the goal (instead of <br/>
grades and &quot;school work&quot;) then there can be no such thing as cheating.  <br/>
Either you learn something or not, it doesn&#39;t matter whose hands were on the <br/>
keyboard or the book or the pencil.<br/>
<br/>
So if tattling doesn&#39;t lead to punishment, tattling is no longer worthy of <br/>
being considered a trouble-making sin, but is only a safety or fairness issue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1693275321">I love tattlers.<br/>
Really.<br/>
They get to tattling and every time they pause, I say, &quot;Uh, huh.  And THEN <br/>
what did you do?&quot;.  Even when they&#39;re done with the complaint part of the <br/>
story...  ...and there I am just asking them what they did next instead of <br/>
commiserating.<br/>
<br/>
Takes all the fun right out of it and puts the end right back on their own <br/>
shoulders.<br/>
Poor things.<br/>

(except when fire was involved, maybe.)<br/>
(but only because I like to play with fire too...)<br/>
(er, I mean, experiment with fire...)<br/>
(er, I mean, work responsibly with fire and never burn stuff just to see <br/>
how it combusts.)<br/>
(ever)<br/>
(except for maybe sometimes.)<br/>
(because that&#39;s science and everyone knows that Unschoolers need more <br/>
science in their lives.)<br/>

An odd example of this came up in my husbands experiences while teaching<br/>
and working on his credential simultaneously.  People post lesson plans<br/>
on the &#39;net to share with other teachers.  It&#39;s legitimate to use them<br/>
for your job but not to submit them as part of your homework for your<br/>
college classes.  <br/>

I&#39;ve never used the word &quot;tattle&quot; with my kids, I&#39;ve never wanted to<br/>
discourage communication.  A few times I have been clued in to problems<br/>
that needed intervention.<br/>
<br/>
The place Lanora has had problem is with other kids, &quot;Why did you &#39;rag me<br/>
out&#39;?&quot;.  She has always discussed everything with me and most of the<br/>
things she tells me about her friends I just absorb.  There have been a<br/>
couple of times that I had to step in and they have gotten angry with<br/>
her.  She just replies, &quot;I tell my mom everything.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She knows that I trust her to know a safe secret from an unsafe one but<br/>
she feels weird keeping it from me.  The funny thing is, when the<br/>
neighborhood kids have a problem they come to her, maybe it&#39;s their<br/>
roundabout way of telling me too.  Most of them have parents who are not<br/>
involved, as long as their kids aren&#39;t bothering THEM they don&#39;t care<br/>
much WHAT they are doing.  Not much wonder that our house seems to be a<br/>
hang out spot.<br/>
