<div id="ygrps-yiv-803129055">&lt;&lt; Some people do not get upset or unhappy.  They go along.  Biochemical <br/>
advantage.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Yes, but do they ever really feel anything with intensity?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Not that I&#39;ve seen.  And which is better?  To never get thrilled but &gt;never be <br/>
&gt;heartbroken, or to have ecstacy and depression?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I&#39;ve heard it said various ways that as high as your high is, that&#39;s how &gt;low <br/>
&gt;your low will be too.  The variation from baseline is small for some &gt;people <br/>
&gt;and I envy them sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would have agreed with you when I was younger because I had trouble managing my personality.  Now that I&#39;m 45, I feel differently (youth vs. experience).  I love the highs and I&#39;m driven to keep searching for my next passion. I&#39;ve learned how to manage the other end of the emotional spectrum.  It takes about 3 days for the intense emotions to subside as long as I don&#39;t fuel them.  So for example, if I had been passionate about the recent unschooling list argument that sent me to this list, I would not have responded or read any emails after I became angered.  In three days the anger would have subsided and I could then decide how I wanted to proceed.  That is not such a big price to pay for ecstacy.  One must learn to stay focused :-)<br/>
