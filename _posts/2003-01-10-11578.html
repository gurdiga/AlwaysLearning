<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It was a blast, actually. We have a cool organization up here, The Family <br/>
Resource Center, which plans group trips and community learning threoughout <br/>
New England, and they planned the trip. We did five workshops: Environmental <br/>
Aspects, the Hall of Fame (you know you&#39;ve made it in life when you&#39;ve been <br/>
named to the Plastics Hall of Fame), and artist shared Plastics carving, and <br/>
the coolest were the last two, Polymer Chemistry and Engineering. <br/>
<br/>
Chemistry was taught by this COOL Norwegian retired teacher who LOVES <br/>
Chemistry and loves that she gets to share it without worrying about kids <br/>
grades, etc. She prefers to be called Grammy because she feels that lots of <br/>
people are afraid of Chemistry, and learning about it from someone named <br/>
Grammy makes it seem cozier. The workshop was totally hands-on.<br/>
<br/>
The Engineering thing was taught by a cool many who LOVED all the cool <br/>
plastics machines that had been donated. My son had his sneaker <br/>
shrink-wrapped (a good thing in the case of my son&#39;s smelly sneaker), and we <br/>
had a mission to use heat guns and plastics to engineer a bottle. I have to <br/>
say, the hands- on activities were FAR from lame, unusual for people working <br/>
with kids.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a cool place.<br/>

&lt;&lt; I wonder if the Smithsonian has a curator of plastics? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know David Allison who&#39;s curator of the history of computers.  Used to be <br/>
the whole technology thing, but I think he&#39;s organizing the history of <br/>
computers now.  Or was a couple of years ago.  <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s from SC, but married Ymelda Martinez, who was my first (one lesson) <br/>
guitar teacher.  My only guitar teacher. &lt;g&gt;  I always say she taught me to <br/>
play guitar and it embarrasses her, but she did!  I needed to know what the <br/>
terminology was in the book, and what the notation meant.  I&#39;d seen and heard <br/>
my mom play it all my life, but she did it with a pick and I wanted to <br/>
fingerpick.  So Ymelda showed me how to fingerpick and I was off!<br/>
<br/>
What was that stuff made out of pre-WWII that was like plastic?  I guess it <br/>
was plastic.  But it was HARD and kinda crumbly after a while.  They made <br/>
brushes and mirror handles out of it, and sometimes jewelry boxes and little <br/>
stuff like that.  I think I always saw it look kind of pearlescent, white or <br/>
light pink.  But I can&#39;t think of its name.   <br/>
<br/>
And Bakelite, that was black and they made heatproof trays out of it.    Like <br/>
the trays under steak trays.<br/>
<br/>
Those should be in the Smithsonian History of Plastic place. &lt;b&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And Spoolies.  Remember little curlers (those of you who&#39;re old enough) from <br/>
the 60&#39;s that looked kinda like little flying saucers when they were closed?<br/>

to be heat proof, but perhaps that&#39;s because I don&#39;t get into heated<br/>
conversations on the phone so it&#39;s not a problem I&#39;d ever encounter.<br/>
