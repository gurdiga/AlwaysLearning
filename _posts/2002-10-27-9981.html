&lt;&lt;  really hate the idea of suing a place for an injury, but truly that ramp <br/>
 was bad.  Couldn&#39;t possibly be legally to code.  And so at least I want the <br/>
 hotel&#39;s insurance company to pay my co-pays and wheelchair rental and such.  <br/>
 But I don&#39;t know what&#39;s right and good to ask for otherwise.  So that gives <br/>
 me kind of a heartache and headache, just thinking about that.  <br/>
 <br/>
 Keith/dh would be thrilled if I could bring in some  money to help pay off <br/>
 charge cards and recent important car repairs.   <br/>
 <br/>
 If any of you feel like discussing that, I could use advice, and if nobody <br/>
 wants to talk about it that&#39;s probably even better.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think there are good reasons for the right to sue when there is negligence. <br/>
It helps keep people/companies responsible. Certainly some people take <br/>
advantage of it, but ultimately, it&#39;s not a bad thing.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, the hotel was negligent. The ramp was too steep and slippery. <br/>
They took their time covering it with something with more traction. They took <br/>
their time calling for help. Theire representative never exhibited concern <br/>
for you, but spent lots of time getting witnesses&#39;s names.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion? I think you should sue, for medical bills, for pain and <br/>
suffering, and for loss of ...prestige or something? A lawyer would have a <br/>
better word...for not being able to be the keynote at the conference.  First, <br/>
I think they&#39;d get the ramp fixed faster, second, I think you genuinely have <br/>
a case on all those grounds, and finally, I think you have such a good case <br/>
that the hotel&#39;s insurance company will just settle.(and then make them fix <br/>
the ramp). <br/>
<br/>
I hope you&#39;re feeling better soon.<br/>

You could put in a paved pathway, to make it easier for you to be<br/>
wheeled in and out.  You might be able to recover the cost of that. <br/>
(Maybe I&#39;m stretching.)<br/>
