<div id="ygrps-yiv-222555648">I am eager to try blending tofu with &quot;melted choco chips&quot;.  What<br/>
is it?  I am Brazilian and live in Tokyo. (Hi Deb!   Sorry, for<br/>
the absence.  Tuesday we are going to Brazil again.)  Do you melt<br/>
any chocolate or am I supposed to melt choco chips and then blend<br/>
it with the tofu. ?  Sorry for my ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
As for the tofu steak, we here prefer to have some some<br/>
cornstarch or white flour around the tofu before frying it on the<br/>
pan with olive oil and garlic.  Ups, first I wrap them in kitchen<br/>
paper and microwave for 3 min at 500w. then, flavor with black<br/>
pepper and  salt.<br/>
<br/>
Happy new year to you all!</div>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Yes, melt the chocolate chips and add to the blended tofu.  Blend it in <br/>
&gt; your blender and don&#39;t use a hand mixer.  It doesn&#39;t work and you waste <br/>
&gt; perfectly good chocolate!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

Oh, yeah fresh fruit that would probably be good too! :)<br/>

Hello!   We&#39;ve been so busy, but I&#39;ve missed you!<br/>
Is there an address in Brazil where Aya may receive a package?   We have<br/>
a PILE of things to send her!<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I lost the tofu / chocolate chip post, I can&#39;t help.  But it sounds<br/>
wonderful, doesn&#39;t it?<br/>
<br/>
I would love to hear what you&#39;ve been doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Love & Peace,<br/>
<br/>
Deb<br/>
