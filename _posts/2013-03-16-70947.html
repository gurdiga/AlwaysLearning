<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845649244">I want to tell a story, and it&#39;s like a brag, but it wasn&#39;t something I did (not this week).<br/>
<br/>
Holly has been on a road trip with her boyfriend, to visit his brother in Arcata, where he&#39;s living going to Humbolt College in far northern California they stayed with other friends along the way, and are on their way back today.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a really nice photo of them:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2013/03/holly-and-will-in-redwoods.html">http://sandradodd.blogspot.com/2013/03/holly-and-will-in-redwoods.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Marty and his girlfriend are on a roadtrip, because he broke his arm and she&#39;s between jobs. He&#39;s on medical leave from work, it&#39;s spring break from the college, and he might as well be sitting in a car as sitting at the house.  They were in Carson City, Nevada yesterday, at a museum and a laundromat and probably other places. :-)  They&#39;ve gone to ghost towns and historic sites, a casino in Las Vegas (a place more familiar to them than the rest), and will be in Colorado tomorrow, I think, visiting friends and shopping for cheese. :-)<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the good part.  They&#39;ve called us.  Marty twice, and Holly three times, just to let us know they&#39;re okay, and where they are.  I&#39;ve gotten photos in texts, and am following Holly&#39;s progress by twitter and photobucket uploads.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is 24 and Holly is 21.  They don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; call us.  They want to call us.  <br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t have predicted this, 20 years ago, but I&#39;m predicting it now for other families who can maintain close relationships and trust and friendship with their children.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I usually take it for granted - but sometimes I&#39;m reminded that the<br/>
relationship I have with my grown children is not all that usual.<br/>
<br/>
I told this on the radical unschooling info facebook page, but then saw<br/>
what Sandra had posted here and thought it was relevant (so I apologize to<br/>
those seeing it twice).<br/>
<br/>
Last night two college girls were working for me in the box office (I&#39;m the<br/>
box office manager for the college). We were talking and I asked them what<br/>
they would want their mother to do for them if they&#39;d had a big<br/>
disappointment. One girl said, &quot;Nothing. I probably wouldn&#39;t even tell my<br/>
mom.&quot; The other girl laughed and agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Just at that moment I got a text from my 22 year old, Rose. She&#39;s up in the<br/>
mountains at a camp with other college students. She was texting to let me<br/>
know she&#39;d arrived safely and was all unpacked and everything was fine.<br/>
<br/>
She didn&#39;t have to do that and I really wasn&#39;t expecting it. But she knew<br/>
I&#39;d be very happy to know.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-277314130">Pam Sorooshian posted something in Radical Unschooling Info (on facebook) that matches what I reported about my kids calling home.<br/>
<br/>
-----------<br/>
Last night, two college students working in the box office with me. I asked them, &quot;If you had a big disappointment, what would you want your mom to do to help you?&quot; They both looked at me funny and one said, &quot;Nothing. I probably wouldn&#39;t even tell my mom.&quot; The other laughed and agreed.<br/>
<br/>
Just then Rose, who is up at a camp up in the mountains for the weekend with other college students, texted me to say she&#39;d arrived safely. I didn&#39;t expect her to do that, but she knew I&#39;d be happy to know it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1260257415">Sorry for those who saw Pam&#39;s writing THREE times, but it seemed really important.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe there are lots of people whose grown children contact them casually and often, and maybe what we&#39;re writing about isn&#39;t such a big deal.  Maybe.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What I&#39;ve come to really appreciate is that my adult daughter really and truly cares how I feel. She cares about my comfort and discomfort. When we are out and about together, she doesn&#39;t want to do things that would bring negative attention to me. It&#39;s kind of a big deal only because she&#39;s a very stand out sort of person. I like that she thinks about and is considerate of others. She has a quiet sort of respectfulness about her in all the right places in public.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of her friends, although lovely people, aren&#39;t that way at all. They have a selfish loudness about them. I don&#39;t know how else to describe this.<br/>
