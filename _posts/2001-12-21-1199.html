<div id="ygrps-yiv-203341239">Han, Han. Hans makes me think of the horse that could do math ;-) He was<br/>
my favorite, and my daughter likes him, too, although she prefers<br/>
Harrison Ford  as Indiana Jones.<br/>
<br/>
I liked Arnie, and  Jean Claude van Damme, especially in Bloodsport - I<br/>
think his movies slid gradually downhill after that, but that was so bad<br/>
it was good. Also Gregory Harrison - must have a thing for the name<br/>
Harrison. And George was my Beatle..<br/>
<br/>
Dar, just sorta mixed up<br/>

<br/>
My role here lately is weird factoids that don&#39;t really go anywhere, but<br/>
I find them interesting anyway.<br/>

  Ah, now see, I always wonder if we can tell things about each other by who<br/>
  we had crushes on as young to middle teens.<br/>
<br/>
  Some of us (raises hand) liked the bad-good boys (Han Solo). Some of us (my<br/>
  sister) liked the androgynous too-good boys (Luke).<br/>
<br/>
  I married a guy who looks like a bad boy. My sister married two Malibu Kens<br/>
  in a row. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

  You&#39;re right about Anakin killing the emperor.<br/>
  But for some reason, in my mind Luke is the hero.<br/>
  Maybe it&#39;s the crush I had on Mark Hamill from so long ago. :-)<br/>

    Anakin was the chosen one, not Luke.  As Vader, Anakin<br/>
    kills the Emperor, and from that the balance comes.<br/>

    &gt; It&#39;s all coming back to me now. And in a way, Anakin<br/>
    &gt; was a vital piece of the puzzle to bring balance,<br/>
    &gt; being Luke&#39;s father, the real chosen one. (right?)<br/>
    &gt; I think it&#39;s time for another Star Wars marathon -<br/>
    &gt; it&#39;s been too long. :-D<br/>
