<div id="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><html><head></head>I posted this in the facebook page for Just Add Light—a page Holly set up for me and that I forget to post to.<div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">_______________</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">I just noticed that this week&#39;s Just Add Light posts have been heavy on the Karen James quotes. Some were recent things she wrote that were especially good; some had randomly arisen from&nbsp;here or there.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">Karen&#39;s writing and photos both are inspiring, so a clump of lots of it won&#39;t hurt anybody.&nbsp;<img class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025img" alt="" style="border:0px;vertical-align:-3px;" id="ygrps-yiv-1159846025B7739C83-6648-4D63-B9E1-9895898F2218" src="cid:6C021CAC-B00A-42E7-9BC3-81B341EDB1D2@PK5001Z">:-)</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">Here&#39;s something beautiful—Karen&#39;s words, Hema&#39;s photo:</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2018/08/rich-and-full.html" class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">https://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2018/08/rich-and-full.html</a></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">_____________________</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">More, for Always Learning:</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">While I do try to mix it up, on that blog, and not have the same topic twice in a short time, or the same photographer or writer (unless it’s me; it started off being all my quotes and photos), I lapsed, and when I looked back…. Karen James EVERYWHERE! :-)</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">I don’t mind. &nbsp;</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">The reason I wanted to bring it up here is because of something she wrote a couple of weeks ago about writing, that I still mean to be here. &nbsp;I keep getting busy with other things, so when I do bring that and make a big deal about Karen’s awareness and abilities, *I KNOW*, I know, it’s Karen James season. :-)</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">Also, looking back through some chat transcripts I saw names of people who used to write lots, regularly, beautifully, who have fallen away to other things in their lives, in peaceful, good ways. &nbsp;I miss their voices, when they’re gone, though. &nbsp;That’s a personal problem. :-) &nbsp;I’m glad to have things still on my site, in the chats that have been saved.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">I haven’t run a chat for nearly two years. &nbsp;It became a frustration to me. &nbsp;Sometimes hardly anyone showed up, but I always did. &nbsp;It was like the feelings when the kids and I finally decided not to host the unschooling park days that had grown out of a park day before we were unschooling. &nbsp;It used to have two host families, and one wandered off. &nbsp;It used to have ten strong regulars, and eventually it was more trouble for us than it was benefit to others. &nbsp;So for those who most loved the chats, I wantered off, too.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">But appreciate the voices of those who have come and shared thoughtfully and generously, whether they’ve stayed long, burned brightly for a short while, or stayed steadily in the background.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">THANK YOU, Karen, and others who have shared.</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">This isn’t a perfect collection, but it’s a collection:</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/othervoices.html" class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">http://sandradodd.com/othervoices.html</a></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025">Sandra</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"><br class="ygrps-yiv-1159846025"></div></html></div>
