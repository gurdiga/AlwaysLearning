<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836876527">This is an announcement about another unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
I found out indirectly yesterday that the list associated with <br/>
www.unschooling.com is now moderated.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not planning to go back to it, but I do expect there are people who left <br/>
it who would be interested in going back now that peace is more likely.<br/>

the chief offenders or whether they just realized they had to stop now that <br/>
it&#39;s moderated.<br/>

<br/>
Oh please.  She swore she was an unschooler and we couldn&#39;t say she wasn&#39;t, <br/>
no matter how clueless she proved herself to be about it.<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;m talking about &quot;it&quot;  eeeeeeek!!)<br/>
<br/>
Okay, the real &quot;IT&quot; is not any individual, but people who will go to any <br/>
means (except to actually unschool) to get (who?  the nuns of Holtism?  the <br/>
most prolific on some particular discussion?) someone to declare that they <br/>
are unschooling.  Or that unschooling is broad enough to include the <br/>
particular curriculum bits and coercion they are clinging to.  <br/>
<br/>
WHY!?  You don&#39;t even get a discount at Target for being an unschooler.  You <br/>
don&#39;t get to sit in the front at conferences.  You don&#39;t get diddly except <br/>
the satisfaction of being cool and courageous or something.<br/>
<br/>
I guess we&#39;re just cool.<br/>
<br/>
Oh ye Californians--is the editorial that was in the back of your newsletter <br/>
in the issue before this fall&#39;s conference available to post here?  The one <br/>
about unschooing being cool?  It said it better than I&#39;m thinking it.<br/>

fill it. :-)<br/>

after she &quot;left&quot;.  She still hasn&#39;t posted anything.<br/>

Actually we had a couple of women do that on the Canadian list.  They came <br/>
on and started a nasty religious flame war, left in a huff, then came right <br/>
back on with different names and addies.  I clued in pretty quickly when <br/>
these supposedly new members started defending the two who had just left <br/>
(that they had never &quot;met&quot;) but didn&#39;t know how to out them.  Stuart did <br/>
though.  Too funny.<br/>

unschooling-dotcom list signed on with another email address.  The alternate<br/>

Is this Stuart Brook BTW?<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m trying to figure out who this trouble person is.  The two who cause the <br/>
most trouble (in my opinion) are at it again today using their regular addies.<br/>
