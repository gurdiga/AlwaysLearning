<div id="ygrps-yiv-1932092536">I sent a post to a different list a while ago, but haven&#39;t gotten any <br/>
responses, so I would appreciate thoughts from this list.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters have developed a friendship that is great, but poses a <br/>
few mental challenges for me, so I am working to find ideas that will <br/>
allow everyone to be comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
The little girl is 5, and prefers to play in her home (an apartment <br/>
downstairs from us in our condo building).  She is very &quot;protective&quot; <br/>
of her toys and does not wish to have our son participate in the <br/>
playdates.  My daughters also enjoy the opportunity to go and play <br/>
somewhere new, and to have some time without their brother, so they <br/>
really really look forward to these play dates.  The little girl also <br/>
has a nice bedroom, lots of different kinds of toys, and the three <br/>
girls genuinely get along really well and are very sweet with each <br/>
other, looking for gifts for each other, thinking about each other <br/>
and what they like etc.  The mom is nice, and they have been coming <br/>
upstairs to our place somewhat regularly too, so we&#39;ve been getting <br/>
to know each other better, and she is a reasonably gentle mom, <br/>
although her daughter will go to school, etc.  They are committed to <br/>
staying in our building, and because the girls really like each <br/>
other, she seems committed to helping their friendship grow.  It is <br/>
also helpful to the mom for the girls to play down at her place, <br/>
because she works from home, and a part of the playdate usually <br/>
occurs when she is trying to get a few last things done and could use <br/>
the distraction for her daughter.<br/>
<br/>
Here are the parts that are challenging for me.  I am not used to <br/>
being separate from my daughters.  Up until now, they have always <br/>
wanted me right there for any activity, from playdates to parties to <br/>
classes.  They are playing downstairs 1-2/week for several hours.  <br/>
<br/>
There have been several times where the mom has taken the girls out <br/>
for dinner in our neighborhood (walking distance), and my husband has <br/>
not been available to accompany them, so I&#39;ve let them go with the <br/>
mom.  I truly believe that the mom is trying to &quot;do me a favor&quot; by <br/>
getting the girls out for dinner, and giving me some down time.  What <br/>
she doesn&#39;t know is that I really enjoy being with my kids as much as <br/>
possible, and would rather we not be separated from them.  My post to <br/>
the other list was triggered by the fact that they were going to take <br/>
the kids out to dinner, but were going to drive somewhere.  There <br/>
ended up not being enough booster seats, so the dinner became a <br/>
walking dinner.  She thought that the only issue was the car seats.  <br/>
Frankly, after my husband and I discussed it, we are not sure we even <br/>
want anyone else driving our kids around the city without us in the <br/>
car.  <br/>
<br/>
The father is also part of the challenge.  We have known him casually <br/>
for about 10 years, and are getting to know him better, but still not <br/>
someone we would call best buds.  He can be really sweet, is very <br/>
protective of his daughter, and very cautious and safety-oriented.  <br/>
On the other hand, he is also a fairly hot-tempered, foul language <br/>
using Chicago policeman, and he wears a gun regularly, and there are <br/>
guns in a locked cabinet at home.  It is my understanding that it is <br/>
ALWAYS locked, and this guy is almost zealotous in his safety <br/>
orientation, so I believe that for the most part.<br/>
<br/>
The relationship with my son is challenging to me.  The girls love <br/>
their little friend, but it can be hard on my son sometimes to not be <br/>
welcome in their home.  Historically I have taken the approach of <br/>
staying with him, because he is very attached, and the girls seem <br/>
comfortable.  I do have the opportunity to have our helper stay with <br/>
our son, but I think that he would be very upset about me going down <br/>
with the girls and him staying upstairs.  That is just not the usual <br/>
mo for him - he is always with me, unless I am going to a doctor&#39;s <br/>
appointment. <br/>
<br/>
I am finding it so complex, because it is what my daughters want and <br/>
they feel utterly comfortable with the situation, so I do not want to <br/>
make them upset about imposing requirements (or create an <br/>
unnecessarily fearful scenario for them by sharing all of my <br/>
concerns).  On the other hand, I want to make sure that I feel <br/>
comfortable, and currently, I do not always feel comfortable at all <br/>
times, particularly if I know that the father has been home and my <br/>
girls are there.  <br/>
<br/>
It is one of those situations where it is probably truly a 0% <br/>
likelihood that anything bad will ever happen, but I am just trying <br/>
to do the job of looking out for risk for my children, and this <br/>
situation has red flags in it for me.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like there is the need for more communication and possibly <br/>
some limit setting, but I want to do it very carefully, with all <br/>
parties, obviously.  That means I need to think a lot and could use <br/>
some input and examples of more experienced parents.<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult for me to ask other parents where we live, because I <br/>
think we have been outside of the norm, given the girls request that <br/>
we always be there.  I believe it is common for kids to have dropoff <br/>
playdates and birthday parties at much younger ages.  They were doing <br/>
it at age 4, when our daughter attended preschool for 1 year.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts would be very much appreciated.<br/>

Maybe make a big deal about doing something special with your son, so  <br/>
he doesn&#39;t feel left out, and he will have done something the girls  <br/>
are a little envious of.  Take advantage of the chance to do  <br/>
something that would be too expensive with four, but affordable with  <br/>
two, maybe.  That&#39;s what I used to do when one child was left out.   <br/>
We&#39;d go do something.  It distracted both of us.<br/>
<br/>
My comfort needs to be secondary to my kids&#39; comfort, the way I look  <br/>
at it.<br/>

I don&#39;t think you should get a sitter for your son to go with the girls.<br/>
<br/>
When I invite a kid over to play, it doesn&#39;t mean I want the mom over  <br/>
too.  It&#39;s more work to have another adult over than to just add a  <br/>
kid to the mix I already have (had; mine are not little now, but they  <br/>
were!).<br/>
<br/>
Can the kids call if they get uncomfortable so you could go and get  <br/>
them, or so they could talk to you?  If so, and if they know you&#39;re  <br/>
at the other end of the phone, that seems a good measure.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; car.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Perhaps you should address this first in your own mind and then with <br/>
others. Looking at this at first glance it seems reasonable since <br/>
you never know what could happen but at the same time there will <br/>
come a time when they *will* be with other people out in the world. <br/>
<br/>
Its like he parents who do not want their kids talking to the <br/>
opposite sex because it might lead to something but they forget that <br/>
kids need interaction so they can relate to being around others. For <br/>
a boy they need to be around boys so they get to know them so that <br/>
when dating happens they are not so sheltered that they get into <br/>
trouble. <br/>
<br/>
I hear the fear from you that you are scraed when they are not with <br/>
you BUT you have to let that go a little and then a little more. <br/>
Trust them and teach them to trust themselves- my daughter is 4 and <br/>
do not go anywhere without me but recently she met a girl who is 8 <br/>
and they want to go play together. I let them outside without me <br/>
because this girl is older and very motherly and they have to stay <br/>
within range of my sight out the door. It is scary to let your kids <br/>
go but do not protect so much at they can not learn or try out their <br/>
own skills. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So is this a challenge or not- Is your daughter comfortable around <br/>
him? I have kids who come to play at my house and when they see my <br/>
husband for the first time some of them say &quot;I have to go home now&quot;. <br/>
I have told my older son (14) to not tell his friends when he was <br/>
coming home so that if he needed a way out he could say &quot;i have to <br/>
go home now&quot; or if he calls to check in I will ask him if he needs <br/>
or wants to come home. Sometimes he would say yes and I would say ok <br/>
tell them you  have to come home now. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is challenging maybe a compromise could be every so often they <br/>
paly at your house with the brother but mostly play alone. I do not <br/>
think I caught how old your son was. If young enough can you <br/>
redirect him to other things?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I do have the opportunity to have our helper stay with <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hear you  here- the first time my son had a sleepover with a new <br/>
friend they were about 7 at the time I was scared to death that the <br/>
kids father would somehow molest him. Probably unrealistic but we <br/>
have all heard those stories right. <br/>
<br/>
I think you have to balance real RED FLAGS with our mothers FEARS <br/>
and walk between them. I am trying to ask my girls how they feel <br/>
about a situation and foster an enviroment that they will tellme <br/>
anything. My son is like that he knows that I will listen and give <br/>
advice not just the normal mom stuff. <br/>
<br/>
I think I would watch for warning signs from your girls. Are the <br/>
hesitant to go other when dad is home, are they drastically <br/>
different upon coming home? If you feel it is unsafe what could you <br/>
do to make it safer? Maybe you could go over there with them- it <br/>
would show the mom you DO NOT need a break and maybe they could play <br/>
with brother too. More work on your part but maybe worth the trouble <br/>
so see how the situation plays out<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; some input and examples of more experienced parents.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Maybe ask yourself how to empower your daughter to listen to her gut <br/>
and trust her choices which may not be your choices. What skills cna <br/>
you give her with out scaring her? How can you improve or foster a <br/>
relationship with her that she will talk to you and confide in you <br/>
without you jumping to rules and limiting. Now she is 4 but she will <br/>
be 10 and 16 and 18 and may need advice without you being scared of <br/>
the unknown. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter wanted to check out the friends house (they happen to <br/>
have the apartment above us) but she did not want to go alone and <br/>
wanted me to come too to check out the friends room. I did not want <br/>
to go but knew it was important to her that I come and check it out <br/>
with her so we all marched upstairs and I told the dad what we were <br/>
doing and why and he was fine with it. Most of all it showed my <br/>
daughter that I would walk with her through difficult times and we <br/>
could trust each other. She will listen to my judgment but also push <br/>
to make her own choices.<br/>
<br/>
You want them to be prepared to fight the world not shrink from it. <br/>
Just because it is uncomfortable for you does not make it wrong. I <br/>
have a sister who decided her kids would only have sleep overs at <br/>
her house because of all the bad stuff that could happen. What she <br/>
does not understand is that it would more than likely be a family <br/>
member hurting kids then outsiders so her kids would not really <br/>
be &quot;more&quot; safe they would just not have the skills to navigate in <br/>
this world. <br/>
<br/>
I hope something in here helps you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1755594175"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; I would let the girls decide.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So far I have been doing this.  I really trust their judgment of <br/>
people.  I have asked them if they are comfortable, and they are.  I <br/>
think that they are really accepting of the father&#39;s personality, <br/>
because we have not said anything that would cause them to feel <br/>
otherwise.  He is kind of a known element in our community, although <br/>
it is different when you start to strike up a real relationship with <br/>
people rather than casual elevator conversation.<br/>
<br/>
However, with that said, I do not believe that they are considering <br/>
the same set of information as I am in making their decision.  They <br/>
are so used to my husband and I being around them that they are very <br/>
trusting, and I think that they would expect that we would not put <br/>
them into a dangerous or uncomfortable situation.  I have not shared <br/>
any concerns about the gun the father wears, or the gun locker (my <br/>
husband and I have both acknowledged that it&#39;s important for the <br/>
locker to stay locked, and only the dad to go in), or the father&#39;s <br/>
hot temper with our girls.  <br/>
<br/>
Would you share, and if so, how might you share these with 8 and 6 <br/>
yo&#39;s, without making it seem like a scary situation?  I am starting <br/>
to get a sense of how I might be able to approach this, but would <br/>
definitely still appreciate help.<br/>

I have been having these really great play sessions with my son, but <br/>
on days when he seems a little more fragile and likely to melt down <br/>
when they leave, I do have a few options of places to take him. <br/>
<br/>
I also just need to find a way to get over the feeling of how unfair <br/>
it is to my son.  He is so sweet, and he knows that he is unwelcome <br/>
and excluded, and that hurts me so much to see.  I see though, that <br/>
being the adult means that I might need to put my sense of fairness <br/>
aside, and just focus on making the best of the situation for him.  <br/>
Hopefully the more positive instances we have, the better it will <br/>
feel over time.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would really put babysitting my son last on the list.  You are <br/>
correct that the mom doesn&#39;t want more people there.  She is usually <br/>
working while the kids are playing, and in effect, my daughters are <br/>
babysitting her daughter while she is there.  She&#39;s even said <br/>
jokingly that she would be willing to pay for playdates.  I think <br/>
that she would relish actually having her daughter come to our home <br/>
on her own, but her daughter is also hesitant to play away from her.  <br/>
I&#39;ve thought that if we could improve the little brother situation, <br/>
then we could exchange playdates, and I&#39;m sure at some time that <br/>
might happen, but not for now.  We do have them stay for dinner <br/>
sometimes, though, and the little girl seems fine with my son then, <br/>
for the most part.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; at the other end of the phone, that seems a good measure.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>You know, this highlights something that I think is important for me <br/>
to talk with the girls about.  Because we have always traveled as a <br/>
pack, the girls have not really been focused on learning the typical <br/>
emergency information that you might expect.  Because this family is <br/>
in the building, simply a few floors away, I have not stressed this.<br/>
<br/>
However, I think that it might be reasonable for me to suggest that <br/>
if they want to go out to dinner with this family, and play without <br/>
me there, that it might be a good idea for us to go ahead and <br/>
memorize things like our phone number, address, etc.  My oldest has <br/>
asked if she can get a cell phone when she gets older, and I&#39;ve told <br/>
her that when it seems like she needs one, then we will go ahead and <br/>
get it.  Perhaps now is the right time for one that will dial <br/>
home/mom cell/dad cell.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much, this is very helpful.<br/>

moms, mostly because they would not worry about taking their <br/>

I have two daughters there, one 8 and one 6.  I know that when they <br/>

disagreement between the mother/father, or something else, I do not <br/>

child, our home may seem noisy and intimidating to her.  There is not <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231653440">hi there.....I have yet to post but I wanted to respond to this string of<br/>
posts and suggest the book, &quot;Protecting the Gift, Keeping Children and<br/>
Teenagers Safe (and Parents Sane)&quot; by Gavin De Becker. on page 82, he says,<br/>
&quot;Until a child is old enough to understand what predatory strategies look<br/>
like, old enough and confident enough to resist them, assertive enough to<br/>
seek help, powerful enough to enforce the word No -- until all that happens,<br/>
a child is too young to be his (or her) own protector, too young to merit<br/>
any of your reliance, too young to be part of the defense system, period.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
my two cents is to trust your gut, your body is telling you there are red<br/>
flags about the father, his temper and that he has guns.....if knowledge of<br/>
the man&#39;s temper intimidates your husband as you mentioned, imagine the<br/>
effect on two little girls in terms of intimidation.....it doesn&#39;t mean the<br/>
father is a predator but on the other hand he could be and with intimidation<br/>
already as a given it could be enough to silence your two  little girls if<br/>
anything did happen......it&#39;s a hard reality to face but as parents we<br/>
must.....you should really read the book, and as Becker says, &quot;be very<br/>
careful who you bring into your child&#39;s life&quot; he also gives some great tips<br/>
on how to tell if your friends, family or acquaintances are in denial<br/>
because you don&#39;t want to leave your child with someone in denial either.<br/>
There are questions you can ask, answers that indicate denial, etc. if the<br/>
parents don&#39;t understand your feelings and concerns or they try to minimize<br/>
them, that&#39;s a huge red flag....to quote the book,  &quot; we minimize only that<br/>
which looms large, and the fact that we make an excuse for someone&#39;s<br/>
behavior is a sure sign that we perceive something wrong with the behavior.&quot;<br/>
I have to go but obviously, I highly recommend the book. :)<br/>
<br/>
Best, <br/>
