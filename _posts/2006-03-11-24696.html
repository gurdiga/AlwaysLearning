So...  This group has passed the 1000 mark by yahoogroups count.  I  <br/>
realize there are probably one or two hundred whose addresses are  <br/>
abandoned yet not bouncing, and another couple of hundred who are no- <br/>
mail and only check the website occasionally.  Still, even the  <br/>
balance of that is a big number.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There have been more new members recently than usual.  Was the  <br/>
address published somewhere or something?  Just wondering...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
No doubt people are here for different reasons and learned of the  <br/>
list various ways.  Sometimes this list is very quiet, and sometimes  <br/>
there&#39;s a flurry of activity.  For those who are in a hurry for some  <br/>
particular information, here are some links:<br/>
<br/>
Similar lists, with more particular topics, are listed here:  http:// <br/>
sandradodd.com/lists<br/>
<br/>
One is for new unschoolers, one is for unschoolers whose children are  <br/>
all very young, and there are others.<br/>

Maybe it was a mistake that was meant to be.  :)  Unschooling rocks!  It&#39;s<br/>
been wonderful for my family.  We have such a great life and great<br/>
communication between us all.  My kids are learning all the time.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-430098170">I haven&#39;t been super active on this group, but I enjoy reading the<br/>
things I find here.  I am in the beginnings of unschooling, just<br/>
convincing myself that I don&#39;t have to keep my son busy with workbooks<br/>
in order for him to learn.  This, and other sites, have been very<br/>
helpful.  <br/>
By the way, I was wondering, are there any regularly scheduled chats,<br/>
or does anyone in here use the chat much?  Just curious.<br/>

<h4>Grame Family</h4>
<time>14 Mar 2006, at 12:03pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-868255677">Hi I wanted to introduce myself.  I joined because I am unschooling  <br/>
my kids again after a brief lapse of my common sense thinking they  <br/>
needed a set curriculum to learn.  Actually it was my fear of having  <br/>
to teach my kindergartener how to read.  I know now what I have  <br/>
always known, she will learn when she is ready and not a moment  <br/>
before and she will teach herself.<br/>
<br/>
I started unschooling when my oldest was 6.  He is 8 now and will  <br/>
never go to school, nor does he ever want to go to school.  I also  <br/>
have a 6 year old girl, who is teaching herself her letters and  <br/>
sounds, and a little boy 3 who is a lively spirit who chose us for  <br/>
some reason.  My friends tell me because I&#39;m the only one patient  <br/>
enough.  We like to tell strangers who give him funny looks that is  <br/>
is going to be in the X games when he grows up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Raven a SAHM, who remodels homes, gardens, knits, cooks, sews,  <br/>
has a degree in ceramics, has been a manager in a life before kids  <br/>
and would love to live on a mini farm for my next home.  For now we  <br/>
live in a town of 300 people with our back yard backing onto a wheat  <br/>
field.  That is as close to the country my dh wants to live.<br/>
<br/>
Nice meeting all of you!  Love this group so far!<br/>
<br/>
Raven<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-726658636">I am new to the group as well. And I always knew I would homeschool. Things were great my son was doing really well until I officially started homeschooling. The homeschooling group I joined appeared to be unschooling and child led in their philosophy but advice and information was all curriculum directed.  Following this direction kind of ruined things  for my child. For several years things were really bad for him me and our family.  So we  have gone back to unschooling.  It has been a little over a year.    I must admit at the time I didn&#39;t know there was a name for it un schooling or child led or parent attachment. We were just naturally doing it. Thing are getting back to a good place for our family now.<br/>
I have several support groups and a umbrella group for overseeing home instruction.  Others I have talked to suggested I join this and couple other groups, where there is a wealth of information and support. I hope to be more of a advocate in the child led philosophies with my groups. I hope to find lots of  valuable information, both help me in my personal journey but also help member of my group understand more about the of child led choice as a way of life. <br/>
Thank you T    <br/>

  Hi I wanted to introduce myself.  I joined because I am unschooling  <br/>
  my kids again after a brief lapse of my common sense thinking they  <br/>
  needed a set curriculum to learn.  Actually it was my fear of having  <br/>
  to teach my kindergartener how to read.  I know now what I have  <br/>
  always known, she will learn when she is ready and not a moment  <br/>
  before and she will teach herself.<br/>
<br/>
  I started unschooling when my oldest was 6.  He is 8 now and will  <br/>
  never go to school, nor does he ever want to go to school.  I also  <br/>
  have a 6 year old girl, who is teaching herself her letters and  <br/>
  sounds, and a little boy 3 who is a lively spirit who chose us for  <br/>
  some reason.  My friends tell me because I&#39;m the only one patient  <br/>
  enough.  We like to tell strangers who give him funny looks that is  <br/>
  is going to be in the X games when he grows up.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m Raven a SAHM, who remodels homes, gardens, knits, cooks, sews,  <br/>
  has a degree in ceramics, has been a manager in a life before kids  <br/>
  and would love to live on a mini farm for my next home.  For now we  <br/>
  live in a town of 300 people with our back yard backing onto a wheat  <br/>
  field.  That is as close to the country my dh wants to live.<br/>
<br/>
  Nice meeting all of you!  Love this group so far!<br/>
<br/>
  Raven<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Has anyone saved what Pam Sorooshian has written about unschooling  <br/>
being neither &quot;child led&quot; nor &quot;parent led&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
And maybe Robin wrote something about it too.  Someone did...<br/>
<br/>
There don&#39;t need to be leaders when families get into the rhythm of  <br/>
doing things that will be fun for others in the family.  If it&#39;s okay  <br/>
for people to say &quot;No thanks&quot; or &quot;Sure!&quot; it&#39;s not child led.<br/>
<br/>
Today Marty wanted to go to Explora, because it was Pi Day and he had  <br/>
heard on TV (before he left for work) that they were doing something  <br/>
at the museum.  So Holly and I went with him.  I called Keith (the  <br/>
dad) at work to see if he&#39;d want to go with us, as he&#39;s the mathier  <br/>
of the parents, and though he wished he wanted to go, and he thought  <br/>
about it, he opted out because it&#39;s the first warm day since last  <br/>
week and he wanted to work on a woodworking project when he got  <br/>
home.  That&#39;s fine.  Nobody was disappointed.  There wasn&#39;t pressure  <br/>
one way or the other.<br/>
<br/>
In earlier years probably all of us took it a little harder if  <br/>
someone didn&#39;t want to do something others thought was fun, but  <br/>
loosening up and knowing there would be other things later brought us  <br/>
to the point that it&#39;s truly okay for someone to say yes, or no, and  <br/>
the suggestions come from any and all of us.   It probably helps that  <br/>
there are five of us, so someone can usually find a partner to share  <br/>
in an outing or project or interest.<br/>
