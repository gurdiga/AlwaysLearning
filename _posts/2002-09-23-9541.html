<div id="ygrps-yiv-910317292">While the Potter works prompted Christians to write works like &quot;Harry Potter <br/>
and the Bible: the Menace Behind the Magick&quot; and &quot;What&#39;s a Christian to do <br/>
with Harry Potter?&quot;, Christians have written positive books about the Tolkien <br/>
trilogy such as &quot;Finding God in &#39;The Lord of the Rings&#39; &quot; by Kurt Bruner and <br/>
Jim Ware.<br/>
&quot;I think one main difference between the two is that J.R.R. Tolkien develops <br/>
an entire world, Middle-earth, that you understand does not exist,&quot; Stewart <br/>
said. &quot;Rowling does not make the same thing obvious with Harry Potter. You <br/>
can&#39;t look at Harry Potter as fantasy because she confuses the lines between <br/>
reality and make-believe.&quot;<br/>

paragraphs.)<br/>

Another nice-looking webpage.<br/>

Someone can be really slow-thinking and still make a nice webpage, it seems:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is the Lord of the Rings harmless fantasy or perhaps even a wholesome <br/>
Christian allegory? We think not. I read The Hobbit and the three volumes of <br/>
The Lord of the Rings in 1971 when I was in Vietnam with the U.S. Army. I was <br/>
not saved at the time, and, in fact, I was very antagonistic to the Christian <br/>
faith; and had the books contained even a hint of Bible truth, I can asse <br/>
details of the books, I can recall very vividly that they are filled with <br/>
occultic imagery. The books were published in inexpensive paperback editions <br/>
in the late 1960s, and they became very popular with that generation of drug <br/>
headed hippies. -=-<br/>

From that same article:<br/>
 he remained a Catholic throughout his life. In his last interview, two years <br/>
before his death, he unhesitatingly testified, &quot;I’m a devout Roman Catholic.&quot; <br/>
J.R. Tolkien married his childhood sweetheart, Edith, and they had four <br/>
children. He wrote them letters each year as if from Santa Claus, and a <br/>
selection of these was published in 1976 as &quot;The Father Christmas Letters.&quot; <br/>
One of Tolkien’s sons became a Catholic priest. Tolkien was an advisor for <br/>
the translation of the Roman Catholic Jerusalem Bible.<br/>
. . . .<br/>
<br/>
One of Tolkien’s drinking buddies was the famous C.S. Lewis. They and some <br/>
other Oxford associates formed a group called the &quot;Inklings&quot; and met <br/>
regularly at an Oxford pub to drink beer and regale about literary and other <br/>
matters. Tolkien, in fact, is credited with influencing Lewis to become a <br/>
Christian of sorts. Like Tolkien, though, Lewis did not accept the Bible as <br/>
the infallible Word of God and he picked and chose what he would believe <br/>
about the New Testament apostolic faith. . . .<br/>
<br/>
(Proof he wasn&#39;t REALLY a Christian...)<br/>
<br/>
Though the aforementioned reviewers would have us believe that Tolkien’s <br/>
books contain simple allegories of good vs. evil, Tolkien portrays wizards <br/>
and witches and wizardry as both good and evil. There is white magic and <br/>
black magic in Tolkien’s fantasies. For example, a wizard named Gandalf is <br/>
portrayed as a good person who convinces Bilbo Baggins in The Hobbit to take <br/>
a journey to recover stolen treasure. The books depict the calling up of the <br/>
dead to assist the living, which is plainly condemned in the Scriptures. <br/>
Though not as overtly and sympathetically occultic as the Harry Potter <br/>
series, Tolkien’s fantasies are unscriptural and present a very dangerous <br/>
message.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
n his last interview in 1971, Tolkien plainly stated that he did not intend <br/>
The Lord of the Rings as a Christian allegory and that Christ is not depicted <br/>
in his fantasy novels. When asked about the efforts of the trilogy’s hero, <br/>
Frodo, to struggle on and destroy the ring, Tolkien said, &quot;But that seems I <br/>
suppose more like an allegory of the human race. I’ve always been impressed <br/>
that we’re here surviving because of the indomitable courage of quite small <br/>
people against impossible odds: jungles, volcanoes, wild beasts... they <br/>
struggle on, almost blindly in a way&quot; (Interview by Dennis Gerrolt; it was <br/>
first broadcast in January 1971 on BBC Radio 4 program &quot;Now Read On…&quot;). That <br/>
doesn’t sound like the gospel to me. When Gerrolt asked Tolkien, &quot;Is the book <br/>
to be considered as an allegory?&quot; the author replied, &quot;No. I dislike allegory <br/>
whenever I smell it.&quot;<br/>
Thus, the author of The Lord of the Rings denied the very thing that some <br/>
Christians today are claiming, that these fantasies are an allegory of <br/>
Christ’s victory over the devil. <br/>
