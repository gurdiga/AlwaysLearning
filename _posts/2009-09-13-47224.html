<div id="ygrps-yiv-176338481">My daughter is 5.5.<br/>
<br/>
Mid-summer, the invitation to play extended from my daughter to another<br/>
child or group of children was often met with a outright refusal or puzzled<br/>
acceptance.  (Child would say yes but then neither one would know what to<br/>
do.)  Of course, I would see the problem, and lead a simple but fun game<br/>
with all the children.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, I continued to play frequent and wild games of Hide-and-Seek,also<br/>
known as Owl and Mouse, Fox and Rabbit, or Wolf and Pigs, with me as the<br/>
predator.  I would include whatever child was at the park, if they wanted to<br/>
play, and the kids would have a rollicking time. Some of the younger kids<br/>
prefer to be a baby whatever predator and hunt with me.<br/>
<br/>
The other day, I was at the playground with my children, and my daughter<br/>
went up to a group of 12-13 year olds, asked them their names, and asked if<br/>
they wanted to play Hide and Seek.  She also gave them the instructions that<br/>
they couldn&#39;t run very fast because she was younger and wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
catch them if they did.  They agreed.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the playground again the other day, and she had eight children<br/>
ages 3-8 playing Hide and Seek. I didn&#39;t do a thing, and sat on a bench<br/>
chatting with another mom while we enjoyed the sight of our children<br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
I am reveling in her new-found social abilities and wanted to share.<br/>
