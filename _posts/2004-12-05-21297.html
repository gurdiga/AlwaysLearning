<div id="ygrps-yiv-215522276">Thanks for your help, Lisa. but that leaves us out. We live in a log cabin in the woods. Dial up connections only. :-(  Does anyone know of an active teen unschoolers message board or list where they could connect with others about gaming, rpg&#39;s, music, html, ect? <br/>
<br/>
Hey, maybe I should introduce myself! <br/>
<br/>
Hello all! <br/>
<br/>
Our family has been living and learning here in rural SC for the past 15 years. We have 4 ds ages 16, 13, 8 and 6. We&#39;ve unschooled from the start via the writings of John Holt, Grace Lewellyn, John Taylor Gatto, Sandra Dodd, and others. (shyly waving at Sandra ;-)  We just try to live the richest life we can and do what we love. We&#39;ve only been connected to the net for about 3 years now, and have flown &#39;under the radar&#39; until this year if you get my drift. (still cautious about saying that) Anyway...LOVE this list....been lurking about 6 months. My 2 teens are totally immersed in studying web design, so we have 2 computers going with 1 extra phone line between them. I jump on as I can and have narrowed my lists down to this one. It&#39;s my favorite, and I&#39;d love to add a word or two once in awhile if ya&#39;ll don&#39;t mind. :-) Still learning list etiquette, so let me know if I mess up. You have some great advice bouncing around on here. I think John Holt would be proud. (BWG)<br/>
<br/>
Well, it&#39;s a beautiful day and we all have (literally) cabin fever...so we&#39;re gonna hit the woods for a hike. Thanks for listening, and for writing!<br/>
<br/>

  Hi Margie <br/>
<br/>
  To be able to play Halo 2 online you need to buy a kit called Xbox <br/>
  Live and connect it to your broadband modem at 512KB speed. If your <br/>
  internet speed is less than this it won&#39;t work properly because it&#39;s <br/>
  very slow and freezes during the game. Hope that helps.<br/>
<br/>
  Cheers, Lisa<br/>

  &gt; We are unschoolers in SC and our teenage sons would love to join <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Margie,<br/>
<br/>
I think we met you at a S.C. Living is Learning Conference a few weeks ago.  <br/>
My daughter and your son had on the same unschooling t-shirt? Brenna is 15 and <br/>
is online alot with some of the other unschoolers she met at conferences <br/>
these past two years.  She said that she recommends the Not Back to School Camp <br/>
Wiki online site for a great place to connect with other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Also, if you e-mail me off-list I&#39;d be happy to share her e-mail address.  <br/>
She would love to talk with other unschoolers and probably has other ideas.  <br/>
There is a yahoo list called Unschooling_gamers that might be a good connection. <br/>
<br/>
Have you considered going to the Live and Learn Unschooling Conference next <br/>
year?  I&#39;m not sure where it will be but it&#39;s a great place for your kids to <br/>
connect with other unschoolers. <br/>
My kids made such good friends there and are already looking forward to next <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy you&#39;re here!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1118918363">Yes Gail, I remember you!   We had a great time at the Living is Learning Conference and will definitely be attending more of those! <br/>
Thanks for contacting me and I will email you off list.<br/>
<br/>
I guess Halo 2 online is out for us, but we also really enjoy Runescape. Our ds&#39;s want to know if anyone wants to start an unschoolers clan on there? lol<br/>
