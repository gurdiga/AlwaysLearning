<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sunday, Easter, it was sixty one degrees and beautiful here.  All the<br/>
little neighbor kids were playing outside and the Rowe clan up the street<br/>
were flying kites. It was really summer.<br/>
Monday by noon it was ten degrees and blizzarding.   By four the<br/>
Interstate was closed in a hundred and twenty mile stretch north and<br/>
south of us and everyone was wondering what happened to summer.   It was<br/>
two below Monday night.  <br/>
 <br/>
Today it&#39;s beautiful again.  <br/>
<br/>
There was a downy woodpecker drumming on the mountain ash tree this<br/>
morning.  (Haven&#39;t seen any nuthatches! )  Last night late I heard, but<br/>
didn&#39;t see, a flock of geese overhead.  I do hope they were going north!<br/>
<br/>
The goldfinches have started to arrive.  Some stayed all winter but now<br/>
we have a lot and the pine siskins are here too.  Two big robins in the<br/>
apple trees looking for last years leftovers are driving my cats crazy on<br/>
their sunny windowsills.  <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone seen the comet?   If it&#39;s clear tonight and tomorrow night<br/>
look for it near the Andromeda Galaxy on the western horizon just after<br/>
dark.  We saw it Saturday night (you need binoculars ) and it was very<br/>
faint and mysterious.  <br/>
