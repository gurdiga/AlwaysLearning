<br/>
Yes, we all live in Cali and she intends to after grad and credentialling. We <br/>
have talked about the issue of being prepared for something else though <br/>
because of the budget cuts in our state. Most of our family works within <br/>
school districts and they have been keeping her updated as much as possible. <br/>
It&#39;s funny though, they are very  supportive of my choice though. True enough <br/>
I have never mentioned &quot;Unshcooling&quot; but who cares, they see my kids for who <br/>
they are and know better than to drill them. Probably because of all the true <br/>
crap they know goes on in the Public System, I obviously couldn&#39;t do any <br/>
worse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-719592145">**This past weekend my little sister, 24, came for the weekend. She<br/>
attends San Diego State University and will graduate this December. She<br/>
will then go on to get her teaching credentials.**<br/>
<br/>
Hi, Rhonda --<br/>
<br/>
(I definitely enjoyed your posts, especially the way your kids expressed themselves.)<br/>
<br/>
On a side note, I wanted to ask:<br/>
<br/>
Does your sister intend to live in California after graduation?  Does<br/>
she understand that the numerous teachers who expect to be laid off this<br/>
spring will have preferential hiring over new graduates?  Does she have<br/>
a realistic idea of what the competition for these low paying jobs is<br/>
likely to be?<br/>
<br/>
With the major statewide budget cuts in education, almost no students<br/>
completing their credentials this year will be hired.  Next year, when<br/>
she finishes her credential, she will be competing for jobs against many<br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
Majoring in basketweaving would probably be more practical. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
