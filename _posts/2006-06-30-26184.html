<div id="ygrps-yiv-506363392">Though it has little to do with it, the song stuck in my head about  <br/>
this is just a line:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I wonder [wonder] who wrote the book of Love.... [who wrote the book  <br/>
of (drums come in) LOVE]&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Wrong &quot;wonder,&quot; really, but still...<br/>
Also, if you look &quot;wonder&quot; up on google, you&#39;ll get the site or the  <br/>
Wonderbread company.<br/>
<br/>
But what I really wanted to say was I have a new page:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wonder">http://sandradodd.com/wonder</a><br/>
<br/>
And I added a few more things to my most favorite recent page,<br/>

&quot;This might sound sort of phony or silly and unimportant - I&#39;m just <br/>
recommending that people look at what their kids ARE doing and see <br/>
if they can change their own thinking about it - see it in the best <br/>
possible way. It doesn&#39;t change what they&#39;re doing, but it changes <br/>
the &quot;tone&quot; in the home and that is so all-important it can&#39;t be <br/>
overemphasized.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think this is unschooling in a nutshell, for us. When my son runs <br/>
up to me, and says &quot;Katherine, guess what!?! I just got a [insert <br/>
name of weapon here] in my game, for only 3000 gold, and with that i <br/>
can [insert special ability here]&quot; and he&#39;s all excited and <br/>
happy....and i can be excited and happy for him, not roll my eyes <br/>
and wonder why he isnt doing something more useful...this is what <br/>
makes our relationship. And most parents don&#39;t have that. I think <br/>
most unschooling parents DO have that. Its pretty evident when i&#39;m <br/>
at a park day, and the surly angry teenager of the controlling <br/>
school-at-home mom is being not-so-nice to the littler kids, i <br/>
wonder &quot;Does this mom ever just revel in her kids passions? Does she <br/>
even SEE her kid??&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That kind of happiness, of being amazed and joyful about everyday <br/>
little things occurring around us, has made me a much happier person <br/>
in all aspects of my life. I&#39;ve been checking out the myspace pages <br/>
of some people i used to know a few years ago, and i am so suprised <br/>
at all the angst, anger, and general moodiness, depression, and <br/>
negativity everyone seems to be wallowing in. I just don&#39;t get it. <br/>
We&#39;re so freakin&#39; HAPPY here 99 percent of the time. I think people <br/>
forget that happiness is a choice, or maybe its just not cool or <br/>
interesting to be happy. I dunno. I do think that for our unschooled <br/>
kids, joy will be the default setting, and i&#39;m prepared for my son <br/>
to bypass the whole &quot;teen angst&quot; thing altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Ok, i got way off topic from the subject at hand. Then <br/>
again, &quot;everything&#39;s connected&quot; right?;o)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233696114">That reminds me of my DD the other day, when, for the first time, she <br/>
called me something other than &quot;mom&quot; or &quot;mommy.&quot; She was jumping (naked <br/>
of course) on the couch and she shouted happily,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Look at this Veej!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I about fell over, it was so surprising to hear my nickname from her. <br/>
And it occurred to me that in other households jumping on the couch <br/>
would not be allowed.<br/>
<br/>
At the playground today we met a mom with a 3.5 y.o. and an almost 2 <br/>
y.o. and a 3 month old. I said I&#39;d never seen them at the park before <br/>
and had they just moved to the area. She said &quot;We only go to the park <br/>
on Fridays *if* they&#39;re good all week.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sigh.<br/>
