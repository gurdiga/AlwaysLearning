<div id="ygrps-yiv-1915368086">==there were many times I bit my tongue or wandered off to another room because I could see (or thought I<br/>
could see) what was coming with the way he was interacting.==<br/>
<br/>
Ok, I&#39;ve been doing this a lot but it&#39;s really hard sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==I learned that he and the kids would often work things out their ways - and<br/>
it might involve more unhappiness in the moment than if I&#39;d been<br/>
engineering it but that they developed skills that made their relationships<br/>
really really good as time passed.== <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do understand that I need to let my husband establish his own relationship with the kids with their own rules and boundaries but I also feel the need to protect and save my children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==What would you want him to step in and do, really?  As your partner? <br/>
To create a more loving and peaceful environment?==<br/>
<br/>
Yes, create a more loving and peaceful environment. I would want him to say something to me like, &quot;Hey, you seem to be getting angry or frustrated. Let me handle this.&quot; Or, like was suggested, just step in and handle whatever it is gently. I do try to do that but then he thinks I&#39;m undermining him because I&#39;m not presenting that united front that parents are supposed to present to their kids. I guess I can see how he&#39;d feel that way because I usually don&#39;t agree with whatever line he&#39;s drawn in the sand. If I step in, I don&#39;t usually enforce whatever he&#39;s trying to do. I don&#39;t know how else to do that. The few times when I&#39;ve tried to just back him up because the kids look at me wondering why I&#39;m not helping them and it doesn&#39;t feel good or loving or peaceful to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>He&#39;s going to react to what he perceives, not to your intent. He&#39;s a different person. His needs are different from yours.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>How about letting him know that you don&#39;t want him to treat the kids in ways he doesn&#39;t agree with. And you don&#39;t want to do that either. So you&#39;ll let him handle the situations between him and the kids and you&#39;ll handle the situations between you and the kids.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids try to go around him, let them know calmly and sweetly that it&#39;s between him and them.<br/>
<br/>
But, again, the more you can change the atmosphere so he&#39;s not getting into such situations, the fewer he&#39;ll have to deal with and the more patience he&#39;ll have for the ones he does end up in. The more you can side track, before they get to the point where he&#39;s getting upset, the better.<br/>
<br/>
Also involve them in the process. Let them know the things that bother him and help them think ahead and do those things before he gets home.<br/>
<br/>
Are there some specific examples you can give?<br/>
