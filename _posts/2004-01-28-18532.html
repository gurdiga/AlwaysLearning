<div id="ygrps-yiv-37116767">&quot;Now I am in a quandry.  Do I supply the 13yo boy with<br/>
real weapons? &quot;<br/>
<br/>
My 10 and 14 y.o. have had real weapons ever since we started going to SCA events. I have had to remind them to keep them in a safe place, away from the reach of younger people in the house. That&#39;s the only issue that&#39;s really come up.<br/>
Jared has left a dagger out after doing some whittling (yes, I know a dagger isn&#39;t the best choice for this, but it does work:) and I had to remind him how very serious it could be for Jalen, our 3y.o.<br/>
But other than that, they&#39;ve been very responsible knife/dagger owners. Besides, they look cool!<br/>
If you go to SCA events you&#39;ll find good deals on swords, daggers and other medieval type weapons. Ebay is another good source, and malls sometimes have stores that carry weapons. They&#39;ll need you with them to make the purchase though.<br/>
