 </span></blockquote>I left that list when Sandra started this one.  It really disturbed me<br/>
that so many found comfort in listing things they thought were wrong<br/>
about their children.   I&#39;ve actually  felt a little sick over it, but<br/>
ever since I left I&#39;ve wondered if there was anyone still there who was a<br/>
REAL voice for unschooling.   I&#39;m glad to hear there are a few of you<br/>
left, fighting the fight.  I&#39;m sorry I bailed out.  Maybe if I kept a<br/>
bottle of antacid beside me I could stand it, but I&#39;m not sure.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry to be mean but there is one there who is such a nut, I was<br/>
afraid I&#39;d end up loosing it and expressing my thoughts about why her<br/>
poor children were so unhappy.   Didn&#39;t know if they&#39;d let me stay on the<br/>
list in jail.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1774443468">-No Joanna, it was my doing. Inadvertantly.<br/>
I&#39;m glad there are a few other voices so I&#39;m not alone. I questioned <br/>
a person that said something about if her child &quot;got behind&quot; she <br/>
would do something about it.<br/>
Sheesh. <br/>
When I called that view into question, against the views of <br/>
unschooling, it started the whole mud slinging battle again.<br/>
What an idiot I am to think that someone over there could be <br/>
questioned and actually give some thoughtful answers without feeling <br/>
attacked.<br/>
I can&#39;t believe the fallout from my post.<br/>
I should know better. But like you I can not stomache the thought <br/>
of &quot;do whatever works for your family&quot;<br/>
Why even have Unschooling as a concept if we&#39;re just goint to tell <br/>
everyone that line of BS.<br/>
It&#39;s not right that they&#39;ve ousted the clearest voice on the planet <br/>
about unschooling (Yes, Sandra)<br/>
and the voices that have taken over are giving lousy advice to people.<br/>

You mean the list, not the [message] board, I&#39;m guessing.  Because the <br/>
central operations, the website, seem very active and pretty productive these <br/>
days!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve never peeked back in there since I left.  It was too horrible to be <br/>
believed, but this list is nicer, and if we consider it temporary and just a <br/>
happy party, we can not get so attached to it that it&#39;s worth fighting over.  <br/>
If this group gets too difficult we can split it or abandon or <br/>
re-name/regroup after a week or two&#39;s &quot;time out.&quot;  There are lots of <br/>
solutions, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s a sad little report on what used to be the Glorious Hive of <br/>
Unschooling, and that is the AOL homeschooling area.   It used to be bigger <br/>
and better than (or as good as, but with clear, quick energy) all of <br/>
unschooling.com on a good day.  Nowadays the unschooling folders are light, <br/>
lame, and apparently peopled by few to no unschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s another example of a few jealous hot-heads running off the people who <br/>
were actually dedicated to helping other people learn about unschooling.   <br/>

before I stopped having dreams that he hadn&#39;t really died, that he&#39;d really <br/>
been hidden by the CIA or something (not a chance) and that I&#39;d see him <br/>
walking down the street.  I think that happened a lot more than it might <br/>
have because I never had any kind of funeral, never saw a body or even <br/>
ashes. (He died in England, and the ashes were scattered over there.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1318335735">You know,<br/>
This entire conversation reminds me of another conversation on a state list I am on...<br/>
<br/>
There the discussion is why people in AEP&#39;s choose to call it &#39;homeschooling&#39; when it is most certainly NOT homeschooling, but is an AEP..And how this choice in terminology can harm people in the end, especially &#39;new&#39; homeschoolers, by making them think an AEP is something it is most certainly, legally, and theoretically is NOT.<br/>
<br/>
I see this situation as the same type of an issue: Sure, there are those who utilize SOME aspects of unschooling, but do not embrace unschooling in ALL aspects..There is nothing *wrong* with that, especially if that is what the best move for the family is..However that does not mean it IS unschooling. What is wrong with saying &quot;we adapt some aspects of unschooling, and in other aspects we still utilize more conventional ideas and theories because that is what works best for us&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I dont understand this anymore than I understand those who enroll their children in AEP&#39;s, and then want to say they are homeschooling...<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I&#39;m a newbie by the way, from the &#39;other&#39; list ;)..New to homeschooling this year, 9 year old DD, and we just recently became unschoolers..<br/>

  &gt; I should know better. But like you I can not stomache the thought <br/>

  &gt; Why even have Unschooling as a concept if we&#39;re just goint to tell <br/>

What was happening on that other list was a parent saying - Jonny *needs*<br/>
a chore chart every week and he has to do two hours of math a day, other<br/>

parent in as much as it satisfied some need for control, but it doesn&#39;t<br/>
work in the context of unschooling if you believe children can pursue<br/>
their own interest and the pursuit leads to learning. <br/>

I do think it&#39;s important that people trying to &quot;get&quot; unschooling <br/>
understand that it has to do with who is making the choices, kids or <br/>
parents, and that it has to do with trusting kids to make good choices.  If <br/>
it isn&#39;t at least that, then why not just throw the word away <br/>
completely?  If a word means whatever the speaker (or writer) wants it to <br/>

education decisions are made by us (really our son) and none of his <br/>
learning happens in school.  Like &quot;real&quot; homeschoolers  have to do in many <br/>
provinces and states, we have to keep a simple record of his learning and <br/>
forward it 3 times a year.  This consists (in our case) of about a 1 page <br/>
description of books we&#39;ve read to him, &quot;educational TV shows he&#39;s watched, <br/>
and mention of a few conversations about various subjects we&#39;ve had.  I&#39;ve <br/>
heard that the school district programs are much different than that in <br/>
some places, but I&#39;ve also heard that there are lots much like ours.  Why <br/>
do we do it?  The computer, the internet access, and the cheque I just <br/>
received from the school district which will just about cover the cost of <br/>
the digital camera we just bought.<br/>

I think things like that can make a difference, and I hate bullshit.  <br/>

My bullshit detector is very sensitive and sometimes goes off loudly.<br/>

Because people come to unschooling .com and sign up for its list to learn how <br/>
to unschool, and to get support to continue to do so.<br/>

<br/>
There are differing interpretations, but they can only be expanded so far <br/>
before a person is recommending against unschooling.  The range of <br/>
unschooling definitions and practices is still within a range.<br/>
<br/>
Some of what&#39;s being recommended on AOL, for instance, is very much NOT <br/>
unschooling, so there&#39;s no reason to have it in the unschooling folder there. <br/>
 And there is reason NOT to have it there.  All unschoolers are aware of <br/>
curricular choices.  Fewer curriculum-users are aware of unschooling.<br/>

I am in NO way passing judgment on anyone for using an AEP first of all, I think they are a WONDERFUL choice for some families.<br/>
The issue is they are not a homeschooling option legally. Legally they are overseen by the public school district.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a great link that outlines the main legal differences between an AEP and homeschooling here in our state:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.washhomeschool.org/whoAltEd.html">http://www.washhomeschool.org/whoAltEd.html</a><br/>
<br/>
The issue here is when someone who is in an AEP says they are strictly homeschooling, that can be confusing for those newcomers to homeschooling who do not understand the fundamental differences, and the legal differences, of the two programs.<br/>
<br/>
I also have philosophical questions as to why in our area the public school district targets so many homeschooling families for AEPs but does not offer the AEP option/program to their own public school students, but that is another rant for another time =).<br/>
<br/>
Again I think AEPs are wonderful tools and looked into them myself, I do not look down on ANYONE for making that choice for their family.<br/>
<br/>
I just dont understand why some do not call it as it is, an AEP..There is nothing wrong with it being that!<br/>

  &gt;AEP=alternative education programs that are ran by the school districts =)<br/>
<br/>
  That&#39;s what I thought.  I guess we aren&#39;t homeschooling, even though all <br/>
  education decisions are made by us (really our son) and none of his <br/>
  learning happens in school.  Like &quot;real&quot; homeschoolers  have to do in many <br/>
  provinces and states, we have to keep a simple record of his learning and <br/>
  forward it 3 times a year.  This consists (in our case) of about a 1 page <br/>
  description of books we&#39;ve read to him, &quot;educational TV shows he&#39;s watched, <br/>
  and mention of a few conversations about various subjects we&#39;ve had.  I&#39;ve <br/>
  heard that the school district programs are much different than that in <br/>
  some places, but I&#39;ve also heard that there are lots much like ours.  Why <br/>
  do we do it?  The computer, the internet access, and the cheque I just <br/>
  received from the school district which will just about cover the cost of <br/>
  the digital camera we just bought.<br/>

  What you think of me is none of my business.<br/>
