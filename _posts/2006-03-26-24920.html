<div id="ygrps-yiv-1772866169">My daughter wanted to meet other unschoolers, but there seems to be few<br/>
in our area, so she created an unschooling penpals group.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s for everyone not just children. My daughter is running the group<br/>
and I&#39;m just there as a guide. She set the settings to private so your<br/>
email and home address&#39; will be safe.<br/>
