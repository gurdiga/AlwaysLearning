<div id="ygrps-yiv-1448912162">Does anyone know of an online support group or<br/>
supportive individual(s) parenting &quot;special needs&quot;<br/>
kids who can correspond via email?  <br/>
<br/>
Thomas has been especially challenging and exhausting<br/>
lately and we feel he is entering a new phase of his<br/>
developmental challenges.  Being an at-home mom with<br/>
him, and his not being compatible with most<br/>
group/outside activities, I rarely get a chance to<br/>
talk to other parents who understand what&#39;s involved<br/>
in raising this type of child.  Just going out with<br/>
him to the grocery store or post office can be<br/>
extremely exhausting.  I could really use the support<br/>
on occassion.<br/>
<br/>
I am asking here because, although I am perfectly<br/>
capable of doing searches myself, I would love a<br/>
recommendation to a list with an unschooling bent<br/>
which respects kids.  Preferably one that likes to<br/>
avoid drugs, meddling &quot;specialists&quot; and labeling kids.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Much as I like to avoid using labels and believe them<br/>
to be flawed concepts, they do help identify types of<br/>
medical and behavioral problems along a spectrum. <br/>
Towards the end of looking for an appropriate<br/>
recommendation, Thomas would be/is considered: ADHD,<br/>
Oppositionally Defiant, Developmentally Delayed,<br/>
Paternally drug and alcohol affected, prone to<br/>
depression with anger management issues, learning<br/>
disabled and dyslexic.  He also has a number of severe<br/>
to moderate food allergies, some anaphylactic, some<br/>
biochemically behavioral affecting.<br/>
<br/>
He is also smart as a whip, intellectually precocious,<br/>
of what might be called &quot;an artistic&quot; temperment and<br/>
sensitivity, with a passion for movies.  He wants to<br/>
direct. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance to anyone with suggestions for<br/>
groups or personal support to offer.<br/>

You might want to check out the TAGMAX list (details on<br/>
http://www.tagfam.org).  This list is primarily for gifted kids/families<br/>
who homeschool, but there are many families who have children with various<br/>
special needs.<br/>
<br/>
Parents often share recommendations for helping kids with special needs,<br/>
which can be very supportive if that&#39;s what you need... ideas.<br/>
<br/>
However, it&#39;s not a support group.  It&#39;s mostly a resource list, with some<br/>
ideas and a little bit of support.  There are lots of folks on the list who<br/>
&quot;school&quot; at home, but there are some unschoolers as well.  I find it really<br/>
helpful for getting more ideas to follow up with something my dd is already<br/>
interested in.<br/>

recommended at one point a list or board that&#39;s more active.<br/>
