<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947351679">I was at my lifeguard training tonight and I was talking to the 3 public school teachers in the class.  One teaches world history and she said the kids hate being in her class but she doesn&#39;t know how to make it any more fun for them because she has to follow her curriculum.

This doesn&#39;t really pertain to unschooling, I guess, but the quote was good and I am so glad that I learned that there is more to life than school while my kids were still young.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-127068222">This really caused me to stop and think about how schools are as much <br/>
traps for teachers as for kids, and that the institutional setting <br/>
wastes an enormous amount of passion and skill and intelligence in its <br/>
teachers as well.  <br/>
<br/>
I spent nearly 30 years of my life inside educational institutions, <br/>
both as student and as teacher (sometimes, during graduate school, both <br/>
at once) and, to be quite honest, I loved school.  Sort of.  I didn&#39;t <br/>
particularly enjoy the school-ish part of school, but I loved the fact <br/>
that I could surround myself with people, teachers and other students, <br/>
who had interests and skills and passions similar to my own, writers <br/>
and musicians and literature-lovers and scientists and mathematicians.  <br/>
Since I came from a very working class background (coal mining), where <br/>
acceptable interests were quite limited (hunting, drinking, and bar <br/>
fighting topped the list - nothing wrong with that, I guess, but not <br/>
the past time of choice for a sensitive little boy who cried easily and <br/>
read all the time and couldn&#39;t kill anything if his life depended on <br/>
it), my teachers were always my first source of connection with a world <br/>
of ideas and art that just didn&#39;t exist in my daily life.  Teachers <br/>
were my heroes, my friends. <br/>
<br/>
But even then, the teachers I admired the most were always the ones who <br/>
taught the least, in the standardized sense.  They were always the <br/>
teachers who had the most difficulty inside the system and who always <br/>
managed to connect with kids despite the institutional aspect of their <br/>
jobs, not because of it.  And right now, I&#39;m certain that most of the <br/>
teachers I loved the most, the people who helped me most, would have a <br/>
very difficult time surviving in the current school environment.<br/>
<br/>
All of my favorite teachers would be suspended, and all of my favorite <br/>
students would be expelled.  <br/>

A friend of mine who was a teacher years ago, then unschooled for a  <br/>
long time and then went back to teach first grade (while her kids  <br/>
were still being unschooled) told me she was having to use a script!!  <br/>
The curriculum was so prescribed that she had to say certain things  <br/>
exactly so, and repeat it a certain way, and she hated it so much she  <br/>
quit and became a 911 dispatcher.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>One of the things that made me quit Calvert School was the second  <br/>
grade geography teacher&#39;s manual.  It required a script, in which the  <br/>
teacher was to &quot;say to the child, We&#39;re going on a rocket into  <br/>
space!!!&quot;  It was so hokey.  I just couldn&#39;t pull it off.  Plus, you  <br/>
were supposed to withhold geography from otherwise excited and engaged  <br/>
students because it was the Friday reward subject.  After calling  <br/>
school at home quits, I let the kids play with the books, tests, and  <br/>
so on, including the inflatable globe -- it still had the Soviet Union  <br/>
on it, which was interesting to compare to the relief globe dd bought  <br/>
at Toys R Us in exchange for an Easy Bake Oven she didn&#39;t want.  The  <br/>
inflatable one made a much better volleyball, though &lt;g&gt;  (Oh, and the  <br/>
entire geography course was devoured by both dd, the &quot;official&quot; second  <br/>
grader, and ds, who must have been 5, in about an hour.)<br/>

NANCY  (I say, with my meanest generic critical voice of imagined  <br/>
older female relative):<br/>
<br/>
If you let them have all the geography they want, they&#39;re going to  <br/>
think they can have geography every day.  They&#39;re going to want  <br/>
geography for breakfast.  They&#39;ll grow up without any self control in  <br/>
the area of geography.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m beginning to think your kids might devour geography all day if  <br/>
you&#39;d let them.<br/>

Haaarumph!<br/>
