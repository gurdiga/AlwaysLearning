<div id="ygrps-yiv-1315046259">North Carolina has pretty awful homeschooling requirements, but 275 days a <br/>
year doesn&#39;t seem to be among them. They say:<br/>
<br/>
Operate the school &quot;on a regular schedule, excluding reasonable holidays and <br/>
vacations, during at least nine calendar months of the year&#39;&#39;; <br/>
<br/>
There is a lot more - but that&#39;s all I see about the amount of &quot;homeschooling <br/>
time&quot; required.<br/>
<br/>
Go the www.nhen.org and click on &quot;legal information&quot; -- then click on &quot;state <br/>
information&quot; and put your own state in. That will direct you to some of the <br/>
best places to get good information for any state.<br/>
<br/>
Kentucky, on the other hand, has good homeschooling law that treats <br/>
homeschoolers like other private schools. They say: each home school must <br/>
keep attendance records, regular scholarship reports, and school a minimum of <br/>
175 days per year (1050 hours).     <br/>
<br/>
(If anybody sees a problem with any of the legal information for their state, <br/>
please feel free to notify nhen -- this information is the result of <br/>
homeschoolers volunteering to keep it accurate and up-to-date and they can <br/>
use all the help they can get.)<br/>

Well that means they don&#39;t want you to cheat by having a longer vacation than <br/>
school kids can have.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone multiplied nine months by 30, forgetting holidays and weekends.<br/>
<br/>
All the time you see things in state laws that are clearly there just to <br/>
avoid the &quot;that&#39;s not FAYer&quot; whine.&quot;  So people have to test (even though <br/>
they can chuck the results), and they &quot;have to take attendance.&quot;  <br/>
