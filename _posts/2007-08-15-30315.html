<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788625868">Hey, list-people...<br/>
I just got something cool by e-mail from Schuyler and because I have  <br/>
in-laws (four adults) upstairs asleep and Holly&#39;s going to babysit  <br/>
today elsewhere, and I have to leave for a conference tomorrow, I  <br/>
don&#39;t even have time to read the article twice, but I DID read it  <br/>
once, and this could be the thing some people really, really need to  <br/>
share with their own friend and relatives.  It could be the &quot;Shush-up/ <br/>
back-off&quot; talisman of our dreams.<br/>
==============================<br/>
dependence nurtures independence<br/>
  I know you know this. I know it is known amongst unschoolers. But,  <br/>
I thought you might be interested in a study that demonstrates that  <br/>
supportive, nurturing relationships produce more independent and  <br/>
confident partners.<br/>

A researcher at Carnegie-Mellon University has shown that attachment  <br/>
theory (which we all refer to as &quot;attachment parenting&quot;) works with  <br/>
married couples too.  Things we&#39;ve been discussing among unschoolers  <br/>
for years has research now!  How cool.   Part of my purpose in  <br/>
posting this here now is so I can find it again more easily when my  <br/>
world finally settles from this upcoming conference and Kirby&#39;s move  <br/>
to Austin (he&#39;s going to Sacramento with me; we get back Monday  <br/>
afternoon; he leaves town Wednesday morning).<br/>

Those audio links might work from here, or you might need to go to  <br/>

By Mark Roth, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette<br/>
<br/>
Brooke Feeney has discovered that the same thing that works for  <br/>
crying babies also works for adult couples and for parents and their  <br/>
teenage children.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Listen in<br/>
<br/>
￼Carnegie Mellon relationship researcher Brooke Feeney says parents&#39;  <br/>
emotional support of children is more important than giving them things.<br/>
￼Ms. Feeney explains why people&#39;s behavioral patterns are hard to  <br/>
change.<br/>
￼Ms. Feeney talks about why people who avoid emotional involvement  <br/>
often pair with those who are anxious about relationships.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-938374907">One way of looking at this is in terms of the concept of &#39;cognitive <br/>
dissonance&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Cognitive dissonance is a psychological phenomenon first identified <br/>
by a Leon Festinger in the 1950s. It&#39;s a deep sense of discomfort <br/>
that occurs when what we believe to be true is challenged by <br/>
contradictory evidence.<br/>
<br/>
A child raised in the experience of having his or her needs readily <br/>
and willingly met (even when that might be regarded by the majority <br/>
as excessive dependence) will perceive the satisfaction of their <br/>
needs to be &#39;normal&#39;. When that child as an adult finds him or her <br/>
self in a situation where their needs are not being met, there will <br/>
be a cognitive dissonance between how things are and how they &#39;should <br/>
be&#39;. This person will consequently be SELF-motivated from an <br/>
unconscious level to return their conditions to &#39;normal&#39; and will <br/>
apply themselves to changing the situation accordingly.<br/>
<br/>
A child raised in the experience of having his or her needs denied <br/>
will perceive unsatisfied needs to be &#39;normal&#39;. When the child as an <br/>
adult finds him or her self in a situation where their needs are not <br/>
being met, there will be NO cognitive dissonance between how things <br/>
are and how they &#39;should be&#39;. This person will consequently NOT be <br/>
motivated to return their conditions to &#39;normal&#39; - because they <br/>
already ARE &#39;normal&#39;. It&#39;s &#39;just the way things are&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
So, strange as it may seem to those who confuse parenting with child <br/>
management, the more you give children what they want, the more <br/>
capable they become at getting what they want in the world at large; <br/>
the less you give children what they want, the LESS capable they <br/>
become at getting what they want in the world at large.<br/>
<br/>
But, as Deepak Chopra says, &quot;The possibility of stepping into a <br/>
higher plane is quite real for everyone. It requires no force or <br/>
effort or sacrifice. It involves little more than changing our ideas <br/>
about what is normal.&quot; <br/>
