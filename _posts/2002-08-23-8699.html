<br/>
Today we only planned taking my mother in law to the dentist in another<br/>
town.  <br/>
<br/>
What we didn&#39;t plan was the stray puppy who bounced into the yard and<br/>
devoured the flowers on the front step, broke two flower pots and ate the<br/>
cactus.  <br/>
We didn&#39;t plan the trip to the sheriffs office to place said puppy under<br/>
arrest until his person could be located. (we checked later, the puppy<br/>
went home, ma&#39;am)  We didn&#39;t plan the wild and wiggly Pug dog at the<br/>
dentists office who took Dylan&#39;s Godzilla toy and zoomed away.  (The Pug<br/>
was Gifted and Talented)  We didn&#39;t plan to watch the big fire that broke<br/>
out in a shop on Park ave. in Anaconda, Montana. <br/>
We didn&#39;t plan to see a turtle in the road, or to stop the car and<br/>
attempt a rescue and nearly get run over in the process. (folks around<br/>
here apparently don&#39;t slow down for turtles)   We didn&#39;t plan to go bird<br/>
watching until tomorrow but we saw four Sandhill cranes and three Snow<br/>
geese.<br/>
Dylan said it was a cool day. <br/>
We will be accelerating out to the water fowl habitat in the morning.   <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; here apparently don&#39;t slow down for turtles)  <br/>

run over armadillos, too. Another accelerating<br/>
phenomena.<br/>
<br/>
There is a gopher (land turtle) that lives in a sand<br/>
bank and the end of our <br/>
driveway, just at the access road...he has a daily<br/>
route he takes across both dirt roads.....he (?) seems<br/>
to recognize our truck, as Brer <br/>
Terrypin runs (he runs with his snout stretched way up<br/>
high and his funny legs stuck way out) to greet Roy<br/>
and me.  No matter what time of day we go by, we see<br/>
him. If on foot, we usually only see his tracks. If in<br/>
the truck we stop to chat with Brer Terrypin. I sowed<br/>
some wildflower seeds in his path....he and the birds<br/>
ate them all.<br/>

Critters are so amazing.  We found a pigeon with a broken wing and<br/>
wrapped it up.  The bandage came off yesterday and she&#39;s been exercising<br/>
it and it looks good.  We&#39;ll let her go in a few days.  She seems to know<br/>
we won&#39;t hurt her, she&#39;s quite friendly with Dylan and doesn&#39;t pinch at<br/>
all.   That might be the difference between males and females.  The male<br/>
we have is very bossy and pinchy and really believes he should be the<br/>
only thing on the planet.  <br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve been watching the little house finches try to get the hummingbird<br/>
food.  That&#39;s a silly business.  <br/>
<br/>
We only get painted turtles in our area and it&#39;s lovely and rare to see<br/>
one.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s nice of you to look out for Brer Terrypin.  = )<br/>
