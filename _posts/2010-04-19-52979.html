<div id="ygrps-yiv-2136303073">Did anyone see the segment about unschooling on Good Morning America this morning?  My mom saw me reading Sandra&#39;s &quot;big book&quot; yesterday and called me to tell me it would be on.  It was an ok segment, but trying to distill a life of learning into a few minutes and through a very school minded lens is pretty difficult, so needless to say there was so much left out, but they stopped short of making unschooling families look completely nutty.  Well, just thought it was interesting that it was on since I am new to this group and determining if unschooling is right for our family. What did anyone else think?<br/>

That reporter was pretty hard hitting with the kids. I didn&#39;t like her approach with them at all. I imagine that the parents had no idea she&#39;d be so aggressive with her questioning. Quite unfair to grill them like that.<br/>
<br/>
Very &quot;mainstream&quot; perspective presented and not well-researched at all. They make it sound like unschooling is some &quot;new-fangled&quot; idea. Obviously, they didn&#39;t look up John Holt. Or much of anything else.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one brave family. I just don&#39;t know if there is any win-win possible in pieces like this when the presenters are so unwilling to put aside their own bias.<br/>

DOH!  I wish your mom had called me!<br/>
I was ready to see it Wednesday, and then Friday I only watched the  <br/>
last half hour of the show, and thought I had missed it, and now I  <br/>
really have missed it.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;ll have it on a website, though I bet only Americans could  <br/>
see it there.<br/>

I&#39;m glad to hear  &quot;they stopped short of making unschooling families  <br/>

I thought it was limited by time and approach.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is a huge pie, and to me the segment showed only a sliver.  What bothers me about it is that viewers may wholly judge unschooling on that sliver and consider themselves to have a good understanding of what it is based upon what they saw (or didn&#39;t see).<br/>

The part I found mostly frustrating, was when the reporter was asking the kids leading questions without really giving them much of a chance to respond.  Typical adult dismissal of teenagers.  I wonder how often they interview or even talk to teenagers.  You could see the bright openness in those kids&#39; eyes.  It&#39;s that same bright openness that I see in all unschooled kids that I don&#39;t see in schooled kids much.<br/>

The one thing that struck me was right at the beginning, where she was describing the well meaning parents. She said that there is a huge gap between the utopian and the reality. As though that wasn&#39;t the case for school. I mean I knew kids who ended their lives in part because of the pressure of school.

I have expectations for Simon and Linnaea but they aren&#39;t grandiose, they aren&#39;t outside of who they are now. It isn&#39;t that I have low expectations, it is more that I&#39;ve stopped looking toward the future to define my now with them. <br/>

<br/>
I was thinking the exact same thing!  Isn&#39;t the whole idea of PE, to help kids be physically fit?  Jeez, they showed the kids doing boffer fights together.  Most of Chamille&#39;s friends go to school.  The boys are skate boarders who love to parkour, neither of which are in any way done in PE classes.  They are very physically adept and physically fit kids, but it has nothing to do with PE classes which they all admittedly dislike.  One of them dislikes it primarily because he&#39;s forced to dress and undress in public, and routinely gets marked down for refusing to do so.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille&#39;s experience with sports has been taking tennis classes and martial arts, riding bikes, skate boarding, swimming, and when she was a lot younger, gymnastics and dance.  The only things out of that list that she would&#39;ve maybe done in school would be tennis or swimming, assuming the school she attended had a pool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506332400">I thought the reporter was brusque even with the parents who looked very<br/>
much on top of things-- reasonable, intelligent, and cogent. The reporter<br/>
seemed rather uninformed but that&#39;s ok because she&#39;s supposedly on an<br/>
inquiry about just what is this thing called unschooling. She started out<br/>
with her conclusion first. Nice already (sarcasm). So going in, everyone can<br/>
be on notice that the reporter is biased against unschooling. I thought the<br/>
way she questioned the teens and the things she asked them about were<br/>
obviously intended to make them look goofy ... which they didn&#39;t. They were<br/>
respectful to a reporter who was being silly.<br/>
<br/>
It was definitely goofy that the reporter showed the questions about sports<br/>
in conjunction with footage of teens who were outside actively playing with<br/>
bolsters and having a relaxed good time, not only with each other but with<br/>
their mom. They look happy!  Bite that, lady. How many teens in school (who<br/>
mostly worry about bustin&#39; their cool) would unabashedly play like that? I<br/>
totally wouldn&#39;t have been caught dead on film playing in the yard with my<br/>
parents as a teen in school. No way.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s my perspective as an unschooling parent who went to school as a kid.<br/>

&gt; (there&#39;s an ad at the beginning)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; 20 years ago the same types of segments played about homeschooling<br/>
&gt; with the same fear and doubt responses. Now they need to report on<br/>
&gt; unschooling to unsettle the audience in the same way ;-) I doubt there<br/>
&gt; was enough in the segment to intrigue parents and draw them to<br/>
&gt; investigating unschooling, but at least a lot more people know about<br/>
&gt; and have a start to a foundation if they encounter unschoolers out in<br/>
&gt; the wild.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-113021201">I&#39;m sure that those families who were featured are wonderful folks and great unschoolers, and I don&#39;t want to hurt anyone&#39;s feelings, but I thought the Good Morning America piece was a train wreck.<br/>
<br/>
It seemed to me that the families were not prepared to speak to their audience. (Good Morning America viewers.) Regardless of how nice the reporter was to them during the interview, GMA is going to have a bias, and of course that bias is going to be against anything as radical as unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think the reporter was hard on the teens, I thought she lobbed them a few softballs.  <br/>
<br/>
I am quite sure that the families featured had better moments than the ones GMA chose to air.  However, if a family is going to do an interview like that, they have to make sure that they have only (or at least mostly) good moments for the TV guys to pick from.<br/>
<br/>
I would urge any family who is considering doing something like this to prepare in a big way.  Brainstorm questions that you think the journalist might ask.  Come up with awesome answers and practice saying them so they flow easily.  Remember who your audience is. Craft your responses accordingly.  You don&#39;t have to answer stupid questions, turn the question into something that plays to your strengths. Watch the Sunday morning talk shows, the guests do that all the time.  &quot;That&#39;s a good point, George, but what&#39;s really important is.....&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Get some help from someone who is media savvy if you have the opportunity.  <br/>
<br/>
After watching the segment by myself, I watched it with my kids and we discussed what they might say if they were asked such questions.  It&#39;s a good skill to have just for the relatives, even if those relatives aren&#39;t hostile.  I want my children and my husband and I to be able to explain what we do to the clueless in an articulate way. <br/>
<br/>
What we&#39;re doing is radical and most people think it&#39;s ridiculous.  Although we can usually avoid hostile people, it&#39;s a good idea to at least have an &quot;elevator&quot; answer at the ready.<br/>

&gt; Did anyone see the segment about unschooling on Good Morning America this morning?  My mom saw me reading Sandra&#39;s &quot;big book&quot; yesterday and called me to tell me it would be on.  It was an ok segment, but trying to distill a life of learning into a few minutes and through a very school minded lens is pretty difficult, so needless to say there was so much left out, but they stopped short of making unschooling families look completely nutty.  Well, just thought it was interesting that it was on since I am new to this group and determining if unschooling is right for our family. What did anyone else think?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-118952525">-=-The part I found mostly frustrating, was when the reporter was  <br/>
asking the kids leading questions without really giving them much of a  <br/>
chance to respond. Typical adult dismissal of teenagers. I wonder how  <br/>
often they interview or even talk to teenagers. You could see the  <br/>
bright openness in those kids&#39; eyes. It&#39;s that same bright openness  <br/>
that I see in all unschooled kids that I don&#39;t see in schooled kids  <br/>
much.-=-<br/>

Yes.  And when the teenaged boy was talking to her she said with some  <br/>
real derision, &quot;But you were seven!  What do you know!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been many years since he was seven.<br/>
It&#39;s been many years since she was seven, but he remembers and his  <br/>
parents cared what he thought, when she was seven.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m assuming the reporter&#39;s parents gave her the &quot;What do YOU know&quot;?  <br/>
treatment, and that if she has children now, she&#39;s doing that to them.<br/>
<br/>
My kids knew a ton of stuff at seven.  I still remember being seven,  <br/>
and I knew things the teachers didn&#39;t know, even about what was going  <br/>
on in the classroom and what could be done better.  I knew, at seven,  <br/>
how they had taught reading at the school where I was in first grade,  <br/>
in Texas.   And I learned phonics in 2nd grade in New Mexico. I could  <br/>
have discussed the differences even then.<br/>

<br/>
NO SHIT, and nowhere is there so huge a gap as in school.  School  <br/>
doesn&#39;t even HAVE a utopian ideal.  They know right now that for kids  <br/>
who aren&#39;t even born yet, they&#39;re going to give failing marks to some  <br/>
percentage of them, and brand most kids &quot;average.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It certainly did at our school.<br/>
We were &quot;exposed&quot; by force to tetherball in elementary, and dodgeball  <br/>
and kickball.  Some days we were made to play on the swings, or the  <br/>
slide.   This was accomplished by assigning different areas in the  <br/>
playground to different classes, so everyone could be made to play  <br/>
those competitive ball games, in rotation.  There were two recesses,  <br/>
but that year one became &quot;PE&quot; because of President Kennedy&#39;s exercise  <br/>
program, so Americans could beat the Soviets to the moon.   So we lost  <br/>
a recess.  It still looked like a recess, but it involved pressure to  <br/>
perform.  I&#39;m sure the teachers were even more bummed than we were.<br/>
<br/>
In Jr. High PE I was exposed by force to volleyball, girl&#39;s basketball  <br/>
(not quite real basketball), gymnastics, folk dance (the only part I  <br/>
didn&#39;t hate) and interpretive dance.<br/>
<br/>
I lived, but I still have resentment 40 years later, it seems. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

***That&#39;s a big gap between the utopian and the reality. ***<br/>
<br/>
I know a couple of kids in college right now who are there just to keep their parents off their case.  They are there just to look busy and to be busy so that they don&#39;t have to answer questions about their future.  I know they&#39;re getting some interesting stuff out of their college experience but they are not there in pursuit of their life&#39;s joy.   I keep thinking how much better it would have been for their parents to spend that college money in pursuit of what their kids really wanted.  The trouble is, the kids didn&#39;t really have a chance to figure that out.  Maybe it&#39;s still looking utopian from the parents point of view, but not so much from where the kids are. <br/>
<br/>
I liked how the daughter in the GMA interview looked right at the camera when she closed the door to her (I presume) bedroom and said, &quot;You guys can&#39;t go in there.&quot;  &lt;g&gt;  I have friends in their forties and fifties who would be apologizing and blushing and making excuses over an untidy room (in their own house!) and this young woman just said no.&lt;g&gt;     Too bad they used it to insinuate these kids might not be learning how to look after themselves. <br/>
<br/>
Which is my segue into my little morning news bit.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
When we heard the shuttle would be descending over Montana we thought we&#39;d like to go see if we could spot it.   I was going to just stay up all night but around one in the morning I flaked out and went to bed.  We planned to leave the house a little after five to drive up the hill and find a good spot to watch.  I set my clock to get up early enough to take care of the critters before we left because we thought we might go out to breakfast after.  Dylan stayed up.   When I got up he had already let the dog out and in again, had fed him, had changed his water, watered the bird and fed the cats and cleaned out the litter pans.     <br/>
<br/>
A kid who never had chores, who could watch TV and eat what he wanted, the kind of kid some of the thoughtful readers at the Good Morning America website predicted would turn out  &quot;a loser,&quot; who was awake in a house with three TV&#39;s, cable, Netflix movies, two computers, a game system, a telephone, beer and CUPCAKES forgodssake, was up at four thirty in the morning reading &quot;The Filmmaker&#39;s Handbook,&quot;  eating organic salad.  <br/>
<br/>
What a loser! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We did drive up the hill, set up the telescope, swill hot chocolate, gaze at stars, hang out, talk, finally give up and go to breakfast.  Shuttle landing delayed. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Being married to someone who is/was interviewed rather frequently, I  <br/>
agree that preparation is key. Assessing the intent of the interviewer  <br/>
or show makes a huge difference in how one might prepare. If I am  <br/>
being interviewed for, say, Home Education Magazine, the interviewer  <br/>
comes from a totally different perspective (encouraging, curious) than  <br/>
one from GMA or the Today show, where they might like to make a fool  <br/>
of me for not buying into their worldview. They&#39;ll do it with smiles  <br/>
and even polite inquiry, but you can see it in their eyes when they&#39;re  <br/>
going in for the juicy sound bite that will tip the scales in the  <br/>
&quot;wacko&quot; direction.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, reporters will chat with you in advance and go over their  <br/>
questions so you feel comfortable. Then, they ask you something  <br/>
completely out of left field, that they didn&#39;t happen to mention in  <br/>
the pre-interview interview.  We got caught a few times in that until  <br/>
we wised up. It was painful, thinking that interviewers really wanted  <br/>
to know what your thoughts were, then finding out they could have  <br/>
cared less. They were getting a story, the more controversial the  <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
Having been involved in media at both ends (as a reporter and an  <br/>
interviewee), I&#39;ve learned that there are some things you can do to  <br/>
hold your own. Ross makes a list of 3 to 5 &quot;messages&quot;  he practices to  <br/>
get across. He&#39;s learned how to turn the conversation back to what  <br/>
&quot;he&quot; wants to say. It might be manipulation in a way, but that&#39;s what  <br/>
the journalist is doing, too. Make it a lively manipulation! It can  <br/>
lead to further discussion, less agenda and even a relationship.<br/>
