<div id="ygrps-yiv-1609013172">&lt;&lt;And so I tell him that. And I explain that I just don&#39;t have money to buy <br/>
everything in the store.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I try to &#39;solutionize&#39; things as they come up - (I know, &#39;solutionize&#39; is <br/>
not a real word but it works for me).  We had this similar situation coming <br/>
up quite often several years ago.  What I determined the problem to be was <br/>
that I was the one who had all the power with all the money when we went to <br/>
the store.  I also had all the rights to make the decision of the &#39;value&#39; of <br/>
the item she wanted - soooo not a good place to be in when this Mama is <br/>
about the relationship.<br/>
<br/>
The solution we came up with was to figure out a monthly portion of the <br/>
budget for Sorscha (aka now going as Tail&#39;s) - in our case it&#39;s $100.00.  At <br/>
first she would spend the entire amount in the first few days, but as time <br/>
as gone by she has figured out how to budget herself.  I&#39;ve had people say <br/>
to me, &quot;$100.00!!! You&#39;re crazy.&quot;  However, what I determined was that <br/>
Tail&#39;s was spending more like $200.00 to $300.00 because I was trying to <br/>
accommodate her wishes by saying, &quot;yes&quot; and I was also trying to divert <br/>
disagreements, etc.  I&#39;m not posting this to say you should give your kiddo <br/>
$100.00 bucks, but it would be nice to figure out an amount that works for <br/>
your family&#39;s budget.  Both Tail&#39;s and I are much happier now.  Trips to the <br/>
store are peaceful and our relationship doesn&#39;t revolve that particular <br/>
power issue.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have any of the &#39;I want that&#39; that happens in the subtle &#39;please, <br/>
please, please because I really know you won&#39;t buy it for me&#39; way, but we <br/>
now have dialogue about each of our monies.  For instance, I&#39;ll say, &quot;Ohhhh, <br/>
I want a Starbuck&#39;s coffee but I don&#39;t want to spend my money on it.&quot; <br/>
Speaking of &#39;our monies&#39;, I also have a budget that negates any money power <br/>
struggles between Dave & I.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
