<div id="ygrps-yiv-982959104">**..wondering what would be a perfect mother&#39;s day thing for me and I thought:<br/>
<br/>
I would like to magically have my toddlers back for one day.**<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yeah. My babies, Pat and Sarah, had their tenth birthday today! Their <br/>
older sister made them extra special HUGE (14&quot; x 22&quot;) cards, with pictures <br/>
inside she&#39;s taken of them from the time they were infants to now. Mondo <br/>
cuteness. &lt;g&gt; I really like these people but man I sometimes really miss <br/>
those itty bitty ones that used to live here.<br/>
<br/>
It just all goes so fast. Well, except for those first few months which went <br/>
on and on and on and on.... &lt;g&gt;<br/>
