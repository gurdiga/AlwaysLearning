Subject: Chores<br/>
<br/>
I just finished reading Joyce&#39;s post.  Well-said Joyce!  I am usually a<br/>
lurker but just felt like sharing today.<br/>
<br/>
I have really evolved with this chore thing.  As a child, my whole life<br/>
was<br/>
a &quot;have to&quot;.  If I didn&#39;t do x and x then I was restricted or told what<br/>
a<br/>
bad person I was in so many terms.  I never had chores per say for our<br/>
girls<br/>
until we started homeschooling.  I was the one who ordered the &quot;best<br/>
curriculum&quot; and set up a chore chart.  (UGH, makes me cringe just<br/>
telling<br/>
ya&#39;ll about this!)  Once our girls got to the age of 4 or so we always<br/>
gave<br/>
them some sort of allowance so they could have money of their own and<br/>
make<br/>
purchases or save.  When we pulled our girls out of school the chore<br/>
chart<br/>
became their way of making money.  No allowance just paid for the chores<br/>
they did.  The rule was dh and I would pay for needs and the girls paid<br/>
for<br/>
wants.   Shortly after we began homeschooling we had to move.  We went<br/>
through about a year of living with our parents.  It was during that<br/>
time I<br/>
found unschooling.  And that is when the paradigm shift started.<br/>
Luckily my<br/>
dh and I were on the same page from the beginning.  Of course the worst<br/>
place to start unschooling is when you are living with parents whom<br/>
are/were<br/>
schoolteachers. Both of our moms have been in the school system for<br/>
years.<br/>
My mom taught 35 years.  My dh and I stayed strong and kept reading and<br/>
growing.  However, during the transition we started just giving our<br/>
girls an<br/>
allowance again.  Once we moved into our new home and got settled I had<br/>
been<br/>
reading and growing enough to realize I did not want to &quot;make&quot; my girls<br/>
do<br/>
anything.  I must admit I would get really frustrated at times going<br/>
behind<br/>
them picking up or cleaning the kitchen.  But I tried really hard not to<br/>
say<br/>
anything. (I failed a few times)  I guess the old records I grew up with<br/>
are<br/>
still there and I have to keep them at bay so they don&#39;t jump on the<br/>
turntable and start playing.  Both our girls really love to save and to<br/>
work<br/>
towards a goal if they have something they really want.  So one day my<br/>
oldest asked me what they could do to earn money in addition to their<br/>
allowance!  So here&#39;s what we do now...Certain items around the house<br/>
are<br/>
worth .50 like cleaning the cat box, unloading the dishwasher, folding<br/>
clothes, emptying trash, etc. Then depending on things they pick up on<br/>
themselves they get more.  For example, yesterday I came home and my<br/>
almost<br/>
13yo had vacuumed part of the house, cleaned windows and mirrors, and<br/>
something else I can&#39;t remember.  We talked about a fair wage and came<br/>
up<br/>
with $6.00.  Ended up I owed her $5.50 already so she asked for $6.50 to<br/>
make the total even!  Got to love it :) Occasionally the girls will<br/>
argue<br/>
over who called the dishwasher or a load of clothes.  They are earning<br/>
pretty good money I must say.  Tomorrow our family is running a<br/>
concession<br/>
stand at a horse show and the girls want to help so we will pay them.<br/>
This<br/>
whole thing has turned into a great way for them to earn money and<br/>
purchase<br/>
those &quot;wants&quot;.  They both have been setting some money aside to open a<br/>
savings account.  It has opened the door for some great discussion<br/>
surrounding investments, purchases, etc.  I don&#39;t tell them not to buy<br/>
something but will sometimes help them think through it.  Sometimes they<br/>
buy<br/>
anyway and later wished they hadn&#39;t, but that&#39;s life.  We have all done<br/>
some<br/>
things like that.  It is just another opportunity to learn.  I suggested<br/>
they keep a journal/log of their income and expenditures.  They<br/>
sometimes<br/>
would wonder why they didn&#39;t have as much money as they thought.  So<br/>
both of<br/>
them keep a list of income and how they got it and on the other side<br/>
they<br/>
keep a running log of what they spend and where they spent it.  My<br/>
almost<br/>
10yo went on a spending spree one day and spent $43.87.  So she decided<br/>
to<br/>
not spend anything else until she had replaced that amount.  She worked<br/>
hard<br/>
and it didn&#39;t take her long before she earned it back.  But in the<br/>
process<br/>
of doing this she got a separate piece of paper and at the top put<br/>
$43.87<br/>
and every time she earned money she would subtract it from the $43.87<br/>
until<br/>
the total came to zero.  And people wonder how we do math!  There are<br/>
some<br/>
adults that couldn&#39;t keep up with money management the way my girls can.<br/>
<br/>
The plus for me is I have a lot of help around the house now and<br/>
everybody<br/>
is still smiling! :)  Maybe this will help someone else or maybe some of<br/>
you<br/>
have other thoughts that might make this better.....Looking forward to<br/>
more<br/>
discussion....<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What can be a problem is that they will be learning to do just the minimum <br/>
required to get the money, rather than working until they&#39;re happy with the <br/>
results for their own sake.   <br/>
<br/>
While it&#39;s a better choice than forcing them to do a list of chores they <br/>
didn&#39;t choose, it might not be as good a choice in the longrun as just letting <br/>
them have money to spend and considering work around the house to be a gift of <br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
It depends what your longrange goals are and what principles and priorities <br/>
you&#39;re working under.   <br/>
