&lt;&lt; &lt;&lt; and then I feel<br/>
 queasy and fluttery for hours-to-days afterward. &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think I handle most medical stuff fairly well, not great, but ok.<br/>
But a couple years ago, a lady got hit by a car up the street from us. We <br/>
were driving by, in the dark and rain and of course I had to stop since I&#39;m <br/>
CPR certified.<br/>
She still had a pulse.<br/>
Bleeding out the side of her nose and mouth (NOT a good sign) and I put a <br/>
blanket on her and then saw the police coming and got out of the way.<br/>
I was all shook up once we left.<br/>
The image of her laying on that cold, wet street stayed with me for many <br/>
weeks.<br/>
The first couple of nights it was awful.<br/>
<br/>
I never did find out what happened to her. <br/>
I didn&#39;t have the heart to call the hospital and hear that she had died, <br/>
didn&#39;t want to know for sure. <br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>
