... When the controls on anything are released, the reaction can often be a dramatic grab for what was <br/>
controlled to fill up on it (TV, candy, freedom). ...<br/>
<br/>
Is there a way to recover when control has been released too quickly.  By recover I mean get to a situation where the child is not reacting to something but acting freely.  Is time the only answer?  Can a parent help? <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
