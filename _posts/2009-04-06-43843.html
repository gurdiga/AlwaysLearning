<div id="ygrps-yiv-281716232">Hi Pam and Sandra, everyone.  I think I&#39;m unschooling!  :)<br/>
<br/>
Each of the children wanted a raised vegetable bed of their own in the yard,<br/>
so we let them each build their own (as far as they were able, depending on<br/>
their ages), and they each picked out a color to paint there box.  I have<br/>
been reading John Holt&#39;s Teach Your Own book, and realized through that (and<br/>
this list) that I&#39;ve been &quot;directing&quot; the children too much.  I decided to<br/>
bite my tongue and just watch.  I didn&#39;t realize how difficult this would be<br/>
for me!<br/>
<br/>
George (my 5 year old) had a blast painting his box bright blue.  He set the<br/>
paint can down on the grass kind of far away from his garden box.  He&#39;d dip<br/>
the brush in the paint, then carry it all the way over to the box, dripping<br/>
paint the whole way, then slosh a little on (not much paint left on the<br/>
brush by this time), and did that over and over.  I wanted so bad to suggest<br/>
he take the can over to where the box was and he wouldn&#39;t waste as much<br/>
paint.  But he was having so much fun this way!  He was really enjoying<br/>
watching the patterns he was making on the grass while he carried the brush<br/>
over to the box.  Then on his own he moved the paint can closer eventually.<br/>
When he was done, he left the paint can open.  I wanted to show him that he<br/>
needed to put the top back on, clean it up, and make everything nice and<br/>
tidy.  But I refrained.  In the meantime, he was intently watching Michael<br/>
(his 7 year old brother).  He saw Michael carefully clean up his area (It&#39;s<br/>
Michael&#39;s personality to be orderly and he has always paid attention to<br/>
detail).  He saw Michael putting his paint lid on and looking around for<br/>
something to bang it shut with.  Then George did the same thing, very<br/>
carefully, on his own.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this doesn&#39;t sound like much, but what a revelation to me!  And how<br/>
refreshing and calming for me to not feel like I&#39;ve got to &quot;teach&quot; them how<br/>
to do everything.  They just know.  And if they don&#39;t know, who cares?!<br/>
They have their own ways of doing things, and it doesn&#39;t have to be like my<br/>
way.  A lot of times their ways are better!<br/>
<br/>
After the garden boxes, the little boys decided it was time to give the<br/>
chicken coop a fresh coat of paint.  What a blast!  They ran to the chicken<br/>
house and glopped white paint all over it, and managed to paint a few other<br/>
things on the way!  We have some beautifully painted big rocks and some nice<br/>
artwork on a tree now for memories.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re talking about what vegetables, flowers or herbs they want to plant<br/>
in their boxes.  Again, it&#39;s difficult for me to let them choose on their<br/>
own.  The test will come when they&#39;re planting them, IF they decide to, and<br/>
me not directing them unless they ask for help.  You know, another side<br/>
benefit is that the little one, George, is quickly learning how to ask for<br/>
help if he wants it.<br/>
<br/>
It is also beautiful to see them expressing their little personalities,<br/>
likes and dislikes.  In the setting we were in before, as I shared in one of<br/>
my first posts, it was very controlling, and I felt the children repressed<br/>
their individuality while attending the little &quot;Amish&quot; school there.<br/>
They&#39;re once again blossoming and I feel like doing the Snoopy dance, with<br/>
my arms outstretched, my head up, and spinning around.  It&#39;s just delightful<br/>
to discover with them and to let them be free!<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a quote from the John Holt book that stuck with me and is so true.<br/>
I can&#39;t seem to find it in the book right now, but the idea is this,<br/>
&quot;Intelligence is not measured by how much we know how to do, it&#39;s how we<br/>
behave when we don&#39;t know what to do.&quot;  (I&#39;m paraphrashing, as I&#39;m sure he<br/>
says it much clearer.  Isn&#39;t that a great one? That I may I apply that to<br/>
myself and in the way I interact with the children, is my desire.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m enjoying this list, and gleaning a lot from the posts and links to<br/>
articles. I&#39;m amazed at how far off we strayed from our natural learning way<br/>
of life th past couple of years, and am so grateful to be getting back on<br/>
the right track for our family.  Pam and Sandra, I appreciate you both.  :)<br/>
Blessings on your day today, Jimi Ann<br/>

<br/>
This is very cool!!<br/>
<br/>
If they had run off to find someone to show their boxes to, would you  <br/>
have just put the paint lids on for them while they were gone?  That&#39;s  <br/>
probably what I would&#39;ve done.  How sweet that they did it without  <br/>
&quot;being told to,&quot; though!<br/>
<br/>
-=-They have their own ways of doing things, and it doesn&#39;t have to be  <br/>
like my<br/>
way. A lot of times their ways are better!-=-<br/>
<br/>
I learned from Marty or Holly (maybe they both were doing it) just a  <br/>
year or two ago that (shocking, I know...) one can brush teeth and  <br/>
rinse with warm water. It doesn&#39;t have to be freezing cold tap water  <br/>
that can hurt.   So they were brushing longer and more comfortably for  <br/>
years because they were using warm water!<br/>
<br/>
-=-They&#39;re talking about what vegetables, flowers or herbs they want  <br/>

<br/>
It might be nice to get some bedding plants so they don&#39;t have to wait  <br/>
for weeks to see little plants come up (and maybe be eaten by bugs or  <br/>
birds or snails or what have you).  Some seeds, some plants...   I  <br/>
have tomato seeds in peat pots and I baby them every day, but if they  <br/>
don&#39;t come up I&#39;ll go and buy some that professionals started.   It&#39;s  <br/>
not a test.  It&#39;s cooperative world for fun.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ll ditto that!  I was going to suggest that too.  Since clearly they<br/>
were excited, they want it to be successful, so make sure that there is<br/>
something beautiful and growing in there, even if their own ventures<br/>
don&#39;t succeed from seed.  Every time we&#39;ve gone to the plant nursery<br/>
over the years, the kids always pick something to plant because they get<br/>
excited about it, just like I do.<br/>
<br/>
We still have a beautiful (even if it is really little) ground cover<br/>
garden that Chamille planted over 3 yrs ago!</div>

<br/>
The past couple of years I&#39;ve planted bird seed--sunflowers, millet,  <br/>
corn...    Just the stuff we&#39;re already feeding the birds.  Not lots  <br/>
of it, a handful here and there.  It&#39;s satisfying because the birds  <br/>
will actually make use of the seed later, and I can put the stalks in  <br/>
the compost, and where that&#39;s growing weeds don&#39;t grow.  (People who  <br/>
live where grass grows naturally might not have any idea what I&#39;m on  <br/>
about here...)<br/>
<br/>
But planting some of the birdseed you might already have on hand is  <br/>
cheaper than buying seeds.  That was part of my point. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1582792637">Yes, marigolds.  We took the heads from the marigold plants last fall after they died, from the big garden, and we planted the seeds we saved around the perimeter of my box.  We did this to detract the deer a little.  If the deer get hungry enough, of course they&#39;ll just lean over the marigolds to eat the good stuff -- but I&#39;ve heard it deters them some.  I also saved some zinnia heads from last year, and Pauline wants those for her bright purple garden box.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll purchase some plants that are already started, then do some seeds as well.  Sunflowers are a great idea!<br/>
<br/>
When my 12 year old, Peter, was younger, we had planted some potatoes.  Well, they didn&#39;t do well, and we only got about 10 with our harvest.  He was 3, and enjoyed digging up the &quot;treasures&quot; so much, that whenever he went in the house, I&#39;d run out and &quot;re-plant&quot; the potatoes so he could find more!  He did this all day and never got tired of it.  What a fond memory.  He was kind of puzzled that we only got one meal out of all those many potatoes he found!  :)  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the tips!  Jimi Ann<br/>
