that certain things will be inherited.  We forget that DNA works for us, too<br/>
;-)&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, on the same day, I read two articles in the same newspaper. <br/>
Different pages. <br/>
<br/>
The first said that extensive research shows that golden retrievers&#39; <br/>
personalities are basically genetic. That aggressive begets aggressive and submissive <br/>
begets submissive. That environmental differences can cause inherent <br/>
aggressiveness to be less or more severe, etc., etc., same with with submissive. Best <br/>
not to breed two aggressive golden retrievers to each other.<br/>
<br/>
The second article said that maybe there was a possibility that possibly it <br/>
could be that maybe in some ways the probability exists that humans *might* be <br/>
proned to possible genetic influences that, well,  there seems to be a trend <br/>
that might point to the possibility that, genetically, people who are <br/>
imprisoned for assault may contribute to the probability that their children may, but <br/>
it isn&#39;t conclusive, that the children of these prisoners are maybe more apt to <br/>
become---but that the evidence certainly isn&#39;t conclusive---but that the <br/>
possibility exists that those children might, under the right circumstances, <br/>
become prisoners too. Maybe. For assault. Maybe. <br/>
<br/>
We humans have a hard time seeing ourselves as animals! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
