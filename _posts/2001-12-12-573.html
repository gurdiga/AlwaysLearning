<div id="ygrps-yiv-1972116505">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I would love to hear about people&#39;s traditions as<br/>
we approach holidays.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have 2 celebrations!<br/>
We have a Solstice celebration that goes like this: We<br/>
go in the morning to pick a tree, bring it home and<br/>
decorate it. Then we make special snacks for the local<br/>
beasties and hang them on the trees around our house<br/>
(this takes a while because we have a LOT of trees<br/>
here in the Sierra foothills). Then we have a &#39;sun<br/>
honoring&#39; meal (lots of sun coloured and shaped food)<br/>
with a big &#39;sun candle&#39; in the middle of the table.<br/>
Then we open our presents to each other (dd, myself<br/>
and the animals). We always have homemade presents for<br/>
Solstice.<br/>
Our Christmas celebration is one we share with family<br/>
and friends. We have stockings and pressies in the<br/>
morning, pancakes for breakfast/brunch (always!),<br/>
dinner in the afternoon &lt;g&gt; (with crackers - of<br/>
course!), and play games all evening. Probably pretty<br/>
similar to a lot of people.<br/>
One tradition we have is a funny one. Every year my<br/>
mom puts some money for me in a big yellow plastic<br/>
tooth (I think it had bubble gum in it oh so many<br/>
years ago). This started when I was a little girl and<br/>
still continues to this day. I&#39;m on the lookout for a<br/>
funny/unique container to start this tradition with my<br/>
dd now. Oh, and she always hides it in the Christmas<br/>
tree branches.<br/>
