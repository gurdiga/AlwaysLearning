<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156461309"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;This could be corelation and not causation, that is<br/>
&gt;maybe very young kids who have the physical<br/>
&gt;attributes (whatever) of ADD will be drawn to <br/>
&gt;television.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think this is a logical assumption.  I have two<br/>
kids, and one, Thomas, has these tendancies that<br/>
schools label as problems, and he is SO into tv and<br/>
movies that he has wanted to be a director for three<br/>
years now.  He&#39;s passionate about it.  My other son,<br/>
Alex, is very calm, patient, loves puzzles, plays<br/>
musical instruments, etc.  He loves to watch movies<br/>
too, but not nearly as much.  He can take it or leave<br/>
it most days.  <br/>
<br/>
Both boys have had identical mainly non-restricted<br/>
access to tv, in fact Alex even more so than Thomas. <br/>
Thomas is so very sensative that we learned to filter<br/>
his programming access when he was too little to be<br/>
discerning on his own, as what he was watching was<br/>
having a very profound impact on his behavior and<br/>
happiness.  He just could not say no for himself to<br/>
ANY tv or movies.  Now he&#39;s old enough to get<br/>
information about a program beforehand and decide for<br/>
himself, or to watch and bit of something and tell us<br/>
it&#39;s not for him.  With Alex, on the other hand, he<br/>
could always watch pretty much anything and shrug it<br/>
off or ignore it if he didn&#39;t care for it.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Our brains actually are kind of flexible so that <br/>
&gt;they can be tailored or adapted to the environment<br/>
&gt;that we live in.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s an understatement.  Our brains are extremely<br/>
flexible.  It&#39;s not only reasonable, it&#39;s obvious, to<br/>
assume to we are shaped by our environments, in my<br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Probably all the best pilots and air traffic<br/>
&gt;controlers in the year 2050 will have to grow up<br/>
&gt;playing videogames to have the synapses they need to <br/>
&gt;run the computer consoles that they work at.<br/>
&gt;Betsy<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Fascinating idea, and also seems quite plausible,<br/>
given how plugged in we are getting and the increasing<br/>
complexity of our tools.  <br/>
<br/>
Deb said:<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;You might wonder that if a trained, expert, certified<br/>
&gt;teacher can&#39;t be at least as interesting as a TV<br/>
&gt;program, the problem isn&#39;t with TV or the kid but in<br/>
&gt;the belief kids need to pay attention to boring,<br/>
&gt;blathering drones in the first place. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think it&#39;s also likely that tv, video games and<br/>
other modern media are such a sensory barrage for some<br/>
of us (like me) that we learn to dial down our<br/>
receptivity levels if we can, so that it takes more<br/>
flash and more zing to reach us and we are not<br/>
drowning in input.  In which case the school officials<br/>
are trying to reach us through a &quot;cone of silence&quot;<br/>
that we have built around ourselves.  It&#39;s either<br/>
that, or there are so many other people in class and<br/>
other noises and so forth that we just can&#39;t focus on<br/>
what one person is doing/saying.  For those of us who<br/>
are more easily overwhelmed by sensory input, it can<br/>
be exceedingly difficult to selectively filter.  For<br/>
myself, I either have to &quot;turn the volume down&quot; on all<br/>
the input and end up seeming kind of spacey, or else<br/>
limit my time in very stimulating environments (such<br/>
as with lots of people and activity etc around- like<br/>
school, or the supermarket) to bits and bites that I<br/>
can handle before feeling buried under an avalanche of<br/>
input.  It&#39;s self defense.<br/>
<br/>
.....&gt;school officials who overwhelmingly suffer from<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;reasoning deficit disorder - a condition caused by<br/>
&gt;school attendance.   <br/>
&gt;Deb <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>HA!  I love that!<br/>
