Here&#39;s an idea that might be of immediate use, or might lead you to  <br/>

Dear Home-Schooling Family,<br/>
<br/>
We want to share with you an educational, family-oriented website  <br/>
that can enhance your home schooling<br/>
<br/>
The site, named www.MyGrandchild.com , has been designed by educators  <br/>
and is geared to children aged 3-8. It&#39;s easy to use and lots of  <br/>
fun.  Best of all, it allows distant family members, like  <br/>
grandparents and cousins, to interact with your children and  <br/>
participate actively in their day-to-day learning experiences.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the idea:<br/>
<br/>
The site is a form of fun distance learning. It allows grandparents  <br/>
or other relatives to read books and play educational games with  <br/>
children online in real time. The games improve reading and math  <br/>
skills, as well as encouraging children&#39;s natural curiosity.  <br/>
Grandparents enjoy it, too! This is a great way to strengthen bonds  <br/>
with family members, especially those you don&#39;t get to see too often.  <br/>
Joint engagement in meaningful activities makes for strong  <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
More information can be seen here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.mygrandchild.com/">http://www.mygrandchild.com/</a> <br/>
Home_Schooling/<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve are offering free trial use, so you can invite grandparents,  <br/>
friends and relatives to try it out at no cost.<br/>
Looking forward to seeing you at www.MyGrandchild.com !<br/>
Thank You & All The Best,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1292473057">My kids love to play iSketch with grandparents, cousins, and friends who<br/>
live on<br/>
the other side of the country. We set up a private room and you can pick fun<br/>
themes<br/>
for the clues. iSketch is like online Pictionary. Lots of times we&#39;ll open<br/>
Skype at the same<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Almost a not related thought, but my mother has recently told my <br/>
oldest daughter that she should learn how to write in cursive so that <br/>
when she sends letters or cards, she could read them.  My immediate <br/>
response, which I kept to myself, was that she should just email her <br/>
grandchild or write legibly for her.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, I find cursive hard to read and I know how to write it.  <br/>
I&#39;ve tried to read the cursive handwriting of very very old people, <br/>
sometimes long dead people, and I find myself figuring words by <br/>
context because I can&#39;t read all of them.<br/>
<br/>
My mother isn&#39;t afraid of computers, uses them all the time, yet her <br/>
thought process is still in the realm of handwriting and mail post <br/>
rather than electronic email and typing to her granddaughter.  <br/>
<br/>
Thought processes change with the newness of things available.  I was <br/>
thinking email was a middle ground, since, my daughter really only <br/>
sends and receives messages through things such as myspace and IMing <br/>
others.  She rarely even checks her email inbox, has an email addy <br/>
only for opening other accounts for access to other things cool on <br/>
the internet, yet I know she would keep her eye out for ecards and <br/>
mail from her grandma.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never played Halo, but I have played toontown with lots of other <br/>
folks.  To reject an idea so outright seems really old fashioned and <br/>
stuck in yesterday thought.  What an awesome way for a distant father <br/>
to keep in contact with a child, too bad it was rejected.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-704338721">And yet, when I come across something from my mom - who passed away a  <br/>
few years ago - written in her own handwriting, it is REALLY special -  <br/>
it can bring me to instant tears, it is so personal.<br/>
<br/>
My mom wrote in cursive, even to her young grandkids, on postcards  <br/>
from faraway lands, when she traveled. We&#39;d have them up on the fridge  <br/>
and the kids would try to read them, asking me to help, over the  <br/>
years. Somehow they all just picked it up and I never really noticed  <br/>
it happening, but now I&#39;m thinking maybe grandma&#39;s postcards were a  <br/>
big part of it.<br/>

He was a college student who had gone through public school thirteen  <br/>

Maybe you can get straight to it with this, but if not it&#39;s in the  <br/>

it&#39;s noon for Schuyler and her kids in England :D One day I went to bed and<br/>
Schuyler watched Hayden play his new Eragon game on PS2 and they chatted off<br/>
and on for hours :D It&#39;s cool just to see them signed on, knowing I could<br/>
invite their voices over for a visit just about any old time ;)<br/>
Hayden was chatting with another friend this morning... there were a few<br/>
long minutes where Hayden was suddenly quiet and his friend got frustrated.<br/>
Hayden turned the camera onto his screen so the friend could see what was<br/>
holding his concentration (and his tongue!) and H received the supportive &<br/>
excited Oooooohs and AAAAAHs while he did an instance on WoW.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1964259773">I love getting a call from Hayden. Skype is such a wonderful addition. My mom uses it now and calls us when she sees we are on. We&#39;ve got it on 3 different computers, but only one has a camera. At some point I&#39;ll go buy a couple of cameras for the other computers so that we can be visible in every possible state of life. I&#39;ve been talking to a Alex in Minnesota lately and I get to see her and her children living their lives and I feel so much more connected to them. I highly recommend Skype, oh and I should send Hayden our new computer&#39;s Skype account so that he can call on that one too. <br/>
