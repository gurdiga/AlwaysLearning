<div id="ygrps-yiv-1509482181">Well, we&#39;re heading down to Florida tomorrow.  It&#39;s been very hard <br/>
getting ready because the girls don&#39;t know we&#39;re going.  Two years ago <br/>
when we went we surprised the girls with the trip and they asked us to <br/>
always do trips that way because it was so exciting.  So that&#39;s what <br/>
we&#39;ve done, but it&#39;s been really hard since they want to be right by my <br/>
side all the time...<br/>
<br/>
but right now, they have the Twister game mat out and they&#39;re pretending <br/>
they&#39;re at the beach!  <br/>
<br/>
AND, Soleille, our 3 yr old, just came down with a fever today.  She&#39;s <br/>
sleeping right now so I hope she feels better when she wakes up.  She <br/>
has no other flu symptoms so I&#39;m hopeful.  But have you ever had the <br/>
feeling that you&#39;ve made something happen just by thinking about it?  I <br/>
was so worried about traveling during flu season...  Just coincidence, I <br/>
know, but still...<br/>
<br/>
The girls did great on the trip from NY to S. Carolina for the <br/>
conference but I&#39;m worried about Leiren now.  She&#39;s 13 months and <br/>
walking/climbing on everything.  It&#39;s going to be challenging keeping <br/>
her entertained.  <br/>
<br/>
Hope you all had a happy new year&#39;s eve and I wish you all the best. <br/>
 I&#39;ll be back in a few weeks.  I&#39;ll let you know how we managed not <br/>
having forced feeding at mealtime or a bed-time at my in-laws very small <br/>
house there.  My mil says she understands unschooling, but we&#39;ll <br/>
see...and hope!<br/>
<br/>
Wish us luck!<br/>
<br/>

Good luck!!<br/>
<br/>
And have fun!<br/>
<br/>
A car can be a good place to sleep off a fever, in my experience.  I love <br/>
sleeping in moving vehicles.  I hope it all goes great, though, whatever happens.<br/>
