<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437674579">One image I have in my head of how this kind of parenting works is  <br/>
like a hand pump.  Some of you might never  have used a hand pump on  <br/>
a well, but if it&#39;s been sitting a while or the well is deep you  <br/>
might pump this big long handle down and up several times, and  <br/>
nothing happens, but finally you hear the water and then it floods  <br/>
out, more water than you needed.  Then the next pump can be  <br/>
controlled because there&#39;s water in the pipe already, and it takes  <br/>
just the lightest touch.<br/>
<br/>
Or similarly, siphoning liquid with a short hose, where the beginning  <br/>
is scary and creepy and doesn&#39;t seem at all like it would work, but  <br/>
once it&#39;s flowing, you don&#39;t have to do anything except make sure the  <br/>
end of the hose is below the level of the weight of the water or  <br/>
whatever it is.<br/>
<br/>
Learning and growth are like a limitless reservoir, but we have  <br/>
factors in our culture that limit our access or control or faith that  <br/>
it could even work, or our feeling of ownership of knowledge of  <br/>
growth and learning.  Experts.  Timetables and charts.<br/>
<br/>
Just in case it would help anyone else to think of it as the flow of  <br/>
water but siphons and hand pumps are unfamiliar, here are some  <br/>
pictures (and they&#39;re just interesting anyway):<br/>

That second one is very interesting.  The water container is plastic,  <br/>
but it&#39;s a traditional pottery design, because it&#39;s in India.  In the  <br/>
U.S. we have plastic water buckets, but they&#39;re a traditional metal  <br/>
bucket design.  I&#39;m taking this to my Thinking Sticks blog.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-180434581">I can remember my parents priming pumps. I don&#39;t know where, but I can remember using hand pumps to fill sinks, I loved that process. Sometimes, though, the pump was dry and we&#39;d use the water that we had in the car to drink on the way (it was in a little red colemon water carrier that had two lids you could drink from and a tap, in case you needed the visual. Dad or mom would pour it down the line. I never really understood how it worked but google brought to me the information. When there is air in the line the pump isn&#39;t sealed as well. Maybe, in your analogy, lists like this are priming of a sort. Maybe we help to make the pump work more efficiently from the off by showing what can and does happen in a system where there is a straight run from water to sink. <br/>

That blot might eventually catch on, or not, but it&#39;s where I&#39;m doing  <br/>
what I do with my kids, and finding cool things and making connections.<br/>
<br/>
After having put that up, I got a gardening catalog today, and there  <br/>
are two rain collecting items.  I can&#39;t afford them, but they were  <br/>
right in keeping with the idea of plastic versions of traditional  <br/>
forms.    One is a wooden barrel and one is a big clay pot (but  <br/>
really, both are plastic).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170558180">and sometimes you have to prime the pump.  I used to have to prime the electric pump to water my horse when I was a kid.  Now, where we water the horses at the stable on Thursday nights after lessons, it is a regular faucet where you pull up the handle but due to the air in the hose it will often jerk and jump and as you&#39;re filling the bucket.  It will flow steady and then all of a sudden it will whoosh out a pocket of air unexpectedly and get water everywhere, eventually the water will flow calmly, steadily.  But every time the hose sits without flowing water for a while it is the same jerky start up process all over again.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860462070">Yes - That is why I posted the scenario/analogy as I thought it is very much like what we go through with deschooling or some other new insight.  And we don&#39;t even have to go back to &quot;a curriculum or rules&quot; to get this spurting before a new steady flow - sometimes it is moving forward (letting go of another something / parenting rule) that causes this spurting and &quot;mess&quot; before settling down to a nice even flow again.  Sometimes it is a nice calm flow and sometimes it gets splattered all over with what seems to be a mess but really is just a refreshing, cleansing spurt before calming down again.  At first the spurt of water is a bit of a surprise and can even be a bit of a shock if the cold water gets all over you - the horses toss their heads about to show their disapproval with the water spurts and noise (like some on this list) - but then you end up laughing and smiling at the fun of it all (at least that is how I respond to life in general).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-670788152">I saw a great toy at the beach and thought other unschoolers would <br/>
enjoy it.  It consists of a bucket and clear pvc tubes and connectors <br/>
and basically the kids put it together however they want and watch the <br/>
water flow out the sprinkler heads.  Just search Wacky Water Works.  <br/>
Its based in NJ.  I am not with this company, just love their product.  <br/>
And I also thought I would make it myself but its actually cheaper to <br/>
buy. - Have Fun - Robin</div>
