&lt;&lt; For what it&#39;s worth, I have not taken my children to the conference<br/>
once.  This will be my 5th year attending - my kids and husband do<br/>
something else that weekend.  I don&#39;t know when my children might<br/>
start going - I do know they won&#39;t be going this year either. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My kids were sort of at a conference once.  They met Dave Shmave in the pool. <br/>
 Mostly they went to Disneyland with their dad (it was in Anaheim, not <br/>
Sacramento).  I&#39;ve been to a couple of all-family get-togethers which weren&#39;t <br/>
really conferences.  And Holly was with me at a MindFull conference years <br/>
ago, with lots of other kids around and not too large a range of where to go <br/>
to find me (never outside the building, for sure).  <br/>
<br/>
This year I&#39;m wanting to see whether they&#39;ll have fun.  Kirby works weekends. <br/>
 Marty is going with me to South Carolina, and Holly to Sacramento.  If they <br/>
don&#39;t have fun or I don&#39;t have fun, we probably won&#39;t do it again.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy being away from the kids, but this year seemed like there would be <br/>
too much long time with all the kids stuck home.  Any two of them can get <br/>
along in the absence of the third in new and creative ways.  And any one of <br/>
them stuck home after Kirby&#39;s not there can find another friend to visit or <br/>
get a lot of direct dad attention.<br/>
