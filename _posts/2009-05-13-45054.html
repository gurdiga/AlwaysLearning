as unschooling. I know unschooling looks different for every family.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have a collection of typical days, and if people post some more I&#39;ll  <br/>
collect some of them up too.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/typical">http://sandradodd.com/typical</a><br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a saying that goes around that there are as many different  <br/>
ways to unschool as there are unschoolers, but I don&#39;t believe it.   <br/>
I&#39;ve seen too many families fail to pull it off.   I do think  <br/>
unschooling looks different in the details in every family.  Holly&#39;s  <br/>
learning a lot working in a flower shop.  It doesn&#39;t mean anyone else  <br/>
needs to consider working in a flower shop too.  Some families have  <br/>
boats.  Some have horses.  Some get to travel a lot.  Some have cool  <br/>
businesses.   But what I think is similar is that the parents are  <br/>
brave and present, when it&#39;s working.<br/>
<br/>
It takes courage to say &quot;Yes, I know you don&#39;t know if it will work.   <br/>
Yes, I know it&#39;s not normal.  Yes, we&#39;re going to keep doing it for  <br/>
now.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I guess I wonder why there aren&#39;t more black unschooling families.<br/>
Why aren&#39;t there more black homeschooling families in general?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Divorce is a big part of it, I think.  In the U.S., at least, there  <br/>
seems to be a current suspicion among African American women that  <br/>
husbands are unreliable and not to be depended on, and there aren&#39;t as  <br/>
many stay at home moms, I think.   There are plenty of unreliable  <br/>
drug, alcohol and wife-abusing men of any color, but I think there are  <br/>
different fears and concerns associated with different situations.<br/>
<br/>
When I was first unschooling there was a mom who had a newsletter for  <br/>
families of color, and she was the go-to person about this topic.   <br/>
Donna White was her name, in case you find some of her writings out  <br/>
and about.  She ended up divorced.  :-/<br/>
<br/>
Where I live there are lots of mixed race families (in New Mexico),  <br/>
for what that&#39;s worth.<br/>
<br/>
One Black family here was unschooling and the dad became more and more  <br/>
irritable and irritating as he MySpace got older.  He&#39;s a retired air  <br/>
force officer (captain, I think) with a PhD (mostly gotten while he  <br/>
was in the air force, the Master&#39;s, anyway).   They have three kids,  <br/>
about the ages of Marty and Holly and then one younger, and we&#39;ve  <br/>
known them for a long time.  Ten years, maybe.   When the kids were  <br/>
young, things were okay, but the mom and the boy who&#39;s most like her  <br/>
(a throwback to that other conversation about kids who are like a  <br/>
spouse one&#39;s not too happy with) started to balk at the too-many rules  <br/>
and surprise conditions.  The family is fairly granulated this year.    <br/>
I could go on.  But they&#39;re separated (not divorced) and the oldest  <br/>
girl, who did NOT go to school before, is at Stanford.<br/>
<br/>
The second one, the boy who&#39;s so much like his mom and who has taken  <br/>
the brunt of dad-crazy, was compelled to go to The Albuquerque  <br/>
Academy, the fanciest school in town.  He didn&#39;t want to go.   This is  <br/>
his senior year, and he&#39;s about to graduate, I think.   Probably.      <br/>
His dad made him go because he said Black boys who without a high  <br/>
school diploma won&#39;t be able to get a job or get into college.   He  <br/>
was wrong, but he liked finding out what V. wanted to do and then  <br/>
doing the opposite. I&#39;ve watched it for years.<br/>
<br/>
In this past four years V. went from a healthy football-player looking  <br/>
guy (pudgyish at 13) to a 100 pound hospitalized bulemic.   He ran  <br/>
away, and the only way we could get any messages to him was his mom to  <br/>
me, me to Holly, and notes left on, where he had claimed to be East  <br/>
Indian, and later Middle Eastern (not that kids care so much about  <br/>
profile stuff, but he was denying his heritage as hard as he could).<br/>
<br/>
I hope he&#39;ll be okay.  He used to have the greatest spark in him, but  <br/>
he&#39;s a shell.<br/>
<br/>
The youngest is probably 14 or so now, and is at Menaul, another  <br/>
private school, and a boarding school.  I don&#39;t know whether he&#39;ll be  <br/>
put into the Academy too.  He&#39;s much more like his dad, though, and  <br/>
will survive it better.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling didn&#39;t go well in that family because (in my opinion, from  <br/>
my observation) the dad was a controlling prick who blamed church, and  <br/>
his mom was a controlling mother he was paying way more attention to  <br/>
than he was paying to his wife.   I&#39;ve seen him do horrible arbitrary  <br/>
cruel things to that middle child.   Sadistic.  Not physical, but  <br/>
emotionally and mentally just horrible.<br/>
<br/>
My ideas here might be some of those easy border pieces that anyone  <br/>
could have worked, and nothing that will really help you, but I&#39;m  <br/>
chucking out what little I have for others to riff on.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still in contact with Kris Williams who used to post on AOL as  <br/>
RaisinNSun (or something like that spelling).  Her kids are all grown  <br/>
and though the last one went to high school to play basketball (and  <br/>
also got in some trouble with some of the kids he met there), most of  <br/>
them were unschooled.<br/>
<br/>

it.<br/>

I&#39;m not trying to sound high and mighty because I&#39;m still new to alot of<br/>
this, but education for our young black youth is something that has always<br/>
been on my heart.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In a nut shell: historically it is very difficult for the African American<br/>
community to give up on public schools.  Our grandparents and parents fought<br/>
so hard for the right to just attend a good one!  Sadly we can be slow on<br/>
the uptake for so many things. I have wished that there were more AA<br/>
unschooling families as well.  My daughter (10) is at the point where she is<br/>
wishing she saw more black faces.  It can be lonely for her sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I completely agree with all of your statements above.  If I had more time I<br/>
would be crusading this cause in the African American community.  I do not<br/>
believe that the public school system will help our children at all.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Why aren&#39;t there more black homeschooling families in general?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re talking about people in stable homes in supportive areas, I  <br/>
remember a black woman saying that there was cultural pressure not to  <br/>
homeschool because it was like a slap in the face to those who worked  <br/>
so hard to get the schools integrated.<br/>
<br/>
Not the answer, but another piece.<br/>
<br/>
And as Sandra suggested, there is a feeling of needing to work  <br/>
harder, be &quot;better than&quot; to overcome the handicap of being black.  <br/>
Despite laws, it&#39;s still a factor. And it&#39;s not helpful to add  <br/>
another difference (homeschooling) to another difference (being a  <br/>
minority) if the goal is to find stability in the mainstream.<br/>
<br/>
Someone was here a couple of years ago who was looking for solutions  <br/>
to some problems, but said she couldn&#39;t let go of the tight reins and  <br/>
the need to push her sons to prepare themselves for college because  <br/>
of the social pressures in her area that would pull them down and  <br/>
suck them in. (I&#39;m not remembering her situation clearly but she may  <br/>
have been divorced and it sounded like her community wasn&#39;t stable.)  <br/>
Most blacks have cultural roots in the south where control of kids is  <br/>
part of the culture.<br/>
<br/>
In less stable areas there is social pressure for people not to rise  <br/>
up out of it. Those who rise up are termed traitors to their kind and  <br/>
heritage. If the &quot;failures&quot; can keep others from succeeding, then  <br/>
they can create the illusion they aren&#39;t failures. Which isn&#39;t a  <br/>
ghetto thing. It happens in schools all the time where the kids who  <br/>
are failing criticize their friends who aren&#39;t. So what happens to  <br/>
homeschooled teens who are naturally spreading their wings searching  <br/>
for community beyond their family if the potential friends have given  <br/>
up and don&#39;t want you to do better either?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think the public school system is the place for our young  <br/>
&gt; black youth.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The schools aren&#39;t helping many but they aren&#39;t the cause of the  <br/>
problem. They may be making it worse, but a community of stable  <br/>
strong families can be armor against a great deal. But the stable  <br/>
families are surrounded by too many families that aren&#39;t stable and  <br/>
strong. There are too many families who are controlling their kids --  <br/>
for good reasons, to hold onto them! -- which ends up driving them  <br/>
away. There isn&#39;t any one fix. It&#39;s a whole tight ball of intertwined  <br/>
problems that exacerbate each other.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think if more black families would homeschool their children they  <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t end up in the jails and on the streets.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unschooling especially needs a stable home and a stable community  <br/>
with a good percentage of friends from stable homes.<br/>
<br/>
There are too many needy unstable families raising needy kids. Needy  <br/>
girls get pregnant to hold onto the guy or create something that will  <br/>
love them but really just becomes something needy. Too many powerless  <br/>
guys seeking ways to be powerful.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about needy people growing up in families and communities  <br/>
that can&#39;t give them what they need and they end up with poor  <br/>
substitutes and still needy.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a great atmosphere for even a stable family who wants to  <br/>
homeschool.<br/>

community to give up on public schools. Our grandparents and parents  <br/>
fought<br/>

the uptake for so many things.-=-<br/>
<br/>
With bottle feeding and nursing, the racial division seemed to show.    <br/>
When bottle feeding was seen as something people did if they could  <br/>
afford to, it took some people longer to be able to afford it, and by  <br/>
then there was a movement toward figuring out, again, how to  <br/>
breastfeed.  In a population where breastfeeding had been associated  <br/>
with poverty, they didn&#39;t WANT to do that, and arguments about health  <br/>
and closeness did not trump the celebration of being able to afford  <br/>
formula and cute bottles.<br/>
<br/>
In another area of thought, we had a young woman join this list or  <br/>
maybe Unschooling Discussion years ago, and she was about to move from  <br/>
Louisiana or Mississippi (maybe someone remembers the story) to New  <br/>
York.  I think she was living with her dad, but was going to be with  <br/>
the father of her child/children.   I also thing some of her relatives  <br/>
were from the Caribbean.   Sorry to be vague.  Her questions were  <br/>
about discipline and spanking, and when people advised other ways to  <br/>
deal with behavior situations without spanking, she assured us it was  <br/>
a tradition in her culture that she couldn&#39;t break, or some such.    <br/>
She felt she had no option but to spank, being in her dad&#39;s house, or  <br/>
whatever all.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a book and I&#39;m not thinking of the name of it, but it&#39;s about  <br/>
the residual effects of manumission and recovery from slavery within  <br/>
some families, and spanking seems to be a part of it.   Not a healthy  <br/>
part of it, but partly justified by &quot;my forefathers were whipped  <br/>
and...&quot;   Something about power.  Something about reaction.   And I  <br/>
read some of that when my friend Tony was risking his family&#39;s peace  <br/>
and future with his controlling and baffling behavior.   It seemed  <br/>
that from Tony&#39;s point of view, the way he was treating his mid-kid V.  <br/>
was so far beyond spanking or &quot;whippin&#39;&quot; (in the southern with-a- <br/>
switch meaning) that he *must* be being a generous, liberal parent,  <br/>
because he wasn&#39;t striking his child.<br/>
<br/>
So if someone feels &quot;his culture&quot; requires strict discipline, and then  <br/>
there&#39;s a fundamentalist Christian overlay reinforcing that, it might   <br/>
be that unschooling is too far a stretch for this lifetime, for this  <br/>
generation.    Respect for children might be a philosophical luxury  <br/>
some people can&#39;t afford.   If a child is &quot;equal&quot; in value to an  <br/>
adult, where and what then is the value of being an adult?   (I see  <br/>
that in some of my friends and family who white as all getout, and  <br/>
some who are hispanic/northern New Mexican, and families with combo/ <br/>
coyote kids [not &quot;kuy otee&quot; in English, but &quot;cohYOteh&quot; in Spanish]).<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is always a case-by-case deal, and there&#39;s rarely any  <br/>
family for whom it&#39;s a simple, easy decision.<br/>
<br/>
Another aspect of why there might not be more unschoolers of color (to  <br/>
stay with that phrase, thinking of the international makeup of this  <br/>
list) is that there can be pressure from &quot;a community&quot; to be different  <br/>
from &quot;the others&quot; (non-Christians, or &quot;white people&quot; or rich people or  <br/>
intellectuals or hippies or whatever is identified with the &quot;out  <br/>
there&quot; weird or dangerous anti-them).<br/>
<br/>
I had a co-worker who grew up in the South Valley in Albuquerque  <br/>
(rougher, more &quot;ethnic&quot; than other parts of town), went to Rio Grande  <br/>
High (had a rough reputation in those days), said she used to hide  <br/>
razor blades in her hairdo and get into fights with other girls.  She  <br/>
was African American.   (Still is, but we lost contact fifteen years  <br/>
ago or so. &lt;g&gt;)  She was interested in the SCA, and went to a  <br/>
tournament with me, but because some of her neighbors razzed her about  <br/>
dressing up and going to hang out with white folks, she was  <br/>
embarrassed to continue.  She saw value in bowing to pressure from  <br/>
neighbors.   She wasn&#39;t the only Black person in the club, but there  <br/>
aren&#39;t lots.   Those who are there tend to play VERY well, and I think  <br/>
it might be because they&#39;ve already sacrificed some peace and &quot;face&quot;  <br/>
to go and do that, and they&#39;re getting some razzing from friends and  <br/>
relatives, too, to play at the history of Europe (though it&#39;s not just  <br/>
that).<br/>
<br/>
More clues and questions; not &quot;the answer.&quot;<br/>

unschooling looks different in the details in every family. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I was trying to get at. Even though it looks different, the philosophy is still the same. <br/>

 Why aren&#39;t there more black homeschooling families in general?-=-<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;Divorce is a big part of it, I think.  In the U.S., at least, there  seems to be a current suspicion among African American women that husbands are unreliable and not to be depended on, and there aren&#39;t as  many stay at home moms, I think. &lt;&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is correct. For some reason black women have adopted this idea that they don&#39;t need a husband or father for their children.  I have yet to meet another black stay at home mom. All I hear about is how they can&#39;t wait to get away from their kids.<br/>
<br/>
I am a part of that yahoo group you listed. That is actually the one I was talking about.<br/>
Most of the sites that are on the web are not there anymore. So sad and frustrating.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;In this past four years V. went from a healthy football-player looking  <br/>
 </span></blockquote>guy (pudgyish at 13) to a 100 pound hospitalized bulemic.   He ran   away, and the only way we could get any messages to him was his mom to  me, me to Holly, and notes left on, where he had claimed to be East Indian, and later Middle Eastern (not that kids care so much about profile stuff, but he was denying his heritage as hard as he could).<br/>
I hope he&#39;ll be okay.  He used to have the greatest spark in him, but  <br/>
he&#39;s a shell.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
That is so sad. I don&#39;t even know what to say. I suppose once you push your children so much there comes a point where they don&#39;t or won&#39;t return.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m glad you, Joyce and Sandra brought up other points to me. I didn&#39;t stop to think about how hard some worked to get their children into the school system.<br/>
<br/>
I hate that there is still this&quot; this is what it means to be black in America thing&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It has to start with the parents but most have the way of thinking mentioned above.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce and Sandra you are correct about there not being stable communities and needy families. Don&#39;t get me started on the teen pregnancy.<br/>
I think you all are offering some food for thought.<br/>

Vincent King.  His name is Vincent King. I woke up unwilling to shield  <br/>
his dad from criticism, or to keep Vincent a secret.  He&#39;s a good guy  <br/>
with a lot of potential and a bunch of hurt to overcome.  He&#39;s a  <br/>
skateboarder.   Last I talked to his mom, he was thinking of moving to  <br/>
Arizona.   In case any of you ever meet him, tell him I like him. (He  <br/>
knows, but might like to hear it again.)<br/>
<br/>
He ran away last summer and was hidden for six weeks or so, but came  <br/>
back on the condition he could live with his mom and not his dad, and  <br/>
that he would finish the last year at the academy.  His dad wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
say whether he was going to pay for the whole year or just until the  <br/>
birthday.  He did pay for the whole year, but he&#39;s left Vincent  <br/>
hanging until the last SECOND sometimes, on things like whether  <br/>
Vincent had to go with him to see the grandparents in North Carolina  <br/>
or not, and whether Vincent could go to a friend&#39;s house or to a game  <br/>
or whatever.  He just wouldn&#39;t say yes or no in enough time that  <br/>
Vincent could make plans, and the fact that it was not only torturous  <br/>
for Vincent but WAY inconvenient for his friends and hosts and rides  <br/>
didn&#39;t matter to his dad.<br/>
<br/>
He can do computer animation really well, so that might be where he  <br/>
ends up working (beyond skateboard shops, if he does, I mean).<br/>

live in Oregon where there really aren&#39;t a lot of people of color<br/>
anyway.  My experience is that I&#39;m equally as likely to not see any<br/>
homeschooling families of any other colors.  I can honestly say that I<br/>
don&#39;t know of any hispanic families that are homeschooling, but I bet<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2077218009">Before we started unshooling, when Evan was younger, I helped to start a charter school here. The idea was that it was going to be as close to a democratic school as it could be, considering that it&#39;s a public school and so would have to follow state curriculum and the students would have to have end-of-grade tests in certain years. (not at all like a democratic school, in other words) One of the hopes for the school was that the classes would use the Positive Discipline approach; they&#39;d hold class meetings, there wouldn&#39;t be punishments, etc.<br/>
<br/>
That idea was quickly discarded, though, when the mostly-white group of founders was outvoted by the parents whose kids had been accepted into the school - the majority of whom had African-American and high-needs kids. I couldn&#39;t understand how *anyone* would choose to do things differently. Positive Discipline made so much SENSE to me.<br/>
<br/>
I was deeply affected when an African-American mom explained that her son was *already* followed in stores by security, they were already viewed with suspicion because they were black. She believed her son didn&#39;t have room to make mistakes, because the consequences for him, as a black male, would be so much worse than for a white privileged kid. She said, &quot;He will be under my thumb until he is grown and gone. I will not lose him in that way. I can&#39;t give him the freedom to mess up.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1934503331">Hi,<br/>
My name is Barbie and I unschool my 9 year old twin boys.  I guess you can<br/>
call us Hispanic even though we look white.  My husband&#39;s parents are from<br/>
Puerto Rico, and my parents come from Cuba.  My parents came to America for<br/>
freedom.  Little kids in Cuba were taught to honor Fidel Castro and only<br/>
him.  You were taught in school to be a communist. My parents wanted freedom<br/>
for me.  It was my Idea to unschool my kids, my hubby loved the idea and<br/>
still suports me to this day.  My parents also support us in our unschooling<br/>
journey.  She says thats why she came to this country and she is very proud<br/>
of me, for living in FREEDOM.  My neighbors on the other hand look at us as<br/>
if we are from out of space,  maybe we are. LOL<br/>
