Have any of you hear a Cajun accent/dialect? That is the hardest to <br/>
understand for me!<br/>
I say &quot;might should&quot; and &quot;might could&quot; once in a while (which dh has a great <br/>
time teasing me about) but thought it was my family&#39;s North Dakotan <br/>
roots....???<br/>
Where oh where DID that one start?<br/>
I also say BAgels and HOtel...hmmmm.<br/>

we fly into New Orleans and I hear the first local talk, I give a big sigh, <br/>
and know I am home. I dont really speak with the accent too much, but can <br/>
turn it right back on at the drop of a hat!<br/>

I cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>
to come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>
Remember Who I Am.<br/>
