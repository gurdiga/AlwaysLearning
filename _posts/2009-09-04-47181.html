<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291239115">I know people new to homeschooling are often frustrated and agitated.   <br/>
It can be stressful.<br/>
No one has to post.  Just reading is fine.  Just reading is GREAT for  <br/>
those very new to the list.<br/>
<br/>
Read here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschooling">http://sandradodd.com/unschooling</a><br/>
and<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoyching.com">http://joyfullyrejoyching.com</a><br/>
and<br/>
the intro and archives at the group&#39;s main page:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/AlwaysLearning/</a><br/>
<br/>
One thing it says there is:  &quot;This is a moderated group, with  <br/>
trapdoors for the uncooperative. (Not moderated in the advance- <br/>
approval way, but in the be-nice-to-play way. New members&#39; posts are  <br/>
moderated, and it&#39;s good to read several dozen posts before jumping  <br/>
in.) &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DO ask questions about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t need introductory posts.  Information in the course of other  <br/>
discussion is fine, but an introduction for the sake of an  <br/>
introduction isn&#39;t as helpful for a discussion list as for a social or  <br/>
support list.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Thank you&quot; and &quot;me too&quot; and &quot;LOL&quot; are assumed; don&#39;t post those  <br/>
unless it&#39;s in the course of useful comments that will help others  <br/>
understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t write rude letters to the moderators nor to me.  Be with your  <br/>
kids.  Gather what you need to know.  Don&#39;t be abusive of me nor of  <br/>
any moderators.<br/>
<br/>
Getting angry doesn&#39;t mean you need to leave the list.  It means you  <br/>
shouldn&#39;t have gotten angry.   Figuring out how to be calm is part of  <br/>
learning to unschool.<br/>

Probably the questions you have have been asked before.<br/>
A great deal of information for new unschoolers is here:<br/>
