&gt;<br/>
&gt; This realm is in the recipe that makes a 9x13&quot; pan and you have a 9x9&quot; pan; it<br/>
&gt; connects the two. It&#39;s in the difference between fixed expenses and variable expenses<br/>
&gt; in running a household or business.<br/>

It seems that the wonder of many things lies somehow in what seems to be empty space.  Whether the space is between  differently sized pans or  people, it&#39;s in the space that our imagination and creativity work.<br/>
<br/>
Decorators work on the space between objects arranged on a table or in a room;  painters  with the space surrounding images on a canvas.<br/>
<br/>
When I perform, either in a play or reading, or when I used to dance, there&#39;s an experience I&#39;ve always had, usually  after plenty of rehearsal, when I know we&#39;re in a good place.....All of a sudden there&#39;s a sensation of there being air between the words or movements and people.  It just feels airy.  And that&#39;s a good show.<br/>

<br/>
In music, the silences and the lack of harmony are as much a part of the <br/>
music as the busy runs and big loud chords.<br/>
<br/>
Because of school and such traditions (music lessons) we get the prejudicial <br/>
idea that once one has &quot;completed&quot; a step or level, they should never look <br/>
back, but keep on moving upward and onward, to harder, bigger, more complex <br/>
things.  Things with less airy space.  More solid/hard.<br/>
<br/>
The ideas of baby books and &quot;too easy&quot; and &quot;beginning things&quot; are a danger to <br/>
unschoolers too.   To prevent falling into the same vortex, we shouldn&#39;t <br/>
discourage kids from revisiting their wonder at an elegant, simple beginning <br/>
piece, whether it&#39;s music or magic or math.   Just because a child can make a <br/>
cake from scratch doesn&#39;t mean she should be ashamed ever after for making a <br/>
bowl of ramen.  One of the principles of spirituality (Eastern and Western <br/>
and probably all outside those two big-to-us groups) is to be present in the <br/>
moment, to dedicate small actions to God, to be mindful.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes mindfulness works best with simple tasks.  So priests and nuns <br/>
clean floors and woodwork, they pull weeds or arrange sand and rocks.  They <br/>
don&#39;t say &quot;Okay, I&#39;ve mastered that task; I can only do hard things I don&#39;t <br/>
know how to do well.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s okay for a teenager or an adult to play with arithmetical patterns and <br/>
see how fun it is that &quot;times nine&quot; makes a pattern where the numbers add up <br/>
to nine.  It&#39;s more than okay.  It&#39;s okay for someone to make a mobius strip <br/>
even though it&#39;s not news to him or her.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773961675">The picture they&#39;re talking about below, Escher&#39;s transformation from birds <br/>
to fish, is at the website listed at the bottom.  I found this following <br/>
links from the mobius strip page, and I&#39;ll probably get Marty the t-shirt for <br/>
Christmas, but the commentary there was so much like what&#39;s been being <br/>
discussed here I had to share it, mostly because of this line:  &quot;Any <br/>
scientist who uses a print to illustrate a theory selects one or more <br/>
elements from the print that are analogous to components of the theory, and <br/>
in this way the print becomes a model for the theory.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That, and the title of this thread, and the idea that between the fish are <br/>
the birds.  Where birds aren&#39;t, fish are.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;In the horizontal center strip there are birds and fish equivalent to <br/>
eachother. We associate flying with sky, and so for each of the black birds <br/>
thesky in which it is flying is formed by the four white fish which <br/>
encircleit. Similarly swimming makes us think of water, and therefore the <br/>
fourblack birds that surround a fish become the water in which it swims. <br/>

------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
This print has been used is physics, geology, chemistry, and in psychology <br/>
for the study of visual perception. In the picture a number of visual <br/>
elements unite into a simple visual representation, but separately each forms <br/>
a point of departure for the elucidation of a theory in one of these <br/>
disciplines.<br/>
<br/>
The basis of this print is a regular division of the plane consisting of <br/>
birds and fish. We see a horizontal series of these elements - fitting into <br/>
each other like the pieces of a jigsaw puzzle - in the middle, transitional <br/>
portion of the print. In this central layer the pictorial elements are equal: <br/>
birds and fish are alternately foreground or background, depending on whether <br/>
the eye concentrates on light or dark elements. The birds take on an <br/>
increasing three-dimensionality in the upward direction, and the fish, in the <br/>
downward direction. But as the fish progress downward they gradually lose <br/>
their shapes to become a uniform background of sky and water, respectively. <br/>
<br/>
We can think of a number of paired concepts applying to this picture: <br/>
light-dark, top-bottom, flat-rounded, figure-background, interlocking <br/>
pictorial elements-independent pictorial elements, geometric <br/>
structure-realistic form; and, with respect to the subject of the print, <br/>
birds-fish, sky-water, immobility-movement. Any scientist who uses a print to <br/>
illustrate a theory selects one or more elements from the print that are <br/>
analogous to components of the theory, and in this way the print becomes a <br/>
model for the theory. C.H.A. BROOS<br/>

<br/>
A good friend of mine asked me about Harold Pinter&#39;s Homecoming - what I<br/>
thought of it. She had seen a production of it I didn&#39;t like it.  If I<br/>
remember correctly, it is a story of emotional violence and sexual power<br/>
struggle between a mother and son. I was at a loss to explain that the<br/>
substance of the play is in what is NOT there.  That characters are often<br/>
not people, that people are often just ideas or emotion or instincts. The<br/>
actors stand there (like the numbers in an equation) delivering carefully<br/>
crafted dialogue that has been reduced to only the necessary syllables,<br/>
empty of emotion, that is the reality of the situation that isn&#39;t physically<br/>
there. The son may be interpreted as the mother&#39;s sexual and emotional<br/>
dysfunction. Her life might exist outside the characters and time we see on<br/>
the stage. That the world happens in the [pause] indicated in the script.<br/>
<br/>
It felt easier to explain this with something as abstract as math.<br/>
<br/>
I think Pinter would define the world as existing *between* the 9x9 and the<br/>
9x13 pans<br/>
<br/>
Â <br/>
In 1958 Pinter wrote the following:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There are no hard distinctions between what is real and what is unreal, nor<br/>
between what is true and what is false. A thing is not necessarily either<br/>
true or false; it can be both true and false.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think once you get past the computational functions Pam equates to<br/>
phonics, math can be a Pinter play.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Sandra, I didn&#39;t do drugs in the 60s.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>

And 2+2 doesn&#39;t necessarily add up to 4.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-484788545">&lt;&lt; And 2+2 doesn&#39;t necessarily add up to 4.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The first time I used this sort of math language on Marty, he said &quot;two <br/>
WHAT?&quot;  I remember he was really little, and he had no interest in the idea <br/>
that you could add two numbers without it being numbers of actual things.  <br/>
<br/>
And it makes sense.  One army plus one army is...  <br/>
Well are they on the same side? If so, it&#39;s one bigger army.  If not, it <br/>
could be a battle.<br/>
<br/>
 Is there enough food for them all? If not, it might be anarchy.<br/>
<br/>
I argued with everyone here for a week (and lost to the mathies, and won to <br/>
the verbals) that 0x0 is &quot;something.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keith said &quot;that&#39;s set theory.&quot;  I said fine.<br/>
We&#39;d been through all the other zero factors.<br/>
<br/>
zero plus one is one<br/>
<br/>
zero minus one is zero or negative one (depending if it was money or not)<br/>
<br/>
something divided by zero is not divided, it&#39;s whole.<br/>
<br/>
zero times a something is nothing.<br/>
zero times a nothing must be a something.  You have NO nothing, therefor <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
It is the stuff of headaches.<br/>

&gt;isn&#39;t working&quot; it&#39;s hard to explain that this is unschooling, as much as<br/>
&gt;reading or writing or building or breathing is, no more, no less, and that<br/>
&gt;it&#39;s working just fine.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This brings to mind Ch. 11 of the Tao Te Ching:<br/>
<br/>
Thirty spokes share the wheel&#39;s hub;<br/>
It is the center that hole that makes it useful.<br/>
Shape clay into a vessel;<br/>
It is the space within that makes it useful.<br/>
Cut doors and windows for a room;<br/>
It is the holes which make it useful.<br/>
Therefore benefit comes from what is there;<br/>
Usefulness from what is not there.<br/>
<br/>
After I read this the first time I felt like I had been blinded by the <br/>
light. I&#39;ll admit I had never thought about it that way before. Now it all <br/>
makes perfect sense and I can&#39;t understand how I missed it before. It&#39;s the <br/>
space between. The German&#39;s call it zwischenraum. In Zen painting they refer <br/>
to the impotance of negative space. It all serves a purpose.<br/>
