<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743615313"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;Even if we don&#39;t ask him, we are waiting inside...<br/>
&gt;And since he was born, he react to our &quot;inside&quot;, and<br/>
&gt;never to what we can say. Only what we have inside.<br/>
&gt;He can read in our minds as if it was a book... <br/>
&gt;I&#39;m sure now he&#39;s telling us &quot;leave me alone!!!&quot;...<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Both my kids are extremely sensative, but in different<br/>
ways.  This description above reminds me to my oldest,<br/>
who is like a barometer for what&#39;s inside others.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know if I would call it intuitive in his case,<br/>
because he doesn&#39;t seem aware often of why he feels<br/>
the way he does, or to understand these feelings, but<br/>
it&#39;s obvious that he&#39;s picking up on what others are<br/>
feeling.  He amplifies these emotions he picks up from<br/>
others, and always echos them back tenfold in an<br/>
autistic parroting kind of way, even if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
seem to really be feeling that way at all (like acting<br/>
out an angry rage while trying not to laugh, etc.)  He<br/>
doesn&#39;t even have to speak to or interact with people<br/>
he&#39;s amplifying, just be in their general physical<br/>
vacinity.  It&#39;s often spooky.<br/>
<br/>
His emotional radar is very strong, but with his<br/>
autism, he often can&#39;t understand from people&#39;s tone<br/>
of voice, facial expressions, and body language what<br/>
they are communicating (like when people are angry,<br/>
sad, etc.)  It&#39;s makes for complicated and frustrating<br/>
(particularly for him) communication problems to have<br/>
all this internal emotional information without<br/>
knowing where it is coming from or what to do with it.<br/>
 Fortunately he&#39;s very verbal and what one therapist<br/>
called &quot;highly gifted&quot; and so he is learning, slowly<br/>
and painfully and through unconventioanl pathways, to<br/>
read and understand this social information and act on<br/>
it appropriately.  <br/>
<br/>
In fact we&#39;ve been told we&#39;ve done miracles with him<br/>
for overcoming his particular challenges, but we take<br/>
little credit for that.  It was/is unschooling that is<br/>
responsible, not drugging him or sticking him into a<br/>
special ed program at school (where he would<br/>
definately go if he were in school) or massive<br/>
therapies, or expecting him to fit into anyone&#39;s box. <br/>
Just being at home, where it&#39;s emotionally and<br/>
physically &quot;safe&quot; and comfortable for him (he&#39;s VERY<br/>
sensory defensive with all his senses) does miraculous<br/>
things for his ability to be less stressed out by his<br/>
environment and spend more time learning and growing<br/>
and being his brilliant self.<br/>
<br/>
My younger son I would call intuitive.  He<br/>
instinctively knows when someone needs a joke or<br/>
comforting or to be left alone, he cries when other<br/>
people are hurt, and he understands how they are<br/>
feeling even if they don&#39;t say a word, but he doesn&#39;t<br/>
just recieve those unfiltered feelings and act them<br/>
out in an amplified manner and without understanding. <br/>
