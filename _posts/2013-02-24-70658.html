<div id="ygrps-yiv-603214792">Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This question is not so much about unschooling but more about a kind approach to an issue we have at the moment. <br/>
I hope it&#39;s ok?<br/>
<br/>
My son (almost 4) has had some issues with one of the eyes that slightly turned &quot;in&quot; when he was tired. <br/>
<br/>
I went to the eye doctor and it turns out he needs glasses - and strong ones at that (+5.5 and +5). <br/>
I ordered the glasses and now he wears them most of the time,<br/>
When he does not wear the glasses, the eye that turned in is now almost always turned in.. <br/>
<br/>
We just had a 3 month control and the doctor advised that I cover the good eye so that the other would get better. He also sees less with the &quot;lazy&quot; one, even with the glasses.<br/>
She advised something that looks like a plaster or a band-aid that I should stick on his good eye.<br/>
<br/>
My son finds it very difficult to wear that. It is the only thing that I could find in the pharmacy here (Holland). <br/>
He cannot open his eye behind it and when we take it away it epilates his fine face hairs and eyebrows and one time it even caught his (very long) eyelashes. <br/>
I cannot convince him to wear them (I would also not want them on!) and of course the promise of a brighter future means nothing to him compared to the pain of the present.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have any experience with this kind of eye issue? What did you do and what kind of (other) solutions did you offer? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1776100586">My sister had a similar problem at a younger age (many years ago now), had surgery, and was prescribed an eye patch afterwards. <br/>
<br/>
From memory and from photos, though, what she had wasn&#39;t sticky, but was more like a pirate eyepatch. A solid curved plastic thing (so it fit her eye socket neatly) with elastic round her head to hold it on. Would that work? Could you construct your own? <br/>
<br/>
You might also be able to make more of the &quot;pirate&quot; thing to help him with it - I remember thinking my sister&#39;s patch was kind of cool! Get him a toy parrot to go with it if he&#39;d appreciate that ;) <br/>
<br/>
You can also get goggles which cover the whole eye area and all around - like science goggles. A friend who is sunlight sensitive has a pair that he&#39;s done up to look very &quot;steampunk&quot; - all black and gold, very cool. Could that work? Might need some adjustment around the nose. <br/>

<br/>
There are exercises to strengthen the eye muscles which is the purpose of the eye patch.  These may improve his muscles and will certainly be less painful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1864475839">Does he like to play pirates? He could use a &quot;play&quot; eye patch - you could even make one, if you&#39;re crafty that way. Otherwise, if he&#39;s okay with wearing the glasses, cover the lens with something - I think someone gave a link to a ready-made cover but again it&#39;s something you could concoct if you like that sort of thing, and personalize it. <br/>
<br/>
Do some research on the subject online - what I&#39;ve read is that the correction is most important for close work, so things like reading, playing video games, surfing the internet. When he&#39;s running around outside, he&#39;s using his eyes differently. It&#39;s also possible to correct issues like this slowly, covering the eye for shorter periods of time. Doctors don&#39;t like that because they&#39;re under pressure to get kids all fixed up for school - often under pressure from parents themselves! So they&#39;re going to recommend something faster out of self-defense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-741952090">As a young child, I also had to endure wearing an eye patch, to help with a lazy eye. I  remember the lens of my glasses over the good eye being covered with something, rather than my eye though.<br/>
<br/>
I think my parents used somesort of sticking plaster over the lens, and on another occasion a coating of soap.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, this is a bit vague. It happened nearly 50 years ago, and my parents are no longer around to ask exactly what happened. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1948205614">Hi Ioana,<br/>
<br/>
I have a dd with Strabismus.  It&#39;s a condition which is a lot like your<br/>
son&#39;s condition.  <br/>
<br/>
The eye-patches (hate those darned things) would find themselves in the most<br/>
innovative of hiding places when dd was all of 2 - you get the picture.<br/>
They also didn&#39;t help one jot.  What did help is Vision Therapy, which is a<br/>
more holistic approach in treating eye issues.  I am sure that Holland has<br/>
some practitioners who follow alternative treatment, and someone will be<br/>
able to guide you.  <br/>
<br/>
Amazingly, Vision Therapy helped us discover that the issue was not one of<br/>
eye or eye muscle at all, but of the brain.  My dd&#39;s brain *chose* not to<br/>
see from her left eye, which made the vision poorer in that eye (think<br/>
atrophied muscle).  In Vision Therapy, they trained her brain to connect<br/>
with her left eye so she began using it.  It is not 100% fine, but is 90%<br/>
better, and she does not need surgery.<br/>
<br/>
Do email me in private if you want to know more.  Do Google &#39;Vision<br/>
Therapy&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-266468677">We made patching a family affair - in the beginning we all wore them and we&#39;d play pirates and chase each other around with soft swords. <br/>
<br/>
We ordered patches that were for sensitive skin and the doctor showed us how to pinch the top center of the patch (before we put it on) to help long eyelashes not to get caught. I would also sometimes stick the patch to my skin first, to make it less sticky.<br/>
<br/>
We made a big deal of how beautiful the different patches were and Gisele decorated all sorts of things with her old patches. <br/>
<br/>
If the doctor recommended patches aren&#39;t working, then I&#39;d cover the lens of his glasses or get a costume pirate patch. I&#39;d also get a matching patch so you could wear one with him sometimes. <br/>

<br/>
Minor point, but maybe not so minor.<br/>
Don&#39;t hate things that have to do with your children, if you can help it.  It will make the thing hateful.  It won&#39;t be helpful when trying to persuade the child that it&#39;s not so bad, if the mom seems to hate it.<br/>
<br/>
This is another case of choice being more empowering than the helpless feeling of &quot;have to.&quot;<br/>
You don&#39;t have to use the patches.  Doctors advise, explain, prescribe. If you feel helpless and powerless and you&#39;re the older member of your team, your child will feel even more helpless and powerless.<br/>
<br/>
Go with choices. Explain why.  Consider how bad it would really be if you didn&#39;t use it as long as, or exactly the same way as, the doctor says you &quot;have to.&quot;  It won&#39;t hurt anyone&#39;s eyes for you to consider many factors carefully.   It can hurt more than eyes if you don&#39;t consider carefully and make choices from as peaceful a place as possible.<br/>

If I lighten up and ignore things that won&#39;t help a situation, will you feel better?<br/>

Will all the children of all the moms who didn&#39;t get the advice that it&#39;s better to be positive than to express hatred feel better?<br/>

&quot;Hate&quot; isn&#39;t going to be funny, I don&#39;t think.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-572698064">***Merely at attempt at humor! Lighten up. ***<br/>
<br/>
The point that a mom who might say “I hate those darn things” can influence how her child feels about trying them is important. A little child isn’t likely to feel like trying them if his mom is already sure they’re awful and expresses her hatred of them.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe someone here reading hadn’t considered that. It’s helpful to point it out. <br/>
<br/>
I wore an eye patch and corrective lenses. I don’t remember how I felt about the patch but I do remember tripping all the time, hitting my head and not being able to see people approaching from my right side. I had no depth perception and I fell getting on and off the school bus very often. It’s not easy being that kid. Moms can, right away, make it harder if they’re not careful.   <br/>

My husband had one eye that turned inward when he was a child and the<br/>
glasses alone fixed his.  I didn&#39;t have that problem, but one of my eyelids<br/>
moves when I chew and the doctor suggested a patch for me, to strengthen<br/>
the lid.  I was so young, I don&#39;t remember the doctor&#39;s visit.  My parents<br/>
chose not to have me wear a patch.  My eyelid still moves when I eat, but I<br/>
can&#39;t feel it, and only remember it when a kid says something about it (not<br/>
very often).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-154407580">My son has a similar   eye condition. We opted to use an eye patch like a pirate.  We found out when he was 5yr and we were told that if we didn&#39;t cover his good eye or place drops in the good to force him to use the weak eye by 9yr it would be permanent. <br/>
<br/>
He now where&#39;s glasses only one eye uses a high prescription   <br/>
<br/>
We explained the issue and what was recommend but we did not force it on him. He used it sometimes, we made it fun and easy. But if he said no that was that. <br/>
<br/>
He is now 10yr and and it has gotten better but he still wears glasses. And when he gets older he can choose to wear a contact. <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] questions about a &quot;lazy eye&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  <br/>
Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
This question is not so much about unschooling but more about a kind approach to an issue we have at the moment. <br/>
I hope it&#39;s ok?<br/>
<br/>
My son (almost 4) has had some issues with one of the eyes that slightly turned &quot;in&quot; when he was tired. <br/>
<br/>
I went to the eye doctor and it turns out he needs glasses - and strong ones at that (+5.5 and +5). <br/>
I ordered the glasses and now he wears them most of the time,<br/>
When he does not wear the glasses, the eye that turned in is now almost always turned in.. <br/>
<br/>
We just had a 3 month control and the doctor advised that I cover the good eye so that the other would get better. He also sees less with the &quot;lazy&quot; one, even with the glasses.<br/>
She advised something that looks like a plaster or a band-aid that I should stick on his good eye.<br/>
<br/>
My son finds it very difficult to wear that. It is the only thing that I could find in the pharmacy here (Holland). <br/>
He cannot open his eye behind it and when we take it away it epilates his fine face hairs and eyebrows and one time it even caught his (very long) eyelashes. <br/>
I cannot convince him to wear them (I would also not want them on!) and of course the promise of a brighter future means nothing to him compared to the pain of the present.<br/>
<br/>
Does anybody have any experience with this kind of eye issue? What did you do and what kind of (other) solutions did you offer? <br/>
<br/>
Thank you<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1256132937">At 4, would he like just an eye patch, like a pirate?  Here in the states<br/>
you can pick them up at the pharmacy for a small amount of money.  Perhaps<br/>
you could get some from an online store?  They are not uncomfortable (I<br/>
have worn them for various reasons) and won&#39;t stick to the tender skin<br/>
around then eye or anything else, and they are re-usable.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145856739">My daughter wore a patch for the same reason from just before her 3rd birthday until she was 4. She hated the normal stick on patches as they pulled her skin off, but the hypoallergenic ones were much less sticky and she was ok with those.<br/>
I found that putting the patch on whilst watching TV or a movie helped her forget about it, also towards the end of patching (the last few months) we promised her to take her to a toyshop to pick out something big, if she could just get through the last few months (she&#39;d had enough by this point). We also swopped to the cloth patches that go over the glasses when she was a bit older and knew that she wouldnt just take off the glasses.<br/>
That got her through it.<br/>
Her eye corrected fine and there hasn&#39;t been any problems since.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe chat with your son, try and give him as much control as possible- the type of patch, the time of day, something as a sweetener to help it along (a trip out or a favourite take away each week).<br/>

&gt; Hi everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This question is not so much about unschooling but more about a kind approach to an issue we have at the moment. <br/>
&gt; I hope it&#39;s ok?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son (almost 4) has had some issues with one of the eyes that slightly turned &quot;in&quot; when he was tired. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I went to the eye doctor and it turns out he needs glasses - and strong ones at that (+5.5 and +5). <br/>
&gt; I ordered the glasses and now he wears them most of the time,<br/>
&gt; When he does not wear the glasses, the eye that turned in is now almost always turned in.. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We just had a 3 month control and the doctor advised that I cover the good eye so that the other would get better. He also sees less with the &quot;lazy&quot; one, even with the glasses.<br/>
&gt; She advised something that looks like a plaster or a band-aid that I should stick on his good eye.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son finds it very difficult to wear that. It is the only thing that I could find in the pharmacy here (Holland). <br/>
&gt; He cannot open his eye behind it and when we take it away it epilates his fine face hairs and eyebrows and one time it even caught his (very long) eyelashes. <br/>
&gt; I cannot convince him to wear them (I would also not want them on!) and of course the promise of a brighter future means nothing to him compared to the pain of the present.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Does anybody have any experience with this kind of eye issue? What did you do and what kind of (other) solutions did you offer? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you<br/>
&gt; Ioana<br/>
