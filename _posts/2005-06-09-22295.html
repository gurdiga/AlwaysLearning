&gt; Several  times the<br/>
&gt; book has gotten closed without her place being marked. So -  maybe we<br/>
&gt; should limit the length of books she is allowed to read, because  she<br/>
&gt; really does so &quot;over&quot; react when she loses her place - it is such a<br/>
&gt; terrible source of frustration for her!  &lt;BEG&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ===========<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could require her to read to the end of a chapter, or lose her reading<br/>
&gt; privileges.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; You could take the book away from her for a week if she whimpers or cries<br/>
&gt; about losing her place.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But limiting her to very small books she can read in one sitting seems to<br/>
&gt; solve the frustration problem in the traditional fashion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-279898269">This is what I do with books too.  I usually end up skimming a few pages that I&#39;ve already read to get me back into the story.  I also do this when I read chapter books to my son, so he is seeing the example of looking through the book to find your place.  He isn&#39;t reading independently yet, so I don&#39;t know what he&#39;ll do to mark his place when he is.<br/>

I was a habitual dog-earer of corners as a child.  Bad to the bone. &lt;g&gt; (Hey, they were MY books.)  Now that I sometimes resell books, I&#39;m motivated to stop.  I&#39;ll use candy wrappers or tear off a piece of newspaper or junk mail to make my own bookmarks. (I can usually reach these w/o standing up.)   My husband keeps track of where to start by memorizing his page number, frequently by equating it to someone&#39;s batting average!  (Doesn&#39;t work much past 400 pages.)<br/>

This can be time consuming, and it you start too far forwards you can spoil yourself for upcoming events.<br/>
<br/>
I fall asleep listening to books on tape, even in the daytime, and it can be time consuming to refind the right part.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010743790">I do that too, fall asleep while listening to a book. A LOT. I listen <br/>
with an &quot;Audible Otis&quot; - it has bookmarking capabilities with the push <br/>
of a button - so as I feel myself drifting off, I push the book mark <br/>
button. That way, the next time I listen, I just go back to the last <br/>
bookmark and then only have to go forward a bit to get to where I fell <br/>
asleep..<br/>
<br/>
They no longer make the Otis and mine is old and wearing out - so I&#39;m <br/>
in the market for a new audible player/mp3 player that also plays <br/>
audible format. The bookmarking feature being super easy to use is <br/>
critical.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I do!  I read w/ my dd all the time, rarely saving my place.  Sometimes she<br/>
will tell me that I&#39;ve already read a bit, but we don&#39;t usually mind if I<br/>
do.  We can leave a story for days, and then come back to it and find where<br/>
we left off.  If it&#39;s been longer we just pick up at some point that we<br/>
both remember.<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t thought much about whether it&#39;s a good or a bad habit, it&#39;s just<br/>
what I do most often.  Sometimes I do use a bookmark and then  I have to<br/>
find my place on one of those two pages ;-)<br/>

I used to do that, when I had time to read an entire book in a matter of  <br/>
hours or days.  I use bookmarks now, because I often put a book down and  don&#39;t <br/>
get back to it for many many days.  Maybe even months.  I have  to go back and <br/>
skim the book anyway, just to remind myself what the story is  about <br/>
sometimes.  At least with a bookmark I won&#39;t skim ahead because I  can&#39;t remember the <br/>
story at all!  :)<br/>
 <br/>
My husband and son find it really frustrating to have to skim.  They  are <br/>
both slow, laborious readers (although they both enjoy reading--I just read  <br/>
differently than they do) and so skimming lessens the joy for them.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sometimes I do remember the page number, too.  I have a memory for  numbers, <br/>
though its effectiveness is waning as I get older, or maybe that I  don&#39;t have <br/>
to use it as much as I used to.<br/>
 <br/>
I also hate to mark up books.<br/>
