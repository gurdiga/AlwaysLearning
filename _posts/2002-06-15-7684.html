&gt;<br/>
&gt;A couple of years ago (so they weren&#39;t really THAT young) my kids found the<br/>
&gt;turntable and the box of records out in the garage. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My 17 yo bought a pair of used turntables for &quot;scratching&quot; the other <br/>
night.  We had exactly one LP in the house, an album from the 50s of <br/>
songs about firemen that we had in the little one&#39;s room when it was <br/>
done in a firetruck motif.  We&#39;d picked that up at a garage sale just <br/>
for the cover.  We&#39;d never listened to it, because we didn&#39;t have a <br/>
turntable.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we got that album out for him to try, and we were all ooohing <br/>
and aaahing over the equipment, putting the fancy expensive needle <br/>
cartridges on, etc.   When we were kids, we always gently placed the <br/>
needle on the record, held the record on its edges, blew the dust off, <br/>
etc.  Charles and I were appalled at the rough handling of the needles <br/>
and the album!  We talked about the differences between LPs and CDs <br/>
(mostly for the benefit of the 8 yo).  We cringed a lot during this <br/>
exploration!  lol.  That little fire truck album was only scratched in <br/>
one place, miracle of miracles.  <br/>
<br/>
Jon got himself some new albums, I noticed.  I guess he&#39;ll just have to <br/>
find out about those miracles on his own.  Considering how many CDs are <br/>
scattered on the floor of his bedroom, it won&#39;t take long!  lol.<br/>

&gt;It&#39;s Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday (etc. and four times through) <br/>

&gt;Four times through is a month.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve been singing that to Will on occasion since the first time I read <br/>
you posting about that.  About a year ago I realized that he got the <br/>
days of the week and didn&#39;t need the song anymore.  He loves to sing, <br/>
but would never sing that song.  Hearing me sing it while going <br/>
somewhere in the car seemed to help, though.<br/>

&gt;Finally, we all piled into the van, stroller and all and drove<br/>
&gt;around the neighborhood looking for something that looked familiar to the<br/>
&gt;little boy.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My mother drove a school bus when I was little (I rode with her a lot). <br/>
 One morning a little kid who had just moved in got on the bus.  My mom <br/>
greeted him and asked him which house was his and he pointed to it.  She <br/>
made a mental note to remember the yellow house in the middle of the block.<br/>
<br/>
That afternoon, she went through all the stops and he was still on the <br/>
bus, near tears.  He never saw his house, and he didn&#39;t know his new <br/>
address.  She drove him round and round the neighborhood, looking for <br/>
the yellow houses, asking &quot;is that it?&quot;, &quot;is that your car?&quot;  until <br/>
finally his worried mother waved her down.  She was standing in front of <br/>
a white house.  <br/>
<br/>
They had painted their new house while he was at school!<br/>

corner.  Their dog pissed on that sign every day for probably the last <br/>
10 years, and it finally rusted out, right at the bottom, and fell over.  <br/>

The city came out and put a new pole and sign out.  Now I live on a new <br/>
street:  Penquin Cove.  <br/>

The cove one street over has a sign that says Killdee.  I was pretty <br/>
sure that at some point in the last 50 years the R got left off, and <br/>
looking at the old subdivision maps, sho&#39; nuff.  Killdeer Cove.  :PPP<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763677575">I had used up all of the money that I  had buying the<br/>
books that the scholorship was supposed to pay for.  <br/>
The pain in my mouth was blinding.  It couldn&#39;t waite<br/>

It was only $10 to get the tooth pulled. I couldn&#39;t<br/>

out. <br/>
