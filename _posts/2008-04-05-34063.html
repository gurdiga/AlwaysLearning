<div id="ygrps-yiv-624331609">*****<br/>
this is it for me in a nutshell. I wish my childhood had been<br/>
different -- kinder, more abundant, less chaotic. I can&#39;t go back<br/>
and change that. What I can do that is healing for me is to give my<br/>
kids the childhood they deserve; the childhood every child deserves.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s why I am the kind of Mom I am, why I strive to be always kinder,<br/>
more patient, more present, more loving. I want them to look back on<br/>
their childhood with joy and good memories, to know they are loved<br/>
and valuable, and always have been. Knowing what I know, and<br/>
remembering my own childhood, I can&#39;t do things the mainstream way.<br/>
I can&#39;t punish my kids, or limit their passions, or &#39;reward&#39; them<br/>
only for being &#39;good enough.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
They are good enough every moment, even when it&#39;s not easy in that<br/>
moment to be my child&#39;s Mom. Those are the moments that call me to<br/>
be the person I want to be.<br/>

Thank You Sylvia,<br/>
This above forced me out of lurkdom and I just had to reply.This is <br/>
the most touching message for me.I would love to print your words out <br/>
and tape one copy to my refridgerator door and one copy to put under <br/>
my pillow at night to help me obsorb it.<br/>
I totally screwed up parenting my children,but I have a second chance <br/>
with my grandchildren I am helping to raise.<br/>
Thank You,<br/>
