Maybe you all can shed more light on this one.  I am perceiving this to mean that it may be too late to begin to correct and apologize for parenting mistakes and forge a better relationship with an older child.  I am perceiving this to mean too much damage has been done.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe this means an older child is (like the rest of us) at the point of having to accept and forgive his/her parents mistakes -  as most of us have had to do in our adult life.<br/>
<br/>
It just saddens me (the way I am perceiving it) because I would fall in the category of &quot;too late&quot; with my 15 year old son.  It makes me feel like HE has to pay the price for MY ignorance all these years of not knowing there was/is a better way.  I only knew how to parent as my parents parented me.  I would hate to think that just because he is closer to being out of the family than in, that he and I can&#39;t heal old wounds.<br/>
<br/>
I only began unschooling 8 weeks ago.  He will be 16 May 11th.<br/>
<br/>
However, I have already seen a shift in the way we respect each other.  A shift in the way we trust each other.  Communication has improved.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe...it really never is too late....???<br/>

<br/>
I think it&#39;s never too late to apologize and forge a better <br/>
relationship, personally.  If it was, then why bother apologizing to <br/>
teens and committing to change, just carry on the way you always did-<br/>
 after all it&#39;s &quot;too late.&quot;  What a depressing thought.<br/>
<br/>
My mother and I have gone through this process of forging a better <br/>
relationship in my adulthood, mostly through her observing and <br/>
supporting my parenting choices and feeling regret that she didn&#39;t <br/>
do some things differently.  As far as I&#39;m concerned she&#39;s more than <br/>
made up for it by being my biggest advocate and cheerleader now. <br/>
Most people I know IRL who make unconventional parenting choices <br/>
don&#39;t have anywhere near the support that I get from my mom.<br/>
It could only have been better had she discovered unschooling and <br/>
respectful parenting when I was 15 and still had years left under <br/>
her roof.  So, to me, 15 or 16 isn&#39;t necessarily too late.  Yes, the <br/>
years lost will never be back again to live and relate differently, <br/>
but you and your son can feel sadness for that and at the same time <br/>
be grateful for new beginnings, right?  <br/>

 <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I completely agree...it is never too late.  Though I would love the<br/>
opportunity to have an adult relationship with my mom (she died in 1991), I<br/>
firmly believe that 1) the things that happened in my childhood made me<br/>
stronger and 2) happened for a reason...whatever reasons those may be.  I<br/>
learned patience and unconditional love from her, I learned how to respect<br/>
others and command respect through respect...I did not learn this through<br/>
her parenting per se (she was old school and we got spanked a lot), I<br/>
learned it through watching her with other adults.  I just happened to be<br/>
perceptive enough as a child to learn those lessons second hand.  The<br/>
downfall is since I did not learn that kids deserve respect as well (are not<br/>
less than adults), I parented very much like my parents (without the<br/>
consistent spanking...though I did spank &quot;for safety&quot; and &quot;last resort&quot;).  I<br/>
was very authoritative...until I started learning about unschooling and the<br/>
entire lifestyle this year.  I am slowly educating my dh in the methods and<br/>
we are slowly mending the relationship with my 11 year old ds and hope to<br/>
have it mended for the most part before our now 15 mo old gets the &quot;product<br/>
of our old parenting style&quot; modeled for him too long.  <br/>
 <br/>
Keep doing what you are doing, parent from the heart unconditionally, live<br/>
the unschooling life and just know in your heart that your kids....newborn<br/>
to 100 will benefit from it, heck the people around you will benefit from it<br/>
as well.  You may not only change your immediate families life, you may<br/>
change many many other lives in the process...what we do/model touches more<br/>
people than you can ever know.  So don&#39;t stop with just your kids, extend<br/>
out to your parents/grandparents/everyone you know...make it a way of life<br/>
ALL THE TIME with EVERYONE.  Who knows, if we touch enough people...we might<br/>
succeed in world peace...eventually!  It all starts with you and you are the<br/>
only person you can change...others will see you living happier and through<br/>
your modeling, will choose to change (or not).  Just know you are doing the<br/>
best you can for you...and know that you have always done the best you could<br/>
with the knowledge you had at the time...learning (even about parenting) is<br/>
a life long process.  Be kind to yourself!<br/>
 <br/>
I may have got a little off topic on this one but to me its all<br/>
related...just keep on keepin on and things will work out....its never too<br/>
late!<br/>

It can be too late for unschooling to take hold instead of school  At  <br/>
sixteen, he&#39;s probably old enough to drop out of school.  Your  <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then what does &quot;it&#39;s never too late&quot; MEAN when someone is dead?<br/>
It&#39;s too late.<br/>
<br/>
In the past few weeks two children of moms I met through unschooling  <br/>
have died.  One was nine.  One was 20.  Anything those moms saved to  <br/>
do later... it&#39;s too late.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like platitudes like &quot;You know your children better than  <br/>
anyone&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re the expert when it comes to your children,&quot;  <br/>
because frankly sometimes mothers are NOT talented in any knowledge- <br/>
of-other-people way.  Sometimes they are willfully ignorant of human  <br/>
development and will swat a baby for not &quot;minding&quot; (or for crying, or  <br/>
not making it to the toilet).  They don&#39;t &quot;know their children&quot;  <br/>
better than anybody.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is thinking today, April 10, of changing the way they are,  <br/>
today&#39;s the day to do it.  Tomorrow might be too late.  This  <br/>
afternoon might be too late.<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine knew she should have unschooled.  She KNEW her kids  <br/>
hated school.  They told her so.  Teachers told her so.  She didn&#39;t  <br/>
want her routine to be disturbed, though, and she didn&#39;t want the  <br/>
responsibility, and she didn&#39;t think she could spend time with her  <br/>
kids.  So she said she would send them to elementary and when they  <br/>
got to midschool age (11, 12) she would homeschool them.  By the time  <br/>
they were that old, the relationship was shot and they liked school  <br/>
and schoolkids better than they liked their mom, and the bad  <br/>
relationships at their house had caused such friction and stress that  <br/>
the mother had told the dad to leave, at which point he did (only he  <br/>
went just as far as the storage shed and shot himself).   There was a  <br/>
point when it wasn&#39;t too late.  There were MANY points.  But there  <br/>
was a point when it was too late.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;it&#39;s never too late&quot; is true, then NOBODY needs to change, ever,  <br/>
because it&#39;s never too late.  Tomorrow is fine.  Maybe in a few years  <br/>
is fine.<br/>
<br/>
If someone is deciding whether to stop spanking and she doesn&#39;t do  <br/>
it, IT&#39;S TOO LATE to stop today.  If she spanks again Saturday and  <br/>
again on Easter because they didn&#39;t carry the eggs right, or keep  <br/>
their clothes clean, it is TOO LATE to have that week back, to have  <br/>
that peaceful laughter back.  Once a child is crying because a mother  <br/>
has been mean, it&#39;s too late for her to undo that.<br/>
<br/>
Can she do better in the very next moment?  YES, if she wants to.  If  <br/>
she has ideas about what &quot;better&quot; would be.<br/>
<br/>
When someone coos about another mother she doesn&#39;t even know and says  <br/>
&quot;Oooh, you&#39;re such a good mother; your children are lucky to have  <br/>
you,&quot; that can be just the bandaid that praised mom needs to go  <br/>
another week or two being neglectful and cruel.<br/>
<br/>
It can be too late to decide to nurse a baby.<br/>
It can be too late to decide to feed on demand.<br/>
It can be too late to practice the family bed, and pick up a baby  <br/>
every time he cries.<br/>
It can be too late to stay home with babies instead of putting them  <br/>
in daycare.<br/>
It can be too late to keep kids home instead of putting them in  <br/>
preschool.<br/>
<br/>
Something intended to simply encourage the mother of a teen that  <br/>
changing now is better than not changing at all (which is good  <br/>
encouragement, but doesn&#39;t need platitudes) runs the danger of  <br/>
encouraging the mother of a three or four year old from making moves  <br/>
NOW to avoid any more harm to the child or the relationship.<br/>

<br/>
Thank you....that was the clarification I was requesting to the original statement you said.  I understand what you mean a bit better.<br/>
<br/>
That was why it made/makes me sad.  I know I am &quot;late&quot; learning about unschooling philosophy with my soon-to-be 16 year old.  But at the same time, I will live in the moment with him and look to this group for guidance on how to talk with him about finding his way out of the damage school and my old parenting ways may have caused him.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping we can continue towards a better relationship, find fun things to do together (because I still enjoy activates with my parents) and accept each other with our faults.  <br/>
<br/>
Not to mention I have a 2 year old and trust I will do better *with* her!  :-)<br/>

&gt; This isn&#39;t to any one individual.  It&#39;s about the danger of platitudes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I completely agree...it is never too late.  Though I would love the<br/>
&gt; &gt; opportunity to have an adult relationship with my mom (she died in  <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1991)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then what does &quot;it&#39;s never too late&quot; MEAN when someone is dead?<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s too late.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the past few weeks two children of moms I met through unschooling  <br/>
&gt; have died.  One was nine.  One was 20.  Anything those moms saved to  <br/>
&gt; do later... it&#39;s too late.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t like platitudes like &quot;You know your children better than  <br/>
&gt; anyone&quot; and &quot;You&#39;re the expert when it comes to your children,&quot;  <br/>
&gt; because frankly sometimes mothers are NOT talented in any knowledge- <br/>
&gt; of-other-people way.  Sometimes they are willfully ignorant of human  <br/>
&gt; development and will swat a baby for not &quot;minding&quot; (or for crying, or  <br/>
&gt; not making it to the toilet).  They don&#39;t &quot;know their children&quot;  <br/>
&gt; better than anybody.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If someone is thinking today, April 10, of changing the way they are,  <br/>
&gt; today&#39;s the day to do it.  Tomorrow might be too late.  This  <br/>
&gt; afternoon might be too late.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A friend of mine knew she should have unschooled.  She KNEW her kids  <br/>
&gt; hated school.  They told her so.  Teachers told her so.  She didn&#39;t  <br/>
&gt; want her routine to be disturbed, though, and she didn&#39;t want the  <br/>
&gt; responsibility, and she didn&#39;t think she could spend time with her  <br/>
&gt; kids.  So she said she would send them to elementary and when they  <br/>
&gt; got to midschool age (11, 12) she would homeschool them.  By the time  <br/>
&gt; they were that old, the relationship was shot and they liked school  <br/>
&gt; and schoolkids better than they liked their mom, and the bad  <br/>
&gt; relationships at their house had caused such friction and stress that  <br/>
&gt; the mother had told the dad to leave, at which point he did (only he  <br/>
&gt; went just as far as the storage shed and shot himself).   There was a  <br/>
&gt; point when it wasn&#39;t too late.  There were MANY points.  But there  <br/>
&gt; was a point when it was too late.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If &quot;it&#39;s never too late&quot; is true, then NOBODY needs to change, ever,  <br/>
&gt; because it&#39;s never too late.  Tomorrow is fine.  Maybe in a few years  <br/>
&gt; is fine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If someone is deciding whether to stop spanking and she doesn&#39;t do  <br/>
&gt; it, IT&#39;S TOO LATE to stop today.  If she spanks again Saturday and  <br/>
&gt; again on Easter because they didn&#39;t carry the eggs right, or keep  <br/>
&gt; their clothes clean, it is TOO LATE to have that week back, to have  <br/>
&gt; that peaceful laughter back.  Once a child is crying because a mother  <br/>
&gt; has been mean, it&#39;s too late for her to undo that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Can she do better in the very next moment?  YES, if she wants to.  If  <br/>
&gt; she has ideas about what &quot;better&quot; would be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When someone coos about another mother she doesn&#39;t even know and says  <br/>
&gt; &quot;Oooh, you&#39;re such a good mother; your children are lucky to have  <br/>
&gt; you,&quot; that can be just the bandaid that praised mom needs to go  <br/>
&gt; another week or two being neglectful and cruel.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It can be too late to decide to nurse a baby.<br/>
&gt; It can be too late to decide to feed on demand.<br/>
&gt; It can be too late to practice the family bed, and pick up a baby  <br/>
&gt; every time he cries.<br/>
&gt; It can be too late to stay home with babies instead of putting them  <br/>
&gt; in daycare.<br/>
&gt; It can be too late to keep kids home instead of putting them in  <br/>
&gt; preschool.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Something intended to simply encourage the mother of a teen that  <br/>
&gt; changing now is better than not changing at all (which is good  <br/>
&gt; encouragement, but doesn&#39;t need platitudes) runs the danger of  <br/>
&gt; encouraging the mother of a three or four year old from making moves  <br/>
&gt; NOW to avoid any more harm to the child or the relationship.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This reminds me of a hurtful argument my mother and i had about me<br/>
quitting smoking last week. She really offended me by making a remark<br/>
about me leaving my children without a mother. I can see her point<br/>
better now after reading this, though i feel she could have stated<br/>
things differently and less harassingly. I have tried to quit smoking<br/>
 several times throughout the past year, and i felt she was being<br/>
harassing as though i don&#39;t realize how important it is to quit. But i<br/>
just wanted to share that i noticed this philosophy can be applied to<br/>
anything we need to do to better ourselves, not just our parenting. It<br/>
could become &quot;too late&quot; for me to quit smoking, and i think maybe<br/>
that&#39;s all my mother was trying to explain to me. I&#39;ll probably be the<br/>
bigger person and call her now that i&#39;ve realized that. Sandra, thank<br/>
you for sharing this.</div>

what she meant but you kept doing the thing anyway? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe your boys are genetically like you are.  Maybe your mom rags on  <br/>
you and you ignore her and feel harrassed, but you miss seeing the  <br/>
same dynamic with your boys.<br/>
<br/>
Cool that you&#39;ve quit smoking, though.  You&#39;ll have more money to get  <br/>
things for the kids now, and more juice boxes!<br/>
