<div id="ygrps-yiv-281893099">ok !!! <br/>
ive a 4 yr old. he is amazing.  He gets on and does his thing. cutting up paper into tiny pieces,drawing, doing playdough, playing toys, watcing tv and so on ... however ... <br/>
<br/>
ive noticed he has hammered little holes all over some walls- picture frame nails in/out is what it looks like . how would you react to this?? <br/>
obv im going to have to paint the walls to &#39;fix&#39; the &#39;mess&#39; (rented acom!)i dont even know when he did it (other than at some point today)  when i was cooking or hanging out the clothes? .. didnt hear any banging .... im puzzled! <br/>
&#39;should i&#39; just paint the walls with no comment.? <br/>
ask why he did it, and dont react? <br/>
or tell him - this is not what &#39;we do&#39;? ..... <br/>
im trying to think how my mum would have reacted ! (my dad would have flown off the handle !) my mum would have &#39;not noticed&#39; i think . she never told us off , or pointed out &#39;wrong&#39; doings just put things back how she wanted them . .... <br/>
im a half way house - i have found my self telling my son when he has done things that &#39;are wrong&#39; tho i dont feel this is &#39;right&#39; im trying to step back and think b4 i react. ... hence the ask on here. <br/>

walls.  A cardboard box, or a piece of Styrofoam works really well, and is <br/>
easy to hammer into.  Though if he&#39;s got the strength to get them into the <br/>

enjoy some pieces of scrap wood.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>In order to make better choices, he needs some kind of feedback on  <br/>
what&#39;s okay and what&#39;s not okay in life. BUT that doesn&#39;t necessarily  <br/>
mean feedbacl needs to be a lecture or pointedly telling him &quot;No,  <br/>
don&#39;t, and here&#39;s why.&quot; (Though sometimes it will.) Redirecting a  <br/>
child to something that is okay is feedback too.<br/>
<br/>
I think where you might be getting stuck is that in conventional  <br/>
parenting thinking, telling a child is a way of fixing their wrongness  <br/>
so they won&#39;t do it again.<br/>
<br/>
First I&#39;d put the hammer away. Or whatever he&#39;s using. Make the  <br/>
environment safe to explore. (Safe for him. Safe for walls.)<br/>
<br/>
Second I&#39;d be more present. (In other words, expect things to happen  <br/>
if he&#39;s alone. Don&#39;t expect rules or &quot;telling&quot; him about what&#39;s right  <br/>
and wrong to control him. Until he can do it himself, it&#39;s your  <br/>
responsibility to keep him and the house safe.)<br/>
<br/>
Third, if this is an ongoing interest rather than a one time thing,  <br/>
I&#39;d find things he *can* hammer. See the holes in the wall as his way  <br/>
of exploring something that interested him. If you stop him, that  <br/>
interest doesn&#39;t go away. And if you&#39;ve said &quot;Don&#39;t hammer walls,&quot; you  <br/>
haven&#39;t said, &quot;Don&#39;t hammer floors. Don&#39;t hammer wall tiles. Don&#39;t  <br/>
hammer the cat. Don&#39;t hammer the sliding glass doors.  <br/>
Don&#39;t ...&quot; (Well, you can see how rules don&#39;t work all that well in  <br/>
helping kids decide what they *can* do to meet a need! ;-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493253568">A bit off topic, but my son LOVED to stab cardboard boxes with a butter<br/>
knife when he was little.  Just turned it over with the bottom up, and<br/>
stabbed away.  Made my husband cringe, but it was a wonderful experience for<br/>
my son!  He also drilled a few holes in the coffee table with a hand drill,<br/>
but when I noticed and asked him not to drill into the table again, he<br/>
stopped.  Supplying wood and nails, drills, saws, etc. is usually very<br/>
welcome.  Or what about a piece of drywall from the store that he can nail<br/>
into - he might like the &#39;feel&#39; of drywall as opposed to wood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-160079937">When my oldest was 3 or 4, her grandfather set her up with large nails and some chunks of wood at his farm to keep her busy one afternoon. After that, she wanted to pound nails at home (a small apartment). Her grandfather gave her a 4&#39; long board to take home. We kept it under the couch with nails of varying sizes and a hammer. <br/>

We&#39;ve had holes and odd scrapes from rocking chairs, pets, something falling, the wind scraping things against the outside of the house... I have a wooden box my husband made me--beautiful big chest.  It has a whole bunch of little dents in the top because it travelled in the back of a truck and there was a tent pole with a rivet/bolt on it bouncing against the top as the truck went along.  I consider it &quot;distressed wood&quot; now--rather than get cranky, it has an interesting repeated pattern. :-)<br/>
<br/>
It might have been the child, but it probably wasn&#39;t malice, so at some point a layer of light spackling might be in order.   <br/>

I dont have tools/ hammers out . he doesnt know where my &#39;tool set&#39; is kept. he has his own &#39;kids tool set&#39; which is what he had used. he often used to hammer the sofa to &#39;fix it&#39; - i have no issue with that. and the floor - no issue with him hammering he floor either! but he hasnt played with his set for ages ... until yesterday !i guess he has re captured his like for &#39;fixing things&#39;  <br/>

state, about how he&#39;s viewing the world, how you might be coming across.<br/>
<br/>
What I&#39;m getting from your writing is a lot of fear and tension. You  <br/>
fear damaging his psyche. You fear not correcting him. He&#39;s picking  <br/>
that up. I&#39;d guess he was embarrassed and uncertain about your  <br/>
uncertainty and he felt the safest option was a lie.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  i have no issue with that. and the floor - no issue with him  <br/>
&gt; hammering he floor either!<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is a &quot;yes, okay to hammer&quot; and what is a &quot;no, not okay to hammer&quot;  <br/>
is clear in your mind. But to him it will seem arbitrary. (How are  <br/>
floors different from walls? And what about a door?) And if he goes to  <br/>
someone else&#39;s house, the lines may be drawn differently.<br/>
<br/>
Some things in life are nos. Some are yeses. It won&#39;t damage a child&#39;s  <br/>
psyche to point out the nos. Like, in this case, damaging things that  <br/>
aren&#39;t disposable. (But you don&#39;t need to list them all ;-) By 4 he  <br/>
knows the difference between permanent and disposable. Though, to make  <br/>
that statement more general, some 4 yos will be more focused on the  <br/>
process than the outcome. That&#39;s their personality and it means mom  <br/>
needs to be more present to do lots of redirecting until they&#39;re older  <br/>
and can be more aware! :-)<br/>
<br/>
See the nos and yeses as *information* for help him figure out the  <br/>
rules of the world and to help him make better choices.<br/>
<br/>
You can approach it very simply with &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a no. Let&#39;s find some  <br/>
things that are okay to hammer.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s all about the child and needs he&#39;s trying to meet. Help him make  <br/>
better choices in meeting his needs by giving him feedback on choices  <br/>
that weren&#39;t so great and providing options that are better.<br/>

Maybe he fibbed because he was afraid.<br/>
Maybe he fibbed because he&#39;s just experimenting with that idea of &quot;truth,&quot; because four year olds are surrounded by make-believe.<br/>
Maybe he fibbed because he didn&#39;t want to see you sad.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t think so much about that.<br/>

The way you handle this will affect the next time.  You can&#39;t &quot;fix it&quot; once and for all, but you can make it better or worse.<br/>

He probably feels bad and that feeling is what will prevent future occurences.  <br/>
Reassure him you love him, find something he can pound a bit, and be happy.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s liking indentations, it might be fun for him to play with coins and aluminum foil, or aluminum foil and a pencil--anything he can mark it with, or put under it and press the shape into.  It&#39;s much quieter than hammering, and safer.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047908712">-=- and the floor - no issue with him hammering he floor either! but he hasnt played with his set for ages ...-=-<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a rental house, and it&#39;s a plastic hammer, no problem.<br/>
If it&#39;s ANY house and he&#39;s just randomly beating on ANY floor with a real hammer, that&#39;s not a good idea.  Though I&#39;d let him help me take up my warped bathroom floor in a few weeks if he were here. :-)  I wouldn&#39;t want him to hit the downstairs concrete floor, though.  Too hard to repair!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1975998084">He would lie to not disappoint you. I&#39;m sure it was obvious to him that what he had done was wrong when you asked him about it. In my experience, the best way to avoid these types of things is to not ask a question you already know the answer to. You already knew he made the holes. An alternative would have been to say &quot;I know you love hammering, but don&#39;t want holes in my [whatever it was]...let&#39;s find something else to hammer&quot;. It tells him you are unhappy with the holes, without implying there&#39;s something wrong with him and the results in you helping him find a less damaging outlet for his interest.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really a hard habit to break, but I&#39;d really encourage you not to &quot;set up&quot;/provide an opportunity to lie. There are many times in interactions with our kids where you can think about how you&#39;d treat a friend who goofed up or made a mistake. Asking her a question you already know the answer to would be condescending and a bit passive aggressive.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an alternative:<br/>
Just observe the error and make a brief observational comment about it: &quot;I see holes hammered in my table - I don&#39;t want holes in my table&quot;<br/>
Validate: &quot;I know you love hammering&quot;<br/>
Provide a solution yourself, or in collaboration if the child is able: &quot;let&#39;s go find some scrap wood for you to make holes in&quot;<br/>
Give the child ( if old/capable enough) an opportunity to try to fix the problem by either asking for ideas to fix it or to let them participate in a solution you know of: &quot;we can go to the store to look for wood filler to fix the holes and you can help me fix this if you want&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure I got this framework from the book &quot;how to talk so kids will listen and listen so kids will talk&quot;. I&#39;ve read a lot over the last 6 years and the origin of these ideas can get lost or mixed up. Regardless, it&#39;s a great book.<br/>
<br/>
We still sometimes find ourselves, frequently in mid sentence, asking our kids things we already know. We&#39;ve both had to break the habit. We originally thought that a kid would not lie if there wasn&#39;t going to be punishment but found that not to be true... to many kids, your disappointment or disapproval is an unpleasant  outcome of their error that they may try to avoid.<br/>

<br/>
We had company, and a little girl who&#39;s three or four (Zoya, for those who know her; she&#39;s VERY sweet) had marked on a wooden fence-like divider we have inside (hard to describe, but it separates the stairs from the front room, and is white-painted wood).  More than one color, and so we had ignored her long enough that she had some time for art.  I went to get cleaning supplies and mentioned softly to her parents that she had written there but I was just going to clean it off.  One of them asked her if she had done that, and she said no, but she beamed a big innocent smile. <br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t mind.  I kind of missed having little kids, and our house isn&#39;t fancy.  <br/>
<br/>
So I have a bottle of spray 409 or something, and paper towels.  She watched me wipe off the first mark, and then said she wanted to do that.  She wanted to help me.  So I let her do most of the rest of it, because she was having fun.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t say anything like &quot;Don&#39;t do that again.&quot;  She saw the preferences of people around her, and they were all being nice to her, so it wouldn&#39;t have made much sense for her to have done it again.  I made sure there was paper out next to the markers, and didn&#39;t make a deal out of it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-18824928">When my son MD was 2 years old and a huge Bob the Builder fan we gave him many toy tool sets and one<br/>
time while walking in a big hardware store we saw this little hammer. It was a small hammer  that was real but perfect size for him and he loved it.<br/>
So he carried this hammer everywhere. <br/>
We live in the farm so lots of safe places to bang on things. As it got cold I had Styrofoam and soft wood and many wood kits for him to hammer<br/>
and build! I have awesome pictures of him doing so.<br/>
One day he goes and starts hammering ( fixing) the chair rail in my family room. He missed and made this hole the size of fist in the wall.<br/>
OOPs!!!!<br/>
Where was I? Busy and not present. <br/>
 It took me years to fix it. I have pictures of it. I got him some stuff to fix and showed him how the wall was not wood and would break. He wanted to fix like Bob the Builder.  I got some old furniture that he could fix ! He wanted real things.<br/>
I fixed the whole last year when I painted my family room. <br/>

The fact that you took the truth without recriminations should probably<br/>
help to curb the lack of truth telling.<br/>
<br/>
I still think that if you got the stuff that is just pushed into the hole<br/>
with a finger (it is like toothpaste) then your son would enjoy helping<br/>
with fixing the holes.  If he wanted to at least....<br/>

and look at options and then try to imagine &quot;what would happen, if....&quot;.<br/>
It was amazing how much actually telling a child that they could choose<br/>
what they did and that how they felt was okay, no matter what the feeling<br/>
was, could improve their outlook and even behavior.  Unfortunately, many<br/>
other therapists just laughed at me.... they really couldn&#39;t grasp the idea<br/>
that a child needed a sense of personal power, even in situations that they<br/>
had no real control over.  I helped them see that they could control<br/>
themselves and learn how to get the most out of the system that they landed<br/>
in through no fault of their own.<br/>
