In a story I&#39;m writing, the character has seen a UFO drop down beyond  <br/>
the trees. (Not exactly what happens in the story but way easier to  <br/>

standing in front of a house and wants to tell someone over the phone  <br/>
the angle it is from the house. If she had a compass she could say it  <br/>
on a line that&#39;s on an angle of 65 degrees from the house. (Or  <br/>
however it&#39;s expressed.) She doesn&#39;t have a compass, but she does  <br/>
have a friend with a GPS in her car. The person she calls is going to  <br/>
use Google maps to find the territory to search in and then  <br/>
physically search outward from the house along that line for the UFO.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve only briefly seen a GPS in a car so I don&#39;t really know what  <br/>
kind of information you can get from them. I was picturing angling  <br/>
the car to point in the direction the UFO went down, but don&#39;t know  <br/>
if that&#39;s necessary.<br/>
<br/>
So what would she be able to pass on over the phone to help the  <br/>
person start searching for the UFO?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Nope, that&#39;s just a point which she can get from the address. She  <br/>
needs a line. And two points define a line. She doesn&#39;t know where on  <br/>
that line the second point is but she can see the angle of the line.  <br/>
But she needs some piece of data so someone else can recreate the  <br/>
line on a map. (She can&#39;t speak to him directly. She needs to leave  <br/>
it in a message.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a real life (well it could be!) geometry application. :-)<br/>

you want ;-)<br/>
<br/>
So she could find the angle on the map of the GPS. Then she drag and  <br/>
zoom in to find another point on the line. Can the GPS system give  <br/>
her the coordinates of that point?<br/>
