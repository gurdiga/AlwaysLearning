<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271536456">I know you know of them (there is some reference in the amazing reference <br/>
site that is sandradodd.com), but Cargo Cults are such a cool way of looking <br/>
at belief.<br/>
<br/>
Looking for a population that I can only vaguely remember I found an article <br/>
by Robert Sapolsky on how environment defines belief: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.arthurmag.com/magpie/?p=797">http://www.arthurmag.com/magpie/?p=797</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a quote:<br/>
Begin with religious beliefs. A striking proportion of rain forest dwellers <br/>
are polytheistic, worshipping an array of spirits and gods. Polytheism is <br/>
prevalent among tribes in the Amazon basin (the Sherenti, Mundurucu, and <br/>
Tapirape) and in the rain forests of Africa (the Ndorobo), New Guinea (the <br/>
Keraki and Ulawans), and Southeast Asia (the Iban of Borneo and the Mnong <br/>
Gar and Lolo of Vietnam). But desert dwellers-the bedouin of Arabia, the <br/>
Berbers of the western Sahara, the !Kung of the Kalahari Desert, the Nuer <br/>
and Turkana of the Kenyan/Sudanese desert-are usually monotheistic. Of <br/>
course, despite allegiances to a single deity, other supernatural beings may <br/>
be involved, like angels and djinns and Satan. But the hierarchy is notable, <br/>
with minor deities subservient to the Omnipotent One.<br/>
<br/>
This division makes ecological sense. Deserts teach large, singular lessons, <br/>
like how tough, spare, and withholding the environment is; the world is <br/>
reduced to simple, desiccated, furnace-blasted basics. Then picture rain <br/>
forest people amid an abundance of edible plants and medicinal herbs, able <br/>
to identify more species of ants on a single tree than one would find in all <br/>
the British Isles. Letting a thousand deities bloom in this sort of setting <br/>
must seem natural. Moreover, those rain forest dwellers that are <br/>
monotheistic are much less likely to believe that their god sticks his or <br/>
her nose into other people&#39;s business by controlling the weather, prompting <br/>
illness, or the like. In contrast, the desert seems to breed fatalism, a <br/>
belief in an interventionist god with its own capricious plans.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh, and wandering through The TED one day I found an excerpt of Julia <br/>
Sweeney&#39;s solo performance &quot;Letting Go of God&quot; which is an interesting look <br/>
at her own faith: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/86">http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/86</a><br/>

<br/>
&quot;The hallmark of Aboriginal culture is &#39;oneness with nature&#39;. In traditional <br/>
Aboriginal belief systems, nature and landscape are comparable in importance <br/>
to the bible in Christian culture. Prominent rocks, canyons, rivers, <br/>
waterfalls, islands, beaches and other natural features - as well as sun, <br/>
moon, visible stars and animals - have their own stories of creation and <br/>
inter-connectedness. To the traditional Aborigine they are all sacred: <br/>
environment is the essence of Australian Aboriginal godliness.&quot;<br/>

About Aborigine spirituality, including a lot about the concept of the <br/>
Dreaming (scroll down):<br/>

<br/>
&quot;The Dreamtime or Dreaming is often used to describe the time when the earth <br/>
and humans and animals were created. The Dreaming is also used by <br/>
individuals to refer to their own dreaming or their community&#39;s dreaming.<br/>
<br/>
During the Dreaming, ancestral spirits came to earth and created the <br/>
landforms, the animals and plants. The stories tell how the ancestral <br/>
spirits moved through the land creating rivers, lakes and mountains. Today <br/>
we know the places where the ancestral spirits have been and where they came <br/>
to rest. There are explanations of how people came to Australia and the <br/>
links between the groups throughout Australia. There are explanations about <br/>
how people learnt languages and dance and how they came to know about fire.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486740196">There are two religions I think of as &quot;religions of thoughts/ideas&quot; - Taoism and Confucianism.  Neither have deities to worship, but have concepts to follow. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tao&quot; is translated as &quot;The Way&quot; which means there is an &quot;underlying spiritual force of the universe, which is present in all things, yet greater than all things&quot; (from Usborne Encyclopedia of World Religions).  There&#39;s a link here <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/yp3f77">http://tinyurl.com/yp3f77</a> which explains Tao concepts.  (I&#39;ve always thought some aspects of Taoism and unschooling were similar.  Taoism&#39;s &quot;Wu Wei&quot; says that one must act naturally without interfering with the process of life - nothing should be forced and one should not attempt to control events.)<br/>
<br/>
Confucianism began as advice for the Chinese emperors.  Many of Confucious&#39;s sayings speak to correct behavior and avoiding extreme emotions to keep balance and harmony; it&#39;s more about good citizenship.  Confucianism does include the worship of ancestors that you mentioned, Sandra, and reverence for family.  This link mentions his founding of (basically) a public school: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/29tm5n">http://tinyurl.com/29tm5n</a><br/>

Related, yet unrelated.  Unschooling and schooling.  Huh!<br/>

existence The John Frum Movement (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frum)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Frum)</a> <br/>
which worships John Frum. They believe that John Frum will come back someday <br/>
and bring them cargo. I found someone&#39;s description of visiting the John <br/>
Frum community who said that they can get John Frum to come more quickly by <br/>
looking more like a militry base and by singing songs that reference things <br/>
going on in the U.S. There is another cult called the Prince Philip <br/>
Movement, apparently a splinter group of the John Frum group. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.tiny.cc/0TCB5">http://www.tiny.cc/0TCB5</a><br/>
<br/>
I suppose just like any other religion they are praying for favor from an <br/>
individual. The cool thing is that it is based on actual evidence of favor. <br/>
Cargo did come. They did get something falling from the skies. There was <br/>
manna from heaven. Of course they hadn&#39;t done anything to court that favor, <br/>
so it is a bit of the having the cart before the horse.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I find cool about Cargo Cults, they are sort of a window into <br/>
how a random event could create a religion.<br/>
