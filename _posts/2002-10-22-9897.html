<div id="ygrps-yiv-135968452">My kids just started brownies and scouts. They needed to find some friends in the area so we decided to give it a go. I didn&#39;t expect that it would be for us but we love it so far. Two reasons that we were avoiding the cult :~) was that we believed it was too Christian for us and that I&#39;d heard somewhere that it was not gay friendly. Generally, I&#39;m not keen on religion as I find it divisive in nature and so not spiritual in the way I understand spirituality. On the other hand the group promotes all of the qualities that make a society inclusive and supportive. Daisy is an elf and elves think of others before themselves :~), the sentiment is wonderful. Anyway, I don&#39;t know about the gay issue and the boy scouts. We do not want to be involved or support anything that&#39;s not gay friendly. What&#39;s your take on this issue, as I assume you and Beth are lesbians, and if not you would probably be able to answer my question anyway.<br/>
