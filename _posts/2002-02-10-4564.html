<div id="ygrps-yiv-527030394">I&#39;ve not been on this list long.. and tend to be a &#39;lurker&#39; anyway. I want<br/>
to say how thankful I am to be able to &#39;listen in&#39;.. I must admit that for<br/>
the past 3 or 4 years.. I really thought we were true unschoolers..but after<br/>
the lastest discussions concerning tv and food. I realized we are not. But I<br/>
think there might still be hope for us!  I may not ever be quite as &#39;free&#39;<br/>
as some.. but you all are definately an inspiration and do make me think and<br/>
consider the hows and whys in my life.<br/>
It&#39;s just so funny, because in my small hm&#39;school circle.. &quot;I am&quot; considered<br/>
the radical..LOL!!<br/>
