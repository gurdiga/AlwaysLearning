&lt;&lt;  Can&#39;t sleep with him in my bed though.  Tiffany and Mariah sleep there <br/>
with me, but I&#39;ll invite him to camp out on the floor, or put the baby on the <br/>
futon for as long as she&#39;ll sleep there and have him in bed.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could lie down with him in his bed until he goes to sleep, or let <br/>
the girls sleep on one side and him on the other?<br/>
<br/>
If everyone&#39;s sleeping with you except him, that could be part of the deal.  <br/>
I know Kirby missed sleeping next to me when Holly was born.  We got a two <br/>
down and one on top bunk bed, but he was still on the top by himself.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t have a good solution, but it wasn&#39;t good for him OR me or our <br/>
relationship for him to be eliminated.<br/>
<br/>
Once when Marty was a baby and nursing and I was sleeping between them Kirby <br/>
(3) said, &quot;Why does Marty get the soft side of you all the time and I get the <br/>
hard bony side?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Would he have any interest in sleeping with his dad?<br/>

<br/>
Nope, got one more, Shaina 10 years old, who sleeps in her own room next door to him.  My husband used to sleep in Adam&#39;s room, but does not anymore. <br/>
<br/>
When Adam was born, we all slept cross wise in a king sized bed.  Adam first, against the headboard, them me, then Shaina and Tiffany.  My feet hung off, but those are great memories! <br/>
<br/>
I want a bed like the one in the movie Arthur!<br/>
<br/>
I love what Kirby said about your soft and bony sides!  Very cute, but it also points out that as parents, as hard as we try to do our best, sometimes it is not enough.  Or the child is perceiving it differently.<br/>

Me too nowadays.  I picked up the belt/sash from my wedding dress the other <br/>
day.  It wasn&#39;t with the rest of the dress.  I made the mistake of holding it <br/>

Me too! I love BIG beds.  A few years ago I attempted to design a homemade<br/>
bed that would fill a whole room, with lots of pillows. I never got it<br/>
completely worked out tho.<br/>
<br/>
During the first few years of marriage we lived in 1 bedroom apartments.<br/>
When Max was born and Sam was 3yo we had a double bed, a cradle, and a<br/>
toddler bed side by side in a very small room.  We actually had to step over<br/>
the corner of the double bed to get to the bathroom.  All the beds were<br/>
close to the floor so when I needed to breastfeed max I just rolled over and<br/>
lifted him into our bed.  This was great because I had a c-section and<br/>
getting up and down in the bed really hurt at first.  When we tell the kids<br/>
how we used to live when they were young they cannot believe it.<br/>
<br/>
Now we have a 4 bedroom townhome.  Max sometimes will sleep on our bedroom<br/>
floor if he wants to.  Sam likes her space and always sleeps in her room.<br/>
We have a king size bed now, very comfy.  But our very large dog sleeps with<br/>
us and once he is asleep no one but me can make him move.  So hubby gets<br/>
frustrated about that sometimes. He&#39;s been known to say &quot;It&#39;s either me or<br/>
the dog!&quot; hahaha  Then the dog gets the floor.  :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90810566">Tutoring Gives Pupils an Edge . . . for Preschool<br/>
<br/>
July 31, 2002<br/>
By MAREK FUCHS <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sophie Spencer, 5 and headed to kindergarten in the fall,<br/>
has a tutor. <br/>
<br/>
Sophie does not need remedial work, which involves catching<br/>
up or addressing learning disabilities and is the more<br/>
traditional form of tutoring for a child her age. <br/>
<br/>
But she had shown great interest in reading and writing,<br/>
and her mother, Suzanne Spencer, who lives in East Hampton,<br/>
N.Y., thought that an hour a week with a reading specialist<br/>
would help Sophie along her way. <br/>
<br/>
Aiming to give their young children a jump-start on their<br/>
academic experience, parents are having them work with<br/>
private tutors. The goal is to have the children enter<br/>
school with a toehold on reading. <br/>
<br/>
Such private tutoring, which costs $75 to $150 an hour, is<br/>
a cottage industry, with many tutors working on their own,<br/>
so there are no accurate industry numbers. But educators,<br/>
tutors and parents in well-to-do areas say the trend is<br/>
growing. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nonremedial tutoring for children entering school is a<br/>
relatively new phenomenon,&quot; said Arthur Levine, the<br/>
president of Teachers College at Columbia University, &quot;but<br/>
like every type of tutoring, it is growing. Anything<br/>
parents can do to give their children an edge, they are<br/>
interested in.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
The trend is especially strong in Manhattan, Dr. Levine<br/>
said, where the private school application process is so<br/>
competitive. &quot;Once upon a time, parents prepared their<br/>
children for the best university,&quot; he said. &quot;Now they<br/>
prepare them for the best preschool.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But such tutoring elicits sharp divisions on the questions<br/>
of whether it is effective or appropriate. One side<br/>
contends it is no different from sending a child to a<br/>
gymnastics class to learn to do a handspring, and at the<br/>
very least can do no harm. The other side sees it as<br/>
emblematic of a society that seems to be putting undue<br/>
pressure on children even as it farms out parental duties. <br/>
<br/>
For Mrs. Spencer, Sophie&#39;s tutoring has been a success.<br/>
Sophie&#39;s tutor is her former nursery school teacher, who is<br/>
also a reading specialist. Mrs. Spencer said that she and<br/>
her husband still read to Sophie and that the arrangement<br/>
had not put undue pressure on her. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I wouldn&#39;t want to put her in a class every day,&quot; said<br/>
Mrs. Spencer, adding that in the summer, an hour a week was<br/>
plenty of time &quot;to supplement what I&#39;m doing with her and<br/>
encourage her.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
In Chappaqua, N.Y., Linda Silbert runs the Strong Learning<br/>
Center, a private tutoring business, which focuses mainly<br/>
on remedial tutoring but also does nonremedial work. It<br/>
charges $75 an hour for instruction in its offices and $85<br/>
if the tutor travels to the child&#39;s house. Dr. Silbert said<br/>
that nonremedial tutoring could be helpful in two<br/>
particular circumstances. When a child has advanced reading<br/>
skills, a private tutor can help tailor a challenging<br/>
program that keeps the student interested in reading. &quot;We<br/>
have a 5-year-old student who is reading on a fourth-grade<br/>
level, but with such a higher cognitive level, was bored in<br/>
school,&quot; she said. &quot;We were able to put together a program<br/>
for her, and it&#39;s hard for a child like that to reach their<br/>
optimal level unless you have one-on-one tutoring.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Dr. Silbert also said that many parents were drawn to early<br/>
tutoring to pick up signs of problems. If a young child is<br/>
taught under close supervision, potential problems can be<br/>
identified and dealt with, which could head off larger ones<br/>
or a loss of confidence once school starts, she said. <br/>
<br/>
Sarah Chamlin tutors privately in Manhattan and Westchester<br/>
County. She frequently receives calls inquiring about<br/>
nonremedial tutoring for prekindergartners. But if there<br/>
are no disabilities involved, she does not take the work. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The impetus,&quot; she said, &quot;comes from so many parents being<br/>
so concerned about getting kids ready for high-powered<br/>
systems. They say, `What does it mean that my child is not<br/>
reading? I know that there are others out there who are.&#39; &quot;<br/>
But, she added, such tutoring &quot;is a waste, even if it&#39;s<br/>
done in a quote unquote fun way.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
For one thing, she said, there is a stigma attached to<br/>
receiving summer tutoring that all children, even young<br/>
ones, can feel. &quot;Even if you say, `Mrs. J is coming over<br/>
and you will have so much fun reading,&#39; kids know what&#39;s<br/>
going on,&quot; she said. &quot;They say, `Oh my God, what&#39;s wrong<br/>
with me? Why do I have to go to a tutor in the summer?<br/>
Billy isn&#39;t going.&#39; It&#39;s very hard for kids who need<br/>
tutoring to come to terms with it, let alone those who<br/>
don&#39;t.&quot; If remedial tutoring is needed later in the child&#39;s<br/>
academic career, &quot;it can be complete burnout by then,&quot; she<br/>
said. <br/>
<br/>
Some parents, Mrs. Chamlin said, look to early tutoring to<br/>
compensate for the hours they spend at work. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Working parents might not feel that they can give their<br/>
children what a tutor can,&quot; she said. &quot;But, in fact, they<br/>
can. All you need is 20 minutes, a half-hour a day to read<br/>
to a child, and that will get them reading.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
But Mark Pingitore, the director of the Tompkins Square<br/>
Middle School on the Lower East Side, said that private<br/>
tutoring might give children an advantage, as well as send<br/>
a beneficial message. &quot;It can show them,&quot; he said &quot;that the<br/>
parents value education.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Pam Wershba-Gershan, the lower school psychologist at the<br/>
Little Red Schoolhouse in Greenwich Village, said that<br/>
nonremedial tutoring was not something she would<br/>
particularly recommend, especially if it came at the<br/>
expense of recreation. That is not to say it does not work,<br/>
she added. Such tutoring could help by providing a<br/>
structure for children to explore literature, words and<br/>
print. As they become ready to read, she said, the children<br/>
are likely to jump into the structure and thrive. <br/>
<br/>
Mrs. Spencer also sees an advantage in the fact that her<br/>
daughter &quot;is hearing she&#39;s doing really well from someone<br/>
who is not a parent.&quot; This summer&#39;s tutoring has even<br/>
expanded into math, which she said Sophie was enjoying too.<br/>
If, in the fall, Sophie already knows what is being taught,<br/>
she can involve herself in something else in the classroom,<br/>
Mrs. Spencer said. And even if the school&#39;s reading<br/>
strategy does not suit Sophie&#39;s learning style, she will<br/>
still have the skills in hand. <br/>
<br/>
Referring to the debate over such approaches to reading as<br/>
whole language and phonics, David Leonard, the associate<br/>
director of the Child Development Institute at Sarah<br/>
Lawrence College in Yonkers, said: &quot;The reading wars have<br/>
given some parents battle fatigue. They are anxious and<br/>
confused about what is happening in the schools with these<br/>
literacy fads that come and go.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
If this is the case, he said, &quot;and they can find a tutoring<br/>
program that approaches reading in a way they like, then<br/>
I&#39;m probably in the camp that it can do no harm.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
That said, Mr. Leonard added that some parents had been<br/>
affected by the fact that the reading wars had created a<br/>
more complicated, and commercially competitive, sense of<br/>
what it takes to learn reading. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;On television,&quot; he said, &quot;we see beaming actors who play<br/>
parents say that their 3 1/2-year-old reads four books a<br/>
day, thanks to this method or that. It&#39;s put a lot of<br/>
parents under constant pressure.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
&quot;It makes the parent feel better,&quot; he added, &quot;to be able to<br/>
say, my child is getting tutoring so that they can read so<br/>
many words in 10 minutes or so many books, rather than have<br/>
to say that their child seems to enjoy thumbing through<br/>
books and they&#39;re pretty sure that their reading ability<br/>
will sort of come together.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
To allay the pressure parents feel, Mrs. Chamlin tells<br/>
parents who call for prekindergarten tutoring that, from<br/>
what she sees, 90 percent of the children will be reading<br/>
by the end of the school year. &quot;If not,&quot; she tells them,<br/>
&quot;then call me.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
And Mr. Leonard said there were no substitutes for the old<br/>
standbys: imaginative play, drawing, storytelling and the<br/>
endless reading of books on the couch and before bedtime.<br/>
He has two daughters and between them, he said, they did<br/>
not receive &quot;30 seconds of nonremedial tutoring.&quot; But they<br/>
both grew into avid readers. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;I just figured that if it was a good enough method for<br/>
Thomas Jefferson, it was good enough for my daughters,&quot; he<br/>
said. <br/>
