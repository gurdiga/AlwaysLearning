<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589079916">I&#39;d like to explore the topic of cheat codes.  Our family uses them often <br/>
and we choose to view them as &#39;helps&#39; or &#39;special codes to create more fun&#39;. <br/>
We know a family who does not believe in cheat codes and this has spilled <br/>
over into the childrens conversations regarding cheating, dishonesty, and <br/>
not &#39;truly&#39; winning the game if a person uses them. These conversations are <br/>
becoming more and more heated.  I&#39;ve explained to both children that the <br/>
cheat code conversation can be like religion - you can agree to disagree. <br/>
These conversations have caused Tails to ask me more and more questions <br/>
about my opinions on cheat codes.  I tell her I use them and I don&#39;t have a <br/>
problem using them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not asking for any advice on how to deal with the kiddo situation <br/>
(handled), but more for personal opinions to expand my viewpoint on cheat <br/>
codes so that I can give Tails different opinions regarding them.  I&#39;m <br/>
hoping that by giving her more information that she can feel comfortable in <br/>
whatever decision she chooses.   Right now, I&#39;m seeing that these <br/>
conversations have made her question herself.<br/>

<br/>
Most board games  have more than one version of play.  You can play  <br/>
Monopoly without mortgaging things.  You can play cribbage or poker  <br/>
without betting money.  When you play rummy, Aces can be 5 points if  <br/>
played as a 1, or 15 points.  People just decide before they start  <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
I think the problem is the word &quot;cheat.&quot;   But a video game isn&#39;t  <br/>
entrance exams to Cambridge.  A video game isn&#39;t even federal income  <br/>
tax, and lots of people cheat on income taxes if they can figure out  <br/>
a way, and &quot;legal tax loopholes&quot; are like cheats you need to research  <br/>
or pay professionals to find for you.<br/>
<br/>
How could one &quot;cheat&quot; a single player video game?  Out of WHAT?<br/>
<br/>
We owned a stand-up arcade game years ago, and just used to leave it  <br/>
unlocked and click the counter up to 99 once in a while.  People  <br/>
played for free.  Was that &quot;Cheating&quot;?  Were we going to charge our  <br/>
friends a quarter to play a game!??<br/>
<br/>
Some of the &quot;cheat codes&quot; are codes programmers use to test the parts  <br/>
of the game they&#39;re working on, so a guy who&#39;s building the end part  <br/>
of some portion of the game doesn&#39;t have to play up to it (or his  <br/>
beta testers don&#39;t have to play up to that point, they can just start  <br/>
there).  It&#39;s not &quot;cheating,&quot; except it&#39;s a different place to start  <br/>
the game.<br/>
<br/>
Backgammon  starts with pieces already on the board, in a certain  <br/>
formation.  There&#39;s another game played with the same pieces and  <br/>
board called &quot;Acey-Deucey,&quot; and the pieces start off the board.  So  <br/>
is backgammon a &quot;cheat code&quot; version of &quot;acey deucy&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Keith points out that most games, and backgammon particularly so,  <br/>
were gambling games.  Gambling is calmly accepted in England. In the  <br/>
U.S.  it&#39;s one of the puritanical sins, and so that might also add to  <br/>
the &quot;cheat code&quot; prejudice in some people.  It goes against hard work  <br/>
to reach a goal.<br/>
<br/>

That might be a good read for this topic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747271176">When Dave and I were growing up with video games (Pong, Atari,  <br/>
Intellivision, etc.), there were no cheat codes-at least not that we&#39;ve ever  heard of. So, <br/>
when Nintendo got popular and companies started producing cheat  cartridges, <br/>
it was kind of bizarre.<br/>
 <br/>
In my years of videogaming before our kids came along, I  refused to use <br/>
cartridges or codes the first time through a game. There was one  (Populous) that <br/>
I had either finished or almost finished that I had to  leave on all the time, <br/>
because it didn&#39;t save progress. It also skipped many  levels, depending on <br/>
your score, when you finished a level. When I found a code  for that one, it <br/>
let me shut the game off and start up again next time from  where I left off (I <br/>
think 1000 levels, so we&#39;re talking many hours of play,  here), minus the <br/>
score-which I didn&#39;t really care about. It also allowed me go  to back through and <br/>
play it over again playing each level instead of skipping  them. It made my <br/>
gameplay fuller and more challenging, rather than annoying or  boring or quick.<br/>
 <br/>
Since my kids have been born, I just don&#39;t have the time to  immerse myself <br/>
in a game the way I used to, so I sometimes take advantage of  cheat codes or <br/>
(more often) walkthroughs, to zip through those parts that I know  I could <br/>
accomplish without help, but it makes it much quicker. I often play  open-ended <br/>
games where there might be a lot of searching for the next clue or  person you <br/>
need to talk to or item that needs found, so a walkthrough helps me  skip the <br/>
long hours of searching.<br/>
 <br/>
Wyl, 9, loves looking up help on the computer. Sometimes, he  prefers to do <br/>
it himself, but sometimes he has a goal he&#39;s aiming for and the  codes or <br/>
walkthroughs get him past the &quot;small&quot; (to him), and sometimes the  frustration is <br/>
too much and a code or walk through will end the frustrating  part, so he can <br/>
move on.<br/>
 <br/>
Isn&#39;t that kind of like picking up the house or some  big thing that is <br/>
easier done with help? If my kids asked me to help them  clean up something and I <br/>
couldn&#39;t do it, I&#39;d try to find something or someone  who could help them. With <br/>
video games, I can often help them (and do, much to  their admiration), but <br/>
when I can&#39;t, I find someone who can with a code or walk  through or tip or <br/>
even playing it to get them over a hump or to a place they  want to be.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2110108272">For a long time Jayn wanted me to play an X-Box game, Haunted Mansion, for <br/>
her. She just liked to watch the game play. It was often very frustrating <br/>
for me because so much of it was finger drills on the controller, and much <br/>
less of it was mental puzzle. I prefer the latter. That darn Zeke kept <br/>
getting dead. Then I found the code for immortality and I was able to learn <br/>
the tricks of each room (it&#39;s a great really long game) and fight the big <br/>
monsters and learn the tricks for that, and eventually get to the end - to <br/>
Jayn&#39;s delight.<br/>
<br/>
So for me the code was a very useful learning tool. Plus I can play the game <br/>
again without it if I want the challenge of saving Zeke - it seems to be <br/>
about reaction time to avoid dying, and finding all the secret cards which <br/>
give lives hidden in the rooms.<br/>
<br/>
There are times when I am playing a game with a lot of &quot;walking around&quot; when <br/>
I wish for a code that will let my jump from location to location. I think <br/>
it&#39;s OK to skip the boring parts! Is it cheating to skip the commercials in <br/>
your recorded tv show or jump over the previews in a dvd? Right now I&#39;m <br/>
playing a Wii game that has a diabolically difficult safe to open with tiny, <br/>
s-l-o-w motions of the remote. I&#39;d love a code.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846241340">One way to think of it is that if cheat codes were so wrong, they <br/>
wouldn&#39;t exist. Secondly, I enjoy cheat codes, especially in games <br/>
like the SIMS where they allow me to be super-creative without <br/>
restrictions. Some like them, others don&#39;t...a case of &quot;to each their own&quot;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552284091">I remember using a cheat code on the sims to get enormous amounts of<br/>
money and for me it just wasn&#39;t fun.  I haven&#39;t used them since that<br/>
time because I think that part of what enjoy is the challenge of the<br/>
game.  Games are supposed to be fun and if it is more fun to use a<br/>
code, then use it.  You aren&#39;t hurting anyone else, you are just<br/>
making it a slightly different game that is more enjoyable for you.<br/>
<br/>
If she uses the cheat codes to beat the game and her friends didn&#39;t<br/>
they may say she didn&#39;t really beat the game.  And, in a way, she<br/>
didn&#39;t.  She beat a slightly different game that she enjoyed more.<br/>
She didn&#39;t do the same thing that they did and it is ok for them to be<br/>
proud of what they did and to think that it isn&#39;t the same as using a<br/>
code.  They aren&#39;t the same thing, but they are both fine.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-189691093">Cheat codes are awesome. I can beat the original super mario bros in<br/>
like 10 minutes if I use the warp zones LOL, it takes 45 minutes to<br/>
play the entire game.. but, my sons like to beat the last level<br/>
Bowser. The amount of cheats for the original Mario game can turn it<br/>
into an entirely new game. There are cheat codes that make you able to<br/>
Air Walk, and other cool stuff. Once you beat the game, it&#39;s over..<br/>
until you go back and look for all the cheats and secrets you didn&#39;t<br/>
know about before. <br/>
<br/>
I remember one of the most useful cheats, when I was young, was the<br/>
infinite lives on Contra (an original NES game). Without that cheat<br/>
code, the game was impossible for us as 11, 12 yr olds to beat...<br/>
well, maybe we could have done it if we didn&#39;t have to go to school.<br/>
But, with school in the way.... the infinite lives cheat code was the<br/>
way to go. LOL<br/>
<br/>
I like to play games without cheats and with cheats. They change the<br/>
game, sometimes giving an advantage to me.. other times, just doing<br/>
something silly or fun and interesting. Like the secret codes for<br/>
blood on Mortal Combat, or curse codes, etc. Sometimes, I just like to<br/>
play it through without any help from outside sources. I think cheats<br/>
and other types of codes enhance games, add something to them so they<br/>
have another dimension beyond just playing through the game, then it&#39;s<br/>
over... nothing to see here, folks! But, there is something.. lots of<br/>
things. :D And there better be for the price of games, today LOLOL</div>

In our family it depends on whether you are playing a single player <br/>
or multiplayer game.  <br/>
<br/>
If you are playing a single player game, then exactly who are you <br/>
cheating?  It doesn&#39;t affect anyone besides yourself.  Besides, as my <br/>
11yo says, the programmers wouldn&#39;t have written the codes into the <br/>
game if they didn&#39;t want you to use them.  Some of those codes are <br/>
highly entertaining.  I watched my son use a monster truck to run <br/>
over the enemy army and town in Age of Empires, and it was pretty <br/>
funny.<br/>
<br/>
In our family multiplayer games are a whole different animal when it <br/>
comes to cheat codes.  We consider it unsportsmanlike to use <br/>
cheatcodes to beat another person, unless everyone has access to the <br/>
same cheatcodes and everyone agrees it is ok to use them.<br/>
<br/>
This debate is very similar to the &quot;Free Parking&quot; debate in <br/>
Monopoly.  My dh swears it is cheating to to get money from the free <br/>
parking space because it is not in the rules, but I think it makes <br/>
the game more fun and interesting.  We don&#39;t play Monopoly much these <br/>
days ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1172982432">This is like using the calculator to do maths, isn&#39;t it? Well, why <br/>
not? My kid uses the calculator to help him solve maths problems in <br/>
his pc games to gain speed. To me, I don&#39;t call it cheating. I call <br/>
it being smart.   <br/>
<br/>
My son loves cheat codes. In Star Wars, it gaves him infinite lives, <br/>
so that he can continue learning to play and xplore the game without <br/>
the frustrations of being killed off. In Grand Theft Auto, it spawn <br/>
different characters, different cars, different planes or tanks, <br/>
different environment settings and many more funny things like <br/>
flying cars and everyone&#39;s a clown. They are called Mods. <br/>
<br/>
He can play the same games in his psp without cheat codes. So i <br/>
guess for him, cheat codes is just a different way of playing a <br/>
game. It just makes the game more fun becuase it &quot;accessorize&quot; the <br/>
standard game.   <br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps. <br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monopoly_(</a>game)<br/>
<br/>
Parker Brothers&#39; official instructions have long encouraged the use  <br/>
of House Rules, specific additions to or subtractions from the  <br/>
official rule sets. Many casual Monopoly players are surprised to  <br/>
discover that some of the rules that they are used to are not part of  <br/>
the official rules. Many of these house rules tend to make the game  <br/>
longer by randomly giving players more money. Some common house rules  <br/>
are listed below:<br/>
<br/>
	�	At the start of the game $2000 is given out to each of the players  <br/>
instead of $1500. Each player gets 2 500s, 4 100s, 4 50s, 6 20s, 8  <br/>
10s, 10 5s, and 10 1s<br/>
<br/>
	�	Free Parking jackpot, which usually consists of an initial stake  <br/>
(typically $500, or $5 million in the Here & Now Edition) plus  <br/>
collections of fines and taxes otherwise paid to the bank. A player  <br/>
who lands on Free Parking wins the jackpot, which may then be reset  <br/>
with the initial stake (if any). The jackpot is usually put in the  <br/>
center of the board. Since the jackpot forms an additional income for  <br/>
players in this set of house rules, games can take a much longer time  <br/>
than under normal rules.[18]<br/>
<br/>
	�	Eliminating the auction if a player decides not to purchase a  <br/>
property.<br/>
<br/>
	�	Requiring that every property be put up for auction (this  <br/>
eliminates some of the luck in the game of landing on particular  <br/>
squares and forces players to strategize more).<br/>
<br/>
	�	Allowing an unlimited number of houses to be available from the  <br/>
bank. When this house rule is implemented, substitute counters or  <br/>
written tallies are often employed to allay the actual shortage of  <br/>
house tokens in a standard game box.<br/>
<br/>
	�	Agreeing that each player be allowed to collect all of a color  <br/>
group once they have &#39;staked a claim&#39; by buying only one of those  <br/>
properties. The same agreement may or may not be carried over to the  <br/>
rail stations and utilities.<br/>
<br/>
	�	Players in jail cannot collect rent, build houses, or conduct  <br/>
trades. This can be combined with increasing the price to get out of  <br/>
jail considerably (normally $50, or $500,000 in the Here & Now  <br/>
Edition). Together, these rules make jail a far more significant  <br/>
burden than that listed in the normal rules. Other players may bail  <br/>
the player out of jail but only if the player agrees.<br/>
<br/>
	�	A bonus for landing directly on Go by dice roll (commonly an  <br/>
additional $200 or $500). This may or may not include cards that send  <br/>
the player to Go.[18]<br/>
<br/>
	�	Delayed Start: Players must pass Go (or circle the board at least  <br/>
once, or rarely twice) before they can buy property.[18]<br/>
<br/>
	�	Only allowing houses (or hotels) to be built when the owner lands  <br/>
on the group<br/>
<br/>
	�	A bonus for rolling snake eyes (a pair of ones), often $500, $100,  <br/>
or one of each bill.[19][20]<br/>
<br/>
	�	All properties are handed out evenly to all players before the  <br/>
game begins, or one or two are dealt to each player. This variation  <br/>
is in the official US and UK rules as a short game option.<br/>
<br/>
	�	In trades, players may offer &quot;rent immunity&quot; from their own  <br/>
properties (someone does not have to pay rent for landing on that  <br/>
property) as part of a deal (this can be good for a certain number of  <br/>
landings or the entire game).[18]<br/>
<br/>
	�	Unlimited amounts of hotels on each space.<br/>
<br/>
House rules, while unofficial, are not wholly unrecognized by Parker  <br/>
Brothers. George S. Parker himself created two variants, to shorten  <br/>
the length of game play.[clarification needed] Video game and  <br/>
computer game versions of Monopoly have options where popular house  <br/>
rules can be used*. House rules that have the effect of randomly  <br/>
introducing more money into the game have a side-effect of increasing  <br/>
the time it takes for players to become bankrupt, lengthening the  <br/>
game considerably, as well as decreasing the effects of strategy and  <br/>
prudent investment. House rules which increase the amount of money in  <br/>
the game may change the strategies of the players, such as changing  <br/>
the relative value of different properties- the more money in the  <br/>
game, the more one may wish to invest in the higher value properties.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
* On the Wikipedia video game page it says the Free Parking jackpot  <br/>
is one of the house rules allowed:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Some versions however, like the Nintendo 64 and PlayStation  <br/>
versions, do allow the most common &quot;house rules&quot; (Free Parking  <br/>
jackpot, no collecting rent in jail, unlimited houses/hotels, etc) to  <br/>
be turned off or on.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Which makes it an officially recognized house rule, which wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
change tradition if they decided not to include it as an allowable  <br/>
house rule.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-931136275">-=-This is like using the calculator to do maths, isn&#39;t it? Well, why<br/>
not? My kid uses the calculator to help him solve maths problems in<br/>
his pc games to gain speed. To me, I don&#39;t call it cheating. I call<br/>
it being smart. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it like using a computer to write?  To type?  I used to have to re- <br/>
type a whole page if I changed my mind about a phrase or had  <br/>
misspelled a word in such a way I couldn&#39;t correct it with type-over  <br/>
paper or liquid paper.  I *know* how to type with &quot;a real  <br/>
typewriter&quot; (and even how to justify margins, and how to make carbon  <br/>
copies, and how to clean the keys, on things before Selectric IIs  <br/>
with their jazzy little balls.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SO WHAT!?  I&#39;m thrilled with word processing programs and html to  <br/>
change fonts and with the insertion of photos on blogposts.  How on  <br/>
god&#39;s green, blue and brown earth is that cheating?   Is it cheating  <br/>
to use an electric drill instead of a hand crank?  Is it cheating to  <br/>
use a washing washing machine instead of two tubs and a scrub board?<br/>
<br/>
People who say cheat codes are cheating are being small minded and  <br/>
showing a lack of analytical thinking skills.<br/>
<br/>
All of them should be required to read Pigs is Pigs.  Reading it  <br/>
online is like using a cheat code, as opposed to finding a book that  <br/>
has it in it.  It&#39;s in several literary/rhetoric collections in the U.S.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45212172">The discussion of house rules in Monopoly reminded me of Scrabble. The<br/>
official rules say that the &#39;premium squares&#39; such as &quot;Triple Word<br/>
Score, Double Letter Score&quot; etc.. are to be counted only the first<br/>
time they are played. But, we use them everytime. If someone covers a<br/>
&quot;Triple Word Score&quot; and then someone else makes a word coming off of<br/>
it that also uses that triple word score, we count it. The official<br/>
rules say not to. But, whatever. We&#39;ve always played it like that.</div>

I have an IBM Selectric II I got from my mother in law...and I can&#39;t<br/>
even change the ribbon!!  There it sits, all forlorn.  Sad, really.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I should try to find a &quot;how to&quot; on the web, or would that be<br/>
cheating?<br/>

rules (but the triple-doubles-go-to-jail, is in there!)<br/>

I think the &quot;cheats&quot; would be called &quot;aids&quot; 25 years ago, before the disease<br/>

Cheats it is!<br/>

&gt;   -=-This debate is very similar to the &quot;Free Parking&quot; debate in<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Monopoly. My dh swears it is cheating to to get money from the free<br/>
&gt; parking space because it is not in the rules, but I think it makes<br/>
&gt; the game more fun and interesting. We don&#39;t play Monopoly much these<br/>
&gt; days ;)-=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Here&#39;s why tradition is stronger than rules:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; People have collected the pot for landing on Free Parking since<br/>
&gt; before I was born, and I&#39;m 55 years old. If it were in the rules, it<br/>
&gt; could be changed. If it&#39;s not in the rules (and I&#39;m taking your word<br/>
&gt; for it, I&#39;m not going to check) then the tradition can&#39;t be changed.<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s old, it&#39;s real, and I bet if you polled 100 people the vast<br/>
&gt; majority of them would say that Free Parking means collecting money.<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t remember which pile, but one of those piles....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1190270385">My opinion (haven&#39;t read the responses and hope I&#39;m not repeating everybody<br/>
here) is that while there really are advantageous to playing games sans walk<br/>
throughs and cheat codes, there&#39;s a whole world of discovery to learn from<br/>
once you do pull out those things...<br/>
<br/>
Like having the key to a test for peer grading assignments in school,<br/>
something which tended to clarify one or two things about the test I was<br/>
grading for someone else which I had also just taken.  Sort of fun, if I<br/>
remember.<br/>

&gt; We know a family who does not believe in cheat codes and this has spilled<br/>

are<br/>
&gt; becoming more and more heated.  I&#39;ve explained to both children that the<br/>
&gt; cheat code conversation can be like religion - you can agree to disagree.<br/>
&gt; These conversations have caused Tails to ask me more and more questions<br/>
&gt; about my opinions on cheat codes.  I tell her I use them and I don&#39;t have<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; problem using them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not asking for any advice on how to deal with the kiddo situation<br/>
&gt; (handled), but more for personal opinions to expand my viewpoint on cheat<br/>
&gt; codes so that I can give Tails different opinions regarding them.  I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; hoping that by giving her more information that she can feel comfortable<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; whatever decision she chooses.   Right now, I&#39;m seeing that these<br/>
