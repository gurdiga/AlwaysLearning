<div id="ygrps-yiv-215827399">I was very excited to get this message on my Facebook wall tonight....<br/>
<br/>
&quot;OMG Cassie, been reading a lot of Sandra Dodd stuff over the last couple of days. So much of what she says about respectful parenting, spoiling a child etc really rings true with me. There are things that my partner and I do routinely in terms of discipline with my stepson, because it is the &quot;acceptable&quot; mainstream way of doing things, and I never even thought of the effect it has until reading it - eg taking toys away because he has been &quot;bad&quot;. I just wanted to thank you so much for pointing me in this direction -in all my parenting endeavours I will try to take a deep peaceful breath and do things from a place of love and acceptance.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How cool, huh!  I shared Sandra&#39;s link on my Living Natural group, we have a thread going on unschooling.  Maybe she&#39;ll find this group next!<br/>
