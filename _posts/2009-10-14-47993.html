<div id="ygrps-yiv-1289339924">John wrote a compelling article about why hearing parents don&#39;t sign.  I<br/>
wanted to share it with you all -- because he would not have been able to<br/>
write this if we hadn&#39;t gone into unschooling.  Our journey has opened our<br/>
eyes regarding our relationship with our children and helped give us a fresh<br/>
perspective on one of the serious questions within our community.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-136890064">I read that article after someone linked it at Facebook.  I really enjoyed what John had to say, especially his remarks about kids being the most oppressed and abused group of people in our society.  <br/>
<br/>
It was also eye-opening for me -- it never even occurred to me that some parents of deaf children can&#39;t be bothered to learn sign language.  Or only learn enough to order the kids around.  I can&#39;t imagine actually choosing not to communicate with my child! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521958798">I&#39;ve sent the article all over the place - great article and I like that <br/>
a very different perspective might get parents to think in new ways. Not <br/>
just hearing parents of deaf children, either, but all parents.<br/>
