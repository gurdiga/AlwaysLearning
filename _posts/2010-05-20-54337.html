None of them disturbed me at all. That fact might disturb some of the  <br/>
rest of you. :-)  (I hope not...)<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t say this will be comic relief, but it might break some of the  <br/>
tension and focus of the day&#39;s discussions.<br/>

Oh, I was watching a documentary yesterday that Chamille walked in on.  She came in just in time to hear about Galileo.  When his life was threatened by the Catholic church he took back everything he said about the earth moving around the sun.  That was way too disturbing for the Catholic church, heresy.<br/>
<br/>
That whole conversation led to the ideas of censorship and the monopoly of knowledge and who gets to know what.  But boy oh boy, Galileo&#39;s scientific discovery very much disturbed the church!  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think Chamille even knew who Galileo was before last night, or that people used to believe that the sun revolved around the earth!<br/>
