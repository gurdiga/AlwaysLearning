<div id="ygrps-yiv-1548984434">If you ever get a chance to watch Jenny&#39;s daughter play DDR it is the most beautiful thing. Really. We just got the Wii&#39;s version and I keep holding Chamille in my head to try and dance better than I can. I don&#39;t know that it helps, but I like doing it. <br/>

I am sitting at my desk right now,  only because it is giving me the<br/>
opportunity to watch my daughter and her friend play DDR!  That is fun!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s sweet!  I&#39;ll let her know!  I actually enjoy watching her for the<br/>
same reasons!  She justs slides and floats across the mat so fast and<br/>
easy.  I really don&#39;t know how she does it, but it&#39;s pretty cool to<br/>
watch!  These days, I can&#39;t even beat her while playing 2 levels down,<br/>
but I don&#39;t mind, I like it when my kids win even if I lose!<br/>
<br/>
With the Wii, do you get to use your arms too?  Now that would be fun,<br/>
arms, and feet all added to the mix!</div>
