Serenity is no great trick in a padded, muffled world. If someone can<br/>
create, maintain and experience peace in normal circumstances, THAT is<br/>
really<br/>
useful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been looking up quotes on breathing and meditation a lot lately,<br/>
in preparation for the conference. One of the sentiments I came<br/>
across, that I really love is to never see the daily tasks-wiping<br/>
noses, comforting bruises, preparing food, cleaning up-as something to<br/>
get through in order to do the important stuff. It IS the important<br/>
stuff. It IS the practice.<br/>
How well we navigate these &quot;mundane&quot; tasks, is really the crux of LIFE. <br/>
<br/>
There is a picture of a Swami, the caption underneath says something<br/>
like;&quot;You can&#39;t avoid the waves in life, but you can learn to surf&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Peace isn&#39;t the absence of conflict, it is remaining a calm pool<br/>
amidst the storm.<br/>
<br/>
