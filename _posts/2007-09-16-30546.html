<div id="ygrps-yiv-1083355603">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve been a member of this group for years but forgot about <br/>
it and haven&#39;t posted in a very long time.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been unschooling my 8yo daughter since she was two and my 4yo <br/>
since birth.  Last night they both decided that they wanted to go to <br/>
school.  I&#39;m tempted to let Lauren (8yo) go for a day or a week so <br/>
she could see how it is, but here are my concerns:<br/>
<br/>
She barely reads at a first grade level and her math skills are the <br/>
same.  Though she can read and do simple math, she walks around <br/>
telling everyone that she doesn&#39;t know how.  I&#39;m concerned that one <br/>
day with a school teacher will have CPS at my door.  I like to stay <br/>
under the radar.<br/>
<br/>
My other concern is, what if she likes it?  I&#39;m vehemently opposed to <br/>
how children are taught in school and the mind control that goes on.  <br/>
It would not be okay with me to have her in school.<br/>
<br/>
Thoughts anyone?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-809704572">I agree with the last answer that you should find out why she wants to go to school.  My kids wanted to go also when they were younger because I worked in a daycare and all their friends went to school and talked about how fun it was.<br/>
<br/>
I have heard of homeschool groups playing school.  Either making if boring and controlling so the kids see that it isn&#39;t fun or the kids might really like the structure and think it&#39;s fun.  If they like it, you could have a group of other interested kids and &quot;do school&quot; once a week or whenever.  <br/>
<br/>
The bus is always exciting to lots of kids too.  You can go for a ride on the public transportation if you have any in your town so they can ride a bus.<br/>
<br/>
It would really depend on your dd&#39;s reason for wanting to go.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-15739568">On another list (or perhaps this one) more than one parent has stated in<br/>
similar words  &quot;I am of the I don&#39;t let my children play in the street and I<br/>
don&#39;t let them go to school opinion&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My opinion is that if she were older it would be appropriate to involve her<br/>
much more in making the decision.  But 8 is barely past babyhood (says the<br/>
grandmother).     Frankly I would be more likely to let an 8 year old play<br/>
in the street than attend a traditional &quot;school&quot;.     For me, the better<br/>
line would be &quot;I don&#39;t send them to play in a toxic dump,  why would I allow<br/>
them to attend school?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
vicki<br/>
<br/>
P.S.: By the way,  it is also my opinion (based on experience) that  barely<br/>
reading at a first grade level  (whatever that is, blech) at age 8  makes<br/>
it  more likely  that eventually she will be an extremely competent<br/>
reader.............PROVIDED she is not pushed to &quot;improve&quot; before she is<br/>
ready.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290950320">It seems you&#39;re looking more at school and at what they can&#39;t do than  <br/>
at them and what you all could be doing.<br/>

<br/>
My first temptation is to ask what you were doing with your older  <br/>
daughter before she was two.   Surely not &quot;Schooling&quot; her...  (unless  <br/>
you took her out of a structured daycare or something)...<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s not important now.  It&#39;s important for you to think about,  <br/>
I think, because maybe your definition and view of unschooling could  <br/>
be looked at and clarified.<br/>
<br/>
You probably wouldn&#39;t be able to let her go to school for one day.<br/>
If you do decide to let them go to school, reading this might help:<br/>

<br/>
It won&#39;t take school enrollment to get attention, if she&#39;s walking  <br/>
around telling people what she doesn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think you might want to look at making your homelife way more  <br/>
interesting and busy so they won&#39;t want to go to school.  We can help  <br/>
you think of ways to do that.<br/>

Maybe some of these pages will give you ideas, and if you&#39;re not  <br/>
getting out of the house at least two or three times a week to do  <br/>
cool stuff, maybe schedule up some outings, quickly, and make your  <br/>
unschooling life rich and exciting (which will, at the same time,  <br/>
make it work better).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357650603">We had a request of our youngest 6yo DS last night & I was trying to find out why he wants to try going to school... I&#39;d just rather stay out of the district&#39;s radar since we live in TX where we don&#39;t have to let the school district know if we&#39;re homeschooling unless we&#39;re pulling our child(ren) from school...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to find out why R wants to go to school... is it friends? We can try to make some... There aren&#39;t very many kids in our neighborhood, but we&#39;re going to start going to the unschooling get togethers... perhaps he&#39;d like a backpack? Does he want homework or a little more formal school-at-home stuff? (when I mentioned this, he made a face, LOL!!) <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s been teaching himself how to read from stuff he does on the computer (dragonfable is one, he&#39;s been on starfall, neopets is another, maybe pardus, I can&#39;t think offhand what other sites he & his brothers have been to)... and occasionally goes through the little Bob Books we have and another learn to read book I found at a used bookstore and countless other books we have around the house & library books... <br/>
He picks them up or asks for them when the mood hits and tries to read from harry potter book 1... no pushing here... <br/>
<br/>
His 3 older brothers attended school in another district from k-4 (twins now 12) and k-1 (now almost 10) and they&#39;ve been out of school for 2 years now... they can give him an idea what school was like for them...<br/>
<br/>
I told him that if he&#39;d like to, we can go take a walk around the school so he can see what it is like. I don&#39;t want to just plain say no, but to just explore what school is/means, etc... <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that he may miss homeschool co-op: we&#39;re not going this year because the co-op dissolved.  We do plan to start going to hang with the unschoolers (which is almost an hour away) so maybe that will help. <br/>
<br/>
Of my 4 boys, he&#39;s the only one who has been always unschooled... <br/>

This will undoubtedly seem picky to those who are new to unschooling,  <br/>

<br/>
If you think of that (and word it) as &quot;He&#39;s been learning to read  <br/>
some from stuff he does on the computer&quot; instead of &quot;teaching  <br/>
himself,&quot; it will create a small shift in your point of view and  <br/>

he goes to school, all you have to do is give them a letter saying  <br/>

Maybe he wants to be special? With 3 older siblings, maybe he&#39;s  <br/>
feeling a little left out or lost in the shuffle of all the stuff  <br/>
they do?<br/>

Maybe you can find a class of some kind just for him. My youngest  <br/>
daughter went to a nature center class - every weekday for 2 hours  <br/>
for three weeks. From then on she would talk about, &quot;My Teacher,&quot;  <br/>

Little League t-ball, and I&#39;m sure he had lots of questions about why <br/>
he was homeschooled.  When he brought it up, it was with the plaintive <br/>
&quot;Mommy, I think I&#39;m smart enough to go to school...&quot;  He thought he was <br/>
being homeschooled because he was too dumb for school.  I asked him <br/>
what he thought he would learn in school; he didn&#39;t know.  I told him <br/>
that he&#39;d be in first grade, and in first grade they mostly learned to <br/>
read.  He&#39;d been reading since he was 4, virtually self-taught.  I <br/>
said, &quot;You know how to read, right?  What would you do all day in <br/>
school while the other kids learn to read?&quot;  :-)  That satisfied him.<br/>

You might want to clarify why your son wants to go.<br/>

I have to agree with this.  I have known kids who wanted to go to school<br/>
because they served chocolate milk (which their parents never bought) and<br/>
because they wanted to ride on a bus.  If you find out the reason, there is<br/>
a good chance that you will be able to find another way to meet his needs.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter, who is now 19 and living on her own, attended school for<br/>
one year, seventh grade.  Although she didn&#39;t have any particularly horrible<br/>
experiences,  she regrets it now and thinks both that her time could have<br/>
been better spent and that some of the peer interaction had long term<br/>
negative consequences.  I wish I would have worked harder to find another<br/>
option for her.  We talk about it though, and we both agree that it did meet<br/>
some needs.  Our whole family learned what it is like to have someone<br/>
attending school which actually makes the other children less likely to want<br/>
to try it.  By seeing how well she compared to the other  students, she<br/>
developed a lot of confidence in unschooling and now definitely wants to<br/>
unschool her own children.  It also was an escape for her during a difficult<br/>
time when my ex-husband and I were separating.<br/>
<br/>
My thirteen year old daughter sometimes talks about wanting to go to school<br/>
and see what it is like.  Then we talk about the realities of what it would<br/>
be like, and so far she has always decided on a different path (like taking<br/>
horseback riding lessons and starting an internet forum) to meet her needs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-724348483">Hi, all.<br/>
I&#39;m resurrecting a &quot;dead&quot; topic here because I was searching for some<br/>
tips on helping get my (almost) 5 yo daughter to &quot;want&quot; to stay home.<br/>
She turns 5 too late (end Oct) to go to K this year in our Dist, so we<br/>
don&#39;t have to decide yet, but I want to work on this now and not have<br/>
it be an issue.<br/>
<br/>
I have talked to HS moms in our local group and got the &quot;find out why<br/>
she wants to go to school&quot; advice. I tried this and she just said &quot;I<br/>
don&#39;t know.&quot; I don&#39;t know what she expects to get from school or why<br/>
it appeals so much to her. <br/>
<br/>
I am at home (as is her dad) but work full-time at home (he has own PT<br/>
to FT business--depending on projects at the time). Because of this we<br/>
both have flexibility to make time for her during the day and try to<br/>
do so as much as possible (though not always able). She (and her 2 yo<br/>
sister) gets much more of our time and attention than most kids who<br/>
have to go to daycare, but not as much time with other kids. We do<br/>
make an effort to go to the HS playgroup perhaps 2X/month. <br/>
<br/>
She watches PBS semi-regularly, so it may be from the<br/>
Arthur/Caillou/Etc. crowd. The shows are all about trying to jazz up<br/>
the idea of school to the majority of kids who will attend. I guess<br/>
what I might be looking for (besides advice and ideas) are any<br/>
books/videos/cartoons that depict characters that are homeschooled as<br/>
an alternative for the small amount of TV time she does get. <br/>
<br/>
Another concern of mine is that she is very advanced. She began<br/>
reading very naturally and progressively on her own guidance (with our<br/>
support and encouragement). I wasn&#39;t sure what her &quot;reading level&quot; was<br/>
(didn&#39;t really care to know), but recently one of the books we checked<br/>
out from the library was a &quot;Read on Your Own, Level Three: Grades Two<br/>
to Four&quot; book and she read it to us without difficulty. <br/>
<br/>
I have tried the angle of &quot;you like learning, right? You want to keep<br/>
learning, right? Well, your teacher will be teaching all of the other<br/>
kids the basics, like letters and then reading very basic words and<br/>
she (he) won&#39;t have time with all of those kids to teach you anything<br/>
more than what they are learning (that you already know).&quot; I couldn&#39;t<br/>
tell whether it had much of an effect on her or not. She still seems<br/>
to really want to go to school. <br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions would be GREATLY appreciated!<br/>

&gt; Hi there,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think I&#39;ve been a member of this group for years but forgot about <br/>
&gt; it and haven&#39;t posted in a very long time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve been unschooling my 8yo daughter since she was two and my 4yo <br/>
&gt; since birth.  Last night they both decided that they wanted to go to <br/>
&gt; school.  I&#39;m tempted to let Lauren (8yo) go for a day or a week so <br/>
&gt; she could see how it is, but here are my concerns:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She barely reads at a first grade level and her math skills are the <br/>
&gt; same.  Though she can read and do simple math, she walks around <br/>
&gt; telling everyone that she doesn&#39;t know how.  I&#39;m concerned that one <br/>
&gt; day with a school teacher will have CPS at my door.  I like to stay <br/>
&gt; under the radar.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My other concern is, what if she likes it?  I&#39;m vehemently opposed to <br/>
&gt; how children are taught in school and the mind control that goes on.  <br/>
&gt; It would not be okay with me to have her in school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thoughts anyone?<br/>

<br/>
Rosie wanted to have a teacher. She wanted to be able to say things  <br/>
like, &quot;MY teacher says.....&quot;. So we signed her up for a week, one hour  <br/>
per day, for a science class at the local nature center. That was  <br/>
enough to make her happy.<br/>
<br/>
So - you might find that she wants just a little &quot;school&quot; type of  <br/>
experience - a teacher, some lessons. Find a recreation department  <br/>
class or &quot;kids college&quot; - which our local community colleges offer.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We do<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is not much. I&#39;d go every week and go early, leave late. Make a  <br/>
play date for another day during the week with someone from the HS  <br/>
group.<br/>
<br/>
My daughters hardly even considered going to school because they&#39;d  <br/>
have had to give up their very active social life with their  <br/>
homeschool friends. So - if you&#39;re willing to work a little harder,  <br/>
you could kind of get her more connected and locked in.<br/>

Arthur/Caillou/Etc. crowd. The shows are all about trying to jazz up<br/>
the idea of school to the majority of kids who will attend. I guess<br/>
what I might be looking for (besides advice and ideas) are any<br/>
books/videos/cartoons that depict characters that are homeschooled as<br/>
an alternative for the small amount of TV time she does get. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Why is her TV time limited?<br/>
<br/>
Why limit her to shows about school or about not-school?  Look for  <br/>
movies with quality aspects that depict happy children doing fun things.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/movies">http://sandradodd.com/movies</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Because of this we<br/>
<br/>
both have flexibility to make time for her during the day and try to<br/>
do so as much as possible (though not always able). She (and her 2 yo<br/>
sister) gets much more of our time and attention than most kids who<br/>
have to go to daycare, but not as much time with other kids. We do<br/>
make an effort to go to the HS playgroup perhaps 2X/month. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could hire an older kid as a mother&#39;s helper to come to  <br/>
your house and just play with them.  Unschooling needs to be rich and  <br/>
busy and fun, not just spare moments.  But with two parents home and  <br/>
80 hours worked, there are still LOTS of hours in the week when  <br/>
you&#39;re not sleeping.  If school sounds more fun than home, home isn&#39;t  <br/>
enough fun.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Another concern of mine is that she is very advanced. -=-<br/>
<br/>
So you&#39;re worried that if she goes to school she&#39;ll be bored?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I&#39;m resurrecting a &quot;dead&quot; topic here because I was searching for  <br/>
some tips on helping get my (almost) 5 yo daughter to &quot;want&quot; to stay  <br/>
home.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a dead topic at all, but she should truly want to stay  <br/>
home,  not &quot;want&quot; (kind of, or as they say) to stay home.  One of the  <br/>
worst things about school is kids not having a choice.  It&#39;s the  <br/>
worst thing about homeschooling, too, when the kids are home against  <br/>
their wishes.  Create a home she WANTS to be in.  Create a world she  <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to miss.<br/>

make home more fun, the more attractive school will be and the more  <br/>
intrigued she&#39;ll be. Even if you think you&#39;re hiding it, you really  <br/>
can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I would use her interest as an indication that there are things she  <br/>
wants to explore that are missing from home. Yes, she&#39;s making it  <br/>
hard because she doesn&#39;t know! But that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s nothing  <br/>
you can do.<br/>
<br/>
What if she announced she wanted to go to Paris? Probably you  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t hop on a plane to Paris, but would you panic and find ways  <br/>
to ignore Paris and make the US seem more fun? Or might you explore  <br/>
French food and turn on the French language on movies?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe ask her to visualize what a day at school would be like. Have  <br/>
her walk you through her day and pay attention to what it is she&#39;s  <br/>
thinking would be fun. Don&#39;t down play it. If there&#39;s any negative  <br/>
vibes coming from you, any fear, she&#39;s likely to clam up and not want  <br/>
to play. Use it as a stream of information to help you help her find  <br/>
new things to explore. (Obviously you&#39;ve got it easier since she&#39;s  <br/>
too young to go. This can all be pure information, not leading to  <br/>
&quot;Can I go tomorrow?&quot; You can honestly say &quot;The school won&#39;t let her,&quot;  <br/>
but that you&#39;d like to find ways for her to do the same fun things.)  <br/>
Be respectful if she says she doesn&#39;t know why something sounds fun.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We do<br/>
&gt; make an effort to go to the HS playgroup perhaps 2X/month.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If she sees kids on TV playing together at school every day (or so it  <br/>
seems to her) this isn&#39;t enough. Classes, brownies, creating your own  <br/>
unschoolers get together, inviting kids over.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I guess<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sounds like propaganda to me.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to sell her on homeschooling. Live it. Let *her* decide she  <br/>
likes it (or not.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; an alternative for the small amount of TV time she does get.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>One of the great things about being out in the world rather than  <br/>
locked in a room is freedom. The more restrictions at home, then  <br/>
school isn&#39;t as big of a contrast. Why is her TV time being limited?  <br/>
Do you limit her to a book a day? Do you limit her to 1 cookie per day?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I couldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tell whether it had much of an effect on her or not. She still seems<br/>
&gt; to really want to go to school.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That limitation might be worth it to her to get access to lots of  <br/>
kids or whatever she thinks she&#39;ll find in school.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter went to school for 2 months of 2nd grade. At first  <br/>
everything was &quot;Great!&quot; After a while the newness of the good parts  <br/>
wore off and the stuff she was putting up with to get the new stuff  <br/>
started feeling more and more annoying until she felt she&#39;d sucked  <br/>
the experience dry and was done. The good parts were no longer worth  <br/>
the irritation of the bad parts. Same with just about anything new  <br/>
people want to try. There&#39;s always good parts and bad parts. If  <br/>
someone finds the good parts are worth the bad parts, they put up  <br/>
with them. If not, it&#39;s hugely empowering to know you can drop  <br/>
something at any time.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;re fearing school too much. You&#39;re fearing that it&#39;s more  <br/>
fun than you are and that if you let her go she&#39;ll realize that and  <br/>
not want to come home. (If you weren&#39;t fearing that, then it wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
frighten you that she wanted to go. That said, it is a very common  <br/>
fear! Don&#39;t think you&#39;re alone in that.)<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the strengths that we unschooling parents have is that  <br/>
we know school and unschooling. We&#39;ve experienced both. It increases  <br/>
our credibility when we discuss the benefits of unschooling :-) But a  <br/>
lot of our kids will only know unschooling. My daughter Kat knows  <br/>
from experience why she wouldn&#39;t want to attend school. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not advocating putting kids in school, but I think the less we  <br/>
fear what they want to try, the better.<br/>

Maybe she wants the excitement of getting new school stuff.  Let her <br/>
pick out a school bookbag or box.  We used file boxes when my kids <br/>
were younger that they decorated with stickers.  Buy some school <br/>
supplies like pencils, colored pencils, crayons, markers, and glue.  <br/>
You can also buy some fun coloring books, sketch pad, activity books <br/>
(word finds, dot to dot, mazes, painting books), construction paper, <br/>
and a lined notebook.  You could include some playing cards, small <br/>
puzzles and games.  She can keep all her stuff in her school box that <br/>

&quot;Mommy, I think I&#39;m smart enough to go to school...&quot;  He thought he  <br/>
was being homeschooled because there was something wrong with him, or  <br/>
he was dumb.  He might have gotten that idea from one of his Little  <br/>
League teammates, who often quizzed him on stuff *they* didn&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
I asked him what he thought he would learn in school as a first  <br/>
grader.  He didn&#39;t know what they really did, so I told him mostly  <br/>
they learned to read.  As he&#39;d been reading for two years by then, I  <br/>
followed by asking him what he thought he would do all day while the  <br/>
other kids learned to read.  That satisfied him &lt;g&gt;<br/>

He has since chosen to go to school -- he started college last week.   <br/>
It&#39;s a bit of a shock when your first day at school is a college  <br/>
Astronomy class and you&#39;ve never had any formal math, but he&#39;s doing  <br/>
fine so far.  (The other class is Drawing; he dropped the 5 unit  <br/>
Japanese class for now.)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s interesting how some things are taken for granted in the school  <br/>
universe.  His Astronomy teacher&#39;s syllabus included an explanation of  <br/>
the grading system, including his policy that the lowest scoring quiz  <br/>
would be dropped.  Alex, completely unfamiliar with all of it, thought  <br/>
this meant that the person who scored the lowest would be kicked out  <br/>

So we do everything we can to get together with other kids as much as possible .<br/>

We are trying to join a co-op once a week that has Chess, Lego and Theater classes.<br/>

It seems like a busy schedule but he wanted those and he has a need to be around other kids.<br/>
I could do some of those activities without the group but for him it is important to be with other.<br/>
We still do plenty without the groups but I can see he enjoys so much being with his friends.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1257009571">I won&#39;t rehash all the great advice you&#39;ve already received, but <br/>
thought I&#39;d throw out what occured with my DD.<br/>
<br/>
When she was about a year out from Kindergarten she started talking <br/>
about going to school, pretty intensly.  I posted to the AU list for <br/>
the same reasons you posted here, I thought getting some good advice <br/>
and clearing my own issues up would be a good move on my part.  It <br/>
was good, but my conversations with my DD still didn&#39;t reveal her <br/>
motivation to go to school.<br/>
<br/>
Then, we were driving somewhere and something came up about a <br/>
homeschooled friend of my son&#39;s who had been hit by a golf cart as <br/>
he was crossing the street in front of a local lodge.  He had to get <br/>
stitches and it freaked him and his mom out, but otherwise it turned <br/>
out fine.  She suddenly blurted out: &quot;WE WILL NEVER KNOW ABOUT THOSE <br/>
THINGS BECAUSE WE DON&#39;T GO TO SCHOOL!!!&quot;  And then I got it, she was <br/>
worried that by not going to school she was going to miss out on <br/>
some vitally important knowledge that would keep her from getting <br/>
hit by a golf cart (it sounds trivial but in her mind it was a major <br/>
big deal).  So we talked about what you learn in school and what you <br/>
learn from experience, and how she could learn about the golf cart <br/>
from our friend and that she didn&#39;t have to go to school to learn <br/>
that and in fact wouldn&#39;t learn that if she went to school.  She was <br/>
totally fine with that and school has never come up again, except to <br/>
tell me how glad she is that she doesn&#39;t have to go to school so she <br/>
can do art all day.<br/>
<br/>
For the social piece I try to really respond to every interest my <br/>
kids have, as possible in our small town.  So they are in soccer, <br/>
dance, karate, art classes, climbing -- they get to spend lots of <br/>
time with other kids, homeschooled and schooled, in those <br/>
situations.  And we have lots of sleepovers and playdates, usually I <br/>
host, but not always.  For my 3, 2 times a month would not be enough <br/>
social for them, but every child is different.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1539910627">Thanks, EVERYONE for the great suggestions and reassurances! No one in<br/>
my local HS group seemed to have experienced their kids&#39; desire to go<br/>
to school, so glad to know I&#39;m not alone. It was great to get all of<br/>
these responses in just a single day!<br/>

   &lt;&lt;What if she announced she wanted to go to Paris? Probably you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t hop on a plane to Paris, but would you panic and find ways<br/>
to ignore Paris and make the US seem more fun? Or might you explore<br/>
French food and turn on the French language on movies?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Fantastic comparison! I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way. I will look at<br/>
ways to go headlong into this, rather than just trying to avoid it.<br/>
I&#39;ll probably start this process with your suggestion:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe ask her to visualize what a day at school would be like. Have<br/>
her walk you through her day and pay attention to what it is she&#39;s<br/>
thinking would be fun. Don&#39;t down play it. If there&#39;s any negative<br/>
vibes coming from you, any fear, she&#39;s likely to clam up and not want<br/>
to play. Use it as a stream of information to help you help her find<br/>
new things to explore.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like a great way to get more information from her since<br/>
she doesn&#39;t seem to know why she wants to go to school. Then I can<br/>
find ways to meet that unmet need, whatever it may be. I also really<br/>
liked Diana&#39;s suggestion:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;we set up a corner of the dining room as<br/>
her &quot;classroom&quot; -- we got a desk and I decorated with posters&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Both Sandra and Joyce asked about why we limit TV time. I guess we<br/>
don&#39;t want her to just &#39;veg out&#39; in front of the TV, and that often<br/>
seems to be how she watches it. Blank look, doesn&#39;t seem to be getting<br/>
much out of it. We do watch movies together fairly regularly on the<br/>
&quot;big screen&quot; (projector on the wall) and she enjoys that and doesn&#39;t<br/>
get that same look, and we talk about them as we are getting ready for<br/>
bed afterward. <br/>
<br/>
Instead, when the TV is on less, she engages more, &quot;loses herself&quot; in<br/>
activity for long periods of time, either reading to herself or<br/>
imaginative play with her stuffed animals, coloring, writing letters<br/>
to her friends or grandma, etc. This is something we have noticed for<br/>
her. Her 2yo sister, on the other hand, will watch for a few minutes<br/>
and walk away while the TV is still on to do something else. We won&#39;t<br/>
have to &quot;limit&quot; her time, it seems (at least at this point). <br/>
<br/>
Sandra wrote:<br/>
&lt;&lt;Why limit her to shows about school or about not-school?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The shows are not limited to shows about school or not-school, but we<br/>
prefer to use the TV as an enrichment tool rather than a way to tune<br/>
out. We are also adamantly opposed to much of consumer culture in the<br/>
US and do NOT want our daughters exposed to all of the blatant and<br/>
irresponsible marketing to children. (Fortunately, the 4yo does mute<br/>
out commercials and understands what advertisers are trying to do.)<br/>
Because of these important values to us, we choose PBS. Then in many<br/>
of these shows they *happen* to mention school, rather than shows<br/>
*about* school. <br/>
<br/>
In response to my request: &gt; I guess<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; what I might be looking for (besides advice and ideas) are any<br/>
&gt; books/videos/cartoons that depict characters that are homeschooled as<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Joyce wrote:<br/>
&lt;&lt;Sounds like propaganda to me.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe so. I guess I hadn&#39;t thought of it that way. I had considered<br/>
the PBS shows propaganda and just wanted a way to counter that. I<br/>
hadn&#39;t considered shows portraying HS as an option propaganda, and not<br/>
sure I meant the type of show that could be considered so (at least I<br/>
think not...**sheepish grin**). I guess it&#39;s just not even seen<br/>
anywhere in the media. I wouldn&#39;t mind if Caillou was excited to go to<br/>
school (as in an episode where he went to his friend&#39;s school for a<br/>
day) if he also had a HS friend he visited as well.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra wrote: <br/>
&lt;&lt;So you&#39;re worried that if she goes to school she&#39;ll be bored?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I am, or perhaps that she won&#39;t be challenged or will not have as<br/>
much opportunity to learn. <br/>
<br/>
Joyce wrote: <br/>
&lt;&lt;You&#39;re fearing that it&#39;s more<br/>
fun than you are and that if you let her go she&#39;ll realize that and<br/>
not want to come home. (If you weren&#39;t fearing that, then it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
frighten you that she wanted to go. That said, it is a very common<br/>
fear! Don&#39;t think you&#39;re alone in that.)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, despite the apparent contradiction, my immediate<br/>
response to this was also Yes. I do think I am afraid she&#39;ll want to<br/>
stay in school (for whatever she enjoys/misses) and end up missing out<br/>
on the learning (about who she is, what she enjoys, who she wants to<br/>
become as much as the more &quot;academic&quot; or &quot;traditional&quot; learning she<br/>
could do while her peers are learning what she already knows--i.e.<br/>
reading, writing and basic math).<br/>
<br/>
Our local HS playgroup seems about to disband due to a lack of ability<br/>
for any family to be able to commit to being their *every* week, in<br/>
case of a new family arriving, or whatever. Given the discussion here,<br/>
I&#39;m thinking of committing our family to this despite the fact that I<br/>
work 40 hr/wk. I can flex that time and work those few hrs another<br/>
time to make this a priority for my girls. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all of your ideas!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285418752">Lydia is 11 and had often asked about school.  She&#39;s a really social<br/>
girl and I kept her very busy with our local homeschool group (4-H, girl<br/>
scouts, art club, parties, play dates, field trips, park days, etc.). <br/>
She was still curious so we would visit friends at school and went on a<br/>
tour of the school.  She always decided not to go, until this year.<br/>
<br/>
Around here many homeschoolers start going to school about this age. <br/>
Her friends that haven&#39;t gone the school route are a little more<br/>
introverted than she is and well, Lydia wants to be around kids every<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that Lydia was worried how she would match up and I really<br/>
think she needed to find out on her own just how normal or abnormal (<br/>
[:O] ) she/we are.  So, this year she has decided to give school a try. <br/>
About a month before school started she was really pushing me, her dad<br/>
and her brother away.  It was hard on everyone.<br/>
<br/>
The night of her orientation (meet the teacher night, 2 days before<br/>
school started) we were walking up to the school.  This attitude<br/>
overtook her and I could tell she wanted to separate herself from me.  I<br/>
leaned over and said (if you knew me, I&#39;m pretty sarcastic and we play-<br/>
tease fairly often in our home) &quot;hey!  Look around at all the rest of<br/>
these dorky parents...I&#39;m not THAT bad!!&quot;  She looked around, smiled and<br/>
her attitude change for the better.  We went through orientation<br/>
together and it was good.<br/>
<br/>
Well, we&#39;re almost 2 weeks into school.  She is really enjoying meeting<br/>
all the kids and is making a lot of friends.  But, for the last three<br/>
nights she&#39;s had 2-3 hours of homework and it is mindless, worthless,<br/>
rote memorization type stuff (to be honest, this school is just proving<br/>
to her what I&#39;ve said all along!).  She&#39;s exhausted from it.  It is<br/>
totally interfering with all the things she does enjoy doing.<br/>
<br/>
As we were laying in her bed tonight she said &quot;can I skip school<br/>
tomorrow&quot; and I told her it was her choice.  She says she really doesn&#39;t<br/>
like a lot of the stuff at school (except the friends part).  She then<br/>
asked me what I would do.  In Iowa we do have an option of dual<br/>
enrollment so she could take some classes and do some activities.  I<br/>
just told her the options and told her it&#39;s her decision.<br/>
<br/>
I suggested she keep going until she really knows what she wants.  I<br/>
told her not to give up on meeting homeschool friends, and I told her<br/>
that most of her friendships will come from things she has in common<br/>
with people.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I think if a mother has any fear that school is more fun than home,<br/>
&gt; home is not nearly fun enough.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Man this quote hits home.  I&#39;ve wondered if there is more I could be<br/>
doing.  And, of course there is.  And if she gives home another try,<br/>
I&#39;ll try even harder to meet her needs.<br/>
<br/>
But I can say that I have NO regrets in giving her the freedom to chose<br/>
her own path.  If anything, it has made our relationship stronger.  She<br/>
has found out that she&#39;s not behind, she&#39;s great at making friends, many<br/>
kids wish they didn&#39;t have to go to school, that we&#39;re not abnormal and<br/>
that she&#39;ll be able to make an informed decision!<br/>
<br/>
You may dislike the thought of your child going to school but really it<br/>
will be a completely different experience for her since it&#39;s not<br/>
compulsory!  I think at such a young age (pre-K) you&#39;ll be able to meet<br/>
her needs at home.  But you&#39;ve got to put in the work.  Maybe you&#39;re not<br/>
as social as she is, and if that&#39;s the case step out of your comfort<br/>
zone.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What if your husband judged what you could and couldn&#39;t read based on  <br/>
what you looked like when you read? You&#39;re probably showing the most  <br/>
engagement when you&#39;re reading aloud to the children. So you&#39;re  <br/>
apparent lack of engagement based on your expression when you read a  <br/>
mainstream novel would justify him limiting you to children&#39;s books?<br/>
<br/>
People who are stressed or bored veg out. People who are happy and  <br/>
whole don&#39;t need to.<br/>
<br/>
If she&#39;s choosing TV it&#39;s because she wants to watch TV. But she may  <br/>
be choosing TV because it&#39;s the least boring thing available. Just  <br/>
because the pretend play looks more engaging, doesn&#39;t mean that it  <br/>
is. If you weren&#39;t stressed or tired, would *you* choose something  <br/>
dull on TV over a good book? You feel like a good mom when you make  <br/>
her do what *looks* engaging.<br/>
<br/>
That said, it could be she&#39;s not playing when she chooses TV because  <br/>
she prefers to have someone to play with. It could be the TV feels  <br/>
like friends and people interacting (to a limited extent) with her.  <br/>
By cutting off the &quot;people&quot; you don&#39;t make the need for people go  <br/>
away but you can make it look *to you* like it&#39;s gone away and make  <br/>
yourself feel better.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooled kids shouldn&#39;t be watching TV alone. That doesn&#39;t mean we  <br/>
need to park ourselves next to them but we should watch enough  <br/>
episodes so we can have intelligent conversations, watch them  <br/>
watching so we can get an idea of what it is they love about the  <br/>
shows. We should be nearby to answer questions and talk about it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think the biggest factor missing is the people. It&#39;s not that she&#39;s  <br/>
less engaged when watching alone. It&#39;s that there aren&#39;t people to  <br/>
watch it with.<br/>
<br/>
If you watch a TV show by yourself, especially one that no one else  <br/>
in the house particularly likes, do you behave exactly the same while  <br/>
you watch it and afterwards as you do with a movie the whole family  <br/>
enjoyed together?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Instead, when the TV is on less, she engages more, &quot;loses herself&quot; in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you want your husband watching what you do and judging the quality  <br/>
of how you spend your time, then making decisions on what you can and  <br/>
can&#39;t do based on his observations? Wouldn&#39;t if feel yucky for him to  <br/>
be watching and controlling you like that?<br/>
<br/>
We should absolutely be observant of our kids to be aware of what&#39;s  <br/>
going on in their lives and to help them get more of what they&#39;re  <br/>
enjoying and expand their worlds. But it&#39;s better for unschooling to  <br/>
add to their world rather than subtract from it. If a child is  <br/>
watching a lot of TV and doesn&#39;t seem happy, rather than taking  <br/>
control of the TV, we need to add more to their lives so they have  <br/>
more options. Rather than pulling them away from something, draw them  <br/>
away with something even better. And if they do choose TV it&#39;s  <br/>
because they really want to watch something.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Because she&#39;s 2.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think my daughter deliberately sought out TV shows until she  <br/>
was 6 or 7. Before that she would watch TV with someone.<br/>
<br/>
One problem was, later during her prepuberty years when she watched a  <br/>
lot of TV, is that she felt disempowered by the programmers. It felt  <br/>
like she needed to watch what was on in case a new episode happened  <br/>
to show up. What helped that was TiVo. She could set it to record her  <br/>
favorites and watch them whenever. It helped her be in control and  <br/>
the amount of time she watched TV went down.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We won&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have to &quot;limit&quot; her time, it seems (at least at this point).<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>By limiting it, you&#39;re creating a rare and desired object. If she  <br/>
hasn&#39;t already, and depending on how much she likes TV, if you limit  <br/>
her to say an hour a day, she&#39;ll make sure she gets that hour  <br/>
everyday even if she doesn&#39;t love what she&#39;s watching. She&#39;ll try to  <br/>
sneak in more until you notice just because she needs to grab it when  <br/>
it&#39;s available because it&#39;s rare.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s human nature. Adults act the same way. If something&#39;s limited  <br/>
that they want, people will grab as much as they can when it&#39;s  <br/>
available.<br/>
<br/>

I went to England when I was in my mid-20&#39;s, and though I had people  <br/>
to stay with, I went to museums alone.  A few years later, I ended up  <br/>
stuck in DC when a friend&#39;s van broke down, and I went to the  <br/>
Smithsonian several days, alone.<br/>
<br/>
TERRIBLE.  And I probably looked &quot;vegged out&quot; or bored.   I *love*  <br/>
museums, but there I was just reading and looking by myself, with the  <br/>
same expression on my face when something was fantastic as when it  <br/>
was just a little lame, or the display wasn&#39;t even there.  I would  <br/>
wonder where it was and wonder what I was missing, but there was no  <br/>

When my kids were little there were shows they didn&#39;t want to miss,  <br/>
but they were willing to leave if we set the VCR to tape them.  Most  <br/>
of those tapes went unwatched, but they were freeing because the kids  <br/>
felt they could do two things at once.<br/>

Now they much prefer DVD and watching things online, because it&#39;s  <br/>
there when they want it.<br/>
