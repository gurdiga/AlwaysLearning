Okay, this answers my question. Thanks. I think I&#39;ve been too quick to pull <br/>
out the calculator on these questions. LOL! Although I *am* completely aware <br/>
of naturally flowing into all the other math that has come up so far. We&#39;ve <br/>
also covered multiplcation because it would be faster for one of the kids. I <br/>
think maybe we use estimating a lot more in a long division situation. If an <br/>
exact answer is needed, I pull out the calculator.<br/>
<br/>
I love your posts BTW Pam. They&#39;re always very helpful for me as I head out <br/>
into the teen years with my oldest. :o)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - I&#39;ve been trying to post more &quot;reality of life&quot; posts - so that people <br/>
don&#39;t get the impression that everything here always looks like eager <br/>
learning and that my kids go around saying, &quot;Oh - I can&#39;t WAIT to read that <br/>
calculus book&quot; or anything like that.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m satisfied with unschooling. It has fallen into place for me and makes <br/>
sense and feels totally just fine.<br/>
<br/>
But to FEEL fine about that means that I have to feel fine about them NOT <br/>
learning things that I deep down DO wish they would be interested in <br/>
learning. NOW!!! &lt;BEG&gt; I have to learn patience and have confidence.<br/>
<br/>
The way to feel fine about that is to accept it that there are going to be <br/>
gaps and delays and times when the kids don&#39;t appear to &quot;measure up&quot; to <br/>
school standards, etc., and know that there are times you might become more <br/>
aware of that as an issue and to, AT THE SAME TIME, be totally aware of and <br/>
amazed and wrapped up in the cool things they ARE learning and doing and <br/>
support and facilitate those. <br/>
<br/>
So - when the kids were littler - it helped me to watch what they were doing <br/>
and think about what they were getting out of it. They do everything for a <br/>
purpose, even if they appear to be &quot;just vegging&quot; I&#39;ve discovered that those <br/>
times are very very important for &quot;centering&quot; or &quot;integrating&quot; or whatever <br/>
you want to call it. I learned that after we did something that involved a <br/>
lot of new input -- going to a cool museum or a show or reading a fairly <br/>
intense book, for example, that they needed plenty of relaxed free play time <br/>
to really have the chance to reflect on what they&#39;d experienced and to put it <br/>
together with what they already knew and to just think about the way that new <br/>
knowledge or experience changed other things already in their head, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I just want to make it clear that those learning moments that look that <br/>
&quot;academic&quot; as the long division example, can be few and far between, it isn&#39;t <br/>
like that is how our lives are every minute of every day. But they do happen.<br/>
<br/>
I was alerted to look for the value of what the kids chose to do on their <br/>
own, a long time ago, when my sister&#39;s son was standing, a dazed look on his <br/>
face, with his finger poked into a little hole in an old junky piece of <br/>
furniture. He was &quot;feeling&quot; the padding inside - pulling it out - poking it <br/>
in - rubbing it between his fingers. My sister and I were ready to go <br/>
somewhere and she saw what he was doing and stopped and said, &quot;Wait - let <br/>
Alex finish.&quot; I had no kids yet and was sort of dumbfounded - wait for him to <br/>
finish what? He didn&#39;t appear to be DOING anything. My sister pointed out <br/>
that he was experiencing the texture of that padding - and experimenting with <br/>
how it felt and how he could shape and reshape it and so on -- anyway - she <br/>
was very sensitive to the fact that he was mesmerized by the whole thing - it <br/>
was a very sensual experience for him. He was 3 or 4 years old. I was SO <br/>
impressed and from that moment on I watched children and realized that <br/>
whatever they do, there is a reason, and that, whenever possible, adults <br/>
would be well advised to respect it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I so agree. :o) I had a similar moment as that in your story. It involved my <br/>
daughter, my sister-in-law and a bottle of glue. My Casey learned more <br/>
squeezing out that bottle of glue than she ever could have by gluing things <br/>
down like she was &quot;supposed to&quot;.<br/>

Life is good.<br/>
