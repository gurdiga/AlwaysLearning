<div id="ygrps-yiv-1912047713">lexie just made the point for me.  I&#39;m watching The Pelican Brief on <br/>
TNT, and there was an ad for Pirates.  The ad said &quot;Only on Direct TV&quot; <br/>
and I hear Lexie saying, in a very sarcastic voice, &quot;no, only on DVD, <br/>
with special features, and you can watch it over and over again for one <br/>
price!&quot; <br/>
