<div id="ygrps-yiv-1661977613">I finally was prodded properly (by Cindy Fox -- Thank you!) to look  <br/>
into domain names. And now people can type in:<br/>
<br/>
joyfullyrejoycing<br/>
<br/>
into their browsers and it will go to my website. (As will the fuller  <br/>
versions:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://www.joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com</a><br/>
<br/>
of course.)<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if anyone finds any problems with it.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing you need to remember is to misspell rejoicing as  <br/>
rejoycing but I&#39;ve typed rejoycing into Google in the past to see if  <br/>
that would be a quick way to get to my site and found that lots of  <br/>
people don&#39;t know how to spell rejoicing ;-) I can&#39;t spell it right  <br/>
anymore either!)<br/>
<br/>
The old address that no one could remember will redirect to the new  <br/>
host but I may drop Earthlink at some point so you may want to make  <br/>
the change to any links you have now. Just replace:<br/>
