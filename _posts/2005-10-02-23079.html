<div id="ygrps-yiv-1423220072">&quot;I love this reasoning &quot;what you like and what you don&#39;t like&quot;.<br/>
But there are such things as good and bad, like an apple vs. cotton<br/>
candy.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But we don&#39;t need to label foods &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;. Maybe there are more<br/>
nutritious foods than others, but seeing them as good or bad only<br/>
means our children WANT to choose &quot;bad&quot; things. Why put that burden on<br/>
a little person learning to listen to their own bodies?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my children feeling they make &quot;bad&quot; choices when they<br/>
want a root beer or cotton candy. I like those things sometimes too!<br/>
Life is short, why lay guilt on children for choosing foods that taste<br/>
great?<br/>

because the parent thinks the kid ought to have a piece of fruit with  <br/>
lunch? Not good.<br/>
<br/>
A treat of cotton candy bought by a loving parent during a really fun  <br/>
family outing that will be remembered sweetly by all of them for many  <br/>
years? VERY good.<br/>
