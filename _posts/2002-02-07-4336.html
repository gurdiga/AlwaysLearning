It&#39;s my birthday today (41) and I had a GREAT day planned by my partner and <br/>
son. At midnight last night they brought cake in.  Then this morning I got 41 <br/>
presents (mostly little fun things), and then we had an Artist Day, with the <br/>

<br/>
Great fun!<br/>

turning 40 (stupid, yes), and I was surprised with: a video/digital camera, a <br/>
HUGE surprise party, AND a trip to London.<br/>
<br/>
I have a VERY good family :)<br/>

flowered lei, a tiger print change purse, a heart straw, a giant pink die, a <br/>
heart shped Pez dispenser, little tiny soaps, a little square yoyo, jacks, <br/>
play money, a five color pen, a cat nose, etc.  All of them came with little <br/>
lovey explanations (&quot;When you&#39;re down, he yoy will remind you that they&#39;ll be <br/>
up again.&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
I was Kathie (Kathie Jean to relatives, as I had an aunt Cathy) until college <br/>
when I started calling myself Kathryn. I am patient with relatives who call <br/>
me Kathie.<br/>
