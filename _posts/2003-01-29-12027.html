<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077844361">I took the dog out for her last-pee-of-the-day a few nights ago and as <br/>
we walked into the front yard I became aware of the strangest sounds <br/>
coming from somewhere behind the houses across the street and from our <br/>
next-door neighbor&#39;s back yard. They sounded like high-pitched <br/>
warbling, sort of, or sound effects for a space invasion movie <br/>
involving little creatures flying through the air. I can&#39;t explain it. <br/>
Dogs were barking all over the neighborhood and I got that feeling of <br/>
hair standing up on the back of my neck.<br/>
<br/>
I came in the house and told my husband and daughter about it, but <br/>
couldn&#39;t quite describe what it was or why it had seemed so weird. A <br/>
friend later told me it was coyotes--that they bark and warble like <br/>
that and form circles around their prey (which would have been my <br/>
little dog if she hadn&#39;t been on a leash with me in attendance!). I <br/>
called the city police yesterday and they confirmed that we have a lot <br/>
of them in this area.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a big suburb of a large metropolitan area!<br/>

Irish Terrier (we inherited him when my grandpa died, and my grandpa used<br/>
to beat him, so it&#39;s somewhat understandable) who barked at<br/>
hallucinations and never was fully housetrained and ran away a lot. Once<br/>
the paperboy found him outside at 5 am surrounded by a pack of coyotes,<br/>
and rescued him. I&#39;m pretty sure my cat was a coyote victim, too...<br/>
<br/>
We also used to have javalinas that would come right up to the gate, a<br/>
whole family of them.<br/>
<br/>
Last night I was walking Nan out on the farm, and since it&#39;s really empty<br/>
right now (no crops, no leaves on the trees) we could hear a long way.<br/>
We&#39;re heard coyotes before... last night we could hear sheep (some of the<br/>
folks around here keep sheep n the winter) and some yipping, barking<br/>
noises. We couldn&#39;t figure out if it was coyotes at the sheep, the<br/>
sheepdogs with the sheep, or coyotes and dogs with the sheep. I&#39;m<br/>
guessing it was all three....<br/>
