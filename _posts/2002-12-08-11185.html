<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076114325">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
We all made it through yesterday with little fuss. The fussing that started in<br/>
the am, probably a result of my own fussing, ended. I shared a few tears with<br/>
Tim. Ashley had a blast. Turns out about 2 other non-family families hung out<br/>
with the party too, with siblings. I&#39;ll try not to take it personally. My<br/>
little ones were bummed, but not so terribly this time. Maturity, I guess.<br/>
Hardened from the previous years. What gets me so much is the Birthday Girl<br/>
really doesn&#39;t care one way or the other if we come. Her mom is the one who<br/>
decides who comes, controlling the situation. This is why I call it a game.<br/>
It&#39;s a game of exclusion and its played often here from this family.Riley is<br/>
the one who gets excluded the most. You can come inside today, but he can<br/>
not... So really it is no surprise that every year someone does not get to<br/>
come. Power, plane and simple.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone read about the forms of girl aggression? My hubby told me about a<br/>
book which addresses this issue and it turns out that girls/women are<br/>
aggressive by excluding. If you know the author, let my know.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Happily on the other side of this party.</div>

<br/>
I guess when it comes to birthday parties I have to say up front that <br/>
I feel it is up to the birthday child and their parents to decide who <br/>
does or does not come.  The parents foot the bill and either risk <br/>
their home and whatever damage is done, or must organize a suitable <br/>
party venue at their expense.  So the decision isn&#39;t solely up to the <br/>
child.  And children are learning to make decisions, too, not out of <br/>
exclusion, but just time, space, and economic factors.  <br/>
<br/>
My daughter loves birthday celebrations and every year she plans <br/>
something very special.  We are very low income so this is a big deal <br/>
for her.  We always look for the best bargains we can find, but ones <br/>
that will be memorable.  <br/>
<br/>
When my daughter was 8 she had 8 friends visit the local children&#39;s <br/>
museum to run and play, then home for outdoor games and activities <br/>
and a cookout, then spend the night in a big tent in our yard, then <br/>
a &quot;champagne&quot; breakfast (sparkling cider).  She made all the choices <br/>
along the way.  The decision to camp out helped determine how many <br/>
kids could come because the tent could only sleep a certain number.  <br/>
The museum was free because my husband is a public safety officer <br/>
there so numbers weren&#39;t as important there.  Hauling kids from the <br/>
museum to our home also limited the number to how many we could fit <br/>
in our two cars since we didn&#39;t get any other parent/volunteers who <br/>
were willing to stick around for the whole party and drive kids back <br/>
and forth.  The overnight campout helped her decide to limit it to <br/>
girls, her decision, because we only had one tent.  And then she had <br/>
to choose who she was going to invite.  This was difficult, but she <br/>
chose her own list, for her own reasons.  This made it much easier <br/>
for her to understand when others had parties to which she was not <br/>
invited.  She made sure that others who weren&#39;t invited to her party <br/>
understood that she could only invite a limited number for this <br/>
party, that she couldn&#39;t invite everyone.  She also made a point of <br/>
inviting others to do other things with us at other times.  <br/>
<br/>
For another birthday, recently, at age 15, she also had to limit the <br/>
number for a day of wonderful freebies she had collected with comps <br/>
and passes.  The day included a trip to the museum to see a special <br/>
OmniMax film (Dad got comp tickets for everyone), free passes to ice <br/>
skate (she had earned these working at the ice rink), then a return <br/>
to our house to make individual personal pan pizzas (I made the dough <br/>
ahead of time and provided the cake pans for each person&#39;s pizza, but <br/>
she organized all the topping ingredients).  At the house she also <br/>
planned to do henna tattoos and chalk art on the backyard blacktop, <br/>
with music for dancing.  This was a mixed group.  Again, the <br/>
limitations were who could fit in our two cars to go between the <br/>
museum and the ice rink and our house, and who she wanted to have <br/>
attending who&#39;d be willing to participate in these activities; who <br/>
would enjoy doing these things.  A fun time was had by all, but it <br/>
was a limited group.<br/>
<br/>
Back to my comment about damage that can be done in the home.  At one <br/>
of my daughter&#39;s early teen parties she did invite a few more kids <br/>
since it was all at our house.  Our house is small, but she invited <br/>
about 15 this time, including two girls she didn&#39;t know very well.  <br/>
These two were large girls, who somehow ended up sitting on two of my <br/>
antique wooden chairs, chairs that had long supported my oversize <br/>
poundage without a problem, but for reasons unknown these two girls <br/>
utterly destroyed these antiques and family heirlooms.  I mean they <br/>
were crushed, broken, shattered in multiple places.  One was a <br/>
Windsor arm chair in cherry and the other was a bent oak captain&#39;s <br/>
arm chair.  Neither the girls nor their parents offered to pay for <br/>
the damage they caused, to help repair the chairs.  We didn&#39;t ask <br/>
them to, either.  They never even apologized.  I guess they were <br/>
surprised, too, and embarassed.  I was totally taken off guard, never <br/>
expecting anything like this.  <br/>
<br/>
At the same party something happened to our six month old DVD player <br/>
while the teens were attempting to watch a movie they had selected <br/>
and it went kaput!  So that nice &quot;at home&quot; party ended up being a <br/>
very expensive party, especially on our limited income.  It was <br/>
several years ago and we still haven&#39;t been able to repair those <br/>
chairs or replace that DVD player.  Again my daughter learned some <br/>
important lessons about these kinds of decisions.  So, yes, I feel <br/>
that parents should have a say.  Not as a power/control issue, but as <br/>
the ones who must live with the consequences, or haul kids around in <br/>
our vehicles, or foot the bill for whatever the kids are doing. <br/>
<br/>
On the other side of things my daughter experienced real exclusion <br/>
from the local homeschool community when a few moms planned a <br/>
homeschool prom, unbeknownst to us.  We heard about this prom from <br/>
one of the girls who was planning to go and who innocently asked if <br/>
my daughter was going.  She said, no, she didn&#39;t know anything about <br/>
it.  The girl told her a little about it.  I then posted something to <br/>
my e-list asking if anyone knew the details so everyone who might be <br/>
interested could know about this event.  I didn&#39;t get any clear <br/>
response, but some interesting evasive answers.  <br/>
<br/>
Then one day at the ice rink (we spend a lot of time at the ice rink) <br/>
a mom showed up who doesn&#39;t usually show up there and she sat down <br/>
and talked to me for quite a while.  Innocent enough, I thought, but <br/>
sort of a strange conversation.  Next thing I know I get an email <br/>
from this mom informing me that &quot;they&quot; had decided that my daughter <br/>
could not attend the homeschool prom.  Very interesting, because the <br/>
subject of the homeschool prom never came up in our conversation at <br/>
the ice rink.  Truth is that my daughter already had plans to attend <br/>
three other formal dances at local high schools and could not have <br/>
attended another prom even if she had wanted to do so.  But no one <br/>
had bothered to ask.  Some moms just assumed that because I was <br/>
inquiring about the event that my daughter wanted to attend.  <br/>
<br/>
The bottom line on this was that even though my daughter could not <br/>
have attended, was attending another prom on the same night as this <br/>
homeschool prom, she was being intentionally and pointedly shunned <br/>
and excluded by fellow homeschoolers.  Why?  Never could get an <br/>
answer on that.  The folks doing the shunning chose to spread lies <br/>
instead of answering my e-list query.  Word got back to me, in the <br/>
form of an email, that I had already been told why by one of the <br/>
organizing moms in a phone call I had supposedly made to her in which <br/>
she told me that my daughter was not welcome and why, and in which <br/>
she alleged that I had argued with her and she had ultimately hung <br/>
up.  Wow!  If it had been in a court of law I would have demanded <br/>
phone records for her to prove those allegations, because there was <br/>
no phone call.  None of this ever happened.  But I learned to what <br/>
extent some folks will go to cover their exclusionary behavior.<br/>
<br/>
So, why, you might ask, were these moms so determined to keep my <br/>
daughter away from this prom?  My daughter is multi-racial.  Her <br/>
father is black and I am  Cherokee/French/Welsh/Irish.  She is a <br/>
beautiful young woman, poised and well-behaved, a dedicated <br/>
competitive figure skater with 8 years of skating behind her, aiming <br/>
for the U. S. Nationals.  I really don&#39;t know why she would be the <br/>
only homeschooler in our large metro area who was definitively <br/>
shunned and excluded from this homeschool prom, but I can guess, and <br/>
any of my guesses are not nice.  But then racism and bigotry have <br/>
been around for a long time.  Turns out that pretty girls from mixed <br/>
racial backgrounds are not so welcome when some moms start looking at <br/>
these girls as potential lifemates for their sons.  Obviously these <br/>
moms haven&#39;t done much work in genetics or biology, let alone <br/>
morality.  But whatever the cause, my daughter cried a little at <br/>
being so directly excluded, but went to her three proms and had a <br/>
great time. <br/>
<br/>
So, yes, exclusion hurts, but I have never felt &quot;left out&quot; when it <br/>
was a birthday party.  I figure that based on our own experiences <br/>
this type of party has so many built in limitations that it isn&#39;t a <br/>
big deal.  Then there are other bigger issues out there, kinds of <br/>
exclusion involving race and economics that really do hurt and for <br/>
which we take the time to work through how we can best handle  <br/>
interfaces with other people&#39;s self-imposed limitations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1662763890">&lt;&lt;You can come inside today but he can not&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We used to go through this with a neighbor who only had one female child.<br/>
The mom liked her dd to play with my oldest dd who is quiet and oh so<br/>
feminine but shuddered every time she saw my younger son coming up her walk.<br/>
The mom took his rambunctiousness as being poorly behaved and frankly he got<br/>
on her nerves.  Anytime the boys wanted to be included, they weren&#39;t allowed<br/>
to play in these peoples&#39; home.  It got yucky but I talked to Zach about<br/>
different people having different comfort levels and made sure he found some<br/>
friends whose parents actually loved him.<br/>
<br/>
But we have also been on the other side of the fence.  Little neighbor girl<br/>
that my dd did not like whatsoever.  Parents were determined that our girls<br/>
be friends.  Kept sending dd over to play and my dd would beg me to answer<br/>
the door and make excuses.  Little girl would try to barge in.  I finally<br/>
talked with the mom as gently as I could but all I got was grief because<br/>
Adriane didn&#39;t invite the little girl to her birthday party.  I refused to<br/>
make Adriane not be the star of her own birthday and didn&#39;t force Adriane to<br/>
invite the little girl.  It got ugly with the little girl yelling things out<br/>
her door at Adriane.<br/>
<br/>
Adriane only wanted the right to choose her own friends.<br/>
<br/>
(Not saying this is what is happening with the other kids being discussed at<br/>
all)<br/>
