<br/>
I&#39;m way on the late end of the international collection of time zones,  <br/>
so this is already in full swing in most of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Could some of you who are the very organized type bring this up next  <br/>
fall in time for people to organize parties or something, please?     <br/>
If I put it on a calendar, I&#39;ll lose the calendar.  I even lose online  <br/>
calendars; seriously.  I&#39;m the one who put it up on facebook, many  <br/>
months ago, and then Holly told me a while ago that it was there.<br/>
