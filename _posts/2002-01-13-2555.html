<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Each year the Washington Post&#39;s Style Invitational asks readers to take <br/>
&gt;&gt;any word from the dictionary, alter it by adding, subtracting, or changing <br/>
&gt;&gt;one letter and supply a new definition.&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here are the 2001 winners<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Intaxication: Euphoria at getting a tax refund, which<br/>
&gt;lasts until you realize it was your money to start with.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Reintarnation: Coming back to life as a hillbilly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Foreploy: Any misrepresentation about yourself for the<br/>
&gt;purpose of getting laid.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Giraffiti: Vandalism spray-painted very, very high.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Sarchasm: The gulf between the author of sarcastic wit<br/>
&gt;and the person who doesn&#39;t get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Inoculatte: To take coffee intravenously when you<br/>
&gt;are running late.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Hipatitis: Terminal coolness.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Osteopornosis: A degenerate disease. (this one got<br/>
&gt;extra credit)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Karmageddon: It&#39;s like, when everybody is sending<br/>
&gt;off all these really bad vibes, right? And then, like,<br/>
&gt;the Earth explodes and it&#39;s like, a serious bummer.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Glibido: All talk and no action.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Dopeler Effect: The tendency of stupid ideas to seem<br/>
&gt;smarter when they come at you rapidly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;And, the pick of the literature:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Ignoranus: A person who&#39;s both stupid and an asshole.<br/>
&gt;(Anyone you know?)<br/>
<br/>

We do this in my family, make up new words.  Dylan was reading today and<br/>
I asked if he wanted to come to the store with me, he said &quot;can you wait<br/>
a few minutes &#39;til I&#39;m disenpaged?&quot;  <br/>
