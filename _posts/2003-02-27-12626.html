<div id="ygrps-yiv-1451490179">For the past 2 days my son (aged 4 1/2) has watched Chitty Chitty Bang Bang<br/>
4 times in a row each day (it&#39;s a 2 1/2 hr movie!).  Last night he played<br/>
with legos after tiring of the movie.  Today he played legos all day<br/>
building flying cars :).  Earlier in the week he played with some old fisher<br/>
price stuff.<br/>
<br/>
DD, 8, had read Harry Potter, played outside, and played on the computer a<br/>
lot.  She&#39;s also spent time building legos and watching TV.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, they play all day.  But it goes in spurts.  Sometimes they watch a lot<br/>
of TV (they&#39;re hooked on TVLand&#39;s MacGyver reruns, which sparks lots of<br/>
conversations about ethics, friendship, science, etc).<br/>
<br/>
I never know what they&#39;ll do on any given day.  They learn from anything and<br/>
everything.<br/>

would sit on the hammock and sing the song and pretend we were in a flying <br/>
car.  LOL<br/>

and he attaches motors to many of them to make them work.<br/>

down that way ocassionally. We miss all the travelling and camping that we<br/>
used to do..but with the farm and milking goats, its very hard to be<br/>
away..just a different season of our life right now.<br/>

This is so cool.. there are unschoolers closer than I realized..but still<br/>
not close enough to come for a tea party..or a sample of goat cheese..Ha..<br/>
We live very near Cape..not far from Poplar Bluff at all.<br/>
