<div id="ygrps-yiv-1925821485">I just wanted to take a minute to say thank you  all. in the last few <br/>
days I have recived many   post and  e-mails from many of you  with <br/>
words of encourgement and  many of you have reduced me to tears.I <br/>
feel like the battle is not un-winnable now. <br/>
i spent about a hour (ok maybe more) talking today to  one  parent I <br/>
know home schools. and dont seem to be doing it the same as others i <br/>
have know.  she told me  hey i brought all the fancy books tryed to <br/>
do it  lil a mini school and gee it didnt work when they did it what <br/>
makes me think it would work at home.(she only  checks out  the <br/>
cirrculim books and adapets them for paper work and  the child seldom <br/>
uses them unless she desires to)  no she had never herd of un <br/>
schooling but was quick to point out we live  real close to  the <br/>
ommish  commuinty. and told me some of the pit falls trying to home <br/>
school in jhonson co. Iowa. The Omish  school in  kolona, Iowa <br/>
(Wasinton Co.) will  let you use them as the teacher to over look(as <br/>
in  ok u come to  a few of our homeschool outing with group and we <br/>
see her with you) as long as they see the kid a few times a year and <br/>
do it at no cost and  will let you take them on there outings and <br/>
teach  how to make a day at the park  credited. and how to write it <br/>
up for the system. and she told me  look I only been doing this a  <br/>
school year but I think like you if the school is only offering her <br/>
ridacule no help and begging you to put her on drugs maybe  you need <br/>
to fight the system. she still has 2 in school and  one in my <br/>
daughters class and  said you need to get her out!!! Fire the  <br/>
counsler and the school!(gee think i felt that and have herd it from <br/>
so many here) and  then she rembered she was addopted and  said i <br/>
need to find out about Iowa law is she mine  or is she going to be <br/>
under what they want?<br/>
 I think it like any adoption. and should be ok.<br/>
I got a phone call from princable today  with lisa and girls making <br/>
her cry ext.  and oh by the way  she is behind in such and such. I <br/>
shocked him told him look I will give Lisa the opertuinty if she <br/>
wants to go back to school and finish this year out. If not I will <br/>
come get the papers in am. and as for her failing  I belive it is you <br/>
that have failed her, He asked do I intened to open enroll her or <br/>
dual inroll her I told him I will make that dession after I talked to <br/>
my daughter. He told me i needed to talk to superintendent when i <br/>
come get the papers.<br/>
When my daughter came home we had a long dission on it and the spring <br/>
music consert is tommorow and  she wants to finish out the year  it <br/>
is ony  a lil over 2 weeks. then  she wants to  not go back . we <br/>
talked about how it is the school failing and not her and that she <br/>
would be spending her time with mom and not at a desk. and can she <br/>
learn more about cooking and can she  do a experment on what   helps <br/>
plants grow in the yard and can she read whet she wants and oh mom <br/>
can we go to cedar rapids some time  and do the sience musem, and mom <br/>
can I still babysit? and can we not quit school  at least till after <br/>
my birthday (have a  free certific  for a limo to pick her and her <br/>
friends up for her birthday party)<br/>
a few days on this list have lifted  so much from my heart and made <br/>
me feel like yes  I can do this and all it will take is the willness <br/>
to unlearn for me and the love her and I  have.<br/>
I have a feeling i will need you all more in the times coming and yes <br/>
i promise to get book mentioned on frount of this  group page as soon <br/>
as I can budget it.<br/>
I also want to say thank you  from my lil Lisa as she thanked me! <br/>
and  she feels like  this is the answer she had a few questions on <br/>
how to and what if  but I  assured her it will work and we will be <br/>
fine and she can still be anything she wants to be in life.<br/>
  so as a huge weight has been lifted  from me I thank you  and as I  <br/>
have my doubts and  battles I hope this list will still be here. when <br/>
I started posting  here someone hinted this may not be be a good <br/>
begaining place for me it is the best beginning one can hope for. <br/>
next is all the legal stuff and so forth I am sure.<br/>
I belive we are on our way to healing and to life and  again I thank <br/>
you for your guidence and your guidence and support in the future.<br/>

<br/>
I want to recommend something that has more unschooling information than<br/>
any book, that is the message boards on unschooling.com<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.com">http://www.unschooling.com</a><br/>
<br/>
There are whole sections about Getting Started Unschooling and about<br/>
Unschooling with Special Needs.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s probably more information there than you can read in a month,<br/>
unless you read fast, and it&#39;s all free and immediately available.<br/>

As far as the law is concerned, once that child is adopted, they are equal to <br/>
a birth child.<br/>
The birth certificate is even changed to reflect you as the mother.<br/>
The law respects you as equal to a birth mother now. You have rights.<br/>

  I was adopted, with my signed consent because I was 12, by my step-dad.<br/>
The state (California) issued a new birth certificate with his name and<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So if the state can re-issue birth certificates, then a birth certificate <br/>
wouldn&#39;t even prove where you were born, would it?  So if I adopt a kid from <br/>
out of the country would I, in certain states, be issued a government <br/>
certificate saying he was born from me?<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly birth certificates seem so useless.  Yet that&#39;s what they base all <br/>
kinds of legality on from nationality (pretty important sometimes) to <br/>
driving, passports, retirement and social security.<br/>
<br/>
Very odd.<br/>

<br/>
No, it&#39;s common place. I am fairly confident that it&#39;s done in every state.<br/>
That is why it is so difficult for children adopted at birth to find their <br/>
birth parents! My dh was adopted at four months old, his birth certificate <br/>
was ammended upon finalization of adoption (adoptive parents never see the <br/>
birth cert. before that).<br/>
It shows his adoptive parents as the birth parents.<br/>
<br/>
My sibs that were adopted had the exact same thing done. In their case, they <br/>
stayed in touch with their sisters and birth father to some degree after the <br/>
adoption. So there was nothing being hidden. It&#39;s just what happens when <br/>
someone is adopted.<br/>
Birth certificates are re-issued with the adoptive parents names.<br/>
I&#39;d be very surprised if states didn&#39;t do this.<br/>
Otherwise the birth parents name would be easy to come by, no need for all <br/>
these laws protecting them!<br/>

It would be in the court records if it was handled by the state.<br/>
If you can hire a mediator to open the court records, the original birth <br/>
certificate should be there for them to use as a tool for a search. In your <br/>
case that wouldn&#39;t be necessary. <br/>
But that&#39;s exactly what I&#39;m doing for my dh.<br/>
I have searched on my own for years...I&#39;m done.<br/>
I&#39;m spending the money for a mediator to open the records and perform a <br/>
search.<br/>
<br/>
I will get none of the information from the court records. They will try to <br/>
find the birth mother and father and contact them.<br/>
If it is alright with them, we will then be put in contact by the mediator <br/>
and my dh will finally have some answers about his history.<br/>

messed up situation, involving money and power and greed, and in the end he <br/>
was the only victim.<br/>
