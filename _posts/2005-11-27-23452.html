<div id="ygrps-yiv-1431000815">Hi Everyone -<br/>
<br/>
I just joined and wanted to say &quot;hello&quot; to all.  I am a forty-<br/>
something mom to 4 kids.  Oldest is an RN and on her own now (she was <br/>
not homeschooled).  I have a 12 yo and two 7 yo&#39;s.  We have been <br/>
homeschooling for over 5 years, but only recently the light has <br/>
dawned for me that we are missing the boat.  I re-created school at <br/>
home for the first year, eased up a bit each succeeding year, and <br/>
finally have decided that I need to relax and enjoy my children (and <br/>
their education).  I can&#39;t believe the overwhelming feeling of relief <br/>
that this brings to our family.  Whew.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has the time to reply, I would love to hear some ideas from <br/>
those of you who can look back and say, &quot;I wish I would have <br/>
known....&quot; and share them with me.  My children and I are currently <br/>
enjoying the Children of the World and Religions of the World videos, <br/>
and we have learned a tremendous amount from watching them.  My 12 yo <br/>
spends a lot of time playing the piano and being relieved that she no <br/>
longer has to fret over Saxon 87 every morning.....my 7 yo son still <br/>
can&#39;t believe that it&#39;s &quot;OK&quot; to go on the Scholastic&#39;s Brain Play CD <br/>
rom even though we didn&#39;t &quot;do school&quot; yet....his 7 yo twin sister is <br/>
so easy to please, she&#39;s just plain happy to be able to stay in bed <br/>
till 10am and not rush to eat breakfast, brush her teeth, and hit the <br/>
books ;-)  <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to being a part of this group, and I thank in advance <br/>
any of you from the &quot;been there -- done that&quot; side of the fence who <br/>
offer words of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
