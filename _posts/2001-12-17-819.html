what others think.<br/>
<br/>
Good women friends &quot;vent&quot; to each other about things happening in their lives <br/>
- about their relationships and interactions with other people. And good <br/>
friends commiserate and analyze and toss out ideas and chew on the stuff <br/>
together. That is how we work through and understand relationships. It is <br/>
important work - it is women understanding relationships that tends to create <br/>
and hold communities together and talking about real-life situations and <br/>
issues is how women develop that understanding.<br/>
<br/>
If a friend comes to me and wants to talk about issues she has with someone <br/>
else - isn&#39;t it gossip and should I not tell her to keep it to herself, that <br/>
I don&#39;t want to hear it? Or is it a friend venting her frustrations and <br/>
negative feelings to me, a person she trusts? Or, should I listen and then <br/>
report what she said to the person she&#39;s talking about because it is only <br/>
fair that they ought to know what&#39;s being said about them?<br/>
<br/>
Just tossing some possibilities out there - I&#39;m interested in what you all <br/>
have to say.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-926427653">I find there&#39;s a line in there (sometimes more gray than black and white, <br/>
but there) that I can draw.<br/>
<br/>
If a friend says to me, &quot;I am so angry with Gloria. The last time she was<br/>
over she said I have a messy house, ugly children and a stupid dog, and<br/>
what&#39;s worse, my casserole recipe sucks&quot; I consider that venting. I will<br/>
make appropriate sympathetic noises about the hardships of life and move on.<br/>
<br/>
If a friend says to me, &quot;You&#39;re never going to believe what I heard about<br/>
Gloria. She&#39;s having an affair with a guy who looks like Kevin Costner, only<br/>
fatter&quot; I consider that gossip and will turn the subject.<br/>

OMG Pam we are living parallel lives LOL. This same issues has been<br/>
discussed at our park day discussion group and within smaller groups<br/>
of people. To avert gossip we (as a group) said &quot;the best way&quot; (nobody<br/>
has to, just that some folks thought it was a good idea) to handle <br/>
situations (ie, child misbehavior) was to go directly to the parent first.<br/>
If did not get response from parent (should try more than once if repeated<br/>
offence) it would be ok to go to other friends to discuss situation, to<br/>
get feedback or even to warn other parents about said child&#39;s behaviors.<br/>
I do this all the time. This is how I think best through discussion with<br/>
close friends.  As to your last statement I would not get involved in a<br/>
she said she said situation where one gossips and you go tell on them.<br/>
That could get very icky.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I hate groups deciding how I have to be.  I know you said nobody has to, but <br/>
if that&#39;s the group&#39;s policy, not following it is uncooperative.<br/>
<br/>
Two stories--one ten years old (names are common and kids have moved to <br/>
opposite ends of the country), and one one day old:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had a family in a babysitting co-op in which the little boy had been <br/>
sexualized (by a neighbor, or vice versa; ultimately we came to think it was <br/>
by the mom, and the neighbor might be a victim too).<br/>
<br/>
He was messing with other kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I discovered it when he and Kirby were away for a five day fishing trip in <br/>
another state in a cabin without a phone.  How thrilled do you think I was??  <br/>
Marty told me &quot;Michael told me to feel Holly&#39;s bones, and we did.&quot;  It <br/>
involved putting their fingers inside a girl a year old.  Marty was three, <br/>
came upon Michael messing with Holly, and Michael implicated Marty.<br/>
<br/>
So I checked with other families and came up with four other incidents, <br/>
usually with boys.  Each family had assumed it no big deal, hadn&#39;t wanted to <br/>
talk to the mom, hadn&#39;t wanted to gossip, just told their own child not to be <br/>
alone with him.<br/>
<br/>
And in fact, the mom had told me one day &quot;Michael needs to keep his clothes <br/>
on when he&#39;s playing.&quot;  I said okay without asking why.  In NONE of the <br/>
incidents did Michael have pants off.  She had never said &quot;And your kids <br/>
probably should too.&quot;  It was summer, and every day was water-day and <br/>
sandbox-mud-day.<br/>
<br/>
So as soon as the family came home I talked to the mom, who had been a really <br/>
close friend of mine, as peacefully and sympathetically as I could, figuring <br/>
we would figure out something positive and compassionate.  She wanted to <br/>
offer to pay for counseling for my kids.  I said they were fine, that wasn&#39;t <br/>
necessary.  She said if it had been Lauren (a five year old; Kirby and <br/>
Michael were six) it would have been okay, but that Holly was just a baby and <br/>
that wasn&#39;t okay.  <br/>
<br/>
I had a huge physical wave of fear go down me.  I still remember the feeling. <br/>
 We were on her front porch where the boys couldn&#39;t hear us.  I said, &quot;So <br/>
you&#39;re saying it would have been okay with you if he had stuck his finger up <br/>
a five year old girl?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She stopped, got quiet, and didn&#39;t look at me.  The question had <br/>
short-circuited her thoughts and the dialog was pretty much over.  <br/>
<br/>
She hadn&#39;t been happy that I had inquired of other families.  She had known <br/>
NONE of it, though.  She was denying that Michael was a problem.  She said <br/>
&quot;All kids play at sex.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
They don&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
[Kirby hadn&#39;t had any problems, and I didn&#39;t figure he would, because between <br/>
the two of those boys Kirby was the dominant idea-getter.]<br/>
<br/>
So anti-gossip rules don&#39;t solve all, and go-to-the-mom rules don&#39;t either.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the thing to do is for each mom to use her own judgment about how to <br/>
deal with stuff.  Some have NO ability to be confrontational and will need a <br/>
go-between.  It&#39;s not a sin to ask for help.  <br/>
<br/>
This weekend we had ten houseguests.  One was a mom with two kids, and her <br/>
treatment of them grated on me worse and worse all weekend.  I told the <br/>
person who had arranged for them to stay with us.  (It was crash space for a <br/>
medieval feast; they had driven from Colorado Springs.).  She talked to the <br/>
leader of the group the woman was in.  He said he had issues with the way she <br/>
talks to her kids and treats them too, but didn&#39;t know how to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
So now, because of some communication, he knows the problem is bad enough <br/>
that she&#39;s not welcome here next year (she&#39;s been here three years, but only <br/>
had the baby last year as an infant and this year as a beginning toddler).<br/>
<br/>
What turned the tide for me was her saying &quot;that little shit&quot; about her eight <br/>
year old son, while he was one room away.  I don&#39;t have to have that in my <br/>
house.  I defended him in the story analysis (he hadn&#39;t been where he said he <br/>
would be when they were ready to go, but for good reason--and I know that <br/>
building and those people and easily saw the kid&#39;s side).  I made a couple of <br/>
suggestions casually about how to keep the baby from crying.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m considering writing to the mom, because if she never likes me anymore it <br/>
doesn&#39;t matter.  And if she&#39;ll treat her kids better it will be good for all <br/>
mankind.  And the wife of that same group leader is pregnant, and I would <br/>
much hate for her to take the other mom&#39;s actions as any sort of model or <br/>
pattern.<br/>

<br/>
I probably didn&#39;t word what I was trying to say very well.  We were having<br/>
a discussion, and the concensus was that it was a good idea to go to<br/>
other mom first etc etc.  Some folks were asking the same question (as Pam)<br/>
in our group, what is/isn&#39;t gossip.  Out of the 25 folks there 10 of us were<br/>
speaking to that topic.  And not all of us agreed on everything.  No one<br/>
took notes. No rules were made.  No one is in charge of seeing that<br/>
anyone follows any guidelines.   Our group doesn&#39;t have a policy of any<br/>
kind, we only have a mission statement originally written by our founder<br/>
(you know her Sandra, its Charlie Miles&#39; old group in So. CA) .<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I agree.  I have had to deal with kid incidents lately, what seems to be a <br/>
lot.<br/>
I have had to talk through them quite a bit before I was able to discuss it<br/>
with the other parents involved.  Some folks I am able to go right up to<br/>
them and speak up, others I have a really hard time and there are actually<br/>
two families that I know that the parents are so unresponsive (my child<br/>
would never...) that I don&#39;t even bother.  Luckily we don&#39;t see them hardly<br/>
ever.  So your right every situation is going to be different that is for <br/>
sure.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743705249">Good Grief!! It never ends!!! You get your own house<br/>
cleaned and here comes the rest of the world tromping<br/>
yuck all over!!It does seem that other people could<br/>
stop the abuse cycle with their own awareness! But<br/>
nope. Most have to have their faces pushed right into<br/>
it! And their butts kicked, too!<br/>
<br/>
Poor little guys.....who will grow up (maybe). Will<br/>
they ever know better?<br/>
<br/>
Oooo I get so mad! I don&#39;t care if &quot;mother&quot; like the<br/>
ones you described like me or not, either. I do tend<br/>
to be a buttinski.....once I had to leave a public<br/>
(but isolated) beach and find some law enforcement to<br/>
help with a situation that was getting progressively<br/>
more dangerous......my intervention didn&#39;t help at<br/>
all....then there are the idiots who put ice cubes in<br/>
the babies diapers &quot;cause they look so cute when they<br/>
squirm&quot;!! and on and on. <br/>
<br/>
If a person behaves in a decent way they should have<br/>
no fear of gossip. Asking for understanding of<br/>
something that seems alien is not gossip.  Gossip<br/>
isn&#39;t necessarily bad, anyway.  Discussing who married<br/>
who and who dates who and who just did what and who is<br/>
ill or better or who has a birthday coming up is how<br/>
we find out....<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t get too far in reading of the posts to find<br/>
out what you replied to....your personal experiences<br/>
just woke me up, again. Thanks, Sandra.  We can&#39;t ever<br/>
let those sensors relax, even in our own homes.<br/>
<br/>
To feel that wave of fear....and then actually<br/>
confront the source is BRAVERY.  That is an aspect<br/>
MOTHER LOVE that is sometimes hard to manifest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again<br/>

thing that can happen to a kid.  You wonder if anything can ever be right<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That is partly the question. This doesn&#39;t have to do with kids behavior <br/>
necessarily, though. That seems to me to be a slightly different issue. My <br/>
question is really about gossip among adults.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, you and I have talked before about men calling it gossip when women <br/>
are doing relationship work. My questions are really coming from that basis.<br/>
<br/>
How do we draw the line between being a good friend who is listening to <br/>
someone vent and rant and say negative things about someone else and who is <br/>
commiserating and offering a sympathetic response versus gossip that should <br/>
just be stopped by telling the person you don&#39;t want to hear it, for example.<br/>
<br/>
Second, when should someone &quot;report&quot; on what they&#39;ve been told in this kind <br/>
of context - women who are supposedly good friends talking privately about <br/>
their feelings and issues. <br/>

tell the lie-spreader that you won&#39;t keep a secret about who&#39;s telling <br/>
the lies.  Depending on what the lie is and if I know anything about it, <br/>
I&#39;ve been known to disprove the lie right to the lie-spreader&#39;s face. <br/>
 Always giving them a way out (because I&#39;ve never met anyone who spreads <br/>
lies over and over again out of vindictiveness).  <br/>
<br/>
I told my son that I&#39;d believe anything he says (he of the vivid <br/>
imagination), right up until he asks me to act on that belief...and then <br/>
I might need proof.  Same thing with grownups...if I believe and then <br/>
form an opinion on someone (the act on the belief) based on what you <br/>
say, it damn well better be the truth.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-324207046">&lt;&lt; Discussing who married<br/>
who and who dates who and who just did what and who is<br/>
ill or better or who has a birthday coming up is how<br/>
we find out.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I believe the word &quot;gossip&quot; was  created by men who wanted to keep women more <br/>
isolated.<br/>
<br/>
Before cheap printing, TV and the internet, the way women learned about <br/>
cooking, quilting, childbearing, canning, etc., was hearing other women&#39;s <br/>
stories.  The way they learn social realities (what to worry about and warn <br/>
their daughters about) is hearing what happened to other people regarding <br/>
infidelity, divorce, violence, drinking, and all else of a nature to affect <br/>
the families.<br/>
<br/>
But when women were separated and alone, the men had more control over what <br/>
the wives knew.  So men condemned gossip, and said gossips were lazy and <br/>
should be home doing laundry or ironing underwear.  <br/>
<br/>
What about doing laundry together?  No, that leads to gossip. <br/>
<br/>
&quot;The nuclear family&quot; and the isolation of pioneer life are legacies in much <br/>
of the U.S. which is interesting now that the internet can bring everyone <br/>
into the same laundryroom, as it were.<br/>
<br/>
There is malice and there is information exchange.  If someone gets divorced, <br/>
I can use knowing not to invite them both over together, not to send them a <br/>
Christmas card together and so forth.  It&#39;s social necessity.  There are <br/>
parts I do NOT need to know.  And finding ways to make one or the other of <br/>
them more unhappy is just hateful.  But failing to discuss it at all on the <br/>
grounds that it&#39;s gossip keeps much of culture from smoothly continuing.<br/>
<br/>
Some things need to be discussed so that the person doesn&#39;t have to repeat it <br/>
over and over for every person she meets:  miscarriage, childbirth, marriage, <br/>
divorce, death of a family member.   Those should be spread as the important <br/>
information they are.  And the details are more or less needed by some, and <br/>
not needed by others.<br/>
<br/>
One thing we can&#39;t prescribe or enforce is common sense.  Making rules like <br/>
&quot;no gossip&quot; doesn&#39;t allow common sense the freedom it needs to operate.<br/>
<br/>
Those with more social skills and social awareness will make others&#39; lives <br/>
better, and those with little to none will make people&#39;s lives worse.  That&#39;s <br/>
the way it has always been and will always be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1293052291"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; . Gossip is never really a private matter, that&#39;s basically why it&#39;s such <br/>
 </span></blockquote>a <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &gt; negative behavior. Those being gossiped about are eventually negatively <br/>

&gt;  I have some issues happening on this topic right now and would like to <br/>
 </span></blockquote>hear <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  what others think.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Let me preface this by saying that I&#39;m one of those people who started out <br/>
truly dense about interpersonal relations. I&#39;m still learning. I&#39;m terribly <br/>
thick-skinned, and have a tendency to assume the same of others. I&#39;m also a <br/>
very straight-up communicator, and really had no clue that some people in the <br/>
world have hidden agendas. I was and am particularly naive and susceptible to <br/>
manipulation when it comes to rooting for underdogs. I&#39;m also really bad at <br/>
asking for help or appearing weak. Most of what I know about relating to <br/>
people in a healthy way has been learned pretty late in life. What I&#39;m saying <br/>
is that I&#39;m no expert, but here are some things I&#39;ve learned.<br/>
<br/>
A very wise woman once said to me regarding gossip that the problem with <br/>
gossip is not that people gossip too much, but that they don&#39;t do enough of <br/>
the right sort of gossiping.<br/>
<br/>
Hurtful, slanderous gossip exchanged with the voice of the rather arch lady <br/>
elephant in Dumbo and with sly winks is right out. Pretty much, if I find <br/>
that I can transfer what I&#39;m thinking about or hearing from someone with that <br/>
sort of a voice, I really don&#39;t need to say it. Obviously, that&#39;s <br/>
oversimplified (and if you haven&#39;t seen Dumbo, I guess it&#39;s also hard to <br/>
relate to).<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, the right sort of gossip can bring a group together and be <br/>
supportive of a person. Suppose that someone in your group just suddenly <br/>
stopped showing up to gatherings. You have no idea what&#39;s up. You call her <br/>
house, no answer. You go over, no one&#39;s home. The neighbour comes out and <br/>
says, &quot;Oh, Jenny had to fly to Texas suddenly because her mom had a stroke.&quot; <br/>
That&#39;s certainly gossip (&quot;rumour or talk of a personal, intimate or <br/>
sensational nature&quot;), however, I would maintain that it&#39;s the sort of gossip <br/>
that is beneficial. It allows the rest of us to prepare to lend a hand when <br/>
we can. Similar to this is spreading of good news (&quot;David passed his Ph.D. <br/>
defense!&quot; &quot;Shannon had a baby girl!&quot;) -- this is also by definition gossip, <br/>
but is a courtesy to the hearer as well -- perhaps they weren&#39;t aware, and <br/>
now gives them the opportunity to offer well wishes to the new Dr. or mom.<br/>
<br/>
I find it interesting that &quot;gossip&quot; (when applied to people) not only <br/>
referred to someone who habitually spread gossip, but it could also mean &quot;a <br/>
close friend&quot; in days gone by. Also interesting to me that gossip is rarely <br/>
applied to men.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If a friend comes to me and wants to talk about issues she has with someone <br/>
&gt; else - isn&#39;t it gossip and should I not tell her to keep it to herself, <br/>
 </span></blockquote>that <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t want to hear it? Or is it a friend venting her frustrations and <br/>
&gt; negative feelings to me, a person she trusts? Or, should I listen and then <br/>
&gt; report what she said to the person she&#39;s talking about because it is only <br/>
&gt; fair that they ought to know what&#39;s being said about them?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me, truth has to do with what makes useful talk. If someone wants to blow <br/>
hot air and lies around, I usually find that I&#39;m needed elsewhere, just after <br/>
asking the person if s/he has spoken to the one they are talking about. If <br/>
its just beefing due to putting up with grating personalities, I&#39;ll listen <br/>
and do the tongue-cluck until they&#39;ve calmed down enough to &quot;rejoin polite <br/>
society&quot; (as my mom would put it); no real input needed from me. If it&#39;s an <br/>
honest problem, then I listen sympathetically and offer advice. If it&#39;s an <br/>
honest problem that the other person is not aware they are causing, I <br/>
certainly will talk to the person about approaching that other person and <br/>
bringing it to light. Sometimes our best helpers are the ones who aren&#39;t <br/>
afraid to tell us our zippers are down and we have spinach in our teeth.<br/>
<br/>
I have also learned that some people need intermediaries (another lesson from <br/>
that same wise woman, learned when I was venting to HER about how much some <br/>
people kept venting to ME...) to approach other people for them, and are not <br/>
often good about asking in plain English for help. It may come veiled as <br/>
gossip or venting. I have no problem running interference for myself, but not <br/>
everyone is as thick-skinned. So when someone comes venting, I now am savvy <br/>
enough to ask, &quot;Do you want me to talk to him about it?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I have also learned the importance of gathering enough information on a topic <br/>
to determine whether it is truth or balderdash. Some completely true things <br/>
masquerade as absurd simply because we have had limited exposure to them. <br/>
<br/>
Naturally, just because something is true does not mean it should be spread <br/>
around if the person doesn&#39;t wish it. But sometimes people do it because they <br/>
need support dealing with it. When I was going to have a biopsy to check for <br/>
lymphoma, I really didn&#39;t want people knowing about it (see above, under <br/>
&quot;weakness&quot;), but my husband really needed to talk to someone about it so he <br/>
could process it. Difference in family culture: my family were stoic silent <br/>
types, his were talkers. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;ve learned so much about dealing with other humans from this wise <br/>
woman, and I continue to do so on a daily basis now that I&#39;m on this list -- <br/>
thanks, Sandra!! (Any misrepresentations of her words are failings on my <br/>
part, not mistakes of hers!)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sandra (sorry - speaking for you Sandra) said once that if she and Keith were <br/>
to divorce, she&#39;d really want us all to gossip about it so that SHE wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have to be the one to tell everybody. Makes sense to me -- when my bil died, <br/>
it was clearly of benefit to my sister for the information to spread quickly <br/>
and widely so that she would face having to tell people as few times as <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
So, okay, that kind of &quot;gossip&quot; I understand - I&#39;d count it under <br/>
&quot;information that is useful for people to have - clearly serving a useful <br/>
purpose.&quot; So I&#39;m crossing that off my list of what I consider gossip &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
What about the &quot;just venting&quot; kind? Example: A group of friends sitting <br/>
around and one walks away and one of the others says, &quot;She is just driving me <br/>
crazy today with going on and on about blah blah blah...&quot;.  Not particularly <br/>
nice to say it, I guess, but I wonder if there isn&#39;t a purpose to it - <br/>
everybody else learning from it that going on like that is annoying to this <br/>
person, for example. Maybe someone else says, &quot;Well, she needs somebody to <br/>
talk to about this blah, blah, blah so that&#39;s why she&#39;s going on like that.&quot; <br/>
And so on.... further analysis. Is this sort of a case of women together <br/>
developing their interpersonal intelligence? And, should one of these women <br/>
then TELL the person that, when she got up, someone else complained about <br/>
her? Why or why not?<br/>
<br/>
(I&#39;ve made up this scenario - it isn&#39;t something that has happened or <br/>
anything - but it seems likely enough - probably has happened when I have <br/>
walked away from a group, I just betcha &lt;BEG&gt;. It is close enough to <br/>
something that has recently happened that it would be really interesting to <br/>
hear people&#39;s ideas on it.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>For several years we at Home Education Magazine have been following <br/>
the ongoing case of the Bryant family of Waltham, Massachusetts.  In <br/>
1997, when the Waltham city school officials requested that the <br/>
Bryant&#39;s two children, then ages seven and nine, be tested and that <br/>
the family provide the district with progress reports, the Bryants <br/>
refused, saying that the state does not have the authority to monitor <br/>
or control the education of their children.<br/>
<br/>
On December 14, 2001, an article in the Waltham, MA News-Tribune <br/>
described the latest development in this case: &quot;The two children of <br/>
George and Kim Bryant have been placed in the custody of the <br/>
Department of Social Services because their parents refuse to submit <br/>
a home-schooling lesson plan to the Waltham School Department.&quot; Here <br/>
is a link to the article:<br/>

<br/>
On Saturday, December 15 the story was picked up by the larger Boston Herald:<br/>

&quot;Kim and George Bryant have argued it is their right to home school <br/>
the children without filing reports or testing results with the city <br/>
school department because, in their opinion, there&#39;s no such <br/>
requirement in the U.S. Constitution.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This case involves several issues of importance, primarily how the <br/>
interests of the state conflict with the interests of the individual <br/>
family. For an excellent overview, links to articles and commentary, <br/>

&gt; homeschooling, or am I just gossiping?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Here&#39;s what I posted to the Unschooling list:<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
Though I&#39;m from Mass I haven&#39;t been following this case on the state HSing<br/>
group&#39;s list because of the legalistic nitpicking. (It makes me realize why<br/>
people get fed up with unschooling nitpicking ;-)<br/>
<br/>
It seemed shockingly uncaring to me that MA homeschoolers weren&#39;t supporting<br/>
the Bryants but apparently their case is based around their contention that<br/>
the compulsory attendance law goes against state constitutionally guaranteed<br/>
parental rights so the law itself is unconstitutional. There&#39;s a hugely<br/>
steep learning curve involved in figuring out what in the world anyone is<br/>
talking about in order to try to decide if such a law can be (legally)<br/>
unconstitutional and if so whether it is and whether that really has<br/>
anything to do with the legalities of homeschooling in MA. Basically the<br/>
rallying cry is too muddled to get everyone to answer the call.<br/>
<br/>
(The Bryants stance is they don&#39;t have to submit an education plan to be<br/>
approved by the Superintendent since the compulsory attendance law is<br/>
unconstitutional. One of the problems that prevents people from rallying<br/>
around the case is that the education plan is not a much of a hoop to jump<br/>
through (I use Carol Narigon&#39;s which I can pass on if anyone&#39;s interested)<br/>
and the case law is very clear that the state can&#39;t dictate the manner of<br/>
education so unschooling is very easy in MA.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s been a good summary of the two Mass homeschooling points of view on<br/>
the case and why the Bryants aren&#39;t being backed universally by<br/>
homeschoolers in MA on the MHLA email list. (The second list has had many<br/>
ongoing discussions about it and others.)<br/>
<br/>
masshomelearningassoc at Yahoo Groups (supposedly the MHLA list for<br/>
nonpolitical homeschooling discussions but a good summary)<br/>
MAhomeschoolers at Yahoo Groups (the MHLA list for political talk)<br/>
<br/>
Whether the Bryants have helped the homeschooling atmosphere in Mass as they<br/>
claim, or hindered as MHLA claims, apparently no real changes can happen if<br/>
the foundation of the changes keeps coming back to the argument of whether<br/>
to work with what is there (compulsory attendance laws and others) or<br/>
whether that&#39;s ridiculous because the laws are unconstitutional. :-/<br/>
<br/>
The scary/sad part is the DSS involvement in what is by-the-legal-book<br/>
educational neglect and therefore child neglect, but which doesn&#39;t match<br/>
reality since the kids are clearly being well educated. (They probably know<br/>
a lot more about law than a lot of lawyers!)<br/>
<br/>
---<br/>
<br/>
I also clarified that MA doesn&#39;t have homeschooling laws, per se. Being<br/>
&quot;otherwise educated&quot; is mentioned in the compulsory attendance law. The<br/>
rules and regulations on homeschooling are based on a case, The Care and<br/>
Protection of Charles, that, sometimes ambiguously, states what is required<br/>
of homeschoolers -- an education plan and the superintendent *can* ask for<br/>
some form of assessment but the parents need to agree on the form -- and the<br/>
scope of the superintendent&#39;s involvement.<br/>
<br/>
No one wants to overturn Charles because if it&#39;s interpretted &quot;properly&quot; ;-)<br/>
it makes homeschooling easy. The state group is working on a set of<br/>
guidelines for superintendents (with the state I believe) to make<br/>
interpretation more uniform throughout the state.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a minor clafification -- since the whole aspect of DSS being involved<br/>
in this is just too crazy making -- just so people have the proper image of<br/>
the family&#39;s situation in their heads but the Bryants currently have<br/>
physical custody of their 2 children (who are 12 and 13). DSS supposedly<br/>
needs to approve of various decisions (biggies like education, where they<br/>
live, medical care, marriage, and so on -- the Bryants may not move the<br/>
children out of state until they&#39;re 16). They are still homeschooling and<br/>
have submitted an education plan since they have a court order to do so.<br/>
(Their objection was that the ed plan requirement was illegal because the<br/>
compulsory attendance law went against the state constitution. But they will<br/>
comply with a court order.)<br/>
<br/>
Of course DSS could decide to take physical custody at any time.<br/>
<br/>
And now that I read through it again, things still aren&#39;t perfectly clear.<br/>
One of the Bryants arguements is that the Supreme Judicial Court can&#39;t make<br/>
laws according to the state constitutuion. (The Charles case is refered to<br/>
as case law.) So nothing that&#39;s said in Charles applies. Others say Charles<br/>
isn&#39;t law but clarification of existing law.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that part just makes the head spin which is why the case generates<br/>
more of a sigh of irritation in most MA homeschoolers than a stance for or<br/>
against.<br/>

what&#39;s *apparently* allowed by the case law. (Nothing unique in that to MA,<br/>
of course!) And it&#39;s that &quot;apparently&quot; that can cause some abuses so not<br/>
everyone is happy. But they&#39;re unhappy because of the wide ranges of<br/>
interpretations (and because some homeschoolers prefer to go along with what<br/>
they&#39;re told to do, which, considering the daunting task of figuring this<br/>
stuff out alone if you&#39;re not internet savvy, perhaps isn&#39;t unreasonable)<br/>
not because of the case law. A much simpler solution than this pretty<br/>
convoluted court case is to write up a clarification.<br/>

experienced this situation before! I&#39;ve just been cringing every time I see<br/>
the case mentioned, knowing that it looks way different from the outside<br/>
than from the inside. It sure looks like a massive abuse that needs fixed.<br/>

This is where the line gets muddy for me, though. I think that a certain amount of &quot;analyzing&quot; and speculating and figuring out the &quot;whys&quot; and &quot;wherefores&quot; --- is what women DO to help them understand how relationships work and how they fall apart and so on. And I think it is important work.<br/>

It sounds like you think that women talking together, trying to figure out together what went wrong or whatever, that that is the equivalent of spreading nasty lies about someone. I don&#39;t necessarily agree that that is what it always is and it is when it is NOT that, that I&#39;m talking about. I don&#39;t think it is so all black and white -- and I think we women live in the gray area. The point is that we NEED to talk to each other - about other people - we need to learn from each other - from other people&#39;s mistakes and successes. Suppose we knew someone whose kid seemed to be a mess - doing lots of drugs, sexually promiscuous, lying, stealing, whatever, ... I think it would be reasonable for the two of us, assuming we&#39;re good friends, to talk about what we thought went wrong. Was it parenting? What kind? Some traumatic event? Do we think it is a phase? Etc. WE, also being parents, can learn a lot by these kinds of conversations with each other about what we observe happening in other people&#39;s lives.<br/>
<br/>
This is different than spreading vicious rumors. I&#39;m not talking about going up to people and saying, &quot;Hey, did you HEEEEAR what so-and-so&#39;s kid did?&quot; There seems a difference to me in spreading bad stuff just for the titillation value versus serious discussions among good friends.<br/>
<br/>
But, maybe that&#39;s too fine a line to draw. Maybe we humans aren&#39;t capable of that distinction?<br/>

Just as some people are tone deaf or math-slow, some aren&#39;t really attuned to <br/>
interpersonals, don&#39;t read other people readily, don&#39;t get ideas popping in <br/>
their heads about what other people&#39;s situations might need for improvement.  <br/>
Some people don&#39;t like ANY music, or ANY math, or ANY interpersonals because <br/>
they don&#39;t personally like or get it.  But some people are not mean AND <br/>
they&#39;re good with interpersonal relationships.  For them, knowing the details <br/>
of someone else&#39;s marital problems (especially when it&#39;s coming from the <br/>
principals, but sometimes their two points of view AND the speculation and <br/>
suggestion of their closest friends and witnesses) can lead to some <br/>
suggestions that keep a couple together.<br/>
<br/>
If I hadn&#39;t seen it happen, I wouldn&#39;t have that opinion.<br/>
<br/>
Even Kirby was a truly useful marriage counselor to some of his 20+ friends, <br/>
at 14.<br/>
<br/>
Partly it has to do with hearing what people are saying and knowing what <br/>
they&#39;re not saying, and what they&#39;re avoiding saying.  Sometimes it&#39;s the <br/>
very thing that some people on the internet squeal about:  &quot;You&#39;re not taking <br/>
