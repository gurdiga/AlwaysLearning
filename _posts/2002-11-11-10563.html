<div id="ygrps-yiv-434213909">Rescue Remedy is very calming, you can buy it at health food stores.<br/>
I would think there is something contributing to this, things she&#39;s seen on <br/>
tv, or perhaps movies she&#39;s watching that she thought she could handle, but <br/>
isn&#39;t able to.<br/>
I would personally seek out a homeopathic physician to try and come up with a <br/>
&quot;constitutional&quot; remedy. Instead of treating a problem, they are treating the <br/>
whole person.  I&#39;ve had very good responses to homeopathics for issues like <br/>
that.<br/>

Obsessive Compulsive?<br/>
Some of what you&#39;ve described sounds very much like that. I would want a <br/>
diagnoses myself, not to label the child but to understand and find ways to <br/>
support her better.<br/>
I really am no expert, but that was my thought when you started describing <br/>
more of her struggles.<br/>

Do I go to our paediatrician, get an opinion then get a referral to a <br/>
psychologist or do I go straight to the psychologist?<br/>
<br/>
I trained as a clinical psychologist myself and if we had a child with <br/>
those symptons we would see the whole family as they were <br/>
bound to be coercive and overcontrolling. We had our theories and <br/>
we stuck to them.<br/>
Now I&#39;m more open minded and I&#39;m also aware that I&#39;m not over <br/>
controlling. Maybe I&#39;m too much the other way?<br/>
Argh.<br/>

If it were me, I&#39;d start with a naturopath or homeopath and see if their <br/>
ideas worked.<br/>
Then I&#39;d go to a ped, and see what they suggested. Keeping in mind that I <br/>
could reject anything they say (of course!).<br/>
Start with the least invasive and work your way up, that&#39;s what I&#39;d do.<br/>
Or maybe just read up on obsessive/compulsive disorder, see if she fits a lot <br/>
of it, find out how to best support her and be on your way.<br/>
You be the expert. &#39;Course I figured that&#39;s what a radical Brit would do <br/>
anyway.......:)<br/>

&lt;&lt; I&#39;d like to find a homeopath too. What qualifications should I look at <br/>
 when looking for one? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s gonna be tough where you live Shyrley. If you get up to the Portland, OR <br/>
area there are some really GREAT ones. I&#39;ll give you recommendations if you <br/>
think that&#39;s a possibility. The naturopath we went to that did testing was <br/>
incredible. Nailed every substance right and had us healthy again in no time.<br/>

<br/>
I see your point.  When a child is &quot;weird&quot; and it isn&#39;t an obvious<br/>
diagnosis, it&#39;s pretty convenient for the medical establishment to blame<br/>
the parent.<br/>
