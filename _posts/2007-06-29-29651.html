<div id="ygrps-yiv-2087115286">This is from a MySpace profile, one I&#39;ve declined to accept as a  <br/>
friend.  She&#39;s probably nice.  She&#39;s in the SE United States, and is  <br/>
in her young 20&#39;s.  I have no reason to think she didn&#39;t go to school.<br/>
<br/>
I married osmoene who didn&#39;t spell well (a little better than that  <br/>
below, when I met him, and WAY better years-of-writing later), and my  <br/>
kids have all misspelled words in the past week (as have I, and I  <br/>
used a whole wrong word where I can&#39;t change it).    So this isn&#39;t an  <br/>
attack on this individual at all.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what this is:<br/>
If you worry that your kids won&#39;t learn anything without school,  <br/>
remember that some people DO go to school, for 12 or 13 years, and  <br/>
still haven&#39;t become those ideally educated people that exist in our  <br/>
imaginations.   Those who spell well at the age of 20 probably  <br/>
already spelled pretty well when they were twelve or thirteen.  And  <br/>
those who are musicians were probably already singing when they were  <br/>
toddlers, and so forth.  Very much of what people learn they learn  <br/>
outside of and away from school.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Had I been over 18 (which I am) and wanted to see nude modelling  <br/>
photos of the writer (which I don&#39;t), I could&#39;ve become her friend  <br/>
and gone to her other site.  I opted not to.  But I did lift her  <br/>
spelling to make some of the people here feel better about the idea  <br/>
that if unschoolers aren&#39;t perfect, maybe school would have perfected  <br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
