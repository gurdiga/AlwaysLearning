<br/>
I would love to hear more about how you&#39;ve cultivated this <br/>
relationship.  Has it always been this way, or did you have rough <br/>
patches?<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is only 10, but he&#39;s very independent and strong willed.  <br/>
Good traits, yes, but I tend to be a worrier and have a hard time <br/>
finding the balance between accepting his desire to be on his own <br/>
and make his own decisions (like ride his bike everywhere, including <br/>
high traffic areas, without a helmet for example) and my very strong <br/>
need to protect him.  It sometimes feels like protecting our <br/>
relationship is in direct conflict with protecting *him*. <br/>
<br/>
Another example... there was a party at the beach near us the other <br/>
day that went on past dark... a very big party with bonfires etc.  <br/>
The ocean was quite rough due to the aftermath of the hurricane, and <br/>
he was swimming and riding the waves while I was there during the <br/>
day to pay close attention in case he needed help.  I needed to <br/>
leave after dark because my 4yo was tired and cranky and 10yo wanted <br/>
to stay with friends.  That was fine with me, but one stipulation <br/>
was that I didn&#39;t want him to go back in the water again... the <br/>
combination of rough surf, no lifeguards, after dark, and the fact <br/>
that the only other adults he&#39;d be in the presence of had been <br/>
drinking and were socializing and not paying attention was too much <br/>
for me.  This resulted in a very tense argument between the two of <br/>
us, and I&#39;m alarmed that these clashes are happening more frequently <br/>
as he gets older.  The *most* alarming thing to me is his seeming <br/>
belief in his own invincibility.<br/>
What&#39;s a mother to do in these situations?<br/>
<br/>
Patti<br/>
<br/>
&lt;<br/>
 <br/>
I can certainly relate to the terror of having an &quot;invincible&quot; child.  I wasn&#39;t always so trusting.  A couple years ago, I couldn&#39;t tolerate the suffering in my relationship with the kids and found a teacher to help me move from a stance of fear to love.  I used to think that I loved the kids, and what I actually was was afraid that something terrible would happen to them and I wouldn&#39;t be able to handle it.  I was living in survival/adrenalin mode - exactly the opposite of the environment I wanted to create for my kids or myself. Now I know the difference between love and fear.  <br/>
 <br/>
I still get afraid sometimes.  I stop and just feel it before doing anything about it.  I tell them directly &quot;I&#39;m afraid&quot; and why.  That is so honest and open that they listen and respond.  Whereas, if I just try to make them do what I want I become a force which, by natural law, creates it&#39;s own counterforce.<br/>
 <br/>
By paying attention to my gut feelings, not my mind racing, I model for them how to pay attention to their real feelings that do sense danger, rather than all the thinking about what might go wrong.  It&#39;s important to feel safe in the world and use that quiet inner guidance system.<br/>
 <br/>
I just became certified to teach the parenting class, The Gift of Being Welcomed.  I&#39;m hoping to start teaching a class in a few weeks.  We do have a yahoo group where we discuss the welcoming response.  You&#39;re welcome to join us. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1788751725">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
This sounds like my dd at that age (she&#39;s almost 6 now)! She went through<br/>
some really obsessive periods with writing. I think she learned most of her<br/>
letters around 2.5/3 and would write them on long strips of paper. For my<br/>
dd -- it was &quot;art&quot;. She&#39;s always been into drawing, crafts, etc... and I<br/>
remain convinced that learning to write has been an extension of her love of<br/>
all things art. For her, it wasn&#39;t important that her writing made no sense<br/>
to adults. When she asked me to read it, I sounded her writing out as best I<br/>
could. When she wanted to know what it meant -- I would be honest and tell<br/>
her I didn&#39;t know. I remember telling her that maybe her word/words meant<br/>
something in another language -- she liked that! Oh - the other really cute<br/>
thing I remember is that she would sit at her computer - which is directly<br/>
behind mine - and would type &quot;emails&quot; to me on her word processing program.<br/>
Again, strings of letters -- I couldn&#39;t make heads or tails out of it -- but<br/>
she understood it and was very proud of herself.<br/>
<br/>
She learned to read really simple stuff between 3-4 and her writing started<br/>
to indicate the words she could read - like cat, dog, mom, dad, and some of<br/>
her friends names. She also got into copying words from kid dictionaries at<br/>
that age. Now she&#39;s into writing &quot;chinese&quot; with a feather and ink -- looks<br/>
very cool!<br/>
<br/>
Hurray for letting kids do what they please...be it writing, legos, knex,<br/>
slopping in the mud, barbies....whatever! &quot;One thing leads to another&quot;.....<br/>
<br/>
Aileen<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Our three year old daughter loves to write. She makes lists and crosses<br/>
things off. Asks us to spell things and writes t410hem down. Write us<br/>
letters. Interviews us and writes down the answer. All of it perfectly<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Does it matter? I don&#39;t mean that snarkily but she is what she is and is<br/>
where she is and focusing on what might have been doesn&#39;t help her grow. IT<br/>
only compares her to some possiblity she can&#39;t ever be.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I learned to read early before 1st grade and then went onto<br/>
school.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter Kat at 12 has been able to read for a few years but only started<br/>
reading novels recently.<br/>
<br/>
If a child has all the brain and physical development needed to read early<br/>
then she&#39;ll read early as long as there is enough in the environment for her<br/>
to figure reading out. (Some will need more of being read to and<br/>
interaction, some will need less.)<br/>
<br/>
Is an early reader at a greater advantage than someone who doesn&#39;t learn to<br/>
read until 11? Society leads us to think so! But there really isn&#39;t any<br/>
advantage. Early readers are just absorbing stuff by reading and non-readers<br/>
are absorbing just as much through other means. If she&#39;d had the atmosphere<br/>
she needed earlier she just be an earlier reader, not up several &quot;levels&quot; in<br/>
knowledge about the world from where she is.<br/>
<br/>
Where unschooling is most nurturing is for kids who will read later than the<br/>
schools expect them to. They get to learn to read free from pressure and<br/>
negative atmosphere that makes them feel like there&#39;s something wrong with<br/>
them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-254866508">I should have posted an intro, but that will be below :)  I had to<br/>
respond to Heather&#39;s question.  She wrote:<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Is it common for unschooled children to read and write at such a <br/>
yound age?  Chelsea is my oldest... 4yrs. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My younger son taught himself to read sometime before he turned 4.  I<br/>
found out one evening when I gave him a new Dr Seuss book to look at<br/>
while I was fixing supper.  He&#39;d never seen the book before, but<br/>
proceeded to read it to me quite fluently, only having trouble with all<br/>
the words that started with &quot;the&quot;.  I had never made any point of<br/>
teaching the kids to read--at the time I thought that was school&#39;s job<br/>
&lt;sigh&gt;.  I simply read to them.  The Hobbit, The Wind in the Willows,<br/>
anything that would hold my attention and theirs.  Dad was the one<br/>
willing to read the little golden books over and over every night--maybe<br/>
because they were short :)<br/>
<br/>
He then went on to assist his older brother (just turned 5 at the time)<br/>
to learn to read--Jon (younger) would sit by Chris and read to him,<br/>
answer his questions.  Chris was unfortunately in kindergarten at the<br/>
time (took them both out when he was in 5th grade).  I don&#39;t remember a<br/>
particular moment in which he was suddenly reading, but it came to pass<br/>
over that summer.<br/>
<br/>
I was a little more active in my daughter&#39;s learning to read--which<br/>
means I continued reading to her, but also played more word games (a<br/>
favorite, still, is to come up with all the words we can think of which<br/>
rhyme), made written lists of really simple words that rhyme when she<br/>
seemed to be interested, and got a workbook (Dr Seuss again, and<br/>
superbly designed) as much because we were moving and facing long car<br/>
trips (2 cars, so I had to drive the whole trip).  I can&#39;t pinpoint the<br/>
time she read, but by her 6th birthday she was reading Laura Ingalls<br/>
Wilder with little help.<br/>
<br/>
Brief intro:  The older 2 are now grown and gone.  Chris, 24, is in the<br/>
TX National Guard.  He joined the Army at 17, just as his dad was<br/>
retiring after 22 years&#39; service.  He&#39;s now preparing for his second<br/>
deployment to Bosnia--I wish he weren&#39;t going, but it&#39;s a heck of a lot<br/>
better than the Middle East!<br/>
<br/>
Jon, 22, is working in TN now, living with his future in-laws until he<br/>
and his fiance get married next year and find a place to live.  I&#39;m not<br/>
sure what he&#39;s doing at the moment.  His last job was doing market<br/>
analysis for a real estate publishing company.<br/>
<br/>
Bethany turned 12 yesterday.  At the moment she&#39;s into Harry Potter (me<br/>
too :), Lord of the Rings (ditto--and we love to critique the movie and<br/>
try to figure out why the stories and characters were so changed),<br/>
reading/writing Chinese (she did Morse code a few years ago--I think<br/>
Chinese writing is sort of an extension of that for her), astronomy,<br/>
making up the languages for and details of an imaginary world, riding<br/>
her bike, studying, growing, and harvesting herbs, tea, sewing her own<br/>
clothes without patterns, and generally being as different from me as<br/>
she can be :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1775946607">I think that reading is one of the things we all learn on our own schedules, and I don&#39;t know how much it can be dampened by circumstances if that&#39;s what you&#39;re asking.  <br/>
 <br/>
With compulsory schooling and the whole concept of &#39;reading at grade level&#39; being so important in recent years, I really think it&#39;s impossible to recognize the individuality of reading progression.  Kids are force-taught to sound out words and read boring stuff like &quot;jack & jill and their dog bill&quot;  (really a title my neighbor&#39;s 2nd grader is reading).  I mean, who wants to read that?  My brother and I used to think it great fun to just choose a World Book letter at random and read about all sorts of stuff.  My sister really took off when she read her first Heinlein book.<br/>
 <br/>
My oldest was forced to read at 6 in school, but really didn&#39;t do it for pleasure until he was 12 or so, starting with the Goosebumps stories, then he discovered Lord of the Flies, which he&#39;s read so many times his copy is tattered.  <br/>
 <br/>
For your neice, it may or may not be happening now -- maybe she&#39;s just curious about letters, or sounds and really enjoys being read to, but isn&#39;t ready to read herself.  What I&#39;m saying, is don&#39;t attach too much expectation to it.  I found with my oldest that he resisted learning to read himself -- or to letting others know he could read -- because he worried that once we know he could read, we&#39;d stop reading to him, leaving him alone with books when he really craved the one-on-one time of being read to.  <br/>

My brother and I both started reading before age 4 but my sister and youngest brother didn&#39;t read until 5 or 6. Their enviroment was different as my mom was now parenting 4 kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1322773316">This sounds like my dd at that age (she&#39;s almost 6 now)! She went through<br/>
  some really obsessive periods with writing. I think she learned most of her<br/>
  letters around 2.5/3 and would write them on long strips of paper. For my<br/>
  dd -- it was &quot;art&quot;. She&#39;s always been into drawing, crafts, etc... and I<br/>
  remain convinced that learning to write has been an extension of her love of<br/>
  all things art. <br/>
<br/>
  Aileen<br/>
<br/>
  I have never thought to make that connection before. My daughter (4) loves art and she also loves to write. She will fill books with her scribbles. We often write to each other and I will read my letters/stories to her and she will do the same for me. Lately she has taken to copying words. Yesterday she copied Wizard of Oz from a colouring-in sheet. It&#39;s fascinating to watch.<br/>

  Mia has gone through reams of paper with all her scribbling. I used to groan (inwardly) but now I think if she learns to read and write without expensive phonics programs and the like then what does it matter if we go through a couple of hundred dollars in paper over the next few years.  So I just think of it as a self-styled  reading/handwriting program which makes it good value.<br/>

When my kids were little they would make words with the magnets on the <br/>
fridge, or in their own writing, and say &quot;Read this, mom!&quot; and I would pronounce it <br/>
phonetically.  If I couldn&#39;t pronounce it I would say &quot;It needs more vowels!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What are vowels?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I would either say a, e, i, o, u,   (sometimes y, technically w)<br/>
<br/>
or I would sort the vowels into one place for them to choose from.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t make a big deal about it, but it was always fun, funny and brief, <br/>
and they learned how to make words that COULD be pronounced by mixing vowels in.<br/>
<br/>
And it helped them appreciate why buying a vowel on Wheel of Fortune would be <br/>
a really good idea.<br/>
<br/>
We have a computer hangman, too, and sometimes Holly, before she could read, <br/>
would want to play it with me.<br/>
<br/>
She would guess letters and I would tell her what the word might be, or what <br/>
other letters could be pronounced with that.  If there were already more than <br/>
half vowels, I&#39;d tell her not to guess any more vowels.  We talked about what <br/>
letters are most commonly used, and what letters are good in what positions, <br/>
or what might be next to &quot;n,&quot; etc.<br/>

Moly used to write sentence long words, gibberish I couldn&#39;t begin to <br/>
pronounce. I told her it looked like Welsh to me, and how neat it was that she could <br/>
write in Welsh. My MIL ever the naysayer, was always asking when Moly would <br/>
learn to write and spell properly. One day, Moly told her she could write and <br/>
took her journal to grandma to show her. She took one look at it and said; &quot;This <br/>
isn&#39;t writing!&quot; Moly told her grandma it was so, that it was Welsh. Moly knew <br/>
it wasn&#39;t Welsh, but she liked to pretend anyway, and she assumed that <br/>
grandma would play along too. She got this long lecture on lying and telling <br/>
stories, and I got one on not encouraging the kids in frivolous maters that would <br/>
surely hamper their education. Some days I really hate that woman. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327684464">ahhhhhhh  <br/>
<br/>
OK, So I just got offf the phone with my sister....  I am shaking I am so angy.  I am just wanting to vent and maybe have some input as to what I can say to her or any of my family members,, I know this is just the beginning....<br/>
 <br/>
Let me give you a brief background... I come from a family of 5 kids (happened in 7 years) I am the Third child... with two older siblings and two younger siblings... My two older sibling (sisters) have daughters within a year or so of my own daughter age 6.  They are the ones that are very into &quot;school&quot;  My two younger sibs don&#39;t have kids but only add to the opposing opinion....  My Dad doesn&#39;t say anything and my mom acts as though I have joined a cult that shaves heads and tortures Lord only knows....  Thankfully we live away from each other and we rarely talk about education.  A few times when the subject has come up, my mother FIRMLY mentions her feelings on homeschooling...  very much opposing.  She is freakishly passive aggresive about it... after the conversations I am always thinking... heyya wait... (It never seems worth going back to clarify)<br/>
 <br/>
I feel I am a fairly assertive person.  Since my husband I have been married (11 years) we have always done things differently than the rest of our families (sometimes it feels like the world!) .  When it came to parenting...  ..attachment parenting...  child led...whatever it was.. we were different from them....  It is just what *we* chose that worked for us... Overall...  We just like to hang out with our kids.. discover life... play.. learn together as a family and lead a *PEACEFUL* life....  From the very beginning we have always gotten the &quot;you shoulds&quot;... the &quot;you better&quot; and on and on... we decided after struggling a few years that we gave up caring about people &quot;shoulding all over us&quot;....  <br/>
 <br/>
So the first crop of babies are in the area of &quot;school age&quot;........  Arriving at another difference in perspective, parenting and ideals.....  Why don&#39;t they just leave us alone?!?!<br/>
 <br/>
I just said to my husband last night... you know ... it is just a matter of time before we are going to get blasted with &quot;questions&quot;  Because it is the fall ... my daughter would be in the first grade...  They really are wanting to &quot;talk&quot; about everything... I believe  it is so they can give us the&quot;answers&quot; and &quot;save our children&quot; after discussing their concerns.....<br/>
 <br/>
Today must have been my lucky day... I just got blasted....<br/>
 <br/>
I called my sister kim who lives 45 minutes away....  I was telling her about a warehouse that was selling these software programs for $1 - $4 bucks!  She went into this thing about how her daughter (now 2nd grade) has sooo much homework every night that she just can;t see having her do anything else academic....  I said... &quot;wow.. I don;t blame you!!... wow!  homework?&quot;... My sister then went on to say how awful it has been.. that she comes home and has to do these sheets on every subject.. &quot;  I interjected..(thinking I was being sympathetic) ..&quot;That is too bad... what an infringement on family time!&quot;... the light conversation turned,,,,,  My sister started talking rapidly.,... (The oh my gosh... I am saying something bad about my prized educational system.. hit her)  She went on to say  WELL... I was talking to SO MANY of my friends .... they feel it is SO IMPORTANT that they start NOW so that when they are in the 5th grade they are trained to do &quot;important&quot; homework.... She took a<br/>
 breath.. seeing that I was about to board a train that was going to end in derailment... ... I said.. &quot;oh man... you know what Kim, we just can&#39;t talk about this... I feel so very differently...  &quot;    Defensively she said &quot;Now wait a minute... All my friends think that was SUCH A BLESSING to have that because what are they going to do?.... Get dumped with homework in the 5th grade??&quot;... I repeated.. Kim.. We just have to agree not to talk about this.... I just can&#39;t go there.... Kim couldnt get passed that she was trying to &quot;explain&quot; to me that it is SO IMPORTANT to have these daily sheets completed to get prepared....  and really that I should listen to her because &quot;when my daughter gets into the 5th grade she is going tohave to do it too&quot;...... ...  what?  wait... She just wasn;t getting it... Is there some kind of law out there that every child in the &quot;fifth grade&quot; has to have homework?....  I kept thinking.. she knows we homeschool.... does she think that a teacher comes to our<br/>
 house and assigns us this????   I calmly said... (probably in a very shakey voice though) Kim... we need to talk about something else.... Kim replied very snotty and in her big sister (15 month older) voice... &quot;What... we can;t talk about my views on education?&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
(silent scream)<br/>
 <br/>
I continued... Kim.. It isn&#39;t about that... I just see things differently....  She just couldn;t get it... She asked... What do YOU do?  Getting stupidly caught in a what I thought as an easy answer I responded... well... we unschool.  We feel it is important for kids to run jump play, explore, discover and enjoy....  She urgently asked,,, WELL.. what DO you DO on a typical day?  She went on and said...  asked?....  I mean your daughter Obviously knows how to read...    I took a deep breath and said...  That is just it Kim... WHY is it so obvious that she should know how to read?  Our society deems intelligence based on reading and writing,,, we don&#39;t... whether she can read or not or any child for that matter.... I tried using the analogy of a child learning to walk... they get their on their own time....    I then said (knowing that I had already said too much in a no win situation) We don&#39;t learn A to Z we learn the letters as we live.. in the end we have a complete set.... She<br/>
 jumped in...  We did too.. we taught H first and then.. and then,,,,  She just couldn&#39;t get it.. Then she asked,. &quot;Well what do you do on a typical day??&quot;  I said every day is different..  She said.. Do you do math with her (asking in a total flabergasted tone)  I said, yes. we cook.....         &quot;You cook.&quot; she replied in a very bewildered condescending way.... I said... yeah, you should see how she has picked up on her fractions...  My two year old started crying in the background....  She asked... when do you teach her things...?  I wasn&#39;t responding because I was talking to my little guy... I could hear her chattering about something...  My son started crying more...  I picked him up... She then asked... in a very.. sweet calm way as if the title to me was going to be.... &quot;Honey,&quot;... then she asked..(firing them out)..  Do you ever get a break from your kids? Are you and your daughter ever apart from each other?  Do they get the opportunity to learn from other people other than<br/>
 you?....  I simply said.. when she wants art we go to an artist,, when we need science she goes to a scientist at a college... history in a museum... <br/>
 <br/>
really getting frustrated because I feel they get so much from everybody.. including us... but in their way.... I said... Kim... gotta go... before I could say anything else.. SHE said,, GOOD        BYE and hung up on me.<br/>
 <br/>
ahhhhhhhhhhhh   Do I come from a freakishly narrow minded family?  Has anyone ever encountered this?  I get the lovely opportunity to be with the older-sibling-hens that will have a field day over just this conversation.... I know I need to just let it go.. but yowsee.<br/>
 <br/>
Another really concerning area... Kims daughter that is in the second grade - just 4 months older than my daughter whom we say is in the 1st grade...  is CONSTANTLY grilling my daughter about everything.... She obviously gets things from her mother...  Her cousin asks... are you really homeschooled?  What is 2 plus 2?  She will brag about a field trip they went on or what they do at recess.....  I have HEARD it...  In the past I have said.. wow... sounds like fun...  we do crazy things like that too....  (What I really want to do is slam dunk her... I hate that in me!)  What in the heck do I say to my daughter???  I don;t want her to be nasty, but I don;t want her to feel walked on either???!!<br/>
 <br/>
HELP~!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-349758135">Oh man this sounds just like conversations with my extended relatives.<br/>
<br/>
What is so funny is how a few have come around.<br/>
<br/>
I was considered crazy cause I also did child led weaning, nursed in <br/>
public etc.  My cousin wasn&#39;t sucessful at breastfeeding her first but <br/>
she did her 2nd.  Now she is convinced breastfeeding is the way, when <br/>
she really was rather mean to me before.<br/>
<br/>
I was called crazy for homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Alison is now homeschooling. <br/>
<br/>
Personally I would talk about the weather and california politics and <br/>
avoid topics like homeschooling.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; OK, So I just got offf the phone with my sister....  I am shaking I am <br/>
&gt; so angy.  I am just wanting to vent and maybe have some input as to <br/>
&gt; what I can say to her or any of my family members,, I know this is <br/>
&gt; just the beginning....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me give you a brief background... I come from a family of 5 kids <br/>
&gt; (happened in 7 years) I am the Third child... with two older siblings <br/>
&gt; and two younger siblings... My two older sibling (sisters) have <br/>
&gt; daughters within a year or so of my own daughter age 6.  They are the <br/>
&gt; ones that are very into &quot;school&quot;  My two younger sibs don&#39;t have kids <br/>
&gt; but only add to the opposing opinion....  My Dad doesn&#39;t say anything <br/>
&gt; and my mom acts as though I have joined a cult that shaves heads and <br/>
&gt; tortures Lord only knows....  Thankfully we live away from each other <br/>
&gt; and we rarely talk about education.  A few times when the subject has <br/>
&gt; come up, my mother FIRMLY mentions her feelings on homeschooling...  <br/>
&gt; very much opposing.  She is freakishly passive aggresive about it... <br/>
&gt; after the conversations I am always thinking... heyya wait... (It <br/>
&gt; never seems worth going back to clarify)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I feel I am a fairly assertive person.  Since my husband I have been <br/>
&gt; married (11 years) we have always done things differently than the <br/>
&gt; rest of our families (sometimes it feels like the world!) .  When it <br/>
&gt; came to parenting...  ..attachment parenting...  child led...whatever <br/>
&gt; it was.. we were different from them....  It is just what *we* chose <br/>
&gt; that worked for us... Overall...  We just like to hang out with our <br/>
&gt; kids.. discover life... play.. learn together as a family and lead a <br/>
&gt; *PEACEFUL* life....  From the very beginning we have always gotten the <br/>
&gt; &quot;you shoulds&quot;... the &quot;you better&quot; and on and on... we decided after <br/>
&gt; struggling a few years that we gave up caring about people &quot;shoulding <br/>
&gt; all over us&quot;.... <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So the first crop of babies are in the area of &quot;school age&quot;........  <br/>
&gt; Arriving at another difference in perspective, parenting and <br/>
&gt; ideals.....  Why don&#39;t they just leave us alone?!?!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I just said to my husband last night... you know ... it is just a <br/>
&gt; matter of time before we are going to get blasted with &quot;questions&quot;  <br/>
&gt; Because it is the fall ... my daughter would be in the first grade...  <br/>
&gt; They really are wanting to &quot;talk&quot; about everything... I believe  it is <br/>
&gt; so they can give us the&quot;answers&quot; and &quot;save our children&quot; after <br/>
&gt; discussing their concerns.....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Today must have been my lucky day... I just got blasted....<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I called my sister kim who lives 45 minutes away....  I was telling <br/>
&gt; her about a warehouse that was selling these software programs for $1 <br/>
&gt; - $4 bucks!  She went into this thing about how her daughter (now 2nd <br/>
&gt; grade) has sooo much homework every night that she just can;t see <br/>
&gt; having her do anything else academic....  I said... &quot;wow.. I don;t <br/>
&gt; blame you!!... wow!  homework?&quot;... My sister then went on to say how <br/>
&gt; awful it has been.. that she comes home and has to do these sheets on <br/>
&gt; every subject.. &quot;  I interjected..(thinking I was being sympathetic) <br/>
&gt; ..&quot;That is too bad... what an infringement on family time!&quot;... the <br/>
&gt; light conversation turned,,,,,  My sister started talking rapidly.,... <br/>
&gt; (The oh my gosh... I am saying something bad about my prized <br/>
&gt; educational system.. hit her)  She went on to say  WELL... I was <br/>
&gt; talking to SO MANY of my friends .... they feel it is SO IMPORTANT <br/>
&gt; that they start NOW so that when they are in the 5th grade they are <br/>
&gt; trained to do &quot;important&quot; homework.... She took a<br/>
&gt; breath.. seeing that I was about to board a train that was going to <br/>
&gt; end in derailment... ... I said.. &quot;oh man... you know what Kim, we <br/>
&gt; just can&#39;t talk about this... I feel so very differently...  &quot;    <br/>
&gt; Defensively she said &quot;Now wait a minute... All my friends think that <br/>
&gt; was SUCH A BLESSING to have that because what are they going to <br/>
&gt; do?.... Get dumped with homework in the 5th grade??&quot;... I repeated.. <br/>
&gt; Kim.. We just have to agree not to talk about this.... I just can&#39;t go <br/>
&gt; there.... Kim couldnt get passed that she was trying to &quot;explain&quot; to <br/>
&gt; me that it is SO IMPORTANT to have these daily sheets completed to get <br/>
&gt; prepared....  and really that I should listen to her because &quot;when my <br/>
&gt; daughter gets into the 5th grade she is going tohave to do it <br/>
&gt; too&quot;...... ...  what?  wait... She just wasn;t getting it... Is there <br/>
&gt; some kind of law out there that every child in the &quot;fifth grade&quot; has <br/>
&gt; to have homework?....  I kept thinking.. she knows we homeschool.... <br/>
&gt; does she think that a teacher comes to our<br/>
&gt; house and assigns us this????   I calmly said... (probably in a very <br/>
&gt; shakey voice though) Kim... we need to talk about something else.... <br/>
&gt; Kim replied very snotty and in her big sister (15 month older) <br/>
&gt; voice... &quot;What... we can;t talk about my views on education?&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; (silent scream)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I continued... Kim.. It isn&#39;t about that... I just see things <br/>
&gt; differently....  She just couldn;t get it... She asked... What do YOU <br/>
&gt; do?  Getting stupidly caught in a what I thought as an easy answer I <br/>
&gt; responded... well... we unschool.  We feel it is important for kids to <br/>
&gt; run jump play, explore, discover and enjoy....  She urgently asked,,, <br/>
&gt; WELL.. what DO you DO on a typical day?  She went on and said...  <br/>
&gt; asked?....  I mean your daughter Obviously knows how to read...    I <br/>
&gt; took a deep breath and said...  That is just it Kim... WHY is it so <br/>
&gt; obvious that she should know how to read?  Our society deems <br/>
&gt; intelligence based on reading and writing,,, we don&#39;t... whether she <br/>
&gt; can read or not or any child for that matter.... I tried using the <br/>
&gt; analogy of a child learning to walk... they get their on their own <br/>
&gt; time....    I then said (knowing that I had already said too much in a <br/>
&gt; no win situation) We don&#39;t learn A to Z we learn the letters as we <br/>
&gt; live.. in the end we have a complete set.... She<br/>
&gt; jumped in...  We did too.. we taught H first and then.. and then,,,,  <br/>
&gt; She just couldn&#39;t get it.. Then she asked,. &quot;Well what do you do on a <br/>
&gt; typical day??&quot;  I said every day is different..  She said.. Do you do <br/>
&gt; math with her (asking in a total flabergasted tone)  I said, yes. we <br/>
&gt; cook.....         &quot;You cook.&quot; she replied in a very bewildered <br/>
&gt; condescending way.... I said... yeah, you should see how she has <br/>
&gt; picked up on her fractions...  My two year old started crying in the <br/>
&gt; background....  She asked... when do you teach her things...?  I <br/>
&gt; wasn&#39;t responding because I was talking to my little guy... I could <br/>
&gt; hear her chattering about something...  My son started crying more...  <br/>
&gt; I picked him up... She then asked... in a very.. sweet calm way as if <br/>
&gt; the title to me was going to be.... &quot;Honey,&quot;... then she <br/>
&gt; asked..(firing them out)..  Do you ever get a break from your kids? <br/>
&gt; Are you and your daughter ever apart from each other?  Do they get the <br/>
&gt; opportunity to learn from other people other than<br/>
&gt; you?....  I simply said.. when she wants art we go to an artist,, when <br/>
&gt; we need science she goes to a scientist at a college... history in a <br/>
&gt; museum...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; really getting frustrated because I feel they get so much from <br/>
&gt; everybody.. including us... but in their way.... I said... Kim... <br/>
&gt; gotta go... before I could say anything else.. SHE said,, GOOD        <br/>
&gt; BYE and hung up on me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; ahhhhhhhhhhhh   Do I come from a freakishly narrow minded family?  Has <br/>
&gt; anyone ever encountered this?  I get the lovely opportunity to be with <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514005268">Cynthia, you&#39;re not alone. :) My relatives generally know better than to go<br/>
after me, but from time to time one of them freaks. Usually it comes from<br/>
either defensiveness of their own choices (like I suspect your sister&#39;s<br/>
kitten-fit originated) or genuine concern for our children and our bizarre<br/>
philosophies. Lately my mother just complains about me to my sister and my<br/>
sister smiles and nods and ignores her. Works for me. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you stay calm and simply don&#39;t try to go into lengthy detail with someone<br/>
you KNOW has no interest in &quot;getting it&quot; (like, I&#39;m sorry to say, your<br/>
sister! :P) it goes better.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that works for some unschooling families is to give the concerned<br/>
relatives a few books (if you can afford it) and/or a few websites, and/or<br/>
just a reading list for them to fill themselves, and tell them, kindly,<br/>
&quot;Look, I know what I&#39;m doing is new to you and seems odd. I&#39;ve done a lot of<br/>
research and I&#39;m really comfortable with my decision. If you want to learn<br/>
more, my suggestion is you...&quot; (give books, website or book list at this<br/>
point) &quot;...and if you want to talk about it after you&#39;ve done some research,<br/>
I&#39;d be glad to. Until then, you&#39;re just going to have to trust me and if we<br/>
can&#39;t change the subject I&#39;m going to hang up and go bake some cookies.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can refuse to engage. The phone has an off switch and you have your own<br/>
set of car keys and sturdy locks on your doors. If your sister won&#39;t drop<br/>
the subject, tell her, &quot;I&#39;m not going to talk about this. I&#39;m going to go<br/>
now, I&#39;ll talk to you later. Bye!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
As for the grilling niece, does your daughter actually feel walked on or is<br/>
it just you? Don&#39;t fall into the trap (easy to do for any of us!) of<br/>
projecting your worries onto her. She may not mind at all hearing about the<br/>
field trips or being quizzed. But ask her, &quot;Hey, did anything Hortensia said<br/>
tonight bother you?&quot; Be ready to talk to her if she is upset, watch her play<br/>
and behavior and smile and grit your teeth during the visits, LOL. Doesn&#39;t<br/>
hurt if before the next visit you and your daughter go do something very<br/>
cool the day before. Doesn&#39;t hurt to limit family visits if they hurt any of<br/>
you rather than help.<br/>
