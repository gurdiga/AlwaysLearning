<div id="ygrps-yiv-192162721">I just LOVE this list!!<br/>
Everyone thinks I&#39;m nutso when I say we don&#39;t have terrible two&#39;s in our <br/>
house...it&#39;s the three&#39;s!!<br/>
I&#39;ve always found it harder to deal with the three year old need for <br/>
autonomy, but lack of understanding safety boundaries.<br/>
Two is just plain cute, and easy to distract most of the time.<br/>
<br/>
I love the way you talk about the teen stuff Sandra. It really helps to <br/>
remember that we have more tools (weapons if used wrong) and to &quot;handicap&quot; <br/>
ourselves to give our children room. I need to do that more NOW and be more <br/>
prepared when they hit the teens....I&#39;ve only got one year, yikes!<br/>
