<div id="ygrps-yiv-616329919">OK all you radicals, inquiring minds want to know. <br/>
Who&#39;s registered and toes their state&#39;s line, and who<br/>
is not and does not?  Why and why not?  I have been<br/>
going round and round with this question.  The<br/>
compulsory age here (WA) is 8-18 and as my eldest will<br/>
be 8 next year it will soon be an issue I will have to<br/>
take a stand on, one way or another.  Can they really<br/>
throw you in jail for not complying?  Gimme some info<br/>
to chew on here folks.  Thanks!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I register here (California), although as a private school, not<br/>
technically as a &quot;homeschool&quot;. There are no requirements on my child at<br/>
all, the only thing the state gets is a 3 page form that doesn&#39;t even<br/>
have my kids&#39; name on it (mostly it just names me as being the<br/>
headmaster, teacher, and keeper of all records) and the only requirements<br/>
on me are things like &quot;offering&quot; certain subjects and keeping attendance<br/>
records (she&#39;s never been absent yet).<br/>
<br/>
When we lived in Arizona when Rain was little, no one we knew registered.<br/>
They did get your name there, although there were no other requirements,<br/>
but the penalty if they caught you was a $50 fine and then you had to<br/>
register, no big deal. When we lived there a couple of years ago I didn&#39;t<br/>
register either - I could have claimed we were still California<br/>
residents, but I didn&#39;t file my private school R-4 here either, so I<br/>
guess I was just illegal. Nothing happened.<br/>
<br/>
As a single mom, though, with a periodically irate FOB, I think I&#39;m in a<br/>
slightly more precarious situation than most folks. <br/>
<br/>
I think enforcement  would vary by state, and even by city within the<br/>
state, so maybe your local folks would be better able to tell you if<br/>
anyone has actually been &quot;caught&quot;, and what the penalty would be. If it<br/>
was like Arizona - $50 fine - I&#39;d blow it off.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857741674">We&#39;re registered, but since that&#39;s all that&#39;s required here in New Mexico, it&#39;s not a big issue with me.  I have thought about being non-registered, but we made the decision to homeschool only after pre-registering our 2nd child for kindergarten, so they already knew we were here.  Every year, I&#39;m tempted to just not re-register and find out how long it takes them to discover us.  I suppose I could say I mailed the forms in and had no idea they weren&#39;t received. &lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1391075951">We register. We live in Kansas and all we have to do is fill out a small <br/>
form, takes about five minutes. Homeschooling isn&#39;t specifically mentioned in our <br/>
state law, we register as a non-accredited private school. It asks for a name <br/>
of the school and address and it asks for a name and address of someone who <br/>
keeps our records. It doesn&#39;t ask for kids names or anything. And we only have <br/>
to do it one time, unless we have a change of address or if the kids go to <br/>
school then we would have to reregister. It doesn&#39;t cost anything either. I could <br/>
have twenty kids and stay in the same house and I would still never have to <br/>
reregister, so that is nice.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, Happy Thanksgiving to all our Canadian friends!!! <br/>

NHEN&#39;s State Support Liaison for the State of Washington is Mary May at <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:marmay5@...">marmay5@...</a>. I know her well, she&#39;s VERY up-to-speed on the <br/>
homeschooling climate there and would be able to tell you whether <br/>
noncompliance involves a serious risk or not. She can also give you <br/>
ideas of ways to comply that won&#39;t impinge on an unschooler.<br/>
<br/>
Washington is different than California, so I have no personal advice - <br/>
you have real homeschooling law there.<br/>

<br/>
You can fill the forms in and make copies.  They used to have to be <br/>
notarized.  You could get them notarized just to be super-cool.  MAKE COPIES!!!<br/>
<br/>
Then put the original in an envelope.  Then put the right address on it.  <br/>
Then... Put in under the couch, or in the trash, or in a box of stuff going into <br/>
storage for years.  <br/>
<br/>
And when/IF anyone asks if you registered you say this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;You want a copy of the form?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And if the person who asks is the state, say &quot;OH, you don&#39;t have a copy?  Do <br/>
you want another one?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s not a lie.  It IS a copy.  And you can give them to all your <br/>
friends and relatives.<br/>
<br/>
I registered four years in a row.  From Kirby in kindergarten to Kirby in <br/>
third/Marty in kindergarten.<br/>
<br/>
Then I didn&#39;t register.  And nobody has ever asked in nine years.<br/>

I forgot this part.<br/>
<br/>
In New Mexico if you&#39;re found not to be in compliance, they notify you and <br/>
then you&#39;re required to comply. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re discovered again not to have done so, you could be fined up to $50 <br/>
(last I knew, up from $25).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never known of anyone being asked directly to comply.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The cases I&#39;ve heard of that ended up legal battles or a parent in jail were<br/>
about people who refused to comply with some regulation. Even with other<br/>
regulations, like having your car registered or something, they notify you<br/>
first to give you a chance to comply.<br/>

that&#39;s it&#39;s none of the states business. Except that &quot;we&quot; have allowed it to be their <br/>
business when &quot;we&quot; created government schools and compulsory education laws.<br/>
<br/>
We will register Option 3 (South Carolina) because it&#39;s not worth a fight and I really don&#39;t <br/>
want to have anything to do with DSS.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi,<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve registered in New Hampshire since we began three years ago, <br/>
mostly because of the perks of having that letter from the school <br/>
department.  All we need to do is send a &quot;letter of intent to <br/>
homeschool&quot;, and at the end of the year either do at-home testing, <br/>
or portfolio evaluation (our choice).  The letter from the SAU, <br/>
confirming we are homeschooling, has been used to acquire teacher <br/>
discounts at places like Staples, Barnes & Noble, and such, and <br/>
gives me access to a NH resource called Donation Depot (companies <br/>
donate surplus, teachers pick what they want for free).  So for us, <br/>
the pluses outweigh the minuses.<br/>
<br/>
Just my two.  :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We do.  We live in NC and there aren&#39;t that many requirements.  In NC there <br/>
is a separate nonpublic education department that handles homeschooling.  If <br/>
you do not comply with the state laws you are considered truant, then you have <br/>
to deal with the local school officials.  The laws here are very easy to comply <br/>
with so it isn&#39;t a big deal.  Also I can use the Intent To Homeschool card to <br/>
get discounts at books stores etc.  Gotta love that.  <br/>

When I didn&#39;t register in New Mexico it was on the principle of not putting <br/>
my kids at risk.  They had a testing requirement.  We ditched the test when <br/>
Kirby was 3rd grade age (which was the first test year in those days, before they <br/>
switched to 4th and then eliminated the testing altogether).  We ditched the <br/>
make-up exam, too, and I was afraid they&#39;d &quot;come after us.&quot;  They didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
I stopped registering just so I wouldn&#39;t be on the list of people they <br/>
summoned to test-day.<br/>
