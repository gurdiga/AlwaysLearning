<div id="ygrps-yiv-254242002">Hi! Our children have gone to public school until just last Spring<br/>
when we offered our 6th grade son to homeschool. We offered because<br/>
we saw him &quot;going away&quot; from us emotionally - not talking to us<br/>
anymore, not showing affection towards us, and basically shutting<br/>
down. I talked to him about it and he denied it, but when we gave him<br/>
the opportunity to homeschool he jumped on it. We pulled him out of<br/>
school after Spring Break last year, and he&#39;s been home with us<br/>
since. He has changed since he&#39;s been home and we feel connected to<br/>
his heart again - laughing, talking, playing games, having fun. He&#39;s<br/>
a very social person - loves lots of activities with kids his age.<br/>
<br/>
My problem is that he now wants to go back to 7th grade. He hasn&#39;t<br/>
even given homeschooling or decompression a chance. And he says now<br/>
that I forced him to homeschool last Spring when we pulled him out.<br/>
His memory is not accurate, but he&#39;s using homeschooling against me<br/>
now in order to get our approval to go back to school. I&#39;m really at<br/>
a losss. We want to stay connected to his heart no matter what<br/>
happens. We can&#39;t force him to love homeschooling. I have taken him<br/>
around to different homeschooling park days and he&#39;s only met one boy<br/>
he&#39;s connected with. We haven&#39;t had much luck meeting 12 year old<br/>
boys.<br/>
<br/>
Ultimately, I want him to be happy and well-adjusted. We also have a<br/>
9 year old daughter who is watching. She is unsure now what she wants<br/>
to do for the next school year.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869297256">Hi Leslie,<br/>
  I also have a 12 year old boy. Sorry I don&#39;t have much advice to offer but I have a question, why does he want to go to school? Is it only for socialization? You&#39;re right that you can&#39;t force him to love homeschooling. I love homeschooling and my son thought about going to school this fall until he visited a school for the day. During that time I was very stressed because the thought of school appaulled me. However, I did feel that he needed to make his own choice. I guess I would try to get more information as to why he feels homeschooling isn&#39;t working for him.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753729851">We did this in 3rd grade with our oldest and he did go back for less  than 2 <br/>
weeks. He has been home since and will be 15 in September. Our younger 3  (2,4 <br/>
& 6) have be living a life of unschooling since birth.<br/>
Here is the interview i did in April and discussed it: <br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wmpg.org/archivefiles/Homedad/2006mp3s/184Unschooling42506.mp3_">http://wmpg.org/archivefiles/Homedad/2006mp3s/184Unschooling42506.mp3_</a> <br/>

It should open right up and play for you... ffwd the beginning it drags a  <br/>
little...<br/>
 <br/>
As for play groups..park days esp mixed-traditional  styles... Homeschool <br/>
circles change often,kids go to school and the focus  often IME is on the parents <br/>
social needs rather than the kids. If the group  doesn&#39;t feel right leave. It <br/>
will only put more stress on your son (and you). I  had to do this last year. <br/>
The uneasiness was there and it was affecting our  unschooling bliss.<br/>
 <br/>
My point is a mix of life experiences helps to balance when one is no  longer <br/>
an interest.. Positive friendships (MAJOR) no matter the style (PS/HS) go  a <br/>
long way. My son has several PS friends near home due to the limited  <br/>
availability of unschoolers locally. His schooled friends worked at him in the  <br/>
beginning. Now they respect his choice.<br/>
 <br/>
Maybe you could begin your own group?<br/>
 <br/>
Another thought is age. 12yrs is sorta a cross over age. Body changes  <br/>
etc..What about a mature 10yr old or an open 14 yr old?<br/>
He&#39;s in transition and needs to find something cool about staying home. I  <br/>
would find what he likes to do and focus on his interests. The friends will come <br/>
 when he starts getting into things he likes. <br/>
 <br/>
Ask him why he wants to go back to school and see if you can offer what he  <br/>
feels he&#39;s missing. <br/>
You know him and he knows you. Ask him what you could do better you might  <br/>
find he just needs more 1 on 1 time..<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1308989821">Deanna:  We haven&#39;t officially begun homeschooling actually.  He was <br/>
given time off as a decompression.  We have never attempted anything <br/>
academic yet.  He&#39;s just not ready yet, I think.  He needs time to <br/>
unwind from being pushed so much at school.  And I don&#39;t want to <br/>
repeat school at home.  So we&#39;re giving him some time right now.  <br/>
But with the new school year looming over us, he sees himself at <br/>
home bored and waiting for his public school friends to get home.  <br/>
We tried going to homeschooling park days but didn&#39;t meet very many <br/>
boys his age.  Lots of girls and boys that are my daugther&#39;s age (9 <br/>
or below).  So I think he is just discouraged and wants to go back <br/>
to school for the socializiation mostly.  It&#39;s ironic, because <br/>
that&#39;s the part I have the biggest problem with.  Anyway, I think I <br/>
need to focus on meeting some other teens and pre-teens who <br/>
homeschool so he can meet some other boys his age, with similiar <br/>
interest, who don&#39;t go to public school.  <br/>

The Live and Learn Conference sounds like just what you need!  Ask him <br/>
to come check us out, it&#39;s a great opportunity for the kids to network <br/>
(at *all* ages!) and amazing bonds created.  liveandlearnconference.org <br/>

<br/>
Distract him with fun plans so he&#39;s not spending his days &quot;seeing  <br/>
himself&quot; in some imaginary bored and listless future.  Do something  <br/>
interesting every day.  Not &quot;time off,&quot; but busy, interesting outings  <br/>
outside his own neighborhood, outside his own school district.  Get  <br/>
away from the school physically and emotionally.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Try to get away from the idea that his friends need to be boys his  <br/>
age.  That&#39;s another school situation you can avoid.   And his  <br/>
friends don&#39;t need to be homeschoolers necessarily either.  There are  <br/>
other clubs and activities where he can meet kids.<br/>

<br/>
But....  Bonds aren&#39;t created unless people see each other twice,  <br/>
generally speaking.<br/>
<br/>
And if too many kids are taken out of school to go, it won&#39;t be an  <br/>
unschooling conference.  When new families come to see what  <br/>
unschoolers are like, if the kids they&#39;re seeing aren&#39;t unschoolers,  <br/>
the learning experience is diluted for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Introducing kids to other kids they&#39;ll never see again can be more  <br/>
discouraging than not, with some personalities.  Some just like to  <br/>
see that such things are possible.  Those who wanted long-term  <br/>
relationships more than the one-time experience can suffer sadness  <br/>
after instead of the uplifting memories and visions of how cool life  <br/>
can be.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling parents shouldn&#39;t think unschooling is an easy out, and  <br/>
they can just let their kids veg all day.  They need to be ACTIVELY  <br/>
unschooling, creating an interesting big life.  Pam Sorooshian  <br/>
describes this really well. I wish I&#39;d saved all she ever wrote about  <br/>
it, but I saved some:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1156319799">If a group is all wrong, which you&#39;ll be able to tell after a bit, it makes<br/>
sense to avoid it affecting your unschooling bliss. At the same time, I<br/>
really think that it&#39;s important to give most groups at least a few visits<br/>
before writing them off,  particularly if you&#39;re new. It seems as though the<br/>
older the child, the more difficult it is to &quot;break in.&quot; I know in my group<br/>
that not everyone comes every time, and the energy of the group can vary<br/>
dramatically depending on the particular mix.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a not-super-unschoolish article I wrote for Home Education magazine<br/>
on the subject of joining new homeschooling groups:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeedmag.com/HEM/231/newgroup.html">http://www.homeedmag.com/HEM/231/newgroup.html</a><br/>
<br/>
My suggestions for the transitional time (between feeling new and feeling<br/>
accepted) would be this: Encourage your child to bring lots of &quot;stuff&quot; to<br/>
the park: Balls, Gameboy, books (if that&#39;s what he likes), cool outdoor toys<br/>
(stomp rockets have been a big hit at local park days where I am). Play with<br/>
your child(ren), if they want you to -- sometimes the games attract other<br/>
children -- and, even if they don&#39;t attract other children, it&#39;s fun for you<br/>
and your children to be playing together.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the expectation of &quot;We&#39;re going here to socialize/make friends&quot;<br/>
puts pressure/expectations onto the experience, which makes it more<br/>
challenging for the 9+ set, particularly when there&#39;s no one with whom the<br/>
child feels an immediate connection.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re moving yet again, and my 10yo was excited about the move -- until we<br/>
went to the local park day. He loves the homeschool group where we are now<br/>
(as do I). My family is one of the regulars, and other children seek him out<br/>
and are excited to see him. But we&#39;ve been going virtually every week for<br/>
2.5 years! He wasn&#39;t particularly happy with the new group. He didn&#39;t think<br/>
the children his age (who happened to be new to homeschooling and were<br/>
probably uncomfortable themselves!) were particularly nice. He&#39;s never been<br/>
to school or preschool and he sees the common sophistication/cynicism of<br/>
many schooled children his age as rude. He also came in with certain<br/>
expectation for what park days should be like -- and it&#39;ll take a while<br/>
before they&#39;re approaching what he has in L.A. He does remember not liking<br/>
our current park day as much when we first came, and since he had that<br/>
experience, he&#39;s willing to keep coming back to the new one.<br/>

I used to say &quot;I need to go to talk to the moms&quot; and then if the kids  <br/>
had fun it was extra.  I knew they&#39;d have fun nearly always, and if  <br/>
they weren&#39;t we&#39;d leave early, or I&#39;d find something to do with them  <br/>
myself.  Sometimes we went specifically to help a new family.  For  <br/>
many years we were the organizing family and had more obligation to go.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe a compromise would be to go just for the middle part, when the  <br/>
most people are likely to be there, and leave early if it&#39;s not fun,  <br/>
and if/when he makes friends, go earlier.<br/>
