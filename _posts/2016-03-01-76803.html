<div id="ygrps-yiv-2139583909">I’ve lived and learned through many phases of “information delivery” about unschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
in another topic, I posted this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Some of those pages aren’t good on a phone.  Readers view will give you 150 words or so, but there’s much more there.  People who want to use this group as a resource for REALLY learning lots more about unschooling will probably do best to use a computer, rather than trying to rely on a hand-held quick-reference version.-=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
When people complain to me that it’s hard to use this group or my site from a phone, it’s insulting.  It’s like wanting the library to deliver exactly what you need, and pick it up when you’re done.  Get up and go to the library. :-)  <br/>
<br/>
That’s not the best analogy, but I’m not sure what is.  Maybe like starting to sign up for a sixteen-week class, but then asking the professor to just tell you briefly what’s to be taught because you don’t have time to take the class.  And then looking at the time and the looking out the window.  <br/>
<br/>
Somehow, it pisses me off, when people say “I don’t want to read links; just tell me.”  Or “I’ve read your whole site, and…”<br/>
<br/>
SO here is my question:<br/>
<br/>
Please, in this topic, in whatever way you want, share what has worked or not worked for you, learning about unschooling.  And what do you recommend to new people who come by.  And do you think people really should use a full-screen computer or am I just old and outdated?<br/>

What’s the best way these days for people to move from “What!?” to “Oh!” about unschooling?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290003856"><div dir="ltr">I think the only thing that *is* an issue is the phone/PC thing. Personally, I don&#39;t get a look in with our laptops. I read on my phone in bed, in the bath, in spare moments here and there when my children don&#39;t need me. If I had to get to a laptop all the time it would be a pain and I&#39;d read about unschooling and discuss it very rarely nowadays. But your pages, although not perfect on a phone, are not impossible to read on a phone. I just turn mine sideways and expand the text - it&#39;s not a big deal.<br><br>However, the links are fantastic. If people say &#39;I don&#39;t want to read links, just tell me&#39;, well that seems just lazy and demanding and time-consuming and re-inventing the wheel. It&#39;s like saying &#39;I don&#39;t want to do the work, you do it for me&#39;.<br><br>Clare</div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1290003856gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1290003856gmail_quote">On 1 March 2016 at 16:00, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801183535"><p dir="ltr">I have this saved in note form on my phone.&nbsp; I&#39;m not sure how it will look for others on a phone or otherwise, but this is my go to when I need to remind myself and just take a minute or two to relax and refocus. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I&#39;m not sure where I&#39;ve taken it from, maybe from Sandra&#39;s site, or add light and stir or maybe copied from a string of emails, so if it can be attributed to a person or people, please let me and others know.</p>
<p dir="ltr">I hope it will help others as much as it helps me :)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Be nice to your kids.<br>
Be nice to your spouse.<br>
Don&#39;t take things your children and spouse do as attacks on you - because it&#39;s probably not about you, what they&#39;re doing :-)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Even if you don&#39;t see the glass half-full at a particular moment, keep that to yourself and let your child go right along being happy as a (proverbial) clam.</p>
<p dir="ltr">If a complaint occurs to you, before you issue that complaint to your spouse or child, pause for a moment, and be sure it&#39;s something that really needs saying.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don&#39;t call things or people Stupid. Don&#39;t Hate something or someone when a simple &quot;I don&#39;t like that&quot; will do :-)</p>
<p dir="ltr">Assume your kids and your spouse are doing the best they can at any given moment.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Play with your kids.<br>
ENJOY your kids - they&#39;re only going to be little once!</p>
<p dir="ltr">You don&#39;t *Have To* do anything - but you can choose to. &#160;And you can choose not to.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Feed your kids food they enjoy before they&#39;re melting down from being hungry.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Help everyone in your house, including yourself, get to sleep peacefully when they are tired.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Value the fact that your kids value something, even if the value in that thing escapes you. &#160;Don&#39;t call their stuff or their interests crap. &#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr">Recognize and appreciate the learning that comes from making your kids&#39; lives full and exciting - and the learning that comes from living *in* the world. &#160;Be part of the world - explore, enjoy, and learn as a result!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Be your child&#39;s partner and their friend - not their teacher, their dictator, their punisher, or their adversary.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Work to make your home a place where the needs of all family members are respected and met to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don&#39;t repeat mistakes - apologize, move on, and do better!</p>
<p dir="ltr">Don&#39;t hold the mistakes of others against them - forgive, help them move on, and help them do better.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Keep an eye on tomorrow, but Be today and make today special because today is what you have, and you are together and your life is good&#160;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The words you use to talk to yourself and to the world have meaning - choose your words carefully and thoughtfully, so what you say will be what you mean :-)</p>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1428119896"><div dir="ltr"><div>I found unschooling when my oldest was about 6 months old.  I immediately loved the idea and tried to dive in.  Reading the websites (Sandra&#39;s, Joyce&#39;s, Pam&#39;s) was where I started.  Particularly Joyce&#39;s, the scattered you&#39;ll-never-read-it-all nature of Sandra&#39;s site frustrated me for a long time (I&#39;m the kind of person who actually reads user agreements...).</div><div><br></div><div>My big trip up was that reading the static words made it really easy for me to gloss over and skip the things that I really needed to think about.  It wasn&#39;t until I joined the Radical Unschooling Info facebook group and this list a few years later that I really started to confront the patterns of thought that were holding me back.  </div><div><br></div><div>Seeing other people flail and fight the wisdom in the responses helped me think more deeply about the importance of a healthy relationship with food (and helped me repair my own seriously disordered eating and relationship with my body).  It&#39;s helped me really examine what it means to be a good partner for my children and my husband.  I was stuck acting as though being their partner meant pointing out where they go wrong instead of setting them up for success.</div><div><br></div><div>Examining and removing the negativity from my marital relationship has been the hardest and most rewarding part of this journey for me.  It&#39;s easy for me to view my children as whole beings who need a partner to help them understand and navigate the world they live in.  It&#39;s been more challenging to avoid treating my husband as a broken person who needs to be fixed.</div><div><br></div><div>With the help of this list I&#39;ve made huge progress in shifting how I look at my husband and how I treat him.  Our relationship was in a really bad place for a while but things are sweeter between us now and getting better still.</div><div><br></div><div>My boys are 5 and 2, I still have a lot of learning to do but with the vast improvements I&#39;ve seen in all my relationships since reading this list I&#39;m confident I&#39;m on the right track.  I&#39;m so grateful to have this amazing resource available as I start unschooling.</div></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-1428119896gmail_extra"><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-1428119896gmail_quote">On Tue, Mar 1, 2016 at 8:00 AM, Sandra Dodd Sandra@...

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1404575571"><p dir="ltr">I get a lot out of discussions, *and* a lot out of links. Much of my time available for reading happens when I&#39;m out-waiting for the kids at dojo, waiting for someone in the car, stuck in a long line at the store, and while my kids are using our computers, so mobile is more convenient for me but I prefer the computer interface when I have the option.</p>

&nbsp;Again, I&#39;m in no way suggesting this route for others. &nbsp;It was just my own way, and I don&#39;t always take the best route.) &nbsp;I benefitted more from the back and forth of the discussion at first. &nbsp;That dialogue was kind of like trying to get something in focus under a microscope, going too far one way, then back again, iterating back and forth until it was clear enough for me to begin to identify what I was looking at. &nbsp;Then, when I went to the links, I understood the writing better. &nbsp;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">I&#39;m like that with building things in general. &nbsp;I can&#39;t read the instructions and understand them well. &nbsp;I need to go through all the bits and pieces and imagine how it all fits together. &nbsp;Once I have a clear-ish picture, I can look at the instructions and see how they make sense. &nbsp;I&#39;m not suggestion the unschooling links are instructions, but that my own reading comprehension seems to need something solid to build it&#39;s model from, and the discussions facilitated that for me at first. &nbsp;The one thing I really love about the way Sandra has her pages set up, is that so many of them are built off of the discussions. &nbsp;That was really helpful to me. &nbsp;It was a perfect extension of what was becoming familiar to me.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Another thing that didn&#39;t help me was my own arrogance. &nbsp;That probably was (and still can be) my biggest obstacle to learning. &nbsp;Once I became a little more humble, the reading was clearer and easier to digest. &nbsp;I began to see little nuances that I just couldn&#39;t see when I was looking at things as black and white, right and wrong. &nbsp;I really did need to empty my cup before I could successfully begin to learn about unschooling. &nbsp;That was likely the most important thing I did for myself. &nbsp;Perhaps it&#39;s what I was doing while I was taking a break from all reading. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure. &nbsp;I don&#39;t remember. I wasn&#39;t intentional about it, but I&#39;m glad it finally happened. &nbsp;Now, I make a habit of doing my best to make sure there&#39;s always room in my cup for more. &nbsp;:-)</span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:small;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;"><br></span></div><div style="color:rgb(34, 34, 34);font-family:arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;line-height:normal;"><span style="font-size:12.8px;">Karen James&nbsp;</span></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1473965123">i very much enjoy and need the links.  What I usually do is read the entire message first skipping the links to save for a later date.  If I try to read the link right away I get deterred from the initial back and forth.  But, having the links gives me the opportunity to go back and click on them later when my mind has cleared from the initial discussion and is ready for more input on the topic.<div><br></div><div>Sherry</div><div><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> <blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-1473965123gmail_quote" style="margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;">

<br clear="none">
in another topic, I posted this:<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
-=-Some of those pages aren’t good on a phone.  Readers view will give you 150 words or so, but there’s much more there.  People who want to use this group as a resource for REALLY learning lots more about unschooling will probably do best to use a computer, rather than trying to rely on a hand-held quick-reference version.-=-<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
When people complain to me that it’s hard to use this group or my site from a phone, it’s insulting.  It’s like wanting the library to deliver exactly what you need, and pick it up when you’re done.  Get up and go to the library. :-)  <br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
That’s not the best analogy, but I’m not sure what is.  Maybe like starting to sign up for a sixteen-week class, but then asking the professor to just tell you briefly what’s to be taught because you don’t have time to take the class.  And then looking at the time and the looking out the window.  <br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Somehow, it pisses me off, when people say “I don’t want to read links; just tell me.”  Or “I’ve read your whole site, and…”<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
SO here is my question:<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
Please, in this topic, in whatever way you want, share what has worked or not worked for you, learning about unschooling.  And what do you recommend to new people who come by.  And do you think people really should use a full-screen computer or am I just old and outdated?<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
What’s the best way these days for people to move from “What!?” to “Oh!” about unschooling?<br clear="none">
<br clear="none">
What has worked or failed for you, informationally speaking?<br clear="none">

<div id="ygrps-yiv-939605356">&lt;Please, in this topic, in whatever way you want, share what has worked or not worked for you, learning about unschooling.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, time is what has worked for us, mostly. In the beginning, I was lucky enough to join a local group with lots of older unschooled kids, when Kai was 3, and that was really helpful too. As for reading, I only read on my laptop - so I can&#39;t comment on how pages look on a phone. I don&#39;t like reading on my phone at all.<br/>
<br/>
Early on, I also found Sandra&#39;s site overwhelming - possibly because it covers so many topics that, at that time, just seemed crazy to me (food, video games, etc). I read a few books - John Taylor Gatto, Alison McKee, and I read bits and pieces elsewhere. I think, when people don&#39;t want to read links, it may be because of some inner idea that *their* situation is different? Unique, somehow? They just don&#39;t understand in the beginning that they are asking the same question that has been asked over and over, so they don&#39;t want a standard response, they want a personal one? Not sure...I&#39;m not articulating that idea very well.<br/>
<br/>
I joined (and left a few times in a huff!) Sandra&#39;s facebook group...but honestly it was just time, and having access to other radical unschoolers in our life that mostly helped. By the time Kai was 6 or so (he&#39;s almost 10 now), I was in a place where I LOVED Sandra&#39;s website - I was ready to take all that information on board by then. I re-joined the facebook group, and began to write more on there and on here. Responding to others has also helped our unschooling, though it took a good few years before I was in a position where I thought I could respond helpfully, and I&#39;m still working on my writing [&#X1f60a]<br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] How to learn about unschooling<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lived and learned through many phases of &quot;information delivery&quot; about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
in another topic, I posted this:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Some of those pages aren&#39;t good on a phone. Readers view will give you 150 words or so, but there&#39;s much more there. People who want to use this group as a resource for REALLY learning lots more about unschooling will probably do best to use a computer, rather than trying to rely on a hand-held quick-reference version.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When people complain to me that it&#39;s hard to use this group or my site from a phone, it&#39;s insulting. It&#39;s like wanting the library to deliver exactly what you need, and pick it up when you&#39;re done. Get up and go to the library. :-)<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the best analogy, but I&#39;m not sure what is. Maybe like starting to sign up for a sixteen-week class, but then asking the professor to just tell you briefly what&#39;s to be taught because you don&#39;t have time to take the class. And then looking at the time and the looking out the window.<br/>
<br/>
Somehow, it pisses me off, when people say &quot;I don&#39;t want to read links; just tell me.&quot; Or &quot;I&#39;ve read your whole site, and...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
SO here is my question:<br/>
<br/>
Please, in this topic, in whatever way you want, share what has worked or not worked for you, learning about unschooling. And what do you recommend to new people who come by. And do you think people really should use a full-screen computer or am I just old and outdated?<br/>
<br/>
What&#39;s the best way these days for people to move from &quot;What!?&quot; to &quot;Oh!&quot; about unschooling?<br/>
<br/>
What has worked or failed for you, informationally speaking?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra<br/>

I&#39;ve written to the group more than once, asking for advice, and I remember feeling, in the beginning, that the answers I got didn&#39;t address my questions 100%. I never acted out on that feeling and I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t. ;) I now know it meant that I needed to better understand how the group worked (that once we post something, it&#39;s no longer *our question* and the answers are not exclusively directed at us -- it&#39;s unschooling-discussion material and the number of people who can benefit from it is huge) and that I needed to read more, try more, wait more, watch more. </div><div><br></div><div>I also remember feeling a sort of urgency to know the right answer to my question so I could do something quickly and fix the problem at hand (so I thought). Thing is, this state of emergency doesn&#39;t help with clear thinking and emotional calmness. Quite the contrary, I believe it only muddles our thought processes and maintain a feeling of restlessness and uneasiness. And behavioral patterns that might be causing said problems don&#39;t change overnight, that has been my experience. Change takes time, it happens in tiny bits and pieces, here and there.</div><div><br></div><div>Anyway, as I continued to read and observe people&#39;s reactions, and the moderators&#39; answers to those reactions, explaining why the group worked the way it did, I started to see patterns. That&#39;s when I started to really understand that the way Sandra&#39;s group worked was exactly what made it so efficient. I wouldn&#39;t want it any other way now. :)</div><div><br></div><div>The way I see it, the group isn&#39;t here to *deliver* specific answers to questions that are brought by specific people. It&#39;s here to discuss the radical unschooling principles behind those questions. And even if sometimes the principles don&#39;t apply to that situation in particular (which I think hardly ever happens), a ton of other parents will benefit from reading about it, for sure. I certainly have, in many discussions that I&#39;ve followed here.</div><div><br></div><div>And the only way I was able to see those principles and learn more and more about unschooling was by reading here, on Radical Unschooling Info (facebook) and on Sandra&#39;s website, following the links that were shared in these discussions.</div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-2043890011gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><div><div><div><p>Please, in this topic, in whatever way you want, share what has worked or not worked for you, learning about unschooling.  And what do you recommend to new people who come by.</p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>Something that clearly didn&#39;t help, and that Karen has already mentioned, was reading about unschooling in a lot of different places. That didn&#39;t work for me, it confused me.

I&#39;m not talking about reading twenty links on your website in a day. Instead, reading something about unschooling and peaceful parenting everyday, even if just a little bit. Even if it&#39;s only a post from Just Add Light and Stir as I wake up or listening to part of a talk at a conference or a podcast while I cook or clean the kitchen.</div><div><br></div><div>It still happens that sometimes I slowly start to feel like I&#39;m derailing and getting more stressed or doubtful when I haven&#39;t read for a while (it happened recently, when my father was very ill and then passed away), so reading a little something everyday reminds me of what&#39;s important and where I want to go. It usually also uplifts me and gives me confidence and that feels so good.</div><div><br></div><div>More things that have worked for me -- actively trying things that I&#39;ve read about. Watching what happens, with me, with my child, with my husband, with my family and friends. </div></div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-2043890011gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><div><div><div><p> And do you think people really should use a full-screen computer or am I just old and outdated?<br></p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>I&#39;m 41 and I prefer to read these discussions and the links to your website on my computer, so maybe I&#39;m old and outdated too? :) Yes, sometimes I do read on my cell phone but it&#39;s usually when I&#39;m still in bed and Conchinha is sleeping (she won&#39;t sleep as much if I&#39;m not there) or when we&#39;re out and about and she&#39;s ok playing with a friend or with her grandmother.

I do have more time now because Conchinha is really into minecraft and skyping with friends, but even when she was younger, I chose to read a bit every night, after she fell asleep. </div><div><br></div><div>Because I want to know how to unschool well, and because I know firsthand that learning about and living by unschooling principles is life-changing on so many levels, I have made it a priority to have time to focus and read, to think and have a chat with friends/with Bruno about it. This meant gradually letting go of other things, like an unschooling discussion group that I helped moderate on facebook or an unschooling book that I was going to help translate or having a really clean and spotless house or cooking homemade nutritious meals every day of the week. As Conchinha grows and her needs shift, I know I will have time to get back to all of that.</div><blockquote class="ygrps-yiv-2043890011gmail_quote" style="margin:0px 0px 0px 0.8ex;border-left-width:1px;border-left-color:rgb(204,204,204);border-left-style:solid;padding-left:1ex;"><div style="background-color:rgb(255,255,255);"><div><div><div><p>What’s the best way these days for people to move from “What!?” to “Oh!” about unschooling?</p></div></div></div></div></blockquote><div>I&#39;d say reading calmly, thinking a bit about it, trying out some of the suggestions, waiting as a situation unfolds and we can use those ideas, watching to see what happens when we do something different and how it feels. I think it takes patience and perseverance but it&#39;s so worth it. It has been for me.</div><div><br></div><div>Marta <br></div></span></blockquote></div></div></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-799595011">-=-I guess what&#39;s worked best for me is to look at the learning process like eating a pie.  You take a small slice and eat it bite by bite -- you don&#39;t throw the whole pie in your mouth and be done with it.  That will make you sick.  For me, the idea of either absorbing a lot of information at once or of letting go of all my limits too quickly was too much.  So I&#39;ll eat my unschooling pie slowly, enjoy the process and document it on the way.  :)-=-<br/>

Nada Sheppard wrote that.  I like it.<br/>

She also wrote something less clear and not as useful. :-)<br/>
<br/>
-=-What has not worked for me was giving up total freedom all at once. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not giving up total freedom?  Did you start to say “control”?<br/>
Not giving *them* total freedom?<br/>
<br/>
“Freedom” isn’t a good goal.  “Total freedom” doesn’t even exist.  <br/>
Step back away from that cliff.  It won’t build peace or clarity, to think about “freedom.”<br/>
<br/>
Think about choices and options.<br/>

P.S.  One pie won’t be enough.  When people think they’ve got it, and they’re really unschooling, they’ll eventually come to a place where another whole area opens up that they hadn’t considered before (because they didn’t know enough, yet, to perceive it).</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1621854001"><html><head></head><div></div><div>I&#39;m still new to unschooling; not quite 2 years in. One of my favorite ways to learn about unschooling was a podcast series by Amy Childs. I listened to each episode multiple times, and found it especially helpful when I was feeling anxious about my decision to unschool. I also subscribed to Pam Laricchia&#39;s intro to unschooling email series. I joined this group and the Facebook group, and I try to keep up with reading the emails and posts daily. I pay attention mostly to the responses of Sandra, Joyce, Clare, Alex, and a few others who have been the core group of unschooling guides since I&#39;ve been a member. I did buy a couple of books on unschooling, after failing to find them in my local library, however, I find little time to sit and read these days. I follow other unschoolers on social media. I get most of my information through social media platforms. The one that failed me was Pinterest. There was just too much going on there, and too many &quot;eclectic homeschooling&quot; things mixed in with unschooling ideas. As for the phone vs computer: I almost never sit down at my computer at home. I read on my phone, listen to podcasts on my phone, and check Facebook and email on my phone. It works for me.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Laura&nbsp;</div><div><br><blockquote><span title="qreply"> On Mar 1, 2016, at 11:00 AM, Sandra Dodd <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:Sandra@...">Sandra@...</a> [AlwaysLearning] &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br><br></span></blockquote></div><blockquote type="cite"><div>

      <p>I’ve lived and learned through many phases of “information delivery” about unschooling.  <br>
<br>
in another topic, I posted this:<br>
<br>
-=-Some of those pages aren’t good on a phone.  Readers view will give you 150 words or so, but there’s much more there.  People who want to use this group as a resource for REALLY learning lots more about unschooling will probably do best to use a computer, rather than trying to rely on a hand-held quick-reference version.-=-<br>
<br>
When people complain to me that it’s hard to use this group or my site from a phone, it’s insulting.  It’s like wanting the library to deliver exactly what you need, and pick it up when you’re done.  Get up and go to the library. :-)  <br>
<br>
That’s not the best analogy, but I’m not sure what is.  Maybe like starting to sign up for a sixteen-week class, but then asking the professor to just tell you briefly what’s to be taught because you don’t have time to take the class.  And then looking at the time and the looking out the window.  <br>
<br>
Somehow, it pisses me off, when people say “I don’t want to read links; just tell me.”  Or “I’ve read your whole site, and…”<br>
<br>
SO here is my question:<br>
<br>
Please, in this topic, in whatever way you want, share what has worked or not worked for you, learning about unschooling.  And what do you recommend to new people who come by.  And do you think people really should use a full-screen computer or am I just old and outdated?<br>
<br>
What’s the best way these days for people to move from “What!?” to “Oh!” about unschooling?<br>
<br>
What has worked or failed for you, informationally speaking?<br>
<br>

Even for me, I&#39;ve been unschooling for 10 years, my oldest is 11, and now that my youngest 2 want to be so active, I am too busy to sit at my computer to read and post online. However, I can take my phone everywhere and do find myself keeping up with unschooling ideas and communities and continuing to learn and grow by reading on my phone while I am waiting for my kids or while I am on the toilet.

I found that I really needed and benefitted from time and space to myself, without anyone around, including my children... understanding my needs also gave me permission to just lie on the couch and breath and tell the kids I needed 10 minutes before I could attend to them again... and I think it has been good for them to see me taking responsibility for my emotions and needs while also learning to respect my boundaries)</div><div><br></div><div>Kind regards,</div><div>Anjelika </div><div><br class="ygrps-yiv-1669212191yui-cursor"></div></div>
