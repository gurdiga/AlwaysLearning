<div id="ygrps-yiv-199949323">I just looked at all the photographs you guys posted!! How awesome. <br/>
It&#39;s so great to put faces with some of the names finally.<br/>
I vote Janene&#39;s as the cutest photo....that little sister kiss was so <br/>
sweet.<br/>
What a bunch of really cute kids though. Maybe it&#39;s that happy, <br/>
carefree glow that comes from being unschoolers?<br/>
I think so.<br/>
How do I post a pic? I need to do one of our whole family, we&#39;re a <br/>
bit behind on doing that. I have to put them on disk first as we <br/>
don&#39;t have a scanner or digital camera.<br/>
How fun.<br/>
Thanks for breaking the ice on posting your handwriting Dan...maybe <br/>
I&#39;ll get up the courage to do it.<br/>
I hate for anyone to see my handwriting still.<br/>
All those years of being shamed for my bad penmanship are still with <br/>
me I guess...how dumb.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>just have it on your computer, then go to<br/>
add  photo, and then click browse, find where<br/>
it&#39;s stored and click on it, type a caption,<br/>
and you are done!<br/>
