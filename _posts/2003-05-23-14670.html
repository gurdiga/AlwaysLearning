Have any room in one of the bags for me?  OMG, I am SO jealous!!! Although I <br/>
searched and searched for plane tickets to go to the conference, it&#39;s just not <br/>
gonna happen this year. Believe it or not it&#39;s way cheaper for us to fly to <br/>
Hawaii. I&#39;m not going there either, but I was shocked at the difference in <br/>
fares.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great summer in paradise!!!!<br/>

You poor soul. I was just thinking of responses to each of those questions <br/>
and came up with one word you could use for each one.....well.  The word well, <br/>
can be a statement, a question, or in contemplation of ones thoughts. So if for <br/>
every question they ask, what if all you answered with was....well? You could <br/>
even say it and nod your head depending on the question and simply answer <br/>
with the retorical ...well.<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Try to have fun in paradise anyway, I&#39;m still jealous....<br/>

of their questions....well. LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752648307">Thanks, Rhonda! Well just might work.  After all, it&#39;s at least as expressive as mil&#39;s &quot;oh&quot;   It&#39;s really only first 8 days until Gary arrives that worry me.  All in all, they&#39;re great parents and she was a huge help when I was on bedrest before Dan&#39;s birth.  Of course, that was before I lost my mind and kept the boys home from school!<br/>
