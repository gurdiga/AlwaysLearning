<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838253001">I thought I&#39;d share an incident that happened that let me know that I <br/>
am growing in the unschooling philosophy.<br/>
<br/>
I was running an errand and my husband was in charge of the kids (8 <br/>
and 6).  Actually, he was in the den watching t.v. and the kids were <br/>
in the living room playing.  When I got home, my daughter ran up to <br/>
me and said, &quot;Mommy!  (Brother) did something naughty! Hurry and <br/>
see!&quot;  My first thought was, &quot;Oh, no.  What did he do THIS time?&quot;  <br/>
Well, my daughter led me to the living room and pointed at the big <br/>
train table we have set up (it&#39;s one of those with the plain white <br/>
formica type top.  The kids use if for all kinds of toys, but usually <br/>
NOT for trains!)<br/>
<br/>
My son had drawn all over the top and even on the wood sides with a <br/>
permanent marker!  At first, my usual response began to erupt from my <br/>
mouth, &quot;Oh, Matthew!&quot; (in a very dismayed voice) and then I noticed <br/>
what I was thinking and how I was about to make my son feel horrible <br/>
and afraid and guilty.  I stopped for a second and really LOOKED at <br/>
his drawings.  They were totally awesome!  He had drawn palm trees <br/>
that looked really good and all sorts of ocean type things (he&#39;s into <br/>
the Beach Boys and sharks right now).  My son had run away as soon as <br/>
I began to show the look of horror on my face.  He was hiding around <br/>
the corner and peeking to see what I was doing.  I smiled at him and <br/>
asked him to come tell me about his art work.  He hesitantly came <br/>
over and then, when he knew I wasn&#39;t going to yell at him, happily <br/>
began explaining what all he had drawn.  <br/>
<br/>
After he was all finished telling me, I gently told him that he <br/>
should probably talk to me or daddy first before drawing on something <br/>
that isn&#39;t paper.  I explained to him that permanent markers usually <br/>
don&#39;t come off (I don&#39;t keep permanent markers out, but evidentally, <br/>
my daughter had found one with my scrapbooking stuff and had it out <br/>
while I was gone).  All three of us worked at getting the marker off <br/>
(which was nearly impossible - but finally we found nail polish <br/>
remover worked).  My son actually had fun cleaning it up and making <br/>
it disappear.  We never could get his name off the wood side, though!<br/>
<br/>
Then I realized that I should have taken a picture of his beautiful <br/>
art work.  Drats!  As we were cleaning, I thought about what he may <br/>
have been thinking.  He may have seen that big expanse of white and, <br/>
since he loves to draw, he probably couldn&#39;t resist the urge.  I <br/>
wondered how I could help him meet his need to have a big area to <br/>
draw.  Then I remembered that we have a bunch of colored dry erase <br/>
markers.  I told my son that we would try a little of the dry erase <br/>
markers on the table and see if they would clean up easily.  It <br/>
worked!  So for the last two days, my son has been drawing an <br/>
unbelievable mural on the train table using dry erase markers.  It is <br/>
a wonderful scene of shark fins coming out of an ocean.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
taking pictures of his progress.<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to share that it is getting a little easier to stop <br/>
some of the learned, automatic responses I usually have and replace <br/>
them with more mindful thinking.<br/>

Thank you.  I&#39;m saving it.<br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to share that we use tea tree/Melaleuca oil to get permanant<br/>
marker off various surfaces all the time. I think you can get it at Wal-Mart<br/>
and Target.<br/>
