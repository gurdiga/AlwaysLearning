 </span></blockquote>We just started getting Boomerang.  We&#39;ve gotten three so far.  My <br/>
five year old loves it and listens to them over and over.  She <br/>
already loved stories and books on tape.  I like to listen to <br/>
Boomerang, too, so it&#39;s great for the car.  I&#39;m not sure what the <br/>
age range is for it.<br/>

You might want to see if your library can get back issues through<br/>
interlibrary loan so you can check them out.<br/>
