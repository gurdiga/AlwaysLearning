<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You can have those braids long, or wrap them around your head and tie the<br/>
&gt; yarn to itself, or around by your ear when you get to a good stopping place<br/>
&gt; (depends how long it all is whether it just goes over the top, or first under<br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; then over, or time and a half...)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I was going to cut my hair short this week.  But now you&#39;ve inspired me to a<br/>
least wait until after I&#39;ve come see you.  I hafta see this, I can&#39;t<br/>
envision it at all.  Sounds cool!<br/>
