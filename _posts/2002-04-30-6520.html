when we tell them he&#39;s a boy.  As if we wouldn&#39;t know for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I have never been exactly conventional, so his choice to grow his hair<br/>
long hasn&#39;t been an issue for me.  I think it was harder for his dad. <br/>
His dad had long hair when he was younger, but I think his boy being<br/>
mistaken for a girl bothered him a little at first.  He&#39;s over that.  <br/>
<br/>
Dylan took a lot of harassment, ( a friendly kind, usually ) at Karate<br/>
for this long hair until another unschooler joined, with even longer<br/>
hair.  He&#39;s 13, and very cool, and all the girls swarmed around him, so<br/>
kind of by association Dylan&#39;s long hair became cool. <br/>
<br/>
One little girl asked me, &quot;Is your daughter a girl or a boy?&quot;.  &lt;G&gt;   <br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s lately taken to wearing funky hemp hats.  <br/>
Tattoos and piercing&#39;s will be next, I expect.  <br/>
Then a Harley.<br/>

eyes....one of his favorite is fake lizard skin.<br/>
Another says &quot;Legends Never Die&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Recently when he helped to carry out the bag of dog<br/>
food from the store, a comment was made that &quot;She is<br/>
strong. She&#39;s a cowgirl.&quot;  He was wearing his cowboy<br/>
boots and a bandana as a headband. Sheesh.<br/>

That&#39;s about 2/3 of his hair, showing there.<br/>
<br/>
He did get it cut when he was nine or so, and said he would grow it back when <br/>
he had facial hair.  He started letting it grow again when he started getting <br/>
some bulk and wouldn&#39;t be mistaken for a girl in the men&#39;s room.  He doesn&#39;t <br/>
let his facial hair grow in now that he could, but he&#39;s also not going to be <br/>
mistaken for a girl.<br/>
<br/>
Their dad has waist-long hair too.  Marty shaves his head.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>:-) And Cacie was mistaken for a boy for a while, when her hair was sort<br/>
of one-length to the bottom of the ear, and she wore mostly baggy jeans<br/>
and oversized t shirts. It was... interesting. One girl didn&#39;t believe<br/>
her when she said she was a girl. A couple of people told her pointedly<br/>
that she was in the *girl&#39;s* restroom. She took it all in stride, and I<br/>
think kind of enjoyed it for a while... then she got a tired of it and<br/>
went and got a haircut with bangs, and that ended it.<br/>
<br/>
I sort of miss her thick waist-length, golden-blonde waves of hair... she<br/>
went short when she decided to stop dying her hair. I sort of miss the<br/>
long blue hair too...<br/>
<br/>
Her dad had shoulder length hair until about a year ago, when he decided<br/>
that his bald spot had grown too big for that look, so he shaved it...<br/>
