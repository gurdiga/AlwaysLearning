<div id="ygrps-yiv-207725138">I&#39;ve just discovered how truly difficult it is to acquire an assault weapon <br/>
in Southern California.<br/>
 <br/>
A toy one, I mean.  <br/>
 <br/>
Sam (12) wants to be a &quot;Terror-tubby&quot; for Halloween.  (His idea.  Like a <br/>
terrorist Teletubby.)  <br/>
 <br/>
Abby and I went looking today at Big Lots, 99 Cents Only, Toys &#39;R&#39; Us and <br/>
Dollar Tree.  Yesterday Sam and I checked Target and Walmart.  Nada.  Zip.  (We <br/>
had some time to kill while Sam was at a nearby skateboard competition...I <br/>
don&#39;t usually cruise six stores for one item.  Well, sometimes.)<br/>
 <br/>
You can get a plastic Ninja knife.  Or a lightsaber.  A Wild West cowboy or <br/>
pirate flintlock pistol.  Or a gladiator kit.  Or get this, Toys &#39;R&#39; Us sells <br/>
an &quot;electronic soldier kit,&quot; complete with helmet with working flashlight, <br/>
interactive belt, vest, binoculars, goggles, shovel, dog tags, walkie talkie, <br/>
compass, medal and a whistle, but NO gun.<br/>
 <br/>
I mean, I get the idea.  Everybody&#39;s afraid that some nine-year old kid is <br/>
going to walk into 7-11 with one of these things and freak out the clerk who <br/>
thinks it&#39;s real and shoots the kid whose parents then sue the toy company, or <br/>
whatever variation of that.  But I just figured there&#39;d be *some* <br/>
socially-apathetic manufacturer somewhere in China importing the things to some cheap store <br/>
and that they wouldn&#39;t be so hard to find.  <br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;re available on ebay, so they must be selling them somewhere.  I know <br/>
I&#39;ve seen them before.  But we didn&#39;t start soon enough because I thought it&#39;d <br/>
be easy to get.  (Perhaps I was thinking of *real* guns.)<br/>
 <br/>
I just feel so SAFE now, though.  LOL  <br/>
 <br/>
Sam was very appreciative of our efforts, and was fine settling for a pirate <br/>
knife and a camouflage hat and glove set I picked up at Dollar Tree, which <br/>
he&#39;ll wear with a red hoodie sweat suit with a tv test pattern taped to his <br/>
tummy.  We&#39;re going to attach the red &quot;Po&quot; circle made out of pipecleaners to the <br/>
top of the hat.  <br/>
 <br/>
We plan to keep him out of 7-11 on Halloween though, just to be on the safe <br/>
side. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

From what I understand about toy guns is that they all have a red tip <br/>
where the bullet would come out if it were a real gun.  It&#39;s what <br/>
police officers and others use to identify a real one from a fake one <br/>
quickly.  So, if you make one that ends up looking real, put a red end <br/>
on it and 7-11 employees won&#39;t be scared!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1093967639">Thanks for all the ideas, y&#39;all.  It&#39;s so good know I have such<br/>
support in our seminal efforts to stockpile weapons.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
In our ebay search we came across sniper rifles and M16&#39;s in an<br/>
airsoft version.  Upon hearing this, dh got involved and started<br/>
looking into what the local sporting goods stores might have in stock.<br/>
 We quickly moved beyond the Halloween costume budget, but once Sam<br/>
discovered we&#39;d support him in an airsoft gun purchase he was more<br/>
than willing to chip in with his own money.<br/>
<br/>
So again, thanks everybody, for pushing me a bit further in this.  I&#39;d<br/>
have stopped at the knife and then I wouldn&#39;t have such a happy kid<br/>
running around the backyard shooting holes in cardboard boxes with an<br/>
M16 (complete with the red tip at the end of the barrel.)<br/>

Marty and Holly told us this afternoon they need waterguns for their  <br/>
costumes.  Not super-soaker types, but little traditional ones.  I  <br/>
knew where one was and went and got it.  They each found another kind  <br/>
of toy gun in their own rooms, but they might still go out tonight  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-414989567">We got a bag of three old-time water pistols at CVS (the drugstore) not too<br/>
long ago for $1. (orange, yellow, and green though)<br/>
<br/>
Here in Los Angeles you can get real looking guns at prop houses for some<br/>
kinda serious money (I don&#39;t remember exactly, $60-ish maybe) but you can<br/>
also get them at flea markets for about $12.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also this site - www.realistic*toy**guns*.com/ not in time for<br/>
Halloween unfortunately.<br/>

Y&#39;see?<br/>
<br/>
THERE&#39;s the cause of violence--neediness and desire.<br/>
<br/>
Our dog went to the vet.  I was out of town, but Keith and Marty took  <br/>
her.  She hadn&#39;t been to the vet for years, and other than the  <br/>
physical questions and some kind of skin tumor thing they removed,  <br/>
she was good, at nearly ten years old.  So the vet asked what she  <br/>
eats.  Keith said dry dog food, people scraps, cat food...  We leave  <br/>
food down for her and the cats all the time.<br/>
<br/>
The vet started to give the speech about it being bad, I guess, but  <br/>
here was this dog that&#39;s fine and fit.  So what she said was she was  <br/>
surprised the dog wasn&#39;t overweight.<br/>
<br/>
Because there&#39;s food down, the dog eats when she&#39;s hungry.  Sometimes  <br/>
she eats the cats&#39; food.  We could get mad about it, but we just put  <br/>
down more cat food.  She doesn&#39;t take it away from the cats, she eats  <br/>
what they leave.  The cats don&#39;t eat fast, or all, because they know  <br/>
there will be more.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the dog hasn&#39;t had anything special or interesting, so I  <br/>
put down the cat food I know she like best. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

It&#39;s obscure.<br/>
They&#39;re being the main characters of a Super Nintendo game called  <br/>
Zombies Ate My Neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
They only figure three or four of their own closest friends will get  <br/>
it, but they&#39;re very happy.  Unfortunately, there&#39;s no party to go  <br/>
to, but they&#39;re going to go hang out with friends and maybe visit  <br/>
other friends.<br/>
<br/>
Marty made a pair of 3D classes.  We had real ones, but he wanted  <br/>
something more substantial.  He asked if we had colored plastic, and  <br/>
I did have a packet of colored plastic folders, like the kind people  <br/>
put sets of papers in into a file cabinet.  He was happy, and I was  <br/>
happy to be able to open a drawer and produce the thing.  But the red  <br/>
was kind of orange.  So I went into my filing cabinet, into some  <br/>
years when I was using such things, and traded his out for a redder one.<br/>
<br/>
He used cardstock from a carton and painted it white.  It took a few  <br/>
coats because he used the printed side.  I asked why he didn&#39;t turn  <br/>
it inside, but there were two good reasons  The existing folds fit  <br/>
his face, and he worked on those, and he wanted them to look good  <br/>
inside and outside.<br/>
<br/>
I had suggested he make two layers and glue them so the &quot;lenses&quot;  <br/>
would be held in like a frame, but he really wanted the plastic to be  <br/>
fastened.   &quot;Will Elmer&#39;s glue work?&quot;  No, I said.  Then a few hours  <br/>
later I remembered suddenly how I used to glue wall paper samples as  <br/>
covers on the dictionaries I used as textbooks when I taught Jr.  <br/>
High.  The covers were glossy and the glue wouldn&#39;t stick, so I put  <br/>
masking tape strips on the edges and the glue would stick to the  <br/>
inside of the vinyl wallpaper and to the outside of the masking  <br/>
tape.  So I called him (he was out) and told him and he came home and  <br/>
did that.<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching, I would figure out how to get American Heritage  <br/>
paperback dictionaries in bulk as inexpensively as I could (one year  <br/>
a dollar a copy through Scholastic books) and the dad of a friend of  <br/>
mine owned a hardware store and would give me sample books of  <br/>
wallpaper.  Each large page would cover two books.  So I&#39;d put the  <br/>
paper down and kids would choose one and put their names inside. I&#39;d  <br/>
glue the covers on and then the books lasted longer, the kids could  <br/>
find their own easily in the pile (we left them in lockers sorted by  <br/>
classes in the classroom), and I wish I had photos, because these  <br/>
were all the best of flocked and textured and metallic-sheen vinyl  <br/>
wall coverings of the early 1970&#39;s.   I probably do have a few,  <br/>
falling apart, somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
So Marty&#39;s glasses worked great, and Holly has a red cap to run her  <br/>
pony tail out the back of, but she&#39;s not liking the effect.  I might  <br/>
take her to Savers to get a costume wig she can make a ponytail out  <br/>
of.  I have two real human hair braids, but one is Kirby&#39;s from when  <br/>
he was twelve or so, and the other is her dead biker uncle&#39;s and she  <br/>
declines to wear that.  I said &quot;HEY, it&#39;s Halloween!&quot;  But no.<br/>
<br/>
My granny had hair cuttings in a scrap book in a drawer.  People I  <br/>
hadn&#39;t known, hair.  I think it was common in the 19th century.   <br/>
People made gifts out of hair, and embroidered it into things, and  <br/>
there were lockets for hair samples (God, is there a connection  <br/>
between &quot;locks&quot; of hair and &quot;lockets&quot;?  I&#39;m sitting here thinking of  <br/>
dictionaries...)  It creeped me out completely.<br/>
<br/>
This is why I hesitate to tell stories sometimes.  (I do!  You  <br/>
couldn&#39;t tell? &lt;g&gt;)   I don&#39;t want to drop off all the connections  <br/>
they lead to, and I always have to drop some, or leave them all out,  <br/>
but often that&#39;s the best part of the answers to simple questions, is  <br/>
how it fits into a life of connections.<br/>
<br/>
They found good water guns at Walgreen&#39;s.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; This is why I hesitate to tell stories sometimes.  (I do!  You  <br/>
&gt; couldn&#39;t tell? &lt;g&gt;)   I don&#39;t want to drop off all the connections  <br/>
&gt; they lead to, and I always have to drop some, or leave them all out,  <br/>
&gt; but often that&#39;s the best part of the answers to simple questions, is <br/>
 </span></blockquote>how it fits into a life of connections.<br/>
<br/>
I LOVE reading about the connections...the way they flow; from 3-D <br/>
glasses to wallpaper from the &#39;70&#39;s to hair jewelry...it&#39;s so cool! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146333270">&lt;&lt;THERE&#39;s the cause of violence--neediness and desire.&gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
And frustration!  When you just can&#39;t figure out how to stop  something or <br/>
someone or make something happen or stop happening... and  everything just keeps <br/>
getting in your way and nobody&#39;s cooperating...and you  just don&#39;t feel like <br/>
you have any good ideas or options left?  What else  can you do?  Start <br/>
biting!  Hitting!  Punching!   Shooting!  Dropping bombs!<br/>
 <br/>
I always find it interesting when I&#39;m watching a movie, and the story&#39;s so  <br/>
well-crafted that even I as the viewer get so frustrated with the lack of  <br/>
apparent options that I start coaching the character to just shoot the  person. <br/>

I laughed.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite TV show is Boston Legal, and in two different storylines,  <br/>
two people were killed in the other night&#39;s episodes--not shown, but  <br/>
reported.  The reactions of people about it were the main parts of  <br/>
the stories.  I just got off the phone with someone running a series  <br/>
of discussions with me, and we&#39;re going to do a session on Beowulf,  <br/>
and it&#39;s about killings that people celebrate.  &quot;Needed killin&#39;&quot;  <br/>
situations.<br/>
<br/>
And all of those are about the kind of powerlessness described so  <br/>
well here:<br/>

One of my favorite movies is &quot;Thunderheart&quot; with Val Kilmer and (Potential<br/>
SPOILER Alert here!!!) I always want him to shoot Sam Shepard when they are<br/>
standing at the stronghold - I want all those Indians to just open fire, as<br/>
a matter of fact- but he never does.  I have seen it about 150 times now and<br/>
he never, never shoots him, no matter how loud I yell at the tv.<br/>
<br/>
That is definitely a case of a response to powerlessness though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-316483804">Our dogs too - we have two 80 lb huskies - we just leave their bowls down (except when I wash them ;)  We just fill them up and when they are empty we refill them - they are very fit.  They do periodically guard them from each other for some weird dog reason I guess.  Just periodically one will decide to lay next to one of the bowls and grrr at the other when he/she gets near. One is male and the other female - out of the same litter.  Most often one will eat and then the other out of the same bowl,  leaving one bowl untouched.<br/>
