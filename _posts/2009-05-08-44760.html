<div id="ygrps-yiv-1869175099">I&#39;ve been reading about and seeing the monkey platters.  Very cool.<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share what we do here quite a lot.  We seem to be the house where multiple kids hang out for the day.  I can have anywhere from 2-6 extra kids here, and they are not from our neighborhood.  Jamie will invite someone (or two) and then Jack will want his friend too, then a sibling will want to come too and.....<br/>
I set up our counter as a smorg.  with grapes, olives, pizza bites, a plate of pb&j&#39;s cut into triangles, oranges, apples, nuts, sometimes I fry up homemade french fries (a huge hit), raisins, cookies......<br/>
The kids love it.  One of them asked me, after she&#39;d been to our house a few times.  &quot;Do you do this every day!?&quot;<br/>
It&#39;s fun for me too.  The kids will gather all together at first and then grazers will come by through the day, and each time I get to chat with them and get to know them a little better. Or, I get to tune in, to my kids.<br/>
