<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710988635">Thank you Sandra and Dar, you gave me much to think about. I do find Ashley <br/>
totally able to handle her brother when other outsiders are not part of the <br/>
picture. She does want freedom from him and she gets alot. Playdates, <br/>
sleepovers, weekends at friends houses. When she asks for time with just her <br/>
friends she gets it. She is involved in lots of out of the home activities <br/>
because she loves them. She does take up a huge amount of my time and I&#39;m <br/>
feeling way overwhelmed by her constant negative to her brother. I have <br/>
flubbed at times and have tried control parenting, it doesn&#39;t work, so maybe <br/>
she is sending some of it back. As for the game, yes, Riley maybe should <br/>
have played something different. The 3 of them picked the game. Ashley was <br/>
actually suppose to be at the 4-H meeting and slipped out when I wasn&#39;t <br/>
looking. OK with me, we unschool, right, if you want to be out go ahead. <br/>
Ashley and 17 year old friend each got a turn being it. Logic says he should <br/>
be next, but they wouldn&#39;t budge about him being a non speller. The 17 year <br/>
old is a girl scout conselor and very intune with the kids, it suprised me <br/>
too, but I see favoritism sometimes. My daughter is a magnet for friends, <br/>
she makes them all over the place. My son is having a harder time and his <br/>
best friends keep moving away. He also wails loudly when hurt, physically <br/>
and emotionally, so I think people in our court are ignoring him when he <br/>
cries as a way to cope. He really wants to be listened too, which seems hard <br/>
for the friends we have here, mostly 7, 8, and 9 year olds.<br/>
<br/>
When you tell your kids you can not be mean and they continue to be mean, <br/>
what do you do? I have told my daughter the things you said Sandra about my <br/>
job is to protect all the people in the house from meanness, she doesn&#39;t <br/>
seem to get my seriousness. She keeps being mean. She is also a teaser, <br/>
which really frustrates the little ones. Just this morning Tessa ,who is 2, <br/>
asked for no kisses. Ashley kissed her 3 more times, so what did Tessa do, <br/>
she pinched her, hard, making Ashley cry. Tell me how you would handle this. <br/>
Ashley sets herself up all the time like this. Pushing to find peoples <br/>
limits. Her brother will tell her a story and she tells him he is wrong. <br/>
Ouch.<br/>
<br/>
Any more thoughts or mom ideas when dealing with respect would be helpful.<br/>
