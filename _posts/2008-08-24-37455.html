<div id="ygrps-yiv-196967716">My daughter has done much research about body piercings, and has over<br/>
the past 3 or 4 years done various piercings on herself. Most of them<br/>
I am just recently finding out about. She recently ordered a sterile<br/>
piercing needle and all that she needed to pierce her ear cartilege<br/>
today on her 16th birthday. <br/>
<br/>
Not only did I know about it this time, she invited me to watch and to<br/>
take pictures, which I did. As I mentioned, she is very knowledgeable<br/>
about how to pierce safely, and she is considering becoming a tattoo<br/>
artist or a surgeon.<br/>
<br/>
During her birthday party today, the conversation turned to piercings.<br/>
One of her friends asked her to pierce her belly button and my<br/>
daughter was all set to do this, when I said we needed to talk about<br/>
it first. The friend is 16, and legally old enough to get a piercing<br/>
done without her parents signature.<br/>
<br/>
I am ok with my daughter doing her own piercings, but I am not ok with<br/>
her doing piercings on other people. I don&#39;t know how to handle<br/>
this....help!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In a lot of states it is illegal to do without a liscence.  If the<br/>
parents don&#39;t know about it before hand and then find out that your<br/>
daughter did it with your consent, you could be in trouble legally. <br/>
Find out what the law is first.<br/>
<br/>
Then, if they are dead set to do it, tell them that you don&#39;t want any<br/>
part in it and to not let you in on it when and if they do go through<br/>
with it.  Like saying, &quot;go ahead, but don&#39;t make me an accomplice.&quot; <br/>
There are good reasons to have it done professionaly, maybe find and<br/>
share those reasons.</div>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your daughter sounds like she has done a responsible and admirable job in<br/>
learning how to pierce!<br/>
<br/>
I would find out the legal and health ramifications and give that<br/>
information to the girls.<br/>
<br/>
Then I would probably just go to my room and read. I don&#39;t think I would<br/>
condone or condemn the activity.<br/>
<br/>
If anything goes wrong, I may feel the need to contact the other person&#39;s<br/>
parents, depending on the situation.<br/>
<br/>
My teenagers have had parties where &quot;illegal&quot; things have happened. People<br/>
were safe, they slept here, no one drove, no one became ill, and I was<br/>
nearby if I was needed. I don&#39;t have issues with these things because my<br/>
kids are particularly responsible with their friends and their lives, and<br/>
they appear to regulate things themselves very well. They would not let<br/>
anyone get out of hand, would not allow anything at our house outside of<br/>
alcohol or pot, and themselves don&#39;t like to engage in much of either. These<br/>
are not rules that we have laid down, but the natural result of them having<br/>
freedom and information their whole lives. So far they have made good<br/>
decisions.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that I would not want to be liable for what other people&#39;s<br/>
kids do, and so I stay nearby but not part of any kid-parties here. If there<br/>
was a problem, I would get involved right away and my kids count on that<br/>
too! One time a young man arrived here very drunk. My son called me (I was 5<br/>
minutes away) and asked me to come home to help deal with it. I played the<br/>
heavy and told him I was uncomfortable with his condition like that at our<br/>
house and drove him home. I called his parents on the way to let them know<br/>
what happened, because in my thinking, he needed someone&#39;s attention, I<br/>
couldn&#39;t just drop him off somewhere, he needed to be watched. My kids were<br/>
very relieved. So far, that&#39;s the only situation where someone was unstable<br/>
and I thought my kids handled it well. AND, I was very glad they felt safe<br/>
and comfortable to call me in. They trust me too!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360344926">Some things go beyond unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If she wasn&#39;t old enough to have certain piercings done without  <br/>
parental permission, maybe she wasn&#39;t old enough to legally do them  <br/>
on herself, even with parental permission.  But it&#39;s kind of hard for  <br/>
the law to say anything once the hole&#39;s there.  What they could do,  <br/>
though, is consider that her parents were being negligent.<br/>
<br/>
Negligence or any lawbreaking is a special danger for unschoolers,  <br/>
because many state laws have their homeschooling laws worded in such  <br/>
ways that they expect you to be using a curriculum.  Some unschooling  <br/>
families would be able to stand in court and describe unschooling in  <br/>
schoolish ways and to justify what they&#39;re doing and why, quoting  <br/>
experts.  Many others (more and more as time goes by) could not.<br/>
<br/>
The best thing to do, then is to lie low until the kids are 18.  You  <br/>
might think I&#39;m not practicing that, because my name is on the  <br/>
internet and my kids&#39; names and photos.  But what I mean is I kept  <br/>
them in and quiet after 10:00 until they were old enough to be out  <br/>
later.  I help make sure they have licenses, insurance, IDs on them,  <br/>
that I know where they are and who they&#39;re with, and that they have a  <br/>
charged phone on them when they&#39;re out, that it&#39;s a place they can  <br/>
stay over if they need to, or that there&#39;s someone to drive them home  <br/>
if not (or that we could go and get them).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not paranoid about laws or lawbreaking, but neither am I reckless.<br/>
<br/>
The first &quot;kid party&quot; at our house where we had liquor out was last  <br/>
month, a combined birthday party for me and Kirby.  Everyone who was  <br/>
invited was told they could stay over if they got drunk.  We had LOTS  <br/>
of clean bedding and crash space.  And the vast majority of the  <br/>
attendees were over 21, too.  (Kirby&#39;s 22nd birthday, and most of his  <br/>
friends are older than he is.)<br/>
<br/>
Being an unschooler won&#39;t be a defense if another family gets angry  <br/>
that your daughter pierced their kid (regardless of infection or  <br/>
damage).<br/>
<br/>
And advise her not to charge ANYthing.  Even haircutting can&#39;t be  <br/>
done for money unless the person is licensed.<br/>
<br/>
My ears were pierced by a friend when I was a kid.  We read up and we  <br/>
were careful and there weren&#39;t problems.  As there come to be more  <br/>
and more laws, though, it&#39;s a good thing to help our kid be aware of  <br/>
the immediate dangers of lawbreaking and the possible secondary  <br/>
dangers to the legal peace and quiet of an unschooling family.<br/>
