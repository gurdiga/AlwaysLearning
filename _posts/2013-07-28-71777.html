Hello everybody! I decided I should probably mention to you guys about an opportunity my family and I decided to turn down. We were recently picked to be on a television series for an upcoming show on unschooling and free style parenting. It is going to be on Bravo, I&#39;m not sure when but, they were going to film us at our house (like the Duggers) for 7 days between mid August through the beginning of September.<br/>
It was suppose to be like an interview mostly showing just the parents telling about how they unschool. At the end of the show they wanted us to have a family relative to debate with, then we shake hands and part ways.<br/>
<br/>
The more we talked to the producer about it the more it sounded like a set up. It seems like they are trying to make unschooling parents look bad, and not only that it can ruin families relationships.<br/>
<br/>
She was going to pay us pretty good, (and we could really use that money) but no amount of money is worth that. She asked us typical questions a person may ask an unschool parent, and when we answered she rudely laughed to herself on some of them.<br/>
<br/>
The lady found me through a comment I made on YouTube about unschooling. Her name is Lande Yoosuf. She has produced lots of shows like 16 and pregnant,and what not to wear. This one is going to be made through punched in the head productions. I know there is no way to stop the show, but if she contacts you...well you can look up the production company, see her long list of shows she has made, it just doesn&#39;t seem like a good deal to me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-594530838">Yes they have been scouting the Unschooling_Gamers group but I have not let the messages and did not approve them as members.<br/>
There was that name and another one from the same agency/studio/production company.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836081745">I am wondering who they will end up with! Most of the unschoolers I know are<br/>
too savvy to fall for this type of scam and do NOT want their family life<br/>
offered under the microscope of television. I saw warnings on Facebook about<br/>
this person scouting for families to exhibit on a reality show. Several<br/>
friends said to watch out and just say no. So if the more prominent<br/>
unschooling families (the ones who are active on blogs, Facebook, yahoo<br/>
groups) won&#39;t go on TV, who will they end up with?! Some newer to<br/>
unschooling family who may see the money and perhaps fame as a draw? They<br/>
may not be the best representation of unschooling, if there is a GOOD way to<br/>
show unschooling on TV (debatable). So yippee, unschooling ends up looking<br/>
like some fringe wacko cult?! I guess all we can do is hope for the best.<br/>
And keep spreading this information so people are aware of the damage it can<br/>
do!<br/>
