<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075127159">I would like to be a<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; strength to my friend, <br/>
&gt; rather than the low spot in her wall where all the potential<br/>
&gt; for trying again <br/>
&gt; to homeschool and to parent to suit her husband just floods<br/>
&gt; out.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Be a stand for your friend, Be a stand for a safe place for<br/>
her. Listen to her. Have her document every horrible, terrible<br/>
juvenile thing he does.  <br/>
<br/>
You say he does little things not big ones. Little things add<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
You and your husband could document incidents that you see<br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
Listen to the children, really let them know that they are<br/>
special and deserve to be loved.<br/>
<br/>
Peace and Love in...<br/>
