&lt;&lt; Sandra, hope you and your&#39;n are not in harm&#39;s way! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about ten miles from me, maybe eight, as it was moving north.  <br/>
<br/>
We saw the smoke not long after it started, on Tuesday afternoon.  It was <br/>
kinda neat looking, like clouds coming out of the ground, because of it being <br/>
(relative to other things around here) something really clean burning.  Trees and <br/>
right by the river, the smoke was white, and not black and roiling like when <br/>
a business or a house is on fire.<br/>
<br/>
Local news was doing continuous coverage last night.<br/>
<br/>
It was handled by the local fire department instead of the forestry guys, I <br/>
think mostly because the forestry guys were all busy elsewhere.  And it being <br/>
right between the river and an irrigation canal, they had LOTS of water.  It <br/>
was put out all with water, and not chemicals.  <br/>

<br/>
At 9:00 or so this morning, there were hot spots but no full-on flames and <br/>
smoke.  That might have changed.  I haven&#39;t looked at the news since then.<br/>
<br/>
It was might scary last night!<br/>
<br/>
They showed a house all in full flame on the news last night, but nobody was <br/>
living there.  It was under construction.  I don&#39;t know how far past frame it <br/>
was, but it didn&#39;t have all the everything yet.<br/>
<br/>
Where that is on the river, the houses on the west side are up pretty  high <br/>
on a bluff, not right at river level, and  on the east side, there&#39;s a fairly <br/>
big levee and overflow/irrigation canal between that and houses, many of which <br/>
have fields and orchards between their houses and the river.  So it wasn&#39;t <br/>
like the Los Alamos fire a few years back which was right in an among residences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-655802553">There are more fires tonight.  Again, not near Sandra, but literally a mile or two down the road from our house. We can see the glow from our front yard -- our neighbor was one of the first to call it in at 8:30.  We had just been at the park, Andy & I biked home while Gary and Dan drove back.  We saw no smoke at 8:25, but the neighbor called moments later to tell us -- the smoke was incredible!  Since it began after dark, there is no air support available to fight it.  The wildlands fire crews have gone in to fight it on the ground, with the objective of protecting homes, allowing the bosque (riverside woods) to burn.  With the expected wind change at midnight, it will be blowing smoke into my neighborhood at 35mph.  They&#39;ve evacuated homes across the river -- we live on the west side, about 2mi from the river -- and some business and apartments within one mile of us.  Most of yesterday&#39;s evacuations were about air quality, not fire danger, so I&#39;m more than half expecting we may be<br/>
 evacuated tonight some time -- and they&#39;ve talked about planned, preventive power outages since smoke adversely affects power lines and transformers.  <br/>
 <br/>
the worst part?  It appears to be arson, with two separate points of origin, burning on both sides of the river......<br/>
