<div id="ygrps-yiv-511506363">There are no free eyeglasses. Not even at Target.<br/>

I&#39;ve stopped one moderated post that said to please pass on the  <br/>
information that Target was promoting their optical department and  <br/>
offering free glasses to children 12 and under for a limited time.<br/>
<br/>
So you may see that announcement on other lists. PLEASE don&#39;t pass it  <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
If you see a too-good-to-be-true offer, Google it before passing it  <br/>
on to someone else. Or check directly at Snopes. It only takes a  <br/>
minute to investigate. -- It&#39;s a good life skill to model for you  <br/>
kids! -- And saves hours of time for other people.<br/>

<br/>
And even if there were, this list isn&#39;t a &quot;write about whatever in the  <br/>
world you want to&quot; list.<br/>
And even if this list were that, it&#39;s an international list and not  <br/>
everyone even knows what &quot;Target&quot; is.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Joyce.  Even though I was up very early today, you&#39;re still  <br/>
closer to the morning sun than I am in New Mexico (temporally  <br/>
speaking, not elevationally speaking).<br/>
<br/>
There is a chat today.   Times are here:<br/>

Typical upcoming day of an unschooled teen (Holly):<br/>
<br/>
Doctor&#39;s appointment in the morning, checkup, birth control pill  <br/>
renewal (yeah, that&#39;s right; I said it)<br/>
Working at the flower shop, today she&#39;s on phone and front counter.<br/>
Tonight she and Brett and going to an Isotopes game (baseball) with  <br/>
two friends of Brett&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
Most kids her age will be in school today and have homework tonight.<br/>
Some of the girls her age can&#39;t talk to their moms about their  <br/>
possible need for birth control, and the moms wouldn&#39;t go with them to  <br/>
the doctor.<br/>
