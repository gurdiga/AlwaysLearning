<div id="ygrps-yiv-518390707">A new client in Virginia has homeschooled for one year, with materials and testing. Now she would like unschool but doesn&#39;t know how to make that change legally. Is there someone in Virginia who can give me some recommendations?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

This list isn&#39;t really intended for local business or laws or meet- <br/>
ups.  (This is the second very-regional post in the past several  <br/>
house, so it&#39;s not just one.)<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s an exception:<br/>
<br/>
If information is included that contributes to a topic and you want to  <br/>
say at the end that you&#39;ll be at Legoland, that&#39;s fine.  If someone  <br/>
asks a question that would be worth discussing on the list--a general  <br/>
or philosophical question, not about local laws--then saying &quot;and I&#39;m  <br/>
in Texas, and can&#39;t find other people around Austin&quot; would be fine.  <br/>
People could provide that information on the side.<br/>
<br/>
 From the list description:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a list for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling  <br/>
and attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based  <br/>
on the principles underlying unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Always Learning will focus on how people learn no matter where in the  <br/>
world they are, rather than on what&#39;s legal in any particular country  <br/>
or jurisdiction.<br/>
<br/>
