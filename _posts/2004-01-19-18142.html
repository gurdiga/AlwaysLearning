<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187549725">My name is Kathy and I am the mom to James 10, Jacob 5, and Joshua <br/>
3.  We live in Western NY near Niagara Falls.  We started <br/>
homeschooling in November of this past year out of necessity.  I <br/>
quickly bought a curriculum and &quot;did school&quot;  for the first month.  <br/>
After second guessing our decision, I did some poking around into <br/>
unschooling and viola, I found my home.  After an email to Sandra <br/>
Dodd (thanks Sandra) I decided that this way of life was for us.  I <br/>
am now at peace with my decision to unschool because it just makes <br/>
sense.  I immediately bought learning all the time and the day I got <br/>
it, sat on the couch curled up as if I was in the midst of a great <br/>
novel.  I read that book cover to cover and that book lit a fire <br/>
inside me with such passion that I have never known.  And I am a <br/>
passionate person... <br/>
<br/>
I found this group through Sandra and have been pouring over the <br/>
threads to find comfort in my decision.  I dare not tell a soul (or <br/>
at least that is how I feel) because I do not want to argue my <br/>
decision.  Most people can&#39;t even imagine letting go of their <br/>
children and &quot;trusting them&quot;?  Most people I know don&#39;t trust their <br/>
children, they see them as people who do whatever it takes to get <br/>
their way.  I can&#39;t say I ever really distrusted my boys, but I <br/>
always felt as if I knew what was best for them.  I now know that <br/>
while I do know some things about &quot;life&quot; that they don&#39;t know, and <br/>
my experiences will help to keep them safe, they ultimately know <br/>
what they want and need and I trust that due to their natural <br/>
curiosity, they will be poking around for a lifetime.  <br/>
<br/>
Since my decision, I have felt the insatiable desire to &quot;get to know <br/>
my kids&quot;.  Not to say that I don&#39;t know them already, but a lot of <br/>
times I know they tell me what they think I want to hear.  Just as <br/>
they did in school to the teacher.  I have tried to wipe our slate <br/>
clean and let them feel safe to tell me what they think I don&#39;t want <br/>
to hear.  Since last week, I have had 3 in depth conversations with <br/>
my 10 year old that have told me things about him I never knew.  He <br/>
can hold conversations like a 30 year old.  I think all children are <br/>
wise beyond their years so to speak and the only reason most people <br/>
don&#39;t know that about their children is that the kids are afraid to <br/>
let it out.  Afraid of the judgment that will meet them.  Children <br/>
learn it is easier to say nothing than to constantly be told why <br/>
they shouldn&#39;t feel, think, or act a certain way.  <br/>
<br/>
I will take this day by and day and try to just &quot;shut up and <br/>
listen&quot;.  Shut up and listen to the pitter patter of running, the <br/>
laughter, the amazement in their eyes when they accomplish something <br/>
on their own, the joy in their hearts after telling me all about <br/>
something that they feel real passionately about. Just as I would <br/>
like that someone would listen to me when I feel passionately about <br/>
something.  Our passion, although different are ultimately the same <br/>
emotion, not stronger because I am an adult, but the same emotion.  <br/>
Theirs is not to be undervalued for their age or size.  I will stop <br/>
myself from always butting in their sibling disagreements with the <br/>
trust that they will somehow figure out how to keep the peace <br/>
themselves and when they do, will feel satisfied that they did it on <br/>
their own.  I will work hard every day to not correct them when <br/>
their counting is not in the order I would count in, or when they <br/>
tell me that it is hot when I know it is cold, or blue when I know <br/>
it is black.  I will trust that they will figure it out for <br/>
themselves eventually.  I will trust that if they are spending all <br/>
day on a particular game that tomorrow they may or may not do it <br/>
again, but they will have a lot to tell me about regardless.  <br/>
<br/>
While it won&#39;t be an easy task for me, the somewhat controlling, <br/>
always involved mother that I have been for the past 10 years <br/>
because that is what I thought I was &quot;supposed&quot; to be doing.  I feel <br/>
that it is a worthwhile achievement to work towards everyday so <br/>
someday when my kids are grow up and moved on to families of their <br/>
own they will look back and say &quot;No, my mom didn&#39;t tell us what to <br/>
do, when to do it, where to do it, whom to do it with, she never <br/>
interfered with our hopes and dreams, but she was always there.<br/>
Always opening the door for us and trusting that we would find on <br/>
the other side of the door something amazing or not.  And that was <br/>
okay with her&quot;!<br/>
<br/>
One of my dear friends who has 14 and 19 year old boys got the best <br/>
Christmas gift that anyone could have given her this year.  It <br/>
something you can&#39;t buy, because it is priceless.  Each in their own <br/>
way wrote down why &quot;my mom&quot; is the best.  The 14 year old did the <br/>
top 10 reasons why my mom is the best and the 19 year old did the <br/>
ABC&#39;s of my mom.  Both were equally touching and after she finished <br/>
reading them to me, I admit that I had to reach for the box of <br/>
tissues.  I believe I was crying because I wasn&#39;t sure up to this <br/>
point that my children could possibly say any of those great things <br/>
about me.   I decided that someday I hope that my children would <br/>
have these feelings about me and their childhood and want me to <br/>
know.  So I decided what I wanted them to write about me when they <br/>
are older and now I am going to work hard to make sure they can.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for listening to my passionate ramblings.  Have a <br/>
great day!<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I would especially appreciate any contact from anyone in this <br/>
area that I could do things with.  I belong to the area <br/>
homeschoolers but don&#39;t find their are many unschoolers there.  <br/>
Although that may not be the case.</div>

Maybe you&#39;ve found this already, but one of my favorite ideas and essays is <br/>
&quot;Leaning on a Truck,&quot; about how easy it is to talk if you&#39;re not making eye <br/>
contact and &quot;having a talk.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It might help for you to tell them stories about when you were their age, or <br/>
about things you used to think were true or might be possible, and what you <br/>
think about them now.    Those things seem to always turn into good <br/>
conversations here.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Thank you all for listening to my passionate ramblings. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It was mushy (but sweet &lt;g&gt;) reading.   <br/>
Thank you for writing it and sharing it here!<br/>
<br/>
