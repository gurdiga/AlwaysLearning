<div id="ygrps-yiv-476206937">On a Virginia homeschooling list a mom recently reported that her active <br/>
boys enjoyed using a table loom while she read to them.  She bought the <br/>
loom from this site  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.harrisville.com/html/friendlyloompdts.html">http://www.harrisville.com/html/friendlyloompdts.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Other Virginia folks, including a few really talented ones who weave <br/>
beautiful things to sell,  joined in to share their own weaving <br/>
explorations.  Kinda makes me want to try it too.  We&#39;ve been weaving <br/>
potholders and my sons have made dozens in all colors for gifts.  &#92;<br/>
<br/>
In Maryland there is an annual &quot;Sheep to Shawl&quot; competition/festival <br/>
that&#39;s been getting bigger each year.  <br/>

&gt; I figured quilting out of already-made cloth, fine; crocheting <br/>
&gt; afghans, okay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But really, weaving? </span></blockquote></div>
