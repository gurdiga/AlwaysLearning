&gt; like the one with Anthony Andrews and Jane Seymor the best. The book is good <br/>
&gt; but I like the movie better. :)   -=-<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am SO glad you stirred this topic, because I meant to come and post that in <br/>
the current flyer for Greathall Productions (Jim Weiss&#39;s company--he&#39;s a <br/>
storyteller, and has started making audio books too), there&#39;s a listing for &quot;In <br/>
the Reign of Terror, a book by G.A. Henty.   We have &quot;Wulf the Saxon,&quot; of that <br/>
series, and it&#39;s good.   I listened to it while sewing medieval clothes for <br/>
Christmas gifts last year, and then Marty listened to it at his book-making job.  <br/>
  <br/>
<br/>
In the Reign of Terror   is $32.95 for a 7-CD set.   It&#39;s nine hours long, <br/>
and more details are here:<br/>
(the website lists the price as $29.65--I don&#39;t know what to say about <br/>
that...)<br/>
