<div id="ygrps-yiv-1997744610">&quot;My husband&#39;s sister told me she felt very sorry for Americans because we <br/>
live such isolated lifestyles - each separated into our own houses - <br/>
doing our housework alone, cooking alone, eating with just our immediate <br/>
family, not friends and neighbors and extended family, all the time.&quot;<br/>
The interesting thing about communal living is that in most other societies that is the way they live.  It can be such a wonderful experience and usually isn&#39;t the hippie experience we picture when we think communal.  I live in Costa Rica and there is an incredible sense of family togetherness that you do not usually see in the US.  I also feel that is sad.  People here take care of one another, watch out for one another, and have a real community.  They stay home after turning 18, and they care for their elderly!  It is one of the things I love most about living here.  Although I also agree that living under one roof with many families would bring about many unintended consequences.  As a home/un schooler I feel that it has many benefits and you still are 1 family living out in the real world, just with added experiences from a host of other people, who happen to live very nearby;)<br/>
