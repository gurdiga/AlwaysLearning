<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816809244">Most of the Japanese ideograms were borrowed fm the China. Budist<br/>
monge &quot;robbed&quot; (copied Budda&#39;s teaching and snicked into Japan).<br/>
Today many Japanese ideograms are different fm the Chinese ones<br/>
because the &quot;revolution&quot; have simplyfied the ideograms there.<br/>
<br/>
As for the brushes, I would suggest going to bookstores/or any<br/>
Japanese school and buying the brush-caligraph-kit for school<br/>
children.  Chinese/Japanese goods shops also might have them.  At<br/>
least in San Jose, San Francisco, CA, I have seen them.<br/>
<br/>
I do not know much about Chinese ideograms.  I would suggest<br/>
posting to our HP <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org">http://www.homeschoolinginjapan.org</a> .  There<br/>
are some members that are bilingual English/Chinese and they<br/>
might have more clues.<br/>
<br/>
Deb, I am glad for Dylan!  What a boy and what a family!  Someday<br/>
our children might meet and then...will they speak in English or<br/>
in Japanese?  Portuguese, who knows!<br/>
.............<br/>
<br/>
The weekend we spent with Tokyo Homeschoolers Network (one<br/>
Japanese unschoolers group).  It was an overnight event so that<br/>
families could share experiences.  As weekday socialization do<br/>
not normally happen here in Japan (most houses are too small to<br/>
have visitors, life here is relied heavily on train<br/>
transportation that usually run fm 5 AM to 0.30AM, long working<br/>
hours...etc), our family had, for the first time, the opportunity<br/>
to meet others unschooling families. 17 people ranging fm 2 1/2<br/>
yo to 66 yo were there.<br/>
<br/>
One of the disvantage of hs in Tokyo is that any place we want to<br/>
go, we have to take trains.  It is good that we don&#39;t have to pay<br/>
for the maintenace of a car, which is costly here, but for any<br/>
outings, events even to reach another unschooler&#39;s family take us<br/>
at least an hour (that not counting the time to change clothes,<br/>
to walk to the station, wait for the train...)<br/>
<br/>
There it was said that most of the Japanese hs are unschoolers by<br/>
its natural course.  The families go for the hs option because<br/>
they could make the child stay at the ps. And as the children are<br/>
fed up with  schooling, there is no other option than<br/>
de-schooling, then unschooling are found that works.<br/>
<br/>
Second, I was saying that since I began hs dd 3 years ago, I have<br/>
been looking for hs in Brazil and that I found none. One of the<br/>
members said; &quot;hs is an alternative for too much schooling. South<br/>
Hemisphere children are not yet praged by it.&quot;</div>
