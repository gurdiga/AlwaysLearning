<div id="ygrps-yiv-146029248">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
This list has been quiet lately... I went to the hairdressers yesterday and<br/>
while waiting decided to read a magazine.  There was an article in there<br/>
about Michael Essany.  He&#39;s 20 years old and has been putting on a nighttime<br/>
talk show (like Leno or Letterman) from his living room with his mum and<br/>
dads&#39; help for a couple of years.  He&#39;s in college now and Leeza Gibbons<br/>
(Hollywood person) got to hear about him and the cable station &quot;E&quot; are doing<br/>
a documentary on his for 13 weeks as to how he puts his show together.  <br/>
<br/>
As I was reading the article I was thinking to myself &quot;wow what an<br/>
innovative kid he must have been to know he wanted to do this and to pursue<br/>
it&quot;.... I read a little further in the magazine and it turns out he&#39;s<br/>
homeschooled.... Yipeeeeeeeeeeee!!!  I don&#39;t know that he was unschooled<br/>
because of course the press doesn&#39;t spend much time differentiating.  They<br/>
said his mother now 52 quit her job to homeschool her son... I was just<br/>
saying to my DH &quot;why does the press seem to have to make it sound like she<br/>
quit her job, bought a blackboard, a piece of chalk and some text books and<br/>
that&#39;s how he learned?&quot;...  <br/>
<br/>
Have any of your seen articles in the main stream press about unschooling?<br/>

&lt;&lt; Have any of your seen articles in the main stream press about unschooling?<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Mentions that a couple of the spelling bee winners a couple of years ago were <br/>
unschooled, but they didn&#39;t use that term.<br/>
<br/>
I read about that talk-show kid too, but the article I read didn&#39;t mention <br/>
the homeschooling.  Cool!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-965495751">A month or so ago I read an article from an Oregon newspaper, I think,<br/>
which mentioned unschooling.   It was about the publisher of All Round<br/>
magazine and made mention of Grace Llewellyn&#39;s Not Back To School camp.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t in the news much.  <br/>
<br/>
You can search Google news for unschooling and once in a while you might<br/>
find something.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-513322060">My family and I saw Michael Essany on Oprah a month or so ago, homeschooling <br/>
was never mentioned on her show. Then, flipping through channels one night, <br/>
we saw his show being previewed on E. Luckily, it was coming up next, so we <br/>
decided to watch it. He had Kelley Rowland (singer from Destiny&#39;s Child, who <br/>
recently put out her solo debut which my children bought immediately and <br/>
learned every word to every song) on his night show. It was great watching <br/>
this kid and his go-get-em style. Not five minutes into it though, my hubby <br/>
looked at me and stated, &quot;This kid had to be homeschooled! I wonder if they <br/>
unschooled.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I was suprised that the statement came from him first as I hadn&#39;t even <br/>
thought about it much. I don&#39;t know why, perhaps because I spend a couple <br/>
more hours a day with the kids; but then again he has always supported and <br/>
understood unschooling from the day I took them out of school and gleefully <br/>
said we weren&#39;t ever doing &quot;curriculum&quot; again. I initially thought he might <br/>
be worried, but if he was, he never said so, only that he trusted me and knew <br/>
our kids well enough to trust them too. It is funny though because when they <br/>
are moody or bickering he threatens school at home and quickly they snap out <br/>
of it. LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, just my 2 cents and an elated mom with a hubby that &quot;gets it&quot;.<br/>

of us. The fact is no matter what they did would he ever consider &quot;school at <br/>
home&quot;, but rather that they are very lucky and sometimes forget how stiffling <br/>
life used to be when they &quot;did&quot; school, therefore, they truly have little to <br/>
bicker about.<br/>

<br/>
Perhaps I wasn&#39;t clear in that dear hubby is &quot;threatening&quot; retorically <br/>
speaking. Therefore, the LEAP to he doesn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot; is far too quick to <br/>
judgement. But then again I was simply responding to the fact that Michael <br/>
Essany was homeschooled and we wondered as a faimly if he was unschooled. <br/>
Hopefully I have clarified my &quot;threating&quot; statement.<br/>
