On March 29, 2008 at 8 p.m., join millions of people around the world in<br/>
making a statement about climate change by turning off your lights for Earth<br/>
Hour, an event created by the World Wildlife Fund &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wwfus.org/">http://www.wwfus.org/</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
Earth Hour was created by WWF in Sydney, Australia in 2007, and in one year<br/>
has grown from an event in one city to a global movement. In 2008, millions<br/>
of people, businesses, governments and civic organizations in nearly 200<br/>
cities around the globe will turn out for Earth Hour. More than 100 cities<br/>
across North America will participate, including the US flagships�Atlanta,<br/>
Chicago, Phoenix and San Francisco and Ottawa, Montreal, Toronto and<br/>
Vancouver &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://wwf.ca/earthhour/">http://wwf.ca/earthhour/</a>&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
We invite everyone throughout North America and around the world to turn off<br/>
the lights for an hour starting at 8 p.m. (your own local time)�whether at<br/>
home or at work, with friends and family or solo, in a big city or a small<br/>
town.<br/>
<br/>
What will you do when the lights are off? We have lots of<br/>
ideas&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.earthhour.org/earth-hour-every-day">http://www.earthhour.org/earth-hour-every-day</a>&gt;.<br/>

and want to play a part in helping to fight climate change. Don&#39;t forget to<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038244287">Y&#39;know in Hairspray when Tracy is asked what she would do if she were  <br/>
president?  She said &quot;I&#39;d  make every day Negro day!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s just make every hour Earth hour and not discuss it on the list,  <br/>
please.  There are lots of such events, but they&#39;re not about  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
