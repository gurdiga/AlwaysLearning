<div id="ygrps-yiv-1858115737">I met a really wonderful woman last night who desperately wants to homeschool her three children.  She is still researching methods.  The biggest obsticle is that she is single and the sole breadwinner of the family.  She has no support from family or friends.  Does anyone have some advice I could give her?  <br/>
   <br/>
  Thank you,<br/>
