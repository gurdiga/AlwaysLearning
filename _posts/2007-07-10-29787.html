This has been an interesting and challenging thread.<br/>
It would be interesting to make a summary directory of all the things <br/>
people have and do worship.<br/>
<br/>
Missing among the responses, unless I missed it, was respect for &quot;the <br/>
awe, wonder, and mystery of the cosmos.&quot;<br/>
This was, of course, the belief of Einstein, Russell, and many other <br/>
scholars.<br/>
<br/>
Gaia (The Earth and all of it&#39;s life forms) has become almost a <br/>
religion to many secular thinkers.<br/>
I&#39;ve often thought it would creative to develop a Gaian Creed and <br/>
create a Gaian religion with ceremonies, not unlike some of the pagan <br/>
celebrations, or those of the Pueblo Indians.  A place to meet and <br/>
regular meeting times could provide some of the valuable and creative <br/>
qualities that draw people to other religions.<br/>
<br/>
Now that we&#39;ve listed a lot of the options for religion perhaps it <br/>
would be enlightening create more options.<br/>
What are YOUR thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
IMHO<br/>

<br/>
Holly&#39;s question was about the creation of  more options.  She was  <br/>
wondering, if there is an instinctive urge in people to create  <br/>
heirarchies and causes and to ponder creation and eternity, what else  <br/>
is instinctive?<br/>
<br/>
Creativity wouldn&#39;t be helpful, in answering her question.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to discuss it above and beyond that, though, go for  <br/>
it; just know that it&#39;s a whole new question now.<br/>
<br/>
Rastafarians...  Are they worshipping freedom?  Creativity?  Reggae?   <br/>
Marijuana?<br/>
<br/>
I have known people (some very well) who base every life&#39;s decision  <br/>
on money, on profit, on &quot;productivity.&quot;  Are they worshipping money,  <br/>
or are they just being overly-competitive?  I&#39;m not sure.  But they  <br/>
have set an ideal and they live to strive to move toward it in every  <br/>
way.  Then they die with fat bank accounts.<br/>

<br/>
This probably does tie in to the topic (which was Jung, though I  <br/>
didn&#39;t mention the name; sorry) of Holly&#39;s question and what people  <br/>
have inborn, in the way of religion-preparedness.  It&#39;s sun worship  <br/>
plus science.<br/>
