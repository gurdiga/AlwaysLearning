School&#39;s nearly out for the summer, so the teacher asks which of her  <br/>
second-graders will be back next year. Everyone is returning except  <br/>
for Zach Van Benthusen....<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ve written to and have replies from one of the authors of Laurel&#39;s Kitchen <br/>
Bread Book and from the woman who does the For Better or Worse comic strip.<br/>
<br/>
I also have Jack Lemon&#39;s autograph (~1978), but don&#39;t have any way to prove <br/>
that it really is his.<br/>
