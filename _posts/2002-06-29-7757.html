<div id="ygrps-yiv-1377846423">Well, our 3 week camping trip turned into a one week trip :-(.<br/>
Daughter (10) managed to fall and break her arm when we were in Canada<br/>
(guess where my health insurance doesn&#39;t cover.....). Although the<br/>
Canadian hospital plastered it we needed to come home and get it<br/>
x-rayed properly plus camping in the Adirondacks wouldn&#39;t have been<br/>
fun without swimming. We did see the Fingerlakes in NY and Niagara<br/>
Falls so it was worth it.<br/>
Mind you, the temps soared into the high 90&#39;s which makes being a<br/>
tourist hard work! My tent also doesn&#39;t have air-conditioning.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to go back in September when its a bit cooler.<br/>
