I just dont know how people do it, to be honest. I cant keep my house dust free, and I dont even know if I really want to at this point. lol. But that being said, do any of you follow any kind of cleaning regimn? We just cant , were so busy and moving and grooving, that when were home, I just wanna be home, not cleaning it. I do the dishes and try to throw a load of laundry in through the day..but other then that...I also clean a room when I feel moved lol. Maybe I am just anti cleaning ...I dont know. The kids also are amazing at putting away their things, which I am truly blessed for..but what about the deep cleaning like tha under the stove stuff lol. Do you guys choose a day and just go nuts?<br/>
looking forward to discussing this. <br/>
Brightest Blessings<br/>

I wait until it matters, or the stove has to be moved anyway.<br/>
<br/>
My house has been increasingly cleaner as my kids have gotten older.<br/>
Sometimes when I worried about it, I thought of people having lived in sod houses, or cabins with dirt floors.  :-)<br/>

My mental well-being requires a reasonable amount of tidiness. I can&#39;t stand dirt or clutter. With that said, I can&#39;t organize a closet for the life of me, so please don&#39;t look!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve used a semi- fly lady approach for about 15 years. Things changed when I had children. Mine are still young, 2 and 4. It&#39;s been hard, but we&#39;ve found some balance. I do have high standards in certain rooms, and I&#39;m trying to cultivate a neat and clean habit in my kids so it just seems natural to them.<br/>
<br/>
Check out the fly lady. 30 minutes a day maintenance is possible.<br/>
<br/>
I do take out my stove every few months, as I do the frig. I try to deep clean one room  a month, on rotation. I usually do this when the kids are busy with their dad and want nothing to do with me.<br/>
