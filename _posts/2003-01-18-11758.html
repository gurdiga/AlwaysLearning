&gt; <br/>
&gt; I really enjoy homeschooling the kids.  Today I was<br/>
&gt; cleaning out my purse and found some state quarters so<br/>
&gt; we got out the state quarter books to see which ones<br/>
&gt; we needed which led to me getting out the lincoln<br/>
&gt; penny book to see if we needed any of the pennies we<br/>
&gt; found, which led to me getting the bag of $2 bills, $1<br/>
&gt; coins, etc. out and found money from Scotland from<br/>
&gt; when my husband was stationed over there and I decided<br/>
&gt; that we should do sort of a unit study and get<br/>
&gt; currency from as many countries as we can and compare<br/>
&gt; to values to US currency.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I feel so blessed that we live in a time that this is<br/>
&gt; so widely accepted (with the exception of<br/>
&gt; closed-minded people like my in-laws and some of my<br/>
&gt; closer relatives who believe that all children should<br/>
&gt; be in &quot;school&quot;)  I feel even more blessed that we have<br/>
&gt; &quot;unschooling&quot; because my children fight me on anything<br/>
&gt; that resembles &quot;school&quot;.<br/>
