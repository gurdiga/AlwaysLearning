<div id="ygrps-yiv-1121199739">Thanks everyone for pointing me in the direction on how to learn webpage <br/>
design. I checked out AOL press but I&#39;m not sure if I can download it using <br/>
Windows XP. So I think I&#39;ll start with BN University. Then take it from <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
I have another question though if I may. Barnes and Noble University has a <br/>
prerequiste for their &#39;How to Build Your first Web Site&#39; class. Could anyone <br/>
tell me how to do  #2 &  # 3? <br/>
<br/>
The prerequisites are:<br/>
<br/>
1) An understanding of how to navigate and search the web. (This I can do.)<br/>
<br/>
2) An understanding of how to download files from the web. (I can download <br/>
fine but  sometimes I can&#39;t find out where they went to or can&#39;t open them. <br/>
Help here would be appreciated.) <br/>
<br/>
3) An understanding of how to copy, delete, and rename files on your <br/>
computer. (This is where I need the most help. I don&#39;t know how to do this.)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again everyone!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If you use Netscape and use Smart Download, it will ask you where you want <br/>
the files put.  I just decide on a folder where all downloads should go and <br/>
put them there.  You can put them into My Downloads or Temp or make a <br/>
folder called New.  You can download Winzip or another program that will <br/>
unzip them.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If you&#39;re using a Windoze system, go into Windows Explorer.  You can do <br/>
that from the Start button, or just press the windows key (between ctrl and <br/>
alt) at the same time as E.  Once there, it&#39;s easy to navigate to the files <br/>
you want to work with.  To copy, delete, or rename, just put the cursor on <br/>
the file and right click.  You&#39;ll get a menu that includes all those.  If <br/>
you click on rename, it will put a box around the file, and you just type <br/>
in the new name and press enter.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the Barnes and Noble course, there are *tons* of sites that <br/>
teach web page design.  If you search on &quot;web page design&quot;, you&#39;ll probably <br/>
find lots.  Another way to learn is to view the source code of pages you <br/>
like.  Click on view and then source.  You&#39;ll see all the html code.  Try <br/>
to figure out how they&#39;ve done stuff that way.  It&#39;s the way most of the <br/>
young net geeks learned.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
