<div id="ygrps-yiv-831961293">I had a long talk with my sister today about my new interest and <br/>
flat-out excitement in unschooling and how I&#39;m applying it to our lives <br/>
and the changes we&#39;ve been making.  She brought up the family&#39;s concerns <br/>
about the fact that I won&#39;t listen to their concerns.  I admitted that I <br/>
can get very defensive when I feel picked on, but agreed to listen to <br/>
what they had to say.   I&#39;ll have to let you know how that goes, but I&#39;m <br/>
sure you&#39;ve all been there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we talked for over two hours on the phone tonight and I have <br/>
such a great friend in her.  She raised a lot of food for thought in a <br/>
purely discussional, &quot;look at all the angles&quot; way.  And she really <br/>
listened.  She wants to read the books I&#39;ve bought, too.  I&#39;m so eager <br/>
to share them with someone else.  But she did come up with a good <br/>
question that I&#39;d like to ask all of you.  It has to do with how <br/>
different personality types could unschool.  <br/>
<br/>
I am a very type b personality (yes, I really do hate typecasting, but <br/>
it fits me mostly).  I hate to rush, I&#39;ve always been very creative, <br/>
artistic, yada yada yada.  That&#39;s me.  She is type a, hyper, has taken <br/>
Prozac to calm down, huge career-woman, thrives on schedules and <br/>
predictability.  That&#39;s her.  She makes lots of money.  I make none. <br/>
 So...I come across unschooling and decide it&#39;s the best thing since <br/>
sliced bread and jump off the high board.  It suits me so much.  It <br/>
makes sense to me.  She&#39;s wondering how someone like her could unschool <br/>
successfully.  Is it possible?  She says it&#39;s fascinating, but someone <br/>
like her just couldn&#39;t do it.  What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
Another part to this question is this...I have four dd&#39;s.  It is <br/>
starting to become apparent that my second (who shares a birthday with <br/>
my sister) is also someone who needs predictability and order.  In fact <br/>
these last 6 months of unschooling completely have caused her to become <br/>
more and more insecure with many, many fits of clinging and crying. <br/>
 She&#39;s 5, by the way.  The oldest dd and the 3rd dd are taking things <br/>
right in stride.  4th - only 6 mnths, so she&#39;s cool with it.  Anyway, <br/>
any suggestions on how to work this so everyone&#39;s getting what they <br/>
need?  How can I have a daily routine and schedule for one child and not <br/>
the others, too?<br/>
<br/>
One last question...my sister said a friend who&#39;d worked in social <br/>
services for many years told her that if I&#39;m not careful, &quot;they&quot; could <br/>
take my kids away from me and file a criminal report against me for <br/>
child neglect if it is decided that my children aren&#39;t up to par with <br/>
&quot;the norm.&quot;  I&#39;d like to think this is just a scare tactic to keep <br/>
people like us in line with the rest.  But could this happen?  Do any of <br/>
you know anyone this has happened to?  To be honest, it did scare me. <br/>
 Not enough to stop, but enough to pause and ask all of you anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, I&#39;d appreciate it if you all would let me know what you think. <br/>
 Have a GREAT day tomorrow...or later today, I guess.  Perhaps it&#39;s time <br/>
I got some sleep.   Night.  HeidiC.</div>

ex-husband, a crazed mother-in-law, or jealous neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the first two, they were matters of custody <br/>
negotiations/visitation/scheduling.<br/>
In the latter, neighbor case, if the house isn&#39;t a dump, kids are healthy and <br/>
there&#39;s food and a car running, that&#39;s pretty easily handled (in the cases of <br/>
which I&#39;m thinking).<br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t think it would be taking them away, in any case, but maybe <br/>
pressure to put them in school.   Sometimes in divorces kids are court ordered to go <br/>
to school.  Homeschooling can lose just like dads used to lose.  School has <br/>
become the modern mom (in a sad way, in divorces).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Heidi, <br/>
<br/>
Please add me to the above list, although I have never met them in person. <br/>
But I am far, far, far away from being type B. I think sometimes I can even <br/>
scare off a type A.  I don&#39;t think it makes a difference in what pigeon hole <br/>
someone out there stuck you in, unschooling works regardless of personlity type. I <br/>
think it in fact, is so much easier to mold to one&#39;s personality, rather than <br/>
trying to stick square pegs in round holes. Learning is so much more condusive <br/>
when you are able to be you, regardless of personaily traits.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck and even if your family doesn&#39;t get it, all that matters is that <br/>
you and yours do.<br/>
<br/>
Rhonda - who just found out it takes 4 days to get to South Carolina from <br/>
Cali via the train. Yikes! I guess I will look up flying.<br/>

unschool.<br/>
<br/>
The woman who came to mind when you described your sister organized<br/>
activities each Friday for homeschoolers, and was mega-involved in outide<br/>
activities. She organized the town fair. She did more in a week than I did<br/>
in a year ;-)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s *loads* of things for type As to organize and be involved with that<br/>
don&#39;t involve organizing their kids learning.<br/>

to happen that day.<br/>
<br/>
Or make certain rituals for her, things you can do the same way each day,<br/>
like having her place set at breakfast with her favorite bowl and boxes of<br/>
cereal to choose, a bedtime story and then rubbing her back with oil each<br/>
night before she goes to bed. They&#39;ll have to be things you can stick with.<br/>

I wanted to make one comment.  Don&#39;t you hate when one person speaks for <br/>
everyone.  I hate that.  One family member speaks for &quot;the rest of the family.&quot;  I <br/>
wish everyone would speak for themselves and bring their individual concerns <br/>
to the table to discuss.  When one speaks for everyone you know it is because <br/>
they want you to change not because they want to talk about it and learn more <br/>

out loud and go ahead after reading THIS response! Thanks Sandra!<br/>
<br/>
Yes. I&#39;m type A with a capital A! (I don&#39;t make the money anymore either.)<br/>
<br/>
Tell her that she&#39;s the type who&#39;d be putting on conferences! <br/>
<br/>
I tiled my kitchen counter & backsplash yesterday! Grouting today.<br/>
I&#39;m a gardening FOOL!<br/>
I want BEES!<br/>
I train and groom and show dogs.<br/>
I love to cook (can&#39;t with the sink and range and oven out though!!!)<br/>
I&#39;m pulling the upstairs bathtub out and getting a whole new bathroom when <br/>
I&#39;m done with the kitchen! <br/>
I&#39;m leaving in a week to take my son to camp in PA, then visiting friends in <br/>
NY for a few days.<br/>
Brenda&#39;s coming from Germany to stay for two weeks.<br/>
And all this as I&#39;m pulling together the conference! Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
To me, Unschooling is following your dreams and your desires. *Some* of mine <br/>
are listed above. There are others....many others! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
This lifestyle isn&#39;t *just* about my children. It&#39;s about me and my husband <br/>
and you and yours and ---it&#39;s about truly understanding that learning happens <br/>
all the time, no matter how old or young you are.<br/>
<br/>
Our unschooling children need us to facilitate---to make it easy for them to <br/>
reach *their* dreams and goals, big ones and little ones. Adults that <br/>
understand this (and know that many do NOT!), go out and get what they want. Some of <br/>
those very adults believe that children are incapable of this. *WE* know <br/>
better! Children are quite capable of knowing what they want. It&#39;s our <br/>
responsibility as unschooling parents to help get them where they want to be---to reach <br/>
those dreams and desires. <br/>
<br/>
I think too many people DON&#39;T understand that a really good way to *do* this <br/>
is to model that very behavior. A mom and dad who rush the children to school, <br/>
 go off to work, yell at the kids to get their homework done, send the kids <br/>
to bed, and then spend the evening watching tv while the children are in bed <br/>
are hardly the role models for learning and pursuing dreams.<br/>
<br/>
My boys see me and my husband pursuing all sorts of new ventures DAILY. They <br/>
can&#39;t help it---we&#39;re all slammed together. Sometimes they have to wait while <br/>
I finish what I&#39;m doing. Often they help me. More often *I* wait while THEY <br/>
finish what they&#39;re doing. Often I help them.<br/>
<br/>
I think Type A&#39;s make GREAT unschoolers. There have been people that have <br/>
come on this list complaining that they are too laid back to unschool (type Bs). <br/>
*I* (the type A) tend to think that *that&#39;s* a bigger hindrance to unschooling <br/>
than a real go-getter. But I think that if you understand unschooling (and <br/>
the lifestyle), you can certainly unschool whether you&#39;re ABCD or E!<br/>
<br/>
If she *wants* to unschool, she can. If she doesn&#39;t, she won&#39;t be able to. <br/>
She sounds like someone who could really inspire her children. Maybe your &quot;A <br/>
daughter&quot; could hang out with her more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;d have to get used to less money. More joy, but less money. It&#39;s doable! &lt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Joyce, a massage is a good idea.  She told me last night that I don&#39;t <br/>
hold her enough.  If  I do the massage thing, though, I&#39;ll have to <br/>
schedule in time for everyone else, too.  They won&#39;t want to miss out on <br/>
that.  <br/>
<br/>
Her biggest thing has been that she wants me to lay down with her every <br/>
night.  I don&#39;t mind that at all, it&#39;s just that the 2 1/2 yr old gets <br/>
tired first and I lay down with her.  Then the 5 yr old immediately <br/>
wants me, right then, to lay with her.  I&#39;ve explained to Elysia that <br/>
she could just play quietly with her older sister, Aislinn, until <br/>
Soleille fell asleep, but she insists I need to lay with her right then. <br/>
 For a few nights, she&#39;s slept at the foot of Soleille&#39;s bed, but it&#39;s a <br/>
twin and quite crowded  with four of us then (baby Leiren, too.)  Then <br/>
for the last two nights Aislinn, 7, has developed a sharp back pain just <br/>
as all this is going on.  It miraculously goes away if I lay with her. <br/>
 So obviously they all want me and I&#39;m so torn about what to do.  All <br/>
this is with no set schedule for bedtime either.  My sister says they <br/>
are desperate for a set, scheduled bedtime and that is why they are <br/>
manipulating me so much.  I think they want attention.  It&#39;s just that <br/>
I&#39;m with them all day and I look forward to some time alone at night and <br/>
lately, by the time I go through this with all of them it&#39;s SO late and <br/>
I&#39;m exhausted.   Well, I&#39;ll try anything to get this going smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your advice.  HeidiC.</div>

&gt;about it, whatever the &quot;it&quot; is.<br/>

My dd also went through a crying before bedtime phase,   and I think it was<br/>
adjusting to a new lifestyle.  We needed to just figure out what worked for<br/>
her.    Laying with her,  letting her talk about her day and then talking<br/>
with her about how she is feeling worked for her.<br/>
<br/>
I think she is more of a schedule type of a person too.<br/>

started homeschooling and she is definitely a type A and questions whether<br/>
she could unschool.  Although she says she doesn&#39;t need a curriculum,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; I am a very type b personality (yes, I really do hate typecasting,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; it fits me mostly).  I hate to rush, I&#39;ve always been very creative,<br/>
&gt; &gt; artistic, yada yada yada.  That&#39;s me.  She is type a, hyper, has taken<br/>
&gt; &gt; Prozac to calm down, huge career-woman, thrives on schedules and<br/>
&gt; &gt; predictability.  That&#39;s her.  She makes lots of money.  I make none.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Except for the making lots of money part, I&#39;m like your sister.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So is Pam Sorooshian (prob&#39;ly minus the Prozac).<br/>
&gt; &gt; So is Kelly Lovejoy (seemed to me, in the nearly-a-week I was there).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I was putting off reponding until I read all the other posts. Had to laugh<br/>
&gt; out loud and go ahead after reading THIS response! Thanks Sandra!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Yes. I&#39;m type A with a capital A! (I don&#39;t make the money anymore either.)<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tell her that she&#39;s the type who&#39;d be putting on conferences!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I tiled my kitchen counter & backsplash yesterday! Grouting today.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m a gardening FOOL!<br/>
&gt; I want BEES!<br/>
&gt; I train and groom and show dogs.<br/>
&gt; I love to cook (can&#39;t with the sink and range and oven out though!!!)<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m pulling the upstairs bathtub out and getting a whole new bathroom when<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m done with the kitchen!<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m leaving in a week to take my son to camp in PA, then visiting friends<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; NY for a few days.<br/>
&gt; Brenda&#39;s coming from Germany to stay for two weeks.<br/>
&gt; And all this as I&#39;m pulling together the conference! Go figure.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To me, Unschooling is following your dreams and your desires. *Some* of<br/>
mine<br/>
&gt; are listed above. There are others....many others! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; This lifestyle isn&#39;t *just* about my children. It&#39;s about me and my<br/>
husband<br/>
&gt; and you and yours and ---it&#39;s about truly understanding that learning<br/>
happens<br/>
&gt; all the time, no matter how old or young you are.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Our unschooling children need us to facilitate---to make it easy for them<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; reach *their* dreams and goals, big ones and little ones. Adults that<br/>
&gt; understand this (and know that many do NOT!), go out and get what they<br/>
want. Some of<br/>
&gt; those very adults believe that children are incapable of this. *WE* know<br/>
&gt; better! Children are quite capable of knowing what they want. It&#39;s our<br/>
&gt; responsibility as unschooling parents to help get them where they want to<br/>
be---to reach<br/>
&gt; those dreams and desires.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think too many people DON&#39;T understand that a really good way to *do*<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; is to model that very behavior. A mom and dad who rush the children to<br/>
school,<br/>
&gt;  go off to work, yell at the kids to get their homework done, send the<br/>
kids<br/>
&gt; to bed, and then spend the evening watching tv while the children are in<br/>
bed<br/>
&gt; are hardly the role models for learning and pursuing dreams.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My boys see me and my husband pursuing all sorts of new ventures DAILY.<br/>
They<br/>
&gt; can&#39;t help it---we&#39;re all slammed together. Sometimes they have to wait<br/>
while<br/>
&gt; I finish what I&#39;m doing. Often they help me. More often *I* wait while<br/>
THEY<br/>
&gt; finish what they&#39;re doing. Often I help them.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think Type A&#39;s make GREAT unschoolers. There have been people that have<br/>
&gt; come on this list complaining that they are too laid back to unschool<br/>
(type Bs).<br/>
&gt; *I* (the type A) tend to think that *that&#39;s* a bigger hindrance to<br/>
unschooling<br/>
&gt; than a real go-getter. But I think that if you understand unschooling (and<br/>
&gt; the lifestyle), you can certainly unschool whether you&#39;re ABCD or E!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If she *wants* to unschool, she can. If she doesn&#39;t, she won&#39;t be able to.<br/>
&gt; She sounds like someone who could really inspire her children. Maybe your<br/>
&quot;A<br/>
&gt; daughter&quot; could hang out with her more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; She&#39;d have to get used to less money. More joy, but less money. It&#39;s<br/>
doable! &lt;<br/>

I used to get defensive too,  when we started unschooling.    I bet  you&#39;ll<br/>
get better.   As things get more clear in your mind and you&#39;ve done all your<br/>
research,  the verbage will just flow from your mouth.   You&#39;ll take a slow<br/>
nice breath and all will be well.<br/>
<br/>
As far as if they aren&#39;t willing to listen, well then you just change the<br/>
subject.<br/>
<br/>
If they still don&#39;t stop pestering, say &quot;read these articles,  when you&#39;re<br/>
done, then we&#39;ll talk&quot;.    This has worked for me.<br/>

&gt; Well, I promised to just sit and not say a word.  I&#39;m not sure I can<br/>
&gt; actually do that.  All in all, my family is supportive, but if I try to<br/>
&gt; explain something or discuss this, they say I&#39;m getting defensive.  I<br/>
&gt; know I am a little, but it&#39;s also the truth that they don&#39;t want to hear<br/>
&gt; a reply or learn more about it, they just want to tell me what can go<br/>
&gt; wrong.  I&#39;m not good at the meek little mouse routine.  I don&#39;t know how<br/>
&gt; silent I can be.  HeidiC.<br/>

&gt;Her biggest thing has been that she wants me to lay down with her every<br/>

&gt;tired first and I lay down with her.  Then the 5 yr old immediately<br/>
&gt;wants me, right then, to lay with her.  I&#39;ve explained to Elysia that<br/>
&gt;she could just play quietly with her older sister, Aislinn, until<br/>
&gt;Soleille fell asleep, but she insists I need to lay with her right then.<br/>
&gt;  For a few nights, she&#39;s slept at the foot of Soleille&#39;s bed, but it&#39;s a<br/>
&gt;twin and quite crowded  with four of us then (baby Leiren, too.)  Then<br/>
&gt;for the last two nights Aislinn, 7, has developed a sharp back pain just<br/>
&gt;as all this is going on.  It miraculously goes away if I lay with her.<br/>
&gt;  So obviously they all want me and I&#39;m so torn about what to do.  All<br/>
&gt;this is with no set schedule for bedtime either.  My sister says they<br/>
&gt;are desperate for a set, scheduled bedtime and that is why they are<br/>
&gt;manipulating me so much.  I think they want attention.  It&#39;s just that<br/>
&gt;I&#39;m with them all day and I look forward to some time alone at night and<br/>
&gt;lately, by the time I go through this with all of them it&#39;s SO late and<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
How about a room full of mattresses on the floor with room for everyone, and <br/>
a &quot;train&quot; style massage:  mom does Aislinn, she does Elysia, she does <br/>
Soleille, she does Leiren;  then everyone lies down together for lullabies <br/>
and sleeping.  I have twins, now 9, and a 15, and an 18.  When the twins <br/>
were infants and nursed constantly the older kids were often starved for <br/>
attention.  Lying together at bedtime, whenever that might be &lt;g&gt; worked <br/>
wonders.  Occasionally I didn&#39;t fall asleep with them &lt;g&gt; and got up for <br/>
some private time.  But mostly I needed the sleep more than the solitude, a <br/>
situation I&#39;ve more than made up for as they&#39;ve all gotten older and <br/>
extremely self-confident and independent!<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I lurk here and at unschoolingdotdomedy (love that!) and consider these <br/>
lists my lifeline to the ultimate unschooling lifestyle!  Thank you all!<br/>

&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;husband<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;and you and yours and ---it&#39;s about truly understanding that learning<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;happens<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;all the time, no matter how old or young you are.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;Our unschooling children need us to facilitate---to make it easy for them<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;to<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;reach *their* dreams and goals, big ones and little ones. Adults that<br/>
&gt;&gt;understand this (and know that many do NOT!), go out and get what they<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;want. Some of<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;those very adults believe that children are incapable of this. *WE* know<br/>
&gt;&gt;better! Children are quite capable of knowing what they want. It&#39;s our<br/>
&gt;&gt;responsibility as unschooling parents to help get them where they want to<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;be---to reach<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;those dreams and desires.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I think too many people DON&#39;T understand that a really good way to *do*<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;this<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;is to model that very behavior. A mom and dad who rush the children to<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;school,<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; go off to work, yell at the kids to get their homework done, send the<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;kids<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;to bed, and then spend the evening watching tv while the children are in<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;bed<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;are hardly the role models for learning and pursuing dreams.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;My boys see me and my husband pursuing all sorts of new ventures DAILY.<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;They<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;can&#39;t help it---we&#39;re all slammed together. Sometimes they have to wait<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;while<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I finish what I&#39;m doing. Often they help me. More often *I* wait while<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;THEY<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;finish what they&#39;re doing. Often I help them.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;I think Type A&#39;s make GREAT unschoolers. There have been people that have<br/>
&gt;&gt;come on this list complaining that they are too laid back to unschool<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;(type Bs).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;*I* (the type A) tend to think that *that&#39;s* a bigger hindrance to<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;unschooling<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;than a real go-getter. But I think that if you understand unschooling (and<br/>
&gt;&gt;the lifestyle), you can certainly unschool whether you&#39;re ABCD or E!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;If she *wants* to unschool, she can. If she doesn&#39;t, she won&#39;t be able to.<br/>
&gt;&gt;She sounds like someone who could really inspire her children. Maybe your<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&quot;A<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;daughter&quot; could hang out with her more! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;She&#39;d have to get used to less money. More joy, but less money. It&#39;s<br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;doable! &lt;<br/>
&gt;  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-375383212">Thanks Kelli.  I have been reading loads of material, highlighting, <br/>
rereading.  I want to be able to throw quotes like a Superbowl <br/>

and it doesn&#39;t help my case, so keeping my mouth shut would be a good <br/>
idea for the time being.  I did tell my mil that I wouldn&#39;t discuss it <br/>
with her unless she was willing to learn more about it.  This was after <br/>
she tried to tell me how awful it all was.  She hasn&#39;t said a word about <br/>
it since.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the support.  I&#39;d really be out in left field without all of <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My 8-year-old now wants me to tickle him and wrestle with him much more<br/>
since the baby was born 5 months ago. They just want more touch during<br/>
these changes. But I think it&#39;s great that he (and your daughter) can<br/>
identify their needs and then reach out to get us to help them. I think<br/>
lots of kids aren&#39;t able to do that (and adults).<br/>
As others have said, can you guys get a big bed or put a couple together?<br/>
We&#39;ve always had the kids all around or in the main bed -- I always think<br/>
it&#39;s a bit like a giant dog bed with lots of puppies sprawled around (plus<br/>
we usually have a couple of dogs and a cat in there as well:)<br/>
Then perhaps you could all go to bed together. Have some massages, read<br/>
some books, even watch a short show, and then let them snuggle off<br/>
together. Then you can get up or, as I do sometimes, have the light on low<br/>
and read near them. It really is important to have that time you need for<br/>
yourself but perhaps if they are all in together then they&#39;ll proved the<br/>
reassurance for each other.<br/>
<br/>
When I was pregnant we got a new free Arab channel that came on in our<br/>
bedroom tv. Every night at 9:30 Friends is on. All my kids climb into bed<br/>
with the baby and me and it&#39;s this really nice time together. Afterwards<br/>
the older 2 chat then wander off to do whatever they do in the middle of<br/>
the night (teens:) and the 8 year old and baby go off to sleep. A couple of<br/>
nights ago, my 15-year-old didn&#39;t realize what time it was and so didn&#39;t<br/>
come in. Later I could see he was upset and I apologized but reassured him<br/>
that he&#39;d seen that episode. He looked at me as if I were crazy and said<br/>
&quot;it&#39;s not the show mom, it&#39;s just kinda relaxing all being together&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Needless to say I was very happy.<br/>
<br/>
Now I just have to figure out if we can all keep watching Friends in the US<br/>
this summer (here apparantly there are many scenes that are cut so I don&#39;t<br/>
really know what it&#39;s fully like:)<br/>

This has worked for us over the years. It&#39;s such a culturally bound idea<br/>
that the mother and father sleep in one bed and kids in another. I think we<br/>
need to get over that idea and just figure out what works for our own<br/>
individual family over time (and this changes constantly). Plus of course<br/>
you get a break from snoring!!<br/>

<br/>
There was an even bigger thrill when they were promoted to my rank and I <br/>
could start merrily ignoring them!  (They still fill me in on their life doings <br/>

Depending on the group, sometimes others are too afraid or volatile and don&#39;t <br/>
want to get angry in the conversation so they DO send one or another to speak <br/>
for the general mood.<br/>
<br/>
Some people take it on themselves.  Others are sent. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; When one speaks for everyone you know it is because <br/>
they want you to change not because they want to talk about it and learn more <br/>
about it, whatever the &quot;it&quot; is.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s because they want the rest of the group to hush up, and if <br/>
they can say &quot;I talked to her, and she says X...&quot; they WILL hush for a while.  Or <br/>
at least she&#39;ll have something to say instead of &quot;I have no idea.&quot;<br/>

ones.   We have room to write Kirby&#39;s work hours, and people&#39;s appointments.  <br/>
It&#39;s a mess, but it works for us.  They cost $12 or so at Office Max and such <br/>
places, and they have a big loop so you can take them down.  Spiral bound so you <br/>
just turn the page but they&#39;re all still there.  This time of year if they <br/>
still have any 2003 it would be half price or less.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Well, I promised to just sit and not say a word.  I&#39;m not sure I can <br/>
actually do that.  All in all, my family is supportive, but if I try to <br/>
explain something or discuss this, they say I&#39;m getting defensive. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Why should you just sit?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could let them all state their concerns and you could take notes.<br/>
Taking notes helps me maintain still when I&#39;m required to sit through some <br/>
meeting.  It&#39;s not totally sitting and listening, which makes my head start to <br/>
spin out.<br/>
<br/>
And afterward you could answer all their concerns in writing and give <br/>
everyone a copy.  You could  say in the summary report that you hesitate to explain <br/>
things to them because although you can sit and listen to them, they can&#39;t <br/>
listen to you without saying &quot;defensive,&quot; and that you don&#39;t think that&#39;s right.  <br/>
It might help them listen better in the future, too.<br/>
