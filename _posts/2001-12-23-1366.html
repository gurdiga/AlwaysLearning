<div id="ygrps-yiv-971420922">Thanks for the words of welcome Sandra.. and Ren.. I am very intrigued with<br/>
this list..but it&#39;s moves so fast it&#39;s hard for me to keep up! I spend a lot<br/>
of my time out in the barn..the critters require more care in the winter and<br/>
especially since the weather has been so rainy lately..a real mud-ville<br/>
here.<br/>
<br/>
I&quot;m interested in the discussion on Religion..esp between Shelia and Sandra.<br/>
So much of what you say Shelia.. is what I used to just take and swallow<br/>
whole..but now I&#39;m not so sure.. I was raised Lutheran and went to private<br/>
school for my first 8 grades.<br/>
<br/>
I recently started to doubt when the pastor of the Chruch we last attended<br/>
(Nazarene).. said that a Christian knows they are saved..because they would<br/>
want to be in Church everytime the doors were open..Well it was never<br/>
something I really wanted to do.. just an obligation. I never felt a real<br/>
&#39;urge&#39; to be there..  it all seemed so fake..even tho I considered myself a<br/>
&quot;saved person. I&#39;m trying to sort out Chruch doctrine and what the Bible<br/>
teaches..and I&#39;m coming up with totally different things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1317295609">Let&#39;s just say that I disagree with the pastor of that church. If what <br/>
he says is correct, then none of the many people reportedly saved <br/>
after pentecost were really saved because they never attended a <br/>
service.  There was no church building, no service, no pastor.  Just a <br/>
bunch of people who were committed to encouraging and exhorting each <br/>
other daily, who lived and worshipped with each other, and who <br/>
listened to the apostles share about their time on earth with Jesus.  <br/>
<br/>
There were no church buildings until Constantine decided it wasn&#39;t <br/>
fair that these Christians were meeting in homes when the pagans had <br/>
temples.  So, he started erecting &quot;Christian temples&quot; in which <br/>
Christians began to have things that the pagans did--like choirs and <br/>
three point sermons--and the church started on its road to <br/>
institutionalization.  <br/>
<br/>
When church doctrine conflicts with the Bible, it&#39;s time to turn our <br/>
backs on church doctrine.  <br/>
<br/>
Julie, I really think you would enjoy a book called &quot;Revolution&quot; by <br/>
Gene Edwards. <br/>
