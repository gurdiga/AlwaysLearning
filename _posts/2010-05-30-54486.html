<div id="ygrps-yiv-205503511">Hi! I&#39;m Erika from No. CA. Short time lurker.<br/>
I have a son Asher who will be 8 in August. He has never been to public school.<br/>
<br/>
I had originally started teaching Asher in a more strict & formal homeschooling way. That back fired horribly. He is one of those wonderfully busy boys who just can&#39;t stay still for too long. It was a painful process for us both and I admit that I caused some damage from my pushing. As I backed off the daily copy work & the harsh daily reading practice he as blossomed. Now we spend our time doing things he enjoys like baking, hunting for tadpoles, games (including xbox), lego or whatever he is interested in at the moment. Right now he really loves &quot;mad libs&quot;, even though he can only read a few of the words by himself. We put away most of the workbooks and only look at them if they are relevant to whatever our focus is.<br/>
<br/>
Asher just told me that Daddy said he wants him to do more schoolwork. He wants more reading, writing & math. I&#39;m a little surprised & shocked as we have always agreed on how I was schooling Asher. My husband parents were both teachers in the public school system & have always been unhappy with our choice. Ted has always been supportive....until now. I think the idea of unschooling is so foreign to him that maybe because he doesn&#39;t see all the desk work that he thinks we aren&#39;t doing enough.<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that someone could point me to some literature that supports unschooling. Something fairly brief & to the point. I of course plan on talking to him about this, however he is gone 3-5 days a week for work & I would love to be able to show him something substantial to ease whatever fear he has regarding this.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading all this! All input is appreciated.<br/>
<br/>

Why did the dad talk to Asher instead of to you?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Hi! I&#39;m Erika from No. CA.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Northern California is good!<br/>
There&#39;s a conference in August. You and your husband could go and hear  <br/>
unschoolers, meet Pam Sorooshian&#39;s daughters, meet my oldest son,  <br/>
Kirby, and other older unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://hscconference.com/">http://hscconference.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
and it&#39;s not exclusively an unschooling conference so you could also  <br/>
cruise the vendors and see some local opportunities, but also some  <br/>
very expensive options that will help persuade him that expensive  <br/>
options or school at home can be problems.<br/>

&lt;&lt;Asher just told me that Daddy said he wants him to do more schoolwork.*&gt;&gt;<br/>
Perhaps your son is mistaken.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate parents should not be communicating through their children, even<br/>
if divorced or separated.  A child should never be made to feel responsible<br/>
for his/her parents well being nor creating peace in the marriage.  It works<br/>
the other way around:  the parents need to communicate with one another to<br/>
create a nest and be responsible for creating a peaceful home.<br/>
<br/>
This confusion you are experiencing is definitely not a road to peace, love<br/>
and joy in family life--so you need to investigate. You might gently ask<br/>
your partner for an opinion on your life together. When I say *gently* I<br/>
mean practice the words until you find a way to ask him *without* accusing.<br/>
You sound hurt and as if you are harboring resentment for your in-laws. You<br/>
may also want to first focus on how much you love him and your son and want<br/>
them both to be happy:-)<br/>
<br/>
If Asher feel concern for his grandparents you could brainstorm with him to<br/>
find a way for him to discuss their concerns, or better still be around if<br/>
you are concerned he might be feeling their disapproval.  You may try<br/>
offering Asher more opportunities to learn and see what he enjoys; since he<br/>
could just be wanting to experiment with &quot;school&quot;.  Perhaps he would like to<br/>
put together a project for fun on a topic he enjoys for his dad and<br/>
grandparents.  He may have extrapolated daddy&#39;s wishes from overhearing<br/>
words out of context.  It is not his job however to please his<br/>
grandparents--though if he wants to make a gift of an academic sort out of<br/>
love/respect that sounds nice.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

If you can see that your life is full and that life is good, then you are<br/>
more apt to find something positive and agreeable in another person. Jenny C<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-780672023">One of the things that can really help with seeing exactly how much is going on is keeping a blog or v-log that you can share just with your husband, or with all the world. Being present moment to moment can make you blind to how little someone who is only there 4 to 2 days a week is experiencing. Fill the gaps for him by putting together pictures and stories and videos of what you and Asher do day to day. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1003109739">My husband&#39;s turning point was getting to be around other kids the age  <br/>
of our own children, and seeing that ours *were* cool and mature and  <br/>
knowledgeable.  Another good boost was being around other unschooling  <br/>
families, and the dads of those families.   Find opportunities to be  <br/>
around other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Some people say comparisons are evil, but in our family it helped Keith.<br/>
And if comparisons were universally evil, why unschool at all? ;-)<br/>

<br/>
I did talk to my husband & he apologized for talking to Asher before speaking to me, and that it is the lack of &quot;school work&quot; that is bothering him. I asked him to stay open minded and to please discuss his worries with me and not put that kind of pressure on Asher. he agreed.<br/>

I like both the ideas on charting our daily activities for my husband as well as the idea of a project on a subject Asher really loves.<br/>

<br/>
I think you&#39;ve interpreted the ideas in too-schooly a way.  &quot;Charting  <br/>
daily activities&quot; isn&#39;t the same as keeping a blog, or a journal of  <br/>
the best parts.  Some things aren&#39;t worth charting.  Some charts cause  <br/>
people to press children to do things just for the sake of filling in  <br/>
a box on a chart.<br/>
<br/>
As &quot;a project on a subject&quot; anyone really loves, it could be a great  <br/>
way to cause that to be a subject he or she will avoid in the future.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to think of &quot;subjects.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
These might help:<br/>

in a month or so.  Your perspective will make them different.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2099182509">***I like both the ideas on charting our daily activities for my husband as well as the idea of a project on a subject Asher really loves.***<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps instead of a &quot;subject&quot;, do a project on something that he loves.  Lego creations are fun to photograph.  The life cycle of frogs is interesting as well.<br/>
<br/>
There is something about that age, the near 9 or 9ish age, where what unschoolers do looks very very different from what kids in schools do.  For my older daughter it seemed to stem from the multiplication tables.  The multiplication tables are like this big huge milestone in school.  Before that, much of school is about learning to read, and busy work.  Then along comes multiplication tables and people suddenly feel like their kids, if they aren&#39;t in school, are going to lag behind if they miss out on it.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschoolers stress about it.  If kids are at the multiplication age, other things start seeming more relevant too, like what level of reading a kid is at, or what extraordinary science projects their children are doing.  Testing is more prevalent and school, in general, becomes way more competitive than prior to that 8/9 age.<br/>
<br/>
If a person wants to continue unschooling, this is when they need to really step it up, especially if they have a reluctant partner.  From this point onward, in what I&#39;ve experienced and what I&#39;ve seen, unschooling kids diverge greatly from what school kids do.  It&#39;s going to look and feel very different.  They don&#39;t really even out or become strikingly &quot;better&quot; until they reach that balance in the teen years.  I&#39;m not even sure how to describe it, but it seems like unschooled teens reach this point of being sure within themselves, still growing and changing and learning, but there is this calm centered aspect that I see that I don&#39;t see in schooled kids much.  It&#39;s an element that many reluctant partners see and KNOW that it&#39;s been working when they get to that point.<br/>
<br/>
Between that 8/9 age and that point in teenhood, the primary unschooling parent needs to really see the learning and really bring the world to their kids and their kids to their partners.  Unschooling is really hard to get for some people. Just like a parent can present something to a child in just the way they know their child will receive it, they can do that for their partners as well.  What really did it for my own husband was going to an unschooling conference, and having lots of schooled kids around and seeing the differences in behavior.  It&#39;s very striking.  The academic stuff was more peripheral for him when he saw how our kids didn&#39;t have weird behavioral issues that other kids had.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-184321820">Nine is the age Holly, Marty and Kathryn pegged.  Nine to 11, I think  <br/>
they said, when Joyce and I talked about this one day in the car when  <br/>
it was the five of us on a highway.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They don&#39;t really even out or become strikingly &quot;better&quot; until they  <br/>
reach that balance in the teen years. I&#39;m not even sure how to  <br/>
describe it, but it seems like unschooled teens reach this point of  <br/>
being sure within themselves, still growing and changing and learning,  <br/>
but there is this calm centered aspect that I see that I don&#39;t see in  <br/>
schooled kids much. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen that, and part of it is, I think, that in middle school or  <br/>
Jr. High (when kids are ten or eleven, give or take a year) what  <br/>
they&#39;re learning in school can seem impressive!  Names, places,  <br/>
writing essays, doing geometry.  The unschooled kids are doing things,  <br/>
but not what would be considered &quot;academic things,&quot; generally  <br/>
speaking.   So the kids at home can start to feel nervous, and their  <br/>
friends at school ca start to be cocky.<br/>
<br/>
But here&#39;s the deal:  life is lumpy, and when people draw a curve on a  <br/>
graph to show that if a child learns at a certain rate over a number  <br/>
of years he will be here at one point, and there at another point...  <br/>
that curve is not based on reality.<br/>
<br/>
About the time all these kids turn thirteen or fourteen, puberty is  <br/>
coming upon them, they are feeling and becoming different, more like  <br/>
the adults than like the babies, something big happens.  Many of the  <br/>
school kids have just had enough.  The &quot;no&quot; and &quot;sit&quot; and &quot;wait&quot; have  <br/>
built up in them until they can&#39;t take any more.   Meanwhile, the  <br/>
unschoolers wake up and stretch their longer arms and their maturing  <br/>
brains, and the things they&#39;ve been accumulating over the years start  <br/>
to gel and to make new sense.  They are synthesizing their own  <br/>
knowledge from all the parts they&#39;ve collected, all the experiences  <br/>
and trivia and connections they&#39;re making.   School kids are being  <br/>
told &quot;Just do what you&#39;re supposed to do; just follow the directions;  <br/>
your opinion isn&#39;t important.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My boys had a gaming friend, a little older than Kirby.  They played  <br/>
all kinds of collectible card games and role playing games and video  <br/>
games with him for a few years.  When he was in 10th grade he was SURE  <br/>
my boys would love school and should go there.  &quot;How will they learn  <br/>
chemistry?&quot; he said.  The friend liked school, was in theatre, and  <br/>
marching band.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of about a year, his parents split up suddenly and  <br/>
dramatically (and there were four of them all taking care of him  <br/>
together, before that).  That was probably the greatest factor.  But  <br/>
he was also to the point of thinking that maybe school wasn&#39;t all  <br/>
that.  He was way over six feet tall (6&#39; 4&quot; came, somewhere in there),  <br/>
and short little people were telling him no, sit down, wait, what do  <br/>
*you* know, you&#39;re just a kid.  He could have knocked them down and  <br/>
run away.  They never would have caught him.    But our culture  <br/>
doesn&#39;t allow that.  He needed to grieve and recover from the loss of  <br/>
his home and parents, but the school schedule didn&#39;t allow for him to  <br/>
cry, or to lick his wounds.<br/>
<br/>
So he started cutting himself, piercing himself, taking drugs and more  <br/>
drugs, drinking himself into unconsciousness.   The last year of  <br/>
school, he HATED school and everything to do with school.  My boys  <br/>
were working when they were that age, and making enough money to buy  <br/>
games, gasoline, music, food for friends.   Their friend kept re- <br/>
setting his self-destruct sequence, and when he didn&#39;t self-destruct  <br/>
he went on binges and re-set it.<br/>
<br/>
But back up to when the kids are nine:  At nine, the friend was calm  <br/>
and confident and doing his school work every day.  My kids, at nine,  <br/>
were playing games, riding bikes, climbing trees, playing with Lego.<br/>
<br/>
The snapshot of life at nine doesn&#39;t showcase the unschoolers.      <br/>
Something substantial is happening, but it isn&#39;t measurable in  <br/>
semesters and &quot;school years.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/substance">http://sandradodd.com/substance</a><br/>
That was written when Marty was nine, and Kirby was eleven.<br/>

<br/>
So, he asked me, &quot;What&#39;s plus 2 plus 2 plus 2?&quot; When I told him it was 6 he said, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s two 3s.&quot; I have to admit I was very surprised. I wasn&#39;t expecting that. We&#39;ve never done any kind of mathematics tables or exercises. He just knew the relationship.<br/>

<br/>
It was an unexpected conversation.  I knew that she was really into numbers and messing with numbers and patterns, but I didn&#39;t know that she knew she was really into numbers and messing with them!  It was a bit of self awareness that I didn&#39;t know was there and it was cool!  She&#39;s 8 for those that don&#39;t know.<br/>

I was thinking about my experience with math in school compared to my unschooled children&#39;s relationship with math. I did very well in math in school. It was my favorite subject. I could sit for hours and do the math problems in the textbook. Most of it came very easy to me. I had a little trouble with Geometry in high school and Calculus in college but I still did well in those subjects. I remember once asking my dad (probably like almost all teens at some point) what the point in learning Algebra was. It certainly wasn&#39;t anything I&#39;d use outside of school. He told me the point was to learn how to think logically. Well, obviously, there are an unlimited number of ways to think logically. Algebra isn&#39;t the only way.<br/>
<br/>
When I got out in the real world, I discovered very quickly that I had no idea how math related to that world. I only understood the abstract math provided by textbooks. I struggled for years to understand it all, especially when other unschoolers were telling me that my children would learn math from Legos. Huh? How could that be possible? They wouldn&#39;t understand the sentence, &quot;A + B = C.&quot; That&#39;s math.<br/>
<br/>
Then one day very recently I had a conversation about it with my dad, who has a Ph.D. in mathematics. He explained and somehow it finally clicked. He said I was thinking only about arithmetic and that&#39;s a very small and relatively unimportant part of mathematics. Mathematics is more importantly about things like the spatial relationships between things in this world. For example, knowing the best way to pack the car trunk. That&#39;s the type of math my children are learning. The math that works in the real world to solve real problems. I never got that from all the math I learned in school. As you can probably tell from my explanation, I still don&#39;t understand it fully but I finally got that&#39;s it&#39;s not just about numbers.<br/>
<br/>
So, while schooled children are memorizing multiplication tables, my children are learning how to intuitively understand the relationships between numbers and shapes and so on. It&#39;s hard to keep a tangible record of that, especially if you are comparing it to all the papers that schooled children have.<br/>
<br/>
This is really long, I know, but I want to share one other story about Ethan. The other day he told me he was going to get married when he&#39;s 18. I commented that that was kind of young to get married. Most people aren&#39;t prepared to be married by 18. He told me he is learning how to be married from playing house, when he is usually the dad. He understands the relationship between his play and real life because he hasn&#39;t been told that play is frivolous. <br/>

going to say they sit around doing arithmetic all day! &lt;g&gt;  They &quot;play&quot; <br/>
around with ideas - math is very creative. It is sometimes like playing <br/>
around with the rules of games to see how different changes affect the <br/>
way the game plays out. Sometimes it is more like visual art.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I only wish he had told me that when I asked as a teenager. I get so frustrated that I can&#39;t understand how mathematics works in the real world. I love that my children will intuitively understand the relationship between things without even thinking of math.<br/>
<br/>
I think I will ask my dad what mathematicians do.<br/>

always liked patterns and puzzles, and sucked at math curriculum. I love<br/>
concepts with numbers now that I have realized I can come at it more<br/>
visually.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1655370701">Here&#39;s my dad&#39;s response to the question:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Mathematicians think, about mathematics, about what concepts are important, about what is true, about how to establish mathematical truths.  They determine criteria for logical truth, statistical truth, and approximate truth.  They analyze and solve problems.  They determine what is possible, what is impossible, what is feasible, and what is unfeasible.  They figure out how to do things efficiently.&quot;<br/>

He said that&#39;s what he could come up with off the top of his head. If anyone has any more specific questions, he&#39;ll be happy to try to answer them.<br/>
