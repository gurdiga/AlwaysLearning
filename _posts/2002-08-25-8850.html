<br/>
Hello eagle, I am your brother<br/>
For I have always loved you.<br/>
The way you fly makes me feel so free.<br/>
I want to fly with you and dance in the wind.<br/>
All my life I have wanted to be like you<br/>
The way you turn and dive, you are my dream.<br/>
Please help me to fly in my mind<br/>
To soar with you would be heaven.<br/>
To learn to fly with you is my dream.<br/>
<br/>
Kathryn<br/>
