<div id="ygrps-yiv-962758971">I know there was a blog carnival recently about bedtimes and late  <br/>
nights, but I&#39;ve been really busy lately and didn&#39;t contribute.<br/>
<br/>
Today on another list something came up about about the author of  <br/>
this, and I went to find the things I have on my site by her.  Great  <br/>
stuff, all of it.  But this one is a perfect late-night learning story  <br/>
I thought might be good to bring up front again:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My dh wasn&#39;t too sure about unschooling at first (about 9-10 years  <br/>
ago), and was also adamant the kids be in bed and stay there at a  <br/>
certain time. I&#39;d just come home from a one-day conference—probably  <br/>
the first time I heard Sandra speak—with an armload of interesting  <br/>
toys and books and a head full of inspiration. One of the books was  <br/>
about finding Titanic, and included a paper model, which I decided  <br/>
Mommy should put together (I really like that kind of thing :-) I was  <br/>
working on it after the kids had gone to bed, but then-7-y.o. Alex got  <br/>
up. He looked at the book and we talked about it as I worked; we  <br/>
discovered what a fathom was, and that Titanic came to rest on the  <br/>
continental shelf, not the very bottom of the ocean, and I&#39;m sure some  <br/>
more interesting things, but those stick in my mind.<br/>
<br/>
About a half hour later, Alex went back to bed and I kept gluing. Dh  <br/>
came in and said, &quot;So that&#39;s unschooling.&quot; He&#39;d overheard the  <br/>
conversation. I said, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s unschooling.&quot; Never had an  <br/>
argument after that :-)<br/>

Here&#39;s my latenight learning page, but the carnival was only for new  <br/>
writing.   That&#39;s good, and I approve of the policy, I just hadn&#39;t  <br/>
written anything lately!<br/>
