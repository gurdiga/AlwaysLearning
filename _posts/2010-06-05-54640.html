<div id="ygrps-yiv-1986007737">Busy dayS, really.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow is pretty solidly booked, and I still haven&#39;t caught up on  <br/>
mail from Friday, so although I&#39;m here a few times a day and mostly to  <br/>
check on e-mail from home and that... I&#39;m not really paying full  <br/>
attention to the discussions, and I&#39;m sorry.  I wish I could keep up  <br/>
without missing my time with Holly and getting to hang out with Bea  <br/>
and her family.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow/Saturday, we&#39;re all going to Montreal for a get-together,  <br/>
where Holly and I will speak, and we won&#39;t be back until late.  Sunday  <br/>
I go to New Jersey.   I might never catch up with this list ever  <br/>
again; just wanted to let people know that I appear to be here, but  <br/>
I&#39;m ghostly and weak, e-mailwise...<br/>

Ah, well the rest of us shall have to keep up for you!  I&#39;ve been preoccupied with an emergency situation, so I&#39;m popping in and out!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad our families are more important than lists! <br/>
