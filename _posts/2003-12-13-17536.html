<div id="ygrps-yiv-2007166719">I am overhearing Janene in her imaginary play.  My work (public middle <br/>
school) interferes with my hearing and thinking.  Janene says &quot;superbaby <br/>
sucks....&quot;  I gasp.  My five year old, using this word, in that way!  <br/>
Gasp, choke.  &quot;Janene, what did you say?&quot;   Try to keep my voice calm, <br/>
non judgemental.  She grins up at me, &quot;I said &quot;superbaby sucks.&quot;  I look <br/>
at her.  She is holding superbaby to her own nipple.  Superbaby is <br/>
cuzzling.  sigh<br/>
