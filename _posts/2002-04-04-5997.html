&gt;<br/>
&gt;The goldfinches have started to arrive.  Some stayed all winter but now<br/>
&gt;we have a lot and the pine siskins are here too. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our goldfinches came, emptied the feeder every couple of days for about <br/>
3 weeks, and now they&#39;re gone again.  I haven&#39;t seen any indigo <br/>
buntings, which I&#39;m disappointed about.  Last year, we were the first to <br/>
report them at the Wild Birds store.<br/>
<br/>
We have doves galore this year, and my little Jack Russell has taken to <br/>
barking at them non-stop.  They just ignore her, which makes her bark <br/>
more.  Oy.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of birds....Camp Fire USA has a Save the Bluebirds program to <br/>
help bring bluebirds back.  I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever seen a bluebird. <br/>
 Are they more common in other parts of the country?  (I&#39;m in Memphis.) <br/>
 My husband the bird watcher wants the kids to do this project next <br/>
year, but it&#39;s hard to see the point if we don&#39;t have any here.  There&#39;s <br/>
a bluebird society website, but it wasn&#39;t homey enough for me.  Please, <br/>
someone, tell me about bluebirds.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-661125152"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;We have 2 dogs, 1 cat, 1 rat, 1 leopard gecko, 1 kingsnake, 1 parakeet, 2<br/>
&gt;fish, and up until last night, 1 mouse (now resting in peace with 3 ex-rats<br/>
&gt;in a consecrated corner of the yard).  Oh, and I work with horses 3 days a<br/>
&gt;week but none of them live with us.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We went in to a ranger station at a county park yesterday.  Sent around <br/>
the corner to the office of the ranger, to ask about whether we could <br/>
have a fire.  I noticed a toy snake on the desk, and said, &quot;Look Will, a <br/>
snake,&quot; and poked it with my finger and then went on to ask my question.<br/>
<br/>
Will waited politely until the conversation was over, and then he just <br/>
started cracking up laughing!  He said, &quot;MOM! That snake is REAL!  And <br/>
you TOUCHED IT!!!!!&quot;  I didn&#39;t believe him and he poked it and it sho&#39; <br/>
nuff, it moved!  <br/>
<br/>
::::shiver::::<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;d been watching it move very slowly the whole time we were talking. <br/>
 He knows I don&#39;t care for snakes, and don&#39;t like to touch them.  It was <br/>
a Tennessee corn snake, her pet, and it was &quot;sunning&quot; itself wrapped <br/>
around her rolodex and her paper tray.  She kept saying &quot;He&#39;s so <br/>
spoiled.&quot; lol.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never understand you snake people.  <br/>

Shyrley, Cornsnakes are a good starter snake. Their gentle, eat small things <br/>
and don&#39;t take up much space.<br/>

Welcome Laurel. We&#39;re just looking into getting a rat right now, my favorite <br/>
type of small pet!! Not 33 though, wow.<br/>
Do you breed them?<br/>
I would like one of those &quot;blue&quot; rats...that actually look silver/grey <br/>
colored.<br/>
We also have very limited space, 1250 s.f. to be exact. But dh is finishing <br/>
the basement so he has an &quot;escape hatch&quot; and we can be more relaxed about <br/>
messes and get some pets.<br/>
We&#39;ve been referring to it as his &quot;fenced in area&quot;. Did any of you see that  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The snake is my son&#39;s.  I held several different breeds of hatchling when we<br/>
were choosing; Alex was most interested in a patterned or black Mexican king<br/>
snake at first, but when we went back for a second look, they were sold out.<br/>
The store had a number of very small black and white California king snakes,<br/>
plus a larger one, about 8 months old.  He&#39;d been returned; his owner bought<br/>
him for her 4-year old son, and then realized it wasn&#39;t really a good pet<br/>
for a child that young.  The snake had been handled quite a lot, so he was<br/>
already calm -- the little hatchlings startle you!  Anyway, I enjoyed<br/>
holding the snake in the store, so Alex decided that was the one he&#39;d get.<br/>
Smart boy -- buy the snake your mom likes &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Same for the king snakes; they aren&#39;t constrictors, they don&#39;t get *too* big<br/>
(5 ft. long -- Salazar Slytherin is about 2 feet now), and we&#39;re feeding him<br/>
dead mice, not live.  The theory is, the snake will stay calmer and never<br/>
nip at things if it doesn&#39;t have to strike and kill its dinner.  I have 4<br/>
dead mice in my freezer -- do I do these things just to shock my mother, I<br/>
wonder?  LOL<br/>

gotten subcutaneous tumors.  We bought a blue rex along with the cinnamon<br/>
blue, but she&#39;s gone to Ratty Heaven; she was cute -- had curly fur and<br/>
crinkled whiskers. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve seen bluebirds and bluejays both.  Bluejays are not as pretty a blue <br/>
(darker) and the birds are pointier a couple of ways.  Bluebirds are <br/>
round-headed.<br/>
I haven&#39;t seen one for a long time, but I don&#39;t really look, either.<br/>
<br/>
Most of you prob&#39;ly know that what we call robins here aren&#39;t what robins are <br/>
in England.  Maybe same with magpies.  We have what we call magpies in New <br/>
Mexico, but they&#39;re crows with blue and white on the fronts of their wings.  <br/>
But in England, magpies might be different.<br/>
