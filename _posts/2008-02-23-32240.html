<div id="ygrps-yiv-425632992">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
My name is Susan May and I am new to this list. I am new to the idea <br/>
of unschooling too and very interested. <br/>
<br/>
My daughter is 20 months old. <br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I like how you mentioned that you discuss going to school <br/>
with your children every summer. I asked a similar question on <br/>
another list about getting my child&#39;s input -- letting her choose <br/>
school or to be home. Most people agreed that that is the best way to <br/>
go, but one person mentioned that maybe not when they are very young <br/>
(kindegarten age - ?). What do you all think about this? As my <br/>
daughter approaches &quot;school age&quot; how do I address this? Do we just go <br/>
on living out lives and when she starts asking about school talk <br/>
about the different options? <br/>
<br/>
My second question concerns another topic that has been recently <br/>
discussed. I have only just begun reading/researching recently <br/>
(within the last few weeks) and I am thankful that I have come across <br/>
all of these ideas while my daughter is very young. These are very <br/>
new ideas to me! However, I&#39;m pretty sure that my husband would think <br/>
that I am crazy to even consider unschoooling. I was hoping that some <br/>
of you might have some advice for how to start talking with him about <br/>
these ideas. I know that the first step is to really just start <br/>
discussing with him. I guess before I just jump into talking with him <br/>
about unschooling I really want to have a grasp on what unschooling <br/>
is, why I would want to do it and believe in it etc. I sometimes have <br/>
a hard time putting into words (speaking) my thoughts and feel if I <br/>
am not &quot;prepared&quot; a discussion with him may not go well. I know that <br/>
recently it has come up how important it is to have 2 supportive <br/>
parents when unschooling and so this is one of the major concerns on <br/>
my mind right now as I begin to learn about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any input!<br/>
<br/>
Susan</div>

I would just keep it in mind as other conversations happen.  If  <br/>
something comes up about his school being unhappy, or your school  <br/>
memories, or stories of nephews or neighbors, or whatever, maybe you  <br/>
could just say &quot;More and more kids are staying home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you see a news story about a homeschooler doing something cool,  <br/>
you could point it out.   Let him discover the whole idea gradually  <br/>
too, I think, instead of preparing in secret and then blasting him  <br/>
with a big fullblown deal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Discover it together.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thanks for your input. I definitely think that the slowly learning <br/>
together idea is best. Luckily our daughter is little still and we <br/>
are just starting our family so this approach should be good for our <br/>
family (no pressure to start school too soon!) It is just hard for me <br/>
sometimes when I have so many ideas rattling around in my brain to <br/>
not spill them all out. Also, I am a big reader and my husband is not <br/>
so much.<br/>
<br/>
I did start a little conversation this morning and I feel that it <br/>
went pretty well. We were in the car and DH was driving (I&#39;ve read <br/>
that men/boys tend to open up more in situations like this -- while <br/>
doing something). Anyways, it occured to me that part of the appeal <br/>
for me is this whole lifestyle and that there are other aspects that <br/>
we can discuss first that will pave the way to the idea of <br/>
unschooling -- ie parenting philosophies about chores/no chores, <br/>
communication, etc. Also, things that we have going for us is how we <br/>
have parented thus far (not long I know, since our daughter is not <br/>
even 2 yet!) -- from having a natural childbirth to using attachment <br/>
parenting prinicples... we have already started to do things in ways <br/>
that not many of our friends and family members do.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to try and print out little things for him to read once in <br/>
a while. Any input people have regarding good, to-the-point articles <br/>
would be much appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>

<br/>
The kind of parenting I do is just attachment parenting extended on  <br/>
through the years.  It&#39;s the same stuff they talked about when I was  <br/>
in La Leche League, but there most parents were sweet and  <br/>
accommodating until the child weaned and then it was back to the same- <br/>
old, and time to go to school.<br/>

<br/>
Fabian is still warming up to these new ideas, too. I scored big <br/>
when he agreed with me that schools are places where learning is <br/>
stunted, and that homeschooling would be better for Will and Elias.  <br/>
I&#39;m avoiding introducing the concept of  &quot;unschooling&quot; with him <br/>
until we&#39;re more established in our practice of parenting <br/>
peacefully, however. <br/>
<br/>
--I guess before I just jump into talking with him <br/>
about unschooling I really want to have a grasp on what unschooling <br/>
is, why I would want to do it and believe in it etc.-- <br/>
<br/>
After I&#39;d read some ideas I knew were good, I started doing.  I <br/>
began by adjusting my own attitude in the family circle.  I realized <br/>
that there were some areas where, not only was I being controlling <br/>
and disrespectful of 2-yo Will, I was doing the same to 30-yo <br/>
Fabian.  I apologized to him for my negative and untrusting attitude <br/>
toward his choices, particularly TV and Internet usage, and informed <br/>
him that I wanted to move my own actions in the direction of having <br/>
peace in my home.  I try to show Fabian how I&#39;m planning to respect <br/>
our children&#39;s choices by respecting his, too.  I&#39;m working on <br/>
building trust in my marriage, because I want Fabian to feel safe <br/>
and to be able to trust me in my role as the stay-at-home <br/>
unschooling parent. It&#39;s going to take a huge amount of trust in me <br/>
for him to be able to move toward trusting the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Some thoughts that helped me.  (You may be farther along in your <br/>
progress with these than I am, and if you are, your husband is that <br/>
much closer to understanding unschooling.):<br/>
<br/>
Consider everything you do to be a choice.  It will help you not to <br/>
resent the amount you give of yourself to your family.  Change the <br/>
way you speak about choices, too.  Your husband will hear the <br/>
difference, though he may not know what it is.  Hopefully, you may <br/>
hear the same change coming out of his mouth after a while.<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/haveto">http://sandradodd.com/haveto</a><br/>
<br/>
Consider your timing.  Sandra&#39;s right that the best times are when <br/>
something related to unschooling comes up in life.  Fabian <br/>
frequently comments on &quot;our incredibly smart kids!&quot; and I respond <br/>
with, &quot;Wow, you&#39;re right!  They&#39;re learning so much so fast.  I hope <br/>
we can do everything possible as they grow to give them the freedom <br/>
to learn as joyfully as they do now.&quot;  I give him the chance to <br/>
continue the topic, but I don&#39;t push it.  I point out the great <br/>
communication skills of some of the homeschooled kids we meet at <br/>
church.  I comment about awesome things I&#39;ve learned from the <br/>
internet as we&#39;re Googling our topics of interest.  I also carefully <br/>
avoid times when Fabian is overtired, hungry, upset or angry about <br/>
work, distracted and likely to be annoyed by chit-chat, or right <br/>
after I&#39;ve done something incredibly brick-headed, when he&#39;s more <br/>
likely to think I probably shouldn&#39;t be trusted with a pet, let <br/>
alone with children. <br/>
<br/>
Say &quot;Yes!&quot; to your husband.  You may be doing this already, but I <br/>
know there were areas where I wasn&#39;t and I had to adjust.  Before, I <br/>
felt like I needed to put reins on Fabian.  Why? Lack of trust and <br/>
fear of saying &quot;yes&quot; because maybe his project would &quot;fail&quot; or maybe <br/>
he would ask for my help and I wouldn&#39;t know what to do or maybe it <br/>
would cost money.  I realized that if I had those attitudes with <br/>
Fabian, I would never make it unschooling my kids.  I was being such <br/>
a nag!  I also had to see where I was placing a value of &quot;wasteful.&quot; <br/>
For example, it was not, in fact, a waste of money for Fabian to buy <br/>
a table saw, even though he only knew rudimentary carpentry at the <br/>
time.  It is not, in fact, a waste of time for him to spend an <br/>
evening surfing the Web.  I had to see this in my own mind.  I had <br/>
to see that it was not, in fact, a waste of paper for Will to play <br/>
with using the print function on the word processor, especially <br/>
since I was right there with him and we were talking up a storm <br/>
about what was printing and how it worked and the colors and wet ink <br/>
and how to make it print right side up on the reverse side.  What <br/>
would be a waste, then?  Would it be a waste of my children&#39;s <br/>
childhood for me to wait to implement these new principles?<br/>
More here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/">http://joyfullyrejoycing.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
Consider attachment parenting (OK, as I was writing this, the <br/>
conversation kept going and I see you already do.  Great!) Fabian <br/>
continues to be blessed by our family bed, because he&#39;s part of that <br/>
nighttime parenting that would otherwise have been restricted to me <br/>
as the breastfeeding mom.  He frequently awakens for a few moments <br/>
to murmer comforting words to 5-mo Elias while we&#39;re nursing or <br/>
while I&#39;m changing a diaper.  We are learning lots right now about <br/>
trusting our children to grow when they&#39;re ready while Will is <br/>
trying out the potty and thinking about weaning.  These are examples <br/>
you can draw on in discussion with your husband about natural <br/>
learning.    <br/>
<br/>
--My daughter is 20 months old.  I am thankful that I have come <br/>
across all of these ideas while my daughter is very young. --<br/>
<br/>
We are indeed fortunate to have found unschooling while our children <br/>
are young, Susan!  If I can become a mindful parent in my children&#39;s <br/>
babyhood, it will serve us as a family when the questions and the <br/>
activities really take off in a few years.  <br/>
<br/>
That reminds me.  I have a question for Sandra. I saw a blurb on <br/>
your site about how you disagree with the idea that unschooling <br/>
starts at birth, but I&#39;ve been scratching my head over it ever <br/>
since.  Have you written about it someplace? <br/>
<br/>
Hope I&#39;ve been helpful.  If anything I&#39;ve said is not on a good <br/>
unschooling track, PLEASE correct me!  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; a while. Any input people have regarding good, to-the-point articles<br/>
&gt; would be much appreciated! &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I print and put up cool quotes around my house where I can see them. I used <br/>
to save whole posts to reread later, but now it&#39;s easier to look in <br/>
archives. The cool quotes are great reminders of encapsulated ideas. Some of <br/>
them are my own - ideas about Jayn I want to reinforce in my memory, ideas <br/>
about actions that work.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started investigating Unschooling and mindful parenting, and to <br/>
be honest I can&#39;t remember what I said other than reporting various posts at <br/>
different times and leaving out books with short passages marked, I was <br/>
surprised by how much he already understood - deeply and intuitively - more <br/>
than me. I often am struck by how elegantly simple he can make it when we <br/>
have conversations.<br/>
<br/>
When he reads about Unschooling, such as the posted signs or book passages, <br/>
he always comes away puzzled - not with the content of what he has read, <br/>
because he is saying &quot;Duh!&quot; -  but puzzled at what my point was is showing <br/>
it to him. He is usually full of &quot;So? We already do this&quot; remarks.<br/>
<br/>
What is really crucial is to be cautious about reading material that a <br/>
husband might construe as criticising him. That is one thing I have learnt.<br/>
<br/>
I am so proud of James. A couple of weeks ago, Jayn was unexpectedly hungry <br/>
and having a big meltdown made bigger by hunger (before we pinpointed the <br/>
hunger aspect and realized that this was a growth spurt beginning). It was <br/>
the kind of behavior that even safe and private in one&#39;s own home, would <br/>
cause conventional parents to react punitively and harshly. At least my mom <br/>
would have. Instead of blaming Jayn, or seeing fault in her, James said to <br/>
me, &quot;We must be doing something wrong.&quot; I was in the midst of a maelstrom <br/>
(short lived I am happy to say) feeling all warm and loving because of how <br/>
insightful and just plain cool my husband is.<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone recommended one of the Conferences yet? This year will be the <br/>
last Live and Learn in SC in September, and there are regional ones <br/>
happening - two in May. It is still good to come even with a tiny baby - in <br/>
fact it may be easier to hear more speakers if you only have a baby, or <br/>
toddler who would be content playing with the pile of cool little-kid toys <br/>
collected at the back of the speaker room for that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s kind of a shameless plug, but James is speaking at L&L this year.<br/>

realization or read something that resonates so strongly with me, I&#39;ll  <br/>
share it with Clint and he reacts exactly like James.  It is  <br/>
reassuring too.  I&#39;ll think I wasn&#39;t doing that and Clint tells me I  <br/>
have been.  Kinda nice.  :-)<br/>

<h4>Sandra Dodd at 2008-02-24 03:06:59 +0200 said:</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1029694571">-=-That reminds me. I have a question for Sandra. I saw a blurb on<br/>
your site about how you disagree with the idea that unschooling<br/>
starts at birth, but I&#39;ve been scratching my head over it ever<br/>
since. Have you written about it someplace? -=-<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ve only written about it in discussions like these, and not  <br/>
for a long time because I feel like one of the very few who make the  <br/>
distinction.<br/>
<br/>
There are many facets of my objection to people with pre-verbal, non- <br/>
walking babies saying &quot;We&#39;re homeschooling,&quot; but the main one is that  <br/>
if a baby is in a stage that the state wouldn&#39;t require him to be in  <br/>
school, the parents are not yet at a point that they know with  <br/>
certainty that they will not put him in school when he&#39;s five or six.<br/>
<br/>
We have enough problems on the lists with families who really,  <br/>
unquestionably, registered-with-the-state (or whatever) are  <br/>
homeschooling, and trying to help them get settled in and calm  <br/>
without spending lots of time on the very speculative mothers of  <br/>
babies and toddlers who sometimes (perhaps starved for adult contact,  <br/>
a state I remember) will rattle ON and on and they sometimes have no  <br/>
experience to add to the conversations and the things we&#39;re talking  <br/>
about don&#39;t apply to them, because they have tiny children.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had three babies.   We were big into attachment parenting.  I  <br/>
think it&#39;s fantastic if people ask for attachment parenting advice  <br/>
because they intend to unschool when the kids are older, but I don&#39;t  <br/>
see any advantage or logic of calling it &quot;unschooling&quot; when school  <br/>
wasn&#39;t even an issue.<br/>
<br/>
The best counter-argument is a regional one.  In Delaware and  <br/>
Maryland and thereabout, lots of people seem to be putting babies in  <br/>
school at two or three, so it&#39;s important for those families to  <br/>
declare a fancy reason why they&#39;re NOT putting their kids in  <br/>
advanced, accelerated, college-preparatory nursery school.   That&#39;s  <br/>
what I&#39;ve heard from people over the years.<br/>
<br/>
There have been families where much noise was made, much drama  <br/>
unfolded,  much consideration made, and they said they were  <br/>
unschoolers (without any benefit to other unschoolers by that claim)  <br/>
and then they bought a curriculum or put a kid in school, so in my  <br/>
mind, it negates any claim or consideration of unschooling.  They  <br/>
never unschooled a school-aged child.  They schooled.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This part&#39;s more personal to me, and my preference for people to be  <br/>
scrupulously honest and open.  I count my unschooling from the day  <br/>
Kirby did not go to kindergarten when he was five, in a state in  <br/>
which that&#39;s expected/required.   We could&#39;ve made him an exception,  <br/>
so the first year could&#39;ve been a freebie.   We could&#39;ve put him in  <br/>
either first or kindergarten the next year, had we not been happy  <br/>
with the unschooling plan.   The district would&#39;ve been okay taking  <br/>
him as a six year old kindergartener if we told them we hadn&#39;t  <br/>
thought he was ready the year before.<br/>
<br/>
The kind of attachment parenting and food choices and sleep-when- <br/>
sleepy and that, I&#39;ve done since Kirby was a a baby. It wasn&#39;t  <br/>
unschooling, because we figured he would go to school when he got  <br/>
older.  It was parenting a young child.   It&#39;s February and Kirby&#39;s  <br/>
21, so I will say I&#39;ve been unschooling for 17 years.   17.5 years.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like it when someone comes to an unschooling discussion who&#39;s  <br/>
never heard of it before and starts to backdate their unschooling to  <br/>
birth.  I don&#39;t like it when someone who started unschooling after I  <br/>
did redefines her life in some fantasy autobiographical way and with  <br/>
no change other than a statement, says she&#39;s been unschooling since  <br/>
her kids were born.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s me.  It bugs me in the SCA when people claim to have been in for  <br/>
five  years just because they visited with a friend once.  I visited  <br/>
with friends, went to a meeting, but clearly did NOT join.  I&#39;d been  <br/>
to the organizational  meeting of the local group, and while that&#39;s  <br/>
interesting, I joined four years later and was surrounded already by  <br/>
people making claims to have been in longer than they had just  <br/>
because they knew about it, or stopped by a practice once where  <br/>
people weren&#39;t even in costume.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a profound, wonderful argument.  It has to do with integrity  <br/>
and practicality.<br/>

&gt;  I think I&#39;ve only written about it in discussions like these, and not<br/>
&gt;  for a long time because I feel like one of the very few who make the<br/>

<br/>
How fun. I&#39;ve been feeling very lonely about this.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  This part&#39;s more personal to me, and my preference for people to be<br/>
&gt;  scrupulously honest and open.  I count my unschooling from the day<br/>
&gt;  Kirby did not go to kindergarten when he was five, in a state in<br/>
&gt;  which that&#39;s expected/required.<br/>
<br/>
I have been fighting this for a while, and have kind of given up in<br/>
exhaustion, having other, better battles to fight. I started exploring<br/>
our options as a family for Rowan&#39;s schooling when he was three or so,<br/>
and naturally as he&#39;s grown up, the pressure has come on, and on, and<br/>
on harder, about labelling ourselves. Are we homeschoolers?<br/>
Unschoolers? What&#39;s our tribe, our affiliation, are we an &quot;us&quot; to be<br/>
embraced, or are we a &quot;them&quot; to be argued with or avoided?<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in California, and as per the law, I&#39;ll be filing our first R-4<br/>
this October 1st, the year he&#39;ll be 6 by December. But up until that<br/>
moment, I still say when it comes up in live conversation, &quot;we&#39;re not<br/>
schooling anything... he&#39;s little. We&#39;re doing kid stuff, you know,<br/>
playing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I find it really sad that that is hard even for folks exploring school<br/>
alternatives to accept. And here&#39;s what I wrote about that:<br/>
