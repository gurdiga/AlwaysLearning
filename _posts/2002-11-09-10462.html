<div id="ygrps-yiv-409310938"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; If you let a kid eat two Halloween candies every night, he <br/>
&gt; will eat it all.<br/>
&gt; If you let him eat all he wants,  he&#39;ll likely throw a bunch <br/>
&gt; away, or eat <br/>
&gt; some and let the rest sit.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had to laugh at this one...with all the candy they did eat (I posted<br/>
a couple of days back lamenting about getting rid of the candy restrictions<br/>
around halloween) they did leave some and have not touched it in the past day<br/>
or so. And it included kit kats, one of Jason&#39;s favorites. I also found<br/>
that Jason did not seem quite so possessive about his candy too, letting Kyle<br/>
have some (and not just the stuff Jason did not like).<br/>
<br/>
Now if he would just eat some more healthy stuff so I can breath a little easier.<br/>
Someone mentioned leaving healthy stuff more accessible...anyone have any suggestions<br/>
for healthy snackables? Jason loves muffins...any good recipes for good healthy muffins<br/>
(I can&#39;t seem to find my pumpkin muffin recipe lately). Or I am also in search of a <br/>
good whole wheat pancake recipe...<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions...I do leave apples and grapes out and around. Jason is not into <br/>
sandwiches much, although he did start liking grilled cheese again.<br/>

of cut up vegies and dip in the fridge.  When my kids were little, they&#39;d<br/>
eat oranges if they were already cut up, but wouldn&#39;t ever peel and eat one.<br/>

Maybe slices of cheese and /or meat with crackers, or some of that string<br/>
cheese. They make fruit cups now, small and packaged like those little<br/>
puddings.  You could make your own trail mix with raisins and nuts and<br/>
seeds  and put it in little cups or bags.  Banana chips, if he likes<br/>
those, they&#39;re sweet but can be a kind of hard. There are other dried<br/>
fruits but that might be an acquired taste.  Yogurt?  Jerky? <br/>
<br/>
I have a muffin recipe that&#39;s egg and dairy free, maybe you don&#39;t want<br/>
that.<br/>
Was it this list someone was wanting vegetarian recipes for their<br/>
daughter?  Was that Julie?  I can send some Dylan likes.   I&#39;m sorry, I<br/>
lost that post. ( along with my mind )  <br/>

they&#39;re very convenient and the carrots are so sweet.  Also, if kids eat<br/>
dried fruit, you might want to encourage them to eat cheese after.  I was<br/>
told by a dental hygienist that the cheese cleans off the sticky stuff left<br/>
by the dried fruit.<br/>

The grocery stores are starting to carry dried peaches.  Dried apples are <br/>
easy for kids to like.<br/>

Dried fruit can be constipating since it absorbs water as it goes thru the <br/>
body.<br/>
