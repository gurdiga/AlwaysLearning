<div id="ygrps-yiv-1730918526">*Tell him how words are spelled. Always. NICELY :D<br/>
*Write/type for him<br/>
*Stop quizzing him<br/>
*Breathe. There are FAR more important things in the world than a child<br/>
knowing how to spell.<br/>
<br/>
Hayden&#39;s always asked and I&#39;ve always answered.<br/>
His friends on skype will ask him how to spell things, knowing if he doesn&#39;t<br/>
know I will spell it for them.<br/>
It&#39;s truly a non-issue in our life.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-86061995">My MIL (former teacher) is forever hounding us about &#39;teaching<br/>
spelling&#39;( fyi. . this includes intercepted letters to the boys<br/>
telling them they need to learn to spell with materials included,<br/>
screened phone messages reminding them to study spelling, etc etc)  At<br/>
first, I was angry, I knew my boys were creative spellers (LOL) but I<br/>
felt adamant about not ruining their love of words through formalized<br/>
spelling lessons.  Then it happened. When my eldest turned 8.5 he<br/>
could spell the majority of anything he chose to write correctly<br/>
whereas just a month or so before almost every word was incorrectly<br/>
spelled. No lessons, no grandma spelling materials. .. just life. My<br/>
advice. . answer his questions, stop fretting. . . and trust. Oh, and<br/>
if someone is harrassing you akin to my MIL, use that to fuel your<br/>
trust that he will learn to spell. I wonder if I had not be so annoyed<br/>
with MIL whether I would have done more fretting. . .I am thankful<br/>
that I had a different focus ( not certain MIL will forgive but. . .)<br/>
Your son loves to read, he loves words, spelling will come. . .don&#39;t<br/>
squash a good thing. Sarah<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1710977450">Kirby (22) isn&#39;t a great speller, but he&#39;s a very good writer.    The  <br/>
work he does involves real-time writing with people--not reports that  <br/>
can be reviewed and polished up, but writing directly to co-workers  <br/>
and to games players in the moment.  Sometimes he doesn&#39;t spell well,  <br/>
but he always knows what he&#39;s talking about!   And I married his dad,  <br/>
who was NOT a speller when he was 22.  But he has gotten steadily  <br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby spells better than Keith (his dad, my husband) did when Keith  <br/>
was 22.  I have the love letters to prove this, if need be. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something to consider clearly, though:<br/>
Keith went to kindergarten, K-12, and had had two years of college.<br/>
Kirby went to nothing until he took a math class and a &quot;how to succeed  <br/>
in college&quot; sort of class when he was 18 or 19 (I wish I could  <br/>
remember numbers better).<br/>
<br/>
Keith had lots of spelling lessons.<br/>
Kirby had not a one.<br/>
<br/>
Marty doesn&#39;t write much.  His spelling is about the same way.  He  <br/>
confuses homonyms sometimes.  He confuses -er and -or but so do most  <br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
Holly, same lack of lessons, same lack of school, but she spells much  <br/>
better than the boys do.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1702953743">-We do not drill or test in my home, but our whole family just loves <br/>
spelling games.Things we play are spelling bees when in the car, <br/>
where we will rattle off words for the kids to spell. Or we will play <br/>
a game where we state a catagory such as animals or cities and one <br/>
person will say a name such as New York and the next player has to <br/>
come up with a word that begins with the last letter in the name ( in <br/>
this example the letter K).  I will also without a word sit down to <br/>
one of my kids and do a word search puzzle, the whole time having a <br/>
conversation with myself such as man, this word &quot;frankenstein&quot; is <br/>
really giving me a problem, I can not seem to find it. Or say how <br/>
interesting a certain word is, pretty much ignoring my child however <br/>
before long they can not resist mom&#39;s having fun and start helping <br/>
find the words or point out words that are interesting to them. We <br/>
play hangman which is becoming a favorite for my second grade <br/>
daughter, we play in a room where there are many words on the walls <br/>
so when it is her turn, she can look at a word and know how to spell <br/>
it, all I have to do is bury my face in a book when she is searching <br/>
for a word so I do not see what word she is looking at. There are <br/>
posters and all sorts of things on the walls with many words for her <br/>
to choose from.  We play boggle, scrabble, fill in the blank word <br/>
games. My kids both love BookWorm Adventures which is a computer <br/>
software game designed for kids where they have to spell yet in a <br/>
game form. I also put up a blog site for each of my kids and they <br/>
LOVE writing on these blogs, and learn how to use spell check as well <br/>
and this has been improving writing and spelling skills tremendously. <br/>
I also keep putting up interesting links for them on their blog sites <br/>
for them to explore at will. We sit down and write letters to <br/>
grandma . I have them tell me a story while we tape record it then I <br/>
type up their story for them. When they ask how to spell something I <br/>
tell them. If they ask a question on how to spell a word that has a <br/>
spelling rule, I tell them the spelling rule such as I before E <br/>
except after C or When 2 vowels go a walking, the first one does the <br/>
talking, THEN tell them how to spell it. We use letter tiles to make <br/>
up words. We play memory with words they have to match. One thing my <br/>
kids LOVED was going to a graveyard with crayons and blank paper and <br/>
doing tombstone rubbings where they placed the paper on a graveyard <br/>
stone and used the crayon to bring out the name onto paper. We make <br/>
words out of homemade playdough. A family game is to give each person <br/>
a letter (the letters make up a whole word) the first person says My <br/>
letter is T, it sounds like Tih, the second person my letter is r it <br/>
sounds like rrrrrrr, the third person e, the fourth person my letter <br/>
is e it sounds like eeeeeeeeee the word is Tree.( this game was <br/>
actually taken off of a Little House on the Prairie to teach a boy to <br/>
read however it works great for spelling too!)<br/>
<br/>
Okay this is all the things I can think of that we all play as games <br/>
and my kids enjoy . Sorry it is such a lenghty response!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-722252765">Even though I had been unschooling my daughter, Lanora, for a few years I<br/>
had not completely let go of ideas about what they should know and when they<br/>
should know it.  When she was about 9 she was a great reader and spoke well<br/>
but her spelling was awful BUT I sat on my lips and determined to leave it<br/>
alone.  I resisted the urge to push or prod and say things like &quot;look it up&quot;<br/>
when she asked how something was spelled.  I just answered her question<br/>
nicely.<br/>
<br/>
One day she announced that she wanted to learn to spell and asked if I would<br/>
help.  I said, &quot;Sure, just let me know what you&#39;d like me to do&quot;.  She began<br/>
to spell almost everything she laid her eyes on, all she wanted from me is<br/>
to confirm if it was correct.  Within 2 weeks she was spelling as well as<br/>
any high school student and could probably go up against most college<br/>
students.<br/>
<br/>
My inner control freak breathed a sigh of relief but it was the last time I<br/>
fretted over what she was learning and when, spelling was nothing compared<br/>
to the big picture.  She wanted to learn something and never thought she<br/>
needed &quot;teaching&quot;, she was in control and found her own way to the goal.<br/>
That was MY lesson, all I had to do was back off and I got to watch how<br/>
trusting her and letting go gave her the room and power to learn on her own<br/>
terms.<br/>
<br/>
Or I could have loaded her with spelling lists, reminding, prodding and<br/>
fretting.  She probably would have learned to spell but also doubt her<br/>
ability to learn and feel the need to be taught.  I&#39;d rather she still not<br/>
spell very well but trust herself.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well put!<br/>
<br/>
Rosie, who is now 18, didn&#39;t read at all until she was about 8 years <br/>
old, then picked it up quickly. But her spelling was just terrible. <br/>
She&#39;d write  like this: &quot;Iy se a cta,&quot; and then in the next sentence, &quot;I <br/>
lenk mi act.&quot;  (I see a cat. I like my cat.)  Even she couldn&#39;t read <br/>
what she&#39;d written if she picked it up a bit later. The letters were all <br/>
out of order and she very often threw in extra letters for no apparent <br/>
reason - she&#39;d toss &quot;n&#39;s&quot; in all over the place.<br/>
<br/>
At 13 or so, she was spending a lot of time online and IMing with <br/>
friends, who constantly IMed her back with, &quot;Huh?&quot; She asked me to spell <br/>
things for her constantly - but really she needed help with almost every <br/>
word, not just a few words. Then she did NaNoWriMo. Wrote a 50,000 word <br/>
novel in a month. She didn&#39;t show it to anybody so I can&#39;t tell you how <br/>
the spelling was, but she wrote it in Microsoft Word and used the spell <br/>
checker. She says that was what turned her spelling around for her. <br/>
Well, that and one other discovery - she could look at a list of ways to <br/>
spell a word: cta, act, cat, tca, tac, and she could pick the correct <br/>
one out of the list. But even immediately after doing that, she couldn&#39;t <br/>
picture how to spell it. So, when Word guessed what she was trying to <br/>
spell and gave her enough choices, she could pick the right one out of <br/>
the list. She had to get close enough for Word to give her a list that <br/>
included the correct word, so it wasn&#39;t an immediate fix, but she slowly <br/>
got better and better at it and then the spell checker worked well for <br/>
her. Over the next few years she wrote a lot - did NaNoWriMo again every <br/>
year plus ScriptFrenzy which is writing a screenplay.  Her spelling is <br/>
good now. She&#39;s 18 and a college student. No fear - total ownership over <br/>
her own ability to learn in her own way and in her own time!<br/>
<br/>
My knees feel weak when I think about what could have been done to her <br/>
in the name of helping her with what would have been called her learning <br/>
disabilities. I tremble. She is so confident and sure of herself now, I <br/>
am so grateful we found unschooling in time to avoid any damage at all <br/>
to her learning abilities. She was just 4 when we started unschooling, <br/>
so she had absolutely no pressure placed on her and no teaching done to her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I made up this game in the car years ago.  I would spell out loud some  <br/>
word I knew was in the kids&#39; vocabulary, and they&#39;d guess the word.   <br/>
It&#39;s a different skill, seeing the letters spelled in your head to  <br/>
form a word, but it&#39;s really fun and helpful.<br/>
<br/>
The trick to learning to spell is to NEVER spell the word wrong; it&#39;s  <br/>
like the recommendation in music to always practice perfectly (no  <br/>
matter how slow!).   If your son needs to spell because he&#39;s writing,  <br/>
ask what words he wants to use, then write them out for him to copy.   <br/>
The errors people make when they&#39;re little are the ones that stick, so  <br/>
try to avoid that.  Also, the words kids misspell on tests, which then  <br/>
come back with a big red check next to them, get burned into the memory.<br/>
<br/>
Lastly, most unschoolers will tell you you don&#39;t need to be at your  <br/>
wits&#39; end, and you don&#39;t need to teach him.  Model enjoyment of  <br/>
language by looking up words for fun; play Scrabble, Jumble or other  <br/>
word games, with him or without.   Leave a dictionary in the  <br/>
bathroom :-)<br/>

two hours at night, with no booklights or GameBoys, from grandma&#39;s  <br/>
house to home.  It worked great &lt;g&gt; and turned out to be a really  <br/>

gain speed, expression, fluidity, etc.<br/>

played the piece more slowly while first sight reading it, he most  <br/>
likely would not have made the mistake at all, practicing to fluency  <br/>
while unaware it was wrong.  I play new pieces very slowly indeed,  <br/>
because I&#39;m still learning intonation and fingering; I use a keyboard  <br/>
to help me find the right tone.  For me, that *is* fun playing music :-)<br/>

The original poster asked a question about teaching spelling.  There  <br/>

ignore all of the extraneous stuff and just answer with what I did, as  <br/>
an unschooler.  My assumption, as an unschooler, is that the child is  <br/>
interested in the topic at hand, whatever it may be.  Word games of  <br/>
any kind, frequent use of dictionaries, always seeing words spelled  <br/>
correctly, etc., are among the things my unschooling family did, and  <br/>
we are all good spellers.<br/>

collecting letters to make a word...)   It was all just for fun, but  <br/>

Btw, despite being a stickler for &quot;correct&quot; spelling from myself, a<br/>
little creativity from my son doesn&#39;t bother me because, really, I<br/>
agree with him that it makes perfect sense to spell words as they<br/>
sound. I just was trained out of doing that. Overall, his spelling&#39;s<br/>
good enough for the &quot;real world&quot; and there are more important things<br/>
in our lives. So I haven&#39;t taught him the strategy yet and he hasn&#39;t<br/>
asked. Perhaps it will come up in conversation one day, perhaps it<br/>
won&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
But, if my son&#39;s spelling was a cause for concern, this is definitely<br/>
what I would suggest to him.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I play the cello, too. But I&#39;m not trying to get better - I play for <br/>
right now, for the fun of it. I have some books of music from musicals, <br/>
for example, and I play those as close to full speed as I can, even <br/>
though I make mistakes, because it is more fun that way. I don&#39;t play <br/>
with anybody else or for anybody else, so it isn&#39;t hurting anybody even <br/>
if I make the same mistakes over and over.<br/>
<br/>
But, honestly, that isn&#39;t my experience.<br/>
<br/>
In dance, some people like to start slow and do the steps absolutely <br/>
correctly from the beginning and slowly speed up, and other people like <br/>
to do the dance close to full speed and slowly improve the accuracy of <br/>
the steps. Turns out that those who do it the latter way end up looking  <br/>
more natural and more relaxed, so that is the preferred method of <br/>
teaching dance for musical theater.<br/>
<br/>
In the past though, when I was trying to learn a new piece on my cello <br/>
that I was going to perform, I&#39;d do both. I&#39;d go very slowly and make <br/>
sure I did it right, so that my fingers and arms could get the feeling <br/>
of the right moves, but I&#39;d sometimes switch and play it best I could at <br/>
full speed and sometimes I&#39;d even play it at a very rapid speed. Pushing <br/>
the speed helps turn i it into muscle memory and not intellect.<br/>
<br/>
That all said, I think Rosie would have enjoyed the game Nancy <br/>
described, and it would have made her feel good to know she could handle <br/>
that aspect of spelling.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to eliminate a game from our lives because it supports <br/>
learning some particular thing. My kids loved all kinds of games and <br/>
many of those games were developed to supposedly teach some particular <br/>
skill or concept - but my kids didn&#39;t care about the intent, they cared <br/>
if the game was fun and part of the fun was very often gaining greater <br/>
understanding of that intended skill or concept. The Logical Journey of <br/>
the Zoombinis is a good example of that. I carry a little game around <br/>
with me in my purse called, &quot;Math Dice.&quot; I know it is marketed as a way <br/>
for kids to learn and practice arithmetic, but it IS a really fun game <br/>
and I pull it out when we&#39;re waiting in a restaurant, etc. My kids don&#39;t <br/>
object to playing it just because of how it is marketed.<br/>
<br/>
I also don&#39;t see what is wrong with a parent choosing to introduce <br/>
something to their kids. I made up playing the game &quot;Battleship&quot; with <br/>
cartesian coordinates because I thought it was fun and that the kids <br/>
would be interested in how the cartesian coordinate system works. I know <br/>
for sure Rosie was really interested in spelling and she&#39;d have liked a <br/>
game that let her pursue that interest in a successful and pleasurable way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-752597802">Spelling.  I probably know dozens of doctors and lawyers who don&#39;t<br/>
spell at all well, and have worked for a number of them.  Not to<br/>
mention the College of Medicine students and political science majors<br/>
who were my co-students at university.  A couple of them were my<br/>
student workers when I was secretary in the Art Department.  Some were<br/>
whizzes at memorization, had very high practical skills and logic and<br/>
couldn&#39;t spell.  Their strengths were in things other than spelling.<br/>
<br/>
They compensate for bad spelling by hiring secretaries like me who<br/>
*can* spell, and proof and compose their correspondence for them.<br/>
They use hand held voice activated tape recorders for going back over<br/>
their lecture notes with, since their own endless scribbles of notes<br/>
written at lightning speed are often illegible.  I edited and<br/>
formatted theses as a side job.  What is hard for some is easy for<br/>
someone else.  Even students can hire secretaries occasionally when<br/>
they can&#39;t make it to the writing center for help on papers.<br/>
<br/>
Some resources for getting the details right on spelling and writing:<br/>
dictionaries, grammar reference books, computer spellchecker, Dragon<br/>
software for computer dictation (fine for rough drafts to be proofed<br/>
later), tape recorded dictation and other people.  Etc.  Those are<br/>
also things which secretaries use regularly in their jobs.<br/>
<br/>
Basically students focus on the stuff they&#39;re being tested on.  It&#39;s<br/>
rare indeed that they&#39;re asked to spell or hand write on tests, other<br/>
than filling in their name, date, ID number, etc.  Tests, often these<br/>
super long deals, are fill in the bubble, and made to sent through a<br/>
machine.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t want to worry about spelling.  Some people are good at it<br/>
and many people are very successful without ever being good at it.<br/>

your post.  Nancy&#39;s approach works well for people who learn primarily<br/>
through speech, and have good audio memory of letter order.  Karl and<br/>
Brian his dad are good at memorizing musical information and Brian<br/>
plays several instruments well by ear.  But Brian can&#39;t hear<br/>
&quot;spelling.&quot;  I can&#39;t either.  Brian doesn&#39;t spell as well as I do, and<br/>
when he writes anything I&#39;m the one he asks for help in correcting<br/>

constant love of reading and writing.  Which, for me, is probably very<br/>
close to 100% visual.<br/>

blurbs about it.  Several of the steps in the NLP spelling strategy<br/>
are things I used to do when encountering words I had just read and<br/>
wanted to remember the spelling of.  I even do it with numbers.. phone<br/>
numbers especially and using a mental adding machine or mental phone<br/>
keypad is my preferred method.  I press the number in midair or on a<br/>
forearm as though I&#39;m making the call.<br/>

think that things that are educational in nature are necessarily negative. I <br/>
would think that the games we all play with our kids, self-devised or from <br/>
outside sources probably support learning many wonderful things.<br/>
<br/>
I was making a point about parental intention in general, not Nancy&#39;s <br/>
intention with her kids that particular day.<br/>
<br/>
Yes the original poster did ask a question about teaching.<br/>
<br/>
I think in the case of a parent worried and wanting to get ideas for <br/>
teaching, for us to make the assumption that the child in question is <br/>
interested in the topic is a big assumption. Especially in this case the <br/>
person is anonymous and may have only a tenuous understanding of <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
My concern was to point out that  to someone asking about teaching the <br/>
answer shouldn&#39;t be &quot;Unschooling is about making teaching fun!&quot; even by <br/>

I agree the words Kathryn took the longest to learn how to spell  <br/>
correctly were the ones she&#39;d written (and thus seen) wrong the  <br/>
longest. But she got over that and spells fine at 17.<br/>
<br/>
I think preventing kids from never spelling a word wrong would cause  <br/>
way more stress than correcting a reinforced wrong spelling.  <br/>
Unschoolers shouldn&#39;t be *afraid* of kids getting things wrong.  <br/>
Unschoolers also shouldn&#39;t be afraid to point out something wrong,  <br/>
especially if it will send them off in a wrong direction. But *ask*  <br/>
them so you can get a feel for what they want help with. It might not  <br/>

for 3 weeks while she was at camp. That was tough to undo! But I did  <br/>
and can&#39;t remember the wrong way now.<br/>
<br/>
I can see two processes (so far) in the learning. One is the muscle  <br/>
memory where your fingers move through a song by rote. The other is a  <br/>
more general knowing how to move your fingers over the instrument.  <br/>
The first comes from playing one song over and over. The second comes  <br/>
from learning many songs. The interesting thing is that the first  <br/>
gives incremental help with the second, but the second can help with  <br/>
the first. You can get better at playing one song, even if you don&#39;t  <br/>
practice it, by learning other songs.<br/>
<br/>
Another piece of the learning is keeping up with the song, even if  <br/>
you skip notes or make mistakes. Being off tempo (is that the right  <br/>
word?) is way more noticeable than a wrong note ;-) iTunes is awesome  <br/>
for that kind of practice :-) You can loop a piece of a song  <br/>
continuously.<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Joyce.<br/>
<br/>
If I&#39;m &quot;training&quot; to play a song in a recital, and there&#39;s a  <br/>
deadline, and I want to focus on doing that, then playing it slowly  <br/>
but carefully and building up to speed might be the most efficient  <br/>
way to do that.  But if I&#39;m practicing sight reading, for the joy of  <br/>
seeing how well I can do it, then I&#39;m not &quot;learning a song,&quot; I&#39;m  <br/>
sight reading.  And sight reading gets better when it&#39;s done more  <br/>
recklessly.  Those afraid of making a mistake won&#39;t be brave enough  <br/>
to sight read vocal music.  That really involves some sliding around  <br/>
sometimes when a part isn&#39;t well known, and playing it on the piano  <br/>
until you know what it sounds like is not at all sight reading.<br/>
<br/>
With recorder, the instrument I can best do by ear (not counting  <br/>
voice) OR by music, everything I know about music from any direction  <br/>
comes into use.  But I know the instrument well enough that if I know  <br/>
the tune in my head I can play it on the recorder.  I might make a  <br/>
mistake, but when I&#39;ve figured out what that one interval is (from  <br/>
guessing wrong and finding the right note), it helps me with every  <br/>
other song in the future that has that particular jump.<br/>
<br/>
So if spelling is like music (and watching Holly learn to spell, I  <br/>
think for some people it can be), then the more words she knows, the  <br/>
more she can sort through words and see what&#39;s similar and what&#39;s  <br/>
part of a set or pattern, and what&#39;s an exception.<br/>
<br/>
Because of my lifelong interest in the history of words, when my kids  <br/>
have asked how to spell something, I&#39;ve usually told them two  <br/>
things:  The spelling, and the why of it, VERY briefly.  It helps  <br/>
them remember.<br/>
<br/>
The spelling of the number two is easier to remember if one knows it  <br/>
was once pronounced &quot;twa&quot; and that it&#39;s the root of &quot;twin,&quot; &quot;twice&quot;  <br/>
and lots of other such words.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly asked me about some word...  She&#39;s asleep so I can&#39;t  <br/>
ask.  It was about the adjective form of some word that&#39;s been in  <br/>
English from Norman French for many hundreds of years.  We have the  <br/>
French form and the English form.  You can end it with &quot;-ful&quot; or &quot;- <br/>
ment&quot;--either the English form or the French.  They have slightly  <br/>
different connotations.    (I&#39;ll ask her later if she remembers what  <br/>
word it was.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m as interested in English as some people are in Sodoku or  <br/>
automotive history.  It&#39;s easy for me because it&#39;s fun.  That&#39;s the  <br/>
idea behind lots of learning.  Music, too!   Someone playing by ear  <br/>
can&#39;t possibly go error-free, and someone learning to read or spell  <br/>
on  her own can&#39;t either.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1512582260">--I also don&#39;t see what is wrong with a parent choosing to introduce<br/>
something to their kids. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I see great wrong in parents choosing NOT to introduce things, in  <br/>
parents avoiding saying or doing something because they second-guess  <br/>
themselves and decide &quot;it might not be unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Creating a rich learning life IS going to include history and science  <br/>
and language and math and music and art and movement and nature and  <br/>
what people do for a living and how buildings are made and where  <br/>
water flows and what grows around your house and where and what helps  <br/>
it or hurts it.<br/>
<br/>
To be too teacherly is bad.<br/>
<br/>
To be absolutely avoidant of anything that resembles anything that&#39;s  <br/>
ever been on anyone&#39;s school curriculum is worse.<br/>
<br/>
TALK to your kids, but don&#39;t lecture them.  Help them without  <br/>
quizzing them.  But surround them with interesting things and samples  <br/>
and examples and opportunities to see, hear, touch, smell and taste.<br/>
<br/>
Any parent afraid she&#39;s not doing enough should do more, but NOT in  <br/>
the way of being a teacher.  In the way of being an interesting,  <br/>
supportive partner.<br/>

this example the letter K). -=-<br/>

My cousin Nada and I used to play word games when we were in bed but  <br/>
not asleep yet.  We shared a bed until we were 12 or so, and a room  <br/>
until I was 14 and moved into the canning room (a half-underground  <br/>
room off the kitchen with a full wall of shelves over an unfinished  <br/>
adobe wall).<br/>
<br/>
The most fun was a rhythmic thing that I think is supposed to go with  <br/>
bouncing a ball, but we just played it in the bed.   You&#39;re supposed  <br/>
to do it without breaking rhythm anyway, and you have to fill in the  <br/>
blanks with same-letter-starting words:<br/>
<br/>
My name is Alice<br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s name is Andy<br/>

We live in Alabama<br/>
<br/>
And we sell Apples<br/>
<br/>
and the other person does B, and then you do C, until someone is  <br/>
stuck and then it&#39;s something to giggle about.<br/>

were just used.<br/>

My friend Robert Torrez and I went to district.  He missed lightning,  <br/>

I agree.  I don&#39;t mind it making learning fun, but the next step  <br/>
beyond that is to make learning so much a part of life that there is  <br/>
no &quot;learning&quot; outside of other moments, activities, breathing.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-150204789">Smack in the middle of a whole bunch of fun games and ideas about playing <br/>
around with words I stumbled over this   :)<br/>
<br/>
**If they ask a question on how to spell a word that has a spelling rule, I <br/>
tell them the spelling rule such as...   When 2 vowels go a walking, the first <br/>
one does the talking, THEN tell them how to spell it.**<br/>
<br/>
Oh, please don&#39;t tell them that as a rule, unless you&#39;re going to point it <br/>
out as a thing people say that only sometimes occasionally works! Perceptive <br/>
kids may notice that in that &quot;rule&quot; the only instance of paired vowels breaks the <br/>
rule. :)<br/>
<br/>
And a personal plea - please please break up long posts with paragraphing. <br/>
Just randomly, if necessary. I have old eyes and I have a hard time keeping them <br/>
on track without that help. :)   This isn&#39;t a plea for short posts, btw! Lots <br/>
of information is a good thing.<br/>
