sponsored/funded homeschooling or independent study or <br/>
whatever-they-happen-to-be-named programs are called in most other states.<br/>
<br/>
It is beyond me why some homeschoolers want to let some state&#39;s legal <br/>
statutes define who among us are &quot;real&quot; homeschoolers. If we did that here in <br/>
California, NONE of us would be homeschoolers - all homeschoolers in <br/>
California are either private schoolers, public schoolers, or tutored by a <br/>
credentialed teacher. Or we&#39;re underground which means that, according to <br/>
state statutes, our children are truant. No such thing as homeschooling here. <br/>
Amazing how there are thousands of people calling themselves homeschoolers in <br/>
a state where there&#39;s no such thing, technically, in the statutes. I think <br/>
that those people who are so adamant that people in those AEP&#39;s should follow <br/>
the statutes and not call themselves homeschoolers ought to think harder <br/>
about the repercussions of insisting that homeschoolers call themselves what <br/>
the government arbitrarily decides to call them. <br/>

<br/>
We might be homeschoolers who belong to a private cover school. We don&#39;t call <br/>
ourselves &quot;private cover schoolers.&quot; We call ourselves homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We might be homeschoolers who get legal by sending notification to some <br/>
school district superintendent. We might even have to put up with home <br/>
visitations by some school district personnel. We don&#39;t call ourselves <br/>
&quot;legally notifieders&quot; or &quot;home visteders&quot; - we just call ourselves <br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We might be homeschoolers who belong to a charter school. We don&#39;t call <br/>
ourselves &quot;charter schoolers&quot; - we call ourselves homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
We might be underground and, legally our kids are truants. We don&#39;t call <br/>
ourselves truant. We call ourselves homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Or we might be homeschoolers that belong to a public school program.  We <br/>
don&#39;t call ourselves public schoolers, we call ourselves homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
There are b&#39;zillion different ways to make ourselves legal as homeschoolers. <br/>
And some of us don&#39;t bother. We choose among the options available to us <br/>
based on financial, personal, and legal situations. Why pick out ONE of those <br/>
ways and complain when those people call themselves homeschoolers? If you&#39;re <br/>
going to let the law define who is a homeschooler and who isn&#39;t - if the <br/>
people in the AEP&#39;s are not homeschooling, then neither is ANYBODY in the <br/>
entire State of California - since we have no homeschooling law. And neither <br/>
is ANYBODY who is underground. <br/>
<br/>
This has been SO hurtful to so many people -- people should really stop and <br/>
think about what it might feel like to be enrolled in a public school <br/>
homeschooling program and get told, repeatedly, by other homeschoolers, that <br/>
&quot;I have no problem with you doing that, but just don&#39;t call yourself a <br/>
homeschooler.&quot;<br/>

I hope you read further into the topic than where you quoted and now understand why I said what I did, and why I feel the way I do.<br/>
<br/>
We here in Washington are not yet in the situation you in California are, and quite honestly I think that is what we are trying to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
I digress, I guess I should never have spoken my mind to begin with.<br/>

people get upset if the sentence is altered to &quot;I have no problem with<br/>
you doing that, but just don&#39;t call yourself an unschooler.&quot;<br/>
