<div id="ygrps-yiv-1309384260">I&#39;m not sure if my question is relevant to the list, since it doesn&#39;t deal with the philosophy of unschooling.  But if you reckon it&#39;s okay, I&#39;d love to get some recommendations. <br/>
Thanks, either way!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m hoping for some recommendations for computer games for my son (5 years old).<br/>
<br/>
My son enjoys playing iPod and iPad apps, so I&#39;ve been trying to figure out which computer game set up (& which games) to get next (Wii or Kinnect? Eg). Does anyone have any suggestions? Or any Apps that they like particularly, too.<br/>
<br/>
My son really loves Dinosaur Train videos and games. He also enjoys Curious George, Sid the Science Kid, and The Cat in the Hat. We have a Tonka Construction computer game which he likes, too. Construction, machines, Lego and Dinosaurs (& other prehistoric creatures) are his main interests right now, though he&#39;s also very interested in science experiment kits and games, and actually seems to enjoy lots of puzzles and the like from the app store . I bought a drawing app which seemed like a mini photoshop, and he did like that too.<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t like too much drama, or gore at the moment (like dinosaurs eating each other).<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas? <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-412170343">He might really love playing Minecraft in single-player, creative mode with the mobs (monsters) turned off (choose &#39;peaceful&#39; mode).  It&#39;s a 3-d building game, like virtual Legos.  It&#39;s played on the computer, and I think recently available for a console, but not sure which one. <br/>

<br/>
Another favorite resource for games is: www.armorgames.com<br/>
They&#39;re all free.  Noor loved &#39;Fancy Pants&quot; when she was younger and some of the puzzle games. The Dino game is a tad scary, with extinction at the end.<br/>
<br/>
The Smithsonian Dinosaur app is fantastic.  Not a game, but very cool for Dino-loving kids.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t speak to the consoles. We have a Wii, but Michael plays with it more than Noor. <br/>

I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re familiar with the yahoo group Unschooling Gamers.<br/>
The parents on that list are quite knowledgeable when it comes to computer<br/>
and video games for all ages.  You might want to check it out, if you&#39;re<br/>
not already a member.  I&#39;ve even gotten advice on DIY computer<br/>
repair/upgrades from those helpful folks.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a huge fan of Minecraft.  My daughter prefers to play on creative mode<br/>
and builds just about anything her mind can imagine.  Also, she learned to<br/>
read and spell while playing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1606067967">Zoo Tycoon has a dinosaur expansion pack. <br/>
If he likes machines and puzzle games he might enjoy The Incredible Machine, or Contraptions, or World of Goo. <br/>
<br/>
Minecraft has the ability to spawn dinosaurs - you&#39;ll need to download the &quot;mod&quot; once you have Minecraft set up. They won&#39;t spawn on plain creative mode (I think) but you can play on the &quot;easy&quot; setting and build your own dinosaur farm. Mo&#39;s been having fun with that recently. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1125106574">Thank you all so much for the gaming ideas! The practical suggestions are very useful (and a lot of fun!).<br/>
And it&#39;s been so helpful to find this group, and read the various posts that have gone by over the last few years. It has been helping me gradually lose my fearfulness, and the subsequent controlling dynamic that that fear creates. Our family is really just beginning to unschool (my son is 5, so next year is when he would be officially beginning homeschooling where we live). But just for now, I can see in this specific way, it has been a very profound gift to our family to be able to actually simply enjoy playing a few computer games and getting excited about more.<br/>
So thank you,<br/>

I&#39;m going to make another plug for FlipPix Art, which Marty is playing in the next room, trying to finish the newish San Francisco game before I leave tomorrow for England (with the iPad).  <br/>
<br/>
Keith got an iPad at work.  He asked Holly to ask me for the name of that game.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce Fetteroll&#39;s husband is playing it, and now people he works with are playing it.  <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a new game called FlipPix Holidays (very American use of the word, and American holidays, but still....) but it&#39;s just for Android tablets (and not phones) at this point.  I&#39;m hoping any day now it will be in the Apple App store for iPads.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://gabysoft.com/FlipPix-Art.aspx">http://gabysoft.com/FlipPix-Art.aspx</a><br/>
<br/>
That tells about the games.  Young kids can play the 5x5 grids.  If you get Kids or Model Planes or San Francisco, they&#39;ll let you play with a 5x5 grid.  The others, I think, are either 10x10 or 15x15, after the first two screens or always.<br/>
<br/>
Marty says you never have to guess.  If you look, there will be information.<br/>
Sometimes I use a clue.  They&#39;ll give you three.<br/>
<br/>
Plants vs. Zombies is great too, especially if you can use a touch screen (Kindle or iPad).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-829789888">===so I&#39;ve been trying to figure out which computer game set up (& which games) to get next (Wii or Kinnect? Eg)===<br/>
<br/>
My son is 8 and he actually really enjoys our Playstation 2.  You can buy them relatively cheap from a pawn shop, flea market, or yard sale, and you can find the games everywhere for a decent price.  My son is really enjoying the skateboarding games (mostly Tony Hawk ones) right now.  We find the games at yard sales and flea markets for $2-$7.  Even though it&#39;s not the most advanced system out there, he likes it because we have it set up in his room on a small TV so he doesn&#39;t have to worry about anyone else watching a show when he wants to play.  Plus the PS2 plays DVDs, so he can watch those in his room as well with this set up.  We like the PS2 because when he is ready for a new game, it doesn&#39;t cost us much to help him with that. <br/>
<br/>
===Or any Apps that they like particularly, too.===<br/>
My son enjoys Cut the Rope, Angry Birds (not the space version), and Where&#39;s My Water.  Angry Birds has been his favorite for a few years though.<br/>
<br/>
I ma hoping others will chime in with apps too, I am always on the look out for a fun new one.  We are going on vacation soon and I would like to have a bunch for the plane ride.  I have been playing the one Sandra suggested all night!! :)<br/>

&quot;Just one more,&quot; right?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Holly said she picked the iPad up the other night, to a game Marty had left opened, and played it a while.  For hours.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just discovered if you fall asleep in a plan while playing it, it&#39;s really easy to lose and need to start over.  Repeatedly.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m charging up my iPad in the Philadelphia airport with visions of the 15x15 San Francisco game dancing in my head.<br/>

I *may* have been up until 3 AM playing &quot;just one more&quot; hehe.  I actually<br/>
found that game online some time ago and used to play it a lot (it was<br/>
called something else though), but I lost the link to it so I was very<br/>
excited to see it when you posted!!  I already beat all the free ones, so<br/>
now it&#39;s time to move on to the paid ones.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1299193410">Hi there:When I saw the discussion of apps I thought I&#39;d share the ones<br/>
my kids enjoy. I&#39;ve never posted before so I hope it&#39;s okay to chime in.<br/>
They primarily use the kindle fires and from time to time an old Iphone<br/>
we no longer have activated as an Itouch. (Some games like Stick wars<br/>
and a few others are not available for the Fire yet).<br/>
Some of their favorite apps are:Plants vs Zombies (which I know was<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1441370417">I&#39;m so sorry this came through as a big mess. I had copied the names of many of the apps from our Amazon account and didn&#39;t realize they&#39;d come through as links and would reformat the way I had typed it up as a list. It&#39;s hard to read. I can repost a clearer list if there is an interest. <br/>
Again so sorry,<br/>

&gt; Hi there:When I saw the discussion of apps I thought I&#39;d share the ones<br/>
&gt; my kids enjoy. I&#39;ve never posted before so I hope it&#39;s okay to chime in.<br/>
&gt; They primarily use the kindle fires and from time to time an old Iphone<br/>
&gt; we no longer have activated as an Itouch. (Some games like Stick wars<br/>
&gt; and a few others are not available for the Fire yet).<br/>
&gt; Some of their favorite apps are:Plants vs Zombies (which I know was<br/>
&gt; mentioned but gosh we all love this one so much that we got it for the<br/>
&gt; Xbox 360 and DS as well). Zoo Story and Zoo Story 2Wolf Toss<br/>
