<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303009295">We just discovered these books last week, and they are so neat.  They <br/>
remind me of unschooling, and I wrote my own version.<br/>
<br/>
If you give a girl a computer<br/>
She&#39;ll want to watch a show<br/>
So, you&#39;ll find her a show about horses<br/>
When she sees the horses<br/>
She&#39;ll want to ride one<br/>
So, you&#39;ll find her a horse to ride<br/>
She&#39;ll like riding the horse so much<br/>
That she&#39;ll want to do it all the time<br/>
So, she&#39;ll go home and sit on the couch<br/>
And ride her horse<br/>
Then she&#39;ll need some reins<br/>
So, she&#39;ll find a cell phone charger<br/>
And she&#39;ll need a saddle<br/>
So, you&#39;ll give her a blanket<br/>
And she&#39;ll need a helmet<br/>
So, she&#39;ll find her hat<br/>
She&#39;ll have so much fun riding <br/>
that she&#39;ll want you to join her<br/>
So, you&#39;ll ride her horse too<br/>
And you&#39;ll both go to the barn with the horse<br/>
And the horse will be tired and hurt<br/>
So, she&#39;ll make the horse better<br/>
But she&#39;ll need some medicine for the horse<br/>
So, you&#39;ll get her a water bottle and bandages<br/>
And while she&#39;s fixing up her horse<br/>
She&#39;ll see her Go Fish Cards<br/>
And she&#39;ll ask you to play with her<br/>
So, you&#39;ll play Go Fish<br/>
And when she sees the fish<br/>
She&#39;ll want to count them<br/>
So, you&#39;ll count together<br/>
Counting will remind her of <br/>
Counting the horse&#39;s dressage steps on her horse show<br/>
And chances are, when she thinks about her horse show<br/>
She&#39;ll want to use the computer<br/>
<br/>
And if the part about her riding the horse (couch) doesn&#39;t make any <br/>
sense- there&#39;s a picture here <br/>
