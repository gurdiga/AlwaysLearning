<div id="ygrps-yiv-1753976722">Did anyone mention The King and I? The animated version of it was just on<br/>
Cartoon Netwrok the other day and my youngest son just LOVED it! :)<br/>
<br/>
I was one of the lucky ones who got to see Yule Brenner as the King Live at<br/>
the Pantages theater in Los Angeles before he passed away! It was awesome!<br/>
One of my favorite musicals!<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, and another musical I wasn&#39;t sure I saw listed....Starlight Express!<br/>
Another one of my other favorites! I have seen it 4 times now since 1990 and<br/>
my boys have now seen it twice! :)<br/>
<br/>
Just thought I would throw those in in case they were not mentioned! :)<br/>

OH!  I want to add that to my list.  Throw Cats out, and put The King and I.  <br/>
<br/>
I like the movie.   Yul Brynner waltzing barefooted. That&#39;s great.<br/>
