<div id="ygrps-yiv-845075413">My son learned the epistolary arts(you write and receive letters) through<br/>
playing Animal Crossing on his dsi. He is learning math(paying off  his<br/>
mortgage), interior design(you design your house), commerce(selling to Tom<br/>
Nook at Nookingtons), civil society(a mayor, a museum, a clothes shop, a<br/>
furniture shop, neighbours), gardening by planting flowers in his &quot;town&quot;(you<br/>
need to water them or they wilt), and hygiene (there is a hair salon).  Even<br/>
&quot;travel&quot; involves going out a gate, with a guard who you need to get<br/>
permission to open the  gate and checks your &quot;papers&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
At our house their are two copies, and my sil and niece have two, so we link<br/>
dsi&#39;s and learn about trade and geography.   (Each game has indigenous<br/>
fruit) and you cross pollinate.<br/>
<br/>
In addition my kids are map reading to travel about the town, and fishing.<br/>
My son has a fishing guide for fish native to our area, and the game has fed<br/>
another interest of his.<br/>

bit, which is sad because I love food and fibers.<br/>
<br/>
A couple food things I was thinking about..<br/>
Absorbancy - I like cotton napkins better than synthetic napkins.<br/>
farmer decisions - should I slaughter the sheep for food, or shear  <br/>
the sheep for wool.<br/>

A pretty table cloth makes dinner nicer. &lt;g&gt;   Pretty napkins on a table <br/>
make even salad and sandwiches seem elegant.   People have used muslin for <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-431206616">This conversation about fashion follows closely with some of the fun we have been having in our household. A few weeks ago, my 7 year old and I were at Wal-Mart and just looking around in the toy section. She wanted to get ideas for her birthday present list to send to relatives. She saw  the Project Runway Fashion Design set and then she saw a Harumika fashion set which comes with a dress form and different fabrics. No sewing required. We went home and looked it up on Amazon and found 100&#39;s of different fun things on this subject, just type in fashion under kids, so many different things!!!. There are over 12 different computer programs, 1000&#39;s of books...endless possibilities. So she got the basic Harumika set and her older sisters(who are in different areas of the country) sent her fabric swatches and some of their clothes which she cut up and has been playing with for hours and hours. She pulled out some of her Dover coloring books on Japan and started making kimono&#39;s. She has been looking at different era&#39;s, countries and talking abut the differences(like swimsuit styles) and how they have changed. I watch, listen, interact and help by being interested and finding other resources for her to look at. She may or may not continue to be interested, but she knows if she is interested in something, there are  vast amounts of resources out there to help her learn about it. I am a single unschooling mom of 6 kids (31-8) who is on the lower economic scale, and have several years of college without a degree and still learning everyday. I have been unschooling my children since the early 80&#39;s, when I met a couple with teenagers in bookstore in California and they told me about John Holt and I immediately bought his book. I have either ran my own business(es) or as I do now,work as a Nanny/household manager (for 4 teenage boys who go to public school). I discovered this list a few years ago and felt like I finally had peers who understood me! <br/>

<br/>
Women&#39;s studies - women&#39;s work through out history<br/>
Courtship rituals<br/>
Clothing as class marker and secret messages<br/>
Rise of trade unionism  - &quot;Norma Rae&quot; -- depictions in popular culture and <br/>
the media<br/>
Agriculture<br/>
Mining and metallurgy<br/>
Tanning and furs - the fur trade (eek)<br/>
You said commerce -- trade -- the Silk Road -- politics<br/>
Engineering and manufacturing<br/>
The history of New York city itself<br/>
Milinery<br/>
Whales and whaling<br/>
Feathers and birds - hunting<br/>
Ecology and endangered species - which leads to international politics too.<br/>
Dyes - chemistry of dyes, mordants.<br/>
Carpentry<br/>
Patent law<br/>
Weaving<br/>
The Bible<br/>
Storytelling and comics (Bayeux tapestry the first comic)<br/>
Fine art - paintings, style, movements, materials<br/>
Photography<br/>
Color theory, lighting<br/>
Gotta say it - Geometry<br/>
Contemporary independent crafts and the DIY craft movement<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Check out my next article in Natural Life magazine (May/June) called <br/>
&quot;Refashioning Part One&quot; in part about the used clothing industry. <br/>
&quot;Refashioning Part Two&quot; will follow about upcycling old clothes.<br/>
<br/>
There is a ton of stuff on tv right now - specials about manufacturing in <br/>
China, a series called &quot;Blood, Sweat and T-shirts&quot; about the rag trade. In <br/>
terms of workers&#39; rights the clothing industry in India today seems pretty <br/>
much where the clothing industry was in New York and the East Coast in the <br/>
1890&#39;s through pre WWII.<br/>
<br/>
A cool book, like &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot; for another era - Anne Scott <br/>
James, &quot;In the Mink&quot;. I hope to adapt it for the screen one day. So add <br/>
Publishing to the list.<br/>
<br/>
I am presently writing a novel and screenplay concurrently that is a <br/>
retelling of Sleeping Beauty in a sense from the point of view of the <br/>
spinning wheel. Eventually I hope that will be added to the pop culture <br/>
lexicon about textile arts in due course.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Deb, do you mean what people would wear for those things?  There are  <br/>
definitely some traditions involving attire for executions.    <br/>
Murderers should probably remember to wear rubber gloves.  But torture  <br/>
and suicide... but torture, in True Lies (and too often on Fox&#39;s  <br/>
24)...  usually just whatever the guy happened to be wearing.<br/>
<br/>
Ah... in Hamlet there&#39;s a description of fashion when Ophelia drowns.<br/>
<br/>
Oh.  Well maybe it&#39;s more floral design that garment:<br/>
<br/>
QUEEN GERTRUDE<br/>
There is a willow grows aslant a brook,<br/>
That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;<br/>
There with fantastic garlands did she come<br/>
Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples<br/>
That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,<br/>
But our cold maids do dead men&#39;s fingers call them:<br/>
There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds<br/>
Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;<br/>
When down her weedy trophies and herself<br/>
Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;<br/>
And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:<br/>
Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;<br/>
As one incapable of her own distress,<br/>
Or like a creature native and indued<br/>
Unto that element: but long it could not be<br/>
Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,<br/>
Pull&#39;d the poor wretch from her melodious lay<br/>
To muddy death.<br/>
<br/>
LAERTES<br/>
Alas, then, she is drown&#39;d?<br/>
<br/>
QUEEN GERTRUDE<br/>
Drown&#39;d, drown&#39;d.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-510674071">I asked my fashion guru here at our house, Chamille.<br/>
<br/>
She said, you learn a lot about people.  I&#39;m not sure how to put that in a nice one word explanation.  She was meaning that if you like a certain kind of fashion then you&#39;ll learn a lot about the kind of people that also like that kind of fashion and where they get their ideas and why they like it.<br/>
<br/>
She also said &quot;math&quot;, which surprised me.  She said that you learn about how to piece shapes together and count out stitches and turn 2-D things like fabric into 3-D things that fit onto people.<br/>
<br/>
She also said you learn about the tools and technical skills involved.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll come up with more...<br/>
<br/>
I know that Chamille has learned about  <br/>
costuming<br/>
shock value<br/>
store merchandising<br/>
fashion curve, or rise and fall of various fashions<br/>
vintage clothing<br/>
corsets and whale bones, which also falls under tools of the trade and history<br/>
shapes of people<br/>
repairing clothing<br/>
pattern making<br/>
color theory<br/>

<br/>
gender and colors...<br/>
<br/>
since in India the colors for genders are different than the US.  I used to work at a rec center that had a lot of Indian clients.  They did birthday parties there and the Indian moms preferred the Christmas wrapping papers with red and green and gold to standard b-day wrapping paper with pink or blue and cupcakes or something.<br/>

<br/>
Ninja clothing was VERY important to Chamille in her search of fashion wonders!<br/>
<br/>
She learned ninjitsu because they wore black, she wanted nothing to do with any of those martial arts that wore white.<br/>

Schools intend to predict the narrow learning paths. That is what curriculum<br/>

Knowing about textiles and knowing about ropes is interesting too<br/>
<br/>
ropes and sails used to be made from hemp<br/>
that ties into history and politics and cotton plantations and sailing and availability of resources, and commerce<br/>

***do you mean what people would wear for those things?***<br/>

I was thinking of blindfolds, gags, ropes, hoods, pillows.&lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
Until recently Montana used hanging as the method of execution in death penalty cases.  I think Washington still uses hanging. <br/>
<br/>
I was also thinking of corpse disposal  (wrapped in a sheet, rolled up in a carpet, stuffed in a duffle bag, sent down a laundry chute, etc) <br/>
<br/>
Dressing for the occasion is very interesting, too.    We should add funeral customs and attire.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81954445">My 6 year old daughter and I have been having fun with this recently too. She was doing a sticker book on clothing through the ages, which brought up conversations around<br/>
- culture of different countries<br/>
- clothing for different purposes (eg going to the opera vs daytime)<br/>
- clothing for different status (queen vs lady in waiting)<br/>
- different roles - eg what is a lady in waiting<br/>
- clothing for different climates<br/>
- history/evolution (from a very logical question given the layout of the book - &#39;did we use to be chinese?&#39;)<br/>
- ethics and changes in attitudes over time (eg wearing fur, rising hems)<br/>
and then moved into listening to 50&#39;s music & watching/doing some rock&#39;n&#39;roll & swing dancing<br/>
<br/>
Tess has also been designing clothes using a paper based design set (Klutz paper fashions) and we got the Harumika mannequin set yesterday, which she played with for about 10 hours solid and then got up today and did some more. We have also recently bought some fabric & a pattern and will be making her a dress together. Not quite sure how to categorise what she&#39;s learning from these activities, beyond the obvious things of design, colour and so on, but there&#39;s definitely a whole lot more going on, things like coming up with designs & concepts in her head before she does the physical design, plus scale & shape. <br/>
