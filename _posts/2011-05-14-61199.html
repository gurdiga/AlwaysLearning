<div id="ygrps-yiv-721110237">I am looking for ideas for video/computer games for my four and a half year old son. He has played Lego Harry Potter and Lego Star Wars pretty much to completion. My husband plays World of Warcraft which our son is super interested in, so I was thinking that maybe there is something out there with the same sort of epic feel but requires less reading and keyboard usage.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-692125281">Toontown is less reading heavy, I don&#39;t know about keyboard use though. If he <br/>
likes the Lego series, there&#39;s Lego Batman and Lego Indiana Jones and newly <br/>
released Lego Pirates of the Caribbean. Simon used to sit on my lap and work <br/>
through games like Heroes of Might and Magic. I&#39;d read the text and he&#39;d control <br/>
the players. And Linnaea was playing World of Warcraft when she was 5 or maybe <br/>
4. She liked me to play her character and get lots of money so that she could go <br/>
buy pets. She had a stream of cats behind  her and Jill Parmer helped me to get <br/>
her a gopher once back when we had a U.S. account. The game, for her, was <br/>
nothing like the game for me. But she had fun. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-801690433">Adventure Quest is a single player RPG, somewhat similar to WoW.  Most of<br/>
the reading can be skipped (that&#39;s how my son played it when he was<br/>
younger).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-10155693">My 4.5 yr old is currently LOVING the Little Big Planet games.  His older brother (6) likes playing through levels, but Z particularly loves playing with the level-creation part of the game.  He builds amazing structures, makes sackbots with crazy costumes, plays with gravity and lighting and music, and it&#39;s super amazing fun.  Highly recommend.<br/>
<br/>
Other games he likes are<br/>
- Lego Batman<br/>
- Lego Clone Wars<br/>
- Lego Indiana Jones<br/>
- Castle Crashers<br/>
- Kirby&#39;s Epic Yarn (wii)<br/>
<br/>
On the computer he gravitates to:<br/>
- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.poissonrouge.com/">http://www.poissonrouge.com/</a><br/>
- <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://boowakwala.uptoten.com/">http://boowakwala.uptoten.com/</a><br/>

- and sites associated with tv shows he likes<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm, rereading your request and thinking about computer games that would be more epic. I wonder if your son would like:<br/>
- Lego Universe<br/>
- Robloxx<br/>
- Kung Fu Panda World<br/>
- Club Penguin<br/>
- Poptropica<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1064720007">My son will be five in September. He loves the Lego games. He recently got a newer Star Wars game (Clone Wars) and he&#39;s very excited about the new Pirates of the Caribbean. We also have Harry Potter and Batman.<br/>
<br/>
One other game my kids enjoy is Worms. DH originally played the DOS version in the mid-90s, LOL. We have a much newer version on the iPod and the XBox. It&#39;s a turn-based game where you try to blow up your opponent&#39;s worms. There&#39;s a fair amount of strategy involved.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1694896558">Thanks so much for the great suggestions. He chose to bring home Lego Batman<br/>
from the game store this weekend and has been pretty immersed in that for a<br/>
few days. He and my husband set up a character for him on World of Warcraft<br/>
and he has been exploring that a bit also. Little Big Planet looks<br/>
absolutely amazing! I wish that we had a PS3 or that it was made for the<br/>
xbox or ds.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again!<br/>
