<div id="ygrps-yiv-2070035903">I just wanted to apologize for the flaming comment and let you know why I <br/>
said it.  I am fairly new to unschooling, I have homeschooled for 4 years and <br/>
this is our first year of moving towards unschooling.  Over the summer, I joined <br/>
several unschooling boards to find out more about unschooling, and was <br/>
absolutely blown away by the amount of flaming that went on.  There were several new <br/>
people on the boards, and it seemed that if they questioned an approach or <br/>
asked a question as to why people approached things the way they did, they got <br/>
flamed to the point their questions never got answered and they ended up having <br/>
to leave the group.  A TV discussion on one of the boards really got out of <br/>
hand, so that is why I was afraid to ask.  Another woman had asked the <br/>
pornography question, and she got harassed terribly without ever getting her question <br/>
answered, and I have been curious ever since.  So anyway, that is where I was <br/>
coming from, and I am really glad to have found a board that I don&#39;t have to <br/>
lurk on and be afraid to ask questions about this new adventure for our family.  <br/>
Thanks!  Susan</div>

<br/>
She was harassed in what way?   I&#39;m really curious about why people wouldn&#39;t <br/>
even want the question asked, since we&#39;re dealing with real kids in the real <br/>
world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-199888282">I have left other unschooling lists because of the flaming as well.  I <br/>
remember a while back I mentioned on one list that my son was taking <br/>
Suzuki Piano.  I was ripped apart for having him take a class that was <br/>
so structured and reward-based.  I should not, they told me, be sending <br/>
him to classes but just letting him experience life as it came and learn <br/>
from that.  Now we do not school at home at all, but my boys do take <br/>
some classes outside the home, and they love them.  We did move on from <br/>
Suzuki Piano, but only because my son began to tire of playing his <br/>
twinkles every single day when he had learned them well.  He now takes a <br/>
more whole-child keyboarding class, and enjoys it thoroughly.  I would <br/>
hate to think that the definition of unschooling is so rigid that I am <br/>
not welcome on an unschoolers list if I let my boys take karate, art <br/>
classes, join scouts, etc.  After all, there are skills in the world <br/>
that I do not possess, and if we have found someone who does and is <br/>
willing to pass them (for pay or not) to my boys, I really don&#39;t think <br/>
that is wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
I second the idea that it is refreshing to find a list that seems open <br/>
to different ideas and allows people to express them.<br/>
