<div id="ygrps-yiv-1566128168">When Eve first received Candyland as a gift she was 4 yo. We opened it and began to play and she asked why we had to go to the color we picked? (she did not like taking turns and the time it took). I then explained the point of the game, to get to the Candy Castle. She took her gingerbread boy and slammed him on the castle and said&quot;There! Now I&#39;m on the Castle!&quot; <br/>
Then she matched all of the character cards with hthe characters and sorted all of the color cards into separate piles. Which I am sure taught her way more than the game would have!<br/>
