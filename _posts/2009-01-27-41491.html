<div id="ygrps-yiv-357859754">Hello!!!  My name is Jennifer.  I have a wonderful husband, Sean and <br/>
three handsome and extremely fun boys, Cody (18), Mikey (9) & Scotty <br/>
(7).  We live in San Bernardino County in Southern California.  We <br/>
live in the snowy part with all the squirrels and coyotes and <br/>
friendly mountain neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
We have been teaching our kids at home for 5 years for some, 9 or 7 <br/>
for others.  My oldest, Cody, went to private school, then public <br/>
school, then we pulled him out and taught through a charter school <br/>
when he was in 8th grade.  My other two did charter for a while too.  <br/>
Kind of hated it.  So, then we went all crazy.... and then we are now <br/>
our own private school.  Cody really wanted to play sports, so we <br/>
enrolled him in a private school that has a homeschool division that <br/>
we can teach anyway or whatever we want to.  That works.  He loves <br/>
football, baseball and is having fun playing soccer.  He will <br/>
officially graduate in June, however, he could now, he just wants to <br/>
delay higher education until he&#39;s done being a kid.  He&#39;ll start <br/>
college in fall of this year.  Still trying to decide what he wants <br/>
to be.<br/>
<br/>
Mikey & Scotty are &quot;unschooled&quot;.  We tried doing the text/workbooks, <br/>
but that just did not work for us.  How boring.  They really didn&#39;t <br/>
care at all about sentance structure as much as they did about <br/>
building hotwheel tracks and lego structures.  So, we decided to <br/>
play, watch tv, play video games, go to the park, have sleep overs in <br/>
our tent on the deck, go to Dad&#39;s work and use his date stamper a <br/>
billion times, etc.<br/>
<br/>
I am learning to enjoy unschooling, but still am a little fearful <br/>
that my little kids will never learn to write properly or read a <br/>
chapter book all on their own.  I&#39;m hoping to learn from you all here <br/>
how to relax and let them learn on their own.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for listing!!!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My oldest daughter, Chamille 14, doesn&#39;t write very well, if by that,<br/>
you mean handwriting skills.  Her writing skills, as in communication<br/>
through text, is very good.  She types very well, faster than me and she<br/>
spells things correctly and uses punctuation correctly.  I didn&#39;t teach<br/>
her those things, she learned them through reading things she was<br/>
interested in like websites and games.<br/>
<br/>
Chapter books are ok, if you really like reading.  Reading serves a<br/>
function other than reading for the sake of reading and it might help to<br/>
see that.  There are many adults who never read chapter books, but read<br/>
online, or magazines, or job applications, or any of the other numerous<br/>
applications of reading.<br/>
<br/>
One thing that really helped our family, was to get books on cd and tape<br/>
from the library, and listen to stories.  Hearing stories and ideas, and<br/>
written word, went a long way!  Book for book, Chamille had acquired<br/>
more than most of her schooled peers, without ever opening one and<br/>
reading it herself.  So, by the time she was 11/12 and figuring out how<br/>
to read, she had a lot of understanding of written language that helped<br/>
her figure it out in a book form.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, we had a neighbor kid over and Margaux, my 7 yr old, and her<br/>
were trying to figure out something to do.  Margaux said, &quot;hey, we could<br/>
read some Nancy Drew books!&quot;.  Her friend said &quot;eeeww, I&#39;m not reading,<br/>
I&#39;m not at school!&quot;.   So, Margaux doesn&#39;t know how to read fluently<br/>
yet, and loves the idea of it and would do it for fun and play, and her<br/>
friend, who does know how to read, won&#39;t because she finds it to be a<br/>
chore, homework, something unpleasant that is done to her in school.<br/>
<br/>
So, what is the point of reading?  Is it to be able to read chapter<br/>
books one day?  Or are there other better reasons to read?<br/>
<br/>
The best reason to do ANYthing, is simply because you want to and have a<br/>
reason to do so!</div>

<br/>
And as to the term &quot;chapter books&quot;:  as far as I know it has to do  <br/>
with elementary school book reports, and I think it&#39;s not a great term  <br/>
for unschooling purposes.  If anyone knows a different origin for it,  <br/>
I&#39;d be interested!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-773461742">My husband started to come home from work and flip on the tv and eat <br/>
his dinner (he gets home after we have already eaten most days).  The <br/>
kids would sit with him on the couch and all stare like droens at the <br/>
television.  It bothered me as I knew the kids missed him and he missed <br/>
them during the day and they both had a lot they could share with each <br/>
other.  However, I  also see the need that my husband needs to relax <br/>
and unwind after a long day at the office.  So...  I started to put <br/>
interesting toys out on the coffee table about the time my husband <br/>
would come home from work.  Bionicles, legos, hot wheels, cool books <br/>
with vivid pictures.  The kids would be all into their play and my <br/>
husband would not want to turn the tv on and distract them.  He got to <br/>
eat, in relative peace, and watch the kids play.  Then, 10 times out of <br/>
10, when he was finished with his dinner, he would get into playing <br/>
with them.<br/>
<br/>
I also (gently) addressed the topic of how he was acting like his <br/>
father did to him.  If he wanted that relationship, he was headed in <br/>
the right direction.  If not, there is plenty of reason to make that <br/>
change now.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-250391979">Thank you Jenny C. & Sandra!!  I appreciate your feedback.<br/>
<br/>
My thought in having the kids read is many fold (and all are just my <br/>
dumb excuses).<br/>
<br/>
Part is that my husband, oldest son and I all have such a passion for <br/>
reading that we hope the two littles do too.  I know, we all have <br/>
different likes and dislikes, I just truly hope that they love it <br/>
like <br/>
we do.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing is that I feel a lot of pressure from family who don&#39;t <br/>
understand homeschooling, let alone UNschooling.  If they could see <br/>
my <br/>
children excelling at something &quot;schoolish&quot; I might relax more.  <br/>
Again, <br/>
I see my own excuses here.<br/>
<br/>
Those are just some of my paranoid reasons for them to read early.  <br/>
My <br/>
oldest son had the base of elementary school and the desire to <br/>
continue <br/>
on studing American & European classics.  As well as a strong base <br/>
in &quot;school&quot; math, which he also continued and is learning calculus, <br/>
because he wants to.<br/>
<br/>
My little ones have only had unschooling and no base in a <br/>
public/private school, so I guess that is where my fear comes in.  <br/>
They <br/>
are not doing the things that my oldest did at his age.  I see them <br/>
learing to read their video games, as we don&#39;t want to sit there with <br/>
them the entire time to read through every scene.  So, I guess they <br/>
will learn and are learning at their own pace.  I just have to learn <br/>
to <br/>
trust them and continue providing opportunities for them to read.</div>

<br/>
Part of providing opportunities to read is to read for children much of the<br/>
time that they want us to (whether we always want to or not).  That takes<br/>
the pressure off children to feel responsible for reading and lets them<br/>
relax around the printed word while others are reading and they are watching<br/>
and listening as others read.  Eventually they&#39;ll be reading with you,<br/>
silently and then maybe even aloud at some point.  Karl has begun to read<br/>
aloud to me a word here and there, but I&#39;m doing the bulk of reading,<br/>
whether that&#39;s onscreen, on the page, from signage everywhere we go.....<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; They are not doing the things that my oldest did at his age. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And since your younger children are unschooling, that&#39;s true.  Your oldest<br/>
went to private school.  What your youngers are doing is not going to look<br/>
like schooling because they&#39;re UNschooling.<br/>

very different from me has expanded my world just that much more!  Think<br/>
back to when you were first dating your husband, and he brought new and<br/>
intersting things to your life, just like you did for him and how cool<br/>
it was to explore those things because you loved the person.  That&#39;s<br/>
kind of what it&#39;s like to have kids who like very different things from<br/>
you!<br/>

in elementary school sounds very hindering to natural curiosity.  A<br/>
strong base in school math, sounds like something that someone would<br/>

stupid or wrong or bad for liking what they like and knowing what they<br/>

misconception created by curriculum makers and school systems that build<br/>
on linear passing of tests to the next level.<br/>

Even if your younger kids were going to school, they could be doing<br/>
things very differently than your older child did.  My oldest daughter<br/>
was experiencing a brand new baby at the age of 7.  My now 7 yr old<br/>
daughter wishes she was experiencing a brand new baby, but is doing<br/>
other things.  They are completely and totally different people, with<br/>
completely different personalities and likes and dislikes and it&#39;s been<br/>
that way since each of them were born!<br/>
<br/>
One thing that may help you see the learning in the video games, is to<br/>
get down there with them and play them too, or sit and read and watch<br/>
and talk or look up walk throughs.  You may find how incrediblely<br/>
difficult those games are that they are playing.  You may even find that<br/>
they are better at it than you!  I love it when that happens!</div>

yes! please do .. I don&#39;t play the games with dd because she is far better than me and i often get really frustrated instead of enjoying but it can be so much fun to watch and let her show me whats going on. <br/>
Recently dh went through a little period where he got worried ... they aren&#39;t learning , they are going to get behind , they must start doing a curriculum. It happens. I still have moments when I freak thinking ... I only have one chance..am I ruining their lives?!<br/>
<br/>
Just yesterday dh and I watched Courtney playing one of her Wow characters. We also watched her write several sentences to a friend, learn a new word, do several different types of math calculations, and organize a group of people together to acomplish a goal. <br/>
That would have been plenty but it dosent stop there. This led to planning on buying more beading stuff, her desire to try to start a business, advertising, pricing so she will make a profit , wether to include postage in the price , and on and on. <br/>

Reading is reading. There are times when my dh and I would rather buy  <br/>
books than anything else because we love to read ourselves. We started  <br/>
reading to dd when she was a baby because we wanted to be together, to  <br/>
tell stories, to share something, to &quot;bathe her in words&quot;. It was fun.  <br/>
We read some very cool books together.<br/>
<br/>
But she didn&#39;t pick them up to read herself. Not at 7, not at 8, not  <br/>
at 9, 10 or even 11. But, she began to play Zoo Tycoon, Impossible  <br/>
Creatures and horse riding games on the computer. She wanted to learn  <br/>
to read the words in the games herself, but when she needed us to read  <br/>
something, we sat with her and did it. Soon she didn&#39;t need to ask.  <br/>
She had her own reasons to learn to read - to get to the next level or  <br/>
create a new exhibit. By 12, she was reading and playing World of  <br/>
Warcraft (some pretty sophisticated language) *and* was re-reading her  <br/>
favorite book series and asking for more.<br/>
<br/>
Your kids don&#39;t need to read early. They&#39;ll read when they are ready.  <br/>
There&#39;s so much learning your boys can do without reading. Let them.<br/>
<br/>
Try not to compare unschooling to schooling. And don&#39;t believe that  <br/>
everything your eldest excels at is because of school &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

********<br/>
I&#39;ve read this on several websites and I have to say that no, I would not feel the same.  When I read to my children (they&#39;re 15 and 11), I am on the sofa, we&#39;re snuggled up under a blanket or we&#39;re all lying on the sofa, we&#39;re interacting about the book, using our imagination, we may have some classical music in the background etc.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but when the video games are on, the kids are not paying attention to me.  (My children have been reading for a long time, way before we got video games so this is not an issue for us.)  They are into the game, and if I were to read the story to them it would be just so that they could get to the next screen.  Then there&#39;s the beeps and boops, the noises, the distractions of the on-screen goings-on and such.  I just can not see how this is in any way like reading a book to my child, I really can&#39;t.  I am not trying to start anything, but I&#39;ve only been unschooling for a short time and I logged onto several of these lists and I&#39;ve read this at least a dozen times in the last few weeks.  It, imho, is just not the same.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1480592905">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;The kids would sit with him on the couch and all stare like droens at <br/>
the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; television.  It bothered me as I knew the kids missed him and he missed<br/>
&gt; them during the day and they both had a lot they could share with each<br/>
&gt; other. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m glad that this is working for you, but my first thought was to wonder <br/>
whether your husband and kids missed that tv watching togetherness. Watching <br/>
programs they both enjoy has been a very important way for Jayn and my dh to <br/>
connect with each other, after work and at other times.  It seems like <br/>
saying &quot;stare like drones&quot; (as I assume you meant) shows a pretty negative <br/>
judgment about tv watching and an assumption that it precludes connecting. <br/>
That has not been my observation.<br/>
<br/>
Also at our house having toys and games out certainly does not preclude <br/>
watching tv. Jayn has been multitasking in front of the tv her whole life. <br/>
If kids are distracted from interesting play by the tv, that sounds to me <br/>
like maybe they don&#39;t get enough tv.<br/>
<br/>
For me having the tv on quietly in the background while she and I play, draw <br/>
or craft, has sometimes been a lifesafer in allowing me to keep my energy up <br/>
enough to continue playing with her, especially if I am tired. We have lots <br/>
of shows we love and quote back and forth to each other.<br/>
<br/>
Jayn also needs and demands her father&#39;s attention when he gets home from <br/>
work. He needs a few minutes to transition and decompress, and is often <br/>
physically exhausted. My part in helping Jayn get her need met from her <br/>
father pleasantly instead of being angry and aggressive was not to try to <br/>
manipulate them both into some activity that I approved of, but to be really <br/>
straightforward and tell dh my observation of Jayn&#39;s behavior and what I <br/>
thought she was telling him. He then talked to Jayn and together they came <br/>
up with the daily routine that they now follow more or less.<br/>
<br/>
He always speaks to her when he first comes in and asks for time to get <br/>
settled, then he calls her in and they wrestle and/or watch tv and/or look <br/>
on the computer. They have games that are totally separate and different <br/>
from the games and interests that she and I share.<br/>
<br/>
Recently they have started what I can only describe as a research project <br/>
together. They go out on the weekends together and have been observing and <br/>
photographing the progress of a major dredging project on the beach near us. <br/>
Last weekend they even spoke to the engineer or foreman in charge about what <br/>
the sand was and other questions. They bought little notebooks to dedicate <br/>
to the thing. It is very fun for them, and it was an idea that they <br/>
generated together from just being out driving and doing errands one <br/>
Saturday a few weeks ago, when they noticed the work beginning. But I have <br/>
no doubt that part of the plan to follow the work was inspired by a shared <br/>
enjoyment of a bunch of shows about amazing engineering that they have <br/>
watched together at different times.<br/>

<br/>
-=-They are into the game, and if I were to read the story to them it  <br/>

<br/>
Exactly.  A mom who reads to a non-reading child is helping him get to  <br/>
a place he couldn&#39;t have gotten on his own, whether it&#39;s to picture a  <br/>
battle in a Redwall book or to find out there are things on the menu  <br/>
beyond grilled cheese or a hot dog.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Start something.  Start looking about learning  happening in the child  <br/>
instead of at the comfort of the mother.<br/>
<br/>
I think you&#39;ve missed the point on the parallel between a child  <br/>
playing a game and a child reading a book.  It&#39;s not about the  <br/>
parent.  A child being engrossed in a game is like a child engrossed  <br/>
in a book (or movie, or music, or Lego project or learning a  <br/>
skateboard trick).   If some reading is required, the parent should  <br/>
help.  If the parent would be willing to be near enough to help with  <br/>
words a child didn&#39;t know in a book, but not to help with words a  <br/>
child didn&#39;t know in a video game, that shows a prejudice on the part  <br/>
of the parents.<br/>
<br/>

If you look around there it might help it make sense.   If it doesn&#39;t,  <br/>
please feel free to keep asking.  This list is perfect for sorting  <br/>
through and analyzing confusions such as that one!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1417414158">It&#39;s not the act of reading (or a comparison between reading a book  <br/>
and a screen) I was referring to. It&#39;s the connection and intent.<br/>
<br/>
To read what&#39;s on the screen because a kid asks you to help is making  <br/>
a connection. To be nearby, as Sandra mentioned, is to have the intent  <br/>
to be helpful and involved.<br/>
<br/>
Parents can learn more about what their children like by being  <br/>
interested themselves. And by the time children are reading on their  <br/>
own, we can connect with them by playing the games ourselves, buying  <br/>
strategy guides, looking for cool clothing, going to conventions, and  <br/>
especially listening and learning from the stories our kids tell us.<br/>
<br/>
Parents new to unschooling can tend to dismiss video/computer games as  <br/>
a waste of time that could be better spent reading under a blanket.  <br/>
Adults will tend to put &quot;reading a book together&quot; in a different  <br/>
category than &quot;a kid enjoying video games.&quot; But, they are both  <br/>
opportunities to get to know a child, to be connected, and supportive.<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think parents should be sitting next to their kids for every  <br/>
moment as interpreters. It helps to be willingly available as much as  <br/>
you sincerely can, though. If that&#39;s hard for a parent to do with  <br/>
video games it&#39;s worth examining the attitude. If a child is going  <br/>
through a National Geographic magazine and struggles with the  <br/>
captions occasionally and asks them to be read, it will help  <br/>
unschooling if the parent&#39;s attitude is the same with the magazine as  <br/>
it is for the video game. Asking for help shouldn&#39;t come with parent  <br/>
baggage about what kids want help with.<br/>

reading -- or anything -- up in a goal that may be more important to  <br/>

<br/>
The kids may certainly enjoy it, but it may not be as important to  <br/>
them. They may decide they want to draw or bake cookies or build  <br/>
something while you read to them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard of plenty of kids who needed to be up and about, playing  <br/>
or jumping or doing things that look like they aren&#39;t paying  <br/>
attention to the book. Kat used to do that occasionally. It&#39;s what  <br/>
she needed to do to pay attention.<br/>

It surprised me.  I LOVED the escape that books provided.  What my  <br/>
kids use for that purpose is movies and video games.  Movies don&#39;t  <br/>
last as long, but they can be much better than books sometimes.  And  <br/>
video games....  It&#39;s pretty interesting that some of the same kinds  <br/>
of arguments against books, that they&#39;re passive and don&#39;t require or  <br/>
allow the reader to react or change the story, are all answered by  <br/>
video games like Fallout 3, yet the same sorts of people came up with  <br/>
new arguments.<br/>
<br/>
I think there is something in many older people that causes them to  <br/>
put down kids in a kneejerk way. What kids like is stupid.  First they  <br/>
make the judgment and then they look for the justifications.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060201517">You can&#39;t. But you can make it easier for him to want to join in and play. David will often have a list of jobs that he has to get done floating about in his brain. I can help him to feel free enough to be able to move from that list to hanging out Simon and Linnaea by making sure that I take care of a lot of the household chores that get him buzzing about in a minor frenzy. Keeping the house cleaner, taking care of some of the yardwork, making sure the little things that matter to him are done help him to feel less stressed, less torn between duties he feels must be done and the more enjoyable aspects of life that he sees as leisure time activities, like playing on the Xbox with the kids. Over time he has relaxed his needs for tidiness a lot and changed his perspective on what is leisure and what is important. <br/>
<br/>
The more David feels relaxed and happy and like all that needs doing is done, the more time and attention he feels he has to give to Simon and Linnaea and me. The more he sees me and the kids having a good time together the more he wants to join in. Sometimes it helps to change the scenery, to go to the beach or to go skating or to go to the zoo or a museum or out for lunch or dinner. <br/>

to when he was ... well, since he was able to sit up on my  lap. We&#39;d read <br/>
book after book after book. When he got proficient at reading  himself, he went <br/>
through a couple books on his own, then we meandered through a  couple more <br/>
books with me reading to him and since then, he hasn&#39;t been  interested much in <br/>
reading *books*. Magazines, video games, video game hints on  t.v., parts of <br/>
books (mostly instructional, or non-fiction), comics, yes. Books,  not right <br/>
now. Storm putters around with it occasionally, wanting me to read to  him, <br/>
wanting to thumb through a book, then he&#39;s done for a while. We have loads  and <br/>
loads of books of all sorts and age ranges all about the house-in every  room, <br/>
in fact-even in the hallways! The books are definitely there if they want  to <br/>
take them up again. We live a 10 minute walk from the library. Books are easy  <br/>
access-just no interest.<br/>
 <br/>
Video games, on the other hand, are huge. And such a different  experience <br/>
with us (and friends) than books! Books are quiet, one person reading  alone, <br/>
one person reading to others, not much discussion. Not while  reading-afterward, <br/>
some discussion, but not *during*. Video games, though, are a  huge social <br/>
experience!! Everyone is talking, sharing, watching, laughing,  offering <br/>
suggestions-even if only one person is playing! But we have multiplayer  games and <br/>
multiple player interactive games for our handhelds and that is even  *more* <br/>
fun! Tips to share, new critters, new levels, new items to buy, an  awesome <br/>
replay-all things to share with those nearby. I couldn&#39;t even begin to  recall how <br/>
many times a day one of my guys says, &quot;Hey, Mama, look at THIS!&quot;, and  I&#39;m <br/>
always happy to see what neat thing they have to show me-which often turns  into <br/>
a good 10-20 minute dialogue afterward about how that particular thing was  <br/>
accessed or came about. It often also has it&#39;s own connections to other  <br/>
discussions, more opportunities to learn stuff, look stuff up, move on to  another <br/>
tid bit.<br/>
 <br/>
People talk about how &quot;isolating&quot; video games are and that  just puzzles me. <br/>
It is *so* not isolating in any way at our house! We have  systems that are <br/>
semi-portable, handheld games for every member of the house,  separate rooms we <br/>
could be in-yet, everyone likes to play together or at least  *be* together <br/>
while some play. The only time they really played separately is  when we <br/>
discovered the remote play possibilities on our DS handhelds and then  they liked to <br/>
have one upstairs while the other was downstairs for a few games,  then they&#39;d <br/>
switch places. That fascination was over in one day, because, of  course, <br/>
they couldn&#39;t dialogue over the game! :~)<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think my kids are unique in the way they play video  games, <br/>
especially since we have friends that are the same way. It *could* be  different types <br/>
of personality, but maybe it is perception. I find the more  immersed I get in <br/>
unschooling, the more whatever perceived conflict I have is  about my <br/>
perception of it. Or pre-conceived ideas. If I can stop myself and take  a fresh <br/>
viewpoint, as if I&#39;ve never heard of or experienced said thing that&#39;s in  <br/>
conflict, and really see it through &quot;new eyes&quot;, I have a much better chance of  <br/>
removing the source of conflict and discomfort from my life.  <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Our either!!  Video games are incredibly social around here.  If they aren&#39;t getting played <br/>
together, then the kids are playing with others, like on WoW.  When they get together with <br/>
friends, there is always a flurry of activity to see who is at what level on what game and if <br/>
anyone needs help getting past a level, etc.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I&#39;ve been thoroughly tickled lately to watch my daughter type.  In isolation <br/>
(except with all of her WoW contacts) she went from VERY slow hunt, search then peck typing <br/>
to typing in little flurries.  She looks just like a ticket agent at the airport--type-type-type <br/>
enter pause...then type-type-type enter pause....  She&#39;s probably up to 40-50 wpm when <br/>
typing words she knows.  It all happened in a short couple of weeks!<br/>
