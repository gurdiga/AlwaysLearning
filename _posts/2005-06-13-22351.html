<div id="ygrps-yiv-900650797">&lt;&lt; I agree  with your sentiment but &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was out watering the yard when I realized my knowledge and experience had <br/>
been characterized as my &quot;sentiment.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I say a child can learn to read and can ONLY learn to read when she&#39;s <br/>
ready, herself, to read, that is not a sentiment.  Maybe the word is used <br/>
differently in the U.K. than here, but if the intent was to belittle my input as <br/>
just a feel-good, temporary  combination of words all made of hopeful emotion and <br/>
no real-world knowledge, then it was an insult (and probably not intended to <br/>
have been).  <br/>

I didn&#39;t mean &#39;sentiment&#39; to be in any way detrimental, just to say that at<br/>
an<br/>
emotional level I have sympathy with that point of view.<br/>
