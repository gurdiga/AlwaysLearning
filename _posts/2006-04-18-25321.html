<div id="ygrps-yiv-1637728562">Hello all.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve recently joined your group and wanted to write a short introduction.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Jenniffer, wife to Dan, mom to Jonathan Peter (8), Benjamen David (soon<br/>
to be 6) and Nicholas Jacob (soon to be 4).  We live in a very rural area of<br/>
Harpers Ferry, in a cabin midway down a mountain that has the Shenandoah<br/>
snaking around its base.  We have one human neighbor on our gravel road and<br/>
more animal neighbors than we can count.  They help themselves to our garden<br/>
and provide the boys with hours of entertainment daily.<br/>
<br/>
My husband works in NOVA, about a 1-1.5 hours away and I stay home with the<br/>
boys.  We&#39;re a single car family, so we&#39;re a bit isolated, and not hurting<br/>
for it, I think.  We&#39;re never wanting for things to do.<br/>
<br/>
We went from unschooling to relaxed homeschooling (wherein I convinced<br/>
myself that I was following their lead, but really, I was influencing their<br/>
decisions in subtle and not-so-subtle ways) and I would like to get back to<br/>
unschooling.  I see tension creeping into our days and I see myself getting<br/>
in the way of the boys&#39; natural love of learning, which is something I never<br/>
want to happen.  All of the boys taught themselves to nurse, to crawl, to<br/>
walk, to talk, to sleep through the night, to use the potty, and more than I<br/>
can list, all when they were ready.  Jonathan Peter taught himself to read<br/>
before his third birthday, Benjamen David was climbing impossible structures<br/>
when he was a toddler, and Nicholas Jacob was walking at 7 months old.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know why I thought I could improve on that, but I know my own<br/>
insecurities and fears were motivating me.<br/>
<br/>
Today we&#39;re deschooling, raking leaves outside, playing in the yard, having<br/>
a picnic lunch, blowing bubbles, and taking a walk later on to see what&#39;s<br/>
blooming on the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to getting to know you all and I&#39;ve already been inspired and<br/>
rejuvenated by your posts.<br/>
<br/>

learning, or just knowing how. They knew how to nurse.  They learned  <br/>
to walk and to talk.  They didn&#39;t teach themselves.  No one taught  <br/>
them.  They just figured it out.<br/>
<br/>
It might not seem like it would make any difference, but I&#39;m sure it  <br/>
will.<br/>

seeming remarkable in that way was carrying weight in terms of, &quot;They  <br/>
must be OK because they did this so early,&quot; versus, say, &quot;He taught  <br/>
himself to read at the age of 7&quot; (which would, I realize, be you  <br/>
predicting the future &lt;g&gt;). Like, would unschooling seem as OK to you  <br/>
if the kids were on a more typical, or even late, time table? Would  <br/>
their accomplishments and learning be as visible if they weren&#39;t  <br/>
remarkable for their ages?<br/>
<br/>
Or perhaps I&#39;m projecting my own issues with &quot;precociousness.&quot; I have  <br/>
an acquaintance who, for a good 18 months, worked into every  <br/>
conversation that her daughter was a self-taught early reader. As her  <br/>
daughter got older, and it became less remarkable that she knew how  <br/>
to read, my acquaintance would work in the time line. Sort of like this:<br/>
<br/>
Me: Would you and the kids like to come to the zoo with us on Friday?<br/>
<br/>
Her: We&#39;d love to, if I can get Brianna&#39;s nose out of a book! Ever  <br/>
since she taught herself to read six months ago, all she wants to do  <br/>
is read, read, read, one chapter book after another.<br/>
<br/>
It got more and more obnoxious as the months passed &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
I think, too, I was wondering about mentioning the early ages because  <br/>
this is an issue I see myself needing to be mindful of. My oldest is  <br/>
not quite five, and I think it will be hard for me if he&#39;s one of  <br/>
those kids who doesn&#39;t read fluently until he&#39;s 8, 9, 10.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I got a lot of attention as a kid for being precocious, and  <br/>
that kind of attention can be damaging. It was for me. I&#39;m working  <br/>
really hard not to get invested in my kids being &quot;advanced.&quot; Or,  <br/>
alternately, not to think they&#39;re behind when they&#39;re actually  <br/>
developmentally typical (my oldest was almost 2 before I found out  <br/>
that most kids don&#39;t read at 3 or 4--in retrospect, it should have  <br/>
been obvious to me that most kids don&#39;t start kindergarten reading  <br/>
fluently, but I did and somehow I thought that was just the norm).<br/>
<br/>
Possibly not your issue at all, but something I picked up on because  <br/>
I have to be attentive to my own history and assumptions about  <br/>
developmental time tables in order to avoid passing crap on to my kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1573913934">No, I think you&#39;re right;  that&#39;s something that I definitely need to be<br/>
mindful of, as well.  Suspending judgment is something I struggle with<br/>
daily, and I&#39;ll need to be vigilant as we go through the process of<br/>
deschooling.  Maybe the deschooling itself will give me the time and space<br/>
to focus on the many, many issues I need to sort out for myself.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the question and for sharing your insight.<br/>

Maybe the intent of mentioning it was to get you to consider whether  <br/>
you&#39;re being competitive at any level, and whether you&#39;re taking any  <br/>
of your own worth as a mother from their &quot;remarkable&quot; milestones.<br/>
<br/>
Walking isn&#39;t remarkable.    All healthy, uninjured three year olds  <br/>
walk.   It&#39;s not possible to pick out those who&#39;ve been walking the  <br/>
longest, and they probably haven&#39;t walked any greater distance.   <br/>
Still just back and forth in the house. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re charting accomplishments (if you continue to), the stress  <br/>
you produce, or the motherly pride, will be detrimental to peaceful,  <br/>
natural learning-for-fun unschooling.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>On the topic of early reading, or reading at all for that matter i<br/>
thought i would share my experiences so far. I started helping my<br/>
older son learn phonics when he was four. He loved it and consistently<br/>
wanted to practice, and do worksheets. He didn&#39;t begin reading<br/>
fluently until past the age of six. I was quite concerned at the time<br/>
that he was behind, because i couldn&#39;t figure out for the longest time<br/>
why he knew all the sounds but had trouble putting them together. One<br/>
day it just clicked for him and he picked it up very quickly beyond<br/>
that point. My younger son is four now and has very little desire to<br/>
even learn the alphabet. Then i became worried about him being behind.<br/>
Since joining this group i have realized they are both fine and i<br/>
shouldn&#39;t be worried about any of it, them having different learning<br/>
styles than each other, or taking things at their own paces. I think i<br/>
will be okay with it now if my younger son doesn&#39;t read until an older<br/>
age. Hearing other people&#39;s experiences helped put it in perspective<br/>
for me. As long as i continue offering him oppertunies to play and<br/>
learn he will read when he&#39;s ready. That will be okay with me.<br/>
Probably not okay with my Mother, but they aren&#39;t her kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2024003936">After working for several years with severely physically and mentally<br/>
handicapped children, I learned to be excited when the kids I worked with<br/>
made very small accomplishments and we helped the staff recognize each one.<br/>
When the staff saw that they were doing more than just maintaining these<br/>
kids, they began to take more interest in them as individuals and to<br/>
celebrate that.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
When I became a parent for the first time, I could hardly believe how<br/>
quickly and easily almost anything came to my first child.  It is marvelous<br/>
at any age.  So, I guess you could see it as more like a celebration and<br/>
mindfulness of their accomplishments, rather than comparison or boasting.  <br/>

their precociousness in learning those things (which is why I chose those,<br/>
in particular to make my point), and like I said, they did it before I began<br/>
interfering with them.  My point was to underscore the fact that they learn<br/>
how to do things just fine on their own.<br/>

understand why I chose the word remarkable.  Or maybe not.  Maybe it is one<br/>
of those things that amazes a mother and no one else.<br/>

there will ever be a time when I stop noticing their unique skills and<br/>
talents and interests.  I wonder how one eliminates motherly pride<br/>
completely, if it&#39;s possible, and what the advantages are to doing so.  I<br/>
can certainly see pitfalls in an overabundance of motherly pride and the<br/>
damage it could cause, but I wonder if that pride has no place at all in an<br/>
unschooling family&#39;s life.<br/>

If you want to participate on this list, it would be better if you  <br/>

children are unique in their talents and special in their own ways.<br/>
Maybe she finds joy in maveling at her children and their<br/>
accomplishments. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Of course that&#39;s true, and nothing in what I wrote or in the original  <br/>
question (I don&#39;t even remember who asked it; it doesn&#39;t matter,  <br/>
we&#39;re here to talk about ideas, not people) suggested otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-There is nothing wrong with a Mother feeling proud of<br/>
her children and the things she sees them learn to do. -=-<br/>
<br/>
There CAN potentially be something wrong with it.  If you don&#39;t  <br/>
believe that&#39;s true, go back up this thread and read it again.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s absolutely nothing wrong with it if the mother involved needs  <br/>
things to brag about at her bragging sessions, wherever they are.<br/>
<br/>
For the purposes of unschooling (and this list) there can be a  <br/>
problem if the mom loves to tell people how young her child was, how  <br/>
quickly he &quot;taught himself,&quot; etc.  It might not be a problem, but  <br/>
each mom can think within herself whether those brags are about the  <br/>
joy she felt, the relief, or whether there was a feeling of smugness,  <br/>
as though she did that or it made her a better mom.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Everything our children accomplish<br/>
makes us feel good. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Try to word things in a more personal and less general way, when you  <br/>
can remember to do so.  Speaking for all us us isn&#39;t as good as  <br/>
sharing your own experiences.<br/>

And with first or only children, moms often write down when things  <br/>
happen, and get really excited.  They&#39;re learning how to be moms and  <br/>
it&#39;s all new and thrilling.<br/>
<br/>
There are outside factors, though, that can turn it all into  <br/>
comparisons and criticisms of the mom or of the child, and those are  <br/>
worth avoiding.  If the mom&#39;s heart and emotions are really in the  <br/>
celebration and marvel mode, it&#39;s not a problem.<br/>
<br/>
It was a good idea, I think, that someone asked whey/whether the ages  <br/>
were stated, just to get people to think about that.  I doubt that  <br/>
Olympic runners were the earliest walkers.   It&#39;s really not a race  <br/>

I meant that to be contingent on the original idea, of whether the  <br/>
exact age of a child at each accomplisment was going to be something  <br/>
to celebrate or bemoan, that it won&#39;t be the best thing for good  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If you can chart accomplishments without taking credit yourself, or  <br/>
without feeling the need to pressure the child or hide the sad facts  <br/>
from others, then my statement doesn&#39;t apply.<br/>
<br/>
IF there&#39;s a danger, then it&#39;s a danger to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s no danger in the mom&#39;s biochemical attachment to the  <br/>
child&#39;s learning, then warning can be disregarded.<br/>

with an Aha! moment!  I even love it when they do something again <br/>
and again simply because they enjoy it!  This morning, my dd8, <br/>
Allison, figured out a math problem before me.  I was very proud <br/>
that she figured it out quickly, and felt sheepish when she had to <br/>
explain it to me because I still couldn&#39;t figure it out!  I don&#39;t <br/>
know if she has a more mathematical bent than I do, or if she&#39;s just <br/>
not encumbered by all the complications impressed upon me over the <br/>
years.  But it took her less than 10 seconds and I was amazed!  I <br/>
oohed and aahed and told her that was brilliant thinking.  I don&#39;t <br/>
feel that was a bad thing to do.  She was thrilled with herself!  I <br/>
agree with you that an overabundance could be a problem, but surely <br/>
it&#39;s human nature to be proud of our offspring!  My kids rock!  (Of <br/>
course yours do too.  *laugh*)<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, when my DH got home, I showed him the problem because I was so <br/>
proud of our daughter and he showed us another way to look at it <br/>
that I hadn&#39;t thought about either!  So this time both my daughter <br/>
and I ooohed and aahed over Dad&#39;s brilliant thinking!  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-69287737">I think there is a difference between those happy (proud) feelings we have<br/>
when our children master something that might have been difficult once (or<br/>
that they worked hard at) and between the pride that one feels when one<br/>
feels responsible for having taught a child something.  I am not sure I can<br/>
differentiate this clearly.  I know mothers who not only feel a sense of<br/>
pride ( a gloaty pride ~ my kid did X, insinuating that she is better than<br/>
your child) when their child masters something (riding a bike or reading,<br/>
for instance ) but who also feel a sense of shame if their child isn&#39;t up to<br/>
standards.  From what I have observed, when one feel responsible for what<br/>
their child learns (or not) it makes it very difficult if not impossible to<br/>
unschool.  The parent has far too much riding on what their child knows or<br/>
can do.  Some parents define themselves by what their children can or can&#39;t<br/>
do.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I feel a sense of pride (a shared joy, really) when my children master some<br/>
skill that might have been hard for them at one time.  I feel a sense of<br/>
pride (elation, joy) when they do something that our society finds valuable<br/>
sometimes.  (I was proud of them for doing well at Pony Club Quiz Rally<br/>
despite their lack of schooling but not just so I could tell all my<br/>
relatives that they did well but because I shared their joy.  I was also<br/>
proud of them for participating in Quiz Rally because at one time standing<br/>
up in front of a group of people was very scary to them.)  When they try<br/>
something and fail at it, I am also proud of them for trying.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
But my ego isn&#39;t attached to the outcome of what they do.  If they try<br/>
something and fail at it, I am not ashamed of them.  If they try something<br/>
and excel at it, I do not feel like I can now hold my head up any higher<br/>
than before.  It doesn&#39;t change how I feel about them nor how I feel about<br/>
how other people perceive me.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I know one mom who tried to unschool.  She really didn&#39;t get it on a very<br/>
deep level though and she was so concerned with how other people saw her (as<br/>
reflected by what her child knew) that she did great Unschooling until her<br/>
child no longer appeared to be ahead of her peers.  It all fell apart when<br/>
the child no longer seemed to excel by her standards.  She is now in school.<br/>

from a textbook packaged program to unschooling.  I was talking to <br/>
another homeschooler and she voiced her approval of my choice, saying <br/>
that my young kids, ages 4 and 6 at the time, should be free to learn <br/>
naturally.  Having her &quot;approve&quot; was weird enough, but then I <br/>
understood when she continued with the next statement that she too <br/>
unschooled her child when he was much younger, but that she went to a <br/>
textbook program when school actually mattered because unschooling <br/>
really doesn&#39;t work for true school-aged children.  I remember her <br/>
going on and on about what kids HAVE TO know, blah blah blah.  :)<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is not directed at the original poster, but I also wanted to add that<br/>
when other people read or hear these activities connected to ages, it often<br/>
makes them think about their own children, and whether they would measure up<br/>
to this person who is caring enough about the ages of the activities to<br/>
mention them.<br/>
<br/>
I think one reason people get excited when their children do something<br/>
younger than other children is because there is still a connection to ideas<br/>
of &quot;normal standards&quot;...overgeneralized standards that are made that way so<br/>
that classrooms can have the same material for each age group (and maybe for<br/>
other reasons I&#39;m not thinking of right now). If we step away from those<br/>
standards, it is easier to see that each child is individual and will do<br/>
things in their own ways at their own times. And each one is so cool no<br/>
matter what age they did such and such.<br/>
<br/>
One question to ask may be: would the pride be felt if the ages the<br/>
activities &quot;achieved&quot; were older? If you take away the ages, can you still<br/>
say the same thing excitedly? (not to original poster, just an idea out<br/>
there) Like, &quot;So and so learned to read!&quot; Or &quot;So and so learned to walk!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It might be kind of silly saying the second one about a four year old<br/>
though.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is not directed at the original poster, but I also wanted to add that<br/>
when other people read or hear these activities connected to ages, it often<br/>
makes them think about their own children, and whether they would measure up<br/>
to this person who is caring enough about the ages of the activities to<br/>
mention them.<br/>
<br/>
I think one reason people get excited when their children do something<br/>
younger than other children is because there is still a connection to ideas<br/>
of &quot;normal standards&quot;...overgeneralized standards that are made that way so<br/>
that classrooms can have the same material for each age group (and maybe for<br/>
other reasons I&#39;m not thinking of right now). If we step away from those<br/>
standards, it is easier to see that each child is individual and will do<br/>
things in their own ways at their own times. And each one is so cool no<br/>
matter what age they did such and such.<br/>
<br/>
One question to ask may be: would the pride be felt if the ages the<br/>
activities &quot;achieved&quot; were older? If you take away the ages, can you still<br/>
say the same thing excitedly? (not to original poster, just an idea out<br/>
there) Like, &quot;So and so learned to read!&quot; Or &quot;So and so learned to walk!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It might be kind of silly saying the second one about a four year old<br/>
though.<br/>

Well said. Comparing children is all about the parents self-esteem.<br/>
  Mind you, when my 2yo learned to hold her head up a few weeks ago I did call all my friends and tell them! You could tell they were underwhelmed but its a huge acheivment for a spastic quadraplegic child who the docs said would be a vegetable. C was pretty excited too and grinned like a loon.<br/>
  Having C has taught me more about expectations and treating each child as an individual than anything I&#39;ve ever done or read!<br/>

to begin to walk until they are around 4. Because of environmental <br/>
dangers, like jaguars and snakes and the like, it is safer for a parent <br/>
or older sibling to carry children with them much of the time. Because <br/>
of diet restrictions, Ache children and adults are smaller than most <br/>
American or British children I know, so it is less of a back breaking <br/>
labor to tote a 3 1/2 year old out to go foraging in the jungle. If a <br/>
toddler toddles off into the jungle, the likelihood that they will be <br/>
found alive again is pretty low.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281111651">Having children with disabilities, I can say it is never silly to  <br/>
feel pride when your child achieves. I know several people who&#39;s  <br/>
children didn&#39;t start walking until two or three, and I nearly burst  <br/>
when my Bre said Mama for the first time at age five! One would hope  <br/>
that any parent could feel equally pleased for their children. :-)<br/>

thrilled if he ever walked, while it&#39;s a little of a ho-hum thing,  <br/>
comparatively, in a third or fourth child if you were expecting it.<br/>
<br/>
I was very excited when Kirby started walking, because it was the  <br/>
first time I&#39;d ever had a baby and everything was exciting.   Marty  <br/>
didn&#39;t crawl.  He had a much more efficient way of getting around,  <br/>
sitting up, holding something in one hand and lifting and launching  <br/>
along with the other arm and the opposite leg.  He was fast and  <br/>
upright early, and could see where he was going, and travel long  <br/>
distances.  When he stood up and walked I wasn&#39;t nearly as happy as  <br/>
the first time, because I had kinda counted on him being a short- <br/>
range floor guy for a while, as Kirby was three.   With Holly, I knew  <br/>
she would walk and she did.  No thrill or disappointment either.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago a friend&#39;s baby had a hip problem and didn&#39;t walk &quot;on  <br/>
time,&quot; and they put her in a big horse-shoe looking cast from the  <br/>
waist down, with a stick between the legs, which made her easy to  <br/>
carry and made the whole thing more stable.  I felt sorry for her,  <br/>
naturally.  But she learned to walk WITH IT ON, and so we had no  <br/>
question than when it came off she&#39;d be running and jumping pretty  <br/>
soon.   SO she was probably four when she first walked in such a way  <br/>
that no one would know there had been earlier problems and I bet her  <br/>
parents had sweet dreams and woke up relieved lots of days.<br/>

Holly  might&#39;ve walked sooner if we hadn&#39;t been carrying her so much,  <br/>
but we didn&#39;t mind.  We had two other little ones, a couple of great  <br/>
backpacks, and she rode me or her dad a long time.  She was a preemie  <br/>
and didn&#39;t get big very quickly, which was an advantage as it turned  <br/>
out, in getting our family of five from one place to another.   We  <br/>
were really not in a hurry for her to walk.<br/>
