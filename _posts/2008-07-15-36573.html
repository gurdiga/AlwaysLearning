<div id="ygrps-yiv-355339154">My kids and I need some fresh new ideas to get us out of a rut.  We&#39;re <br/>
bored and want some fun things to do close to home as money is a little <br/>
tight.  Jeffrey just had a birthday.  He&#39;s 12 and he got lots of new <br/>
Lego kits and video games.  Allie (10) and I treated ourselves to some <br/>
new Legos and video games too.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband asked me to try to get on a better schedule for him.  The <br/>
kids and I were staying up late and then sleeping late.  We did great <br/>
for a while but we&#39;ve drifted back into our old schedule.  There&#39;s <br/>
something very appealing at being awake until 2:00am.  I am trying to <br/>
explain to my DH that the kids are busy doing their own things during <br/>
the day hours and at night after he goes to bed, I absolutely love the <br/>
time I have with Jeffrey and Allie.  We watch tv, read books, and play <br/>
games.  My DH doesn&#39;t understand why we can&#39;t have that togetherness <br/>
during day hours.  I think it&#39;s because they can do anything during the <br/>
day but we have to be mostly quiet after he has gone to bed.  Our home <br/>
is really small and this is how we&#39;ve adapted to living together.  <br/>

It says 4/5 year old activities but can be for older kids as well.<br/>
