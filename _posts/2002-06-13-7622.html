<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720791147">Dear Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I tend to speak negatively about the city I live in. <br/>
It is boring and not what I would call a &quot;real city&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Lack of good restaurants, not much great Theatre, few<br/>
attractions.<br/>
<br/>
But, your post has left me feeling fortunate.  Though<br/>
I live in a neighborhood in the city limits, with<br/>
about half the homes rented to university students, I<br/>
am happy to report that in the 3 years we&#39;ve been here<br/>
I have experienced none of the<br/>
domestic disturbances that  surround you.<br/>
<br/>
How ghastly.<br/>
<br/>
As I stated in my post, I know that there are<br/>
situations that require intervention.  Children<br/>
screaming to high-heaven and animals treated cruelly<br/>
certainly merit that kind of attention.  I hope the<br/>
authorities in your area make a difference when you<br/>
call them.<br/>
<br/>
I couldn&#39;t/wouldn&#39;t remain in such a hostile<br/>
atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
With greatest sympathy,<br/>
Melinda<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
We don&#39;t hear it every day.  Bandit, the shepherd, was given away to another <br/>
family.  We were all relieved.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly sees these things she snuggles up to me and says she&#39;s glad our <br/>
family&#39;s not like that.  And often there&#39;s not anyone home at those houses, <br/>
because of people going to school, work, who knows where, so pretty much we <br/>
have peace, and our dog can leave the yard but rarely does, and our cats can <br/>
come in and out, and our kids and their friends can come in and out.<br/>
