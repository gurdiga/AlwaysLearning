<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Does anybody have any sweet grandparent names?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The Germans use Oma and Opa.  Long o sound.  Added benefit that those are<br/>
easy for little kids to say, so they don&#39;t turn into things like &quot;Gumma&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My grandparents had different names (Grandma & Grandpa, Granny & Gramps),<br/>
and I like that for my son, too.  Then we don&#39;t get into the Grandma Leonard<br/>
and Grandma Killen bit.  So my parents (who have other grandkids) are the<br/>
standard Grandma and Grandpa, and my dh&#39;s (for whom Tim is the only<br/>
grandchild) chose to be Oma and Opa.<br/>
<br/>
Just as a funny aside on this, I have a great aunt still alive.  When Tim<br/>
met her for the first time, he was 4, and we had explained that she was his<br/>
Great-Great Aunt Anna.  In his mind, that was two greats and two annas, so 2<br/>
people.  He must have asked her 8 times during that first visit where the<br/>
other Anna was!  In the end, he called her Aunt Anna, just like I do!<br/>

Julie, he got &quot;Doolie&quot;. The whole town knew her as &quot;Doolie&quot;. My other <br/>

she made it into a production. At first we said Oma or Omi (Cameron was born <br/>
in Germany, and that&#39;s what all our neighbors called them), but she didn&#39;t <br/>
like that. She wanted some childspeak form of Nancy, her name. Cameron could <br/>
SAY Nancy, so she didn&#39;t get anything &quot;cute&quot;. So she decided on &quot;Nanche&#39; &quot;. I <br/>
thought it sounded Mexican, so we started to call her &quot;Grandma Taco&quot;---she <br/>
DIDN&#39;T like that. She finally settled on &quot;Nanny&quot; with Cameron. But she makes <br/>
Duncan call her &quot;Nanee&#39; &quot;---accent on the &quot;e&quot; (like Pam&#39;s Grandmama&#39; &quot; &lt;g&gt;).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1077571133">My mom is called &quot;Rooney&quot;.  Her name is Linda.  Don&#39;t know how I came <br/>
up with &quot;Rooney&quot; as a kid, but now, my DD calls her that, instead of <br/>
a Grandma knockoff of some kind.  DD calls her Grandfather on her <br/>
Dad&#39;s side &quot;Granpa Ito&quot;.  I think Ito is spanish for Grandfather...<br/>

Abuela though...<br/>
