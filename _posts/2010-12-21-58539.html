&lt;&lt;You may also need to compromise on things like outside lessons. Is your ex <br/>
willing to take P to lessons? That could be a way for him to &quot;be involved in her <br/>
education&quot; and feel good about his contribution to her life. &gt;&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
The &#39;feel good about his contribution to her life&#39; (as I discovered when really <br/>
trying to hear is concerns) is a major factor for him. Basically his desire to <br/>
&#39;seek legal advice&#39; was so he knew where his rights stood as a parent so he <br/>
could ensure what he believed to be the best thing for P was done and if he <br/>
couldn&#39;t do this then &quot;What am I here for?&quot;, was/is his question. Unfortunately <br/>
there has been many a time that I have had to help him see his importance to her <br/>
and the most basic thing is just because he is her dad, you can&#39;t get more <br/>
important! I think I will just have to keep updating him of little things that <br/>
she says and does that are related to him so he knows it isn&#39;t just the <br/>
weekend/dinner contact that she is &#39;with him&#39;. <br/>

&lt;&lt;There is a slight possibility (slight) that he has considered that if you <br/>
unschool her she will be way too happy at your house and he can&#39;t compete. Or <br/>
that if you teach her, that she will resist seeing you and he will get to have <br/>
her more. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That guess is pessimistic and suspicious, and I hope I&#39;m just wrong, but it <br/>
might be worth gently pointing that out to him to see whether he had considered <br/>
those things.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately this isn&#39;t a slight possibility on his part. For myself though, I <br/>
have never considered this to even be a factor with P given our relationship and <br/>
also having done lessons etc... (prior to finding unschooling) where it did not <br/>
impact on her choice of homes to live in. At the end of the day though, if <br/>
lessons were my conviction and this made her want to spend more time at her <br/>
fathers, that would be her choice (and his).<br/>
 <br/>
This also isn&#39;t something that has just come up with unschooling though. We have <br/>
many animals and with each addition I would see him feel and think &#39;how am I <br/>
going to compete&#39;. It was never an issue though and she has never not wanted to <br/>
go and see him because of having the animals. I will have to remind him of past <br/>
realities. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
It is though something that has come up for him to be &#39;about&#39; unschooling as now <br/>
that we are striving toward consensual living P has a DS, an XBox and also loves <br/>
on line and PC games. This would be a good time to note that previously I <br/>
was the anti-technology dictator and fearer! (A great big thank you =) to <br/>
someone who posted about &#39;Zoo Tycoon&#39; many months ago, P loves it and we now <br/>
have it on the PC and DS!). Her desired subject matter is currently anything <br/>
gaming. =) I suppose though that it is the &#39;unrestricted&#39; use of these things <br/>
and knowing that she has choices in our house that has possibly overwhelmed him <br/>
and compounded his fear of her not wanting to see him. Again I will have to make <br/>
mention that the contrary is our and his actual reality. Only once she did <br/>
not want to go and I realised it was because she had a new game, so now I make a <br/>
mental note not to give her a new game within 2 days of her weekend with him. =) <br/>
 This for me is part of my effort to extend consensual living outwardly to my <br/>
parter, ex-husband and others in my life, hopefully strangers too. I have found <br/>
it much easier to do this with the girls and have had difficulty getting past my <br/>
own ego to be able to be like this with my partner. =)  Trying to be mindful on <br/>
a daily basis helps a lot, so does &#39;think before you speak!&#39;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;As someone else pointed out, if she knows that it&#39;s because of him that you&#39;re <br/>
&quot;making her&quot; do &quot;schoolwork,&quot; she will be mad at BOTH of you, only you will have <br/>
done all the work to harden her poor young heart.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
M and I have the advantage of knowing eachother for 17  years now, since we were <br/>
teenagers. We were very close friends for many of those years before being <br/>
married later down the track. I feel that this is what helps us do the right <br/>
thing by eachother and for P. Even though we have both changed as people and do <br/>
not interact as close friends any longer, there is still that feeling of <br/>
closeness. This helps to prevent either of us from doing extra harm to P in <br/>
those ways and also being mindful and putting our egos aside. We set up rules <br/>
together, no negative talk in front of her in any situation and if need be, we <br/>
meet alone to discuss. This is aslo implemented at home without the other parent <br/>
around, &#39;gossip&#39; and conversations that involve the other parent are not had in <br/>
front of the girls.<br/>
 <br/>
There are some days that she as most children with separated parents makes <br/>
comment about prefering the other parent. I either gently explain that her <br/>
fathers days with her are specifically set aside for her alone and the reality <br/>
would be very similar as in our own home with him having to work and juggle time <br/>
etc... Otherwise I am grateful for the benefits of her being able to have his <br/>
undivided attention.<br/>
<br/>

 <br/>
Thank you everyone for the blogging information and links. Tally Ho! I am so <br/>
excited that I now have an excuse to do it and get to learn something new! =)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-43115558">Maybe give him this book - it is a paperback and you can find it used <br/>
on Amazon. It really emphasizes a lot how important fathers are in their <br/>
daughters&#39; lives and gives lots of ideas. It might help him focus on <br/>
being important in her life in ways other than academics.<br/>
