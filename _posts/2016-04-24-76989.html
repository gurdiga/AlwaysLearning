<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026662818">Don’t believe everything you read. <br/>
Don’t believe ANYthing you read, unless it seems true and there is some back-up corroboration, evidence, sense to it.<br/>
<br/>
I read something and it smelled like… bullshit.<br/>
And I read it again and saw that it had been written in a very leading (misleading) way, but with joy and enthusiasm. <br/>
<br/>
So I’m looking up above and see that it could apply to my whole website.<br/>
And I agree.  And I’ve said “Don’t do anything you don’t understand” a fair number of times!<br/>
And I&#39;ve said “Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch” a hundred dozen times.<br/>
<br/>
But this will come into your life:  Your relatives, and friends, and detractors are going to bring you articles and say “LOOK!  Scientists know that…” and in the chessgame that conversations are, it’s going to be your move.  Now what?<br/>
<br/>
I have a “field trip” for people with some extra time and curiosity. It’s not about unschooling, but it IS the sort of information that can cause backstage confusion in an unschooling life.  Skip it if you’re busy or don’t care.  No problem.<br/>
<br/>
I have a small set of internet writings (I won’t say “articles,” because the line between “article” and “blogpost” and “comment” has gone all blurry recently) you can practice on.  I want to comment on them, but I’m going to leave the links and wait a while to see what others discover.   It’s a group project.  It’s a test some could fail, so don’t jump in and comment easily, nor even at all, if you don’t have time to read thoughtfully and carefully.    <br/>
<br/>
In the first one, the writing itself is the subject of the rest.<br/>
The first comment (there aren’t many) has a Big Clue about how it’s being read, and (perhaps) what kind of people are excited about it.  Extra points for finding what I rolled my eyes about when I saw the first comment.<br/>
<br/>
But before I saw that comment, I went to look for the cited psychologist.  Found one (1) page/mention.  But she’s Russian, so the rest might not be accessible to me.  Okay.<br/>
<br/>
Found the second piece of writing.  Read comments (there are very few) and I commented.<br/>
<br/>
I’ll be back here to write some more.  MAYBE I can wait until tomorrow.  POSSIBLY I can wait eight hours.  It kind of depends on how I feel and whether other people post and whether other more interesting things come into my day.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you go, I hope you have fun. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203384212">I was SO confused by that first article! To the point that I read it twice trying to figure out if I&#39;d misunderstood. Was it a study on kids who were, as the title indicated, without the internet for a whole day? Or was it a study of kids who weren&#39;t allowed to communicate with anyone at all by any means for a whole day? I finally figured out that it was the second but they described it as the first.  <br/>
<br/>
And what&#39;s with &quot;entertained by things not of their making&quot;.....  Wouldn&#39;t that include reading books or following needlework patterns...or if we want to stretch it far enough riding a bike that someone else had invented and manufactured? Or playing a game someone had taught them?  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1469710275">I rolled my eyes at this:<br><br><strong>~ today’s generation of&nbsp;young people are too often entertained
 by&nbsp;things not of&nbsp;their making, are incapable of&nbsp;finding ways to&nbsp;keep 
themselves busy, and are completely unfamiliar with the idea of&nbsp;the 
world of&nbsp;their imagination</strong> ~<br><br>So the books (I assume they were books) were of their own making? They were required to write, then read their own stories? Ha!<br><br>And the instruments they were allowed to play - were they made by someone else for the purpose of entertaining the player? Not allowed, by this criteria. Nor, I suspect, the music written that they might read in order to play.<br><br>Hmm. Needlework. (Seriously? Only nerds like me do embroidery...)

<div dir='ltr'><div>I noted that the very first thing that 42 out of the 63 people did when they stopped the experiment was to seek out other people via social media, cell phone, or in person. And the other 1/3 either turned on the TV (which many people do when they&#39;re alone, as a way of feeling not so alone) or got immersed in a video game, which is generally an extremely social environment. Clearly this was an experiment about social isolation, not about technology deprivation. But because in most cases they used technology to reconnect with people, that was taken as proof that they were missing the technology, not the people.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-988544860">-=-I learned a word which I had not previously heard: &quot;Clickbait”.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It wasn’t a good example of the worst of clickbait, though.  The article was all on one page! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Very many blog posts in the world, when there are advertisements in the sidebar, are designed to get people in there and keep them there.  Many blogposts are cut and pasted from others—not so much people’s personal blogs, I mean, but the “news” and entertainment blogs.  Years back a letter I had was put in a blog called “Letters of Note.”  Dozens of other blogs wrote something about it, but mostly it was the stealing of two versions of a very short blurb.  Cut and paste, change the title.<br/>
<br/>
In the case of the first article, as I was reading it I was thinking “When?  Where was this study?”  There was no mention of a year, or a university, or a city, or a journal in which it might’ve been published.  Nor was there a researcher named.  The article seemed to imply that the named author was the researcher, but it didn’t state it.<br/>
<br/>
Their description might have been based on an already-vague description, but I had hoped to be able to find other reports of the study to find out:<br/>
<br/>
—what were the participants given as compensation to be a part of the study, if anything<br/>
—Was it school vacation/holiday, or a weekend?  That would matter, for teens.  [Schoolwork was mentioned, but was it over spring break where there were several days left, or was this taking a Saturday from a school kid?]  <br/>
—were they in their own homes, or in an apartment owned by the researcher?  Did they have their own stuff, or a stranger’s stuff?<br/>
<br/>
All in all, though, it seemed fishy to me.  And then to read what some of the kids did (one went to an amusement park?), they WERE in contact with others.  So I really wanted to see the original “contract,” because it seemed the experiment was worthlessly set up.<br/>
<br/>
But I couldn’t find anything, and in looking found that second piece of writing by someone who also thought it sounded wrong and had also gone looking.<br/>
<br/>
But back to the first link—it was presented in a subtly snarky way.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Others turned on the TV or plunged into playing computer games. In addition, almost all of them soon thrust their headphones into their ears.-=-<br/>
<br/>
THRUST and PLUNGED ?  <br/>
Yikes.  <br/>
<br/>
This, because of the way it is worded, becomes a flat-out lie:<br/>
<br/>
-=-All of them, without any exceptions, said that they were extremely surprised by the thoughts that were crossing their minds during the experiment, but they were unable to examine them rationally because of the overall deterioration of their psychological state.-=-<br/>
<br/>
NONE of them said “I was unable to examine my thoughts rationally because of the overall deterioration of my psychological state.”  The sentence as written says that without exception, each participant (even those who quit early?) said they were shocked but didn’t have the means to examine their own thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
And this is the biggest lie of all, but that is increasingly true of “journalism”—the headline.<br/>
&quot;A thought-provoking experiment showed what happens when children don’t have the internet for a whole day”<br/>
<br/>
Considering, now, the writing itself and the lack of any documentation, I will not be surprised if this is tracked down and the study pre-dates the internet altogether.  Seriously. It was NOT about the internet.  It was about deprivation of human contact.<br/>
<br/>
-=-They were allowed to describe how they felt at the time of the experiment, and keep a record their actions and thoughts. In the case of excessive anxiety, discomfort or stress the project leaders would recommend stopping the experiment immediately, recording the time and the reason for its termination.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Where WERE these “project leaders”?  Were the kids being observed?<br/>
Again, the account has internal contradictions.<br/>
<br/>
I have other thoughts.  I’ll wait.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453709738">-=-The writer of Sandra&#39;s second link estimates this story would have generated ~$100,000s.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Very unlikely that it did, though.  Those operate is parts of pennies.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-Sad if the &quot;article&quot; is actually made up, and stands to have a destructive impact on peoples lives.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Well here’s where critical thinking is really important.<br/>
<br/>
When someone reads something (from following an interesting-looking link, or because it’s used as defense of an argument, or because someone’s mom or sister or friend says “READ THIS—this is why I don’t think you should be unschooling [or whatever]”…. it’ good to have a mental framework, or checklist, or stance that will help you judge how seriously to take the information.<br/>
<br/>
Is the site full of advertisements and is the title of the article irresponsible?<br/>
That’s not a crime.  Honestly, these days that’s happening with Psychology Today and Smithsonian, both of which used to be nice print magaznes with very few, very tasteful, very in-the-back-of-the-magazine, small ads.  <br/>
So it’s not, by itself, a reason to disregard the article.<br/>
<br/>
But it might be worth asking the relative who sent it to you to track down the original story.  Let THEM do the work to prove or disprove the article, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
And ALL articles are “made up” to the extent that reading a summary of a report is not “the report.”  And “The report” of research is not itself the research.<br/>
<br/>
Reading the summary of a study is still a summary.  <br/>
<br/>
Partly I’m saying “relax.”<br/>
Partly I’m saying be alert and vigilant.<br/>
Mostly, then, I’m saying learn to be calm but intelligent when you read things. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Lots of things are worth reading and forgetting.<br/>
<br/>
-=--=-Sad if the &quot;article&quot; is actually made up, and stands to have a destructive impact on peoples lives.-=—=-<br/>
<br/>
Misleading and half-assed, more than “made up,”  I think.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a whole lot of irresponsible writing on the internet that could have a harmful affect on readers.  <br/>
Truth and good ideas are mixed up with nonsense.  Rejecting all of it is as bad as believing all of it.  <br/>

<br/>
Just as bad as this new example, huh?<br/>
<br/>
That was another one of my irritations with the article and those who would applaud it.<br/>
The very first comment there (which isn’t the first comment anymore and now I can’t find it—doh! sorry)  said “a whole day” and another comment said “12 hours.”  But the article said 8 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Today, there are more comments showing, and lots of them said the same things people have written here, so I feel better.  Yesterday it looked like the comments were supportive, grateful relieved.  <br/>
<br/>
The article said &quot;The author of the experiment, a family psychologist, wanted to prove her working hypothesis that the today’s generation of young people are too often entertained by things not of their making, are incapable of finding ways to keep themselves busy, and are completely unfamiliar with the idea of the world of their imagination. “<br/>
<br/>
It’s not well written, first.  But assuming it has any validity, I question these things:<br/>
<br/>
-=- today’s generation of young people are too often entertained by things not of their making-=-   <br/>
-=-incapable of finding ways to keep themselves busy-=-<br/>
-=-completely unfamiliar with the idea of the world of their imagination-=-<br/>
<br/>
As opposed to when, and who, and what generation?<br/>
There has not, as far as I know, been a time in ANY culture in the history of the world when young people were not being TOLD what to do, and were entertained by things of OTHER people’s making (perhaps their own, but there&#39;s been plenty of art, music, stories, games, jokes, tricks, toys and discussions available in most or all cultures.<br/>
<br/>
As to whether they were familiar with their imaginations or not….. what was written was that they were<br/>
COMPLETELY<br/>
unfamiliar<br/>
with the idea of<br/>
the world of<br/>
their imagination.<br/>
<br/>
That’s a PILE of words used to insult those kids.  <br/>
<br/>
I don’t think there is any such thing as “the world of my imagination.”  I”m wondering I’m I’m familiar with the idea of the world my imagination. :-)<br/>
I’m pretty sure that a request for  me to give up eight hours of my life to help someone else prove a made-up point would be an unreasonable imposition of HER imagination on MY potential to live with other people. :-)<br/>
<br/>
When I’ve had a whole day by myself in my home, in the days before e-mail and such, I usually left at some point to eat in public or with friends.  Eight hours is too long for me to be alone.  It doesn’t feel as good to me as checking on my friends and relatives does, or as making sure someone knows that I’m alive and safe at home feels.<br/>
<br/>
But the “whole day” phrase that kept coming up…. is eight hours “a whole day” for unschoolers?  :-)  SO MUCH can be done, seen, heard, said, thought about and experienced in eight hours of having options and adult partners that I’m glad to hear that most of the volunteers in that experiment decided to quit before wasting more of their time in semi-isolation.<br/>

That (the Willie Wonka video) is not MY imagination. :-)<br/>

Watching videos was against the rules of the “study” / game, right?  <br/>

Take a look and you&#39;ll see<br/>

Anything you want to, do it<br/>
Wanna change the world?<br/>

Escapism and fantasy?  Sometimes it’s fun.  <br/>

But honestly, I think a great unscooling life is better than most people could have imagined.  I’m serious.  It’s not plasticine flowers and rivers of chocolate.   But there can be flowers and chocolate. :-)  And unlike fantasy trips through candy factories where children are magically punished and shamed (that Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is really not very child-friendly and the book shames television viewing, too)…  unschooling can make lots of lives better.<br/>
