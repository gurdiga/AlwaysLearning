<div id="ygrps-yiv-202078514">**So what happened, Deb?<br/>
<br/>
After over a month, I figured they were lost forever in cyber-space.Â  Now<br/>
they&#39;re back up and seem as good as new. What WAS it?**<br/>

<br/>
This is what the webmaster sent me yesterday<br/>
<br/>
***Well, I finally found the problem today; the cgi-bin with the message <br/>
board<br/>
scripts had the wrong permissions. No scripts in the folder would execute<br/>
because of the wrong permissions... Not only did home-ed-magazine.com and<br/>
unschooling.com have DIFFERENT permissions, but also the old server was<br/>
configured in such a way that it didn&#39;t care about this difference. Ughhh...<br/>
<br/>
I finally found the problem today, though. So, it should work now. Please<br/>
let me know if it doesn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your patience.<br/>
