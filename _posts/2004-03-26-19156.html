<div id="ygrps-yiv-392367969">I love this concept. The visuals so clearly communicate the relation of<br/>
inner and outer space and gives you a way to comprehend them. What a<br/>
powerful tool scientific notation is.<br/>
<br/>
The film that Charles and Ray Eames made in the 70s that beautifully<br/>
illustrates this concept, &quot;The powers of Ten&quot; is available on Netflix and<br/>
probably elsewhere. Search for the title:<br/>
<br/>
The Films of Charles & Ray Eames<br/>
<br/>
Nearly all the films from this design team are in this five volume set.<br/>
These are the designers that had major influence in architecture, furniture,<br/>
education, and industry for over half of the twentieth century.<br/>
<br/>
There was also a remake of the film in the 90s that we saw at a museum that<br/>
started off with a dancer&#39;s hoop, one meter across.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1635179051">This is awesome!  I can&#39;t wait to show the girls when they come in from <br/>
playing outside.  Sometimes we lay in bed at night and talk about atoms, <br/>
etc. and we imagine we&#39;re actually just a tiny particle in the big toe <br/>
of some monstrously large being.  They are going to LOVE this.  Thank <br/>
you.   Heidi Case<br/>
