<div id="ygrps-yiv-259004551">Dear Julie S.,<br/>
 <br/>
Was the child small and thin as an infant?  In other words does he fall into the same category he&#39;s been in historically?  Are there any relatives who have the appearance you described in your son?  As the problem started when he came off the bottle, I think I&#39;d offer him a bottle; go back to when it started.<br/>
 <br/>
I think I&#39;d drop the rule about &quot;if you take it please eat it.&quot;  That can create pressure that prevents experimenting.  I abhor wasting food too, and the kids understand that is a problem for me, but if someone takes a bite of something and doesn&#39;t like it, I&#39;ll eat it myself if I want to or my son will if he&#39;s interested, or else it gets tossed.  No one would force a baby to eat past the point where they indicate they&#39;re through.  We trust the baby to know her own body.  Why do we try to start torturous regimens after they&#39;re past babyhood?  If I thought I had to eat a lot of anything I took a bite of, I would only go for foods I already know I like and want, which, for your son, is junk food.  Gaging ourselves is a later skill, but still not a rule.<br/>
 <br/>
If your son is addicted to highly processed carbs, then no, I wouldn&#39;t keep them in the house.  I&#39;d keep lots of fresh fruit though, and offer to cut them up and put them in a bag.  (Most recovering alcoholics don&#39;t keep alcohol in the house or hang out in bars if they really want to be free.  I&#39;m not saying your son is addicted, just drawing a parallel.)  You&#39;ll save money not buying expensive processed foods, making throwing away half-eaten foods more tolerable to the budget.  I have to ask myself, really, am I going to be homeless if 2 or 5% of food is wasted?  We&#39;re on a tight budget too, but when friends come over hungry I don&#39;t think twice about what the food costs.<br/>
 <br/>
I was short and thin and had veins popping out when I was a kid.  (Some of my sibs are tall, some short.  I&#39;m no longer thin!)  I was sick all the time too.  We had plenty of sugar/white flour products in my house when I was a kid.  I&#39;ll bet some people can handle that, but my family was so dysfunctional I became a sugar junkie.  The &quot;sweetness&quot; was missing in our relationships, so I craved it.  I still like sweets, but I use them more normally now because I&#39;ve spent years in therapy learning to be &quot;sweet&quot; to myself in other ways.<br/>
 <br/>
Are you unconsciously doing things that you know are bad for you?  Did you experience any pressure around eating when you were young?  I find this kind of parallel is consistently the source of difficulty for me.  I hold this metaphysical belief that my children have come as beings of light to set me free, and they&#39;ll go to any length to do it.  <br/>
 <br/>
When I&#39;m uncomfortable with what my kids do, I know it&#39;s just the &quot;fire&quot; and I move towards the burning of the situation rather than away.  If I can tolerate the heat inside myself without trying to get them to change to make me comfortable and without &#39;running away&#39; from the situation or thinking about what it all means, I fall into a place of clarity and obtain a mysterious knowing of how to proceed.  Like when I see the kids waste food - I really go inside and feel what I don&#39;t want to feel, because there&#39;s information for me, intelligence in it for me.  Our culture is not accustomed to emotional information, only intellectual.<br/>
 <br/>
It sounds like you&#39;re not about to &#39;run away&#39; or try to avoid this problem.  And you&#39;re already in the fire, so just go into your heart and check out what&#39;s there.  It might break your heart, but it just breaks open, and that&#39;s the only way to deal with children, from an open heart.<br/>
 <br/>
Please let us know how you progress.<br/>

bite--that gives a message I don&#39;t wanna give. <br/>
