<div id="ygrps-yiv-883662641">Hi Jihong<br/>
<br/>
I asked my son Darcy what he&#39;d reply to that question &quot;how can I build<br/>
something like that?&quot; (the city) and he said:<br/>
<br/>
Start with something small like a house / hut,<br/>
Then add to that, small details, using different materials, imagining<br/>
enhancements<br/>
And try changing materials.<br/>
Then just keep improving/adding/changing.<br/>
<br/>
While I typed up his reply I imagined different ways to respond, depending<br/>
on the child, your circumstances, other interests.<br/>
<br/>
My first response would be to tell my son there are a lot of ways to go<br/>
about a project like that, and to ask him what kinds of things he has done<br/>
in the game that are similar, or which aspect of the city he likes, or<br/>
recognises. If he is really very short on ideas, maybe I would honestly<br/>
guess - if I pretend I want to build something like that (not necessarily in<br/>
minecraft, but with materials I do know something about, either lego or clay<br/>
or matchsticks bricks) &quot;if I was using &lt;????&gt; I guess first I might _____<br/>
and then I think I would ____&quot; I&#39;d try to remember to stop as soon as my son<br/>
starts coming up with his own ideas - and if he didn&#39;t I&#39;d quickly try to<br/>
come up with a different approach as an alternative just to prove there are<br/>
other ways.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen some people plan big projects by drafting ideas in sketches first:<br/>
sometimes by starting in one spot and then expanding, but othertimes by<br/>
laying out the available or desired space and then filling in; other times<br/>
by sketching various bits separately and then trying to meld them together.<br/>
<br/>
Others tend to talk and wave their hands while imagining.<br/>
<br/>
Others go quiet, silent somewhere and just sit or lay and imagine for a few<br/>
hours.<br/>
<br/>
For the city in video, the video could be played full screen then paused at<br/>
different points and then examined in detail, trying to guess what was done,<br/>
perhaps with a magnifying glass.<br/>
<br/>
Youtube has comments, so you could add a comment asking the creator how it<br/>
was done - or asking all viewers how they think it was done or would do it.<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;Related videos&quot; come sometimes extend the inspiration.<br/>
<br/>
There is also the strategy of &quot;filing&quot; an idea: hmm, that&#39;s something to<br/>
think about - &quot;let&#39;s sleep on that one and see what we learn over time&quot;.  I<br/>
also use delicious bookmarks; but there are other online bookmarking<br/>
services, or the browser&#39;s bookmark feature (and you could show him how to<br/>
set up folders to collect project ideas).  Alternatively a tool like<br/>
Evernote works like a scrapbook.<br/>
