<div id="ygrps-yiv-1657808544">I&#39;m going to share two things I wrote back to a couple of people whose  <br/>

<br/>
I would like for every post on the AlwaysLearning list to be about  <br/>
unschooling, and about helping people unschool better.  I would like  <br/>
for the posts to be useful to as many people on the list as possible,  <br/>

<br/>
Unschooling pretty much both requires and produces positive thinking.<br/>
Unschooling, unlike some other kinds of homeschooling, nurtures  <br/>
relationships.<br/>
<br/>
This is fact and cannot be changed:  Unschooling is a luxury.   <br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t easy, and it takes time.  It takes ALL of your time  <br/>
and energy to be a good unschooler.    If parents don&#39;t agree on  <br/>
unschooling and one parent puts all her time and another parent puts  <br/>
none, where will those parents be together as a couple?<br/>
<br/>
Any judge anywhere can require that the law be followed.  That&#39;s their  <br/>
job.  There are compulsory education or compulsory attendance laws in  <br/>
every country represented on this list, as far as I know.  Nothing we  <br/>
do or say here changes any laws.   It can&#39;t and it shouldn&#39;t.   Only  <br/>
those who unschool really well have ANY hope of helping change the  <br/>
laws in ten or twenty years by the fact of our grown children being  <br/>
out there as examples of what natural learning can be.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, there is nothing to be gained whatsoever by trying to  <br/>
insist that unschooling is any sort of &quot;right.&quot;  It isn&#39;t.  It&#39;s a  <br/>
luxury.   Those who are married and want to continue to unschool need  <br/>
to stay married.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We have positive thinking pep talks some times!  Sometimes we get down,<br/>
it&#39;s a matter of hormones and chemistry and sunshine and boredom or not.<br/>
Our pep talks pretty much consist of &quot;what will help you be happy right<br/>
here right now?&quot;, followed by &quot;what can I do to help?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
There have been a lot of really unpleasant friend things in the life of<br/>
my older daughter.  It&#39;s generally the cause of her unhappiness. <br/>
However, over the years, she&#39;s started to own her own happiness,<br/>
acknowledging that things can get her down, but she doesn&#39;t have to stay<br/>
there.  I attribute that directly to unschooling and the focus on happy<br/>
respect and personal discovery.<br/>
<br/>
Since I feel that it is part of my duty as a parent to promote and<br/>
create happiness, then naturally that will be a large part of our life! <br/>
I can&#39;t tell you how many parents don&#39;t see that as being a major goal<br/>
in parenting, it&#39;s a lot, and it&#39;s apparent when you get to know some of<br/>
the kids of those parents, and it creates a need for sites for teens<br/>
that give pep talks.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille and I were talking about teen angst the other day.  A certain<br/>
song brought it up.  She said she liked the song but chose not to listen<br/>
to it anymore because it didn&#39;t create happy thinking and reminded her<br/>
of a time in her life when she was pretty unhappy.  We talked a lot<br/>
about that, about how a lot of kids experience that at some point in<br/>
their teen lives, and that many of them never leave that place of<br/>
discontent.  It was cool to see that she recognized that it was<br/>
something that she experienced but found a way to move beyond it.  It<br/>
deeply bothers her that so many kids her age simply aren&#39;t happy.</div>

<br/>
In lotsa conflict.  Which isn&#39;t conducive to unschooling with confidence.<br/>
<br/>
One of the biggest helps for us in that regard is reassurance along the way<br/>
about how unschooling *is* working in our family.  Using specific examples<br/>
and something like an occasional progress report, either verbal or written<br/>
out.  It might not be very obvious how unschooling works unless it&#39;s put in<br/>
schoolish terms at first, unfortunately.  Deschooling doesn&#39;t start until<br/>
one *can* see what unschooling is and many people can&#39;t talk outside of<br/>
school lingo.  So putting unschooling into educationese can begin bridging<br/>
the gap, or chasm, as the case may be.  :)<br/>

It depends what the other parent does.  If one insists on unschooling,  <br/>
then there could be divorce and no unschooling ever.  Unschooling can  <br/>
be jumped into quickly only IF both parents agree or understand it or  <br/>
want to try to understand it.<br/>
<br/>
To move to it step by step, find ways to introduce more interesting  <br/>
family activities so the other spouse gets lots of chances to see and  <br/>
participate in natural learning.<br/>

The reason my kinda-recent analogy of yacht ownership is a good one is  <br/>
that it&#39;s not the sort of purchase or commitment one partner in a  <br/>
marriage can make without the other.   Maybe a billionaire could buy a  <br/>
yacht and tell his wife about it later, but for people even in the  <br/>
millionaire range, it&#39;s just too big a deal for one person to do  <br/>
without the knowledge and consent and cooperation of the other.  And  <br/>
it would probably be the first thing to go in a divorce settlement,  <br/>
just as unschooling would be.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-473190739">- basic housing and transportation<br/>
<br/>
We found ourselves looking for a new vehicle after Ed wrecked our truck in a snow storm 2 weeks ago.  The damage didn&#39;t seem much to us but the insurance company said it was a total loss and paid us a small amount - it was a 2000 model but we took excellent care of it and it only had 78000 miles on it.  We thought it would last us another 10 years.  I really resisted another large monthly payment as I enjoyed the freedom of having no vehicle payment ;)  I finally realized that I was keeping us in turmoil over what we could clearly afford because I was resisting change.  Anyway - we both had to sign on a loan - it took both of us in agreement on what we wanted to harmoniously walk forward together.  If I had begrudgingly given in I would have resented that monthly payment (vehicle) every time I paid the bill or every time I wanted to do something but could not afford it due to thinking it was Ed&#39;s fault because he insisted on the new vehicle.  I even told Ed I just needed time and space to adjust and to please be patient with me - he gave me that time and space - trusting that I&#39;d let him know when I was ready to move forward.   When I was ready I let him know I was OK with it and we could sign the papers.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re also in the middle of repairing the rot on our house - yea when it rains it pours - meaning new siding and 9 new windows.  The house is only 15 years old but I won&#39;t go into that ;)  just saying that too had to be a joint decision.  At first we didn&#39;t think we&#39;d have to replace windows - then Ed called me at work Tuesday and suggested I come straight home after work so he could show me the rotted windows and that we&#39;d have to pick out windows.  I would not have been happy if he had picked out windows without me.  It needed to be a joint decision.<br/>
<br/>
I definately would be an unhappy person (wife) if I drove up one day and there sat a new vehicle and basically a new house!  Not that he could do it without my siganture on the loan papers but if he could, there would be resentment and always that feeling of mistrust.  Because we made the decisions together (like we do with unschooling/parenting/partnering) we will pull together and enjoy it all together as a family.  <br/>

Our 25th wedding anniversary is in June ;)  <br/>

<br/>
-=-Our 25th wedding anniversary is in June ;) -=-<br/>
<br/>
Keith and I will have been married 25 years on March 31, this month.   <br/>
Early on, before we were married, when I had a better job than Keith  <br/>
did, but he had a house he was renting for $300 a month from his  <br/>
parents (and later bought from them--still just his house and not  <br/>
mine, which is fine with me), we lived together and shared money and  <br/>
we had a deal not to spend more than $30 without checking with the  <br/>
other person.<br/>
<br/>
That didn&#39;t include groceries or things like that, but while I might  <br/>
buy a $25 hand mixer or something, if I wanted to buy something  <br/>
fancier or more expensive, I&#39;d talk to Keith.  It included clothes,  <br/>
and shoes, and such.<br/>
<br/>
Thirty years later, that figure has crept up, mutually.  I remember  <br/>
feeling nervous five years or so ago when I bid $300 on a microscope  <br/>
on eBay.  Keith bought a leather jacket for $190 I hadn&#39;t known about,  <br/>
but he doesn&#39;t love it and is sending it back.  I encouraged him to  <br/>
keep it; it was on sale.  But it doesn&#39;t fit him perfectly.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re in our 50&#39;s.  When we were in our 20&#39;s and 30&#39;s, we were very  <br/>
careful with money.  We still are, there&#39;s just more money, after so  <br/>
many years.  But I loved and was committed to Keith when he was  <br/>
working crummy jobs, so I get to share the benefits of his having been  <br/>
an engineer for over 20 years.<br/>
<br/>
There are everyday courtesies that some people forget to use in  <br/>
everyday relationships.  Some people seem to think marriage means  <br/>
never having to say you&#39;re sorry (or please or thank you).  It&#39;s  <br/>
unhealthy.  It&#39;s what divorced people see in the rearview mirror, often.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m divorced. It&#39;s a long story, and we didn&#39;t have kids, and we  <br/>
didn&#39;t marry for love.  We married so two children (his brother and  <br/>
sister) could stay in their own home after their mom died.  Their dad  <br/>
had died a couple of years before that.  I had known the whole family  <br/>
well for six years.  It was a noble (and young and maybe foolish)  <br/>
thing.  There were joys and problems.  There were more joys than  <br/>
problems, and I wish things had gone differently.  I wish I had known  <br/>
more.<br/>

If the relationship is sunk, unschooling probably is too.  In a case  <br/>

it never floated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1696819863">I see the parents as a couple when they decided to have children together. That&#39;s the commitment that I figure counts first. If one wants to unschool and the other doesn&#39;t than the unschooling ready parent needs to relax and not make a big issue out of it. You can be a supportive and loving and nurturing parent without being an unschooler. You can home-educate without being an unschooler. Your kids can be in school and still have an engaged and supportive family life. Losing a two parent home to divorce over the desire to unschool, that&#39;s totally cutting off their nose to spite your face. <br/>

<br/>
It just means that the burden of proof is on the person who wants to<br/>
unschool the children.  To make it look good, work well, go as smoothly as<br/>
possible and so on.<br/>
<br/>
This is not and very likely won&#39;t be the other parent&#39;s responsibility at<br/>
all.  Not because of stubbornness (which may or may not be the case even<br/>
though it seems like it *is* the case) but because if a parent can&#39;t see<br/>
unschooling as truly viable, then they can&#39;t and they very likely don&#39;t see<br/>
the point of reading about something that seems silly.  It&#39;s just like with<br/>
5 year old Karl, and putting some idea in front of him that he has no<br/>
interest in.  At some point, hopefully early on, I realize that I could just<br/>
drop it.<br/>
<br/>
Since I feel in my bones that unschooling principles matter, I live by them<br/>
and interact with others in the family using those principles.  I think them<br/>
in my head a lot.  I don&#39;t talk about unschooling to sound off like I used<br/>
to (thinking it would clear up matters if I did).... well, I don&#39;t sound off<br/>
at home.  Any sounding off I do is online, but in real life it just sounds<br/>
fanatical and crazy to others.  It worries people and makes it seem like my<br/>
focus is off center and not on point  --on my child, my partner, my family.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I can talk about the principles way before I can get away with saying<br/>
&quot;unschooling&quot; this and &quot;unschooling&quot; that.  And I talk about my principles.<br/>
Somewhat.  Not a lot.<br/>
<br/>
The most important thing is not talk but putting the principles into<br/>
action.  First and foremost with one&#39;s partner in parenting.  Give your<br/>
co-parent the same leeway to learn at their individual pace and to enjoy<br/>
doing whatever it is they love to do.  Share with them stuff you come into<br/>
contact with that might build on what they already love.  And it goes on<br/>
from there.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Would you go against what you now believe to be true about learning to<br/>
 </span></blockquote>save the relationship?<br/>
The yacht or ship, seems sunk...:( &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t have to go that far.  We have been down the road through divorce<br/>
(not because of unschooling but for other reasons ... unschooling was used<br/>
in court me to make me look like a foolish irresponsible parent) and somehow<br/>
we miraculously managed to get back together.  And this time around we&#39;re<br/>
doing pretty well, and we see the point --not of unschooling so much as-- of<br/>
viewing each member of the family as vitally important.  We&#39;re much more<br/>
interested in success this time than in getting our points across.<br/>
<br/>
It seems simple that a family is a unit of individuals.  When it doesn&#39;t<br/>
function with that in mind, it tends to break down and cease functioning.<br/>
It doesn&#39;t always end in divorce.  Sometimes families just devolve into<br/>
being disfunctional.  (yuck)<br/>

<br/>
I see the parents as a couple when they decided to have children together. That&#39;s the commitment that I figure counts first. If one wants to unschool and the other doesn&#39;t than the unschooling ready parent needs to relax and not make a big issue out of it. You can be a supportive and loving and nurturing parent without being an unschooler. You can home-educate without being an unschooler. Your kids can be in school and still have an engaged and supportive family life. Losing a two parent home to divorce over the desire to unschool, that&#39;s totally cutting off their nose to spite your face. <br/>

But, where do you see the above parents as a couple if one of them strongly disagrees about unschooling?<br/>

anonymously:<br/>
<br/>
***************<br/>
Dear Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;If one parent in a couple doesn&#39;t have persuasive evidence, that&#39;s the<br/>
fault of the other parent. If one parent doesn&#39;t have faith in the<br/>
other parent, there are relationship problems to begin with.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could give me some suggestions about HOW to give someone  <br/>
persuasive evidence....please?<br/>
Wondering if people have ever run up against parents and spouses who  <br/>
don&#39;t WANT to listen or look for success because they believe that the  <br/>
only way to succeed is to stay in school.<br/>
<br/>
There are great ideas on your website on many topics and I have tried  <br/>
to use them...thank you for making them available.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
-=Wondering if people have ever run up against parents and spouses who  <br/>
don&#39;t WANT to listen or look for success because they believe that the  <br/>
only way to succeed is to stay in school.-=-<br/>
<br/>
All the time, yes.  Surely.  Most of us WERE people who believed that  <br/>
school was important, crucial, central to real life.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the suggestion of not talking about unschooling but talking  <br/>
about the principles and ideas behind unschooling.  Being kind to help  <br/>
children learn how to be kind, and making life rich and interesting  <br/>
and peaceful so they can learn easily.   One could cite Abraham Maslow  <br/>
about that without even knowing or caring about unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone has time and mood to google Maslow and could bring some  <br/>
links here or send them to me, that would be great.  The one I had  <br/>
saved as a favorite isn&#39;t there anymore.  I guess I need a Maslow&#39;s  <br/>
Hierarchy of Needs page (links at least).<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe you could give me some suggestions about HOW to give someone  <br/>

<br/>
Well this is a great question, and has to do with the way individuals  <br/>
communicate.  I hope others will have good ideas, and I&#39;ll try to  <br/>
collect them up and save them.   Something to consider, though, is to  <br/>
identify the ways in which one is NOT being persuasive, or is being  <br/>
irritating, and then not do those things.<br/>
<br/>
Going to conferences has been what made the difference for some dads-- <br/>
seeing older unschooled kids.  Being around other kids always helps,  <br/>
so dads who coach or go to homeschooling get-togethers, or somehow are  <br/>
out seeing homeschoolers and school kids side by side are persuaded by  <br/>
what they see sooner than dads who never see children in the course of  <br/>
their lives except their own children.  Sometimes that causes a  <br/>
situation where they&#39;re comparing their kids to an ideal imagined  <br/>
child, or to the best-of moments co-workers talk about.  Christmas  <br/>
letters often talk about summer internships or camps, and science  <br/>
awards and scholarships, but they rarely mention screaming fights,  <br/>
running away, drug use or being picked up by the police.   I got one  <br/>
Christmas letter once that talked about an accidental pregnancy (a boy  <br/>
had knocked up a girlfriend, and the parents admitted it in a  <br/>
Christmas letter).<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to persuade in a vacuum.  Your words can&#39;t be the only  <br/>
evidence.<br/>
Don&#39;t try to persuade in a marathon.   Chose one thing to say and then  <br/>
live life a while without saying any more.  if it&#39;s true, your child  <br/>
will show some of it and you can point at that, instead of just words  <br/>
and &quot;what-if.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
At first it&#39;s saying &quot;Other people&#39;s kids have...&quot; but it can become  <br/>
&quot;Our children are...&quot;<br/>
Not if you screw it up, it can&#39;t.  But if you go carefully, maybe it  <br/>
can.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wants to re-interpret the questions above should, so that  <br/>
the author doesn&#39;t have to out herself by clarifying.  We can address  <br/>
everything it seems she might have meant. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
Wikipedia has a good page of course:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow&#39;s_hierarchy_of_needs</a><br/>
(same chart too) I looked at several other links but like the wiki one best.<br/>
You can google those words (see subject) and get a ton of links!<br/>
 <br/>
I forget what this means, but I have a hard time meeting my own personal<br/>
basic needs (Physiological). I forget to eat and drink. Hours after I should<br/>
have eaten, I will be shaky and short tempered and wanting to eat NOW so<br/>
when I&#39;m busy, I&#39;ll just grab whatever is quick (not always the best choice)<br/>
and go back to work. I don&#39;t have time to fix a meal and wait for it to be<br/>
done! Nor do I have the energy or patience to stand there and do it. It is a<br/>
rare occasion that I have dinner ready for my husband when he gets home from<br/>
work. He often brings take-out food or lately we&#39;ve been cooking together<br/>
because he&#39;s been coming home earlier. I am amazed that I&#39;ve been able to<br/>
feed my son, but he is a high priority for me. Often I will feed him and not<br/>
eat myself. I also keep lots of snacks on low shelves in the cabinets and he<br/>
helps himself when he gets hungry. A few times a week I&#39;ll make a Monkey<br/>
Platter and we&#39;ll both munch on that while we watch a movie or play games.<br/>
Snacking does me good, especially when I have good things to choose from. I<br/>
just need to remember to do it (and shop ahead for it!).<br/>
 <br/>
I go through phases of not sleeping much or having disturbed sleep. During a<br/>
big project or something, I can get by on 3 hrs of sleep but only for a<br/>
week, then I need to hybernate like a bear. I get headaches from not<br/>
drinking enough or breathing well. (I know this because I can sometimes help<br/>
them go away by breathing deeply, completely filling the lungs over and over<br/>
for a minute or two so more oxygen gets to the brain, or by drinking more<br/>
water.) I am more concerned with creativity, spontaneity,<br/>
self-actualization, working on ways to achieve those things more. Right now<br/>
doing a lot of reading about unschooling and trying to incorporate the<br/>
basics into my whole life and live by example. I&#39;m in a mental phase.<br/>
Anyway, I also tend to forget to pay bills. Quite often. We&#39;ve had several<br/>
2nd and final notices before I get around to paying. We have the money, I<br/>
just don&#39;t do it. Recently I admitted this to my cousin and she does the<br/>
SAME thing! What does this mean about us?!<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
If you want a little more on Maslow, this page has something nice at the<br/>
bottom:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/ma">http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/ma</a><br/>
slow.htm<br/>
 <br/>
Interesting quote from above link: Maslow believes that the only reason that<br/>
people would not move well in direction of self-actualization is because of<br/>
hindrances placed in their way by society. He states that education is one<br/>
of these hindrances. <br/>
 <br/>
Then they list 10 points educators can address, which seem kind of like the<br/>
tennants of unschooling, but are also quite relavent to everyone! I&#39;ll just<br/>
copy them here for those who don&#39;t get around to clicking on the link.<br/>
<br/>
1.	We should teach people to be authentic, to be aware of their inner<br/>
selves and to hear their inner-feeling voices. <br/>
<br/>
2.	We should teach people to transcend their cultural conditioning and<br/>
become world citizens. <br/>
<br/>
3.	We should help people discover their vocation in life, their<br/>
calling, fate or destiny. This is especially focused on finding the right<br/>
career and the right mate. <br/>
<br/>
4.	We should teach people that life is precious, that there is joy to<br/>
be experienced in life, and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous<br/>
in all kinds of situations, it makes life worth living. <br/>
<br/>
5.	We must accept the person as he or she is and help the person learn<br/>
their inner nature. From real knowledge of aptitudes and limitations we can<br/>
know what to build upon, what potentials are really there. <br/>
<br/>
6.	We must see that the person&#39;s basic needs are satisfied. This<br/>
includes safety, belongingness, and esteem needs. <br/>
<br/>
7.	We should refreshen consciousness, teaching the person to appreciate<br/>
beauty and the other good things in nature and in living. <br/>
<br/>
8.	We should teach people that controls are good, and complete abandon<br/>
is bad. It takes control to improve the quality of life in all areas. <br/>
<br/>
9.	We should teach people to transcend the trifling problems and<br/>
grapple with the serious problems in life. These include the problems of<br/>
injustice, of pain, suffering, and death. <br/>
<br/>
10.	We must teach people to be good choosers. They must be given<br/>
practice in making good choices. <br/>

<br/>
especially:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Maslow states that educators should respond to the potential an individual<br/>
&gt; has for growing into a self-actualizing person of his/her own kind. Ten<br/>
&gt; points that educators should address are listed:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    1. We should teach people to be *authentic,* to be aware of their inner<br/>
&gt;    selves and to hear their inner-feeling voices.<br/>
&gt;    2. We should teach people to *transcend their cultural conditioning *and become world citizens.<br/>
&gt;    3. We should help people *discover their vocation in life,* their<br/>
&gt;    calling, fate or destiny. This is especially focused on finding the right<br/>
&gt;    career and the right mate.<br/>
&gt;    4. We should teach people that *life is precious,* that there is joy to<br/>
&gt;    be experienced in life, and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous<br/>
&gt;    in all kinds of situations, it makes life worth living.<br/>
&gt;    5. We must *accept the person* as he or she is and help the person<br/>
&gt;    learn their inner nature. From real knowledge of aptitudes and limitations<br/>
&gt;    we can know what to build upon, what potentials are really there.<br/>
&gt;    6. We must see that the person&#39;s *basic needs are satisfied.* This<br/>
&gt;    includes safety, belongingness, and esteem needs.<br/>
&gt;    7. We should *refreshen consciousness,* teaching the person to<br/>
&gt;    appreciate beauty and the other good things in nature and in living.<br/>
&gt;    8. We should teach people that *controls are good,* and complete<br/>
&gt;    abandon is bad. It takes control to improve the quality of life in all<br/>
&gt;    areas.<br/>
&gt;    9. We should teach people to transcend the trifling problems and *grapple<br/>
&gt;    with the serious problems in life.* These include the problems of<br/>
&gt;    injustice, of pain, suffering, and death.<br/>
&gt;    10. We must teach people to be *good choosers.* They must be given<br/>
&gt;    practice in making good choices.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>As an unschooler, I&#39;d revise it to say:<br/>
1. We allow people to be *authentic*, encourage an awareness of inner self<br/>
and an ear for their inner-feeling voices.<br/>
2. We model *transencion of cultural conditioning* and live as a world<br/>
citizen.<br/>
3. We support people on their very own *journey of discovery that leads to<br/>
their vocation, calling, fate, destiny, future*. This is especially focused<br/>
on finding a joyous path through life as a whole; including in vocation and<br/>
in relationships.<br/>
4. We live as though *life is precious, that there is joy to be experienced<br/>
in life,* and if people are open to seeing the good and joyous in all kinds<br/>
of situations, life is worth living joyfully in the present.<br/>
5. *We accept the person s/he is and work to understand the person&#39;s inner<br/>
nature. From real knowlege of *who someone is* comes the understanding of<br/>
what to build upon and what potential is really there.*<br/>
6. We see that a person&#39;s *basic needs are satisfied*. This includes safety,<br/>
a sense of belonging, and esteem needs.<br/>
7. We *live consciously*, modeling an appreciation for beauty and good<br/>
things in life, near and far.<br/>
8. We understand that arbitrary controls are not a one-size-fits-all<br/>
solution to conflict in life. Principles are important and far more<br/>
applicable to real life situations.  From a life led by principles, one<br/>
understands intrinsic limitations and can easily follow them.<br/>
9. We model goals to transcend trifling daily problems; we grapple with the<br/>
serious problems in life as they naturally occur in our world. Injustice,<br/>
pain, suffering and death are discussed, examined and dealt with in an open,<br/>
honest environment with information at the appropriate level for the less<br/>
experienced people in the equation.<br/>
10. We understand that making good choices is a result of the practice of<br/>
making choices.  We allow people to make choices with available information,<br/>
support and freedom, without our judgment.<br/>
<br/>
a few are still sticky, like 8 & 10. That was pretty fun!<br/>

NEED to use persuasive evidence?<br/>
<br/>
Sure, there are times when spouses need to agree to disagree, but it<br/>
seems that most things should and can be discussed.  If one spouse<br/>
disagrees with something and has not given any thought to why, or why<br/>
their spouse disagrees, or refuses to think about something the other<br/>
partner feels strongly about, that alone should be something to discuss.<br/>
That, to me, would be disrespectful to the other partner.  I don&#39;t think<br/>
spouses can truly stay together in the absence of respect.<br/>

to an understanding about how to treat our kids and how to raise them. <br/>
That has largely been because of my embrace of unschooling and peaceful<br/>
parenting and just doing that.  My husband was more one who was going to<br/>
leave that up to me and not really do anything proactive about it.  He&#39;s<br/>
a very involved parent now that he&#39;s embraced that too.  That&#39;s not to<br/>
say he wasn&#39;t involved before, just a different level and understanding.<br/>
<br/>
I really think most parents try to do what is best for their kids, so<br/>
coming at all parenting talks from that frame of reference will lead<br/>
more towards being peaceful than not.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t parent at all like my sister and her husband do.  They agree<br/>
with one another on how to parent and the kids can see that their<br/>
parents love each other and them.  Honestly, it would be more harmful<br/>
for one of them to completely change their thinking about parenting and<br/>
create a rift between them that caused a divorce, even though I think<br/>
all of them would be healthier and happier if they didn&#39;t punish their<br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps subtle shifts are better?  No need to be persuasive if things<br/>
are subtle and gentle?</div>

Verna/lalow wrote that.  It&#39;s really sweet.<br/>
<br/>
Ours was mostly that way, too.  Keith and Kirby didn&#39;t get along as  <br/>
well as Keith got along with the next two, so if Kirby had been an  <br/>
only child, things wouldn&#39;t have gone as well in the longrun.   But  <br/>
Keith knew I was doing a lot of reading and thinking and observing of  <br/>
other families, and he was able to see other families sometimes  <br/>
because if a playgroup and babysitting co-op.  He saw only maybe five  <br/>
percent of what I saw, but he saw it with intro before and commentary  <br/>
after.   That was persuasive, I suppose.<br/>
<br/>
Some couples are missing the trust and faith, for various reasons.  My  <br/>
kids have all been in relationships.  2/3 of them are in serious  <br/>
relationships at the moment, and I&#39;m always aware that these people  <br/>
could be the future parents of my grandchildren.  One is Holly&#39;s  <br/>
boyfriend (and one of Kirby&#39;s best friends) Brett, whom some people  <br/>
met or saw in Arizona last week.  One is Marty&#39;s girlfriend Ashlee,  <br/>
who was here this afternoon.  She&#39;s very bright and energetic.  She  <br/>
smokes, or else she might be perfect.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway...  when I talk to my kids about their sweeties, I try to  <br/>
say the kinds of things that will help them five or ten years from  <br/>
now, on the assumption that this relationship could be long lasting.<br/>
<br/>
I have a question on the side which I&#39;ve declined to discuss  <br/>
privately, but I did agree to bring it here.   Advice would be  <br/>
welcome.  I don&#39;t want to identify any who or where, and I don&#39;t know  <br/>
the author in person anyway.<br/>
<br/>
It will be posted separately, but I think it&#39;s directly about trust  <br/>
and faith, and the dangers of risking secrecy.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-564315584">-=Wondering if people have ever run up against parents and spouses who<br/>
don&#39;t WANT to listen or look for success because they believe that the<br/>
only way to succeed is to stay in school.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When people shut down and don&#39;t want to listen, go back to unschooling<br/>
principles.  In my opinion, they&#39;re based on how human nature works.  It&#39;s<br/>
easy to get away from them after a while and assume that I know them better<br/>
than I actually do.  And I like Pam&#39;s wonderful write up on &quot;What Do<br/>
Unschoolers Do&quot; for keeping on track since doing is where I tend to fall<br/>
behind.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Maybe you could give me some suggestions about HOW to give someone<br/>
persuasive evidence....please?-=-<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Well this is a great question, and has to do with the way individuals<br/>
 </span></blockquote>communicate.  I hope others will have good ideas, and I&#39;ll try to<br/>
collect them up and save them.   Something to consider, though, is to<br/>
identify the ways in which one is NOT being persuasive, or is being<br/>
irritating, and then not do those things. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Persuasion is meant to operate on information that one&#39;s audience is<br/>
somewhat interested in.  A mistake that&#39;s easy to make is to see one&#39;s own<br/>
points as more important than what the audience would want to know.  But<br/>
both are important.<br/>
<br/>
It might help some to consider persuasion from a traditional approach of<br/>
rhetoric.  Enough to understand how people argue points and what&#39;s effective<br/>
or not effective about different kinds of presentation.<br/>
<br/>
For instance.  Some people are not easily swayed by emotional appeal.<br/>
Others don&#39;t trust anything else.  Some people would rather get a logical<br/>
chain of evidence.  Some people would rather eschew both of those approaches<br/>
in favor of a presentation based on tradition.  I think Tolkien is an<br/>
excellent example of the traditional approach with all those hobbits, their<br/>
food, their ale, their gardens, their communal life and so forth.  Other<br/>
ideas of tradition are linked with favored icons, religious, political,<br/>
commercial and otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
A little disclaimer: I think most people prefer a blend of different<br/>
presentations.  Which is why a little humor (or a lot, depending on one&#39;s<br/>
audience) lightens the weightier stuff.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good to know that a person who loves comfort and is somewhat<br/>
traditional may find logical or emotional appeals off putting or unnecessary<br/>
or silly or whatever.  It&#39;s not a good strategy to continually present logic<br/>
to someone who prefers a different type of information.<br/>
<br/>
The information might be vital no matter how it&#39;s presented yet that same<br/>
information makes a bigger impact after observing and studying how best to<br/>
make one&#39;s case.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, being the only parent who supports unschooling can sometimes be a<br/>
bit like studying for the bar or getting into political science.  Or it can<br/>
be thought of as simply noting what the people in your life who don&#39;t<br/>
support unschooling prefer and giving more in that vein so as to keep the<br/>
credit flowing and continue unschooling long enough for your family and your<br/>
children to prove it without having to say so much about it.  Like Verna<br/>
says in a previous post in this thread.  :)  Sometimes quietly going about<br/>
the business of unschooling is by far the best appeal one can make.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1439082779">I usually don&#39;t take the time to click a lot of links.  Glad you posted this<br/>
stuff, Kim!  There&#39;s a lot of biological information that provides much<br/>
thought for doing a better in unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I clicked the first link which represents the first need in Maslow&#39;s<br/>
Hierarchy.  Homeostasis.  Which provides only one sentence about sleep and<br/>
it&#39;s very good:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sleep timing depends upon a balance between homeostatic sleep<br/>
 </span></blockquote>propensity, the need for sleep as a function of the amount of time elapsed<br/>
since the last adequate sleep episode, and circadian rhythms which determine<br/>
the ideal timing of a correctly structured and restorative sleep episode.<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
So sleep has less (though not nothing) to do with external rules one could<br/>
apply than with all that goes on internally to regulate sleep patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Oh and I just love the following in light of unschooling principles:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Main article: risk homeostasis&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_homeostasis">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_homeostasis</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>An actuary &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actuary</a>&gt; may refer to *risk<br/>
homeostasis*, where (for example) people that have anti-lock brakes have no<br/>
better safety record than those without anti-lock brakes, because the former<br/>
unconsciously compensate for the safer vehicle via less-safe driving habits.<br/>
Previous to the innovation of anti-lock brakes, certain maneuvers involved<br/>
minor skids, evoking fear and avoidance: now the anti-lock system moves the<br/>
boundary for such feedback, and behavior patterns expand into the no-longer<br/>
punitive area. It has also been suggested that ecological crises are an<br/>
instance of risk homeostasis in which behavior known to be dangerous<br/>
continues until dramatic consequences actually occur. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
That says a lot about human nature, which in my opinion is what unschooling<br/>
is based on in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Radical unschooling can be like driving without anti-lock brakes.<br/>
<br/>
People (children and adults) do things that on the surface look dangerous,<br/>
things that could actually result in catastrophe.  This behavior has nothing<br/>
to do with unschooling or not unschooling.  It&#39;s how humans naturally are.<br/>
<br/>
Does this mean that allowing children to make some decisions and take some<br/>
risks is more dangerous than protecting our children from any and all<br/>
exposure to risk?  Using the example above of relying on ABS (anti-lock<br/>
brakes) or driving without them, I don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
People who haven&#39;t very often experienced the results of their own mistakes<br/>
(or learning takes as Kelly Lovejoy calls them), who have led more sheltered<br/>
lives, might sometimes be more likely (or frequently as the case may be) to<br/>
ignore any safety precautions they&#39;ve been told all their lives once they<br/>
get out on their own.  Perhaps for years.  Because maybe they feel pretty<br/>
secure with their &quot;ABS.&quot;  That goes for driving, eating, interacting within<br/>
all types of relationships (with partners, children, friends, etc), and any<br/>
other risk behavior.  Living is itself a risk behavior...  of which the<br/>
consequence is ultimately death.  (Yes, I know there are actually people who<br/>
argue against that assumption but that still doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s no such<br/>
thing as risk.)<br/>
<br/>
On the importance of living and learning at an early age.  When consequences<br/>
occur within the (hopefully) more protective environment of one&#39;s parent&#39;s<br/>
home along with the ameliorating effect of parent&#39;s support and help to<br/>
avoid serious danger.  As opposed to withholding opportunities from children<br/>
to experience making decisions themselves, including the chance to work with<br/>
choices enough to perceive a wider range of options available for making<br/>
those decisions with.<br/>
<br/>
When a child has some realistic experience with taking risk, I think they&#39;re<br/>
more likely to consider safety precautions whether driving, interacting with<br/>
others, and so on, and they&#39;re less likely to want to experience greater<br/>
risk taking during adulthood to arrive at the point of considering more<br/>
caution where it&#39;s needed.<br/>

Kirby, my oldest, is 22.  He spoke at the HENA conference in Arizona  <br/>
on March 7.  He said three things that surprised me.   One was that he  <br/>
explained that when he was young his parents (me, one of them, and I  <br/>
was sitting there) hadn&#39;t told him no much, but had helped him see the  <br/>
possible outcomes of various decisions, and then supported what he  <br/>
decided.  So he was saying we had helped him figure out how to make  <br/>
decisions, early on.    And now that he&#39;s grown, I&#39;ve seen him make  <br/>
some really good ones.   He&#39;s just moved into a house with his  <br/>
apartment-mate and another friend, and a fourth is moving in next  <br/>
month, I think.  They did a great job, it seemed, of deciding whether,  <br/>
how and when to move, and pulling it off in an efficient way (in the  <br/>
two days before he left for the conference in Arizona).<br/>
<br/>
The other two surprising things, for the record, were he totally  <br/>
bragged up his brother Marty (who wasn&#39;t there), and he credited  <br/>
Pokemon for the trajectory that led him to the job he&#39;s in now.  I  <br/>
hadn&#39;t thought of it that way, but when he told it, the whole picture  <br/>
came flooding back, of why he started hanging out at Active  <br/>
Imagination in the first place (the gaming shop in which he worked  <br/>
from 14 to 19).<br/>

He missed three days of work to do that, too, and he LIKES his job.   <br/>
His days off had been Wednesday and Thursday, and they spent those  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Does anyone have a link to this? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well turns out it&#39;s a post written by Pam Sorooshian in a recent thread by<br/>
that name.  I think it could use a page all its own if it doesn&#39;t have one.<br/>
My copy is on my fridge held by a magnet.  Here are the contents:<br/>
<br/>
  1. Show respect for all of a child&#39;s interests equally.<br/>
  2. Keep the child in mind as I go through life, so that I notice<br/>
     things that might be of interest to that child.<br/>
  3. Find ways to include the child in my own daily life - live a<br/>
     more&quot;open-book&#39; life than the norm.<br/>
  4. Follow up on things the child is interested in - and do this in a<br/>
     wide variety of ways, not only by &quot;getting him a book on it.&quot;<br/>
  5. Live a family life that is rich with experiences of a variety of<br/>
     kinds both at *home* and outside the *home*.<br/>
  6. Have resources around the *home* that are interesting and<br/>
     stimulating - things that will encourage exploration of ideas.<br/>
  7. Discuss things - spend time in conversation. This is probably<br/>
     overall the most important parental&quot;action&#39; involved in *unschooling*.<br/>
  8. Have a&quot;playful&#39; attitude - play together, have fun, appreciate the<br/>
     amazing world around you. Don&#39;t be cynical, be able to be amazed<br/>
     and find the world a fascinating place. THIS is the most<br/>
     important&quot;attitude&#39; for an *unschooling* parent.<br/>
  9. Be self-aware of your own thinking and behavior. Purposely stretch<br/>
     your imagination - question your own assumptions, check your own<br/>
     automatic impulses.<br/>
 10. Be very observant of what your child is really doing - don&#39;t view<br/>
     him/her in a shallow superficial way. Recognize that there is a<br/>
     reason for a child&#39;s actions, that a child is&quot;born to learn&#39; and<br/>
     is always learning. Get to know your child&#39;s own special favored<br/>
     ways of learning<br/>
 11. Wholeheartedly support a child&#39;s passions EVEN if, to you, they<br/>
     don&#39;t look like &quot;education.<br/>
<br/>
