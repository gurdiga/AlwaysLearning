I agree.  But I interpreted the original poster as &quot;telling the child to<br/>
stuff it because he was disturbing others&quot; as the only reason he should stop<br/>
the tantrum.  I have heard parents in stores/playgrounds/museums etc.<br/>
telling their kids that they had better stop climbing/standing on the<br/>
table/behaving poorly because &quot;that lady&quot; (pointing to an employee) will get<br/>
mad.  No other explanations as to why their behavior was unacceptable for<br/>
that place, time, etc.  No &quot;please sit down, you may fall&quot; or &quot;please keep<br/>
your hands out of the aquarium.  The sign says you may accidentally hurt the<br/>
fish (or the fish bite, or whatever)&quot;.<br/>

 &quot;Because you are disturbing others.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Gosh - I honestly think &quot;because you&#39;re disturbing others&quot; often is the real <br/>
reason that  they should stop and it often is a good reason (not always, but <br/>
often) and that, as kids get older, parents owe it to them to help them see <br/>
how their behavior is impinging on others. To not help them out that way - to <br/>
not help them become aware of how their behavior is discourteous or downright <br/>
disruptive to what other people are trying to do that seems unfair to the <br/>
kids. They&#39;ll miss out on stuff later, when people don&#39;t want to invite them <br/>
over, for example.<br/>
