Found this in an article under &quot;24/7&quot; -- I think it has some good <br/>
ideas.<br/>
<br/>
What is a Strong-Willed Child? Kendra Smiley defines strong-willed <br/>
children as<br/>
those who know how they want the world to be run and have no <br/>
tolerance for<br/>
anyone who disagrees with their viewpoint. The strong-willed child is <br/>
very<br/>
persistent and is willing to take punishment in order to win on any <br/>
given issue.<br/>
Because they are gifted in manipulation, strong-willed children are <br/>
not always<br/>
overtly defiant. They can be quite subtle, and even charming, in <br/>
their attempts<br/>
to control. They are willing to and capable of causing emotional <br/>
upset in order<br/>
to gain the upper hand. Strong-willed children don&#39;t necessarily want <br/>
to control<br/>
everyone around them. They just don&#39;t want to be controlled by anyone <br/>
else.<br/>
Discipline: Calm is Better! Discipline is a key issue when it comes <br/>
to molding a<br/>
strong-willed child. Smiley advises setting clear expectations and <br/>
consequences.<br/>
When expectations are violated, be sure to be consistent in <br/>
discipline.<br/>
According to Smiley, parents who cancel punishments midstream are<br/>
&quot;short-sighted.&quot; Further, when disciplining strong-willed kids, <br/>
control your<br/>
emotions. Don&#39;t discipline in anger. Kendra says, &quot;An out-of-control <br/>
adult is<br/>
not effective and is usually counterproductive. When we (as parents) <br/>
go out of<br/>
control, the strong-willed child wins the battle.&quot; In fact, Kendra&#39;s <br/>
son, Aaron,<br/>
a strong-willed child when growing up, claims that discipline worked <br/>
best when<br/>
it was unemotional. Anger in discipline was a sure sign to him that <br/>
he needed to<br/>
dig in his own heels. Our goal is to raise our kids to become <br/>
responsible<br/>
adults. It&#39;s hard. Parents need to take time to focus, to remind <br/>
themselves that<br/>
they are, in fact, the parents. It&#39;s not your calling to be your <br/>
child&#39;s<br/>
&quot;friend.&quot; It&#39;s your high calling and privilege to be your child&#39;s <br/>
parent. With a<br/>
strong-willed child, choosing battles wisely is important - but so is <br/>
the<br/>
corollary: Be sure to win battles you&#39;ve chosen to fight. Smiley <br/>
believes that<br/>
moms and dads need to provide a unified front when it comes to <br/>
parenting<br/>
strong-willed kids. Some conflict and disagreement when it comes to <br/>
parenting is<br/>
normal between parents, but Smiley advises that moms and dads not <br/>
disagree on<br/>
parenting issues in front of the strong-willed child. The strong-<br/>
willed child is<br/>
very attentive to differences in how Mom and Dad handle parenting <br/>
issues. As a<br/>
result, parents who don&#39;t &quot;sing from the same sheet of music&quot; can open<br/>
themselves up to instances where their child will play one parent off <br/>
the other<br/>
in his or her efforts to gain control.</div>
