well as using Conner&#39;s Scales.  Usually a detailed history and exam, some <br/>
laboratory, vision and hearing screens as well as evaluation by the school <br/>
psychologist looking for learning disorders.  He said only about 50% of his <br/>
patients with the diagnosis are on Ritalin some are on other medications and <br/>
some are not on any medications.<br/>
