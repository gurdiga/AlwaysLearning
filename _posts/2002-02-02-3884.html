asked.  His mom will say  &quot;oh my faucet is leaking again&quot;  and he&#39;ll go<br/>
see her, come home, and not have fixed the faucet.   I now translate. <br/>
David, your mom needs  her faucet repaired, can you do it?&quot;  No problem.<br/>
Some  thing happens to him at home though.  If I ask him to take the<br/>
garbage out ( I always take it out, but *if* )  he would get out the door<br/>
and notice the door nob is loose.  He would put the garbage bag down by<br/>
the door and go to the garage to get a screwdriver.  In the garage he<br/>
would find the light bulb out,  he would (walk past the garbage by the<br/>
back door ) come into the house to get a light bulb.  In the house he<br/>
would notice his cup of coffee and newspaper and sit right down and read<br/>
a spell, having left the garage door open, the dog will now be chewing on<br/>
his coveralls.  When the dog is bored she will find the garbage by the<br/>
back door.  David will hear the dog and find the garbage bag, now empty, <br/>
and come back in to get a new bag.  Under the sink he will see the car<br/>
wax and remember he meant to wash the car.....   Well, now you know why I<br/>
take the garbage out.  = )<br/>

Most of my day was like that!  Good thing:  I didn&#39;t burn the bread.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve gotten a ton done today, but also have left a trail of The Undone.<br/>
<br/>
And Holly and I were having a LOVELY time, I was sewing, we were watching Top <br/>
Hat and SINGING, and she was playing with Marble Works, and rearranging her <br/>
stuff, and Keith came in with his swim bag and said &quot;Holly, are you ready?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Because on Fridays they swim with the homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
And Holly and I looked at him, and at each other, and at the clock, and I <br/>
said &quot;It&#39;s only 2:30!&quot;  He said &quot;It&#39;s nearly 4:30.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh!  The battery died in our wall clock.  That batter lasted four years, and <br/>
died today, while we were having a GREAT time. &lt;g&gt;  We had no idea so much <br/>
time had passed.  So she went merrily to swim.<br/>

This is why I respect you.  You speak with such respect and real joy<br/>
about your kids.  Even if you were kicking my ass, ( and you probably<br/>
will&lt;g&gt;)  and I was madder than mad,  and couldn&#39;t remember all the other<br/>
things I respect about you as an experienced  unschooling parent,  I<br/>
would remember the way you talk about your kids.  <br/>

<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
I wish everyone who&#39;s wondering whether unschooling could work could meet my <br/>
kids and just hang out with them for a few hours.  That used to be the local <br/>
advice I gave here, when there was an unschooling meeting regularly--COME and <br/>
meet the older kids and you&#39;ll be sold.  They&#39;re just so different, so <br/>
poised, so real to talk to.  <br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s interesting the other people they draw, too.  They&#39;re good <br/>
influences on more structured homeschoolers, when the parents get to know <br/>
mine (and some others I&#39;m thinking of in New Mexico) better.  Their fears and <br/>
expectations thaw out some.  And the couple of school kids who hang out here <br/>
a lot soften up after the first hour or so.  It&#39;s sweet to see.  <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday there were four teen boys here, and Holly, playing video games in <br/>
Kirby&#39;s room.  They were letting Holly have turns (she&#39;s ten) and she was <br/>
VERY happy to have come in second on one game, and not lost all of them.  (It <br/>
was the crazy characters-teams smash brothers?? where you choose characters <br/>
from other Nintendo games to be, I think.)<br/>
<br/>
SO there was a lot of yelling from there, and once in a while I&#39;d hear <br/>
something I would have liked to have edited out &quot;You &#39;tard&quot; or &quot;Screw YOU!&quot; <br/>
and after a while it got physical between Marty and his (smaller but more <br/>
determined) friend Logan, and they were wrestling and pinning each other, so <br/>
I was alert to listen for anyone getting hurt or angry.  But through it all I <br/>
was thinking how much truly exuberant fun they were having.  There were no <br/>
victims.  They were all having honest, clean, safe (relatively, they were <br/>
wrestling on a bed and on carpet, in the presence of others with a mom two <br/>
rooms away) fun.  If anyone HAD started to have hurt feelings, Kirby would <br/>
have been the first to make things right.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s something very cool about them:  They will tell neat stories about <br/>
each other.  They&#39;re no so needy of attention and validation that their <br/>
stories are usually about themselves.  It&#39;s common for Kirby to come home <br/>
when they&#39;ve been out and tell me smething really smooth Marty did, or <br/>
something nice someone said about Holly, and so forth throughout the group.  <br/>
And their friends, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Last night Kirby was at anime club.  His friends are starting to drive now, <br/>
and one (schooled kid, who loves school for band and an after-school <br/>
accelerated Japanese class, and because he&#39;s an only child and really enjoys <br/>
the other people) brought him and another homeschooler home and they&#39;re all <br/>
in Kirby&#39;s room asleep.  So he got back who-knows when (4:00 probably), but I <br/>
knew where he was (at Lobo Comics), who he was with (and had two cell phone <br/>
numbers) and wher he is right now.<br/>
<br/>
When other parents want ideas and reject all mine, it&#39;s a mystery.  They want <br/>
me to tell them how their kids can be as trustworthy as mine without them <br/>
trusting them.  And they want to know how their kids can be as direct as mine <br/>
without the parents allowing directness, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the compliment.<br/>
<br/>

their children. I think liking your children is the biggest requirement to <br/>
unschooling.  Should be a requirement for having them, I think.  And what <br/>
does it do to a kid who&#39;s told, &quot;Well, unschooling is fine for your siblings, <br/>
but not for you, because you&#39;re just not capable/ready/whatever.&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry...it&#39;s just been driving me crazy.<br/>
<br/>
It means a lot to me when I read these posts and can see how much you all <br/>
ENJOY your kids.<br/>

<br/>
If we ever have a magazine-style quiz, &quot;Is Unschooling Right for You?&quot;,<br/>
one of the first questions should be &quot;Do you enjoy your kids?&quot;.<br/>
Followed by &quot;Do you have a sense of awe when you see your children<br/>
developing?&quot;  And &quot;Do you find the learning abilities of the human mind<br/>
to be amazing?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I could unschool if I didn&#39;t think that my son already had<br/>
amazing mojo working inside his head.  (And I think every kid has it.)<br/>
