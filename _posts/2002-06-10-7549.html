Just be careful that Fish and Game doesn&#39;t get wind of  your new pet (unless <br/>
you have the necessary permits) they can get rather harsh about keeping <br/>
non-domestic animals.<br/>
<br/>
I knew an older couple that had a baby deer for a while, but they died <br/>
several years ago...not much help there! Sorry.<br/>
I bet you could find out at google, exactly what formula to use for the wee <br/>
thing.<br/>
Have fun with your new baby!<br/>
I&#39;m studying to take my falconry permit exam.....<br/>
No deer info. in my books! lol<br/>
