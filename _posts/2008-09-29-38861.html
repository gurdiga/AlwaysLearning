<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435057899">Hello all!  I&#39;m new here (also new to homeschooling - was <br/>
homeschooled myself but just brought my own kids home and am veering <br/>
toward unschooling).  I intend to simply read for a while to learn!  <br/>
But I do have a question tonight in my reading online and bouncing <br/>
from place to place....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been reading Sudbury School/Free School stuff and also ran <br/>
across info on the Hole in the Wall project (where a PC was placed in <br/>
a hole in a wall in a village in India and the village children <br/>
taught themselves within days to use it for a variety of purposes - <br/>
the experiment highlighted the ways that children glean knowledge <br/>
through peer interaction without needing adult intervention or <br/>
guidance)....<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s my question.  I am intrigued by unschooling and by the free <br/>
school model but see the reliance in the free school model on peers <br/>
and social capital.  I am wondering what folks here think of the <br/>
value of peer &quot;inspiration&quot; (I&#39;m not talking grade level peers - I&#39;m <br/>
talking groups of children inspiring learning in one another as they <br/>
share knowledge - kind of children &quot;strewing the way&quot; for each <br/>
other)....and whether this is lacking in your unschooling <br/>
experience.  Believe me, I am NOT asking the old socialization <br/>
question - think it&#39;s one of the dumbest possible questions out <br/>
there.  But I do see the magic that happens when kids inspire each <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
I have four kids, so I am amazed already at seeing their <br/>
relationships flourish and see how this kind of dynamic will happen <br/>
within our own family but wonder what level of credence people here <br/>
give to the ideas and how they see it happen for their own children...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
In some ways those schools create a culture separate from the child&#39;s  <br/>
homelife and work within that.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling uses the real life that already exists, and the real  <br/>
family.  Families have friends and neighbors and cousins, when  <br/>
they&#39;re lucky, and a young child&#39;s circle will continue to expand as  <br/>
he gets older, but it can happen naturally and gradually.<br/>
<br/>
Since they were little I liked the way having a visitor would change  <br/>
the dynamics and the use of the same old toys and swing set and art  <br/>
supplies.  A food the kids were used to having around would be  <br/>
recharged by the excitement of a visitor.  &quot;You have popsicles!?&quot; and  <br/>
the popsicles were more exciting, for a few moments.   A game that  <br/>
had gotten old was new again.  A treehouse got a new role in a new game.<br/>
<br/>
Is that the sort of inspiration you mean?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Holly&#39;s friend Jasmine came over.  Jasmine is a year older,  <br/>
and that&#39;s the family Holly stayed in England with and went to a  <br/>
wedding in France with.<br/>

<br/>
So Jasmine is in the dorms at the university in town, and hadn&#39;t hung  <br/>
out with Holly alone for a while.  They both drive.  They could have  <br/>
gone anywhere and done just about anything.  Jasmine had talked about  <br/>
maybe going to see Tropic Thunder, but Holly had already seen it  <br/>
twice.  They thought maybe of playing cards.  They ended up doing  <br/>
Shrinky Dinks for three hours, and Jasmine left with a little string  <br/>
of shrinky dinks fastened to her purse, and a big smile on her face.   <br/>
She said she was glad they had done Shrinky Dinks instead of a movie,  <br/>
because then they were able to talk.<br/>
