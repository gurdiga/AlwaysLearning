I  believe everyone has &quot;artistic&quot;<br/>
talent but it&#39;s certainly not always in the  areas that<br/>
schools demand that you express it (drawing, paint and<br/>
clay  usually) but may be in woodworking, cooking,<br/>
quilting, singing,  photography, interior decorating,<br/>
asthetic gardening or landscape design,  etc. and so<br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is a lot like some thinking I was just doing about the word  &quot;chores.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
I was working on a page on English<br/>
_<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/english_">http://sandradodd.com/english_</a> (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/english)">http://sandradodd.com/english)</a> <br/>
and thinking that maybe when most people hear &quot;English&quot; in the context of  <br/>
homeschooling or schoolish anything they think writing, grammar, spelling, book  <br/>
reports, etc.   <br/>
 <br/>
One of the links on that page is to the page on the difference between  <br/>
teaching and learning and how really, deeply important it is for people who are  <br/>
thinking about teaching and learning to know the difference between them.   And <br/>
it&#39;s a vast difference.  They are not two sides of the same coin.   They&#39;re <br/>
not even made of the same metal.<br/>
 <br/>
And I was thinking that one of the problems with &quot;chores&quot; is that the word  <br/>
has the connotation of being something that&#39;s not fun, something that involves  <br/>
assigned drudgery.  When I say &quot;my kids don&#39;t have chores,&quot; some people  <br/>
hearing it probably fill in their own &quot;chore list,&quot; and so assume they never,  <br/>
ever pick up their laundry or make their beds or clean their rooms or put dishes  <br/>
in the sink, or whatever all.  That&#39;s not what it means.<br/>
 <br/>
And maybe so with art.  If people say &quot;Do you like art?&quot; or &quot;Are you  <br/>
artistic?&quot; the listener fills in whatever he thinks of &quot;art&quot; as being.  And  if it&#39;s <br/>
limited to what&#39;s taught in school (either studio or  appreciation/history), a <br/>
person (such as myself) who has never painted in oils,  can&#39;t draw a <br/>
recognizeable person, and isn&#39;t a sculptor could easily say &quot;no&quot; to  the latter, and <br/>
if the very question caused inner turmoil, &quot;no&quot; the the  former.<br/>
 <br/>
Bummer.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve seen people set tables and put the food on in really artistic  ways.  <br/>
(Very occasionally it was me, but not enough to &quot;count.&quot;)<br/>
 <br/>
Some people can arrange their houses, or flowers, or clothes in the closet,  <br/>
or magazines on a table, in really striking ways, never before done, without  <br/>
working really hard, sketching plans, or consulting books. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
There must&#39;ve been a car show here this weekend, because we saw several  <br/>
older (40&#39;s) cars, not exactly restored historically, but neither were they  <br/>
chopped up low-riders.  They were operational art, driving around on real  roads.<br/>
 <br/>
A friend of mine has medieval horse barding and braids her horse and  dresses <br/>
it up sometimes, and rides it in costume.  It&#39;s a little like  playing <br/>
Barbies, but way bigger. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve been messing with my garden, and moving plants and putting things in  <br/>
from seed, and pulling selected things out.  Many are more artistic than I  am, <br/>
but I&#39;m having fun anyway.<br/>
 <br/>
How about other everyday uses of aesthetically pleasing arrangements of  <br/>
things?  <br/>
What are the limits?  Does it need to be just visual?  What  is art to the <br/>
blind?  <br/>
 <br/>
How about those beds at furniture and bedding stores, all jacked up off the  <br/>
ground with twelve pillows and three coverlets and sheets that match dust  <br/>
ruffles?   Art.   <br/>
 <br/>
And about that English thing, while I&#39;m on it.  The word &quot;artificial&quot;  has to <br/>
do with art, and a few hundred years ago it was a huge compliment to say  <br/>
that something was &quot;artificial.&quot;  If someone could make a rose out of metal  or <br/>
plaster and have it look like a real rose, others were mightily impressed and  <br/>
praised its artificiality.<br/>
