<div id="ygrps-yiv-928278384">We spent much of this weekend at the Fairfax County Fair, and one of the<br/>
booths in the Sci-Tech center was a computerized SOL test.  For those<br/>
not in Va., SOL&#39;s are Standards of Learning tests.  They&#39;re a bunch of<br/>
garbage that the state has put into effect to see how well the schools<br/>
are doing their job.  Kids will have to pass them to graduate by the<br/>
time they finish implementing the program in a few years.  Teachers hate<br/>
them because they take all the creativity out of teaching and make it<br/>
formulaic in order to get the kids to pass the stupid test.  All four of<br/>
my kids sat down for the 10 question SOL mini-test.  I was curious how<br/>
they would do, since we&#39;ve been purely unschooling since they left<br/>
school a year and a half ago.  It was very high tech - you could see<br/>
after each question what your score was and where you stood in the group<br/>
on a big screen.  You took the test on little electronic machines.  My<br/>
oldest son (12) stayed in 2nd place out of 10 kids through most of the<br/>
questions and ended up 3rd in the end.  My older daughter and younger<br/>
son (10 & 9) finished up in 6th and 7th I think, and my youngest<br/>
daughter (7), was in last place.  I was very pleased that all but the<br/>
youngest, who would be too young for these tests anyway if she were a ps<br/>
student held their own, and my oldest did quite well.  And they&#39;ve kept<br/>
up without putting up with all that school garbage!<br/>
 <br/>
At the fair there was a really cute craft at the kids crafts booth.  You<br/>
take a hosiery knee-high, rye grass seed, sawdust, rubber bands, googly<br/>
eyes and a marker.  You pour a small cup (dixie cup) of rye seed into<br/>
the knee high, then a larger cup of sawdust.  Using a dixie cup with the<br/>
bottom cut out for a funnel with a wide bottom will make the pouring<br/>
easy.  Tie a knot in the knee-high, and cut the excess off.  Pinch a<br/>
bubble of the sawdust filled knee-high into a nose and secure with a<br/>
rubber band.  Glue on googly eyes and draw a mouth.  Soak the little guy<br/>
in water for a few minutes, then lay in a plate with a little water in<br/>
indirect light.  Water every day and watch the grass grow into hair.<br/>
Voila, a homemade chia pet!  My youngest accidentally did it upside down<br/>
at the fair, so hers will be bald with a beard!  LOL!<br/>
