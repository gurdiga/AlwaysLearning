<br/>
The general response to both might be not to struggle and not to see  <br/>
it as either you winning or her winning.  Find a way to be her partner  <br/>
and help her get what she needs and wants.<br/>
<br/>
More particularly:<br/>

<br/>
You could both hold onto a scarf or belt or two hands of a teddy bear.<br/>
You could let her walk and you walk behind her and not rush her.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I know unschooling focuses on not setting limits or saying you  <br/>

<br/>
This isn&#39;t a good summary of the focus of unschooling.  Unschooling  <br/>
focusses on learning, and on the relationship that will help learning  <br/>
happen easily.<br/>
<br/>
There are MANY real-world limits.  There don&#39;t need to be very many  <br/>
arbitrary limits added to those.  If someone stops saying &quot;have to&quot;  <br/>
but continues to think it, that&#39;s not really progress, it&#39;s just being  <br/>
sneaky. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
If you will rephrase these things before you post them, you might  <br/>
catch some of your own fallacies of thought.<br/>
You have decided that you will not allow your daughter to do anything  <br/>
except what you&#39;ve chosen:  Stroller, be carried or hold your hand.    <br/>
&quot;I feel...&quot; isn&#39;t about feelings so much as it seems to be trying to  <br/>
persuade us that you&#39;ve considered every angle.<br/>
<br/>
She could hold the hem of your coat, or hold onto your purse strap.<br/>
She could hold her older sister&#39;s hand.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t think the people here are pulling this advice out of  <br/>
their butts.  When I had a 2 year old daughter I also had a 5 year old  <br/>
boy and a 7 year old boy.  We survived through many parking lots and  <br/>
malls even though I only have two hands.<br/>

<br/>
Never go anywhere with a two year old without the means to clean her up.<br/>
If you were on the way to a wedding or a portrait studio, stopping at  <br/>
the store was a bad idea.<br/>
If you are NOT on the way to a wedding or portrait studio, why can&#39;t  <br/>
she have a mess on her clothes?  You have extra clothes in the car,  <br/>
right?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I have one who was most adamant about not holding hands when  he was not in a <br/>
mood to-right around 2 to 3 years old. We found alternatives.  Sometimes he <br/>
liked riding in the shopping cart, but not often-that&#39;s rather  confining. When <br/>
I could, I found (and still do, as he&#39;s still learning about  traffic safety) <br/>
parking spots next to the building or walkway directly to the  building, so <br/>
we don&#39;t have to cross the car-driving area. Sometimes, holding  onto brother&#39;s <br/>
hand or onto the cart or a bag handle will work. Sometimes,  if I don&#39;t have <br/>
to take the shopping cart to the car, we can hold hands and  &quot;race&quot; with each <br/>
other. Sometimes he likes to ride on the end of the cart-either  the far end <br/>
facing me or the near end between myself and the cart with our hands  together <br/>
on the handle. Sometimes, he&#39;s willing to hold his brother&#39;s hand.  Sometimes, <br/>
(like yesterday) he&#39;s agreeable that I hold onto the  back of his shirt or <br/>
jacket. Sometimes I can carry him. Some days, more often  when it first started, <br/>
but very rarely now, *nothing* seems to be okay. On these  occasions, I stop <br/>
and kneel next to him and we talk about safety and big cars  and soft bodies. <br/>
I think once or twice (in the beginning) we couldn&#39;t come to a  compromise and <br/>
he had no inkling about watching for cars and I ended up carrying  him <br/>
unwillingly to the car. Now that he&#39;s 4, it is easier for me to keep a watch  out <br/>
for cars *for* him in those &quot;nothing else will do&quot; situations, as his  movements <br/>
are much less erratic than when he was 2. I occasionally talk to him  *and* <br/>
his brother about how high the backs of cars are and how drivers can&#39;t see  <br/>
them when backing up, and to keep an eye out for that, too.<br/>
 <br/>
We talked about alternatives outside the moment-sometimes  while waiting in <br/>
the checkout line, sometimes while we were putting on our  coats, occasionally <br/>
when we were going into the store. It seemed to help if they  had a fresh <br/>
reminder of what was going to happen when we left the store to go to  the car. <br/>
Most all these ideas came from other unschooling parents on Yahoo  groups when <br/>
*I* was at my wit&#39;s end about him not holding hands in the parking  lot. :~) It <br/>
is *so* helpful, sometimes, to get some input from someone who&#39;s not  in the <br/>
middle of the stress.<br/>

<br/>
There are real limits on people though.  My youngest has been almost hit<br/>
by a car in a parking lot 2 times.  One time she was holding Chamille&#39;s<br/>
hand, her much older sister, and the other time she was walking very<br/>
near me.  The thing is, other drivers don&#39;t always look for or see<br/>
little kids, and sometimes people just plain drive too fast in parking<br/>
lots.  When Margaux was little we generally carried her out to the car<br/>
in the grocery cart, or piggie back rides or something else pleasant, to<br/>
avoid the whole issue altogether.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille was my wanderer.  When we went to public spaces, I had to be<br/>
super vigilant in watching her.  She always wanted to walk, no carrying<br/>
for her!  So, all of my attention went to keeping track of her, or we<br/>
avoided places where it was too difficult to do that.<br/>

<br/>
Keep clothing and wipes in your car, or most stores have bathrooms where<br/>
you could&#39;ve done a quick wash of hands and face, and honestly, little<br/>
kids could care less about how clean their clothing is.  I would&#39;ve let<br/>
her eat it, maybe stopped right there so she could eat standing still,<br/>
or sit her in the cart to eat it so she wouldn&#39;t have to walk and eat,<br/>
which lots of people find difficult!  Grocery stores usually will have<br/>
paper towels near the meat or produce too, so you can always swing by<br/>
that section to get some clean up gear.</div>

in attitude might be possible. Don&#39;t take her to the grocery store or <br/>
other places where there will be parking lot problems. If you avoid it <br/>
as often as possible, then you won&#39;t have many power struggles. Don&#39;t <br/>
make a flat rule that she can&#39;t walk on her own in ANY parking lot - <br/>
look around and decide if it really is dangerous. Only restrict her if <br/>
there is actual real danger. Ask her to walk right beside you. Play a <br/>
walking game as you go to the car - you take a step, she copies yours. <br/>
If you take 3, she takes 3. It keeps you close together.<br/>

the grocery store are not that big - she couldn&#39;t have made SUCH a big <br/>
mess, really. Couldn&#39;t you stand in one place while she made a little <br/>
mess and enjoyed her sample, then pulled out some tissue from your <br/>
purse, cleaned her and her surroundings up, and moved on - happily <br/>
enjoying her experience of the sample?<br/>
<br/>

exert power.<br/>

of young children around who might have had wipes in their purse? Did  <br/>
the store have a bathroom? A drinking fountain? Cashiers often have  <br/>
paper towels behind their counters because they use them to clean off  <br/>
the scanners, and for spills on conveyer belts. In my experience they  <br/>
will always give you one if you ask.<br/>
<br/>
I often pull other nearby adults into problem solving at moments like  <br/>
that. Sometimes directly: &quot;She really wants a piece of that...but I  <br/>
don&#39;t have any wipes with me. Do you happen to have any?&quot; and  <br/>
sometimes indirectly by saying in a clear and carrying voice to my  <br/>
child, &quot;Wow, you really want this...if only I had a napkin handy!&quot; in  <br/>
the hopes that a friendly nearby person will pipe up. They often do.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I am also a mom who deals with unexpected small messes by  <br/>
wiping them up with the inside of my skirt or t-shirt, so this is not  <br/>
an idea from the most fastidious end of the spectrum!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I want to say you go back to the principles which in this case are Safety <br/>
seemingly at odds with Independence. How can both of these principles be met <br/>
at the same time? One way that helps is to engage even a 2 1/2 year old in <br/>
the process. Rather than imposing your short list of solutions, ask her, <br/>
before she gets out of the car, what she would suggest. Discuss each <br/>
solution seriously with the pros and cons, even the silly to adult ears <br/>
ideas - even the &quot;I cross by myself&quot; ideas. It&#39;s OK to say, &quot;Well I know <br/>
that would be fun for you and you would feel like a big girl, but I would be <br/>
feel scared that someone in a big car wouldn&#39;t see you by yourself. What <br/>
else could we do?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Allow plenty of time. This is really key. Allow more time to discuss these <br/>
mindful parenting solutions - they do take longer than dictating and <br/>
expecting compliance. My experience is that they take longer than dictating <br/>
and then arguing too - but the discussions way more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes people have demonstrated the danger of parking lots by doing <br/>
fascinating things at home like rolling over a soda can in the car, or <br/>
making a game (at home in the driveway) of  inviting the child to sit in the <br/>
front seat and showing how hard it is to see someone little outside (like a <br/>
hide and seek).<br/>
<br/>
In the food-sample-denial case the principles were something like <br/>
Convenience, or maybe Control. I don&#39;t think either of those are useful if <br/>
you are looking for unschooling principles. At my place Curiosity is going <br/>
to trump Convenience almost every time. I would have been so pleased to see <br/>
2 1/2 yo Jayn&#39;s willingness to try a new food that no amount of mess would <br/>
be the least problem.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers learn to be aware of the hidden lessons that our children might <br/>
be inadvertently learning through our actions. I think it&#39;s part of both <br/>
deschooling and our personal development to gain this awareness. If the <br/>
unintended lesson is &quot;Mommy&#39;s mean&quot; or &quot;Mommy doesn&#39;t trust me&quot; or &quot;Mommy <br/>
doesn&#39;t care what I want&quot; then that inner voice is most likely going to <br/>
drown out the information that you are hoping would be heard like &quot;Parking <br/>
lots are dangerous&quot;. The emotional reactions and emotional needs, especially <br/>
of littler folk, are going to override their intellectual knowledge much of <br/>
the time.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes spending time. Facilitating our own mindfulness with our <br/>
children can take pre-planning - like *always* carrying spare clothes in the <br/>
car, or always having crayons and a little sketch pad, or always carrying a <br/>
couple of snack bars in our purse, or keeping the sand toys in the trunk. <br/>
All kinds of little plans that mean we get to say &quot;yes&quot; over and over <br/>
without fears or worries.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You mean there is an alternative to your t-shirt, jeans, skirt, etc? I keep a small baggie of wipes in my purse. My daughter could still care less if she has sticky hands or whatever else, my son on the other hand doesn&#39;t mind getting dirty but insists on being cleaned up ASAP. I also tend to take a couple of paper towels folded up as well. My son has never liked the sound of the electric hand dryers. They terrified him as a baby, I learned later once he was able to tell me it hurt it his ears. Though there have been times he can be seen following me out of the public restroom drying his hands on my bum, of course using his own is out of the question that would make them messy. But I have been a human napkin on more than one occasion whatever works. I do now tend to look for moms with two and under, they always have a diaper bag with them, if I am out of supplies. :)<br/>
<br/>
As for walking through parking lots, crossing the street and a refusal to hold hands. Our solution was a game in parking lots. The cross walks are train tracks and we either hold hands and chug right along or the kids would grab the bottom of my shirt and hold tight while I made train noises. The 4 of us (hubby included) can be found in parking lots doing this even now. Crossing the street we explained that a car or truck is coming down the road they won&#39;t so see them, so they need to hold a finger so that they can be seen. I didn&#39;t grasp their hand I offered a finger or two, whatever their hand could fit around and let them hold on. We also talked about looking both ways before crossing. The freedom of being able to move from here to there on your own is amazing to little ones and there is nothing in this world faster than a 2 yr old on a mission of exploration. I do suggest a good pair of running shoes. My son learned to walk at 8 months old, he has<br/>
 two speeds stop and go. So in a store that has buggies, I ask him if he wants to push the cart. He is just now tall enough to reach the actual handle but we got many a laugh going through the store with me guiding while his head was down and his arms on the legs it looked like I had an extra set of small feet. If we were lucky enough to be in a store that had race car buggies, police cars buggies, etc those have been the best, he gets to &quot;drive&quot;. He loves to help when we are out and about so I do what I can to make sure there are things he can help with, such as putting items in the buggy, putting them up on the check out belt. He is fascinated with the U-Scan aisles we have in so many stores now. <br/>
<br/>
Public places such as parks and such, when either of the kids were 2 I just prepared myself to be on the go constantly and stayed right behind them. So many things to look at, so many things to try and climb on. Good running shoes, two pair actually, expect for one to be muddy at any given time. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664956900">Instead of &quot;carrying&quot; we often offer to &quot;fly&quot; Katya (22 mos) to the edge of the parking lot, in a sort of modified Superman position. She lOVES it. Obviously there is a point at which your kid gets too heavy, and it&#39;s not for times when you have a million other things to carry, but it&#39;s a great win/win solution for us. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all the other posters! I am going to try some of your other suggestions.<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;For example, my 2 1/2 year old daughter would prefer to  walk instead of <br/>
&gt; being carried which is fine most of the time, but I get  nervous in places like <br/>
&gt; parking lots and some public places.  &gt;&gt;&gt; </span></blockquote></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1943009635">I think it could also help to voice your concerns and ask her if she has suggestions. Starting family problem solving at a young age is really helpful. She&#39;ll learn that you&#39;re willing to put time and thought into helping her get what she wants.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Did anyone else have the means to clean it up? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been known to break out a package of wipees in the store, use them on<br/>
&gt; the spot and pay for them in the checkout to take home or keep in the car.<br/>
&gt; I used to keep them in my purse actually when Karl was 3 and under (around<br/>
&gt; that age).  :D  In those days, my &quot;purse&quot; was a library bag full of Karl&#39;s<br/>
&gt; stuff ... clothes changes, books, trinkets, play items, food, etc.  My frump<br/>
&gt; bag went wherever we went.  I went to the library too but it rarely served<br/>
&gt; as a bag for library books.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1123525825">Holding hands while walking with an adult is often VERY physically <br/>
uncomfortable for a small child. I don&#39;t think most adults realize this or take it into <br/>
account when they&#39;re thinking about how to keep their child safe. Try walking <br/>
around with one arm held straight up alongside your head for a few minutes. <br/>
(Seriously, try it. At the very least, hold your arm WAY up while you&#39;re sitting <br/>
here reading email. Watch the clock and give it at least a minute.) <br/>
