<div id="ygrps-yiv-385433188">It is interesting to see how people change their point of view and change their attitudes, and just as interesting when they cling to ways or thoughts that no longer serve. <br/>
<br/>
As I was turning the list messages over in my mind, thinking about the examples of prompting learning v. learning about money or multiplication and noticed the shifting of context from example to explaination. It seems that the place/age/experience created the space for either misunderstanding or an opportunity for growth. <br/>
<br/>
With my children, questions are encouraged. Rather than explain, I try to show them. This has made me softer in my delivery of information because I&#39;m open to language and bridges that can be built rather than jumping on a word or phrase and perhaps alienating or damaging a friend, supporter, co-non-school-traveler. <br/>
<br/>
My husband has brain-damage from an accident, his language can be difficult and really frustrating for me. He&#39;ll insert the wrong word. Most of the time we can figure out what he meant by context but sometimes it&#39;s just... well, it is what it is... I&#39;ve learned that it&#39;s better to listen to the whole of the message instead of getting hung up on particular words. I save making an issue of word for when the context isn&#39;t clear, because really we&#39;re trying to communicate not judge each other. <br/>
<br/>
The following was clipped & sent for two reasons 1) I liked it and wanted to share it but 2) and more importantly, it shows that the unschooling / homeschooling / out-of-the-box  people have always had to explain ~this~ is what I mean when I say ~that~.  ;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;We have to educate ourselves to know who we are. That&#39;s what I mean when I say, &#39;Teach the children.&#39;&quot; --Eddie Benton-Banai, OJIBWAY <br/>

Have a lovely day with your children, I know that&#39;s my plan...<br/>

<br/>
Well....<br/>
I don&#39;t like the idea of &quot;educate ourselves&quot; or of educating anyone.<br/>
We don&#39;t have to educate ourselves to know who we are.<br/>
We need to feel and think and have the opportunity to make choices to  <br/>
learn more about ourselves, but we ARE who we are, without educating.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And &quot;Teach the children&quot; isn&#39;t &quot;educating ourselves&quot;, so that can&#39;t be  <br/>
what he means by &quot;We have to educate ourselves...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If that speaks to you, that&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s not speaking to you about  <br/>
unschooling.<br/>

Some people are oriented more to wholes than parts - Ray&#39;s like that. He&#39;s not logical in the sense of being able to pull together a bunch of parts into a whole. He can experience a whole and develop an understanding of how its made up of parts, though. <br/>
<br/>
Some people do really well the other way &#39;round - they like to see that parts of things and discover or invent or envision the whole, and given a whole they start pulling it apart. The parts are fascinating! Mo&#39;s more a parts person. <br/>
<br/>
Its not a black and white thing, like some people only see parts and some only wholes, the human mind is more sophisticated than that. Everyone does both to an extent, but everyone also favors one way to thinking, naturally. Some people call those differences &quot;logical&quot; and &quot;intuitive&quot; thinking, but those words are also loaded with cultural baggage that can get in the way. <br/>
<br/>
Its good to know that there are differences like that from the perspecitve of radical unschoolin - our kids don&#39;t always process in the same way we do. My pair think and solve problems very differently from one another!<br/>
<br/>
This list - most unschooling lists and discussions - involves a lot of looking at parts. That&#39;s not something that&#39;s going to be helpful for everyone! Some people prefer to post in a style that&#39;s more gestalt, and I bet some people like to read those kinds of posts, too.<br/>
<br/>
If there seems to be too much pulling things apart here, for your (general &quot;you&quot;) needs, you could keep looking, see what other lists are out there, or create an &quot;Intuitive Unschooling&quot; list and hold different kinds of discussions if you wanted. The dominent writers on any list will set the style, so invite people to come post who have a more wholistic writing style. Alternately, you might be the sort of person who does better reading essays and blogs, rather than the more q&a style of an email list or forum, so I&#39;ll take a moment to plug an unschooling site with a focus on blogs and a monthly set of essays:<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi Meredith <br/>
Thank you for your thoughtful post. Personally, I&#39;ve found the pulling apart to come across as petty and manipulative from time to time. I was hoping that my contribution would balance and offer a different viewpoint so as not to alienate people who are new on the list. But maybe I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;ve been wrong before. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for the suggestions but I&#39;ve not the time or the inclination to start such a discussion list. Sandra and Joyce do a great job of staying on top of posts. I&#39;ve got too many other demands on my time and would fall far short of the monitoring involved in such a list. But I might join one. ;) <br/>
<br/>
I do like this list because it makes me think about things. I don&#39;t think things out in posts but take it with me & ponder before making decisions or forming opinions. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have a name for what I do. What I do has changed with time. The focus is different for each of my children because they are individuals. I believe it&#39;s my duty to guide them through to adulthood. They haven&#39;t made all the decision because they&#39;re children.But I&#39;ve found that they are at the point where they just check their balance and thinkithings out with their mentor/guide/mom. Hey, I still check with my mentors/guides/elders.  <br/>
<br/>
I do like the philosophy that is offered here. But many of the suggestions on this list just don&#39;t work in practice for my kids. I don&#39;t do what doesn&#39;t work. I don&#39;t feel compelled to blast people for things they say have worked for them, but haven&#39;t worked for me. I don&#39;t need to make anyone wrong. I can just say to myself, well good that it worked for them and move on to something that will work for us.  <br/>
<br/>
Sandra and Joyce have pointed out they don&#39;t consider what I do to be unschooling. I don&#39;t know what to call what I&#39;ve done all these years I can say it has worked for us and it&#39;s not school at home. Will I offend or get blasted if I call it individual learning?  I understand that educating themselves got nixed. <br/>
 <br/>
So what do I have? What do I do? My three teens are so delightful. Life is calm, busy, interesting, musical, exciting. They like hanging out with their old mom ;) and I like hanging out with them too. We&#39;ve recently moved again so we&#39;re having a great time exploring our new place. I think we&#39;re just happy.<br/>
<br/>
Really, thanks for your input. I am rolling it though my thought process.  <br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t think I&#39;m objecting to improvement, do you?  Just the use of  <br/>
terms such as &quot;educated&quot; instead of talking in terms of learning.<br/>
<br/>
Learning is what unschooling is about, not education.<br/>
<br/>
-=-With my children, questions are encouraged. ...-=-<br/>
-=-This sounds stilted....<br/>
<br/>
Somehow that was turned into something for you to laugh about.<br/>
<br/>
To say &quot;With my children, questions are encouraged&quot; suggests perhaps  <br/>
that that&#39;s unusual, or that &quot;questions are encouraged&quot; in such a way  <br/>
the someone says &quot;I encourage your questions.&quot;  Somehow my point was  <br/>
missed.  Sorry.  I&#39;ll try again.<br/>
<br/>
Conversations encourage questions.  Being as natural and direct and  <br/>
personable with one&#39;s children as one would be with an adult friend is  <br/>
a way to encourage questions in a conversational manner.<br/>

It&#39;s not &quot;blasting&quot; or being offended.  It&#39;s pointing out (and it&#39;s  <br/>
not personal) when something will not serve the purpose of the list:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;This is a list for the examination of the philosophy of unschooling  <br/>
and attentive parenting and a place for sharing examined lives based  <br/>
on the principles underlying unschooling.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
If you don&#39;t consider what you do to be unschooling, then why call it  <br/>
something different and insist on posting it anyway, feeling that you  <br/>
might be &quot;offending&quot; or that objection is &quot;blasting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Probably the reason this quote wasn&#39;t useful is that it&#39;s not about  <br/>
unschooling at all.  It&#39;s about a tribe educating themselves and their  <br/>
children about tribal ways, most likely.<br/>

<br/>
When one quote has both &quot;educate&quot; AND &quot;teach,&quot; it doesn&#39;t seem like a  <br/>
great thing to bring to a list for the examination of the philosophy  <br/>
of unschooling and attentive parenting and a place for sharing  <br/>

My dd just finished reading a work of historical fantasy fiction (Bone, the complete set in one volume). She picked one volume of series up at a coffee shop and wanted the set - and as a result my partner and I are reading it. Its not really a &quot;children&#39;s book&quot; per se. There&#39;s a lot of history and politics and social relationships in that book, a lot of parody and humor and word-play. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one snapshot of my family engaged in sharing a story, learning about history and who we are as people and how that relates to the broader world - but its not any kind of teaching or education. Its learning as a natural result of a group of people living together, sharing our interests and likes with one another. <br/>

<br/>
How &#39;bout a friend? I share things with friends all the time - my partner, people I work with, neighbors, my kids. They share things with me. And sometimes -often! that sharing doesn&#39;t take the form or bringing or giving knowledge, but of discovering something together. I&#39;ve read descriptions of Bone and it didn&#39;t sound very interesting to me. Now I&#39;m fascinated - because my 8yo happened to pick up a copy someone had left behind. <br/>

For me, I saw learning as the tipping point.  If something was chosen  <br/>

In our family, learning was primary, but it wasn&#39;t very long after  <br/>
starting to live that way that we saw learning everywhere.<br/>

Some families seem to have taken the &quot;it&#39;s just living, it&#39;s not about  <br/>

not *because* it&#39;s those &quot;areas of interest.&quot;  It&#39;s because it had to  <br/>
do with something right in front of them at that moment.  They&#39;re  <br/>
living in the moment, but their environment is rich.<br/>

&gt; You don&#39;t think I&#39;m objecting to improvement, do you?  Just the use of<br/>
&gt; terms such as &quot;educated&quot; instead of talking in terms of learning.<br/>

&gt; Learning is what unschooling is about, not education.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; Somehow that was turned into something for you to laugh about.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To say &quot;With my children, questions are encouraged&quot; suggests perhaps<br/>
&gt; that that&#39;s unusual, or that &quot;questions are encouraged&quot; in such a way<br/>
&gt; the someone says &quot;I encourage your questions.&quot;  Somehow my point was<br/>
&gt; missed.  Sorry.  I&#39;ll try again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Conversations encourage questions.  Being as natural and direct and<br/>
&gt; personable with one&#39;s children as one would be with an adult friend is<br/>
&gt; a way to encourage questions in a conversational manner.<br/>

It didn&#39;t bother me emotionally.  I thought less of the poster, but  <br/>
it&#39;s not like I remember her name.  I know it bothers some people, but  <br/>
I don&#39;t often even try to learn the names of new posters unless they  <br/>

I think some of those involved in the discussion will think the person  <br/>
was being defensive, or not really reading.  But each other reader  <br/>
will make a &quot;getting warmer / getting colder&quot; move, mentally, about  <br/>
the issue being discussed.  Sometimes something seemingly unrelated  <br/>

<br/>
Laughing about something that someone is saying, in this context, IS a defensive <br/>
technique.  If what someone says isn&#39;t true, why laugh about it?  Either it is <br/>
or isn&#39;t true, but somewhere in someone&#39;s written account something was <br/>
misrepresented to such an extent that either they don&#39;t know what they are <br/>
saying or what they are saying isn&#39;t entirely what they mean to be saying.  That <br/>
is why writing clearly is so important in a written forum.  So, IF you are going <br/>
to write, be aware that your audience may interpret what you say to mean <br/>
something you didn&#39;t intend.  If that&#39;s the case, look carefully at what you&#39;ve <br/>
written to see where that confusion came from and address it.<br/>
