Wow.  It looks like many are washing more than us.  We have tile,<br/>
hand-picked with no glaze.  The reason......no glaze means you cannot see<br/>
any dirt, animal spongy feet marks, etc.  So, I vacuum the floor about 3<br/>
times per week (we live in NM...sand), but I only heat / steam mop about<br/>
twice per year.  YEAH FOR NON-GLAZE TILE!!!!  heehee<br/>

It is not terra cotta, but one of those fake brands.  It has a lot of in and<br/>
out coloring with a non-glaze surface. If you look across the room there is<br/>
no sheen to it at all.<br/>
