<div id="ygrps-yiv-329433967">Chris/Zamozo sent me an article.   I&#39;m flipped two paragraphs to make  <br/>
a point.   #1, POOR KIDS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Research into video gaming is still in its infancy, and researchers  <br/>
haven&#39;t agreed on how to define addiction. But many experts say it&#39;s  <br/>
clear many of the young people who show dependency on video games are  <br/>
in trouble.<br/>
<br/>
His detox program begins in July. It will run four to eight weeks,  <br/>
and will include therapy sessions, wilderness excursions, healthy  <br/>
lifestyle workshops and possibly medication.<br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re going to medicate people (possibly) for something that isn&#39;t  <br/>
defined.<br/>
<br/>
This should be criminal.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The article talks about addiction in China, the Netherlands...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of early 20th and 19th century opinions that  <br/>
masturbation was a disease, and boys were &quot;treated&quot; for it�some of  <br/>
them died and some killed themselves, and some were just scarred for  <br/>
life, and found ways to act out their confusion and pain on others,  <br/>
who passed it on to others...<br/>
<br/>
There will be kids whose parents send them involuntarily to a clinic  <br/>
to be &quot;cured&quot; of video gaming this summer, instead of them having  <br/>
some time to relax from school in a way that&#39;s more useful and  <br/>
intellectually stimulating than being at school.<br/>
<br/>
And this:  -=-In a 2005 study, Jansz said gamers are overwhelmingly  <br/>
males, especially in violent games where adolescents find &quot;a safe  <br/>
private laboratory where they can experience different emotions.&quot;- <br/>
=-     Sure!  They could turn off the games, go outside and use the  <br/>
world as a public laboratory to experience violence and different  <br/>
emotions.  Lots of kids do.  And they join gangs and kill people and  <br/>
go to prison in such numbers as it would seem to be noticeable, and  <br/>
you&#39;d think people would see video gaming as a safe home-game  <br/>
alternative to trying those things out behind some bowling alley.<br/>
<br/>
-=-&quot;Many of these kids believe that when they sit down, they&#39;re going  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-377576344">DONT LET MY DH SEE THIS!  lol seriously he is one that thinks that because<br/>
there are so many adults he has known that just work and go home and play<br/>
their games that Seth will end up like that if we don&#39;t monitor how long he<br/>
plays.  I will admit I used to hate the idea of a gaming system in my home<br/>
because nothing would ever get done but to my defense, Seth was in school<br/>
then AND I was parenting much different than I do now.  I am working on<br/>
learning to trust him regulating himself on many things and letting him<br/>
figure things out on his own.  What my dh doesn&#39;t get is that the adults<br/>
that hyper-focus/make gaming their life outside of work were not ever<br/>
taught/allowed to self-regulate so now they are over indulging.  <br/>
 <br/>
A question to ponder...how is over-indulging on foods any different than<br/>
over-indulging on games?  In that respect, isn&#39;t it about time they came up<br/>
with this clinic?  I mean we have them for weight loss and such so why not<br/>
for everything else seen as an addiction?  Of course I think these should be<br/>
strictly for adults who can make the conscious choice to attend the clinic<br/>
of their own free will.  But who are we to judge who &quot;needs&quot; it or not?  If<br/>
people who are &quot;addicted&quot; to gaming don&#39;t have a problem with it, then why<br/>
should we as a society?  I mean seriously, if we are sending our kids to<br/>
school to produce non-thinking drones, why wouldn&#39;t we like them just<br/>
sitting in from of the computer/TV playing video games...which in many<br/>
peoples eyes are non-productive?  OR is it that the &#39;powers that be&quot; see the<br/>
games as ways for people to break free of the norm and start using those<br/>
critical thinking skills we aren&#39;t supposed to access so they see a need to<br/>
get us off the games and back to force feeding us socialization as they see<br/>
it?<br/>
 <br/>
Okay so maybe I am going off the deep end here but these are all a series of<br/>
questions that bombarded my lil brain when I read this post.  anyone care to<br/>
expand?  Can you tell I have been reading &quot;Dumbing Us Down,&quot; can ya, can ya,<br/>
huh?  lol<br/>

That is crazy. So now people need detox and medication for doing something<br/>
that helps them to relax in a healthy manner.<br/>

<br/>
Your use of &quot;taught/allowed&quot; as a combined construct doesn&#39;t make sense.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; someone to &quot;self-regulate.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And as to controls, the most controlled kids when it comes to food  <br/>
seem to end up the most overeating or bulemic or anorexic adults.  So  <br/>
how WOULD a parent &quot;teach&quot; &quot;self-regulation&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
These ideas have all come up before, and some of what was written  <br/>
before is collected here:<br/>
<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/choice">http://sandradodd.com/choice</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And Joyce Fetteroll has written quite a bit about how trying to  <br/>
control people backfires in more ways than one.<br/>
<br/>

not<br/>

<br/>
There have been &quot;fat camps&quot; and spas and gyms and diet organizations  <br/>
and personal diet coaches for longer than any of us have been alive,  <br/>
but what&#39;s your point?<br/>
<br/>
-=-I mean seriously, if we are sending our kids to<br/>
school to produce non-thinking drones, why wouldn&#39;t we like them just<br/>

peoples eyes are non-productive?-=-<br/>
<br/>
They go to school because parents tell them to, so they can do what  <br/>
teachers tell them to do.<br/>
If they go home and play games, they aren&#39;t doing what their parents  <br/>
tell them to do or what teachers tell them to do.<br/>
<br/>
Are you forgetting that school&#39;s control doesn&#39;t end when kids go  <br/>
home?  There&#39;s homework and getting clothes ready and going to bed  <br/>
&quot;early on a schoolnight.&quot;<br/>
Control, control, control.<br/>
<br/>
Then people grow up and think &quot;Now that I&#39;m grown, &#39;they&#39; can&#39;t  <br/>
control me anymore,&quot; and they eat, or stay up, or drink, or play  <br/>
video games.  That doesn&#39;t make it an addiction.  (Drinking can be a  <br/>
physical addiction, and some kinds of eating might be, but not ALL.)   <br/>
It makes it a response to earlier mistreatment.   And it&#39;s a  <br/>
predictable, logical response too.   So now they will take your money  <br/>
to medicate and cold-turkey and counsel you out of a reasonable  <br/>
response to too many years of powerlessness.<br/>
<br/>
More control.<br/>
