<br/>
My 13 year old daughter Pearl is interested in learning more about game design.  She&#39;s been considering attending a summer day camp with iD Tech Camps.  <br/>
<br/>
They sound pretty cool. The camps cover things like Game Design, Web Design, Programming, Robotics, Video Editing, Photography, Graphic Design.  This is right up Pearl&#39;s alley.<br/>
<br/>
Pearl likes to do research before she signs up for anything.  She&#39;s read some reviews that she found online, but would like more information from anyone who may have gone to one of these camps.<br/>
<br/>
I offered to ask the folks on this group if anyone had direct experience with this organization, and whether they&#39;d recommend it.  Pearl said she&#39;d really like that.<br/>
<br/>
So, I&#39;m asking.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that is an OK use of this list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1500250758">Yes, Kathryn took a couple of their classes and loved them.<br/>
<br/>
I think, I&#39;m not positive though, they use college students to run  <br/>
them so I&#39;m not sure what checks they have in place to maintain  <br/>
quality. They&#39;ve been running them for quite a few years, though, so I  <br/>
think they&#39;re getting some part of it right :-)<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don’t think it was on this list, but another unschooling list, a year or so back, someone posted that their child who had never done any camp or enjoyed organized groups like that had done ID tech camp and loved it.  I have been considering it for my son, once he’s interested/ready as well, although the 8:30 am start and full day with group games and other “campy” stuff wouldn’t appeal to him right now. I really wish they offered a half day, computer stuff only, program.  I hope to hear how she likes it if she ends up doing it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1600618444">Hi Jennie.  My two oldest sons went to iD Tech Camp for about 4 years and loved it!  They had a blast and learned a lot.  It is mostly run by college kids with some older adults in supervisory positions.  They went near us in Ann Arbor to University of Michigan.<br/>
<br/>
Another great camp is at Michigan Tech.  My middle son has been going to that camp for three years.  It&#39;s quite a drive up to Houghton from Ann Arbor, but well worth it.  My youngest son and I go, too, and have fun in the area for the week.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun finding just what Pearl will love!!<br/>
