<div id="ygrps-yiv-1239955860">I&#39;m over 150 e-mails behind, having slept a whole nine hours and then taken <br/>
Holly for x-rays (teeth) and shopping (gratuitous), and looked at private mail <br/>
first.  Here&#39;s something from a friend of mine in Sweden.  It&#39;s a link to a <br/>
site answering a question about the plural of &quot;penis.&quot;   Besides being very <br/>
funny, it&#39;s got useful, good stuff.  A couple of quotes, and the URL below:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Penis is a third declension noun, not second declension. These nouns often <br/>
end in -is in the singular and -es in the plural. The English style -ises is <br/>
sometimes preferred. Hence, we have penises (half of us do, anyway), and <br/>
mantises and pelvises, but only more rarely do you see penes, mantes, and pelves, <br/>
though they are not incorrect. In many cases, only the Latin form is <br/>
acceptable: We have testes (some more than others) and crises and psychoses, but never <br/>
testises, crisises, or pyschosises. -=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-Some English -us nouns were borrowed from other parts of speech in Latin <br/>
or from other forms (cases) of the noun than the usual nominative. Most of us <br/>
don&#39;t get boni or ride bi (but I&#39;m not judgmental if you do). We get bonuses <br/>
and ride buses.-=-<br/>
