<div id="ygrps-yiv-1464581236">Anonymous question from someone who has been unschooling for a long time:<br/>
<br/>
________<br/>
<br/>
How do you handle those days, weeks or even months when you know you could be doing more and better with your children but simply can&#39;t?<br/>
<br/>
I am now working from home, but more than I wish and can&#39;t change that situation yet... In about 2-3 more months things will be better for sure...<br/>
<br/>
I see our three children some days cranky, bored and not as happy... What I am doing is just telling them the truth about our current situation and trying to be with them as much as I can, though I know it is not enough... <br/>
<br/>
Any advice? Thanks…<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435199391">Invite an older child or a teen over to play with them (maybe for some money, maybe for the joy of getting out of their own home and playing with your stuff).<br/>
<br/>
Put happy music on when you can.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t appear to be worried or guilty.  Don’t be a downer.<br/>
<br/>
Don’t think of it as “but simply can’t?” because it makes you a victim, powerless, helpless.  It’s not true, for one thing.  You’re still making choices.  So as part of the choice to work more from home, choose counteracting activities to go with it.<br/>

<br>==============</blockquote><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Do they have computers? If you install skype for each of them, it doesn&#39;t take more than a few seconds or distract you from your work much to send them messages and stickers and emojis from time to time. It&#39;s a nice way of letting them know you haven&#39;t forgotten about them while you work.<br></div><div><br></div><div>When my four were younger, I found it much easier to get things done later on in the day. If I&#39;d started the day with them, playing and giving them attention, they were happier about me getting on with other things later on. You might find it helpful to shift your day around a bit if you can, so you work more in the afternoon and give time to the children in the morning - literally putting them first. Then when you&#39;ve finished work, make time to do something with them again, go out for a walk or play a game, before starting on dinner or anything else that isn&#39;t focused on the children.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div>Bernadette.</div></span></blockquote></div></div></div>
