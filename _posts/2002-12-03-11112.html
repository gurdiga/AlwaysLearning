<div id="ygrps-yiv-1178494089">Hello,<br/>
<br/>
Last Wed.am Tim, my sweet Hubby, headed over to the care facility and picked<br/>
up his father, Charles. The two of them headed to Novato, 1 hour away, to pick<br/>
up David, Tim&#39;s brother. David has Downs Syndrom. David was at a different<br/>
location and the trip became a 6 hour stuck in traffic ordeal. Charles suffers<br/>
from a stroke 5 years ago and is paralyzed on the left side. This is Tim&#39;s<br/>
family. We hosted a Thanksgiving meal. 12 people, my mom, sister and family,<br/>
Tim&#39;s family, our 3 kids. Friday Ashley was busy with a final dress rehersal<br/>
and openning night musical. Saturday we brought Tim&#39;s dad to see the Sound of<br/>
Music matinee. Ashley was is a few special parts and danced great. We had a<br/>
family meal, our way, at Round Table Pizza. Sunday Tim went to take his<br/>
brother back home. Charles wanted to go also, but Tim noticed he was coughing<br/>
a ton and left him at the care facility. Turns out Charles has pneumonia and<br/>
was rushed to the hospital Sunday pm. He&#39;ll be there for while. Tim watched<br/>
him turn blue yesterday. He saw death. And then life again. Today is Charles<br/>
73rd Birthday. Tim will go see him later today. The kids do not want to go to<br/>
the hospital. Tim looks sad, worried and worn. He and I had coffee together<br/>
this am (kids still sleeping) and that was nice.<br/>

Hi, Mary --<br/>
<br/>
I hope you can find some time to rest and have a nice cup of tea (wait,<br/>
make that coffee).  Life has been incredibly stressful for you and your family.<br/>
<br/>
It seems like virus season this fall in N. Calif. is especially fierce. <br/>
There is a child at my park day that has already had pnuemonia twice. <br/>
My dh had pleurisy.  Son is coughing very raucously even as I type.<br/>
<br/>
My mom&#39;s boyfriend had a stroke more than three years ago and is still<br/>
making progress.  &quot;Experts&quot; claim that almost all recovery will happen<br/>
in the first year, but this is not what we are seeing.  Jim didn&#39;t<br/>
regain much of any movement in his right side the first year, but when I<br/>
saw him at Thanksgiving he showed me that he&#39;s suddenly able to move his<br/>
right leg and foot.<br/>
<br/>
Please do all you can to take care of yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes,<br/>
Betsy</div>

It&#39;s mind boggling, what life brings us.  I&#39;m sorry your husband (and all<br/>
of you) are so stressed right now and that your father in law is ill.   <br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a better idea that your kids don&#39;t go to the hospital.  <br/>
They have super-bugs at hospitals and I think it&#39;s really dangerous for<br/>
kids to be there if they don&#39;t have to be.   Harder for your husband to<br/>
go alone though, maybe.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there, Mary.<br/>
