<div id="ygrps-yiv-1041203303">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
My pet peeve as well.... When people tell me they don&#39;t have any choice<br/>
I usually ask them if they are in the Military.  When they answer &quot;No&quot;<br/>
then I say &quot;well then everything you do or say or even your way of<br/>
living and being is a choice&quot;.... I usually get a &quot;yeah but...&quot;  And<br/>
even going into the Military is a choice, it&#39;s just once you are in it,<br/>
you have to wait a while if you want to get out without going to jail.<br/>
Still that would be a choice to go AWOL!!!<br/>

Namaste<br/>

&lt;&lt; Lately, I&#39;ve been craving a nice big meal of pure unschooling -- so<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m back.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well let&#39;s stir it up some then!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just back from Las Vegas, Nevada, where I spoke at a conference (and<br/>
<br/>
Holly helped the first day) and said one thing new, that I had saved to<br/>
say.    I <br/>
said intro, middle and end, &quot;You don&#39;t have to do things my way, but the<br/>
fact <br/>
that my way works means you don&#39;t *have* to do things your way.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
I think I might have hit my life&#39;s limit of people saying &quot;Well, some<br/>
things <br/>
we HAVE to do,&quot; or &quot;We had no choice about...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
EEEEk!<br/>
<br/>
A couple of people lately (one in person at the conference) I&#39;ve said<br/>
&quot;You DO <br/>
have a choice&quot; and gone on in some detail.  The mom I was talking to was<br/>
<br/>
unhappy about things with her three youngish adopted kids, VERY close in<br/>
age, and <br/>
she was feelng trapped and stuck.  I asked her if she had her car in the<br/>
<br/>
parking lot.  Yes.  Charge card?  Yes.<br/>
<br/>
So I told her she didn&#39;t have to go home.  She could go to the airport<br/>
and <br/>
fly to Japan.  (Forgot to ask if she had a passport, but it could&#39;ve<br/>
been <br/>
Honolulu, then, or Fairbanks, or the other end of Canada.)  I said she<br/>
could be <br/>
having plastic surgery by Tuesday and never come home.<br/>
<br/>
Extreme?<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh.  If people have THAT much choice, surely they can choose to have<br/>
<br/>
dinner later, or to move the TV to another room.   &quot;We had no choice&quot; is<br/>
just <br/>
starting to get to me.<br/>
<br/>
People choose not to kill themselves.  That&#39;s usually a good choice.<br/>
But <br/>
choosing to stay with children means having the responsibility for that<br/>
choice.  <br/>
We chose to babysit a batch of kids today, so four extras.  It will make<br/>
our <br/>
whole day more exciting.   I could have chosen the less exciting, less<br/>
helpful. <br/>
 I could choose to put them all in the van and drive them to their mom<br/>
and <br/>
say &quot;Changed my mind.&quot;  At any moment, there are choices, and<br/>
responsibilities, <br/>
and options.<br/>

------------------<br/>
<br/>
Partly it&#39;s the choice of words, I know.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No choice&quot; with no conditions might be worth challenging.<br/>
<br/>
But really what the question is is &quot;No choice if what?&quot; or &quot;No choice within <br/>
what context?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I feel compelled to...&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;To maintain my integrity I have to...&quot;<br/>
or<br/>
&quot;To keep my children as happy as I like to, I have to...&quot; do whatever.<br/>
<br/>
There have been some heated conversations about this in the past, and some of <br/>
it I saved <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/haveto">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/haveto</a><br/>
