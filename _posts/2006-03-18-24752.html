<div id="ygrps-yiv-1301236812">You wouldn&#39;t go into a car dealer and pay the sticker price so why in<br/>
the world would you pay full price for your groceries and other<br/>
expenses? This was the sentence that I overheard that really caught<br/>
my attention. At the end of our school&#39;s PTA meeting, several of us<br/>
began talking about the soaring costs of everything, one of the<br/>
members told us how she is saving a tremendous amount of money on<br/>
groceries, eating out, pictures and just about everything else you<br/>
could imagine. To make a long story short, she said she joined a<br/>
program at: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://couponsforlife.com">http://couponsforlife.com</a> She told us that the sampler<br/>
package includes savings on just about everything you could imagine.<br/>
I was shocked she joined since I have known this woman a very long<br/>
time and she has always been a huge skeptic. I asked her what made<br/>
her decide to join this. She told me she checked the company out with<br/>
the better business bureau who verified that they have been in<br/>
business since Oct. 1983 and they have an outstanding record with<br/>
them. She said she also checked them out with Paypal who processes<br/>
their payments and Paypal informed her that the company has provided<br/>
all business paperwork, and has had several thousand customers<br/>
through their payment process. They went on to say that they offer a<br/>
guarantee for this company&#39;s products. In her words, that was enough<br/>
for her to try them out and she &quot;has never been happier with a<br/>
company&#39;s products&quot; in her life. The rest of us couldn&#39;t wait to sign<br/>
up. She showed us some receipts in her bag and savings were eye<br/>
popping!</div>
