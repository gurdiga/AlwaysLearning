<div id="ygrps-yiv-710846472">The other night I was wondering why some kids can be so impatient.  <br/>
Then I realized how impatiently most adults treat children.  <br/>
I see it all the time.  When a child wants something, they are usually <br/>
told to wait and that they need to learn to be patient.  Then I hear <br/>
the adults saying things like &quot;I said NOW&quot;! (to whatever their request <br/>
was).<br/>
<br/>
Of course I realized it when I was being impatient, but thankfully that <br/>
is not often and my daughter is pretty darn patient for a four year old.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s probably a no brainer for most of you here, but my mind <br/>
was just exploding with thoughts like this.  Writing them down, they <br/>
seem painfully obvious.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah, I&#39;m having a bit of trouble with my expectations of patience at the <br/>
moment. As always, it&#39;s me and my attitude that are creating any problems. <br/>
It is especially difficult in these times of heightened emotions - the <br/>
Holidays - for Jayn to be patient at all, let alone *more* patient than <br/>
usual just because I am busier.<br/>

That&#39;s true, and it&#39;s doubly ironic that the adults who should have  <br/>
learned to be patient are not.  They expect kids to act like adults  <br/>
while they themselves are acting like kids. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

We just had a family friend (Jene) stay with us for a<br/>
couple of nights.  She is like a second grandmother to<br/>
me.  I was about to help her turn on the TV, but my<br/>
little one needed me and I followed her instead and<br/>
stuck my head over the stair railing and yelled to my<br/>
dd Katie (10) to please help Jene with the Tv.  Then I<br/>
dashed after my youngest dd. Jene apparently also<br/>
asked Katie for help, but Katie was totally into her<br/>
computer game and had only a minute or so left and<br/>
said that she would help her in a minute or something<br/>
like that.  (Later my dd told me that Jene had rolled<br/>
her eyes and walked away.)  During a conversation a<br/>
few hours later, Jene told me that she was shocked<br/>
that my dd did not immediately come and help her when<br/>
asked.  I said that often I answer like that if I am<br/>
involved with a thought or am halfway through writing<br/>
a sentence.  So I know where she got that from.  Jene<br/>
said that she meant that she was not used to children<br/>
being able to tell an adult to wait.  She said the way<br/>
she was raised, a child did what was asked by an adult<br/>
right away.  She said that she is not used to children<br/>
and adults being equal.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think it was terribly rude of my dd to tell<br/>
someone else they&#39;d help in a minute.  I do not<br/>
believe that kids should jump up and please adults, I<br/>
guess really no one should do that unless they want<br/>
to.  You&#39;d think adults would have more patience and<br/>
know that the kids are learning patience from them and<br/>
other models they are exposed to.  What do kids learn<br/>
when an adult acts or thinks this way?  That people<br/>
eventually can &quot;expect&quot; others to stop what they are<br/>
doing and immediately help them?  I think it is far<br/>
better to model genuinely asking for help, being<br/>
patient and showing gratitude.  Laurie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-267364385">This is so true. I catch myself demanding immediate responses from my DD8, while often not responding to her immediately when deep in thought, trying to figure something out on the computer, reading a recipe, etc. I also notice that I will say, &quot;Will you run and get the scissors for me?&quot; or &quot;Will you go shut of that light for me?&quot; I don&#39;t want to treat her like a servant and I always show that I am happy to do the same for her if she asks, &quot;Can you get my slippers for me?&quot; or &quot;Can you get me a cup of water?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
I like what Laurie wrote: &quot;  I think it is far<br/>
 better to model genuinely asking for help, being<br/>
 patient and showing gratitude.&quot; We should model patience with each other as well as patience with ourselves. <br/>
