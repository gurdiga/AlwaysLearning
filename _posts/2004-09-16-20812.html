<div id="ygrps-yiv-1165915903">I&#39;m sure this is an old topic, but I haven&#39;t dealt with it in a long time<br/>
and have been pretty aggravated lately, a sure sign I need help and new<br/>
perspective.<br/>
<br/>
We have regular family meetings to establish things that need to be done<br/>
around the house, or to change the way we do something because it isn&#39;t<br/>
working, or its boring, or whatever. We all have equal say, unless my<br/>
husband or I have a particular belief that we think is important enough to<br/>
call the shot (usually having to do with money), and we&#39;ll say that there is<br/>
something that we don&#39;t have negotiation room for (this rarely happens<br/>
though...the kids make great decisions with monetary information as well as<br/>
other things).<br/>
<br/>
Lately, the house has been trashed. It used to be that my concerns about<br/>
this expressed at meetings were taken seriously and solutions were<br/>
brainstormed and implemented. But lately, I&#39;ve been blown off. I guess I&#39;m<br/>
sounding like a broken record (though I haven&#39;t said anything for at least<br/>
three months). I am not prudish about a clean house...far from it! But I do<br/>
have minimum requirements...the front entranceway needs to be passable, food<br/>
needs to be put away and dishes clean within a day of using them, etc. I<br/>
just like to keep the bugs at bay! And I do want the entrance to the house,<br/>
the first thing a &quot;guest&quot; sees, to be tidy. There&#39;s lots of other spaces to<br/>
mess up. My three boys seem to have no interest or care about any of this.<br/>
Come to think of it, my husband either. My daughter and I are the only ones<br/>
who agree on this. So, I don&#39;t want to be low-level pissed all the time<br/>
because it&#39;s a mess and I and my daughter are the only ones who want it<br/>
clean, nor do I necessarily want to play this heavy-handedly and make it<br/>
happen. Wait. I take that back. I DO want to play this heavy-handedly, but<br/>
my unschooling brain says, &quot;No! Don&#39;t! You know better!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How do you incorporate house keeping into your unschooling and how do you<br/>
decide what needs to be done when and by whom?<br/>
<br/>
Any suggestions about the unschooling way to get what I want done :) ?<br/>
(that was written as a joke, but I do want some suggestions about why this<br/>
isn&#39;t working for me right now).<br/>
Thank you!<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can pretty much trash the kitchen -- the entry to the house -- as soon as<br/>
I walk in the door ;-) It wouldn&#39;t help if someone nagged me. What I need<br/>
are places to put common things that I bring in.<br/>
<br/>
So maybe look at what gets put there and find ways to manage it. If it&#39;s<br/>
shoes, put a bin there, then clean it out occasionally to remove shoes that<br/>
aren&#39;t used regularly. Get hooks for coats and regularly put away the ones<br/>
that don&#39;t get used much so there aren&#39;t too many for the hooks.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s mail, get a mail station with cubbies and put a trash can beneath<br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
One good suggestion from How To Talk So Kids Will Listen is just use one<br/>
word to remind someone. If it&#39;s a common thing they&#39;re just not noticing,<br/>
like taking a dish into the kitch, just say &quot;Dish.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re passing by and empty handed say &quot;Could you take a load into the<br/>
kitchen please?&quot; But assume you&#39;ll have to make passes too.<br/>

My best advice is to learn to get over the low-level resentment.<br/>
If you do what you do lovingly and generously, they&#39;ll be more loving and <br/>
generous in return.  It might not show right away (probably won&#39;t) but the <br/>
benefit to the family of you just moving things sweetly instead of angrily will be <br/>
immediate, and the benefit to you of not feeling that others aren&#39;t meeting <br/>
your requirements will be immediate.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do have minimum requirements...-=-<br/>
<br/>
Despite the claim of fair family meetings, this does make it sound as though <br/>
at least in your own head it&#39;s your house and others have requirements of your <br/>
creation.   <br/>
<br/>
Maybe you could have a meeting with all the voices in your head and tell your <br/>
mom and your grandmothers and your theory-mostly feminist friends and jealous <br/>
other female voices in there whoever they are that your children&#39;s safety and <br/>
peace and happiness are more important to you than the old tapes in your head <br/>
that say &quot;have to&quot; and &quot;should.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I used to get very cranky that the kids weren&#39;t doing what I wanted them to <br/>
do, but because of other people&#39;s writings at unschooling.com (the late <br/>
departed, or else the in-a-coma unschooling.com) I changed.   Everybody&#39;s happier.  <br/>
The house isn&#39;t as clean as an imagination could make it, but an imagination <br/>
won&#39;t make it clean, and the damage to the relationships would cast a sad layer <br/>
of emotional dirt over it anyway if I DID force my way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841376068">You know - something I&#39;ve found actually helped me on both sides of this<br/>
issue - both helping my kids (and husband) to see a reason for keeping<br/>
things relatively neat AND helping myself to lighten up my own requirements<br/>
was to get out and among other people and their homes more. It sounds<br/>
strange, but the more we see how other people actually live (as opposed to<br/>
the fantasy in our minds - fed by TV or magazine pictures of perfectly kept<br/>
places) the less we stress as we begin to compare our living space with<br/>
other actual living spaces. And if the kids actually are far below normal<br/>
standards, they too will get the hint by more exposure to real life<br/>
situations - and no one has to get upset or impose any standards on anyone<br/>
else. Another thing that worked well for me was to plan more activities with<br/>
other people in OUR home. Everyone likes to have a clean space when company<br/>
is coming and it even motivated me to Herculean feats when I knew there was<br/>
a party the day after tomorrow. This is also coming from a woman who used to<br/>
have to fantasize that the dirty dishes were alien ships and cleaning them<br/>
would kill their leaders. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Not at all! Welcome!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I have a GN once a month to motivate me to clean deeply at least<br/>
once&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, what is a GN? Even with years on the internet, I&#39;m still learning<br/>
abbreviations.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I also encourage friends to come over to keep a low level<br/>
matenence all the time&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I do this too. It is a good strategy. Now if I could just get the courage up<br/>
to encourage my friends to come over to do the low level maintenance... :-)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;And I instituted a nightly clean up of<br/>
trippup toys when my son was young to set the routine early&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This doesn&#39;t jive so much with me, because I work really hard not to<br/>
institute anything, but to problem solve together. And at the moment, I&#39;m<br/>
the only one with the problem! So I think solutions will have to be about<br/>
how I need to change so that either I don&#39;t see it as a problem, or I just<br/>
take care of what bothers me (sweetly and lovingly...my mantra as I&#39;m doing<br/>
it :) ). And I need to have a meeting with the voices in my head. I love<br/>
that line...it makes me laugh every time...it is sooo true.<br/>
<br/>
This does bring up the question, why do you feel you need to &quot;set routines&quot;<br/>
early with your guy? There is such a strong pull to do that, but it also<br/>
sets a routine for making you the leader and him the follower. I think it<br/>
works better to be the example and let the child figure out what &quot;routines&quot;<br/>
work for them. You may be surprised by what happens! I have learned great<br/>
strategies from my children, different ways to do things that I had been<br/>
doing my whole life.<br/>
<br/>
Since you are new, please understand that I am just responding to some of<br/>
your ideas, not you personally. I am on the new side on this list myself,<br/>
and was a little taken aback by having my ideas bantered about once they<br/>
were on the list. It&#39;s not personal. (See, I&#39;m learning!)<br/>
<br/>
The last comment I have is about flylady.net. I had never heard of it before<br/>
and so I visited it just now. All I can say is I hope I never end up like<br/>
the women portrayed there...frazzled to the core! I think the goal is to<br/>
keep perspective, keep loving, keep enjoying. A messy house is a sign of<br/>
activity, interest, productivity, fun, and more. Spending too much time on<br/>
keeping it clean will certainly take time away from the fun of messing it<br/>
up.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the feedback so far. It has been helpful!<br/>

<br/>
Several places I&#39;ve visited had cleaning ladies.   <br/>
<br/>
Much of the ideal American home involves keeping a home in the way they were <br/>
kept when people had maids, pre-Great-Depression days, and for single-family <br/>
suburbians to be prepared at any moment to serve tea, or have a photographer <br/>
in.  It&#39;s not realistic.   A mountain of valium went into helping keep 60&#39;s <br/>
housewives sane through their repeated attempts.<br/>
<br/>
I have many other projects and dreams, and having my house look as though <br/>
someone (or a mom AND a maid or housekeeper) worked to keep it perfect all the <br/>
time isn&#39;t on my top 50.   Bummer for some, bonus for others. &lt;g&gt;   But at the <br/>
moment my laundry is ALL done and mostly put away,  dishes are clean, dinner <br/>
stuff is thawing, I made pancakes and ham for breakfast, took Kirby to get his <br/>
REAL full-fledged driver&#39;s license, cleaned the fireplace for the coming <br/>
season, watered the whole yard . . .    it partly makes up for me being gone five <br/>
days altogether. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-183468744">Absolutely! <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s also interesting to me - once I started researching how cleaning was<br/>
done historically to find how obsessive we are now in relation to just a few<br/>
generations ago The kind of cleaning we do now EVERY week was done only a<br/>
few times a year and often cleaning something like a kitchen involved<br/>
slopping all surfaces with water and letting it run down drains in floors.<br/>
Bathrooms, of course, were not an indoor affair for many families. With our<br/>
sensibilities (fed almost exclusively by people with something to sell us)<br/>
would have found our great-grandmothers to be positively slovenly!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve always been an artist - and so have developed an approach to cleaning<br/>
that reflects the importance of this in my life. We have the &quot;common&quot; areas<br/>
- where guests are welcomed, which we try to keep up to a higher standard -<br/>
bathroom, kitchen, living room. Then we have our private areas - bedrooms,<br/>
personal baths, office, which we each get to choose how to keep. And finally<br/>
we have the &quot;creative&quot; areas - these we really let blossom. There is no food<br/>
left there, but other than that - studios are made for breaking molds. This<br/>
approach seems to work for everyone in our household very well most of the<br/>
time and we all discussed it and came up with these solutions together. <br/>

(Oh, wait...  maybe...)<br/>
<br/>
We have three kinds of pumpkins growing like crazy in our back yard, crawling <br/>
over each other, grabbing our baby trees (and I grab the trees back), and as <br/>
gardening goes it&#39;s very erratic.  It&#39;s also very beautiful, and they&#39;re <br/>
leaving us secret presents, down under the leaves, and we will have a lot of jack o <br/>
lanterns.   It&#39;s not organized, or necessary, or efficient, or &quot;right&quot; in any <br/>
way except one of the kinds is just from last year&#39;s jack-o&#39;lantern that <br/>
Holly threw out in the yard, and the other two were bought seed-packs.   And it <br/>
makes the yard all green and flowery.    And after the frost, there will be a <br/>
big pile of compost-fodder in all those vines and leaves.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re enjoying the unexpected craziness of it all.  I was wanting to limit <br/>
them, earlier in the summer, and just keep the intended ones, not the volunteers <br/>
in other places, but Marty and Keith said the flowers were pretty and to let <br/>
them go.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes things in the house are the same way.  Someone starts a project and <br/>
it needs to sit, and someone adds to it.   A little grocery-store <br/>
jungle-plant assortment is growing like CRAZY in Kirby&#39;s bathroom.  It merited its own <br/>
hook and there&#39;s a bathmat to catch the drips.  I don&#39;t know what his watering <br/>
plan is or anything, but the plants seem ecstatic.<br/>
<br/>
There are housekeepers I know who would say NO to a crazy plant in a teenage <br/>
boy&#39;s bathroom, and NO to sacrificing a little rug to be a drip tray.   <br/>
Luckily for them and me too, I just won&#39;t invite them over to admire Kirby&#39;s green <br/>
thumb. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Next year we may have NO pumpkins.  But what we will have then, as now, is a <br/>
happy willingness to be surprised.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024646915">OK, <br/>
<br/>
First sorry a GN is a Games Night, we have some friends over to play<br/>
games, if you are in NC Charlotte area and interested email me off<br/>
list please for an address all are welcome, I typed my reply so fast I<br/>
didn&#39;t think much about it.  (Next one is This saturday but it is an<br/>
unusual one we are doing a LAN party (Local Area Network, making the<br/>
computers talk and playing computer games instead of our usual board<br/>
or card games.  More details avail if you need em)<br/>
<br/>
Second I will NOT trip over toys on my way to a crib in the night, so<br/>
yes some routines are neccessary.  Others make life easier, I am open<br/>
to my families ideas, but I have to live here too, and I am the one up<br/>
for midnight bathroom breaks (ok my husband shares but he doesn&#39;t want<br/>
to trip either)  I am also the one who cooks (ok DH shares somewhat) I<br/>
don&#39;t want to cook in a messy kitchen, so the routine of<br/>
table/floor/chair/handsface/kiss, keeps my kitchen from being to<br/>
terrible. after each meal.  Now as I read this (a rare event to review<br/>
what I type I talk without thinking too) it looks really bitchy and I<br/>
do not mean to come off that way.  but I don&#39;t know how to put it any<br/>
nicer.  Please don&#39;t get the impression that my house is really neat<br/>
by any means, it just has a nightly tidy up, not REally company worthy<br/>
by any means.<br/>
<br/>
Third, a garden is ment to be messy in my opinion, not that I can grow<br/>
a thing to save my life, but if I could I would prefer wandering<br/>
eclectic mixes and such, neat rows and perfect borders are a bit odd. <br/>
but hey whatever floats your boat.  And I wish I could get anything to<br/>
live in my house! (plant wise, the kids seem fine)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Much of the ideal American home involves keeping a home in the way they were <br/>
kept when people had maids, pre-Great-Depression days, and for single-family <br/>
suburbians to be prepared at any moment to serve tea, or have a photographer <br/>
in.  It&#39;s not realistic. **<br/>
<br/>
Also, few people in the past had as many possessions as we do now.  AND, having kids home during the day instead of in school for six hours tends to increase the amount of stuff on the floor.<br/>
<br/>
I figure my son gets educational benefit out of playing with his elaborate toy set ups.  Time spent putting it away and setting it back up again may be less valuable in building up brain cells.  So my motto is let the toys lie longer and watch your feet carefully when walking through the living room.<br/>

This might sting, but I mean to shake you up a bit, not to stomp on you.<br/>
<br/>
What about shifting thinking and getting the idea that maybe it is more important that your home be &quot;kid friendly&quot; and &quot;kid worthy&quot; than it be &quot;company worthy&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
Why do we tend to esteem company more than kids?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When needs are phrased that way what follows is a necessity to control<br/>
others to make sure life runs the way you want it to.<br/>
<br/>
And there can be anger and resentment when you trip over a toy in the night<br/>
because others aren&#39;t cooperating and it can feel like people don&#39;t care<br/>
about you and don&#39;t care about how they&#39;re making you suffer.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s better to let all that go because it isn&#39;t true. (Unless you&#39;re<br/>
tromping on their feelings to make sure they go through the motions of<br/>
caring about your feelings. Then it can create a cycle of &quot;You don&#39;t care<br/>
about me so I&#39;m not going to care about you either.&quot;) Your feelings *are* a<br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
The best gift we can give ourselves is to take care of our own needs. And<br/>
then when others take the time to do something thoughtful for us it&#39;s then a<br/>
welcome gift. :-)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am open to my families ideas, but I have to live here too<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And what if one of your kids said &quot;I&#39;m open to your ideas but I have to live<br/>
here too,&quot; what would it sound like they were really saying?<br/>
<br/>
Quite often it&#39;s a way of saying &quot;You get to have your way when it isn&#39;t<br/>
inconvenient for me.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Different people have different priorities and we can&#39;t just assume that<br/>
because something is important to us that it is then someone else&#39;s top<br/>
priority.<br/>
<br/>
If the kids wanted you to spend an hour every morning setting up an<br/>
elaborate lego model and they&#39;d get angry and snappish if it wasn&#39;t done<br/>
when they needed it, at what point would you start feeling resentment?<br/>
<br/>
But if they worked hard at the Lego setup each morning and sometimes asked<br/>
if you wouldn&#39;t mind holding a certain part so they could hook things<br/>
together, how would you feel?<br/>
<br/>
Picking up toys seems like a easy task to you but from kids&#39; points of view<br/>
it looks like a 1000 things and they don&#39;t know where to put them.<br/>
<br/>
Requiring others to meet your needs is putting the responsibility onto<br/>
someone else. And then anger ensues when they don&#39;t meet that imposed<br/>
responsibility.<br/>
<br/>
Make picking up your task because you&#39;re making the choice to make a clear<br/>
path for yourself (rather than choosing to step on toys). If you fully<br/>
accept that the task is yours and ask for help knowing that they may have<br/>
something of higher priority (even if it doesn&#39;t seem so to you) then their<br/>
reaction and attitude toward you will be different than if you approach them<br/>
with &quot;This is *your* responsibilty and *you* aren&#39;t doing it,&quot; (as in the<br/>
Lego example above.)<br/>
<br/>
Rethink how the toys are stored so that it&#39;s easy to pick. Rethink where<br/>
toys are kept so that toys that hurt when they&#39;re stepped on (like Legos!)<br/>
aren&#39;t played with on the path you take.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I am frequently frazzled for many reasons, clutter and mess<br/>
&gt; is only one of them.   Nothing ever works right is another, and the<br/>
&gt; constant (need to fix) desire to prove that my way of life(SAHM Home<br/>
&gt; school, etc) is the RIGHT one for me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And some of that sounds like it&#39;s spilling out on the kids, wanting them to<br/>
meet needs that you&#39;re not sure you should have.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a sad fact that it&#39;s much less work to *try* make others meet our needs<br/>
than to do the internal work of clearning out needs that don&#39;t make sense<br/>
and reorganizing our thoughts so we&#39;re thinking more clearly. It&#39;s easier to<br/>
get mad and resentful at someone because they didn&#39;t pick something up than<br/>
to rethink how things can be organized to cut down on some of the mess.<br/>
<br/>
Most (decent) parents wouldn&#39;t say that the home comes before their kids but<br/>
if you&#39;ve ever made them upset because of something around the house then at<br/>
those times it&#39;s more important that the thing be done than that the child<br/>
be happy. We tend to assume the &quot;deposits&quot; we&#39;ve made in their happiness<br/>
account will cover the &quot;withdrawals&quot; we make when we deliberately upset to<br/>
get our needs met.<br/>
<br/>
Our happiness shouldn&#39;t come at the expense of someone else&#39;s happiness. The<br/>
trick is to find ways that we can all be happy. Sometimes that means doing<br/>
some internal work to rethink the ways our thoughts are running so we can<br/>
*choose* happiness for ourselves.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-815622854">I wrote a quick angry reply but didn&#39;t have time to send, which is<br/>
good because while we ate I calmed down somewhat.<br/>
<br/>
After breakfast while we all spent less then 5 minutes cleaning up I<br/>
realized part of my problem.  It isn&#39;t just me up in the night.  In<br/>
fact I am the only member of my family that would not get up if it<br/>
weren&#39;t for my nursing daughter (wich I don&#39;t mind)  Everyone in my<br/>
family benifits.  Mt husband gets up for work while it is dark, he<br/>
doesn&#39;t want to trip, my 2 year old gets up to use the bathroom many<br/>
nights, he doesnt want to trip.  My 9 month old doesn&#39;t want mommy to<br/>
trip on the way to her.  No one likes walking on toys in the middle of<br/>
the night.  10 minutes before bed and everyone benifits. And I<br/>
mentioned I started early with my son, my family doesn&#39;t like messy<br/>
floors any more than I do, it is ok when something is being played<br/>
with but themn it needs put away.  Again 10 minutes at night everyone<br/>
benifits.<br/>
<br/>
Keeping kids in bed with you is fine for as long as it is enjoyed by<br/>
both, after all I wouldn&#39;t sleep with my husband if I didn&#39;t like it,<br/>
my daugter now squirms to much for me, plus I would like to enjoy my<br/>
husband a bit more.  So out she went, it didn&#39;t bother her much, and<br/>
she now sleeps thru the night, no crying it out or any other method<br/>
neccessary, just feed her put her in her bed.   If I could just get<br/>
her to nap consistantly All would be good.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If unschooling means I have to deal with toys to trip over and kids<br/>
who only clean when they bloody well feel like it it is not for me. <br/>
If it means I have to waste money on paint and playdough that don&#39;t<br/>
get put away (and therefore no one can play with it) it isn&#39;t for me. <br/>
If it means I have to let my kids leave the kitchen a mess after every<br/>
meal, either for me to clean or bugs to clean it isn&#39;t for me.   If it<br/>
means I have to wait until my son learns that yes he really does have<br/>
to brush his teeth to prevent cavities or worse, while paying dental<br/>
bills, it isn&#39;t for me.  If it means waiting for the head cracked open<br/>
before insisting on a bike helmet, it isn&#39;t for me.<br/>
<br/>
 If it means I have to wait for my son to learn all those things I<br/>
have been patiently and easily reminding him about all on his own I :<br/>
 A. don&#39;t have the money and<br/>
 B. don&#39;t wanna.  Life is easier without the DR visits.<br/>
<br/>
If on the other hand it is more about gently encouraging your kids to<br/>
grow without set lessons or set shcedules (ok time for science class<br/>
put down that bug and listen) than that I think would be nice, scary<br/>
but nice.<br/>
<br/>
I will be keeping my mealtime and bedtime routiines, if at some point<br/>
I find one for successfully and easily getting the laundry put away or<br/>
my desk clean I will keep it to myself.</div>

 </span></blockquote>What unschooling often means, at least as far as mindset, is being able to<br/>
think of creative solutions and ideas instead of being immediately reactive<br/>
and thrusting away new ideas automatically as &quot;not for me&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
No one here can make you leave toys all over the floor. There is no harm in<br/>
reading the suggestions and ideas posted and thinking them over for a few<br/>
days or a few weeks to see if any part of them have any merit in your life.<br/>
There is no need to post to every idea about how wasteful and wrong and<br/>
dangerous it is.<br/>
<br/>
Almost all of us grew up with coercion in the form of housekeeping, in one<br/>
form or another. We know what that&#39;s like. What folks have been trying to<br/>
give you, at no charge and at an expense of their own time and effort, is<br/>
alternatives. You don&#39;t have to take the gift, you don&#39;t have to like the<br/>
gift, but it would be more polite not to go on auto-argue. Giving myself<br/>
time to think over and percolate new concepts has in my life generally been<br/>
a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
There are more alternatives than &quot;trip over toys, waste money, leave the<br/>
kitchen a mess, get cavities, have cracked heads&quot;. There are exciting and<br/>
joyful ways to live peacefully and respectfully with children instead of<br/>
living in fear of worst-case scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
No forced chores are not, as Sandra pointed out already (maybe you missed<br/>
that part?) a &quot;requirement&quot; for unschooling. Having the ability and<br/>
willingness to seek the most kind and helpful ways to deal with each other<br/>
as a family are, in my opinion, mandatory. Thrusting away new ideas without<br/>
examining them for awhile and seeing if there&#39;s anything about them, or if<br/>
they stir anything interesting inside you, is probably a bad sign for when<br/>
you hit the actual unschooling stumbling block. A shift in willing interest<br/>
in learning on your part is a good unschooling move.<br/>
<br/>
Reading through the archives of this list can be helpful. There are other<br/>
lists that are helpful, too. Sandra has already posted a link that I hope<br/>
you&#39;ll read re: chores, and on that same site is a treasure trove of<br/>
unschooling advice.<br/>
<br/>
No harm is done by a new unschooler posting questions. No benefit is gained<br/>
by a new unschooler spending her energy publicly rejecting all suggestions<br/>
when she could be thinking things over or reading other unschooling<br/>
material.<br/>
<br/>
Pause and think. Breathe. Sleep and think some more. Read a lot. If we&#39;re<br/>
full of crap, at least you will have reached that opinion with honest and<br/>
reasoning consideration.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2045983211">You know - this is something I&#39;ve struggled with - got through the point<br/>
being discussed here - realized that if I wanted it done, it&#39;s my<br/>
responsibility and that my kids could have their own idea of what&#39;s<br/>
acceptable and what&#39;s not. Now I&#39;m at a point where I think about how they<br/>
will develop an understanding of how to react with the rest of the world in<br/>
an interdependent way without coercion. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;m<br/>
dedicated to making it work - but I&#39;m a creative thinker and think a lot<br/>
about how things happen and don&#39;t happen. I don&#39;t have aspirations for my<br/>
children to be perfect or to fit perfectly into a society that I don&#39;t<br/>
particularly think has it all right, but I do want them to possess skills<br/>
that allow them to function in most social situations. I&#39;ve compromised my<br/>
ideals on this front (of complete non-coercion) by talking with them about<br/>
common space vs. personal space. Yes - I&#39;ve probably been somewhat coercive<br/>
although I try not to be - by the very nature of having a mature and well<br/>
developed voice, there is some implicit coercion. Does anyone here have<br/>
experience truly not coercing children in any way as to the parents&#39; view of<br/>
etiquette, the world around them, their place in a communal living<br/>
situation, etc? And what were some of the trials, how were they approached<br/>
without coercion, and what was the eventual outcome?<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
My compromise at present is to tell my kids what I believe the world around<br/>
them is like and what I see as the true consequences of this or that action<br/>
in the real world. I also make my case in family meetings for instance - for<br/>
a cleaner common area so we don&#39;t have to rush around to clean when we have<br/>
company. And I do occasionally ask for help. They always just jump in when I<br/>
ask and I don&#39;t make them feel bad about it getting dirty to begin with<br/>
except those times when I say &quot;man, we are letting this place slip - maybe<br/>
we should try this or that.&quot; I try to make it about us instead of about<br/>
them. This actually seems to be working pretty well - I take them to a lot<br/>
of other people&#39;s houses and invite a good number of people here. But I do<br/>
worry that I&#39;m still being coercive. Although I&#39;m resigned to the fact that<br/>
I can&#39;t be perfect, I&#39;m always open to other ways people exist.</div>

At the calculated risk of making you angry,<br/>
you came and posted traditional kinds of advice without reading the list long <br/>
enough to understand that we all know the traditional ways, we&#39;re looking at <br/>
*different* ways, for real and valid reasons.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Out she went&quot; would sound harsh if your husband said it of you, or your <br/>
children said it of you.  Even if you didn&#39;t say it that way to your daughter <br/>
(&quot;out you go&quot;), you thought it, and wrote it, and posted it to 500 people.  That <br/>
DOES indicate something of your attitude.<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t bother her much, you say, and that could be true.  But you did put <br/>
your own comfort above hers.   I understand it to some extent, and most people <br/>
in the country understand it COMPLETELY and would support you entirely.    <br/>
Here, on this list, an attachment parenting and unschooling list, we would be <br/>
remiss if we didn&#39;t suggest that putting your children&#39;s needs first will help <br/>
with your own needs ultimately.  And considering your child&#39;s needs as separate <br/>
from your own isn&#39;t the way to a closer family relationship.<br/>
<br/>
-=-and<br/>
she now sleeps thru the night, no crying it out or any other method<br/>
neccessary, just feed her put her in her bed. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You got her to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If I could just get<br/>
her to nap consistantly All would be good.-=-<br/>
<br/>
You want to get her to sleep some more.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If unschooling means I have to deal with toys to trip over and kids<br/>
who only clean when they bloody well feel like it it is not for me. -=-<br/>
<br/>
People recommended ways for you to NOT trip over toys and for kids to clean <br/>
because they want to, but you seem unprepared to understand the advice you&#39;re <br/>
being freely offered by people who ARE happier than you are, who are NOT <br/>
tripping over toys, and whose children bloody well feel like helping them.<br/>
<br/>
If a person has no choice, she can&#39;t possibly begin to make a good choice.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If it means I have to waste. . . <br/>
If it means I have to let. . .  <br/>
If it means I have to wait. . .  <br/>
If it means waiting . . .<br/>
If it means I have to wait . . .-=-<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t have to waste or let or wait.  Keep doing what you&#39;re doing.<br/>
Nobody will come to your house to check.<br/>
<br/>
Nobody made you post, nobody made you read the responses.<br/>
Nobody made me create this list.<br/>
Nobody made anyone read or respond to your posts.<br/>
<br/>
People do things they CHOOSE to do, and they do them happily when it&#39;s their <br/>
choice.<br/>
What people are MADE to do, they learn to avoid.<br/>
<br/>
There is unschooling without attachment parenting or mindfulness. <br/>
Do what you want to do, but the more you know, the more choice you have, and <br/>
the wiser choices you can make.<br/>
<br/>
If your choices end up creating bad feelings in your family, now you know you <br/>
had an option.<br/>

situation, etc?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This isn&#39;t really a non-coercive parenting list.  Unschooling can look like <br/>
it, but it&#39;s not exactly the same entry-point to the relationship.    I would <br/>
like to say if you really want stories of non-coercion, to ask at the TCS site, <br/>
but they don&#39;t like to tell real stories of their actual children.<br/>
<br/>
While I don&#39;t force my kids to be polite, they have known since they were <br/>
tiny the advantages of courtesy, because they&#39;ve seen it in others.  When they&#39;ve <br/>
complained about the discourtesy of other kids, I&#39;ve discussed that in ways <br/>
that helped them see what they didn&#39;t like, what could have been different, <br/>
that people are just very different in their awarenesses and talents, and that <br/>
some people will always be more polite than others.  Then within that framework, <br/>
they&#39;ve made their own choices about how to be with others.  Why would they <br/>
choose to be a way they didn&#39;t like (as they are aware enough and analytical <br/>
enough to SEE the choices and the differences)?<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, Holly gave Kirby a phone message the other day and he <br/>
didn&#39;t return the call.  I found the written message and asked him, and he said <br/>
Wednesday wasn&#39;t a good day for it.  Yesterday we BOTH reminded him to call. &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 I don&#39;t think it was coercion, but Kirby might have felt coerced.   Had we <br/>
NOT reminded him to call, he and the girl both might have been sorry, as we <br/>
knew Kirby was about to leave for over three days to Denver, but she didn&#39;t know <br/>
that.   We were helping him maintain his social life in the manner to which he <br/>
has become accustomed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-by the very nature of having a mature and well<br/>
developed voice, there is some implicit coercion-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree.<br/>
Some people believe that each human comes out having the right to freedom of <br/>
self-determination. I think that&#39;s totally a political/philosophical construct <br/>
and there&#39;s no &quot;natural&quot; state except the primate state, in which there ARE <br/>
leadership roles and familial realities.  If a parent chooses to give a child <br/>
freedoms, it&#39;s because the parent had freedoms for whatever combination of <br/>
reasons, and had enough to spare.<br/>

&lt;&lt; There is no need to post to every idea about how wasteful and wrong and<br/>

And there is damage to this list (and the writer&#39;s soul and integrity) in <br/>
posting about ideas that weren&#39;t even part of the discussion.<br/>
<br/>
After I went away to make lunch for an outing, I realized I was REALLY angry <br/>
at the poster for a wildly reactive description of unschooling, and an <br/>
extremely irritating portrait of herself as too wise and right to consider the <br/>
stupidities of this [fictional] &quot;unschooling.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That does this list NO good, except in people remembering that there really <br/>
are parents who don&#39;t intend to really examine their own actions.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, I&#39;m cranky.<br/>
<br/>

in learning on your part is a good unschooling move.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.<br/>
<br/>
And one reality of participation on this list is that <br/>
*GLORIOUSLY*<br/>
*FOR WHICH YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL*<br/>
people will suggest alternatives.<br/>
<br/>
And you know what? <br/>
The alternatives are not suggested to make the mom&#39;s life more cushy.<br/>
They are suggested to make the children&#39;s unschooling lives as rich as they <br/>
can possibly be.  <br/>
And those who have striven for that goal find that after a while their own <br/>
lives are more cushy.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who doubts that is invited to read here:<br/>

<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/list">http://sandradodd.com/list</a><br/>

It&#39;s a collection of mushy feedback about other sources than this list.<br/>
And this list was designed to be a better source than those other two, and <br/>
has sometimes succeeded.<br/>

That trouncing of the straw man that what&#39;s-her-princess subjected us to was <br/>
an embarrassment.   I&#39;m not sorry about posting while I&#39;m angry.  I have to <br/>
leave for a few hours now, to go to a museum and park with another unschooling <br/>
family.  Again, I&#39;m off giving someone else an opportunity to be around lon<br/>
g-unschooled kids.  And I didn&#39;t want someone who doesn&#39;t understand unschooling <br/>

I agree with Pam.  Everyone&#39;s family, temperament, likes and dislikes,<br/>
personal history, etc. are very different.  What is going to work wonders<br/>
and be a happy, inventive solution in one household is going to be torture<br/>
in another.<br/>
<br/>
I think often times, people come to this list wanting to know what<br/>
unschooling &quot;looks like&quot; and the problem is that you can&#39;t hardly tell by<br/>
looking.  It is different in every family.<br/>
<br/>
But how you tell an unschooler is by what is underneath, was there<br/>
consensus?  Was there respect for all parties involved?  Was everyone truly<br/>
listened to?  Was everyone truly encouraged to follow their dreams?<br/>
<br/>
Not just the parents but the kids.  Are their feelings and desires valued<br/>
just as much as the parents?<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t mean that kids just do what they &quot;bloody well feel like&quot; at the<br/>
expense of others and it doesn&#39;t mean that parents lay down mandates of how<br/>
things are going to be.<br/>
<br/>
There is no magic recipe.  It is constantly looking at what you are doing,<br/>
what is going on, checking to see if when you say &quot;no&quot; or &quot;please do this&quot;<br/>
it is not some type of manipulation or false reasoning....at least in the<br/>
beginning.<br/>

<br/>
&gt; &gt; If unschooling means I have to deal with toys to trip over and kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; who only clean when they bloody well feel like it it is not for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If it means I have to waste money on paint and playdough that don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; &gt; get put away (and therefore no one can play with it) it isn&#39;t for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; If it means I have to let my kids leave the kitchen a mess after every<br/>
&gt; &gt; meal, either for me to clean or bugs to clean it isn&#39;t for me.   If it<br/>
&gt; &gt; means I have to wait until my son learns that yes he really does have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to brush his teeth to prevent cavities or worse, while paying dental<br/>
&gt; &gt; bills, it isn&#39;t for me.  If it means waiting for the head cracked open<br/>
&gt; &gt; before insisting on a bike helmet, it isn&#39;t for me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What unschooling often means, at least as far as mindset, is being able to<br/>
&gt; think of creative solutions and ideas instead of being immediately<br/>
reactive<br/>
&gt; and thrusting away new ideas automatically as &quot;not for me&quot;.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No one here can make you leave toys all over the floor. There is no harm<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; reading the suggestions and ideas posted and thinking them over for a few<br/>
&gt; days or a few weeks to see if any part of them have any merit in your<br/>
life.<br/>
&gt; There is no need to post to every idea about how wasteful and wrong and<br/>
&gt; dangerous it is.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Almost all of us grew up with coercion in the form of housekeeping, in one<br/>
&gt; form or another. We know what that&#39;s like. What folks have been trying to<br/>
&gt; give you, at no charge and at an expense of their own time and effort, is<br/>
&gt; alternatives. You don&#39;t have to take the gift, you don&#39;t have to like the<br/>
&gt; gift, but it would be more polite not to go on auto-argue. Giving myself<br/>
&gt; time to think over and percolate new concepts has in my life generally<br/>
been<br/>
&gt; a good idea.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There are more alternatives than &quot;trip over toys, waste money, leave the<br/>
&gt; kitchen a mess, get cavities, have cracked heads&quot;. There are exciting and<br/>
&gt; joyful ways to live peacefully and respectfully with children instead of<br/>
&gt; living in fear of worst-case scenarios.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No forced chores are not, as Sandra pointed out already (maybe you missed<br/>
&gt; that part?) a &quot;requirement&quot; for unschooling. Having the ability and<br/>
&gt; willingness to seek the most kind and helpful ways to deal with each other<br/>
&gt; as a family are, in my opinion, mandatory. Thrusting away new ideas<br/>
without<br/>
&gt; examining them for awhile and seeing if there&#39;s anything about them, or if<br/>
&gt; they stir anything interesting inside you, is probably a bad sign for when<br/>
&gt; you hit the actual unschooling stumbling block. A shift in willing<br/>
interest<br/>
&gt; in learning on your part is a good unschooling move.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Reading through the archives of this list can be helpful. There are other<br/>
&gt; lists that are helpful, too. Sandra has already posted a link that I hope<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ll read re: chores, and on that same site is a treasure trove of<br/>
&gt; unschooling advice.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No harm is done by a new unschooler posting questions. No benefit is<br/>
gained<br/>
&gt; by a new unschooler spending her energy publicly rejecting all suggestions<br/>
&gt; when she could be thinking things over or reading other unschooling<br/>
&gt; material.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Pause and think. Breathe. Sleep and think some more. Read a lot. If we&#39;re<br/>
&gt; full of crap, at least you will have reached that opinion with honest and<br/>
&gt; reasoning consideration.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; You know - this is something I&#39;ve struggled with - got through the point<br/>
&gt; being discussed here - realized that if I wanted it done, it&#39;s my<br/>
&gt; responsibility and that my kids could have their own idea of what&#39;s<br/>
&gt; acceptable and what&#39;s not. Now I&#39;m at a point where I think about how they<br/>
&gt; will develop an understanding of how to react with the rest of the world<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; an interdependent way without coercion. Now, don&#39;t get me wrong - I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; dedicated to making it work - but I&#39;m a creative thinker and think a lot<br/>
&gt; about how things happen and don&#39;t happen. I don&#39;t have aspirations for my<br/>
&gt; children to be perfect or to fit perfectly into a society that I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; particularly think has it all right, but I do want them to possess skills<br/>
&gt; that allow them to function in most social situations. I&#39;ve compromised my<br/>
&gt; ideals on this front (of complete non-coercion) by talking with them about<br/>
&gt; common space vs. personal space. Yes - I&#39;ve probably been somewhat<br/>
coercive<br/>
&gt; although I try not to be - by the very nature of having a mature and well<br/>
&gt; developed voice, there is some implicit coercion. Does anyone here have<br/>
&gt; experience truly not coercing children in any way as to the parents&#39; view<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; etiquette, the world around them, their place in a communal living<br/>
&gt; situation, etc? And what were some of the trials, how were they approached<br/>
&gt; without coercion, and what was the eventual outcome?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; My compromise at present is to tell my kids what I believe the world<br/>
around<br/>
&gt; them is like and what I see as the true consequences of this or that<br/>
action<br/>
&gt; in the real world. I also make my case in family meetings for instance -<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; a cleaner common area so we don&#39;t have to rush around to clean when we<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; company. And I do occasionally ask for help. They always just jump in when<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; ask and I don&#39;t make them feel bad about it getting dirty to begin with<br/>
&gt; except those times when I say &quot;man, we are letting this place slip - maybe<br/>
&gt; we should try this or that.&quot; I try to make it about us instead of about<br/>
&gt; them. This actually seems to be working pretty well - I take them to a lot<br/>
