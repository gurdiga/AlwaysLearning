<div id="ygrps-yiv-749316154">This is exactly how both Raiden and Chloe are about baths. They both resist getting in, then once they are in they resist getting out! I only wash Chloe&#39;s hair once a week, but it has always been a struggle. We have had a lot of conversations about it. If we just get it washed and braided I don&#39;t have to touch her head for a week, but if we don&#39;t I have to do it everyday. The consequence if I don&#39;t is there are more tangles and it gets caught on zippers and velcro and generally bothers her. I have offered to cut it, dread it, etc, but she wants it long and so she knows what we must do; she just doesn&#39;t like the procedure ;)<br/>

How could I make hair washing more fun? I give her  a dry washcloth to cover her eyes and ears with and I have a detachable shower head to rinse with. What have you all done to entice the bath?

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1731262204">Most of my thoughts on this have come from this list and other unschooling discussions.  My youngest is definitely a can&#39;t get her in/can&#39;t get her out kid!  It has become much easier since I stopped insisting on baths and shampoos.  I wrote a post a few days ago after she told me that she had a choice about bathing/shampooing, while her friend did not.<br/>
<br/>
  1.. At some point your child will want to bathe excessively.  Then you will be complaining about hot water usage and other family members getting a turn in the bathroom.  Enjoy that you don&#39;t have to deal with this now.<br/>
  2.. Invest in *special* soap, shampoo, etc.  Being frugal, I was always reluctant to buy the shampoos that appealed to my kids (cartoon character containers, L&#39;Oreal swim shampoo, etc).  When I finally gave in and bought what my dd wanted, she was happier to shampoo a little more often.<br/>
  3.. Vary the format.  Shower instead of bath?  Bath instead of shower?  Bath with sibling or parent?  Get in the tub with her and let her shampoo you?  Play beauty salon and shampoo in the sink?<br/>
  4.. Go swimming.<br/>
  5.. Let it be her idea to shampoo.  Bite your tongue and do not suggest it.  Sooner or later she will want to have it done.<br/>
  6.. Accept that Americans are overzealous about bathing.  How often does a child really need to take a bath/shampoo?  We tend to think of once a week as rare, but in some parts of the world that would be frequent.  (I think?)<br/>
  7.. When her hair is freshly shampooed, make nice remarks about how her hair is.  I love the way your hair smells with that new conditioner, or, your hair feels like silk when it&#39;s recently been washed, or, look how shiny it is.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You could do more braids, that last longer, then not touch hair for <br/>
longer.  Her hair doesn&#39;t need to be washed if it&#39;s braided, unless it <br/>
gets really dirty, or she swims.  I can do the girl&#39;s hair and not wash <br/>
for weeks.  I like small braids, take longer but then we go longer <br/>
between hair doing.  I&#39;m about to get her in the bath now. <br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I take a bath with her.  I have determined I&#39;m a bath magnet. All I must <br/>
do is pour a glass of wine, grab my favorite book, and run hot water <br/>
with Lavender, and before i know it I have naked children in the tub <br/>
with me and the book is on the toilet seat.  I no longer can bath with <br/>
both of them at the same time, as I used to do.  This really helps when <br/>
Janene is overloaded and crying.  That is ultimately what i did last <br/>
night, she had her Cats show (where she danced to the music to an <br/>
audience of mom) and then something happened and she had a breakdown and <br/>
I held her for a while but she cried and cried, so finally we took a <br/>
bath and within 2 minutes she was calm.  Skin to skin contact isn&#39;t just <br/>
for babies.  Then she insisted I get out so she could play. <br/>

they are half black (one side is white the other is black, they look <br/>

does not need to be washed as often as white folk hair.  2-3 weeks is <br/>
fine, unless it&#39;s down, then you wash it to help the combing process, <br/>
which really sucks. <br/>

let&#39;s just cut it.&quot;  So we did.  She was 3 1/2.  Now that she&#39;s a year older, it&#39;s <br/>
grown a bit and she still complains about the combing, but likes having <br/>
barrettes in her hair.  Her brother enjoys his hair long and rarely needs combing - <br/>

sitting up with a washcloth over their eyes.  You may have to do the finishing <br/>
touches to get all the soap out, but it is more like swimming than washing.<br/>

My kids love the bath and love the swimming pool.  I count the swimming pool <br/>
as a bath if they are getting a bit stinky.  We don&#39;t push either option.  <br/>

Good luck with the hair.  To me, it&#39;s like food.  Not a battle I&#39;m willing to <br/>
fight.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1120232421">I would totally agree with you if it weren&#39;t for the fact that again, <br/>
white hair is different than black hair.  Not combing is really not an <br/>
option, unless you are going to dred it.  Which is possible in our <br/>
house, but my girls love their lovely hair, so therefore they know it <br/>
must be, occassionally, washed, combed, and braided.  Then the braids <br/>
are kept in for as long as possible before we do it all again.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-797811427">I saw someone else suggested shampooing in the sink.  My Mom did this for me and my sister when we were kids.  Our hair was long, and it was virtually impossible for her to rinse our hair with us lying down in the bathtub.  I absolutely can&#39;t tolerate water in my ears and my sister was afraid of water in her face, so the sink was a perfect answer.  When we were younger (and too short to reach the sink leaning back from a chair) Mama would have us lie on our backs the countertop with our head over the sink.  That way she could use the sink spray to rinse, giving us clean water for rinses and quick temperature control.  By the time we were 9 or so, we had come to prefer showers, and she was relieved of shampoo duty.  <br/>
 <br/>
With her head leaning back over the sink, it guarantees no water in her face or ears, if you&#39;re careful in guiding the sprayer.  <br/>
 <br/>
Of course, if her issue is with having her hair/head handled at all -- as the situ was with my oldest son -- this may not solve the problem.  He didn&#39;t insist on long hair until he was 16, so I didn&#39;t push shampooing as a major hygiene issue.  He still prefers the finger-combed look and didn&#39;t wash his hair as often as I would have chosen, but it is his hair and still looks great most days.  He&#39;s admitted he doesn&#39;t like to comb or brush his hair, but insists on wearing it long.  Somehow he&#39;s solved that problem.<br/>

&gt; back from a chair) Mama would have us lie on our backs the countertop <br/>
&gt; with our head over the sink.  That way she could use the sink spray to <br/>
&gt; rinse, giving us clean water for rinses and quick temperature <br/>
&gt; control.  By the time we were 9 or so, we had come to prefer showers, <br/>
&gt; and she was relieved of shampoo duty. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With her head leaning back over the sink, it guarantees no water in <br/>
&gt; her face or ears, if you&#39;re careful in guiding the sprayer.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We&#39;ve done this. <br/>
<br/>
But we have a sprayer in our bath, and it works great.  My kids are not <br/>
afraid of water in their faces at all, in fact, they ask for the spray <br/>
of water in their face.  They like to drink out of the spray, and it&#39;s <br/>
the only time they get unfiltered water. <br/>
<br/>
I just finished Janene&#39;s hair.  She has four braids, with crocked parts <br/>
(on purpose crooked, cause it&#39;s easier) and we did it all in the tub, <br/>
cause it&#39;s easier to comb hair when it&#39;s really wet and has conditioner <br/>
on it.  Ticia, this is one really good trick, if you aren&#39;t doing too <br/>
many braids.<br/>

&gt; Of course, if her issue is with having her hair/head handled at all -- <br/>
&gt; as the situ was with my oldest son -- this may not solve the problem.  <br/>
&gt; He didn&#39;t insist on long hair until he was 16, so I didn&#39;t push <br/>
&gt; shampooing as a major hygiene issue.  He still prefers the <br/>
&gt; finger-combed look and didn&#39;t wash his hair as often as I would have <br/>
&gt; chosen, but it is his hair and still looks great most days.  He&#39;s <br/>
&gt; admitted he doesn&#39;t like to comb or brush his hair, but insists on <br/>
&gt; wearing it long.  Somehow he&#39;s solved that problem.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2095129671">If you have enough room on the counter in the kitchen and your child is still <br/>
kinda small, let her lie on the counter with her hair in the sink.  You could <br/>
use a sprayer, but a dipper is really soothing.   Roll a towel up for a <br/>
pillow.<br/>
<br/>
Some bathrooms are big enough for that.  Sometimes Holly has kind balanced on <br/>
the toilet seat, feet on the counter, back on the toilet, head toward the tub <br/>
for a spray rinse of something (koolaid coloring-attempt, I think we did that <br/>
that time).<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes when we go camping people will wash other people&#39;s hair.  Maybe if <br/>
you think of how you could wash it outside, you could figure some combination <br/>
of a place to lie down or lean back, and buckets or...<br/>
