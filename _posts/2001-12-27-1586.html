<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh goodness no!  No insult intended.<br/>
<br/>
I have not met any of the folks here IRL, but I have enjoyed their posts for<br/>
going on 4+ years.  I was pleasantly suprised to see a poop page link by<br/>
Joyce.<br/>
<br/>
In regards to the Saints of Unschooling, I would nominate Pam S., Pam H.,<br/>
Nancy W., Joyce F., Tuck, Sandra, Helen H., Lisa B.,  and more because I am<br/>
certain I am missing a few.  I would group the 8 I mentioned and call them<br/>
&quot;old school&quot;.  Not in any schoolish type meaning, but kinda like how the<br/>
Isley Brothers and Earth, Wind and Fire are referred to as old school.  It<br/>
is said with respect and gratitude for clearing the path for neophytes like<br/>
me.<br/>

You can&#39;t really get shards off a cooler unless you first spray it with <br/>
nitrogen, right?<br/>
Or dip it in liquid nitrogen and hit it with a (BIG cartoon) hammer?  Or have <br/>
a kid dress as King Kong, dip the cooler, climb on the stage (if you&#39;re still <br/>
at a park with a stage), ROAR, and throw it dramatically on concrete.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Okay, since you begged...  This comes right off the FlyLadyMentor&#39;s email<br/>
list, so I&#39;m giving credit right up front.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
   Wilbur and Martha were happily married for<br/>
nearly forty  years. The only friction in their marriage<br/>
was caused by the husband&#39;s habit of breaking wind<br/>
nearly every morning as he awoke.<br/>
   <br/>
   The noise would always wake up Martha and<br/>
the smell would cause her eyes to water as she would<br/>
choke and gasp for air. Nearly every morning she<br/>
would plead with him to stop ripping one in the<br/>
morning. Herman told her that he couldn&#39;t help it. She<br/>
begged him to visit a doctor to see if anything could be<br/>
done, but the husband wouldn&#39;t hear of it. He told<br/>
her that it was just a natural bodily function, and<br/>
then he would laugh in her face as she tried to wave the<br/>
fumes away with her hands. She told him that there was<br/>
nothing natural about it and if he didn&#39;t stop, he<br/>
was one day going to &quot;fart his guts out&quot;.<br/>
   <br/>
   The years went by and Martha continued to<br/>
suffer and Herman continued to ignore her warnings<br/>
about &quot;farting his guts out&quot; until one Christmas morning.<br/>
Before dawn, Martha went downstairs to prepare the<br/>
family feast. She fixed Christmas pudding, mashed<br/>
potatoes, gravy and of course a turkey. While she was<br/>
taking out the turkey&#39;s innards, a thought occurred to the<br/>
wife as to how she might solve her husband&#39;s problem. With a<br/>
devilish grin on her face, she placed the turkey guts into a bowl<br/>
and quietly walked upstairs hours before her flatulent husband would<br/>
awake.<br/>
   <br/>
   While he was still soundly asleep, she<br/>
pulled back the covers and then gently pulled back her<br/>
husband&#39;s jockey shorts. She then placed all of the turkey<br/>
guts into her husband&#39;s underwear, pulled them up,<br/>
replaced the covers and tiptoed back downstairs to<br/>
finish preparing the family meal.<br/>
   <br/>
   Several hours later she heard Herman awake<br/>
with his normal loud ass trumpeting. This was soon<br/>
followed by a blood curdling scream and the sound of<br/>
frantic footsteps as her husband ran to the upstairs bathroom.<br/>
   <br/>
   Martha could not control herself and her<br/>
eyes began to tear up as she rolled on the floor<br/>
laughing. After  years of putting up with him she had<br/>
finally gotten even.<br/>
   <br/>
   About twenty minutes later, Herman came<br/>
downstairs in his blood stained underpants with a look of<br/>
horror in his eyes. She bit her lip to keep from<br/>
laughing and she asked him what was the matter.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Honey,&quot; he said. &quot;You were right - all those years you<br/>
 warned me and I didn&#39;t listen to you&quot;.<br/>
   <br/>
   &quot;What do you mean?&quot; asked Martha.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Well you<br/>
always told me that I would end up farting my guts<br/>
out one of these days and today it finally happened.<br/>
   <br/>
   But by the grace of God and these two<br/>
fingers, I think I got &#39;em all back in.&quot;</div>
