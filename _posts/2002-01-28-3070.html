<div id="ygrps-yiv-804927334">I live in WA. state and just up the street from me is what is called <br/>
a Learning Center.  They advertise in homeschool newsletters, in <br/>
childrens book stores, and just about anywhere else homeschoolers can <br/>
be found.  They sound very appealing to new homeschooler.  When I was <br/>
new they sounded very tempting.  My daughter wanted to take a couple <br/>
of classes so we looked into it.  The *principle* was very charming <br/>
and happy to show me around the grounds and to show me all the happy <br/>
children.  Then he said I would need an intend to homeschool form <br/>
filled out and left with him, not the district but him.  I would have <br/>
to volunter 10 hours a month, but that I would have imput on the <br/>
curriculum for my daughter, because they are so concerened for her <br/>
personally....When I asked would I still be considered a homeschooler <br/>
he was quick to assure me that *Oh yes you will still have your  <br/>
homeschooling statues*....But if I want to take my daughter out for a <br/>
week because we have a trip planned that is ok....right?...*Well ummm <br/>
those things can be worked out in advance usually it is not a <br/>
problem*....So you are telling me I have to file a intend form with <br/>
you, I have to volunter, we can not come and go as we please, and my <br/>
daughter will be required to follow some curriculum that you an 300 <br/>
other parents have decided on??....But I am still a <br/>
HOMESCHOOLER? ....What?...No thank you...<br/>
<br/>
This is exactly what happened here, to me. And is still going on for <br/>
many.  In fact there was, just this school year, a big flap because <br/>
somehow the school district got a hold of a Homeschool Assoc. mailing <br/>
list and sent pamphets to everyone on the list.  It was assumed by <br/>
the Assoc. that someone from the district came in and paid dues and <br/>
got the list.  I know it is different in other states.  But for <br/>
Washington that is what AEP are about.<br/>
<br/>
Here the AEP are programs by the district to entice new homeschooler <br/>
and suck them back into the system were they (the district) have the <br/>
control. And then to tell the bold face lie that you are still a <br/>
homeschooler.<br/>
