Do you know how many adults are kidnapped and killed every year?  It happens<br/>
more to them than to kids and most people would think of adults as being<br/>
able to protect themselves.<br/>
<br/>
In reality, unless you carry a gun, know how to use it and have no qualms<br/>
about using it, you are at the mercy of anyone who truly wants to do you<br/>
harm.<br/>
<br/>
You can make yourself crazy worrying about the what-ifs or you can play the<br/>
statistics.  Your child is much, much more likely to die in a car crash or<br/>
to be killed by a family member or friend than to ever be in danger by a<br/>
stranger.<br/>
<br/>
Parent how you feel best but statistics don&#39;t back you up.<br/>

As an adult female, often on the road w/ merchandise and cash...I know the reality. I do not make myself crazy - I do indeed know how to protect myself. I have no problem doing so. I would be, in some cultures, referred to as a warrior. In some, I would be referred to as &#39;one tough bitch&#39; or a woman &#39;that takes no bull&#39; .<br/>
The stats I read said that 3 out of 4 kids would be molested (not necessarily 1st degree - penetration - but molested) by the age of 13.<br/>
I know many adults disappear. That seems to make my point  - if one can defend oneself from childhood - the proper way - then one will be able to defend oneself as an adult.<br/>
<br/>
It seems to me that self-defense - esp. in this time and place - is a necessity - not a luxury.<br/>

It&#39;s good to teach children to defend themselves, it gives them <br/>

BUT -- a 70 pound child -- or even a 90-100 pound child<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;   My 2 cents:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   It&#39;s good to teach children to defend themselves, it gives them<br/>
&gt;   higher self esteem, and an air of confidence that might discourage<br/>
&gt;   some molestors, etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   BUT -- a 70 pound child -- or even a 90-100 pound child<br/>
&gt;   doesn&#39;t have much of a chance defending themselves against a<br/>
&gt;   determined, violent person who weighs 160-250 pounds.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Let&#39;s be realistic here!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Remember the woman who was stabbed in the rest stop bathroom?<br/>
&gt;   She had taken tons of self defense courses.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Being grabbed and attacked from behind, when you&#39;re unaware, the<br/>
&gt;   person has one step ahead of you to *their* advantage.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Etc., etc.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Don&#39;t ever think that just because a child has taken self defense,<br/>
&gt;   that they can *truely* defend themselves against a very strong adult!<br/>

&gt;   &gt;   &gt; The stats I read said that 3 out of 4 kids would be molested<br/>

&gt;   of 13.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt; I know many adults disappear. That seems to make my point  - if<br/>
&gt;   one<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt; can defend oneself from childhood - the proper way - then one<br/>
&gt;   will<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt; be able to defend oneself as an adult.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt; It seems to me that self-defense - esp. in this time and place -<br/>
&gt;   is<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   &gt; a necessity - not a luxury.<br/>

&gt;   &gt;   I&#39;m hearing two seemingly opposing viewpoints from you, and I&#39;m<br/>
&gt;   confused.<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   You say that you wouldn&#39;t leave your child anywhere you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   leave a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   million bucks, and then say that children should know how to<br/>
&gt;   defend<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   themselves. If a child can defend herself, then I would think you<br/>
&gt;   would<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   be comfortable leaving her lots of places where you wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   leave a<br/>
&gt;   &gt;   million dollars - the mall, for example. Not a 2 yr old, of<br/>
&gt;   course, but a<br/>

rarely snatched off the streets by strangers intent on hurting them, and<br/>
our enormous media coverage of these events when they do happen<br/>
(especially to pretty little white girls, but that&#39;s another story) has<br/>
given everyone the mistaken impression that they are a lot more common<br/>
than they are. Most people aren&#39;t out there trying to hurt your kids - in<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Dar.<br/>
<br/>
How many children fall down wells?<br/>
<br/>
NONE, where I have lived.  Nobody I know.  But one in Italy in the <br/>
1970&#39;s (I think) and one in Texas in the 1980&#39;s, and it was carried on <br/>
INTERNATIONAL news, regular programming interrupted repeatedly, and <br/>
how many thousands of kids were prevented from playing in their back <br/>
yards those weeks because their parents were unnaturally drawn <br/>
emotionally into a situation which was exceedingly rare and far away?<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t function well when they know a LOT of heartbreaking <br/>
things.  It immobilizes some people.  It causes depression and suicide <br/>
in some people.  Yet any of us, if we wanted to, could read more <br/>
depressing &quot;news&quot; in one week than our grandmothers would have heard <br/>
in their whole lives including the flue epidemic, polio, WWI and the <br/>
Great Depression because there is so much international news that you <br/>
can destroy the last glimmer of happiness if you choose to wallow in <br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
WHY should all of us know all the details of a Mormon teen&#39;s <br/>
abduction?  Yes, it&#39;s fascinating.  But should it affect our <br/>
children&#39;s lives?  And what, they sleep tethered to their mom or dad!?<br/>
The parents threaten their lives if they get out of sight, instead of <br/>
the bad guys threatening their lives if they get out of sight.  <br/>
<br/>
If we were REALLY going to have our children&#39;s safety as our primary <br/>
goal, they should live in padded rooms, wear safety helmets and never <br/>
EVER go in an automobile, ever, under any circumstances.   They <br/>
shouldn&#39;t get in the sunshine because it can cause cancer.  They <br/>
shouldn&#39;t risk bug bites because they could be allergic and die.  No <br/>
cats; they can scratch.  No dogs, they can bite.  They might have <br/>
fleas.  <br/>
<br/>
It comes back to priorities.   Can they live in the world?  <br/>
Nobody can predict and prevent every possibility.  There are natural <br/>
disasters and diseases and things falling out of the sky.  They&#39;re not <br/>
common, but they&#39;re way more likely than stranger abduction.<br/>
<br/>
Travelling in groups, being confident, having a plan (running like <br/>
crazy isn&#39;t as good a plan as walking up to the nearest house just as <br/>
casual as though you live there, and then asking the people there if <br/>
they will let you in to call the police because a strange man is <br/>
following you.<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone know of websites or discussions about child safety and <br/>
recommendations that don&#39;t cause more trauma than they prevent?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2123428697">Hello,<br/>
Okay...let&#39;s get this straight. I am NOT afraid to go out or leave my home. Brianna goes some place  - not many- alone and she always takes a phone.<br/>
<br/>
Now, when I was 90 pounds, I successfully fought off a 6&#39; attacker. He was very large and muscular. Attack points are attack points...no matter the size.<br/>
I fight to win.<br/>
I fight dirty.<br/>
I have weapons that take attackers by surprise.<br/>
<br/>
We live our lives in a big, sometimes dangerous world.  I don&#39;t take unnecessary chances and I&#39;m well equipped to defend myself.<br/>
<br/>
OTOH - I firmly believe that Brianna should learn pool, poker, blackjack and bartending - that way she&#39;ll never go hungry.  My father was a bookie and taught us all poker and blackjack. I got my first truck that way (but the guy broke up w/ me!)<br/>
Peace,<br/>

  &gt; BUT -- a 70 pound child -- or even a 90-100 pound child<br/>
  &gt; doesn&#39;t have much of a chance defending themselves against a <br/>
  &gt; determined, violent person who weighs 160-250 pounds.<br/>
  &gt;<br/>
  If we&#39;re just talking about a physical contest, I&#39;m a 125 pound grown<br/>
  woman, so if a big guy who knew what he was doing attacked me he&#39;d<br/>
  probably win. So what should I do? Stay home in my bedroom - but wait,<br/>
  what about Polly Klaus and Elizabeth Smart - that&#39;s not completely safe<br/>
  either. There&#39;s no reasonable way to keep yourself or your child<br/>
  completely safe, and the cost for me is too high. Children are very<br/>
  rarely snatched off the streets by strangers intent on hurting them, and<br/>
  our enormous media coverage of these events when they do happen<br/>
  (especially to pretty little white girls, but that&#39;s another story) has<br/>
  given everyone the mistaken impression that they are a lot more common<br/>
  than they are. Most people aren&#39;t out there trying to hurt your kids - in<br/>
  fact, my kid seems to meet an awful lot of nice people out in the world.<br/>

I talk with my older kids, 10 and 12, about the fact that if they let people<br/>
close enough to touch them, they are trusting that person with their life.<br/>
<br/>
I also tell them to be sure to let me know where they are at all times, in<br/>
case of emergencies.  Makes them less likely to go off with friends,<br/>
strangers, uncles, older kids, etc. without my knowledge.  If the perp knows<br/>
