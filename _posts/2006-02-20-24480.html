<div id="ygrps-yiv-644509609">I have tried to post a couple of times but it seems that my posts <br/>
don&#39;t show up... hmmm... so I am trying again.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll introduce myself to the board while I am at it, since the last <br/>
intro I did, I think only went to Sandra (sorry Sandra).  My name is <br/>
Cathy, I am a SAHM in Colorado, right outside Rocky Mountain <br/>
National Park.  If any of you SCA people ever got out to the <br/>
Highlands Festival or the Wool Market, let me know! (There is always <br/>
a group at these events.)   <br/>
<br/>
I am unschooling 3 wonderful children, 1yo B, 4yo G, and 6yo B.  We <br/>
are having a great time.  I think the hardest thing for me is just <br/>
knowing what to say when other people ask me, like I am some kind of <br/>
martyr, &quot;how&#39;s it going?!?&quot;  Like it is SOOOO much work, and so <br/>
stressful, blah blah blah -- I know you all have had to answer these <br/>
questions to!  Interestingly enough I have noticed that my DS has <br/>
recently stopped telling people he is homeschooling when they ask if <br/>
he is in kindergarten or first grade, he just says kindergarten <br/>
(which I find painful since I believe kindergarten to be one of the <br/>
greatest mistakes in education).<br/>
<br/>
The best thing about unschooling, for me, is that almost every <br/>
question or concern I have can be answered or addressed by my <br/>
children.  And, if I don&#39;t ask them but I should have, they let me <br/>
know what the answer is then too!  But now that I think about it <br/>
there are so many great things about unschooling, maybe I should say <br/>
that that is just the first best thing that came to mind.<br/>
<br/>
So, I will try to send this now and see if it posts.  Hope it does <br/>
because I am looking forward to getting to know all of you, <br/>
contributing and being contributed to.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1985541637">Okay, it worked!  Did it work before but I just couldn&#39;t find my <br/>
posts?  Feeling a little silly right now -- my DS and DD have such a <br/>
short learning curve re computers, but mine?!<br/>
<br/>
Cathy, again<br/>
