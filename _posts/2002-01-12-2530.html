&lt;&lt;  I wonder about a litter box with a hole<br/>
<br/>
cut in the bottom of it strapped to the toilet seat.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They used to sell a toilet seat cap (with a hole, but with a rim the cats <br/>
could jump up on) and you put herbs in the rim, and theoretically cats could <br/>
be trained to use a toilet if you had an extra one you could leave that on.  <br/>
You&#39;d put the litter box in the same room, I think, but they might prefer the <br/>
toilet-one.  And once they got it you could take it off and they would use <br/>
any toilet.<br/>
<br/>
OKAY, it was silly for me to be telling you, so I went to Google.com and put <br/>
in &quot;toilet training cats&quot; and there&#39;s a fair bit of stuff.  <br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some, and a couple of links, and a (possibly still-going) discussion <br/>
list:<br/>

We are the exclusive distributors of this unique kit. The kit includes a <br/>
special &quot;Kitty Toilet Training Seat&quot; (after 21 days they&#39;ll share your <br/>
regular people toilet).  <br/>
<br/>
And the 60 page book that guides you step by step thru a 21 day program and <br/>
covers training mistakes, special situations, etc. Only $24.95 for the <br/>
complete kit.<br/>
<br/>
Laura says&quot;I didn&#39;t believe it either. Sure I heard stories of cats using the <br/>
toilet, but I didn&#39;t believe it was possible until we trained ours in 21 <br/>
days. <br/>
I used to hate emptying the kitty litter, lets face it, it&#39;s not that <br/>
pleasant. With this book and training toilet seat your cat can learn to use <br/>
the toilet in less than a month. &quot;<br/>

Forget what you&#39;ve heard<br/>

The Toilet Training and Cats Mailing Lists<br/>
 <br/>
Several years ago I started a mailing list about toilet training cats.  It <br/>
still goes on today but I am only involved because the list is set up in my <br/>
name.  As much as she can, BJ Jones guides the list members.  But, the list <br/>
really runs on its own.  <br/>
<br/>
The best way to join the list is to go to the list website.<br/>

There is also a list for general cat discussions.  You can join at that <br/>
list&#39;s website.<br/>

 &quot;TOILET TRAINING CATS&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Okay, here&#39;s how we trained Boots to go &quot;potty&quot; in the toilet:<br/>
<br/>
First, you move kitty&#39;s litter box into the bathroom right next to the <br/>
toilet. Take up bathroom rugs and any other things in the bathroom that might <br/>
tempt kitty to go on them (just to be safe).<br/>
<br/>
Wait til he&#39;s used to that, probably a day or two, then raise the litter box <br/>
a couple of inches by placing books or a box or whatever under it. Just be <br/>
sure it remains stable so kitty doesn&#39;t get nervous from his litter box being <br/>
shaky.<br/>
<br/>
Keep raising kitty&#39;s litter box a few inches at a time, giving him time to <br/>
get used to the move with each height increase.<br/>
<br/>
Once the bottom of the litter box is even with the toilet seat, move it over <br/>
so that it is sitting on top of the seat. If kitty seems too reluctant at <br/>
this point, you might put just half on the seat & leave half remaining on the <br/>
stack of books or whatever, as long as it remains steady.<br/>
<br/>
With the litter box sitting on the toilet seat, kitty is getting used to <br/>
having to jump onto the seat before getting into his box. Once he seems <br/>
comfortable with that, remove the litter box from the seat, raise the seat & <br/>
measure the width of the toilet bowl. <br/>
<br/>
Purchase a stainless steel/metal bowl that is the same size as you measured & <br/>
place it in the toilet bowl. (Get rid of the litter box! Yeah!!) The rim of <br/>
the metal bowl keeps it from falling into the water by resting on the rim of <br/>
the toilet bowl. Place an inch or two of litter in the metal bowl, lower the <br/>
toilet seat, & gently show kitty what is expected of him by sitting him on <br/>
the toilet seat. Try to catch him in the act to see how many legs he has in <br/>
the bowl and how many are up on the seat. The more he has on the seat, the <br/>
better. Place one back leg on either side of his front legs in a squatting <br/>
position. Be calm & gentle. Do this occasionally throughout the day. Praise <br/>
him each time he does what you want him to do. He will probably complain a <br/>
little with each step & may even urinate elsewhere. If he does, just gently <br/>
place him on the toilet again & again and keep lifting his leg out of the <br/>
bowl onto the seat, getting him used to it. Pet him & talk to him lovingly to <br/>
show this experience does not need to be traumatic for him. If you just can&#39;t <br/>
convince him to go in the bowl, you may have to bring back the litter box for <br/>
a day. Just take baby steps. Don&#39;t rush the training or kitty may feel <br/>
pressured and not cooperate as readily. (Naturally, the &quot;people&quot; in the <br/>
household will need to take the bowl out when using the toilet!) <br/>
<br/>
When he does go in the bowl, praise him, pet him, give him a snack, etc. <br/>
You&#39;ll probably be able to tell when he needs to go potty by his restlessness <br/>
and/or meowing. When you think he&#39;s telling you he needs to go, call him into <br/>
the bathroom & coax him onto the seat. Make sure all family & friends know to <br/>
keep the toilet bowl lid up & the toilet bowl seat down! Also, they must keep <br/>
the bathroom door open when not in use.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t take long for kitty to get used to going in the bowl. The next step <br/>
is decreasing the amount of litter in the bowl. If he resists as it gets too <br/>
low, add just a little & keep letting it get less until he&#39;s thrilled if he <br/>
gets just a teaspoon! Some cats have a harder time than others giving up the <br/>
digging & covering up ritual.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the hardest part  and the smelliest part, but you can probably get <br/>
through it in a day or two. Leave the bowl empty of litter. If kitty just <br/>
won&#39;t have it that way, add a sprinkle of litter, then try again for the <br/>
empty bowl. <br/>
<br/>
Once he goes in the empty bowl, the next step is putting just a little water <br/>
in the bowl. As he gets used to that, add a little more water until you have <br/>
2 to 3 inches of water in the bowl. Remember, you may have to back up a step <br/>
or two if kitty is just too uncomfortable. With Boots, this is the only time <br/>
he urinated on the floor & had a bowel movement in the soil of a large plant. <br/>
My husband put plastic around the bottom of the plant covering the dirt so <br/>
Boots couldn&#39;t get to it again. Where he urinated, we just deordorized the <br/>
spot & sprinkled a little vinegar to get rid of his scent. <br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t be long before kitty feels fairly comfortable urinating in the bowl. <br/>
However, he may take longer feeling comfortable enough to have a bowel <br/>
movement in there. It&#39;s because his squatting position for urinating is lower <br/>
to the seat & he, therefore, feels more steady. But, unless your kitty has a <br/>
problem with balance or some other problem that might keep it from working, <br/>
he&#39;ll get through this final step eventually. You might try taking the bowl <br/>
out occasionally now & sitting kitty on the seat til he gets used to the bowl <br/>
being gone. He will probably prefer a clean, flushed toilet. I know that <br/>
sounds strange, but cats are not like dogs. Cats want to hide the odor. <br/>
<br/>
It took Boots a couple of months to master this completely. He&#39;s 6 years old <br/>
& he&#39;s a big cat, so if your cat is younger and/or smaller, it may go much <br/>
more quickly. Sometimes a few weeks is all it takes!<br/>
Before you know it, kitty will be completely toilet trained!! <br/>
<br/>
Finally, here&#39;s the pictures of Boots &quot;In Action&quot;! They aren&#39;t the greatest, <br/>
but it&#39;s hard to get a good picture in a small bathroom. At least it will <br/>
give you an idea of the two positions: #1 is a lower squat, #2 is a higher <br/>
squat.<br/>
<br/>

All Done!!<br/>
