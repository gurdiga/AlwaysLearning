<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905834947">My concern has never been about college degrees (as threads often <br/>
grow to different topics).  I don&#39;t have one and I&#39;m okay with <br/>
that.  I was interested in hearing opinions about high school <br/>
diplomas to help me silent the old tapes in my head of how important <br/>
a high school diploma is.  FWIW, I don&#39;t know many people with <br/>
college degrees and can honestly say that those people are all <br/>
working in the same fields as their degrees: one in computer <br/>
software support, one in economics, and two teachers.  They are all <br/>
passionate about what they studied which is great, IMHO.  In my own <br/>
family, the only person who had a college degree was my father.  I <br/>
grew up hearing him say how important it was, but I never saw <br/>
evidence in his own life.  He died when he was only 51.  <br/>
<br/>
As for asking for proof of a high school diploma, no that has never <br/>
happened.  Yes, I will tell my children to say they have graduated <br/>
from homeschool at some point in the future.  I haven&#39;t even truly <br/>
started looking into making portfolios and stuff because my oldest <br/>
homeschooled child is only 11 years old.  The whole subject of high <br/>
school diplomas came up as my DH and I were discussing what <br/>
unschooling meant for our family.  We&#39;re not hell bent on them.  We <br/>
actually think the ones awarded in our state mean absolutely <br/>
nothing.  We do, however, want to help our children appear credible <br/>
in this world.  We don&#39;t want them compared to school dropouts.  We <br/>
haven&#39;t quit anything.  We just look at schooling differently.  :)<br/>

<br/>
I don&#39;t think people recommended saying they &quot;graduated from  <br/>
homeschool,&quot; but saying that they were homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>

The energy would be better spent helping your son BE credible, and  <br/>
confident, and whole.<br/>
<br/>
Everyone compares everyone to others.  You can&#39;t control that.   <br/>
&quot;Homeschooled&quot; looks MUCH less like high school dropout than GED  <br/>
does, so if you get clear on what your fears are, it will help you  <br/>
make decisions.<br/>
<br/>
A side comment to the discussion so far:  I don&#39;t support dishonesty,  <br/>
so for the record (as I get blamed or credited for things that come  <br/>
through this list whether I wrote them or not), I don&#39;t think  <br/>
falsification sets a good example for children.  Living a  <br/>
reactionary, fearful life isn&#39;t as good as being solidly clear and  <br/>
confident, either.   Confidence isn&#39;t easy to come by, but there is  <br/>
lots of help from hundreds of people linked here:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-460703723">In North Carolina (where we are registered), we register as a  <br/>
&quot;homeschool&quot; and have to have a name for it.  So, I guess I always  <br/>
just imagined that we create some sort of fancy diploma on the  <br/>
computer and print it out, maybe frame it in a big heavy oak frame  <br/>
and declare our kids &quot;graduated&quot;.  Why wouldn&#39;t that be as valid as a  <br/>
public high school diploma?<br/>
<br/>
You mentioned that you were afraid that at 30 he would have the same  <br/>
job options that he had at 18 and no GED.  Well, you have to take  <br/>
into account the 12 years of job experience that he would have then.   <br/>
I agree the interview skills and then job performance go way farther  <br/>
in job growth than a piece of paper.  I think that many entry level  <br/>
jobs weed out the non-GEDs because if one drops out of school, that  <br/>
may point to the fact that one isn&#39;t very reliable or dependable.   <br/>
But not often the case with homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Neither my husband of myself ever graduated from college.  I don&#39;t  <br/>
make much money since i have put most of my focus on being with my  <br/>
family since they came along.  But I do what I LOVE!  I dropped out  <br/>
of college in NC at 19 and moved to Miami on a whim and within a  <br/>
couple of weeks managed to land a job in sales (totally because of my  <br/>
awesome interview &lt;g&gt;) and then managed to make 2-3 times what those  <br/>
entry level job types could make.  My husband is a serial  <br/>
entrepreneur and has moved from company to company and owed company  <br/>
after company.  Now companies pay him a stupid amount of money to  <br/>
tell them how to better run their companies.  No one has ever asked  <br/>
either of us about a diploma.  Not even on that job in Miami at 19.   <br/>
We often joke that if one of the ventures he always seems to be on  <br/>
didn&#39;t work out, he could always get a job as a bagger at a grocery  <br/>
store and within 6 months likely be running the place.  :D  Have you  <br/>
really looked at any of the job options out there lately?  The entry  <br/>
level ones?  There is such a void of good workers out there.  Anyone  <br/>
with a tiny bit of drive, that will show up when scheduled and do  <br/>
what is required of them will quickly soar.<br/>
<br/>
If you don&#39;t want you kids to be compared to school dropouts, then  <br/>
you need to stop comparing them first yourself.  Start believing just  <br/>
because they are &quot;them&quot;, they are credible in this world.  Just like  <br/>
we can&#39;t compare our kids to schooled kids along the way, we can&#39;t  <br/>
start comparing at the end with a piece of paper.  From what I have  <br/>
read, homeschooling is growing by 15-20% a year.  So just imagine how  <br/>
many more kids and therefore how much more socially &quot;normal&quot;  <br/>
homeschooling will be in 7 years for your son.  Transcend the public  <br/>
school game.<br/>
<br/>

he&#39;d be more of a... hmmmm.... what is the word for someone who just didn&#39;t<br/>
go there? :) You can&#39;t *drop-out* of something you never *dropped-into*<br/>
:::bg:::<br/>
It&#39;s titillating for me to think of all of these kids who will be entering<br/>
the workforce, across the world, who&#39;ve never bought into &quot;school=worth&quot;<br/>
paradigm... what a revolution it will be!! :D<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know a guy who was teaching high school history. One summer, he  <br/>
decided to mow lawns, to make some extra money. Just a few - in his  <br/>
neighborhood. One of the people whose lawn he mowed, recommended him  <br/>
to the owners of the building where he had an office. They hired him.  <br/>
Then, over the next few months, other businesses nearby hired him. He  <br/>
hired some guys to work for him - bought some more equipment and a  <br/>
trailer to haul it in.<br/>
<br/>
He says he had so many clients wanting him to work for them that he  <br/>
couldn&#39;t hire workers and buy equipment fast enough. Why? He says that  <br/>
it was 100 percent because ---- he showed up. If one of his workers  <br/>
didn&#39;t show up and do a job he was supposed to do, my friend either  <br/>
did it or got someone else to do it. He checked on every job, every  <br/>
day, and made sure it got done.<br/>
<br/>
He says that other gardeners flaked out all the time - were super  <br/>
unreliable - and all he had to do to be successful was show up.<br/>
