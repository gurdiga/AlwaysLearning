<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516828825"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt; I also really enjoyed a book called Morning by Morning written by an<br/>
&gt;&gt; African-American woman named Paula Penn-Nabrit who pulled her three<br/>
&gt;&gt; boys out of a fancy private school to homeschool them. Have you heard<br/>
&gt;&gt; of it?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>**What a story that is! Definitely not an author for any families interested <br/>
in respectful aprenting much less unschoolin.We live in the same <br/>
town....about ten years ago, she and I were on a public teevee show about <br/>
homeschooling...I hadn&#39;t met her before...when she began to speak of her <br/>
attitudes towards homeschooling, I was just about speeechless. I later <br/>
recovered and had no difficulty giving the opposite answer to most of hers. <br/>
At that time, we had been living skool-free for six years already and she <br/>
was quick to tell me that our lifestyle was really not possible...for us, <br/>
not only her!  She and her dh were trying to &quot;build a better product&quot; and <br/>
didn&#39;t care in the least that her sons disliked the method. They spent a <br/>
fortune hiring college professors to teach academic subjects and spent the <br/>
entire day assigning subjects and tasks. The youngest two, twins, <br/>
volunteered at the local science museum with my ds. He felt they were very <br/>
caged and had little experience with much besides textbooks. One of them <br/>
received a full scholarship to an Ivy league college but was sent home to <br/>
grow up for another year after a multitude of problems.<br/>
