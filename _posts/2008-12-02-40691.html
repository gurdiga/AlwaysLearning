<div id="ygrps-yiv-887573003">2. Homeschooled children who grow up in a stimulating and enriched  <br/>
environment surrounded by family and friends who are generally  <br/>
interested and interesting, will learn all kinds of things and  <br/>
repeatedly surprise you with what they know. If they are supported in  <br/>
following their own passions, they will build strengths upon  <br/>
strengths and excel in their own ways whether that is academic,  <br/>
artistic, athletic, interpersonal, or whichever direction that  <br/>
particular child develops. One thing leads to another. A passion for  <br/>
playing in the dirt at six can become a passion for protecting the  <br/>
natural environment at 16 and a career as a forest ranger as an  <br/>
adult. You just never ever know where those childhood interests will  <br/>
eventually lead. Be careful not to squash them; instead, nurture them.<br/>
