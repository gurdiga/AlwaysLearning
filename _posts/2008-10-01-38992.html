<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044819377">I have a feeling someone on this list might know: do these books sound <br/>
familiar to anyone? I want to find them to read again!<br/>
<br/>
As a child, approximately 30 years ago, I read a chapter book about <br/>
kids who lived in a department store. I don&#39;t know anything more than <br/>
that but I remember *loving* the story.<br/>
<br/>
Another book was about a girl who lived in an attic. I don&#39;t think it <br/>
was as a punishment, but I remember being very interested in it.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I read mystery chapter books where you could, at the end of each <br/>
chapter, pick the next step in the story. So the story could go <br/>
multiple directions.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

<br/>
Do these sound right?<br/>
<br/>
Secrets of the Shopping Mall by Richard Peck<br/>
<br/>
Flowers in the Attic by V.C. Andrews<br/>
<br/>
Choose Your Own Adventure books<br/>
<br/>
I loved all of those!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904371672">The book that I immediately thought of is From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, the children don&#39;t live in a department store, they live in a museum. Terry Pratchett wrote a book called Truckers, which has little people living in a department store, but I don&#39;t think that was around 30 years ago. The couple of books that sprang to mind about attics are all about punishment. Oh, Heidi, I suppose she lives in a loft, I always wanted her bed to look out at the stars at night. David and I had a bedroom like that and it was fantastic in summer, but man, was it cold in winter. So we had a summer and a winter bedroom, very posh. <br/>
<br/>
There are still &quot;choose your own adventure &quot; books. Simon likes them. Hmmm, maybe I should order some more of those. If you put that into a search at Amazon.com there are a lot listed. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-488035953">I have been getting books from my childhood on paperbackswap.com  My MIL<br/>
gives me books she&#39;s done with, I read them or not, post them there, then<br/>
swap for books I want to read with my kids (or other novels I want).<br/>
<br/>
I can do the library for my own books, but kids books it just seems like if<br/>
we like the book, we want to keep it forever, so I really like paperbackswap<br/>
for this.  I&#39;ve gotten Little House books, Catwings, etc.  I also have<br/>
picked up little chapter books (Horse Club?) at garage sales.<br/>

series by Erin Hunter for years and nothing else would do (she reads  <br/>
and re-reads the books, the guides and the manga) and wasn&#39;t  <br/>
interested in any other fiction. However, she recently jumped into the  <br/>
Silverwing series by Kenneth Oppel about bats, and the Guardians of  <br/>
Ga&#39;hoole series by Kathryn Lasky about owls. She likes animals!!<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps the Dark Materials Trilogy by Philip Pullman might interest  <br/>
him? Dd has not gotten into the books as much, but enjoyed the movie  <br/>
The Golden Compass a lot. Also The Chronicles of Narnia by C.S. Lewis  <br/>
has that magic/hero/animal theme. I read them to her years ago and she  <br/>
likes the movies a lot.<br/>

&gt;&gt; speaking of books, my son is incredibly selective..he gets into one<br/>
&gt;&gt; series and hen nothing compares or is worth reading for months.  His<br/>
&gt;&gt; latest was the percy jacjson and the ilympians series and before<br/>
&gt;&gt; that the grey griffin series.  He is now reading 29 clues by one of<br/>
&gt;&gt; the authors of thiose.  Anyone else with kids with smilar taste and<br/>
