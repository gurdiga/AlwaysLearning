Do you have the Tivo box where you can tape one show (and save it so it&#39;s <br/>
not inadvertently deleted) while watching another? (not all of them can I <br/>
think, so...)<br/>
We just got our Tivo/satellite set up and while ours is supposed to be able <br/>
to do this, we can&#39;t figure out how to manage it!<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm...this is dh&#39;s territory. Here is what he explained to me...<br/>
<br/>
You have to have a dual LNB (your satellite dish needs to receive<br/>
2 signals into your tivo unit so that you can tape one and watch<br/>
the other).<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea if that makes any sense to you LOL! I know that it<br/>
does not to me. I do know that we can tape up to 2 shows at a time<br/>
while watching a 3rd already taped show. We also can start watching<br/>
a show that is still taping.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that this helps!&#39;<br/>
