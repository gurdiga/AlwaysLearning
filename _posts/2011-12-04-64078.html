<div id="ygrps-yiv-539856932">There was a message asking whether I was calling someone a killjoy.  I deleted it from the queue and would have sent the poster a message, but it didn&#39;t show up in my e-mail and I didn&#39;t take down the e-mail of the post I was returning. Sorry about that.   <br/>
<br/>
So I will say here:<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t call anyone a killjoy.<br/>
<br/>
IF someone destroys the joy of a child, then (literally) that person has been (in that situation) a killjoy (having killed some joy).<br/>
<br/>
Okay?<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s talk about the ideas presented whenever possible, and not about the people presenting the ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce wrote this, and I hope everyone will read it, and if it&#39;s new to you, read it twice:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>
<br/>

It&#39;s on this page, which might also be worth reading twice:<br/>
