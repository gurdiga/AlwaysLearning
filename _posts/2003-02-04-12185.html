&gt; I don&#39;t have to sit at a booth.  But still a little sad not to get to do that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ok, ok, I don&#39;t lurk well.  If we haven&#39;t &quot;met&quot; over on another unschooling<br/>
list, I&#39;m brenda, I&#39;m in Germany as the wife of an Army guy, and I have a 6<br/>
year old son.  I was going to say that I&#39;m unschooling him, but that seems<br/>
kinda obvious.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, $9 just sounds like a lot because it&#39;s not American dollars.  When I<br/>
came to Germany, everything sounded so expensive because it was deutsch<br/>
marks and the exchange rate was 2:1.  So a restaurant entree might be<br/>
15-30DM; it used to freak me out.<br/>
<br/>
Take the tapes, because people might want them.  Couldn&#39;t you just tell<br/>
people that you have them available and they can get them from you if they<br/>
want one?  Carry a little bag of them around to meals and stuff, or give<br/>
people your room number?  Then you don&#39;t have to sit at a booth (yuck!), but<br/>
they&#39;re still available.<br/>
