<div id="ygrps-yiv-1970811180">&lt;&lt;  Personally, I think we *do* choose our own<br/>
family, as well as attract all the &#39;positive&#39; and<br/>
&#39;negative&#39; things that happen to us. I don&#39;t mean to<br/>
say that we are necessarily responsible on a conscious<br/>
level, or that anyone should ever feel guilty for<br/>
something that happens to them.. only that we are<br/>
often creating by default, and that every situation<br/>
can change for the better.  Why is this a dangerous<br/>
idea? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Because it justifies abuse and violence.<br/>
&gt;If people have attracted the negative things that<br/>
&gt;happen to them, then not only do they not need to<br/>
&gt;feel guilty, but those who DO the things don&#39;t <br/>
&gt;need to feel guilty.<br/>
&gt;Sandra<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am of two minds on the Fate vs Will issue.  I do not<br/>
see the two as opposed.  I agree with Sandra, that<br/>
children in particular cannot be responsible<br/>
(consciously or otherwise) for choosing poor parents<br/>
or abusive and dysfunctional lives.  Children do not<br/>
have a choice, otherwise many people would NEVER get<br/>
to have any children because all those choosing souls<br/>
would avoid them.  <br/>
<br/>
By the same token though, I do believe our behavior as<br/>
more mature people hugely colors whether we are<br/>
surrounded by positivity or negativity.  We have the<br/>
power of choice, and the ability to recognize<br/>
unhealthy patterns of behavior and thought in<br/>
ourselves and take steps towards healing.  However, we<br/>
have to learn so many things first that children do<br/>
not know, such as what is unhealthy and what is<br/>
healthy, how to recognize patterns of behavior early<br/>
on in relationships, how to respond to situations in<br/>
new/positive ways, how to deal well with people, how<br/>
to heal and many other things.<br/>

The second, that we would go through that to learn how to deal with it, is <br/>
the BIG stretching assumption.<br/>
<br/>
Where does it come from?  Because the ancient purveyors of the idea of <br/>
reincarnation are the Hindus and I don&#39;t believe they have the idea that <br/>
people would choose pain, but that higher lives are marked by the lessening <br/>
of pain and suffering.<br/>

 I have the feeling that my viewpoint can only really be understood <br/>

from the way most people view things.  (I knew that it was, but I <br/>
don&#39;t think I realized HOW different until this discussion.  I tend <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1405561985">I agree with you, Tori.  In the past few years, I have come to believe that <br/>
the folks we know as humans now are just spirits visible as people for now.  <br/>
Sometimes I wish I could act out of this belief in a more positive way, but I <br/>
find myself caught in minutae and exasperation with myself and others gets in <br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
I do believe our spirits choose the path.  Either we choose to learn or to <br/>
help another spirit learn from a place where our fully developed conciousness <br/>
has way more answers than we are allowed to bring into this life.  It is hard <br/>
to hear of violence and pain and still keep this in mind.  I wish I was <br/>
better able to give cohesive voice to this belief. <br/>

compassionate each time they accidently hurt someone else physically or <br/>
emotionally, or when they are sad about something.  I don&#39;t think it needs <br/>
innate wisdom.  They&#39;ve grown from bright, thoughtful babies to bright, <br/>
thoughtful teens and big kids one breath at a time.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t induce sorrow into their lives.  I don&#39;t frustrate them so they&#39;ll <br/>
learn to deal with frustration.  If I die today, they&#39;ll look back in twenty <br/>
years and say what they learned from it, yada, yada, but that doesn&#39;t mean I <br/>
should abandon them just to see what they&#39;ll learn.<br/>

I think the choosing-one&#39;s-own-life thing is too often used as padding for <br/>
justifications for personal desires.<br/>

was God who placed the souls with the families, since He&#39;d know in advance<br/>
what would happen in their lives.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in either pre-existence or reincarnation.  My dad believes<br/>
he&#39;s a reincarnation of a priestess of Athena, buried alive on order of the<br/>
Emperor Constantine, by which explains his claustrophobia.  I think his dad<br/>
locked him in the cellar or something, but denial is a powerful force.<br/>

Is there anyone on the list who doesn&#39;t believe in the *existence* of souls?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t.   It&#39;s an interesting thought though.  My little boy loves the<br/>
idea of ghosts and spirits and hopes to see them everywhere.  I have a<br/>
friend believes someone with a strong personality can leave their psychic<br/>
energy behind in places or objects.  Is that called psychometry?  I<br/>
forget.  <br/>
I once had a rocking chair everyone thought was haunted.  I inherited it<br/>
from an old Auntie.  It was a beautiful and rather large Victorian wooden<br/>
rocker and absolutely emotionally unappealing to everyone who saw it.  <br/>
My little tabby cat would hiss at it sometimes and no one would sit in<br/>
it.  Everyone said there was something wrong with it.  I eventually sold<br/>
it on consignment in a shop and even that took some doing.  I think she<br/>
finally sold it over the Internet to some folks out of state.  <br/>
Maybe one day I&#39;ll see it on unsolved mysteries.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sure it&#39;s comforting for some to believe we have souls and can live<br/>
on, or have lived before.  I think we&#39;re here and gone and that&#39;s<br/>
comforting to me.  Too much responsibility in endless lifetimes.&lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
I haven&#39;t posted her before, but your comment about your dad piqued <br/>
my curiosity.  Does his belief that he&#39;s the Princess Athena stem <br/>
from his spiritual practice, or is he mentally ill?  When I was a <br/>
child, my father would claim he was the Ethiopian emperor, Haile <br/>
Selaissee, but I always assumed he was mentally ill, or perhaps just <br/>
influenced by alcohol.<br/>

he&#39;s a reincarnation of a priestess of Athena, buried alive on order of the<br/>
Emperor Constantine, by which explains his claustrophobia.  I think his dad<br/>
locked him in the cellar or something, but denial is a powerful force.**<br/>
<br/>
So, not a princess, but one of the temple priestesses (although I can find<br/>
only mention of male priests) of the Greek goddess Athena.  I think he read<br/>
about them in a Readers Digest civilizations book.  He may have confused the<br/>
Persian sack of Athens in 480 B.C. with the demise of *Roman* pagan worship;<br/>
Constantine was responsible for a lot of things, but not martyring<br/>
priestesses of Athena.  My dad&#39;s religion does believe in reincarnation, but<br/>
I think he was trying to find a reason for his claustrophobia that didn&#39;t<br/>
require facing repressed (real) memories.  He grew up in Kansas, where<br/>
hiding in the root cellar from tornadoes was common, and terrifying.<br/>
(Whether he was ever locked in as a punishment, we&#39;ll never know.)<br/>
<br/>
Another value in picking on Constantine was that arguing religion was a<br/>
favorite sport, and I was a recent convert to Eastern Orthodox Christianity<br/>
where Constantine is revered as a saint.  My mom had never heard the<br/>
priestess of Athena theory before :-)<br/>

&gt; existence of<br/>

awareness of Being<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
or how about those beings that LOOK like humans, but<br/>
have NO souls. (sort of like a birth defect) The<br/>
existance of such entities, by contrast, allows us to<br/>
See our own and others qualities which make us human.<br/>
One of these qualities is Spirit. or Soul. or<br/>
Connection.  We have this Oneness in common with most<br/>
of the universe....and were it is percieved as not<br/>
there, it is only perception. <br/>
<br/>
Even though lots of entities percieve themselves as<br/>
not connected (and they aren&#39;t from their viewpoint)<br/>
they are connected as part of the awareness of those<br/>
that are aware of the convoluted, interrealted,<br/>
impersonal personalness of All. Religions and<br/>
philosophies, ideas, viewpoints are only pathways to<br/>
understanding. All pathways lead to one. Even the<br/>
blackholes and whatever is in the condensed or<br/>
inverted reality within or on the other infinit inside<br/>
out dance of the stars.<br/>
<br/>
And we all die. Poof. And some aspects are reabsorbed<br/>
into the surrounding environment and some aspects<br/>
retain a cohesiveness and some aspectes retain<br/>
awareness or even an expanded awareness. And some<br/>
aspects that have no awareness and never do, except<br/>
through the inside out awarenss of the Aware aspects.<br/>
<br/>
Release from rebirth is not an escape. It is more.<br/>
Death is not escape. It is merely death. And it<br/>
doesn&#39;t really matter.  It is just fun to think about.<br/>
We still take care of the children and do the best we<br/>
can....becuase it is more fun that way.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s assuming that someone accepts those as reality and not the workings<br/>
of a complex and barely understood brain. There are mundane explanations for<br/>
weird phenomena like mass hysteria and placebo effect.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s using an untestable, unreproducible phenomenon/theory (souls, gods) to<br/>
explain other untestable, unreproducible phenomenon. People have<br/>
&quot;experienced&quot; abduction by aliens, Big Foot and the Loch Ness Monster. And<br/>
haunted chairs. ;-) That doesn&#39;t mean the phenomenon has an explanation,<br/>
though what&#39;s causing them to experience the phenomenon does. If something<br/>
can *only* be experienced in the absence of scientific measurement, then I<br/>
think it&#39;s reasonable to question whether it actually exists.<br/>

logical explanations of paranormal phenomena.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Imagination?  Hallucination?  Pretend?  Day dream?  Lying? Chemical<br/>
imbalance?  <br/>
I can think of lots of explanations. <br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who sees fairies.  Do I love her?  Sure.  Do I think<br/>
she&#39;s seeing fairies, you bet.  Do I think the fairies are real?  No.<br/>
I think she really wants to see fairies.  Her brain made the fairies.<br/>
I once read about some siblings who dug another woman&#39;s eyes out with<br/>
kitchen spoons because they thought they could see the devil in them or<br/>
some such.  Lovely. <br/>
I think there are a lot of explanations for things like ghosts, etc. <br/>
that are based in science, that the ghost experiencers simply don&#39;t<br/>
accept.  We want to believe what we see.  We rely on that every day and<br/>
if we admit maybe we can&#39;t believe our own eyes then we could be in<br/>
trouble.  But it&#39;s really true.  We can&#39;t always trust our own eyes and<br/>
our own brain.  Chemical and hormonal imbalance can cause all kinds of<br/>
interesting things.<br/>
If you&#39;ve ever known anyone with schizophrenia you know there is a<br/>
scientific explanation for it, a medical explanation, but it&#39;s still just<br/>
sooo freaky you can understand why in the old days folks thought the<br/>
victims of this disease were possessed by the devil.  Same with Epilepsy.<br/>
 And if , not admitting anything here, just, supposing,&lt;g&gt;  you ever took<br/>
LSD you would know for a real and true fact that it&#39;s possible to see and<br/>
experience ALL KINDS of things that simply are not there.  <br/>
<br/>
But, if someone wants to believe in fairies and they&#39;re not likely to<br/>
cause anyone any harm, it&#39;s ok with me.  My son believes in all kinds of<br/>
interesting things.  Is he a nut?  Probably, but I like him anyway.&lt;G&gt;<br/>
