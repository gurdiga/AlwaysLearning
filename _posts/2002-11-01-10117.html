&lt;&lt; Lying in a hospital (people, I say a BAPTIST hospital) for days while <br/>
others <br/>
 talk about unschooling JUST so that the hotel will refund the organizer the <br/>
 price of my airfare, if that ain&#39;t martyrism, what would be? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have a picture of that hospital....AND the conference site, just so I could <br/>
post the pictures here and say &quot;Where Sandra spent the conference&quot; and &quot;Where <br/>
everyone else spent the conference&quot; as captions underneath.<br/>
