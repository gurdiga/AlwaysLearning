<div id="ygrps-yiv-765998289">&lt;&lt; Bet<br/>
you love David Duchovney too huh?  He&#39;s pretty odd,<br/>
especially as Mulder.  My husband looks so much like<br/>
him the kids thought he was him on a video. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I looked to find (but failed to find) an online copy of a painting they sell <br/>
on posters and stuff at the Yorvik Viking center.  I bought a linen dish <br/>
towel of it.  It&#39;s a Viking guy reconstructed from a grave find--they <br/>
reconstructed the face from the bones.   It&#39;s exactly like my husband Keith.  <br/>
So we had it hung up for a long time, and people who knew him would come in <br/>
and say &quot;Who are those other people?&quot; (there are some miniature other people <br/>
along the bottom, or &quot;WOW!  and realize it wasn&#39;t Keith by the fact it was <br/>
from England and he&#39;d never been there.<br/>
<br/>
So my husband looks like a dead guy.<br/>
<br/>
But with all his hair cut short and his beard trimmed close, he used to look <br/>
like Glen Campbell.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if he would anymore and would just as soon not see him shorn, <br/>
and I don&#39;t know what Glen Campbell looks like now anyway.<br/>

other boys he coaches for soccer that he&#39;d shave off his beard if they won <br/>
the district cup.  They did, and then they (kids *and* their parents) all <br/>
trooped down to the barber shop to watch it come off.  Me?  I went to <br/>
town.  It had finally grown back and was looking good again when he <br/>
promised his baseball kids that he&#39;d either shave his head or dye his hair <br/>
blue if they won the provincial championships.  At least this time he left <br/>
the choice up to me, because they did win.  I went for the blue.  Very <br/>
temporary blue.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think now he realizes that the boys really want to win and don&#39;t need <br/>
those kinds of incentives.  I hope....<br/>

also like... um, blanking on his name, the rock singer from the 60s and<br/>
70s who had the long blonde hair and beard.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, he lost a bit of weight and cut his hair short, so he doesn&#39;t<br/>
look like them so much anymore. He decided his bald spot was getting too<br/>
big for long hair, I think. He looks much better now, but people actually<br/>
did used to come up to him and ask if he was Hulk Hogan.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily, Cacie is my clone, except for his eye color (slightly greener<br/>
than mine) and chin cleft (which she hates but I think is darling).<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had a full beard continuously since 1985. Every time I get a hankering<br/>
to go bare faced Jocelyn kind of gives a sigh of trepidation which gives me<br/>
pause. When I discuss the idea with Matthew (they look at my mug way more<br/>
than anyone else, including me) he says in one form or another NO WAY!  So I<br/>
settle for a very short haircut and beard trim.  When I&#39;ve mentioned this to<br/>
other bearded parents they almost always have similar stories. I wonder if<br/>
its just resisting any kind of change or messing with there sense of<br/>
identity?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-31827149">&lt;&lt; Every time I get a hankering<br/>
to go bare faced Jocelyn kind of gives a sigh of trepidation which gives me<br/>
pause. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was little and cute (damn, she still is), she sat on her daddy&#39;s <br/>
lap and felt his beard and said &quot;Take it off!&quot;  They talked about it and she <br/>
said she wanted to see what he looked like without it.  <br/>
<br/>
So he walked two blocks to an old-fashioned barber, and came back with his <br/>
face AND head shaved.   <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t the first time I&#39;d seen either, although it was the <br/>
first time I&#39;d seen both at once.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; I wonder if its just resisting any kind of change or messing with there <br/>
sense of<br/>
identity?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe both.<br/>
Also, that shaved-ness lasts only a few hours before the very uncomfortable <br/>
stubble comes.   At least beards are fairly soft.<br/>
<br/>
Long ago before kids, Keith was living in Salt Lake City, working in a <br/>
geology lab, and part of his job was to drive to well-drilling sites and pick <br/>
up core samples.  Not only did the drillers want some news about where they <br/>
were underground, but there&#39;s a map building of all the underground, and the <br/>
analysis of those cores helps.<br/>
<br/>
I knew that.  <br/>
<br/>
I knew he would have to carry a gas mask in case of on-site emergencies.<br/>
<br/>
One morning at 6:00 a.m. or so, the doorbell rang.  I was disoriented and <br/>
very sleep, and stumbled to the door wearing nothing but a t-shirt and <br/>
panties.   I was much littler then... (note for those who know me now)... BUT <br/>
anyway there is a REALLY scary guy, just looking at me.  I squinted.  He <br/>
looked at me.  I looked at his dog.  Keith&#39;s dog.  I looked at his truck.  <br/>
Keith&#39;s truck.  I looked at him again.  REALLY SCARY GUY.<br/>
<br/>
So these gas masks don&#39;t work unless you&#39;re clean-shaven.   <br/>
And he had driven 15 miles to surprise me.<br/>
<br/>
So he owned the house and all, so I let him in.  But I could hardly look at <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
At least he still had nearly waist-length hair.<br/>
<br/>
So years passed.  I was pregnant with Kirby, and Keith had finished an <br/>
engineering degree, and he didn&#39;t have a job.  He really needed a job, but <br/>
one interview at Honeywell didn&#39;t go perfectly well.  So our gay hairdresser <br/>
friend said &quot;Come over,&quot; and when we left Keith had his hair cut so that I <br/>
could see the Glen Cambell in him.  I had gotten mine cut too, so it was even <br/>
shorter, just for support and so his was longer.  I looked (just for that <br/>
evening) like something out of a soap opera--poofed and moussed on top, and <br/>
shaved behind.  We went to several friends&#39; houses, rang the doorbells and <br/>
said &quot;BOO!!&quot;and they were as scared as when I met Keith on the porch that day.<br/>
<br/>
A couple of nights later, I turned over in the bed, rearranging myself in my <br/>
sleep, and accidently touched that really short hair on the back of Keith&#39;s <br/>
head.   I woke up and jumped back and vocalized (didn&#39;t yell, but made some <br/>
grunt) and it woke him up.  I thought there was a stranger in the bed with me.<br/>
<br/>
So I have a lot of experience with &quot;IT&quot; whatever it is, Dan, though I&#39;m still <br/>
not sure how to describe &quot;it.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If Keith were a bearded actor he could play all kinds of interesting people, <br/>
but if he were a clean-faced actor he would have to play mean guys who slam <br/>
people up against walls in alleys and then hurl them into dumpsters.  That&#39;s <br/>
all.<br/>
<br/>
I watched Black Adder&#39;s Christmas last night because I&#39;d read that Robbie <br/>
Coltrane played the ghost.  I&#39;d watched it many times before, but I watched <br/>
the ghost scene twice.  Just like he did as Hagrid, he knocked the door right <br/>
down flat.  Just as he did as Hagrid, he come in all scary, but then sat down <br/>
and talked about family history and honor. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if the Harry-Potter-author lady had seen that, and pre-cast Hagrid <br/>
while writing, and THAT&#39;s why that scene went just so?<br/>

&lt;&lt; When I&#39;ve mentioned this to other bearded parents they almost always have <br/>
similar stories. I wonder if its just resisting any kind of change or messing <br/>
with there sense of<br/>
identity? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they just like the way you look ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Nah.  My mom came home once when I was about 7, her blonde hair dyed black.  <br/>
My sister and I shrieked and spent an hour in our room crying.  She undyed it.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I think it was that if my mom could change so fundamentally on the <br/>
outside, she could change inside too -- and not love me or be the person I <br/>
needed to count on.  Both my kids, when they were little, objected to <br/>
occasional nail polish.  Now, Emma wears it herself.  I think it was about <br/>
security, for us.<br/>
<br/>
My S.O. has a mustache and chin beard (it&#39;s not really a goatee since it&#39;s <br/>
rounded and covers about a third of his jawline either way - what do you call <br/>
that?) which doesn&#39;t quite reach the mustache.  I&#39;ve seen his pictures <br/>
without either -- I wouldn&#39;t want him to go there again.  He&#39;s handsome <br/>
either way, yes, but this way he looks medieval.  And, I like the difference <br/>
between us when kissing.  And yes, it&#39;s not as prickly as &quot;shaved a while <br/>
ago&quot;.<br/>

My dh has a beautiful mustache that he has had for 20 some years.  I love<br/>
it.  He has shaved it off two different times and I hated it.  I think he is<br/>
much more attractive with it (which I feel bad about but he has a thin<br/>
upper lip and the skin between his lip and nose is puffy and sticks out<br/>
and I just don&#39;t like it)!  He has grown a goatee and I am not crazy about<br/>
that either, although I would love to see a full beard someday. Dh is<br/>
dark haired and with the goatee he looks sinister and I can never tell<br/>
if he is smiling or happy.  He is a very happy go lucky person, always<br/>
upbeat and the additional facial hair of a goatee makes it hard to<br/>
see this in him. Sure wish I had a scanner hooked up its interesting<br/>
to compare the looks LOL.<br/>

that&#39;s about as old as he looked when we got married and he was clean<br/>
shaven.  I felt like I was robbing the cradle.  Of course, that was a few<br/>
years ago, so now he might be up to playing 20 year olds.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, he wasn&#39;t clean shaven *just* for our wedding, it was for some job<br/>
interview with The Man.  He ended up working for a scene shop that summer<br/>
after all, so the shaving was for naught.<br/>
<br/>

that he seems to be letting it grow....(praise Dodd and don&#39;t let the kid <br/>
