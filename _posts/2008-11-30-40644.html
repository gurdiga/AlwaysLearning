&gt; -=-Then you better not tell her the days of the week, the months of<br/>
&gt; the year or the names of the planets or constellations. &lt;g&gt; Don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; tell her the names of flowers like narcissus, dianthus or achillea. -=-<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There&#39;s a difference, though, between ancient history and the fabric<br/>
&gt; of culture and language, and recently-reconstituted &quot;ancient&quot;<br/>
&gt; religions. Christianity is certainly not additive free nor<br/>
&gt; homogenous. It might not be worth exploring with every three year<br/>
&gt; old, but it&#39;s nothing to hide from, either!<br/>
&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I had a friend, when our kids were young, who told me she never, ever wanted<br/>
to expose her children to paganism... I began ticking off all of the Xmas<br/>
traditions that were originally Pagan celebrations (evergreen trees,<br/>
popcorn/cranberry garlands, lights, mistletoe) -- even the DATE of Xmas is<br/>
near to Solstice so to include the Pagans :)<br/>
She told me to shut up -- ignorance was more comfortable than knowing the<br/>
truth about Paganism in her life. She didn&#39;t want me to touch Easter (the<br/>
word itself -- a variation of a pagan goddess [*Eostra* (Ostara)] and her<br/>
bird-turned-bunnie who laid the Spring Colors in her eggs & from whose name<br/>
we get estrogen).<br/>
When you look at things like this *without fear* those things can be<br/>
explained easily, as they&#39;ve all taken new meaning as they&#39;ve been<br/>
incorporated into modern-day Christianity.<br/>
I would be heartbreaking for a kid to grow up hearing from their parents<br/>
that Paganism is evil and dirty and then find out how deeply paganism is<br/>
rooted in our everyday traditions and vocabulary.  I don&#39;t want to be a liar<br/>
nor a hypocrite in my children&#39;s eyes.<br/>
