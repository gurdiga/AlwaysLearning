 </span></blockquote>These stories are horid. I was thinking of my wonderful creative writing<br/>
teachers in college, who did so much encouragement, to everyone.  We all<br/>
left every class thinking we were talented.   So I was thinking--it&#39;s a<br/>
good thing something like this never happened to me.<br/>
<br/>
But then I remembered. My 10th grade creative writing/English teacher,<br/>
Mrs. Sleeter (my nickname was very much rude), told me that I should<br/>
give up my dream of ever being a writer, that I would never ever get<br/>
anything published, that I just simply had no talent.<br/>
<br/>
One more reason to keep my children out of school.  Life is hard enough<br/>
without the very people who shoudl be helping you sticking their foot<br/>
out and tripping you!<br/>
