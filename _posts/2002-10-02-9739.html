<div id="ygrps-yiv-622334667">Hi --<br/>
<br/>
Aileen here -- I live in Philadelphia and subbed a couple months ago. Been lurking thus far...not much time to post<br/>
<br/>
But, speaking of TV, there is good stuff on. Our two favorites are the Wild Thornberries (Nick) and Crashbox (HBO Family). Currently, though, Crashbox is our families obsession - I highly recommend it to all. They say it&#39;s for kids 7 and up but my alsmot 5 yo loves it and can solve some of the puzzles/games. Really cool!<br/>
<br/>
It is sad that school is so glorified on most kid shows. There&#39;s even an HBO Family show called &quot;Kindergarten&quot;. It&#39;s a reality show that documents what kindergarten is like. My daughter liked it for a bit, we talked about what she saw.I pointed out that the kids could not follow their own interests, they could not speak when they wanted to, they couldn&#39;t have mom present....etc... My daughter is no longer interested. Brainwashing.....all brainwashing! I also told her that the show was not a realistic Kindergarten. The class on TV had like 10 kids to one teacher in a perfect classroom. In our PS&#39;s it more like 30 to one and the kids learn absolutely nothing.<br/>

I agree with you. I try to watch it when I can. Did you see The Little Bear<br/>
Movie? It was my son&#39;s idea to get it, I didn&#39;t think he would still be<br/>
interested in it - he is 8. When we do catch it on we watch it together.<br/>
