<div id="ygrps-yiv-1894478306">Very cool, &quot;vindication&quot; (not sure what other word to use- I have a<br/>
headache) is nice, even though you probably don&#39;t need it by now.  Whenever<br/>
my husband (or I) has doubts about the choices we have made in raising our<br/>
children we remember that we are in it for the long game, ie. we are raising<br/>
them to be capable, competent, happy adults, not obedient (or any other<br/>
adjective) children.  Along the way, we hope to have a lot of fun and joy to<br/>
share with them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-62412168">This was a timely read for me today.  Just this morning, at our local<br/>
Unitarian Unitarian Fellowship, a mom was lamenting over how she had been<br/>
nagging at her 17 year old son for **4** days to do his chores.  She ended<br/>
the story something like this:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;So, finally, I told him... Do the dishes, or pack your stuff and move<br/>
out.&quot;  (I guess he did the dishes).  And then she went on to say she hated<br/>
to say that and she doesn&#39;t want to have to always &quot;use that&quot; in order to<br/>
get him to do his chores, and then proceeded to ask that if anyone had<br/>
advice about how to raise a 17 year old teenager, she would appreciate it.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest is 12.  I wanted to tell her to start using paper plates.  And I<br/>
wanted to tell her that someday, he will move out... maybe after one of her<br/>
threats, and how would that make her feel then?  And I wanted to tell her a<br/>
whole bunch of other stuff, too, but she probably wouldn&#39;t take me as a<br/>
&#39;credible&#39; advice giver, since my children aren&#39;t teens yet.  But I do know<br/>
that I would never tell John (dh) to do his chores or move out.  And I&#39;m<br/>
guessing she&#39;d never tell her husband that, either.<br/>
<br/>
John and I had a discussion about that exchange later when we were alone.<br/>
He said something about him trying not to judge other people and a few other<br/>
things like that.  Of course, I don&#39;t want to judge other people, but if I<br/>
see someone kick a dog to the side of the road, I would think... &quot;that&#39;s not<br/>
nice&quot;.  And if I saw someone abuse a homeless person, I would think...<br/>
&quot;that&#39;s not nice&quot;.  And when I see and hear people doing and saying mean<br/>
things about teenagers (or any child, for that matter), I will always<br/>
think... &quot;that&#39;s not nice&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
And eventually, after enough of us raise that level of awareness towards<br/>
treating children and teens with dignity and respect, things will change.<br/>
<br/>
So, thank you, Sandra, for sharing that glimpse into what kind of whole<br/>
human an always cherished, respected, and honored child grows up to be.<br/>

Poor kid.  Poor family.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t &quot;raise&quot; a 17 year old.  He has 17 years of being with her, and if that&#39;s the best she&#39;s come up with, it might just be too late for them.<br/>

Thanks. <br/>
<br/>
I could tell positive stories like that nearly every day about one of my kids or another, but they would be from a mom&#39;s perspective, and people are suspicious of that.  So it&#39;s nice sometimes to be able to quote a third party.<br/>
