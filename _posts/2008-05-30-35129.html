<div id="ygrps-yiv-1393006782">I stumbled across a site chock full of fascinating pictures. She  <br/>
posts a half dozen to a dozen photos in various categories: Colorful  <br/>
Dogs, Interesting Hair Designs, Ads Using Pillows. There are links  <br/>
for further browsing and links to related posts.<br/>
<br/>
It could easily suck up hours :-)<br/>

Oh, great! Thanks.  Now nobody will post to this list or read on my  <br/>
website all weekend because that blog is way too awesome!   (I don&#39;t  <br/>
mind a bit; it&#39;s very cool and I subscribed.)<br/>
<br/>
I thought you were going to post something about the book Kluge,  <br/>
which I started reading and then left lying somewhere where a  <br/>
paperdrift covered it and I might not find it until next Spring.   <br/>
(Yeah, I better not be on Wife Swap because my paper-and-book  <br/>
geological formations are fun for dating how long they&#39;ve been there  <br/>
by the dates on the receipts or movie tickets at the bottom, but  <br/>
they&#39;re not very  photogenic.<br/>

I was working on a blog post about it here (Joyce, that was a great  <br/>
find.  Thank you)<br/>

<br/>
And my browser froze up.  Sheeesh.  Just because I had about 25  <br/>
windows open, some trying to load things...<br/>
<br/>
I do remember when browsers could have ONE window open.  And I  <br/>
remember when computers weren&#39;t hooked to anything but electricity  <br/>
and maybe a daisy-wheel printer.  So I take a deep breath and  <br/>
relaunch. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going back there now.<br/>
