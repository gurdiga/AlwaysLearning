<div id="ygrps-yiv-1845267869">Has anyone ever used the &quot;Simply Music&quot; tapes/CD  to learn how to play<br/>
the piano?  And does anyone have these and want to sell them?<br/>
<br/>
I just learned of this method from another homeshooling mom.  It sounds<br/>
like a perfect fit into our unschooling method, of allowing children to<br/>
learn to play, simply for the fun of playing!  It is based on the<br/>
premiss that everyone has a natural sense of music, from the rhythmic<br/>
way we walk and talk to our heartbeat, breathing etc.....<br/>
<br/>
Accordingly, with this approach, kids immediatlry learn to play songs<br/>
through immitation, instead of the boring traditional method  of first<br/>
learning to read music.  In the introductory video, they described their<br/>
method,  with how kids learn to talk - by first hearing and listening<br/>
then immitating what they hear.   Then, after building a reportoire of<br/>
about 30 songs from pop to blues to classical,  is learning to read<br/>
music then introduced.  ( Hey, according that&#39;s how Paul McCartney<br/>
learned to play the guitar and other instuments.  It wasn&#39;t until after<br/>
he became famous, that he then learned how to read music).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s their website.  www.simplymusic.net &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.simplymusic.net">http://www.simplymusic.net</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if anyone&#39;s had experience with this method and if its worth<br/>
our investing money into, for our daughters to learn to play the piano.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

 </span></blockquote>In reading your post, what struck me was that you didn&#39;t talk about  <br/>
the girls&#39; interest in piano. What is their interest? Do they feel  <br/>
the same way? Have they already shown an interest in piano by picking  <br/>
out lots of songs for themselves, asking people who do play to show  <br/>
them how to play simple songs, etc? Whose idea IS it that they should  <br/>
learn to play the piano?<br/>
<br/>
The &quot;method&quot; isn&#39;t as important as whether or not you are providing  <br/>
the resources for supporting their interests versus you choosing what  <br/>
and how they ought to learn something. This particular program sounds  <br/>
cool, but it may or may not interest them - only spend money on it if  <br/>
you&#39;re willing for them to not be interested. I have bought things  <br/>
like that and had them available just because I had a feeling that it  <br/>
might be of interest at some time. I loved it when that happened - I  <br/>
could pull something off a shelf and it would be just the right  <br/>
thing. But, building up an inventory of &quot;cool stuff&quot; means I also  <br/>
spent money on things that were never used.<br/>
<br/>
In my family, two of my three girls did show a lot of interest in  <br/>
piano - they played on the piano a lot and they picked out lots of  <br/>
songs and they got other people to show them songs. So I got simple  <br/>
piano books and left them on the piano for them and answered a few  <br/>
simple questions about reading music. I got a keyboard - full size  <br/>
with realistic key action and lots of fun sounds/percussion, etc., to  <br/>
play with. They played around with it a lot, over years. Then one of  <br/>
them asked for lessons and I arranged that, for a while, until she  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to go anymore. She didn&#39;t stop playing the piano, just  <br/>
tired of the lessons after just a few sessions (I think she&#39;d learned  <br/>
enough to want to do it on her own again). She played on her own for  <br/>
several more years, picking out songs, building her skills. Two of my  <br/>
three daughters took some piano lessons again in their mid/late  <br/>
teens, at the community college. Roxana is in an intermediate piano  <br/>
class now and plans to continue.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636380758">I just thought I&#39;d share, I&#39;ve played piano as long as I can remember.<br/>
<br/>
I learned because my grandmother played, she wrote numbers on a paper, and<br/>
the paper on the keys, so each key was marked with a number, then put<br/>
numbers on her sheet music (she has a book of nursery ryhmes, with the<br/>
music), for most of them, and when I came across one that didn&#39;t have the<br/>
music marked with numbers I asked her to do it for me.<br/>
<br/>
  Eventually I figured out how the notes on the sheet music were connected<br/>
to the numbers, and I remember one night figuring out how to read music,<br/>
becuase I had seen it so much.<br/>
<br/>
  I&#39;m not saying that that is THE WAY to learn music/how to play piano, but<br/>
it worked for me.  I currently play at the college level...<br/>

Pam,<br/>
<br/>
My girls are 6 1/2 and 8 1/2.  For years, both have shown lots of<br/>
interest in wanting  to learn to play the piano.  We&#39;ve had several of<br/>
those  kids keyboards around the house for years and they are always<br/>
playing on them.  They&#39;ve given concerts for us and friends, using their<br/>
keyboards and kids megaphones that goes with one of the keyboards.  And<br/>
the songs they play have always been songs they&#39;ve learned by<br/>
themselves.  They&#39;ve always loved playing on my brother&#39;s piano since<br/>
they were little,  whenever they go ever.  Yes, my kids definately have<br/>
shown interest in wanting to play!<br/>
<br/>
Also, my 8 year old really enjoyed learning to play the guitar from a<br/>
college student when she was just turning 5, for about 4 months.  She<br/>
actually was  reading music and playing several songs.  She even asked<br/>
if she could give a Thanksgiving recital for all my family when she was<br/>
5.  Unfortuanately, the college student left, after only 4 months with<br/>
my daughter.  We did check into finding another teacher through a local<br/>
music studio, but they felt 5 was too young  and  unfortunately we<br/>
didn&#39;t pursue it any further.<br/>
<br/>
And, my youngest, at 4 1/2 sang her heart out at the St. Louis L & L<br/>
talent show.  Her songs and jokes were all chosen by her, and when she<br/>
got up on stage, I don&#39;t think she even knew exactly what she was going<br/>
to do or say.  And now, at 6 1/2,  she says she wants to be in a band!<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, we actually bought a used piano at Christmas time.  The girls<br/>
have been playing on it every since, and have taught themsevles lots of<br/>
simply kids songs - like &quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot; and &quot;Are you<br/>
sleeping&quot;.  Shortly after we got it, they taught themselves how to play<br/>
&quot;Happy Birthday&quot;  when we had our neighbor over for her  79th birthday. <br/>
I  have never once even prodded them to play,  yet they probably play on<br/>
it 2-3 times a week.  One day they even taught themselve how to play,<br/>
&quot;Here Comes the Bride&quot; while playing dress-up or something that involved<br/>
a wedding.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve just been hesitant in signing them up for lessons.  I&#39;ve been<br/>
afraid the traditional piano lessons with teachers who all expect their<br/>
students to  practice so many hours a week, and playing the usual boring<br/>
songs in beginner&#39;s books, would just zap their fun and interest in<br/>
wanting to play.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I didn&#39;t explain why I was asking about the &quot;Simply Music&quot;.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t really think I had to write a long e-mail to justify why I was<br/>
asking.  Being an unschooler, I just assumed that other&#39;s would assume<br/>
the interest was from my children, not  something I was forcing upon<br/>
them.  If anything, I actually feel somewhat guilty for not having <br/>
bought a piano earlier, when they first began to show interest, or<br/>
further pursuing their interest in the guitar.<br/>
<br/>
So, my question is simply, are traditional piano lessons or using a<br/>
non-traditional approach ( as the simply Music), a good match for<br/>
children who already show interest in wanting to learn to play the<br/>
piano?  Especially, for children as young as 6 ond 8.  My kids have<br/>
shown an interest in the piano and other instruments for years.  I &#39;d<br/>
just hate to suddenly zap it becuase of the wrong type of lessons.  And,<br/>
I figured several on this list have had experience with their kids<br/>
learning to play the piano and was hoping to hear their first hand<br/>
experiences and advise.<br/>

Well you don&#39;t have to write anything, but people come and go on the  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Good question. I thought about the same stuff for years, because my  <br/>
kids have also always been very interested in music. And, yes, too- <br/>
early formal lessons DID kill their initial interest in certain  <br/>
instruments and I&#39;m extremely sorry to not have protected them more.  <br/>
So, yeah, worth worrying over. When they ever wanted any kind of  <br/>
music lessons, after that, I was really clear with the teacher that  <br/>
we were not going to be enforcing practice time and that the point  <br/>
was for them to have a good time, not to be scolded or pressured.<br/>
<br/>
So - to your real question. The program sounds pretty fun and, if it  <br/>
was me with my kids, I might buy it, depending on the cost. I  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t introduce it to them as a replacement for lessons, but just  <br/>
something cool and fun that they might enjoy. I would treat it no  <br/>
differently than if you bought a movie or a game or a new piece of  <br/>
play equipment or a toy for them. As I said before, be prepared for  <br/>
the possibility that it may not, in fact, appeal to them. If that  <br/>
happens, don&#39;t push it. Put it away - maybe it&#39;ll appeal later,  <br/>
probably not.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen this happen though -- kids show an interest in something,  <br/>
let&#39;s say it is gymnastics. The child jumps and hops and learns to do  <br/>
great forward and backward rolls and cartwheels and round-offs and  <br/>
hand-stands and climbs like a monkey and so on. Obviously REALLY  <br/>
enjoys the physical activity and demonstrates some level of talent.  <br/>
People say to the parent, &quot;You should get him/her into gymnastics.&quot;  <br/>
Mom asks child, &quot;Hey, want to go sign up for gymnastics?&quot; They go  <br/>
have a look at the apparatus looks heavenly to the child - huge  <br/>
trampolines, bars to swing from, and on and on. Wow! So the kid signs  <br/>
up, has talent, learns and moves up. Pretty soon there is pressure to  <br/>
come to practices more and more often, more and more hours are  <br/>
expected. The sessions become less and less fun and more and more  <br/>
like work. The child eventually just totally quits and never does any  <br/>
gymnastics again. This is the USUAL situation for young people who  <br/>
are extremely proficient in a sport, by the way. Most do not continue  <br/>
enjoying it into adulthood, it becomes associated with work and  <br/>
worry, not with fun.<br/>
<br/>
Would have been better if Mom would have responded by saying, &quot;Yeah,  <br/>
he is really enjoying gymnastics right now, in his own way.&quot; And let  <br/>
it go, for then, rather than thinking the kid needed to get into some  <br/>
more formal gymnastics program.  I mean, unless the parent has goals  <br/>
for the child to compete at some high level, then it would be better  <br/>
to just notice the child IS doing gymnastics and enjoying it. Why  <br/>
interfere with that?<br/>
<br/>
So - we&#39;re talking about some very young children who are really into  <br/>
music, not a parent pushing a child into competitive sports, right  <br/>
&lt;G&gt;? I know, there is a big difference. But there is still a warning  <br/>
there. I&#39;ve seen the exact same thing happen with youth theater and  <br/>
with musical instruments. So, your concern is well founded, imo.<br/>
<br/>
You might ask yourself whether or not they need anything more right  <br/>
now than access to musical instruments, exposure to lots of music,  <br/>
maybe access to some musically-inclined friends to show them a few  <br/>
things once in a while. Maybe, if they are very interested, they&#39;d  <br/>
like some low-key and relatively casual ongoing lessons from someone  <br/>
who will have fun with them. I&#39;m just worried that the purchase of  <br/>
some kind of program to follow will make it seem, to them, like what  <br/>
they were doing wasn&#39;t worthwhile. It would be totally okay for them  <br/>
to &quot;just&quot; play around on the piano for years, if that was fun for  <br/>
them, right? Just keep in mind that if they ARE playing the piano and  <br/>
are happy with how things are going, you could mess that up for them  <br/>
by acting like it isn&#39;t good enough without some kind of instruction  <br/>
(no matter how cool the method seems). So - that&#39;s the warning.<br/>

I agree with you. It can be a real burdon to read really long e-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838984991">Wanted to share our experiences with music and music lessons.  Both my  kids <br/>
and I took some piano lessons when we were about 7, 10 and 47.  A  traditional <br/>
approach although I didn&#39;t really say much about practicing.   Our teacher <br/>
was my sister who lived next door which was convenient.  My son  took lessons <br/>
for about a year, my daughter about 3 years and I made it through  one book <br/>
which took me about a year.  <br/>
 <br/>
It seemed we each just stopped having a strong interest in the weekly  <br/>
lessons and moved on to other things.  My son took guitar lessons for a few  weeks <br/>
but just didn&#39;t enjoy it at all at that age. My daughter got into singing  and <br/>
loved everything about it and has continued with that for years. She started  <br/>
guitar lessons a couple of years ago. My son recently started some drum  <br/>
lessons.<br/>
 <br/>
So now, the kids are 14 and 17 and I&#39;m older also...&lt;g&gt;  Music  just <br/>
continued to be a big part of our lives and we now have a piano, 4 guitars  and a drum <br/>
set.  For a while, my son also played an ocarina and a  harmonica.  Both kids <br/>
love playing music and most all they play now is from  hearing something they <br/>
like and looking up the music online and then playing  it.  During part of <br/>
every day, our house has some singing, guitar playing  and drumming going on.  <br/>
Sometimes the kids just jam together and it&#39;s very  cool.<br/>
 <br/>
I think just having the instruments around was the biggest thing and I  never <br/>
said anything about times when none of them were being played. The piano  <br/>
lessons were a good foundation for an introduction to reading music and the  <br/>
basics and I have no idea if they would have developed their interests if we  <br/>
hadn&#39;t taken the lessons.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m the one who has the most difficulty with pursuing my interest in  playing <br/>
the guitar right now.  However, that&#39;s a completely different post  and one <br/>
more about my difficulty with following my passions than  anything about <br/>
lessons.<br/>
 <br/>
Even when no one was playing the instruments, I liked having them  around.   <br/>
I love the piano  and the guitars.  It&#39;s amazing  how many people will just <br/>
sit down and play something when they are here.   I&#39;m still getting used to the <br/>
drums.  I&#39;m thinking I might like to move  them away from the kitchen...&lt;g&gt;<br/>

like some low-key and relatively casual ongoing lessons from someone <br/>
who will have fun with them. I&#39;m just worried that the purchase of  some<br/>
kind of program to follow will make it seem, to them, like what  they<br/>
were doing wasn&#39;t worthwhile. It would be totally okay for them  to<br/>
&quot;just&quot; play around on the piano for years, if that was fun for  them,<br/>
right? Just keep in mind that if they ARE playing the piano and  are<br/>
happy with how things are going, you could mess that up for them  by<br/>
acting like it isn&#39;t good enough without some kind of instruction  (no<br/>
matter how cool the method seems). So - that&#39;s the warning.<br/>

Pam,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all your advise and concerns/warnings.<br/>
<br/>
Those are all the same concerns  and fears I have.<br/>
<br/>
My 8 year old is especially intersted in wanting to take lessons.  She&#39;s<br/>
been &quot;goofing&quot; on the piano for years now, and is definately ready  and<br/>
wanting to do more.  She keeps asking when can she start taking lessons.<br/>
<br/>
She watched the &quot;Simply Music&quot; introductory video with me and was really<br/>
interested in wanting to learn this way.  She understands our<br/>
unschooling approach and knows she&#39;s not obligated to ever practice or<br/>
continue, if she doesn&#39;t want to.<br/>
<br/>
I too, thought this appraoch sounded like fun.  I agree, it should not<br/>
to be a replacement for real lessons, if her interests continue and that<br/>
what she wants down the road.  I did find on their website that they<br/>
have their own certified teachers , with 1 being just 30 minutes away. <br/>
Unfortunately, she&#39;s not teaching at this time due to some personal<br/>
reasons, but hopes to be teaching again, by the end of the year.  So,<br/>
hopefully, we have the option, that if we go with this approach, we can<br/>
eventually continue with this style of learning, with a real teacher.<br/>
<br/>
I like your idea of introducing it, or any lessons,  fairly low key,<br/>
with no expectations other than for them to continue to have fun.  I<br/>
wish I did know of someone who played the piano and would just do some<br/>
casual, fun playing with her, to see if this sparks any further interest<br/>
of learning to play.  Unfortunatley, I&#39;ve  only heard of really<br/>
structured teachers in our small town.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again, Pam,  for all your advise.<br/>
<br/>
And, if anyone has any experience using the  &quot;SimplyMusic &quot; appraoch or<br/>
any other non-traditional approaches,  please share your experiences and<br/>
advise.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>

This list isn&#39;t for practical advice, though. It&#39;s for talking about  <br/>

Details that make it clear to all readers that the person writing  <br/>

If this approach and this style of learning needs &quot;a real teacher,&quot;  <br/>

If the mom is glad to have &quot;a real teacher,&quot; maybe it&#39;s not such an  <br/>
alternative approach.<br/>

<br/>
I had asked a similiar question last year.  Below is my question ( post<br/>
#28376). We ended up buying the &quot;Simply Music &quot;DVD&#39;s ( explained below)<br/>
and my kids and I instantly began playing  songs.  The DVD does teach<br/>
one how to properly position your hands,  play chords, etc...   without<br/>
all the boring repititious learning of scales and notes,  until one has<br/>
learned about a 30 song repretoir.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve never prodded my kids to play.  They periodically will just begin<br/>
playing on their own, which unfortunately can be a good month or more<br/>
between playing.  But, ironically just yesterday evening my 9 year<br/>
started playing the piano on her own, of songs she had learned from the<br/>
DVD.  It was so nice to listen to her plaing while I was cleaning up<br/>
after dinner.<br/>
<br/>
I would definitely recommend these DVD&#39;s!<br/>

<br/>
Has anyone ever used the &quot;Simply Music&quot; tapes/CD to learn how to play <br/>
the piano? And does anyone have these and want to sell them?<br/>
<br/>
I just learned of this method from another homeshooling mom. It sounds <br/>
like a perfect fit into our unschooling method, of allowing children to <br/>
learn to play, simply for the fun of playing! It is based on the <br/>
premiss that everyone has a natural sense of music, from the rhythmic <br/>
way we walk and talk to our heartbeat, breathing etc.....<br/>
<br/>
Accordingly, with this approach, kids immediatlry learn to play songs <br/>
through immitation,  instead of the boring traditional method of first <br/>
learning to read music. In the introductory video, they described their <br/>
method, with how kids learn to talk - by first hearing and listening<br/>
then immitating what they hear. Then, after building a reportoire of <br/>
about 30 songs from pop to blues to classical, is learning to read <br/>
music then introduced.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s their website. www.simplymusic.net <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.simplymusic.net">http://www.simplymusic.net</a><br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.simplymusic.net">http://www.simplymusic.net</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if anyone&#39;s had experience with this method and if its worth<br/>
our investing money into, for our daughters to learn to play the piano.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
