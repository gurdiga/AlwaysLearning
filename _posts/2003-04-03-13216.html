&lt;&lt; So for a change I observed in silent amusement.  It was like watching a <br/>
very <br/>
 slow-motion flower-cart wreck in the set for the marketplace  of the recent <br/>
 Disney version of Roger&#39;s and Hammerstein Cinderella.  All cartoon-colorful <br/>
 and fantasy-worldly, with no soundtrack.  Flowers fly up and the picture <br/>
 freezes without it even mattering where they fall or what happens next. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, that is a GREAT visual.<br/>
I was laughing out loud just picturing the conservative folks reaction!! <br/>
Thanks Sandra.<br/>

&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers are <br/>
growing--the roots are stirring.  That is the magic.  Being alive is the <br/>
magic--being strong is the magic  The magic is in me--the magic is in <br/>
me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;<br/>

I should say, Ren, that your sigline quote is very musical in my head.  I <br/>
glance at it and first my head starts playing <br/>
&quot;The sun is shining and the grass is green,<br/>
Under the three feet of show I mean...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and then (every time) I glance on down and the song changes to  Whitney <br/>
Houston as the fairy godmother singing <br/>
<br/>
&quot;...there is music in you!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[&quot;The sun is shining--the sun is shining.  That is the magic.  The flowers <br/>

me....It&#39;s in every one of us.&quot;]<br/>
<br/>
My bread machine plays &#39;Scotland the Brave.&#39;   Only the rhythm, but it&#39;s <br/>
sufficient for my head to supply the rest.<br/>

<br/>
You know, I had meant to change it a while back, but it just wouldn&#39;t let me!<br/>
It&#39;s musical in a rhythmic way in my head and it just seems to be everything <br/>
I could ever want in a sig line.<br/>
Plus, I love The Secret Garden, which it is from.<br/>
It chose me....so it&#39;s staying for now.<br/>
