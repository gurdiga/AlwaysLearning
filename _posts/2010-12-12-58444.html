<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188029048">I can make this international and useful, I think.  Partly I&#39;m looking for one person, name forgotten, in Alabama.  Sorry to use the list for this, but if I can get that contact restored, more people can meet other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
In various cross-pollinating ways, I&#39;m helping unschoolers meet other unschoolers.  Even in India, some people met who wouldn&#39;t have if I hadn&#39;t been there, and that was fun for me and useful for them.<br/>
<br/>
My plans for the next several months aren&#39;t crystal clear yet, but there are some solidifying details.  I will be meeting with and hanging out with unschoolers in these places, and details (times and dates) will be listed at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com">http://aboutunschooling.blogspot.com</a> as they&#39;re more definite:<br/>
<br/>
January 2011: ALBUQUERQUE!  My house, January.<br/>
Julie Daniel&#39;s family, Robin Bentley, and several local families are the only ones I know of for sure.  Any others?<br/>
If you&#39;re planning to be in Albuquerque January 7-10, 2011, please come over!<br/>
<br/>
February 2011:  <br/>
10 Halfmoon, NY<br/>
12 Bryn Athyn, PA (that one&#39;s a marriage conference, not unschooling)<br/>
13 Bryn Athyn, PA (unschooling)<br/>
15-17  other Pennsylvania and NJ, being determined this week, but tentatively:  Quakertown, Chadd&#39;s Ford, Philadelphia and Princeton<br/>
18 or 19, NYC (not speaking, just visiting)<br/>
21, 22, CT/NY (still being planned)<br/>
<br/>
March 2011: <br/>
4-6 Atlanta, GA    [AND SOMEONE (someone I hope will write to me again) wrote about me coming to Alabama afterwards***]<br/>
24-26 St. Charles, IL  (Holly will be there, too.)<br/>
<br/>
              ***I had a hard drive die on me, and much saved mail poofed away; *sorry!****<br/>
<br/>
June/July 2011, UK/France <br/>
London (maybe a small conference)<br/>
Edinburgh (maybe not in this order)<br/>
Londonderry, Northern Ireland<br/>
Baud, Bretagne, France (others who want to visit my friend Helene... she has room for people to stay or camp)<br/>
some other to-be-determined visits in the UK; I&#39;ve also lost some of those contacts.  :-/<br/>
<br/>
September 2011:<br/>
8-11  San Diego  (Good Vibrations Conference; Holly will be there too)<br/>
<br/>
Anyone here who has not yet met other unschooling families, please consider using me as an excuse if you need to, to get to one of these places if they&#39;re near you, or if these are crazy-far from you, find something nearer, and meet some others.  They don&#39;t need to become your best friends for life or anything, but knowing others in person will help you be more confident and less afraid (if you&#39;re afraid).  And if you&#39;re not afraid, and you ARE confident, maybe some other unschoolers could benefit from hanging out with you some!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1304501346">hi sandra,<br/>
my husband just suggested inviting u to our home when u come to the uk.  i am happy to do this but am afraid i will fall far short of the great unschooling examples i read about here :-).  if u can stand a bit of imperfection then u r more than welcome to make a pit stop in nottingham where i am sure i can gather some unschoolers/autonomous educators who would benefit from a get togther......and of course it would be an honour to have u.<br/>
my husband will cook while we chat :-)<br/>

<br/>
I love imperfection, and unschoolers, and chatting, and husbands who cook. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Having unschoolers visit here has always been interesting, and I&#39;m having some next month, which makes me self-conscious about the house, and my cooking, and how the weather will be.   Things I can&#39;t even control (the weather mostly...). :-)<br/>
<br/>
But when people get here, we talk and play games and eat, and the state of the corners and the dust on the bookshelves has never sent anyone away prematurely.  And seriously, if someone came and said &quot;I cannot possibly sit and talk and play games with you, because I can see some dust bunnies from here,&quot; then that would mean they didn&#39;t care about what I care about, or that I wasn&#39;t interesting enough for them.   If I spent a lot of time cleaning and people came over to talk and play games, they probably wouldn&#39;t take time to look around and think, &quot;How clean this house is!  I am very impressed.&quot;   [Unless they knew me well, and might notice it was exceptionally clean, for a Sandra house.]<br/>
<br/>
In a way, it&#39;s a service to others who visit, to go home and feel wonderfully good about their own organization and housekeeping after they&#39;ve visited me!  I don&#39;t mind doing that favor for people.<br/>
<br/>
