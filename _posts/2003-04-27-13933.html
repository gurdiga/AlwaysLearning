<div id="ygrps-yiv-725679591">A few days ago we had a big adventure.  Lisa wanted to walk to a nearby gas station.  Part of the trek is along a not too heavily traveled road, but with a 50 mph speed limit and no shoulder.  She had been begging to do this, so we decided to go and have pizza for lunch there from the little deli.  Another customer asked why the girls weren&#39;t in school, and I said we homeschool.  The woman at the deli said she is thinking about homeschooling her 14 year old because the schools are failing him.<br/>
<br/>
On the way home, we got on the topic of reproduction via eggs.  I&#39;ve been wanting to own a few chickens, but not a rooster.  The kids thought we wouldn&#39;t be able to get chickens from the eggs without roosters.  I explained that the chickens still lay eggs, but the eggs won&#39;t be able to grow into chicks.  During the conversation I mentioned that I make an egg every month.  The look on 7 yo Jackie&#39;s face was hilarious.  I could see her imagining me laying an egg, like a chicken!  Fortunately, we were able to discuss it a bit more and clear that up for her.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2044921235">This reminds me of just after I had my  4th dd and my 3rd dd, who was at <br/>
the birth, was 2.  A friennd came by to see the baby and Soleille talked <br/>
to her nonstop.  Paula, my friend has a daughter who&#39;s 11.  Soleille <br/>
asked Paula if she had any babies.  Paula said, &quot;Yes, Anna&#39;s my baby.&quot; <br/>
 Soleille&#39;s eyes got very round and we could just imagine the picture in <br/>
her head of lean, lanky 11 yr old Anna in Paula&#39;s stomach and coming <br/>
out.  Had to do a lot of explaining with that one!  <br/>
<br/>
I had the egg talk with my two older dd&#39;s while I was pregnant for 4th. <br/>
 They were 6 and 4.   We had to keep going back to the part of  &quot;and HOW <br/>
did Daddy get the sperm in there???&quot;  <br/>
