<div id="ygrps-yiv-425442944">He is SO perfectly Jalen (though he changed his name to Scott recently<br/>
and I&#39;m still trying to adapt to that one!).<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
On a lighter note my son MD (Marvin Daniel) has informed me his name is now<br/>
Flamerider64 or Flamerider for short. So no to call him MD, Mario or Buzz (another nickname).<br/>
He is also introducing himself as Flamerider64.<br/>
You should see the faces of other parents. Priceless!<br/>
And Ren I just love to read stories of Scott!<br/>

He does say the dangdest things at times!:) I guess it&#39;s easier to say<br/>
&quot;my sweet Scottie boy&quot; than &quot;my sweet Jalen boy&quot;. lol<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying to adapt to the new name without confusing anyone. No, I<br/>
haven&#39;t adopted a kid or had another baby....but I do have a Scott now.<br/>

Um yeah...probably.;)  I&#39;m having a hard time switching over so he<br/>
gets kinda irritated with me. We talked about it last night and I<br/>
explained that it was hard because I really LOVE the name Jalen. He<br/>
said &quot;yeah, you must love it a LOT&quot; then &quot;who picked my name?&quot; which<br/>
entailed a discussion about dh and I choosing together.<br/>
<br/>
He explained how much he loves the name Scott. It was sweet.<br/>
