Nope. Maryland has very *nosy* laws. Portfolio reviews at least 2 times a<br/>
year teaching 5 subjects and teaching methods, written work and progress<br/>
subject to review by a teacher. They can be gotten around (the laws) but it<br/>
takes a very strong person to put up with thier BS (or a strict school at<br/>
homer) I think it is extremely stressful to unschool in this state. West<br/>
virginia has a similar process with the reviews but I believe they can go to<br/>
your house and &quot;observe instruction&quot; and I think they also test. MD is much<br/>
better that it used to be mmany years ago, thanks to The Maryland Home<br/>
Education Association and no thanks to H$LDA.<br/>
I can&#39;t wait to move to New Mexico!<br/>

&gt;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m right, I just don&#39;t know that I&#39;m wrong yet. ;) Oh, and<br/>
&gt;I didn&#39;t mean just homeschooling laws with California, I meant law-laws in<br/>
&gt;general -- we have regulations to cover our regulations here. I&#39;m pretty<br/>
&gt;sure it&#39;s still legal to breathe, but who can keep up enough to be sure?<br/>

&gt;California isn&#39;t trussed up at all compared to places like<br/>
&gt;Massachussetts, where homeschooling is specifically NOT private education<br/>
&gt;and<br/>
&gt;conducted at the whim of local school boards, or Pennsylvania, or or or...<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Looking closely at the laws and not laws, I tend to agree with Sandra, it&#39;s<br/>
&gt;about where lawmakers have been settled the longest. In general. :)<br/>

We do have an option to join an umbrella school and most are very<br/>
understanding of unschooling.  This past &quot;school year&quot; was my first county<br/>
review and it was miserable. I greatly resented having to &quot;prove&quot; to the<br/>
gumnint that I was an okay parent. BLECH!!!<br/>
As to the area: We have many many unschooling (to them) families and many<br/>
relaxed eclectics. The HS community here is very large and very organized.<br/>
Secular HSers and Religious HSers rarely run into each other and when they<br/>
do, the religion is rarely discussed. I started an unschooling support group<br/>
in my immediate a few years ago and while it has attracted many people,<br/>
there are probably 5 families who actually &quot;get it&quot; about unschooling. I<br/>
think there are many more out there in other parts of the DC area but most<br/>
have older kids and have started to move away from support group activities.<br/>
Too bad, since they are so important to the new comers!<br/>
