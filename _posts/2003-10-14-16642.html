<div id="ygrps-yiv-1202855770">I&#39;m not even sure what I&#39;m suppose to do to register.(Until I read Sandra&#39;s <br/>
post) I figured if she wasn&#39;t in the system they are not going to even know.My <br/>
customers ask about school because she goes with me to work.I just say we <br/>
don&#39;t send her,they then say &quot;Oh she&#39;s homeschooled,how nice&quot; and I just smile.I <br/>
did have one customer that asked about how she was going to get into college <br/>
without transcipts and I told him I wasn&#39;t sure but that there was so many <br/>
homeschoolers now that there must be a way. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-887203264">The argument (which I, as a parent who vaccinates, do not agree with -- I&#39;m<br/>
a to each their own kinda girl ;) is:<br/>
<br/>
1. Vaccines are effective, but not 100% effective.<br/>
<br/>
2. Unvaccinated people are more likely to get (fill in disease) than<br/>
vaccinated people.<br/>
<br/>
3. Those diseased unvaccinated people are around whatever percentage of<br/>
vaccinated-but-it-didnt-work people who are out walking around, thereby<br/>
putting those vaccinated-people at risk.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a stupid argument, IMHO.<br/>

Tell the next person who asks there are several ways, and there are books out <br/>
to help people figure it out if they can&#39;t figure it out on their own, but <br/>
that the people who say high school is a re-requisite for college are the people <br/>
trying to say whatever they can to get kids to stay in high school.  It&#39;s not <br/>
really a pre-requisite.<br/>

already have a compromised immune system.  The unvaxed kids are supposed to <br/>
be a danger to them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1927398391">Thanks for the summary, Pam.  There will always be people who are alarmed by the choices other people make.  <br/>
 <br/>
I mostly wondered because I&#39;m pretty sure my mil watches ABC news, and while she knows peripherally that we don&#39;t vax, I never know what she may hear somewhere else, since we&#39;ve not discussed my reasons indepth.<br/>
