<div id="ygrps-yiv-653645754">I am thankful for the discussion that has been going on from my original posting. <br/>
As a new unschooling family we are learning to give everyone in our family more choices and freedom and that includes gaming on the laptop which is why I Brought up the emf . I am trying to give myself freedom from worrying and let go of my fears about life in general that  have been set in my head over the years but I have to admit that when I read about something that &#39;could &#39;cause cancer , my maternal protective fearful radar goes on.  Unschooling philosophy has helped me to let go of A LOT of my  fears about life in general but the one fear that I can&#39;t seem to free my mind of is trying to prevent my children from cancer (maybe an irrational thought).As any other parent, we all want our children to be happy AND healthy mentally and physically. I am trying more and more to be &quot;safe without being irrational&quot; but then- what is   &#39;safety&#39; in regards to gaming ? I am aware of safety -with  protection  -in other aspects of our lives (i.e. strapping my small children into a car seat and the rest of Us strapping in ourselves knowing that it will protect us in an accident compared to not wearing one) but what is &#39;safe&#39; with protection in  regards to wifi and technology&#39;s radiation emissions??.I&#39;ve actually read about radiation shields to put on cell phones , supposedly proven to lower radiation levels via a radiation meter but it could very well be a scam!  Playing world of tanks game for two or three hours makes my son beaming with happiness and I Will not restrict his time because of the smile on his face when he talks about the game. And he does live happily away from the computer as well. What remains in the back if my mind is what if damage is being done by radiation to his body that I could be protecting him from? But then again I Don&#39;t know the radiation levels from our cordless house phone or t.v. or microwave oven, etc.  that we&#39;ve had since before our children were born and yet I&#39;ve never thought to worry about those and our children were born as healthy babies and are still healthy. Did I just prove my own self crazy??? If I were really crazy I guess I would say that the emf might be greater from wifi and I should be protecting my family more and  that &#39;s why I should worry more. But that is just too exhausting and takes time away from my beautiful family that I Am thoroughly enjoying through unschooling.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516294087">And?  There are loads of things to worry about.  Why though? Why get your knickers in a twist about this one thing? Why do it at all for anything?  <br/>
<br/>
My dad got cancer on his tongue, something that normally only happens to smokers or chewers and he does neither, no reason at all, it just happened.  He got it removed and life went on.  <br/>
<br/>
I had 2 heart attacks and a double bypass surgery last June.  I&#39;m 41 and don&#39;t smoke and don&#39;t have heart disease.  It was random, no reason that anyone can tell me.  Life goes on.<br/>
<br/>
Things happen, good things, bad things, neutral things.  Why would anyone choose to dwell on the unpleasant things?  Fill up your life with joyful things!  Seriously!  Because if something unpleasant does happen, that&#39;s all you&#39;ve got in your memory banks.  It&#39;s what you can draw from to get through the crap.<br/>
<br/>
More than that, Unschooling is about learning.  Learning happens all the time.  Being happy, joyful, that gets a person through!  Learning happens like magic when there is a lighthearted joy underlying it!<br/>
<br/>
We shouldn&#39;t fill up our children&#39;s memory banks with fear and negativity.  If you feel it, try as best as you can to clear it away, if not for your own peace of mind, do it for your kids because you don&#39;t know what life will throw at them.  What I know is that seeking happiness and calm and joy and peace will be better tools to get through life than fear and negativity!  <br/>
<br/>
If you look for it, fear and negativity is around every corner.  The same applies to happiness and joy.  It&#39;s a choice.  <br/>
<br/>
In those days where it doesn&#39;t feel like a choice, but you&#39;ve lived your life sharing that perspective with your kids, they will repeat it back to you and remind you why you should be happy.  I can&#39;t imagine how dismal it would be if, in the midst of turmoil, the people closest to me, didn&#39;t seek out the bright side of life and share it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a mind numbing thought.  Negativity and fear are a greater poison than all the emf in all the world!<br/>
