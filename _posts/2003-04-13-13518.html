assignment I was already so far behind it was impossible to catch up.  Always <br/>
started out with good intentions.  I learned that all I had to do was read <br/>
the Cliff Notes to get enough information to get a C on the tests.  And in <br/>
school we hardly ever had real discussions about the books and what we <br/>
thought about them.  It was mostly the teacher lecturing about the characters <br/>
etc.<br/>
