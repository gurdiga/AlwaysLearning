The file downloaded and is playing on my iTunes.  I&#39;m not sure what  <br/>
the options are, but that&#39;s what happened on my computer.<br/>
<br/>
This is an interesting site, about changes in technology and culture.<br/>
<br/>
I was involved in a discussion, it&#39;s not available to hear.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
as clear as some of the sound files online, but it&#39;s rich and busy and  <br/>
has a ton of stuff.  His summary at the end amazed me.<br/>
<br/>
The notes there are:<br/>
Special one-hour Yi-Tan Call 248 – Unschooling –<br/>
Our primary and secondary educational systems are controversial, to  <br/>
put it mildly. John Holt, Grace Llewelyn, Paulo Freire, John Taylor  <br/>
Gatto and others have done a fabulous job pointing out how deficient  <br/>
the existing systems are, as well as lighting a path forward.<br/>
<br/>
One growing alternative is unschooling. Unlike the popular home- <br/>
schooling stereotype of parents sharing “classroom” duties at home,  <br/>
unschooling is mostly student-led (and I wince using the word  <br/>
“student”). Explaining it in any depth is beyond the scope of these  <br/>
lightweight invites, so please join this call and explore with us.<br/>
<br/>
We’ve invited a wonderful group of deeply experienced unschoolers,  <br/>
adult and adult-to-be, including Tammy Takahashi, Sandra Dodd, PS  <br/>
Pirro, some of our Yi-Tan regulars and their kids.<br/>
<br/>
With this awesome posse, let’s discuss:<br/>
<br/>
	• What is the range of unschooling practices? How quickly is it  <br/>
growing?<br/>
	• How does the rest of the world respond to unschooling? Is that  <br/>
changing?<br/>
	• What are the main benefits the Net brings unschoolers?</div>
