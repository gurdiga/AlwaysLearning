<div id="ygrps-yiv-2017344421">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
This is my first post. I have three children 14, 11, and 8 and we&#39;ve <br/>
been homeschooling for 6 years. I started out using curriculum but it <br/>
soon became clear that it wasn&#39;t working. I started out limiting screen <br/>
time and it became clear that it wasn&#39;t working. Then I found <br/>
sandradodd.com and all its links and everything became more clear. A BIG <br/>
thank you to all who share their wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Today my two younger children were playing Civilization V ( a gift from <br/>
a friend for my oldest). They were very enthusiastic ! I mentioned that <br/>
maybe they would like to learn more about the different civilizations in <br/>
the game. &quot;That would be great, mom ! I&#39;ll write out a list for you to <br/>
take to the library&quot; replied my 11 year old. Our new path feels wonderful.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1649741484">Nicole, this is also my first post. Question: Are you under the impression that the content of the game, Civilization, reasonably<br/>
reflects and conveys a clear and comprehensive picture of these civilizations? Or is it more likely that the game picks up on some<br/>
names ... peoples, people, places, events ... that might serve as pointers for further exploration?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

It&#39;s not how humans learn. We&#39;re constantly testing our current understanding of the world against anything new. What&#39;s important for building truths about the world isn&#39;t accuracy but living a life that has enough stuff we&#39;re interested in to pull patterns from.</div><div><br></div><div>Most of my understanding of European medieval history came from movies and later romance novels. While accuracy was often an afterthought in movies from the 50&#39;s ;-) what helped me build a workable understanding is, well, first interest! but stumbling on the times when movies agreed on some aspect *and* when they disagreed. When movies agreed, it meant that idea was *possibly* true. When they disagreed, it became an intriguing question of which idea, if either, was right. And because the movies were clearly not a reliable resource, it meant anything might be discovered to be wrong. That&#39;s fun and exciting :-)</div><div><br></div>A few years ago before Carl, Kat and I visited England, I revisited a lot of the old &quot;historical&quot; movies I&#39;d watched as kid. Obviously&nbsp;many of them were full of inaccuracies and anomalies. It was surprising how much Kathryn questioned as accurate even&nbsp;though she hadn&#39;t had nearly as much exposure to those periods as I had.<br><br>And even though my interest was high but casual it was surprisingly&nbsp;easy to figure out what parts of The Vikings (with Kirk Douglas) were accurate and what parts were off. The Viking village had&nbsp;a real feel to it, with the ponies and houses (and the director and Douglas had spent a year researching with help from&nbsp;Norwegian museums), but the English castle felt wrong (turns out if was a French fort from a century later) and the small&nbsp;stained glass window practically jumped out from the screen and said &quot;WRONG!&quot; ;-) But I was never told any of that&nbsp;information. I absorbed it, filtered it, questioned it and built up what is apparently a pretty decent foundation.<br><br><div>Could I pass the AP European History test? No. But that&#39;s not the purpose of learning through unschooling. The purpose is supplying a rich environment for the the child building a head full of ideas and connections she finds intriguing from. If a child discovers connections between a new idea and ideas she&#39;s already intrigued by, the new ideas get sucked in. The more interesting ideas someone has, the more ideas they&#39;ll pull in. The more ideas they have, the more connections they&#39;ll see between vastly different ideas.</div><div><br></div><div>And it doesn&#39;t matter whether the ideas are deemed important by experts or not. A vast knowledge of Pokemon, or bits and pieces gathered from hundreds of interests, is just as useful to build an understanding of the world from as a knowledge of the important world civilizations. *More* important if the knowledge of the world civilizations was pushed in against the child&#39;s will.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><br><blockquote type="cite"><span class="ygrps-yiv-1119819739Apple-style-span" style="font-family:Georgia;font-size:13px;line-height:15px;">Or is it more likely that the game picks up on some<br style="line-height:1.22em;">names ... peoples, people, places, events ... that might serve as pointers for further exploration?</span></blockquote></div><br><div>&quot;Pointers&quot; suggests wanting the child to have leads to the important stuff to know.</div><div><br></div><div>For unschooling the goal shouldn&#39;t be a full or thorough knowledge of a subject. It should be creating a rich life and supporting a child exploring what interests her. A rich knowledge of a subject&nbsp;will come naturally (in a rich environment) *if* the child has an interest that will drive her to pull in a massive amount of knowledge. (Like my daughter with dinosaurs, Pokemon, and heavy metal musicians.)</div><div><br></div><div>If a mom is focused on knowledge needing to look like the facts lined up in a textbook, she&#39;ll be concerned if the child is binge viewing Vampire Diaries to catch up with the current season ;-)&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>If, instead, a mom sees interest, joy, and support in a rich environment being the most important aspect of a child growing in her understanding of herself and the world, then she&#39;ll be more likely to sit down and watch Vampire Diaries with her child :-) Which isn&#39;t just great for learning but for growing great relationships!</div><div><br></div><div>Joyce</div></span></blockquote></html></div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-711539978">&lt;&lt;Could I pass the AP European History test? No. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Incidentally, I did pass it, back in 10th grade.<br/>
Wanna guess how much I remember?<br/>
<br/>
What I do remember was from a separate unit my teacher covered on the history of European architecture.  It was one of her passions and she covered it with such joy.  That stuck with me.  I really enjoyed it - because it was fun -  and remember that stuff a LOT better than I remember anything else.  I couldn&#39;t even tell you what was *on* the AP Euro test.  But I took it and passed it.<br/>

<br>
This is my first post. I have three children 14, 11, and 8 and we&#39;ve <br>
been homeschooling for 6 years. I started out using curriculum but it <br>
soon became clear that it wasn&#39;t working. I started out limiting screen <br>
time and it became clear that it wasn&#39;t working. Then I found <br>
sandradodd.com and all its links and everything became more clear. A BIG <br>
thank you to all who share their wisdom.<br>
<br>
Today my two younger children were playing Civilization V ( a gift from <br>
a friend for my oldest). They were very enthusiastic ! I mentioned that <br>
maybe they would like to learn more about the different civilizations in <br>
the game. &quot;That would be great, mom ! I&#39;ll write out a list for you to <br>
take to the library&quot; replied my 11 year old. Our new path feels wonderful.<br>
