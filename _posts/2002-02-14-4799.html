<div id="ygrps-yiv-395943306">At least around here the martial arts clubs will let you come and<br/>
participate a few times for free.  That could be fun.   Also gymnastics<br/>
clubs.  We went for a month, free, and there&#39;s usually lots of kids.<br/>
<br/>
When my nieces were here they liked theater and costumes so we spent lots<br/>
of time in costume shops, which lead to vintage clothing stores and then<br/>
second hand shops.   My niece, (12)  found an old crushed velvet jacket<br/>
from the forties, maybe, and bought it.  She sold it to her teacher for<br/>
$75. bucks!  So it could be profitable too. <br/>
We also found a place that teaches belly dancing, which was perfect for<br/>
the girls who were into costumes.  They got to participate in the class<br/>
and could have gone to a restaurant to dance one night, but were too shy.<br/>
 Lots of movement and music and flowing fabric.  They had a great time.<br/>
<br/>
Rock hounding clubs and bird watching clubs go on regular field trips to<br/>
interesting places.  They might make you join, for insurance purposes,<br/>
but they might just let you tag along too, as a kind of trial thing.  You<br/>
get a loosely organized field trip with lots of knowledgeable people to<br/>
ask questions of.  <br/>
<br/>
Sky watching clubs hold regular meetings, once a month or so, at night<br/>
for viewing the stars. They usually invite the public at no charge and<br/>
you get to look through lots of different telescopes.  That&#39;s really fun<br/>
because it&#39;s at night and you can take hot chocolate and the kids get to<br/>
race around, everybody&#39;s happy. <br/>
<br/>
We hike a lot.  But we live where we can be in the woods in a few<br/>
minutes.  <br/>
We swim.  The public pool is free, but usually pretty crowded.  We go<br/>
sometimes to the big hot springs resort and swim all day and play on the<br/>
water slide.  It costs but if you go with the idea of being there awhile,<br/>
it feels like it&#39;s worth it. <br/>
In the winter we skate and snowshoe.  I can&#39;t tell you how fun this is. <br/>
We usually go skating at night, I don&#39;t know why but somehow this makes<br/>
it more of an adventure.  Maybe it&#39;s just Dylan&#39;s age. (9)<br/>
Panning for gold is fun.  Digging for crystals and sapphires is fun if<br/>
you don&#39;t have environmental objections.  <br/>
<br/>
We bought a canoe at a garage sale a few years ago and take it out in the<br/>
summer.  That&#39;s fun, and hard work and when you get home it feels like<br/>
you really did something!  Dylan hangs over the side and tries to catch<br/>
water snakes.  Let your kids paddle.  You might not get very far very<br/>
fast but you&#39;ll laugh a lot. <br/>
<br/>
We clean up the little creek that runs through the city park.  This<br/>
sounds stinky but we always have fun.  Mostly I pick up junk and Dylan<br/>
catches frogs and water bugs.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
I know a lot of people are afraid of trampolines but,  WOW!  These are so<br/>
fun.  Better than drugs.  And if you put a water sprinkler under it...<br/>
perfect summer day.<br/>
<br/>
We just discovered a place with racing carts.  They&#39;re little cars you<br/>
zoom around on a track.  This was hilariously fun.  If your kids are<br/>
little though I&#39;d try to find a slow time, so big kids aren&#39;t crashing<br/>
into them.  They can bump pretty hard.   The one we found is open in the<br/>
winter, too, and not too expensive.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve never been but have thought about those paint ball places.  If your<br/>
not against guns that really looks like fun.  Maybe they&#39;re expensive, I<br/>
don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
Nice music stores will let your kids fiddle around on the instruments. <br/>
It&#39;s best to go when they&#39;re not too busy, because most places that will<br/>
let your kid plug in a six hundred dollar guitar will want to be pretty<br/>
close by. And it can be really fun to make those duck fart noises on a<br/>
clarinet.<br/>
<br/>
Once when we were in Denver we went into this fabulous game store.  There<br/>
were fun things everywhere and masks and doo dads. We spent hours playing<br/>
there and had a wonderful time   Dylan loved it and still talks about it.<br/>
 No such store around here, though. <br/>
<br/>
Sporting goods places sometimes have indoor basket ball hoops or a rock<br/>
climbing wall.  There&#39;s one about forty miles from us but when were in<br/>
that town we stop in and if they&#39;re not busy they let Dylan climb the<br/>
wall.  Usually they charge and give lessons, but if you just wander in,<br/>
they might let you play.  <br/>
<br/>
Art gallery&#39;s and museums often have special programs for kids.  These<br/>
are sometimes pretty structured, but you could ask.  The one near us (55<br/>
miles away)  does basket weaving, sculpting, painting,  puppet making<br/>
etc.  There&#39;s usually a program you can get if you call that will tell<br/>
you the schedules.  <br/>
<br/>
Horseback riding.  I don&#39;t know if you live near a stables but in<br/>
addition to giving riding lessons they usually just rent out horses to<br/>
ride.  This is nice if you have a horse lover.  My nieces did this here<br/>
and then started lessons when they got home.  They love it, and even work<br/>
now at the stables for a little extra money on the days they take their<br/>
lessons.  <br/>
<br/>
Places like Home Depot ( if you live near one ) have woodworking shops<br/>
for kids once a month or so. <br/>
 <br/>
Home improvement places will give away their broken ceramic tiles if you<br/>
want to try a mosaic.   We mosaic stepping stones for the garden. <br/>
They&#39;re pretty but they&#39;re slick!   Dylan calls them step around stones.<br/>
<br/>
Weaving shops often have demonstrations.  This is very cool because even<br/>
if you don&#39;t have a passion for textiles the looms are amazing to watch. <br/>
<br/>
There are alternative energy fairs with all kinds of cool stuff to look<br/>
at and tinker with.  Once we got to work on a straw bale house.   <br/>
<br/>
Book stores have story hours or talks or readings by different authors.<br/>
<br/>
Dinner theater is very fun if you get the right show.  That&#39;s more<br/>
expensive but for a treat...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, this got long, sorry.<br/>
