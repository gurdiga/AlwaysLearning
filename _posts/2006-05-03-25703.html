<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552440042">I have asked for help before, and here I am again. I don&#39;t post much <br/>
at all, but I am starting to feel like I just don&#39;t get unschooling. <br/>
In theory, yes it makes total sense to me. And, the thought of <br/>
sending my kids to school just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. (And the <br/>
fact that they don&#39;t want to). My problem is that I read about all <br/>
of these cool, fun things that other people do, and I just don&#39;t see <br/>
that happening for us. I have all of these ideas in my head, but <br/>
seem to have a hard time bringing them to fruition. I feel like a <br/>
deadbeat. I am not writing this to get sympathy, I know that is not <br/>
what this list is all about.  I am getting some help for anxiety, so <br/>
that is part of my problem. I am overwelmed with &quot;should be&#39;s&quot;, <br/>
which leads to anxiety,which leads to me doing nothing. Maybe I need <br/>
to be de-schooled more?! I think if someone told me what to do with <br/>
the kids each day, I could do it. I know unschooling isn&#39;t like this <br/>
though. <br/>
<br/>
My kids are watching too much tv right now because they are bored. I <br/>
have read so many books and articles and it all makes complete <br/>
sense. It is putting these things into real life that I don&#39;t get. <br/>
My kids don&#39;t have these cool projects going on. They do play <br/>
outside alot, and with some neighbor kids, and they are each taking <br/>
a class (gymnastics and trampoline). It just doesn&#39;t feel &quot;right&quot; to <br/>
me. I am trying to be more present, which is a big problem for me. I <br/>
tend to escape in reading, I am working on this. Another problem is <br/>
that I don&#39;t feel like I have interesting things going on in my <br/>
life. The worst part is that I can&#39;t really think of anything that <br/>
sounds interesting to me. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what I am asking for. Maybe others that have been in <br/>
this place? I don&#39;t know. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>

things they did.<br/>

<br/>
You should be watching with them.<br/>
You should have cool projects going on.<br/>
You should play outside with them.<br/>
<br/>
It seems they&#39;re doing some things and you&#39;re doing some other things.<br/>
Find things to do together, and if you can&#39;t lure them to your  <br/>
things, go to theirs.<br/>
<br/>
Do you have computer games or video games?  If you&#39;re at all musical,  <br/>
consider getting one of the music games like Donkey Konga, Karaoke  <br/>
Revolution or Guitar Hero, but only if YOU will play with them.   If  <br/>
you can afford to do one of those, get two sets of drums, two  <br/>
headsets or two guitars (especially important in the drums area).<br/>
<br/>
You talked about TV, but didn&#39;t talk about DVDs, movies...<br/>
<br/>

Maybe you need to escape out away from the house, with the kids.<br/>

<br/>
Does sending your kids to school sound interesting to you?<br/>
You need to make what you&#39;re doing BETTER than school, better in ways  <br/>
that any social worker or relative or neighbor can easily see.<br/>
<br/>
It won&#39;t happen overnight, but it will NEVER happen if you escape in  <br/>
books while they watch TV and play outside.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1725509978">One thing I did one year was to make a list of all the places I&#39;d like to<br/>
take the kids that they weren&#39;t familiar with  and over the course of the<br/>
year we picked a few of the ideas off the list on quiet days and we went to<br/>
them.  We usually had a lot of fun.  Do you have any historical museums or<br/>
forts you can visit?  Museums, children&#39;s museums, art museums, zoos, animal<br/>
sanctuaries, a neighbor with a farm?  Another thing that I did often with my<br/>
children esp. when they were smaller was play board games.  We all enjoy<br/>
them and they are a lot of fun.  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Here is a list of fun ideas I made for the days we couldn&#39;t think of<br/>
something to do. (before we were horse crazy) <br/>
<br/>
Play mailman - At our house we each live in a different room. We use a box<br/>
or container for our mailbox and we send each other notes, bills, and<br/>
homemade junk mail. <br/>
<br/>
Listen to books on tape - They are especially great for in the car. <br/>
<br/>
Finger knitting.<br/>
<br/>
Finger crochet.<br/>
<br/>
Plastic canvas and yarn projects .<br/>
<br/>
Hand sewing (felt works well for little ones), make bean bags, rice bags (to<br/>
heat and sleep with), stuffed animals, doll blankets and pillows, and other<br/>
doll items. <br/>
<br/>
Read aloud.  Ask your friends or email buddies what their favorites are. <br/>
<br/>
Make bubble gum - you can buy gum base on line in a craft kit for under $10<br/>
if you look around.<br/>
<br/>
 Make silly putty- recipes on-line .<br/>
<br/>
Borax snowflakes- recipes on line.<br/>
<br/>
Blow soap bubbles when it&#39;s below zero, they freeze and break when they<br/>
crash. <br/>
<br/>
Rent a movie. <br/>
<br/>
Go to a museum, children&#39;s, state, history, art, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Play store - Price items in your home and use real or play money and take<br/>
turns being the cashier.<br/>
<br/>
Scavenger hunt - inside or outside, finding the things on your list or find<br/>
things other have hidden.<br/>
<br/>
Learn to follow a compass and make an Orienteering course to follow to find<br/>
a treasure.<br/>
<br/>
Bury a time capsule.<br/>
<br/>
Have some friends over for a club with a theme.  My kids like Club Survivor<br/>
or Fear Factor, where they dare each other to eat gross things and win<br/>
prizes. <br/>
<br/>
Guess the smell...blindfolded <br/>
<br/>
Guess the item (by feel) ...blindfolded. <br/>
<br/>
Ask for a tour of a local business. <br/>
<br/>
Make candles, soap, or candy.<br/>
<br/>
Go for a nature walk and collect rocks and leaves.  See if you can identify<br/>
the trees or leaves.<br/>
<br/>
Visit a local farm and bring the animals a treat.  Horses and goats love<br/>
carrots or apples.<br/>
<br/>
Volunteer at a farm to brush the horses or goats, shovel stalls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Go skiing, snow shoeing, or sliding.<br/>
<br/>
Go to the beach or go camping.  It doesn&#39;t have to be 80 degrees out.  The<br/>
beach is beautiful when it is 50 and sunny.  The sand is warm and the wind<br/>
gives you healthy rosy cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
Build a campfire in your yard (might need a permit) and toast marshmallows<br/>
or make smores. <br/>
<br/>
Play a board game or a card game. <br/>
<br/>
Write a story.  Pick a topic and get going...You could have a story night<br/>
with a different topic each week.  Mystery, Horror, Love, Family,<br/>
Non-fiction, etc. <br/>
<br/>
Make your own newspaper about your family.  You can put in pictures too.  <br/>
<br/>
Make paper Decorate your house for the next holiday...hearts on the windows,<br/>
snowflakes hanging from the ceiling, shamrocks, pumpkins, leaves, bats, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Make tissue paper snowflakes. <br/>
<br/>
Make a bank or mask from paper mache&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
Make clay pots with self drying clay. <br/>
<br/>
Paint ornaments or little wooden figures from the craft store. <br/>
<br/>
Paint a picture. <br/>
<br/>
Tie dye your underwear, socks, or t-shirts.<br/>
<br/>
String beads for necklaces or bracelets.<br/>
<br/>
Make necklaces or bracelets out of cotton string.<br/>
<br/>
Paint a clay flower pot with a whimsical motif.<br/>
<br/>
Work with polymer clay, make pins, beads, little figures, or magnets.<br/>
<br/>
Make cards with rubber stamps.<br/>
<br/>
Make a bank from recyclable plastic containers.<br/>
<br/>
Print out coloring pages with your favorite theme and color them. <br/>
<br/>
Buy shrinky dinks, color and shrink them.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1438957627">I had these same feelings for a while and still do occasionally. What helps<br/>
me is to remember what I heard once, I think on this list a while back,<br/>
&quot;Live like there is no such thing as school.&quot; Pretend like it is summer<br/>
vacation or a Saturday. I know it may sound kind of strange but it really<br/>
does help. When your talking about &quot;should be&#39;s&quot; your still thinking of<br/>
schoolish type things you want them to be doing, right? I have a little list<br/>
of things I know my children enjoy and ask me to do with them often and also<br/>
new ideas we think of, (baking, sewing, board games, craft projects,<br/>
swimming, hiking, wood working, puzzles, etc.) I go to this list often,<br/>
especially when I start to get that panicky feeling, and ask the kids if<br/>
they would like to do this or that today. We&#39;ve only been unschooling for<br/>
about a year now so I know very well these feelings you&#39;re having. <br/>
<br/>
Also, read some Holt if you haven&#39;t already. I had a very difficult time<br/>
understanding unschooling until I read some of his books. Now I am able to<br/>
really see how they are learning and growing without anything schoolish in<br/>
their way to inhibit them. <br/>
<br/>
Just live life! Take them grocery shopping, take them for a walk, take them<br/>
to the car wash, cook with them, play with them, encourage questions, ask<br/>
questions yourself, enjoy their company, Get school out of your head. That<br/>
was the biggest hurdle for me. Don&#39;t picture your self in a teacher roll.<br/>
Just be their mom. <br/>
<br/>
If seeing their progress on paper would help, you can do this without them<br/>
knowing about it. Jot down what you see them doing, conversations you have<br/>
with them or that they have with each other, or new discoveries they make,<br/>
or what you all did today, or all of this. Keep a journal if it makes you<br/>
feel more organized. <br/>
<br/>
I also went through a long period of not having any hobbies or interests of<br/>
my own too. I am still working on that but I am a little better. When we<br/>
stopped homeschooling and I realized I had spent a year doing lesson plans<br/>
and lessons,  I had made that my whole life. When we started unschooling I<br/>
had nothing to fill my days anymore. Nothing of my own. When I started to<br/>
relax a little I found a few things I enjoy but I&#39;m still a work in progress<br/>
as far as that goes. <br/>
<br/>
I have been right where you are now and it sucks but it will get better if<br/>
you stop holding on to the ideas of what &quot;should be&quot; happening in your home.<br/>
Just live life. Work WITH your kids, talk to them about how you feel. When I<br/>
was going though this I told my ds that I thought I was a terrible mother.<br/>
He said, &quot;You&#39;re a great mom!&quot; I told him I didn&#39;t feel that way at all. He<br/>
said, &quot;Well, it doesn&#39;t really matter what you think. It only matters what<br/>
we think.&quot; He was right. I had to stop beating myself up and live up to what<br/>
they knew I was. Discuss your feelings with them and the changes you are<br/>
trying to make within yourself. Don&#39;t be afraid to share your feelings and<br/>
thoughts with your kids. They will feel joy that you are confiding in them<br/>
and making yourself venerable. Unschooling is a big transition especially<br/>
for those of us that are so schooled we can&#39;t se past so many things. Give<br/>
yourself a break.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps, <br/>
<br/>
Dawn<br/>

Any mom who isn&#39;t spending many hours a day with her children,  <br/>
though, whether they&#39;re in school or not, isn&#39;t being as good a mom  <br/>
as her kids need.  It IS possible for someone to use unschooling as a  <br/>
cover for doing too little.  If this list can encourage a mom to take  <br/>
a kid to the car wash and talk with him and play with him, we all did  <br/>
a great thing together.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Amie, I can only respond from my own experience (as is<br/>
true for all of us, of course-- well, and what we&#39;ve<br/>
read or learned from others), so if this is way off<br/>
base just take what works and leave the rest, as the<br/>
saying goes. I am also a dreamer, and a reader, and<br/>
tend to drift off and isolate myself. being present is<br/>
*not* what we&#39;re taught in this culture! after all, if<br/>
NOW is fine, how can you be manipulated?! ;) I still<br/>
struggle with this, but I hear it gets easier lol!<br/>
<br/>
you mentioned anxiety, and in that as well as what I<br/>
quoted above I recognize some things I have been<br/>
through. I don&#39;t know how bad your anxiety is, but a<br/>
few months ago I was experiencing severe panic<br/>
attacks. I have had them in the past, many years ago<br/>
before I became a mom, but nothing like these. anxiety<br/>
and depression go hand in hand, as you may know, and I<br/>
hear depression in your statements about having<br/>
nothing interesting in your life. you mentioned that<br/>
you are getting treated for the anxiety; this can mean<br/>
many things, but your statement was a passive one.<br/>
ultimately YOU will have to decide to stand up and<br/>
change your life. medication can be useful and even<br/>
necessary-- it was for me for a very brief period--<br/>
but solving the problem (why you&#39;re depressed and<br/>
anxious) is what will resolve the symptoms<br/>
permanently. I happen to have a great therapist who<br/>
knows me very well and operates from a similar pov to<br/>
mine, and one session with her really shifted my<br/>
thinking. I&#39;m slipping a little OT here, pausing to<br/>
think... when I was at my worst I frantically started<br/>
looking into preschools and applying for jobs. luckily<br/>
nothing panned out, while it kept me busy enough to<br/>
figure out what was going on. here&#39;s what I figured<br/>
out as it pertains to parenting and unschooling<br/>
(parenthetical summaries where I could think of them):<br/>
<br/>
1. meeting my own needs means that I can be the<br/>
unschooling mom I need and want to be. (recharge)<br/>
2. I found some of my hs&#39;ing books and remembered why<br/>
I believe in this approach. (reaffirm)<br/>
3. I realized my social and intellectual needs were<br/>
starving, and started seeking outlets for myself.<br/>
(recharge) imo, this is extremely important modeling.<br/>
how do you want your kids to take care of themselves<br/>
as adults?<br/>
4. I noticed all the signals my body had been giving<br/>
me over many months that I had ignored, so that I had<br/>
to be &quot;hit over the head&quot; with panic attacks before I<br/>
would change anything. (listen to self)<br/>
5. I got online and found this list and the AU list.<br/>
from there, by mentioning my location, I found some<br/>
semi-local moms-- one that I actually knew irl! (get<br/>
connected)<br/>
6. I looked at all the areas of elevated stress in my<br/>
life-- there were quite a few-- and started taking<br/>
concrete steps to make changes. as long as I was<br/>
taking some baby step, I could steer clear of the<br/>
panic. (take action!)<br/>
7. I consciously worked on reconnecting with nature.<br/>
for me, this is my constant, my place where I can find<br/>
that feeling that life is meaningful. if it works for<br/>
you too, it&#39;s getting easier now that we&#39;re moving<br/>
into summer-- make sure you&#39;re not deprived of natural<br/>
light, get your hands in dirt, even if you don&#39;t<br/>
garden, which I highly recommend! (get connected)<br/>
8. I started exercising, very important for clearing<br/>
those toxic panic feelings and the associated<br/>
biochemistry. (be healthy)<br/>
<br/>
so my suggestion, then, would be to figure out what<br/>
you need to recharge and feel that your life is<br/>
meaningful, and go get it! I once heard bernie siegel<br/>
speak, and he said &quot;If you lose your keys, you go find<br/>
them, right? if you lose your health, go find it!&quot; the<br/>
same is true for our motivation and our zest for life.<br/>
go find your joy! and take your kids! it will snowball<br/>
once you get rolling. but you&#39;re the only one who can<br/>
pull you out of the quicksand.<br/>
<br/>
if this is ringing true for you, I&#39;m happy to talk<br/>
more offlist as well. oh, and a great gardening book<br/>
imo is roots, shoots, buckets and boots by sharon<br/>
lovejoy. it&#39;s pretty and fun and full of easy ideas,<br/>
if you&#39;re looking for inspiration and that is an area<br/>
which speaks to your heart.<br/>
<br/>
good luck!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-753447729">Hi Amie,<br/>
<br/>
As I read your note, I see a marked difference between what they <br/>
(the children) do and what you (the adult) does.  Instead of <br/>
thinking &#39;they&#39;, think &#39;us&#39;.  <br/>
<br/>
I think sometimes it&#39;s difficult for adults to play with children.  <br/>
Afterall, children can be silly and immature and use their <br/>
imaginations a great deal.  These are things that aren&#39;t generally <br/>
associated with being an adult.  In our family, there are some <br/>
things the kids do that I don&#39;t participate in, such as role playing <br/>
Star Wars.  I just can&#39;t get into taking on a Star Wars character&#39;s <br/>
persona and running around with a gun, shooting the enemy.  There <br/>
are some things I do that my kids aren&#39;t interested in.  That&#39;s <br/>
fine.  The key is finding common ground.  There are lots of things <br/>
we do together:  watch tv, movies, play games, Nintendo, read aloud, <br/>
window shop at the mall, eat lunch out, garden, ride bikes, hot tub, <br/>
draw and color, build with legos, housework, library, cook, grocery <br/>
shop, and talk.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps a little.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Take them grocery shopping -<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Right - but while you&#39;re there, look at the weirdest thing in the  <br/>
produce department - bright orange cactus? BUY one - go home and get  <br/>
online and try to figure out what to do with it. Or just slice it  <br/>
open to see what is inside.<br/>
<br/>
Or buy a coconut - shake it to see if it has liquid inside. Let the  <br/>
kid pound on it with a hammer until it cracks open. While they&#39;re  <br/>
doing that, do a quick google on coconuts so you have some background  <br/>
knowledge. Don&#39;t &quot;teach&quot; them - but if something seems cool, just say  <br/>
it as an interesting, cool thing to know, &quot;Wow, coconuts are SEEDS!  <br/>
And, oh my gosh, they sometimes float in the ocean for years before  <br/>
washing up on some island and sprouting into a coconut tree.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
How about a pineapple - bought one fresh, lately? Talked about  <br/>
Hawaii? Just say, &quot;Aloha,&quot; while handing the kids a slice. Or, maybe  <br/>
you&#39;ll get really into the whole idea of Hawaii and you&#39;ll see  <br/>

(maybe that will inspire you to want to make your own volcano with  <br/>
baking soda and vinegar).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not saying to prepare a lesson on cactus or coconuts or  <br/>
pineapples. I&#39;m saying that, if you&#39;re not already an interesting  <br/>
person with interesting information to share with your children, then  <br/>
you&#39;ll have to make an effort to BE more interesting. The way to do  <br/>
that is to develop your own sense of curiosity, wonder, fascination,  <br/>
and enthusiasm.<br/>
<br/>
It might have to seem a little artificial, for a while, if it isn&#39;t  <br/>
natural to a parent to just &quot;be&quot; this way.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; , take them for a walk,<br/>

interesting things. Yesterday, my daughter and I were walking down  <br/>
the street and there was a cat on the top of a car - all spread out,  <br/>
sound asleep. It was a little chilly and one of us said, &quot;That car  <br/>
must be nice and warm, holding the heat from the day.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; take them to the car wash,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;Where does all that soapy water go, I wonder?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; cook with them<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Make it super easy fun stuff, not a &quot;cooking lesson.&quot; Put peanut  <br/>
butter on celery and then stick raisins on that and call it, &quot;Ants on  <br/>
a log.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; , play with them, encourage questions, ask<br/>
&gt; questions yourself, enjoy their company, Get school out of your  <br/>
&gt; head. That<br/>
&gt; was the biggest hurdle for me. Don&#39;t picture your self in a teacher  <br/>
&gt; roll.<br/>
&gt; Just be their mom.<br/>
<br/>

That sounds good.  Good way to put it without fancy bells and whistles.<br/>
<br/>
Any mom who isn&#39;t spending many hours a day with her children,  <br/>
though, whether they&#39;re in school or not, isn&#39;t being as good a mom  <br/>
as her kids need.  It IS possible for someone to use unschooling as a  <br/>
cover for doing too little.  If this list can encourage a mom to take  <br/>
a kid to the car wash and talk with him and play with him, we all did  <br/>
a great thing together.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
  One thing I did one year was to make a list of all the places I&#39;d like to<br/>
  take the kids that they weren&#39;t familiar with  and over the course of the<br/>
  year we picked a few of the ideas off the list on quiet days and we went to<br/>
  them.  We usually had a lot of fun.  Do you have any historical museums or<br/>
  forts you can visit?  Museums, children&#39;s museums, art museums, zoos, animal<br/>
  sanctuaries, a neighbor with a farm?  Another thing that I did often with my<br/>
  children esp. when they were smaller was play board games.  We all enjoy<br/>
  them and they are a lot of fun.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  Here is a list of fun ideas I made for the days we couldn&#39;t think of<br/>
  something to do. (before we were horse crazy) <br/>
<br/>
  Play mailman - At our house we each live in a different room. We use a box<br/>
  or container for our mailbox and we send each other notes, bills, and<br/>
  homemade junk mail. <br/>
<br/>
  Listen to books on tape - They are especially great for in the car. <br/>
<br/>
  Finger knitting.<br/>
<br/>
  Finger crochet.<br/>
<br/>
  Plastic canvas and yarn projects .<br/>
<br/>
  Hand sewing (felt works well for little ones), make bean bags, rice bags (to<br/>
  heat and sleep with), stuffed animals, doll blankets and pillows, and other<br/>
  doll items. <br/>
<br/>
  Read aloud.  Ask your friends or email buddies what their favorites are. <br/>
<br/>
  Make bubble gum - you can buy gum base on line in a craft kit for under $10<br/>
  if you look around.<br/>
<br/>
  Make silly putty- recipes on-line .<br/>
<br/>
  Borax snowflakes- recipes on line.<br/>
<br/>
  Blow soap bubbles when it&#39;s below zero, they freeze and break when they<br/>
  crash. <br/>
<br/>
  Rent a movie. <br/>
<br/>
  Go to a museum, children&#39;s, state, history, art, etc. <br/>
<br/>
  Play store - Price items in your home and use real or play money and take<br/>
  turns being the cashier.<br/>
<br/>
  Scavenger hunt - inside or outside, finding the things on your list or find<br/>
  things other have hidden.<br/>
<br/>
  Learn to follow a compass and make an Orienteering course to follow to find<br/>
  a treasure.<br/>
<br/>
  Bury a time capsule.<br/>
<br/>
  Have some friends over for a club with a theme.  My kids like Club Survivor<br/>
  or Fear Factor, where they dare each other to eat gross things and win<br/>
  prizes. <br/>
<br/>
  Guess the smell...blindfolded <br/>
<br/>
  Guess the item (by feel) ...blindfolded. <br/>
<br/>
  Ask for a tour of a local business. <br/>
<br/>
  Make candles, soap, or candy.<br/>
<br/>
  Go for a nature walk and collect rocks and leaves.  See if you can identify<br/>
  the trees or leaves.<br/>
<br/>
  Visit a local farm and bring the animals a treat.  Horses and goats love<br/>
  carrots or apples.<br/>
<br/>
  Volunteer at a farm to brush the horses or goats, shovel stalls, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  Go skiing, snow shoeing, or sliding.<br/>
<br/>
  Go to the beach or go camping.  It doesn&#39;t have to be 80 degrees out.  The<br/>
  beach is beautiful when it is 50 and sunny.  The sand is warm and the wind<br/>
  gives you healthy rosy cheeks.<br/>
<br/>
  Build a campfire in your yard (might need a permit) and toast marshmallows<br/>
  or make smores. <br/>
<br/>
  Play a board game or a card game. <br/>
<br/>
  Write a story.  Pick a topic and get going...You could have a story night<br/>
  with a different topic each week.  Mystery, Horror, Love, Family,<br/>
  Non-fiction, etc. <br/>
<br/>
  Make your own newspaper about your family.  You can put in pictures too.  <br/>
<br/>
  Make paper Decorate your house for the next holiday...hearts on the windows,<br/>
  snowflakes hanging from the ceiling, shamrocks, pumpkins, leaves, bats, etc.<br/>
<br/>
  Make tissue paper snowflakes. <br/>
<br/>
  Make a bank or mask from paper mache&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
  Make clay pots with self drying clay. <br/>
<br/>
  Paint ornaments or little wooden figures from the craft store. <br/>
<br/>
  Paint a picture. <br/>
<br/>
  Tie dye your underwear, socks, or t-shirts.<br/>
<br/>
  String beads for necklaces or bracelets.<br/>
<br/>
  Make necklaces or bracelets out of cotton string.<br/>
<br/>
  Paint a clay flower pot with a whimsical motif.<br/>
<br/>
  Work with polymer clay, make pins, beads, little figures, or magnets.<br/>
<br/>
  Make cards with rubber stamps.<br/>
<br/>
  Make a bank from recyclable plastic containers.<br/>
<br/>
  Print out coloring pages with your favorite theme and color them. <br/>
<br/>
  Buy shrinky dinks, color and shrink them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

I think that children are experts at being able to adapt to just about any<br/>
environment they are in. Just take a look at all of those children who are<br/>
sexually abused and no one ever knows, sometimes not even the parents. Does<br/>
this mean they are okay? No, it means they can adapt to what is going on and<br/>
still function in the world. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>They came out of the Girl Scouts, probably around WWII.<br/>
<br/>
The name S&#39;mores is short for &quot;some more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re actually kind of nasty, but artsy.  They ideally happen  <br/>
outside with campfires.<br/>
<br/>
You need Graham Crackers (which you might not have) and they are  <br/>
scored to break into quarters, but for s&#39;mores you only break them in  <br/>
half, so it&#39;s a square about the size of the palm of your hand.  You  <br/>
need both halves.<br/>
<br/>
Then you get a plain Hershey bar.   The main problem here is they&#39;ve  <br/>
changed the mold into which they pour Hershey bars years ago.  But  <br/>
they used to also be very flat and scored.  So you would take four  <br/>
squares of the Hershey bar, which was a little smaller than the  <br/>
cracker.  That part is on standby—must be in hand and ready to go.<br/>
<br/>
Last ingredient is a marshmallow.  I don&#39;t know if or what size of  <br/>
marshmallows you get if you have any, but you need the big one  <br/>
that&#39;s  about an inch and a half across (4 cm or so) and you &quot;roast&quot;  <br/>
that—try to get it browned and soft inside without it catching fire— <br/>
and then someone helps you close that up between the cracker halves,  <br/>
you pull the stick out while they&#39;re holding some pressure on it, and  <br/>
then you wait a few seconds for it to start melting the chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re messy, WAY sweet, and traditional.<br/>
<br/>
But lately there&#39;s &quot;s&#39;more flavored&quot; bunch of everything—granola  <br/>
bars, ice cream, breakfast cereal—which then just means it has Graham  <br/>
cracker, marshmallow and milk chocolate flavors and probably lumps in  <br/>
there.<br/>

I think that children are experts at being able to adapt to just about any<br/>
environment they are in. Just take a look at all of those children who are<br/>
sexually abused and no one ever knows, sometimes not even the parents. Does<br/>
this mean they are okay? No, it means they can adapt to what is going on and<br/>
still function in the world. &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what I think.   I know so many strong beautiful people who came from <br/>
really difficult homes.   Well, I guess John Holt was one of those.  Somehow <br/>
many people are able to draw good out of their upbringing even if it was <br/>
mostly not good.   That gives me hope on bad days when everything I&#39;m doing <br/>
is going wrong, but it&#39;s not an excuse to leave it up to my kids to make up <br/>
for my deficits.   There will be enough mistakes I make with the best <br/>
intentions.<br/>

April 30, 2006<br/>
A Question of Resilience<br/>
By EMILY BAZELON<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The full article is here<br/>
&lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/magazine/30abuse.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/30/magazine/30abuse.html</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few little bits of it:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The everyday meaning of the word &quot;resilience&quot; extends to anything that<br/>
bounces back. Estée Lauder makes Resilience Lift Eye Crème and Hanes<br/>
makes Resilience Pantyhose. But in psychology, resilience has a specific<br/>
meaning. It&#39;s the word for springing back from serious adversity, like<br/>
abuse, war or natural disasters. You exhibit resilience (as opposed to<br/>
plain competence) if you cope with terrible misfortune and live a<br/>
relatively successful life as defined by mental health, success in<br/>
school or at work or solid relationships.<br/>
<br/>
In studies of the long-term effects of physical and sexual child abuse,<br/>
20 to 40 percent of victims show few signs of behavioral or<br/>
mental-health problems. And many of them don&#39;t appear damaged later in<br/>
life. As Ann Masten, a resilience researcher, has written, resilient<br/>
children have the benefit of &quot;ordinary magic.&quot; When it comes to abuse<br/>
victims, though, this finding is rarely trumpeted, for fear that saying<br/>
abuse isn&#39;t always inevitably harmful is tantamount to saying it&#39;s not<br/>
always bad.<br/>
<br/>
Over the last several decades, a small group of researchers has tried to<br/>
understand how a minority of maltreated children exceed  <br/>
expectations. . .<br/>

They have lots of battles of wills over things like television and food <br/>

no sense that their children will grow up any more distant from them <br/>

One thing I did this winter, as I tried to avoid slipping into seasonal depression with the short cloudy days, was to sit by the sunniest window in the house as much as I could in the mornings.  This morphed into morning sessions reading to my son by the window.  Since we have no set bedtime routine and rarely read at night, as a book fiend, I was happy that this opportunity cropped up to get bookish together.  (Our current book is about 900 pages long, so this looks like a habit that might last awhile. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Julia, I thought your whole post was really insightful, and could have been written about me.  (Yes, I excercised this morning.  And I&#39;m trying to get the judgemental voiced in my head to shut up, or at least not pass my lips!)<br/>
<br/>
A friend of mine who was feeling poorly and having panic attacks eventually was diagnosed with thyroid disease.  Since underperforming thyroid is a fairly common and easily overlooked health problem in women over thirty, I thought I&#39;d mention it.  It might be relevant to someone who is sitting around a lot and feeling &quot;blah&quot;.  The problem is not always willpower, although revving up the &quot;will&quot; can often help anything (if you refrain from beating yourself up.)<br/>

And one was how schools always say they produce successes.  But they  <br/>
produce WAY more failures than successes.  TONS more.  They do it on  <br/>
purpose, too, because without drop outs and flunkies, the successes  <br/>
aren&#39;t special, aren&#39;t &quot;honor&quot; anything or &quot;A&quot; anything.  And maybe  <br/>
every one of those successes would have been a success anyway, and  <br/>
school didn&#39;t &quot;create&quot; them at all, just warehoused them until they  <br/>
could finally serve enough time to be let into the minimum security  <br/>
atmosphere of the university for another stint.<br/>
<br/>
And about parenting, I think I wrote something like that yesterday or  <br/>
today, or at least I thought it. &lt;g&gt;  If in a given instance it  <br/>
really  makes no difference to the child&#39;s longterm success or peace  <br/>
how a parent acts, then why should the parent act better?<br/>
<br/>
To be a better parent.<br/>
<br/>
IF in some instance an abused child was stronger psychologically and  <br/>
emotionally than the loser abuser, that doesn&#39;t mean the abuser  <br/>
didn&#39;t make himself a very bad person, regardless of the longterm  <br/>
result.<br/>
<br/>
If a person lies in a forest (not in the Waldorf kind of way, but in  <br/>
the pants-on-fire way) and nobody hears him, is he still a liar?<br/>

They certainly sound delicious. What&#39;s another alternative to graham crackers (have no idea what they are - not water crackers????). Also what sort of chocolate bars - like rows of block chocolate or something different? And do you just put them together and eat them or do you put them in the fire in foil???  Would really love to do some with Lewi and give him a taste of the US!!! <br/>

<br/>
Graham crackers are slightly sweet. They&#39;re used as a base for  <br/>
cheesecake but apparently Australian recipes use sweet biscuits  <br/>
(cookies). It says in one recipe: &quot;If you live in a country where  <br/>
Graham crackers aren&#39;t available, simply use Digestive biscuit crumbs  <br/>
instead and omit the sugar.&quot; So that suggests Digestive biscuits  <br/>
would be sweeter than graham crackers.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s two Australian s&#39;mores recipes:<br/>
==========<br/>
<br/>
My Guides love cooking (and eating) S&#39;mores but we don&#39;t use graham  <br/>
crackers and chocolate instead we use a biscuit (cookie) called Choc  <br/>
Weatens. It&#39;s like an ordinary plain biscuit with a chocolate coating  <br/>
on one side.<br/>
The girls toast their marshmallow then sandwich it between two  <br/>
biscuits with the chocolate on the marshmallow side. Yummo!!!<br/>

<br/>
===========<br/>
<br/>
We were first exposed to them in 2004 (here) and we have started  <br/>
using an Australian equivalent. We don&#39;t have Graham crackers here  <br/>
and we wanted nicer chocolate than Hershey&#39;s and tasty Australian  <br/>
Marshmallows.<br/>
<br/>
Australian Smores<br/>
Ingredients<br/>
2 Morning Coffee biscuits<br/>
2 Marshmallows<br/>
2 squares Cadbury chocolate<br/>
<br/>
Method<br/>
Melt the marshmallows over fire embers. The outside whould be thin  <br/>
and crunchy with the centre all melted.<br/>
Place the chocolate on the biscuit and using the top biscuit move the  <br/>
marshmallow from the stick onto the biscuit and squeeze. The  <br/>
marshmallow melds the top and bottom biscuit with the chocolate  <br/>
meling in the middle. The name comes from the first thing the person  <br/>
eating it says with their mouth full, &quot;&#39;smore please&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
Honey Graham Crackers Recipe<br/>
Ingredients<br/>
1/3 cup milk<br/>
1/4 cup honey<br/>
1-1/2 cups graham flour (whole wheat may be substituted)<br/>
1 cup all-purpose flour<br/>
1/4 cup brown sugar, packed<br/>
1 tsp baking powder<br/>
1/2 tsp baking soda<br/>
1/3 cup butter<br/>
1/4 cup shortening<br/>
<br/>
Instructions<br/>
In a small bowl stir together milk and honey. Set milk mixture aside.<br/>
<br/>
In a large bowl stir together graham flour, all-purpose flour, brown  <br/>
sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Using a  <br/>
pastry blender, cut in butter and shortening till mixture resembles  <br/>
coarse crumbs. Make a well in center of flour mixture. Add milk  <br/>
mixture all at once. Using a fork, stir till mixture can be gathered  <br/>
into a ball. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead  <br/>
dough by gently folding and pressing dough for 12 to 15 strokes or  <br/>
till dough is nearly smooth. Divide dough in half.<br/>
<br/>
Sprinkle surface with additional graham flour. Roll each half of  <br/>
dough to 1/8-inch thickness. Using a pastry wheel or sharp knife, cut  <br/>
dough into 2-inch squares. Place on ungreased baking sheet. Using the  <br/>
tines of a fork, prick crackers well. Bake in a 350-degree F oven for  <br/>
12 to 15 minutes or until done. Remove crackers from sheet and cool  <br/>
on a wire rack.<br/>
<br/>
VARIATION:<br/>
Cinnamon Graham Crackers<br/>
Prepare Honey Graham Crackers as directed above, except stir 1/4  <br/>
teaspoon ground cinnamon into the flour mixture. After pricking the  <br/>
crackers, sprinkle crackers with a mixture of 3 Tablespoons sugar and  <br/>
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon.<br/>
<br/>
Yield: 72 crackers<br/>

&gt;&gt; I don&#39;t know if Australia has graham crackers, they have Kraft Mac and<br/>
&gt;&gt; Cheese which Britain doesn&#39;t have, so maybe they have graham crackers.<br/>
&gt;&gt; But, we&#39;ve found that plain digestive biscuits are a pretty close<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; You need Graham Crackers (which you might not have) and they are<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; scored to break into quarters, but for s&#39;mores you only break them in<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; half, so it&#39;s a square about the size of the palm of your hand.  You<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; need both halves.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Then you get a plain Hershey bar.   The main problem here is they&#39;ve<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; changed the mold into which they pour Hershey bars years ago.  But<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; they used to also be very flat and scored.  So you would take four<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; squares of the Hershey bar, which was a little smaller than the<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; cracker.  That part is on standby—must be in hand and ready to go.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Last ingredient is a marshmallow.  I don&#39;t know if or what size of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; marshmallows you get if you have any, but you need the big one<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that&#39;s  about an inch and a half across (4 cm or so) and you &quot;roast&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; that—try to get it browned and soft inside without it catching fire—<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; and then someone helps you close that up between the cracker halves,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you pull the stick out while they&#39;re holding some pressure on it, and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; then you wait a few seconds for it to start melting the chocolate.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; They&#39;re messy, WAY sweet, and traditional.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Digestive biscuits and Graham crackers<br/>
<br/>
These two items are fairly different, but are used similarly (e.g. to  <br/>
make crumb crusts for a cheesecake). Graham crackers are sweeter, and  <br/>
are available in different flavors (e.g. cinnamon, chocolate).  <br/>
Digestive biscuits are richer, and while slightly sweet, are often  <br/>
used eaten with cheese. They are also available coated on one side  <br/>
with milk or dark chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Wikipedia has that here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_food_terms">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_food_terms</a><br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I saw a few things on that chart I didn&#39;t know, and even more I don&#39;t  <br/>
believe.<br/>
Our lemonade isn&#39;t the same as English lemonade at ALL.<br/>
And I know what popovers are, and I&#39;ve had Yorkshire pudding in  <br/>
Yorkshire, and they&#39;re not even nearly related.<br/>
<br/>
The chart says that in Australia &quot;cheerios&quot; are what Americans call &quot;<br/>
Lil&#39; smokies or teeny weenies&quot;<br/>
I&#39;ve heard them called cocktail weenies more than &quot;teeny.&quot;<br/>
They show no Canadian or English equivalent<br/>
<br/>
Cheerios is one of our oldest breakfast cereals, here.<br/>
<br/>
The chart seems to suggest American don&#39;t have a word for spinach, or  <br/>
don&#39;t know what spinach is.  Thanks to canned spinach and school  <br/>
cafeterias, many people would like to pretend they don&#39;t know.   <br/>
(Ditto stewed plums and &#39;fruit cocktail.&#39;)<br/>
