<div id="ygrps-yiv-352046327">These are slings and one of the most popular has been the Over the Shoulder<br/>
Baby Holder. I&#39;ve used them for all my kids and just ordered another for<br/>
this next one. Wearsthebaby.com has them (she&#39;s an AP/HS mom) and lots of<br/>
info about slings.<br/>
<br/>
No chile verde recipe sorry.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891533067">both my babies loved to see the world.  you don&#39;t have to wear your baby <br/>
in a sling in such a way that they can&#39;t see the world.  in fact, most <br/>
of the positions are such that they do see outside the sling.  janene <br/>
loved sitting with her legs crossed facing forward.  i didn&#39;t get the <br/>
sling until late with lexie but she loved being on my back.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-290696097">i should also add that i still use my sling, although not often to carry <br/>
janene, who is four.  i carry it with me though, just in case she needs <br/>
to be carried, it helps to support her weight more evenly.  however last <br/>
week i used it to carry apples.  we were picking apples with a <br/>
homeschool group fromt he camp we went to, and aleq&#39;s bag broke.  so we <br/>
put all the apples in the sling.  i have a picture i need to get <br/>
developed.  it was very cool.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081858018">yeah, it&#39;s really nice.  you can have them how you want them, with a <br/>
pillow or not, etc.  i don&#39;t want to advertise (unlike yahoo, looking at <br/>
their ad below my wrting now) but i got my mom to start making slings <br/>
because i wanted one made my way.  ;-)  people can even pick out their <br/>
own fabric.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>One nice thing about the sling is that you can use it in a lot of<br/>
different ways. When Rain was really small, she *needed* to be upright<br/>
and looking out. I could sit her in the sling with her back against my<br/>
chest and her legs folded, and she was happy that way. Then there was a<br/>
period when she didn&#39;t like the sling at all. When she got older, like<br/>
6-9 months, she liked the hip carry in the sling. After a while, we<br/>
modified it to a back-of-the-hip carry, and I carried her that way until<br/>
she was over 3 and close to 40 pounds - it was great for when she wanted<br/>
to be close and I was trying to cook or shop or something (and I&#39;m a<br/>
pretty skinny person, I was carrying about a third of my body weight at<br/>
the end and it wasn&#39;t too heavy).<br/>
