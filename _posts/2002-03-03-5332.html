...and also a link to the state regs.  But tell her she can ignore those if <br/>
she wants to.  Most people do.  Estimates on not being registered used to be <br/>
1/3 to 2/3.  Now that they don&#39;t require testing (and so there&#39;s no oversight <br/>
requirement, just the annual letter of intent), it seems to me even fewer <br/>
register than before.<br/>
