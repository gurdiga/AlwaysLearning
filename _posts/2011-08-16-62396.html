<br/>
Is the new place for unschoolers (of any age!) to share their creative works with each other<br/>
and the world. If parents are interested in sharing their art, we can add a &quot;parent&quot; section too.<br/>
<br/>
I would love for a few other parents or older unschoolers to help me administer<br/>
the blog, so please email me off-list if you&#39;re interested.<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers can send their work here for posting on the blog:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:unschoolersartgallery@...">unschoolersartgallery@...</a><br/>
<br/>
If your unschooler would like to have a bio and photo on the site, please send<br/>
that too.<br/>
<br/>
Drawings, animation, videos, photos, photos of sculptures, comics, creative<br/>
writing, ......any and everything creative welcome!<br/>
