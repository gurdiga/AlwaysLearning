<div id="ygrps-yiv-1241391406">I recently met a single mom who is unschooling her 6 yo son.  She mentioned today that she has to go through the school board for the first year (she just moved to Florida from Chicago) because she wants to get him evaluated for speech at no cost to her.  I know someone else (now also an unschooler) who did this and had therapy recommended for 2 of her kids.  They hated the therapy and she hated the therapy so they quit after a short time.  Her kids got over their speech issues without the therapy.  This single mom is basing her son&#39;s need for evaluation on two separate occasions where it was suggested by other people (not professionals).  I&#39;m just wondering if anyone knows where she can get some info/support online before she has him evaluated.  I&#39;ve had conversations with her son and he sounds just fine to me.  I would love to be able to offer her an alternative to going through the school board.  Thanks in advance.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1108216936">My son did speech therapy for awhile, then he turned 3 and was too old for the program that did it at home.  We decided not to let him do it through the school system and he is speaking just fine now.  As long as your friend&#39;s son has a chance to have conversations with people, I am sure he will be okay.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-747436423">Depends on what&#39;s wrong. My four yo has dysarthria. It really took  <br/>
some analysis of how people breath and position their mouths when  <br/>
they speak, and teaching him what would work for his particular  <br/>
differences. He naturally breathes differently and has a motor  <br/>
dysfunction in the nerves to his facial muscles, so the speech  <br/>
pathologist was very helpful in that.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, schools almost never provide an appropriate  <br/>
therapy, and it&#39;s better to pay a private therapist rather than  <br/>
depend on the schools to provide a good source of it. You really need  <br/>
to ask the question of how the son is doing. The only reason we  <br/>
finally went for the speech was that Sam was so angry and frustrated  <br/>
with us not being able to understand him.<br/>

We are faced with almost identical situation with our 6 year old <br/>

Neurofeedback: www.eegspectrum.com.  I will post later on this yahoo! <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2120520286">There was a time when I considered speech therapy for my now 10 year old.  Sometimes even I had to ask her to repeat things several times before I could figure out what she was saying.  Her speech is just fine now, with no therapy ever.<br/>
<br/>
She has also exhibited some traits that are associated with dyslexia.  It was in the back of my mind to &quot;do something&quot;, but I never did.  I live in WA state where we don&#39;t have to test - we can do an annual assessment instead.  I just write up a summary of the previous year and then file it away.<br/>
<br/>
She is 10 and a half and is rapidly improving with reading.  I&#39;d say it&#39;s been in the past few months that she is &quot;really reading&quot;.  Kind of early by some standards!  She does beautiful art work and arithmetic is fun and easy for her.  She learned to play cribbage last year and now wins nearly every game - even with her dad who has been playing for decades and is quite good.<br/>
<br/>
If she had gone to school, she probably would have been shuffled off to speech therapy and special reading groups.  I&#39;m so glad she has been home!<br/>
