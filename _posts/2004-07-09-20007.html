<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561547475">That&#39;s so funny, Pam.   Aislinn and Elysia, 8 and 6, have some pretty <br/>
grand plans about excavating our backyard for their family houses.  They <br/>
plan on underground houses with tunnels between each of theirs and ours. <br/>
 I love fantasizing about this, too.  I would be so unhappy if they <br/>
moved away.  Heidi<br/>

&gt;&gt;The whole idea of leaving home at 18 or 21ish IS deeply ingrained in our  <br/>
&gt;&gt;society. <br/>
&gt;&gt;    <br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;The other day my son Dallen who is 9 said that when he gets older he wants to <br/>
&gt;clear some land in our back acreage and build a house on our property to live <br/>
&gt;in.  The thought of that is nice.  That my son would be that close.  But we <br/>
&gt;have never really bought into the concept of moving our at 18 or 21.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;It was very touching,<br/>
&gt;Pam<br/>
