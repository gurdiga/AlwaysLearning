<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110041593">I&#39;ve mentioned my old attitude and how I&#39;m working on things.  I had<br/>
an awesome moment about half an hour ago that made me feel really<br/>
good.  My youngest son told me matter of factly that he had spilled<br/>
his milk.  I got up, found something close to begin cleaning and asked<br/>
him to get another towel that was farther away, but was big enough to<br/>
finish the job.  We cleaned the milk up together and got him into some<br/>
new clothes.  This probably sounds really simple, and basically, the<br/>
actions were the same ones I would have followed just a few months<br/>
ago.  The spill was cleaned and the clothes changed.  The difference<br/>
this time was that no one yelled, screamed, sighed, huffed, growled,<br/>
stomped and no one else cried, screamed or got scared of his father. <br/>
It also took a fraction of the time to just smile and wipe.<br/>
In the middle of all that I had a moment where I realized how much<br/>
nicer it was to just deal with the situation.  It wasn&#39;t a moment to<br/>
teach him not to spill his milk.  It wasn&#39;t a moment to deride or<br/>
correct.  It was just spilled milk and a little boy with a cold strip<br/>
down the front of his clothes.  And that&#39;s all they ever are, just<br/>
spilled milk and soggy britches.</div>

<br/>
Beautiful.<br/>
Beautiful writing, too, and thanks for sharing it here.<br/>
I&#39;m saving it somewhere...<br/>
<br/>
My moment like that was when I spilled a whole baby bathtub of water  <br/>
and didn&#39;t yelp or cry or say bad words or feel like a failure.<br/>
Your story&#39;s prettier, but I still remember the feeling of surprising  <br/>
myself by my calm response.<br/>
<br/>
Ren and some of the others here might remember their first time too.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;    Any other stories?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I used to get really upset about things (i tend to be a yeller, tend <br/>
to quickly get angry ), but since we&#39;ve been unschooling its been <br/>
easier. It was cool the first couple of times something like that <br/>
happened, something broke, or seamus knocked a whole glass of <br/>
something over, and then looked at me like &quot;uh oh, whats she gonna <br/>
say?&quot;...and i just laughed. He looked so relieved. Whats even better <br/>
though is that now he doesnt usually give me the look, doesnt look <br/>
relieved, because he isnt *expecting* me to get upset, usually he&#39;s <br/>
expecting me NOT to get upset. Which makes me feel like i really AM <br/>
doing something right!<br/>
