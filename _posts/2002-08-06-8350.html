collecting National Geographics for years and recently talked, <br/>
reluctantly, about giving them up. They take up a lot of space, are a <br/>
pain to move (we&#39;ve done it twice this year) and don&#39;t get looked at <br/>
much. I encouraged him to keep them, since he&#39;s always talked about <br/>
looking forward to having the time to just sit down and immerse himself <br/>
in them.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s back from his three-month Australian trip (if you remember me <br/>
mentioning this before--he&#39;s back even if you don&#39;t remember me <br/>
mentioning it! &lt;g&gt;) and I&#39;m working hard on getting him NOT to go back <br/>
to work. We&#39;re still too young to &quot;retire&quot;, whatever that means these <br/>
days, but there are lots of ways to make enough money to live w/o <br/>
engaging in work you don&#39;t like. I&#39;m reading &quot;Making a Living Without a <br/>
Job&quot; aloud each day and he&#39;s beginning to show signs of real interest.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t seem to keep up with this list, but every time I dip in to read <br/>
I find something wonderful!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Actually, I found the article in our CD-ROM set  :-)   The search feature is<br/>
fabulous -- I typed in &quot;silk&quot; and found it, several months ago when my<br/>
Embroiderer&#39;s Guild list discussed Chinese double-sided embroidery.  We have<br/>
paper copies back to 1985, when my husband&#39;s grandmother gave us a<br/>
subscription.  I&#39;ve been trying to convince MY dh to give up the paper<br/>
copies in favor of the teeny-weeny space-saving CD&#39;s  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
