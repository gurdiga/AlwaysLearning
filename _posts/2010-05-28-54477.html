<div id="ygrps-yiv-1699095111">I have a sweet story to share. <br/>
<br/>
A couple of months ago Wolfgang&#39;s bike was stolen. Wolfgang is 15. <br/>
<br/>
The other day the kids, Jeff and I were outside when a boy rode by on the bike. <br/>
<br/>
Jeff followed the boy and got it back. He gave it up without contesting just acted as though he <br/>
didn&#39;t know....but he gave it back.<br/>
<br/>
Wolfgang saw the kid at the lake a couple of days later. He didn&#39;t talk to him. <br/>
He&#39;s never talked to him. He *looks* like a trouble sad kid, smoker, <br/>
drugs etc. <br/>
<br/>
When we got home Wolfgang said, &quot;I think I&#39;d like to give him the <br/>
bike. I have another one now and don&#39;t need it. Plus if I give him the bike <br/>
he&#39;ll be less likely to go steal someone else&#39;s.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Then he posted that on his facebook page asking for feedback. A mother of a friend of Wolf&#39;s responded.<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
Wolfgang Halldorson: went swimming pretty packed but, the water was nice. <br/>
Got to see who stole my bike thinking about just giving it to him because he <br/>
i just going to steal another one and him having my bike would decline that <br/>
risk and plus i have another bike that i like more so it is all cool<br/>
<br/>
friends mother: I like the thought but not the fact that he would be <br/>
rewarded for his stealing.<br/>
Tuesday at 9:40pm<br/>
<br/>
Wolfgang Halldorson: the kid gave it back without a problem and he would not <br/>
have the need to steal another one if he had mine. It would not be rewarding <br/>
him he needs it more than me. he seems like a kind of depressed kid<br/>
<br/>
===<br/>
<br/>
Who says teenagers are selfish? <br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>
Kelly<br/>

That&#39;s a very sweet story. A lot of thinking going on in him.<br/>

brilliant.<br/>

The other boy walked by our yard yesterday. Wolfgang went outside and offered him the bike. Wolf said he has another one and wouldn&#39;t mind. The kid refused. He was nice but he looked as though he felt really uncomfortable. Wolfgang told him it was really okay that he wanted him to have it. He even said, kindly, that he&#39;d rather him have it than take someone else&#39;s bike.<br/>
<br/>
He refused, again. Nicely. <br/>
<br/>
Jeff (hubby) asked him his name and how old he was. He is three month younger than Wolf. Jeff assured him that Wolfgang was &quot;allowed&quot; to give the bike to him and we all wanted him to have transportation so he didn&#39;t think he needed to take someone else&#39;s bike again. Jeff said, &quot;Would feel better with another bike? You can have that mountain bike we don&#39;t use it.&quot; (we have a handful of bikes that were gifted to us and some put together from pieces from the dump).<br/>
<br/>
The kid accepted the mountain bike. He thanked both Jeff and Wolf. <br/>
<br/>
He and Wolfgang shook hands.<br/>
<br/>
: )<br/>
peace,<br/>
