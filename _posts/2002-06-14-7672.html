<div id="ygrps-yiv-548165838">Chips are crisps.<br/>
Cookies are biscuits.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what crackers are called. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Pam<br/>
<br/>
And they don&#39;t have biscuits like we do.  Their closest substitute is scones, which is a very controversial topic to the British, as to the authentic way to pronounce them and make them!<br/>
<br/>
~ Anne, who made peach shortcake on biscuits for her English friends and they thought they died and went to heaven (same w/blueberry pancakes, which they never have either)<br/>
