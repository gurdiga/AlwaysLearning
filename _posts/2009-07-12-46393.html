<div id="ygrps-yiv-1965635920">I student &quot;taught&quot; in an elementary school that had been designed as open classroom and continued to be called open classroom.  Over the years, though, the school had become more traditional in it&#39;s approach.  So the physical space really didn&#39;t work--imagine trying to run 4 structured classes in a large room with partitions.  The noise level was very high, children were constantly &quot;sneaking&quot; around, under, and above barriers to wave to their friends, etc. etc.  I thought it was pretty humorous..actually... and had a lot of fun in that placement...every day was like herding cats--and the cats had been given quite an advantage!  I met some pretty interesting characters with a lot of unappreciated creativity and ingenuity.   However, many of the teachers were consistently at their wits end and some child was ALWAYS in time out in one form or another.  <br/>
<br/>
It was never the open classroom approach that was non-conducive to learning.  It was the teachers /parents misunderstanding of the open classroom approach and not following through on its philosophy that led to its demise.  Now, when people think of &quot;open classrooms&quot; they think of a big room with partitions to enforce structure.  Of course that doesn&#39;t work.  Duh.<br/>

learning. It was the teachers /parents misunderstanding of the open  <br/>

<br/>
That was a big part of it.  Teachers who didn&#39;t understand it  and  <br/>
didn&#39;t want to understand it were told &quot;this is the new deal,&quot; and  <br/>
they sensibly balked.  Parents who needed grades so they would know  <br/>
whether to reward or punish kids at home (I&#39;m serious) didn&#39;t like the  <br/>
idea of not having letter grades and tests and all.<br/>
<br/>
But on top of that, when it had worked in lab schools, it was partly  <br/>
because the kids were there by choice, or by encouragement at least.   <br/>
They knew they were getting to do something new and cool and  <br/>
different.  When it was foisted on kids who didn&#39;t even want to go to  <br/>
school, with teachers who didn&#39;t understand their new role as  <br/>
facilitators of learning, the kids didn&#39;t do the cool fun stuff.  They  <br/>
said &quot;Do we have to do this?&quot; and now the answer was &quot;No.&quot;  They tore  <br/>
up the new equipment in their boredom.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Now, when people think of &quot;open classrooms&quot; they think of a big  <br/>
room with partitions to enforce structure. Of course that doesn&#39;t  <br/>

<br/>
And it was wrong anyway.  The ideal physical plant was to have been a  <br/>
big open area with several smaller rooms opening off that (&quot;interest  <br/>
areas&quot; I think they called them) and outside areas where kids could  <br/>
play or read or sit or do outside kind of experiments, and places for  <br/>
reading and resting inside with shade or warmth.   Ideally, it would  <br/>
be a strewing festival.<br/>

I attended an open classroom school for grades 3-5 (1972-1975). The<br/>
strongest memories I have of it is spending an enormous amount of time<br/>
with a few kids out in the hallway creating a mural of dinosaurs on a<br/>
sheet of paper rolled out on the hallway floor, and escaping to the<br/>
library to read books and copy maps. I always maintained (jokingly)<br/>
that it ruined me for traditional school. I was there the first years<br/>
it opened. I understand after I left that they put the partitions up<br/>
and it turned into a traditional school.<br/>

Albuquerque has several elementaries built for that purpose.  Keith  <br/>
and I went to do a little presentation to a classroom once, on  <br/>
medieval kids.  The &quot;classroom&quot; we were in looked just like desks in  <br/>
rows, teacher&#39;s desk... but the walls were made of filing cabinets and  <br/>
metal cabinets and shelves on two sides.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634428841">My grade 7 class was in a new, &quot;progressive&quot; school. We had moveable  <br/>
walls for mass instruction, but I don&#39;t remember them being moved as  <br/>
much as they might have planned.<br/>
<br/>
I do remember a math class, where I sat in the back with a math-whiz  <br/>
friend. He spent his time drawing &quot;Die Fledermaus Man&quot; - his ironic  <br/>
version of Batman. I don&#39;t remember learning much math &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
That thought made me laugh!  -  I do date my &quot;you expect me to<br/>
(do/believe) what?&quot; thinking from that time period.<br/>
<br/>
The only bad memory I have of that school is of a substitute teacher<br/>
telling me how rude I was because she caught me reading Call of the<br/>
Wild when I was supposed to be paying attention to her &lt;g&gt;. I&#39;d hidden<br/>
it inside my social studies book. I guess I was supposed to be<br/>
listening to her talk or reading the text book, both of which I found<br/>
pretty boring. It&#39;s kind of funny that&#39;s the title that got me in<br/>
trouble.<br/>
