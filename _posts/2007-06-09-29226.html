<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380080452">Hi there-<br/>
Um, I&#39;m *only* 39 but I grew up on a ranch and we HAD to use scythes to cut grass and lucern for the horses and milking cows; we HAD to use machetes to clear weeds; we HAD to chop wood every evening to heat water and we used knives every day in a million ways, eg. to cut the animals&#39; ears or to butcher meat... all of it at a very young age and I would have been spanked if I cut or hurt myself or anyone else... Ah, the good old days!  I couldn&#39;t wait to go to college so I could grow my nails!!  (btw, now &#39;The Doll Maker&#39; with Jane Fonda is one of my favorite movies because it so reminds me off my mother).  <br/>

them and carried them around.<br/>
