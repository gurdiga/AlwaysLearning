<div id="ygrps-yiv-845289173">I have a yahoo list to announce site news, and I haven&#39;t mentioned that lately.  Rather than join the yahoo list, though, if you want to be in on these occasional announcements, subscribe to the blog (&quot;About Unschooling,&quot; the top link).<br/>

New on the site:<br/>
<br/>
Addition to the &quot;Confidence&quot; page, something Meredith Novak wrote on Facebook. <br/>

<br/>
Principles, something new by Joyce up top, and links added at the bottom. <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/principles">http://sandradodd.com/principles</a><br/>
This page could be a new starting place for the site, with a week&#39;s worth of reading. <br/>
Perhaps too intense for beginners. <br/>
Definitely a time for &quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In light of another spate of arguments for diagnosing and labelling children&#39;s &quot;shiny differences,&quot; Chris Sanders wrote about traits her daughter had that needed time, attention, and unschooling, rather than professional &quot;help.&quot;<br/>
