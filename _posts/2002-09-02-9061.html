&gt; I wrote a post on another list last week which got no response at all, but<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d love to discuss with *someone*!  Your dad may be the answer to the<br/>
&gt; question I pose at the very end, although I&#39;m sure there are other answers.<br/>
&gt; A hit-and-run poster with an addy which included &quot;charter.net&quot; posted,<br/>
&gt; causing quite a stir; my reply follows: <br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; It takes only 3-4 days for the characteristic bond of the Stockholm syndrome<br/>
&gt; to emerge when captor and captive are strangers. After that, research shows,<br/>
&gt; the duration of captivity is no longer relevant.<br/>
&gt; ***<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I realize children are not actually threatened with *death* in kindergarten,<br/>
&gt; but consider the trauma of separation from the parent; those photos of<br/>
&gt; children clinging to mommy as they are taken, crying, aboard a bus that<br/>
&gt; first day of school are a regular feature of September newspapers, and<br/>
&gt; something our society takes for granted as *normal,* a part of growing up.<br/>
&gt; Kids get used to it, right?  (They can&#39;t escape.)  After a month or two,<br/>
&gt; (with compliance from their parents, who continue the school&#39;s program by<br/>
&gt; enforcing homework and sending them back every day) they love school, don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; they?  <br/>
&gt; &lt;snip&gt;<br/>
&gt; The duration of captivity seems to continue into adulthood for some people.<br/>
&gt; I wonder what makes the difference in those of us who reject school?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t quite know how to answer this. I hope I know what you are asking.<br/>
<br/>
My dad taught me to always be a leader and never a follower. And although I <br/>
never considered myself a leader, (I was somewhat of a geek in school. Wait! <br/>
I WAS a geek in school. &lt;g&gt;) I never was a follower. My folks are very <br/>
conservative, upper, upper, middle class, white... My dad made tons of money <br/>
in 70&#39;s through oil. But, he was a naturalist at heart. For as long as I can <br/>
remember, we hunted and fished, and had gardens on the scale of small farms. <br/>
We planted trees all over the land we had when I was a teenager, but cut down <br/>
trees to heat our home too. He taught me to take what I needed, nothing more, <br/>
and put back twice that.<br/>
<br/>
My point? Well, even though I went to public school I always *knew* I had <br/>
options. Not to say I could have come home and said *I&#39;m never going back, <br/>
hows about you learn me at home?* But I knew that if there was a problem at <br/>
school, I could count on my dad to stick up for me, absolutely, positively, <br/>
no matter what. I hated school, I was a loner, had few friends... but it was <br/>
the one area I never felt my dad just abandoned me in. My dad sticking up for <br/>
me and my shirt wasn&#39;t the only time. My dad hated that shirt, it stood for <br/>
just about everything he was against. He also hated my purple hair, my shaved <br/>
head, my earrings, my trench coat, my steel toed combat boots, most of my <br/>
friends, my music, my taste in literature... But he stood up for my rights to <br/>
be the person I was. And that included my right to not be a captive, a <br/>
follower, a public school drone. <br/>
<br/>
Once, in third grade, the teacher tried to use this *positive reenforcement* <br/>
thing with us. We got these big yellow cards and if she caught us being bad, <br/>
she wouldn&#39;t say anything, she would just walk over and punch a hole in it. <br/>
If there were so many punches, we had to sit at our desk with a three sided <br/>
cardboard *cubicle* around us. No one was to talk to us while we had this <br/>
around our desk. We couldn&#39;t see out, unless we looked behind us. Well, I had <br/>
one of these around my desk for almost a week. (I was really bad! &lt;g&gt;) and I <br/>
was bored. I couldn&#39;t participate in the class, I couldn&#39;t see the teacher or <br/>
the board, it was a mess. I was upset, and wrote all over the inside of the <br/>
box. I got caught and was made to stay inside for recess to write sentences <br/>
about not defacing school property. I had to go pee, and the teacher wouldn&#39;t <br/>
let me talk. I kept raising my hand, she ignored me, I stood up and spoke, <br/>
she yelled at me... finally I wet my pants. I was a mess, I was crying and <br/>
very embarrassed. The teacher was yelling about how come I didn&#39;t tell her I <br/>
had to use the bathroom. (HUH??) The kids all came back from recess, everyone <br/>
saw, everyone made fun. So my teacher took me to the office and called my <br/>
house. My dad was home for lunch so he came to the school. He and that <br/>
teacher were in the principals office for a long time. When they came out she <br/>
was in tears, and my dad took me home for the rest of the day. My dad didn&#39;t <br/>
make me ride the bus the next morning, he took me. On the ride to school he <br/>
said two things to me, Never write or draw on something that isn&#39;t yours and <br/>
never ever raise your hand to go to the bathroom, if you have to go, you go. <br/>
When I got to class, my teacher said I was excused from the work I had missed <br/>
while the cubicle was around me. There were no more punch cards and I never <br/>
saw another cubicle around me or any other kid ever again. And I never raised <br/>
my hand to go to the bathroom ever again. <br/>
<br/>
So why do some kids get &quot;caught&quot; in school and never seem to get out and <br/>
others are able to reject it all and come out strong? Somewhere, sometime <br/>
there was someone in their life who had an impact on them, who stood up for <br/>
them, did something to let them know that school wasn&#39;t all there was. Even <br/>
if there wasn&#39;t someone like my dad in the equation, if it was just one <br/>
person who did one small thing way back in third grade... it can and does <br/>
make a difference. <br/>
~Nancy~ who hopes she somehow answered Nancy&#39;s question? (Did I get it <br/>
right?) <br/>

 </span></blockquote>You understood the question, and I appreciate your answer (&quot;right&quot; in your<br/>
case &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
In my case, third grade was also my downfall.  What is it about third grade<br/>
teachers???  At that time, my parents tried very hard to make me go along<br/>
with the system; I&#39;m not sure they ever knew the teacher had pulled my desk<br/>
up against hers, so she could hit my hand with her ruler if I looked out the<br/>
window.  Anyone want to guess why I suck at math?<br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t until many years later my mom started to let her guard down, and<br/>
reveal what she really felt about school.  She&#39;d flunked second grade, and,<br/>
since it was virtually a one-room schoolhouse, had to repeat with the same<br/>
teacher who dug her long fingernails into children&#39;s flesh.  My mom couldn&#39;t<br/>
read, but memorized the passage she&#39;d have to read aloud to escape this<br/>
woman and move up to third grade.  (My mom&#39;s grandparents and extended<br/>
family spoke Norweigen, and the workers in the orange groves surrounding her<br/>
home spoke Spanish; she didn&#39;t have a good grasp of English in second<br/>
grade.)<br/>
<br/>
Mom eventually got to the point where she&#39;d snipe openly about<br/>
&quot;schoolteachers!&quot;  but until then she was a good enforcer of the school&#39;s<br/>
status quo.  Once I got to high school and had a couple of liberal teachers<br/>
(ones who insisted on being called by first names and furnished their<br/>
classrooms with couches, not desks &lt;horrors!&gt; and one who&#39;d even been to the<br/>
Soviet Union!!!!) she changed her tune and harrangued all the time about the<br/>
horrible school.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess her hatred of school did me some good in the long run, though it<br/>
made me pretty unbearable to that teacher with the couches (I think he might<br/>
have been amused by me, come to think of it).  Mom has always been<br/>
supportive of homeschooling, anyway :-)<br/>
