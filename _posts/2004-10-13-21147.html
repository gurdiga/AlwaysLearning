<h4>Virginia</h4>
<time>12 Oct 2004, at  7:56pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-11577820">Hi everyone, <br/>
<br/>
My name is Virginia and I pulled my daughter out of PS right at a <br/>
year ago. Shortly after doing so I was introduced to un-schooling and <br/>
immediately became intrigued with it. I started to get involved with <br/>
a group of unschoolers and have been exploring it every since and <br/>
have taken alot of it to heart. We&#39;ve been having all the ups and <br/>
downs that are expected btw. Including my child appearing that she is <br/>
learning nothing, and doing nothing. Which sometimes I myself wonder <br/>
about. <br/>
<br/>
However, my husband is really making a hard case why he is against <br/>
unschooling and this has been causing problems for us. We&#39;ve actually <br/>
been having some heated arguments on the subject. I have doubts from <br/>
time to time just like everyone else, but I&#39;m not ready to give up on <br/>
unschooling just yet and I&#39;m getting upset with my husband because he <br/>
won&#39;t be more open minded about it. I&#39;ve been all over the place <br/>
trying to find information for my husband because he wants facts <br/>
about unschooling, not anecdotes. <br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t join any groups for unschool dads because he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
belong to message boards where there is a biased slant. I&#39;m very <br/>
frustrated that he won&#39;t at least get on one and start asking <br/>
questions. He is getting advice from people who have never re-<br/>
searched unschooling so I think they are very biased too and are not <br/>
going to always give the best advice or information. <br/>
<br/>
For instance he has spoken with one of his best teachers about it. <br/>
This educator has 25 years experience and Russell has high respect <br/>
for him as an educator. This man told Russell that unschooling was a <br/>
grave mistake. So you can imagine what I&#39;ve been going through every <br/>
since with my husband. <br/>
<br/>
So, that&#39;s why I&#39;m here. I need advice, support, and anything you <br/>
people can give me to help me stay strong and to help me come up with <br/>
convincing arguments. For example: My husand says he was forced to <br/>
learn and he turned out great. Well he did turn out great. He got a <br/>
good education, and makes a lot of money, and is a happy man. So when <br/>
I say he just got lucky, that doesn&#39;t fly at all because obviously <br/>
there are many successful happy productive people in our world who <br/>
had a traditional education with all that entails. <br/>
<br/>
I hope it&#39;s ok that I&#39;ve posted here and apologize if I&#39;m posting <br/>
totally inappropriate stuff on this message board. Thanks in advance <br/>
for all your help.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Virginia</div>

at first didn&#39;t see why I would want something different for our daughter.<br/>
He was never adamantly opposed to my unschooling ideas, and at the time our<br/>
daughter was just a baby -- so the decision was really a long way off.  But<br/>
then I read John Holt&#39;s &quot;How Children Fail&quot;, and when I started to read<br/>
section after section after section to my husband, telling him how this was<br/>
exactly what school had been like for me he started to see a different<br/>
perspective.  He never remembered feeling the way I did about school, but<br/>
he appreciated Holt&#39;s perspective and descriptions about why it doesn&#39;t<br/>
work, and appreciated that we would follow our daughter&#39;s lead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1400838084">&lt;&lt;&lt;I&#39;ve been all over the place <br/>
trying to find information for my husband because he wants facts <br/>
about unschooling, not anecdotes. <br/>
<br/>
He won&#39;t join any groups for unschool dads because he doesn&#39;t want to <br/>
belong to message boards where there is a biased slant.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So he won&#39;t go to the people who are doing it for information, just to<br/>
people who are hostile to it - which is just another bias.<br/>
<br/>
I just posted on another board that using sources hostile to Unschooling for<br/>
your information is like sending someone interested in learning about Wicca<br/>
to a conservative fundamentalist Christian for a definition and description<br/>
of practices. Chances are the information will be negatively biased.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;For example: My husand says he was forced to <br/>
learn and he turned out great. Well he did turn out great. He got a <br/>
good education, and makes a lot of money, and is a happy man. So when <br/>
I say he just got lucky, that doesn&#39;t fly at all because obviously <br/>
there are many successful happy productive people in our world who <br/>
had a traditional education with all that entails.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The vast majority of us had a traditional education. We mostly turned out ok<br/>
too. So what? The people who are *not* particularly successful, happy or<br/>
productive are also primarily products of the same system! <br/>
<br/>
If it helps: what it seems to me that most Unschoolers are doing is trying<br/>
to live in the present, making lives for our children as joyful, successful<br/>
(by their individual definitions) and productive (of happiness) in the<br/>
present as we can. We are not waiting for them to be adults who have &quot;turned<br/>
out&quot; any particular way for their real lives to begin. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to recommend Valerie Fitzenreiter&#39;s book &quot;The Unprocessed Child&quot;<br/>
to you. I recommend it to *you* because Valerie lived a remarkable<br/>
Unschooling life with her dd, Laurie, and a hostile-to-it dh. I would<br/>
recommend it to your dh because Laurie&#39;s academic success is just what a<br/>
pragmatic man is likely to want to hear about. *sigh*.<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t say how old your dd is. Sometimes the publications recommended<br/>
alter depending on the child&#39;s age.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; He won&#39;t join any groups for unschool dads&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Your dh is right where my dh was 6 years ago.  Relax, it will be fine.  He<br/>
is just very concerned about his daughter which is a good thing.<br/>
<br/>
You said that it looks like your daughter isn&#39;t learning anything....and it<br/>
can look like that to people that aren&#39;t in the frame of unschooling yet.<br/>
So you can just imagine what it looks like to your dh.<br/>
<br/>
I would suggest offering your child some outings, activities, projects.  See<br/>
what strikes her fancy.  Would she like to build a playhouse?  Would she<br/>
like to go to the zoo?  Would she like to grow herbs?  Sew a dress?  Just<br/>
ask her and see what interests her.  Then get out and do it.<br/>
<br/>
Sit down, without your daughter, and take a long hard look at what skills<br/>
and learning is happening in that project.  Don&#39;t talk to your daughter<br/>
about it.  Talk to your dh.  Let him see there is learning outside of books.<br/>
<br/>
If he continues to be adamant, buy a curriculum.  Talk to your daughter<br/>
about how Dad is &quot;old fashioned&quot; and wants to do workbooks with her and<br/>
perhaps we could just placate him a bit.  Then hand complete responsibility<br/>
for the curriculum over to Dad.  It won&#39;t take long for him to see how<br/>
ridiculous they can be.  He will get bored, she will get bored, he will skip<br/>
the occassional night and then let it fall to the wayside would be my bet.<br/>
<br/>
From my experience, a lot of men want to tell women how to educate their<br/>
children but they have never done it in the form they are requesting....they<br/>
don&#39;t really know what they are talking about.  It is one thing to be the<br/>
one in school doing a workbook, it is quite another to fuss with your child<br/>
who you love everyday and take responsibility for their doing it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-230610879">It astounds me how much I have forgotten...or didn&#39;t even learn! I earned a<br/>
3.5 gpa in highschool, just enough to get into National Honor Society and no<br/>
more (I can&#39;t even remember now why I wanted in...probably a friend was<br/>
joining). I could have done better, but I didn&#39;t see any reason to expend<br/>
the energy, I didn&#39;t have anything to gain by getting better grades.  I<br/>
didn&#39;t like studying, but knew how to play the game. I was a good student.<br/>
I went to 3 years of college...loved parts of it...a few classes, but mostly<br/>
the social aspect, clubs and organizations. I quit after running out of<br/>
money, I didn&#39;t like it enough to find other ways of funding it.  I have<br/>
learned more since quitting college...much of what I&#39;m sure I received great<br/>
grades for....I knew little of history (I could recite a few dates but had<br/>
no context for most of it), only enough math to do what I needed, I was<br/>
exposed to very little good literature, I couldn&#39;t diagram a sentence if my<br/>
life depended on it (I probably still can&#39;t)...I knew lots of science though<br/>
because that was what I loved. And I took college prep classes! As my kids<br/>
have explored their interests (ranging from drama, Shakespeare, maps, Civil<br/>
War, reptiles....to name a few) I&#39;m amazed at what I don&#39;t know!!!!  So I<br/>
learn right along with my kids.  And in spite of what I didn&#39;t know, I am a<br/>
successful adult, I am on the board of a number of local community<br/>
organizations, I can carry on an intelligent conversation....<br/>

I agree with Nancy that this is a great book.  It&#39;s the scientific basis of a lot of my anti-school opinions.  And it&#39;s pretty short, 102 pages, which is an advantage if you try to get a spouse or other relative to read it.<br/>

<br/>
Frank Smith isn&#39;t a homeschooler at all, he&#39;s a professor of something <br/>
(cognition? psychology of education?  not sure).  He has a couple of books on <br/>
reading, too that would be probably excellent to put into the hands of your husband.<br/>
<br/>
Frank Smith has two things men prize highly:  a penis and a PhD.<br/>
And he couldn&#39;t possibly tell any unschooling anecdotes.<br/>

If there&#39;s a book you read that gave you the &quot;aha&quot; moment on<br/>

math.<br/>
<br/>
SO - you might think about this: Almost all kids go through schools, <br/>
good and bad ones, and MOST people come out of school only <br/>
semi-numerate at best. The vast majority of people come out of school <br/>
wanting to avoid math if at all possible. Many of those have some <br/>
degree of math anxiety and a sizable minority have severe math phobia! <br/>
Is that what your husband wants? To re-create school at home? Why?<br/>

Educational Research Association Annual Meetings in San Diego, last <br/>
April, in which I argued that the best kind of research on <br/>
homeschooling was going to be a case study approach. The reason, in a <br/>
nutshell, is that the entire point of homeschooling is to individualize <br/>
education and unschooling is the most idiosyncratic form of <br/>
homeschooling. Statistical methods are designed to generalize from <br/>
sample data - but that requires the assumption that the sample families <br/>
have commonalities that we can discover. Statistical analysis is the <br/>
discovery of those commonalities. When we have a population <br/>
(unschoolers) which is defined by its diversity, the most effective way <br/>
to &quot;study&quot; them, is to look at individuals, lots of them and get a <br/>
sense of the variety of methods and outcomes possible.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1562462235">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I have a husband who needs hard evidence to get his attention, and I  <br/>
have become VERY CREATIVE and determined to let my kids [all boys 8  <br/>
3/4, 6, 3 1/2 yrs] do what they can when they can, and most importantly  <br/>
to me:  because it is relevant in their lives!!!<br/>
<br/>
we have many minutes of math and science [and everything else] most  <br/>
days, maybe we have hours each day and no minutes other days... for  <br/>
example, when we shop in the store, I ask the kids to read labels and  <br/>
prices, compare sizes/ quantity with unit prices, multiply, divide,  <br/>
add, subtract, you can use math for hours in a store... if we aren&#39;t  <br/>
sure of the price or label, we scan the barcode to check...<br/>
<br/>
at times we go further, I will ask my eldest to look up a recipe in the  <br/>
cookbook, check the ingredients in our house, write a list of  <br/>
ingredients to buy, ask him to find the list items at the store, then  <br/>
he pays the cashier... he helps with the recipe, he loves the whole  <br/>
process!  remember this is not everyday, it is weekly at best, but the  <br/>
tasks can be spread over days...<br/>
<br/>
we are enjoying an explosively good year, after many false starts, a  <br/>
lot of doubt and fear coming from both myself and my husband for 2-3  <br/>
years, we just seemed to &quot;get it&quot;... we made enough mistakes that I  <br/>
knew when things needed to be adjusted from the feeling I had, my  <br/>
husband had no such instinct so I had to trust myself and learn to  <br/>
self-validate... I learned how to state my ideas firmly and stay on  <br/>
track, many habits I would have needed in school I learned 10 years  <br/>
after my last classroom experience [sadly I felt I could get by with  <br/>
minimal effort and had absolutely no regard to context and  <br/>
relevance]...<br/>
<br/>
I say don&#39;t give up because your husband doesn&#39;t agree with you...  <br/>
maybe you too have something to learn in this endeavor... MUST your  <br/>
husband agree in order to TRY unschooling?  I had a *great* education,  <br/>
I learned a lot, I was in the top margin of everything all my life, but  <br/>
I LOVE unschooling MORE than anything I ever got from school... my  <br/>
proudest moments in life came with very little recognition, and my  <br/>
greatest education is learning with my own direction...<br/>

&gt;  wasn&#39;t running interference he would want more than that...say 30  <br/>
&gt; minutes to<br/>
&gt;  an hour every day.<br/>

&gt;    &gt;  &gt; My contention is that even &quot;A&quot; students who study and do all  <br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt;    &gt;  &gt; homework fail to remember the content of the courses before  <br/>
&gt; much time<br/>
&gt;    &gt;  &gt; has passed.  If your husband has an exceptional memory, this  <br/>
&gt; may not<br/>
&gt;  be<br/>
&gt;    &gt;  &gt; true of him.<br/>
&gt;    &gt;<br/>
&gt;    &gt;Hi Nancy,<br/>
&gt;    &gt;<br/>
&gt;    &gt;Yep he is the exception to the rule alright. That&#39;s why it&#39;s so  <br/>
&gt; hard to<br/>
&gt;    &gt;convince him that unschooling is a terrific option.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    My husband is the exception as well.  Not only did he love school,  <br/>
&gt; do well<br/>
&gt;    with the grades, loved taking tests (he would sign up for them just  <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt;    fun), but he also remembers most of what he learned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    But have faith... he was willing to hear what it was like for me in  <br/>
&gt; school<br/>
&gt;    and to consider that not everyone learns like he does.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    He also knows he could have learned just as well without school and<br/>
&gt;    teachers, and often teaches himself whatever he&#39;s interesetd in, so  <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt;  don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;    think he really had the idea that school was the magic deal.  But  <br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt;    might be one important difference... if your dh feels that he  <br/>
&gt; wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt;  have<br/>
&gt;    been able to learn all of the stuff he did without school then it  <br/>
&gt; will be<br/>
&gt;  a<br/>
&gt;    much harder case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    &gt;He will only read one book. So which one is the best one he should  <br/>
&gt; read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;    Could you explain what his objections are again?  I&#39;d be willing to  <br/>
&gt; talk<br/>
&gt;    with my husband about them and see if he has any recommendations.<br/>

How does Caitlin feel about it? In the interest of stalling while he is able<br/>
to slowly see it &quot;working&quot; in other areas, is there some aspect of math, or<br/>
math-like activity that really appeals to her that would, as you say,<br/>
appease him? I&#39;m sorry I forget how old you have said she is. <br/>
<br/>
In terms of statistics, there is that one woman who was/is undertaking that<br/>
pretty comprehensive survey - I wonder how that is going, and what the<br/>
results are so far. Anyone recall the link to her site?<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t there some anti-pushing math (or anti early academics) studies and<br/>
statistics we can find somewhere to help him feel better about relaxing the<br/>
math push?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1112042435">Paula Rothermel from the University of Durham has found that there is <br/>
statistically no difference in educational attainment in families <br/>
that used curriculum versus families that followed a more child-led <br/>
or child autonomous approach.  Not specifically termed unschooling, <br/>
but suggestive nonetheless.  Her most recent paper, which is 2 years <br/>
old is here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.rothermel/Research/Researchpaper/BERAworkingp">http://www.dur.ac.uk/p.j.rothermel/Research/Researchpaper/BERAworkingp</a><br/>
aper.htm  <br/>
There is also a study done by Lawrence M. Rudner which states: <br/>
<br/>
          There is no significant difference in the mean composite <br/>
scaled scores of home school students enrolled in a full-service <br/>
curriculum and home school students not so enrolled. As shown in <br/>
Table 3.7, the means are quite close at all grade levels (F <br/>
enrollment=.24; df=1,9750; n.s.). <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
This is probably less useful, but again suggests that it isn&#39;t the <br/>
presence of a curriculum that is producing results for homeschooled <br/>
children.  That study is here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://epaa.asu.edu/epaa/v7n8/.">http://epaa.asu.edu/epaa/v7n8/.</a>  <br/>
Possibly the amount of money spent on home educational tools may be <br/>
of use to him.<br/>
<br/>
There is very little out there on homeschooled outcomes and far less <br/>
on the efficacy of any given homeschooling method.  The real problem <br/>
it would seem is that he is unwilling to trust your feelings and your <br/>
research.  Maybe that needs to be what you talk about.  If he is <br/>
resistant to unschooling there is very little that you will be able <br/>
to produce to change his mind in the short term.  Take Robyn&#39;s <br/>
suggestion and print out a bunch of posts and Sandra&#39;s articles and <br/>
get them bound at Kinkos.  Leave printouts in the bathroom with no <br/>
other reading material at hand. Strew ideas about, point out how much <br/>
they know or have explored about various different things. Get <br/>
subscriptions to different magazines like Live Free Learn Free and <br/>
leave them laying around.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t imagine having to fight over the basic idealogy of <br/>
education.  David and I have had discussions about food freedoms and <br/>
television freedoms, but he was always willing to give my ideas a <br/>
go.  Nothing is permanent and if they didn&#39;t work we could always <br/>
change what we were doing.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope something clicks.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmmm, then I don&#39;t think one book will help you.  I like some of the other<br/>
advice that you&#39;ve received (along w/ some of the studies.)  Which gives me<br/>
another idea all together for you... don&#39;t call it unschooling.  You can<br/>
call your homeschooling method whatever you want, as long as you know it&#39;s<br/>
the right method for you and Caitlin.  Since he has attached a huge issue<br/>
to the term unschooling, then call it something else.... like eclectic<br/>
child-led learning.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He insists that we have a schedule for Caitlin at the very least 15<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, this can be really easy to do; math can be found in many places<br/>
(stores, games, cooking.)  Some homeschoolers need to keep logs for their<br/>
state requirements.  I know Sandra has a link that talks about how to do<br/>
this as an unschooler.  Whether or not you are required to do it, you might<br/>
want to consider doing something like this for your husband&#39;s benefit.  It<br/>
really shouldn&#39;t be too hard to show him how many hours you are actually<br/>
&quot;doing math&quot;, as well as other subjects that he might be concerned about.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t recall how old Caitlin is, or how long she was in and then out of<br/>
school.  Could it be that she is still deschooling?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What about pointing out those things that you and your husband have  learned <br/>
outside of school.  My husband is 100% for unschooling but in just  thinking <br/>
now I can think of everything we learned when we wanted to build our  own deck <br/>
(materials, size, footings, design, etc.) and that led to  landscaping and <br/>
more learning, gardening (soil testing, watering or not, finding  areas that get <br/>
the most sun, different styles of gardens, etc.).  And most  recently raising <br/>
chickens for eggs.  Those are things that neither of us  had done before, we <br/>
did lots of reading, talking to people that had done these  things.  Going <br/>
around the neighborhood and looking at neighbors decks and  gardens, so many <br/>
different techniques, materials, etc., to choose from.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just so much learning that has happened outside of school. And so  little of <br/>
the school stuff that I actually remembered.  <br/>
 <br/>
Just a thought, if he isn&#39;t a reader maybe making it more personal will  give <br/>
him something to think about.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>What a tough spot to be in.  Why not play &quot;Let&#39;s make a deal&quot;?  What about<br/>
him giving you a year to show that your daughter will make &quot;progress&quot;, after<br/>
all that is all the schools hope for?<br/>
<br/>
During that year, you will keep a log (not involving your daughter in any<br/>
way) of everything your daughter is learning.  Sit with her while she<br/>
watches tv. Try to pick out information from even &quot;fluff&quot; shows that is<br/>
probably new to your daughter. Do fun stuff.  Play.  Explore.  Go new<br/>
places.  And keep a record.<br/>
<br/>
If at the end of the year, he is not satisfied that she has learned, then<br/>
you will be willing for HIM to provide her a curriculum of sorts and for HIM<br/>
to work with her on it.<br/>
<br/>
But he has to give you a year of being off y&#39;all&#39;s back about it.  What do<br/>
you think?<br/>
<br/>
For us, it helped when I reminded dh that I loved our kids and would never,<br/>
ever do something that I thought wasn&#39;t in their best interests.  I asked<br/>
him to trust me....and he did.<br/>

&gt;   &gt;convince him that unschooling is a terrific option.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   My husband is the exception as well.  Not only did he love school, do<br/>
well<br/>
&gt;   with the grades, loved taking tests (he would sign up for them just for<br/>
&gt;   fun), but he also remembers most of what he learned.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   But have faith... he was willing to hear what it was like for me in<br/>
school<br/>
&gt;   and to consider that not everyone learns like he does.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   He also knows he could have learned just as well without school and<br/>
&gt;   teachers, and often teaches himself whatever he&#39;s interesetd in, so I<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t<br/>
&gt;   think he really had the idea that school was the magic deal.  But this<br/>
&gt;   might be one important difference... if your dh feels that he wouldn&#39;t<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt;   been able to learn all of the stuff he did without school then it will<br/>
be<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt;   much harder case.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt;He will only read one book. So which one is the best one he should<br/>
read.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;   Could you explain what his objections are again?  I&#39;d be willing to talk<br/>
&gt;   with my husband about them and see if he has any recommendations.<br/>
