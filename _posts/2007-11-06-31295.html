<div id="ygrps-yiv-555178838">There&#39;s a good possibility we will be coming for a visit (5 - 7 days maybe  a <br/>
couple more) to Wilmington the last week of November and wanted to know about <br/>
 the possibility of meeting up with some RU-ers from that area. DH is working <br/>
 down there and we&#39;ll be staying with him in his hotel and have free days and <br/>
the  weekend to explore and have fun! The boys (8 & 3) and I have never been <br/>
to  North Carolina and would love to meet up with someone or have someone show <br/>
us  the sights or just some suggestions of what&#39;s good to do. Folks are <br/>
welcome to  e-mail me offlist: Sanguinegirl83 @  aol.com<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
