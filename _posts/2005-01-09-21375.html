<div id="ygrps-yiv-343754844">My neighbor complained that his issue of Science News hasn&#39;t arrived.   He <br/>
has a theory. He thinks the substitute mail carrier is a fundamentalist who  is <br/>
losing mail on purpose if it supports evolution.<br/>
 <br/>
My neighbor is getting old and crazy.<br/>
 <br/>
But it did remind me of Science News.  I wouldn&#39;t recommend it as  anything <br/>
resembling curriculum/text/assignments, but I would highly recommend it  as <br/>
bathroom reading or something to have in the car to read at redlights or in  <br/>
waiting rooms or...<br/>
 <br/>
The articles are short, it comes every week, and if anything looks  <br/>
interesting there&#39;s the internet to find out more or see photos or read the  commentary <br/>
of others who are interested in new developments in science.<br/>
 <br/>
If a mom feels unsure about science and what all it can be or touch upon,  <br/>
this might be a good thing for her to read and maybe bring the good parts up in  <br/>
conversation with the family.  We got it years ago, and maybe we should  <br/>
again, but not right now.  Christmas wiped us out, and two car repairs, and  ...   <br/>
But it&#39;s a pretty cool small magazine.<br/>

  Robert Krampf&#39;s Experiment of the Week<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
This Week&#39;s Experiment - #405 Microwave Hot Spots<br/>
<br/>
Greetings from Sarasota, Florida.  I will be here all week, doing more<br/>
science shows for Florida Power and Light.  Then I head home!  After <br/>
months on the<br/>
road, it will be wonderful to be home, even if it is only for a couple <br/>
of<br/>
days.  Then I am heading back to Memphis to celebrate the holidays with <br/>
my family. <br/>
<br/>
After last week&#39;s experiment, I had quite a bit of chocolate laying <br/>
around,<br/>
so I looked for other experiments to try with it.  It will help show <br/>
why most<br/>
microwave ovens have a turntable to rotate the food.  You will need:<br/>
<br/>
a large, flat chocolate bar<br/>
a paper plate<br/>
a rope<br/>
a microwave oven<br/>
<br/>
Open the microwave oven and remove the turntable, if it has one.  We do <br/>
not<br/>
want the chocolate to move as we are heating it.  Place the chocolate <br/>
on the<br/>
paper plate.  We are using paper because some regular plates get hot in <br/>
a<br/>
microwave oven.  That would interfere with our experiment.<br/>
<br/>
Place the plate with the chocolate into the oven.  Be sure that it will <br/>
not<br/>
be moved by the center spindle as it turns.  Set the timer for about 10 <br/>
seconds<br/>
and start the oven.  Watch carefully as the oven runs, to be sure that <br/>
the<br/>
chocolate is not moving.  After 10 seconds, look at the chocolate, but <br/>
do not<br/>
move it.  Do you see any melted spots?  If not, then cook it for <br/>
another 5<br/>
seconds and check again.  Continue cooking for 5 seconds at a time <br/>
until you see<br/>
melted spots in the chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Carefully examine the chocolate, being careful not to burn your finger <br/>
on the<br/>
melted candy.  Why did some parts remain cool, while others got hot <br/>
enough to<br/>
melt?  It does not mean that there is anything wrong with your oven.  <br/>
All<br/>
microwave ovens work that way.  To cook your food, the microwave oven <br/>
produces<br/>
something called a standing wave.  Since it is easier to make one than <br/>
to<br/>
describe one, lets produce our own standing wave.<br/>
<br/>
Tie one end of a rope to a doorknob or some other stationary object.  <br/>
Move<br/>
several feet away and take up the slack in the rope.  Jerk the rope <br/>
quickly to<br/>
the side and watch as it produces a wave that moves along the rope.  <br/>
Notice how<br/>
the wave moves from your hand towards the other end.  Next, shake the <br/>
rope<br/>
quickly from side to side.  Watch the pattern of the rope as you shake <br/>
it faster<br/>
and slower.  Watch for the point where the waves seem to stop moving <br/>
away<br/>
from you.  At that point, you will notice that you have several waves <br/>
in the<br/>
rope, separated by points on the rope that are hardly moving at all.  <br/>
When you<br/>
reach that pattern you have produced a standing wave.<br/>
<br/>
Your microwave oven produces standing waves of microwave energy.  At the<br/>
points where the wave is at its highest, you get the most heat.  At the <br/>
points<br/>
where the wave is hardly moving, things stay cool.  Turning the food <br/>
moves these<br/>
points around, helping the food cook more evenly.<br/>
<br/>
Be aware that melted chocolate can get very hot.  Do not touch it with <br/>
your<br/>
skin.  As a safety precaution, mix the melted chocolate with something <br/>
cold,<br/>
such as vanilla ice cream.  Add some chopped nuts and then dispose of it<br/>
properly.<br/>
<br/>
Have a wonder filled week. <br/>
