What do people think of companies that prey on new home-schoolers, trying to<br/>
convince them that their kids wont learn unless they spend $$$$$ on a sparkly new<br/>
curriculum? And why do people fall for it?<br/>

<br/>
Many of them are Christian homeschooling families supporting their desire to <br/>
stay home and homeschool their own kids.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And why do people fall for it?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because in some ways, school works really well!!  <br/>
It makes you think you&#39;re indebted to them for what you know.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Isn&#39;t this just plain and simple corporate greed? Prey on the fears of the<br/>
fearful. Even the slightest doubt gets amplified once someone points it out.<br/>
People fall for it because after they have done all they can do to create<br/>
the best learning environment they can there is still some little doubt.<br/>
Then these swindles oops, I mean advertisements, say that essentially all<br/>
you have to do is spend money (with them) and everything will be alright. It<br/>
becomes authority of the new homeschoolers own choosing. Spend money on all<br/>
the answers in this box = all problems (and doubts) solved.<br/>
<br/>
They have yet to free themselves to become their own authority.<br/>
