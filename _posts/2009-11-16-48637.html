<div id="ygrps-yiv-20137800">Hello Everyone!<br/>
I would like to thank you all very much for your input on my previous <br/>
questions about finances, television, etc, that Sandra posted for me.  <br/>
I&#39;ve been reading... and that more I read of your responses, then more I <br/>
realize that I didn&#39;t say what I meant AT ALL!!  Its amazing how we have <br/>
little problems, little difficulties in day-to-day living, and somehow I <br/>
end up trying to &#39;encapsulate&#39; them, to get an idea across quickly, <br/>
shortly, and instead I end up making generalized, or untrue statements <br/>
that I don&#39;t even agree with on further reflection.  When I was writing <br/>
about the &#39;junk&#39; on TV, and &#39;junk&#39; food... I was referring to very <br/>
specific aspects of TV, in my own mind, from my own experience watching <br/>
very particular shows.  I can see it sounded like I was referring to all <br/>
TV, making a judgement, and that wasn&#39;t my intention.  When I wrote &#39;we&#39; <br/>
statements, I think I was thinking of my husband and I, and not <br/>
including my children, but that says something about me, to not include <br/>
my children in statements that reflect the reality of our family <br/>
choices!  Instead of rewriting what I wrote, in the way that I meant <br/>
it... I&#39;m just going to start asking real questions, based on real <br/>
difficulties I encounter as we try to move from the baby/toddler level <br/>
of parenting to the 3 years old and up age.  I read a lot when my 3 year <br/>
old was a baby, I had so much more time, but my mind was applying it to <br/>
babies, not toddlers or preschoolers (is there another word for this age <br/>
group that does not involve schooling?), and I think I need to <br/>
re-evaluate my preconcieved ideas about this age, so as to be the kind <br/>
of parent I was planning to be. <br/>
<br/>
And now my mind has blanked, about the real issues.  So please, stay <br/>
tuned... hopefully I&#39;ll remember some of what I think about when I&#39;m <br/>
nursing and can&#39;t get to the computer to write it down! <br/>
Thank you,<br/>
Shira</div>
