LAWRENCE, Mass. (Aug. 3) - This city&#39;s superintendent of schools, who <br/>
recently put two dozen teachers on unpaid leave for failing a basic English <br/>
proficiency test, has himself flunked a required literacy test three times.<br/>
<br/>
Wilfredo T. Laboy called his failing scores ``frustrating&#39;&#39; and <br/>
``emotional.&#39;&#39; He blamed his performance on a lack of preparation and concentration, as <br/>
well as the fact that that Spanish is his first language.<br/>
<br/>
``It bothers me because I&#39;m trying to understand the congruence of what I do <br/>
here every day and this stupid test,&#39;&#39; Laboy told The Eagle-Tribune of <br/>
Lawrence in a story published Sunday.<br/>
<br/>
``What brought me down was the rules of grammar and punctuation,&#39;&#39; Laboy <br/>
said. ``English being a second language for me, I didn&#39;t do well in writing. If <br/>
you&#39;re not an English teacher, you don&#39;t look at the rules on a regular basis.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
State Education Commissioner David P. Driscoll said he is aware of Laboy&#39;s <br/>
troubles with the test, but would not say how many chances Laboy would be given <br/>
to pass or what the consequences of another failure could be.<br/>
<br/>
He said Laboy was doing an excellent job leading the district, and is getting <br/>
more time to prepare for the test. But he added, ``He&#39;s going to have to <br/>
pass. ... The situation will only get serious if he goes much longer without <br/>
passing.&#39;&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Since 1998, all Massachusetts educators - from teachers to superintendents - <br/>
have had to pass the Communications and Literacy Skills Test, which measures <br/>
basic reading and writing skills, including vocabulary, punctuation, grammar, <br/>
spelling and capitalization.<br/>
<br/>
Laboy, who receives a 3 percent pay hike this month that will raise his <br/>
salary to $156,560, recently put 24 teachers on unpaid administrative leave because <br/>
they failed a basic English test</div>

paragraph to paragraph. It was quite uplifting in a perverse sort of way. But I think <br/>
it says volumes for not only testing, but for personal expectations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-611458329">I wish what it meant was that they would see that grammatical skill doesn&#39;t <br/>
make one a good PE teacher, or math teacher, or coach, or art teacher, or music <br/>

<br/>
<br/>
it might not even make one a good English teacher.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible for a person to answer questions and ace a test without having <br/>
a clue how to put that information to practical use.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m afraid instead of looking at a new way to heal their wounds, they will <br/>
hire tutors to teach to the test, so that an expensive bandaid is put over a <br/>
misguided belief.<br/>
<br/>
There are people who write excellently well (technically speaking) and have <br/>
not one blessed thing to say.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>No, what is MEANS is that testing is stupid! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
<br/>
And he who lives by the test may DIE by the test!  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m wondering whether this will actually *go* anywhere. Will they quit <br/>
testing the superintendents? the teachers? the children? Where will it actually <br/>
lead?<br/>
<br/>
Dead end. Into a dead end. Because they can&#39;t see the inanity and insanity of <br/>
testing.<br/>

<br/>
It will lead to them complaining about their own educations, and asking for <br/>
more money to make sure the current batch turns out better.<br/>
<br/>
The whole system has become a gigantic money syphon, and there&#39;s no breaking <br/>
the suction.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s really funny. This morning there was an AOL news piece about whether <br/>
teachers earn too much money (considering the short days and only 180 <br/>
days/year).<br/>
<br/>
Then there was a &quot;sound off&quot; bit for folks to write in with their opinions on <br/>
the subject.<br/>
<br/>
One guy complained that here he was with a master&#39;s degree, teaching school, <br/>
and only earning in the low 30&#39;s. *I&#39;m* thinking that he might should have <br/>
spent a little more time researching his chosen field and its earning potential.  <br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
ONE post (out of the 130 I read) said how wonderful the children are. The <br/>
rest slammed the kids and/or the parents. &quot;If you walked a mile in MY shoes&quot;, <br/>
&quot;Spend a week in MY classroom&quot;,....  <br/>
<br/>
They all seemed to think that they deserved more because of what they have to <br/>
put up with---as if THEY have no choice. Yet the ones that TRULY have no <br/>
choice should sit down and behave and BE TAUGHT!  <br/>
