I found it looking for a particular image from Super Mario Brothers 3  <br/>
for an article on how my kids learned math that I wrote for a German  <br/>
parenting magazine.  The translator wrote asking for clarification on  <br/>
something and I figured a picture would help.    Kinda convoluted,  <br/>
but that&#39;s okay. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1203346885">Looks pretty good to me, after a quick review.<br/>
<br/>
Here is their mission:<br/>
&quot;The Mission of the Hardcore Christian Gaming Association is simple.<br/>
We are gamers, we are Christians. We have taken a passion that we have for<br/>
gaming and intertwined it with the passion we have for God. We won&#39;t preach<br/>
at you, we won&#39;t &quot;convert&quot; you (unless you want j/k) and most of all we<br/>
won&#39;t discriminate against you for your beliefs.<br/>
We are a refuge for gamers whether you are Christian or not. We are here to<br/>
provide anyone with the accountability, knowledge and equipment they need to<br/>
be successful in the gaming world without losing their witness.  We have<br/>
bible studies, prayer meetings, donations and great fellowship<br/>
opportunities! Come join us here and get to know other passionate gamers.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I read the review of The Orange Box for 360.  Pretty thorough review.<br/>
They rate the games on originality, gameplay, fun, graphics, and replay<br/>
value.<br/>
Then list the positives and  negatives and warnings (language, violence,<br/>
gore)<br/>
The most unique aspect is their listing of the game&#39;s &quot;spiritual content&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Here is their Warning Label for Orange Box and then its Spiritual Content -<br/>
........<br/>
Warning Label: Violence abounds- humans and aliens, with a fair amount of<br/>
blood and alien gore. A bit much for the kiddies. Some mild language and<br/>
alcoholic references.<br/>
<br/>
Spiritual Content: None directly referencing God or the devil, but some<br/>
alien beings and zombie-like enemies appear demonic in the literary sense.<br/>
An apparent Russian Orthodox priest who has gone a little crazy slays<br/>
creatures in one town, referring to them as his &#39;flock&#39;.<br/>
<br/>
....................<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t be using their site for their bible studies or prayer meetings,<br/>
but I&#39;d check it out for other game reviews.]<br/>
My son doesn&#39;t really like much blood & gore in his games.<br/>
It is pretty easy to find that info in their reviews...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As far as I can see it is a site aimed at young adult gamers whose numbers <br/>
according to a self generated poll seem to be in the large majority ahead of <br/>
a smaller group of teens. There seems to be a lot of discussion of <br/>
scriptures in the blogs. There are discussions about Christian living in the <br/>
forums, some of which shows some muddy thinking and irrational fears (IMO) <br/>
like in a Harry Potter thread that parents should &quot;really talk through the <br/>
differences between HP sorcery and real life sorcery&quot;. !! Naturally it&#39;s not <br/>
a place for finding real information about Pagan practices. Apparently there <br/>
has been some hateful speech, because a notice has been put up threatening <br/>
more moderation, but I didn&#39;t see any in my fairly focussed thread title <br/>
looking.<br/>
<br/>
There is a thread about whether games are &quot;too violent&quot; and while there are <br/>
variances in opinion, the most common theme seems to be the fairly <br/>
traditional &quot;not too violent for mature/adult gamers - check the age ratings <br/>
before letting the kids play&quot;. So rather conventional.<br/>
<br/>
I tried searching &quot;parenting&quot; and &quot;children&quot; but the search engine only <br/>
works on keywords so it was tough to discover threads. I went through a <br/>
bunch of pages of post headings before eventually quitting. In the end I <br/>
didn&#39;t find any threads dealing with allowing or encouraging or relaxing <br/>
about or forbidding children&#39;s gaming, other than the the violence thread - <br/>
but I only perused for a couple of hours.<br/>
<br/>
As far as the reviews are concerned, they seem well written and thoughtful <br/>
to me! They focus on the gameplay and the quality of the graphics and the <br/>
level of fun and difficulty. If it weren&#39;t for the name of the site, I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have thought &quot;Christian&quot; if only reading the reviews.<br/>

<br/>
Right.  Clearly.<br/>
<br/>
My hope was that some who had time and interest could do a kind of  <br/>
review of some aspects of it for the benefit of myself (deciding  <br/>
whether to link it from<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/videogames">http://sandradodd.com/videogames</a> )<br/>
<br/>
and others who might want to go and read if they hear from others  <br/>
what the benefit is.  Maybe whether it&#39;s worth sharing with  <br/>
conservative relatives who hate video games but love Jesus.... just  <br/>
general info about what the depth of it is.  I saw the surface.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; conservative relatives who hate video games but love Jesus.... &gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My thought on this is that if you have younger kids, this site is not going <br/>
to help your relatives relax, but rather give them ammunition towards the <br/>
idea that gaming should be kept for when the kids are older or even grown up <br/>
entirely, and in any event in the meantime rigidly controlled to appropriate <br/>
age level content. For older teens, possibly yes in showing that it is <br/>
possible to enjoy gaming and still be a good Christian.<br/>
<br/>
There was some debate over the accuracy of the ratings for some games <br/>
although overall there seems to be a relatively high level of trust in the <br/>
MSRP ratings system, with the debate leaning to the conservative. EG if it <br/>
says T for Teen, many forum users are likely to think it should really be M, <br/>
and restricted to a point. No one seems to think the ratings system is too <br/>
tough on games. However I couldn&#39;t find any posts suggesting that younger <br/>
gamers might be able to make their own decisions about the appropriateness <br/>
of the content.<br/>

I&#39;ve had a bit of a look through the site and as a Christian I give it<br/>
a high recommendation.  I think it would be wonderful if you included<br/>
it in your video games page, because a lot of christians would usually<br/>
tend to look at sites like Focus on the Family, which are much further<br/>
down the conservative line.  I think a site like this one is great for<br/>
showing that you really can be a Christian and enjoy hard core gaming.<br/>
 It&#39;s a refreshing change and a helpful resource.<br/>
<br/>
One quote from one of the articles:  &quot;I don&#39;t condone censorship...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
All in all, I think it would be worthwhile including on your webpage.<br/>
