<br/>
I&#39;m so jealous of you.  I would love to move farther out.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds like you have a lot of work to do.  Is it possible the kids feel<br/>
like they are getting the short end of the stick on attention?  I read about<br/>
a family of homesteaders (wish I could remember their names) and they<br/>
divided the day into 4&#39;s.  Four hours to do chores, four hours to play and<br/>
enliven themselves, four hours to make the world a better place.  Just a<br/>
thoght.<br/>

Would this be Helen and Scott Nearing?<br/>

includes names that people far beyond MA will recognize (Thoreau, Walden<br/>
Pond, Paul Stookey) and then see who it&#39;s benefiting :-)<br/>

&gt; For anyone you know who may be interested...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods invites you to a special intimate<br/>
&gt; evening of acoustic guitar and song with Noel Paul Stookey. Monday, November<br/>
&gt; 3rd at 8:00 p.m. at The Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods 44 Baker Farm,<br/>
&gt; Lincoln, MA<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Best known as &quot;Paul&quot; of Peter, Paul, and Mary for over 40 years, Noel Paul<br/>
&gt; Stookey&#39;s songs span the spectrum from &quot;I Dig Rock And Roll Music,&quot; his 60&#39;s<br/>
&gt; satire on pop trendiness,to one of the best loved solo records, &quot;The Wedding<br/>
&gt; Song,&quot; to his call for human rights in &quot;El Salvador.&quot; Stookey is also the<br/>
&gt; founder of the Public Domain Foundation that receives and distributes the<br/>
&gt; royalties of the &quot;The Wedding Song&quot; to charity.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This will be a very special concert, just Noel and his guitar, in a room with<br/>
&gt; less than 100 people, a chance to say hi, and a night not to be missed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tickets are $35. Proceeds benefit the Scott and Helen Nearing Papers, a<br/>
&gt; collection of the Thoreau Institute at Walden Woods.  Seating is limited.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; To charge your reservation, please call the Walden Woods Project at (781)<br/>
&gt; 259-4703.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope you can join us!<br/>
