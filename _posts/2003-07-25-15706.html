<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980903807">Hi All,<br/>
I just wanted to share about a book my boys and I are reading.  It&#39;s _Boy_ by Roald Dahl.  My boys and I are big Dahl fans and noticed this one at the library.  For those that are not familiar, it is a collection of stories that Roald remembers from his childhood.  It&#39;s not quite an autobiography....Dahl states in the beginning that an autobiography &quot;is usually full of all sorts of boring details.&quot;  And that he would never write a history of himself.  :o)  Some of the stories are funny, some sad and some just gross.<br/>
<br/>
I have been reading it at night to my boys and they can never stop at one chapter...sometimes not even 2 or 3.  Last night we read about a surgery that Dahl had when he was 8 or 9 and my boys asked me to read that part 3 times!  They love the photos of Dahl and his siblings as children, the houses and schools (they were mortified by the idea of boarding school), pictures of Dahl&#39;s handwritten letters to his mother, etc.  We have even been caught looking at the large map on the wall at 11:00 at night...looking for Norway and England.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone that is a Roald Dahl fan, this book is a must if you haven&#39;t already read it.  I would love to hear from anyone else that has read the stories.  It has sparked so many questions and conversations for us.<br/>
<br/>
Namaste,<br/>

Me, too!  The first thing that I recall that paved my way to<br/>
homeschooling was reading the Narnia series as a child and being<br/>
appalled at the idea of sending children away to boarding school.  It&#39;s<br/>
the first step I can recall on my happy unschooling journey.<br/>
