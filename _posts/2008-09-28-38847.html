<div id="ygrps-yiv-1596636606">I don&#39;t have any experience with children wanting to lose weight... <br/>
but I used weight watchers a few years ago when I wanted to lose a few<br/>
pounds.  <br/>
<br/>
Certainly it&#39;s not for everyone but, I found it very informative and<br/>
helpful.  It helped me learn to cook better, choose healthier<br/>
ingredients, and pay attention to what I&#39;m putting in my body.  I&#39;m<br/>
one of those people who never seems to lose my appetite under any<br/>
conditions.  LOL  I learned a lot about food through weight watchers<br/>
online.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway...  I still use it for the recipes, honestly, I&#39;ve never not<br/>
like any recipe I had chosen.  <br/>
<br/>
I think its a nice program compared to whats out there.  It&#39;s very<br/>
balanced.  I successfully lost about 20lbs.  Then I got pregnant.  LOL  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-903908660">WW pricy? IT is $10 a month!<br/>
 At 15 I don&#39;t think any diet is the solution, even weight watchers( and I have done them and like it).<br/>
Maybe more exercise. More fun things like hiking,  biking, or anything they like to do.<br/>
Offer lots of low calorie healthy and yummy stuff for them all the time. Have them available and easy to get.<br/>
Don&#39;t say anything when they eat something people consider fattening.<br/>
Cows can gain weight eating only grass. It is all about how much you burn.<br/>
My DH can eat 5000 calories a day or more and loose weight when he is training ( lots of cookies and candy bars).<br/>
The worse thing they can feel is guilt when eating something.<br/>
A question:<br/>
Do you talk about weight in you house? Do you complain about yours or are you always talking about food and weight gain, what is fattening what it is not?<br/>
IF you do STOP It right now.<br/>
It does a lot of damage and I can go on forever talking about it but I am sick today and I got to play with my kids.<br/>
At 15 a lot of kids are getting ready to go and have a huge growth spurr and need the extra pounds.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi --<br/>
<br/>
I lost 85 pounds on WeightWatchers and now work for them.<br/>
<br/>
WW eliminated the children/teen program a few years ago because  <br/>
studies showed they really didn&#39;t work - they were not good for kids  <br/>
and teens.<br/>
<br/>
We currently don&#39;t allow kids under 17 to join unless they have  <br/>
permission from their doctor.<br/>
<br/>
There is a brand-new program for families that is being sort of  <br/>
&quot;tested&quot; in the next month or so at a few locations. The new program  <br/>
is being offered in the form of Family Seminars - the kids don&#39;t go to  <br/>
the seminar, it is for the parents. If you&#39;re interested, contact the  <br/>
closest WeightWatchers meeting location and ask them if they happen to  <br/>
be hosting a seminar. The book they&#39;re giving out at the seminar is  <br/>
brand-new and is called &quot;Family Power.&quot; The book is really more for  <br/>
families with younger children and I don&#39;t see it as being very  <br/>
compatible with unschooling, really. But you could most definitely  <br/>
utilize the ideas in the book if you focus more on support and  <br/>
cooperation and not on parental enforcement.<br/>
<br/>
The ideal, in my opinion, for teens, is to focus on healthy foods,  <br/>
being aware of how hungry you are and only eating enough to &quot;just&quot;  <br/>
satisfy hunger, not more. Don&#39;t eliminate treats, but try to eat lots  <br/>
of bulky foods that fill you up. Choose lower fat versions of foods  <br/>
when it doesn&#39;t compromise taste too much. Choose foods that are low  <br/>
in calories, low in fat, and high in dietary fiber. And get active -  <br/>
try for at least an hour per day of movement - vary what you do, if  <br/>
possible.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to lose weight, but do try to be healthy and active and not  <br/>
eat when not hungry.<br/>
<br/>
When I joined WeightWatchers, it wasn&#39;t like I didn&#39;t already know all  <br/>
about how to lose weight. There is no big secret there - take in fewer  <br/>
calories than you put out. The program is awesome in the way it helps  <br/>
you slowly change the way you eat while still really enjoying food and  <br/>
not feeling deprived at all. But I was suprised how the support in the  <br/>
meetings meant a lot to me - I made friends, we applauded each other  <br/>
and helped each other through setbacks. It was very fun. A number of  <br/>
other people I know also joined after they saw that I was having such  <br/>
success and enjoying it so much. What we all found was that we needed  <br/>
to shop around for a meeting leader we were inspired by - different  <br/>
leaders will be good for different people. I loved my leader who  <br/>
didn&#39;t give &quot;lectures&quot; but acted more as a facilitator encouraging  <br/>
everyone in the meeting to offer ideas. She was very high energy and  <br/>
positive.<br/>
<br/>
Also, being active was really just as important as food. I could  <br/>
barely walk to the corner without my feet aching, at the beginning. So  <br/>
that&#39;s what I did. Then I walked around the block. Every week I did a  <br/>
little more walking and one day I just felt like jogging a bit.  <br/>
Surprised myself, for sure! My knee had been in such bad shape that I  <br/>
was probably going to have surgery - it is fine now.<br/>
<br/>
There are quite a few good books out there right now about weight loss/ <br/>
healthy eating. &quot;Volumetrics&quot; is good. Molly Katzen&#39;s book about  <br/>
eating healthy is great!  It is called &quot;Eat, Drink, & Weigh Less: A  <br/>
Flexible and Delicious Way to Shrink Your Waist Without Going Hungry.&quot;<br/>

but it helped me learn about food choices, cravings, not restricting <br/>
foods, and portion sizes.  My daughter Allie (10) read the materials <br/>
with me and asked a lot of questions.  She made some dietary changes <br/>
because of what we were learning.  Weight Watchers is not a gimmicky <br/>
program and you don&#39;t need to be a member to follow their suggestions.  <br/>
Once you learn their way of eating and exercising, you can follow the <br/>
program without being a member.<br/>
<br/>
Allie is more overweight than she&#39;d like to be, but she understands <br/>
about nutrition and exercise.  She hasn&#39;t yet reached the point where <br/>
she wants to be active in losing weight.  She&#39;s talked with her doctor <br/>
about it as well and he doesn&#39;t make a big deal of it either.  She&#39;s <br/>
still growing and she&#39;s learning about foods in a healthy way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075153373">I think there are some online weight-loss sites and lists where  <br/>
people sign up and someone keeps track of them, aren&#39;t there?  Or  <br/>
where they declare their intent and have witnesses and encouragement?<br/>
<br/>
The first episode of this year&#39;s Desperate Housewives was on last  <br/>
night.  Five years have passed.  Carlos is blind, so that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
temporary.  Gabriella has had two children and gained weight, and her  <br/>
older girl is very pudgy, so that was part of the parenting  <br/>
conflict.  Carlos was saying to leave her alone.  Gabi was being the  <br/>
awful, shaming  mom (not entirely and not at first, but as she was  <br/>
hearing other people&#39;s comments she was putting more pressure on).   <br/>
It will be interesting to see how they play that out, because Gabi&#39;s  <br/>
character has always been THE most vain and thin and stylish of the  <br/>
core group.<br/>
<br/>
So many people watch this in so many countries that it&#39;s bound to  <br/>
have an impact on more than a few families.  The actress does seem to  <br/>
have gained weight for the part, which is interesting too, because  <br/>
she was all over magazines and advertisements for the past couple of  <br/>
years.<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s youthful observation that parenting situation comedies were  <br/>
training films for parents is probably as true of Desperate  <br/>
Housewives as any show ever on.  Each couple has seemed to disagree  <br/>
about how to treat children, and that continued last night in several  <br/>
couples.   It  might be a good tool for someone whose husband is  <br/>
disagreeing (if she has a husband who watches the show I mean &lt;g&gt;).   <br/>
For Holly it will certainly make her a better mom to see some bad  <br/>
strategies played out.<br/>

means a radical unschooler about food, but there are bits of wonderful <br/>
common sense in her books.  I remember that one had some interesting <br/>
information about teens and weight loss.<br/>
<br/>
I just looked on Amazon and she seems to have out a new book about kids <br/>

Perhaps your sons would be interested in doing some research with you <br/>
before they start to do anything formal about eating.  In the meantime, <br/>
you could start some simple things like cutting back on sugar and <br/>
floury stuff and increasing veggies and fruits, and exercising more.<br/>
<br/>
Two other interesting books to look at might be Good Calories, Bad <br/>
Calories, by Gary Taube (very dense), and The Obesity Myth, by Paul <br/>
Campos (quite readable).</div>

 </span></blockquote>Her sons are 15.  I do agree that research might turn up some much needed<br/>
rethinking about eating for people their age.<br/>
<br/>
The huge growth that takes place in those years requires a lot of fuel.<br/>
Such that packets of sugar wouldn&#39;t be out of line from time to time.  Brain<br/>
growth is still going at a tremendous rate and sugar is great brain fuel.<br/>
Any excess sugar consumption converts to fat, the brain food.  The only<br/>
brain food.  And actually it nourishes nerves which is part of that system.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
A certain amount of sugar (way more than a full grown adult needs) is in<br/>
demand during the teen years.  If you research dieting, make sure it applies<br/>
to teen nutrition, not adult nutrition.<br/>
<br/>
And this is just as important for pre-teens and certainly for toddlers and<br/>
infants, hence the comments about the sugar content of breastmilk.<br/>
