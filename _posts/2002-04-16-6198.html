<br/>
He WAS taught specific things in SCHOOL, but he doesn&#39;t think he&#39;s gotten an <br/>
&quot;education&quot; (he doesn&#39;t want his kids to wind up like him---what? UNeducated <br/>
from all that schooling?). He should be avoiding school and anything <br/>
resembling school like the plague!<br/>
<br/>
He doesn&#39;t like to read---SCHOOL did that, not NO school.<br/>
<br/>
Algebra? HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of kids have made it through more than one <br/>
algebra course. What has it done for us---ummm...them? When you HAVE to learn <br/>
it for the test, it&#39;s NOT fun. When you learn thoroughly it because it&#39;s FUN, <br/>
why do you need a test?<br/>
<br/>
You think unschooling&#39;s best. You&#39;ve done your research. He&#39;s not willing to <br/>
study up on Unschooling because why?---he doesn&#39;t like to LEARN anything new? <br/>
He just accepts what the masses/&quot;experts&quot; tell him? Sounds like the &quot;school <br/>
way&quot; seriously damaged his ability to THINK independently.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds as if you have your work cut out for you. Good luck!<br/>

&gt; Subject: RELUCTANT HUSBAND<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Hi All:  I have to come from a different perspective about this subject..<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; position of power... I&#39;m always pretty uncomfortable when I hear grown<br/>
 </span></blockquote>women<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; talking about how they have to &quot;show&quot; &quot;prove&quot; &quot;justify&quot;  or convince their<br/>
&gt; husbands of anything.  My understanding of a healthy marital relationship<br/>
 </span></blockquote>is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; that my husband and I are equal,<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just because my husband and I don&#39;t agree on something doesn&#39;t mean that<br/>
there is an unbalance of power. Or that he is trying to be &quot;my father&quot;.<br/>
There are times when we disagree and he is eventually able to persuade me<br/>
that his position is correct. There are other times when we disagree and I<br/>
am able to convince him that my position is right. And there are other times<br/>
when we disagree that we have a difficult time ever agreeing and we need to<br/>
come to a compromise. Does this mean that there is an unbalance of power? I<br/>
think not!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; If my husband wanted me to prove anything to him, firstly I would have to<br/>
&gt; laugh at him, if he still kept a serious face then he could stay home with<br/>
&gt; the kids and I&#39;ll go out and work and then he can decide what&#39;s going to<br/>
&gt; happen....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>To laugh at someone that disagrees with you when they ask you to support<br/>
your position seems mighty disrespectful and even demeaning to me. I would<br/>
be highly offended and very hurt if my husband treated me that way!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I am married to a man that loves unschooling and cannot imagine doing<br/>
&gt; anything different.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How wonderful for you.  But perhaps that is because he isn&#39;t &quot;doing<br/>
anything&quot;. It sounds to me like you call all the shots and he is content to<br/>
just go along for the ride.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; This is not just a matter of language, but of perception and CONception.<br/>

&quot;2. the knowledge, skill, ability, or character gained through teaching,<br/>

&gt; Subject: WAS RELUCTANT HUSBAND - NOW UNHEALTHY MARRIAGES ARE THE PROBLEM<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t see this as an unschooling issue but an issue with<br/>
&gt; marriage, which is obviously what it is.  For a husband (in this case) to<br/>
&gt; lay down the law about what he wants and yet he&#39;s not the one that&#39;s doing<br/>
&gt; what he wants, he wants someone else to do what he wants (LOL) namely his<br/>
&gt; wife is not healthy.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband knows better than to &quot;lay down the law!&quot; In the nearly 15 years<br/>
that we have been married, I think that he has only tried it once or twice<br/>
and it didn&#39;t work!<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not lucky to have married a man where we have a lot in common, it was<br/>
&gt; planned that I would be married to someone who had the same belief systems<br/>
&gt; as me.  That&#39;s not luck, that&#39;s good dating, interviewing them and then<br/>
&gt; making a decision about whether he was marriage material, which is what he<br/>
&gt; did with me.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband and I have the same basic belief system. That was something I had<br/>
made an absolute neccessity in choosing a husband. However, at the time<br/>
homeschooling of any kind was not an issue. We only decided to homeschool<br/>
after our terrible experiences with the public school district in Clovis, NM<br/>
a few years ago.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; I doubt whether unschooling is the only problem in a household where a<br/>
&gt; husband has an attitude of proof.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband doesn&#39;t have an &quot;attitude of proof&quot;, he just doesn&#39;t understand<br/>
and I need help in giving him info in a manner which will help him<br/>
understand.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>how<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; to give him what he wants.... My question is why?  Why does a wife have to<br/>
&gt; passify her husband&#39;s fears?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>A wife needs to pacify her husband&#39;s fears for the same reason a husband<br/>
would need to pacify his wife&#39;s fears. This isn&#39;t about power, it is about<br/>
partnership and consideration. If it was about power, there wouldn&#39;t be a<br/>
problem about how to educate the kids; I would just do it my way and tell my<br/>
husband to shove off if he didn&#39;t like it or agree with it. I don&#39;t operate<br/>
that way and neither does my husband.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; The only response I can see that makes any<br/>
&gt; sense is Sandra&#39;s in having him go with them to some unschooling events.<br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Also acting like grown women with power instead of giving it away.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why is it that in order to act &quot;like grown women with power&quot; we have to take<br/>
all &quot;power&quot; away from our husbands? I don&#39;t think that is healthy for a<br/>
relationship.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; Also what does this show our children, both boys and girls.  They learn<br/>
 </span></blockquote>the<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; majority of life skills from us and if a wife is running around like a<br/>
&gt; chicken with her head cut off to try and give her husband what he wants it<br/>
&gt; sets up unhealthy relationships and expectations for the kids.  Boys can<br/>
&gt; assume they will be with someone who will constantly  try to please them<br/>
 </span></blockquote>and<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; girls learn it&#39;s their job to please men.... Don&#39;t believe me?  Read some<br/>
&gt; psychological books.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Believe me, I don&#39;t run around doing nothing but trying to please my<br/>
husband! (although I do like to please him. That is also part of marriage,<br/>
each of you trying to please the other) My husband helps tremendously with<br/>
housework, cooking, the kids, etc. (because he wants to please me!) Because<br/>
of our example of working together and trying to please each other, my<br/>
daughter, who is only 18, has managed to find an incredible boyfriend, also<br/>
18, who has no ego hangups about &quot;women&#39;s work&quot; and &quot;men&#39;s work&quot;. And you<br/>
can find psychological books to support any viewpoint that you choose,<br/>
including sex is good for children, so dont&#39; even go there. :-)<br/>

<br/>
Thanks to all who took the time to comment and give input regarding my<br/>
question on how to help my reluctant dh to see the light. They have been<br/>
very helpful. If anyone knows of any short articles about unschooling that<br/>
may be helpful, I could probably get him to read something short. Just not<br/>
an entire book. :-) Also, if anyone knows any unschoolers in the Clovis, NM<br/>
area or the Columbus, MS area, perhaps I could get in touch with them.  We<br/>
don&#39;t have much time left in Clovis, so the Columbus area would be more<br/>
helpful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s a really prevalent attitude.  A couple of years ago my son was <br/>
thinking about trying school.  I went to yak with the principal about how <br/>
they&#39;d handle him, etc.  Almost everything I brought up, got the answer, <br/>
&quot;The important thing is just to get him in here.&quot;  Sigh.<br/>

&lt;&lt; , I would laugh because I don&#39;t have<br/>
 to prove or justify what I&#39;m doing to him.  I&#39;m a grown up and don&#39;t need<br/>
 his permission to do what I want to do.... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not about permission. It&#39;s about respect for the other person.<br/>
And I don&#39;t think anyone would suggest that in a healthy marriage you just do <br/>
whatever you want without discussion with the partner.<br/>
Especially when it comes to children.<br/>
