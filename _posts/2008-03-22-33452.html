<div id="ygrps-yiv-2115208877">Z (8) has always been a fairly regular sleeper, averaging 11 hours a night for several years. Since we&#39;ve been unschooling (over a year) he usually goes to bed when I go to bed (around 10) and wakes up around 9a. <br/>
 <br/>
Lately though he&#39;s been testing his own limits, staying up as late as possible (after 4am) and sleeping in. At first I was cool with this, even happy that he was trying to listen to his body and learn his bodies limits now rather than later. Except that hasn&#39;t been happening. When he stays up late, he doesn&#39;t sleep in long enough to make up the difference. I&#39;ve tried keeping the shades drawn, the house quiet etc but it doesn&#39;t seem to make a difference. I&#39;ve also tried suggesting he do something more relaxing when he first wakes up but that doesn&#39;t usually happen. <br/>
 <br/>
When he doesn&#39;t get enough sleep it&#39;s as if the world is falling down around him. It aggravates his (depression/pessimism/whatever it is mentioned in the other post), he becomes more sensitive to the way things feel (like clothing or tags), he&#39;s cranky and snappy with me or DH or the dogs, he&#39;s prone to break down in tears over something (like if he can&#39;t get something to work the exact way he wants it to). It&#39;s just a mess.<br/>
 <br/>
So I&#39;ve tried several things....at first I tried waiting it out, expecting him to see how the lack of sleep was making him feel. Then I tried discussing what I see, how sleep deprivation affects the body, the common signs and signals of needing more sleep. I&#39;ve even tried not hiding my frustration in hopes of showing him how it affects the rest of the household. No luck. He insists he&#39;s not tired, that he&#39;s getting enough sleep, etc. The other thing is when he has gone several days like this, he gets louder. Then he&#39;s bothering DH who goes to bed at 8p and gets up at 3:30am. (However, the noise level is only occasionally an issue; usually the issue is his mood/demeanor the next day.) <br/>
 <br/>
Once we were able to have an open talk about it and he mentioned that he thought 10p was a good time for him to go to bed and said if we both went to bed and read, then he&#39;d be happy with that. But when it came time to do so, the answer was &quot;I don&#39;t want to; I want to watch/play this.&quot; in which case I&#39;m stuck. Thursday night he picked a bedtime (to be able to wake early enough to do charity work he wanted to do with his Gramma Friday morning) and I needed to remind him of it repeatedly. Last night he also needed to go to bed early to be able to wake in time to do something with his other Grandma today. However last night he used these as examples of how I&#39;m &quot;treating him like a child&quot; by making him go to bed before he wants to.<br/>
 <br/>
Because he gets hyper or sensitive with lack of sleep instead of tired, he says &quot;I don&#39;t feel tired.&quot; With him not interpreting his bodies signals well, I&#39;m wondering how much more reasoning I can do with him. I do not like taking control of this issue but it&#39;s so badly affecting the harmony in the house, that I&#39;m ready to draw the line. DH and I are frustrated with dealing with a crabby child and getting our head bitten off all day. <br/>
 <br/>
Any words of wisdom on how to work this out and bring our household back in harmony? If I should step back, how should I deal with his affected mood? And if I should draw the line, how exactly do I do that in a peaceful way that doesn&#39;t make me look like a controlling parent? Is there another option I&#39;m not seeing?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for advice in this very sticky situation.<br/>

A monster has been created, and not by me, about things I used to say  <br/>
about my kids going to sleep when they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
You shouldn&#39;t feel stuck.   Here&#39;s how I would handle it.<br/>
First priority, your husband&#39;s peaceful sleep.  No one gets to  <br/>
disturb that (infants, maybe).  Moms for short periods when all the  <br/>
kids are asleep, occasionally. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Second, health and peace in the house.  Sleep is a big part of health  <br/>
and peace and people in the family need to get, must get, enough  <br/>
sleep.  &quot;Enough&quot; varies, but &quot;not enough&quot; tends to show.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Thursday night he picked a bedtime (to be able to wake early  <br/>
enough to do charity work he wanted to do with his Gramma Friday  <br/>
morning) and I needed to remind him of it repeatedly. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I would&#39;ve helped set his bed up, made sure others in the family were  <br/>
prepared to take their noise elsewhere, and helped him be ready for  <br/>
bed earlier than the stated time,  help him set his alarm, tell him  <br/>
quietly that it&#39;s only seven or eight hours until then, and set him  <br/>
up to read or listen to music or whatever helps.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However last night he used these as examples of how I&#39;m &quot;treating  <br/>
him like a child&quot; by making him go to bed before he wants to.-=-<br/>
<br/>
And how is he treating you and his dad?  Like a noisy burglar  <br/>
sometimes and like an invading grump sometimes?   Like a deal- <br/>
breaking nuisance?<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s too young to be quiet when others are asleep and too young to  <br/>
arrange to get enough sleep, then he&#39;s too young to make decisions  <br/>
about when to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing maybe you had rules before you were unschooling, and  <br/>
he&#39;s seeing what it feels like to not-follow the rules. I think he&#39;s  <br/>
probably living in a reactionary mode.<br/>
<br/>
You said lately this, and you&#39;ve tried that, but how long are you  <br/>
talking--weeks?  months?<br/>
<br/>
-=-It aggravates his (depression/pessimism/whatever it is mentioned  <br/>
in the other post), he becomes more sensitive to the way things feel  <br/>
(like clothing or tags), he&#39;s cranky and snappy with me or DH or the  <br/>
dogs, he&#39;s prone to break down in tears over something (like if he  <br/>
can&#39;t get something to work the exact way he wants it to). -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not depression/pessimism.  Affecting his mood.  Affecting his emotions.<br/>
<br/>
Pressure and shame won&#39;t help.  Let us know more and maybe we can  <br/>
help you with some ways to disengage in some ways that might help.   <br/>
But in the meantime, if it were me, I would say that the staying up  <br/>
late is wholly contingent on his  being quiet and kind and sweet and  <br/>
peaceful, day and night.  And if he&#39;s staying up past the time he&#39;s  <br/>
really sleepy, then he&#39;s not keeping his deal either.   On the other  <br/>
hand, if he&#39;s been told when to go to bed for all the years up to  <br/>
now, he might not know what sleepy&#39;s really like.   If it&#39;s only been  <br/>
days or weeks, that might be the deal.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-507824688">I&#39;ve struggled with depression over the last 20 years and not sleeping enough ALWAYS adds to it.  Another sign of clinical depression is insomnia -- could this be what he is struggling with?  When this happens to me I feel like I can neither go to sleep or wake up -- it&#39;s a weird, very debilitating, state to be in - and it&#39;s a vicious cycle because nothing is enjoyable because you don&#39;t have the energy to enjoy or do it, and that affects the mind and outlook and anxiety levels.  I would say right now his body chemistry is way out of wack and listening to his body right now would be counter productive.  I agree with Sandra in getting him out of the house, change of scenery, distractions, etc.  When I get to this state also it&#39;s when I KNOW that I need to make some serious diet changes, get some vitamins, or if all else fails, go to the doc for help.   Here&#39;s something I&#39;ve looked into before but never tried for our daughter as she somehow got better with age, but she was<br/>
 never so low that she said she wished she were dead -- that is serious.  Anyway, here&#39;s the link:<br/>

   <br/>
  It&#39;s a natural remedy.  Other things that add to depression/anxiety are sugar and caffeine.  Hoping for the best, Shannon<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1898722176">This is good stuff.  Another thought is when I am in an overwhelmed state (that has lasted days, weeks, or months) I also pick 10p as a bedtime for myself because I know that after that I get REALLY overwhelmed.  Often at 10 I don&#39;t FEEL like going to bed, but I know that it is best for me during these times.  It may just be something he has to do (for himself), for the long-term affect.  Maybe you can encourage him to help him understand that need that his body has (1/2 of us that live here have that need - to go to bed early or suffer with anxiety and feelings of being overwhelmed, the other 1/2 can stay up all night long and be kind and sweet and not suffer for it -- everyone is made different).  Sandra had a lot of good points too.  Kids often don&#39;t listen to their bodies or don&#39;t know what they are listening for -- you can help him see things like &quot;when you cry easily, it means you&#39;re tired&quot; or &quot;when you don&#39;t enjoy being around people it means you need to go to bed a<br/>
 little earlier&quot; -- not as a punishment obviously, but just as that&#39;s what his body may need.   It may be a fun time to learn more about brain chemicals and function with him if he wants.   Shannon<br/>

I&#39;m lacking in practicality.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Reactionary mode fits perfectly. He knows very much he&#39;s unschooling <br/>
and somehow decided that means he makes all his own choices. We did <br/>
have rules before on bedtimes because his school started at 8am. <br/>
Occasionally we would allow him to stay up late for parties or during <br/>
the summer time but not much during the year as it would mess up his <br/>
sleep schedule for school. So he&#39;s tested his personal limits before. <br/>
But before he was usually the kind of kid that would ask to go to bed <br/>
or fall asleep during the fireworks on the 4th of July. <br/>
<br/>
We stopped the mandatory bedtimes almost a year ago. He had some fun <br/>
staying up but has always been such a good sleeper and would choose <br/>
to go to bed on his own. This current situation has been off and on <br/>
for a couple of months (since sometime in January). It&#39;s &quot;on&quot; <br/>
whenever I don&#39;t intervene. But when I do intervene, it causes so <br/>
much stress between the two of us, so I think maybe I&#39;m not handling <br/>
it very well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure what the deal is. He did say something the other day <br/>
along the lines of &quot;Unschooled kids don&#39;t have a bedtime.&quot; So maybe <br/>
he feels like he needs to stay up and push himself past what he <br/>
normally would...to be cool maybe? To differentiate between himself <br/>
and others who go to bed earlier or go to school? I&#39;m not sure on <br/>
this one. But it would make sense as to why he doesn&#39;t seem to see <br/>
his exhaustion. Maybe he&#39;s refusing to see it?<br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem is when I do intervene, he gets really upset. <br/>
That&#39;s when he says I&#39;m treating him like a child, or he&#39;ll say I&#39;m <br/>
not &#39;giving him any respect&#39; or allowing him to make his own choices. <br/>
It&#39;s not as if I&#39;m going Clock-Nazi on him and demanding he be in bed <br/>
at 8pm on the dot. I think at least, I&#39;m handling it nicely, <br/>
explaining what I see and explaining how its affecting others and <br/>
that that is why I&#39;m intervening. But he normally interjects with &quot;I <br/>
won&#39;t stay up as late, I&#39;ll be in a better mood tomorrow&quot; etc and <br/>
then when I stick to a bedtime, he says I don&#39;t trust him. And then <br/>
I&#39;m feeling stuck, unsure of how to explain it to him as not being <br/>
about trust but being about facts. And if I don&#39;t explain it to him <br/>
he gets very upset. He likes to know exactly what is happening, and <br/>
why so not explaining things to him is interpretted like &#39;cuz I said <br/>
so&#39; and doesn&#39;t carry very far over here. But explaining it just gets <br/>
more arguments!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Oh I just meant that as in he deals with depression/pessimistic <br/>
emotions often already and it&#39;s worse when he&#39;s tired. <br/>
<br/>
You mentioned deal breakers and that is another frustrating thing we <br/>
deal with quite often; his agreeing to something in advance but <br/>
wanting to back out last minute even if it leaves a friend or family <br/>
member hanging. I&#39;ve always just insisted he keep his promises but <br/>
the constant fight is really getting to me.<br/>

getting emotionally depleted? How would you handle that?<br/>
<br/>
What if you were traveling with a friend and she did that - stayed up  <br/>
too late every night, got up early, and started to be super cranky due  <br/>
to sleep deprivation?<br/>
<br/>
It can help to think about what you could possible do in situations  <br/>
like the above.<br/>
<br/>
It will help you if you learn to talk with him - realistically and not  <br/>
with YOU lecturing/explaining things to him, but in a true  <br/>
conversation, I think.<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;d start with, &quot;So you&#39;re staying up really late. How is that going  <br/>
for you?&quot; You&#39;re on the same team - you&#39;re NOT adversaries, don&#39;t act  <br/>
like it. Ask HIM how he&#39;s feeling - but not with an ulterior motive on  <br/>
your part. No lecturing, just talking together. After you listen a  <br/>
while, you might add, &quot;Well, from my point of view, seems like you  <br/>
need a little more sleep.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Conversation - he talks, you listen and offer to help him to whatever  <br/>
extent he wants help.<br/>

<br/>
It seems to me like it might be more useful to stop planning things that take a prior <br/>
commitment for awhile.  He might need a little more spontaneity.  You can have the plan, <br/>
or a choice of plans even, and then see if he wants to do it but be open to a &quot;no.&quot;  Maybe <br/>
he really does want to see himself as the kid that is doing all those things, but when it <br/>
comes right down to it he can&#39;t, doesn&#39;t want to or just really doesn&#39;t want to stop what <br/>
he&#39;s doing.  He could be agreeing to please you. ?<br/>
<br/>
Think of yourself as creating a partnership with your son.  See your son as whole and <br/>
healthy and desirous of being in a state of rest and vibrancy but maybe just not knowing <br/>
at this moment how to get there on his own.  If he&#39;s not able to make certain decisions for <br/>
himself yet (like reading his tired signals), then you can be the part of the team that can <br/>
make that decision and explain it to the other half--it&#39;s not him or you--it&#39;s both of you <br/>
working together to make a healthy and happy child.  This is the moment when his bed is <br/>
made, the lights are low, the music is on (or whatever he has identified as aids to his <br/>
sleep).  Your certainty about what he&#39;s needing at that moment (sleep), combined with the <br/>
quality of the connection and trust you have with him will determine what will happen <br/>
next.  <br/>
<br/>
(Often my son, the nightowl, will ask me earlier in the day for help going to bed that night <br/>
because when he&#39;s tired he has a hard time separating from his activities but knows he <br/>
needs sleep.)<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps you&#39;ve had a conversation earlier that day that you can refer back to. Like this:  &quot;I <br/>
know that you will be able to get the right amount of rest you need in the future, but right <br/>
now I see you ignoring your tiredness.  How can I help you get the sleep you need?&quot;  Ask <br/>
him for suggestions.  Help him see what his tiredness looks like--he may not really know.  <br/>
<br/>
When I stopped seeing my daughter as adversarial it changed the world for us.  There are <br/>
some areas in which she still has a hard time reading her body signals, although I see <br/>
shifts happening rapidly as she progresses further into being a 9yo.  We have developed a <br/>
sweet and trusting balance where the focus is on well being and learning and finding <br/>
balance.  It is not me drowning out her inner voice with rules, but helping her to read her <br/>
own body signals.  It&#39;s like a drawing out of what&#39;s developing in her.  Sometimes she is <br/>
very cranky with me, but I don&#39;t take it personally--she is expressing frustration with her <br/>
limitations, but it&#39;s o.k.  We don&#39;t always sound like a happy harmonious partnership on <br/>
the outside, but it actually feels really peaceful on the inside because there is much more <br/>
clarity and love in the relationship.  Our connection has grown deeper now that we aren&#39;t <br/>
on the continuum of me in charge or her in charge--we are working together.  (And it <br/>
often does sound very harmonious too :-))<br/>

In a post on March 4 you said, &quot;When Kirby was two and woke up and <br/>
wasn&#39;t at all sleepy and I was too<br/>
sleepy to stay up with him because I was pregnant, I would put him in<br/>
the high chair in front of a six-hour video of Disney movies or<br/>
Warner Brothers cartoons. I&#39;d give him food, drink, a little pillow,<br/>
a baby blanket, and go back to bed. In the morning he would be<br/>
asleep on the tray with the pillow. That happened many times. But<br/>
he wasn&#39;t running around the house making noise. We made a deal and<br/>
he kept it, knowing the alternative was being in the bed. &quot;<br/>

How is that different from the original poster and her 8 year-old son? <br/>

&quot;We have the need to be accepted and to be loved by others, but we cannot<br/>
accept and love ourselves. The more self-love we have, the less we will<br/>
experience self-abuse. Self-abuse comes from self-rejection, and<br/>
self-rejection comes from having an image of what it means to be perfect and<br/>
never measuring up to that ideal. Our image of perfection is the reason we<br/>
reject ourselves the way we are, and why we don&#39;t accept others the way they<br/>
are.&quot; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-756442458">Maisha  and others who work during the day ---<br/>
<br/>
Do you get a lunch break at work? I used to go to my car and put in  <br/>
earplugs and put the seat back as far as I could and take a 40 minute  <br/>
nap. Even when I didn&#39;t sleep, it made a HUGE difference in the rest  <br/>
of my day/evening. But, after a while, I&#39;d trained myself to go to  <br/>
sleep very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
I would just eat a quick sandwich or something else I brought from  <br/>
home, for my lunch. I needed the sleep more than the time for eating.<br/>
<br/>
This is a perfectly healthy way to live - get up early, take a nap in  <br/>
the middle of the day, stay up later at night. I&#39;ve read all kinds of  <br/>
studies about napping (I have RLS - a neurological sleep disorder that  <br/>
often keeps me from getting to sleep) and, recently, there have been  <br/>
more and more that show  that night sleep isn&#39;t negatively impacted by  <br/>
short afternoon naps. People who take short afternoon naps sleep  <br/>
better at night, even when they get fewer hours of sleep at night,  <br/>
they feel more refreshed throughout the day and evening.<br/>
<br/>
Those who don&#39;t &quot;nap&quot; often think they can&#39;t. But if you just do it,  <br/>
just totally relax and rest for half-hour to 40 minutes, after a while  <br/>
your body starts to let consciousness go more and more quickly and you  <br/>
find you can fall asleep in a few minutes and wake up feeling good.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m not sure what the deal is. He did say something the other day<br/>
&gt; along the lines of &quot;Unschooled kids don&#39;t have a bedtime.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>All kids have bedtimes, it happens naturally when they feel tired and<br/>
fall asleep, or when a parent tells them to.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; My biggest problem is when I do intervene, he gets really upset.<br/>
&gt; That&#39;s when he says I&#39;m treating him like a child, or he&#39;ll say I&#39;m<br/>
&gt; not &#39;giving him any respect&#39; or allowing him to make his own choices.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Would it work for you to inform him that his decision impact you and dad<br/>
in a disrespectful way?  Respect really does work both ways.  Perhaps he<br/>
hasn&#39;t a clue what real respect looks and feels like.  That may take<br/>
time but you can point it out when he is acting disrespectfully towards<br/>
another person.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; You mentioned deal breakers and that is another frustrating thing we<br/>
&gt; deal with quite often; his agreeing to something in advance but<br/>
&gt; wanting to back out last minute even if it leaves a friend or family<br/>
&gt; member hanging. I&#39;ve always just insisted he keep his promises but<br/>
&gt; the constant fight is really getting to me.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I would stop making plans that involve early morning time frames.  Set<br/>
tentative dates with others, letting them know in advance that you might<br/>
need to back out last minute and ask when the last chance time would be<br/>
for their convenience.  Stick to it.  If a deal gets broken with a<br/>
particular friend, don&#39;t make any more plans with that person.  If your<br/>
son starts seeing that he&#39;s not doing anything with anyone, you can tell<br/>
him why.  You can let him know that plans can resume when you see that<br/>
he can keep a date without backing out last minute and hurting someone&#39;s<br/>
feelings.<br/>
<br/>
When it becomes important enough for him, he will keep his promises.  I<br/>
can almost gaurantee it, barring the occasional last minute cancelation<br/>
for other reasons, such as &quot;I don&#39;t feel good&quot;.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-418815865">I think it would depend  a lot on the temperment of the individual child.  I have one that <br/>
would not like this, but one who loves spontaneity, and if knowing in advance causes <br/>
stress, then I might ask that child if, hypothetically, she would like a surprise like that in <br/>
the future.  She could have a whole conversation about the possibility, so it&#39;s only keeping <br/>
information in the same sense that they don&#39;t know what their Xmas presents are until <br/>
Xmas.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it really depends on the individual.  Some kids really like<br/>
surprises and can change directions really fast to be spontaneous.  I&#39;m<br/>
thinking that if my child really was struggling with keeping commitments<br/>
but also really liked hanging with grandma, then a surprise might be<br/>
cool.  Some kids can handle all the information about the where when how<br/>
why, of a social engagement, but some kids like to NOT think about that<br/>
and just do.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest daughter would do well with surprises, especially if they<br/>
were surprises that involved grandma without big ideas surrounding the<br/>
visit.</div>

This just reminded me of a huge problem I got into with my son when he was about 3.  It was <br/>
my first foray into respectful parenting, and I was faithfully trying to apply all the rules.  &lt;g&gt;  <br/>
The rules said to involve him in decision making, so I did.  I drove him absolutely crazy!!!  I <br/>
was applying a rule, whether it fit or not.  My son did not, and still DOES NOT want to make <br/>
many decisions.  The important ones, absolutely, but everything else is left, gratefully, to me.  <br/>
He really mostly wants life to flow around him and carry him along.  He doesn&#39;t care what he <br/>
wears as long as it&#39;s clothes, he doesn&#39;t care what he eats, as long as he didn&#39;t have to make <br/>
it, etc.  Gee, come to think of it, kinda&#39; like Dad!<br/>
<br/>
My daughter--exact opposite.  I can&#39;t really ask her enough questions, and any presumption <br/>
on my part can land me in a heap of trouble.<br/>
