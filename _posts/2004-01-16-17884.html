<div id="ygrps-yiv-609016820">On a different note, has it been decided where the 2005 Live and Learn<br/>
Conference will be?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well....there may be a conference at the same time, I don&#39;t know for sure, but there WILL be an unschoolers beach party down here in Pensacola.<br/>
Some of the Live and Learn attendees have already said they&#39;ll be here for sure...so it should be a fun time. I&#39;m not having speakers and all that jazz, so it&#39;ll be more fun for convinced unschoolers rather than those not sure (though all are welcome). I&#39;m going to plan a few outings that will be fun for families (Naval Air Museum and such) and the hotel will be smack, dab right ON the beach. So we can have sing alongs at night and swimming by day and all that freedom and space that goes along with a tourist free beach (except for you guys):).<br/>
Our beaches are sugar white and very empty in early October, when I&#39;ve planned the get together. It will be warm enough to swim still, but not sweltering anymore (for all you wimpy Northern types)lol.<br/>
<br/>
So if you want to come hang out with some unschooling families in early October 2005, mark your calender! I&#39;ll have details online by early summer this year.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and some folks might want to offer a funshop, I&#39;ll be happy to put a few of those on the schedule. I&#39;ll try to schedule touristy, fun stuff that is either free or very low cost...so the hotel fees and your own spending money is about all you&#39;ll need.<br/>

That sounds fun!!  I appreciate the OCT since I&#39;m a wimpy northern type:) <br/>
Also, it&#39;s the school year and isn&#39;t that one of the many perks of not<br/>
having kids in school:)<br/>
