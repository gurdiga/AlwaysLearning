<div id="ygrps-yiv-263958403">I enjoy this group.I once read about grazing snacks.Anyone any ideas? My hubby comes home for lunch and likes his main meal then.He doesn&#39;t feel well on heavy evening meals.I usually cook once a day.The kids like thier milk in the morning so that leaves P.M and evening help yourself to whatever is around.Thought it would be good time for a good grazing snack.Thanks! Linda</div>

That list was made by a vegetarian.  If you add meats, that expands the range.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1028246323">I&#39;m not sure I understand what you&#39;re asking--are you looking for ideas for snack foods to put out for your children in the evenings?<br/>
<br/>
tea sandwiches are fun. Just make their favorite sandwiches and cut them into 1/4s.<br/>
nuts and seeds.  We buy raw sunflower and pumpkin seeds and toss them with tamari and then roast them in the oven.  Yummy<br/>
cut up cheese, fruit, vegetables, chicken/meat, marinated tofu<br/>
celery with peanut or other nut butters<br/>
mini muffins<br/>
dips: hummos, bean, queso, guacamole.....<br/>
nachos: corn chips with beans, cheese and guacamole<br/>
we make a lot of smoothies too, and they&#39;re often the foundation of Noor&#39;s main proteins. Right now, she&#39;s loving coconut milk, almond butter and chocolate sauce, but often they&#39;re yogurt, fruit, something sweet like maple syrup and maybe even some vegetables like spinach or kale. If you have bananas that are getting mushy, slice them and put them in the freezer. They&#39;re great in smoothies and add sweetness and act as a thickener. <br/>
