<div id="ygrps-yiv-1129448472">I wanted to thank the many people who have recommended Zoombinis. We <br/>
just got it last week and I think it&#39;s so cool! I&#39;m not sure who wanted <br/>
to play it more, the kids or me ....<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, when I told my husband about it, I said, &quot;It&#39;s logical <br/>
math games, sorta more like programming skills.&quot; (he and I both have <br/>
some experience as computer programmers.)<br/>
<br/>
But then when I showed it to him, he said, &quot;That&#39;s not really math and <br/>
programming. It&#39;s more like science and conducting experiments.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said, &quot;Well, it all kinda swirls together.&quot; :)<br/>

Logic and reasoning!<br/>
<br/>
See if that doesn&#39;t cover what he saw and what  you saw.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And logic and reasoning are useful not only in math, programming and  <br/>
scientific inquiry, but in literature, music and parenting!  (And  <br/>
critical thinking of all sorts involving history, religion, watching  <br/>
commercials on TV, wondering why friends do what friends do...)<br/>
