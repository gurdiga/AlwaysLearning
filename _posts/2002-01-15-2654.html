&lt;&lt; Curious!!! Why? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They thought personality traits were passed through breastmilk (&quot;they&quot; being <br/>
the English in the Renaissance and thereafter, if I remember what I&#39;ve read  <br/>
correctly) and redheads were...<br/>
<br/>
mean and grumpy, they thought, and it was better to bring babies up to be <br/>
&quot;sweet tempered.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
The most interesting book I ever read about breastfeeding, I don&#39;t have.  It <br/>
was out of the university&#39;s library here and I renewed and renewed it until I <br/>
finally had to let them have their book back.  But it was by a female <br/>
anthropologist (or two, I think) who were studying history and belief <br/>
concerning breastfeeding.  <br/>
<br/>
One of their most interesting points goes against LLL teachings, and that is <br/>
that there are women who work in hotels in Puerto Rico but live on <br/>
neighboring islands (Domincan Republic?  I forget their exact details), and <br/>
they live at the hotel for five days and go home for their two days off.  <br/>
While they were gone, their mothers nursed the babies, and when they were <br/>
home the moms did, and their milk supplies didn&#39;t dry up, and the <br/>
grandmothers lactated easily to cover the other days.<br/>
<br/>
Since nobody thought it impossible or even weird, it was common.<br/>

<br/>
First, I caution you who are offended by porn NOT to go to Google.com and <br/>
enter wetnurse and redhead.  No, no, no.  <br/>
<br/>
But putting in <br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Each advance in psychogenic mode diminishes the emotional distance between <br/>
mother and child. The infanticidal mode of antiquity handled the anxiety <br/>
posed by the infant&#39;s needs through measures which constantly threatened the <br/>
child&#39;s life, including regular infanticide by rich and poor alike. The <br/>
medieval mode of abandonment substituted continuous rejection of the child, <br/>
whether to wetnurse, fosterage or monastery. The ambivalent parent, beginning <br/>
in the Renaissance, viewed the infant as at once both irrevocably evil and <br/>
greatly idealized. The intrusive mode of the eighteenth century produced a <br/>
mother who could now guarantee the child some measure of her love but only <br/>
under the condition of total control of his emotions. And the currently <br/>
predominant socializing mode uses covert manipulation of the child <br/>
predominantly through guilt and the delegation of parental goals.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Each psychogenic mode in turn produces historically new adult <br/>
psychospecies: the schizoid character of antiquity gives way to the autistic <br/>
character produced by the abandonment of medieval childhood, the late <br/>
medieval manic-depressive character being followed by the early modern <br/>
compulsive character, the result of intrusive mode parenting, and finally by <br/>
the various types of anxiety characters so commonly found in contemporary <br/>
society.-=-<br/>
<br/>
. . . .<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Not only was England in the seventeenth century ahead of the rest of Europe <br/>
in child care, but it was more particularly the English middle class, from <br/>
which so many American mothers were drawn, which first achieved these <br/>
historically new attitudes toward children. At a time when the English <br/>
nobility still sent their children out to wetnurse, numbers of brave English <br/>
middle-class mothers, particularly Puritan mothers, who were encouraged to <br/>
pray with and watch closely over their children, began for the first time in <br/>
history to face the enormous anxieties of actually relating with empathy to <br/>
the emotional needs of the infant at their breast. When, for instance, their <br/>
babies cried upon being swaddled, these mothers stopped complaining that man <br/>
was born in shackles&quot;, a phrase repeated ad nauseum since Pliny(8), and <br/>
instead empathized with their infants and tried leaving them unswaddled, over <br/>
the horrified objections of their doctors. Frenchmen thought the sight of <br/>
these unswaddled English infants &quot;deplorable&quot; and complained of the excessive <br/>
&quot;indulgence of Mothers . . . among the English.&quot;(9)<br/>
<br/>
-=-It was from such mothers as these that the American personality was <br/>
formed. Selected from among the most advanced, and isolated from the <br/>
&quot;swamping&quot; effects of earlier-mode parents, American mothers became the first <br/>
in history to face their ambivalent feelings and to begin to fashion the <br/>
modern intrusive mode of childrearing, a mode which was closer, more <br/>
nurturant, more consistent and more controlling than any prior mode in the <br/>
evolution of childhood. The evidence for this is everywhere.....-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743939427">(about child abandonment and infanticide in 19th century Germany...) <br/>
-=-...the figures in the south--the highest in Europe--being due to their <br/>
practice of not breastfeeding,300 since hand-fed babies died at a rate three <br/>
times that of breast-fed babies.301-=-<br/>
<br/>
One of the best things, for me, about breastfeeding, was the hormonal change <br/>
in me when the baby was nursing.  It made me calm and patient--physically <br/>
calm and patient and loving, and having the baby&#39;s head there where I could <br/>
touch, see and smell it made me hugely protective of that baby, and made the <br/>
baby seem a true and continuing part of me and my existence.  So to find that <br/>
there were whole cultures in which breastfeeding was almost obliterated (kind <br/>
of like 1950&#39;s U.S...) makes me physically react to the thousands of REALLY <br/>
miserable and sickly babies that kind of &quot;belief&quot; and action will cause.<br/>
<br/>
Note below that even a write being sympathetic to German infants referred to <br/>
them as &quot;worms&quot;:  <br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Nineteenth-century doctors condemned the practice of German mothers refusing <br/>
to breastfeed their babies, saying the pap made of flour and water or milk <br/>
was &quot;usually so thick that it has to be forced into the child and only <br/>
becomes digestible when mixed with saliva and stomach fluids. At its worst it <br/>
is curdled and sour.&quot;303 Infants were so commonly hungry that &quot;those poor <br/>
worms get their mouths stuffed with a dirty rag containing chewed bread so <br/>
that they cannot scream.&quot;304 Ende reports that for centuries &quot;One rarely <br/>
encounters a German infant who is fully breastfed. Everywhere they got their <br/>
mouths stuffed with Zulp, a small linen bag filled with breadSwaddled babies <br/>
could hardly get rid of these often dirty rags.&quot;305 Mothers who could afford <br/>
it sent their newborn to wetnurses--commonly called Engelmacherin, <br/>
&quot;angelmakers,&quot; because they were so negligent toward the children. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I haven&#39;t followed any footnotes.  Too scary as it is.<br/>
<br/>
I know of pewter &quot;feeding cans&quot; from England, and &quot;pap&quot; which was just <br/>
re-hydrated by adding milk or water to what had been sitting in a pewter can <br/>
already for days sometimes.  They were left on a low shelf or by the fire, <br/>
and babies could come along and sip out of the spout,  a straw-like thing <br/>
which went to the bottom of the can.<br/>
<br/>
Pewter itself is a lead-poisoning situation, even without spoiled milk and <br/>
days-old porridge in it, growing who-knows what.<br/>
