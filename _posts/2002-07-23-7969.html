<div id="ygrps-yiv-1285315956">Hi,<br/>
Recently, in talking about wanting to go back to school instead of homeschooling,<br/>
my dd (11) complained that with homeschooling she has &quot;too much freedom&quot; and<br/>
doesn&#39;t &quot;do anything&quot;, she&#39;s &quot;too lazy&quot;, and needs school &quot;to make me do and<br/>
learn things&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
She also wants to go to the HSC homeschooling conference in Sacramento next month<br/>
because she had so much fun there last year.  I couldn&#39;t see spending the money<br/>
for that if she was just going to decide to go back to school the following month<br/>
and ultimately, she has decided to homeschool for &quot;another year&quot;.  This will be<br/>
our third.<br/>
<br/>
I want to help her with her frustrations and I&#39;m trying to find a way to give her<br/>
the &quot;structure&quot; (if that&#39;s what it is) that she seems to need.  Sometimes she<br/>
pulls out the Saxon book and says she is going todo it everyday (part of her plan<br/>
to go back to school, I think) but it never lasts for more than one day.<br/>
Sometimes she asks me to make her do stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I offered to structure a whole day like I think middle school will be.  After she<br/>
heard about it, she didn&#39;t want to do it.  I offer ideas all the time, places to<br/>
go, things to do, etc. and most of the time I get a no answer.  Sometimes, she&#39;ll<br/>
tell me the next day -- &quot;you should have made me go&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m increasingly frustrated.  I don&#39;t feel like I am giving her what she needs<br/>
but I don&#39;t really understand what she is wanting/needing.  She doesn&#39;t seem to<br/>
be thriving with &quot;all this freedom&quot;.  Mostly, she sleeps half the day, watches<br/>
TV, plays the computer, reads a lot and plays with friends.  She volunteers at<br/>
the library once a week and we always eat lunch out on Tuesdays where she always<br/>
eats the same lunch.  That got me thinking.  What if we had certain days<br/>
scheduled to do certain things, things she likes to do so that she knows which<br/>
type of activity we&#39;re doing on certain days.  I&#39;d give her a list of ideas and<br/>
she could pick and choose and add her own and then she&#39;ll set the schedule and<br/>
then she&#39;ll &quot;have to do it&quot;, assuming of course that she agrees to it up front.<br/>
<br/>
What do you think?  I have tried so hard to give her as much freedom as I can,<br/>
this is all feeling backwards to me.  I&#39;d love ideas/opinions, etc.  And thanks<br/>
for reading all this.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;What do you think?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think that would be fine.  I like knowing where I have to be which days and <br/>
working around that.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe she would like to go to an office supply store and look at wall <br/>
calendars with hours on them, or maybe a planning calendar book (thought it <br/>
would have to be where you could both get to it, maybe).  There are come <br/>
computer calendars that pop up with what&#39;s to do that day.<br/>
<br/>
I always get green chile chicken enchiladas.  Whatever else they might have <br/>
at the restaurant it&#39;s not going to be better than that.  When I did Baskin <br/>
Robbins as a teen and 20&#39;s person, I&#39;d look at every flavor and then get the <br/>
same favorite two.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I offer ideas all the time, places to<br/>
go, things to do, etc. and most of the time I get a no answer.  Sometimes, <br/>
she&#39;ll<br/>

she&#39;ll<br/>
tell me the next day -- &quot;you should have made me go&quot;.way I get myself and my <br/>
kids to go places is to arrange to go with another family.  There are two <br/>
other homeschooling families we get together with once a month or so <br/>
(separately with each family, I mean).  And since they&#39;re going to meet us <br/>
there, we HAVE to be there a certain time.  It&#39;s twice as fun for the kids to <br/>
see the other families, too.  One family has no older kids, so Kirby and <br/>
Marty don&#39;t always go.  But the other family we&#39;ve known since La Leche <br/>
League, and their teenaged girl will only go if Kirby and Marty are there, <br/>
and vice versa.  So it&#39;s a way to bestir teens to go see the butterfly <br/>
pavilion or to go on a picnic (the two most recent examples &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe at the end of each day you could write down what she did and learned <br/>
which was NOT on the schedule, for a while, until she sees that it&#39;s not <br/>
&quot;nothing.&quot;  And perhaps be being aware that it will be reviewed and listed <br/>
she&#39;ll be more aware of what she&#39;s doing?   And by noting what she really <br/>
enjoyed, you and she could plan for more of it--more time, more materials, <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
She just doesn&#39;t know what &quot;nothing&quot; is if she&#39;s not going to school.....<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-50339930">Are some of her friends public school kids?  Because that sounds so much<br/>
like the talk public school kids get from their parents about why &quot;they&quot;<br/>
can&#39;t homeschool and the kids in turn pass it along to their homeschooled<br/>
friends.  <br/>
This is really fresh right now because this is the stuff my niece was<br/>
talking when she was here, and last year she wanted to homeschool.  Now,<br/>
because she&#39;s heard it from her mom, she &quot;knows&quot; she needs someone to<br/>
&quot;make&quot; her do schoolwork, etc. She&#39;d be too lazy to homeschool.   Ooh,<br/>
it&#39;s just spooky you brought this up.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Also, maybe she&#39;s a little bored.  <br/>
Maybe instead of structure she could do with a gentle reminder that no<br/>
one needs to be controlled by anyone else.  And maybe she could use some<br/>
new scenery, new things to do, new places to explore.  Maybe she&#39;s just<br/>
in a rut.  Maybe you are too, and getting out and diving into some new<br/>
museum or town or festival or whatever would be a good place to start. <br/>
It really doesn&#39;t sound like she&#39;s interested in structure if she doesn&#39;t<br/>
want a middle school curriculum and doesn&#39;t want to do the math text<br/>
book. ( I don&#39;t blame her.)<br/>
<br/>
You said &quot;Mostly, she sleeps half the day&quot;, ... and it sounds here, a<br/>
little, like you might not be crazy about this.  Have you said to her, or<br/>
could she be picking up cues from you that you think she&#39;s &quot;too lazy&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I think getting out and doing something really fun together three or four<br/>
days a week, hiking, fishing, rock climbing ( there are indoor climbing<br/>
walls, too ) will give you both some easy time to talk and some answers<br/>
about what she really needs.<br/>

<br/>
Offering and *doing* things are quite different.  It has been said here that<br/>
unschooling is leading an active life.  Maybe she just needs an excuse to do<br/>
things. How about doing something *you* like to do, that you know she would<br/>
enjoy, and letting her join you of her own free will? Don&#39;t offer, just do<br/>
it. If you pick something interesting or exciting or fun, I&#39;ll bet she&#39;ll<br/>
join you. And you&#39;ll have enjoyable days of doing things together. This<br/>
takes the pressure off of her to decide what to do. She can find lots of<br/>
structure with parents that do things with her. By structure I don&#39;t mean<br/>
scheduling. Active, interested parents that do fun and interesting things at<br/>
dawn or midnight or anytime gives a structure to life for the living of it.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think I would last more than a day in a Saxon book either.<br/>
<br/>
What is the harm in going to the conference? I can&#39;t think why going to<br/>
school later would be harmed by all the group activity of the conference.<br/>
With all the positive reasons to go, it seems to be money well spent<br/>
regardless of future plans. I&#39;ll bet you have fun there too.<br/>
<br/>
See you at the talent show.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1909351488">Sometimes I need something to *force* me out of the house too and my son is<br/>
the same way.  If we actually get out we have a great time but there is<br/>
almost always that initial *I don&#39;t want to go* feeling.  Just take her and<br/>
go.  Don&#39;t ask her first, just say &quot;we&#39;re going....&quot; and go.  I don&#39;t know<br/>
why we&#39;re like that.  We&#39;re just homebodies I suppose.  Once we get back<br/>
(assuming it was a morning thing) the momentum carries us through to a lot<br/>
of other things at home.  When we stay at home all day the pace stays pretty<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1644046763">Hi Carolyn -<br/>
What I hear from your description of your daughter is self-judgment, <br/>
self-criticism....dissatisfaction....<br/>
<br/>
Like you, I believe that her motivation for structure will come from <br/>
within....<br/>
<br/>
Her days are perfect.....she is perfect....when she wants to &#39;learn&#39;, she can <br/>
come to you with an idea and you are available to make it happen....sounds <br/>
perfect.....she probably won&#39;t always spend her days this way.....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps, she is in a restless place right now....perhaps this is the quiet <br/>
before the storm....perhaps she feels bored and lazy....and perhaps it is <br/>
exactly that boredom and laziness that will guide her to something <br/>
fantastic....<br/>
<br/>
Imagine having a year or few months to be lazy and bored....imagine what you <br/>
might find in your heart and soul to pursue once all the dust has settled and <br/>
some real clarity is available.....<br/>
<br/>
When my daughter says she is bored....I get a gleam in my eye....I say, &quot;oh <br/>
my....you have nothing that interests you to do right now!  What will you <br/>
come up with?!&quot;  And really, it is typically something incredible (imo) like <br/>
painting or cooking or creating....she tries something really different when <br/>
she&#39;s in &#39;that place&#39;.....I tell her that boredom is good...and that <br/>
restlessness is good.....I suggest she not watch TV but wait and walk around <br/>
and see what comes up.....sometimes it&#39;s pulling out an old computer game and <br/>
making great progress.....who knows?!<br/>
<br/>
Do you ever feel that restlessness?  Perhaps you feel it now with her....take <br/>
a trip to clear the cobwebs....do something different for a day for a change <br/>
in scenery....any pretty places to go and watch clouds and listen to her <br/>
dream and put ideas together?.....<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps she is reflecting your own relestness and boredom....be sure to take <br/>
care of yourself....pursue your own interests.....perhaps tell her that you <br/>
have confidence that she&#39;ll figure out something to do and to please let you <br/>
know how you can support her but in the meantime, wanna go with me for a bike <br/>
ride, to the museum, to a movie? wanna look at old pics with me while I work <br/>
on my scrapbook?  And get going on your own life.....<br/>
<br/>
IMO, freedom is good....structure has its purpose....but structure for the <br/>
sake of structure?  or structure for the sake of &#39;learning&#39;?  I&#39;d have to <br/>
think/hear about those some more.....IMO, structure works when there is <br/>
project or motivation to do something....otherwise, to me, it is oppressive <br/>
and then I feel the failure when I can&#39;t/won&#39;t follow the schedule I set <br/>
up....I&#39;m working more on the &#39;being in the moment&#39; side of the pendulum and <br/>
over scheduling interferes....<br/>
<br/>
I think your daughter is on the verge of something magical....I would say to <br/>
not interfere and take on the schoolmaster role.....I like the idea of taking <br/>
her to the office supplies store to support her interest in structure.....<br/>
<br/>
Allow her to feel restless.....help her to realize her perfection.....<br/>
<br/>
Then let us know where she goes with it!<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes!<br/>
Jane<br/>

I get like that, and I&#39;ve seen it in my kids.  Just antsy, twitchy, <br/>
discontent.  And then it&#39;s like the sun comes out and they (or I!) get all <br/>
interested in some new project or get the urge to clean a room, or something. <br/>
 It&#39;s almost like the difference between being asleep and awake sometimes.   <br/>
Or like a caterpillar and a butterfly.   So they&#39;re probably very natural <br/>
cycles.<br/>

I allow myself to either ignore or get right on as the urge strikes.  <br/>

But when I have a deadline and something has to be turned in the next day, <br/>

Yeah, I figured this same thing about myself in college.  Sometimes I<br/>
had just one class on Thursdays, at 9am, and then was free for the rest<br/>
of the day.  Which was a great feeling.  Sometimes I had a day with no<br/>

along, while the farmers plan ahead.  School is designed to make farmers of<br/>
everyone, and is unable to cope with the hunters, so they label them -- ADD.<br/>

  Subject: RE: [AlwaysLearning] Re: structure<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  My son Julian, almost 13, often wants a bit more structure. Without it,<br/>
  he&#39;ll<br/>
  spend (what HE thinks) too much time playing one or two computer games,<br/>
and<br/>
  is disappointed after that he didn&#39;t do other things.  So he signs up for<br/>
  classes/trips that interest him, and periodically asks me to &quot;nudge.&quot;  I<br/>
can<br/>
  relate....when I don&#39;t have some structure I can get distracted from<br/>
things<br/>
  I<br/>
  really do want to do.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I think I&#39;d respond to my child telling me plainly to &quot;make him&quot; do<br/>
  something in the same way I&#39;d respond to a request to read to him or help<br/>
  him with spelling a word. I&#39;d do my best to help in a loving way. I&#39;m not<br/>
  talking about physically dragging him screaming somewhere because he<br/>
  previously asked me to force him. But if it will help for me to say &quot;Now<br/>
  it&#39;s time to go, so let&#39;s go&quot; regardless of whether he&#39;s enthusiastic, I<br/>
  will (and do) do that.<br/>

November is good for New Mexico and Arizona.<br/>

Albuquerque has some very good museums.  If you go there you might get the <br/>

things there that will satisfy your need and you can cross those places off <br/>

There is a phone number to call to get a vacation guide/touristy thing.  And <br/>

well when I send you Albuquerque info and say you should just go to the <br/>
museums in Albuquerque, that&#39;s a big &quot;come see me&quot; from me.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And there is this sad truth about New Mexico:  Trains don&#39;t go all over.  <br/>
Passenger trains are rare.  And the Santa Fe Railroad!??  No train station in <br/>
Santa Fe.  Lamy, a.k.a. the middle of nowhere, is the closest.  But <br/>
Albuquerque has a train station in a convenient location.  And I know very <br/>
well where it is.  And I have a house.  In a convenient location.  And you <br/>
can come and visit me if you want to!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sounds like a fabulous trip Shyrley! November should be perfect weather -<br/>
not too hot or too cold yet.<br/>
You&#39;ll be coming through Flagstaff on Amtrack, on your way to the Grand<br/>
Canyon.<br/>
Flagstaff to Phoenix is about a 2 1/2 - 3 hour drive.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if you&#39;re planning on doing Phoenix, too.<br/>
There are some things worth seeing here, like the AZ Science Center (I took<br/>
zenmomma Mary and her kids there) and the botanical gardens are nice, not to<br/>
mention *me*. ;-)<br/>
Of course, if you&#39;d rather just stay in the Northern Arizona area, there are<br/>
also plenty of things to see and do.<br/>
It really is beautiful up there.<br/>
I&#39;ve lived here for the past 18 years and 3 yrs when I was in my teens.<br/>
Feel free to use me as your Arizona guide - ask any questions you have and<br/>
I&#39;ll try to answer.<br/>
I also found these websites that look pretty good and informative.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>True in some ways.  But the bad thing is to see that in all it&#39;s <br/>
miles-and-miles glory,  you have to be in southern Arizona.  And it&#39;s like <br/>
115 degrees there.  And there are a whole bunch of people when you get to <br/>
town.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Some of those big cactus are pretty ratty, too.  Dying, with birds living in <br/>
them and unlike the picturesque perfect examples in Arizona Highways and on <br/>
the post cards, some are yellowish, dried up, and have bird-do on them.<br/>
<br/>
Of course the magazines are of and for the tourism industry, and I understand <br/>
that.   When New Mexico was a big place to move to in the 70&#39;s, we were <br/>
saying New Mexico Magazine should be forced to do &quot;equal time,&quot; and have some <br/>
pages of photos every month of arroyos with broken glass and old automobiles <br/>
half buried in sand, of tumbleweeds choking storm drains, and plastic grocery <br/>
bags wrapped around the cholla cactus...   Dead roadrunners and rabbits by <br/>
the side of the highway.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But regardless of details of cacti, what there is here is a smell in the air, <br/>
and a sky, that you don&#39;t get in most of the rest of the country.  And I love <br/>
it here.  And I can tolerate Arizona pretty well. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

furriner I can geta 30 day rail pass for $385 that allows me to use <br/>
Amtrak anywhere.<br/>
So I thought we&#39;d go to Flagstaff and hire a car and drive around for <br/>
2 weeks through AZ and NM then Amtrak up to San Fransico, then <br/>
Chicago and then back home.<br/>

We thought this was the coolest thing about the cactus! At the AZ <br/>
Botanical Gardens they called the so-called ratty ones a Bird & <br/>
Animal Hotel. They showed how different animals and bugs use each and <br/>
every part of that cactus. I had no idea! And cactus skeletons are way <br/>
cool too. I got a star that was carved from cactus skeleton. <br/>
