I am really hating the new 9.0 AOL. It runs all my post together with what <br/>
ever post I am responding to. That is why I keep putting the run of symbols <br/>
between the quote I am responding to and my response. I miss posts all the time <br/>
too. I hate it! Darin suggested going back to 8.0 or getting 8.0 enhanced. For <br/>
about two weeks I had to send any email I had written to the mail waiting to be <br/>
sent box first and then sign off and sign back on. Then it would take forever <br/>
to send just one. If I tried to send it the normal way, the little hourglass <br/>
thing would pop up and never go away and the computer would just freeze. AOL <br/>
informed me it was an internal glitch and they would have it fixed soon. Soon <br/>
took two weeks. Another thing I have noticed is that it used to be that if <br/>
someone had quoted someone else&#39;s post there were little marks to note that. Now <br/>
there are none. Sometimes by the time I get someone&#39;s first post, five other <br/>
people have responded to it and I get their responses to a post I haven&#39;t even <br/>
received yet. Very confusing! OTOH, my sister in PA is having no problems with <br/>
hers. But she doesn&#39;t belong to any email groups or loops.<br/>

Nope, I haven&#39;t. I just use more spaces and more &gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt; and hope it comes out <br/>
OK. Definitely a 9.0 thang.<br/>
