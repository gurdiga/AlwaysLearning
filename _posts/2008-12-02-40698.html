<div id="ygrps-yiv-1281503175">9. We can&#39;t always fix everything for our kids or save them from  <br/>
every hurt. It can be a delicate balancing actï¿½when should we  <br/>
intervene, when should we stay out of the way? Empathy goes a long  <br/>
long way and may often be all your child needs or wants. Be available  <br/>
to offer more, but let your child be your guide. Maybe your child  <br/>
wants guidance, ideas, support, or intervention. Maybe not. Sometimes  <br/>
the best thing you can offer is distraction.<br/>
