<div id="ygrps-yiv-1008923114">OH, well.  Change is hard.  There are still people that go &quot;ballistic&quot; over<br/>
the idea of elementary age students using $10 handheld solar powered<br/>
calculators instead of spending days/hours/weeks and a ream of paper to<br/>
practice long division or calculate compound interest.<br/>
Or who think it reasonable to forbid older students to possess graphing<br/>
calculators or to use keyboards to write essays that are actually legible!<br/>
<br/>
KMN may be a reasonable demand for a tutor who cannot accept change.  It<br/>
would be reasonable to expect persons to navigate between languages and to<br/>
be able to use one singularly on a particular task but the impression I got<br/>
from the essay indicated more absolute value judgment of the language rather<br/>
than merely an expectation of separation.<br/>
<br/>
Me,  I admit that I am too set in my ways to learn another language and<br/>
&quot;foreign&quot; languages never came easy for me anyway.   Would you believe I<br/>
still use a checkbook &quot;register&quot;  and balance my account by hand?  And it is<br/>
doubtful I will EVER text message in my sleep...especially since I tend to<br/>
use standard English even in texts....which I only started appreciating 6<br/>
months ago when it was the means of communication when son was in birthing<br/>
room with wife and us grandmas were looking after the toddler.<br/>
<br/>
I am in awe of the many I know who can text (rapidly!!!)  with phone in<br/>
their pocket.  I count it along the same  road as the years I spent looking<br/>
for a teenager each time daylight savings time rotated and I had a digital<br/>
watch to reset.<br/>
