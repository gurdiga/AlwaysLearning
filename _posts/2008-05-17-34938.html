<div id="ygrps-yiv-1629625744">Heya!<br/>
<br/>
I am going to blog about this later, with pictures, but I wanted to<br/>
take the opportunity to just crow to folks who will get all the<br/>
implications.<br/>
<br/>
So... Rowan will be six in July. And in the last few months, he&#39;s been<br/>
playing with writing. He wants to write lists, write names, rearrange<br/>
the way the letters go, just play with writing. So we do that. No big.<br/>
No pressure. He does a lot of letters backwards, so I kinda took that<br/>
as a sign he needed more time, and haven&#39;t been pushing it in any way.<br/>
<br/>
Today, he&#39;s playing with writing, and decides to write his brother&#39;s<br/>
name, which is Kestrel. He writes the K, E, but does the S backwards.<br/>
His Papa says &quot;hey Rowan, you&#39;ve done the S backwards&quot;, and Rowan<br/>
stopped, looked intensely at it for a few seconds, turned the paper<br/>
around, and wrote the TREL backwards as well, so all the letters are<br/>
facing the same direction, but in mirror. Because with uppercase K and<br/>
E, you can do that.<br/>
<br/>
Big smile, and &quot;see! That&#39;s all right then.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, my child is channeling Da Vinci (BWAHAHAHAHAHA).<br/>
<br/>
So I know that for you oldtimers, you&#39;re probably amused, but I&#39;m new<br/>
enough to this that the ramifications of this, the fact that in<br/>
school, that backwards S would have been wrong, are still just washing<br/>
over me. And that the fact that he&#39;s been hugely proud of himself for<br/>
working out the puzzle of how to make it all work is just the coolest<br/>
thing...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just babbling, I know that. But I thought you guys might enjoy it too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636729105">Hi,<br/>
I&#39;m new at this too. And I read your blog and was happy for you and your<br/>
little boy that it sounds like he&#39;s having fun with learning in an<br/>
unpressured way and all. But, you know, it&#39;s not necessarily true that in<br/>
school that backward S would have been wrong. Stay with me: He&#39;s not even<br/>
six? He would be in Kindergarten. And any teacher worth her salt would have<br/>
taken that piece of writing and appreciated it for what it is: A good<br/>
example of writing that is developmentally right where it should be. Now,<br/>
before I ruffle any feathers here, let me say what I think the problem is.<br/>
See, for one thing, definitely if Rowan were not almost six but, say, almost<br/>
ten, or probably even at almost 8 and in the 2nd grade, then that backwards<br/>
S would be  pointed out as an error and corrected. And more to the point, in<br/>
my mind, whether that was wrong or not would have nothing to do with where<br/>
that child was individually in the development of his writing skills - No,<br/>
it would be based strictly on that arbitrary scale that teachers are forced<br/>
to use that says on month 4 of first grade it&#39;s ok for a child to do this,<br/>
but not on month 6, for instance. (I&#39;m not making this up, it *is* that<br/>
ridiculous, I know first-hand.) It&#39;s all tied to the insidious requirement<br/>
of quantifying everything, labeling everything and categorizing everything<br/>
(or trying to) into neat little slots in the name of making teaching appear<br/>
to be an exact science, which clearly it is not since it deals with human<br/>
beings! So, if Rowan were unfortunate enough to be in school instead of<br/>
happily home, it sounds like he might have been OK only right now, and only<br/>
in that respect, ONLY because at this exact time in his life and in that<br/>
very narrow area of learning, sounds like he happens to match the<br/>
expectation of what the &quot;average&quot; child does at that exact age (writing a<br/>
few words, experimenting with writing, including some reversals).<br/>
<br/>
So please babble away :) I enjoyed it more, and for more reasons, than you<br/>
guessed!<br/>

I love playing with writing like this! I discovered I could do that in my  <br/>
lower teens. Wyl, 9, will come to me sometimes and ask me to write so that we  <br/>
can read it in the mirror, which leads to him asking me to write upside down-he <br/>
 gets the biggest thrill out of watching the process. He&#39;s seen the puzzles <br/>
and  things in books where you &quot;decode&quot; the message by taking the page to a <br/>
mirror  and reading it, but watching it happen seems magical to him. I like to <br/>
write in  different &quot;styles&quot; (fonts?), make the letters look like what they <br/>
represent  &quot;cold, hill, balloon, etc.&quot;, play with block letters and shading... How <br/>
fun!  :~)<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>
De<br/>

that was going around the country -- guess it must be 10 years ago.  <br/>
It&#39;s a very clear memory so doesn&#39;t seem so long ago!<br/>
<br/>
I think there was a mirror angled so you could only see what you were  <br/>
writing in the mirror and the trick was to try to write your name so  <br/>
that it looked right in the mirror. Kat could do that with no  <br/>
problems! :-)<br/>

In my local school district (Southern California), kids are put into  <br/>
&quot;Reading Recovery&quot; at the beginning of 1st grade if they cannot yet  <br/>
read. They get one-on-one tutoring in reading for 12 weeks. They start  <br/>
with the &quot;lowest&quot; readers and every 12 weeks a new group gets put into  <br/>
Reading Recovery until about half the first graders have been through  <br/>
it.<br/>
<br/>
ALL kids, including kindergarten, must take written standardized tests.<br/>

The teachers may know that children under 6 are  very often not  <br/>
developmentally ready for reading and writing, but it doesn&#39;t matter  <br/>
what the teachers know - they don&#39;t have the authority to decide what  <br/>
they kids are ready for or not ready for - the kids must be tested and  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-397791454">Pam,<br/>
I agree completely. I was there (although not in SoCal, but same story).<br/>
What I wrote before only reflects what a teacher should do/would do in the<br/>
&#39;privacy&#39; of her own classroom - what I did! But you&#39;re right that they have<br/>
no power to define the parameters according to what they know, they are<br/>
defined for them by non-educators.<br/>
This is why stepping out of the system was the moral option for me.<br/>
