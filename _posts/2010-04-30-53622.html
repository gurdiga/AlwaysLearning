food.<br/>

The comments are, as usual, rude and skeptical.   There was something  <br/>
pretty funny in an &quot;if I let him&quot; way:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Worked great out on the savannah. Now my kids would go hunt-and- <br/>
gather chicken nuggets, chocolate milk, fries, and a Sponge-Bob ice  <br/>
cream cone.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It didn&#39;t seem that anyone who commented had actually gone to the links.<br/>
<br/>
This is from the same post as the quote above.  That one was cute.   <br/>
This one is irritating:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I wonder how many parents who are drawn to the unstructured nature of  <br/>
unschooling will be interested in imposing the kind of structured  <br/>
environment they will need to succeed. And even if they are, well, any  <br/>
kid worth his salt will figure out how to trade the orange for the  <br/>
Cheetos in a heartbeat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Keith&#39;s about to take me out to dinner, so I&#39;m not going to go  <br/>
comment, but if any of you feel like defending our kids&#39; collective  <br/>
honor, there it is.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1872544504">Simon and Linnaea like cheetos, and we have to get them imported. Fortunately we&#39;ve met a woman whose husband is in the USAF and she can get us cheetos from the base. But I bet they trade a good orange for cheetos every time. Oranges are hard though. When they are good, man, yumm, but if they aren&#39;t ripe enough or if they are too insipid tasting, well, they need punch and flavour and goodness. Cheetos are the same pretty much every time. Although the curly ones that look like pigs&#39; tails they aren&#39;t so flavourful, they&#39;re just novel. They wouldn&#39;t trade picking strawberries and eating them for cheetos, they wouldn&#39;t trade David&#39;s risotto for cheetos. But this woman would, right? So clearly her junk food versus good food outlook has worked a treat. <br/>
<br/>
Last night at dance class one of the musicians brought little baklavas in. And one of the dancers talked about how she has an unhealthy obsession with sweet things. Linnaea and I had just been talking about loving food in the car on the way to class. She was talking about how much she enjoys eating good food. David had bought a couple of cheap chickens from the grocery store to cook up for the cats and the dog and Linnaea had tried some of the meat and said it was flavourless. We get free range chickens from the butcher normally. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what got her thinking about food and enjoying food. Both she and Simon are doing their own food explorations and discoveries and have their own relationships with what they eat. I got little mini chocolate covered doughnuts yesterday and Simon grabbed them and ran for the computer with them when we got home. With both David and I sneaking quite a few and Linnaea a few less the tub of 30 little doughnuts still has<br/>
 9 in it, but of the 18 bagels I made 2 days ago, there are 2 left. No unhealthy obsession, just a healthy joy in the taste and the pleasure and the energy given.<br/>
<br/>
Food is such a wonderful aspect of life. Sharing it, creating it, growing it, killing it, buying it, exploring it, just this huge wonderful experience. Labelling it as something fearful and worthy of huge rules and barriers and boundaries just screws it all up. Why would anyone want to torture themselves over something so fantastic as a honey and nut and filo pastry morsel? Or a cheeto?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1388707525">I loved Cheetos when I was little.  My mom never bought them.  Maybe they weren&#39;t available in our little town but probably it was a grocery budget thing.  But my great aunt loved them and when we would go see her I&#39;d get Cheetos.  She was blind and lived with my mom&#39;s sister.  She was old.  She sat all day and burped and made quilts or braided rugs.  I was fascinated by her, she had mysterious, milky eyes and she never got hollered at when she belched, even at the dinner table.   She kept a bag a Cheetos in her nightstand drawer and she&#39;d share them with me.  She&#39;d say, &quot;lets go work on my rug,&quot; which meant, &quot;Come eat Cheetos in my room.&quot;    <br/>
<br/>
When she died I was so sad because I knew it would be end of the Cheetos.  People thought I was grief stricken and they told me lots of stories about her and I&#39;m glad about that because I wouldn&#39;t have known much about her otherwise, but what I was really grief stricken about was the loss of my beloved Cheetos. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know how long my old aunt had been eating Cheetos but she was ninety six when she died.    The aunt who took care of her is now ninety two.  She pours cream on everything, eats a big bowl of potato chips every day, has a little Irish cream in her coffee in the morning and a little wine in the evening, eats chocolate and cooks with butter.   My mom&#39;s eighty eight.  Those old girls just keep on living and it&#39;s hard to get worked up about Cheetos or anything else when you know longevity and health have to do with a lot more than food. <br/>
<br/>
For a really long time Dylan liked potato chips.  We&#39;d buy bags and bags of them and he&#39;d eat potato chips every day.  He especially loved the salt and vinegar kind.   He still likes chips but he has them once in awhile now.   He&#39;ll take a nice, tarty green apple anytime.    He was like that with Mountain Dew too, loved it and drank it every day.  He much prefers water these days, though he still sometimes drinks cola.  <br/>
<br/>
I think kids are more likely to be made unhealthy by food guilt and shame and pressure and criticism than by Cheetos or chips. <br/>

My grandmother died at 98, my grandfather at 89, all his sister lived into their 90s.  My other grandfather was 96 when he died and his wife is now 98.  They all cooked with butter, ate biscuits at every meal, ate butterbeans and other veggies cooked to death in butter, lots of fried chicken etc... I loved going to eat at their houses, the food had so much buttery flavor (which i like), I rarely ate the desserts, cause although they were good, the main dish was better.<br/>
3 of my great aunts lived together most of their lives, they took care of their brother and only one learned to drive.  When he died and she had a stroke so she couldnt drive anymore they went to live with a health nut of a great aunt.  She wouldnt let them cook anymore, said they used too much butter and salt and cooked everything bland and tasteless.  They hated it but it was her house.  <br/>
Later when one started having health problems the dr. said she wasnt getting enough fat and sodium. Their diet had practically no fat or salt in it anymore.<br/>
My sister and I would try to visit and when we did we brought them pizza, they loved it.</div>

 </span></blockquote>It doesn&#39;t take much to figure out how to trade. I&#39;m sure your kids knew how to do that. Figuring that out doesn&#39;t necessarily mean anyone would WANT to trade. I know that&#39;s not what this person was trying to say but that is what it says. It doesn&#39;t say that any kid worth his salt WOULD trade the orange for the Cheetos. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the difference. Both the unschooled kid and the food-controlled kid know how to trade but the unschooled kid knows he has the option of Cheetos anytime he wants and doesn&#39;t feel the desperation of having to trade the orange for the Cheetos before his parents find out.<br/>
<br/>
I had a woman who was shocked that I let my 2 and 6 year old boys have soda at a birthday party. She said she never let her granddaughter have soda. I told her my kids don&#39;t drink that much and a sip wouldn&#39;t hurt them. Sure enough, they each only had a few sips of the soda and then ran off to play, which I did point out to the woman because her attitude insulted me. Meanwhile, the other kids who only got soda at special occasions hung around the kitchen gulping down cup after cup.<br/>

<br/>
I had virtually given up on eating most fruit a few years ago because it was so hit or miss. I had never liked pears because they were so gritty. Not to mention that when I was a kid my mom only bought a limited variety of fruits, the ones she liked, and told me I was being ridiculous for not liking it. I&#39;ll never get over missing out on honeydew melon until I was probably in my 30s because my mom wouldn&#39;t buy it. She only bought cantaloupe, which I can&#39;t stand, because she didn&#39;t like honeydew, which I have since discovered is one of my favorite fruits. I assumed they tasted the same since they were both melons. But I digress.<br/>
<br/>
Once I started eating fruit only when it was in season, though, I discovered that almost every fruit does taste good. Well, I still can&#39;t swallow cantaloupe or bananas (my mother&#39;s other favorite fruit...hmmm, I see an unhealthy connection here). I love pears now and honeydew melons, like I said. I have yet to get a yucky orange in peak season but, man, are they yucky in the summer!<br/>
<br/>
== Food is such a wonderful aspect of life. Sharing it, creating it, growing it, killing it, buying it, exploring it, just this huge wonderful experience.==<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t have any conscious negative emotions surrounding food (unless you count the associations with my mother, I guess &lt;smirk&gt;). I&#39;m not worried about calories or cholesterol or heart attacks or cancer associated with food. I am somewhat concerned about the additives and artificial ingredients in food so I seek out foods that do not contain those things as much as possible. I&#39;m not obsessed with it, though, to the point that everything I eat must be organic and whole and raw and whatever. However, I do not get this love affair with food. I eat because I have to. If I don&#39;t eat for too long I start to feel sick and weak. But there isn&#39;t anything that I really want to eat or enjoy eating. I don&#39;t look forward to eating. Therefore, I don&#39;t like buying it and making it. I do like growing it, so far. That seems kind of sad, huh? Everyone tells me people are supposed to enjoy food. Maybe not everyone. Maybe it&#39;s ok to not love food so much. I don&#39;t know.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, while we&#39;re on the subject of new religion (eco-religion) and  <br/>
guilt, the &quot;health&quot; industry (gyms, diet programs and so on) wants us  <br/>
to repent about the food we eat. It&#39;s one of the reasons I stopped  <br/>
working out with a particular trainer. I was going to the gym to feel  <br/>
stronger and to boost my stamina (which I&#39;ve done). She wanted me to  <br/>
feel really guilty about the food I was eating. She&#39;s a triathlete  <br/>
besides being a trainer, so is completely obsessive about food. Not a  <br/>
session went by without her talking about it. It had the opposite  <br/>
effect on me; I didn&#39;t eat better. But she accomplished one thing: I  <br/>
felt guilty about everything I was eating, &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad.&quot; Instead of  <br/>
losing weight, I&#39;ve gained and felt like a sinner. I didn&#39;t want to  <br/>
endure her judgement, when she was supposed to be helping me.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t need an industry to feed into any deep-seated guilt about  <br/>
food.  I rather like the Hawai&#39;ian adage: &quot;Don&#39;t eat until you&#39;re  <br/>
full; eat until you&#39;re tired.&quot; &lt;g&gt; Hawai&#39;ians&#39; gatherings are always  <br/>
about food. Food *is* love and aloha. You would never show up to  <br/>
anyone&#39;s house without a food contribution. I don&#39;t want food to be  <br/>
about guilt and repentance and misery. I want it to be about love and  <br/>
care and giving.<br/>
<br/>
Like Schuyler said before:  &quot;Candy fed with love beats the heck out of  <br/>
broccoli eaten out of fear.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
My friend Jeff was on an Atkins diet years back and he was losing  <br/>
weight, buthe got very cranky.  He&#39;s totally good-natured, normally,  <br/>
and was being MEAN to his wife, his friends.  The doctor said it was  <br/>
from lack of oils in his diet.  So he quit that diet, gained weight,  <br/>
but went back to being sweet.<br/>
<br/>
He was a skinny kid, but neither of his parents were thin, as adults,  <br/>
but there is an idea in this culture (is it because of school or the  <br/>
concept of &quot;age of majority&quot;?) that whatever you have or are or know  <br/>
when you&#39;re 21 years old is yours FOREVER.  If you&#39;re thin and red- <br/>
headed, you are entitled to never gain weight or get grey hair.  Well  <br/>
it&#39;s crazy, but there it is.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Grown up&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;no longer growing,&quot; and genetic influences  <br/>
don&#39;t end when kids are old enough to drink and vote.<br/>

It&#39;s got to be okay not to love food so much.  Some people don&#39;t love  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1905554853">Jack had a snickers bar he left it sitting on the counter for a lot of days.<br/>
A few nights ago he went into the kitchen looking for a midnight snack. He<br/>
asked for asparagus. He likes it roasted with olive oil and salt and there<br/>
was a fresh bunch we&#39;d gotten that day in the fridge. He ended up having<br/>
baked beans instead, I was asleep and Lee didn&#39;t know how to make him the<br/>
asparagus. But still .. the snickers was right there ...<br/>
<br/>
He never ate the snickers. Olivia asked for it and he had no problem letting<br/>
her have it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a jar of skittles I put by the computer the kids use for gaming.<br/>
It&#39;s just about as full as when I put it there last week.<br/>
<br/>
The day we got asparagus Olivia picked out lemons, limes and watermelon.<br/>
Jack chose green peppers. I even showed Jack doritos that were called 2nd<br/>
degree burn or something like that because he&#39;s been into really spicy hot<br/>
food lately but he didn&#39;t want them. I would have never picked fruits or<br/>
vegetables as a kid. If my mom let me pick something I went straight for the<br/>
ice cream or candy.<br/>

When I was a kid I ate all my candy right away. I remember having a large<br/>
bag of M & M&#39;s that I bought myself and finishing the whole bag in one<br/>
night. I felt sick but I kept eating. My kids don&#39;t do that.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s got to be okay not to love food so much. Some people don&#39;t love<br/>
&gt; sculpture or poetry or music. Some people think they&#39;re mentally<br/>
&gt; deficient for that, but it&#39;s just that some people DO really love<br/>
&gt; certain things, I think because that&#39;s where their talent/intelligence<br/>
&gt; is and they appreciate the subtleties of those things.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30906904">I was once talking to an old friend I hadnt seen in years.  She was explaining that she didnt allow her daughter (who was about 6) any sugar.  She told me a story about her daughter being at a friends house and how the friends mother gave the little girl an icecream sandwiche even though she knew my friend didnt allow her to have sugar.  The little girl was standing right there and listening to the story and when she heard the icecream sandwiche mentioned her face just lit up.  She looked at me and started describing the icecream, how it tasted, what it felt like in her mouth, how it dripped and melted and how dirty her face got and how sweet it was etc... etc...I have never seen anything like it.  That child probably still remembers that ice cream sandwich to this day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-819643238">Last night David and I watched Tampopo, a Japanese movie about ramen and about food. There are a lot of little side stories, but one is about a man who has a huge abscess in a tooth. After the abscess is dealt with he is told to only eat soft food. He goes and gets an ice cream. And a small boy watches him eating this huge soft serve ice cream. The boy has a sign and a partially eaten carrot hanging from his neck. The sign says he isn&#39;t allowed sugar, only natural foods. The man offers the boy his ice cream and the boy&#39;s hand begins to twitch in anticipation. The man says it&#39;s really good, you&#39;ll like it. It could be that moment for that fictitious boy is the same as for your friend&#39;s daughter. The scene is on youtube. Took a while to find it, and it has German subtitles. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wnx4HHsDWw&feature=related.">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wnx4HHsDWw&feature=related.</a> The whole movie is a wonderful exploration, a bit tongue in cheek, of Japanese food culture. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-227851538">In the posts below the original reply several people actually defend unschooling and say that it is hard work and not the free-for-all the article implies. Not sure if it was someone from this list but thought I&#39;d put that out there.<br/>
One quote was:<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean lack of guidance by an adult, if fact quite the opposite. It means using everyday experience to educate--not using a classroom setting. So in effect going to the supermarket is a field trip--you can teach nutrition, math, pricing schemes, calorie and calorie intake, biology, pharmacology, baking (depends on the store), even the cycle of how food gets to market--fruit, vegetable and meat and packaged goods.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling uses the world as a classroom. It expects the child to be curious and interested in discovery. Parents actually use this methodology every day...they just don&#39;t recognize that they are doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Another quote:<br/>
<br/>
I think &quot;unschoolers&quot; are actually the most disciplined of parents as they view everything they and their children do as a total learning experience and work in what others expect schools to do--they are, if they are any good, the ultimate educators. I do homeschool and use the technique (as all parents do) but it&#39;s actually very hard work LOL (for the parent, not the child :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I like that comment saying unschooler parents are the &quot;ultimate educators&quot;.<br/>

&gt; Simon and Linnaea like cheetos, and we have to get them imported. Fortunately we&#39;ve met a woman whose husband is in the USAF and she can get us cheetos from the base. But I bet they trade a good orange for cheetos every time. Oranges are hard though. When they are good, man, yumm, but if they aren&#39;t ripe enough or if they are too insipid tasting, well, they need punch and flavour and goodness. Cheetos are the same pretty much every time. Although the curly ones that look like pigs&#39; tails they aren&#39;t so flavourful, they&#39;re just novel. They wouldn&#39;t trade picking strawberries and eating them for cheetos, they wouldn&#39;t trade David&#39;s risotto for cheetos. But this woman would, right? So clearly her junk food versus good food outlook has worked a treat. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last night at dance class one of the musicians brought little baklavas in. And one of the dancers talked about how she has an unhealthy obsession with sweet things. Linnaea and I had just been talking about loving food in the car on the way to class. She was talking about how much she enjoys eating good food. David had bought a couple of cheap chickens from the grocery store to cook up for the cats and the dog and Linnaea had tried some of the meat and said it was flavourless. We get free range chickens from the butcher normally. I&#39;m sure that&#39;s what got her thinking about food and enjoying food. Both she and Simon are doing their own food explorations and discoveries and have their own relationships with what they eat. I got little mini chocolate covered doughnuts yesterday and Simon grabbed them and ran for the computer with them when we got home. With both David and I sneaking quite a few and Linnaea a few less the tub of 30 little doughnuts still has<br/>
&gt;  9 in it, but of the 18 bagels I made 2 days ago, there are 2 left. No unhealthy obsession, just a healthy joy in the taste and the pleasure and the energy given.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Food is such a wonderful aspect of life. Sharing it, creating it, growing it, killing it, buying it, exploring it, just this huge wonderful experience. Labelling it as something fearful and worthy of huge rules and barriers and boundaries just screws it all up. Why would anyone want to torture themselves over something so fantastic as a honey and nut and filo pastry morsel? Or a cheeto?<br/>

&gt; What gets me about this is that she&#39;s basically saying any child who  <br/>
&gt; did NOT want Cheetohs would be... what, a wimp?  Mentally defective?  <br/>
&gt; Somehow &quot;not worth his salt.&quot;  So kids are in a lose/lose situation,  <br/>
&gt; in her book.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My kids don&#39;t like Cheetohs much.  I&#39;ve bought them twice in fifteen  <br/>
&gt; years or so, and they sit around and get stale, and it takes a long  <br/>
&gt; time for stuff like that to get stale in New Mexico.<br/>
