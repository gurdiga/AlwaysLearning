<div id="ygrps-yiv-227352706">We had a little drama in the house<br/>
yesterday.  Janene decided she wanted an<br/>
orange and that it needed to be cut and so<br/>
did, cutting her finger in the<br/>
process. I can&#39;t blame her or mark or myself<br/>
or the fact a knife was<br/>
available--just last month I cut my finger<br/>
pretty badly, and I&#39;m a grown up,<br/>
or at least that&#39;s what people say.   So,<br/>
mark takes her to urgent care.<br/>
<br/>
The doctor and nurse, as they are examining<br/>
the finger, talk to Lexie and<br/>
Janene and make comments about how smart they<br/>
are, etc.  Then Lexie breaks<br/>
the news--we homeschool.  What does that<br/>
mean.   You don&#39;t go to school at<br/>
all, asks the doctor.  Nope, Lexie says.  You<br/>
don&#39;t go to school in the<br/>
afternoons? Take a math class? Nope, says<br/>
Lexie.  Doctor looks at Mark and<br/>
says &quot;don&#39;t you want them to be around other<br/>
children?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Mark tries to explain that they are around<br/>
lots of other children, every<br/>
day.  Lexie, who is still wearing her &quot;thing<br/>
1&quot; tag from the Dr. Suess day at<br/>
the park, and who is wearing obviously<br/>
mismatched clothing, again in honor of<br/>
Dr. Suess, tells the doctor &quot;I&#39;m around a lot<br/>
of kids, I go to Girl Scouts,<br/>
to Soccer, to Park days.&quot;  Mark continues<br/>
&quot;I&#39;m not sure why they call it<br/>
homeschooling, that&#39;s a misnomer, as we are<br/>
really never at home.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
OK so Janene&#39;s finger is glued with purple<br/>
glue (dermabond) and they go<br/>
home.  Later that night her finger starts to<br/>
bleed again so back we go.<br/>
Lexie said it was like Dejavu (after I<br/>
provide the word), as we parked in the<br/>
same spot, had the same doctor, same nurse,<br/>
and were in the same room.  This<br/>
time the doctor just puts a bunch of strips<br/>
on Janene&#39;s finger, taping it up<br/>
well.  The doctor continues to asks questions<br/>
about homeschooling, now he is<br/>
confused because I work all day. How can I<br/>
&quot;school&quot; my child if I am not<br/>
there.  Lexie explained that she just learns<br/>
through life and that daddy<br/>
&quot;really just provides transportation.&quot;<br/>

Lexie&#39;s the one at the conference!  I have some more faces to go with  names <br/>
now!<br/>
<br/>
Holly is ten and a half and still not fluently reading.  Last night she said <br/>
she was really sad because her friend Sarah Louise, who is younger than she <br/>
is, has been reading chapter books for a long time, and Holly can&#39;t.   I said <br/>
maybe you can, and she tried some of a Boxcar Children book, just reading to <br/>
herself.  She got frustrated.  She asked how kids can learn to read faster.<br/>
<br/>
So I told her there was a book called something like Teaching your Child to <br/>
Read in 100 Easy Lessons, and we could look for one.  She said okay.<br/>
<br/>
So today we went to the homeschool-specializing used bookstore here (Title <br/>
Wave).<br/>
 As we were pulling in, I said &quot;I really thought about saying no about this <br/>
book, because I would like for you to know you can learn on your own.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She said, &quot;I know I can learn on my own, but I&#39;m getting tired of waiting.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So I asked for the book.  They&#39;d just gotten one in, and although the first <br/>
2/3 is too easy for her, the back part wasn&#39;t.  I had store credit, so that <br/>
was free, more or less &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
But the owner recommended a local reading book that&#39;s better, she says, and <br/>
Holly liked the look of it, so we got that for $20.  <br/>
<br/>
So my virginity is gone now, I bought a piece of educational curriculum!!!<br/>
<br/>
We also picked up the new, free homeschooling newsletter (a glorified <br/>
activities schedule) which had articles by four moms Holly knew (counting <br/>
me), and so she knew the kids they were talking about too.  And there were <br/>
quotes by homeschooling kids in town, and Holly was one of them.   So that <br/>
was cool.<br/>
<br/>
We got home, and went through two pages of one of the books, and six words <br/>
into the third page, Holly said I don&#39;t want to do this book.<br/>
<br/>
Me, in a moment of lack-of-philosophy, said &quot;We just got $30 worth of books <br/>
because you wanted to, so you&#39;re going to do them!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so cool...<br/>
<br/>
So she started to get tears in her eyes, and I accused her of acting just so <br/>
I would leave her alone.  (Also we had planned to work on it until I had to <br/>
take Kirby to work, and we had five more minutes.)<br/>
<br/>
But she said it was hard and she was making too many mistakes.  So I left <br/>
that page open and told her to look at it later if she wanted to, and we were <br/>
both happier.<br/>
<br/>
When she can read chapter books and feels successful, I can take both books <br/>
back to the same store and get credit to buy a FUN book with, so it&#39;s not a <br/>
total $30 loss.  It will be $15 book credit, and $15 invested in either <br/>
helping her or convincing her schoolish help can be something to cry about.  <br/>
I don&#39;t know which yet.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1014425651">Back when I was a school-at-homer (DOH! ;-), I used the Teach Your Child to Read in 100 Easy Lessons book. My son was about 5 and we went through it okay with *some* frustration here and there. We got about 3/4 done with the book and my son didn&#39;t want to do it anymore so I said he could stop. BUT, he was reading pretty well by that time - seems he did learn to read with the book.<br/>
<br/>
I tried the same thing with my other son at about the same age (a couple years later) and he just DID NOT get it. After the first few easy lessons, when they started getting into reading paragraphs, he struggled so much. It just wasn&#39;t working like it was supposed to, like it had with my other son. I let him give up that book but made him continue with phonics workbooks. These were such a struggle for him to do, I could see his frustration each time he did the workbooks, even though I was sitting right there beside him. He wasn&#39;t getting it! We even tried the ever-popular Phonics Game (because it&#39;s a fun card game! :-p) and he could only kind-of read the 3 letter words, nothing harder than that, no matter how many times we tried playing and S-O-U-N-D-I-N-G out the letters and sounds in each word.<br/>
<br/>
At about that time I discovered unschooling, was actually specifically drawn to the article at the unschooling.com website concerning late readers. I was hooked from that point on! I knew I had FINALLY found the answer to our homeschooling problems. I found people who had the same problems as I did - kids who didn&#39;t like to sit down and do book learning, late readers, frustrated households. And the best part was that I as I learned more about unschooling, I realized that I didn&#39;t have the problems I thought I did afterall. The problems I thought I had were just my kids learning things at their own pace, the way it really should be. I am so thankful to have found unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Since dropping all workbooks, phonics lessons, reading lessons, etc. last Sept., my 9 yo hesitant/late reader recently surprised me when I found him in bed one night reading a Pokemon chapter book. I asked him &quot;Can you read that book now?&quot; and he said &quot;yeah, most of it. Some words are a little hard but I just skip over those&quot;. He had tried reading that book several times already in months past and was still too frustrated with his reading level to stay with it. But this past week, HE GOT IT! He is starting to read BECAUSE I stopped trying to teach him reading. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1122819554">I&#39;m reading a book I got from the local library put out by The <br/>
Literacy Volunteers of America, Inc. called _Help a Child Learn To <br/>
Read_ by Judy Blankenship Cheatham. I&#39;m finding it very useful for me <br/>
in understanding the whole process of reading better. <br/>
<br/>
I like their &quot;working together&quot; approach too, this is an example (feel <br/>
free to substitute homeschooling for tutor as appropriate.)<br/>
<br/>
&quot; In any tutoring situation, remember five themes that pervade this <br/>
book:<br/>
<br/>
1. A respect for the child as an individual.<br/>
2. A view of the tutor and the student both learning and teaching.<br/>
3. A sensitivity to the child&#39;s needs for immediate relevance.<br/>
4. A veiw of tutoring and and learning as collaborative activities.<br/>
5. An integration of all four language components -- reading, writing, <br/>
listening, and speaking.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My 10 year old learned to read like breathing. The seven year old <br/>
isn&#39;t picking up the same visual or auditory clues. <br/>

&gt; little - my son does not have the attention span to<br/>
&gt; hear the same selection<br/>
&gt; that many times, so the way we do it is- I read it<br/>
&gt; two times, the we read it<br/>
&gt; together once, then he reads it once.  He really<br/>
&gt; likes this and is showing<br/>
&gt; improvement.  There is more to the book that I<br/>
&gt; haven&#39;t got to yet, but I<br/>
&gt; wanted to try &quot;To, With and By&quot; right away.<br/>

&gt; &gt; maybe you can, and she tried some of a Boxcar<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1859659798">My Zach is almost 9.  I tried to teach him to read at 5.  It was a nightmare<br/>
for both of us.  Luckily we discovered unschooling before I damaged him too<br/>
severely.  He would occasionally let me read to him but not much and he<br/>
rarely suggested it.  He would ask what signs said and could recognize the<br/>
names of television shows on the TV schedule.  That was about it.<br/>
<br/>
This week I was reading to my other son and Zach says &quot;I can read almost all<br/>
of &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot;.&quot;  I&#39;m thinking he must remember some of it from<br/>
years ago when he would let me read to him.  He sits down with me and I can<br/>
tell he IS READING....not reciting but reading.  He taught himself by<br/>
finding a book with smaller words and lots of repetition and rhyme.<br/>
<br/>
He showed me this the same day he found out he had been awarded a free goat<br/>
to raise through 4-H and the pumpkin seeds he saved from last year&#39;s<br/>
jack-o-lantern and planted all by himself sprouted.....banner day for young<br/>
Zach....and Mama was happy too  :)<br/>
