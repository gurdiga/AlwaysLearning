 </span></blockquote>My boys are 5 and 8.  I should say almost 6 as his birthday is next weekend <br/>
but he has decided to change his birthday so he won&#39;t be 6 now until June.  <br/>
And don&#39;t try to tell him otherwise.  LOL.  <br/>

We started out as attachment parents (is that a phrase) but didn&#39;t know it <br/>
was called attachment parenting.  Then when it came time to think about <br/>
&quot;school&quot; and &quot;preschool&quot; I had set in my mind that learning for them would <br/>
always be fun.  Not like it was for me.  And after thinking about things and <br/>
dabbling a little.  Like introducing a subject and seeing my oldest turn up <br/>
his nose we decided that we would follow their passions. Let them decide what <br/>
they were interested in and we would help them out by answering questions <br/>
providing transportation and making suggestions always knowing that they <br/>
would be the ones to make the choices.  <br/>
<br/>
It just fit in with our lifestyle.  Then about 2 years ago we discovered that <br/>
it had a name.  <br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have a typical day.  Errands, play groups, right now they are into <br/>
aliens, Warhammer 40,000, Mythology, LEGOs, play doh, oh and we just made <br/>
some neat stepping stones for the flower garden.  We are going to a play this <br/>
week.  Anyway hope that helps on your journey.<br/>
