<div id="ygrps-yiv-1987013770">Wayback Machine is part of the Internet Archives.  It&#39;s been there a while, but they&#39;ve started making the links work, and they&#39;re always bringing more pages in.  Ren Allen had noted a while back that some of the TV discussions from the long-deleted messages boards at unschooling.com are surfacing.  This morning I found that &quot;Conversations with Sandra Dodd&quot; has popped back up, too, and many of the links work.  Not all.  <br/>
<br/>
This is from ten years ago; I cleaned up a couple of bits, but the link is below for anyone who wants to poke around &quot;in the old days.&quot;<br/>

-=-On the other hand, if I didn&#39;t limit it they&#39;d <br/>
also fill up on Nick at Night reruns, those weirdo <br/>
cartoons they have on now (what&#39;s with Cow and <br/>
Chicken ANYWAY??), MTV and the usual.-=- <br/>
<br/>
They would fill up and be done. <br/>
<br/>
If you limit it, they will want more. <br/>
If you &quot;unlimit&quot; it they will fill up and be done. <br/>
<br/>
They can only make their own choices if they&#39;re <br/>
allowed to make their own choices. <br/>
<br/>
[I don&#39;t know who was being quoted in this next bit:]<br/>
<br/>
-=-I bet your kids would too, eventually. And then <br/>
they&#39;d be REALLY reading because they wanted to, <br/>
not because it was the best thing left after the <br/>
TV was restricted. If in the back of their mind <br/>
they&#39;re thinking &quot;I&#39;d rather be watching TV,&quot; the <br/>
reading won&#39;t be as intense or chosen. -=- <br/>
<br/>
There are many families here who can show you kids <br/>
who don&#39;t turn the TV on much at all, but it&#39;s <br/>
because they are allowed to turn it on as much as <br/>
they want to. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think balance will come from limitations <br/>
as well as some people wish it would. <br/>
<br/>
I had a niece not allowed to eat sugar at all. <br/>
NOTHING with sugar. A little hippie kid in the <br/>
late 1960&#39;s, early 1970&#39;s. <br/>
<br/>
She came to stay with us for a few days when she <br/>
was six. We were keeping to her mom&#39;s rules about <br/>
sugar. <br/>
<br/>
We found her in the field, squatted over a 5 lb. <br/>
bag of sugar, eating it with both hands like a <br/>
monkey, as fast as she could before she&#39;d get <br/>
caught. <br/>
<br/>
That wasn&#39;t balance. <br/>
<br/>
Or maybe it was. It was the balance of all her <br/>
deprivation. <br/>
<br/>
My kids have come to their own balance with food, <br/>
TV, activities, sleep, because they&#39;re allowed to <br/>
make their own choices. <br/>
