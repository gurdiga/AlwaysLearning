<div id="ygrps-yiv-919779049">I love this email list.<br/>
I always leave with a smile on my face.....reading about homemade, nontoxic <br/>
cleaners, about picking berries, hummeroids, little shits (zoos that is) and <br/>
then to top it all off some Alice in Wonderland (not the Disneyfied version).<br/>
Thank you all you wonderful, witty, interesting people.<br/>
