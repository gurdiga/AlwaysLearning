<div id="ygrps-yiv-1166797908">I appreciate everyone&#39;s input.  I have learned a lot so far and look forward<br/>
to learning even more.  I have not called it babysitting except for in my<br/>
initial email and I wouldn&#39;t call it that when describing it to Seth (he<br/>
would make that determination on his own).  I have also heard many stories<br/>
of people saying the kid(s) are 15 and either getting away with it OR the<br/>
most extreme was that the child was connecting flights and they asked for<br/>
her ID, when she couldn&#39;t produce proof of being 15 they held her at the<br/>
airport until her father flew to get her and escort her to her final<br/>
destination.  It ended up costing the family much more than the fee they<br/>
were trying to avoid.  <br/>
My biggest beef with the escort is the cost.  I understand the protection<br/>
and peace of mind it might provide and that it is kind of a CYA thing for<br/>
the airlines but Seth is fully capable of flying alone and overcoming any<br/>
hiccups that might happen along the way.  Since I know he will do just fine<br/>
on his own, I find it irritating that we would have to pay a fee just<br/>
because they think we need it - let us make that determination.  If we had<br/>
the &quot;extra&quot; $200 laying around it wouldn&#39;t be this huge of a deal but with<br/>
buying a house, a baby on the way and the rising cost of everything - $200<br/>
is a big deal when it is not a necessity. There has been mention of a<br/>
possible waiver and I will look into that as well.  <br/>
I have looked online at several of the airlines and there are at least 3<br/>
that do require the &#39;escort&#39; and the fees have been the same ($100 each<br/>
way).  But there are 2 so far that don&#39;t require it for those over 11 or 12<br/>
(Seth will be 14 at time of travel).  One is Southwest but they do not fly<br/>
into Eugene, OR - it doesn&#39;t rule them out, rather it opens options of<br/>
possibly finding other campers coming from Portland that are willing to<br/>
transport him to and from camp.  The other is United and they do fly into<br/>
Eugene, OR making them an easier choice though not necessarily the best.  <br/>
I still have a ton of research to do, connections to make (I did request<br/>
joining the Portland, OR Unschooling yahoo group and will be contacting NBTS<br/>
campers in the Portland area), and discussions to have.  I wouldn&#39;t have<br/>
come this far so quickly without everyone&#39;s input and I am so very grateful!<br/>
Thanks again to everyone.<br/>
 <br/>

Subject: Travel Experience anyone? (xposted)<br/>
 <br/>
Seth is going to NBTSC this year (in Oregon) and we are discovering that for<br/>
a minor under 15 to travel alone (unaccompanied minor) the airlines require<br/>
an additional fee of $100 both ways and will escort the kids from gate to<br/>
gate and basically babysit them.  All that would be great if Seth weren&#39;t a<br/>
pretty independent and competent kid who will be 14 at the time of travel<br/>
and would find having a babysitter appalling.  My first inclination is to<br/>
just say he is 15 and hope for the best but I worry that they will ask for<br/>
birth certificate for proof.  I am wondering if anyone here has experience<br/>
with this or knows someone who does?  <br/>
 <br/>

<br/>
You don&#39;t get to tell them not to worry about their liability.  They  <br/>
have legal obligations.<br/>
<br/>
With a connecting flight, there could be problems like an overnight  <br/>
stay or terrorists.  Then $100 or $200 would be a bargain.<br/>
<br/>
-=-There has been mention of a possible waiver and I will look into  <br/>
that as well. -=-  Right.  That was me, not everyone on every list.   <br/>
There might be a formal way to get a notarized paper saying you  <br/>
understand, he&#39;s flown, he&#39;s mature... whatever it might say. Maybe  <br/>
not.  I thought it might be worth checking, early on, perhaps.<br/>
<br/>
-=-If we had the &quot;extra&quot; $200 laying around it wouldn&#39;t be this huge  <br/>

<br/>
Sounds like he can&#39;t afford to go to camp.<br/>
<br/>
Since you don&#39;t own an airplane (I&#39;m guessing you don&#39;t), then you DO  <br/>
have to agree to other people&#39;s conditions.<br/>

Once a topic of discussion is out here, it&#39;s here to help anyone who  <br/>
might have had the same question.  If we keep talking about it, it&#39;s  <br/>
not about you and your particular child or situation; it&#39;s about the  <br/>
idea.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes by in a month or two years and posts more to that  <br/>
topic, it will be fine with me.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce wrote this, once, and it&#39;s good to remember of this list:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The list is about ideas, not about people.<br/>
Think of ideas like balls and the list like a ball court. If someone  <br/>
tosses an idea worth discussing into the court it&#39;s going to get  <br/>
batted about. At that point what&#39;s going on is no longer about the  <br/>
person who tossed the idea in. It&#39;s about the idea and how well and  <br/>
cleanly it&#39;s being tossed about. (Unless the tosser keeps jumping in  <br/>
and grabbing the idea ball saying &quot;Mine!&quot;)<br/>

<br/>
Why does the other list need to hear something that was written about  <br/>
this list, though?  When Joyce wrote it, she was referring to this  <br/>
list specifically.   Other lists might not have that bent toward  <br/>
discussing ideas.<br/>
<br/>
Most lists, it seems, have a lot of chit-chatty time waste, and I  <br/>
never wanted that from the beginning, and have tried to throw that  <br/>
reminder in from time to time.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to quote it on another list that&#39;s fine, but say it&#39;s of  <br/>
and about another list.<br/>
