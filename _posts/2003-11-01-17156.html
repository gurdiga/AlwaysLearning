<div id="ygrps-yiv-2106306383">Marty went as a broken condom.  That&#39;s scary two ways.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Holly went with other unschoolers.  One woman said &quot;Did you kids have fun at <br/>
school today?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Holly said &quot;I didn&#39;t go to school today.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The woman indicated curiosity (vague in the report) and Holly said they were <br/>
homeschooled.<br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;Well you don&#39;t know what you&#39;re missing!! I&#39;m a teacher!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Huh.  I thought that was weird (more trick than treat) and time passed, and <br/>
when I was with Holly in the bed in the dark (the boys were spending the night <br/>
in another town, having driven to a party), she said &quot;I should go to school <br/>
next year.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Me, suave and cool, which is easier in the dark:  <br/>
&quot;Okay.  Why?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;For the experience.&quot;<br/>

Isn&#39;t that scary!???<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yeah....<br/>
<br/>
But Lexie needed a &quot;school&quot; experience, and it helped her to NEVER want <br/>
to go back.  Of course, it was with a bunch of (christain) homeschoolers <br/>
who pickedo n her cause she was the only black kid with glasses they&#39;d <br/>
ever seen (I only heard this afterwards!) and there was a great deal of <br/>
misbehaving and very little learning, oh wait--that is a real school <br/>
experience, she just had it one day a week for a semester instead of <br/>
five days a week. <br/>
<br/>
Lexie went trickor treating as a gymnist.  Janene as Tinkerbell.  This <br/>
is the very first year both my girls went as relatively female <br/>
characters.  Last year Lexie was a dictionary and Janene was Dobby.  The <br/>
year before Janene was a pirate and Lexie was something else masculine.  :-)<br/>

  We did halloween for the second time in their little lives, third if you count the time they couldn&#39;t remember.  They had so much fun trick or treating, and the make up!  Poor kids, I denied them halloween fun for some dumb reasons.  I&#39;m so sorry, I almost started crying last night just watching them.<br/>

(you mean I have a day?)  Well he said, &quot;we went out on the playground, came in, did some work and then watched a movie.<br/>
  He did not know what the movie was about.  It made him sleepy and tired poor thing.  If this was my Caitlin I could here it now. Excuse me Mrs. Cappel, Caitlin keeps having outbursts about how terribly boring and stupid everything we do is.  Even though its truth, she can&#39;t say that LOL.  Caitlin 10,and Alyssa 12 would be interested in instant messaging Holly if she would like more friends online that unschool.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m getting all confuzzled over which threads are where in the last few<br/>
days, but you just discussed this (message board? Yes! to the unschooler who<br/>
had &quot;issues&quot; with unschooling) and pointed out that she didn&#39;t have more<br/>
experience just because she&#39;d been on the receiving end of unschooling and<br/>
not the doing end. Just as schoolers only know school, always-unschooled<br/>
kids only know unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
And that&#39;s true. The strongest, most vocal advocates for unschooling are the<br/>
people who have experienced both. We know why it&#39;s better. Our kids will<br/>
only know it as a good childhood. (Well, Kat had 2 months of school so does<br/>
have some point of reference but it won&#39;t have the same power of persuasion<br/>
as 12 years in the system.)<br/>
<br/>
Our kids will be great models of what unschooling can do, but those who&#39;ve<br/>
only been unschooled won&#39;t be great advocates. They can&#39;t be. They will have<br/>
experienced the other side of the coin from schooled kids, but neither will<br/>
have experienced both sides.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s just something that is.<br/>

&lt;&lt; &gt; Marty went as a broken condom.  That&#39;s scary two ways.<br/>
<br/>
Please describe his costume... &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
He had his head newly shaved and he wore a pretty nice rooster mask Keith won <br/>
at a work party a couple of Christmases ago.<br/>
<br/>
He wore thermal underwear, and over that his main costume piece, a long <br/>
plastic bag.  Heavy plastic.  I&#39;m guessing it was over a wooden filing cabinet or <br/>
some such.   It fit him shoulders to ankles.  <br/>
<br/>
He had asked me for help figuring out how to make shoes out of volleyballs.  <br/>
It wasn&#39;t going to work the way he was hoping.  So I suggested fastening balls <br/>
(playground/foursquare balls) on the front of his ankle somehow.  Our <br/>
brainstorming led to cloth bags to fasten behind his leg and under his shoe.  It <br/>
nearly worked.   We shopped in the bridal section for something nettish that the <br/>
balls would show through.  GUESS WHAT COLOR!?    Yeah.  And so we got tulle and <br/>
when we got to the counter there was exactly matching blue velcro!   (&quot;She <br/>
wore bulooooo Velcro, bluer than Velcro was the night...&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
He ended up buying blue duct tape to hold the bottom part under his shoe.   <br/>
<br/>
It wasn&#39;t a great design, but when a kid wears a costume to a party, it only <br/>
has to be in perfect condition right at the beginning.<br/>
<br/>
That party they went to started with a scavenger hunt.  The hostess, knowing <br/>
everyone pretty well, divided them into three teams so that each team had a <br/>
driver legal to drive more than one other person, and each had someone from the <br/>
little towns around there (Edgewood/Stanley/Moriarty).    I haven&#39;t heard the <br/>
whole scavenger list, but it couldn&#39;t be anything already in the car or at <br/>
their house. They got a kit which includeda points for orange), an egg, two rolls <br/>
of toilet paper, a carrot, maybe some other stuff, and road kill (highest <br/>
points).   The plastic bag was for the road kill.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby&#39;s team found a dead rabbit.<br/>
<br/>
Marty&#39;s team trick-or-treated at a house, and when they guy came they asked <br/>
him if they could please have an egg and a carrot instead of candy.  He gave <br/>
them to them!<br/>
<br/>
Everybody got a grave rubbing.  One team went to a pet cemetary and did a <br/>
dog&#39;s gravestone.  Marty&#39;s team found someone born in 1882 or so.    Died in the <br/>
1980&#39;s, over 100 years old.<br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt; Just as schoolers only know school, always-unschooled<br/>
kids only know unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And that&#39;s true. The strongest, most vocal advocates for unschooling are the<br/>
people who have experienced both. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know.  It wouldn&#39;t kill Holly to go to school (well I meant that <br/>
figuratively, and I don&#39;t want to think about literally) AND I don&#39;t think she&#39;d stay <br/>
too long.  But I don&#39;t want to &quot;have interface&quot; with them.   I had a friend once <br/>
say I was homeschooling selfishly, for my sake not Kirby&#39;s.  It wasn&#39;t true.  <br/>
But this one might be true.  I don&#39;t want to mess with school.  I can hardly <br/>
stand to mess with some of the other homeschoolers sometimes with their snarky <br/>
comments about making kids &quot;do their work,&quot; or like tonight  a couple who <br/>
came to check on their kid (one of the youngest, and they checked halfway through <br/>
because they were in the neighborhood).  He was ALL excited about something <br/>
downstairs and said &quot;COME LOOK AT THIS THING!&quot;  and his mom immediately said <br/>
&quot;No.&quot;  And she meant it.  And she seems to think consistency is more important <br/>
than reason.   He said &quot;Please?&quot; and pulled her hand.  She pulled away and said <br/>
no.   The dad said if it was Barbieland he&#39;d seen it.  &quot;Trust me, I&#39;ve seen <br/>
it,&quot; he said and said the sister&#39;s name (who couldn&#39;t make the party) had shown <br/>
it to him at least three times.<br/>
<br/>
As far as I know the man has never been in my home.  MAYBE he saw Barbieland <br/>
once when I wasn&#39;t home.   But &quot;Trust me&quot; from a dad who&#39;s lying because he&#39;s <br/>
too lazy to walk ten steps and spend five minutes looking at something his <br/>
child is excited about is infuriating.<br/>
<br/>
So if I can&#39;t deal with invited homeschoolers how would I deal with parents <br/>
of other kids, with teachers who are DYING to &#39;prove&#39; homeschoolers aren&#39;t <br/>
going to keep up or whatever?   <br/>
<br/>
But Holly has visited school before three times, and she was REALLY excited <br/>
and has discussed the minutest details of those days, as though she were an <br/>
anthropologist studying a newly discovered Amazon tribe.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll want to go, and I think if she does go she won&#39;t stay <br/>
long, but sheesh!!!  Sheesh.<br/>
<br/>
I could use having a few days of no sickness, no deadlines, no hospital <br/>
visits, no emptying my mom&#39;s cathether bag...   Holly thinking of school sounds <br/>
like more of THAT stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she was just trying to give me a big Halloween scare.<br/>
She did it.<br/>

And Moly would always welcome more emailing with other kids too. I promised <br/>
her I would help her set up a chat since the last one went so well... I&#39;ve been <br/>
busy and I&#39;ve put her off, which I shouldn&#39;t do especially now when she is at <br/>
a difficult time in her life. I&#39;m having surgery in just over a week and so I <br/>
need to set one up soon. So tell Holly and Caitlin and Alyssa and any others <br/>
interested I will attempt to set one up sometime this week. <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:GirlOracle@...">GirlOracle@...</a><br/>

But Holly has visited school before three times, and she was REALLY excited and has discussed the minutest details of those days, as though she were an anthropologist studying a newly discovered Amazon tribe.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think she&#39;ll want to go, and I think if she does go she won&#39;t stay <br/>
long, but sheesh!!!  Sheesh.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll add a YIKES to your sheesh!  As a former teacher, I definitely hear you on the teachers-on-a-mission issue.  Whenever a kid transferred to our high school from an alternative school or entered school after homeschooling, many of my colleagues just couldn&#39;t wait to point out all the poor student&#39;s &quot;deficiencies.&quot;  Much catty talk ensued about how &quot;those people&quot; are ruining their children&#39;s lives, so I understand your dread.<br/>
<br/>
I would always tell my fellow teachers--with a big smile, of course--about how I planned to homeschool (wouldn&#39;t even understand the word &quot;unschool&quot;) any kids I may have.  Those homeschoolers were some of the most alive, interesting students in my classroom.  (&quot;My&quot; classroom -- shudder.)<br/>
<br/>
When I left, I explained my reasons for doing so as clearly as possible to my students.  This is what one former homeschooler, new to schooling, wrote to me:<br/>
&quot;I enjoyed having you as a teacher so much!  You are the first person that trusted me to make my own decisions for myself w/o really being accountable for everything.  I will always rember your philosophies, and may even use them a mom someday!  Thank-you for sharing!  Good luck on your future.  I&#39;m sure it will be a good one!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, if it&#39;s any consolation, maybe Holly will brighten some poor, half-insane teacher&#39;s day.  Maybe she can anonymously leave copies of Llewellyn&#39;s Teenage Liberation Handbook in the bathroom.  Maybe she could start the STLF (Student and Teacher Liberation Front).  Maybe...the possibilities are endless.  :)  <br/>

&lt;&lt; How old is Holly?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Twelve as of today.  She would be a sixth grader this year, I think.  Maybe <br/>
7th.   I don&#39;t know what the birthday cutoff is these years.<br/>
<br/>
She said &quot;next year&quot; when she mentioned it, and maybe by next year or next <br/>
week she&#39;ll have no further interest in it, but I figured we could find out <br/>
where the nearest middle school is (I don&#39;t even know, but right at this moment <br/>
there are three kids upstairs who went there, one who might still).   I have a <br/>
friend who works at a private school, teaching history.  Maybe I could ask her <br/>
if Holly could go for a week trial-run or something--to see who I&#39;d have to <br/>
ask and what it would cost, and whether they&#39;d be willing to let a homeschooler <br/>
have a limited run without razzing the hell out of her.<br/>
<br/>
 Maybe we could park near the midschool a time or two as kids are coming and <br/>
going and she could watch them and see what she thinks.   She does a lot of <br/>
her impression getting on an emotional level.  If the look/feel like they&#39;re <br/>
having fun, she&#39;ll be intrigued.  If they seem mean or unhappy, she won&#39;t be.<br/>

Same thing with Will.  Went to a school for a Halloween party last weekend.  <br/>
All the classrooms were closed up, but BOY was he impressed with the school.  <br/>
I don&#39;t want him to go.  I think I&#39;m even going to have to register him if we <br/>
move back to Arkansas, and that makes me sick to my stomach just to think <br/>
about.  I don&#39;t think he&#39;d stay long, either.  But Ick.  Makes me shiver.  I AM <br/>
selfish about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The schools in our area are quite impressive - they are big, bright, clean, and well organized with all that cool stuff just waiting to be played with.  What my kids don&#39;t usually consider is that the kids DON&#39;T just sit around playing with it whenever and however they please.<br/>
<br/>
We are reading The Meanest Doll in the World.  It is the sequel to The Doll People, which we really enjoyed.  I am reading it to the girls at bedtime and I am CENSORING as I read!  In this book, the two dolls become stowaways and end up spending a day in school.  They are so impressed by everything they have been *missing*.  I have actually been skipping sentences that refer to how glorious school is.  It just reeks of that &quot;school is so wonderful aren&#39;t you lucky to go&quot; attitude.   In case anyone wonders,  I do not recommend this book, although I do still recommend the Doll People.  It is a fun story.  We first listened to it on audio tape, but the book has nice illustrations.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-213302002">I remember when Syd did this.  It was too funny.  We were taking bets on <br/>
how long she would last.   Lexie couldn&#39;t believe Sydney would even <br/>
think about doing this.  No one was surpised when she didn&#39;t want to <br/>
return. <br/>
<br/>
LExie SO does NOT want to go to school, ever ever ever.  Even with <br/>
current dramatics of the fact she has ABSOLUTELY NO FRIENDS, and NEVER <br/>
GOES ANYWHERE and NEVER GETS TO PLAY WITH ANYONE, and NEVER SPENDS ANY <br/>
TIME WITH ANYONE HER OWN AGE (all of this said with the biggest amount <br/>
of DRAMA possible--I&#39;d swear those hormones were about to start.)   She <br/>
still wants nothing about school.<br/>
<br/>
(and after we discussed that she does a minimum of one thing with kids <br/>
her own age each day of the week except Sunday and increasing her <br/>
outdoor boundries, Lexie is doing better with the above issues, and has <br/>
found a friend in the neighborhood (who goes to school but is still <br/>
almost her age (9) and lives fairly close, Lexie is feeling better about <br/>
the entire issue.<br/>
<br/>
Janene on the other hand wishes to go to school next year just try it <br/>
and to learn to read.  Last night I wanted to scream as Janene did <br/>
worksheets in a workbook and then had Lexie grade them, insisting that <br/>
Lexie give her an &quot;A&quot; or a &quot;B&quot; .  Janene was even saying things like &quot;I <br/>
did terrible on this one, I deserve an &quot;F&quot;.  AHHHH.<br/>
<br/>
I know that in reality Janene would not last as long as Syd did,and that <br/>
next year is a long time away and she is on the verge of reading and may <br/>
be reading (or may not and be OK with it) by that time, etc.  But still, <br/>
the idea of my child in a school creeps me out.  I was very good though <br/>
and simply said &quot;Janene, you can read without going to school&quot; and <br/>
&quot;well, we&#39;ll discuss it next year then.&quot;<br/>

============<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.<br/>
I forwarded that part to Holly. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly and I joked yesterday with a teen friend (who&#39;s homeschooling now but <br/>
who went to school for nine years) that Holly and I could write a heck of an <br/>
expose if Holly went from school to school just staying until she got tired of <br/>
it. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
It would be way more disruptive than I&#39;m even willing to imagine, though, but <br/>
the plan we came up with was for me to always write and say that I really <br/>
didn&#39;t want her there, but they were welcome to make it fun enough that she might <br/>
stay.   The further fantasy plan was any time Holly asked &quot;why?&quot; or &quot;what is <br/>
this for?&quot; she should pointedly write down the answer. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think she&#39;s decided against it.<br/>
