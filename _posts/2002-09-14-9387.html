&lt;&lt;   Pigs in slop, as it were, Woodstockians in mud, Me on a warm sandy <br/>
 beach...lolling about and absorbing.  When a newbie starts mucking about <br/>
 and asking why &#39;slop, mud or sand&#39; and not concrete, we throw bits of slop, <br/>
 mud and sand at them until they get the idea that they sometimes have to <br/>
 figure stuff out for themselves and sometimes just *doing* it will show <br/>
 them everything they ever wanted to know. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
LOL!<br/>
I like the visual here Heidi, thanks!<br/>

Ren, with loads of mud and sand to muck about it......</div>
