<div id="ygrps-yiv-614789571">I am 37 years old and was labeled as a child.  I was considered to be<br/>
hyperactive.  I was on medication from 7 till 11.  Then one time I fell and<br/>
hit my head, next thing I knew I was epileptic and on another medication.<br/>
My whole childhood I heard everyone in the family say, &quot;she&#39;s hyper&quot;. I grew<br/>
up embarrassed, ashamed, and with the feeling that I was not capable of<br/>
anything.  I would pray and say, &quot;Please God, let me grow out of this&quot;.  My<br/>
mothers&#39; bookshelves (notice I said, my mothers and not the families<br/>
bookshelves...gives you some insight here) were filled with &quot;help that<br/>
child&quot; books.  I saw them and I heard her talk to other people about me. I<br/>
visited the doctors with the bright colored waiting rooms so they could<br/>
reaffirm that I was a rotten kid who needed help.  In my twenties, people<br/>
still used the term about me, &quot;ohhh, your so hyper&quot;.  So my twenties were<br/>
depressing.  I found ways of escape.  Needless to say, I excelled in the<br/>
workforce.  I was a great multi-tasker and leader, but because of those deep<br/>
labels I still felt very insecure about my abilities.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I have an incredible daughter whom many feel the need to say to me,<br/>
&quot;wow, she&#39;s hyper&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have never and never will buy any &quot;hyperactive&quot; books or materials.  I<br/>
will never join a group to discuss her hyperness or to get ideas on how to<br/>
deal with her. RU is acceptance and that is working for us.  She knows that<br/>
she is amazing, loved, and fun to be with.  When someone says something<br/>
about her like, &quot;she&#39;s hyper&quot;, I shut him or her down immediately.  It<br/>
always cracks me up how another parent feels they can say my daughter is<br/>
hyper, but I would never look at another parent and say something like, &quot;oh,<br/>
your child just sits there, what&#39;s wrong with them&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know that my daughter is going to grow up being secure of her choices and<br/>
who she is because of the choices her father and I make.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
By the way, I find it funny how in my 30&#39;s most of the women I know cannot<br/>
understand how I can get so much done and do so much.  Isn&#39;t it funny how<br/>
labels change their meaning as you get older...so why label at all.  I even<br/>
thought of deleted this and not sending it.  To me, putting this down could<br/>
even place in my mind something that could change my course and dealings<br/>
with my daughter.  But I am going to send it because I know from experience<br/>
what any type of labeling can do to a kid.<br/>

THANK you for sharing all of that.  It&#39;s right at the heart of why I  <br/>
dislike labelling.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been insulted (as a kid and as an adult) by people saying I  <br/>
couldn&#39;t POSSIBLY have actually done this or that, because there  <br/>
hadn&#39;t been time.  I&#39;m just fast.  I&#39;ve been insulted by people for  <br/>
posting so much and having such a big website. &lt;g&gt;  Honestly.  I read  <br/>
fast, I type fast, it&#39;s not hard work at all.  I don&#39;t need much  <br/>
sleep.  I can talk fast.  I have to sometimes consciously speak more  <br/>
slowly and it feels like slow motion.<br/>
<br/>
I see all that in Holly.  Holly&#39;s talkative.  Holly&#39;s energetic.   <br/>
Holly could have adults demanding she be drugged to a slower speed if  <br/>
she were put at the mercy of other adults, but Holly&#39;s fine and  <br/>
Holly&#39;s home.  She doesn&#39;t HAVE to be around 29 other kids who are  <br/>
being inconvenienced by her.  She doesn&#39;t HAVE to have friends or  <br/>
marry someone who won&#39;t appreciate her for what she is.  She doesn&#39;t  <br/>
HAVE to find ways to fill a 55 minute class period after she&#39;s &quot;done  <br/>
the work&quot; in ten or fifteen minutes, as I did year after year after  <br/>
year.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s nothing wrong with &quot;hyperactivity.&quot;  There&#39;s something wrong  <br/>
with trying to make everyone the same speed, to press the slower  <br/>
moving kids to hurry and the zippy kids to slow down.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works the same for all of them.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry, Crystal, that people weren&#39;t more accepting of your  <br/>
particular pace and activity level.  Sorry about the meds.<br/>
<br/>
