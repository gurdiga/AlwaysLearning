<div id="ygrps-yiv-1045979901">Back in July 2011 I had written (in a post titled &quot;Mums and computers&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt; There is a park across the street and there was a fete for July 14th<br/>
&gt; (french<br/>
&gt; &gt; national day) with fireworks. He had been excited to go, but on the day,<br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; felt it was to tiring to walk there!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And Meredith had answered:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; You&#39;re jumping to a conclusion on very very slim evidence! Fatigue and<br/>
&gt; sudden weight gain don&#39;t say &quot;computers&quot; to me - in my family that<br/>
&gt; combination usually says &quot;thyroid&quot;. If he&#39;s having fatigue and/or<br/>
&gt; metabolic issues, that could account for him wanting to do something<br/>
&gt; sedentary.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, after months of seeing him putting on weight and being always<br/>
fatigued and tired, I finaly took my son to an endocrinologist. And the<br/>
blood tests are just back: his TSH level is abnormaly high. So you were<br/>
right Meredith: thyroid it is.<br/>
<br/>
I would love to read about other peoples experience with children who have<br/>
thyroïd issues. I am trying to educate myself and everything I read points<br/>
to medication + diet and I would love to read about how successfull<br/>
unschoolers have tackled thyroid issues...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1552183008">Please, please, please go to stopthethyroidmadness.com and start reading.  I&#39;m working on my own thyroid issues at the moment and this site has been a godsend.  It&#39;s a mistake to go by the TSH alone, and then to use a T4-only medication.  If your doctor won&#39;t order the tests that really show what&#39;s going on accurately (T3, free T3, free T4, antibodies, etc), you can order them yourself.  Since you asked for info from anyone who&#39;s had a child with thyroid issues (and I don&#39;t) I won&#39;t post my own thyroid story, but if anyone wants more info feel free to email me.<br/>

P.S. The author of the site I linked to can sound a little...hyper :) - don&#39;t let that put you off.  When you read about how many people are misdiagnosed for years on end, the passion at wanting to counter that is understandable. <br/>
