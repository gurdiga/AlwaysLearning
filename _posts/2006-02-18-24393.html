paper he wrote on, not a small piece of string, not a small stick, not a <br/>
thumbtack he found on the playground, not anything EVER AT ALL.**<br/>

:) Some kid are like that. They sometimes grow up to be museum curators.<br/>

An interesting article on kids and the urge to collect and keep. The rest of <br/>
the site is pretty cool, too. I particularly enjoyed the pictures of stored <br/>
cicada skins, since there are quite a few of those in residence at my house too, <br/>
though not quite as attractively stored. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2121202495">Thanks for the website Deborah...I really enjoyed it. My oldest keeps  <br/>
everything, and for the longest time I didn&#39;t respect the value he  <br/>
had placed on stuff that I felt had no importance. I&#39;m so glad to  <br/>
have let it go. His dresser is overflowing though! For the first time  <br/>
ever (he&#39;s eleven) he voluntarily went through and got rid of stuff  <br/>
(papers from kindergarten actually lol!)<br/>
