<div id="ygrps-yiv-1494234221">A photographer quoting another photographer, but this reminded me deeply of things we&#39;ve talked about, about unexpected connections, and unseen futures.  Yesterday I made a new page on unseen futures, and so cleaning out my e-mail this morning, I saw that I had missed one of these mailings.  <br/>
<br/>

Anthony Epes wrote:<br/>
<br/>
This week I’m exploring that really cool concept of ‘indirect inspiration’ that I quoted in my post about Ernst Haas. To be honest, it’s not something I’d thought about much until I was writing about Ernst Haas and came across this quote. Haas warned against seeking too much direct inspiration as it “leads too quickly to repetitions of what inspired you,” and instead recommends you to “refine your senses through the great masters of music, painting, and poetry. In short, try indirect inspirations, and everything will come by itself.”<br/>

I&#39;m glad someone (Janine, I think) pointed me toward the Anthony Epes mailings.  You can subscribe to his blog mailings, if you&#39;re interested in photography, or just looking at his photos, or reading about process and seeing and connections.<br/>
<br/>
I know lots of photographs are being taken in and by unschooling families, too.  <br/>
<br/>
Because of a photo on a collage of photos on a Christmas card she sent me, I&#39;ve been using photos by Chrissy Florence, on Just Add Light and Stir.<br/>
The one I loved so much, I haven&#39;t even used yet.  I&#39;m saving it to match up with a perfect quote.<br/>

<br/>
Our own children can be as inspiring as the great masters of music, painting and poetry, I think.  Seeing, with love, our children&#39;s exuberant moments and peaceful moments can bring as much artistry to our souls as anything in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Julie Daniel takes lots of photos of Adam, as I took lots of Holly (and still do).  Adam and Holly both love to be in Just Add Light. :-)<br/>
I&#39;ve taken photos of Adam, too.  One of the set of magnets is Adam.<br/>
Julie&#39;s taken photos of Holly and Adam!<br/>

<br/>
If you search Just Add Light for &quot;Julie D &quot; you can see more of hers.<br/>
<br/>
Photo by Julie, Holly&#39;s words<br/>

<br/>
There are others whose photos I&#39;ve used.  I&#39;ll cite some in other e-mails, but if I leave you out, please forgive me.  I get distracted and have many little projects building, and languishing, all around me. :-)<br/>

Those are in Albuquerque, familiar images, but specially seen—of a park, with Explora in the back; at the zoo; chickens in her yard.<br/>
<br/>
If you search Jonick in the upper left search box on the blog, you can see others.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1098572078">Sorry I got distracted yesterday and didn&#39;t continue my credits and thanks. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Karen James took photos when her family visited Japan, and has let me use other photos of hers since then.<br/>
<br/>
Because I didn&#39;t credit her properly a few times, there is a post with links here: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2014/04/crediting-karen-james-for-photos.html">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/2014/04/crediting-karen-james-for-photos.html</a><br/>
<br/>
And you can look at her blog from the trip to Japan directly: <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://jamesfaminjapan.blogspot.com">http://jamesfaminjapan.blogspot.com</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve probably used Karen&#39;s words as often as her photos, but we&#39;re talking about photos here. :-)<br/>
This has her photo and her words both:<br/>

has a beautiful sun-and-kayak image which is also here, which also has links to Just Add Light photos:<br/>

Please spend a few moments clicking through those and feeling the peace and wonder in those images.  Gather some up for your own use today. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1893873494">When I opened Just Add Light and Stir at the blog this morning (click on the title, in your e-mail, if you get them that way), I saw the geography of the photos.  From the current Big-Bird photo backwards:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Long Beach, California<br/>
Santa Fe, New Mexico<br/>
Shelburne, Vermont<br/>
border of Colorado/NewMexico<br/>
Owslebury, Hampshire<br/>
Kuranda, Queensland<br/>
Leiden, Netherlands<br/>
<br/>
The next page had Bea Mantovani&#39;s mermaid photo; I don&#39;t know whether they were in France or Australia.<br/>

<br/>
Another Vermont, Netherlands, some Albuquerque, and <br/>
this from Portugal:<br/>

<br/>
I do love the internet&#39;s current ease of photo sharing.  These images are shared with you sometimes when they&#39;re freshly new.  Sometimes (as with Kate Koetsier jumping hurdles in Hampshire) a few years after they were taken—flashbacks to younger unschoolers, now taller and living elsewhere and knowing more.<br/>
<br/>
Writing doesn&#39;t do that.  Ben Hur was written in Santa Fe and Indiana.  I know this because the Santa Fe parts were written while the author was governor of the New Mexico Territory.<br/>
The Jungle Book was written in Vermont.  <br/>
<br/>
But photos, especially when I know the subject or the photographer, have a place and a time that writing can lose or hide.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for taking photos and for sharing them with your friends and relatives, and sometimes with other unschoolers. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1947047175">Janine Davies takes photos of her family doing fun things.   There is light, in her photos, very often.  Sometimes it&#39;s coming from lamps, or the sun, but as often it&#39;s coming from inside her subject.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/search?q=janine+davies">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com/search?q=janine+davies</a><br/>
<br/>
I think that link will lead you to a series of them.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/janine">http://sandradodd.com/janine</a> has some others.<br/>
<br/>
Her family plans to visit New Mexico sometime in the next couple of years, and I look forward to what she will see that I missed.<br/>
