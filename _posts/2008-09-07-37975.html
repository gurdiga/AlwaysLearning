<div id="ygrps-yiv-291396830">Go to the Lego website and find their career section.  If nothing&#39;s listed,<br/>
consider email the &quot;contact us&quot; link to get info on the questions you&#39;re<br/>
asking.  They can explain their hiring process as it stands now and by the<br/>
time Zac is ready though the process may look different then you will have<br/>
some idea of what job titles are and most important it would be great to get<br/>
the job descriptions and requirements and stuff.<br/>

There are unemployed college grads, and college grads working  <br/>
alongside unschooled kids (this I know for certain) and high school  <br/>
grads.  One difference is the college grads generally have student  <br/>
loans to pay off or are getting family grief for not either getting a  <br/>
hoity job or going back to school.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1823431205">Oh exactly, that is the conversation we had with him - that college is not necessary to have a &quot;good&quot; life.  That enjoying what you do is much more important.  He is 14 and just starting to explore various points of view I think.  When we asked him why he thought that a college degree was necessary, he said something about that is what he hears on TV and all over the place.  He has never ever heard it from us, though we did tell him that if he chooses to go we will help if he wants it. We did brain storm all the various &quot;jobs&quot; / things he could do to &quot;make a living&quot; that do not require a degree.  I really think that conversation stimulated his wondering if and what jobs were available with Lego and the requirements - simply because he has been into Lego&#39;s this week.  Plus making Magic playing decks.  Our family room is covered with card stacks and Lego creations - he did leave a path to the back door though.  Some of this is why I was trying to help him explore what is available and what the requirements are.<br/>
<br/>
 His dad and I have college educations - I &quot;use&quot; mine and his dad never has.  I would say it was a waste of money but I met Ed in college so I won&#39;t say that :)  <br/>

Here is a guy that gave up his life as a corporate lawyer to make Lego art.  He said he was spending around 7000 per year on Legos anyway.  WOW!!!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thank you to everyone for the jump start in looking at more than &quot;jobs&quot; at Lego - we are finding tons of info on various options now that we took our blinders off.  This is what I was looking for - ideas for more than the traditional.<br/>

It also might be fun to attend a lego conference.  We are going to the<br/>
public exhibit part of BrickCon (Seattle) this fall but someone his<br/>
age can actually attend the conference as a participant although I<br/>
think a parent needs to come with him.  On top of all the fun stuff,<br/>
it would be interesting to see what jobs Lego lovers love - it could<br/>
be really helpful to him.<br/>

======================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby got his first job at 14 because when he was 13 he was at the  <br/>
game shop a lot, he was helpful, he wasn&#39;t any trouble, he was a draw  <br/>
(other kids came there because Kirby was there) and he would  <br/>
volunteer to help pick up chairs after games, or to vacuum, or when  <br/>
they were folding flyers to mail, he would offer to help.<br/>
<br/>
When he turned 14 they made him an employee and started paying him to  <br/>
run the Pokeman tournaments every Saturday morning.  Had he been a  <br/>
schoolkid, the idea of getting up early on a Saturday would&#39;ve  <br/>
probably been off-putting, but for Kirby, it was the only morning of  <br/>
the week he had to wake up at a certain time. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Another friend of his who really wanted a job was told some of that,  <br/>
and his immediate response was &quot;I&#39;m not going to help anyone for  <br/>
nothing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kirby didn&#39;t get the job *just* because he was voluntarily helpful.   <br/>
There were other factors.  But that was a factor.<br/>

<br/>
Right now he is off to check out a Panera Bread restaurant that hosts Magic The Gathering card playing tournaments that he found out about on TH.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks everyone for helping me to think outside the box - of other options besides getting a job with Lego the company or amusement park.  Not that those are not viable options of course - just that there is so much more out there that we had not heard of.<br/>
<br/>
And of course this is transferable to other interests - which I was wanting too - as he has many interests besides Lego - and probably many more to come.  Though war history, weaponry, political and social implications/causes/effects/, strategy; all aspects of war through out the world and time really and Lego&#39;s have been his passion since age 3 or 4.<br/>

For a while when Kirby was younger he wanted to work at Toys R Us.   <br/>
Then he wanted to work at Nintendo.  That was a consideration, once,  <br/>
when Keith was offered a transfer within the company, and one of the  <br/>
options was in Washington state.<br/>
<br/>
We didn&#39;t discourage Kirby at all, nor look up job requirements.  We  <br/>
kept letting him play Nintendo!  We kept him supplied and fed and at  <br/>
peace.<br/>
<br/>
Years passed, and he worked at a gaming shop which didn&#39;t hurt him a  <br/>
bit at all, and then he worked at a Pizza place with his gamer  <br/>
buddies from a different gaming shop, and now he works for Blizzard  <br/>
Entertainment.<br/>
<br/>
Working for Blizzard is kind of along the lines of Toys R Us and  <br/>
Nintendo, but when Kirby first talked about what he might like to do,  <br/>
Blizzard hardly existed (they were making some game cartridges, I  <br/>
think, for some Nintendo games, or something).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe what your son will want to do doesn&#39;t exist yet, but Lego will  <br/>
still be a step toward it.<br/>
<br/>
I think more likely, most companies hire people, and the value of a  <br/>
person is made of all the things he knows and likes and is confident  <br/>
about and competent in.  Lots of people have school credentials and  <br/>
transcripts.  Not many more have something different and more  <br/>
interesting.<br/>

<br/>

  Zac used to talk about owning Toys R Us ;)<br/>
  ~~~~~~~~<br/>
<br/>

  kept letting him play Nintendo! We kept him supplied and fed and at <br/>
  peace.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
  I agree totally - The only reason we were researching job requirements was Zac wanted to - he was wondering what is actually out there and he was thinking it took a college degree to get anywhere that pays well.  I really wanted him to see the flip side - that it would not necessarily take a college degree - depending upon what he wants to do of course.  If he wanted to be an emergency room nurse he&#39;d have to  get a degree.  If he wanted to be a paramedic - that takes a different type of program/schooling.  My sister is a nurse for babies at the local Children&#39;s Hospital - loves the job - college was the only avenue to that job.  BUT I wanted him to see the vast opportunities in addition to / instead of college.  I think he sees most all the local homeschoolers in our group - especially the unschooled ones for some reason - go to college early like around his age and he is beginning to think about things like this and explore options.<br/>
<br/>
  Lego&#39;s were a focus for the discussion that he was interested in exploring in depth at this moment in time.<br/>
<br/>
  Yesterday he was fanaticizing about if he had enough money he could start a wild animal rescue place - where people have wild (non-domesticated) animals such as tigers as pets and then figure out they cannot manage them nor their expenses so they end up at rescue places.<br/>
<br/>
  He dreams and talks the same as we do.  You know a lot of those: &quot;IF .....&quot;  or &quot;I would do .......&quot; conversations or &quot;It would be neat if I  .........&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  I also want him to realize that what he chooses to do is not the path he must stay on - like the corporate lawyer that chose to change and do Lego art.  If he does one thing and then he changes his mind that is fine too wether it is 1 year latter or 10 or 20 years later - change is fine.<br/>
<br/>
  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br/>
  Maybe what your son will want to do doesn&#39;t exist yet, but Lego will <br/>
  still be a step toward it.<br/>
<br/>
  exactly!  Could be - who knows?  Or maybe he&#39;ll play Lego&#39;s with his kid/kids really well someday ;)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
  Sandra <br/>
<br/>
  I agree,  this is the type of information we are trying to share with him as he explores.  Again, Thank You for helping us give words to some of our thoughts and helping us to help him explore.  We&#39;ve actually moved beyond job &quot;requirements&quot; just since I posted last night - thanks to this group ;)<br/>

My son just joined a local lego league.  We haven&#39;t even had our first<br/>
meeting yet, but perhaps your son could find out more about the company<br/>
through this?  Perhaps he could be a judge at a local lego league <br/>
event?  My son also subscribed to the free lego magazine and when I was<br/>
ordering it, I saw they have lego competitions on their website??<br/>
<br/>
Or, maybe he could start his own lego workshops!  I know if there was an<br/>
older lego &quot;master&quot; who was offering tips and ideas for a fee, my son<br/>
and his buddies would sign up in a second!  Or he could start a lego<br/>
help desk!  I know my sons lego abilities have outgrown mine and I am<br/>
often having trouble helping him when he gets stuck! [:D]<br/>
<br/>
Also, our engineering college (Iowa State University) offers lego<br/>
workshops (the robotics) courses for young kids for free.  If your local<br/>
college offers something like this maybe that would be a good place to<br/>
find out some information?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1147537740">Those are great suggestions but Zachariah does not like Lego robotics at all.  For some reason all the groups and clubs and classes out there are for the Lego robotics (that we&#39;ve found anyway) - I know we could try to start our own club but he enjoys making and building by himself, it is frustrating for him to try to work with anyone - he has a picture in his mind of how it should be and that is what he creates.<br/>

GREAT ideas about helping others and help desk, etc.  Thanks!<br/>
