That IS the internet version of Oh my Dodd, right?<br/>
I was laughing soooo hard on that park incident.....impaled on shards of <br/>
frozen cooler?  Someone has entirely too much time on their hands!!! Or too <br/>
creative maybe?<br/>
Oh, that&#39;s right. You&#39;re unschoolers...you have an abundance of BOTH!!! Cool.<br/>
<br/>
Welcome Cathy,<br/>
I thought I was Christian too....beginning to think I will convert to being a <br/>
Holtie.<br/>
LOL!<br/>
I&#39;m still chuckling...geez, you guys are so funny.<br/>
Sure, you can be an unschooler and Christian...in that order. Just kidding.<br/>
I guess I&#39;m a little leery of a lot of people that say Christian/unschooling <br/>
in the same breath because of many forms of control I see Christians using on <br/>
their kids...all in the name of God/religion, which bothers me.<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what Christ was all about anyway.<br/>
I love Jesus, I love what he taught, I love reading about him.<br/>
So I claim Christianity.<br/>
You aren&#39;t alone.  But I am not any one &quot;brand&quot; of Christian....so it&#39;s hard <br/>
to fit in sometimes. Which obviously bothers me a lot (using sarcastic voice).<br/>
I think there are some benefits to starting a Church of Holt here <br/>
folks..,....but first I want to see the robes. Being a makeup consultant, I <br/>
have to make sure it looks good on me!!! haha<br/>
Love your quote Patricia!<br/>
I gave my mom a little painting with a quote &quot;who walks the world with soul <br/>
awake finds beauty everywhere&quot;<br/>
I think it&#39;s a Frost quote? Can&#39;t remember now.<br/>
Anyway, it&#39;s a great line you posted.<br/>
