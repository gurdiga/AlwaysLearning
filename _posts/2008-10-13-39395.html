<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187030072">I&#39;ve been fooling around on the internet for a good 15 years, but I<br/>
never really got into social networks until now.  I joined RUN as it<br/>
sounded like fun and I joined facebook the other day so that I could<br/>
play scrabble with my sister.  I&#39;m not really sure of the etiquitte of<br/>
adding friends, though.  So far I&#39;ve just been initiating contact with<br/>
people I know and like in real life or people I have had private<br/>
conversations with online and that has been fine.<br/>
<br/>
The place I am having trouble is with people that I feel like I know<br/>
through bigger groups, but really don&#39;t know personally.  I have felt<br/>
inclined to add various people who write a lot here, especially if I<br/>
know them in some other way (say through a RUN group) but then I feel<br/>
like I&#39;m being too forward and I should leave them alone and give them<br/>
space to be friendly with their actual friends. If they wanted to add<br/>
me, they would.   On the other hand, I also post a lot on a regional<br/>
list that I started and I feel as though I shouldn&#39;t add people who<br/>
are in the group, lest they feel like they have to be friendly since<br/>
it&#39;s my group... I don&#39;t know if that makes any sense.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I don&#39;t feel as though I have a good feel for the<br/>
etiquitte of social networks and I would appreciate some advice :)<br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesn&#39;t seem too off topic... it seemed relevant to me but<br/>
I can imagine other interpretations.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<br/>
Etiquette is that you ask anyone to be your friend that you wish. If<br/>
they are keeping their friends list tight,they&#39;ll either let you know<br/>
or &quot;deny&quot; you as a friend. Most people add whomever asks. It&#39;s always<br/>
ok to ask though.:)<br/>
