<div id="ygrps-yiv-1744331045">This page is REALLY cool for a ton of reasons:<br/>

There are things that could easily be identified as science, math, art  <br/>
and music, but what&#39;s really cool is that the trash of the &quot;toys from  <br/>
trash&quot; name is all carefully photographed, and it&#39;s from India.  This  <br/>
won&#39;t be exotic to the listmembers from India, but indulge the rest of  <br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a toothpaste-tube pump.   I like looking at the toothpaste  <br/>
tube art better than thinking about making a pump!  (There&#39;s a whole  <br/>
section on pumps there.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-481036634">I am from India. This site is parked in my favorites all through three<br/>
computer crashes and reinstalls. I haunt this site. This is still<br/>
incredible. Delighted to run into it again. Hadn&#39;t been here for months.<br/>
<br/>
Never mind Nisarga, I&#39;m having a blast exploring this site without waiting<br/>
for my guy to grow up :D All in the name of research ;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for sharing.<br/>
