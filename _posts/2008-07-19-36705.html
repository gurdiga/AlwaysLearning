<div id="ygrps-yiv-2118244115">Arghhhh!!  Yeah.<br/>
<br/>
And it wasn&#39;t even *my* mom or *my* skirt.<br/>
<br/>
I have an ability to forget a lot and block things out.  Otherwise I&#39;d not<br/>
be over anything.  I might say (to myself not others) that&#39;s just the way<br/>
someone is (whoever does this kind of crap).  I might be able to think of<br/>
their as an affliction.  Because throwing away other people&#39;s things or not<br/>
respecting other&#39;s privacy really is a kind of affliction.  And if they do<br/>
it to some and not others, then it&#39;s a problem in all the relationships that<br/>
they behave that way in.  Boundaries being marched right over.<br/>
<br/>
With my folks, it was said that a child could earn respect but in reality<br/>
that so seldom happened that it might just as well have not been a<br/>
possibility at all, and I remember all too well that as a child I didn&#39;t<br/>
think of earning respect as a real possibility.  Instead, private letters<br/>
weren&#39;t private and neither was one&#39;s room.  Everything under a parent&#39;s<br/>
roof was just theirs to do with as they pleased and a child&#39;s stuff was not<br/>
their own.<br/>
<br/>
Carrot/stick approach to child behavior modification on top of that is mean<br/>
+ manipulative.  Yuck.<br/>

&gt; a lined orange pleated wool skirt. It needed to be dry cleaned. Dry<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-312002896">I used to have a small white with pastel stripes blankie that I<br/>
carried with me everywhere.  I loved my blankie.  It had satin edging<br/>
which I always called &quot;Mmmm&#39;s&quot;, because when you rubbed them on your<br/>
cheek you would say, &quot;Mmmmmmm.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When my grandmother decided I was too old for the blankie she would<br/>
cut a stripe off every day I visited.  Then I was left with only one<br/>
strip of &quot;Mmmm&#39;s&quot;.  Finally, I was separated from those too.<br/>

To this day, I have an unnatural attachment to blankets with satin<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Is an attachment to things we like unnatural?  People do like things.  I<br/>
think this kind of thought can lead people to disregard someone&#39;s attachment<br/>
to things.  As though ridding a child of a precious item will automatically<br/>
lead to forgetting the thing and letting it go.<br/>
<br/>
Many times letting go is another person&#39;s idea.<br/>
<br/>
We live in a world full of things.  Do we usually have conversations that go<br/>
like this?:  &quot;What do you like to collect or do you have a hobby or favorite<br/>
pasttime?  What do you do in your spare time?&quot;  &quot;Nothing.  I don&#39;t like<br/>
anything.&quot;  Don&#39;t we usually hear people come up with something or are at<br/>
least in the process of growing toward new interests?  People like their<br/>
TVs, to go by what I&#39;ve heard.  I like my computer, my books, making stuff,<br/>
making food ...  top faves.  I had a white stuff toy monkey which a dorm<br/>
mate envied and stole from me.  There was something about the eyes.  When I<br/>
saw it on her shelf, I just let her keep it.  That was the decision I went<br/>
with.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s understood that letting go is a choice and that, for letting go to<br/>
happen successfully, the person letting go must value the action, then force<br/>
isn&#39;t a consideration.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still quite attached to that little monkey in the lil Tarzan outfit.  I<br/>
don&#39;t think it&#39;s unnatural to be attached to things.<br/>

horrified by that sort of dessicration!   Her blanky was some sort of<br/>
hand knitted thing and it would&#39;ve changed it forever in a bad way.  She<br/>
still has that blanky, but none of her kids would use it because it&#39;s<br/>
too gross.  I had a blanky when I was a kid, I just wasn&#39;t attatched to<br/>
it.  My sister gave that one to her kids and they LOVE it.  I love it<br/>
too!  It&#39;s fun to see her babies wrapped up in my blanky.<br/>
<br/>
My mother in law remade a quilt that had belonged to her youngest son. <br/>
It was his blanky and he had almost worn it out, but it was a nice baby<br/>
quilt and really well made, so she fixed it and patched it and put new<br/>
things on it without drastically changing it.  Now he can see his kids<br/>
using it.  My husband wasn&#39;t so lucky with stuff like that because he<br/>
was the oldest and all his stuff either got handed down or thrown out. <br/>
He had kept a small bag of stuffed animals, but mice got to them, and<br/>
this was when I first met him before we had kids, and they had to be<br/>
tossed.  He&#39;s still sad about it!</div>

Only hers had white hair and a turquoise dress.  She called her<br/>
&quot;sweetie&quot; and every year at Christmas time she wanted to put her on top<br/>
of the tree.<br/>
<br/>
When my parents moved to NM, I found it in the get rid of stuff and<br/>
tucked it away.  Many years later I gave it to her oldest daughter for a<br/>
Christmas present along with the story.<br/>
<br/>
This was at a time when my sister pretty much got rid of everything from<br/>
her past.  I knew if I&#39;d given it to her she would&#39;ve tossed it, so I<br/>
gave it to her daughter so that it wouldn&#39;t belong to her!<br/>
<br/>
It really is a most hideous doll.  She&#39;s all ratty, but I fixed her up a<br/>
bit, so that we can still tease my sister about it.  Her kids LOVE to<br/>
put it in the tree at the grandparents house next door!  One of her kids<br/>
simply can&#39;t imagine why her mother liked that thing and two of her kids<br/>
adore it!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-80174083">I still have mine.  It was my nap time blanket at preschool (yup,  <br/>
preschool in 1960). It&#39;s threadbare in places, and I take it camping  <br/>
sometimes, still. My mum kept it for me, though I didn&#39;t know it for  <br/>
years. I think she was sentimental about it, too, and hung onto it  <br/>
until I moved out.<br/>

We have a Scholastic DVD of Kevin Henkes stories. One of them is about <br/>
a little mouse, Owen, who is very attached to his blanket. His <br/>
parents&#39; nosy neighbor keeps giving them parenting advice -- to force <br/>
Owen to give up his blanket. After unsuccessfully trying a number of <br/>
different tactics, Owen&#39;s mother eventually comes up with the idea of <br/>
cutting a little corner of the blanket off for Owen to secretly carry <br/>
in his pocket, thus assuaging the neighbor and presumably &quot;fixing&quot; the <br/>
problem of the blanket.<br/>
<br/>
I was so horrified!!!<br/>

Roya (now 23) had &quot;Lilly&quot; - a soft-bodied doll with a (gasp) plastic  <br/>
head. She loved Lilly to pieces. Literally. As Lilly would fall apart,  <br/>
we&#39;d fix her back up best we could. Finally, one day, her head totally  <br/>
fell off. My bil was here and he duct-taped her head back on with  <br/>
silver duct tape around her neck.<br/>
<br/>
Lilly is sitting on Roya&#39;s bed - well, what was her bed, but she&#39;s  <br/>
moved out into her own little house now. Left Lilly behind. I have  <br/>
Lilly&#39;s photo for the wallpaper on the front of my cell phone. She was  <br/>
such an important part of our lives for so long - I can&#39;t imagine  <br/>
tossing her out.<br/>

This reminds me of Tamzin&#39;s &#39;corner&#39;. When she was born, my former employer gave her a beautifully soft blanket from India. It very quickly became her favorite thing (understandably so!). It wasn&#39;t long before she wanted to take it everywhere with her. The problem was is that it was big! I cut it into 4 pieces and finished the cut sides and presto, she had 4 blankets! She was delighted (she was about 9 months old at this point)! She could now, easily, take any one of the blankets with us anywhere we went. Her favorite part of the blankets were the corners, so gradually she would &#39;love on it&#39; enough that the edge strip would come off and she would carry that around (that&#39;s how &#39;corner&#39; got it&#39;s name). We had a couple of traumatic times when one got left on the bus and another time when she &#39;lost&#39; one in her bedroom (we never did find it, even when we moved). Luckily we had backups. I still have a &#39;corner&#39; in my jewelery box and she has one in her<br/>
 &#39;special stuff&#39; box. I also made her a doll out of the body of one of the blankets that she keeps on her bed. I can&#39;t imagine taking that away from her! <br/>
I&#39;m also careful about what she says she&#39;s ready to get rid of. If it&#39;s something that&#39;s one of a kind or something that&#39;s been really special to her, I stash it in the garage, just in case. My mom asked me if we could sell my doll house (it was handmade by her) when I was 13. I said sure, I don&#39;t play with it anymore. I still regret that decision! <br/>
