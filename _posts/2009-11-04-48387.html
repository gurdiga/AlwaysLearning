<div id="ygrps-yiv-1007808730">Parodies are wonderful for effortless learning.   The one below was  <br/>
done by high school boys (gamers, I believe).  For people who like  <br/>
this, or Weird Al, I also recommend Asterix and Obelix comics.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Alexander the Great and the Terrible, Horrible, No Good Very Bad Day<br/>
<br/>
in the style of the children&#39;s story Alexander and the Terrible  <br/>
Horrible No Good Very Bad Day; written for Honors English 11 last year<br/>
<br/>
By William Aoki, Chris Condrat, and Ryan Merril-Johnson<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I left the battle with blood in my helmet and now there&#39;s blood in my  <br/>
hair and when I got out of my armor this afternoon I tripped on a dead  <br/>
solder and by mistake I dropped my sword in the catapult while the  <br/>
thing was launching and I could tell it was going to be a terrible,  <br/>
horrible, no good very bad day.<br/>
<br/>
At dinner Aristotle found a fat juicy rabbit in the tall overgrown  <br/>
grass and Demetrius found a striking young buck in the tall overgrown  <br/>
grass but in my tall overgrown grass all I found was tall overgrown  <br/>
grass.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;ll move to Carthage.<br/>
<br/>
In the march my bodyguard told Homer to have the left flank. Plato and  <br/>
Hephestus were told to take the right flank.  I said I was being  <br/>
scrunched. I said I was being smushed. I said if I don&#39;t get a place  <br/>
on a flank I am going to be homicidal. No one even saluted.<br/>
<br/>
I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no good very bad  <br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
In battle Athena liked the Egyptians&#39; sacrifice of a lamb better than  <br/>
my sacrifice of the invisible cow. At praising time she said I praised  <br/>
too quietly.  After I was done praying, she said I left out Zeus.  Who  <br/>
needs Zeus? I could tell it was going to be a terrible, horrible, no  <br/>
good very bad day.<br/>
<br/>
I could tell because Prometheus said I wasn&#39;t his best battle partner  <br/>
anymore. He said that Philip was his best battle partner and Hector  <br/>
was his next best battle partner and that I was only his third best  <br/>
battle partner.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you sit on a pike, I said to Prometheus. I hope next time you  <br/>
attack a fun-and-easily-killable blind old man your head part falls  <br/>
off your neck part and lands in Carthage.<br/>
<br/>
There were two biscuits in Philip&#39;s lunch bag and Perseus got cooked  <br/>
meat with spices and Prometheus&#39;s cook gave him a lamb&#39;s leg that had  <br/>
been broiled to perfection. Guess whose cook forgot to cook the meat?<br/>
<br/>
It was a terrible, horrible, no good very bad day.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what it was, because after battle my bodyguards took me to the  <br/>
armorer and Corba found a small hole just in mine. Come back next week  <br/>
and I&#39;ll fix it, said Corba.<br/>
<br/>
Next week, I said, I&#39;m going to Carthage.<br/>
<br/>
On the way through the forest the thick brush snapped in my face and  <br/>
while we were waiting for scouts to go get the report, Aristotle made  <br/>
me fall where it was muddy and when I started to swear because of the  <br/>
mud Demetrius said I was a Bronze-ager and while I was beating  <br/>
Demetrius for saying Bronze-ager the scouts came back with the report  <br/>
and laughed at me for being muddy and fighting.<br/>
<br/>
I am having a terrible, horrible, no good very bad day, I told  <br/>
everybody. No one even saluted.<br/>
<br/>
So then we went to a village to steal some women. Aristotle chose a  <br/>
white one with brown hair, Demetrius chose a sunburned one with blond  <br/>
hair. I wanted a freckled one with red hair, but we couldn&#39;t find one.  <br/>
There were none in the village. They made me take a plain old hag with  <br/>
green hair, but they can&#39;t make me um...well.. you know..<br/>
<br/>
When we picked up a general at his tent he said I couldn&#39;t play with  <br/>
his longbow and arrows, but I forgot. He said to watch out for the  <br/>
maps on his desk, but I was careful as could be except for my sword  <br/>
hand. He also said don&#39;t fool around with his carrier pigeon, but I  <br/>
think I sent it to Carthage. Thegeneral said please don&#39;t pick him up  <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
It was a terrible, horrible, no good very bad day.<br/>
<br/>
There was stale bread for dinner and I hate stale bread.<br/>
<br/>
There was flogging on the field and I hate flogging.<br/>
<br/>
My bath was too cold, I got blood in my eyes, my sword fell in the  <br/>
river, and I had to wear my bronze-age armor. I hate my bronze-age  <br/>
armor.<br/>
<br/>
When I went to battle Demetrius took back the flail he said I could  <br/>
keep and the Spartan Warrior (tm) wooden shield snapped apart and I  <br/>
stubbed my toe.<br/>
<br/>
The horse wants to sleep with Aristotle, not with me.<br/>
<br/>
It has been a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day.<br/>
<br/>
The general says some days are like that.<br/>
<br/>
Even in Carthage.<br/>
