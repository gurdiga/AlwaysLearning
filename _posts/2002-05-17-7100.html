&lt;&lt;  should have books on Chinese brush <br/>
 calligraphy, and there will be characters, although maybe too fancy to <br/>
follow <br/>
 in some cases. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I tried to buy a chinese brush calligraphy set at Pier 1 but they were sold <br/>
out by the time I got back there. I could try the local art store...they&#39;re <br/>
sure to have something.<br/>
And the more fancy, the better. This kid can copy anything just about. It <br/>
amazes me.<br/>
He draws fascinating detail into his dragons and spends hours copying the <br/>
Japanese symbols...it&#39;s all very bizarre and really cool.<br/>
Thanks for the ideas. I feel very lost on this topic.<br/>
