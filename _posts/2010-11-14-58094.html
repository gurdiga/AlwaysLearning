<div id="ygrps-yiv-712471280">Once upon a time we discussed putting up posters or maps, and I  <br/>
described the way I&#39;ve done it for years.  I&#39;ve just been asked again,  <br/>
but I&#39;ve also been called to a meal, and I need to go.<br/>
<br/>
I think I put it on a how-to site, too, a few years ago when it came  <br/>
up, but I can&#39;t think of where it would be.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone can help, please respond.<br/>
<br/>
Recently I&#39;ve been buying laminated maps and posters when I had the  <br/>
option, and using loops of box tape on the back to stick them to walls  <br/>
for a while.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Sorry to bother you, but I can not find what I thought I saved...a  <br/>
while back (sometime in the last year), it was either on Always  <br/>
Learning (I&#39;m pretty sure) or I saw it on your site, suggestions about  <br/>
a nice world map and you had suggested how to hang it.  I remember  <br/>
thinking how clever and that surely I wouldn&#39;t forget...well, I have.  <br/>
We&#39;re in the market for a map, so I looked in the archives, but can  <br/>
not seem to come up with anything.  If you have any of this handy and  <br/>
can shoot it my way, I&#39;d greatly appreciate it.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a shame when people have posters or art prints they can&#39;t look at  <br/>
without frames, and frames are expensive, so help with this would be  <br/>
help with unschooling for very many families!<br/>

Re: [AlwaysLearning] C-Span&#39;s Presidents Timeline poster<br/>
<br/>
Apologies to those outside the U.S., but we had the old poster and had<br/>
it up and down and up again six or eight times.<br/>
<br/>
We got the new one last week, and I put it up the next morning. One<br/>
of the first things Holly said when she came in the house, before she<br/>
was even up the stairs all the way, was &quot;We got a new presidents&#39;<br/>
chart?!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/house/kdk_2752.jpg">http://i26.photobucket.com/albums/c111/SandraDodd/house/kdk_2752.jpg</a><br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s how I put maps and charts up and take them down and get them<br/>
back up again:<br/>
Box tape. Good, clear 3M 2&quot; wide box tape.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On the back of the chart, on each corner and in the middle, put two<br/>
strips of box tape, about 8&quot; long (for this size of poster), so<br/>
there&#39;s a big reinforced place. That&#39;s like lamination, but you can&#39;t<br/>
laminate the whole thing.<br/>
<br/>
You might need two in the middle on the top; depends on your wall.<br/>
<br/>
Then on those, put loops of box tape, like 15&quot; (more or less&quot; put into<br/>
an inside-out loop so both sides are sticky. Put that on the tape<br/>
you&#39;ve already put on the back. Then stick it to the wall. You can<br/>
readjust those; you can take it down when you&#39;re tired of it, take<br/>
those loops off and throw them away, and the place where the loops<br/>
were should be as good as new. No holes in the poster, no torn paper.<br/>
<br/>
On this one, I put three loops of tape in each corner, different<br/>
directions, so gravity can&#39;t make them all loose.<br/>
<br/>
I have maps and posters that are over 20 years old, still re-useable,<br/>
because there are good tape-pads on back for new tape loops.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t use cheap tape. Don&#39;t use anything like masking tape (too<br/>
wimpy) or duct tape (it will mess up the poster and the wall). Not<br/>
strapping tape. Just this stuff:<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-231428557">Thank you Sandra and Joyce...this was just what I was thinking of.  I thought that there was talk of a world map as well, but it was just  the presidents.<br/>
<br/>
Can anyone suggest a world map for the wall that they like very much?  I&#39;ve been looking on Amazon, but it&#39;s hard to tell.  My dd is three and loves the states, so I want them to be clear, but she&#39;s now moving to African countries and French departments and the Asian continent (ipod games introducing the world to her!).  We recently got a globe, but the borders between the US states aren&#39;t that clear and it&#39;s a bit small overall, so I want something nice and big for the wall.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any suggestions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-303826553">We bought large, already laminated, maps of the world and the USA (36x24) from a school specialty catalog to hang on the wall.  They actually hang on two different walls.<br/>
<br/>
With the USA map each state is a different color and with the world map each country is a different color.<br/>
<br/>
On the world map it says houseofdoolittle.com  - that is not the catalog I purchased it from but that is the info on the map.<br/>
it also says reorder number HOD711    We&#39;ve had it a few years so that number may no longer be relevant.<br/>
<br/>
We used map pins to hang it - one in each corner - and it has never fallen - when we remove map pins from the wall the holes are so tiny you don&#39;t see them.<br/>

Get two maps.  One political of the U.S. (states clearly marked) and  <br/>
one of the world that shows the U.S. as one country.  It&#39;s not fair/ <br/>
right/honest to show clearly-marked states on a map of the world  <br/>
unless it also shows provinces, states, regions of other countries.   <br/>
It gives a skewed view of how the world is divided, politically/ <br/>
financially/legally.<br/>

We are living in the USA for a year with my husbands work, so have been trying to do as much sightseeing as possible ... when we were in San Francisco I picked up a couple of maps by &#39;Unique Media&#39; at a tourist shop ... I just got the California one (where we are living), and a USA one, I don&#39;t know if they do world ones too ... oh, here is a web addy with them: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.wall-maps.com/UniqueMedia.htm">http://www.wall-maps.com/UniqueMedia.htm</a>    ...it looks like they do world ones...<br/>
<br/>
They are a hand-drawn, 3D style - they call them hand-drawn landscape graphics ... couldn&#39;t use them to navigate I don&#39;t think, but, shows points of interest in a different way ...<br/>
