My husband, Keith, just sent this link to me.<br/>
<br/>
Americans get a little gaga about British TV, but I have to say that  <br/>
some of the websites from the U.K. are truly wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
This is a timeline you can set for all of Britain or just England,  <br/>
Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland (in later years).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to add it to my history page.  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/history">http://sandradodd.com/history</a><br/>

<br/>
If people here have other favorite history sites not already there  <br/>
that are fun and different, please share them here!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-490566600">Ooh, I like that.  This one has a similar format - I particularly liked the<br/>
&quot;History of Religion&quot; one.<br/>
