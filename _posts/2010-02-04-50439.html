<div id="ygrps-yiv-1175834039">I have a request for a topic about frustration with mothers.  I&#39;m  <br/>
about to go to sleep, though, so I hoped people here could make  <br/>
suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I wrote for starters, to the person with the concerns.<br/>
=============<br/>
If there was any alcohol or drug use involved, al-anon could be  <br/>
wonderfully helpful.  Even if not, if there was any kind of  <br/>
dysfunction, there&#39;s a little book you could probably find easily  <br/>
called &quot;Daily Affirmations,&quot; and it covers Lots of the the issues  <br/>
frustrated kids (adult children from frustrating families&lt;G&gt;) deal with.<br/>
<br/>
Used, from a penny (plus shipping)--you might find it in a used book  <br/>
store near you, though, or just buy one new.  It&#39;s worth it.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Daily-Affirmations-Adult-Children-Alcoholics/dp/0932194273/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1265260852&sr=8-1">http://www.amazon.com/Daily-Affirmations-Adult-Children-Alcoholics/dp/0932194273/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1265260852&sr=8-1</a><br/>
<br/>
I have a good page in the Big Book about healing, but it was original  <br/>
writing.  Maybe tomorrow I&#39;ll pull it out of the word file and put it  <br/>
on the list.  But if you have that book, there are quite a few  <br/>
sections that could help.<br/>

<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/service">http://sandradodd.com/service</a><br/>
================<br/>
<br/>
A couple of bits from the question I hope people can riff upon:<br/>
<br/>
-=- I&#39;ve read other unschoolers speak about, sort of healing how they  <br/>
were parented by parenting.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-I don&#39;t really want to do one thing the same as she did.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would like to read about the healing of oneself aspect through  <br/>
parenting your own child and getting through holding on to stuff with  <br/>
one&#39;s own parent, I guess.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I have two other suggestions, a link and a concept.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/balance">http://sandradodd.com/balance</a><br/>
and<br/>
&quot;detachment,&quot; as used in AA and al-anon.<br/>
<br/>
Good night; see ya&#39;ll in the morning.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1578626719">I was wanting to ask a question on this topic ­ I¹ve been formulating it in<br/>
my head for ages but cant get it right!  I keep wondering how people have<br/>
healed their own childhoods and how do you know when you have healed?  I¹ve<br/>
been to counselling in the past and am very aware of the ways in which I do<br/>
not want to repeat my mothers parenting but how do you actually heal old<br/>
hurts and how do you know when they are healed?<br/>
<br/>
I get confused cos my mum is still a source of frustration and anger in my<br/>
life ­ she accuses me of holding onto anger from my childhood sometimes, but<br/>
I am usually angry/annoyed at her for stuff she is doing right now ­ if I<br/>
think about stuff from the past it does piss me off, although I can sigh and<br/>
know she just did what she thought was right with the info and resources she<br/>
had at the time, but she continually impresses upon me how I parent totally<br/>
wrong, how my kids are gonna be beating me up by the time they are teens etc<br/>
etc (it goes on and on) she¹s just kinda unpleasable.   And when she harps<br/>
on about my parenting it does make me feel like telling her that when she<br/>
becomes the perfect mother she can come and give me lectures then but until<br/>
then just STOP!!!!  Of course I don¹t say this cos it would seem cruel ­ I<br/>
just try and um and ar as she lectures just to keep the peace ­ when I<br/>
challenge her she starts shouting and accusing and I end up feeling like it<br/>
really is all my fault and I am insane and need to go see a psychiatrist of<br/>
something ­ last time she was shouting so loud she woke the baby up, so<br/>
mainly I just try to gloss over things with her.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway ­ I might have waffled on there too much ­ will be interested to see<br/>
the responses on this topic ­ thanks!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-383947378"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;I keep wondering how people have healed their own childhoods and how do you know when you have healed? I¹ve been to counselling in the past and am very aware of the ways in which I do not want to repeat my mothers parenting but how do you actually heal old hurts and how do you know when they are healed?&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>For me, I had to acknowledge my childhood for what it was rather than trying to make it better or worse in my head. It is in the past and there is nothing that I can do to change it. I had to realize that there was no sense in beating myself up over something that I had no control over. I was a kid. It is the adult&#39;s responsibility to take care of the kids rather than the other way around. Trying to assign blame and untangle all of the emotions was killing me inside. Perhaps that is oversimplified but it boils down to acknowledging it and moving on. I feel like I will never be completely healed because those pains are still very much there but I have chosen to not let them control me. I have been working hard to become indifferent towards the pain in my childhood because I will never be happy about it and being mad about it wasn&#39;t helping either. I think I will be healed when I can be indifferent about it all the time. That hasn&#39;t happened so there is still a lot of work to do. I constantly remind myself to be careful about what I hate and to be careful about getting to knotted up over it. If I want to be different, I have to look at my childhood objectively and see it for the good and the bad. The more knotted up I was, the harder it was for me to be the parent that I wanted to be. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I get confused cos my mum is still a source of frustration and anger in my life &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I felt that way too until I realized that it was a matter of choice. I can have my mother in my life and be frustrated and angry or I can cut her out. I didn&#39;t like either of those choices so I tried to figure out a way to still have her in my life without getting so frustrated and angry. I had to apply some of the unschooling principles that I had learned and read about to my relationship with my mother. I had to accept her for who she is rather than continually getting frustrated and angry because of who she isn&#39;t. She has been the same person since I was a kid. There has been very little variation over the years. Why would she suddenly change? <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt;&gt;&gt;she accuses me of holding onto anger from my childhood sometimes&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Is there a chance that she is right? I know I wasn&#39;t able to move away from the current anger until I let go of the past anger. I think I kept holding on to that anger because it was what I knew. If I let that anger go, then I wouldn&#39;t have an excuse to be mad at the world or my mom or anyone else. I was using the anger from my childhood as a crutch. The hardest thing for me to admit was that I was still getting something out of it. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;I am usually angry/annoyed at her for stuff she is doing right now&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Then don&#39;t talk to her right now. When I find myself getting annoyed with everything that my mother says and does, I know it is time for me to take a break from my mom. If she calls, I don&#39;t answer the phone or tell her I am busy. I am an adult and I don&#39;t need people in my life that routinely annoy me and make me angry. When I am annoyed and angry, I find myself not doing better. I find myself slipping back into the patterns that I was raised with. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;but she continually impresses upon me how I parent totally<br/>
 </span></blockquote>wrong&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
I had to set boundaries with my mother and my mother in law. If they want to question what I am doing because they genuinely want to understand my perspective, that is fine. If they want to tell me that what I am doing is wrong, I shut the conversation down. It took me quite a while to figure out how to do that. I would always feel so guilty afterward. Then, I realized that I deserved better and the only way that I was going to get that was to stand up for myself. I spent my life hoping that my mom would stand up for me and protect me but she never did. From her perspective, she did. From my perspective, her standing up and protecting me were a complete joke. If I wanted somebody to stand up for me, I had to do it for myself. I had to find power within myself. Nobody else could give that to me. It is something that I had to find within myself. It&#39;s really weird because once I find my own personal power I was able to let go of a lot of controlling behavior. So, when my mom starts lecturing me or control me in subtle ways, I remind myself that she has no personal power and is trying to find it by controlling people and things around her. <br/>
<br/>
I realized that I didn&#39;t care whether or not my mother (or mother in law) liked my parenting style. I had to ask myself, &quot;Why is her opinion so important?&quot; If she was a stranger on the street, I wouldn&#39;t think much about it. Since it is my mother, I felt like I needed her approval. I had an epiphany one day and realized that my need to have her approve of me comes from growing up with an external locus of control. I spent my entire life hearing that we should look to our elders for approval because they are supposed to have all the answers and know more. Moving from an external focus to an internal one doesn&#39;t happen overnight. It is not easy to overcome a lifetime of messages that reinforce the adult centered paradigm. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;And when she harps on about my parenting it does make me feel like telling her that when she<br/>

mainly I just try to gloss over things with her.&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
Do you live with your mother? The only time I ever listen to my mom to keep the peace is when I am physically at her house. If she does that stuff to me at her house, I leave. Why challenge her if you already know what the outcome is going to be? I learned to walk away and disengage. Every now and then I feel a little argumentative and actually engage but those times are finally starting to decrease. I knew what I needed to but just could not seem to do it successfully because I was at least getting some attention from her when she was giving me a lecture or going on about my siblings or somebody else that she currently hates. I don&#39;t want my kids to see that kind of crap. It used to infuriate me when my mother would start complaining about another family member when the kids were around. I finally had to tell her that it was not acceptable. I refuse to deliberately subject my kids to that crap. She finally figured out that I was serious because I would cut her off the minute she would start in on me. I would tell her, &quot;I don&#39;t want to hear it.&quot; In the beginning, she would persist but then realized that I meant business because I would leave, get off the phone, or find another way to get the hell out of that situation. In the beginning when I was trying to figure out how to disengage, I would literally hang up on her. I had tried to be understanding and forgiving but I think ultimately she just wanted me to agree with her and tell her that I thought she was the best mom in the world. I think my mom and my mother in law both felt that my parenting choices were a rejection of them. They took our choices too personally and felt like my husband and I had personally rejected them by doing something so very different. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-241580832">I am 51 years old and my whole parenting experience has been defending what I am doing.  It created a stressful time with family and even strangers in a grocery store since I had a baby and usually 3 in tow.  &quot;Why are they not in school&quot;, &quot;Why don&#39;t you work?&quot;  &quot;Go get a pedicure look at those hands&quot;.  &quot;Rice milk, those kids need real milk&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Traveling and seeing all sorts of different families, cultures, etc., I realized that most of the things I dealt with were just a result of opinions of me.  I grew up in a very opinionated family!  I grew up in a very opinionated nation.  I am very opinionated! ha!  So I really cared what people believed about me or felt about me.....and I know now it is part of human nature, it&#39;s not a result of how we were raised or where we were born.  We all have the same need to be recognized and accepted!  We were given a choice as well to believe what others believe about us, some of it is true, some of it is not, and what we believe about ourselves.  Both are a healthy balance that helps us heal.<br/>
<br/>
 When I started having children and learned about the wonderful world of attachment parenting, homeschooling, etc....I was just doing everything not the normal way.....so it made everyone insecure and frustrated or at least that is how I defined them.  I didn&#39;t always fit into the homeschool groups either, and I probably don&#39;t fit into this group either ha! ha! just kidding.  It doesn&#39;t matter if I fit in.  None of us should fit into any group.  Otherwise we are just fitting in. ha!  Be the wonderful, unique different individual you were created to be.  Spend your whole life being excited about finding out how to be this wonderful person growing inside of you!<br/>
<br/>
I wished I had forsight to see that most of the people including my family really were just trying to figure out how to relate to me since I was always trying to control the environment that I was raising my children in.... I was very defensive and proactive in the sense I had all my bows and arrows ready when they attacked my lifestyle.  Now I see it, then, I was over confident, but also very insecure which kept me from just being myself in someways.  I was responding to everything from &quot;if you want to feed your grandaughter....just make the oatmeal with honey instead of the condensed milk and sugar you so want to give.&quot; ha! ha!  Where now I see my Mom just wanted to express herself as well.  If I just would have let her feed my daughter the way she wanted.  It wouldn&#39;t have killed her here and there! But it did damage our relationship. (my Mom and I)  Especially now the baby I was so concerned about is creating wonderful gourmet<br/>
 meals(which I am very proud of her), but they aren&#39;t all vegetarian or vegan or healthy(in my mind ha! ha!) <br/>
<br/>
Healing has been a long process.  Embracing the bad things in my life have made me who I am today, and I can&#39;t believe i am saying it but each day I am saying it with confidence that I am glad for all the things that have happened and I have definately not had horrible things happen to me, so I am sure those take even longer.<br/>
<br/>
Opportunities then are what I look for now......opportunities to undo some of the things I have become(some of the bad attitudes, angry, etc.) , that is the healing, not out of guilt that I am working on things,  but out of pleasure to retain who I was and who I am. I am talking giving back to the community, my family when I am around them.   My Mom is in a home now, after many years of caring for her with my siblings...each time taking care of her crying as I would bathe her, wipe her bottom, not crying because I had to do it but crying that I wished I would have accepted her more.  She truly was doing the best she could, even though in the process made me feel I wasn&#39;t good enough.  I learned as she became sick that she was abused as a child and didn&#39;t ever recover from that and some other horrible experiences in her life.  How she treated me was a reflection of that.  That I feel very sad for, but it is not my responsiblity to carry the<br/>
 responsibility for her healing, just mine.  Each day I am able to let go of that negative voice of hers that was really a hurting child within, and that was her way of dealing with the pain.  So when I hear my own, since I learned many of her ways, I recognize it is that hurting child within me, but I am dealing with my pain.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1506666664">-=-   My Mom is in a home now, after many years of caring for her with  <br/>
my siblings...each time taking care of her crying as I would bathe  <br/>
her, wipe her bottom, not crying because I had to do it but crying  <br/>
that I wished I would have accepted her more.  She truly was doing the  <br/>
best she could, even though in the process made me feel I wasn&#39;t good  <br/>
enough.  I learned as she became sick that she was abused as a child  <br/>

in her life.  How she treated me was a reflection of that.  That I  <br/>
feel very sad for, but it is not my responsiblity to carry the<br/>
responsibility for her healing, just mine.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes, that kind of compassion for the harms inflicted on our mothers  <br/>
can be helpful.  I wiped my mom&#39;s butt, and she ended up dying in her  <br/>
own apartment, having lied to me and lied to her best friend  <br/>
(conflicting lies, to keep each of us only knowing half of what was  <br/>
going on).    I didn&#39;t cry at all.   But I was also, at that point, I  <br/>
was already fifteen years or so into making up for the damage she had  <br/>
done by parenting my own children in ways I would like to have been  <br/>
parented, and it was serving to heal my own soul and memories as well.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It doesn&#39;t matter if I fit in.  None of us should fit into any  <br/>
group.  Otherwise we are just fitting in. ha! -=-<br/>
<br/>
In this list it will matter.  If you don&#39;t fit in I&#39;ll throw you out.   <br/>
But &quot;fit in&quot; doesn&#39;t mean agree with everything everyone says, it  <br/>
means focus on helping clarify what will help others understand  <br/>
unschooling better.<br/>
<br/>
All of us on this list should fit in with the purpose of the list or  <br/>
go to other lists.    I can say that, because I own the list and have  <br/>
a lot of years invested in it.  As other lists around me have appeared  <br/>
and dissolved, this one is still good and strong.  It&#39;s not an accident!<br/>

<br/>
You could put it in writing maybe, instead of the heat of the moment.  Tell her not to harp and lecture and until she can find a way to communicate without doing that, then she should just stop.<br/>
<br/>
***last time she was shouting so loud she woke the baby up, so<br/>
mainly I just try to gloss over things with her.***<br/>
<br/>
Tell her she&#39;s not allowed to do that in your house.  My daughter&#39;s boyfriend&#39;s dad is a jerk most of the time.  Out of all of his jerkness, that is the one part that is the worst for his son, it does the most damage and creates nothing but animosity.  If you&#39;ve chosen to not have shouting in your house, don&#39;t let people shout in it.<br/>
<br/>
If your mom does that everytime she comes over, don&#39;t invite her over.  If she wonders why she&#39;s not being invited tell her that she can come over if she can find a way to talk without shouting.  Maybe tell her that if she can come over and play nice long enough for you to save on therapy bills, then you&#39;ll use that extra money to take her out to dinner at a fancy restaurant.<br/>

<br/>
THIS right here is why I parent my teen differently than more traditional parents.  I don&#39;t ever want my kids to go through this, ever!  I see this all around me, it is the standard way in which parents treat and behave towards teenagers.  Teens come into their own minds and bodies, have their own ideas and perceptions of the world.  Kids do too, but the awareness changes.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly parents who once had little kids they could easily manipulate and control, who they had great power over, have kids that want to manipulate and control their own worlds, they want their own power.  From that point onward, it seems, it is a power struggle that someone will lose.  People are meant to find themselves and the power within themselves, it&#39;s a huge part of puberty.<br/>
<br/>
Our culture, in general, does a huge amount of damage to young people this way, controlling, manipulating, and infantilizing them.  What I want as a parent, and what my children want, shouldn&#39;t be at odds with each other.  Parents should exist to give their children a lift up to see the from a better place.  If I&#39;m controlling, manipulating, and infantilizing my almost grown child, I can&#39;t really lift her up, nor would she let me, I would be an obstacle for  her.  This gets played out in all kinds of households and schools help by keeping powerful young minds at bay, when they really want to just get out and sail the world.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219278784">Jenny&#39;s whole post was great, but this gives me an idea:<br/>
<br/>
-=- From that point onward, it seems, it is a power struggle that  <br/>
someone will lose. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is antagonism, and most relationships are based on win/lose  <br/>
antagonism.<br/>
My relationship with my kids, thanks to advice given to me by La Leche  <br/>
League leaders (Carol Rice, particularly and most memorably, whose  <br/>
birthday party I&#39;m going to tonight) is partners, not adversaries.   <br/>
When I didn&#39;t know whether Kirby would be an only child or not, I  <br/>
decided to be his partner, and I have tried to be as good a partner as  <br/>
I could be.  When Kirby wins, we both win.<br/>
<br/>
If a parent long ago set up a win/lose situation and a child lost for  <br/>
eighteen years, or twenty years, and that &quot;child&quot; now has a child, I  <br/>
don&#39;t think it would be sinful or awful if there was some way to make  <br/>
that point, that it was the mother&#39;s idea to set up a situation in  <br/>
which only one could win, but that once there is a new generation, the  <br/>
mother needs to stop &quot;being the winner.&quot;  She could have stopped that  <br/>
years before, but she could start now, if she wants to.<br/>

seems to begin when a parent decides that the kid winning isn&#39;t a win  <br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not about partnership, then. It&#39;s about compromise, instead  <br/>
ie.&quot;they must give up something because I&#39;m giving up something.&quot; I  <br/>
don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good basis for a relationship, though I guess it  <br/>
could be the least of the evils of mainstream parenting.<br/>

I think that&#39;s the problem with &quot;consensual living,&quot; too, in which it  <br/>
is always possible for someone to be losing.  There is &quot;the  <br/>
consensus,&quot; the fragile, occasional team (it seems to be) and the  <br/>
moving-toward-consensus (where if people aren&#39;t careful, someone&#39;s  <br/>
going to be losing any second now...)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1303319400">This is from the Big Book, in the section on deschooling.  It&#39;s my  <br/>
writing, to the end (pages 16-17)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Plain old Fear:  Some of the fears people have felt and reported are  <br/>
fear of &quot;the truant officer,&quot; the principal, the police, social  <br/>
services, the neighbors, their own parents and other relatives.    <br/>
Another set of fears are that the children will never leave home, that  <br/>
they will never get a job, that they couldn�t get into college if they  <br/>
wanted to.  The way to overcome the first set is to be circumspect and  <br/>
polite and helpful.  Stay out of trouble.  The way to deal with the  <br/>
second set is to meet some unschoolers, or at least find a place where  <br/>
you can read about them as they&#39;re growing up, those who are older  <br/>
than your own children.  If possible, find locals to hang out with, or  <br/>
attend a conference or two.<br/>
<br/>
New unschoolers are often afraid.  If you feel fear, that&#39;s natural.   <br/>
If you&#39;ve taken a child out of school, there is still a school there  <br/>
you could put him back into, so if your fear is that it&#39;s a once and  <br/>
forever decision, it&#39;s not.  Schools are right there, still.<br/>
<br/>
If you feel that you&#39;re turning your back on your entire culture, take  <br/>
a deep breath and note that when you turn your back on school, all  <br/>
that&#39;s behind you is a school.  What&#39;s not school is infinite.  What  <br/>
is school is small.<br/>
<br/>
Fear of rejection by all your relatives can be frightening.  Think of  <br/>
worst case scenarios.  If these people have been controlling you with  <br/>
threats and shame for twenty or thirty years, do you owe them another  <br/>
thirty years?<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been accused of encouraging parents to separate children from  <br/>
their grandparents.  I know why some grandparents would have said  <br/>
that.  And the tone with which I was approached was very familiar to  <br/>
me, too.  It was along the lines of &quot;Who do you think you are, little  <br/>
missy?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah.  It wasn&#39;t even my mom, mother-in-law or grandmother!  But it  <br/>
was someone&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want children separated from their parents or grandparents.  I  <br/>
want the parents and grandparents to be kind and generous to the  <br/>
children.  I want parents to be kind and gentle with their children  <br/>
even if the children are 25 or 45 years old.  I&#39;m old enough now that  <br/>
any parent of any age who wants to explain to me how it is in the real  <br/>
world can back down and hush.  I&#39;m not theorizing and I&#39;m not being  <br/>
reactionary.  I&#39;m making conscious choices and helping others see the  <br/>
possibility of doing so as well, for the sake of their relationships  <br/>
with their children and partners, friends and parents.  Choices,  <br/>
though; not just choosing to continue to be told what to do.<br/>
<br/>
School has become so much a part of life in the past few decades that  <br/>
it seems to some that taking their children out of school is like  <br/>
leaving the planet altogether.  You will be relieved, then, to  <br/>
discover that school takes kids out of the world but unschooling gives  <br/>
it back.  I know it can sound wrong and crazy.  Keep reading.  Keep  <br/>
watching your kids.  Listen to your memories of childhood.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-260124833">&quot;but how do you actually heal old<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; hurts and how do you know when they are healed?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You will know they are healed when you feel a sense of choice in regards to your mother.  You have no choice right now but to play out the same mother-child relationship you&#39;ve always played out.  You are the peace-keeper.  You, as an adult, have choices, but you have to claim them.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; <br/>
&gt; &quot;I get confused cos my mum is still a source of frustration and anger in my<br/>
&gt; life ­ she accuses me of holding onto anger from my childhood sometimes, but<br/>
&gt; I am usually angry/annoyed at her for stuff she is doing right now&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Her suggestion that you are holding onto stuff from the past is a smokescreen.  She has likely figured out, probably intuitively, that she can stump you if she plays that card.  In other words, she gets you thinking about how there is something wrong with you and then you allow her to be mean to you in the present.<br/>
<br/>
When I was in my late teens and early 20&#39;s my mother would play the &quot;you&#39;re selfish&quot; card if she felt less powerful.  It would always cause me to back off and do what she wanted.  Then I figured out it was a game, in the sense that it was about manipulation--not a genuine, unbiased assessment that I was actually selfish.  In fact, I was far from it.  I stopped reacting to it, and lo and behold she maybe tried it twice after that and never said it again.  <br/>
<br/>
­ &quot;if I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; think about stuff from the past it does piss me off, although I can sigh and<br/>
&gt; know she just did what she thought was right with the info and resources she<br/>
&gt; had at the time, but she continually impresses upon me how I parent totally<br/>
&gt; wrong,&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why would you allow that kind of conversation?  (Don&#39;t answer, just ask yourself.  It&#39;s a clue that something&#39;s not &quot;right&quot;)  If I came to your door, befriended you, and then criticized your parenting, I&#39;ll bet you&#39;d know what to say to me.  You need some boundaries!  <br/>
<br/>
But then she&#39;ll likely play the &quot;you&#39;re a bad daughter for being disrespectful&quot; card.  But you can see it coming.<br/>
<br/>
 &quot;And when she harps<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on about my parenting&quot; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Just smile and change the subject.  Literally.  Ask her if she&#39;s going to see The Lightning Thief when it opens--if she&#39;d like to go with the kids.  Make it obvious that you don&#39;t want to talk about that.  There is no law saying that your companion gets to talk about whatever they want whether you like it or not.  Even if it&#39;s your mother.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;it does make me feel like telling her that when she<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; becomes the perfect mother she can come and give me lectures then but until<br/>
&gt; then just STOP!!!!  Of course I don¹t say this cos it would seem cruel&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There are choices that aren&#39;t either cruel OR &quot;keeping the peace.&quot;  Of course, it will mean a shift in the fundamental relationship, and that&#39;s the reason that many adult children will NOT take this step in healing.  Healing means change, and change feels scary. That&#39;s why we don&#39;t do it more often.  You need to be able to LET the relationship change--and it won&#39;t feel the same, but if your mother wants to have one with you, she&#39;ll start meeting you half way, instead of insisting it be on her terms.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
You have been the peace-keeper for someone who doesn&#39;t have control over her own emotions.  But you don&#39;t need to continue that role.  But you also can&#39;t wait for your mother to change things.  She won&#39;t change without YOU making the first move.  You&#39;ve been waiting for HER to grow up--expecting her to be the adult, the parent.  But now you are a parent and you can claim the right to peace for yourself.<br/>
<br/>
­ &quot;I just try and um and ar as she lectures just to keep the peace ­ when I<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; challenge her she starts shouting and accusing and I end up feeling like it<br/>
&gt; really is all my fault and I am insane and need to go see a psychiatrist of<br/>
&gt; something ­ last time she was shouting so loud she woke the baby up, so<br/>
&gt; mainly I just try to gloss over things with her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ask her calmly, politely and kindly to leave, since this is too disruptive for the children.  Promise to continue the conversation later when you are &quot;both more calm.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
I like to think, when I&#39;m having trouble with something, &quot;What would this feel like/look like if it were healthy?&quot;  In a healthy relationship there is more consideration, more give and take.  You&#39;ll have to reclaim, in as graceful a way as you can manage, your lost space.  This may ruffle some feathers, but there&#39;s a difference between being agressive vs. being assertive.  They may both ruffle feathers at first, but assertiveness will allow for your mom to have wiggle room later.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393655756">On the question of how people heal, I&#39;ve brought something else from  <br/>
the big book of unschooling.  Page 271:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Healing<br/>
<br/>
Just as the adult a child will be already lives in him, so the child  <br/>
you were still lives in you as an adult.  If you have memories of  <br/>
childhood, examine them objectively sometimes when you&#39;re considering  <br/>
how to be with your own children.<br/>
<br/>
There might be things from your past that you would do just as your  <br/>
parents did, and by doing that you would honor the happiness you  <br/>
remember from childhood.  That&#39;s a way to show gratitude to your  <br/>
parents even if they&#39;re not living anymore.<br/>
<br/>
There might be things you remember that you would not want to pass on  <br/>
to your children.  For me, being put to bed alone in a dark room is  <br/>
not something healing for me or for my children.  When I let them have  <br/>
a light, or let them sleep with me and their dad or wherever they want  <br/>
to, I imagine peacefully how nice that would have been for me, as a  <br/>
child, and that soothes and heals my soul.  I still have the memories,  <br/>
but they&#39;re not as scary.  They don&#39;t trigger resentment now, but  <br/>
nicer emotions, because now they&#39;re about my own children.<br/>
<br/>
The list of things that marred your childhood can be your checklist of  <br/>
things to avoid or change or undo.  The things that brought joy to you  <br/>
as a child can be things for you to do for and with your children,  <br/>
too, if you can.<br/>
<br/>
Knowing some of my husband&#39;s childhood hurts helped too.  Those also  <br/>
went on the &quot;don&#39;t do this&quot; list in my heart.  Sometimes I was able to  <br/>
find little ways to see and comfort the little boy still living in  <br/>
that big strong man who works so hard to take care of us.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the most healing thing of all was feeling that I was being a  <br/>
good mother.  That didn&#39;t happen because of unschooling, it happened  <br/>
because of breastfeeding my first baby.  I was doing something  <br/>
profoundly right, and it was deeply bonding for us.  I had nursed the  <br/>
second baby and was pregnant with the third when we started  <br/>
unschooling.  It seemed the logical extension of the attachment  <br/>
parenting that had made me feel so confident as a parent, and so good  <br/>
about myself from that present day back to my earliest memories.<br/>
<br/>
When I soothe my child, I soothe myself.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1709274262">Thank you all for this thread. I just had an epiphany in the last few days that my anger is no longer serving me -- I think it was a way of coping through my difficult childhood and young adult times, but it is keeping me from being fully the parent I want to be for my kids. So I am going to let it go.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1255535514">I just found this in my drafts folder.  I don&#39;t know why I didn&#39;t mail  <br/>
it.<br/>
Because of recent discussions in the chat and on facebook, though, I&#39;m  <br/>
going to mail it now.  It doesn&#39;t matter anymore (didn&#39;t even then)  <br/>
who wrote the original or who the quotes are.   It&#39;s about the ideas  <br/>
and the principles.<br/>
--------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
-=-but she continually impresses upon me how I parent totally<br/>
wrong, how my kids are gonna be beating me up by the time they are  <br/>
teens etc-=-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m going to pull a technicality on your language.    She continually  <br/>
something, but does she &quot;impress&quot; it upon you?  Is she making the  <br/>
sound, or is it having an effect on you?<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about boundaries.  Maybe she should stop talking, but even if  <br/>
she talks incessantly for the next ten years, is it possible that you  <br/>
can hear it as noise that doesn&#39;t really &quot;impress upon&quot; you?  Are you  <br/>
stronger than her intentions?<br/>
<br/>
Some people are still very  affected by their parents&#39; opinions.  Some  <br/>
stopped being so affected way before they were adults.  Some parental  <br/>
complaints are fear-based and whiney.  Some are bullying, and  <br/>
overbearing.<br/>
<br/>
-=- And when she harps<br/>
on about my parenting it does make me feel like telling her that when  <br/>
she<br/>
becomes the perfect mother she can come and give me lectures then but  <br/>

psychiatrist of<br/>
something  last time she was shouting so loud she woke the baby up, so<br/>
mainly I just try to gloss over things with her.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Does she live with you?  If she was visiting and shouted loud enough  <br/>
to wake the baby up, that&#39;s really bad.<br/>
If she lives there, it&#39;s bad but still her house (perhaps).   Those  <br/>
factors make a difference in the options.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1691365068">I&#39;m responding to myself, to that  post I found from February.<br/>
<br/>
And maybe the reason I pulled it was because I had a friend who told  <br/>
me Kirby was going to hit me when he was grown because I didn&#39;t hit  <br/>
him when he was little (five, at the time of the threat/curse).  Six  <br/>
or eight years ago, I would have told you that her son DID grow up to  <br/>
hit her (even though, or perhaps *because*, she hit him) but six or  <br/>
eight months ago, I would have told you that now her son is dead.   <br/>
Overdose, either on purpose or accidental or inflicted by someone  <br/>
else.  Found dead on a street downtown, in mid December 2009.  He was  <br/>
about Marty&#39;s age.<br/>
<br/>
I have another thing to say about &quot;on a street downtown.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If Jefferson (because that was his name; Jeff short for Jefferson) had  <br/>
felt more comfortable being at home, than being downtown using hard  <br/>
drugs in the winter, he might be alive, but he didn&#39;t choose to be  <br/>
around his mother, as a young man.<br/>
<br/>
If Jefferson had been home playing video games (no matter how  <br/>
&quot;violent&quot; they might have been called by wagging-fingered mothers who  <br/>
liked to control their boys), he would have been home, near food and a  <br/>
toilet; near a phone and a bed; in a house that could be locked.  He  <br/>
would have been safer at home playing video games than whatever he was  <br/>
doing downtown with drugs.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t listen to what people are saying if their own children aren&#39;t  <br/>
extremely happy and well-adjusted.<br/>
If the person who&#39;s talking to you is your own mother, if you have  <br/>
resentments and sorrows from childhood that are still hurting you,  <br/>
think twice before letting her tell you to treat your children as she  <br/>
treated you.<br/>
<br/>
But more than all of that, don&#39;t live in the future or in the past.   <br/>
Live today.  If today is comfortable and loving and good, it will make  <br/>
it easier to make tomorrow that way.  After some hundreds or thousands  <br/>
of comfortable, loving, good days, it makes it easier for the days and  <br/>
years after that to be better.<br/>

It all came down to trust.  Simply put, my mother didn&#39;t trust me and I was a <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1193037924">Same here. My folks had four daughters who all did as they were told,<br/>
for the most part, even me and I was the most obstinate. Yet I did<br/>
(reluctantly) clean and do chores they said they expected me to do, I<br/>
didn&#39;t go out and party up like crazy (or at all!) as really that<br/>
choice wasn&#39;t available to me way out on a mini-farm in the rural<br/>
countryside, and when I left home.. same thing. I still followed a lot<br/>
of their rules for a long while anyway when I could have gone wild<br/>
(and a lot of people do ... something that can be riskily done or more<br/>
safely done). But still my folks were and still are very suspicious<br/>
and don&#39;t talk much except in warnings and all sorts of (silly seeming<br/>
to me) predictions of doom. I haven&#39;t gone back to live with them.<br/>
That&#39;s for sure. Not much trust either way. I had friends I could<br/>
trust though and that helped me out in many a pinch.<br/>
<br/>
When I was still living in their home, the mother of one of my<br/>
sister&#39;s friends said there was no WAY any of my parent&#39;s children<br/>
would ever EVer disgrace their parents. And it&#39;s true. None of us have<br/>
disgraced our parents (disgrace is my father&#39;s word there). :)<br/>
<br/>
Proving your parents wrong by living by your own choices is hardly<br/>
disgraceful. It may not be in total complete agreement. But there&#39;s no<br/>
disgrace in living by your own lights, as they say. I see it as a<br/>
positive good. :)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra and Jenny that it isn&#39;t safe to insist on<br/>
controlling, distrustful and potentially destructive interactions with<br/>
one&#39;s children. My parents were lucky in most respects, and I&#39;m glad<br/>
they didn&#39;t get so &quot;into&quot; with any of us that we were permanently<br/>
estranged. We have all needed them later in life at one time or<br/>
another and they have been there for us as much as they were able to.<br/>
They lean very heavily on the religion idea but I just forgive them<br/>
for it and overlook it now that I&#39;m 45 and not so under their thumb.<br/>
;)<br/>

My sister & I reunited after 20 years of not speaking. Not because we had a problem but the people & lies we grew up around pushed both of us away so far that she & I lost contact, sad. But the good news is we reconnected last year and it&#39;s been really great overall. <br/>

<br/>
When Kirby and Marty were tiny and Holly wasn&#39;t born, we hung out with  <br/>
a La Leche League crowd, mostly leaders (though I wasn&#39;t a leader) and  <br/>
saw various of them several times a week, in different combinations,  <br/>
because of a weekly park day and a babysitting co-op where kids  <br/>
visited and stayed and did projects for points the parents kept on a  <br/>
chart.<br/>
<br/>
Two of those families were unschooling.  Each of those families had  <br/>
three or four children (one eventually had nine).  Two other families  <br/>
in the group were homeschoolers using school-at-home methods.    We  <br/>
weren&#39;t planning to homeschool Kirby, but I was around those families  <br/>
in casual and more formal ways.  I was around kids without parents;  <br/>
the parents without kids.  I saw how they treated nursing infants, and  <br/>
how they treated six- and seven-year-olds.<br/>
<br/>
When Kirby was nearly five and it was nearly time for him to go to  <br/>
kindergarten, we decided to wait a year--to homeschool kindergarten.   <br/>
The decision of how to do it was simple.  We wanted our family to be  <br/>
more like those unschooling families, and MUCH less-to-not-at-all like  <br/>
those school-at-home families.<br/>

If the person who&#39;s talking to you is your own mother, if you have<br/>
resentments and sorrows from childhood that are still hurting you,<br/>
think twice before letting her tell you to treat your children as she<br/>
treated you.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
These words fill my heart with joy and silence of sadness both. Simply<br/>
because I have operated from this space of fear for years. I am so glad to<br/>
have found my own true voice where I can fearlessly tell even my mother and<br/>
father and my in laws to stop telling me to raise my children the way they<br/>
raised theirs. The amount of hard inner work I did for me to reach this<br/>
space is incredible and I am very happy for myself and at the moment that is<br/>
NOW, the children are blossoming pure and whole.<br/>

&gt; I&#39;m responding to myself, to that post I found from February.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And maybe the reason I pulled it was because I had a friend who told<br/>
&gt; me Kirby was going to hit me when he was grown because I didn&#39;t hit<br/>
&gt; him when he was little (five, at the time of the threat/curse). Six<br/>
&gt; or eight years ago, I would have told you that her son DID grow up to<br/>
&gt; hit her (even though, or perhaps *because*, she hit him) but six or<br/>
&gt; eight months ago, I would have told you that now her son is dead.<br/>
&gt; Overdose, either on purpose or accidental or inflicted by someone<br/>
&gt; else. Found dead on a street downtown, in mid December 2009. He was<br/>
&gt; about Marty&#39;s age.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have another thing to say about &quot;on a street downtown.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If Jefferson (because that was his name; Jeff short for Jefferson) had<br/>
&gt; felt more comfortable being at home, than being downtown using hard<br/>
&gt; drugs in the winter, he might be alive, but he didn&#39;t choose to be<br/>
&gt; around his mother, as a young man.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If Jefferson had been home playing video games (no matter how<br/>
&gt; &quot;violent&quot; they might have been called by wagging-fingered mothers who<br/>
&gt; liked to control their boys), he would have been home, near food and a<br/>
&gt; toilet; near a phone and a bed; in a house that could be locked. He<br/>
&gt; would have been safer at home playing video games than whatever he was<br/>
&gt; doing downtown with drugs.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Don&#39;t listen to what people are saying if their own children aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; extremely happy and well-adjusted.<br/>
&gt; If the person who&#39;s talking to you is your own mother, if you have<br/>
&gt; resentments and sorrows from childhood that are still hurting you,<br/>
&gt; think twice before letting her tell you to treat your children as she<br/>
&gt; treated you.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But more than all of that, don&#39;t live in the future or in the past.<br/>
&gt; Live today. If today is comfortable and loving and good, it will make<br/>
&gt; it easier to make tomorrow that way. After some hundreds or thousands<br/>
&gt; of comfortable, loving, good days, it makes it easier for the days and<br/>
&gt; years after that to be better.<br/>

My first reaction to this was that it was an unfounded and inaccurate generalization.  I tried looking again to see if I could find truth in it as it pertains to me and my life.  I have a short fuse and a great deal of anger in dealing with my husband&#39;s parents right now so that is the basis of my examination.  As I contemplated your statement and knew that I *am* strong within myself and I *know* we are living a wonderful life, I then needed to find the connection to my anger and harshness regarding the in-laws.  I came to this:  I am &quot;weak&quot; in that I have no control over their threats to call social services and I am &quot;unsure&quot; of whether they will do that or not and I am &quot;angry&quot; that they care more about being &quot;right&quot; (i.e. having our children in school and in church) than they do about our children OR their relationships with our children.<br/>
<br/>
I would warn to be very careful about platitudes....writing or reading, giving or receiving...but I was able to find a relationship with this within my life, fwiw.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1597150463">Nice sounding words. How are they helpful though? What does &quot;find<br/>
ourselves&quot; mean? What does &quot;strong within&quot; mean?<br/>
<br/>
Well, they are not just words. They are a culmination of three years of hard<br/>
inner work that I have done on myself after life pushed me to a corner that<br/>
had no walls, no doors, no windows. So the only place to go was within,<br/>
where I found murky streets, scary corners, ugly mirrors reflecting me,<br/>
storms and hurricanes. I walked alone through it all. Facing myself was the<br/>
most fearsome and difficult thing that I have done. But once I crossed over<br/>
the pain, I found love for myself, faith in me, unbound confidence in who I<br/>
am and my true potential. With that love for all those who are connected<br/>
with me became easier and flowing. It became easier to say YES and also to<br/>
say NO.<br/>
<br/>
Once all this was over then practicing it all the time is the key to find<br/>
inner strength. which simply means knowing from your bones that what we are<br/>
is the way we were meant to be. No need to be apologetic or shameful for our<br/>
true calling.<br/>
<br/>
 Is it more &quot;gentle to<br/>
others&quot; to pat them on the back and say soothing things or to point out<br/>
choices they&#39;re making that might be problematic?<br/>
<br/>
No, it simply means to be truthful and honest. No need to fight or get<br/>
upset. As long as the choices of others affect our lives, it matters. If it<br/>
doesn&#39;t affect us directly or indirectly, it is not problematic at all. But<br/>
can you see how important it is to know what really matters and what does<br/>
not. Discriminating consciously and in a wakeful way is a constant<br/>
practice.<br/>

It is alright to be tough, but if it is just an act then it can break us<br/>
emotionally and drain us of all our life energy....Leaving us angry, upset,<br/>
unsure and guilty. Since we &quot;think&quot; that the people around us are making us<br/>
feel that way, we blame them. But can you see how it all began<br/>
within.....This is the practice, going to the root of all our thoughts and<br/>
feelings.<br/>

There are many books. But to experience this journey from within is the only<br/>
way to learn. It is astounding to find all the love we need and all the<br/>
