<div id="ygrps-yiv-749875037">Hello,<br/>
I&#39;ve been subscribed for a day and have been sitting back, reading <br/>
the archives, and following Flora&#39;s newbie thread with interest.  Not <br/>
to throw this in your face, Flora, but MAN, I&#39;m realizing just how <br/>
lucky I am.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re going into our third year of homeschooling in the official <br/>
sense: that is, sending in &quot;required&quot; notification for the state of <br/>
Ohio for our two compulsory-aged children.  My husband and I have <br/>
five children altogether, between the ages of 9 years and 11 months <br/>
(g, b, g, b, b).  I have made some lame attemtpts to structure their <br/>
learning in the past.  It usually happens around the time of <br/>
those &quot;back-to-school&quot; ads and I get myself all geared up to &quot;do <br/>
something.&quot; Fortunately, I quickly come back to my senses and fall <br/>
back into our peaceful unschooling mode of life.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, our oldest daughter attended Catholic school for K (which was <br/>
a pleasant experience) and 1st grade (which was psychologically <br/>
damaging).  By the end of 1st grade, I was so fed up with the school, <br/>
her teacher, and the principal that I was tempted to never send any <br/>
of my kids back there.  Still, we registered for the following year <br/>
and came within a month of sending our son to K there.  A week <br/>
following K orientation, I decided once and for all that we&#39;d be <br/>
homeschooling and it was the best thing I&#39;ve ever done for our family.<br/>
<br/>
My mother is bewildered by how I could possibly manage to homeschool <br/>
my kids with all five of them being home all day.  I think this is <br/>
just because she had two kids, 7.5 years apart and worked full-time <br/>
when I started going to middle school.  Still, she is very supportive <br/>
and LOVES when I send her articles by John Taylor Gatto and John <br/>
Holt.  Having worked with school officials (county superintendant) <br/>
for most of her working years, I think she realizes how corrupt and <br/>
political the whole business is, and how most of it doesn&#39;t really <br/>
care about kids and real learning at all.<br/>
<br/>
My in-laws are also incredibly supportive.  I think my MIL is just <br/>
happy that I chose to stay home to raise her grandchildren.  They <br/>
were concerned about the socialization issue at first, but they know <br/>
how active we are with the local support groups and other homeschool <br/>
families that it isn&#39;t a concern.  They see how bright and articulate <br/>
the kids are, how well they can speak to grown-up strangers, that <br/>
they don&#39;t really care what or how they are learning.  <br/>
<br/>
My DH isn&#39;t completely aware that what we&#39;re doing is called <br/>
unschooling.  He just knows that we don&#39;t sit there all day plowing <br/>
through text books.  There&#39;s a part of him that would like to see <br/>
certain things improve, like our son&#39;s handwriting (why? he&#39;s only 7) <br/>
and our daughter&#39;s math facts (why? she can do math when she&#39;s <br/>
sufficiently motivated), so there&#39;s a little bit of deschooling left <br/>
for him.  I&#39;m proud of him, though.  He &quot;teaches&quot; 7th grade Sunday <br/>
school and the other teachers get so frustrated with him when he <br/>
rallies against efforts to try to standardize and test the students.  <br/>
When confronted with the question &quot;Well, then, how will you know that <br/>
they &#39;get it&#39;?&quot;  His response: &quot;I talk to them!&quot;  Imagine that!  <br/>
yeah, most of the kids are there because their parents want them to <br/>
be there, but they definitely enjoy the change of pace for their 7th <br/>
grade year.<br/>
<br/>
Enough about me,<br/>
