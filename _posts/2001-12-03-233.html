<div id="ygrps-yiv-240999779">I think everything works the same way.<br/>
<br/>
When people say, &quot;My son just sits and stares out the window, unschooling<br/>
isn&#39;t working&quot; it&#39;s hard to explain that this is unschooling, as much as<br/>
reading or writing or building or breathing is, no more, no less, and that<br/>
it&#39;s working just fine.<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m working with my dog and she offers up something and I don&#39;t respond<br/>
to it, she knows that that isn&#39;t what I was after. Silence means as much as<br/>
praise.<br/>
<br/>
Absence of light isn&#39;t just absence of light, it&#39;s also dark. :)<br/>
