<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047794643">Hello, group. I&#39;ve had trouble brewing and I wondered whether you&#39;d be able to help...<br/>
<br/>
My children are 7, 5, and 2 -- girl, boy, girl. Each of them delights me and makes me crazy in their own ways. Each and every time (which has been more frequently lately due to the end of the semester (I teach), my husband&#39;s military obligation for two weeks, and my dad&#39;s recent death) I say something harshly or impatiently or, yes, with an ugly face and loud voice, I see myself watching me and wonder how that woman deserves to be a mother and what makes her think she is any better for those precious, impressionable, regular kids than caring people in an institution like school?....  <br/>
<br/>
I am reading &quot;Living Joyfully with Children&quot; and feel more and more inept as I go. I read about these wonderful things that the family does and I wonder how I can even begin to try to change some bad habits our family has developed.<br/>
<br/>
As an example, my son, who is 5, saw a robot toy in Target yesterday. He said that he wanted it. I told him that we were shopping for something else and that we couldn&#39;t buy something every time we go into a store (this begging has been on the increase in the last few months). We are fortunate to have the means to be able to buy many items, and we never hesitate when the need is there and we can afford it, but it makes me nuts to have him beg and whine and beg and whine and beg and whine -- did I mention that he never stops repeating himself? By the time I got the checkout counter I was a wreck inside. People in line behind me were looking at me like &quot;do something with that kid!&quot; I should add that his little sister had picked up the chant, wouldn&#39;t stay seated, and was not really helping things at all. Oh, and our oldest decided to throw in some tears also -- she wanted to continue our shopping, but I was not about to spend another minute in the store. I had gotten the main thing I needed and I was ready to flee.<br/>
<br/>
When we got out in the parking lot and into the van, I turned around and yelled at Britton. I lectured and chastised and lectured some more. By the time we got home, all of us were spent. And I sobbed, wondering how I can know this is not good and still be unable to change, thereby unable to model the consistent kind, gentleness I dream of being the tone of our home.<br/>
<br/>
Before anyone gets to antsy about pointing out my faults, I really do see them; what I need your suggestions with is moving forward from here. In public with strangers, I appear to be this really patient person, but I struggle with remaining that patient at home....<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Jennifer<br/>

<br/>
WOW!  You really hit home.  I deal with the exact same issues.  I&#39;ll go to <br/>
bed and cry, thinking to myself.......&quot;How could I have been THAT kind of <br/>
mommy&quot;.  She deserves better than that.  I try to think of all the positive <br/>
things we have together but always remember the (1) time I messed it up.  <br/>
There was something that I remember reading that haunts me.<br/>
<br/>
IT TAKES 14 POSITIVES TO UNDO 1 NEGATIVE..............<br/>
<br/>
Then I&#39;m crushed.  I know when I fly off the handle that I&#39;m supposed to just <br/>
start laughing or say &quot;opps, mommy is making a mistake right now&quot;.  But <br/>
sometimes it&#39;s so hard not to go on.  <br/>

I would also appreciate any advice anyone has to offer.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>OK.  Well, first of all, as a mother of only 2 children, I would like to <br/>
say you really do have your hands full.  As a former very caring public <br/>
school teacher let me also tell you that there is NO WAY that they can <br/>
care for your children as much as you do.  I have tried.  It is <br/>
impossible.  Of course, I was a high school teacher so the ratio was <br/>
much greater than that of an elementary school teacher.  But still, 3:1 <br/>
is a whole lot better than 20+:1.  I know there are many wonderful, <br/>
caring teachers out there, but no one knows your children, or cares <br/>
about them like you do.<br/>

and have more patience.  Keep reading books like that.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I know exactly what you mean.  I have learned to ignore strangers.  I <br/>
don&#39;t want to get into what steps you need to stop the whining.  Maybe <br/>
someone else can do that for you.  I definitely ignore the strangers and <br/>
always remember that my children are more important than strangers.<br/>

are already 7 years old, so I know it&#39;s a lot easier for me right now <br/>
than it is for you.  But, when my boys were 4 and 5 and I think back to <br/>
my behavior back then, I am truly ashamed.  But, there were some other <br/>
things going on with my marriage and my having to work, etc.  It was a <br/>
very stressful time.  It is very difficult, but just KEEP TRYING to do <br/>
the right thing.  It will definitely get better as they get older.  If <br/>
you keep trying, the sooner it will get better.  That&#39;s my opinion.  You <br/>
really do have your hands full.  I can&#39;t imagine having 3 children that <br/>
age.  Remember, you are only human and you are allowed to make <br/>
mistakes.  My boys are very happy right now and the bad times didn&#39;t <br/>
seem to have any effect on them.  Thank goodness.<br/>

&gt; person, but I struggle with remaining that patient at home....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My only adivice, again, is to just keep trying your best to hold your <br/>
temper.  Remember, they are only children.  They can only express their <br/>
feelings in certain ways.  Always ignore the strangers and always try <br/>
your best.  I thinks it&#39;s only a matter of time before things get <br/>
better.  This is the advice of a very less than perfect mother who loves <br/>
her children very much and wants the very best for them.  And, remember, <br/>
as a former teacher, I can honestly say that NO ONE can care for your <br/>
children as much as you or your husband.  This is my opinion and <br/>
advice.  I&#39;m sorry if this post did not offer any constructive <br/>
suggestions.  Maybe someone else can help you there.<br/>

<h4>Pam Hartley</h4>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1891475472">Dog trainers have a phrase, &quot;Setting up for failure.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, such is a trip to Target with three young children unless you&#39;re<br/>
in a really good mood to start with. :)<br/>
<br/>
For some &quot;nuts and bolts&quot; suggestions:<br/>
<br/>
1. We have curbed a lot of the irritant here by just issuing allowances to<br/>
everyone (adults and children). My four year old is not a computational<br/>
genius, but she trusts me, so if we&#39;re in a store and she wants something, I<br/>
either tell her how much it is and how much she can afford, or tell her that<br/>
she&#39;s out of money until the first of the month. The allowances were agreed<br/>
on as a family, are eligible for review at any time, and seem to work well<br/>
for us.<br/>
<br/>
2. I am also very likely to offer bribes in exchange for accompanying me on<br/>
boring errands. I try not to drag anyone on boring errands to begin with<br/>
(bad enough that I have to go!) but when I do, I usually tell the girls to<br/>
pick something under whatever amount we can comfortably afford at the time<br/>
(some weeks, a buck. &lt;g&gt;) or offer a good activity in exchange for the bad<br/>
(a trip to the park for a trip to the bank).<br/>
<br/>
3. For big wants, I keep all-year Christmas and birthday lists going, and we<br/>
review the lists before the major holidays, pare them down, and then send<br/>
them to doting grandparents (yes, the grandparents want the lists &lt;g&gt;, and<br/>
we parents buy some of the biggies, too. Later, I think they&#39;ll start<br/>
actually saving money or working for more money, but mine don&#39;t seem<br/>
interested yet in long-term planning).<br/>
<br/>
For the actual problem (lack of patience, parental tantrums, etc.):<br/>
<br/>
You can control yourself. You might not feel like you can, but you can,<br/>
because you do so in public. That means that yelling, etc. in private is a<br/>
choice, not an act of God or nature. :) I don&#39;t say this to be snarky, but<br/>
because I think it&#39;s really helpful to look at it that way -- I *CAN*<br/>
control myself. It&#39;s my choice if I don&#39;t. If my child were a 31 year old<br/>
Hell&#39;s Angel not related to me, I would not be shrieking at him right now.<br/>
<br/>
All the usual stuff that you would do if an adult drove you nuts will work:<br/>
deep breaths, mentally counting to 10, making the decision NOT to yell back,<br/>
etc. Even if you&#39;re not calm, you can act calm, and eventually by acting<br/>
calm a lot you&#39;ll actually start to feel that way.<br/>
<br/>
Look at what environmental changes you can make to bring the irritation<br/>
level down as far as possible. The relationship you&#39;re building now is all<br/>
you have with your kids, it&#39;s worth really pulling it apart and making it<br/>
tick better.<br/>
<br/>

apologize.  Say you&#39;re sorry you lost your temper, and, if you can, <br/>

worthwhile. :)  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe something like this could help?  If he doesn&#39;t beg at the store, he can <br/>
stay awake a little later on the weekend, like the big boy he&#39;s been behaving <br/>
as?   Or perhaps he could have a special dinner/movie on the weekend if he&#39;s <br/>

allowing himself to beg.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s still young - and a lot of it comes with age.  I think you&#39;re doing the <br/>
right thing by trying to steer him clear of this behavior now, rather than <br/>
later, though. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1386272977">I would like to respectfully disagree with your advice here.  I always <br/>
TRY and stay away from &quot;if you do this then I will give you this&quot; <br/>
solutions.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, I think it would be best, at this point, to absolutely <br/>
refuse to buy the toy, or whatever it is, and stand your ground.  Let <br/>
the tantrum take it&#39;s course and try and ignore the stares from <br/>
strangers as much as possible.  After your child goes through this <br/>
experience a few times s/he will eventually learn that his behavior is <br/>
not working.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this doesn&#39;t sound cruel.  But, that is what I would do.  <br/>
Luckily, I only suffered tantrums in situations like that a few times.  <br/>
At this point, my boys (age 7) know that when I say NO it is NO.  I <br/>
usually give them an honest explanation why it is no and they usually <br/>
understand.  Of course, my boys are older than most of your kids.  But, <br/>
this is how I have handled it from the very beginning.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes they are allowed to get a toy and sometimes they are not.  It <br/>
all depends on the condition of my finances.  So, sometimes they are <br/>
allowed to choose a toy within a certain price range and sometimes I <br/>
just can&#39;t afford it.  They seem to understand that very well by now.  I <br/>
have found that it is always best to be truthful with my children and <br/>
let them know exactly how things are.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t believe in giving rewards for good behavior.  Good behavior <br/>
should be expected.  But, at the same time, if they&#39;re having a bad day, <br/>
or they really have their heart set on something you can&#39;t give them, <br/>
then allow them to be upset and ignore the strangers.  This is how my <br/>
boys and I go shopping.<br/>

to my job.  The kids learned early that whining and begging for &quot;whatever&quot; <br/>
did not good, whether we were in the store or at home. We said no and that <br/>
was it. We did not spank them but we were firmed and we ignored their cries. <br/>
It only took a few times before they quit trying. They saw it did not work. <br/>
We did not buy the kids lots of toys but we spent a lot of time with them. We <br/>
played games, went hiking, did projects together. We respected each other. <br/>
But that does not mean they were perfect or I was either. I made mistakes and <br/>
so have they. We have all apologized and I hope I have learned from my <br/>
mistakes. Now my children are about grown. My girls 17 and 15 babysit several <br/>
full days a week for their 5 and 3 yr old cousins. They are learning quickly <br/>
how hard it is to be a &quot;parent&quot;. I just smile. I know, I know. <br/>

&gt; In my opinion, I think it would be best, at this point, to absolutely <br/>
&gt; refuse to buy the toy, or whatever it is, and stand your ground.  Let <br/>
&gt; the tantrum take it&#39;s course and try and ignore the stares from <br/>
&gt; strangers as much as possible.  After your child goes through this <br/>
&gt; experience a few times s/he will eventually learn that his behavior is <br/>
&gt; not working.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope this doesn&#39;t sound cruel.  But, that is what I would do.  <br/>
&gt; Luckily, I only suffered tantrums in situations like that a few times.  <br/>
&gt; At this point, my boys (age 7) know that when I say NO it is NO.  I <br/>
&gt; usually give them an honest explanation why it is no and they usually <br/>
&gt; understand.  Of course, my boys are older than most of your kids.  But, <br/>
&gt; this is how I have handled it from the very beginning.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sometimes they are allowed to get a toy and sometimes they are not.  It <br/>
&gt; all depends on the condition of my finances.  So, sometimes they are <br/>
&gt; allowed to choose a toy within a certain price range and sometimes I <br/>
&gt; just can&#39;t afford it.  They seem to understand that very well by now.  I <br/>
&gt; have found that it is always best to be truthful with my children and <br/>
&gt; let them know exactly how things are.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t believe in giving rewards for good behavior.  Good behavior <br/>
&gt; should be expected.  But, at the same time, if they&#39;re having a bad day, <br/>
&gt; or they really have their heart set on something you can&#39;t give them, <br/>
&gt; then allow them to be upset and ignore the strangers.  This is how my <br/>
&gt; boys and I go shopping.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see your point. You know your children better than I, and you know what <br/>
will work with your children.<br/>
<br/>
For me, I had a lot less problematic areas by rewarding their good behavior <br/>
and ignoring their bad behaviors.  We&#39;ve walked out of the store on several <br/>
occasions during a tantrum.  I&#39;ve also offered incentives.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s a particularly problematic area, I may offer an incentive for a week <br/>
or two and they have accustomed themselves to &quot;catching themselves&quot; in the <br/>
midst of the problem area.  <br/>
<br/>
When they were about 4-5 years old, we had a chart on the refrigerator with <br/>
basic blocks:  helping mommy, picking up toys, being kind to siblings, etc.  <br/>
If I witnessed them doing the things on the chart, I would put a happy face <br/>
sticker on the block (sometimes they&#39;d earn a few on each block).  They were <br/>
proud of the charts and seeing that I was recognizing what they were doing <br/>
well.  One son was very upset that he received a &quot;frowny face&quot; on the square <br/>
and grandma was coming later that day and would know he hadn&#39;t been behaving. <br/>
LOL.  My goal was to have them monitor themselves - to be aware of their <br/>
behavior over the course of the day/week - and it has been working well for <br/>
us.  The first week, they were actually surprised to see how many times <br/>
during the week they had thrown a tantrum.  It may not work for your family, <br/>
but it definitely worked for ours. :)<br/>

I have never liked the idea of positive and negative reinforcement, or <br/>
punishments and rewards.  I find it manipulative and stay away from it <br/>
as much as possible.  This is one of the reasons I don&#39;t send my kids to <br/>
school.  Teachers are continually using positive and negative <br/>
reinforcement.  It is something they are taught to do.<br/>

<br/>
Part A, you could have said yes instead of no.<br/>

And Part A, if the begging is on the increase he&#39;s needy, but not for robots. <br/>
 give him something:  time, backrubs, a new tape or CD of something he likes, <br/>
or rearrange his room, or make his favorite food.  There are cheap and free <br/>

<br/>
&lt;&lt;  just keep trying your best to hold your <br/>
<br/>
temper.  Remember, they are only children.  They can only express their <br/>
<br/>
feelings in certain ways.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If better ways are modelled for them, they have more and better choices, <br/>
though.  To say &quot;They&#39;re just kids&quot; is true, but kids are bright, and they <br/>
aren&#39;t acting in a vacuum.<br/>
<br/>
Holding one&#39;s temper is great, but it helps to change your beliefs, your <br/>
attitude, your oxygen level/heart rate and to increase your own range of <br/>
choices.<br/>
<br/>
The best trick I know is to give yourself two choices, for starters.  If <br/>
you&#39;ve been thinking &quot;All I can do is X,&quot; next time give yourself X and Y <br/>
(another, better choice).  If Y works for you, afterward think of something <br/>
that might have worked even better.  Next time, don&#39;t make old, inferior X a <br/>
choice--choose between Y and Z.  Soon you&#39;ll have more than two tried and <br/>
true choices.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Even if you&#39;re not calm, you can act calm, and eventually by acting<br/>
calm a lot you&#39;ll actually start to feel that way.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Good point.  This is a version of &quot;fake it &#39;til you make it&quot; and also related <br/>
to my changing your attitude and beliefs.<br/>
<br/>
People make decisions based on their philosophies, their prioirities, their <br/>
belief systems.  Even people who don&#39;t think they have belief systems have <br/>
things they consider good and bad, acceptable and unacceptable.  Many, <br/>
unfortunately, give children a slim range of &quot;acceptable&quot; and themselves a <br/>
HUGE range.  If you change your belief system to say that it&#39;s not far for <br/>
children to take the dregs of life and the adults to enjoy all the fruits and <br/>
privilege, then it will affect not only the way your treat your children but <br/>
the way you interpret what they say and do.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The relationship you&#39;re building now is all<br/>
you have with your kids, it&#39;s worth really pulling it apart and making it<br/>
tick better.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Yes; pam said a wise thing for sure.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or perhaps he could have a special dinner/movie on the weekend if he&#39;s <br/>
controlled himself all week.  I&#39;d try to find a bonus that he gains by not <br/>
allowing himself to beg.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
A week is like a lifetime to a little kid.<br/>
Maybe remembering to thank him when he&#39;s helpful, to say &quot;I&#39;m really glad we <br/>
had fun in the store today&quot; if he wasn&#39;t whiney, instead of commenting on the <br/>
negative behavior and taking positive behavior for granted.<br/>
<br/>
And if kids learn to perform for incentives, it can become a lifetime habit.  <br/>
Should his wife reward him with food or movies (or whatever wives have) if <br/>
he&#39;s good all week?  Meeting his needs first could avert the negative <br/>
consequences of neediness.<br/>
<br/>
Like...  If I promised Kirby if he was sweet and cooperative all day I&#39;d give <br/>
him a high-protein dinner, it would be hard for him.  He&#39;s fairly well <br/>
hypo-glycemic, and gets a headache if he goes several hours without eating <br/>
something good.  If I give him a protein breakfast and a protein lunch (at <br/>
least one or the other), he WILL be sweet.  If I withhold what he needs <br/>
contingent on behavior, I&#39;m setting me, him, the family and the neighbors up <br/>
for frustration.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;In my opinion, I think it would be best, at this point, to absolutely <br/>
<br/>
refuse to buy the toy, or whatever it is, and stand your ground.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think that&#39;s better than &quot;maybe later.&quot;<br/>
Why insult a child and destroy hope?  <br/>
Why let a tantrum come and bloom and continue and die when it can be averted <br/>
by sweet and honest communication between people?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Let the tantrum take it&#39;s course and try and ignore the stares from <br/>
<br/>
strangers as much as possible. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I think, when I&#39;m in a store, that the other people have the particular right <br/>
to shop in peace.  I have read baffling advice from homeschooling moms (and <br/>
some others) who are  basically saying &quot;to hell with other people; live your <br/>
life with your child as though other people don&#39;t exist.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
I try to be considerate of everyone--strangers, waiters, store personnel, my <br/>
children--and the kids pick it up.  If in the course of being cold to your <br/>
children you are also cold and cruel to strangers, who learns what??<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t believe in giving rewards for good behavior.  Good behavior <br/>
<br/>
should be expected.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When my husband does something really sweet I tell him so.  I smile and hug <br/>
him and brag him up to my friends and tell him a few hours later or the next <br/>
day or week or years later what a cool thing it was that he did whatever it <br/>
was for me.  I thanked him the other day for the fine genetic contribution to <br/>
the kids.  He said he never expected to be thanked for that so long after the <br/>
fact.<br/>
<br/>
Is that rewarding good behavior?  I hope so.  I would hate to just expect <br/>
good behavior from my husband and for him to have to learn not to expect <br/>
positive feedback or reward of any sort, just a flat &quot;no&quot; when I don&#39;t want <br/>
to do something with or for him.<br/>
<br/>
Except in the few obvious ways, I don&#39;t treat my children in a lesser way <br/>
than I treat my husband.  It has been crucial to our interactions as an <br/>
unschooling family that the kids were people first, and kids only incidently <br/>
and temporarily.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-498634271">It&#39;s always the best mothers who are hardest on themselves. The mothers who are slapping their kids in K-Mart do not go home and cry their anguish out over being crappy moms. They think they&#39;re good moms and their little brats get what they deserve. After all, their parents spanked them and they turned out OK, right? Right?<br/>
<br/>
Stop kicking yourself for not being perfect. Once things calm down and you&#39;re able to do so, you can say to your kids, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I lost my temper like that. I felt really stressed about what was going on, but that&#39;s not the way I want to react. I&#39;m going to work on it. Maybe we can work on our temper tantrums together.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There aren&#39;t many of us who haven&#39;t been there, but if you met most of us in real life, you&#39;d think we were good moms. You are too.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; appreciates being thanked for gifts or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think praise ofr thanks or whatever that is honest is very different<br/>
from the same that is intended to manipulate behavior. I cringe every<br/>
time I hear a parent drone &quot;Thanks you for obeying the first time&quot; to a<br/>
kid, or something similar - that&#39;s not an honest expression of thanks,<br/>
that&#39;s intended to mold their behavior. Cacie made dinner to night for<br/>
all of us (well, my dad and me, my mom is sticking to Ensure lately) and<br/>
we thanked her profusely - it was a lovely dinner, something she&#39;s never<br/>
done before - she usually sticks to desserts. Maybe she&#39;ll do it again -<br/>
after the success of tonight&#39;s dinner she was offering to cook every<br/>
night - but maybe she won&#39;t, and I didn&#39;t intend my thanking her to lead<br/>
to an encore performance - I just appreciated it.<br/>
<br/>
I will sometimes offer her something in exchange for doing something she<br/>
doesn&#39;t like, usually it&#39;s something like, &quot;If you come to the post<br/>
office with me, we could stop at the coffee place on the way home for a<br/>
drink&quot; or whatever.  I think I&#39;d do the same for a friend who was doing<br/>
me a favor. I&#39;m probably less likely to do it when it&#39;s just some<br/>
necessary chore, like the grocery store, but she can stay home alone now<br/>
for that anyway.<br/>

Seems like a brilliant way to let him compose text without the pain of the<br/>
reluctant secretary (me).  Of course,  I have anxiety that with this<br/>
*crutch* he&#39;ll NEVER learn how to spell or write (will these be archaic<br/>
tasks soon?)  (Currently his spelling skills are limited to the occasional<br/>
3-letter word.  I&#39;m not talking about wanting to discover a latent talent<br/>
for spelling bees, I just want him to be able to type &quot;video game&quot; on the<br/>
search for line in Google without his mother some day.)  <br/>
<br/>
So what do you all think?  Should I spring for the gadget (a mere $179) and<br/>
unleash his creativity  or should I hold his feet to the fire of<br/>
incompetence and make him learn how to spell with say, nightly workbook<br/>
pages and M&M rewards.  Let&#39;s vote.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone ever use this Sony thing?  I&#39;d be curious about how easy it is to<br/>
use.  I mean, does IT know how to spell?<br/>

&gt; &lt;&lt;Â  just keep trying your best to hold your<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; temper.Â  Remember, they are only children.Â  They can only express their<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; feelings in certain ways.Â  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If better ways are modelled for them, they have more and better choices,<br/>
&gt; though.Â  To say &quot;They&#39;re just kids&quot; is true, but kids are bright, and <br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; aren&#39;t acting in a vacuum.<br/>
&gt; =================================================================<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree.  Modelling is the best teacher, especially over time.  <br/>
It definitely works for my kids.  As I stated before - sometimes I&#39;m <br/>
able to buy them something and other times I am not.  50% of the time I <br/>
can and 50% of the time I can&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
When I have to say &quot;no&quot;, usually, about 90% of the time, it&#39;s no big <br/>
deal and they understand.  When I say &quot;no&quot;.  That isn&#39;t all I say.  I <br/>
always explain why and I tell them &quot;maybe next time&quot; or &quot;maybe Papa will <br/>
buy it for you&quot;. They usually understand.  But, there&#39;s still that 10% <br/>
of the time, however, where they are really disappointed I won&#39;t get <br/>
them something and they&#39;ll get upset.  It&#39;s usually Leroy.  He&#39;ll get <br/>
really mad and start crying.  I hate to see it and it upsets me, but I <br/>
honestly don&#39;t know what to do about it except try and give him a hug <br/>
and comfort him (if he lets me).   Why isn&#39;t it all right for my son to <br/>
show his feelings in this way?    What am I to do about it in this <br/>
particular situation?  Yes, modelling absolutely works, but there are <br/>
still times when Leroy&#39;s feelings overtake him and I don&#39;t see anything <br/>
wrong with him showing them.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; =================================================================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The best trick I know is to give yourself two choices, for starters.Â  If<br/>
&gt; you&#39;ve been thinking &quot;All I can do is X,&quot; next time give yourself X <br/>
&gt; and Y<br/>
&gt; (another, better choice).Â  If Y works for you, afterward think of <br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; that might have worked even better.Â  Next time, don&#39;t make old, <br/>
&gt; inferior X a<br/>
&gt; choice--choose between Y and Z.Â  Soon you&#39;ll have more than two tried <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; true choices.<br/>
&gt; =================================================================<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Thank you for this suggestion.  I will DEFINITELY try that.<br/>
=====================================================================<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Â  Many,<br/>
&gt; unfortunately, give children a slim range of &quot;acceptable&quot; and <br/>
&gt; themselves a<br/>
&gt; HUGE range.Â <br/>
 </span></blockquote>==================================================================<br/>
I believe I give my children a large range of acceptable behavior.  <br/>
Larger, in fact, than too many people will not accept.<br/>
=================================================================<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;In my opinion, I think it would be best, at this point, to absolutely<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; refuse to buy the toy, or whatever it is, and stand your ground.Â  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s better than &quot;maybe later.&quot;<br/>
&gt; Why insult a child and destroy hope?<br/>
 </span></blockquote>==================================================================<br/>
In our case, believe me, my boys KNOW that, eventually, they get almost <br/>
everything they want.  We love to make them happy and I think that is a <br/>
good thing.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; =================================================================Â <br/>
&gt; Why let a tantrum come and bloom and continue and die when it can be <br/>
&gt; averted<br/>
&gt; by sweet and honest communication between people?<br/>
&gt; =================================================================<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Please don&#39;t think that all I say is &quot;NO&quot; and I walk away with my backs <br/>
to them.  I always explain in a very calm and &quot;sweet&quot; way why I can&#39;t <br/>
and I tell them that we&#39;ll probably be able to get it another time.  <br/>
And, we usually do.  This usually works almost all of the time, but, <br/>
like I said before, once in a great while, it just doesn&#39;t work and <br/>
Leroy gets upset.  We&#39;re very big into hugs, but when Leroy is angry, <br/>
nothing will calm him.<br/>
===================================================================<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt; Let the tantrum take it&#39;s course and try and ignore the stares from<br/>
&gt;<br/>

&gt; right<br/>
&gt; to shop in peace.Â <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>====================================================================<br/>
I think, when I&#39;m in a store with my children, that the other people <br/>
should respect the fact that children can get upset at times and that <br/>
they can not control their behavior as well as adults.  Adults should <br/>
show more patience toward children than to other adults.  Do you think <br/>
that a 6 or 7 year-old can control his feelings as well as an adult?  <br/>
Mine don&#39;t always do and, on the whole, they behave quite well.  I think <br/>
adults should give children some slack.<br/>
====================================================================<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I have read baffling advice from homeschooling moms (and<br/>
&gt; some others) who areÂ  basically saying &quot;to hell with other people; live <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; life with your child as though other people don&#39;t exist.&quot;Â <br/>
&gt; ==================================================================<br/>
 </span></blockquote>On the whole, Leroy is very sweet and pleasant to be around - he&#39;s had <br/>
good modeling.  Part of the reason for this modeling is so that he will <br/>
be accepted in society.  But, what you quoted above is exactly how I <br/>
feel on those rare occasions when he is upset.  I feel I must have this <br/>
attitude or else I may feel like I must punish Leroy for showing his <br/>
feelings.<br/>
==================================================================<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I try to be considerate of everyone--strangers, waiters, store <br/>
&gt; personnel, my<br/>
&gt; children--and the kids pick it up.Â  If in the course of being cold to <br/>
&gt; your<br/>
&gt; children you are also cold and cruel to strangers, who learns what??<br/>
&gt; ================================================================<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do you think I am cold to my children?<br/>
=================================================================<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &lt;&lt;I don&#39;t believe in giving rewards for good behavior.Â  Good behavior<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; should be expected.Â  &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When my husband does something really sweet I tell him so.Â  I smile and <br/>
&gt; hug<br/>
&gt; him and brag him up to my friends and tell him a few hours later or the <br/>
&gt; next<br/>
&gt; day or week or years later what a cool thing it was that he did <br/>
&gt; whatever it<br/>
&gt; was for me.Â  I thanked him the other day for the fine genetic <br/>
&gt; contribution to<br/>
&gt; the kids.Â  He said he never expected to be thanked for that so long <br/>
&gt; after the<br/>
&gt; fact.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is that rewarding good behavior?Â  I hope so.Â  I would hate to just <br/>
&gt; expect<br/>
&gt; good behavior from my husband and for him to have to learn not to expect<br/>
&gt; positive feedback or reward of any sort, just a flat &quot;no&quot; when I don&#39;t <br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; to do something with or for him.<br/>
&gt; ================================================================<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You are talking about something totally different.  We are talking about <br/>
a trip to Walmart.  I personally don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea to say <br/>
something like &quot;if you stop crying, we&#39;ll go to the playground later&quot; or <br/>
&quot;if you behave, we&#39;ll go see a movie on Wednesday&quot;.  I would like my <br/>
boys to behave in the manner they wish to behave, not for a reward or <br/>
just to please me.<br/>
<br/>
I do compliment them on their behavior quite often, but certainly not <br/>
every single time we go to the store.  I don&#39;t happen to believe that <br/>
children need a compliment for every single thing they do.  Once in a <br/>
while for ordinary things is great and always when there is something <br/>
exceptional.  My compliments are always very sincere and they mean <br/>
something.  They know I appreciate and love them.  I tell and show them <br/>
this all the time.  We are very close and they know I respect them.<br/>
====================================================================<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Except in the few obvious ways, I don&#39;t treat my children in a lesser <br/>
&gt; way<br/>
&gt; than I treat my husband.Â  It has been crucial to our interactions as an<br/>
&gt; unschooling family that the kids were people first, and kids only <br/>
&gt; incidently<br/>
&gt; and temporarily.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Sandra<br/>
&gt; ================================================================<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I totally agree.  I treat my children and my husband equally.  I also <br/>
respect the fact that young children have feelings and that they should <br/>
be allowed to show them when they just can&#39;t contain themselves.  Do you <br/>
think that respecting the fact that YOUNG children do not have as much <br/>
self-control as adults is in some way treating them with less respect <br/>
than one treats an adult?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1857111108">LOL! You don&#39;t necessarily need a $179 gadget. I&#39;m pretty sure <br/>
voice-recognition software can be had cheaper than that these days (unless<br/>
he really needs/wants it for &quot;on the go&quot; and not just in front of the<br/>
computer).<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think calculators keep people from learning to add 7 + 8. I don&#39;t<br/>
think voice activation software will make a child unable to spell<br/>
(especially since I believe good spellers are partly born and partly trained<br/>
from reading words spelled correctly).<br/>

So now that you won&#39;t need those M&Ms as rewards, you can mail them to me.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think there is a big difference between trying to manipulate someone by <br/>
using positive and negative reinforcement in superficial ways and honestly <br/>
negotiating or honestly just giving a gift.<br/>
<br/>
If I say to my kids, &quot;I&#39;m up against a scheduling deadline and really need to <br/>
spend an hour in the mall, shopping for a gift for somebody you don&#39;t even <br/>
know and I know it is not what you want to do for the next hour -- but if you <br/>
can bear with me, and go along and cooperate, I&#39;ll do something for you, too, <br/>
later. What might you like?&quot; That&#39;s just playing fair - I just don&#39;t see it <br/>
as manipulating or bribing. <br/>
<br/>
What Alfie Kohn opposes is positive or negative reinforcement as a way of <br/>
trying to &quot;shape&quot; behavior -- it isn&#39;t treating children respectfully, it is <br/>
&quot;training&quot; them - like an an animal. It works to an extent, of course, and <br/>
Alfie Kohn admits that it might be useful if ALL you care about is the <br/>
immediate results and not the long run consequences. He points out that there <br/>
are not-so-obvious messages that kids get when parents use behaviorist <br/>
techniques on them. When they get told they&#39;ll get a sticker for reading <br/>
every few pages of a book, they might think that means that the parent <br/>
doesn&#39;t think reading is inherently worthwhile or fun, for example. But I <br/>
really think that the greatest harm of such systems is that it dehumanizes <br/>
the child; it is disrespectful. This doesn&#39;t, to me, contradict telling other <br/>
people when they&#39;ve done things you appreciate. I mean, Sandra telling her <br/>
husband that she&#39;s grateful for his genetic stock isn&#39;t her trying to &quot;shape&quot; <br/>
him into providing even more good genetic stock &lt;G&gt;. It is just niceness. It <br/>
is lubricant for ongoing good relationship. I don&#39;t think Alfie Kohn ever <br/>
meant that people should not comment on kids behavior - &quot;Wow, that was a long <br/>
and pretty boring trip. You handled it really well. Thank you.&quot; Say it <br/>
because it is true and because it gives the child pleasure to hear it.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>YES YES YES!!! This is so true. . .thank you for pointing this out. It is a <br/>
good reminder for me and I suppose all of us that loose patience. It is a <br/>
choice. . . we can forgive ourselves, but we have to remember we are not <br/>
powerless in this situaiton, even though it may feel so. It also may be <br/>
helpful to explore (at some other time, not in the store) why those rageful <br/>
feelings come up. . . what is the lesson for us in this situation. . .what is <br/>
the universe trying to help us learn here. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I dont think this would work for us. . .because we dont set arbitrary <br/>
bedtimes or things like that. Our children are free to choose bedtimes, <br/>
movies, dinners, etc. And this sets up this external reward system that is so <br/>
contrary to unschooling I think. . . I dont know. . . maybe others have <br/>
different insights on it.<br/>

would certainly hate it if my &quot;behaviour&quot; was up there on the fridge for <br/>
everyone to see. . . how embarassing I think. I guess manipulation and <br/>
incentives, etc. is so ingrained in us and that is part of the deschooling <br/>
process we still go through. . . sigh. . . it is an ongoing process.<br/>
