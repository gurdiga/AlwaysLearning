And for  me to say  <br/>
that my child has received the full course of instruction  seems  <br/>
dishonest, as there was no full course of  instruction<br/>

Mine doesn&#39;t say that.  It doesn&#39;t have to say that.  It says  &quot;meets all the <br/>
requirements of the State of Arkansas&quot; or something  similar.  I don&#39;t have <br/>
it on a computer anymore so I don&#39;t know exactly  what it said.<br/>
 <br/>
There are no requirements of the state of Arkansas, so he naturally met all  <br/>
of them.  Or none of them.  &lt;g&gt;  It also said something  about how he met all <br/>
the requirements of our &quot;homeschool&quot;.  I could  make a long long list of all <br/>
the things he had done and was capable of which  could be translated in to <br/>
educationese to satisfy the most persnickety  educrat.  But I didn&#39;t.  I just <br/>
said, &quot;He graduated.&quot;<br/>
