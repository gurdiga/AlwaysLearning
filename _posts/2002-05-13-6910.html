Mind you, I got confused at the registration form (that&#39;s a ps <br/>
education for ya...). It doesn&#39;t make it clear if the $55 registration <br/>
includes food and acoomidation or not? It&#39;s expensive enough for a <br/>
conference that it might yet cheaper than your average room.<br/>

Maybe I&#39;ll take a tent. I&#39;d love to take my kids but the cost is a bit <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m sorry, I felt it was clear. The $55 does NOT include food or <br/>
accommodation. The hotel has given us a very good rate for the rooms <br/>
($72/night)---and you&#39;ll find the hotel link on the website. There are <br/>
several fine dining and fast food restaurants and even&quot;cheap, good food&quot; (and <br/>
even a few vegetarian ones&lt;g&gt;) within a short drive. Plus there&#39;s a dining <br/>
room in the hotel (they have wonderful soups). <br/>
<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve tried to keep the registration fees low and keep expenses low (thank you <br/>
presenters!), and there&#39;s a huge discount if you register early (mainly to <br/>
keep me sane knowing that SOMEONE is coming! &lt;G&gt;). This is a three day <br/>
conference with entertainment/presentations/information/activities for all <br/>
ages and best of all a chance to meet all these neat people IN REAL LIFE! I <br/>
thought $55/adult and $35/child was a bargain.<br/>
<br/>
Living here, I can&#39;t say for sure about campgrounds (I&#39;ve never needed one!), <br/>
but I feel sure there are plenty very nearby.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ll be putting a message board on the website very soon so that attendees <br/>
can communicate with each other in arranging carpools, caravans, and room <br/>
sharing. Please let me know what else I can to to make it easier for y&#39;all to <br/>
join us!<br/>
