<div id="ygrps-yiv-374086946">I&#39;m 38 and it is still a shock to me when I realize that people think of me<br/>
as an adult.  I&#39;m like &quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;m almost middle aged.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My childhood was very happy....no drinking, drugging, abuse.  No yelling and<br/>
screaming.  No mind games.  My parents continue to be my close friends.<br/>
<br/>
My parents gave me lots of room to make decisions.  I knew exactly where<br/>
they stood on issues and I was often grounded and they disapproved of some<br/>
of my friends.  But my friends were always welcome at my home and<br/>
communication was always open.  Of course, my mom and I were talking the<br/>
other day and she stated how surprised she was with how my life has turned<br/>
out.  She said she never figured me for the homeschooling mom of 5 who loves<br/>
raising her own food.  I asked where had she thought I would end up and she<br/>
responded &quot;the Witness Protection Program&quot; with a laugh.  Hmmmm.<br/>

sort like witness prtecting. Your Mama wasn&#39;t too far<br/>
off.<br/>
