<div id="ygrps-yiv-240809311">In the past couple of months I&#39;ve gotten questions a couple of times about whether it&#39;s okay to have a slow day with no learning.   My initial answer to new unschoolers who are worried is that school is 180 days a year.  185 days, NOT school.  (If any nation or jurisdiction has a legal schoolyear of more days, change the number to suit your local truth).<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s always a beginner&#39;s question, and that&#39;s fine.<br/>
<br/>
I paid for a little video related to that, it arrived today, and here&#39;s a link:<br/>

<br/>
When you see it, if you know what it is, guess &quot;How many years?&quot;  Think about it before you look or count. :-)  <br/>
I was surprised.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-34053992">Hi<br/>
<br/>
My seven year old daughter wants to roller blade without her helmet and safety equipment.<br/>
<br/>
She is still learning and is a bit wobbly. I really don&#39;t want her to be without her helmet and am scared of her falling on the hard tile floor outside.<br/>
<br/>
At the moment, I have said I&#39;m not willing to let her go out unless she holds my hand.<br/>
<br/>
I would really appreciate your thoughts on this matter.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance.<br/>
<br/>

<div>Our son (9 at the time)&nbsp;got a motorized dirt bike last summer.&nbsp; 
He did not want to wear his equipment &amp; my mom was a nervous wreck but I 
didn&#39;t want to insist that he wear it.&nbsp; The more my mom suggested it the 
more resistant he became to the idea.&nbsp; I took him aside &amp; told him not 
to worry about Nana.&nbsp; I said I would feel better if he wore his equipment 
because road rash is painful &amp; I loved his head just the way it is so it 
would be a shame to see&nbsp;it dented in or anything.&nbsp; I made it 
lighthearted &amp; jokey.&nbsp; He continued to ride without his protective gear 
a few times &amp; then decided that maybe it would be a better idea to wear 
it.&nbsp; He continued to experiment with not wearing once in awhile but mostly 
chose to wear it.&nbsp; I&#39;ve noticed that so far this summer it&#39;s no question in 
his mind -&nbsp;he puts the equipment on.&nbsp; </div>

require helmets for kids when they&#39;re riding bikes, but here in California<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1813870149"><html><head></head><div>I&#39;m a nurse. Some head injuries are far more dangerous than others. The risks associated with head injuries are far greater than those associated with a smashed knee - ie. Not just a scratch or a dent. Seemingly innocuous bumps on the back of the head can kill a few hours later. Personally, I don&#39;t think the fear of head injuries when your risk of falling and hitting your head on something very hard is much higher than normal is out of proportion and I&#39;m a parent who is usually very vocal about not living in fear. I don&#39;t know how I&#39;d make choices as to how to react if my kids refused to wear helmets when cycling, but I wanted to write this because &#39;I never wore a helmet and I don&#39;t have a brain injury&#39; doesn&#39;t seem to be a very fair argument. I&#39;d like to really know how many dangerous brain injuries bike helmets have caused rather than know a few people who are still alive and not paralysed despite not wearing one. I may not be so concerned about helmet use if I knew it didn&#39;t make much difference.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div><div><div style="font-size:75%;color:#575757;">Sent from Samsung Mobile</div></div></html></div>

 </span></blockquote>The website <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://cyclehelmets.org">http://cyclehelmets.org</a> has links to research on bike helmet effectiveness and the effects of helmet-requiring legislation. <br/>
<br/>
The effectiveness of bike helmets in preventing injury is hotly debated in cycling circles. What is pretty well agreed on though is that helmet legislation significantly decreases participation - so fewer people cycle if helmets are required. From a public health point of view this is something of an own goal, as more people cycling = improvement in other public health measures (lifespan, general health, etc). <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t wear a bike helmet, and I used to be a cycle instructor. (In the UK, where there is no law requiring it.) Some of my fellow instructors did wear one, most didn&#39;t. We didn&#39;t recommend in either direction, but encouraged people to do their own research (helmets may actually increase some risks eg rotational injury). To friends, I say: do whatever makes you most likely to get on your bike :) if you feel happier with a helmet, wear one; if not, then not. But do make sure you have lights at night and obey road rules, and it&#39;s a very good idea to learn about best safe practice for road riding (either through lessons or books or online or whatever suits you). <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-716886369">My husband and I wear our helmets a lot of the time between bikes and motorcycles. We are fans of detailing them. For the kids and ourselves we buy matte-painted helmets so we can paint our own designs on them. 
There are some things the kids are into right now that require helmets (hockey, roller derby, bike clubs, outdoor rock climbing) but I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever &#39;made&#39; them wear one. We make safety gear available to use, and if they have a choice sometimes they do and sometimes they don&#39;t.

 My son, in the very hot part of the summer, never wants to wear a helmet because he sweats too much even with a shaved head. We haven&#39;t found a helmet suited with good venting to help him, yet, so he&#39;s helmet free most days.

And, on a safety note - as Sandra said - it makes sense for contact sports needing helmets and body protection. Plus I think extreme sports like motorcross and maybe BMX bikers should probably be pretty protected. But those are high speeds or purposely smashing into someone or something which is much different then going 5 miles an hour on blades, scooters, or bikes.</div>

Sometimes I do too. :) It takes a lot of pressure off of my head with a helmet on. There&#39;s another little girl we bike with that always has a mid-head french braid under a helmet. It could be simple comfort things that you could suggest. I&#39;ll suggest to the kids, but I won&#39;t push it too far. Sometimes my son had already made up his mind well before we even back the bikes that he isn&#39;t going to wear anything protective and isn&#39;t in the mood to discuss it. We respect it as much as we can. There is one bike club that isn&#39;t too keen on our lack of helmet use on certain days so we&#39;re currently searching for a new club.</div>

 </span></blockquote>I suspect it&#39;s hard to think clearly about the issue because &quot;bike riding&quot; is treated as a uniform activity. But some riding is more dangerous than others.<br/>
<br/>
I see helmeted kids riding circles in their driveway on their bikes with training wheels. They&#39;re more likely to get a head injuring from tripping in the house and smacking their head on the coffee table.<br/>
<br/>
After an exhausting bike ride my husband misjudged the turn into the parking lot next to our house and took a header off his bike. The helmet saved his life.<br/>
<br/>
People in Netherlands can log thousands of helmetless hours on their bikes riding on city roads that favor bike riders with few injuries. But in America the bike-unfriendly roads and the cars who own them greatly increase the danger of a head-damaging injury.<br/>
<br/>
I think what will help is supporting kids in making thoughtful decisions based on what they&#39;re doing rather than obeying an inflexible rule. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-379500213">My sister.was 17 and training for the Olympics as a velodrome racer. Her and my father were in the bike lane on the road, with helmets, when a car struck my sisters rear tire. She went down and hit her head on the curb. Not a dent in the helmet but she still ended up brain dead. 

I&#39;ve never required my kids to wear helmets when riding, even though it&#39;s the law. I&#39;ve told them of the law and the consequences of breaking the law. There will be a ticket issued and they may get a call home or their bikes impounded.  They choose to wear helmets only when biking along the major roads in town. They do not wear them skating, while riding their scooters or skateboards. It&#39;s not even required even at the local skating rink.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1274413363"><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0"><tr><td valign="top">My son is young ( 6 in August) so maybe my experience is limited. But wearing a helmet for biking or skiing is handled in our house similarly to other decisions - according to unschooling principles. Who says that there needs to be an either  &quot; do what ever you want&quot; or a &quot;without helmet no bike&quot; kind of attitude ?<br/><br/>My husband and I are wearing helmets and are explaining why. I am in the medical field, have seen many, many devastating head injuries to prior perfectly healthy people ( some wearing helmets, most without) and for myself wearing a helmet is not bothersome enough to risk being neurologically hurt. I feel the same about seat belts. They do safe lives and while they don&#39;t guarantee me not to be killed by something (I still could get cancer, be hit by a car as a pedestrian, be shot, and many more possibilities) they lower the risk of being ejected from my car in an
 accident. It&#39;s a simple risk/benefit analysis - which might be different for different people or activities. <br/>Lukas has always seen us wearing helmets while biking and skiing, he chose his own helmet (he had very specific ideas how it needed to look like ), we had discussions why I wear a helmet (matter of fact, not driven by fear) and when he forgets to put his on I will say something along the lines of &quot;hey, you forgot your helmet - let me get it for you&quot;. He decorated his bike and ski helmet with his favorite stickers and wearing them seems not to bother him. He has forgotten to put his helmet on but if I make it easy to wear the helmet he has not chosen to not wear it.<br/><br/>This discussion picks up in some ways the recent threat about teeth brushing. In my experience teeth brushing has health benefits. The benefits are bigger than the inconvenience to me. My husband and I brush our teeth regularly and my son joins us the same way he joins us
 in other things we do. We try to make it fun and &quot;just another thing we do&quot; without drama when it doesn&#39;t happen once in a while. When my son was little he loved for me to find wild animals in his mouth. Now at almost 6 he still wants me to brush his teeth - and I enjoy doing it since it has almost gotten to the status of a little love ritual.<br/><br/>I brought the teeth brushing up again since I think both situations (helmets and teeth brushing) become a problem if they turn into an all or nothing situation, if they are handled inflexible or as some kind of parent enforced law. Granted my son is young and things might change, but making healthy choices easy and fun, walking my talk and having honest, unemotional discussion has helped us a lot. Not letting my fear of what could happen if he doesn&#39;t (brush his teeth, wear a helmet, get enough sleep, stop climbing up this tree, ......) cloud my approach of these situations seems to have helped to make
 them just another opportunity to help my son to make thoughtful decisions rather than a confrontation. <br/><br/>Oh, and one more thing. The argument &quot;I used to ..... as a child and I turned out fine&quot; seems weak on this kind of list. We all survived all kinds of suboptimal situations as children and are obviously still alive. What I love about this list is that we all try to make the lives of our children better and not just survivable.....<br/><br/>Sabine<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://overview.mail.yahoo.com?.src=iOS"><br/><br/>Sent from Yahoo Mail for iPad</a></td></tr></table>            <div id="ygrps-yiv-1274413363_origMsg_">

<div id="ygrps-yiv-204970703">I agree about bike riding being dangerous.&nbsp; But so is walking across the street, or in my case going down stairs. <br><br>I don&#39;t feel that wearing helmets riding up and down our residential street is an issue.&nbsp; They either wear them or don&#39;t. They do wear them when they are riding along the highway where there is more distraction with lots of activity of cars and people and things to see.<br><br>Sandra, as for the Olympics, my sister really wanted this. Yes, it was a lot of work and expensive and took almost all her spare time, but she really loved it.&nbsp; She ended up getting sponsors that paid for her gear, etc.&nbsp; <br><br>My point is that she was a professional bike rider. She had been racing since she was 12.&nbsp; Used to distractions and other riders riding so close it would be so easy to fall. Used to riding busy streets for training. Wore all the right safety gear and in the end it did not matter.&nbsp; She died doing something she loved. I don&#39;t think I could ask for anything more, except of course that she survived and was able to pursue her dreams.<br><br>I do encourage bike safety, trampoline safety, walking across the street safety, etc. but not to the point where it hinders the fun of the moment.&nbsp; <br><br>My kids tend to be more cautious.&nbsp; They are armed with knowledge. I see that if they are doing tricks or trying new things they tend to put their helmets on.&nbsp; We have a friend where his mom insists he wears his helmet when biking or skating.&nbsp; His knickname is Evil Knievel.&nbsp; He is a risk taker and loves thrill.&nbsp; He has the broken bone, sprains and stitches to prove it.&nbsp; But that is what he craves and loves.<br><br>~Jen</div>
