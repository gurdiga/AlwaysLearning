&lt;&lt;&lt;There is a parenting aspect apart from the unschooling  aspect. To say <br/>
it&#39;s unschooling to let a toddler nap whenever he wants to  doesn&#39;t <br/>
really make sense to me.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t seem to be able to separate the parenting aspect from  the <br/>
unschooling aspect. I had no concept of letting a toddler nap whenever he  wants to <br/>
before unschooling. Nor breastfeeding when the baby wants to. Little  <br/>
understanding that a child would eat what he needs and stop when he is full,  regardless <br/>
of how &quot;good for him&quot; a certain food was. I really had very little  *true* <br/>
understanding of balance. Or trust, for that matter. Or really, even  partnership. <br/>
To me, all these things are part and parcel of unschooling. I don&#39;t  know how <br/>
to separate them out, and really, I don&#39;t think I have the motivation  or <br/>
desire to do so. Unschooling brought me to trust, balance and partnership and  <br/>
I&#39;m pretty darned sure I wouldn&#39;t have found them (or peace and  this dimension <br/>
of joy!) without it.<br/>
 <br/>
It seems I can&#39;t find a way to make unschooling autonomous  from parenting! <br/>

I agree.  I think attachment parenting has so many varied definitions, depending on where you look for information.  I also feel like following your child&#39;s cues/needs in terms of what to eat, when to sleep, how to help them when they are upset, etc. gets fuzzier (at least in the ap circles I&#39;m in) when it comes to toddlerhood.  I&#39;ve personally found the philosophies/ideas of unschooling very helpful in my day to day life with my toddler.  I also feel like coming to unschooling while he is so young (under 2) is preventing me from needing to let go or undo of some of my school think/talk from my old life as a &#39;student&#39; and &#39;teacher&#39; later on (I &#39;taught&#39; for 5 years).  I&#39;ve been able to begin my deschooling process much earlier, which has been amazingly helpful in my journey as a mother (and wife, and person in general!)<br/>
<br/>
Actually, once I felt like I started to *get* what unschooling was all about, I realized that it does seem like a natural progression of the basic principles of attachment parenting, as I&#39;ve interpereted them.  But I needed to come in the &#39;back door&#39; in order to see this!  Finding unschooling now, in early parenthood, has been invaluable to me, and I&#39;m so grateful for all the lists I&#39;m on, those that focus on the little ones and the older children as well...<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s always made sense to me, too, once I put the two of them together.  I<br/>
came to unschooling at that toddler stage, when it seemed all the other<br/>
&quot;attached&quot; moms were becoming &quot;mean&quot; to their babes of yesterday.  I didn&#39;t<br/>
want to move to that &quot;school&quot; stage yet and I wasn&#39;t sure how to fill that<br/>
vacuum.  The unschoolers were the folks who showed me the Joy of enjoying<br/>
childhood :) The principles are the same for folks 2 - 237; that made a lot<br/>
more sense than some arbitrary forced separation date.<br/>
