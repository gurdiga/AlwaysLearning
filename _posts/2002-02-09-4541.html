 </span></blockquote>This is pretty personal, but I felt like sharing. <br/>
It&#39;s not a secret or anything, just not something a<br/>
lot of people know about me now.  My elder son is not<br/>
my husband&#39;s biological child, although we married<br/>
before he was born.  Having grown up in an abusive<br/>
home and environment, I unconsciously sought out those<br/>
types of relationships as an adult also.  The last<br/>
relationship I had with a man before my husband was<br/>
4.5 years living with an extremely abusive and<br/>
unbalanced addicted person.  He was physically and<br/>
psychologically abusive and HAD cut off most of my<br/>
contacts with others, driving my friends away one by<br/>
one, controlling my time, taking my money, even taking<br/>
my car overnight to keep me from going places.  He was<br/>
a lot like my dad unfortunately.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, the final straw came for me when I<br/>
acidentally got pregnant after 4.5 years.  I tried for<br/>
a couple of months to get him interested in the baby,<br/>
but he always said the same things: &quot;Get rid of it. <br/>
You&#39;ll be a rotten mother.&quot; and other scarier things<br/>
about what he would teach a child about the world and<br/>
how he would teach these things.  I finally got<br/>
terrified of having this person around my child, MY<br/>
CHILD, and realized I would never allow someone like<br/>
him near my child (let alone parent them) in any other<br/>
situation.  <br/>
<br/>
SO I decided to leave.  I told him that whatever I<br/>
decided to do was none of his business, since he had<br/>
already made it abundantly clear what his feelings<br/>
were about it.  He didn&#39;t care anyway.  But I was<br/>
terrified to go bak to the house and pack up my<br/>
furniture and things alone.  I could usually trust him<br/>
not to touch me if I had witnesses (abusers usually<br/>
want everyone else to think they are wonderful<br/>
people.)  I asked a couple of co-workers if they could<br/>
help me get my things.  One in particular was an over<br/>
6 foot tall Engineer whom I had worked with for over 2<br/>
and a half years and was a good work pal who shared<br/>
the same friends at work as I.  <br/>
<br/>
Yup...that was my husband.  We began to see each other<br/>
a couple of months after that, and knowing each other<br/>
so well already things progressed quickly.  We decided<br/>
to have a small, very romantic, private ceremony on<br/>
San Juan Island in the Puget sound and his name is on<br/>
our son&#39;s birth certificate.  I kept photos of my ex<br/>
so that my son can have them when he is older and I<br/>
fully intend to tell him his story (how do I broach<br/>
that subject????.)  My husband was really, REALLY<br/>
excited about me being pregnant and very involved in<br/>
my pregnancy.  His ex wife had two children and he was<br/>
VERY ready to be a daddy.  Both my sons adore their<br/>
daddy, the best daddy in the world.  And I am so<br/>
thankful for the blessing of my older boy, coming when<br/>
he did, and knocking some sense into me to get me away<br/>
from where I was.<br/>
