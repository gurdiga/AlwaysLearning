Discovering another way of looking at what I am doing. While I am not<br/>
directing my son toward success, the small things he does pave the way for<br/>
doing larger things. What they are doesn&#39;t matter as long as they are what<br/>
he wanted to do. It is the foundation of success rather than a topical fix.<br/>
Success wasn&#39;t really on my radar that unschooling principles would<br/>
naturally create an tendency for it and I wasn&#39;t concerned. These lines give<br/>
me  a better understanding of how unschooling works in creating capable<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
This clarity is welcome as we begin talking about unschooling in our family<br/>
and success is bound to be a big concern. Our family is very success<br/>
oriented. It is going to matter whether he is &#39;successful&#39; and I was<br/>
wondering how I can reassure them that unschooline will only empower him to<br/>
achieve something he finds value in. I had been worried about how to address<br/>
concerns beyond &quot;I feel certain that it won&#39;t be a problem&quot; - does nothing<br/>
to help people arrive at that reassuring certainty. This insight into the<br/>
process will help me to articulate it as I understand it so that we can all<br/>
examine and talk about it.<br/>

What about the courage and skill to stop doing something that is no  <br/>
longer rewarding or interesting, though?  If I decide halfway through  <br/>
a project that it&#39;s not a great use of my time and money and energy, I  <br/>
don&#39;t want to feel that that makes me &quot;unsuccessful&quot; (or &quot;failure).<br/>
<br/>
I grew up that way, with &quot;you have to finish what you start,&quot; but the  <br/>
effect of that can be that people stop starting anything.<br/>
<br/>
In the process-vs.-product way of thinking, some people want to have  <br/>
hands-on knowledge of masonry, so working at it a few hours on someone  <br/>
else&#39;s project is success, even if they didn&#39;t start or finish the  <br/>
wall.   I have a long-unfinished quilt.  I inherited an unfinished  <br/>
quilt from my grandmother.  She made LOTS of finished quilts.  I&#39;ve  <br/>
never finished one.  I did help with one of hers.  I set out to learn  <br/>
more about quilts, so I feel successful.  But I also set out to make a  <br/>
quilt, and didn&#39;t finish.<br/>
<br/>
I would hate to see unschoolers pressuring kids to finish a Lego  <br/>
session or a poem just because he had started one.<br/>

This is a big reason I like to do things myself that Karl has expressed an<br/>
interest in even though he doesn&#39;t dive right in and do it for himself. He&#39;s<br/>
the kind of kid who (like I do myself) observes for a long while before<br/>
diving in. He benefits (and feeds off the success of being involved in<br/>
something someone else is doing). Some people learn a lot very easily that<br/>
way. Depends what it is. Other things he wants to do all by himself, even if<br/>
he doesn&#39;t know how to.<br/>
<br/>
When we first started playing with Legos, Karl always wanted me to do the<br/>
assembly and now even tho he still wants me to do the initial assemblying,<br/>
he takes it apart in areas and remakes it his way. I have grown to like<br/>
Legos a lot more than I started out liking to and now Karl and I have<br/>
something we enjoy sharing together. We spent hours yesterday building and<br/>
playing with a new conglomeration.<br/>

Yiiikes!!! That would be bad :D &quot;lego your way to success in life (or else)&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think its about completing everything so much as having an<br/>
experience of achieving what was desired (including the scrapping of<br/>
projects no more desirable). Doesn&#39;t need to be the only kind of experience<br/>
as long as its there to draw on, I think. Don&#39;t think it needs doing as long<br/>
as a child is free do stuff that can grow in magnitude with his/her desires.<br/>
