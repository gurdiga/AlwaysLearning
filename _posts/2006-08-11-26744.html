<div id="ygrps-yiv-2071372197">Hi there, I&#39;m Kerrie, crunchy mama to 9.5 month old Eli. Obviously <br/>
we&#39;re already learning at home, and plan on that flowing continuously <br/>
into Eli&#39;s older years. School isn&#39;t for us. I have a background in <br/>
Montessori, but after recently looking into Waldorf there are aspects <br/>
which really appeal to me there too so I&#39;ll be providing a little of <br/>
both flavours at home without things being overly structured. We&#39;re <br/>
from the Blue Mountains in Australia. Look forward to &#39;meeting&#39; you <br/>
all! Thanks.</div>
