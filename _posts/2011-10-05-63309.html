<div id="ygrps-yiv-1860415199">Class Dismissed is a film about learning outside a classroom - the director, Jeremy Stuart is an unschooling dad here in California, who has done other documentaries. Sandra and Kirby Dodd are already in the film along with some other unschoolers. The film isn&#39;t complete yet - they still have a long way to go because they want to select a family to be sort of the centerpiece. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, they showed what they&#39;ve got so far at the August HSC conference and the September Good Vibrations conference and it really looks like it is going to be a wonderful film. They are doing fundraising for it - and NHEN (National Home Education Network) has just given them a $5,000 matching grant - meaning NHEN will give them a dollar for every dollar contributed (up to $5,000). <br/>
<br/>
You can see a short trailer and get more information about the film on their website:<br/>

<br/>
If you think your family would make a great centerpiece for the film and you&#39;re willing to be followed around by a guy with a camera &lt;g&gt;, you might want to let Jeremy know. I&#39;m confident that it will be a good outcome, unlike some of the commercial tv programs where they edit the footage to make unschoolers look bad. The film is about learning outside a classroom and explores how that learning can take place in a wide variety of ways, including unschooling. It will be really nice to see a film made by someone who really gets unschooling.  <br/>

They want a family that&#39;s new to unschooling, in the process of deciding, right Pam?  (Maybe one of those and a more experienced family too?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-30152087">We&#39;ll see - it isn&#39;t clear to me that they will ever be able to find a family willing to be in the film if they are just starting out. <br/>
