<div id="ygrps-yiv-437943108">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Your discussion of how bright and fresh the kids that don&#39;t go to school are <br/>
reminded me of what happened last night.  My daughter, Donika (soon to be 19 <br/>
-has only gone to college) just started taking a &quot;full&quot; load at Grossmont <br/>
Community college.  She has taken some classes there since she was 15 - <br/>
mostly dance- as a high school student.  Anyway, we went to a Romanian dance <br/>
workshop where we often dance.  At the potluck dinner some friends were <br/>
asking her about school.  She was telling them what she was taking.<br/>
<br/>
One man didn&#39;t know she had never gone to &quot;regular&quot; school.  I said that she <br/>
had shared with me that during one of the first lectures in astronomy, the <br/>
teacher said he was going to tell an interesting story, and then did.  She <br/>
said &quot;I was nodding and agreeing with him, and then I looked around and so <br/>
many of the kids looked bored, and one even said, what&#39;s interesting about <br/>
that?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I told her that when her oldest brother started college classes, he came home <br/>
and said &quot;I feel so FRESH.  The other kids have been doing this for so many <br/>
years, they don&#39;t think it is fun or interesting.&quot;  She agreed that that <br/>
expressed exactly how she felt.<br/>
<br/>
The man last night went on to say that it is because of the &quot;lower&quot; level of <br/>
student at community colleges -- ditto the professors, etc, etc.  Of course <br/>
he doesn&#39;t know I know he has his only daughter in a boarding school <br/>
(expensive!) on the east coast.  (We live in CA.)  His daughter is only 13 - <br/>
and when I last saw her she told me she HATED her school.<br/>
<br/>
I just dropped the whole subject.  I love my &quot;fresh&quot; children - and having <br/>
them in my life regularly too!!  We each make our own choices.<br/>
