<div id="ygrps-yiv-780715549">Hi Kelly.  Just wanted to check and see how you&#39;re doing with the <br/>
conference.  I had a fun thought inspired by a thread from <br/>
Unschooling.com of something I could do but I&#39;ll need to know about how <br/>
many people will be coming.  What I&#39;d like to do is this:  dragonfly, <br/>
Sandra, and Anne have talked about the poem &quot;Children Learn What They <br/>
Live and I&#39;d like to print up a copy for everyone at the conference to <br/>
keep.  It&#39;s not really much but it&#39;s a little something that everyone <br/>
can take home.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I&#39;ve decided to get Joe (our dog) professionally stripped since I <br/>
can&#39;t seem to get him finished. Can you give me any tips on how to find <br/>
someone who&#39;ll do a good job?<br/>
<br/>
Aislinn sends a &quot;Hello&quot; to Duncan.  She&#39;s very excited because 2 weeks <br/>
ago, she officially began swimming w/out her swimmy wings.  Ever since <br/>
she heard about your party, it&#39;s become very important to her.<br/>
<br/>
Hope all is going well...and congratulations on getting your house <br/>
painted.   Heidi Case</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-140345911">Sorry everybody.  I ment to send that to Kelly, not the whole group.  I <br/>
sometimes get a little flustered when trying to send e-mail while doing <br/>
3 other things at the same time.  Sorry about that.  Heidi<br/>
