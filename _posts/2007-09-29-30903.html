  &lt;&lt;Nuts - every sauteed raw almonds with a little butter and cinnamon?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
is inaccurate. If nuts are &quot;sauteed&quot; they are no longer &quot;raw&quot;. <br/>

  Uh, to point out the obvious (imo)...<br/>
  I believe she&#39;s saying you START with raw almonds. She&#39;s not claiming they&#39;re still raw after you sautee them.<br/>
  Sometimes it&#39;s great to slow down and reread some of the posts. I notice lately a lot of people are jumping to conclusions very quickly without fully reading or understanding what the poster is saying. If it&#39;s not clear to you, maybe it would help to ask the poster to clarify before jumping to conclusions. Just my .02 cents :-)<br/>
