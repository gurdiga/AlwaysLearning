Thank you for that! I have been feeling negatively about not  reading for <br/>
enjoyment since I was pregnant with Wyl 10 years ago. You&#39;re  right-there are <br/>
just too many other interesting things to do. Now I will look  with joy at my <br/>
stack of books I&#39;ve been collecting for &quot;when I have time&quot;,  instead of regret <br/>
and a sense of &quot;missing out&quot;. Very cool. Why I couldn&#39;t grasp  that from my kids <br/>
who are *very* good at looking forward in joy than back in  loss, I don&#39;t <br/>
know...<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;HELP him play what he wants and make it nicer for him. Take  him <br/>
food, help make him comfortable, buy him manuals, keep an eye out for  <br/>
sales on games or expansion packs. Get him good gaming  equipment.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
There are also magazine subscriptions-some with a general,  across-the-genre <br/>
type format and others that are more specific to one  system/company. There <br/>
are related clothing and toys: there are t-shirts and  costumes, plushies <br/>
(stuffed animals), &quot;action figures&quot;, mini figures, giant  plushies, card decks, <br/>
watches, carrying cases of all styles in colors in  favorite characters, t.v. <br/>
shows and movies based on game series, board games,  key chains, cereals, fruit <br/>
snacks, dishes and cups... I could go on and on. Not  to say you should get <br/>
*everything* they make for him, but that there is a huge  variety not only in <br/>
things he might like but also price. We have fun just going  into a game store or <br/>
the electronics section of a store and seeing all the cool  things they have <br/>
there. We probably draw some attention, the four of us standing  there pointing <br/>
and calling to each other, &quot;Look at THIS!&quot; and squealing, &quot;Oh,  how COOL!&quot;. <br/>
We sometimes put things on lists, but just looking is so much fun-it  is <br/>
amazing the ideas the companies come up with.<br/>
 <br/>
Peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1227050262">After being a fiction &quot;bookworm&quot; my whole life, I stopped reading  <br/>
fiction pretty much altogether after I had my first child. For about  <br/>
20 years, until about 4 years ago, I read nearly every single  <br/>
parenting book published and a lot of books about education and  <br/>
learning. Then I got an audible.com subscription and started listening  <br/>
to books on an ipod. Now I listen to at least one very long book per  <br/>
month on my ipod, often more than one. Different times of life, I guess.<br/>

Oh my gosh.  As that list continued I realized there wasn&#39;t a single  <br/>
item on there that we hadn&#39;t had for Kirby for either Ninja Turtles  <br/>
or Mario or Nintendo in general. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Sometimes there are gaming systems or controllers made to match a  <br/>
game.  Halo3  had some.<br/>
<br/>
I think it helps to remember to expand their horizons, not to narrow  <br/>
them.<br/>
