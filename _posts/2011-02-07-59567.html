<div id="ygrps-yiv-1555790557">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I need some advice, and I feel like this needs to be the group of people I<br/>
ask.<br/>
<br/>
We are still fairly new in our unschooling journey, but I feel like we are<br/>
more confidently on our way now that we&#39;ve withdrawn from the public charter<br/>
to which we belonged, and I have a trust in the process that wasn&#39;t there<br/>
previously.   Certainly, there is a sense of peace and assurance about it<br/>
that makes it feel right.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we live in a small town with a reasonably-sized homeschooling<br/>
population, and we belong to our small homeschooling co-op which loosely<br/>
consists of about 50 families, though there is a much, much smaller core<br/>
with which we&#39;ve been a part of for about 3.5 years.  Until about a year<br/>
ago, things were going very well, and I thought that it was about as<br/>
wonderful as it gets.  Within the group was one family with three children<br/>
whose ages were similar to my own three, and for a while, they were best<br/>
friends - the oldests, the middles, and the littles, we called them.  A<br/>
little over a year ago, the oldest two boys had a falling out.  Of sorts.<br/>
Both were in gymnastics (lowest level of competition - Level 4) and the<br/>
other boy shot ahead in ability in one of the events, and seemed to show a<br/>
fair bit of impatience and dismay that the other boys in his level (there<br/>
were only four boys - small town = small gym), including with his own<br/>
brother, who was also in that same group.  With my son (who just turned 12),<br/>
who had previously been his best friend, he got physical a few times -<br/>
pushing him off the mushroom, and otherwise would &quot;growl&quot; or huff under his<br/>
breath when especially my son would try.  From that boy&#39;s point of view, his<br/>
mom said that her son was getting frustrated with my son because he was<br/>
goofing off and acting silly, which was absolutely true at least some of the<br/>
time.  Things fell apart completely during one of the season&#39;s competitions<br/>
(about a year ago) when, during a warm-up, my son wasn&#39;t paying close<br/>
attention and was walking on his hands, and as he came down, his foot hit<br/>
the other boy&#39;s chin.  I won&#39;t defend my son&#39;s carelessness - he&#39;d been<br/>
reminded more than once to pay attention to that sort of thing - but the<br/>
other boy shoved and then punched my son in the stomach.  The coach saw this<br/>
and did nothing except to reprimand my son for not paying close enough<br/>
attention.  He deserved the reprimand, but I still believe that the other<br/>
boy was not justified in his response, and eventually, I pulled all three of<br/>
my children from that gym.  My son said later that the same thing had<br/>
happened in reverse at their home gym during normal practices - the other<br/>
boy had kicked him 2-3 times by accident, and my son would say, &quot;Hey dude,<br/>
watch where you&#39;re going&quot; or something like that, but he did not ever hit<br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
Our playgroup has consisted of about 10 families total, although some are<br/>
less consistent than others.  The oldest group of kids are aged (almost 12)<br/>
to 13, and my son and the other boy are a part of that group.  Of course,<br/>
these kids are entering the age of hormonal changes and sort of becoming<br/>
more aware of their interests and such, so I don&#39;t expect the cohesiveness<br/>
that used to be there, to remain unchanged.  I&#39;d hoped, however, that they<br/>
would retain a basic level of friendship and respect for each other along<br/>
the way.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, one of the moms in this group asked me if my son had found a new<br/>
set of friends...and I&#39;m not sure how to take that.  I&#39;ve asked for some<br/>
clarification, and maybe it was an innocent remark, but for some reason, it<br/>
has made me very sad today.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the playgroup days happen at the other boy&#39;s home, and sometimes it<br/>
seems like my son isn&#39;t really included in the larger group of kids his<br/>
age.  Other times, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case at all.  I will say that<br/>
my son has mentioned that the other kids want to do more talking, and he<br/>
still wants to be outside running around.  Maybe this means he&#39;s a little<br/>
more immature than some of the other kids, and maybe it (also?) means he<br/>
just needs to be more active/physical and craves more outdoor time.  It&#39;s<br/>
probably a combination of the two.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the real problem for me right now:  the mom of this other boy used to<br/>
be what I&#39;d call my best friend.  Things have changed significantly, not<br/>
only because of this but because of some other things, such as disparaging<br/>
comments she&#39;d make about girls in general or my girls in particular.  They<br/>
are a family of yellers, and my older two children have commented that the<br/>
mom and the dad in that family both get mad a lot - I know this is true,<br/>
too, from things I&#39;ve witnessed and things I&#39;ve been told by the mom.  The<br/>
mom has made comments that her oldest son has been having some anger issues<br/>
- I think she described him as being either anxious or angry.  I think the<br/>
mom is actively working on this for her whole family - finding ways to help<br/>
each of them deal with big and little stresses and frustrations, which I<br/>
think really became important to her as she&#39;s witnessed her son&#39;s anger rise<br/>
so quickly to the surface.  If it matters, this is the family who first<br/>
really introduced me to the notion of unschooling - I&#39;d heard of it before,<br/>
but this was the first time I &quot;saw&quot; it.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Although my son is no longer &quot;best friends&quot; (or even good friends) with the<br/>
other boy, my two girls are still very, very close with the two younger sons<br/>
in that family.  For the fourth or fifith time in the last 6 weeks, I&#39;ve<br/>
received a request for just my girls to come over to play.  My son no longer<br/>
has a &quot;best friend&quot; or even any real &quot;close&quot; friends, and although he<br/>
understands that his sisters deserve their own friendships, it hurts me to<br/>
know that these invitations specifically exclude him and that that knowledge<br/>
hurts his feelings.  He doesn&#39;t want to be included in these invites (he&#39;d<br/>
still be willing to &quot;play&quot; with the other boy, but I suppose it&#39;s a one-way<br/>
street), but they do underscore the situation - that he&#39;s NOT getting any<br/>
invites.  Moreover, he doesn&#39;t seem to want to participate in situations<br/>
where he might meet other kids, so we&#39;re in a bit of a rut.  He misses<br/>
having a close friend, and as a fellow introvert - and as someone who misses<br/>
the friendship I used to have with the mom mentioned above - I understand<br/>
and grieve with him.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want my girls or the other two little boys in all of this to suffer<br/>
because of what&#39;s happened with the big boys or the moms, but I&#39;m having a<br/>
hard time accepting these requests.  I&#39;ve loved this mom and her boys, but I<br/>
don&#39;t see things changing.  I bear no enmity toward this mom (or her son),<br/>
but in my heart, I know that for my own comfort level, I need to maintain a<br/>
greater (emotional) distance between *us* than what we once had.  I don&#39;t<br/>
mind the children playing, but I do mind watching my son bear the burden of<br/>
a lost friendship while his sisters go off and play in a home where he&#39;s not<br/>
really welcome.<br/>
<br/>
To my knowledge, there are no other playgroups for homeschooled kids his age<br/>
(most seem to return to public school around middle school age).   I&#39;m at a<br/>
loss as to how to handle this and would welcome the advice of those who<br/>
might look at this from perspectives I&#39;ve not considered.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance,<br/>
Natalie<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-907091642">Hi Natalie,<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been thinking over your situation this morning.  I am really feeling for your your son.  What isn&#39;t sitting right for me is that, in this case,  I think that the relationships in your own family should trump outside friendships.  From how you are describing this former friend of yours and her older son, I personally wouldn&#39;t want to waste my life and time knowing them.  <br/>
<br/>
To be fair for your daughters and son, I would begin to move forward.  Make the other family less appealing by meeting new people.  Look for unschoolers.  Look for people who don&#39;t approach homeschool clubs and activities in such a schoolish fashion.  Let go of thinking about age groups.  Just set it up so that the kids can form relationships.  Think outside the homeschooling box.  <br/>
<br/>
I live in a small town too.... I know that homeschool groups can be stifling.   I saw this happening and made my own group.  As it turned out, there were others out there just like us.  We dropped the group mentality and are now just a bunch of friends. The kids are all different ages, cultures and beliefs and don&#39;t seem to divide up according to anything except personal interests.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope this helps.<br/>
<br/>
Mel<br/>
