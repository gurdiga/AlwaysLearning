<div id="ygrps-yiv-937127284">Happy 2005 everyone!<br/>
<br/>
it has been a long time since my hubby or I have posted.<br/>
<br/>
We are unschoolers in a small town in Ohio. Our son is 10 and has never been<br/>
to school. At about our third year of having to notify the local school, I<br/>
came across Always Learning - WOW! love you all! you have all helped me<br/>
through quite a few stressful times, thanks for all your wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
If anyone is interested in wolves, we found an interesting site:<br/>
International Wolf Center  www.wolf.org very cool, it has 3 cameras that<br/>
they refresh every minute to see the wolves on the compound. We adopted one<br/>
of the older wolves, so our son is very excited about that. All I know about<br/>
the facility is what is on the website.<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to respond to the Halo 2 thread because we enjoy online gaming and<br/>
my husband and son just started playing Halo 2 online.  They&#39;d love to play<br/>
with other unschoolers, since the general open areas seem to have a sizable<br/>
contingent of people that are not very nice, to say the least.  My hubby and<br/>
I also play Everquest, Ayonae Ro server, we&#39;d love to hear from anyone that<br/>
would want to play with us there.<br/>
<br/>
Well, happy new year to all!<br/>
<br/>

My kids are quite older (18, nearly 16) and have a batch of regular older <br/>
players (they&#39;re among the youngest), and I&#39;m afraid they might be on the &quot;not <br/>
very nice&quot; end if by that you mean they don&#39;t watch their language.  But I hope <br/>
there are younger kids here you might hook up with!<br/>
