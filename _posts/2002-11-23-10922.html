<div id="ygrps-yiv-461139293">From Jeffery Kacirk&#39;s Forgotten English calendar:<br/>
<br/>
Duffers:<br/>
The sellers of sham sovereigns and sham gold rings for wagers.  The<br/>
duffer in English birds disguises them so that they shall look like<br/>
foreigners...Among the swag-shopkeepers, at one place in Houndsitch more<br/>
especially, are dealers in &quot;duffing-fiddles&quot;.   These are German-made<br/>
instruments, and are sold to the street-folk at two shillings, sixpence,<br/>
or three shillings, bow and all.   Then purchased by the music-duffers,<br/>
they are discoloured so as to be made to look old.  A music-duffer,<br/>
assuming the way of a man half-drunk, will enter a public-house, or<br/>
accost any party in the street, saying  &quot;It cost me two guineas and<br/>
another fiddle... but I may as well be my own broker, for I must have<br/>
money anyhow, and I&#39;ll sell it for ten shillings.&quot;  <br/>
--Henry Mayhew&#39;s &quot;London Labour and the London Poor,&quot; 1851<br/>
<br/>
Friday 22 November:<br/>
Feast day of St. Cecilia, a patroness of musicians.  It was believed that<br/>
angels returned to Earth to listen to her play music. <br/>
