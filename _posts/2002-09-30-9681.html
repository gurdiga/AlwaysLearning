<div id="ygrps-yiv-1602069217">Hi All:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I had some revelations this weekend that is helping me deschool myself more.<br/>
Zak decided to make books, so he drew the pictures and I wrote down the<br/>
story he told me.  We stapled them, but a back and front cover on it and it<br/>
looked wonderful.  He loved it so much that he made 2 more.  He&#39;s decided<br/>
he&#39;s going to sell books.  He even put $4 on the back of his book.  Do I<br/>
have a little entrepenaur like me in my house?  This has led to us talking<br/>
about the very first printed book in China and talking about when you can<br/>
read more then you can go and investigate further.  He seemed to like this<br/>
idea.  The benefit of seeing what&#39;s going on with him now is that some of my<br/>
fears are going away about unschooling.  I guess it takes a while to really,<br/>
really settle into this and be ok with what we are doing.  I also noticed<br/>
how much easier it is when I don&#39;t try to control the situation.  If we are<br/>
going swimming and they get sidetracked on the way because they are in the<br/>
middle of something still, then I just wait.  I used to spend an awful lot<br/>
of my energy getting them to places at the last minute when they are not<br/>
those type of kids.  So instead of them changing I&#39;ve finally decided it&#39;s<br/>
me that has to change.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks ladies for letting me learn for you who have been doing this for so<br/>
long.<br/>
