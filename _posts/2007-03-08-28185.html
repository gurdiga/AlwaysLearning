<div id="ygrps-yiv-1188369620">I was just telling the gals at park day that I have been going through old journals for the past 2 weeks and was going to put several passages on my blog we older pictures.  It&#39;s fascinating stuff.  I have personal journals & poetry since the age of 9 and it completely freaks me out how &#39;radically&#39; different my life as a 9-year-old was then Sorscha&#39;s is now. I have really been enjoying the passages from our first months being RUers.  What I have not enjoyed reading is from about the age of 16 to 23 (scary times) , except the separate journal I have about Dave & me.  It&#39;s so cool how I was mesmerized by him from the beginning...and look 20 years later I still am.    <br/>
<br/>
I have realized one very interesting tidbit of information about my relationship with Sorscha.  In looking back on the first three years of her life I absolutely embraced &#39;everything&#39; she was.  I knew she was whole, complete, and amazing from the moment I set eyes on her.  The sad part is that somewhere around the age of 3 1/2 I let pressures from family and Mom&#39;s Clubs, etc. change that view.  I became scared for her future and altered our path for about 3 1/2 years (real bummer to read all that). Anyhow, then the journals take me forward to around Sorscha&#39;s age of 7 1/2 where I scream at the world, &quot;NO MORE.&quot; and we make our radical transformation back into the original world we started from.  Neat stuff.<br/>
