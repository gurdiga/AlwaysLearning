<div id="ygrps-yiv-823780621">&lt;&lt;Wow. So strange to be reading this today because I had a similar train of<br/>
thought yesterday--I was cleaning house and had certain things I wanted done<br/>
before people came over. There wasn&#39;t time to do it all, and I had a little<br/>
conversation<br/>
going in my head where someone was being critical (faceless someone,<br/>
certainly wasn&#39;t anyone who was coming over) and I was thinking, &quot;Don&#39;t look<br/>
at what I *haven&#39;t* done--look at all I *have* done!&quot; I was talking to<br/>
myself, I guess.<br/>
<br/>
And then it struck me to ponder how often I might&#39;ve done that to my<br/>
kids--looked more at what they hadn&#39;t done than what they had. Or times I&#39;ve<br/>
done it to my husband, or my parents, or anyone. It&#39;s a good thing to be<br/>
thinking about,<br/>
so that I can be thankful, interested, and appreciative, not critical.<br/>

LOL - I&#39;m feeling like that right now. The kids&#39; bedrooms are a mess, no<br/>
dinner is made yet. I need to get ready for work tomorrow and get two of<br/>
the kids ready for school. It&#39;s already 5:51 pm...and my mind is going and<br/>
going. Clearly I need to get back to meditating.<br/>
<br/>
be at peace,<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-61720377">Hi,<br/>
I can&#39;t find the rest of the thread just your response,(and am not<br/>
technical enough to find it) but your response has struck a chord with<br/>
me and I too have these negative thoughts and look at all the things I<br/>
haven&#39;t accomplished instead of what I have.  I too have that<br/>
&quot;faceless critical voice&quot;, but am learning to block it out more as I<br/>
realise that i can&#39;t be everything and achieve all I need to achieve<br/>
in one day.  I am guilty of doing it to children and hubby too.  thanq<br/>
for not making me feel alone :-)<br/>
