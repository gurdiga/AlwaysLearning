<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I went to a Celtic Festival in Grass Valley this past weekend.  It <br/>
&gt; was WONDERFUL!  My friend and I also explored the Grass <br/>
&gt; Valley/Nevada City area.  I LOVE it!  I really felt as though I had <br/>
&gt; &#39;come home&#39;.  I am going to work on moving there within the next <br/>
&gt; year.  <br/>
&gt; I have felt restless and unsatisfied (a bit like always having one <br/>
&gt; foot out the door) this past year living here in Paradise.  I have <br/>
&gt; met very few unschoolers (2 to be exact, and one of those is in <br/>
&gt; Chico) and not a decent single man in sight &lt;g&gt;.<br/>
&gt; I found the people there to be friendly and welcoming.  There is a <br/>
&gt; lot of &#39;alternative&#39; stuff going on (medicine, enviromentalism, <br/>
&gt; music, spirituality, etc.), that I am interested in.  I didn&#39;t feel like a <br/>
&gt; round peg in a square hole for the first time in a year.<br/>
&gt; Apparently there are a large number of, &#39;not for religious <br/>
&gt; reasons&#39;, homeschoolers and unschoolers in the area (I&#39;m <br/>
&gt; going to research that one to check on it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>

 </span></blockquote>When we first got married, my husband was stationed at Beale AFB. We spent A <br/>
LOT of time in Grass Valley and Nevada City. Great little shops and <br/>
restaurants. Is Posh Nosh or the Art &quot;C&quot; Bistro still there? We really miss <br/>
those towns. A bit of sanity right next door to the air base!<br/>
