<div id="ygrps-yiv-266159782">A friend (and former Jr. high student) of mine sent me a piece of  <br/>
humor with this bit:<br/>
<br/>
* Law of Logical Argument � Anything is possible if you don&#39;t know  <br/>
what you are talking about.<br/>
<br/>
=============================================================<br/>
That seems to cover a lot of the misunderstandings about  <br/>
unschooling.  When people insist that unschooling is anything they  <br/>
want it to be, then they do what they want and blame unschooling for  <br/>
what doesn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of really figuring out what successful unschooling families  <br/>
have done, they assure me (and others) that we don&#39;t own unschooling  <br/>
and can&#39;t tell them whether they are or aren&#39;t unschooling, and then  <br/>
proceed to make a big mess.<br/>
<br/>
A mom who assured me that there ARE happy and successful unschooling  <br/>
families who don&#39;t go the way of allowing more freedom around food,  <br/>
chores, etc. has a child who has posted on MySpace that she hates her  <br/>
family and can&#39;t wait to grow up and move away on her own.    So I  <br/>
could be wrong, and I don&#39;t own unschooling, but I have three kids  <br/>
older than that one who are NOT in a hurry to leave home, who love  <br/>
their family.<br/>
<br/>
And yet it&#39;s possible to go to far and not model good behavior.<br/>

I love that I can share a little quote or thought with my daughter and <br/>
she understands what I&#39;m talking about, and even enjoys talking about <br/>
it with me.  It&#39;s awesome awesome awesome!  A lot of kids her age would <br/>
never carry on a conversation with one of their parents, let alone a <br/>
thoughtful one.</div>

taken out), I was dropping him off one day and there was a mother<br/>
there whose daughter was reluctant to go into the classroom. So the<br/>
mother said to her in all seriousness &quot;You have to go to school or you<br/>
won&#39;t learn anything&quot;. Imagine if you will the scene from Home Alone<br/>
when McCauley Culkin puts the aftershave on his face as I&#39;m standing<br/>
there overhearing this nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
There are so many people in this world who need to be educated about<br/>
education!<br/>
