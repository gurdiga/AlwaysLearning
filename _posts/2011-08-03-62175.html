<div id="ygrps-yiv-2034138568">Bonjour Robin,<br/>
<br/>
My daughter is very much into Pokemon and I suspect she would love to<br/>
explore online pokemon roleplaying. Would you be willing to share some info<br/>
on the game?<br/>
<br/>
Regards<br/>
Claire<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I object to the use of the term &quot;screen time&quot; because it discounts<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; demeans what the person is actually doing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I agree. It&#39;s an easy catch-all term with not much thought behind it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; People talk as if being &quot;outside&quot; doing absolutely anything is better<br/>
&gt; &gt; than having &quot;screen time.&quot; Really? That&#39;s just so obviously lame.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If I insisted that Senna &quot;get outside&quot; instead of being at her<br/>
&gt; computer right now, I&#39;d be stopping her from doing something really<br/>
&gt; nice for her Pokemon friends. Some of them are having birthdays around<br/>
&gt; this time, so she&#39;s drawing pictures of their favorite Pokemon as<br/>
&gt; gifts. She&#39;s also planning out a &quot;group photo&quot; of the Pokemon<br/>
&gt; roleplayers&#39;s characters to celebrate the first anniversary of the<br/>
&gt; (online) roleplay&#39;s beginning. She&#39;s arranging them by color dots at<br/>
&gt; the moment, to balance out the similar colors in the picture before<br/>
&gt; she goes ahead to actually sketch out each character.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would be interrupting her creative process by nudging her to go out.<br/>
&gt; I would be interrupting her from forging some important connections<br/>
&gt; with those players, as she thinks about each one of them and their<br/>
&gt; stories for their characters.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But one of the worst things that could happen is she&#39;d resent me and<br/>
&gt; my agenda for her. That wouldn&#39;t help our relationship, at all.<br/>
