<div id="ygrps-yiv-911398502">My kids LOVE playing pretend at 7 and 4 and I am always looking for the plush toys they like to play with.<br/>
This week I got them ( from e-bay) 7 of the Sonic the Hedgehog toys.<br/>
We also have Super Mario, Luigui and some other characters and also a bunch of Pikmin.<br/>
I record Saturday mornings Sonic cartoons and  find Mario cartoons for them.<br/>
Gigi has many dress up clothes , mostly presents or thrift store buys for very little.<br/>
Do you helpo them find great pretend play props and scenarios?<br/>
We gave MD a video camera for making movies with his toys that he uploads to his YouTube channel and he also loves binders and paper to draw stories and make books.<br/>
