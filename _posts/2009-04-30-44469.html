Sandra, the balloon analogy is awesome! It makes so much sense.  <br/>
Thanks!!-=-<br/>
<br/>
And now there&#39;s an example of a post that&#39;s too short.  (WHAT, is that  <br/>
Sandra Dodd never satisfied!? &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the excitement and the reminder, but that&#39;s actually  <br/>
Joyce&#39;s writing so she gets the thanks.  I&#39;ll amend the page to put  <br/>
her name prominently at the beginning of that.<br/>

It&#39;s long or I would just quote it here.   It has to do with fears and  <br/>
choices and the way these kinds of unschooling discussions work.<br/>
