<div id="ygrps-yiv-1244988448"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Please, <br/>
&gt; someone, tell me about bluebirds.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>We get Mountain Bluebirds here in MT, and sometimes (rarely) a Western<br/>
Bluebird.<br/>
Mountain Bluebirds are more turquois than Western Bluebirds.  They never<br/>
come to feeders in town but the country folks put bluebird houses on<br/>
their fence posts and they move right in. The county also has a bluebird<br/>
program and puts up houses for them.   They are revered here for their<br/>
bug eating habits, although  Starlings eat just as many and no one likes<br/>
them (except me).   A family of Starlings  single handedly saved my<br/>
golden willow during a sever infestation of tent caterpillars two years<br/>
ago.  Many of our neighbors lost their trees.  It pays to build a<br/>
Starling house, or two.  <br/>
 <br/>
Not technically  bluebirds, we get Lazuli Buntings here at our feeders in<br/>
the summer and noisy  Blue Jays.  We also get Stellar&#39;s Jays,  (bluish<br/>
black) who mimic hawks so they can clear all the little birds out of the<br/>
feeders and have them to themselves.  Pretty slick.<br/>
<br/>
I once had a Conure I inherited from my niece.  He was charming,<br/>
affectionate and talkative but would start screaming when the &#39;phone rang<br/>
and continue through out the conversation.   Now I just have a pigeon. <br/>
He has lovely telephone manners but he does pinch. <br/>
