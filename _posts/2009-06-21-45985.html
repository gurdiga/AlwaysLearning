<blockquote><span title="qreply"> &gt;&gt; Something that has rattled around in my head for years is the line,<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;You&#39;re the parent, not their friend.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I was just reading a news article and someone was quoted as saying:<br/>
&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;Your kids don’t need a 40-year-old friend. They need a parent,&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; What a tragic dichotomy that one little line sets up!<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Every single time that line has ever entered my head, it was leading me<br/>
&gt;&gt; in the wrong direction. Every time.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; What is a friend? I&#39;m not talking about the schoolmates teenagers go out<br/>
&gt;&gt; partying and drinking with. Not talking about the 5 year old kid your<br/>
&gt;&gt; child happens to play with at the park that day. I&#39;m talking about real<br/>
&gt;&gt; friendship.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; 1 a*:* one attached to another by affection or esteem<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Knowing what I know now, with my kids grown, I strongly feel that that<br/>
&gt;&gt; that one line, which permeates parental consciousnesses, should be<br/>
&gt;&gt; quickly and actively contradicted and rooted out like a pernicious weed<br/>
&gt;&gt; every single time it sprouts up.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Instead of &quot;You&#39;re the parent, not their friend,&quot; substitute, &quot;Be the<br/>
&gt;&gt; very very best friend to them you can possibly be.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; Do your kids need you to be their &quot;40 year old friend?&quot; YES! Children do<br/>
&gt;&gt; need to feel attached to their parents &quot;by affection or esteem.&quot; What<br/>
&gt;&gt; better connection is there than by affection and esteem?<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; AND, what&#39;s more, parents need their children&#39;s friendship, too. Some<br/>
&gt;&gt; people seem to think there is something wrong with parents &quot;needing&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt; their children. They act like being mutually attached to each other<br/>
&gt;&gt; means children have not become independent enough and parents are being<br/>
&gt;&gt; a &quot;burden to their children.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; A 40 year old friend isn&#39;t going to have the same relationship with a 5<br/>
&gt;&gt; year old as his/her 5 year old friends or 10 year old friends. And<br/>
&gt;&gt; parent-child friendships evolve over the years until they are,<br/>
&gt;&gt; eventually, adult-with-adult friendships.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; There is nothing wrong with wanting to be your child&#39;s friend. Do what<br/>
&gt;&gt; it takes to earn their friendship - be supportive and kind and honest<br/>
&gt;&gt; and trustworthy and caring and generous and loyal and fun and<br/>
&gt;&gt; interesting and interested in them and all the other things that good<br/>
&gt;&gt; friends are to each other. Be the best 40 year old friend you can be (or<br/>
&gt;&gt; whatever age you are).<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; People use &quot;I&#39;m the parent, not a friend,&quot; as an excuse to be mean,<br/>
&gt;&gt; selfish, and lazy. Instead, be the adult in the friendship. Be mature.<br/>
&gt;&gt; You&#39;ve BEEN a five-year-old and your child has not been a<br/>
&gt;&gt; forty-year-old, so you have an advantage in terms of long-term and wider<br/>
&gt;&gt; perspective. Use that advantage to be an even better friend. You know<br/>
&gt;&gt; how to be kinder and less self-centered and you know how beneficial it<br/>
&gt;&gt; is to put forth the effort.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I can honestly say that my children and I are friends. I know they&#39;d say<br/>
&gt;&gt; the same. I&#39;m not trying to act like I&#39;m 18 or 21 or 24 -- I am 57 years<br/>
&gt;&gt; old. They&#39;re having a &quot;Halo&quot; party at someone else&#39;s house tonight and<br/>
&gt;&gt; will stay up all night playing video games and I&#39;m not going to go and<br/>
&gt;&gt; hang out with them all night and play Halo. I&#39;m going to make a huge<br/>
&gt;&gt; platter of deviled eggs for them to take over there, but I&#39;m going to<br/>
&gt;&gt; stay home and watch a movie with my husband and go to bed early enough<br/>
&gt;&gt; that I&#39;ll feel good tomorrow. I&#39;m not 18 and I don&#39;t recover as quickly<br/>
&gt;&gt; as they do from a night with no sleep. I didn&#39;t go to the midnight<br/>
&gt;&gt; showing of the Terminator movie the other night, for the same reason.<br/>
&gt;&gt; But I was certainly invited and welcome.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; My kids are not spoiled brats because I&#39;ve tried to be their friend.<br/>
&gt;&gt; They hold jobs, they manage money, they make good and responsible<br/>
&gt;&gt; decisions. We are very strongly &quot;attached by affection and esteem.&quot;<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt; I wish I could wipe that expression out of everybody&#39;s minds and replace<br/>
&gt;&gt; it with &quot;Be the best friend to your children that you can be.&quot;<br/>

STOP asking her.  She said yes.<br/>
Stop asking anyone.  If people post something here that you KNOW won&#39;t  <br/>
hurt anyone anywhere (i.e. it&#39;s not talking about their sex life or  <br/>
how goofy their relatives are, the if you want to quote it (quoting  <br/>
meaning using the person&#39;s words in such a way that it&#39;s clear they  <br/>
are that other person&#39;s words), there&#39;s no problem with that.<br/>
<br/>
Give them credit.  Maybe put a link to the list, or at least tell  <br/>
where you read it.<br/>
<br/>
Filling the list up with &quot;Me too?&quot; or Me, Too!&quot; about ANYthing is a  <br/>
bad use of the list.<br/>
<br/>
What might be a good use of the list here would be to write something  <br/>
useful or funny or profound about what Pam&#39;s writings made you realize  <br/>
or think, and if you did quote it on your blog, give us a link to  <br/>
that, and if you have any plans specifically to change your life about  <br/>
it, that would be a good thing to share, too.<br/>
<br/>
Try to make every post useful to many people--&quot;many&quot; meaning more than  <br/>
a few, and not just people in one area; it&#39;s an international list.<br/>
