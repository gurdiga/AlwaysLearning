<div id="ygrps-yiv-1160508596">I was interested to read this piece as I am 52 and had my last period when Craig now 6 was about 2.  I have found recently that I am better at sleeping.  Sleep has however been a difficult thing for me for as long as I can remember.  It is only in the last few months that I am more able to full asleep and have actually slept for more than 2hrs at a time.<br/>

  -=- I actually need the least sleep and find if I <br/>
  do fall   asleep while waiting for them to I wake up about 2 unable to sleep  <br/>
  again  till  about 6 and then am tired for the rest of the  day.  Any  <br/>
  suggestions-=-<br/>

  This might not apply to the original author, but just as a piece of data  <br/>
  into the larger stream, remember menopause.  When women get older they will  <br/>
  sleep differently.  It seems one of the easiest and biggest strains on  <br/>
  relationships is that menopausal women will blame others for making them  uncomfortable <br/>
  and for keeping them from sleeping when it&#39;s just hormonal  changes.  <br/>
   <br/>
  I&#39;ve known several couples get divorced from inflexibility and lack of  <br/>
  awareness and compassion.  It doesn&#39;t just goe one way, either.  Some  men get <br/>
  angry when their wives have a hormone storm.  Sometimes wives just  want to be <br/>
  self-righteous and blame others for their natural discomforts.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Once again, being compassionate about kids&#39; changes can help affect how  <br/>
  adults respond to their own and each others&#39; needs and changes.<br/>
