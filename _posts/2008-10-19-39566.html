 </span></blockquote>The guild is still running.   Most information and questions get  <br/>
posted at unschooling gamers yahoo group, and a bit at the wow group  <br/>
on the FamilyRUN ning site.<br/>
<br/>
Realm:  The Venture Co.<br/>
Guild name:  Horde of Unschoolers<br/>
Faction:  Horde  ;-P<br/>
<br/>
If you tell me your character&#39;s name, I can keep and eye out for  <br/>
you.  Don&#39;t be surprised if someone doesn&#39;t let you in the guild  <br/>
right away; we&#39;ve been having a bit of trouble with guild bank  <br/>
raiding.   You can look for my characters... Talukah, Ehne, Takulah.   <br/>
It helps if you say who you are and that you got the info from which  <br/>
ever unschooling list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1353940629">My son&#39;s character Thomas is a level 5 troll priest with blue skin with priest quest juju hex robe and red hair.  He&#39;s trying to find guild members and not having much success.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone spots him he&#39;d love to join the guild.  He has a level 70 character in Greymane human warrior Peep, and an Alt character level 52 Frenry also.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1824848312">We would need his name.  For him to find someone in the guild he can  <br/>
type &lt;/who horde of unschoolers&gt; (minus arrows) in the chat box.   <br/>
It&#39;s best if he says who his is and maybe your name, and that his mom  <br/>
is on the Always Learning list, something like that.<br/>
<br/>
If someone doesn&#39;t answer him, it may be because they can&#39;t read yet,  <br/>
so ask another.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s welcome to ask one of my characters:  Takulah, Talukah, Ehne, or  <br/>
Jilam.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and are you sure he&#39;s on the right realm?  The Venture Co.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1392179267">Yes, he made a new character in Venture Co. just to find the unschoolers.  His character name is Thömàs, and is a troll priest.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  I&#39;ll have him keep looking.<br/>
