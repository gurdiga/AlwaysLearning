but I&#39;m thinking it must be around the same area.  I&#39;ve had it to the <br/>
mechanic twice to fix this problem, last year it was pooling water on the <br/>
other side.  *grrr*  This part of the country is the BEST place test the <br/>
water tightness of anything.<br/>

I&#39;ve had this problem too. I heard the solution (after selling the offending <br/>
car! &lt;g&gt;) on Click & Clack (NPR). It has to do with the AC system. There&#39;s a <br/>
clogged area somewhere in there, and it&#39;s leaking into the floorboard. <br/>
Relatively cheap and easy to fix. And you can call Click & Clack and ask to <br/>
make sure.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>If the leak&#39;s on the passenger side and coming from under the glove <br/>
compartment area AND smells/tastes like water, it probably *is* a blockage <br/>
in the AC system.  The water&#39;s not draining out and so it overflows and <br/>
eventually drips down into the inside of the car.  Sometimes when you go <br/>
around a corner, you&#39;ll hear a &#39;sloshing&#39; sound or the &#39;drip&#39; will <br/>
increase.  That&#39;s a dead giveaway that it&#39;s blocked and <br/>
overflowed.  Otherwise, it could be something else in the cooling/heating <br/>
system and that&#39;s a whole lot more expensive.<br/>
<br/>
You can fix it yourself if you&#39;ve a mind to by finding the &#39;drip&#39; hose from <br/>
the AC unit (it&#39;s a hose about the width of your pinky finger that goes <br/>
from the AC unit with the other end open, and the open-ended end usually <br/>
dropping just below the motor (so the stuff can drain to the road.)  On my <br/>
car, it&#39;s pretty close to the windshield side of the engine compartment and <br/>
about a foot in from the side of the car and another foot and a half down <br/>
into the motor area.)  Now that you&#39;ve found the hose, unclip it so the <br/>
open ended part (usually pointing towards the ground under the motor) is <br/>
where you can get ahold of it and attach something that can create some <br/>
suction.  (Only water and the offending bit of debris should be up the <br/>
hose, so there&#39;s little reason you can&#39;t just use your mouth, or the mouth <br/>
of your spouse! Just remember to spit afterwards! (and maybe brush your <br/>
teeth)) (grin)  The suction will release whatever&#39;s gotten wedged up in the <br/>
hose and you&#39;ll have a good quart or two of water coming out of the hose, <br/>
maybe more.  When the water&#39;s done draining, clip it back in and you&#39;re <br/>
good to go!<br/>
<br/>
We lived it going across country.  Lake Volvo.  That was us until we <br/>
figured it out!  Cost us nothing to fix!  Hooray!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-339341444">Oh, and if the leak is because of a bad windshield gasket, be sure to caulk <br/>
on the OUTSIDE of the windshield, not just the inside!  If you only do the <br/>
inside, the metal up against the glass will rust out and that&#39;s a pain to <br/>
fix.  Caulking on the outside as well as the in will help keep water away <br/>
from that metal area.  (You&#39;ll never guess where on the windshield I&#39;ll be <br/>
sanding rust away soon...  sigh.)<br/>
(or replace the gasket, about $150 to have someone else do it, less if you <br/>
can re-use your own windshield glass.  Have them check for rust and give <br/>
you a chance to steelwool and prime it away before they finish!)<br/>
Good luck with your waterworks,<br/>
