<div id="ygrps-yiv-865689231">I&#39;ve been meaning to share this with this list since it happened.  Sorry it&#39;s <br/>
kind of old now.  The academy was June 2-6<br/>
<br/>
This is an instant message between me and Wendy (some of you know Wendy, who <br/>
used to live with us), and I decided to leave the commentary.  This is the <br/>
best account I&#39;ve written of this and I&#39;m tired of writing about it now. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I hope the format isn&#39;t too irritating.  If it is, let me know and I&#39;ll try <br/>
another format.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
SandraDodd:  Are you there?<br/>
DWSO21:  yup.  good morning!<br/>
SandraDodd:  Marty got the Top Gun award.  Best marksman.<br/>
SandraDodd:  electronic and paintball.<br/>
SandraDodd:  All that Nintendo Duck Hunt has paid off.<br/>
DWSO21:  Where was this contest held?<br/>
DWSO21:  How cool for him!<br/>
SandraDodd:  Next time you&#39;re here, we can show you video of Marty on the <br/>
news, and the video they made of the kids.<br/>
<br/>
Junior Police Academy<br/>
DWSO21:  Archery in the back yard might have helped, too.<br/>
DWSO21:  Cool!<br/>
SandraDodd:  Didn&#39;t I tell you he was going to do the Junior Police Academy?  <br/>
Ooops if I didn&#39;t.<br/>
DWSO21:  No, you didn&#39;t mention it.  Did he get a uniform?<br/>
SandraDodd:  They were there all day ever day five days.  It&#39;s done.  It was <br/>
hard.  They played boot camp with them.<br/>
DWSO21:  How did he hear about it?  <br/>
SandraDodd:  Yep.  City paid for uniforms.  Black BDUs, canvas belt, black <br/>
t-shirt with academy logo and kid&#39;s name on the front, and a black cap with an <br/>
embroidered patch.<br/>
DWSO21:  hellicool!<br/>
SandraDodd:  Last winter Marty said that when he grew up he wanted to be a <br/>
professional wrestler, a cop, or an Air Force MP.<br/>
SandraDodd:  I said &quot;You just want to wear a fancy costume and hit people.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;yeah.&quot;<br/>
SandraDodd:  In late March or early April, my brother stole all my mom&#39;s <br/>
money.<br/>
DWSO21:  again?<br/>
DWSO21:  Marty is so cute.  <br/>
SandraDodd:  I made a couple of calls to try to tell them I thought I knew <br/>
where he was living.  <br/>
SandraDodd:  Couldn&#39;t find someone to take the info so I went to the website, <br/>
and stumbled upon this academy info from 2002.  <br/>
DWSO21:  So in a convoluted way, a good thing came out of your mom losing her <br/>
money.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Made calls, which inspired them to update their application for <br/>
2003.   Wrote a letter saying he&#39;s not an honors student and I can&#39;t provide a <br/>
GPA, but he&#39;d like it, he&#39;d be good at it, and that Ofc. Mark Elrick knew him <br/>
and would write him a letter of recommendation.   Mark finally did.  FINALLY. <br/>
 Barely.  But it worked.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Right.  And when Marty grows up and becomes a cop, THEN they can <br/>
catch my brother.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Because nobody right now seems to care.<br/>
DWSO21:  If your brother is still alive by the time Marty becomes a cop.  <br/>
Instant karma might get him first.<br/>
SandraDodd:  So no matter. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
They got to rapel off a tower, ride in swerving, chasing/running police cars <br/>
(on a practice track, one at a time in front with a helmet, and Holly go to do <br/>
it too!!<br/>
DWSO21:  how fun!<br/>
SandraDodd:  They saw demos of attack dogs, drug sniffing dogs, the little <br/>
police helicopter, the bomb squad, SWAT, horse cops...<br/>
SandraDodd:  Self defense classes, obstacle course, electronic indoor target <br/>
range, paintball targets and paintball obstacle course.  It was like a combo <br/>
boot-camp/fantasyland<br/>
SandraDodd:  Marty was one of four squad leaders, eight kids per squadron.<br/>
DWSO21:  Cool!  Hey, did they teach him the proper way to say, &quot;On the <br/>
ground, hippie!&quot; ?<br/>
SandraDodd:  They marched and marched and drilled and drilled.  It was pretty <br/>
impressive, the ceremony the last night.  Marty learned the Pledge of <br/>
Allegiance just for that occasion. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
DWSO21:  hee hee!<br/>
SandraDodd:  He doesn&#39;t know what you mean by &quot;on the ground, hippie.&quot;<br/>
SandraDodd:  Good.  That&#39;s progress.<br/>
DWSO21:  yeah.  Although it still works.  Anne & I were in Walgreens a couple <br/>
of months ago buying cheap sunglasses, and when we were trying to check out, <br/>
a guy who had just finished buying stuff walked out the door and the alarm <br/>
went off.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Marty&#39;s saying you could get a hippie on the ground with tear <br/>
gas.  Or a bean bag.   &quot;Arm/shoulder take-down.  Or an inside take-down.  Or the <br/>
attack dog. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
(See how much he&#39;s learned?)<br/>
DWSO21:  He stopped, and I said, &quot;on the ground, hippie!&quot; and he kinda <br/>
jumped.  I wasn&#39;t mean.  He was just startled by the alarm.  We (Anne, the clerk, <br/>
the guy) all laughed.<br/>
DWSO21:  You must be so proud of your little Militant Marty!<br/>
SandraDodd:  Oh yes.  Top Gun and squad leader.<br/>
DWSO21:  And shaved head.<br/>
SandraDodd:  He has long hair now.  Maybe  a third of an inch.<br/>
DWSO21:  So, HE&#39;S the hippie now! <br/>
SandraDodd:  We stopped by Active after the ceremony while he was still in <br/>
uniform.  He put his cap back on, and we showed off his class photo (with <br/>
instructors, in front of the helicopter) and his certificates.<br/>
SandraDodd:  AND Top Gun came with $15 gift certificate to Oshman&#39;s.<br/>
SandraDodd:  So you know how many paint balls that will buy? <br/>
<br/>
DWSO21:  Nice!<br/>
SandraDodd:  HARDLY ANY.<br/>
DWSO21:  I was about to say, &quot;probably about 3.&quot;<br/>
SandraDodd:  But wait.  I was going to tell you the best part and got <br/>
sidetracked with all this chit chat.<br/>
DWSO21:  Tell me the best part!<br/>
SandraDodd:  After the dinner they fed us (Quarters barbecue stuff, served up <br/>
by some of their meanest instructors &lt;g&gt;), I went to sit with the <br/>
coordinator/spokesman of the whole thing, and I thanked him and told him Marty had a <br/>
great time.<br/>
DWSO21:  and then?<br/>
SandraDodd:  He told me Marty was great to work with.<br/>
SandraDodd:  And in the course of our both saying nice things about Marty, he <br/>
said &quot;You can always tell when a kid comes from a home with a lot of <br/>
discipline and rules.&quot;<br/>
DWSO21:  ...and then you told him Marty&#39;s never been to school in his life, <br/>
didn&#39;t you?<br/>
DWSO21:  hee hee!<br/>
DWSO21:  That&#39;s a riot!<br/>
SandraDodd:  I told him that Monday had been Marty&#39;s first day of school of <br/>
any sort.<br/>
DWSO21:  what did he say next?<br/>
SandraDodd:  And that when he got home he had re-written his notes.  It was <br/>
the first time he had ever taken notes.<br/>
<br/>
It was four gun safety rules and the names of all the instructors.<br/>
SandraDodd:  &quot;Good.  Initiative! &quot;  He said.<br/>
<br/>
I told him we hardly have ANY rules at our house, we just tell them to make <br/>
good choices that don&#39;t hurt people.  <br/>
DWSO21:  And then he said, &quot;on the ground, hippie!&quot;<br/>
SandraDodd:  He said the homeschoolers he&#39;s met haven&#39;t tended to be very <br/>
outgoing but Marty was (I forget what he said)<br/>
SandraDodd:  That would have been the time to do it.   Except he was all <br/>
a-glow from luv of Marty.<br/>
DWSO21:  That&#39;s SO cool!<br/>
SandraDodd:  I&#39;ll just show you the videos when you get a chance.  Two short <br/>
news things and a five minute summary video (nicely put together!  we get a <br/>
free copy for providing a blank tape)<br/>
DWSO21:  Aren&#39;t you afraid, though, that being a cop will wreck Marty&#39;s <br/>
naturally sunny disposition?<br/>
DWSO21:  I want to see it.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Yeah.  He might not become a cop.  But it will be cop <br/>
appreciation.  Like when you are learning to play an instrument and quit, but still <br/>
afterwards you know what&#39;s good and what&#39;s not when you hear people playing one.<br/>
SandraDodd:  Oh!  They did a crime scene for them too.  <br/>
<br/>
They set up a room with clues and a storyline and the kids went in and found <br/>
the right clues, in groups.<br/>
SandraDodd:  He had a lot of fun with that.<br/>
DWSO21:  Anne wants info on the Junior Cop thing, so she can do it next year.<br/>
SandraDodd:  And they visited the forensics lab (right across the parking <br/>
lot) and the guy showed them real crime scene photos.  They said &quot;Dead body!&quot; and <br/>
he said &quot;if you&#39;re good.&quot;<br/>
DWSO21:  and were they good?<br/>
SandraDodd:  Age limit is 12-14.  this was Marty&#39;s last opportunity.  I am SO <br/>
glad I ran across it!! Thrilled.<br/>
DWSO21:  Did they see the dead body?<br/>
SandraDodd:  He showed them a body after while.  Drug murder, at a party, and <br/>
let them figure out why the blood pooled as it did.  How was he when he was <br/>
first shot, and then how did he move (or did someone else move him) after a <br/>
while.  (photo)<br/>
SandraDodd:  But one of the first ones was a kitchen.  &quot;See anything?&quot;<br/>
&quot;bullet hole in the linoleum.&quot;<br/>
&quot;Anything else?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Marty said he said &quot;That floor does NOT  go well with that wall.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ordinarily wise cracks were not being made, because they&#39;d make them do <br/>
pushups, but they had been left with a nice lab guy who wasn&#39;t into that. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
So he said<br/>
SandraDodd:  &quot;If this were a fashion class, you&#39;d be right.&quot;<br/>
SandraDodd:  And then he showed a second set of photos.  They spray something <br/>
on the floor and then photographic it under black light and blood showed up <br/>
all over that floor and in the hall, and on the side of the sink.<br/>
SandraDodd:  So if you&#39;re going to mop up a crime scene.  REALLY rinse.  <br/>
Maybe use hydrogen peroxide.   Rinse and repeat FOR SURE.<br/>
DWSO21:  Good to know!<br/>
SandraDodd:  Lest they bring in dogs and teargas, hippie!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1018325214">Very cool. I hope unschoolers don&#39;t just end up ultimately as drops in the<br/>
bucket of humanity. It seems such a waste that all our little bits of<br/>
brilliance and our shocking experiments in treating children like short<br/>
humans rather than poorly behaved dogs might never make much difference in<br/>
how people treat people in the end.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, wait, I was writing a CHEERFUL note. &lt;g&gt; Sorry. I forwarded the story<br/>
below to Wally, as the official gun-toter in the family he&#39;ll enjoy it, and<br/>
it&#39;s always nice to give him some examples of how our charming, clever,<br/>
polite daughters are quite possibly NOT going to become Impossible in Their<br/>
Teen Years. ;)<br/>

&gt; all over that floor and in the hall, and on the side of the sink.<br/>
&gt; SandraDodd:  So if you&#39;re going to mop up a crime scene.  REALLY rinse.<br/>
&gt; Maybe use hydrogen peroxide.   Rinse and repeat FOR SURE.<br/>
&gt; DWSO21:  Good to know!<br/>
&gt; SandraDodd:  Lest they bring in dogs and teargas, hippie!<br/>

Some other homeschoolers are in some kind of exploration club and have a <br/>
target-shooting session planned that they&#39;ve invited Marty to.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s amusing that hehas a certificate for marksmanship and has never <br/>
handled a real gun.   I guess he&#39;s deadly with paintball and electronics.  <br/>
<br/>
The practice guns the police academy uses are as realistic as they could make <br/>
them.  Same weight, you have to &quot;load&quot; and &quot;cock&quot; and release the safety and <br/>
all that stuff and there&#39;s recoil.  The movie they&#39;re shooting at has close <br/>
and far and moving targets.<br/>
