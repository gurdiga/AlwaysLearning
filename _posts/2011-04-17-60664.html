Lafayette Pushes Healthy Activity During TV Turn-Off Week <br/>
<br/>
The Bob Burger Recreation Center in Lafayette (Colorado) is celebrating TV Turn-Off Week with an offer for families to take part in a series of active and healthy activities.<br/>
<br/>
During TV Turn-Off Week, which runs from Monday through April 24, families are encouraged to take a week-long recess from television, electronic games and recreational use of the computer and fill their lives with active play, family interaction and community involvement.<br/>
<br/>
Every child in grades K-12 who registers for the program will receive a week&#39;s pass to the Bob Burger Recreation Center. All registered participants who turn in a completed activity log by May 2 will receive a prize package that includes a book of their choice and a certificate of participation.<br/>
<br/>
Parents of participating children will be entered into a drawing to win a BOB screentime controller device, compliments of Hopscotch Technology.<br/>
<br/>
The registration deadline is Sunday. To register, visit www.cityoflafayette.com/recreation.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1949522832">OH!  Besides the fact that someone else was using TV turn-off week as marketting, they used the term &quot;recess.&quot;  And they used it in such a way that suggested that weeks filled with TV viewing were the mandatory curriculum, and this would be a fun &quot;recess.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just altogether a muddle of confusion.<br/>
<br/>
When unschooling families can manage to create a life of choices, every choice can be good, and happy, not avoidance, and not &quot;woohoo!  Recess!&quot;<br/>

This reminds me - my 8 year old has a neighborhood friend who is in public school second grade.  The other day he came home after playing with her, and asked &quot;Mom, what&#39;s recess?&quot;  I told him - and he said &quot;ok then why did K***&#39;s teacher take away recess today because the class was being loud during math?  If the kids were being loud, shouldn&#39;t the teacher let them have lots of time running around outside and not no time running around outside??&quot;  :-)</div>

Brilliant.<br/>
And not the first time I&#39;ve seen a young unschooled child show a fine understanding of something professional educators totally miss.<br/>
