<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737083080">Reading the thread about oft-heard phrases got me thinking about all <br/>
the phrases that I say, and the minute they are out of my mouth I <br/>
want to take them back . . . they are those phrases that come out so <br/>
automatically.<br/>
<br/>
Here are a few of mine:<br/>
&quot;What were you thinking?&quot;  <br/>
-- usually emerges in reponse to one child hitting, pushing, or <br/>
otherwise hurting a sibling.  Like they were thinking?!?!  They were <br/>
mad, frustrated, upset -- most adults aren&#39;t even thinking when they <br/>
feel like that.  I find this the worst of rhetorical questions plus <br/>
I am implying that my child is stupid -- oooh, I just hate it when I <br/>
hear that come out of my mouth and always find myself backpedalling <br/>
as fast as I can!<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am only going to say this once&quot;<br/>
-- HA HA HA!  The joke is on me isn&#39;t it?!?!  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Are you sure you want to ...?&quot;  Followed by &quot;Don&#39;t you want <br/>
to ...?&quot;  or &quot;I thought you wanted to ...&quot;<br/>
-- usually said when the kids want to do something that I am not <br/>
sure I want to say yes to.  Example: Ds has a friend over to play, <br/>
it is a beautiful day outside.  They want to watch a movie and come <br/>
to ask if they can put in &quot;Madagascar.&quot;  I say &quot;are you sure?  I <br/>
thought you wanted W to come over so you could play.&quot;<br/>
In my case, this is a rediculous way to buy myself time while I toss <br/>
my luggage out the window so that I can say &quot;yes.&quot;  I mean, really, <br/>
would they ask if they could play a computer game or watch a movie <br/>
if they weren&#39;t &quot;sure?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;But you were starving while I was making dinner/lunch/breakfast.&quot;  T<br/>
-- exclaimed, obviously, when a child eats about two bites and <br/>
declares themselves full.  Oooh, and as I think about it, this one <br/>
is usually accompanied by the already discussed &quot;are you sure?&quot;  I <br/>
think this one is leftover from the whole clear your plate way-of-<br/>
being.  I&#39;ve gotten past the starving children in Africa, but just <br/>
can&#39;t seem to get completely clear of all those fodd issues.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so what good does it do to admit it if I can&#39;t get rid  of <br/>
it?  Any suggestions?  Sometimes I feel like I need one of those dog <br/>
training collars, send a little shock into my ankle everytime <br/>
I &quot;bark.&quot;  <br/>

You CAN get rid of it.  I bet having written those down and posting  <br/>
them will help. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You don&#39;t need a shock collar, you just need to replace the little  <br/>
voices in your head with new, improved, more-aware-and-compassionate  <br/>
little voices.<br/>

<br/>
Post the list on the refrigerator and ask them to point it out every  <br/>
time you say one of them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-509792564">My husband and I listening last week to one of the Live and Learn CD&#39;s.  I<br/>
think it was the one entitled, &quot;Mindful Parenting&quot;...by Sandra and Ren.  We<br/>
purchased about 15 or so of them, so it&#39;s kind of crazy in my brain...but I<br/>
think it was that one.  Anyhow, towards the end of the CD it talks about<br/>
taking a breath...pausing.  We really liked that idea.  It seems so simple<br/>
to do.  My husband and I noticed that at the same time you have to remember<br/>
not to roll your eyes, take a breath that sounds like a big sigh, slump your<br/>
shoulders....because that breath / pause can then become a judgment in<br/>
waiting.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe try that breath / pause.<br/>
<br/>
Also, whenever I act like an idiot and say something ridiculous to Sorscha,<br/>
I normally start laughing and apologize.  And, of course, whenever I start<br/>
laughing...it means tickle time for Sorscha.  That so-called important thing<br/>
that most of the time is not, turns into a great memory for the both of us.<br/>
This works with my husband Dave too!!!!<br/>

It&#39;s take a slow deep breath, not &quot;heave a theatrical sigh.&quot;<br/>
Sighs are out, and have sound.<br/>
Breaths should be filling and renewing and nurturing and all that  <br/>
good stuff. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Be careful with tickling.  Some people don&#39;t like it, but will endure  <br/>
it to keep peace, or to have the physical touch.  She might sometimes  <br/>
prefer just softer touching but not want to admit it, or not fully  <br/>
realize it.  Even though it makes people laugh, tickling can be  <br/>
invasive and sometimes painful.  And sometimes there IS something  <br/>
that needs to be said after that deep breath or two, it just needs to  <br/>
be in a gentle form.  Tickling instead of saying something might be  <br/>
like changing the subject, sometimes.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Yes! Ask your kids at some quiet time if they like to be tickled.  <br/>
(You might be surprised by the answer!) Ask before you do it if they  <br/>
want you to.<br/>
<br/>
Tickling is such a weird thing because it makes someone laugh but  <br/>
it&#39;s incredibly disempowering. The tickled person is totally at the  <br/>
mercy of the one doing the tickling. Having someone take away a  <br/>
child&#39;s power over her body for even a (very intense) minute or two  <br/>
can be another reminder of how powerless she is in the world.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is a really really good point!  We have always had the policy <br/>
that if someone say no or stop, that&#39;s it -- no discussion, tickling <br/>
is over.  BUT, when I read that post it made me examine something:  <br/>
my DS6 loves to be tickled by my DH, and, I am wondering if that is <br/>
because a) he really likes it; or b) he wants &quot;the physical <br/>
touch&quot;/physical interaction with DH.  As DS has gotten older I have <br/>
noticed that he and DH spend less time snuggling and more time <br/>
tickling and wrestling.  I will take the suggestion of using a quiet <br/>
moment to ask DS about this and identify whether this is something <br/>
that is mutual, or if he has fallen into the tickling/wrestling <br/>
thing as a way to get more intimacy from his father, who was raised <br/>
with almost no touching -- tickling, hugging or otherwise, and may <br/>
not even realize that he has started withholding loving snuggles.<br/>
