&gt;<br/>
&gt;&lt;&lt;And what do you do when they fall asleep downstairs on the floor?  <br/>
&gt;Wake them up and coax them upstairs?  And when they stay up until <br/>
&gt;they fall asleep on the floor, they never feel like brushing their <br/>
&gt;teeth...&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Have tooth brushing at a certain time without regard to sleep-time so they&#39;re <br/>
&gt;all done, or let them wait until they wake up.   I&#39;d carry them to bed or to <br/>
&gt;a couch when they fell asleep on the floor.  The sleeping is more important <br/>
&gt;than the being in a bed.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just cover mine with a blanket, if they don&#39;t have one already.  I <br/>
don&#39;t care if anyone sleeps on the floor.  It&#39;s hard to lug a 65 lb. 8 <br/>
yo to bed, anyway.  There&#39;s no way I&#39;d wake a kid up so he can brush his <br/>
teeth!  He can brush his teeth right after dinner, if it&#39;s that important.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I&#39;ve noticed when some people complain about kids not going to <br/>
sleep early enough--their houses are blazing with lights on, there&#39;s <br/>
activity and noise, and the atmosphere is not conducive to sleep.  If <br/>
you want your little ones to get sleepy, do things that bring on rest <br/>
and comfort.  Turn off all of the lights in the rest of the house, turn <br/>
down the lights in the room they&#39;re in, turn off the stereo or the TV, <br/>
keep your conversation quiet.  Curl up on the couch with a good <br/>
book--whatever.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve found that even if a kid feels like staying awake after all that, <br/>
their activity level is much diminished, and I can go to sleep in peace, <br/>
knowing the house is locked up and squared away for the night, except <br/>
for the room he is in.  I can give last minute instructions (&quot;please set <br/>
the sleep timer on your TV before you go to sleep&quot;) and go to bed.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always really quiet when I get up, too.  It&#39;s such a gift to wake up <br/>
naturally (poor husband doesn&#39;t get to) and according to your own <br/>
rhythm.  I&#39;m trying to teach my son to listen to his rhythms of <br/>
sleep/wake, hungry/full.  I want that to last for him as long as possible.<br/>
