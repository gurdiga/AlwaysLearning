<div id="ygrps-yiv-1726267423">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Cacie is right now inventing an amusement park<br/>
ride that is an enormous<br/>
fifties-style woman, in a poodle skirt and all that,<br/>
hula-hooping... <br/>
and the ride, as I understand it, involved people<br/>
being somehow attached to<br/>
the hoop (or maybe strung into the hoop, like giant<br/>
beads?), so she hulas<br/>
and everyone zooms around... she&#39;s telling my dad<br/>
about it as she hulas<br/>
in the kitchen, I&#39;m just listening in. :-)<br/>
<br/>
Dar&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wow, sounds awesome! I&#39;d like to ride on that. <br/>
