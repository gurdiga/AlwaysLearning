<div id="ygrps-yiv-1719099961">Just a quick reminder that the MHEA homeschooling conference is this<br/>
Saturday at Anne Arundel Community College (about half-way between Baltimore<br/>
and Annapolis). Please come out to support MHEA. Since 1980, MHEA has been<br/>
the only statewide inclusive organization representing Maryland<br/>
homeschoolers of all religious views and philosophies of homeschooling. This<br/>
conference will have something for all homeschoolers, whether your children<br/>
are young or old, you just started homeschooling or have done it for<br/>
decades.<br/>
<br/>
Go to www.MHEA.com for more information.<br/>
<br/>
Also, FUN Books (www.FUN-Books.com) will be at the conference. If you have<br/>
any special items you would like to see us bring to the conference, please<br/>
let us know right away. You can place an order in advance and just let us<br/>
know you want to pick it up at the conference so you won&#39;t have to pay<br/>
shipping or have to worry about us running out of something you want. You<br/>
can also let us know about any items you would like to look at so we can be<br/>
sure to bring them with us.<br/>
<br/>
Please come out to support MHEA and attend the many great workshops and<br/>
activities! Be sure to remind all your homeschooling friends about this<br/>
upcoming event.<br/>
