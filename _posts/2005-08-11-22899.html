<div id="ygrps-yiv-1071470383">Hey,<br/>
This kind of late, I&#39;m checking old emails and thought of an option to your question about <br/>
trying out new video games.  My son tries out video games at gamefly.com.  It works like <br/>
Netflix where you set up a wish list on the internet and they send you video games which you <br/>
can keep as long as you want.  When you are tired of the game just send it back and they <br/>
send you another game from your wish list.  I find that it saves us a lot of money because my <br/>
son isn&#39;t buying lots of games that later turn out to be boring or too easy for him.  Then, if <br/>
he really likes a game he can buy it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-207071921">Hi All!<br/>
<br/>
We just got Xbox live recently and my<br/>
darling 11 yo son Cameron would love to play some unschoolers. He noticed<br/>
the sudden drop-off of possible players this week:-) Ah, school days.<br/>
So do you have<br/>
any children who would like to share user names on-list or off, in<br/>
particular for Halo 2? His username is Abandoned Rose - this is cameron<br/>
writing saying &quot;yea i no that is a really sucky name&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
Jacki<br/>
