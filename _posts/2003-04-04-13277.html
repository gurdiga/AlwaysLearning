<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Ds has both bottom front teeth in but not<br/>
&gt; the top. One finally broke through this week. He&#39;d been toothless for a<br/>
&gt; year. At this rate maybe by the end of this summer he&#39;ll be able to eat corn<br/>
&gt; on the cob without cutting it off. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Tim lost his front top two teeth in an accident when he was 2, and ate<br/>
apples on the core and corn on the cob until he lost his bottom teeth, too<br/>
(naturally, thank goodness!).  I have no idea how he did it.  He&#39;s finally<br/>
getting one of his permanent top teeth, but it&#39;s been 4 years with a gappy<br/>
smile.  <br/>
<br/>
Last Christmas, before the top tooth cut, he sang &quot;All I want for Christmas<br/>
is My Two Front Teeth&quot; in the Military Theatre&#39;s Christmas show, and was too<br/>
cute.  They cast him as the youngest boy just so he could sing that song!<br/>
