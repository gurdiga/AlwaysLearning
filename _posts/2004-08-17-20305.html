<div id="ygrps-yiv-206560074">Am I just expecting too much? To be able to get along with my 6yo ds <br/>
without feeling that we are against each other all of the time - <br/>
most of the time I feel he does things to make me upset. What a <br/>
horrible time! I asked him if he is upset with me or if I have done <br/>
something to make him so mad at the slightest thing, if he has a <br/>
problem to tell me and perhaps I can help him. Again today I am in <br/>
tears because I want to be able to &quot;get along&quot; with my son on some <br/>
small level that we are both happy and it&#39;s not happening. Does <br/>
anyone else have a 6yo or remember them at this age - what is going <br/>
on that I&#39;m not seeing? Of course I&#39;m saying &quot;this age&quot; because I&#39;m <br/>
hoping that something inside of him is going to develop and work <br/>
itself out to a better disposition. I just can&#39;t accept that my son <br/>
has a nasty disposition - that he wants to continually argue with <br/>
me, that he wants to hit and yell at me, that he refuses to behave <br/>
humanely towards me. I just don&#39;t know how things have gotten this <br/>
bad, I knew we weren&#39;t perfect but I thought we were working to a <br/>
mutual level of understanding on some level. <br/>
 What I have been trying to do is when he does something that is <br/>
inappropriate or violent I explain to him why people can&#39;t do that <br/>
so he can learn a better way to get what he wants. We are radical <br/>
unschoolers and he has no limits set on him, I try and help him get <br/>
what he wants and needs. We don&#39;t punish, we discuss, or at least I <br/>
try to but he prefers to yell, ignore me or hit me. I feel like I am <br/>
loosing him! Any input would probably be helpful - Thanks - Moza</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1683379773">Hello,<br/>
I am Allie. I am a 26 year old Mom to a 6 year old son. I remember about 6 <br/>
months ago the same thing was going on in my home.  and it had been for at least <br/>
a year. My son was so nasty to everyone but mainly me. I got the worst of it. <br/>
He would continuously argue with me. I mean from the time he woke up till he <br/>
went to sleep, sleep, now that&#39;s a whole other story. it would take at least a <br/>
good hour to get him to lie down to go to sleep. He would hit me, he would <br/>
bite me, he would curse at me, he would smack me, he would kick me, anything you <br/>
can think of he would do. I cried and cried and cried. I did not know what to <br/>
do. I actually thought I was going to have to send him away. because we <br/>
ourselves don&#39;t believe in spanking. <br/>
Now please remember that I do have a special needs child. He has epilepsy, <br/>
allergies. asthma and ADHD. <br/>
I don&#39;t really know what changed all of that. i don&#39;t know if he just grew <br/>
out of it or what. but at the end of it all i decided that it would be OK for <br/>
him to see me cry. we are talking after close to a year of this, he finally seen <br/>
how it really made me feel. from then on we talked about things and if i felt <br/>
hurt enough to cry I did so. then he started to cry along with me. And we <br/>
talked more and more.<br/>
Now he is a different child towards me all together. I mean he is still <br/>
mischievous and rotten at times but it is no whereas intense as it use to be. And <br/>
we continue to talk. He helps me cook and clean. Everything I do pertaining to <br/>
house work he helps. <br/>
I don&#39;t know how, but its like he just decided to not be that way anymore.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will help you in any way, I hope it does but I do want <br/>
you to know you are not alone.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1538564618">Some ideas that I&#39;ve been given for help with my son are:<br/>
 <br/>
Reading The Explosive Child, this book really helped me a lot when it came to relating to my son.<br/>
 <br/>
Looking at his diet, does any particular food seem to affect his mood.  Things like food dyes, gluten and dairy have been suggested as causing explosive behavior.  I haven&#39;t been able to specifically track any triggers for my son, but I do find the less refined foods he eats the better his mood is.  This is tricky since I don&#39;t control what my son eats.  I kept a food journal for a few weeks where I wrote down everything he ate and how many fits and the severity he had.  Once I was able to notice some connections, I talked about them with my son.  I truly believe he doesn&#39;t like being out of control any more than I like it.<br/>
 <br/>
I find my son&#39;s much easier to get along with if I start his day with a deep back rub.  It seems to help release a lot of tension from him and he is able to stay more in control.  Massaging his knees and elbows seems to help to.  When he is starting to melt down if I can rub his back it usually helps him calm down.<br/>
 <br/>
If I can remember to wrestle with my son a couple of times a day he is easier to get along with.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve also found Rescue Remedy to work wonders when he is being particularly difficult (I hate using that word, but you know what I mean).<br/>
 <br/>
I know how difficult what you are going through is.  I hope some of what I said can be helpful to you.  There is a Yahoo group for people who have read The Explosive Child and are trying to follow the suggestions in the book.  If you read the book and think it fits your son I can give you the address for the group.<br/>

Alexander is only four but I have also found when he is wound up in the<br/>
evening and having difficulty winding down, ten deep breaths help and I also<br/>
can put him to sleep by giving him a foot massage with sesame oil.  It is a<br/>
little bit stinky but it literally knocks him out.  I have no idea why but<br/>
it works.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-64171417">I have a now 7 year old who has been going through the same thing for more than a year. She has gotten better, but she can start out first thing in the morning terrorizing her still sleeping siblings and if I don&#39;t turn things around immediately this can go on all day long! <br/>
 <br/>
We have 5 kids ages 10,8,7,4 and one of them 17 months old. The youngest still breastfeeds and needs to be held and kept out of danger (he is very adventurous) so Parker resents the extra attention he gets. If I say anything kind or positive to anyone else in the family she expects me to immediatey do so with her. I try to talk with her and reassure her that I have enough love to share with everyone and that being kind to someone else in the family doesn&#39;t take anything away from her and that I always love her. She resists brushing her teeth and refuses to brush her hair. She says things like, &quot;Only if you do this or that will I brush my teeth&quot;. I often wonder if I have maybe chosen the wrong job. <br/>
 <br/>
She screams and hollers if I talk too much about things. She actually hurts people in the family and seems to enjoy doing it! She bites, scratches, jumps on the backs of other resting children and manipulates the others. From her perspective I am not &quot;cuddling&quot; her enough and I am beside myself when she goes on a bloodthirsty (just kidding) rampage and then falls to the floor in a  heap screaming , &quot;cuddle me!!!!!!&quot;  At this stage I can&#39;t stop to cuddle her. I am too busy tending to the wounds of her victims or clearing away the dangerous wreckage she has left in her wake.  <br/>
I have actually fantasized about finding a more suitable family for her to grow up in. With other people she can be absolutely sophisticated, upbeat and positive. She can be super helpful and delightful even. They tell me what a lovely person she is.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
Things have gotten much better than they were. We have long stretches in the day when she is &#39;best buddies&#39; with her sisters and she seems content. She does best when I start the morning cuddling her and sometimes reading to her- though she is learning to read and sometimes prefers to read to me. And she is really happy when we spend the day away from home playing, going places, doing things. She is quiet for hours when she does her artwork as she loves this. <br/>
 <br/>
Maybe I should have instead pursued a career. I certainly lack answers. One thing that seems to work best is creative thinking. When I get as creative with mothering as I would a piece of art or a story, where anything goes, I am met with peace and a happy Parker. <br/>
 <br/>
And here is the thing.... she knows the difference between right and wrong. When we are at the beach or some other place I have often overheard her guiding one of her siblings into making better moral choices! The kids actually have these long philosophical discussions about what you can and can&#39;t do in different parts of the world and what is right or wrong. <br/>
 <br/>
Moza, I hope my ramblings at least help you to feel that you are not alone. It helps me to share these feelings. I forget that one of the best ways to get through something is to talk about it. I just hold things inside and/or try to work it out with my husband. But we are both sort of feeling our way through these difficult times. I often admire cultures where there is a large extended family to rely on. If one person doesn&#39;t have the answer or the personal quality that is needed for a particular challenge, send in auntie or uncle- they have a way with so and so. Instead, I find that I am having to cultivate useful qualities out of necessity. Often I learn what to do by watching my children who are always learning and always teaching.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-82677638">I am feeling really embarrassed for having shared on this thread. What I said was misconstrued, partly due to my own failings... I was short on time to begin with and didn&#39;t fill in all of the details. It was unfair for me to share such personal information about my daughter without her permission.  Also it was foolish of me to join your group and just jump right in.  <br/>
 <br/>
      I need to clear up a few things.... I will do this  because I honestly feel like I am now on the witness stand. Of course I  cuddle my beautiful little daughter and quite regularly. Of course she gets extra attention in many different ways. She gets most of the &#39;turns&#39; next to me in our enormous family bed, I hug her, spend time alone with her, help her to pursue her interests, she was tandem nursed until she was 2 1/2,  I have devoted my efforts, for most of her life to attachment parenting. I am not perfect. It is funny how you get less and less perfect the more kids you have despite efforts to be better. <br/>
 <br/>
      I am guilty of having  climbed on and off of the wagon over the years- but the efforts have been truly heart felt and the results meaningful. Other factors as well... an international move just over a year ago, 5 moves since. Culture shock. An attempt at primary school- bad experience. Many changes.<br/>
<br/>
      I do not &quot;wait until she is collapsed to take care of her.&quot; But when you are the parent of 5 closely spaced young children there is alot going on. Any respectable triage, must prioritise and act quickly- sometimes kives are in the balance, but everyone gets taken care of. Kids go through things.  I believe that that was the topic I was responding to. Sometimes no matter how much the mother tries, the child still behaves badly, screams and goes through difficult changes. <br/>
<br/>
      If I have failed to prevent that at any time does that make me an cold, uncaring mother?   Please, do not answer if it is going to be preachy. I am not looking for advice now. I was not requesting advice before. I shared the bit that I did because Moza wanted to know if other 6 y/o&#39;s behaved badly too. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1344507237">Hi Cynthia et al!<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this group and thankfully was warned that some comments may<br/>
appear harsh.<br/>
<br/>
Cynthia, when I read your original post, I was appreciative that you offered<br/>
honestly and humbly. And your insight was inspirational. I know the feeling<br/>
of embarrassment and vulnerability after posting something and then hearing<br/>
the responses! It can certainly feel personally attacking! I think mostly<br/>
though, we just like to read our own brilliantly intelligent responses ;)<br/>
<br/>
So here&#39;s mine, not necessarily directed at your post. I have four children<br/>
ages 15, 14, 12 and 10, so I fully appreciate the &quot;I can&#39;t do it all&quot; times<br/>
and have left many a child crying simply because there isn&#39;t another arm or<br/>
head or thought to offer in the moment. It is a very hard place to be in as<br/>
a mother...especially when we believe that all cries should be answered! I<br/>
see now at this point however how it all works out and that children crying<br/>
is a GOOD thing, and isn&#39;t something to be stopped or pacified, but welcomed<br/>
and respected as part of the child&#39;s healing. At the end of a tantrum, if<br/>
allowed or even encouraged to let it all out, I found my kids were so much<br/>
happier, calmer and most interesting to me, clearer in their thinking.<br/>
Sometimes though, I didn&#39;t have the attention to give and they just went<br/>
through their thing without my support, but I figured at least I wasn&#39;t<br/>
shaming or disapproving of them to add to their distress!<br/>
<br/>
Something that can irk me is parents, often with their first child, doing<br/>
anything and everything in their power to make their child happy, or stop<br/>
their child from crying and tantrumming. It is one of my pet peeves, even<br/>
though I know logically that they are doing their best to be the best<br/>
parents they can be, as we all are. I agree with answering all babies and<br/>
children&#39;s cries with attention, love and support. I don&#39;t do it to stop<br/>
their crying or tantrum however, but to support the healing they are going<br/>
through by crying. Welcoming the cries as much as the laughter is one of my<br/>
goals.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your input Cynthia! It was refreshing!<br/>

Subject: Re: [AlwaysLearning] How well does one get along with a 6yo?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
      I am feeling really embarrassed for having shared on this thread. What<br/>
I said was misconstrued, partly due to my own failings... I was short on<br/>
time to begin with and didn&#39;t fill in all of the details. It was unfair for<br/>
me to share such personal information about my daughter without her<br/>
permission.  Also it was foolish of me to join your group and just jump<br/>
right in.<br/>
<br/>
      I need to clear up a few things.... I will do this  because I honestly<br/>
feel like I am now on the witness stand. Of course I  cuddle my beautiful<br/>
little daughter and quite regularly. Of course she gets extra attention in<br/>
many different ways. She gets most of the &#39;turns&#39; next to me in our enormous<br/>
family bed, I hug her, spend time alone with her, help her to pursue her<br/>
interests, she was tandem nursed until she was 2 1/2,  I have devoted my<br/>
efforts, for most of her life to attachment parenting. I am not perfect. It<br/>
is funny how you get less and less perfect the more kids you have despite<br/>
efforts to be better.<br/>
<br/>
      I am guilty of having  climbed on and off of the wagon over the years-<br/>
but the efforts have been truly heart felt and the results meaningful. Other<br/>
factors as well... an international move just over a year ago, 5 moves<br/>
since. Culture shock. An attempt at primary school- bad experience. Many<br/>
changes.<br/>
<br/>
      I do not &quot;wait until she is collapsed to take care of her.&quot; But when<br/>
you are the parent of 5 closely spaced young children there is alot going<br/>
on. Any respectable triage, must prioritise and act quickly- sometimes kives<br/>
are in the balance, but everyone gets taken care of. Kids go through things.<br/>
I believe that that was the topic I was responding to. Sometimes no matter<br/>
how much the mother tries, the child still behaves badly, screams and goes<br/>
through difficult changes.<br/>
<br/>
      If I have failed to prevent that at any time does that make me an<br/>
cold, uncaring mother?   Please, do not answer if it is going to be preachy.<br/>
I am not looking for advice now. I was not requesting advice before. I<br/>
shared the bit that I did because Moza wanted to know if other 6 y/o&#39;s<br/>
behaved badly too.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
<br/>

&lt;&lt; She resists brushing her teeth and refuses to brush her hair. She says<br/>
things like, &quot;Only if you do this or that will I brush my teeth&quot;. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have others done that to her?  Refuse normal cooperation unless she performs<br/>
tasks?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I often wonder if I have maybe chosen the wrong job. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If she just doesn&#39;t brush her hair for days on end, it won&#39;t hurt her.<br/>
There are detanglers that can save her later.   Would she go for a shorter<br/>
hairstyle?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;From her perspective I am not &quot;cuddling&quot; her enough &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
  It&#39;s real cuddling, and she really needs it.  The quotation marks make it<br/>
seem that you doubt it somehow.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;At this stage I can&#39;t stop to cuddle her. I am too busy tending to the<br/>
wounds of her victims or clearing away the dangerous wreckage she has left<br/>
in her<br/>
wake.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Can you cuddle her first, before the blows?<br/>
If she had a need for protein food or medication or insulin you probably<br/>
wouldn&#39;t wait until she was collapsed to take care of her.   Maybe you could<br/>
schedule it like medication.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And here is the thing.... she knows the difference between right and<br/>
wrong.<br/>
When we are at the beach or some other place I have often overheard her<br/>
guiding one of her siblings into making better moral choices! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe, really, she thinks you&#39;re not doing right when you don&#39;t cuddle her.<br/>
<br/>
When one child needs more, it&#39;s okay (and better for everyone) if she gets<br/>
more.<br/>

<br/>
Amen. I sure do agree with this one. This thread has been so helpful to me,<br/>
and I&#39;m thankful for those like Cynthia who have opened their hearts to talk<br/>
about difficult experiences with their children. Cynthia, while I read your<br/>
post, I was nodding my head, thinking about one of my own kids. I also<br/>
appreciated Sandra&#39;s response.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s been a great relief to me to read that others have such issues and<br/>
difficulities. So often, I read the wonderful stories from unschooling/AP<br/>
parents and despair that I must be the only one who has a child leaving such<br/>
destruction in his/her wake. It&#39;s comforting to know that not all<br/>
unschooling/AP parents have perfect children. ;-)<br/>
<br/>

many of your posts on the topic.  <br/>
<br/>
Denice, I love how you said that it is refreshing to hear that<br/>
unschooling/AP parents also have children who leave destruction in their<br/>
wake.  I can really relate to this!  All that I have been reading about<br/>
everyone&#39;s 6yo&#39;s reminds me so much of my 4yo.  He and my 1yo are so<br/>
jealous of each other.  I try to offer them both my time alone, but my<br/>
4yo just always seems angry.  He often trips the baby, hits him, etc. <br/>
It&#39;s enough to make me feel like I&#39;m not cut out for this job.  This is<br/>
where I can really relate to you, Cynthia!  I&#39;m thankful you shared your<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290756447">I understand that when a child is sad because something got broken or they<br/>
were disappointed by something (like something was cancelled that they<br/>

would just tell them that I understood how disappointed they were and hold<br/>

them alone while they have their tantrum because it&#39;s *healthy* to let hem<br/>

 <br/>
I have been around small children many times who I could see were trying to<br/>
ask for something or tell someone something and because the person whom they<br/>
were trying to communicate didn&#39;t understand (imo, didn&#39;t take the time to<br/>
try to understand or listen to them) them they ended up having a tantrum.  I<br/>
could see it coming a mile away.  &lt;now I try to intervene more on the<br/>
child&#39;s behalf but didn&#39;t always in the past, depending on the<br/>
circumstances.&gt;  So, eventually, the child is having an all out tantrum and<br/>
they are either punished for it, or *allowed to express their emotion<br/>
because it&#39;s considered healthy. (i.e.. ignored)  I just think that if<br/>
parents took the time more often to listen to their children and take their<br/>
needs and wants seriously, that the child wouldn&#39;t feel the need to tantrum<br/>
in the first place.<br/>

It&#39;s so important IMO to be respectful of a child&#39;s feelings and to <br/>
allow them to go through &quot;big emotions&quot; and not just expect or coerce <br/>
them into being/acting happy all the time. It&#39;s hard to see them <br/>
unhappy, and the temptation is strong to just &quot;jolly&quot; them right back <br/>
into a good mood, but this isn&#39;t natural IMO. They need that release. I <br/>
know I sometimes feel SO much better after a good cry. It can even carry <br/>
over to feeling better the next day.<br/>
<br/>
DD cries sometimes when her Elmo videos end because she loves them so <br/>
much she just wishes they could go on forever. I usually just offer a <br/>
hug if she wants it, but I don&#39;t push myself on her, and I just say, &quot;I <br/>
understand that you&#39;re sad it&#39;s over,&quot; and other sympathetic words in a <br/>
kind tone, but I don&#39;t try to stop her from crying.<br/>
<br/>
DH walked in just as she burst into tears the other day because one <br/>
ended and he started laughing. I totally understood why, it was a really <br/>
cute cry at the same time as it made me sad to see her so sad. But I <br/>
didn&#39;t want him getting into the habit of laughing at her every time she <br/>
gets upset just because it is cute in a way.<br/>
<br/>
She gets over being upset really quickly, sometimes starts laughing and <br/>
smiling while the big fat tears are still rolling down her cheeks, lol. <br/>
But I just remember my dad being so amused when I would get upset about <br/>
something and that would just make me even more mad and I felt really <br/>
belittled. So I told DH to restrain his laughter if he could.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I&#39;m not letting him have his feelings, lol. I&#39;m contradicting <br/>
myself! I guess it&#39;s okay for him to feel amused, as long as he isn&#39;t so <br/>
blatant about it that he makes her feel worse. KWIM?<br/>

just that it might strike some people as being cute if they saw it. It&#39;s <br/>
SO dramatic and nothing is really wrong. She&#39;s not hungry, tired, in <br/>
pain, etc. she&#39;s just experiencing a momentary disappointment that <br/>
passes quickly whether I intervene or not. I offer her a hug and <br/>
sometimes she takes me up on it, sometimes she just shakes her head and <br/>
goes to her toybox to find something to play with.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>ITA agree that she is more likely to get upset if she is hungry. But <br/>
sometimes she gets upset anyway. She&#39;s very small still, and doesn&#39;t <br/>
have the level of understanding about emotions and their underlying <br/>
causes that your kids have. I wouldn&#39;t say she is short-tempered, just <br/>
strong-willed and sensitive. So I guess there is a personality <br/>
difference as well as an age difference.<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

as a newborn so I wore her in a sling all the time. I would never <br/>
advocate letting a newborn cry without attempting to cuddle it or feed <br/>
it etc. I was talking about a toddler who was just having a little <br/>
trouble shifting gears from one activity or one state to another and <br/>
having a momentary outburst. If she cried for a long time, clearly I <br/>
would do whatever I needed to do to comfort her, but she only cries for <br/>
a minute and then is happy again. Sometimes she needs a snuggle to <br/>
bounce back, sometimes she doesn&#39;t. But I am totally here for her, <br/>
whatever she needs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I DO practice AP and I am not proposing that people ignore their kids <br/>
when they cry. I&#39;m sorry if that wasn&#39;t clear in my original post. I am <br/>
just not one to force my daughter to hug or snuggle if she doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to, and I tend to let her work her emotions out on her own if that seems <br/>
like what she wants to do. It&#39;s not neglect or coldness on my part. <br/>
Believe me, we are firmly attached. :-)<br/>

stop them from crying. The person who is not trying to stop them from <br/>
crying is still there for them, doing whatever they sense the child needs <br/>
at the time. It&#39;s just that their purpose is to support the child in <br/>
dealing with their emotions rather than just trying to change their <br/>
emotions. I think it&#39;s an important point.<br/>
<br/>
I know I still hate it when someone comforts me in a way that says to me <br/>
that my crying upsets them, and they want it to stop for that reason. <br/>
Sometimes crying is exactly what I need. Maybe I need someone to hug me <br/>
while I cry, and maybe I don&#39;t, but I need that cry. What I don&#39;t need is <br/>
efforts to jolly me out of what I&#39;m feeling right then. I think that&#39;s the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1531232685">Oh absolutely. She sometimes watches them three times in a row. I&#39;m not <br/>
one of those &quot;TV is evil&quot; types. She has little or no interest in TV in <br/>
general but Sesame Street she loves.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes it&#39;s just time to move on to the next thing. Either we have to <br/>
leave the house to go somewhere, or it&#39;s time for bath, a meal, bed, <br/>
etc. I don&#39;t just turn it off arbitrarily just to be controlling.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s not able to say, &quot;I&#39;m tired, I need a nap&quot; at her age, or &quot;I&#39;m <br/>
hungry, I need food.&quot; Although sometimes she has (smacks her lips to <br/>

cues that she&#39;s tired or hungry and make a judgement call. I can&#39;t just <br/>
decide not to feed her or not to put her down for naps or never leave <br/>
the house in order to let her watch TV.<br/>
<br/>
When she gets a little older I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll figure it out (sleepiness, <br/>
hunger) because I&#39;ll let her.<br/>

are in a safe place to &quot;let it all out.&quot;<br/>
There was an incident at the beach today that really upset my 9yo- <br/>
too many details to get into- but he held in the tears for a good <br/>
ten minutes until he was alone with me to tell me about it.  All it <br/>
took was me sitting close, rubbing his back, and sympathetically <br/>
listening/responding for the floodgates to burst, and he was much <br/>
happier afterward.  It was like the slate was clean again after his <br/>
feelings were expressed.  I &quot;let&quot; him cry, but in a good way.<br/>
It wouldn&#39;t have done any good, IMO, for me to have distracted him <br/>
or changed the subject to a happier one in order to keep him from <br/>
crying.  What he needed was a cry.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s different from &quot;letting&quot; someone cry after *you&#39;re* the one <br/>
who&#39;s given him a reason to do so (as is the case with a baby alone <br/>
in a crib and not picked up on cue).<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-871729438">She cannot eat with Elmo because we eat in the kitchen and there is no <br/>
DVD player in the kitchen. She cannot eat in the living room because <br/>
there is white wall to wall carpeting (not my idea) and she is only 15 <br/>
months old and she is a messy eater. She doesn&#39;t get the concept of &quot;if <br/>
you are neat you can eat in the living room and continue to watch <br/>
videos.&quot; Sometimes when I know she is hungry but I don&#39;t want to turn <br/>
off the video, I give her a piece of bread to eat while she watches. But <br/>
when the video ends, we go eat a meal in the kitchen. If it were up to <br/>
me, I would have a wood or linoleum floor that could be cleaned more <br/>
easily than carpet, but it&#39;s not my decision to make.<br/>
<br/>
So she watches her video 3 times in a row, or 4 different videos, or <br/>
what have you, and then when it&#39;s time to eat, we turn the TV off and go <br/>
in the kitchen. She cries sometimes, but it&#39;s just for a minute and it&#39;s <br/>
not every time. As soon as she is settled in her high chair she starts <br/>
pointing happily to all of the different foods she wants to eat because <br/>
she realizes she is hungry.<br/>
<br/>
She needs to take a bath every night because it is part of our &quot;winding <br/>
down&quot; routine for bed. She is a frequent waker at night, and the bath <br/>
can make the difference between waking 5 or more times and waking only <br/>
twice. She loves taking baths. She acts unhappy when the video ends, but <br/>
she starts to perk up as she sees the water filling the tub. Once she is <br/>
in the bath with all of her bath toys and bubbles she has a blast. Why <br/>
would I want to deny her that so she can watch a video a 4th or 5th time?<br/>
<br/>
She cannot fall asleep with Elmo because that&#39;s not the kind of kid she <br/>
is. No matter how tired she is, she would *never* just doze off in front <br/>
of a video. She would sit there crying, rubbing her eyes, pulling on her <br/>
ears and her hair first. Why would I do that to her? She requires a <br/>
routine in order to get the idea that it&#39;s time to go to bed. It&#39;s not <br/>
based on the clock. I pay attention to her cues. No matter how early it <br/>
is, if she seems tired, then we start the routine.  Usually I read her <br/>
correctly, but if I made a mistake and she isn&#39;t sleepy after all, then <br/>
we get up and play or read more books until she really is sleepy.<br/>
<br/>
If she doesn&#39;t seem tired I let her stay up until she is. But if she <br/>
gets overtired she takes even longer to fall asleep, she gets very poor <br/>
sleep, and is in a very bad mood the next day, as am I from being woken <br/>
so frequently. So I have to wait until she is tired, but not too tired <br/>
to start the winding down routine.<br/>
<br/>
I give my daughter what she needs when she needs it, and what she wants <br/>
when she wants it (within reason). I let her decide what to eat and how <br/>
much to eat for example. I let her choose what books we read and how <br/>
many times we read them. I let her decide what video to watch and how <br/>
many times to watch it until as I said before, it&#39;s just time to move on <br/>
for the reasons I&#39;ve mentioned. It&#39;s not arbitrary or controlling for <br/>
control&#39;s sake.<br/>
<br/>
I let her decide when she wants to go outside and when she wants to come <br/>
back in, what toys she wants to play with, etc. etc. She is not capable <br/>
of deciding when it is time to eat yet or when it is time to go to bed. <br/>
When she is old enough to know what she needs in those areas, I will let <br/>
her decide. If she wants to skip a meal or a bath and watch TV instead, <br/>
that&#39;s her choice. But she is too young IMO to make that choice right <br/>
now.<br/>

Maybe just reading how it has gone with people whose unschooled kids are <br/>
older now, and what they wish they had done differently will help you more than <br/>
turning the list into a discussion of what to do with a baby.  I bet you have a <br/>
lot of good ideas, but maybe an attachment parenting list would be better for <br/>
you if you  need to share this much detail about how to deal with a 15 month <br/>
old.  It&#39;s really not, at that point, about unschooling.<br/>

<br/>
I could put down a &quot;splat mat&quot; in the living room but I don&#39;t have one. <br/>
I&#39;d have to buy one, and I don&#39;t get out much. Plus I&#39;m broke. Maybe my <br/>
MIL will get me one if I ask.<br/>
<br/>
The other issue is that I like to give DD lots of choices of what to <br/>
eat, and she is very opinionated. If I give her something she doesn&#39;t <br/>
want she sweeps it onto the floor with a very grand dramatic <br/>
gesture. ;-) So with her in the kitchen I can just reach into the fridge <br/>
or cabinet and hold things up and she shakes her head yes or no. I don&#39;t <br/>
really feel like it&#39;s worth it to make the trip back and forth to the <br/>
living room just so she can watch a video. It&#39;s a judgement call on my <br/>
part. Maybe most unschoolers would do this back and forth thing, <br/>
personally I&#39;d rather save my energy for something more fun. Did I <br/>
mention the frequent wakings? ;-)<br/>

She had absolutly no interest in any cartoons, children&#39;s shows, nada. <br/>
Something about his high voice appeals to her I guess, I don&#39;t know. But <br/>
she loves Elmo. She still won&#39;t watch anything else, I try every so <br/>
often just out of curiosity to see if she will. But even cartoons and <br/>
other kids&#39; shows do not grab or hold her attention at all. Even the <br/>
Elmo video (which is only like 35-40 minutes long) she will only sit <br/>
still -- or stand -- and watch it once through. Then she wants to see it <br/>
again and again, but she&#39;ll be mostly playing and listening, and like <br/>
you said, looking up now and then. But as soon as it&#39;s over she wants it <br/>
on again.<br/>
<br/>
Nine times out of ten I say yes. I&#39;m not worried about ADD or what have <br/>
you. She has an amazing attention span for such a youngster. She&#39;ll sit <br/>
and &quot;read&quot; by herself for a long time sometimes. It&#39;s so cute when she <br/>
picks up a magazine. She delicately turns the pages one by one and looks <br/>
at each page with a kind of bored expression. It&#39;s too cute.<br/>

nights if she is absorbed in something. But if I wait much longer than <br/>
that it ruins our night and the next day too.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, 4 nights out of 5 this child could REALLY use a bath. We <br/>
live on a farm. Need I say more?<br/>
