&lt;&lt; Is it really because they don&#39;t care that so many Americans don&#39;t vote? Or <br/>
<br/>
is it because they can&#39;t read the ballot? We tend to blame lackluster <br/>
<br/>
politicians or negative campaigning for low turnout at the polls. But what <br/>
<br/>
if the real reason is that most of our citizens are not sufficiently <br/>
<br/>
educated about the basic concepts of democracy to understand the issues – <br/>
<br/>
even those that directly impact their self interest? And what if that <br/>
<br/>
ignorance is compounded by illiteracy? &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I know enough math to know that in my case it wouldn&#39;t matter.  I quit voting <br/>
years ago.  Keith and a friend of mine who volunteers with the League of <br/>
Women Voters stuck a registration form in front of me a while back and then <br/>
stuck an absentee ballot in front of me a while later.  <br/>
<br/>
But statistically, assuming the people who don&#39;t vote are as representative a <br/>
sample of the constituency as those who DO vote, we could do with saving the <br/>
gas money.  I&#39;m better off at home with my kids than studying up on a bunch <br/>
of school bond issues and mil tax issues and city councilmen and judges, let <br/>
alone U.S. Senators, the governor or the president.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;For example, our public-school children hear that the Founding Fathers are <br/>
<br/>
not to be revered. They were greedy, patriarchal oppressors who were in it <br/>
<br/>
for the money and the power. America is not a noble experiment in freedom <br/>
<br/>
and equality. That was the cover story, as we stole the land from the <br/>
<br/>
indigenous people. America wasn&#39;t recently attacked by terrorists. America <br/>
<br/>
is the terrorist!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Gosh.  Is it possible for people to have balanced opinions?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Those deconstructionists have been very busy, because they didn&#39;t stop with <br/>
<br/>
the English language. They have also pretty successfully deconstructed <br/>
<br/>
family, religion, values, ethics and morality as well. We all know that, if <br/>
<br/>
there can be no right answers, there obviously is no right and wrong. No <br/>
<br/>
one&#39;s behavior can be judged because the most heinous acts can be excused <br/>
<br/>
on the basis of what the perpetrator may have suffered at the hands of his <br/>
<br/>
parents, the police, the inequitable society. Yada, yada, yada.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I bet $50 the writer was spanked lots and spanks.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make me prejudiced?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;God is dead (although the Wiccan goddess still has a fighting chance, I <br/>
<br/>
guess) – traditional morality is destructive; excellence is discredited and <br/>
<br/>
devalued; grades are antiquated. Discipline is discriminatory because <br/>
<br/>
there&#39;s no such thing as bad behavior, just children with &quot;special needs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Buried in that adrenalated crash of thoughts are some actual reasons it would <br/>
be good for school to back off!<br/>
<br/>
But unfortunately, people like that do give homeschooling a bad reputation, <br/>
and I&#39;m not proud to be associated with them.<br/>
