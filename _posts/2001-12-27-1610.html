<div id="ygrps-yiv-1359658724">This reminds me of a story in the Ramona series. We borrowed the movies from the library long ago.<br/>
The mom was serving &quot;mystery meat&quot; because it was cheap. And she wouldn&#39;t tell the kids what it was - just called it mystery meat. They all tasted it and thought it was weird and I think Ramona or her sister (Beezy?) finally figured out it was tongue. It&#39;s very funny in the movie.<br/>

  &gt;dinner just about on the table, and it was beef tongue.  She said &quot;I bet <br/>
  &gt;Keith misses having tongue.&quot;  I didn&#39;t say &quot;I bet he does NOT.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
  &gt;I said as neutrally and politely as I could that I wasn&#39;t going to eat any <br/>
  &gt;and she said with a kind of laugh in her voice (which she has at the very <br/>
  &gt;worst times) &quot;Yes you will.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-586494372">My Mother prepared tongue (beef) once a while as a<br/>
treat for herself.  I was totally grossed out, as were<br/>
my brothers. Was unable to eat the rest of the meal,<br/>
each time, either.  Still, I often didn&#39;t want to eat,<br/>
as a child, anyway. At least at those times (toungue<br/>
in cheek) she was being la grand&#39; damme&#39; rather than<br/>
Hansel and Gretle&#39;s witch. How &#39;bout escargo?<br/>
<br/>
We have a kid&#39;s cook book of all sorts of (to<br/>
us)unusuall foods. I also have an American Indian cook<br/>
book with foods that mostly seem like a LOT of bother.<br/>
Acorns take a lot of work. Poke Weed scares me.<br/>

think tongues are for? the lovely French princess said<br/>
it to her handmaiden.<br/>
<br/>
Then there is the Tower of Babel for those who speak<br/>
in many tongues.  And forked tongues , we know some<br/>
folks who possess this facial defect(however we don&#39;t<br/>
like to fork the tongue at table)  There is tongue<br/>
tied.....my shoes have tongues....there is tongue and<br/>
groove....<br/>
<br/>
Good thing you &quot;held your tongue&quot; when served the<br/>
tongue....what if you had actually .....what if you<br/>
stuck out your tongue ......<br/>
<br/>
Guess I better bite my tongue. I HAVE had plenty of<br/>
practice at that!!<br/>
