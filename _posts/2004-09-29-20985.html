<div id="ygrps-yiv-1754725924">Last night, Margaux asked me how the bubbles in soda get there.  I told her that I thought it was hydrogen dissolved in water.  Okay, that satisfied her...kinda sorta.<br/>
<br/>
This morning I saw a post on another list with this site: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.webelements.com/">http://www.webelements.com/</a> .  It&#39;s an interactive periodic table of elements.  I called Margaux back to take a look and we read number one on the table--Hydrogen.  She was all excited about it.  They showed a picture of the Hindenburg--she recognized the shape from watching Kiki&#39;s Delivery Service.  Then we moved on to Helium, then Yttrium, then Sodium.  With Sodium, we were able to watch a movie and see different colored flames, then read about what they mixed with the sodium to get those colors.  Hey, this is some insight into fireworks!  She wanted to see the crystal structure and we looked at their 3-D models.  Very interesting.  We tried to print out their periodic table, but their print-link didn&#39;t work.  So we looked into their store and Margaux wanted the poster.  We saw some books and clicked on the links which took us to Amazon.  There, of course, we saw a lot more recommended books.  We ordered a few, including Chemical Magic, which, of course, sparkled Margaux&#39;s eyes.  MAGIC!  Woohoo!  Amazon doesn&#39;t sell a periodic chart however, and the chart on the webelements site is being sold from Europe.  So, tomorrow, we&#39;ll set out to find a period chart for her room.  She said, &quot;When we get the periodic chart, I can be your teacher!&quot;  So, look what happened the day after she said she was bored!  Just like my friends, K & D, said, when an unschooled kid says s/he&#39;s bored, a learning burst is sure to follow.<br/>

Sounds like a great day! What a great example of connecting the dots! I <br/>
love moments like that.<br/>
<br/>
FWIW, I think it&#39;s CO2 in soda, not hydrogen, and that could lead to <br/>
lots of other interesting chemistry talks. Edmunds Scientifics probably <br/>
has some cool periodic tables, and I know you can get the tables on <br/>
t-shirts and other things. (dh is a chemist of sorts)  Dry Ice is CO2 in <br/>
solid form and can be loads of fun to play around with,too.<br/>
<br/>
Geomags, a magnetic rod and ball toy, are loads of fun to play with and <br/>
make great molecular models, of course so do gumdrops and marshmellows, <br/>
but I don&#39;t like those. *g*<br/>

<br/>
I asked Margaux what I told her, carbon dioxide or hydrogen, and both dh and she said CO2.  DH said, I would have noticed if you said hydrogen.  Phew.  I guess I was thinking something else when writing.  Oy... :&quot;)  We&#39;re setting out to buy a periodic table today.  I&#39;ve asked my local unschoolers for advice on where to buy, hoping to find a science store instead of having to patronize curriculum vendors...*gasp*.<br/>
<br/>
Ooo dry ice, and Halloween is coming up!  What fun.  Thanks for bringing these new wonderful ideas to us.  :o)<br/>

Did you check out Edmunds Scientifics? <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://scientificsonline.com/default.asp?sid=edsci&bhcd2=1096556965">http://scientificsonline.com/default.asp?sid=edsci&bhcd2=1096556965</a><br/>
<br/>
They are a fabulous company--real scientific equipment--that supplies <br/>
labs around the world. My grandfather used to make stuff for them, and I <br/>
know my husband&#39;s lab uses them regularly. We got a really cool digital <br/>
microscope from them that the kids love.<br/>
<br/>
On the dry ice:<br/>
<br/>
do one block in regular water<br/>
do another block in water and put a few drops of dish washing liquid <br/>
in--way cool!<br/>
<br/>
You can see a picture of my kids doing that here: <br/>

 <br/>
Well, we get ours from Westside Ice on Two Notch Road. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
Might be a long way to drive for ice, though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Check the yellow pages under &#39;ice&#39;. Call first. They sometimes need a  little <br/>
notice---they don&#39;t keep it/make it regularly here. It&#39;s more expensive  than <br/>
plain old ice too. <br/>
 <br/>
And take your cooler and some leather gloves with you. Easier to  <br/>
handle----and keeps it better.<br/>

Dh says it comes from a box in the hallway.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s not really sure where babies come frome either, which is why we <br/>
have three. *lol*  They have it delivered to lab, but he&#39;s not sure <br/>
where a regular supplier would be.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to check the phone book for chemical <br/>
suppliers--you know, helium and such. Call them and see if they sell it <br/>
or know where to get it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-163144824">Long long time ago, I used to watch some afternoon home-type show and there was a crafting segment each day.  The lady was always doing things with dry ice and I just assumed that it was easy to find and you could get it at a craft store.  Maybe not, huh?  I just typed in Dry Ice, Allen TX to google and came up with &quot;A Dry Ice Company&quot; based in Houston.  I wonder if they ship.<br/>

They just put in a dry ice cooler at the Smith&#39;s nearest us, regular old <br/>
grocery store!  Maybe it&#39;s temporary for Hallowe&#39;en, I don&#39;t know.  But other <br/>
times people go to the ice plant that makes the ice for convenience stores and get <br/>
it there.<br/>

Don&#39;t know if you got this question answered, but our grocery stores have  <br/>
dry ice (Kroger&#39;s).  It&#39;s usually in a freezer at the front of the  store.<br/>
