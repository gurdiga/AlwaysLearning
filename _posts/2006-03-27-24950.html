<div id="ygrps-yiv-357374512"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; &gt; Never been an issue for us, but  Adam (now 3)<br/>
&gt; &gt; did once call 911 by accident when chewing on the <br/>
&gt; phone...<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; ha ha i am waiting for that one.  Doesn&#39;t that<br/>
&gt; happen to  every parent at least once? LOL<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; No.<br/>
&gt; Three kids, freedom to use phones, no one called<br/>
&gt; 911. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think this was about freedom to use phones,<br/>
but about accidents. they happen, it&#39;s funny, it<br/>
doesn&#39;t matter. also, just because you don&#39;t use speed<br/>
dial at your own house, which I agree does make it<br/>
easier for such an accident to take place, doesn&#39;t<br/>
control what happens at another house. our 911<br/>
accidentally-placed call happened at my grandmother&#39;s.<br/>
the big explanation you described is pointless with<br/>
children who are too young to understand, which is<br/>
what I think we&#39;re talking about here. and no, I&#39;m not<br/>
underestimating my child! my son called 911 when he<br/>
was around 18 months old! <br/>
<br/>
I would also add that some folks have disabilities and<br/>
would need to have that on speed dial because of the<br/>
difficulty in using their hands. folks have the right<br/>
to choose to use their speed-dial, too, ya know ;)<br/>
