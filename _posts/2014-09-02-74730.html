<div id="ygrps-yiv-8235433">I love Always Learning, even though it became a little clunky when facebook &quot;improved&quot; itself.<br/>
I also love the blog &quot;Just Add Light and Stir,&quot; and it&#39;s four years old September 2 (when I wake up; I&#39;m writing at bedtime).  <br/>
There will be (tomorrow) a photo of the cake I will sacrifice tomorrow here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com">http://justaddlightandstir.blogspot.com</a><br/>

Here is something written yesterday, following on things written just a few years ago, about the usefulness of Always Learning, and some clues about how to use it. :-)<br/>

(Marta Pires&#39; first post is there.)<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;sacrifice cake&quot; means nothing to you, you might want to read here, and watch Spartacus, and think about finding something worth making a cake about!!  (or maybe not watch Spartacus...  Harry Potter has a cake, the first book and movie.)<br/>

Thank you to those who also enjoy Always Learning, and who jump in to help when questions or issues are brought!  There is always an evolution of what&#39;s the happenin&#39; thing, and yahoogroups is not it right now, but compared to facebook (where I also have a discussion), this one is stable and solid.   The other one is probably better if all you have is a phone, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1955081594">I want to give my most fervent thanks for the work you (and Joyce, and Pam) do here Sandra.<div><br></div><div>Whe I ask a question here, I know I won&#39;t be coddled, or treated as though I&#39;m fragile and easily hurt. &nbsp;I know I will receive straightforward, direct &nbsp;advice that has the best interests of my daughters at heart. &nbsp;I think this is almost the only place I can ask questions and not be able to predict the response. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I also know that the unconscious assumptions and biases I have will be exposed in the way I write and that these will also be pulled out and brought into the light for examination. &nbsp;And the more that happens - to me and other people writing here - the more able I am to do that for myself. &nbsp;And the better and more peaceful life gets for my family. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><br></div></div>
