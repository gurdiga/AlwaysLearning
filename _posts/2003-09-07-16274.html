<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995649750">I was trying to load a picture for my profile at unschooling.com <br/>
message boards and I couldn&#39;t get it to work, so I thought I would <br/>
try here to see if it was the picture I was trying to load.  It <br/>
worked here.<br/>
This is Sam and Jack.<br/>
This was taken just before Sammy died, and is one of my favorites.<br/>
