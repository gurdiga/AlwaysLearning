&lt;&lt; Anyway, I&#39;m told (my husband, Gary, is from Hawaii) that the reason it&#39;s <br/>
so popular there is that, being an island, for many years it was difficult and <br/>
expensive to get meat there -- even local beef was costly.  During the war <br/>
years (while my inlaws were growing up on the islands) Spam was widely available <br/>
in gov&#39;t shipments, so lotsa folks in Hawaii became very familiar with it.   &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard that too, and friends who do a lot of fancy Japanese cooking say <br/>
it&#39;s because it behaves as something or other (tofu?) that&#39;s common in Japanese <br/>
cooking, so they can just incorporate it into tons of existing recipes.<br/>
<br/>
I went to google and saw recipes listed but didn&#39;t find a really great site <br/>
to bring back here, but they&#39;re out there, just nothing seemed short and <br/>
straightforward.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-514733425">I could see Spam being substituted for extra firm tofu, with much the same texture, but tofu is pretty much flavorless where spam is kinda salty.  I don&#39;t know I&#39;m more likely to eat tofu than spam in a dish....... then with Japanese there&#39;s sushi, which I&#39;ve learned to eat, and sashemi (raw fish) which I have no desire to try!<br/>
