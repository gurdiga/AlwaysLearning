<div id="ygrps-yiv-220422746">I know you suggested off list, but my computer isn&#39;t being very <br/>
cooperative today.  There are many different &quot;shades&quot; to wicca and to <br/>
all the other neo-pagan practices.  For a decent overview that is easy <br/>
to understand, I would suggest &quot;Circle Round&quot; by Starhawk.  It is <br/>
actually written for parents with ideas, activities, stories to share <br/>
with their children.  It covers the basic idea of altars, magick, <br/>
sexuality, rites of passage, festivals, those kinds of things.<br/>
