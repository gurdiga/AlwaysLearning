<br/>
I might replace the first-draft-with-sharpies art (probably will), but  <br/>
I&#39;m really excited about this.  It has over 300 links, and will have  <br/>
more like 500, I believe, when I&#39;m finished.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unhappy:<br/>
<br/>
This list is to discuss unschooling.  It&#39;s not for the promotion of  <br/>
particular causes unrelated to unschooling.  It&#39;s not a giant bulletin  <br/>
board for anything in the whole wide world.  It is not for ANY (any at  <br/>
all) emergency action calls.  It is not for asking anyone to write to  <br/>
a congressman or to support an individual who&#39;s going through a court  <br/>
case.<br/>
<br/>
The whole world is out there, yes.   The whole world doesn&#39;t fit in  <br/>
here.   One of the things in the whole world is this list.  It is, as  <br/>
far as I know, the most on-topic and crap-free of all the unschooling  <br/>
lists, and I would like to keep it that way.  Every post I end up  <br/>
rejecting for not being directly about helping unschoolers understand  <br/>
unschooling better keeps me from doing what I want to do, which right  <br/>
now is working on that &quot;surprise me&quot; machine for unschoolers to find  <br/>
ideas they didn&#39;t even know they wanted to look for.<br/>
<br/>
And back to happy:<br/>
There&#39;s one on the food page, dedicated to that section of the site  <br/>
alone:<br/>

It *is* sort of like time travel... Dr. Who&#39;s telephone box.  Or being<br/>
transported ... Tank&#39;s phone call.  Hmm... there&#39;s a lot about phones in<br/>
that idea.<br/>

As I got into this response I thought it had nothing to do with  <br/>
unschooling and maybe I should take it to my blog instead, but it&#39;s a  <br/>
picture (in words, with links to images), of a typical project at my  <br/>
house, and it&#39;s things like this that help learning flow.  So I&#39;m  <br/>
leaving it.   And Bo went to school, but he&#39;s recovering by hanging  <br/>
out with us.<br/>

Thank you.<br/>
Me too, about finding things.  I&#39;m finding pages I need to reformat  <br/>
and update, and links that don&#39;t work, though I can&#39;t fix everything  <br/>
at once.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m always glad for e-mail notes about bad links or typos (though some  <br/>
of the natural typos in posts I leave, rather than editing quotes;  <br/>
sometimes I change things and sometimes I don&#39;t, if it seems useful as- <br/>
is).<br/>

<br/>
I smiled so big when you asked about The Matrix.  I&#39;ve seen it three  <br/>
times, but am not drawn to it.  My friend Bo, though, lives there.  <br/>
&lt;g&gt;   Bo is the one who did the happy trees I use as a link on most of  <br/>
my pages, and as an icon for the unschooling section.    He also did  <br/>
my anchoress (SCA reference), both of which can be seen at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com">http://sandradodd.com</a><br/>
<br/>
He did the art that&#39;s at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/violence/">http://sandradodd.com/violence/</a><br/>
I had requested a set of the kind of art boys draw in their notebooks  <br/>
during school.   He knew the stuff. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
And last night I asked Bo to consider re-doing my random page portal,  <br/>
maybe as a Dr. Who or Star Trek style thing, or whatever he wants.   <br/>
Maybe a better elevator.   He&#39;s coming over tomorrow to do that.  I  <br/>
sent him the link and he wrote<br/>
&quot;Haha, I love your idea. Opening a random page is kind of addicting,  <br/>
lol. Very neat Sandra.&quot;<br/>
&quot;I&#39;d be more than happy to help you. How soon do you need it? I have  <br/>
many things I&#39;m doing tomorrow but on Sunday I wanted to come hang out  <br/>
at your house and do art, so this would be a good time to fit that in!  <br/>
If it&#39;s urgent I can crank something out tonight, if it can wait until  <br/>
Sunday I can take my time at your house and give you something nice to  <br/>
scan.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Bo&#39;s been doing Shrinky Dink stuff with Holly, and they&#39;ve been doing  <br/>
enlargement art with a couple of opaque projectors I bought many years  <br/>
ago for putting small heraldic art on banners and tabards for SCA  <br/>
purposes, before photocopiers enlarged so easily and inexpensively.<br/>
<br/>
Most of my special art for webpages has been done by Holly, in varied  <br/>
styles over the years:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/art/title/hollytitles">http://sandradodd.com/art/title/hollytitles</a><br/>
I especially like the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;control&quot; for their joy and promise,  <br/>
and spooky harshness, respectively.<br/>
I&#39;m sure a few are missing from that collection.<br/>
<br/>
I did the logos for the lyrics game and the chatroom, which I did much  <br/>
more carefully than I did that elevator. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
(those also show at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com">http://sandradodd.com</a> )<br/>
<br/>
Bo is this guy, to the right in this photo of some of Pam&#39;s kids and  <br/>
some of mine:<br/>

and here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/bo">http://sandradodd.com/bo</a><br/>
Kirby took that photo, standing near where Pam Sorooshian was at her  <br/>
computer at another table.  So for me, the &quot;picture&quot; includes Kirby  <br/>
and Pam, too.<br/>
<br/>
Bo thinks more visually than anyone I know and I&#39;m glad he&#39;s willing  <br/>
to help me out even though he&#39;s not an unschooler.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-775443677">Ha..  a positively cool black hole where one is wisked into, where things<br/>
get changed and rearranged, and I am never the same again.  :D  That&#39;s<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Beam us up Scotty.  (I had the thought also unschooling related of Scott&#39;s<br/>
blog post &quot;Duality, Part Deux&quot; by Laura B&#39;s husband on RUN)<br/>
<br/>
There are all kinds of ways to be transported and many of them can lead to<br/>
unschooling.<br/>
