<div id="ygrps-yiv-801994080">I didn&#39;t realize I had an option on how the blog where the lyrics  <br/>
game is was set up.  (Terrible sentence; sorry.)<br/>

If any of you went there and didn&#39;t want to mess with signing up for  <br/>
a google account to play, I have changed that requirement.   Maybe  <br/>
try again, if you want.<br/>
