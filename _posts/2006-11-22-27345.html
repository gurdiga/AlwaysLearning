<div id="ygrps-yiv-249687896">My &quot;Unschooling&quot; google alert turned up this gem: http:// <br/>
www.nashvillescene.com/Stories/Columns/Suburban_Turmoil/2006/11/23/ <br/>
Alternative_Learning/index.shtml<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a very sarcastic parody of someone&#39;s idea of unschooling.  I  <br/>
thought it was very mean-spirited and demeaning to her children.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1569988047">Aw c&#39;mon, she thinks she&#39;s being trendy and funny!  <br/>
   <br/>
  What amazes me is how eager people are to &#39;show&#39; that they are incapable of spending any time with their kids, and how incapable their kids are of learning anything that&#39;s not forced into their heads by someone better qualified for the job than Mom.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Then again, who cares what she thinks anyway?  If that&#39;s as clever and involved as she can be, it&#39;s a good thing her kids go to school. <br/>
