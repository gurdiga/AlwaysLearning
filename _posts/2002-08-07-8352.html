<div id="ygrps-yiv-683698192">&quot;I wonder why I feel so negative about this?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I totally understand. There&#39;s an apprehension when you know how <br/>
another person runs things and you&#39;re going to be involved being <br/>
totally aware that it&#39;s not going to fit your philosophies.<br/>
We signed up for a snake &quot;unit study&quot; with a small group of 4 or 5 <br/>
other families about three years ago. This was before I was totally <br/>
unschooling, but still had those philosophies. I&#39;d say we were more <br/>
eclectic/relaxed homeschoolers.<br/>
I msut have seemed like an unschooler to them because I wouldn&#39;t make <br/>
my kids do all the stuff the other kids were getting rammed down <br/>
their throats.<br/>
How it turned out, was I let my kids take from it what they enjoyed <br/>
and not do the rest. I didn&#39;t let them be disruptive to the other <br/>
members during things they didn&#39;t want to do, but they understood.<br/>
It turned into this awful class style, so to counter that I just told <br/>
my kids to wait patiently for a fun activity and if they could just <br/>
be quiet enough for the others participating that was enough.<br/>
While several moms got up and did a &quot;report&quot; (lecture) on a <br/>
particular snake, the kids were supposed to take notes and at the end <br/>
they&#39;d have this snake journal.<br/>
Well my boys were 6 and 9 at the time and not even vaguely interested <br/>
in taking notes. So they didn&#39;t. This really pissed off a first year <br/>
homeschooler that is SUPER controlling.<br/>
So then the art project for the day......<br/>
They were supposed to make a particular snake, not just do art for <br/>
the sake of fun. My boys whispered &quot;do we have to do it like she says <br/>
Mom?&quot; I replied of course not, it&#39;s your project and art is about <br/>
doint what you enjoy, do whatever kind of snake thingy you want.<br/>
Well, Trevor was getting into his project, totally enjoying himself <br/>
and obviously NOT making the snake they were supposed to, when she <br/>
comes along and informs him he&#39;s doing it wrong.<br/>
His reply?<br/>
&quot;My Mom said we could do whatever we wanted.&quot;<br/>
OOOOOH! You should have seen the glares I got at that point. I mean, <br/>
if my child could do what he wanted, that really messes up the <br/>
thoughtless following process the other kids were doing. ugh.<br/>
After the class, I did explain to her why I told them that and shared <br/>
some of our homeschooling philosophies. She was totally confused. <br/>
Another Mom explained the Charlotte Mason method and helped her <br/>
understand a bit more. She didn&#39;t get it to say the least, but <br/>
strangely enough, she&#39;s lost some of her rough edges and we still <br/>
stay in touch. She understands how I homeschool and would never dream <br/>
of encroaching on that again, but she still thinks I&#39;m a bubble short <br/>
of plumb!<br/>
<br/>
The point is (there really is one, I swear) is that you can <br/>
participate in these things and gain from them. As long as your kids <br/>
stay interested and have fun, don&#39;t worry about it. Yes, do it right <br/>
along with them. If there is something they don&#39;t want to do, don&#39;t <br/>
make them. Or adapt it. Like the art project we &quot;adapted&quot;....if you <br/>
let them do the activities in their own way, even if it wasn&#39;t <br/>
exactly what the leader envisioned, they will get something out of it.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I would love to take the class!!! It sounds awesome. I <br/>
just might do my own version here.<br/>
Any time I can combine History and food, I&#39;m a happy camper.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Ren, this class sounds just like your snake class.  Each mother is <br/>
supposed to be responsible for giving at least two lectures and the <br/>
kids are supposed to take notes, because of course they *need* to <br/>
learn how to take notes.<br/>
<br/>
I was also told by one of the moms participating in the class that <br/>
the woman organizing it has said she feels it is important that all <br/>
the kids do what is asked of them.<br/>
<br/>
Given some of this additional information, I feel I should ask the <br/>
mom organizing the class if she would still want Allison and Virginia <br/>
to participate if they decide not to do some of the assignments or <br/>
the note taking.<br/>
<br/>
I would hope that homeschoolers as well as public schoolers would be <br/>
tolerant of the beliefs that unschoolers have about learning just <br/>
like most people are tolerant of different religious beliefs.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Really, really good points Ren. This whole situation reminds me of how<br/>
homeschooling is portrayed in the _Monster in the Attic_ book series. We got<br/>
them from the library because we heard there were had a homeschooled main<br/>
character. My oldest read them pretty fast, one after another and I read them<br/>
aloud to my seven year old. Book after book described painful and coercive<br/>
learning experiences just as you have described. It was excruciating to read<br/>
them aloud! My youngest liked them because she really liked the idea of<br/>
stuffed animals coming alive (the best part of the books) but the homeschool<br/>
stuff was just awful.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh Icky Pat.  I can see why you are leery of this. <br/>
Personally I would not do it.  It sounds like the IDEA<br/>
would be a lot of fun, but I am not the type of person<br/>
who enjoys or deals well with conflict and stress. <br/>
Something about too much of it in my life previously. <br/>
I would probably be more inclined to create our OWN<br/>
activities and invite the others to come to them, so I<br/>
didn&#39;t feel like I was invading someone else&#39;s show<br/>
and raining on their parade.<br/>
<br/>
Let me see..., I might put together a play or musical<br/>
presentation as a &quot;Journey Down the Silk Road&quot; and<br/>
invite them to attend or participate, seperate from<br/>
the class.  Or I might hold a dinner where each family<br/>
brings an appropriate dish, and I make several, and<br/>
have fun activities and tidbits of information, music,<br/>
bolts of silk of different types out, other trade<br/>
goods, etc.  My parents have been involved with<br/>
gourmet clubs for 30 years, where they hold pot luck<br/>
dinners that are culturally thematic.  They decorate<br/>
and research, cook and eat lots of exotic,<br/>
wonderfully, ethnic foods.  They do detailed<br/>
historical/cultural menus which are mailed out before<br/>
the event and the hosting family asks each<br/>
participating family to bring a certain dish from the<br/>
menu and recipes sent out.  This is all adults, but<br/>
they sure learn a lot about various cultural menus and<br/>
dining styles.  Maybe I would begin a Silk Roads<br/>
Gourmet Club, for kids AND adults, and get<br/>
participants to take turns hosting dinners once a<br/>
month or so from different regions along the Silk<br/>
Road, including other cultural/fun elements besides<br/>
food, like everyone bringing or wearing an example of<br/>
a trade item found along the silk road.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps I would put together an activity trunk to<br/>
share with others at a Silk Roads Picnic or play day. <br/>
I might research games that children and adults along<br/>
the Silk Road played, and share those, maybe have an<br/>
activity making some of the games.  Trips to arts<br/>
museums and cultural performances which are from those<br/>
regions would be a fantastic thing to do with others,<br/>
if such is available in your area.  I am sure that<br/>
given time I could think of other ways to participate<br/>
and get a lot out of it without interfering with their<br/>
&quot;schedule&quot; or their &quot;plan&quot; for their &quot;class.&quot;  That is<br/>
how I would hope to show them that there is another<br/>
way to approach the subject, or study in general.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like to get involved in things where I set out<br/>
knowing I will cause a problem and not be appreciated<br/>
or welcome.  I would rather host my own thing, and<br/>
invite others to come, than to go to an activity where<br/>
I will be uncomfortable and will make others<br/>
uncomfortable.  I would hope that others would be more<br/>
tolerant as well, but that is often not the case.  I<br/>
prefer a more gentle approach for expanding acceptance<br/>
and changing minds and hearts, unless of course I feel<br/>
that someone invaded MY party and was raining on MY<br/>
parade with their intolerance and control.  Then I<br/>
will fight like a cornered wolverine. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1103203260">OOOH!  You could fantasize with your kids about how to realistically <br/>
(historically-accurate fantasies, I mean by &quot;realistic&quot;) interact with the <br/>
Silk Road class without being in it.<br/>
<br/>
You could race them.  You could make a map and put pins in it for everything <br/>
you learn or connect to it between now and when they&#39;re done.  You could <br/>
watch videos about the places (some modern) and times (some other places).  <br/>
You could find travellers&#39; accounts of Europeans in the Middle East and Asia <br/>
from that period and get some great trivia and flavor.<br/>
<br/>
You could find all applicable restaurants in your town so you could do a food <br/>
tour without having to cook yourselves.<br/>
<br/>
You could ambush the class!! &lt;g&gt;  Come wrapped up like caravan robbers.  <br/>
Bring your documentation.<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if they&#39;re doing music?   I have friends who do Turkish and other <br/>
Middle Eastern music.  A group called Sazlar.  They have CDs at <br/>

&lt;&lt; There&#39;s something creepy weird about a group of mommys getting together<br/>
to decide what all their kids will do.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
See how far you&#39;ve moved into unschooling beliefs??<br/>
<br/>
I remember once when my oldest was just six or seven, someone came onto a <br/>
discussion list just bubbly with enthusiasm.  Giddy.    And she assured <br/>
someone else with feeling, &quot;You will be your child&#39;s only teacher!!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She saw that as a great and joyous advantage.<br/>
<br/>
That was creepy weird to me even then, but as my kids get older and I&#39;m not <br/>
even 1/4 of their source of information, I think how small their lives had <br/>
been if they&#39;d been dependent on me for everything they knew.  Or even me and <br/>
another group of homeschooling moms!<br/>
<br/>
It takes a while to move from that &quot;let&#39;s play school&quot; or &quot;we can do school <br/>
better&quot; mindset, and some don&#39;t have sufficient tether of mind to get that <br/>
far.  Then some cut the tether and fly away.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For a small local conference in a few weeks, there will be a panel <br/>
discussion.  They don&#39;t have a heavy curriculum-user for the panel.  I <br/>
suggested they either not bother to look for one at all, or try to find one <br/>
who had used a curriculum happily for at least ten years.  I don&#39;t think <br/>
there are such people.  There might be, but &quot;happily&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
I said if they don&#39;t find one one of us can just remind them that if they&#39;re <br/>
interested in a curriculum a salesman will be happy to spend two hours <br/>
extolling its virtues.<br/>

&gt;&gt;This<br/>
&gt;&gt;has been the meat of the Mother&#39;s Nights Out for the<br/>
&gt;&gt;summer. No kids allowed at Mother&#39;s Night Out. Mothers<br/>
&gt;&gt;planned the assignments, went home and passed out the<br/>
&gt;&gt;assignments.<br/>
&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;There&#39;s something creepy weird about a group of mommys getting together<br/>
&gt;to decide what all their kids will do. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The parents of my local &#39;group&#39;  - get together for chat and play about <br/>
once a month at someone&#39;s house if it&#39;s wet or cold, on the beach if <br/>
it&#39;s fine, so not really a Group, just a &#39;group&#39; - discovered that on <br/>
Wednesday nights between 5 and 7pm in winter most of us have our kids <br/>
either at badminton or karate so we decided to hold West Coast <br/>
Homeschoolers Executive Meetings on some of those nights, meeting at a <br/>
local cafe.  It was a bit unnerving for the new to the district <br/>
unschooling mum. We talked about homebirths and homeopathy and books and <br/>
sex and music and knitting and felt making and book binding and cooking <br/>
and eventually she asked about the meeting... We told her that this was <br/>
it, but that if any money was found on the floor she had to hand it over <br/>
to me as I had bagsed the job of treasurer in order to spend any such <br/>
found monies on another round of coffee and brownies &lt;g&gt;  She relaxed <br/>
after that &lt;g&gt;<br/>

&gt;wonderful. If I were more ambitious, and had more<br/>
&gt;resources I would do something like that here. Maybe<br/>
&gt;once I get to know some more of the homeschoolers <br/>
&gt;here, I can suggest something like this. We just<br/>
&gt;moved here this summer.<br/>
&gt;-Suzanna<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>LOL, well it sure would be great to have enthusiastic<br/>
participants.  We just moved early this Spring into a<br/>
new area ourselves.  My kids are also a bit young to<br/>
be involved in these kinds of activities.  I would<br/>
certainly persue them if my kids were older, and after<br/>
we have met other homeschoolers in the area and had<br/>
some folks to invite to our events and activities.<br/>
<br/>
Right now we are focusing on movie making.  I think my<br/>
older son will go into the movie industry.  He has an<br/>
electric passion for movies.  He adores DVDs with all<br/>
the &quot;Making of..&quot; and &quot;Behind the scenes&quot; special<br/>
features.  He creates whole sets with blocks and<br/>
people/animal toys and then plays out scenes complete<br/>
with dialogue and names for his actors and the<br/>
characters thay are playing.  He is very decisive<br/>
about exactly HOW everyone should move and who should<br/>
say what (Director??)  We have long discussion which<br/>
mainly consist of answering his myriad questions.  I<br/>
don&#39;t like going to the theater with him because he<br/>
talks through the entire movie, asking questions.  But<br/>
I still take him.<br/>
<br/>
I help him search online for movie information, film<br/>
websites, and etc.  I play movie trailers for him, and<br/>
interviews with the actors.  I play fanfilm parodies. <br/>
One of his favorites is TROOPS, which is done like<br/>
COPS with Storm Troopers: &quot;On location with the men of<br/>
the Imperial Forces.  All suspects are GUILTY! <br/>
Otherwise they wouldn&#39;t be suspect would they?&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Right now he is on a Lord of the Rings kick, since we<br/>
bought the first DVD.  In November, when the special 4<br/>
disc edition with all the extra footage and more<br/>
special features comes out, we will get that as well. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
With my younger son, we are finding all sorts of ways<br/>
to practice letters and words, since that is what he<br/>
is interested in.  He also has a passion for trains,<br/>
so we try to get him books, videos and other media on<br/>
the subject.<br/>
<br/>
If my kids were a few years older I would do the Silk<br/>
Road thing, in fact, maybe I will file that away for<br/>
later on.  Right now their sense of history and<br/>
geography is severely limited by their inability to<br/>
have a real understanding of space and time. <br/>
Yesterday is a long time ago, and next week is an<br/>
eterniity.  Their cousin&#39;s house (5 hours away) is a<br/>
place they want to stop at after we go to the market,<br/>
and they are disappointed when I say it is too far.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I think when Dylan was four or so we had a discussion about learning.  My<br/>
husband noticed how Dylan would just take his plate to the sink after<br/>
dinner, just get up and do it, without being asked.  We talked then about<br/>
the possibility that everything could be learned that way, by just living<br/>
and participating and being involved.  We decided not to cram &quot;school&quot;<br/>
work down his throat.   We were such radicals! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Now it seems funny to me when I hear unschoolers assign household chores<br/>
to their kids, because the observation about household stuff is what led<br/>
us to wondering about all the rest.  I suppose there is some point where<br/>
trusting math and reading can be learned without a curriculum leads those<br/>
folks to believing house work can be learned without chores.  Maybe we<br/>
were just backwards. <br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s true, we just keep sinking further and further into this belief.<br/>
 Happily.<br/>
<br/>
My friend who will be teaching science this year, his first, in Arkansas<br/>
called and was talking about workshops he had just attended for classroom<br/>
management. <br/>
How he&#39;s supposed to spend the first week introducing his students to his<br/>
rules and procedures and how he learned how to talk to teenagers.  The<br/>
way he was talking would make anyone think none of these kids were from<br/>
planet Earth.  <br/>
He really wants to stress to them how there is a procedure for everything<br/>
and when you follow the procedure you achieve success.<br/>
Kind of sad.   <br/>

<br/>
HEY!<br/>
I hadn&#39;t really thought about it this way, but before we even though of <br/>
homeschooling, we knew that Kirby AND Marty had learned to say please and <br/>
thank you just because Keith and I always said it to them and to each other.  <br/>
Even before we had kids, before we lived together, during, always...<br/>
<br/>
Also we were already letting them eat whatever and whenever, and we never <br/>
made them clean their plates or any of that.  It was when I was pregnant with <br/>
Holly that we went to Disneyland and hung around with grown childless friends <br/>
there and ordered pie as soon as we got in the restaurant.  They told us the <br/>
kids wouldn&#39;t eat other food if they ate pie.  PSHAW!!  They will, we said, <br/>
and this will keep them happy and we can stay here longer.<br/>
<br/>
Yep.  They ate pie a while, and then ate chicken and vegetables for dessert!!<br/>
<br/>
And THEN after we had that confidence we figured we&#39;d keep Kirby home instead <br/>
of sending him to kindergarten, and the next year our options would be:<br/>
send him to first grade if he wanted to go<br/>
keep homeschooling if it was going well<br/>
send him to kindergarten <br/>
<br/>
Tadaaa!! <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for jogging my memory about the order things happened with us!<br/>

I had read an article in Mothering Magazine long ago that said if you let <br/>
kids choose their own foods you avoid all the trauma and eating disorders.  I <br/>
think they are absolutely correct.<br/>

Some people think that if the kids don&#39;t eat the way the Super Perky<br/>
Nutritionists on Television claim we should all eat, they are not eating<br/>
food that is &quot;healthy enough&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Some people think that if the kids don&#39;t study subject categories in the<br/>
approved order at the approved age, they are not learning &quot;enough&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You provide the healthful choices alongside the<br/>
not-quite-so-fooditically-correct choices, without comment or critique, and<br/>
IMHO your child will eat what he needs along with what he wants.<br/>
<br/>
Breadsticks, noodles, a bit of carrot, and some pizza... those are pretty<br/>
good foods. The cupcakes and cookies? Well, they provide some calories for<br/>
energy and taste swell, and the surest way I know to make them craved and<br/>
gobbled is to deny them or limit them.<br/>
<br/>
In my freezer at this moment are a box of Push Up ice cream thingies and a<br/>
box of Ice Cream Sandwiches -- both half full. Some weeks, they&#39;d already be<br/>
gone, but these have been half-full for at least 10 days. I&#39;ll have to throw<br/>
them out soon.<br/>
<br/>
My children often eat in cycles. One day, it was nothing but apples. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
THAT one worried me. I was afraid they&#39;d been taken over by fruit-loving<br/>
Body Snatchers, especially the youngest, who has eaten no fruit before or<br/>
since, yet... still lives. ;)<br/>

Yes.  I think it&#39;s only when your parents are weird about foods that you<br/>
end up that way yourself.   Dylan eats just whatever he wants and he&#39;s<br/>
healthy and active and makes wise food choices.   He&#39;s never once been<br/>
sick on food either,  never eaten so much of something he made himself<br/>
ill.  This was a problem with my nieces in a house where treats were<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1212884794">But see, where is he getting the soda?  My kids get soda, if we go out <br/>
to eat or something, but at home, the choices are more limited--often to <br/>
water.  Gatorade if it&#39;s really hot, as it&#39;s been.  I just don&#39;t buy <br/>
cupcakes, cookies and such.  I don&#39;t care if they eat them but we don&#39;t <br/>
have the financial resources to waste on low nutrition, high calorie <br/>
junk food.  Of course, each kid usually gets a treat when we go shopping <br/>
and Lexie choose tastycakes, and Janene picked out chips, but tonight we <br/>
had salmon baked with cherries, shrimp sautéed with garlic, home grown <br/>
squash sautéed with garlic, and potatoes and brocoli, oven baked. <br/>
 Janene ate about 10 shrimp and some salmon and the brocoli.  I don&#39;t <br/>
worry about my kids&#39; diet at all, but I also don&#39;t have a bunch of junk <br/>
around the house.  <br/>
<br/>
I also think you have to totally let go of all food things.  Not label <br/>
food good or bad.  Just let them eat and not worry about it.  <br/>
<br/>
joylyn, off to make brownies--I don&#39;t have cookies in the house, but I <br/>
do have brownie mix!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-532044335">Dh insists that he &quot;needs&quot; soda.  Therefore, when it goes on sale for <br/>
68 cents, we buy 25 2 liter bottles at a time.  And again with the <br/>
tastycakes, dh is not a morning person but has a job that requires <br/>
him to leave the house at 5:30 am.  He doesn&#39;t want to get up earlier <br/>
in order to eat a healthy breakfast, so he just gets up 15 minutes <br/>
before he walks out the door and grabs a tastycake to eat in the car <br/>
on the way.  Those are dh&#39;s two big food insistinces.  We must have <br/>
coke and cupcakes at all times.  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Actually I have never ever said we can&#39;t afford it.  But each family <br/>
member gets to choose one thing.  Lexie had narrowed it down from <br/>
brocoli, tastycakes, and something else.  I can&#39;t remember.  Janene had <br/>
originally picked out a package of 8 small packages of chips, but later <br/>
I saw one that had 44 packages of chips, same brand, more variety in <br/>
chips, for just $2 more, so we got the better buy.  We don&#39;t buy soda, <br/>
or cookies at the store, but we do make cookies, brownies (remember, I&#39;m <br/>
going to go make some now, as soon as Mark finishes the dishes), etc. <br/>
 It&#39;s not really a treat, it&#39;s just that when we go to the store to buy <br/>
basic stuff, the kids get to pick something I dont&#39; have a coupon for <br/>
and isn&#39;t necessarily on sale and that we don&#39;t necessarily need, etc. <br/>
 They also picked out a few other things-ticktacks, (they were free as I <br/>
had a coupon for 55cents off, and the store doubles it and the price was <br/>
55 cents each), some gogurt yogurt thing, an off brand because the name <br/>
brand was nearly twice as expensive as the off brand so I said they <br/>
could get two of the off brand or one of the name brand and they aren&#39;t <br/>
stupid, let&#39;s see, what else did they pick.  Oh yes, the shrimp.  They <br/>
begged for that.  The salmon was on sale, for $3 a pound and the shrimp <br/>
was also on sale, for even less, so it was pretty cheap--the cherries <br/>
though, they were expensive, why are canned cherries so expensive!  It <br/>
was a good meal but we don&#39;t eat like that every day.  We also don&#39;t <br/>
deny kids food for expense.  For my birthday a few weeks ago we went to <br/>
red lobster and Janene, who is four, ordered lobster and veggies.  And <br/>
chocolate cake.  We had it all.  Lexie (7) ordered the shrimp plate off <br/>
the adult menu.  They don&#39;t order off the kid&#39;s menu.  What I meant by <br/>
spending my money wisely is that I generally don&#39;t buy soda and other <br/>
things.  If my kids want to choose soda that&#39;s fine with me.  I do limit <br/>
caffeine but I do see that more as a drug and they can always have the <br/>
noncaffiene choices.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll never forget one day at the store. we were going to leave the next <br/>
day for a few days and I didn&#39;t want to buy things that would go bad <br/>
while we were gone.  They had cpt crunch berries on sale, my favorite, <br/>
so we bought three boxes, one for each.  Then we got to the produce <br/>
dept.  I was going to get apples for the car, and maybe grapes, but the <br/>
girls kept begging for things.  Please mom, get us carrots. Mom get us <br/>
tomatos, please mom get us plums.  Please mom get us brocoli.  Finally I <br/>
hear myself saying loudly &quot;you already got your treat, capt crunch <br/>
berries, I am NOT buying you brocoli.&quot;  Got a few looks for that one.  <br/>
<br/>
One thing I do do that I probably shouldn&#39;t is I ask that things like <br/>
the chips and tasty cakes be saved for when we go places, like the park, <br/>
etc.  Just as I ask that bottled water be saved for going to the park, <br/>
trips in the car, etc.  But if they eat all the chips and tasty cakes <br/>
and stuff and there are none left for going to the park or the beach <br/>
then that&#39;s life.  I dont&#39; get bent out of shape over it.  <br/>

Pam, I like your educational analogy.  I have a question and I feel<br/>
like a school-at-homer asking &quot;what about math?&quot; ;)  But... what<br/>
about fiber and vitamins?<br/>
<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
Well, the fiber has had me stumped for quite awhile, I&#39;ll tell you (my<br/>
oldest daughter does regularly get a strong craving for huge green salads,<br/>
so that takes care of her, I think, but my youngest seems to have no<br/>
problems with the inner works in her fruit-and-veggie free diet -- and I do<br/>
very complacently expect that to change as she ages).<br/>
<br/>
Vitamins are easy, here: I ask them to eat a multi-vitamin every day. I<br/>
explain that this is a foible of mine as mommies sometimes lunge awake at<br/>
night worrying that their children might not grow up strong without a daily<br/>
vitamin,  and I beg the courts, (er, I mean the children&#39;s) indulgence, and<br/>
they humor me (and I think they do so directly because I&#39;m not constantly<br/>
yammering at them to eat or not eat this or that). They did flatly refuse to<br/>
eat the icky Costco brand chewables I dragged home one week &lt;g&gt; but we&#39;ve<br/>
compromised nicely as long as I bring home Pokemon or Flintstones.<br/>
<br/>
I know this isn&#39;t &quot;as good as&quot; getting vitamins from real food, but it&#39;s<br/>
painless. We do talk sometimes about what food is good for what nutritional<br/>
reasons. If they refused the vitamin, I&#39;d drop the issue like a hot rock and<br/>
probably grind it up into their brownies or sprinkle it on their Bagel<br/>
Bites. &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Wally and I made this eating decision - we won&#39;t sacrifice for our children<br/>
today&#39;s calm happiness in their eating choices against tomorrow&#39;s<br/>
possibilities and statistically-varying maybes. I give them choices and<br/>
trust them, and it seems to work for us. They definitely eat more &quot;junk&quot;<br/>
than a nutritionally-focused family would approve of, but I also see them<br/>
CHOOSING to eat more &quot;good food&quot; than the children in many of those<br/>
families, when said children ARE suddenly presented with &quot;choices&quot; -- as<br/>
someone (Deb?) said, mine have never made themselves sick gorging on<br/>
*anything* because they&#39;ve never had cause to think of chocolate as less<br/>
accessible than bread.<br/>

ice cream, chocolate raisins and a 1/4 pack of Oreos (that I will <br/>
have to throw away because they&#39;re probably stale by now!).  <br/>
Today we had instant pudding for the first time and Tamzin had a <br/>
few bites and didn&#39;t want anymore because it was too sweet <br/>
&lt;g&gt;.  I truly believe that if you don&#39;t restrict food choices they will <br/>
eat a balanced and overall a healthy diet.  <br/>
I also believe that you don&#39;t necessarily have to get all your <br/>
nutrients in one day.  I think that if your kid eats nothing but french <br/>
bread with butter on it for a day and then eats loads of fruit the <br/>
next day (as Tamzin did a few days ago at my mom&#39;s house <br/>
&lt;g&gt;), then it all evens out in the body in the long run.  I don&#39;t know <br/>
if I&#39;m making any sense about this to anyone, I&#39;m having a hard <br/>
time explaining it somehow.<br/>
I know, from two different friend&#39;s experiences, that you have to <br/>
allow time to de-food (just like de-schooling) if kids have been <br/>
used to having food controlled.<br/>
