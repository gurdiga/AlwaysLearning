<div id="ygrps-yiv-1647906076">hi everyone<br/>
<br/>
Just a quick note to let you know how the musicals are going.  My <br/>
classes are loving them.  We are doing a pretty intense (for 6th grade) <br/>
compare and contrast between Romeo and Juliet, and Westside Story.  I am <br/>
only showing portions of R&J, but the kids are really getting into the <br/>
language.  There&#39;s no fear of it.  I am reading a few vital scenes and <br/>
then we watch that portion of the movie.  Then we watch those parts of <br/>
Westside, but we are watching ALL of westside, not just a bit. Today we <br/>
compared the balcony scenes.  Tomorrow the weddings.  ANd the &quot;rumbles&quot;. <br/>
  It&#39;s very interesting to see the kids react to my reading.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
accused of memorizing R&J, and while I recognize that I LOVE that play <br/>
and have much of it committed to memory, or almost, I could not do it <br/>
without the book.  I&#39;m getting a big head, here, but it just shows you <br/>
that if the teacher is absolutely thrilled with teaching something that <br/>
she loves, that the kids will get into it as well!  However, I am glad <br/>
there are no adults watching.  I totally loose myself in the moment, and <br/>
act like I&#39;ve never done before!  It is also showing me that these <br/>
students can understand more than we often give them credit for being <br/>
able to understand.  Although they say that my own emphasis and body <br/>
language helps them understand the language, as well as the wonderful <br/>
actors in the movie.  Yes, they lack significant background and daily <br/>
knowledge our children get, but they are still capable beings and given <br/>
the right climate can succeed beyond their dreams.  It&#39;s neat to see <br/>
them leave saying &quot;parting is such sweet sorrow.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
We also have done Annie, and they are still going around singing &quot;Easy <br/>
Street&quot; and &quot;Hard Knock Life.&quot;  There is more music in this world than <br/>
rap!  Amazing!<br/>
<br/>
We may have an opportunity to see Kiss Me Kate, so I may be reading bits <br/>
of Taming of the Shrew, and then letting them watch the <br/>
Elizabeth/Richard version.  Oh what heaven this is for me, I have always <br/>
wished to teach Shakespeare! <br/>

Did anyone mention that the teen movie, Ten Things I Hate About You, is loosely based on Shrew?  It stars Julia Stiles and (mmmmmm) Heath Ledger.  I really like this movie, but I just like what I like;  I can&#39;t claim that my taste is refined.<br/>
