words are quite distracting, especially considering the topic of the<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-666011094">When I first came to homeschooling discussions online I had only read  <br/>
Growing Without Schooling and Teach Your Own, and I knew some  <br/>
homeschooling families.  I was surprised at how thrilled one mom was  <br/>
to describe her unschooling.  She didn&#39;t mind whether her son sat on  <br/>
the couch to read or in the yard! It didn&#39;t have to be at the kitchen  <br/>
table.<br/>
<br/>
This paragraph from that Bob sent made me think of that:<br/>
<br/>
-=-But what you find on this spectrum is what we call school at home  <br/>
on one end, which is what I just described, and then on the other end  <br/>
is the opposite.  It�s more of a bottom up rather than a top down.  <br/>
It�s actually engaging your children in a discussion, where you want  <br/>
to check to see what is their learning style?  Do they learn better  <br/>
when they�re jumping on the trampoline reciting the multiplication  <br/>
facts, or when they�re sitting with a workbook and memorizing flash  <br/>
cards and that sort of thing?  What is the learning style?  What are  <br/>
your children�s goals? What do they want to accomplish with their  <br/>
life?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter what a child&#39;s goals are or what they want to  <br/>
accomplish.  Odds are they haven&#39;t thought about it, or if they  have  <br/>
an idea or a plan it will change.  Marty used to want to be a police  <br/>
officer.  I treated it as a serious any-minute-now goal, but Keith  <br/>
wanted  me to discourage it.  It didn&#39;t matter either way, except  <br/>
that with support and being treated as someone who had a possible  <br/>
plan, it was all Marty&#39;s decision and doing when he changed his mind  <br/>
later.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter whether a particular kid learns better while  <br/>
jumping or humming or writing or listening to music, if you aren&#39;t in  <br/>
a hurry to stuff him with facts, and if you don&#39;t have rules against  <br/>
jumping, humming, writing or listening to music.  And it&#39;s really  <br/>
none of my business what my children&#39;s &quot;learning styles&quot; are.  That  <br/>
concept is probably twenty years old or more, and was all the rage  <br/>
among educators for a while in the 1980&#39;s.  Most people learn  <br/>
different things different ways anyway, so if someone is &quot;a visual  <br/>
learner&quot; she won&#39;t learn from a headset and a droning voice.  But it  <br/>
also doesn&#39;t mean she will learn everything in the world if she can  <br/>
see pictures on paper.  She might learn NOTHING if she doesn&#39;t have  <br/>
any idea what people are showing her pictures of, or why, or if she  <br/>
can&#39;t see the things in motion instead of flat and still, and  <br/>
probably EVERYone would do better if they could see a real example  <br/>
and moving pictures and still pictures, and hear about it, and maybe  <br/>
hear and touch and taste and smell.<br/>
<br/>
So unschooling works no matter what &quot;learning style&quot; or eventual  <br/>
goals any child has.  Provide a rich environment and encouragement  <br/>
and hang out with them to answer their questions and provide them  <br/>
with more stuff and ideas and they&#39;ll learn.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s one part.  I might get to other parts.  It&#39;s kind of daunting  <br/>
in its length, I agree with Dan.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-971241265">This is further comment on what Bob Collier found and brought:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://naturalmomstalkradio.com/blog/natural-moms-podcast-105/">http://naturalmomstalkradio.com/blog/natural-moms-podcast-105/</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Some kids, at a very young age, know very clearly what they want  <br/>
to be when they grow up, and they never change that.  You want to  <br/>
give them the honour and recognition that it is important that they  <br/>
are part of this decision.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Is it really honoring a child to say &quot;Oh.  Okay.  You want to be a  <br/>
ballerina,&quot; and then gearing all their lives toward that stated goal!?<br/>
<br/>
That paragraph kinda gave me a chill and made me think government  <br/>
school was a FANTASTIC idea in treating kids in such ways that any of  <br/>
them might want to be anything when they&#39;re older, so they all should  <br/>
know how some history, math, science, geography, writing...   (I  <br/>
remembered the bad parts of assembly line school and grading pretty  <br/>
quickly, but I think the plan of having a toddler &quot;declare a major&quot;  <br/>
is worse.)<br/>
<br/>
There are adults who were channeled or shunted toward &quot;air force  <br/>
pilot&quot; or &quot;Olympic swimmer&quot; or &quot;doctor&quot; and they get to the age of 30  <br/>
and for the first time they look around and wonder what they want to  <br/>
do now that the parent-powered assembly line has slowed down.<br/>
<br/>
Another quote from the transcript:<br/>
<br/>
-=-What happens with the school system is that there�s a mass  <br/>
educational technique, because when you have 30 kids and one teacher,  <br/>
you can only make them all do the same thing at the same time.  So  <br/>
that model has been followed even right into the home.  It�s  <br/>
something that at least needs to be looked at and questioned before  <br/>
deciding how you�re going to homeschool.-=-<br/>
<br/>
So she&#39;s talking about an individualized curriculum aimed at a small  <br/>
target.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think her definition of &quot;eclectic&quot; describes anything I&#39;ve  <br/>
ever heard, except &quot;contract learning,&quot; which is a school-reform  <br/>
concept from the late 1960&#39;s.  It was used some at the University of  <br/>
New Mexico (one could contract to get a B, at the beginning of the  <br/>
course, for example, and the requirements were different from those  <br/>
who wanted to get an A).<br/>
<br/>
I like this part:<br/>
-=-But also to understand that we�re just temporary guardians of  <br/>
these children.  They are their own person, and they come into the  <br/>
world with gifts and talents and abilities and all kinds of knowledge  <br/>
that they�ve brought in with them.  Our job is just to nurture them,  <br/>
and guide them, and help to expose them to what is available in this  <br/>
lifetime, in this experience, in this world that they�ve come in to.   <br/>
It�s more like a guide, not a dictator.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think through the years, the schools have gotten this concept of  <br/>
unschooling, and are now offering it through the school system to  <br/>
keep these dollars flowing through the system.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
The concept of unschooling came from the schools first.  It was  <br/>
called &quot;The Open Classroom,&quot; and John Holt was well familiar with  <br/>
it.  We unschoolers now who have truly and fully done it for the  <br/>
whole upbringing of people who are now adults have gone further than  <br/>
&quot;open classroom&quot; could because we weren&#39;t bound by physical buildings  <br/>
and school schedules and funding and interpersonal problems and our  <br/>
kids weren&#39;t affected by the measures and competition and other-kids  <br/>
nonsense that even the best of school reform couldn&#39;t eliminate.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think children are just as different as adults.  Some are very  <br/>
self disciplined.  I�ve seen the whole gamut of kids that are  <br/>
completely  unstructured and really  need to have somebody keeping  <br/>
them on task by their own admittance and by their own request.  Other  <br/>
students are extremely self disciplined from day one.  I�ll ask them  <br/>
what they�re going to do now that they�re not in school anymore, -=-<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a telling slip-up:<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think children are just as different as adults.  Some are very  <br/>

what they�re going to do now that they�re not in school anymore, -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;STUDENTS.&quot;  She&#39;s probably talking about people enrolled in her  <br/>
school, and then they are students and will have the tuition receipts  <br/>
to prove it.  And the unschooling she seems perhaps to be selling, I  <br/>
would call &quot;contract learning&quot; and &quot;individualized programs.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-He would love to stay up until midnight every night, but I see the  <br/>
dark circles and the impatience with his little brother that he�ll  <br/>
have the next day.  So I have to put some boundaries on that kind of  <br/>
behavior.  But not when it comes to his learning at all.-=-<br/>
<br/>
If they decide they want to learn more about what they &quot;have to&quot; do  <br/>
and what will happen if kids are allowed to stay up late, they&#39;re  <br/>
welcome to come to this list. &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1114559675">Today we&#39;re having Thanksgiving elsewhere.  Yesterday I made butter  <br/>
and today I&#39;m making bread (one batch is in the oven and the other is  <br/>
rising) and some orange/cranberry relish.  Tadaa!  Easy Thanksgiving.<br/>
<br/>
So I have time to read the interview transcript and here&#39;s some more  <br/>
commentary.  We could make a month on this stuff if we were out of  <br/>
real stuff to talk about here!<br/>
<br/>
-=-If the child chooses to do a math book and wants to get through it  <br/>
from beginning to end, that’s okay, it’s still unschooling.  If he  <br/>
chooses to go to public school for four years of high school, that’s  <br/>
still unschooling.  Why?  Because it’s the child’s choosing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Prior to that, the interviewer AND interviewee were badmouthing  <br/>
unschoolers letting their kids make choices.  I&#39;ve never defined  <br/>
unschooling as &quot;letting a child choose,&quot; but my kids do have lots of  <br/>
choices.  Tens of thousands over the course of a year, probably.  If  <br/>
my children chose public school or math books beginning to end, they  <br/>
would still be choosing, but they would be choosing not to unschool.<br/>
<br/>
What a weird little idea-trap it is to say &quot;It&#39;s still unschooling as  <br/>
long as the child wants to attend a Swiss boarding school for twelve  <br/>
years.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
[oh crap; I wrote the above, and then read two paragraphs down and  <br/>
found this:]<br/>
<br/>
-=-Then in seventh grade, she went off to another state and went to a  <br/>
boarding school for the entire seventh grade and part of eighth  <br/>
grade. -=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-So now, as an almost 15 year old going into grade 11, she kind of  <br/>
got ahead of herself, -=-<br/>
<br/>
Early in the transcript they were disparaging the question of people  <br/>
keeping up with others their age, so how can a child be &quot;ahead of  <br/>
herself&quot;?  I guess they meant ahead of other kids.<br/>
<br/>
Very inconsistent.  Lack of focus and clarity, but maybe a fine focus  <br/>
on spreading the idea that anything and everything is as good as  <br/>
anything and everything else, so that someone can make money running  <br/>
a school to help people homeschool.  By accepting money, she makes   <br/>
herself &quot;an expert.&quot;  And if an expert says unschooling is this or  <br/>
that, and people paid her to say so, what does that do for people  <br/>
like me, and Joyce?  We&#39;re not experts.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  So unschooling doesn’t have any look. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Clearly it doesn&#39;t to her.  That came from the center of this paragraph:<br/>
<br/>
-=-All these things, it doesn’t matter if the child is in college  <br/>
classes, some students take college classes, and they’re still  <br/>
unschooling.  So unschooling doesn’t have any look.  Like school at  <br/>
home, you think of kids sitting at the kitchen table, doing bookwork.  <br/>
That’s more of a look.-=-<br/>
<br/>
-=-But our job is not to teach.  It’s to facilitate the learning  <br/>
experiences, connecting our children to the right people and the  <br/>
right experiences, that will be their teachers.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She still can&#39;t conceive of there  not *being* teachers, but it&#39;s  <br/>
better not to, if you&#39;re charging money to reassure people that you  <br/>
can help them be or find teachers.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Let’s be a little forgiving to ourselves, too.  Most of us have  <br/>
not grown up as homeschoolers or unschoolers, we’ve grown up through  <br/>
the system-=-<br/>
<br/>
I assume she&#39;s going to tell people her daughter was homeschooled, or  <br/>
maybe that she was unschooled, even though she described her  <br/>
daughter&#39;s experience as starting off  homeschooling, going to a  <br/>
charter school, boarding school, homeschooled for a few months,  <br/>
public high school, school-sponsored homeschool program, and now  <br/>
travelling while &quot;having to&quot; keep a journal every day and write to  <br/>
her mom every day so they an make an eleventh grade transcript.  It&#39;s  <br/>
sounds fun to me, to have had all those experiences, but it doesn&#39;t  <br/>
make her mom knowledgeable about unschooling as it actually plays out  <br/>
in the long run.<br/>
<br/>
She also said<br/>
-=-With your first child you take that leap, and it starts to turn  <br/>
out okay, and so your second child, okay, that’s better.. And by the  <br/>
time the third one or the fourth or the fifth comes along, you feel  <br/>
like “Okay, I know what I’m doing.” And yet each one is different, so  <br/>
it’s never going to be a pattern, it’s always going to be unique and  <br/>
different and challenging.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She has one child, it seems.<br/>
I didn&#39;t change what I did with Marty and Holly.  I figured out  <br/>
something early on (found people who had already figured out most of  <br/>
it) that would work with anyone, and I worked to understand it and  <br/>
I&#39;ve stuck with it.<br/>
<br/>
OOOooooooh... Ooh.  Yikes.<br/>
<br/>
On her website, the business she runs (a private ISP cover school in  <br/>
California) it says:<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m Peggy Webb, director of the Academy, a 20-year homeschooling  <br/>
veteran and an unschooling specialist.<br/>
<br/>
Her daughter is fifteen.  How does that make her a 20 year  <br/>
homeschooling veteran?<br/>
<br/>
Okay, Bob.  I read it.  Kinda depressing.  But my kids are here and  <br/>
happy and other people&#39;s misconceptions don&#39;t change their lives!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1634752717">Sandra, it was great to read your analysis of this person&#39;s ideas because you clearly <br/>
demonstrated how muddied and half-realised her conception of unschooling is.  And as the <br/>
director of a private academy it&#39;s not hard to see why a schooled mentality permeates her <br/>
entire argument, even down to the terminology - &#39;students&#39;, &#39;transcripts&#39;, &#39;Math&#39;, etc. This <br/>
part of the transcript leapt out at me :<br/>
<br/>
- she claimed that radical unschoolers treat children as adults, &quot;without boundaries&quot;.  This <br/>
seems to be one of those mainstream parenting catchphrases - &#39;children need boundaries!&#39;.  <br/>
But in an unschooling family, children and adults are bound by the same things - mutual love <br/>
and respect, collaborative relationships, having fun - not silly and superficial things like set <br/>
bedtimes.  Both the interviewer and interviewee seemed quite keen on &#39;household rules&#39;, and <br/>
they probably feel like they are being responsible parents and creating the structure that <br/>
children supposedly need.  But why can&#39;t the structure be a peaceful, loving and stimulating <br/>
nest, rather than rigid rules?</div>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just read a book called Boundaries.  It defines boundaries as what <br/>
I will and will not do with my own body, time, heart.  It talks about <br/>
respecting other people&#39;s boundaries.  I think this concept of <br/>
boundaries is what kids need.  People see unschooling as lacking <br/>
boundaries, because they see *some* parents, often not even <br/>
unschoolers, &quot;respecting&quot; their kid to the point that everyone around <br/>
the kid is walking on eggshells, and the kid is hurting people and <br/>
things.  Parents need to have boundaries around themselves that <br/>
protect their body and things and sanity, and respect their kid&#39;s <br/>
boundaries as well.   <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a good book, just skip the &quot;boundaries with kids&quot; section.  It <br/>
totally contradicts everything else in the book and starts talking <br/>
about punishments and rules.  (rolls eyes)  But I found it helpful to <br/>
apply the adult to adult boundary concepts to my parenting.</div>
