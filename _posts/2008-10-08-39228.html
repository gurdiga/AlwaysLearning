<div id="ygrps-yiv-1021912740">I have introduced myself here before but just a recap- my kids are <br/>
ages 3 to 7.There are 4 of them.  <br/>
In the past months I have felt very unsatisfied with some of the <br/>
environments we end up with for social activities.  Seem like so <br/>
many of them center around some very preconscieved adult agenda.  <br/>
Some things seem to work but others just dont. Having 4 kids I need <br/>
to find things that work for all my kids at least to some degree.  <br/>
For ex.  we were asked to participate in a Kindergarten group.  I <br/>
felt the idea of it was kind of silly but it is really just a <br/>
playgroup with a few art or science activities on occasion so I <br/>
agreed. But I bring all my kids and spend alot of time trying to <br/>
find something for my 3 year old to do as he was deemed to young to <br/>
participate by the coordinator... it is a kindergarten group after <br/>
all.  My 7 year old, who really doesnt care about ages at all, is <br/>
also treated with some suspicion.  Anyway, That being all said I am <br/>
going to start fresh and start looking for and organizing some more <br/>
multiage activities.  For example I saw a multiage art activity <br/>
listed, they are making one specific thing but the idea was for <br/>
everyone to come with materials and ideas and enjoy the <br/>
experience.    I am trying to come up with more such ideas that a <br/>
range of kids could enjoy but not be so limiting.  Some fresh ideas <br/>
for field trips and such.  Any ideas for things you all have done?<br/>
Thanks</div>

for field trips and such. -=-<br/>
<br/>
How about just doing things with your own kids--hikes, picnics, trip  <br/>
to the zoo or museum, or walking around a shopping area?   Being out  <br/>
in the world frequently, on your own terms, on your own schedule,  <br/>
will bring lots of learning and relationship growth.<br/>
<br/>
In the context of unschooling, &quot;field trip&quot; doesn&#39;t have much  <br/>
validity.  You&#39;re not living in classrooms, so the excitement of  <br/>
getting out once or twice a year to see the real world isn&#39;t a clear  <br/>
and worthy goal.   Visiting workplaces or projects could be part of  <br/>
regular real life.<br/>
<br/>
Along the way, maybe you&#39;ll find another family or two to do things  <br/>
with you.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Like a park day or playgroup but with projects?<br/>
<br/>
Rhythm music (shakers and percussion things to play along with  <br/>
something recorded, or maybe one of the parents plays and instrument  <br/>
or could sing songs that could use percussion)<br/>
<br/>
Singing rounds<br/>
<br/>
Running/chase/hiding games; circle games<br/>
<br/>
playdough or clay sculpting day (something inexpensive and not too  <br/>
messy)<br/>
<br/>
Painting on something like an unfinished wall or wooden fence with  <br/>
tempera and fat brushes<br/>
<br/>
If you think of projects that aren&#39;t too prissy and exact, where kids  <br/>
who are tired of it can wander off a bit and the others would stay,  <br/>
there would be less to negotiate with other parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-173300631">Hi Verna<br/>
<br/>
One of our local home school groups had an open art studio with children of all ages 2-14 mostly for the first time yesterday.  Everyone brought some or a lot of supplies and let every one go to town.  It was really fun, authentic, and invigorating.  If or when the children want to delve deeper into art, art theory,or want help with expressing some of their ideas there are people there to assist.  I saw amazing art taking place, drawing, painting, creating a home out of card board and other recycled materials.  The plan is to meet once or twice a week with the option of putting on an art exhibit in a few months.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; find something for my 3 year old to do as he was deemed to young to <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That good ole&#39; segregate them by age thing again.  It&#39;s amazing how persistent this thinking <br/>
is amongst homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids have enjoyed doing things and playing with toys that are deemed &quot;too <br/>
young&quot; for them.  And we&#39;ve found that sometimes same age playmates work, and <br/>
sometimes they don&#39;t.  Sometimes multi age works, and sometimes not--it just all depends <br/>
of the chemistry, interests and activities going on.  Right now, playing with boys seems to go <br/>
more smoothly than playing with girls for my 9 yo daughter when we are in groups.<br/>
<br/>
Some things that have worked for us have been videogame days and just plain game days <br/>
where lots of games are available for playing. <br/>

is finding families that allow or even tolerate video games.  My kids <br/>
have alot of interests and that is deffinately one of them and my two <br/>
older boys (just 5 and 7) miss having friends that share this interest <br/>
that can play during the day time.</div>
