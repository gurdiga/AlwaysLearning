&gt;<br/>
&gt; It&#39;s <br/>
&gt;just that my family has way more time to spend with her, as a family, <br/>
&gt;and even my kids have a lot more opportunities to be with her, <br/>
&gt;because of unschooling, and we both hate feeling like we have to hold <br/>
&gt;back on the opportunities because of my nieces feelings, but there it<br/>
&gt;is.  Should we be insensative to a 12 yo? <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I read this whole situation and this is what I think.  I think if your <br/>
family has the privilege to visit with Grandma whenever and wherever, <br/>
then you should take advantage of it at your pleasure.  The relationship <br/>
is between you and Grandma...other people don&#39;t get to interfere with <br/>
that *on purpose*.  Of course, if you have practical reasons not to see <br/>
Grandma at the same time as your neice, such as there would not be <br/>
enough sleeping room or everyone can&#39;t fit in the car, then obviously, <br/>
another person is &quot;interfering&quot; with your relationship with Grandma in a <br/>
sense.  But it&#39;s not deliberate, and it can all be worked out.  <br/>
<br/>
My brother and his wife and two daughters live 5 miles from my father <br/>
and his wife and 2 dogs.  I live 300 miles from our father.  I visited <br/>
my father 3 or 4 times last year, as I do every year.  My brother could <br/>
stop by at any time.  He did so *once* in all of 2001.  My dad never saw <br/>
his daughter-in-law or the youngest girl the whole year.  They don&#39;t see <br/>
my family being in town as an opportunity to visit our dad, either.  The <br/>
*reason* they don&#39;t want to go there is because they don&#39;t like his <br/>
wife, or her children.  Her children are grown and gone with families of <br/>
their own, and she works full-time and Dad is retired.  There&#39;s a slight <br/>
possibility that my brother might accidentally be visiting when her <br/>
children show up to visit or she gets home for work.  That&#39;s what keeps <br/>
my brother away.  <br/>
<br/>
Is that just the most inane reason in the world or what?  Of course, I <br/>
know that the reasons are deeper than that, in a psychological sense. <br/>
 He&#39;s incredibly intolerant, etc.  A snob, basically.  The point is, <br/>
he&#39;d rather hurt his father and deprive his children of a relationship <br/>
with a wonderful person for a lifetime, to avoid spending 20 minutes <br/>
with people he considers white trash. (And the dogs--he hates the dogs, <br/>
who are terriers and excitable.  When he goes he won&#39;t push the dogs off <br/>
of him like everyone else in the house does, because he thinks our dad&#39;s <br/>
feelings are so tender towards the dogs that dad would just melt in a <br/>
puddle of pain if he did push them off.  So he doesn&#39;t go.  Which hurts <br/>
my dad&#39;s feelings and would be much more likely to melt my dad into a <br/>
puddle, which is much less likely than anyone thinks!)<br/>
<br/>
Can you tell I&#39;m a little ticked off about this situation?  :)  <br/>
<br/>
I realize that this situation is extreme and a little different than <br/>
yours.  But the point is that I&#39;m not going to let my step-mom and her <br/>
children keep me from a relationship with my father.  (I love the dogs <br/>
and have a matching set. &lt;g&gt;)  I don&#39;t think you&#39;re being insensitive to <br/>
your neice.  I think she should learn to be a little more sensitive <br/>
others and learn to live and let live.  I thought it was incredibly nice <br/>
of you in a bending-over-backwards sort of way to change your Easter <br/>
trip.  But I don&#39;t think it was necessary.  You&#39;re a much nicer person <br/>
than I would be!  lol.<br/>
