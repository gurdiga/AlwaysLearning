<div id="ygrps-yiv-2060093231">Linnaea loved the Hairy Maclary book and I read it over and over to her. We <br/>
were in the U.S. at the time, so the video wasn&#39;t available. But in the UK <br/>
there are lots of Hairy Maclary things. She loved Slinky Malinki (and <br/>
looking at Lynley Dodd&#39;s page there is a new Slinky Malinki book out that <br/>
maybe I&#39;ll just get) as well. The rhythm of it was so wonderful. Can you get <br/>
more stuff like whatever the video is? Can you get the Hairy Maclary stuffed <br/>
animals? or books and put them out where your son will see them? there&#39;s a <br/>
coloring book at amazon.co.uk that you could do with him? Instead of seeing <br/>
this love of the video as a bad thing can you expand on it? Can you find <br/>
other videos that have a similiar pattern, cadence to them?<br/>
<br/>
He loves this thing. He loves it enough to want to memorize it, make it a <br/>
part of him, consume it utterly. I don&#39;t think that you should be looking to <br/>
separate him from this love, instead you should find ways of helping him <br/>
satiate his desire. And maybe by showing him more facets of something like <br/>
the world of Hairy Maclary of Donaldson&#39;s dairy you will be doing just that.<br/>
