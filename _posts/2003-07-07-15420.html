<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Here&#39;s what happened:  The girls were watching an episode of Zoom on <br/>
&gt; Nickelodeon (a pre-teen show where they show games, experiments, and <br/>
&gt; projects).  They came to find me, all excited, to show me this:  stand <br/>
&gt; facing a wall so that one outstretched hand can just touch the wall by <br/>
&gt; the tips of your fingers.  Touch the wall.  Now bend that same arm quite <br/>
&gt; hard and rub your elbow with the other hand.  Now try to touch the wall <br/>
&gt; again with the original arm.  Your arm won&#39;t reach.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So the girls and I thought this was amazing and wierd and we ran all <br/>
&gt; over the house doing it over and over.  We called the grandparents and <br/>
&gt; all our friends to have them do it.  It was fun and strange. I was <br/>
&gt; wondering why this happened and thought a lot about it.  As usual, I was <br/>
&gt; talking about the hows and whys to the girls.  I finally decided that it <br/>
&gt; must happen because when the arm is bent, the muscle contracts and <br/>
&gt; doesn&#39;t completely stretch out right away, thus making the arm appear <br/>
&gt; magically shorter.  Makes sense to me.  The whole elbow rubbing thing is <br/>
&gt; just for drama, like a magicians waving wand.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Then Aislinn burst into tears and was furious with me for ruining the <br/>
&gt; fun.  Since I had figured it out, the magic of it was gone.  And I felt <br/>
&gt; SO bad.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah, this is such a cool post, even though I know you felt awful at the time.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it brings up the uses of religion/spirituality (I&#39;m a Unitarian <br/>
Universalist, and those things are not different for me, although I know they are <br/>
for some) and science. Both are ways that people try to make sense of the world <br/>
for themselves. And as cold and precise as scientists rep is, the joy as they <br/>
learn more about their topic of interest is often as wonderful as someone&#39;s <br/>
experience of enlightenment or finding God, or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I know you felt bad, but what I see is that your daughter was still in <br/>
the awe of this discovery. She loved it just for her experience of awe. You <br/>
loved it too, and like a scientist, your love drove you to want to find out all <br/>
about it. I suspect that your figuring out the Why of it didn&#39;t make you love <br/>
it any less, which is why you excitedly shared it with your daughter. I&#39;m <br/>
sorry for both of you that it worked out the way it did, because you were both <br/>
sad.<br/>
<br/>
For me, it&#39;s like a new relationship. When you first fall in love with <br/>
someone, it&#39;s ...well.. awesome. They seem perfect, and you&#39;re amazed that anyone <br/>
this perfect is just wandering about, and that somehow they love YOU!  Then you <br/>
discover chinks in the perfection. Over lots of time, you&#39;re aware that the <br/>
chinks are actually enormous gaps...but that you actually like that more! (It&#39;s <br/>
hard to ever feel really comfortable with a God/Goddess)  The first time your <br/>
Beloved, watching tv, burps loudly and you giggle and feel a flash of <br/>
endearment, you&#39;re hooked and you KNOW this person. That initial awe rush is <br/>
wonderful...but the Knowing is why you stay.<br/>
<br/>
My partner and I have spent the last year working on a curriculum for the <br/>
Religious Education program at our church (and will now be field-tested across <br/>
the country by some other churches) about Science and Religion. The topic was <br/>
actually the result of my asking the kids at church (from little ones to <br/>
teenagers) and getting a resounding &quot;Science!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Well, I realized that in one of the parts of the &quot;sources&quot; of UUism is that <br/>
we respect the teachings of science. Well, that&#39;s a pretty radical position of <br/>
a religion, so, apparently, the kids were right on. We had two different kinds <br/>
of &quot;lessons.&quot; (That&#39;s in quotes because as we did this, we realized that most <br/>
of the stuff was new to the Adult volunteers as well as the kids, and they <br/>
were all learning together rather than have wisdom imparted.) One type was <br/>
learning about UU scientists in history. (Lots of cool ones, and you may be using <br/>
the inventions of two of them RIGHT NOW!!!!)<br/>
<br/>
The other type was about exactly what you are talking about: Awe and <br/>
discovery. One of the things they did was about geodes. They each got a complete geode <br/>
and examined it, then they broke them open to find the crystals. Then they <br/>
learned a bit about how they&#39;re made. Knowing how they&#39;re made doesn&#39;t make them <br/>
less amazing... and doesn&#39;t need to take them away from the awe.<br/>
<br/>
I suspect your daughter would have gotten to a point where she wondered about <br/>
the Why. Probably depends how old she is, because little ones tend to <br/>
appreciate the magic of not knowing longer.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing this... Obviously I&#39;ve REALLY gotten into this stuff :)<br/>

don&#39;t, a cool, free resource is the Experiment of the Week yahoo list.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a different arm trick from the list (I never clean out my Outlook<br/>
files &lt;g&gt;):  <br/>
<br/>
 Robert Krampf&#39;s Experiment of the Week<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>

This Week&#39;s Experiment - #316 Arm Raising<br/>
<br/>
What a nice week this has been.   I still did not get the truck cleaned out,<br/>
but I did get a lot of other things accomplished.   I helped Lisa in the<br/>
garden, worked on training our dog, did lots of paperwork, and watched lots<br/>
of movies.   For the next two weeks I will be doing shows in the area around<br/>
Ft. Myers and Naples, Florida.   We still have some openings in this area,<br/>
so <br/>
if you know of a school or homeschool group that would like a show, let me<br/>
know.   You can e-mail me or call James Ashley at (904) 388-6381.<br/>
<br/>
This week&#39;s experiment is something that we used do for fun when I was a<br/>
kid. <br/>
  (No jokes about dinosaurs or the Dark Ages, please.)   It was back in the<br/>
days before Gameboys and the internet.   Back in the days when there were<br/>
only 4 TV channels and you had to get up and turn the dial on the TV to<br/>
change the channel.   Even so, we still had lots of fun.   This is a party<br/>
trick that always amazes people, but it is based on science.   To try it,<br/>
you <br/>
will need:<br/>
<br/>
a doorway<br/>
<br/>
OK, it is really very simple.   Stand in the doorway.   Start with your arms<br/>
hanging down by your sides.   Lift them outwards until the backs of your<br/>
hands are touching the doorframe on each side of you.   Now press outwards<br/>
with your arms, as hard as you can.   Keep pressing while you count to 60,<br/>
or <br/>
as long as you can without it hurting.   Then take one step forward and<br/>
relax <br/>
your arms.   Your arms will seem to rise upwards all by themselves.<br/>
<br/>
What is going on?   Two things are working together to make this happen.<br/>
The first is muscle tension. If you tense a muscle until it gets tired, it<br/>
will keep some of that tension even after your brain stops sending it a<br/>
signal to push.   You can try that by making a fist and squeezing it as<br/>
tight <br/>
as you can for about a minute.   Then if you slowly open your hand, you can<br/>
feel the muscle tension that is still trying to keep your hand closed.<br/>
<br/>
This muscle tension by itself is not enough to explain what happens to your<br/>
arms.   The other part of the experiment involves suggestion.   An important<br/>
part of this trick is telling the person that is trying it what will happen.<br/>
 Because they are expecting it to happen and they are prepared for it, as<br/>
soon as they feel the muscle tension lifting their arms, they unconsciously<br/>
help.   <br/>
<br/>
Try testing the experiment with several people that do not know what to<br/>
expect.   They may still get some arm raising from the muscle tension, but<br/>
you will probably find that you get a much stronger response from someone<br/>
that has been told what to expect.<br/>
<br/>
We have done experiments on suggestion before. (Remember when we saw that<br/>
just thinking about your nose itching could make it itch?   If you did not<br/>
get that experiment, try to go for 5 minutes without scratching your nose.)<br/>
This experiment is another example of how the mind and the body work<br/>
together, sometimes in ways that we do not realize.   For example, just<br/>
saying the words &quot;ice cream&quot; over and over can cause my body to go to the<br/>
freezer for a snack, all on its own.<br/>
<br/>
Have a fantastic week.<br/>
