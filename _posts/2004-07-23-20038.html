specifically, but autonomous living, non-coercive parenting, mutually agreed upon <br/>
solutions, consensual living.  All those types of topics are fascinating to me and <br/>
fit in nicely with the topic of unschooling.  Not that any one person or <br/>
philosophy has &quot;the answers,&quot; but they can bring up great questions and thought <br/>
provoking discussions.<br/>
