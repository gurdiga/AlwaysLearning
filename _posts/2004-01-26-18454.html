I do think not everyone can homeschool.  Fewer can unschool.  I used to <br/>
think the oposite but since working in the school where I work, I have <br/>
changed my views.  One cannot make a choice if they do not know they <br/>
have a choice. <br/>

Subject: [AlwaysLearning] Who can&#39;t unschool? (a hard question)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There was a little discussion on another list that turned to the idea that <br/>
there was a group of unschoolers saying who could and couldn&#39;t unschool.  It&#39;s <br/>
been making me think.<br/>
<br/>
*****************************<br/>
<br/>
It is a hard and interesting question.  <br/>
 <br/>
I am always surprised when someone online reacts as if someone else&#39;s pronouncements online (or anywhere else, really) could have so much weight in the reader&#39;s own life.  It makes no sense to think (as many clearly do) that &quot;can&#39;t unschool&quot; means &quot;we won&#39;t let you&quot; because &quot;we&quot; don&#39;t have that power.  Really -- what could &quot;can&#39;t&quot; unschool mean, but that in the writer&#39;s opinion it won&#39;t work. <br/>
<br/>
But then, what does &quot;won&#39;t work&quot; mean?   What does it mean to say that unschooling is &quot;working.&quot;   For me  &quot;working&quot; has two components  - living a joyful, interesting, wonder-filled life with my children and also allowing them to grow into adults who trust themselves in all matters of living (including learning).  <br/>
<br/>
Yeah - I do think that certain attitudes/beliefs/constraints would prevent someone from reaching either of those goals. <br/>
<br/>
But if &quot;working&quot; just means the (IMO) more conventionally-schooly goal of having children reach the age of 18 having acquired certain skills/information - perhaps ones of the child&#39;s choosing for some people, perhaps not for others.  In this case, then, is unschooling is just a technique of teaching without a curriculum or required activities?   I don&#39;t have any experience or opinion on whether that kind of &quot;unschooling&quot; would &quot;work&quot; to reach that kind of goal or not.  Or whether certain attititudes or beliefs would hinder or help it. <br/>
<br/>
This really does seem to come up over and over and over again, doesn&#39;t it?  And I&#39;ve only been reading/posting for about 6 months. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 That unschooling is just a different way of presenting them with the information/experiences needed to acquire those skills/information.  I guess what I am saying -- is &quot;unschooling&quot; merely a technique, independent of goals.   From: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:SandraDodd@...">SandraDodd@...</a> <br/>
