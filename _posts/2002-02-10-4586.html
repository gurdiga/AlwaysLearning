study program - even through the school district. I might suggest one that <br/>
gives the kid a very minimal amount of schoolwork to do each week, assigned <br/>
by a teacher, and leaves him free to pursue his own interests - that might <br/>
make the dad more willing to take the plunge - if he thought that there was <br/>
still some &quot;professional&quot; teacher looking over his son&#39;s shoulder.<br/>

I intended to.  We are in WA state.  I don&#39;t know if<br/>
there are independent study programs here, as I am not<br/>
a Washington native and have never had cause to find<br/>
out before.  Anyone know?  I was in an independent<br/>
study program in San Francisco as a teen myself.<br/>
