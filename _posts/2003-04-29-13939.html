Did you mention a Punkin&#39; Chunkin&#39; contest in Montana?  I know there&#39;s one<br/>

Yes!  It&#39;s in October.   In Missoula.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s (I heard this on the discovery channel)  redneck technology!   I bet<br/>
if you Google you could find other places too.   <br/>
<br/>
I had some website stuff from KZOQ and if I can find it I&#39;ll send it to<br/>
you.   Silly pictures and important information about pumpkin greasing.<br/>

gotten a sudden compulsion to build one of these things.  I was hoping it<br/>
was in the summer, because by fall his son will be back in school don&#39;t cha<br/>
know?  I&#39;m sure Dan and Matthew will get involved with this project, I&#39;m<br/>
just not sure where they&#39;ll be able to fire this thing off around here.<br/>
This might call for a trip out to the desert.<br/>

Very serious business. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Seemingly normal, well adjusted individuals build air cannons, catapults,<br/>
trebuchet&#39;s and centrifugal&#39;s solely for the purpose of hurling a frozen<br/>
pumpkin hundreds of feet down a farmers field.  <br/>
<br/>
They bring their machines together in grand competitions, dress<br/>
appropriately, preform time honored ritualistic dances and then fire.<br/>
<br/>
Other normal, well adjusted folks pay money to watch.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s about it. <br/>

I think for the air cannons.   The pumpkins come out of those long<br/>
barrels with a lot of force and shots are disqualified if the pumpkin<br/>
comes apart before it hits the ground. <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know if it matters to the catapults or trebuchets so much.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-436302026">At the one in Delaware they aren&#39;t frozen.  I actually think that is against the rules.  My 3yo son saw the Pumkin Chunkin on TV and wanted to build a trebuchet, so we built a small one out of popsicle sticks.  Here is a webpage about the one in Delaware: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.atbeach.com/punkinchunkin/">http://www.atbeach.com/punkinchunkin/</a> Christy<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1290212621">There are a few of these events around the country, you could do a google<br/>
search.   I don&#39;t remember specific locations.    <br/>
<br/>
There is one in Missoula, Montana every fall.    It&#39;s pretty small time<br/>
compared to some.   <br/>
The air cannons can lob a pumpkin a couple thousand feet.   The<br/>
trebuchets and catapults, six or seven hundred feet.   <br/>
<br/>
I think the big air cannon goal is a mile, but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s been<br/>
done yet.   In some of the bigger events the trebuchets are flinging<br/>
pumpkins a thousand feet or more.   Pretty amazing, if you&#39;re as easily<br/>

re-discovering/perfecting the recipe for &quot;Greek fire.&quot;  A pumpkin that bursts <br/>
into sticky flame on contact.  That would be worth driving that far to see.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the best stories of forgotten technology is greek fire.   It was a <br/>
ship-to-ship thing, mostly.  Early napalm of some sort.  I think it was <br/>
encased in clay balls, but a pumpkin should do it!<br/>
