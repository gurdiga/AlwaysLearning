<div id="ygrps-yiv-268458141">There is a new little girls who is leasing a horse at the barn where my<br/>
girls ride and  I met the mom  yesterday and told her if she needed any help<br/>
at any time (they are new to horses) that she could ask me or my girls and<br/>
we&#39;d be happy to help.  We live right up the road so I even gave her my<br/>
phone number so she could call if they had trouble bridling or anything.<br/>
They were happy for the offer and when I told my girls they were happy to<br/>
help.  They love sharing their horse knowledge with other kids who are<br/>
interested in learning.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
As we were walking to our cars, the mom said something like, horses are<br/>
great.  They make it really easy to get your kids to eat their peas and do<br/>
their homework.  L  I was totally at a loss for words because even though I<br/>
know people are that way, I&#39;ve never heard anyone just come right out and<br/>
admit to it.  I wish I had said something enlightening to make her think.<br/>
Unfortunately, I was sort of shocked and speechless.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Even without the manipulation factor, horse are just great for kids.  They<br/>
learn to be responsible for creature that depends on them and they learn to<br/>
work through things that are difficult.  The list of the benefits that kids<br/>
get from working with horses is endless.  <br/>
