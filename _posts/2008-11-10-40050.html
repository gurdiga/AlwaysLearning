<div id="ygrps-yiv-1437379100">-=-How does unschooling teach a child to assess a situation socially?  <br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
This is the second of these questions that started &quot;How does  <br/>
unschooling teach...&quot; and there&#39;s another one down the list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t an entity, and teaching isn&#39;t the goal.<br/>
<br/>
I will rephrase the question.<br/>
<br/>
How does an unschooled child learn to assess social situations?<br/>
<br/>
Now I will suggest that perhaps the original question was written by  <br/>
someone who believes that school kids are taught &quot;to assess a  <br/>
situation socially.&quot;  And I will leave that to go back to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My children learned to assess situations by living in the real world  <br/>
their entire lives, with loving adults and older friends nearby to  <br/>
help them gently and kindly to be comfortable and confident.<br/>
<br/>
My children have assessed situations socially in ways some adults  <br/>
never have and never could.<br/>
<br/>
My children grew up without being crushed, shamed or wounded in the  <br/>
ways that are accepted by schools every single day,and in many cases  <br/>
the crushing, shaming and wounding come from the school&#39;s  <br/>
administration directly in the form of punishments and grades.<br/>
<br/>
My children assess situations as easily as they walk and speak (and  <br/>
I&#39;m grateful that they can do all those things, because not everyone  <br/>
can).    Unschooling didn&#39;t teach them to do that.  Experience and  <br/>
living peacefully in a whole world gave them the opportunity to  <br/>
practice and learn.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-103509442">Oh.  #9 had two parts.  I thought it was going to be a new questions,  <br/>
because of the format.<br/>
<br/>
How does unschooling teach a child to assess a situation socially?<br/>
Meaning, if a child has been catered to their entire life how do they<br/>
learn to give of themselves or take a passive role in a situation?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We just talked about that earlier today too, about teens!  So to the  <br/>
person who asked all these questions, if you&#39;ve joined the list, go  <br/>
to the archives and read earlier on Sunday and on Saturday, about the  <br/>
relationships between teenaged unschoolers and their parents.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Also, I think &quot;being catered to&quot; (not a nice way to put that; very  <br/>
snarky) IS a passive role, so the second part of the question isn&#39;t  <br/>
better than the first.<br/>
