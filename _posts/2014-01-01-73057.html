<div id="ygrps-yiv-1983023793"><html><div style="color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;"><div><span>Two things led me to share this super cute video here.</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><span>First it was the video and how awesome that this parents embraced and supported their child&#39;s love for trash! Yes trash and the trash pick up!<br>It would be so easy for them to turn to their little boy and say &quot;Yuck&quot; we don;t play with trash!&quot;</span></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">But they did the opposite!&nbsp;</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I think it is very important
 for parents to not just accept but embrace what your child likes. Be trash or watching cartoon!<br>I remember when I did not like the Thomas the Train videos or Dora&#39;s voice. I made the effort!&nbsp; I now love and miss watching Thomas with my son sitting on my lap and even have very found memories of Dora !!! Get over it I say.&nbsp; Be really open to it. Take a change. Even the cartoons I never cared that much for I still know enough about them to get the jokes and references!<br></div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;"><br>Second it was Sandra that wrote in a link a little list of some of the things I have done in my life for work and there are many very different things.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">My parents
 embraced anything we were interested in. They never said demeaning things about the stuff we liked. They were supportive and accepting.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I went to College and did get a Degree but my siblings did not and they were never made to feel bad&nbsp; or less in any way compared to me.</div><div style="color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;">I see that now! I am glad they were like that. My brother has also followed his passions and done many different things really well. My sister does not jump around as much as we do/did.<br><br>&nbsp;So here is the very heartwarming video that will make you smile.<br><br><a rel="nofollow"
