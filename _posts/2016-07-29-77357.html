<div id="ygrps-yiv-606038216">I watched a documentary last night called &quot;Janis: Little Girl Blue.&quot; It was powerful and sad, but it made me think about some aspects of unschooling, as well.<div><br></div><div> Janis was very unhappy in school; she couldn&#39;t look or act the part of a fifties schoolgirl and the biographer clearly feels that her experience as a bullied misfit (even in college) was something she never recovered from, and that led to her untimely death. Also, she didn&#39;t know she could sing until she was 17. Imagine having a voice like THAT and not knowing! But she found it, and through it, what happiness she *did* achieve. </div><div><br></div><div>That made me realize that I can&#39;t be sure I will put all the right things in my children&#39;s paths, but if I avoid putting the *wrong* things in their paths, and keep their horizons as broad as possible, they are best positioned to find their voices, and keep them. <div><br></div><div>Sarah</div></div></div>
