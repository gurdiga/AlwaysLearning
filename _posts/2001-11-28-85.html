<div id="ygrps-yiv-1169334559">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Ah - memories.....<br/>
<br/>
As soon as we got to the grocery store we&#39;d go to the<br/>
bags of dry beans <br/>
and <br/>
split peas and stuff like that. They&#39;d pick out a<br/>
&quot;baby.&quot; They cuddle <br/>
and <br/>
play with their bag of beans all through the store -<br/>
talk to it and <br/>
sing to <br/>
it and so on. I don&#39;t know how this whole thing<br/>
started - I think it <br/>
was by <br/>
accident with my oldest and she passed it down to the<br/>
younger kids.<br/>
<br/>
--pam&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That is too cute! My dd always takes her baby doll to<br/>
the store with us and pushes the cart (until it gets<br/>
too full!) with said baby in the child/infant seat.<br/>
Sometimes she likes to pretend that she doesn&#39;t know<br/>
me and that she&#39;s just another &quot;grown up&quot; that just<br/>
&#39;happens&#39; to be in the same aisle as me as we go<br/>
along. We get some pretty strange looks, but what&#39;s<br/>
new!<br/>
