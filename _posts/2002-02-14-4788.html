<div id="ygrps-yiv-1688988972">&lt;&lt;    &gt; I know one machine at least was invented by a black woman who<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; founded a whole beauty-type empire, sorry I can&#39;t remember her name.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Madam C. J. Walker.<br/>
<br/>
This is an example of how people *actually* learn and remember stuff, as<br/>
opposed to the linear time-line memorization dogma; I never heard her name<br/>
until yesterday, when it was mentioned in the cartoon strip, &quot;Jump Start.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Coincidences are fascinating to me and they seem to happen all the time. I<br/>
keep an envelope in the cupboard in the kitchen filled with what I call<br/>
&quot;synchronistic comics&quot;. Example: on the same day &quot;For Better or For Worse&quot;<br/>
showed Michael and Elizabeth playing Monopoly and &quot;One Big Happy&quot; has the<br/>
mother saying to Ruthie and Joe &quot;Why don&#39;t you play a nice quiet game, like<br/>
Monopoly.&quot;  Another day &quot;Ziggy&quot; says he never should have installed a pet<br/>
door and and Garfield&#39;s John says &quot;The pet door is for pets.&quot;  Weird.<br/>

&gt; unbelievable set of coincidences!&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>And when I met my husband, he was living on Meadow Lane! (Of course, if <br/>
was in Golden Valley, Minnesota...&lt;G&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Your exchange has been great fun to read -- I LOVE coincidences.<br/>

<br/>
Yet another happy coincidence!  Since you like coincidences, I just found out that Dawn recently met my parents&#39; next door neighbor!  (This is in a city of 30,000+, not in a small town.)  Funny, huh?  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Susan.  Dawn and I have taken this offline, but it&#39;s nice to know we weren&#39;t boring anyone.  :)<br/>
