<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995986697">One day we were driving along and Will was going on and on excitedly about <br/>
Roller Coaster Tycoon.  He has an older version that someone gave to him.  It <br/>
locks up his computer sometimes, but he&#39;s so fascinated and he plays it every <br/>
day.  I haven&#39;t heard him talk about it much in depth until this day.  <br/>
<br/>
I was so impressed with his use of some of the words and concepts, I wrote <br/>
them down so I could remember them.  I put quotes around the words he actually <br/>
used in the conversation.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Nausea&quot; (the way he says each syllable so distinctly is cute)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Vandalism&quot; (on another day before this he saw some broken stuff on a <br/>
building and asked if that was vandalism.  I said I wasn&#39;t sure, but probably.  I <br/>
didn&#39;t make the connection to RCT right then.  But on this day he told me what <br/>
vandalism consists of in RCT.)<br/>
<br/>
Negative numbers (he knows that if he starts to lose money on his park, he <br/>
won&#39;t be able to build more coasters.)<br/>
<br/>
Budgeting (This was on a different day.  We were in Wal-Mart.  He said he <br/>
wanted to save more than he needed for a particular item before he buys it.  &quot;I <br/>
do that on Roller Coaster Tycoon, too.  If I need $100 to build a roller <br/>
coaster, I wait until I have $1000.&quot;  I said if he learned to do that with every <br/>
purchase he made, he&#39;d be a millionaire eventually!)  <br/>
<br/>
&quot;Intensity&quot; (Most of his coasters are too intense to ride, thus the nausea.  <br/>
;)<br/>
<br/>
&quot;testing custom designs&quot; and &quot;test runs&quot;  (What he&#39;s doing here is learning <br/>
the labels for something he&#39;s done his entire life.  Experimenting with <br/>
different ideas, giving them a try, making modifications and trying again.)  <br/>
<br/>
Just thought I&#39;d share.  <br/>

paying close attention to RCT when Quinn loved it and then I got hooked -<br/>
started playing for many hours that I didn&#39;t have!<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s a fantastic game and very sophisticated.<br/>
<br/>
Now he&#39;s moved on to Starcraft and Warcraft- and they&#39;re way too complicated<br/>
for me, thank goodness &lt;gg&gt;.<br/>
