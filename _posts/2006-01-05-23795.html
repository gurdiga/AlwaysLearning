Really, unschooling.com was the big list now that I think about it. At<br/>
least we have unschooling.info now, but there were definitely less<br/>
email lists at the time. I see alot of the same people at the various<br/>
lists, so I do wonder if we couldn&#39;t all just get along on less lists.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
When I first came online I had a local park-day group which had  <br/>
evolved out of a La Leche League-based playgroup.  (La Leche League  <br/>
doesn&#39;t run such things, but that&#39;s where the group of us had met.)    <br/>
Then I signed up for *Prodigy, which got you e-mail and access to  <br/>
bulletin boards (BBs), which were not nearly as spiffy as message  <br/>
boards, but vaguely like that.  It was like all one big list, and  <br/>
people could respond, but you had to go to that site to read it.  The  <br/>
homeschooling list we could get to was a mixture of all kinds of  <br/>
homeschoolers, but most of them were big into structure, and some of  <br/>
them had no idea WHY (or that) anyone would homeschool who hadn&#39;t  <br/>
been directed to do so at church or by her husband.<br/>
<br/>
Then I moved to AOL, where there were several ways to communicate.   <br/>
There were message boards, and chatrooms.  I used to do a two  hour  <br/>
scheduled topic chat every week, and then edit the text of them down  <br/>
into a readable (long) thing people could download and read later.   <br/>
And I put out a newsletter--two of them, but not at the same time  <br/>
(one led to the other), with a mailing list I kept on the computer,  <br/>
and updated from e-mails people sent me (and &quot;unsubscribed&quot; people by  <br/>
search and delete on a word file with over 2000 names at one point).   <br/>
I could only send 200 at a time, so I learned some good file  <br/>
management and e-mail tricks.  It was a lot of work, but I was happy  <br/>
doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Growing Without Schooling came out every other month or so.  It was  <br/>
lagging and petering out.   Waiting two months for a magazine  <br/>
wasn&#39;t   any good as a primary source of support and daily  <br/>
encouragement.<br/>
<br/>
There was not a better source for quick, thorough homeschooling  <br/>
information in those days than the AOL forum.<br/>
<br/>
Then AOL got very squirrelly and replaced all the homeschool-mom  <br/>
volunteers (who were getting free AOL in exchange for working in  <br/>
there, maybe 12 or 15 people at a time) with people who weren&#39;t even  <br/>
homeschoolers.  It wasn&#39;t fun anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Home Education Magazine set up unschooling.com as a place for the  <br/>
unschoolers to go, and the HEM forum (larger, magazine-focussed) for  <br/>
all the rest, and from that came the unschooling.com list, which went  <br/>
through a couple of name changes and was passed on to me, Pam  <br/>
Sorooshian and Joyce Fetteroll a couple (or three?) years ago.<br/>
<br/>
By then, though, people could have webpages, and there were lots more  <br/>
homeschoolers, lots more unschoolers,<br/>
<br/>
It has been ten years since anyone had to rely on books or magazines  <br/>
as their information on homeschooling.  Those who have chosen to have  <br/>
internet in their homes have more than they could possibly read, and  <br/>
they have to pick and choose.<br/>
<br/>
There are advantages and disadvantages to both small pools of people/ <br/>
info and of large.   We can&#39;t change it either way.  Life keeps  <br/>
flowing along.  I miss having Kelly Lovejoy and Ren Allen on  <br/>
discussions &lt;g&gt; but they&#39;re doing a great thing by having a  <br/>
beginners&#39; list where they&#39;ll answer the same questions really  <br/>
patiently.  I myself prefer the in-depth examination of why people  <br/>
have a hard time shaking some of their beliefs, and about how culture  <br/>
with its questionable &quot;truths&quot; and its platitudes cripples people&#39;s  <br/>
thinking sometimes.   Some people hate those kinds of discussions,  <br/>
about the nature of reality and what &quot;learn&quot; means.  Some people have  <br/>
said they&#39;d scream if another person asked them &quot;How will they learn  <br/>
to read if you don&#39;t teach them?&quot;  (Some have screamed. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
Nobody has to stay on any list forever, either.  There can be ebb and  <br/>
flow of lists and participants, of topics and moods.   They&#39;re all  <br/>
part of one fine face. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

 <br/>
And we&#39;re here and at UD every day! But there are new voices every month that *get* it and that can answer more quickly than I can! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
They&#39;ve even missed me at UB (Unschooling Basics, the beginner list) lately! &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m here! I&#39;m here! And I&#39;ll be a part of discussions again!<br/>
