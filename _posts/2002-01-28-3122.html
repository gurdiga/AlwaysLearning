&lt;&lt; definitely not more educational than the cat AND the tennis shoes together!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;This isn&#39;t the cat that taught himself to pee in the toilet by watching is<br/>
it?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Our cat would more likely pee in the tennis shoe.<br/>
<br/>
This morning he peed on a backpack that was lying on Holly&#39;s floor.  I was in <br/>
there sleeping too. I heard him scratching on it and I threw a slipper at <br/>
him.  He took off, but came back.  Idiot cat.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so glad we have a washing machine.<br/>
