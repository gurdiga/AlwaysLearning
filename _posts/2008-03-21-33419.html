I&#39;d like to hear more about this subject as our family has had  <br/>

I&#39;m assuming that when you ended the friendship, Holly was on board  <br/>
with not maintaining her friendship with the daughter.   But how do  <br/>
you handle it when your child really wants to maintain the friendship  <br/>
with the other child?  I&#39;ve talked to my son a lot about it and tried  <br/>
to prepare him for the possibility that the agreed upon plans might  <br/>
not happen, but that just feels like a yucky way to be in a  <br/>
friendship, always on pins and needles.  Although my son is prepared,  <br/>
there&#39;s still an anxiety in him that his friend is going to make a  <br/>
wrong move and &quot;bamm&quot; the play date is over or a future event is  <br/>
cancelled.  I&#39;ve talked with the mother, but she just thinks she has  <br/>
to do what&#39;s right for her family regardless of the collateral  <br/>
damage.  Personally, I would be fine with ending the whole friendship  <br/>
as you did, but with respect for my son, I&#39;m wanting to see some  <br/>
other options.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any thoughts on how you or others have handled these type  <br/>
of situations.<br/>

Holly was pretty cranky too, and asked me to talk to the mom (about  <br/>
that and other things).  One day when Holly was cancelled out on  <br/>
about the toilet (the prime example), I said &quot;If Holly comes over and  <br/>
cleans the toilet, then can they go?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The answer was something like &quot;No, I don&#39;t want Holly to clean the  <br/>
toilet, I want Sierra to do what I tell her to do.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
So it wasn&#39;t about the toilet being clean.  It was about a mom who  <br/>
liked to put a reward out on a string and then yank it back.<br/>
<br/>
And that day, the mom told the daughter while she was asleep to clean  <br/>
the toilet or she couldn&#39;t go.  Eight hours passed.  The mom works on  <br/>
the computer and is on IM all day.  The daughter has a phone, e-mail,  <br/>
myspace.  The mom could&#39;ve asked or reminded her.  The daughter had  <br/>
fallen back to sleep and forgotten about the request, if she ever  <br/>
really heard it.<br/>
<br/>
But Holly was deprived of something she wanted to do.  I said that  <br/>
wasn&#39;t fair to Holly, and the other mom said that&#39;s what she gets for  <br/>
having a friend who doesn&#39;t listen to her mom.  So it was clarified  <br/>
for me that Holly DID deserve to be punished, for not picking better  <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
There was another family when Holly was four, five, six--across the  <br/>
street--who did the same thing a lot.  If the daughter did something  <br/>
they didn&#39;t like while Holly was over, they&#39;d say &quot;Holly has to go  <br/>
home now.&quot;  They punished her by removing Holly, as though Holly were  <br/>
an inanimate object.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-803005448">I&#39;m sorry to say that we&#39;ve had the same thing happen.  In our case the friend is an <br/>
extremely go with the flow kind of person, and my son is very not.  When it happens, it is <br/>
usually at the last minute.  His parents, for some reason, think it&#39;s a little unreasonable for <br/>
my son to be so upset.  It has been difficult, and the only solution we&#39;ve found is to limit <br/>
playdates and to have an attitude that if we see him it will happen, and if we don&#39;t then it <br/>
won&#39;t.  It&#39;s not easy, but my son really likes his friend, so he&#39;s willing to take the chances.<br/>
<br/>
This is a good example for the people that think we need to toughen our kids up and <br/>
prepare them for the real world.  Disappointment happens without us going out of our <br/>
way to devise it.<br/>

<br/>
Even as an increasingly elderly adults, I really don&#39;t like it when  <br/>
someone says they&#39;ll come over at some certain time and then they  <br/>
don&#39;t.  I was talking to Marty about it.  At the age of 19, he&#39;s  <br/>
already figured out an excellent way to deal with it.  If someone  <br/>
who&#39;s not so reliable says he&#39;ll be over, Marty says &quot;That would be  <br/>
cool,&quot; and so he has a positive response without the thought of a  <br/>
binding agreement.<br/>
<br/>
With Holly, we got to figuring that things might be cancelled, so the  <br/>
discussions would be &quot;If Sierra can really go, then...&quot; and a couple  <br/>
of times she had someone else invited so if Sierra couldn&#39;t go Holly  <br/>
still had a plan.<br/>

over every friday to play and i call the mom to pick him<br/>
up...sometimes as late as 8:30 pm. He can&#39;t come over now. His mother<br/>
has been trying to get him to clean his room. I suggested to her that<br/>
i would probably just close his door but she said she can&#39;t even get<br/>
through it.ugh! So now both her son and my son are punished! I mean<br/>
come on...his friend is 8yo,either clean it yourself mom or shut the<br/>
door! My son said something really nice:mommy,how about if you and I<br/>
go and clean Stevens room? That&#39;s real sweet of him. The mom said she<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I was thinking was that these kind of remarks, that are really familiar <br/>
to me from my childhood, like &quot;Why can&#39;t you be more like....&quot; and other <br/>
things, are wasted breath and wasted trust. Too much of that kind of speech <br/>
from parents causes kids to tune them out and stop listening, just as my <br/>
friends did with their parents. The kids are collectively rolling their eyes <br/>
and shrugging their shoulders and thinking that the noise that comes out of <br/>
their parents&#39; mouths can be largely ignored, a small nuisance they have to <br/>
put up with. That is what I meant by futile.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not a genuine question; my friends&#39; moms weren&#39;t expecting their kids <br/>
to answer. &quot;Well gosh, I guess I can&#39;t be more like Robyn because I&#39;m me not <br/>
her, and I have my own strengths and weaknesses that are all mine not hers, <br/>
but she&#39;s still my friend despite all this unpleasant comparing going on.&quot; <br/>
It was just a round about way of being critical and unacceptant and living <br/>
in a schooly mindset (I was head of my class every year and diligent, so I <br/>
was a school success story). My friends&#39; parents had good intentions, I dare <br/>
say. They probably wanted to inspire their daughters - but it didn&#39;t have <br/>
the intended effect.<br/>
<br/>
My intention as a mindful parent is to try and speak with conciousness of <br/>
the content of my words, and also to be straightforward when what I am doing <br/>
is in the broader realm of correcting Jayn&#39;s behavior (which is not a good <br/>
way to put it, but I&#39;m a bit tired right this moment), or alerting her to <br/>
another better choice.  If I want Jayn to take what I say to heart, the onus <br/>
is on me to say things worth listening to.<br/>
<br/>
This includes owning my own feelings. For example, looking back now I <br/>
suspect that this &quot;Why can&#39;t you....&quot;  collection of phrases that came from <br/>
my and my friends&#39; parents was an expression of their frustration. Perhaps <br/>
they had expectations that were blinding them. Perhaps (almost undoubtedly <br/>
given that we were at an expensive, private girls&#39; school) they had a lot of <br/>
schooly expectations and ambitions for their kids to make it worth the <br/>
expense.<br/>
<br/>
So if I am having feelings I *try*, and this is an ongoing journey, to name <br/>
them in plain, direct language, whether that be out loud or in my own head.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just about us speaking to them. It&#39;s also about them speaking to <br/>
us, wanting to continue to have the same wonderful conversations full of <br/>
discovery and enthusiasm that we had when they were tiny when they are <br/>
grown. If one way to keep the communication real is to avoid saying the same <br/>
dopey things my mom and my friends&#39; moms said, then that is one thing I can <br/>
do.<br/>

not kept up?  It sounds like you clean only in crisis mode, when it&#39;s <br/>
reached a critical point.  Perhaps you can try cleaning more regularly <br/>
so it doesn&#39;t get to that point.  My kids have always loved doing <br/>
housework such as vacuuming, dusting, wiping banisters, mopping <br/>
floors, and cleaning windows.  I&#39;ve always let them have fun doing it <br/>
and don&#39;t criticize their efforts in any way.  Over the years their <br/>
skills have improved and housework isn&#39;t a dreaded thing like I see in <br/>
some other families.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1890541153">But how do  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; you handle it when your child really wants to maintain the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>friendship  <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; with the other child?  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Last night Chamille and I talked about a particular friendship of <br/>
hers that is like this.  It goes beyond that though, the father is, <br/>
in my opinion, extremely emotionally abusive and controlling.  <br/>
Chamille has been viewed as a threat to his control over his <br/>
daughter, and in his twisted thinking, has to be removed.<br/>
<br/>
He has done a fabulous job of this in many many subtle and not so <br/>
subtle ways.  Currently Chamille can only see this friend at her <br/>
house on the father&#39;s conditions, which involve him being in the same <br/>
room as them at all times, probably to monitor conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The father has done an amazing job of completely brainwashing and <br/>
eliminating resistance to his ultimate control over his children.  <br/>
They do NOT defy him.  He punishes severly and dangles carrots.  The <br/>
kids aren&#39;t allowed out of the house, ever, except when he needs <br/>
something from the store, a couple blocks away, and sends them to <br/>
pick it up.  He moved to a tiny apartment across the street from the <br/>
schools they go to, to ensure that they never go any where except <br/>
school and home.  He has a job that makes sure that he is there when <br/>
they are.  He keeps tabs on all phone calls.<br/>
<br/>
They used to live across the street, and he used to let his kids play <br/>
outside with Chamille, this is how they really got to know each other <br/>
and become really good friends.  Somewhere along the way, he decided <br/>
that Chamille was a really bad influence on his daughter and started <br/>
eliminating availability to the point where it is pretty much non-<br/>
existent.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really yucky and hurtful.  I&#39;m really uncomfortable with <br/>
Chamille going over to their house, yet I&#39;ve allowed Chamille to <br/>
decide for herself what she is willing to put up with and be her <br/>
crying shoulder for all the pain.<br/>
<br/>
So, last night after experiencing yet another let down from this <br/>
relationship, she realized, that the dad was never going to let her <br/>
have a relationship with her friend.  There was never going to be a <br/>
time that he was going to allow his daughter to come over or DO <br/>
anything.  The current excuse was just that, the current excuse and <br/>
the next time, there will be another one, and another, and another.<br/>
<br/>
We went to the video store to get some movies and sat in the car for <br/>
a long time talking about it.  Chamille said that he won.  My <br/>
response was, are you kidding me?  He hasn&#39;t won anything, he&#39;s lost <br/>
everything.  Even if it were a contest, the clear winner would be <br/>
her, since she has a family that cares, and she is free to walk away <br/>
and find other friends.  The losers are him and his kids.  If his <br/>
children survive to adulthood, since suicide could be likely, they <br/>
will not have a relationship with their father and they will leave <br/>
for good.  These are clear &quot;at risk&quot; kids.  Several scenarios could <br/>
play out, but none of them any good for anyone.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday, she told her friend that she wasn&#39;t going to go over to <br/>
her house because her father is mean and she is uncomfortable around <br/>
him because of his meanness.  She will probably never see this friend <br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
I could&#39;ve ended this friendship a long time ago by not allowing <br/>
Chamille to go over to their house, but I didn&#39;t because Chamille <br/>
really does very much care for this person.  She has endured a lot of <br/>
pain and suffering from it, she discovered for herself what her <br/>
boundary was with this person.  That is a valuable life skill to <br/>
have, to know where that boundary is with people, how much you are <br/>
willing to put up with to experience the &quot;good&quot; parts, and to KNOW <br/>
that you have options and choices.</div>

  I come from a long line of estranged relationships, particularly mother/daughter -- my grandma and great-grandma didn&#39;t speak for 20 years so my mom didn&#39;t grow up with a grandma; my mom and grandma are recently estranged as are my mom and uncle; I am constantly struggling with feelings of inadequacy with my mom and just a general sense that she is not proud of me and is let down that I didn&#39;t do what she wanted me to do.  I have 4 daughters and I was sure I was doing it differently -- I have homeschooled, and thought I had been more purposeful about my relationship with them.  Granted, I struggle with controlling issues because it&#39;s so ingrained in me, but I have seriously worked hard at trying not to.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Well, sadly, just the other day my 16 year old daughter said to me that she thought I was always mad at her, didn&#39;t like her, and was generally disappointed in her and/or mad at her.  We had been butting heads, but I didn&#39;t know her feelings were so deep.  Ouch.  I spent most of the day praying / contemplating / searching within.  I was led back to the unschooling mindset / parenting philosophy which is why I joined a couple of days ago.  I refuse to have a repeat of past generations with my daughters.  I am excited about learning as much as I can here, even though it will be hard at times as old mindsets and mainstream habits die.  I can already sense a change just in the last 4 days since I&#39;ve signed up and &quot;listened&quot; to what is being said here.  Thank you Sandra and everyone else for helping.<br/>

<br/>
Homeschooling with a curriculum at home is, in my opinion, worse than  <br/>
school.  With school, the kids can escape at 3:00 or so and go to a  <br/>
safe, loving environment (or at least a different threatening  <br/>
environment).  With school at home, where can those kids go to get  <br/>
away?  When?<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is homeschooling as far as the very general thing we&#39;re  <br/>
doing (not sending our kids to school), but the similarity ends  <br/>
pretty quickly.  I didn&#39;t send my kids to school so I could do  <br/>
something broader, wider, bigger than school.  Some people kept their  <br/>
kids home so they could do something narrower and smaller than school.<br/>
<br/>
So as to resentment and expectations, unschoolers expect their kids  <br/>
to be happy and curious and comfortable and other easy, pleasant  <br/>
things.  With homeSCHOOLing, kids are expected to do things, on  <br/>
schedule, quickly, better, sooner, cheerfully, obediently, and it  <br/>
makes them little and wrong and the parents don&#39;t like to admit it.<br/>
<br/>
Those who were controlled and waited years to be big, to have their  <br/>
turn to control, can&#39;t let go of that easily.   Those who were made  <br/>
to feel small have a hard time feeling big (and sometimes controlling  <br/>
someone else is as near as they ever come).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe some of that is applicable, and maybe none of it is, but just  <br/>
in case there&#39;s anything useful, there it is.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some affirmations I collected years ago and I can&#39;t credit  <br/>
an author. It&#39;s not me!  They helped me, when I was first a mom:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/affirmations">http://sandradodd.com/affirmations</a><br/>
If a few of them resonate with you, maybe write them somewhere or  <br/>
carry one around with you to think about it for a few days, and then  <br/>
carry another one around or something.  Reading through the list  <br/>
won&#39;t help much, but if one jumps out at you, dwell on the idea from  <br/>
time to time for a while.<br/>

<br/>
When you are in a moment like that, a really good thing to do, is<br/>
completely humble yourself and ask her what you can do specifically to<br/>
make it better.  If you are causing her to feel disappointment and<br/>
anger, it is worth knowing how she perceives it.  Sometimes it is<br/>
something that she will see that you have not.<br/>
<br/>
Remove yourself from head butting.  Don&#39;t argue, find a way to agree,<br/>
even if it means to agree to disagree and drop it.  Walk away from the<br/>
argument, breath, and remember that it isn&#39;t about you, even if it feels<br/>
that way.  Don&#39;t internalize a behavior that your daughter is doing that<br/>
is causing you to feel argumentative.  Like water off a duck.  That<br/>
feeling can just roll off of you.<br/>
<br/>
Find all the things your daughter does &quot;right&quot;, make a list of them. <br/>
Focus on them and notice them, even verbally, when appropriate.  Notice<br/>
the things that she thinks she does &quot;right&quot; and do the same.  It could<br/>
be as simple as &quot;ooh, I like the way you did your eye shadow today&quot;. <br/>
Find something like that everyday and take note of it.</div>

something about how Chamille needed to go to the mall with friends, and<br/>
how it&#39;s nice for me that I can go, but maybe not so great for Chamille.<br/>
Her implication was that Chamille needed something different than me,<br/>
and that I was being overbearing as a mother.  I agreed that Chamille<br/>
would love to go with other kids, but that the ones she wants to go with<br/>
are never available and I am.<br/>
<br/>
The fact is, Chamille would like to go with other kids, but she&#39;s also<br/>
happy to go with me.  She actually likes me and likes to spend time with<br/>
me and vice versa.  It&#39;s sweet and wonderful.  Even at almost 14 she<br/>
still holds my hand or links arms with me.  I never ever in a million<br/>

&gt; -=-I have 4 daughters and I was sure I was doing it differently -- I  <br/>

&gt; because it&#39;s so ingrained in me, but I have seriously worked hard at  <br/>
&gt; trying not to. -=-<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Homeschooling with a curriculum at home is, in my opinion, worse than  <br/>
&gt; school.  With school, the kids can escape at 3:00 or so and go to a  <br/>
&gt; safe, loving environment (or at least a different threatening  <br/>
&gt; environment).  With school at home, where can those kids go to get  <br/>
&gt; away?  When?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unschooling is homeschooling as far as the very general thing we&#39;re  <br/>
&gt; doing (not sending our kids to school), but the similarity ends  <br/>
&gt; pretty quickly.  I didn&#39;t send my kids to school so I could do  <br/>
&gt; something broader, wider, bigger than school.  Some people kept their  <br/>
&gt; kids home so they could do something narrower and smaller than school.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So as to resentment and expectations, unschoolers expect their kids  <br/>
&gt; to be happy and curious and comfortable and other easy, pleasant  <br/>
&gt; things.  With homeSCHOOLing, kids are expected to do things, on  <br/>
&gt; schedule, quickly, better, sooner, cheerfully, obediently, and it  <br/>
&gt; makes them little and wrong and the parents don&#39;t like to admit it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Those who were controlled and waited years to be big, to have their  <br/>
&gt; turn to control, can&#39;t let go of that easily.   Those who were made  <br/>
&gt; to feel small have a hard time feeling big (and sometimes controlling  <br/>
&gt; someone else is as near as they ever come).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe some of that is applicable, and maybe none of it is, but just  <br/>
&gt; in case there&#39;s anything useful, there it is.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here are some affirmations I collected years ago and I can&#39;t credit  <br/>
&gt; an author. It&#39;s not me!  They helped me, when I was first a mom:<br/>

&gt; If a few of them resonate with you, maybe write them somewhere or  <br/>
&gt; carry one around with you to think about it for a few days, and then  <br/>
&gt; carry another one around or something.  Reading through the list  <br/>
&gt; won&#39;t help much, but if one jumps out at you, dwell on the idea from  <br/>
&gt; time to time for a while.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2112625585">My mom never forced any kind of chore on us.  I do remember helping with dishes, putting stuff away in my room, doing planting in springtime....and I remember it all with a smile on my face.<br/>
<br/>
My youngest brother is now 22, 18 years younger than me, and I never lived in the house while he was alive.<br/>
<br/>
He still lives at home. His best &quot;friends&quot; are my mom and his dad. They sit and have challenging political discussions, and take on VERY big questions and debate them.  He takes my 91 year old grandfather to every Princteon U. home basketball game and football game, he translates basketball games that are &quot;away&quot; and on the radio to my granddad, since he is deaf and cannot hear them.<br/>
<br/>
EVERYONE in the family, even I have questioned why this extremely bright kid is still at home....still not hanging out with friends of his own age etc.  BUT you know what????  I finally get it.  He was home tutored from 8-12th grade.  He has never been told to do a chore that I know of, and yet he has always offered his help eagerly and tackels big projects at the house that no one else would want to do.  He volunteers at my now deceased grandmother&#39;s church to take care of loose ends.  He does this because it brings him joy to continue the service my grandmother provided...it has never been asked for nor implied that he should be doing this.  What I finally GET is that he was allowed to blossom the way HE chose.  He has been &quot;held&quot; by his parents and nourished and watered when needed, when asked BY him.  NEVER have they put any &quot;expectation&quot; on him, and he is a VERY bright guy with Ivy- league educated parents, grandparents, uncles, brother etc.  I mention this because there certainly is a lot of unspoken &quot;pressure&quot; with the long list of relatives accomplishments.  He is the most relaxed and CONTENT person I know, and yet he owns nothing but the clothes on his back and an IPOD!<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know why I am relating this whole thing, except that it IS looked upon as strange in our society to like our parents and want to be with them when we are teens and older.  WHY?  I think this should really be examined.  Just like when people looked at me like I had 2 heads when I was still nursing my 3 year olds (they self weaned at 3 1/2), it wasn&#39;t like they would nurse into college!!  Humans grow up without our help, this is for sure.  Just like they walked and talked without teaching, so they wean without forcing, they develop their own identities at their own pace and eventually become &quot;independent&quot; of us.  And no adult would think it is healthy for the &quot;independent&quot; adult child to not want to be with their parents.........they would find it dysfunctional in some way probably.  But these same people want the teens to not want to have anything to do with their parents?  It is these kids that probably (I&#39;ve done no research on this, I am guessing here) have the most problems, make the bigger mistakes, take the wrong turns.  A parent serves as a compass, but you have to have that compass in hand in order to use it, right?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for this discussion!<br/>
