<div id="ygrps-yiv-497529382">Could those of you that have boys that have gone through their teens, please guide us towards some resources for what to expect in boys becoming sexually aware and developing sexuality.  I hope I&#39;m using the right words.<br/>
<br/>
Dear hubby was sexually abused at a young age and says he has no idea of what is considered &quot;normal&quot; development. (I hate using the word normal so I put it in quotes as I did not know how else to say what I needed)  I&#39;m clueless too as my parents certainly never discussed anything like this with me.  I know how I developed and my thoughts but I was not a boy. <br/>
<br/>
Zac is 13 - will be 14 in June.  He is an only child.<br/>
<br/>
We would appreciate information / resources for us (the adults/parents) and possibly things like how to have conversations about it with your teen.  I find myself getting embarrassed and avoiding and Hubby is at a loss too. I tried putting it off on hubby (you know the ole&#39; go ask your father avoidance) thinking he was the male and would have all the answers but Ed finally told me that was not working.<br/>
<br/>
For example, when we went to see Transformers a few months ago, the boy&#39;s mother kept going on and on about masturbating and our son asked what exactly that meant.  I had no idea how much information to give.  <br/>
<br/>
Also does anyone have any great books for boys on this - not very many words as he will only read graphic novels - or books with a lot of pictures and a few words.  Just in case he is interested in exploring this topic independently.  I&#39;m thinking of strewing - just having it available - not saying &quot;here read this&quot; ;)<br/>
<br/>
I like the idea of the functionality of it all - I know he is curious about that;  but also the human element of it - emotional feelings, love, responsibility, possible disease risks, etc.  He may not be ready for all that at his age but then again I really don&#39;t know.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for all your help - I didn&#39;t know who else to ask.  Our families would not be helpful resources.<br/>

The pictures are downright funny.  I&#39;ve also heard that &quot;It&#39;s<br/>

<br/>
My 9 year old has started to ask a few questions here and there.  He<br/>
also has his first crush right now.  :-)  I remember bringing up the<br/>
topic of sexuality and boys on another list a few weeks ago and I got<br/>
a few unrelated (to what I needed) replies and then total silence.  I<br/>
think this is a tough topic for MANY adults.  Including myself.  I<br/>
found myself feeling uncomfortable with the subject as well.  I really<br/>
had to take a look at myself, why I was feeling uncomfortable, and<br/>
realize that I have children who are going to be needing guidance in<br/>
this area and will probably be asking lots of uncomfortable questions.<br/>
 For me, it was time to get over it and take on the subject just as I<br/>
would any other.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-321649334">~~Could those of you that have boys that have gone through their<br/>
teens, please guide us towards some resources for what to expect in<br/>
boys becoming sexually aware and developing sexuality.~~<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think the best thing is to get really comfortable with sex and human<br/>
sexuality. A discomfort in parents is a big barrier for a child. <br/>
<br/>
As far as discussion coming from the Dad or the Mom, I really don&#39;t<br/>
think it has to be one or the other even for a young man who might<br/>
have typical male questions. My boys have been really comfortable<br/>
talking to me about sex but there are topics I can say &quot;well, here&#39;s<br/>
what I know but I never experienced this as a female so you might want<br/>
to ask your Dad more&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
My dh wasn&#39;t as comfortable sharing earlier on in our marriage. As the<br/>
kids grew and I pretty much discussed whatever topic they were<br/>
interested in, whenever they were interested, he got more comfortable.<br/>
<br/>
Interestingly, my oldest (now 18) has shared far more with me than I<br/>
ever expected or thought possible! His girlfriend even wrote me to let<br/>
me know when she went on birth control. How wild is that? I never<br/>
asked them to tell me anything, but they always knew I would be a<br/>
resource of information without judgement. <br/>
<br/>
There have been a lot of interesting talks over the last few years but<br/>
Trevor and Moira&#39;s relationship has spurred a whole new level of<br/>
openness. She&#39;s as open and talkative as I am, so I suppose that makes<br/>
a big difference.;) A more private person might not feel the same<br/>
about sharing.<br/>
<br/>
So my advice is to try and analyze why you feel uncomfortable with sex<br/>
talk. It&#39;s one of the most natural parts of being human and I really<br/>
believe that openness is hugely important. Dh and I don&#39;t hide our<br/>
sexuality (meaning we talk about it in front of the kids) and we don&#39;t<br/>
shy away from their questions. GET comfortable. I think that would be<br/>
really helpful.<br/>
<br/>
At your child&#39;s age, he probably knows a LOT more than you think he does.<br/>

<br/>
Holly has a boyfriend and I know the status of their relationship,  <br/>
because they have both spoken to me about it because they wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
When they kissed, Holly told Keith before she told me, because she  <br/>
wanted him to hear it from her first.   He told me later that he  <br/>
asked her what the difference was between kissing him and the other  <br/>
boys she has kissed.  He said &quot;What&#39;s different?&quot;   She thought and  <br/>
said &quot;I am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
She has, on camping trips and at parties, kissed one boy or another a  <br/>
few times.  This is very different.<br/>
<br/>
One of my best friends, who&#39;s known me since Kirby was born (Jeff  <br/>
Cunico, for those who know me and some of my friends) was talking to  <br/>
me Monday this week about this and that.  I told him the status of  <br/>
their love life, and that she&#39;s not &quot;sexually active,&quot; but might be  <br/>
within a few months.  He told me it was none of my business.<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t argue with him, but next time we talk I might ask him to  <br/>
clarify, and let him know (gently) that both of them have made it my  <br/>
business, because they need my approval and cooperation and they LIKE  <br/>
me and trust me.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a luxury, knowing things like this.  It&#39;s a gift.  And I&#39;m not  <br/>
going to screw up the situation by being unsupportive.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling makes lots of things very different.  Once we&#39;ve helped  <br/>
them accomplish what they want to do, it&#39;s hard to decide at some  <br/>
point to say &quot;NO MORE; no more.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s impossible, once life becomes about safety and opportunity  <br/>
and learning.<br/>

I&#39;d really like to address this point, specifically. I was abused when<br/>
young, and was worried that in my paranoia and desire to protect my child (I<br/>
was freaking out about this when I was pregnant with my first), I&#39;d handle<br/>
it badly.<br/>
<br/>
I would strongly recommend you pick up a copy of &quot;Protecting the Gift&quot; by<br/>
Gavin de Becker. Fantastic book that really explores what children need to<br/>
know and why, from a perspective of their own mental and physical defense. I<br/>
totally credit what I learned in this book with getting me to stop freaking,<br/>
and address the whole thing in a practical, matter-of-fact way.<br/>
<br/>
Saying &quot;I have an abuse history, so I don&#39;t know&quot;, honestly, is a copout. As<br/>
a parent, you have an obligation to shelve your baggage, or at least trade<br/>
it out for the new shinier stuff, with wheels and handles and all. =) And<br/>
I&#39;m not saying that lightly; BTDT, I know it can be hard to face, hard to<br/>
deal with, and puts up some tremendous blocks to, as Ren put it, &quot;get[ing]<br/>
really comfortable with sex and human sexuality&quot;. But that&#39;s the job we sign<br/>
up for, and there are *excellent* tools available to us, as survivors, to<br/>
help our kids be comfy in their own skins about what is, after all is said<br/>
and done and marketed and airbrushed and whatnot, normal biological<br/>
functioning.<br/>

My sister was raped when she was fourteen.  My mom was raped when she  <br/>
was younger.  I was not.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even want to tally up how many of my friends have been  <br/>
raped.  I&#39;m just making the point to say I have some second-hand but  <br/>
very close experience.<br/>
<br/>
My mom handled some things very well and others not so well,  <br/>
regarding having four girls in the house (my sister and two  <br/>
cousins).  My sister handled her kids&#39; stuff very well.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen other people&#39;s parents go practically catatonic about  <br/>
discussions of sexuality.  My best friend in high school found  kotex  <br/>
supplies on her bed and the little pamphlet &quot;Now You&#39;re a Woman,&quot;  <br/>
after she put bloody panties in the laundry, thinking she was dying.   <br/>
Not a word was said between her and her mom.  She referred to that as  <br/>
&quot;When the Kotex fairy came.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are books.  Go to a bookstore and look, or go to Amazon and  <br/>
look, or go to reviews and look.   My boys had something that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
bad for the 1990s but I wouldn&#39;t recommend it now.  Get something  <br/>
with pictures that&#39;s easy to flip through and browse.<br/>
<br/>
If not, the abuser is hurting other kids, still, through the parents.<br/>

<br/>
EXACTLY.<br/>
I speak openly of Trevor and Moira&#39;s choices because they have given<br/>
me permission to do so...I wanted to clarify that in case anyone was<br/>
nervous about that. Both sets of parents have been part of the<br/>
process, though we left my dh in the dark about some of it because he<br/>
has a harder time. We feed it in bits and pieces, though he guesses<br/>
most of it anyway.:)<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really cool to have him with the person he&#39;s chosen, because he<br/>
happens to be in love with a person whose parents are very open and<br/>
supportive though they came to unschooling later in life. <br/>
<br/>
Trevor and Moira joke about both of them being &quot;kindergarten<br/>
drop-outs&quot;. I was just up in Trevor&#39;s room where Jared was playing WoW<br/>
with him. Trevor is in Waynesville with Moira right now, has been part<br/>
of the process of her parents buying a house which they will all be<br/>
living in soon....<br/>
I&#39;ve had so many thoughts about teens and video gaming and all this<br/>
built up trust over the years. Jared has an amazing connection with<br/>
his brother and WoW is helping ease a very difficult transition for<br/>
him. Living without his brother full-time has been hard.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I&#39;m rambling a bit here, but as I chatted with Jared I was<br/>
telling him things to tell Trevor during their play. He finally handed<br/>
me the keyboard and said &quot;YOU talk to him&quot;. So I did. <br/>
<br/>
He tells me he just wrote Moira&#39;s Dad asking him for permission to<br/>
marry her. They&#39;d been talking about it for a few months, but I guess<br/>
it&#39;s becoming officialized.<br/>
<br/>
Both sets of parents are completely supportive of them living together<br/>
and they want to get married. Go figure.:)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m honored to have been included in some really important decisions<br/>
in these young people&#39;s lives. Honored and a bit befuddled at times<br/>
because it&#39;s such a different reality than what I knew. I&#39;m so grateful.<br/>

My son is almost 13, and we&#39;ve just been going through this.  He&#39;s never really asked that <br/>
many questions, but things are changing so much that I knew it was time for some more <br/>
info.  Dad really wasn&#39;t keen on initiating anything, so I realized it would be me.  So I hit <br/>
Amazon and found &quot;What&#39;s Going on Down There?&quot;  It got good comments and was perfect <br/>
for 12 (probably good for 11-15).<br/>
<br/>
I left it around somewhere and he found it.  It is mostly text, and even though he&#39;s not <br/>
reading books much for pleasure these days. he devoured it.<br/>
<br/>
The talking part came after ds and I were watching Friends.  It&#39;s such a great series for so <br/>
many reasons, and one of them that I hadn&#39;t even known about is the great conversation it <br/>
can stimulate about relationships and sex.  After an episode with more than one couple <br/>
&quot;hooking up&quot; I really felt like I needed to point out that sex isn&#39;t necessarily that casual or <br/>
that meaningless.  He perked up, said, &quot;That&#39;s what I was thinking, but then I was getting <br/>
kind of confused by how it is on this show.&quot;  PERFECT  It was one of those beautiful <br/>
moments when the stars were aligned for the right conversation at the right time.  We <br/>
talked until about 2 in the morning.  I did refer a few questions to dad and recommended <br/>
that he talk with him.  My ds son, &quot;I really do want to talk about this, but I will NEVER bring <br/>
it up, so you have to.&quot;  I loved that!  I mentioned it to my husband who then did initiate a <br/>
talk the next night.  And they had a 2-3 hour conversation.  They covered much of the <br/>
same territory, but from his point of view.  Brilliant.<br/>
<br/>
I was thrilled everything came together like it did, because I was handed a book when I <br/>
was about 8 and a pamphlet when I was 10 and that was the extent of my conversations <br/>
with my parents.  Woo hoo.  I really didn&#39;t know how I would handle it when the time <br/>
came, but as it was happening I was relaxing and realizing that talking about sex was no <br/>
different than any of the gazillion other conversations we have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1247419890">This subject line drew my interest right away, because I have spent<br/>
the last 18 years trying to figure out my son!  My daughter and I have<br/>
always just &quot;gotten&quot; each other, whereas my son and I tend to have to<br/>
explain ourselves.  <br/>
Anyway, a few months ago there was something on a news program about a<br/>
series of popular and controversial videos on the web, called The<br/>
MIDWEST TEEN SEX SHOW.  If you Google it you&#39;ll find lots of opinions<br/>
and reviews.  From the clips I&#39;ve seen, they are sort of a cross<br/>
between educational public service announcements, and raunchy pop<br/>
shock comedy shows.  The teens in my life (15g, 16g, 18b, 19b) loved<br/>
it.  Good for conversation starters, if you can watch them together. <br/>
Definitely watch a few of them yourself first.  <br/>

&gt;   There&#39;s a book i just read called:The Wonder of boys. The author<br/>
&gt;   writes about &quot;teaching&quot; his words,how to help a boy honor,respect and<br/>
&gt;   care for and understand his body and how girls might see a boys words<br/>
&gt;   or actions and intent in relating to each other. He also writes how<br/>
&gt;   boys need competition through sports and other areas and such. I liked<br/>
&gt;   the book except the part about discipline.--- <br/>

&gt; For example, when we went to see Transformers a few months ago, the <br/>
 </span></blockquote>boy&#39;s mother kept going on and on about masturbating and our son <br/>
asked what exactly that meant.  I had no idea how much information to <br/>
give.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Oh boy that movie open up a can of worms with our 8 yr old! He <br/>
watched it two or three times before asking &quot;What&#39;s that word mean?&quot;. <br/>
At the time, I simply answered his question without additional info, <br/>
trying not to tell him more than he is ready for. (The real can of <br/>
worms came later. lol)<br/>
<br/>
Z has always seemed kind of embarassed about sex and sort of censors <br/>
himself (turning away from movies) but is not emabarassed about his <br/>
body, which just shows me he&#39;s not ready for the sex info yet. But <br/>
with a 13/14 year old, if he&#39;s embarassed, it might be from the fact <br/>
that it is a new subject to talk about with his parents. Z used to be <br/>
more embarassed about his body and other peoples bodies but I made it <br/>
a point to start talking about it nonchalantly (but not too much if I <br/>
could tell he was uncomfortable) and he seems to have come to realize <br/>
our bodies are not something to be embarassed about. <br/>
<br/>
But IMO, I wouldn&#39;t &quot;strew&quot; the sex topic. I&#39;d be open and honest and <br/>
talkative about it...and soon. He needs open dialogue with someone he <br/>
trusts. My mom left books for me and we never had an open <br/>
conversation or read the boks together. She never even askedme if I <br/>
read them or had questions. I think if I had someone I felt like I <br/>
could trust to ask questions and not get knee-jerk responses <br/>
like &quot;wait til your married/you&#39;ll regret it/etc&quot;, I may have made <br/>
some much different choices in my life. <br/>
<br/>
A book is no substitute for a parent. And trust me, it&#39;s only <br/>
uncomfortable the first couple of times you talk about it. It gets <br/>
easier with time! (At least it has with us!) lol<br/>

<br/>
I may not understand this comment completely...  Richard (12) has never been embarrassed about his body, though he is more private with others recently.  He has even come to me to show me how much pubic hair he has gotten (&quot;LOOK MOM!!!&quot;).  I am more embarrassed than he is when he does that!  I try not to show it though!  But even with his openness he is definitely ready for and wanting more information.  <br/>
<br/>
We talk pretty openly about bodies and puberty and sex, always have though, up to the level that he was ready for.  There are times that we will hear something on TV that goes above and beyond his knowledge, a recent example was a reference to oral sex (Mom, what&#39;s a blow job?), I just take a deep breath and explain in little increments, giving only as much info as he is ready for and happy with.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t &quot;strew&quot; the sex topic&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;A book is no substitute for a parent.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone here mean&#39;t that a book should be used in place of parental involvement.  I got a book for Richard a few years ago, I think he was 8.  I left it in the bathroom, he read through it some, so did I!  He saw me reading it, I commented about things when I was reading sometimes.  There were some boyish things that I didn&#39;t know (and I told him that)!  He asked if there was a girl version, and that made me remember in 6th grade or so when boys and girls got taken into the cafeteria separately for our little movies.  Everyone knew that the girls movie was about menstruation.  We girls wanted to know what the boys movie was about!  The only thing we could think of was wet dreams, and the boys wouldn&#39;t tell!  <br/>
<br/>
I gave that book to another friend of mine who had a son, and recently, at 12, Richard asked where it was.  He is going through new changes and would like to read different parts of it.  I am ordering both the boy and the girl version this time.  <br/>

aren&#39;t mutually exclusive at all.  Reading, watching shows together, talking, seeing billboards, <br/>
overhearing conversations and jokes, talking with friends--it&#39;s all available material for <br/>

<br/>
We went with discussions AND books.  You don&#39;t have to choose just one.<br/>
<br/>
And if a parent really, truly cannot discuss it, get more than one  <br/>
book.  Maybe find another adult friend your child trusts and get him/ <br/>
her to discuss it.  Some people have no qualms at all.  Me.  Diana/ <br/>
hahamommy...  We can go on and on. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
When I was teaching 7th grade in ancient days, I did the sex ed  <br/>
program for my students and two neighbor-teachers---the 63 year old  <br/>
who couldn&#39;t begin to discuss it with 12 yr olds and the woman my age  <br/>
who had been to girls&#39; catholic school through college graduation.    <br/>
It was fine with me, so I got lots of practice.<br/>

Oh, I don&#39;t think so either! But I know my mom was uncomfortable with <br/>
the subject and used the book as a cop-out to avoid a conversation. <br/>
So I was just throwing that out there as another perspective to <br/>

I probably could&#39;ve clarified that better as well. I guess it&#39;s an <br/>

Our son would still run naked through the house, except that I at one point a couple of years ago, told him that I didn&#39;t think it appropriate for us to see each other naked any more - and let him know that the reason is because it was a societal norm thing.  He gets that because we talk with him about societal expectations a lot - some things he does not tend to just pick up on  - we have to discuss them and point them out to him.  Just this week he said he didn&#39;t care if I saw him naked, but it would bother him if other&#39;s saw him - that he just covers up to honor my wishes.<br/>
<br/>
I was not going to strew to avoid discussion, but to just have the info on hand for his independent &quot;research&quot;  - for example if it is 2 AM and we are asleep but Zac chooses to explore the subject - maybe something on TV sparks his curiosity - the resource would be there.    Plus I thought we could go over a book or books and then leave them for him to go back over if he wished.<br/>

   But with a 13/14 year old, if he&#39;s embarassed, it might be from the fact <br/>
  that it is a new subject to talk about with his parents. <br/>
<br/>
  But IMO, I wouldn&#39;t &quot;strew&quot; the sex topic. I&#39;d be open and honest and <br/>
  talkative about it...and soon. <br/>

Have you tried strewing books on this subject, or is it in general that he won&#39;t pick up <br/>
books.  I ask that because I would describe my ds the same way, but on this subject--no <br/>
problem!  :-)<br/>

through!!  But maybe not the right books.  I personally loved having <br/>
books on this as a teen.<br/>
