<div id="ygrps-yiv-430631283">I think the list is going fine, and thanks to those of you who are  <br/>
participating cheerfully!<br/>
<br/>
There have been two oddities this week, and I wanted to mention them,  <br/>
in case others have the same thoughts or complaints. This was my  <br/>
response on the side to someone who complained that people  <br/>
misunderstood or misinterpretted something she said:<br/>
<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
I was responding to ideas and statements in several posts.<br/>
<br/>
Please review the list intentions.  Joyce wrote most of it;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning">http://sandradodd.com/lists/alwayslearning</a><br/>
<br/>
No one has to write on the list, but what is written there will  <br/>
probably be discussed.<br/>
--------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
If there&#39;s anyone here who hasn&#39;t seen that page, please do read it.   <br/>
If you&#39;ve read it before it wouldn&#39;t hurt to glance down and make sure  <br/>
it&#39;s the same stuff you saw the last time.  Sometimes it gets additions.<br/>
<br/>
The other thing was a complaint on another list about links being  <br/>
provided.  I think it was a complaint that questions weren&#39;t answered  <br/>
at great length directly to the person asking, directed only to that  <br/>
one individual, without reference to prior discussions on the same  <br/>
topic.<br/>
<br/>
There was an accompanying and confusing suggestion that my site was  <br/>
too long and too much like a syllabus, and yet not large enough to  <br/>
contain several guessed-at URLs.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce has written enough to fill a dozen books, and she has done so  <br/>
patiently and sweetly, from her own time and energy, on a computer  <br/>
with internet that she and her husband paid for.  So after a while she  <br/>
made a website so people could read those things without having to ask  <br/>
in public in advance.  But I don&#39;t mind one bit when Joyce sends a  <br/>
link to go with something she&#39;s just written.  I think it&#39;s great!<br/>
<br/>
When I started collecting discussions, I think the first one was about  <br/>
TV, because Ren Allen had totally changed her mind, and the process of  <br/>
her seeing the value in TV was worth keeping so others could read it  <br/>
later.  That is here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/t/debate">http://sandradodd.com/t/debate</a><br/>
<br/>
Giving people access to the best of what&#39;s been discussed in the past  <br/>
several years seems good to me.  Anyone who would complain about that  <br/>
must not have thought much about what their real options are, in  <br/>
learning about unschooling, or what the relative value of available  <br/>
resources might be.<br/>
<br/>
This list has some of the most thoughtful unschoolers and the best  <br/>
writers among thoughtful unschoolers there are out there.  I think  <br/>
they&#39;ve stayed because the topics have been of a caliber to make them  <br/>
want to stay.<br/>
<br/>
When very-beginner questions are asked, the links will come out,  <br/>
because there are MANY things we assume people know before they  <br/>
participate on a list designed for people who have read some John Holt  <br/>
and who are already involved in unschooling.  So if someone joins the  <br/>
list who is new, that&#39;s okay, but they will probably be reminded that  <br/>
their ideas and suggestions are coming from a place of inexperience.   <br/>
The reason for providing links is so that people can see what&#39;s  <br/>
already been discussed so they&#39;re not asking the same basic questions,  <br/>
or so that Pam S. , Schuyler, Deb Lewis and such folks aren&#39;t spending  <br/>
their time repeating what they have already so eloquently written  <br/>
before.<br/>
