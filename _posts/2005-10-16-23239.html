<div id="ygrps-yiv-148528725">Okay then!   I wrote a book.   I have three boxes of copies of this book, and <br/>
I have a charge card bill on the horizon.    If you&#39;ve ever thought &quot;I wish <br/>
Sandra had written a book,&quot; please consider buying one!<br/>
<br/>
The shipping might seem a bit high, but the slower alternatives were not much <br/>
less money, and lulu.com charges LOTS because they deal through FedEx.    And <br/>
using priority mail, I get to use the post office-provided envelopes<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no extra shipping cost for second and third books in the same <br/>
envelope.<br/>
<br/>
Price with shipping for single books:<br/>
$19 U.S.<br/>
$22 Canada<br/>
$24 overseas<br/>
<br/>
Details and links here:<br/>

<br/>
I can take paypal or checks, but international checks affright my credit <br/>
union.<br/>
