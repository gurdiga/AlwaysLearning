<div id="ygrps-yiv-424454634">I&#39;m bringing this here just because this group&#39;s more open-minded.  &lt;g&gt; <br/>
 <br/>
I look at these photos of Band Aceh and can&#39;t help but think of the  biblical <br/>
flood. That all the animals found higher ground. That here  may have been <br/>
some fellow named Noah who had Howard  Gardner&#39;s Nature/animal <br/>
intelligence----and who had a clue. That  the winners/survivors write history! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Can you imagine how a country/people would view such devastation in the  <br/>
absence of science and knowledge of earthquakes/tsunamis? Almost ALL the people  <br/>
were wiped out---just a few survivors---but the animals knew enough to get out  <br/>
of the path. God must have thought they were really wicked....<br/>
 <br/>
Also---does the ultra-funky weather in CA right now have anything to  do with <br/>
the tsunami?  Forty days & nights? &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
These are incredible satellite photos of before and after the  tsunami!  You <br/>
can see from these photos the damage done to the land -  devastating.  Click <br/>
the before or after button at the top<br/>

 <br/>
There is new satellite imagery that showed the tsunami had an effect  on all <br/>
open bodies of water around the world, including the east and west coasts  of <br/>
the US.<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think the two are related, in the small picture, but I think they  <br/>
are related in the bigger one.  That of global climate, etc.  I don&#39;t  know much <br/>
about these things but your points are interesting to ponder.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1765136368">Hi,<br/>
I dont recall what radio station I heard this on, but they mentioned that the tsunami affected the levels of water in wells in Maryland . . . I think it said the levels rose.  Anyone else hear that?<br/>

Here&#39;s a little blurb from the NASA web site.<br/>
<br/>

If you go to the above address and read there are images and links, but<br/>
here&#39;s the story. <br/>

 How the Earthquake <br/>
affected Earth<br/>
<br/>
The Dec. 26th Indonesian megathrust earthquake quickened Earth&#39;s rotation<br/>
and changed our planet&#39;s shape. <br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
January 10, 2005: NASA scientists studying the Indonesian earthquake of<br/>
Dec. 26, 2004, have calculated that it slightly changed our planet&#39;s<br/>
shape, shaved almost 3 microseconds from the length of the day, and<br/>
shifted the North Pole by centimeters.<br/>
<br/>
Dr. Benjamin Fong Chao of NASA&#39;s Goddard Space Flight Center and Dr.<br/>
Richard Gross of NASA&#39;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said all earthquakes<br/>
have some effect on Earth&#39;s rotation. It&#39;s just that the effects are,<br/>
usually, barely noticeable. <br/>
<br/>
This one was not usual: The devastating megathrust earthquake registered<br/>
nine on the new &quot;moment&quot; scale (modified Richter scale), making it the<br/>
fourth largest &#39;quake in one hundred years.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Chao and Gross routinely calculate earthquakes&#39; effects on Earth&#39;s shape<br/>
and rotation. They also study changes in polar motion--that is, the<br/>
shifting of the North Pole. <br/>
<br/>
According to their latest calculations, the Dec. 26th earthquake shifted<br/>
Earth&#39;s &quot;mean North Pole&quot; by about 2.5 centimeters (1 inch) in the<br/>
direction of 145 degrees east longitude, more or less toward Guam in the<br/>
Pacific Ocean. This shift is continuing a long-term seismic trend<br/>
identified in previous studies.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
The quake also affected Earth&#39;s shape. Chao and Gross calculated that<br/>
Earth&#39;s oblateness (flattening on the top and bulging at the equator)<br/>
decreased by a small amount--about one part in 10 billion. This continues<br/>
the trend of earthquakes making Earth less oblate. Less oblate means more<br/>
round. <br/>
<br/>
They also found the earthquake decreased the length of the day by 2.68<br/>
microseconds. (A microsecond is one millionth of a second.) In other<br/>
words, Earth spins a little faster than it did before. This change in<br/>
spin is related to the change in oblateness. It&#39;s like a spinning skater<br/>
drawing arms closer to the body resulting in a faster spin.<br/>
<br/>
None of these changes have yet been measured--only calculated. But Chao<br/>
and Gross hope to detect the changes when Earth rotation data from ground<br/>
based and space-borne sensors are reviewed.</div>
