<div id="ygrps-yiv-1841761534">Pam Sorooshian posted this, but it would have stayed under &quot;sidewalk  <br/>
paint&quot; forever, so I&#39;m bringing it to a new topic of its own.<br/>
<br/>
======================================<br/>
<br/>
Rosie (18 year old) is taking a political science class at the community<br/>
college and this morning the professor asked her to stay after class. He<br/>
said he&#39;d shown her term paper to his editor (he writes textbooks) and<br/>
they really like her writing and want to know if she&#39;d like a job doing<br/>
some writing for a comparative political systems book they&#39;re working on<br/>
over the summer.<br/>
<br/>
FUNNY thing - Rosie doesn&#39;t think of herself as a good writer at ALL.<br/>
Roxana is the big writer - Rosie&#39;s opinion of her own writing ability<br/>
was pretty low (but she really only had Roxana to compare herself to,<br/>
and Roxana is a really truly gifted writer). She had been really<br/>
surprised to get 100 percent on her term paper, but I&#39;d told her it was<br/>
a really good paper. She hasn&#39;t taken any other college courses that<br/>
require writing - this is the first. Other than this, she&#39;s written<br/>
NaNoWriMo novels and SriptFrenzy screenplays. She&#39;s had no writing<br/>
instruction of any kind. Always unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
She told him she&#39;d think about it, but told me she doesn&#39;t think she<br/>
wants to do it. I told her to ask if they&#39;d be interested in her sister<br/>
because she be more interested in that kind of work.<br/>
<br/>

====================================<br/>
<br/>
This is so cool.   These stories are like fireworks in the world of  <br/>
the opportunities teens are offered overall in the world.<br/>
<br/>
She might like to do it.  It might inspire her to write about martial  <br/>
arts and sign language and the treatment of children in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Holly was going to quit her job at the mall after Christmas.  It was  <br/>
called &quot;a Christmas job&quot; and she figured, Christmas was over, she  <br/>
should quit.   But they wanted her to stay.  She did, but not  <br/>
enthusiastically.   She thought more of it when others older than she  <br/>
was quit, or were let go for incompetence (or worse).  she thought  <br/>
even more of it when other people came to apply to work, and now that  <br/>
it&#39;s spring and there are LOTS of applications...   she realizes it&#39;s  <br/>
cool to have a job, I guess.  And she has two.  And I almost feel  <br/>
guilty, because there are kids out there who would love to have ONE  <br/>
job.  But there are kids out there by the thousands who couldn&#39;t be  <br/>
trusted as Holly is, who aren&#39;t as quick to learn, or as fun to be  <br/>
around.   Her boss said she&#39;s the only person who&#39;s ever worked there  <br/>
who would run to do something.  And it&#39;s a skateboard shop, and they  <br/>
let people skateboard in the shop, and still, the employees take their  <br/>
sweet slow time to do anything, except for Holly.<br/>
<br/>
That story was intended to suggest that maybe Rosie has no idea how  <br/>
stunningly cool it is to have been asked to help write that way.<br/>
