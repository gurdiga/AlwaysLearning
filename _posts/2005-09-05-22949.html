<div id="ygrps-yiv-347700145">I remember those days!  That was before homeschool. But the cartoon <br/>
watching was ONE of the many reasons we took him out of public <br/>
schools.He was(REALY) learning more from cartoons than school.  <br/>
Atleast he was REMEMBERING more info.  Soooo I started paying <br/>
attention to cartoons and watching them.  There are even web sites you <br/>
can go on for cartoons that you can all learn from.  That might spark <br/>
her interest in research. He (our son)just turned 13 and we&#39;ve gone <br/>
from cartoons to monster creepy movies, to history and war movies.  <br/>
Yeah, don&#39;t get all wiggy about cartoons.  That&#39;ll pass.  But DO watch <br/>
some with her and try not to compare her w/ brother.  They all need to <br/>
be listened too.  Well,  that&#39;s my two bits worth!  Jody</div>
