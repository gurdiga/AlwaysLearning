<div id="ygrps-yiv-760803944">Pam Laricchia has a December 7th blog post on the topic of navigating extended-family get-togethers for the holidays, birthdays, and so forth. Here&#39;s the link:<br/>

There are lots of great ideas in her post, but I particularly love that she says this at the beginning:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;First off, things go much more smoothly for me when I remember that I&#39;m *choosing* to visit, or to invite others over. I don&#39;t have to see anyone. You won&#39;t be arrested or jailed for not visiting with relatives. So right off, it&#39;s my choice. It&#39;s a much better mindset because from that perspective I see opportunity, not obligation.&quot;<br/>
