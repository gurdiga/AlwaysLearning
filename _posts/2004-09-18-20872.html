<div id="ygrps-yiv-2004954010">Pam Sorooshian set this board up.  There are others involved in the larger <br/>
project, but the message board set-up is really new!  So far it&#39;s not many <br/>
people, but it only opened a day ago! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
======================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The Center for Unschooling Information, as its very first project, has opened <br/>
new message boards at: &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.unschooling.info/forum">http://www.unschooling.info/forum</a>&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We are excited to announce the creation of these new boards, which are <br/>
devoted to discussion of anything and everything related to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Discussions will include such topics as: Getting Started Unschooling, <br/>
Deschooling, Supporting Kids&#39; Endeavors, Finding Support, and much, much more. These <br/>
boards are easy to search and are conveniently organized to allow on-topic, <br/>
in-depth discussion.<br/>
<br/>
You may be wary about utilizing message boards. But, these boards are loaded <br/>
with features that make navigation a breeze. For instance, you can sign up to <br/>
get new messages sent to your e-mail address. You can edit or delete your own <br/>
posts. You can add a hyperlink to your posts, track all activity since your <br/>
last visit, and search posts for specific topics. There is even a FAQ to help <br/>
you learn about all the forum features and how to use them: &lt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-403253680">Neat.  I tried to find out how to have messages sent to my email, but I was<br/>
unable to locate that information.  Can you help?  I&#39;ve always wanted to<br/>
participate on the message boards but I&#39;ve always been overwhelmed trying to<br/>
navigate them.  It will be cool to be able to have the messages sent to my<br/>
in box.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
