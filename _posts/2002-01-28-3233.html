I&#39;m being the devil&#39;s advocate, now.. I actually am giving serious thought<br/>
to that &quot;letting them form their own opinions&quot; business, it&#39;s just that I<br/>
think it&#39;s just as important to discuss how to transfer your values to<br/>
your children... does anyone seriously think it&#39;s not desireable? or just<br/>
not possible? or what? You actually can&#39;t help transferring at least some<br/>
values, so why not to do more of it, or should everyone conscientiously<br/>
try to do less of it?<br/>
--------------------<br/>
<br/>
It isn&#39;t a matter of &quot;letting them form their own opinions&quot;. You cannot stop<br/>
them from doing so. You may be able, for awhile at least, to keep them from<br/>
voicing those opinions. You may be able to even get them to lie to you and<br/>
say they agree with your opinions if they don&#39;t. But you have little power<br/>
over their actual opinions now, and will have less as time goes on.<br/>
<br/>
As far as transferring values goes, well, frankly, I&#39;m not interested in<br/>
transferring. It would make me sad if a child of mine grew up to believe<br/>
that Pit Bulls were evil and that PETA was on to something, but I&#39;d get over<br/>
it. My children are human beings who WILL have some values divergent from<br/>
mine, and perhaps important-to-me ones at that.<br/>
<br/>
I am trying to live my values. In this way, my children will be able to see<br/>
what I believe by the actions I take, and whether I do as I say. This is<br/>
what forms their opinion of me. Whether my values make sense to them is what<br/>
will make them decide whether to adopt those values or go another direction.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a bit like Christianity. Some Christians simply go about their lives<br/>
living as they think Jesus would have tried to, making choices the best they<br/>
can based on a moral framework they&#39;ve adopted. Some Christians, OTOH, go<br/>
around telling everyone they&#39;re going to hell.<br/>
<br/>
I know which kind of Christian I&#39;d rather be, and I don&#39;t appreciate the<br/>
latter variety trying to transfer their values at me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2083004219">My goal is for my children to think independently.  As they grow they<br/>
should be able to discern which of my values are worthy of adoption.  My<br/>
daughter, 11, is better at living what I believe than I am at times!  I<br/>
see her sticking to my values when I, on the other hand, am compromising<br/>
them.  It&#39;s one of those pride and self-reproachment moments.<br/>
