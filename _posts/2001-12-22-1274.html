According to this detailed summary (one paragraph below because it&#39;s cool and <br/>
different), the boys court and ask the girl in secret and she waits to tell <br/>
her parents.  It&#39;s a very interestin article.<br/>

-=-A whirlwind of activity begins after Fast Day on October 11. Fall <br/>
communion takes place the following church Sunday. After communion, proper <br/>
certification of membership is requested, and is given by the second Sunday <br/>
after communion. This is a major day in the life of the church because all <br/>
the couples who plan to marry are &quot;published.&quot; At the end of the service, the <br/>
deacon announces the names of the girls and who they plan to marry. The <br/>
fathers then announce the date and time of the wedding and invite the members <br/>
to attend. The betrothed couple does not attend the church service on the <br/>
Sunday they are published. Instead, the young woman prepares a meal for her <br/>
fiance and they enjoy dinner alone at her home. When the girl&#39;s family <br/>
returns from church, the daughter formally introduces her fiance to her pare<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1737290664">Buttons were expensive little items in the past. They were worn by <br/>
folks with money and these people were pretty proud of their fancy <br/>
buttons.  Perhaps more importantly, buttons were heavily featured on <br/>

Buttons are therefore symbols of the pride of fancy people and <br/>
militarism.  Bad stuff.<br/>

It&#39;s directly related to the legal notices in back of newspapers.  Like you <br/>
have to publish three times if someone left their truck with you five years <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1656704929">The diocese here in Metro Detroit still lists the &quot;Bans of Marriage&quot;.  I<br/>
think they list it 3 times (can&#39;t remember if it is consecutive weeks in the<br/>
bulletin).<br/>
<br/>
I never officially learned why it was done, but when my girlfriend was<br/>
getting married 14yrs ago(cripes I am getting old), we had a discussion<br/>
about it and she said they notify the community who is intended to marry<br/>
whom and if anyone knows why one shouldn&#39;t marry the other(person is still<br/>
married, or cheating or something), it is their obligation to notify the<br/>
person or the church or someone.<br/>
