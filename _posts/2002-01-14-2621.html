&lt;&lt; ... because some have decided it isn&#39;t natural to wean early and to<br/>
even set a specific year before which they claim it would be unnatural to<br/>
stop nursing. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
The Bible gives a year, but I don&#39;t remember if it&#39;s two or three (I think <br/>
two), before which children shouldn&#39;t be weaned.  So it&#39;s not just a recent <br/>
LLL idea.  And the same as with the idea that if we LET kids learn to read on <br/>
their own schedule, there still is a schedule (as it were), one thing many <br/>
LLL members try to do is to see when the child will quit on his or her own <br/>
without the mother withholding or distracting to induce weaning.<br/>
<br/>
Weaning is more common in this culture than nursing is.  You can ask <br/>
grandmothers about weaning methods (some of them cruel--putting bad-tasting <br/>
stuff on the breast, scaring the babies, shaming them), but few of them have <br/>
a clue as to supporting and extending breastfeeding.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I think the best we can do is to become<br/>
more aware of why we are choosing to do certain things so we can throw off<br/>
our own cultural baggage rather than taking on the baggage of others because<br/>
we assume they&#39;re more natural.-=-<br/>
<br/>
This culture prides itself on being unnatural.  I thought (hoped) I was one <br/>
of the last to have been taught in school (public and university classes <br/>
both) that humans had no remaining instincts--that they had all been <br/>
extinguished, and we had no way to learn except from what was passed down in <br/>
writing, and that&#39;s why it was so important that people study writings from <br/>
the past and continue research and writing.<br/>
<br/>
It sounds stupid.  It IS stupid.  A friend of mine fifteen years younger was <br/>
taught that too, in college.  <br/>
<br/>
-=-If she was hurt I hugged her just because it wouldn&#39;t<br/>
have occured to me to make a connection between pain and food.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Breastmilk isn&#39;t just food to babies.  It&#39;s sedative.  And a screaming baby <br/>
can be comforted, and a wounded baby can be, and a fidgety, tired baby can be <br/>
sedated to sleep with enough nourishment to  have a long nap.<br/>
<br/>
In cultures in which breastfeeding babies is natural, that&#39;s so known that <br/>
it&#39;s not worth mentioning.  Here, we have to read it out of a book (or learn <br/>
it from other moms, which is what LLL&#39;s all about).<br/>
<br/>
Another note about our (depending on who &quot;we&quot; are) culture:  In the U.S. we <br/>
call it &quot;nursing,&quot; which is an old word and concept, but is not the name for <br/>
what mothers do for their babies.  That word is breastfeeding, but in a <br/>
language that won&#39;t say breast or ass (certainly not at the dining table, and <br/>
this DOES have to do with eating), we cover words over with other words.  We <br/>
can ask for someone to pass the white meat on chicken or turkey day, and we <br/>
can nurse a baby.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In England &quot;nursing&quot; is a different thing.  <br/>
In English, historically, that&#39;s true too.  If someone else was hired to <br/>
nurse your baby (to breastfeed them, but because they were not the mom, it <br/>
was a &quot;wet nurse&quot;--someone who could take care of the baby AND feed it), that <br/>
was nursing.<br/>
<br/>
Rich people didn&#39;t nurse their own babies.  They hired poorer women (but <br/>
never redheads) to do it.  In the southern U.S., there are stories of <br/>
recently-delivered slaves nursing white babies even while their own babies <br/>
went hungry for hours, and on the unsanitary version of the bottle which <br/>
existed then.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a 16th or 17th century grave (I&#39;d have to look for the reference) in <br/>
England with an epitaph stating that the woman had fed all her babies from <br/>
her own breast.  Must&#39;ve been unusual to make it worth carving in stone.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Neither offer nor refuse&quot; is one of the extended breastfeeding phrases <br/>
sometimes given from mom to mom if she&#39;s wanting to separate some without <br/>
weaning.<br/>
<br/>
I know a mom who quit at ten months with both babies because they refused a <br/>
time or two.   To say &quot;take it every time or never have it again&quot; is kind of <br/>
harsh, but we&#39;re conditioned to want them to stop as soon as they can (from <br/>
social pressure against nursing, I think), and so moms are relieved when it&#39;s <br/>
refused sometimes.   And they say &quot;that baby&#39;s done!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-In a culture where infants are nursed when they cry regardless<br/>
of the cause, is it done because that&#39;s natural or because there is social<br/>
pressure to do so to quiet the infant because so many people are living so<br/>
close together? Or is it both?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Are there causes for which a baby should be left to cry?<br/>
<br/>
I would nurse my baby if he cried if we werethe only two people for miles, <br/>
because crying meant he was unhappy, uncomfortable, needy.  He could refuse <br/>
to nurse if he wanted to, but he rarely did because it was liquid comfort.<br/>

<br/>
Yes, and breastmilk is even more than that. Breastmilk&#39;s composition changes as the baby/child ages, as the brain goes through different stages of development, if there is exposure to illness. There&#39;s lots of research you can check out through LLL about specific health/developmental benefits of nursing at different stages.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-27308036">The body can do some wonderful things.  Dana would not nurse from me until<br/>
she was 4 months old.  I pumped and bottled the liquid gold.  The thing that<br/>
fascinated me the most was how my body produced what she needed no matter<br/>
what.  If she was going through a growth spurt, I made more milk.  I had no<br/>
clue what she needed, my body did.  I went from producing teaspoons to 37<br/>
ounces(over the course of a day in two pumping sessions) then she finally<br/>
&quot;got it&quot; and latched on.  Then I only pumped once a day while at work (had<br/>
to work, was the insurance carrier, hubby worked midnights and I worked<br/>
days).  We happily breastfed until she was 22 months old and I dried up - my<br/>
dad died and I had what I now know was a breakdown.<br/>
<br/>
The body is a magical thing.<br/>
