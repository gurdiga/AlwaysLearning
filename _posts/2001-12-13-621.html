<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087093345">I know, the newbie with the all the questions :-)<br/>
<br/>
I have tried for many years, unsuccessfully, to find a<br/>
mentor for my daughter in several areas.  <br/>
<br/>
First with piano.  We couldn&#39;t find a person willing<br/>
to teach her the way she wanted to learn, and after a<br/>
year of traditional piano lessons, her love of playing<br/>
was virtually murdered.  Never did recover from that<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
Then art.  Sarah has taught herself, because she has a<br/>
natural talent.  It took us many years to find an art<br/>
instructor willing to teach her *real* work, and take<br/>
her seriously, but finally, on teacher no. 3, we have<br/>
struck gold.  But that was by chance.<br/>
<br/>
Our latest frustration has been that Sarah (12yo)<br/>
wants to become an animal rehabilitation specialist,<br/>
and in the state of VA a person must be 18 to work<br/>
with wild animals (even of the rabbit and squirrel and<br/>
bird variety).  So she raises guinea pigs and has<br/>
studied animals for years, but can&#39;t go anywhere else<br/>
in the direction she wants to until she is 18.<br/>
<br/>
We have tried the volunteer route as well.  No go. <br/>
She has to be 14 to volunteer in the people hospital<br/>
and 16 to volunteer with a veterinarian.  <br/>
<br/>
I realize that people are so afraid of lawsuits that<br/>
they have these arbitrary rules set up to protect<br/>
their own hind ends, but it is sooo frustrating! <br/>
Sarah is extremely mature for her age, both physically<br/>
and emotionally.  She could easily do what is required<br/>
in any of these areas, probably better and with more<br/>
commitment than most kids older than she.<br/>
<br/>
So my question is, how does one go about finding<br/>
someone willing to take on a kid to mentor in a field<br/>
of interest?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any insight!<br/>
<br/>

At first, she tried with vets and was really discouraged. She got this <br/>
position right off the bat, after getting more specific about exactly what <br/>
she was interested in doing.<br/>
<br/>
One of the young people in our unshcool group did volunteer work at a Nature <br/>
Center working with animals of all types. She had a mentor, a person who <br/>
agreed to take her under her wing when she came to volunteer. She quickly <br/>
proved herself a real assest to that community. She was eight when she began. <br/>
Our unschool community just had a meeting on this very issue. . . and many <br/>
good ideas came from it. I think we have to re-educate the public on how <br/>
homeschoolers, and more specifically unschoolers CAN contribut and be an <br/>
assest in these situations. They need to understand we are not looking for <br/>
teachers, but rather opportunities to follow along and observe and <br/>
participate with older people. They need to be educated that they are not <br/>
performing a baby-sitting service, that these young people will show up on <br/>
time, and contribute. Our group is considering writing a manual to have on <br/>
hand for people interested in being mentors. We are beginning in &quot;our own <br/>
backyard&quot;  and trying to tap the resources of the families and extended <br/>
families and acquaintances of the unshcooling families of our organization. <br/>
<br/>
I also believe in asking the Universe, God, higher power, or however you wish <br/>
to define it for what I am ready to receive, in this case a mentor. What I <br/>
would do is make a very specific list of the qualities of the person I am <br/>
looking for and ask for that person to come into our lives. That is how my <br/>
daughter got her position.<br/>

<br/>
I cannot judge my own path and SELF, having the knowledge that I have chosen <br/>
to come here to experience these specific issues and grow, learn, and <br/>
Remember Who I Am.<br/>
