<div id="ygrps-yiv-1936905258">oh yes - thanks so much for teh reminder about shrinky dinks!  i LOVED those as a kid.  another thing that&#39;s fun is the design your own plates and bowls - you order this special paper (circles) and the kids draw on it and then you send them in and the come back as plastic bowls or plates - like bakelite - is that the material?<br/>

This made me remember fuse beads.  You put the little cylindrical beads <br/>
on the plastic pegged shapes and then you iron them and they fuse <br/>
together.  These are always a hit with the kids that visit our house.  <br/>
I guess most parents are afraid of the tiny beads getting scattered <br/>
(which they sometimes do).  <br/>
