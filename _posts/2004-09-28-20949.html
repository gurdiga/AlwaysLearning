<div id="ygrps-yiv-1380041040">My kids swear.  They do it as an explative sometimes<br/>
(when they are mad or whatever) or sometimes just<br/>
mixed causally in their speech.  Sometimes they use<br/>
the words wrong, or in odd combinations, which is<br/>
always amusing.  We encourage them not to do it away<br/>
from home, because they don&#39;t know yet when and where<br/>
it&#39;s appropriate.  Sometimes if I get tired of it<br/>
because they are doing it a lot at a certain time, I<br/>
just say &quot;hey, could you tone down the swearing a bit,<br/>
I am getting tired of it right now.&quot;  It&#39;s always as a<br/>
part of their speech though, not just swearing to be<br/>
swearing.  They are not fascinated or attached to the<br/>
words themselves.<br/>
<br/>
Often they don&#39;t swear at all for days or weeks, it<br/>
just depends.  If adults are swearing more aound them,<br/>
they will swear more.  They also &quot;get&quot; the witty<br/>
almost swear jokes in books and movies (like Shit-ake<br/>
mushrooms from the Spy Kids movies.)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t attach value to the words, we just let them<br/>
know that they are considered strong impact words and<br/>
we talk about meanings if they want to know.  One of<br/>
them swore around their grandparents during a camping<br/>
trip this summer.  From the reaction they got, I doubt<br/>
they will do it around their grandparents again any<br/>
time soon, not that we see them a lot anyways.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are 6 and almost 8, by the way.<br/>
