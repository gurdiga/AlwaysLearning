Here&#39;s a link from the science list that I thought folks here might be <br/>
interested in as well:<br/>
<br/>
The Lost Ladybug Project<br/>
http://instruct1. cit.cornell. edu/courses/ icb344/Lost_ Ladybugs. htm<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a fun summer project! As has been mentioned here before, <br/>
nature surveys are good way to have fun with &quot;real life&quot; math (in this <br/>
case, counting and measuring ladybugs and identifying them by the <br/>
number of spots they have).<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy!<br/>

This has been enlightening-I&#39;m just getting an inkling that I may have had  <br/>
some school/teaching trauma somewhere in my life! When I heard about the <br/>
Ladybug  Project, my thoughts were the same as yours: fun, time together, helping <br/>
the  scientists (and the ladybugs!) and I was really excited about it. When I <br/>
read  &quot;project&quot; I went, &quot;Eyew!&quot; and my enthusiasm dimmed greatly. Then when I <br/>
read  your post, something clicked and I realized that happens a lot when I hear <br/>
 of/read/see something fun boxed up into an &quot;educational opportunity&quot; and <br/>
started  wondering where that came from. I get so aggravated with the twisting of <br/>
 something into something else to &quot;make&quot; it &quot;educational&quot;, that I have a hard <br/>
 time, if I can even find it possible, to even look at the &quot;educational&quot; <br/>
thing.  Hmmm... I&#39;ll be mulling that for a while. Thanks for the  catalyst!<br/>

Yes!  I agree.  I think so much of the fun is sapped out of things when there&#39;s a hidden <br/>
agena--or I guess not always &quot;hidden&quot;--but so often with homeschooling families, it <br/>
seems like there is this sneaky kind of &quot;Mom&#39;s pulling one over on them and it&#39;s actually <br/>
educational&quot; kind of attitude.  <br/>
<br/>
And I don&#39;t mean that I think things can&#39;t be done for the sake of their educational value, <br/>
but it&#39;s the sneaky vibe that&#39;s been buggin&#39; me lately.  For instance, we checked out a <br/>
game that was created for learning multiplication.  There is nothing hidden about the <br/>
agenda.  I asked my son, who enjoys thinking about numbers and patterns, if he&#39;d like to <br/>
try this game that could be a fun way of learning the multiplication tables.  I didn&#39;t sidle <br/>
up to him and ask innocently if he&#39;d like to try this new game--you know the attitude I <br/>
mean.  It was all simple and straight-up.  <br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;ve definitely been in on the other kind of conversation in which the moms are <br/>
comparing notes about what their children learned that they didn&#39;t know they were <br/>
learning with a conspiratorial attitude.  Blech!!  It just feels disrespectful and <br/>
condescending to me.  I guess that&#39;s what got triggered for me with the project post.<br/>
