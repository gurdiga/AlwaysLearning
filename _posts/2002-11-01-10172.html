I&#39;d prefer to do the house/yardwork rather than pull in the big bucks by <br/>
working somewhere else. I have to remind myself of that sometimes. His <br/>
working fultime and overtime enables me to stay home and enjoy my children <br/>
and go on long trips (without him), and live this &quot;life of luxury&quot;! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I try NOT to ask Ben to do things that I am quite capable of---but at the <br/>
same time, he&#39;s happy to do what I ask if he can.<br/>
