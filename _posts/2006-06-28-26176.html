<div id="ygrps-yiv-465135774">&quot;maybe I just need to figure out how to get dinner made without being<br/>
in the kitchen for very long at a time?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Ideally, you could have him in a kitchen where he&#39;s welcome!! I&#39;d get<br/>
out of that living arrangement as fast as possible I think. Kids KNOW<br/>
when they&#39;re being treated as lesser beings and keeping him away from<br/>
something he&#39;s interested in (the kitchen) is a recipe for disaster.<br/>
<br/>
Kids NEED to be part of your world/activities from a very young age.<br/>
You&#39;re doing interesting things in there, he wants to help and feel<br/>
he&#39;s a capable partner. Jalen would not have let me put him in the<br/>
sling if I was cooking at that age either. He wanted to DO whatever I<br/>
was doing. A small stool is a wonderful took and I&#39;d just make sure to<br/>
put things back  so the uptight human in the house doesn&#39;t notice. <br/>
<br/>
Fast meals would be best at this stage of the game on many levels<br/>
though. Having a wee one can make prep time difficult even if they&#39;re<br/>
welcome. Find him some simple chopping (with a butter knife),<br/>
measuring jobs that he can do alongside you. <br/>
<br/>
You could also spend one of his naps preparing some simple meals<br/>
(lasagne, casseroles etc..) and freezing them for future use.<br/>
<br/>
As to leaving places, sometimes distraction is your best friend.<br/>
Communicate with him as the countdown continues, but also have a few<br/>
dollar store toys, interesting snacks,drinks etc... up your sleeve for<br/>
the moments when he just needs a distraction so you can leave<br/>
peacefully. Getting all the other kids packed up first usually helped<br/>
us too...he could see we were truly leaving, not just talking about it.  <br/>
<br/>
If he does start getting upset, just stop whatever you&#39;re doing and<br/>
hug him, distract him, hand him a cool toy, some ice, a drink of<br/>
water, whatever it takes to calm him before you proceed with a diaper<br/>
change or other activity. Running around naked is a great way to learn<br/>
about body functions!!:)<br/>
<br/>
Also, Jalen was a very restless sleeper the first four years of his<br/>
life (I know, that sounds like forever when your child is 18mo., but<br/>
it passes and you WILL get more sleep one day). One thing that has<br/>
helped him a LOT on stressful nights is Melatonin. I think he&#39;s just<br/>
more sensitive to lighting and it makes him more awake than his body<br/>
really wants to be. On occasional nights, I give him 1/2 of a<br/>
sublingual pill (1.5mg) to help him relax into sleep (health food<br/>
store for around $8).<br/>
With all the electrical lighting these days, some people don&#39;t make<br/>
enough melatonin, it&#39;s a natural product that has no side effects.<br/>
Won&#39;t work for everyone of course, but it&#39;s been a wonderful thing for us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-913703100">Just wanted to shout out and thanks everyone for their input.  I love this<br/>
list as it has helped me gain and change perspectives.  I *know* we need to<br/>
change our living arrangement and are working hard to do so.  I am in<br/>
process of gathering things and making things for a &quot;kitchen box&quot; as well :)<br/>
Thanks everyone!<br/>
