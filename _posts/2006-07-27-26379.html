would pass on to anyone else who might like to check it out.<br/>

In the file you will find a short article written by Anna M. Brown <br/>
entitled, &quot;Creating a Climate for Consensual Living&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Additionally there is a &quot;Consensual Living Book List&quot; which has many <br/>
of the titles I have also seen recommended in unschooling circles. <br/>

I don&#39;t want to join a mailing list to see a file.  Is there  <br/>
information about it you want to share with people short of having  <br/>
them join a list?   Tell us what you like about it, what&#39;s different  <br/>
or special or useful.<br/>
<br/>
At least give the link to its main page instead of just a  <br/>
subscription link, please, if you think it&#39;s interesting enough, or  <br/>
maybe there are webpages people can get in and out of without having  <br/>
to deal with more e-mail or dropping back off a list.<br/>
