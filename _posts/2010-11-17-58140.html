<div id="ygrps-yiv-1611996744">I posted a while back looking for fun an exciting ideas for my 3 and 5 year old while heavily pregnant... Thanks for all the help, in return I thought I&#39;d offer my new trump card to anyone else in a similar situation.<br/>
<br/>
We now have &#39;The Challenge Box&#39;, which gives us many hours of excitement, I can be involved and engaged while fairly stationary and calm, it doesn&#39;t even make much mess!  I sat down one night after they were in bed and made about 30 cards, each with a small task on it, like &#39;touch the floor of every room on the house with your elbow&#39;, &#39;count to ten in twos&#39;, &#39;think of three stripy animals&#39; etc...<br/>
<br/>
The rules are that you can skip or modify any challenge, play as a team or individually and stop whenever you&#39;ve had enough. You just pull a card out of Thr box and do what it says.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve had to make several extra sets of cards, I think we have 80 now, and it allows me to do housework/feed the baby/sit down while being actively involved in an exciting and active game.  I had intended it for my kids only but their older cousins and even uncles are keen players too!<br/>
<br/>
The only materials any challenge uses are pen and paper, and things readily found and put away.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s what we&#39;ve been doing most of today!  Lovely.<br/>
