<div id="ygrps-yiv-1613627048">&quot;Bad&quot; by conventional parenting definition, that is! :-)<br/>
<br/>
I keep stumbling across pictures of mothers gazing down in awe at  <br/>
their sleeping infants with the caption, &quot;I will love you no matter  <br/>
what.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yeah. Right. There&#39;s a real test: loving a sleeping infant. (Can you  <br/>
feel the sarcasm?)<br/>
<br/>
And it struck me what really illustrates love, what gets to the core  <br/>
of unschooling is when we&#39;re up to the challenge of still being there  <br/>
for kids when they push us out of our comfort zone.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve created a blog called:<br/>
<br/>
I Will Always Be There For You<br/>
OR The Radical Unschooling Philosophy Illustrated &lt;-- That&#39;s the  <br/>
subtitle. Not an indication I can&#39;t make up my mind ;-)<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://unschoolingphilosophyillustrated.blogspot.com/">http://unschoolingphilosophyillustrated.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve added the first post as an example :-)<br/>
<br/>
But I need your photos!<br/>
<br/>
Examples like (but not limited to):<br/>
<br/>
* Kids who&#39;ve done something that conventional parents would get mad  <br/>
about.<br/>
--&gt; Like emptying a cupboard into the hall. Like pulling up &quot;weeds&quot;  <br/>
that really weren&#39;t weeds. Like extending the driveway chalk painting  <br/>
onto the car and the house and the cat ...<br/>
<br/>
* Kids you&#39;ve helped do something that conventional parents wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
allow.<br/>
--&gt; Like messy painting. Like going up the slide instead of down. Like  <br/>
marker tattoos on any bare skin showing (one of my daughter&#39;s  <br/>
favorites!) :-)<br/>
<br/>
* Doing things with kids that most parents don&#39;t have time for.<br/>
--&gt; Like playing video games together. Like going to anime conventions  <br/>
together. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
ALSO include:<br/>
<br/>
* Caption you want under the picture.<br/>
<br/>
* Any credit for the picture.<br/>
<br/>
* A brief bit about what unschooling has meant to your relationship or  <br/>
anything else that might help people understand why what&#39;s happening  <br/>
in the photo is valuable to understand.<br/>
<br/>
* I may add a bit of unschooling philosophy to it. (And I may crop the  <br/>
photos a bit to make them fit the blog format unless you let me know  <br/>
it&#39;s not okay.)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love love to have photos to help illustrate this :-) You can find  <br/>
some, send them to:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:jfetteroll@...">jfetteroll@...</a><br/>
<br/>
At some point I&#39;ll start a Facebook group for it. The kind that sends  <br/>
you alerts and emails that there&#39;s been a new post. (I am a noob at FB  <br/>
so if anyone can offer tips, I&#39;d sure appreciate it!<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m about to start a job (one that like pays you cash for doing  <br/>
stuff!) working in the bakery at the grocery store, so like I really  <br/>
need a new project! ;-) But this one won&#39;t let me go and keeps nagging  <br/>
me to start it. I can&#39;t promise the pictures will go up fast! But I  <br/>
will do my best to get them up there since I think it could be quite  <br/>
lovely and useful for explaining unschooling. :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1436841269">I think there&#39;s an advantage, though, to a mother gazing lovingly at a sleeping child.  My mom rarely saw me asleep after I was older, because I was sent to bed while I was awake, and when I got up she was sometimes sorry I had woken up early on my own, or had just woken me up and I was cranky.  The result was that I saw her angry and pissed off too much, and she saw me sorrowful too much (or wrecked my morning joy, when I had some).   <br/>
<br/>
The idea of my mother gazing at me lovingly and thinking she would love me forever seems like a beautiful fantasy.<br/>
<br/>
So please don&#39;t think too sarcastically of the idea of a mother renewing her resolve to be a loving parent because she adores a sleeping child.  Not everyone has that in their life, as a child *or* as a parent.<br/>
<br/>
I had that peaceful, expansive feeling as a parent, many times, and it made me a better parent, to hold a child and smell him, or to pause long enough to watch a child breathing softly, in a safe place I had helped create, after they had gone to sleep gently and peacefully and happily.  Remembering in that moment to appreciate all that helped me be happy when the child arose, whether cherubically after a lovely sunrise or pukingly at 2:00 a.m.<br/>
<br/>
I think loving a child who is not at her best comes from years of loving her when she&#39;s asleep, or being ideal.  Knowing ideal is possible and is common makes the crazy moments smaller.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My most extreme case is something Holly might not want reposted on a blog (the photo of her; I&#39;m considering sending you the second of the two photos here)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/pudding">http://sandradodd.com/pudding</a><br/>
<br/>
We went straight where she was when the police called, and wrapped her up in a sheet and I drove her car back while she rode with Keith in our already-warm van, and she cried.<br/>
<br/>
I slept with her in a bed that was neither hers nor mine, far from others, and she talked and cried, and I told her not to worry, and we held hands, and she fell asleep with me wrapped around her, and I loved her completely.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll ask her if that&#39;s something she would be willing to have on your blog, Joyce.<br/>

When Dylan was little and sleeping in my arms or in bed beside me I thought about how trusting he was and how much I always wanted to be worthy of his trust.    He felt safe enough to fall asleep in my arms and I wanted to make sure that I would always be the person he could feel safe with, that he could always count on me for security and comfort.      That made all the rest of the day or night easier.   <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re right. Sarcasm isn&#39;t a very positive tool! I don&#39;t want those  <br/>
ideal visions to go away. I&#39;m not the least bit sarcastic towards the  <br/>
moms. It&#39;s sweet wanting that feeling to last forever.<br/>
<br/>
But that vision is the only (common and familiar) positive,  <br/>
relationship building tool they have to navigate the next 18 years  <br/>
with a child. And those parents who can&#39;t figure out how to make that  <br/>
tool move them towards the ideal when they face the challenges of  <br/>
awake active kids will feel like failures. It&#39;s unfortunate the moms  <br/>
live in a society that turns them towards relationship damaging tools.<br/>
<br/>
I guess it&#39;s the artists, not the subjects, I&#39;m being too rough on,  <br/>
expecting more of. But artists illuminate reality. Like Anita  <br/>
Renfroe&#39;s Momisms (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://youtu.be/YYukEAmoMCQ)">http://youtu.be/YYukEAmoMCQ)</a> And artists also  <br/>
create ideal visions. (Like moms gazing lovingly down on their  <br/>
sleeping infants.) Artists don&#39;t help people navigate reality to get  <br/>
to ideal. It&#39;s awesome that you and Deb (and others) could use that  <br/>
vision of ideal as a tool to help whenever life was less than ideal. I  <br/>
think that&#39;s the exception, though. Most parents need better tools and  <br/>
understanding of how bad the tools are that conventional society  <br/>
approves of.<br/>
<br/>
Artists can&#39;t depict what they don&#39;t know exists. It&#39;s visionaries who  <br/>
illuminate paths to the ideal. Even better are visionaries who are  <br/>
navigating the paths themselves, figuring out how to help others do  <br/>
the same.<br/>
<br/>
But since I&#39;m an artist who does know about better tools, I can help  <br/>
illuminate that reality. (With other people&#39;s help.) And I shouldn&#39;t  <br/>
be finding fault with artists who just can&#39;t know another way of  <br/>
living with kids.<br/>

asleep in the living room or in from the car after a drive-in movie, for <br/>
example. I was mostly asleep, but aware of him being there - strong and <br/>
careful with me - and I felt SO safe and comfortable and happy. And that <br/>
trust lasted - it lasted even through times when my dad wasn&#39;t very <br/>
worthy of trust when I was an older teen and he was a secret alcoholic. <br/>
And I think it had an effect on him, too, because even when he flaked on <br/>
everybody else, he was there for me.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;ll be honest, Joyce, and say it concerns me a bit - the idea of <br/>
putting together a collection of photos of unschooled kids behaving <br/>
badly. (If I&#39;ve understood correctly what you have in mind. I guess it <br/>
is because I&#39;ve become aware of a LOT of bashing of unschooling going on <br/>
in homeschooling circles, and the main accusation is that our kids <br/>
behave badly and we unschooling parents don&#39;t do anything about it. It <br/>
feels like it could be handing them ammunition. But maybe I&#39;ve <br/>
misunderstood exactly what you are creating.<br/>
<br/>
It is usually pretty easy to notice when kids behave badly and often <br/>
quite difficult for others to see and understand what the unschooling <br/>
parent is doing about it. And, there are the occasional unschooling <br/>
parents who are at a loss and are not really doing anything about <br/>
chronic problematic behaviors.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I understood Joyce&#39;s idea differently. When she asked for photos of  <br/>
what conventional parents might consider &quot;bad&quot; it occurred to me that  <br/>
&quot;bad&quot; meant unusual or breaking conventional &quot;rules&quot; about what kids  <br/>
should do to grow up and be the people those parents want them to be.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend (actually an ex-friend) who wouldn&#39;t be caught dead at  <br/>
an anime convention with her daughter. She wouldn&#39;t be caught dead at  <br/>
anything her daughter likes in fact, but if it&#39;s what *she* the mother  <br/>
wants, her girl has to go along with it.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parents tend to separate &quot;things my kid likes to do&quot; from  <br/>
&quot;things I want him to do.&quot;  Unschooling parents tend to encourage,  <br/>
support, provide advice, and do what their kids like to do. That would  <br/>
preclude (usually) things that are illegal or injurious to others. And  <br/>
if those kinds of things do happen, unschooling parents help their  <br/>
kids, they don&#39;t ignore them nor punish them.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of one friend whose daughter is a master of makeup,  <br/>
costuming and hair coloring. Her mom supports her fully. She looks  <br/>
awesome, but people have looked at her and think &quot;goth&quot; = &quot;bad&quot; or  <br/>
&quot;disaffected youth.&quot;  Some of her friends dress in similar ways, but  <br/>
their parents definitely prefer that they didn&#39;t or couldn&#39;t care less  <br/>
or have kicked them out of the house. It&#39;s a completely different  <br/>
mindset.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m thinking that some people, unschooling or otherwise, might look at  <br/>
pulling up weeds that aren&#39;t weeds as a &quot;bad&quot; thing. But there&#39;s a  <br/>
difference in how the parent sees and reacts to it. An unschooling  <br/>
parent might caption such a photo &quot;Binky pulled up the hyacinths, in  <br/>
her glee to pull weeds in the garden with me. Together, we took a look  <br/>
at the how the roots were different and that the hyacinth had a bulb  <br/>
and talked about how it would bloom into beautiful fragrant blossoms  <br/>
if we put it back into the earth.&quot; A conventional parent might have a  <br/>
fit over a child pulling out a hyacinth and shame her for that, if not  <br/>
punish her.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s what I was thinking when I read what Joyce was  <br/>
proposing &lt;g&gt;.<br/>

<br/>
So yesterday I was taking Gigi for her almost daily pony rides on her pony Honey and everytime we go by a certain tree Honey  tries to eat the leaves.<br/>
The two of us always laugh at it and I said to Honey :&quot; Honey voce e uma sem-vergonha&quot; which translates to : <br/>
&quot;You are shameless&quot; . It was all said in a loving way as &quot;sem-vergonha&quot; can be used in a sweet way in Portuguese.<br/>
So Gigi asked me was it meant and I translated to her, Then she asked me what shame was. Boy did I have a hard time giving an example that she could understand.<br/>
 She is not ashamed of going out in costumes, with her face painted all colors  or anything like that. She is not ashamed  in dancing and singing and asking questions.<br/>
I do have a lot of pictures of my kids doing things other parents will cringe but Brian and I thought they were so much fun like painting themselves head to toe,  fingerpainting with cake, and some other cute ones~!<br/>
My kids also love to hear stories of when they were babies and had explosive poop or peed on us.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-91141964">Would you consider stories too...<br/>
<br/>
My middle son Martin, eleven, talks constantly--gushes impossible<br/>
wonderful ideas from time travel to anything that catches his<br/>
interest.  Most adults get extremely annoyed when they hear him<br/>
speaking to me, coupled with the fact that rather than Mommy he often<br/>
calls me Marina.  They would rather talk to me about adult things and<br/>
think I take him too seriously.  There is still a strong current of<br/>
children being seen rather than heard surrounding parenting streams,<br/>
even the most &quot;liberal&quot;.  That I enjoy listening to him at age twelve<br/>
and am respectful of his ideas draws nasty remarks on occasion.<br/>
<br/>
Today, Rowan(fifteen) my oldest son came into the kitchen as I was<br/>
cleaning up and remarked:  &quot;I am starting to like talking to Martin,<br/>
even though he drives me crazy because his relentless examination and<br/>
questioning of everything is a family trait.  He&#39;s actually a pretty<br/>
smart guy and he&#39;s starting to grow up and listen better than he used<br/>
to&quot;.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well - I have a lot of confidence in you, personally, Joyce. That goes <br/>
without saying. The &quot;idea&quot; of it is, as I said, a little bit of a <br/>
concern to me. Even if it is more unconventional stuff than actually bad <br/>
behavior, I&#39;m still confessing to having a little twinge of concern over <br/>
unschoolers being viewed as anti-social and parents as &#39;un-parents.&#39; <br/>
Maybe it is just where I live, but I feel like I&#39;m on the defense a lot, <br/>
these days, over this issue of the behavior of unschooled kids and <br/>
whether or not their parents are being appropriately responsive.<br/>
<br/>
  I think it is fantastic that unschooling parents will support their <br/>
kids when they are unconventional and want to do things that mainstream <br/>
parents might scoff at and refuse to consider or allow. I&#39;ve definitely <br/>
been one of those parents, at times. On the other hand, unschooling <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean being purposely unconventional or &quot;bad&quot; for the sake of <br/>
being that way, but that&#39;s what I sometimes see sort of glorified by <br/>
unschooling parents. Sometimes they seem to take pleasure in making <br/>
other parents uncomfortable, for example, like it proves they are great <br/>
unschooling parents because they let their kids do what other parents <br/>
object to. And sometimes those things are relatively harmless, but <br/>
sometimes they are actually anti-social behaviors - inconsiderate, rude, <br/>
or even hurtful or dangerous to others.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not objecting to your project, Joyce. Just saying it brought up this <br/>
twinge of concern that&#39;s been bothering me for quite a while now about <br/>
how unschooling seems more and more often promoted by unschoolers in <br/>
this particular way.<br/>
<br/>
I mean - it IS unconventional to not school our kids, of course, so <br/>
unschoolers are nonconformists, by definition. I&#39;m maybe getting a <br/>
little tired of others seeming to be so surprised that my unschooled <br/>
kids are so well socialized and so conventional in their adult choices. <br/>
People have said to me that they are surprised that my kids seem so <br/>
&quot;normal.&quot; I&#39;ve been feeling like our unschooling credentials are <br/>
considered questionable, these days, because my kids are making pretty <br/>
conventional choices for 20-somethings. Again, I&#39;m just explaining and <br/>
evaluating my own reaction - it is my personal reaction and might be of <br/>
interest to others, but I&#39;m not trying to sway Joyce to do something <br/>
different.<br/>
<br/>
I might regret sending this because if I think more about it, I might <br/>
have some different things to say, but I&#39;m going to send it now with the <br/>
caveat that it is just part of something that I&#39;m still thinking about <br/>
and considering. Still a but mushy in my head, but there is something <br/>
there and I&#39;m trying to articulate it.<br/>

&gt; Before I saw your response I was thinking of photos you took the night I dug a mud-pit in the side yard after the sun went down.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There is a sweet story to go with it too: I had a splinter in my foot- suppose because I was out there in the muddy darkness with no shoes- and after I showered I stayed wrapped in a towel on your bed until we got it out. It was late at night and all the boys were gone- I think at an SCA event- I remember crying some because it hurt, and feeling embarrassed (I was just at that age) to not have more/better clothes on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I&#39;m not positive where those photos are, or if one may already be scanned? But that seems to better fit Joyce&#39;s idea for the blog anyway than the Punisher-pudding story. I mean, if you actually had pictures OF the wrestling, I&#39;d say maybe!!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957639755">I read Joyce&#39;s post immediately after catching an episode of Dr. Phil (never <br/>
watch TV, somehow ended up there) where he was admonishing parents to control <br/>
their child&#39;s (especially teens) access to computers, cell phones, and the <br/>
internet or you were just courting danger.  The episode involved teen girls who <br/>
met strangers (men) over the internet.<br/>
<br/>
A year and a half ago my (then) 15 year old daughter was on Chat Roulette (yes, <br/>
that Chat Roulette) and met a really cool 17 year old boy from England.  He <br/>
visited us last August; she spent 3 weeks with his family over Christmas in <br/>
England and Wales.  She is currently a month into a 3-month visit to his family <br/>
and will likely get to visit Scotland this trip.<br/>
<br/>
Some people are shocked that I have &quot;allowed&quot; my 16-yr-old to visit virtual <br/>
strangers in a foreign country for &lt;gasp!&gt; 3 months, especially an <br/>
18-yr-old BOY!<br/>
<br/>
Wish I had a pic of her on her laptop.  That internet is a dangerous place.<br/>

I spent almost a year traveling the whole country and going to dog shows and working very hard and learning what I wanted to learn.<br/>
It was the amazing. My parents trusted me and supported me. I was not unschooled but my parents did so many things that I hope I am doing for my children.<br/>
Needles to say I am close to my mom and dad and I am very confident on my abilities  and I thing that &quot;trip&quot; was one of the things that made me such a confident person.<br/>

she flew -- alone! -- to Warsaw to meet a girl she&#39;d been writing  <br/>
stories with and talking about their characters on Subeta (one of  <br/>
those adopt a pet sites and play games with them like the biggie  <br/>
that&#39;s slipping my mind.) I have pictures of her and Mara in Warsaw I  <br/>
can use. (Boy, that&#39;s going to require some careful wording to make it  <br/>
not sound as scary as conventional parents will want to read into it!)<br/>
<br/>
Predators don&#39;t need to spend 5 years making up stories about little  <br/>
creatures! They have radar for needy kids. All they need to say is  <br/>
some form of &quot;I understand. I&#39;m willing to listen and be your friend.&quot;  <br/>
And their focus shifts to personal rather than what the kids are on  <br/>
the site to do. Kids who are confident their parents are there to help  <br/>
them don&#39;t need to turn to strangers for that.<br/>
