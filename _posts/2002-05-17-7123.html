<div id="ygrps-yiv-843905075">Hello all,<br/>
<br/>
I just joined a few weeks ago and I am soooo glad to have found this group.  I live in Salt Lake City, and have never heard about a submarine testing facility here in Utah.  I&#39;m going to ask my husband, the geography/geology/history/military coverup expert in our family, and see what we can dig up.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been really enjoying the relocation discussions, too.  We&#39;re looking to leave Utah in the next few years, even though we don&#39;t want to go too far--maybe Idaho or Wyoming (the Salt Lake valley is getting too crowded for our taste).  If anyone on the list is from northern Idaho or northern Wyoming, I&#39;d love to hear how you like it.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2038016070">I&#39;m formerly from N. Idaho, and my husband was born<br/>
and raised there...and although it is beautiful, can<br/>
you say LEAD POISONING?  ;)  Not a great place to<br/>
raise kids--at least along the I-90 corridor.  Further<br/>
north, like Sandpoint, is very nice, and further<br/>
south, like Moscow, is also nice, although that&#39;s not<br/>
called &quot;north&quot; idaho, at least unless you&#39;re from<br/>
extreme southern idaho! ;)<br/>
<br/>
We lived in Challis for a few years, and it&#39;s nice<br/>
there, if you don&#39;t mind -40 winters.  Salt Lake was<br/>
out nearest &quot;big city&quot;, although it was 6 hours or so<br/>
away, and we would go holiday shopping there every<br/>
year.  If you are looking to get &quot;away from it all&quot;,<br/>
Challis is perfect (200 miles from a mall!)<br/>
