<div id="ygrps-yiv-1770703759">My son George is also 12.  His user name is Superman5606.  My daughter Nola is 10--her user name is effie5413.  Please ask you son to add them to his friends list.  George and Nola say to tell him, &quot;see you there!&quot;    Also, we are planning on going to the Live and Learn Conference in St. Louis in October.  We were talking last night about how neat it would be to meet some of their on-line friends there.   Deirdre<br/>

&gt; We are new to the group, but my 12 year old son plays a lot of<br/>
&gt; Runescape and we saw that there were others so we wanted to give his<br/>
&gt; user name so he could get in touch with some other kids who are<br/>
&gt; unschooled. </span></blockquote></div>
