<div id="ygrps-yiv-1211281524">A friend who has homeschooled for several years just told me <br/>
she &quot;highly recommends&quot; I join HSLDA.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked her why, she said it was worth it for the security, and <br/>
also they would represent you for much cheaper than any lawyer if you <br/>
ever got in trouble with the law.<br/>
<br/>
I had not gotten the impression they were a wonderful organiziation, <br/>
but when I thought about it, I realized I really don&#39;t know anything <br/>
about them. Could anyone please give me their experience or opinions <br/>
about them? Do they, in fact, provide true security and representation <br/>
for their members?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

  Meanwhile, education--compulsory schooling, compulsory learning--is a tyranny and a crime against the human mind and spirit.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well, the scope of what they&#39;ll defend is limited - it&#39;s not &quot;if you<br/>
ever got in trouble&quot;. Also, as an unschooler you may not qualify for<br/>
their services. Anyone can become a member (they&#39;ll be happy to take<br/>
your money) but they do not guarantee representation to anyone and<br/>
this is especially true if you are not using a curriculum. I think<br/>
their definition of homeschooling is very narrow and constrictive.<br/>
Something that might be helpful to consider: The most common legal<br/>
situation involving homeschooling is divorce - one parent wants to<br/>
continue homeschooling the kids and the other does not - however,<br/>
HSLDA will not get involved with such cases.<br/>
<br/>
Something else to think about: When they pursue legislative changes in<br/>
both state and federal govt, they tend to mix homeschooling issues<br/>
with political and religious advocacy. This may be fine for some but I<br/>
think it muddles things, weakens homeschooling laws (their involvement<br/>
in some situations has actually made things worse) and is confusing<br/>
for lawmakers. They claim to speak for all homeschoolers when they<br/>
most certainly do not. Their religious agenda, political meddling, and<br/>
attention-seeking actions has unfortunately helped to promote the<br/>
image of homeschoolers as religious fundamentalists.<br/>
<br/>
Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, in the vast majority of cases<br/>
we do not need lawyers to represent us. We make effective advocates<br/>
for ourselves when we know and understand the laws of our state and<br/>
stand up firmly for our rights. Although it can be a bit unnerving to<br/>
be challenged in some way by a govt or school employee, legal counsel<br/>
is rarely needed and things can usually be resolved with a phone call<br/>
or a letter. Not always, but usually. And for those unlikely instances<br/>
where a lawyer would prove extremely helpful, there is no guarantee<br/>
that HSLDA will come to your aid in a way that is beneficial or<br/>
effective. So I&#39;d save my money.<br/>

limiting the scope of marriage in America. Whether you agree with the<br/>
amendment or not, it&#39;s not a homeschooling issue on any level.<br/>

Also -- I won&#39;t pay for fear mongering! There plenty of places giving away<br/>
reasons for Living in Fear, which I strive to avoid in my life, I&#39;d never<br/>
*pay* to perpetuate their platforms nor their fears.<br/>
