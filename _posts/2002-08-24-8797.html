<div id="ygrps-yiv-807642078">Julian has been going crazy with his guitar lately and last night he decided <br/>
to stay up late and play.<br/>
<br/>
This morning he announced he wrote a song. It&#39;s REALLY good, with guitar <br/>
chords and everything... we were very impressed. <br/>
<br/>
Hey, for folks going to SC -- Julian is planning to bring his Magic cards, <br/>
and would love others interested to do so as well.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1645665278">Kathryn,  I like your son.<br/>
I have ever since I heard the story about the little critters living in<br/>
his curly hair.  <br/>
What a cool kid. <br/>
