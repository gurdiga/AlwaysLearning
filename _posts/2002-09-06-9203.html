&lt;&lt; Start looking for video game groups he can join. Video game conferences he<br/>
 might like to attend. Science fiction conventions sometimes have gaming<br/>
 tie-ins. His favorite TV shows will have websites and fan clubs and message<br/>
 boards and email groups and maybe local real-life groups. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion, it really sounds good. He loves the Yugioh trading <br/>
league, I don&#39;t want it to sound like he does absolutely nothing else. But <br/>
it&#39;s rare.<br/>
At home tv/video games are all he wants. I can get him to go places though, <br/>
he still likes some of that.<br/>
