-=-husband was reading this morning about vigilantes in Montana.   In the<br/>
town of Bannack in 1864 a man was confronted  by a mob who  fired on him,<br/>
wounded him, dragged his wounded self out of his cabin and  shot him six<br/>
times.  After he was dead he was tied to a pole and the  mob fired more<br/>
than a hundred rounds into him.  They then burned his  cabin and threw his<br/>
body into the flames.  None of those guys ever  watched TV. &lt;g&gt;  -=-<br/>

 <br/>
Where I live, there are guys who cruise around and go to bars or drink in  <br/>
parking lots, and later when they&#39;re drunk they cruise around some more and  <br/>
sometimes they shoot at each other, or others.  In *every single case* the  world <br/>
would have been a better place had they been home watching TV.<br/>
 <br/>
-=-Humans have eyes and we see in color.   We had eyes to see  with long<br/>
before there were written words to decipher.-=-<br/>
 <br/>
And we listened to others tell stories and sing songs and play instruments  <br/>
long before there was written word.  TV and movies have music, and  beautiful <br/>
voices.<br/>
