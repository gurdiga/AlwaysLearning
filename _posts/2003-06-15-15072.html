&lt;&lt; Living in the country as we do..makes unschooling so easy I think..we<br/>
have<br/>
a<br/>
<br/>
pond, fields, woods nearby, a creek too.. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I was reading fast (and still trying to catch up with my mail!) and what I<br/>
read was &quot;I think we have a pond, fields, woods.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I thought, &quot;How can she not KNOW if she has a pond!?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But I&#39;m in New Mexico where a pond isn&#39;t always a pond, and arroyos are<br/>
usually sandboxes, but occasionally raging rivers of certain death, so it<br/>
did take<br/>
more parts of a second for me to look back and see what it REALLY said.  It<br/>
was a fun second-section, though, to think someone could have a pond, or<br/>
THINK<br/>
she had a pond.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, easily amused<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Glad to provide some amusement Sandra.. it&#39;s for sure a pond..LOL.. and<br/>
tomorrow morning very early, my family and I are all going fishing/boating<br/>
at a local lake.. but only &#39;if&#39; I get off this computer and to bed, so I can<br/>
be up extra early to milk the goats.. A Father&#39;s Day fishing trip..should be<br/>
a fun day!!<br/>
