<div id="ygrps-yiv-1124501713">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping to stop posting for a while and just read, but I find I need your input again.<br/>
<br/>
Nearly every night around 10:00, my 9yo daughter will come to me and tell me she&#39;s sleepy, we&#39;ll crawl into her bed together, and I&#39;ll read her a story until she falls asleep (or I do &lt;g&gt;).  After she&#39;s asleep, I&#39;ll get up and hang out with dh or do my own thing for a while until I&#39;m ready to go to bed.  So far, so good.<br/>
<br/>
At some point during the night dd would wake up and come to our (the parents&#39;) bed, and sleep with us the rest of the night.  Dh was OK with that until recently.  He said it was getting too crowded, he couldn&#39;t sleep comfortably, and anyway she&#39;s old enough to sleep on her own.  He&#39;s not trying to teach her independence, he just wants to be more comfortable and he figures she&#39;s old enough to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
When I told dd about getting too crowded in our bed, and maybe it was time for her to stay in her own bed, she was unhappy, so I told her to just come tap me awake and I would go back to her bed with her.  Now dh is grumpy again because he doesn&#39;t have his wife in bed with him.  He said he might as well be out of town on business if he was going to have to sleep alone.  <br/>
<br/>
So I was thinking I could put a mat down in our room each night, and tell dd to go there when she wakes up so that we&#39;ll still all be in the same room together (haven&#39;t suggested it yet).  The problem with that idea is that just last night she told me how much she loves having a bed mate.  It&#39;s not out of fear of the dark or being alone that she wants to co-sleep.  It&#39;s for the togetherness (same as dh).<br/>
<br/>
I could talk to dh about getting a king-size bed, but I don&#39;t think he&#39;ll want to spend a big chunk of money on something neither of us really wants so that our 9yo can continue sleeping with her parents for a few more years.<br/>
<br/>
And she&#39;s not at all interested in sleeping with her older brother.  The dog sleeps with ds, and the rabbit doesn&#39;t make a good sleeping companion...<br/>
<br/>
So all I&#39;m left with is choosing whom to make unhappy, and right now it&#39;s looking like it&#39;s my daughter who will have to adjust.  I feel sad about that, but what else is there to do?  Is there another option I haven&#39;t thought of?  Is there something I could say to my husband that might soften his position?  I don&#39;t really blame him for wanting what he wants.  Is there some transition I could do with my daughter to make her feel better?  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Get a twin bed - just the plain metal frame for it to sit on - and the <br/>
cheapest box spring/mattress set you can find. Put it right up against <br/>
your bed. Try swap meets, Big Lots, IKEA, and Costco for bargains.<br/>
<br/>
My wonderful about-to-turn -19 year old was like this - she didn&#39;t want <br/>
to sleep off in her own bed - she would still crawl into bed with us <br/>
when she was a teenager. Now she still likes to fall asleep on the couch <br/>
in the living room with other people right there with her. She&#39;ll wake <br/>
up and go off to her room and sleep most of the night there, but she <br/>
really almost never just goes to her own room and goes to sleep there.<br/>
<br/>
My husband, luckily, had no issues over co-sleeping at all. Everybody <br/>
going off and sleeping in their own isolated bedrooms is what seems <br/>
unnatural to him. He grew up in Iran - it was hot in the summer and they <br/>
all slept on the rooftop  - everybody in the family.   In the winter, it <br/>
was cold and they all slept in the one room that they heated. He slept <br/>
every night holding his mother&#39;s hand.<br/>
<br/>
But - there is the need for everybody to be comfortable and our style of <br/>
beds isn&#39;t really made for having 3 or more people in one. So - figure <br/>
out how to make everybody comfy - it is very possible.<br/>

I find that a twin next to our bed helps, even if nobody sleeps in it.  It lets you use the big bed all the way to the edges without worrying about falling off!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-357793923">I&#39;m a single mom. My older two children (17 and 15) sleep in their own rooms but my youngest child (7) sleeps in my room. When we moved into our own house 4 years ago, she did have her own room but ended up coming in and sleeping with me every night. I didn&#39;t mind at all. The only issue was that I only have a twin bed as well so as she starting getting bigger, the room in the bed got smaller. Lol. I gave away her toddler bed (that had been in her room). And I bought a twin bed for her which I put into my room. She did sleep there for a while but I still found that she would climb in bed with me during the night. So, finally, I pushed our two twin beds together. It&#39;s worked perfectly. She&#39;s still right beside me but we both have room to move. I realize that my situation is different because I don&#39;t have a husband involved. I guess that I just wanted to say that I agree with the others that have responded saying that a twin bed pushed up right next to your bed might just solve your issues. Hope this helps. :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-557138149">My little ones (two and three yr old) have a mat they can come and sleep on next to our bed, it gets used every other night or so.. But I really like the twin bed idea. We may have to do that when the next baby comes as we are a bit squished when they choose to climb in our queen size bed instead of sleeping on the mat so I don&#39;t know even where the baby would fit.<br/>
