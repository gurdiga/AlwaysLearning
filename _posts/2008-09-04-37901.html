<div id="ygrps-yiv-83950245">Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the question:<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone think that there is a problem with &quot;addiction&quot; to these<br/>
games?  Is there any room for &quot;self-discipline&quot; as such?<br/>
<br/>
That being said - for some background - I&#39;m a resolute unschooler - I<br/>
don&#39;t believe in keeping your kids out of an environment only to<br/>
reproduce it at home - I&#39;ve read several posts today concerning kids<br/>
who &quot;want&quot; to go to school - I have a 14yo who never &#39;said&#39; she wanted<br/>
to go to school but shows discontent & resentment - I think partly<br/>
from watching things like &quot;High School Musical&quot; & all of the teen<br/>
shows centered on school like &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot; & &quot;Zoe 101&quot; PLUS I&#39;ve<br/>
had &#39;well-meaning&#39; friends and family (even DH) expressing concern<br/>
about their long-term future (like how will they get work) & &#39;being<br/>
socialized&#39; (to which I reply I&#39;m not interested in my children become<br/>
socialists or programmed to be worker-bees then I tell them my<br/>
children are very sociable :)  But I think in private conversations<br/>
with my daughter they try to sway her with all she&#39;s &#39;missing&#39; -<br/>
Although I do believe she would do well in school, as such, as she has<br/>
a competitive spirit - I did read a lot of responses about having a<br/>
rich & varied social life - I&#39;m working on that - right now she&#39;s<br/>
getting it via church - lol - I do realize that some people are<br/>
uncomfortable with no &#39;real&#39; schooling even though these very same<br/>
people will complain or state how they have to be very involved in<br/>
schooling & set some teachers straight & the bad habits their kids<br/>
pick up & one hires tutors for their &#39;dyslexic&#39; only child whom they<br/>
put through expensive programs & kept in summer camps all this past<br/>
summer (at least 3 camps) - maybe even jealous that I don&#39;t feel the<br/>
need to kowtow to society&#39;s pressure or are so insecure in themselves<br/>
&/or their children that they leave teaching up to the &#39;experts&#39; -<br/>
like I tell them & my children - if public schooling is so great -<br/>
where are all the inventors/geniuses & why are children learning less<br/>
now than ever - why do kids from Asia & India come here not even<br/>
knowing English & within 2 years or so, become the valedictorian of<br/>
the graduating class - why do kids graduate h.s. illiterate - why is<br/>
there such a variance in achievement - top of the class to barely<br/>
passing?  so I call it the &#39;public fool system.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
I had one friend tell me that because my husband & I were so &#39;smart&#39;<br/>
that she knew all of our children would be geniuses even if we never<br/>
taught them a lesson - apparently, pressure got to her later, as she<br/>
enrolled her children in online school (Calvert, I believe) & STRONGLY<br/>
suggested I do the same - I even let her test my oldest - which came<br/>
out favorably - for never having one formal lesson she scored very<br/>
well - but this same friend had her children doing hours of lessons<br/>
every day since like 6yo & still has little or no faith in her<br/>
childrens&#39; intelligence, her oldest teenage boy, 16 or 17, she&#39;s<br/>
already &#39;written off&#39; as being &#39;just a mechanic,&#39; because he&#39;s not the<br/>
&#39;intellectual&#39; she is.<br/>
<br/>
I believe in my childrens&#39; native intelligence - but I sometimes need<br/>
the support that I&#39;m okay & they&#39;re okay - it&#39;s hard, when you&#39;re<br/>
ingrained with &#39;you have to do something productive&#39; to think that<br/>
playing RPGs non-stop all day & night until the wee hours of the<br/>
morning is &quot;normal&quot; - granted - I&#39;m a night owl - so is the family<br/>
entire - early for us is 9am - hardly anyone wakes up before then<br/>
(8:30 at the earliest) my 14yo can easily sleep until 11 or 12 noon<br/>
<br/>
I &#39;let&#39; my children go to church, although I don&#39;t go at all & I<br/>
believe this is just another conditioning (like the &quot;Four Agreements&quot;<br/>
by Don Miguel Ruiz, which I highly recommend) & I raise my kids to be<br/>
free-thinkers - unprogrammed - allowed to let their brains think &<br/>
learn the way that&#39;s natural to them - a Baptist church group has a<br/>
&quot;bus kids&quot; program that picks up all these kids & my 2 daughters were<br/>
first lured there by a pizza party - then liked the social aspect -<br/>
got &quot;saved&quot; - now my daughters want me to go to elevate them from &quot;bus<br/>
kids&quot; status - lol - I was raised Jehovah&#39;s Witness - so this goes<br/>
totally against my own indoctrination/training/conditioning haha<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve read a bit about the video games & respect & it&#39;s altered my<br/>
thinking somewhat - although I was coming to this conclusion -<br/>
However, I have seen grown men (25yo+) &#39;neglect&#39; their families to<br/>
play video games - although some do sit with their children while<br/>
playing - my concern is - why does it seem some people don&#39;t &#39;grow out<br/>
of it?&#39;  My dad was a Radio Shack aficionado so we had the very first<br/>
videos games - like Pong & Tandy tape recorder games & I did my share<br/>
of fighting over game time (5 of us) but mostly decided it was sort of<br/>
a waste of time & read books or did crafts instead.<br/>
<br/>
How about I have 5 kids & the stress & arguing & crying (esp my 5yo<br/>
DS) they do over playing games & not being able to play (the older<br/>
kids dominating the computers) - even when I allow them &#39;free reign&#39;<br/>
the older ones will not usually &#39;take turns?&#39; - all of my children<br/>
have pretty much unlimited access to the internet - but I, also, get<br/>
frustrated when chores go undone & calls for them go unheeded due to<br/>
the extreme wrapping up in the game (Maple Story, currently - but<br/>
there was Runescape & Neopets & Gaia & Tektek) They are, also, pretty<br/>
wrapped up in youtube & myspace (14yo)  BTW - now 3 (14yo DD, 11yo DS<br/>
8yo DD) of my kids have their own computer set up - only my 5yo DS &<br/>
2yo DD don&#39;t - but my 5yo wants to play all the time too<br/>
<br/>
Is there no concern about them playing & interacting together & all of<br/>
us as a family? - I know some will say - play with them - I&#39;ve done<br/>
that before on Neopets - I used to play as one of my kids&#39; accounts -<br/>
usually whoever was logged in at the time - play games & win them<br/>
points & sometimes trophies - I have so much to do that it&#39;s hard for<br/>
me to justify that - my kids will all play Maple Story at the same<br/>
time - so I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re interacting that way - so, I suppose<br/>
I&#39;m struggling between the constant, untiring gaming (is this more<br/>
pronounced because I&#39;m sometimes adamant against playing so freakin&#39;<br/>
much!), the lack of rest, the radiation from the computer & monitor,<br/>
the physical inactivity, the apparent obsession, etc, & wanting them<br/>
to do more &#39;organic&#39; things like play outside, create, draw, play<br/>
music, read?  My son basically taught himself to read via Runescape &<br/>
my 8yo is like someone else&#39;s DD was/is on this list who goes around<br/>
saying she can&#39;t read yet (my 2 oldest taught themselves to read at<br/>
8yo - she&#39;ll be 9 in October)- so I&#39;m showing her that she actually<br/>
CAN read & just has to relax & let it happen - my 5yo can put in his<br/>
username, password AND pin for Maple Story - so I don&#39;t think RPG are<br/>
ALL bad - just all-consuming.<br/>
<br/>
Aimee<br/>
<br/>
Thanx for reading - lol<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I addressed the background & other info to sorta pre-answer<br/>
questions that I saw as likely to crop up as in other threads.</div>

<br/>
Were they able to play as long and as much as they wanted as kids?<br/>
<br/>
Do they have stressful jobs they need to wind down from?<br/>
<br/>
Do they use it as a way to avoid something in the home? (The more  <br/>
they&#39;re nagged to engage, the more they&#39;re likely to pull away!)<br/>
<br/>
Why can&#39;t video gaming be a legitimate interest like golf or building  <br/>
miniature railroads or reading?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>While it&#39;s not safe to make statements about any particular girl,  <br/>
gaming is more commonly a guy thing. Despite the anti-sexism people&#39;s  <br/>
insistence we&#39;re all the same, guys and girls are different.<br/>
<br/>

 </span></blockquote>We do need to help them figure out how to negotiate and find ways to  <br/>
get what they want without stepping on others&#39; toes. I don&#39;t think  <br/>
kids want to hurt each other, but if someone is in the way of what  <br/>
they want it takes some heavy duty social skills to figure out how to  <br/>
get it in ways that are respectful. I think it&#39;s perfectly natural  <br/>
for kids to use power when they can. Which means they need help  <br/>
figuring out better ways.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>If they were as engaged in Harry Potter&#39;s last book to the point  <br/>
where they didn&#39;t hear you, would you feel as upset?<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it great that they can find something that engaging besides a  <br/>
book series that comes along once or twice in a childhood?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s certainly *inconvenient* but a lot of that is caused by  <br/>
expectations of how they should be have. If you turn it around and  <br/>
expect that they&#39;re so engaged that they can&#39;t hear, that they won&#39;t  <br/>
want to put something down immediately, your frustration will go down.<br/>
<br/>

&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, definitely. Try recasting it as something else. What if they  <br/>
were as engaged in something you valued?<br/>
<br/>
But why should your judgement of what should be valued be important  <br/>
in how they choose to spend their time? Do you want your husband to  <br/>
do that to you? (To get the proper feel, you need to imagine him not  <br/>
valuing something you do value, like fluffy mystery novels or  <br/>
something.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the lack of rest,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sometimes things are way more engaging than the day can hold.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter&#39;s favorite activities take up a lot of time: drawing,  <br/>
playing guitar, watching music videos, writing, talking with friends.  <br/>
She really hates getting up late because she finds it hard to fit it  <br/>
all into the day. But she also finds it hard to stop talking to her  <br/>
friends late at night because that&#39;s when they&#39;re available. She&#39;s  <br/>
gone to bed at 3 or 4 and gets upset if she&#39;s not up by 8.<br/>
<br/>
We did find one good thing about school though! Her friends can&#39;t  <br/>
stay up past 11:30 now ;-) It would be more useful for her in the  <br/>
long run to have gotten to a point where she could say &quot;I need to go  <br/>
to bed,&quot; but it&#39;s all part of the process of learning about who they  <br/>
are and their limitations and how far they can push things.<br/>
<br/>
All that just is. But when they *need* to do something else (like  <br/>
spend time with a boyfriend or girlfriend ;-) they will find ways to  <br/>
do that.<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re getting frustrated, that&#39;s your cue to help them  <br/>
brainstorm ways to get what they&#39;re trying to get in safe and  <br/>
respectful ways. If they&#39;re happy, then you&#39;ve stepped into the role  <br/>
of fun police.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the radiation from the computer & monitor,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That&#39;s old old information. (I&#39;ve reposted something about this down  <br/>
below)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the physical inactivity,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It helps unschooling flourish to draw kids away rather than pulling  <br/>
them. The more you pull, the more likely they are to cling. (Goes for  <br/>
adults too!)<br/>
<br/>
Work with the kids on a schedule that has a variety of things that  <br/>
get some or all of them out of the house for something better than  <br/>
video games.<br/>
<br/>
Get together an ultimate frisbee team and advertise it on local  <br/>
homeschooling groups. LARP (live action role playing) should appeal  <br/>
to gamers :-) Rock climbing (a fair number of new sports facilities  <br/>
are installing &quot;rock&quot; walls for climbing if you&#39;re not near real ones.)<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the apparent obsession, etc,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Obsession is a yucky word for engagement. When someone doesn&#39;t  <br/>
appreciate an activity as much as another it&#39;s deemed an obsession.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; & wanting them<br/>
&gt; to do more &#39;organic&#39; things like play outside, create, draw, play<br/>
&gt; music, read?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do *you* want your husband hovering over you -- and obsessing? --  <br/>
wanting you to do something other than what engages you? Wouldn&#39;t if  <br/>
feel rather creepy?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
==========<br/>
TV and radiation:<br/>
<br/>
This is from the FDA:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply">  &gt; Is the TV Radiation a Hazard?<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Scientists have not identified specific health effects resulting<br/>
 &gt; from exposure to extremely low doses of low-level radiation over<br/>
 &gt; prolonged periods of time. However, the current assumption is that<br/>
 &gt; there is no threshold of exposure below which x-radiation may not<br/>
 &gt; adversely effect human health. It is advisable, therefore, that x-<br/>
 &gt; radiation from TV sets, as well as other commonly used electronic<br/>
 &gt; products, be kept as low as reasonably achievable. It was for this<br/>
 &gt; purpose that Congress enacted the Radiation Control for Health and<br/>
 &gt; Safety Act of 1968 (currently called Federal Food, Drug, and<br/>
 &gt; Cosmetic Act – Subchapter C – Electronic Product Radiation Control).<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; It should be emphasized that most TV sets have not been found to<br/>
 &gt; give off any measurable level of radiation, and there is no<br/>
 &gt; evidence that radiation from TV sets has resulted in human injury.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Setting a Radiation Safety Standard<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the responsibility for<br/>
 &gt; carrying out an electronic product radiation control program<br/>
 &gt; mandated by the Electronic Product Radiation Control provisions of<br/>
 &gt; the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act. Through it&#39;s Center for Devices and<br/>
 &gt; Radiological Health, FDA sets and enforces standards of performance<br/>
 &gt; for electronic products to assure that radiation emissions do not<br/>
 &gt; pose a hazard to public health.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; A Federal standard limiting x-ray emissions from TV receivers to<br/>
 &gt; 0.5 milliroentgen per hour (mR/hr) was issued on December 25, 1969.<br/>
 &gt; The standard is applicable to all TV sets manufactured after<br/>
 &gt; January 15, 1970. The overall effect of the standard is to require<br/>
 &gt; that TV receivers must not emit x-radiation above the 0.5 mR/hr<br/>
 &gt; level when tested under adverse operating conditions. Test<br/>
 &gt; conditions do not represent normal use and ensure that when used<br/>
 &gt; under normal conditions, TV sets do not pose a radiation hazard.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Assuring That TV Sets Meet the Radiation Standard<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Manufacturers of television receivers and computer monitors contain<br/>
 &gt; CRTs must certify that their products meets performance standard<br/>
 &gt; under Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part<br/>
 &gt; 1020.10. All TV manufacturers must submit written radiation safety<br/>
 &gt; reports to FDA outlining how they assure that each set coming off<br/>
 &gt; the assembly line complies with the Federal x-ray radiation limit.<br/>
 &gt; These reports contain a description of the manufacturer’s quality<br/>
 &gt; control and testing program and the television radiation safety<br/>
 &gt; design. Manufacturers also must maintain records of test data and<br/>
 &gt; prepare an annual report to FDA summarizing these records. The FDA<br/>
 &gt; has the authority to ask for radiation safety data including<br/>
 &gt; results of x-ray leakage from selected sets to determine compliance<br/>
 &gt; with the standard.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; Television receivers imported into the United States, which do not<br/>
 &gt; meet the standard are not allowed into the country and are<br/>
 &gt; destroyed if not exported in 90 days. Importers, however, may<br/>
 &gt; petition FDA for permission to correct the violations.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; How Safe Are TV Sets Today?<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; X-radiation emissions from properly operated TV sets and computer<br/>
 &gt; monitors containing CRTs are well controlled and do not present a<br/>
 &gt; public health hazard. The FDA standard, and today’s technology,<br/>
 &gt; such as electronic hold-down safety circuits and regulated power<br/>
 &gt; supplies, have effectively eliminated the risk of x-radiation from<br/>
 &gt; these products. FDA has not found TVs that violate the standard<br/>
 &gt; under normal (home) use conditions.<br/>
 &gt;<br/>
 &gt; It is important to note also that flat panel TVs incorporating<br/>
 &gt; Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) or Plasma displays are not capable of<br/>
 &gt; emitting x-radiation. As such these products and are not subject to<br/>
 &gt; the FDA standard and do not pose a public health hazard.<br/>

<br/>
Sure, LOTS of people do!  They&#39;re people who want to limit and  <br/>
control other people.<br/>
<br/>
I like to empower and free other people, so I don&#39;t think of it as  <br/>
&quot;addiction.&quot;  There are people who read books incessantly and  <br/>
habitually.  The other day I saw somene&#39;s online profile bio and it  <br/>
said &quot;I&#39;m a reader.&quot;   I used to read much more than I do now.  It  <br/>
was escapism and sometimes snobbery.  My life changed and now I would  <br/>
much rather interact with my kids or my husband  or my friends than  <br/>
to read.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=- Is there any room for &quot;self-discipline&quot; as such?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Yes.  You could discipline yourself to keep your face soft and sweet  <br/>
when dealing with your kid about things they understand better than  <br/>
you do.  You could spend more time reading about the advantages and  <br/>
benefits of allowing them freedom and leeway, and about the things to  <br/>
be learned from game playing.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t like the phrase &quot;self-discipline,&quot; and I don&#39;t like &quot;self- <br/>
regulation.&quot;  They&#39;re both about saying no, about having rules,  <br/>
instead of about finding yes and making real choices in each moment.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I suppose some people could be addicted to video games just like <br/>
others are addicted to gambling or shopping.  Those things are not <br/>
inherently addictive, but some people might be prone to addictive <br/>
behavior.  Restricting one type of activity for fear it can be <br/>
addictive is senseless because a person prone to addictive behavior <br/>
will simply find another addiction.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Repeat that thought but put different activities in the place of <br/>
RPGs.  What if your child read books, worked on puzzles, watch <br/>
television, walked outside, worked in the garden, etc. many hours of <br/>
the day and night?  Would you feel equally concerned about how they <br/>
spend their time?  Or do you put more value on some activities than <br/>
others?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;re admitting all of you like to stay up late.  What do you do <br/>
with your time with the kid(s) play video games?  Again, are you <br/>
placing more value on some activities over others?  What would you <br/>
like to see your children doing instead of playing the video games?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; However, I have seen grown men (25yo+) &#39;neglect&#39; their families to<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>That is not the fault of the video games themselves.  That is <br/>
something going on inside the person&#39;s mind, and if video games <br/>
aren&#39;t around, he would likely find another activity.  I&#39;ve heard of <br/>
men spending hours on the golf course, boating on the lake, working <br/>
in the yard, etc.  Would you consider those things to be addictive as <br/>
well?  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; why does it seem some people don&#39;t &#39;grow out of it?&#39; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So video games are only for children?  They are a pleasant way to <br/>
spend time.  I myself spend hours playing an online game, but I&#39;m not <br/>
addicted and/or neglecting my family.  I don&#39;t feel there is anything <br/>
else adult I should be doing.  <br/>
<br/>
I can also talk about my husband who spends hours working on his <br/>
online Diplomacy games.  Both his gaming interests and mine are <br/>
actually quite brain challenging.  They aren&#39;t mindless, worthless <br/>
activities.  We enjoy the problem solving as well as the social <br/>
interaction of playing the games with other people.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I did my share of fighting over game time (5 of us) but mostly <br/>
&gt; decided it was sort of a waste of time & read books or did crafts<br/>
&gt; instead.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Ah.  There&#39;s the answer.  You place no value on the activity because <br/>
you don&#39;t care for the activity personally.  Therefore, how can <br/>
anyone else place a high value on these activities?<br/>
 <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How about I have 5 kids & the stress & arguing & crying (esp my 5yo<br/>
&gt; DS) they do over playing games & not being able to play (the older<br/>
&gt; kids dominating the computers) - even when I allow them &#39;free reign&#39;<br/>
&gt; the older ones will not usually &#39;take turns?&#39; - <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>There isn&#39;t enough to go around then.  It&#39;s like offering a plate of <br/>
4 cookies to a dozen children and expecting them to share.  What if <br/>
you only had one bicycle for them to ride?  <br/>
<br/>
My children don&#39;t fight over computer time because everyone has their <br/>
own computer.  No one feels shorted or left out.  The computers are <br/>
just another thing to do along with all the other stuff they have to <br/>
do.  They know it&#39;s there when they want it so they don&#39;t feel a need <br/>
to gorge themselves on it in fear that it will be taken away soon.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I, also, get frustrated when chores go undone & calls for them go <br/>
&gt; unheeded due to the extreme wrapping up in the game<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>No one in my family has chores, not even me.  We all do what we can <br/>
to help when we&#39;re able to do so.  I would get very upset if my <br/>
husband told me to stop playing my game in the middle of something <br/>
big happening to tell me to do laundry.  He feels the same way when <br/>
he&#39;s involved in something.  And again, the activity doesn&#39;t matter.  <br/>
It can be gaming, gardening, reading, or whatever.  All activities <br/>
have value to the person doing them voluntarily, whether you feel the <br/>
same way or not.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; so, I suppose I&#39;m struggling between the constant, untiring gaming<br/>
&gt; (is this more pronounced because I&#39;m sometimes adamant against<br/>
&gt; playing so freakin&#39; much!), the lack of rest, the radiation from<br/>
&gt; the computer & monitor, the physical inactivity, the apparent<br/>
&gt; obsession, etc, & wanting them to do more &#39;organic&#39; things like<br/>
&gt; play outside, create, draw, play music, read?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You also said you were too busy to justify your time spent playing <br/>
the video games.  I&#39;m guessing you personally don&#39;t like the games <br/>
and want to see your children doing things you yourself would like to <br/>
do.  BTW, there is no physical activity in reading, drawing or even <br/>
playing music (like piano or violin).  If they spent hours doing <br/>
those things and sitting in one place, would you feel better?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1816172919">-=-- I have a 14yo who never &#39;said&#39; she wanted<br/>

I&#39;m glad you gave us so much background if you want help.<br/>
<br/>
You might not be glad you gave us so much background if you don&#39;t  <br/>
really want help. :-)<br/>
<br/>
You said you&#39;re a &quot;resolute&quot; unschooler and that you call school &quot;the  <br/>
&#39;public fool system.&#39;&quot;  So I&#39;m guessing that your children didn&#39;t  <br/>
choose to be home, but that you&#39;ve made the decision for them.   One  <br/>
of the worst things about school is that children don&#39;t choose to be  <br/>
there, the decision is made for them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m guessing if your daughter shows discontent and resentment, that  <br/>
it could be because of the negativity at home, the disapproval, and  <br/>
the chores.<br/>
<br/>
If a family defines school as the devil (in any way), then it will be  <br/>
easy for them to be complacent and figure that anything they do at  <br/>
home is better than the evil school.    That&#39;s one problem.  The  <br/>
other is that if for ANY reason the kids end up in school, they&#39;ll  <br/>
start off scared to death, and if they discover they kinda like it,  <br/>
their faith in the parents&#39; opinions goes down.  If they don&#39;t trust  <br/>
your opinion about one thing, they&#39;ll be less likely to accept your  <br/>
opinion about another thing.  So, for example, if you tell them the  <br/>
radiation from a computer screen will harm them, and they see you  <br/>
sitting in front of a computer, being &quot;old&quot; (to them) and alive, and  <br/>
they know even older people who work with computers at work and  <br/>
aren&#39;t dead, will they believe your advice about sexually transmitted  <br/>
diseases or pregnancy?   Clarity, honesty and humility go a long,  <br/>
long way toward creating a relationship of trust between a parent and  <br/>
child.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-I had one friend tell me that because my husband & I were so  <br/>
&#39;smart that she knew all of our children would be geniuses even if we  <br/>
never taught them a lesson -=-<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no denying a genetic component, but there are different kinds  <br/>
of smart.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/intelligences">http://sandradodd.com/intelligences</a><br/>
<br/>
Last night I watched &quot;Smart People,&quot; and it reminded me of many  <br/>
people around me who were certified &quot;smart&quot; by school and tests and  <br/>
paychecks, but who are quite lacking in everyday awareness, and  <br/>
compassion, and humility.  If one gets a 99th percentile on a test,  <br/>
it&#39;s easy to feel there&#39;s nothing left to learn.   The more evidence  <br/>
people have that they&#39;re intellectually superior, the less likely  <br/>
they are, sometimes, to be open to the idea that they might be  <br/>
blithely screwing up their own lives and others&#39;.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1072521998">Here are some ideas for helping kids share the computer.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/sharing">http://sandradodd.com/sharing</a><br/>
<br/>
My sister said (with vitriol) one day years ago that she would NEVER  <br/>
buy a video game system, because when her kids visited where one was,  <br/>
they would fight over it.<br/>
<br/>
I just calmly asked her if she&#39;d rather buy them something that  <br/>
wasn&#39;t worth fighting over.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are jostling for a turn, it must be REALLY good.  Could  <br/>
you get another system or computer?<br/>
<br/>
Someone suggested taking the kids out to do frisbee golf or  <br/>
something.  I&#39;d like to amend the suggestion to taking SOME of the  <br/>
kids out, so those at home (or one at home) could play in peace and  <br/>
quiet, and later take that kid or those kids out to do something  <br/>
while the others can have more peace.<br/>
<br/>
Kids can feel crowded, and the more negativity there is in the air,  <br/>
the less able they will be to find peaceful solutions.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, I have seen grown men (25yo+) &#39;neglect&#39; their families to<br/>
play video games - although some do sit with their children while<br/>
playing - my concern is - why does it seem some people don&#39;t &#39;grow out<br/>
of it?&#39; -=-<br/>
<br/>
What other things are you thinking people should &quot;grow out of&quot;?  <br/>
You&#39;re classifying video games as a kid thing.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How about I have 5 kids & the stress & arguing & crying (esp my  <br/>
5yo DS) they do over playing games & not being able to play (the  <br/>
olderkids dominating the computers) - even when I allow them &#39;free  <br/>
reign&#39; the older ones will not usually &#39;take turns?&#39;  -=-<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;free rein&quot; isn&#39;t the norm, then a horse will likely take off to  <br/>
places he&#39;s never been able to see or go.  If he&#39;s been able to  <br/>
explore and sniff and taste and find his own shade, &quot;free rein&quot; won&#39;t  <br/>
be so extreme.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
There are ideas at that link above, though.<br/>

<br/>
A very slight shift of terminology will help you.  If you change  <br/>
&quot;taught himself to read&quot; to &quot;learned to read,&quot; it will help you see  <br/>
more learning all around you.<br/>

actually CAN read & just has to relax & let it happen -=-<br/>
<br/>
Telling her she can read when she feels she can&#39;t isn&#39;t as respectful  <br/>
and supportive as saying &quot;You will be reading before long; don&#39;t  <br/>
worry.&quot;  If you say you CAN read, you&#39;re telling her she&#39;s wrong  <br/>
about what she believes (and if she can&#39;t read, she knows she&#39;s  <br/>
seeing words that don&#39;t look like words to her--just letters), and if  <br/>
you say she has to relax, you&#39;re blaming her for not reading.   You  <br/>
don&#39;t even have to change your location or position to make this  <br/>
change, just a little attitude change.  Just relax and let it happen.  <br/>

Rein, not reign.  I find the phrase interesting, because people using  <br/>
it mean that, if you allow a horse to &quot;have the reins,&quot; it will take  <br/>
control and run away; that, if you want to maintain control, you have  <br/>
to hang on tight.  This isn&#39;t true; lengthening the reins is a reward,  <br/>
allowing the horse to stretch and relax after working.  It&#39;s such an  <br/>
important part of exercising a horse correctly that it&#39;s incorporated  <br/>
into dressage tests as the &quot;free walk,&quot; giving the horse a brief  <br/>
respite partway through the otherwise collected (&quot;tight&quot; rein) work.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So - it is hard for you to comprehend the value of videogames, I  <br/>
suppose. My suggestion to you is that you immerse yourself in learning  <br/>
about the benefits of video games, for a while. This is something your  <br/>
kids love - you owe it to them to give it the benefit of the doubt and  <br/>
educate yourself to avoid acting on baseless prejudice.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had years and years of  crafty stuff going on in our house - I  <br/>
mean intense craftiness!<br/>
<br/>
I honestly cannot say that I see all that craftiness as having been  <br/>
intrinsically more valuable in my children&#39;s lives than video game  <br/>
playing.<br/>
<br/>
I have one kid who did not engage in the crafts much - didn&#39;t enjoy  <br/>
it, mostly got frustrated by it. Not for her. She played Neopets very  <br/>
intensely for years - she was one of the very first people on Neopets.  <br/>
She also plays the SIMS like crazy - still does that.  Not doing  <br/>
crafts has not held back her intellectual development. She&#39;s 20 now,  <br/>
and a full-time college student, planning on getting a PhD.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter was/is extremely crafty. (Please go and look at her  <br/>
&quot;Beautiful Useables&quot; site at &lt;royaboya.etsy.com&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
She doesn&#39;t play video games almost at all and it is hard for her to  <br/>
really feel within herself that video game playing isn&#39;t time wasting.  <br/>
She doesn&#39;t really &quot;get&quot; her boyfriend&#39;s passion for video games and  <br/>
how much he loves to immerse himself in them, particularly when he  <br/>
gets a new game. She&#39;s had the experience of growing up with her  <br/>
sisters who do play video games, and she&#39;s people-smart and she  <br/>
reminds herself - different strokes for different folks (although  <br/>
probably not in those 1960&#39;s words &lt;G&gt;). So she supports his interest  <br/>
with good cheer and happily spends her time crocheting or painting,  <br/>
etc., while he&#39;s playing his game. I was at their house a couple of  <br/>
days ago and she asked him to play a game of LOOT with us.   We  <br/>
chatted while he got to a good stopping point in his game and then he  <br/>
came and helped us figure out the rules, we played a game of LOOT, and  <br/>
then he went back to his new videogame (he&#39;d just gotten it that  <br/>
morning). He did it cheerfully and she was cheerful and it was GREAT  <br/>
to see. I could easily imagine an alternative - her whining at him,  <br/>
&quot;My MOTHER is here and you&#39;re so rude you&#39;re not even getting off that  <br/>
stupid computer.&quot; Him: &quot;Why does she think she can just stop by and  <br/>
interrupt my life?&quot; Her: What life? You&#39;re just playing videogames.  <br/>
Him: I suppose you think I ought to be knitting, like you? Her: Well,  <br/>
at least I have something to show for my time.<br/>
<br/>
And on and on.....<br/>
<br/>
Ugly scenario - but probably very common type of situation, especially  <br/>
between parents and kids. Not conducive to happy and harmonious family  <br/>
life.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I&#39;d like to ditto that.  What I see in my own house is that my younger<br/>
kid, 7, really wants to do whatever my older kid, 14, is doing.  It has<br/>
less to do with the activity at hand and more to do with seeing that<br/>
something might be interesting and wanting to explore it.  While, I do<br/>
understand that my younger kid wants and likes to do computer stuff and<br/>
video game stuff, the draw isn&#39;t nearly the same as it is for my older<br/>
kid.  The older&#39;s need for that is far far greater.<br/>
<br/>
At the age of 7, she is really more willing to try a variety of things,<br/>
so taking her to the park is a great option, while leaving my older one<br/>
at home to do her thing without interuption.  I feel a sense of duty to<br/>
protect each of them from each other.  I want the time they DO spend<br/>
together to be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of related but not, the other day both my girls were playing Gaia<br/>
and Margaux, 7, was following her sister&#39;s avatar around everywhere. <br/>
Chamille was being gracious about it, even though she was clearly trying<br/>
to chat with people.  Margaux never does anything halfway, and<br/>
eventually she was trying to join the conversations too.  She started<br/>
doing the repetetive words or numbers or letters thing.  Some of<br/>
Chamille&#39;s friends were getting mad about it, even though Chamille had<br/>
told them all that Margaux was a little kid and couldn&#39;t read or spell<br/>
stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Finally Chamille gets all annoyed and says very loudly &quot;Margaux stop!&quot;. <br/>
I was listening in to all of this happening, just kind of seeing how it<br/>
would play out.  I looked at Chamille and said, &quot;Hey she&#39;s taking a page<br/>
out of your book.&quot;, since Chamille used to do that ALL the time on chat<br/>
forums, just to irritate certain people.  She started laughing and<br/>
laughing, so hard she was rolling on the floor.  Then we talked to<br/>
Margaux about netiquette and how it&#39;s fun to an extent, but it does get<br/>
old and it can irritate people, people that Chamille would like to keep<br/>
as friends.  Then I told Margaux that Chamille would help her know and<br/>
navigate netiquette a little, and that if Chamille told her enough was<br/>
enough, that she really should listen.<br/>
<br/>
The point of the story is that both my kids have unlimited access to<br/>
play what they want, when they want.  Chamille is gracious about her<br/>
sister being online with her and Margaux is willing to cease being &quot;the<br/>
annoying little sister&quot; because she trusts her older sister and wants to<br/>
be in her good graces.  One thing that really really helped get them to<br/>
this point is for me to make sure that they aren&#39;t interfering with each<br/>
other in negative ways.  One way to do that is to take one of them and<br/>
do something individual while the other can have peace to do what they<br/>
need to do.</div>

Anyway, I really appreciate everyone&#39;s input!  I intend to answer or<br/>
clarify, if needed - I totally appreciate the time you took to read<br/>
and answer - you have certainly given me much to think about - it<br/>
seems like a soapbox subject lol - like homebirthing & not vaxing (2<br/>
of my soapboxes lol)<br/>
<br/>
Re-reading my letter I guess I &#39;see&#39; how I sound... I&#39;m really NOT so<br/>
controlling in &#39;real life.&#39; In fact, I&#39;ve been &#39;accused&#39; of not<br/>
controlling my kids - I have really been fighting for my kids&#39; freedom<br/>
for a long time - to let them learn on their own - I encourage them to<br/>
trust themselves (I guess everyone will jump on the apparent hypocrisy<br/>
about gaming :) - everyone is so &#39;concerned&#39; about their futures -<br/>
ergo the &#39;public school&#39;/curriculum stuff - although it&#39;s the big dead<br/>
elephant in the living room - just no-one trust their own choices &<br/>
heaven forbid you listen to a child!<br/>
<br/>
I have really gotten very little to no support for my choices - but<br/>
I&#39;m sure all of you have dealt with that - I&#39;ve been called crazy,<br/>
lazy, a bad mother, a terrible housekeeper, that I have no focus, that<br/>
I change my mind all the time, that I&#39;m not protecting my children<br/>
from the &#39;evil threat&#39; of the internet, that I shouldn&#39;t let my kids<br/>
eat whenever they want or let them cook on my &#39;dangerous&#39; gas stove if<br/>
they want (my sisters have described my kids as &#39;foraging&#39;), that I<br/>
don&#39;t have a life, etc all by family members incl husband, who tells<br/>
me I&#39;m not normal.  One of my sisters told a friend who commented on<br/>
how &#39;great&#39; a mother I was that &#39;really she&#39;s not.&#39; I aspire to be a<br/>
great mother, however.<br/>
<br/>
My goal is to provide a safe, creative haven for my children but I&#39;ve<br/>
really had to fight to get this far - which isn&#39;t far enough - I feel<br/>
one of my main goals is to help my children be independent and, I&#39;m<br/>
kinda glad that my children sometimes are rebellious as I admire &<br/>
wish to foster an independent spirit - I&#39;m not trying to be their<br/>
everything because that really screws them up in life - my DH&#39;s mom<br/>
was like the uber housekeeper AND cleaned up after my DH past teenagehood.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been told constantly that I need to provide &#39;structure&#39; in their<br/>
lives, including &#39;regular&#39; meal times, so forth.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I wish to create the most natural environment possible & I<br/>
feel that gaming & TV (which both consist of &#39;programming&#39;) are<br/>
designed to do a certain amount of programming - the brain reacts to<br/>
the pulses from the TV & it has a hypnotizing effect (so I&#39;ve read) to<br/>
the point of making the mind more malleable to suggestion & I&#39;m sure<br/>
most have heard of subliminal advertising/suggestion - I&#39;ve known of<br/>
people to get rid of TV & they report more peace in their homes -<br/>
However, I also know that the children in those families become<br/>
immediately engrossed once they see TV at anyone else&#39;s home, too - so<br/>
I&#39;m hard-pressed to believe that children really make those choices<br/>
if/when they&#39;re being hypnotized - (Although, my research on hypnotism<br/>
tells me that being hypnotized doesn&#39;t make you do things you weren&#39;t<br/>
so inclined to do, anyway.)  Now, I realize I could be wrong & I tend<br/>
to play devil&#39;s advocate & look at both sides/both points of view,<br/>
because I believe each side has valid points.<br/>
  <br/>
I didn&#39;t take the time to read the linx on video gaming - but when I<br/>
did research earlier I couldn&#39;t find anything definitive.  So, I look<br/>
forward to reading something substantive.<br/>
<br/>
Thanx again,<br/>

Don&#39;t let a word get between you and your direct perceptions.  Try to  <br/>

If you believe &quot;both sides&quot; (what, of EVERything?) are equally valid,  <br/>
though, on what basis will you make decisions?  Once you decide what  <br/>
your goal is, you&#39;ll have a way to evaluate and interpret what you  <br/>
read in light of how close it gets you to your goal.<br/>

&quot;Definitive&quot; and &quot;substantive&quot; might not be as good right now as  <br/>
persuasive and comforting.  Do you want to know what will help your  <br/>
children learn?  Most of what&#39;s written is anti-video gaming designed  <br/>
by professional educators who resent anything more interesting than  <br/>
school.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I, quite honestly, have NEVER been on the receiving end of any  <br/>
negative comments by friends or family.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not because I hide what we&#39;re doing. That&#39;s not because there  <br/>
aren&#39;t people who probably think we&#39;re more than a little nuts.<br/>
<br/>
One time another woman described to me how her husband critiqued her  <br/>
cooking pretty much every night. She put a full dinner on the table at  <br/>
6 pm every night. He walked in the door from work, on schedule, sat  <br/>
down to eat. At the end of dinner he&#39;d say things like, &quot;I&#39;d rather  <br/>
not have that again, it wasn&#39;t that good.&quot; Sometimes he&#39;d say, &quot;Next  <br/>
time, use less cheese.&quot; &quot;Needs more salt.&quot; Stuff like that. Then he&#39;d  <br/>
get up, go to their bedroom room and watch tv while she cleaned up and  <br/>
took care of the children.<br/>
<br/>
We were sitting at my dining room table while she told me this. I was  <br/>
dumbfounded. She asked me what I did when my husband criticized my  <br/>
cooking. I sputtered - &quot;Umm, well, gee, he wouldn&#39;t DARE because, if  <br/>
he did that to me, I&#39;d stop cooking.&quot; Which isn&#39;t to say I never cook  <br/>
anything that turns out bad. I am kind of an experimental cook and  <br/>
sometimes my experiments are pretty awful. When that happens, we all  <br/>
eat a bit, and I&#39;ll usually say, &quot;Okay, okay - I won&#39;t be repeating  <br/>
this one. Anybody want me to stick some frozen pizza in the oven?&quot; We  <br/>
laugh. It is all okay. Truth is, my husband almost always thanks me  <br/>
and says something nice about the food whenever I cook for him - so do  <br/>
the kids, usually. I can tell how much they like something by whether  <br/>
they say, &quot;We should have this again.&quot; And, I thank my husband when he  <br/>
cooks, too!<br/>
<br/>
So - how is that related to nobody criticizing my parenting choices? I  <br/>
am not open to it. I talk very matter-of-factly about our different  <br/>
parenting styles and choices when I&#39;m with one of my sisters, who is  <br/>
very conventional. She&#39;s a really good mom in the conventional sense -  <br/>
loves her kids, shows it, supports them. I don&#39;t ever argue with her -  <br/>
I show total respect for her choices and make it clear that I&#39;m  <br/>
absolutely not interested in critiquing her parenting. But, with a  <br/>
twinkle in my eyes, I respond to her mention of chore charts with,  <br/>
&quot;Well, you know how I am - no chore charts in our house.&quot; I sort of  <br/>
let the other person know that I know that they think we&#39;re kind of  <br/>
bizarre and that I&#39;m okay with them thinking that. It really and truly  <br/>
does not bother me at all.<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s the key to why we never get into any kind of debate -  <br/>
I&#39;m not trying to convince them that unschooling is a good idea. I  <br/>
don&#39;t care what they think. I don&#39;t want to argue, so if something  <br/>
sounds like it could be interpreted as a criticism, I choose to  <br/>
understand it as just a comment made without malice and I respond with  <br/>
something lighthearted or maybe even a bit of pointed humor.<br/>
<br/>
But, I&#39;m guessing, people also know that if they were openly and  <br/>
rudely critical, I&#39;d be able to defend myself quite strongly, so they  <br/>
avoid it by keeping their negative thoughts to themselves, which is  <br/>
fine with me. My sister and I love each other and each other&#39;s kids.  <br/>
We both take a sort of slightly-amused-at-the-differences perspective.  <br/>
And we&#39;re both happy that all of our kids have grown up to be very  <br/>
cool young adults.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-425300399">-----snip------<br/>
Here&#39;s the question:<br/>
<br/>
Does anyone think that there is a problem with &quot;addiction&quot; to these<br/>
games? <br/>
-------------<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t. I don&#39;t think there is a problem with &quot;addiction&quot; to these games. We had 3 WoW accounts 2 weeks ago, I decided to let go of mine as I didn&#39;t play very much but kept Simon&#39;s and Linnaea&#39;s account going. I probably enjoy playing more than Simon does, but he has a friend for whom WoW is the bees knees. When he comes over it is what he most wants to do. So, with that in mind, I figured I could help Simon get his characters up to higher levels so that he would enjoy playing with his friend more. None of us are addicted. Linnaea plays the most. But she didn&#39;t for a while. She asked me to help her get her main character up a few levels and since she got a riding pet she&#39;s enjoyed playing a lot more. <br/>
<br/>
The on-line Meriam Webster dictionary defines addiction as: compulsive<br/>
need for and use of a habit-forming substance (as heroin, nicotine, or<br/>
alcohol) characterized by tolerance and by well-defined physiological<br/>
symptoms upon withdrawal; broadly : persistent compulsive use of a substance known by the user to be harmful<br/>
<br/>
By arguing that video games are addictive you are saying that they produce a complusion. In a household without limits and with 6 game systems no one here has a compulsion to play them. I enjoy some, Simon enjoys some, David enjoys some, Linnaea enjoys some, but none of us are out of control when it comes to video games. <br/>
<br/>
The second point that you have to be arguing is that they are known to be harmful. I have no such evidence. They can produce excitement and imaginative play and conversations and intense focus when in the middle of a serious problem. I think video games are so incredibly intellectually stimulating that I can completely understand the frustration of not solving the puzzle. It is much like a really good debate or an argument or having new ideas that challange all of your old standbys. <br/>
<br/>
-------snip-----------<br/>
 Is there any room for &quot;self-discipline&quot; as such?<br/>
------------------<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know what that means. Really. Is it a lonely dominatrix? <br/>
<br/>
Self-discipline must come from yourself, right, and discipline seems to suggest that you would be out of control if you weren&#39;t disciplined. I would let go of the word self-discipline. Personal choice is a much nicer way to look at it. And there is always room for personal choice. <br/>
<br/>
-----snip-----------<br/>
 - I&#39;ve read several posts today concerning kids<br/>
who &quot;want&quot; to go to school - I have a 14yo who never &#39;said&#39; she wanted<br/>
to go to school but shows discontent & resentment - I think partly<br/>
from watching things like &quot;High School Musical&quot; & all of the teen<br/>
shows centered on school like &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot; & &quot;Zoe 101&quot;<br/>
----------<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know Zoe 101, maybe it hasn&#39;t made it to the UK yet, but That&#39;s So Raven I know quite well. It isn&#39;t school focused at all. And, actually, while High School Musical takes place in a school it is largely about social interactions. It&#39;s very similar to Grease, a show that is so not about school, even if it is set in a school. If there is discontent coming from those sorts of shows I imagine that they are being fueled by a life that is yearning for social relationships, boyfriends. I loved the show Sooner or Later with Rex Smith. I even watched Solid Gold to see more of Rex Smith. It didn&#39;t make me like school more, it didn&#39;t make me want to take guitar lessons or pretend that I was older than I was, it just made me want Rex Smith. Sigh...<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
------snip----<br/>
 PLUS I&#39;ve<br/>
had &#39;well-meaning&#39; friends and family (even DH) expressing concern<br/>
about their long-term future (like how will they get work) & &#39;being<br/>
socialized&#39; (to which I reply I&#39;m not interested in my children become<br/>
socialists or programmed to be worker-bees then I tell them my<br/>
children are very sociable :) <br/>
---------------<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s kind of rude, isn&#39;t it? Particularly to your husband. They are legitimate concerns, and concerns that parents have whether their children are in school or not. Dismissing them in such a huge sweeping way isn&#39;t going to help them to understand why you are choosing this route. It is more likely to get them talking to your daughter in private conversations. Not that you need to pander to them, but if they are truly concerned, and, particularly, if your husband, the father of these children, is concerned, it is absolutely worth taking the time to talk to them. <br/>
<br/>
------snip-----------<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m a resolute unschooler<br/>
-----------------<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling is about trusting that learning happens outside of the structure of school. Yes, it is about not schooling, but it is more than that. It is about seeing learning everywhere. It is about recognizing the learning that occurs in a conversation about which word for peeing you prefer when at the gas station (I like urinate or slash) and the learning that occurs while watching the That&#39;s So Raven episode where she meets the other students with psychic power and discovers that being with &quot;her own kind&quot; wasn&#39;t the be all end all. Letting go of school is the first step, and it&#39;s a doozy, but the next steps are about learning how wide you have to spread your arms to get at all the learning that is possible while paying attention to the learning that is going on in the lives in your family. It is incredible to watch the constance of it. Even when it looks like nothing is going on.... It&#39;s like growth spurts, sleeping more, clumsiness, maybe, eating<br/>
 more, more down time and suddenly a huge bit of information synthesized. It isn&#39;t about being anti-school, it is about being pro-learning in all it&#39;s guises. <br/>
<br/>
----------snip--------<br/>
 - lol - I do realize that some people are<br/>
uncomfortable with no &#39;real&#39; schooling even though these very same<br/>
people will complain or state how they have to be very involved in<br/>
schooling & set some teachers straight & the bad habits their kids<br/>
pick up & one hires tutors for their &#39;dyslexic&#39; only child whom they<br/>
put through expensive programs & kept in summer camps all this past<br/>
summer (at least 3 camps) - maybe even jealous that I don&#39;t feel the<br/>
need to kowtow to society&#39;s pressure or are so insecure in themselves<br/>
&/or their children that they leave teaching up to the &#39;experts&#39; -<br/>
like I tell them & my children - if public schooling is so great -<br/>
where are all the inventors/geniuses & why are children learning less<br/>
now than ever - why do kids from Asia & India come here not even<br/>
knowing English & within 2 years or so, become the valedictorian of<br/>
the graduating class - why do kids graduate h.s. illiterate - why is<br/>
there such a variance in achievement - top of the class to barely<br/>
passing?  so I call it the &#39;public fool system.&#39;<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a lot of vitrol. I don&#39;t think children are learning less now than ever. In the UK school-children are testing at higher and higher levels. I kowtow to much of society&#39;s pressures, tending only to balk the schooling thing, and actually that isn&#39;t one of society&#39;s pressures. Educating at home is a perfectly valid choice in the society I live in. I&#39;ve informed David, when he was interested in applying for a job in Groningen that The Netherlands isn&#39;t home-ed friendly. He contacted a couple of people who knew more than I did about home-education in The Netherlands and decided that it was a deal breaker, so he didn&#39;t apply. I do think that not using a school structure is outside of the norm. But, everywhere that we&#39;ve lived while home-educating has given me the right to educate my children at home. In the UK there is even precedent in the courts for unschooling, or autonomously educating as it is called here. <br/>
<br/>
There are lots of inventors. Lots and lots of inventors. I can&#39;t even begin. Video games and the leaps and bounds those have made, have you seen a movie from Pixar? The amazing technological advancements in animation and in programming. Look at special effects...  Heart valves. Flexible solar panels. Facebook. David is on a list for Mazda Bongo owners. Mazda Bongos don&#39;t have very good temperature gauges. When we were in Australia he noticed an alarm for cars as they reached nearly over-heating and mentioned it on the list. One of the other guys on the list got in touch with an Australian company and got them to design an alarm for the Mazda Bongo. A new invention. Or at least a new modification of an already existing device.I noticed in a Scientific American an article on a kinetic power source from walking being used to power mobile devices: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=powering-cell-phone-battery.">http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=powering-cell-phone-battery.</a> Do a google search for the TED talks. Look at<br/>
 the recent Nobel Prize winners. I&#39;ve got Oliver Smithies (who reminds me of Ed Wynn) talking in the background while I write. <br/>
<br/>
What you are writing isn&#39;t true. There are inventors, there are geniuses, there are non-Asian valedictorians. And yes there is a huge range of ability within schools. There are failures and there are successes within a system that is defining itself on grades. And that is a huge problem with schools and with those who leave schools. The variance has more to do with the fact that schools are working to fit all children into a small box of understanding how learning happens and what smart means. I watch a show called QI quite regularly. It&#39;s a game show hosted by Stephen Fry that is about Quite Interesting (QI) facts and which examines the &quot;facts&quot; that everyone knows are true, but that aren&#39;t actually true. The other night the question was what was invented in Cambridge in 1792. The answer was examinations: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/commentandanalysis/3612018.Scrap_exams_and_get_on_with_teaching/">http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/commentandanalysis/3612018.Scrap_exams_and_get_on_with_teaching/</a> is an article that mentions that. The author of that<br/>
 article states that examinations have been around in China for at least 4000 years. So, QI got it wrong. Assessment is an important tool when you are trying to order individuals. It doesn&#39;t align itself with unschooling. Nor is it meaningful when all individuals aren&#39;t heading for the same place. In 1792 Cambridge I imagine there were fairly few students. I find the number 150 freshmen in 1800. So not a lot of students being assessed for the jobs of research at universities. And probably being an upperclass twit, or an educated member of the royal family. In 2008 the number of people being assessed as able to fill academic niches is too great for the number of academic niches available. <br/>
<br/>
------snip--------<br/>
<br/>
How about I have 5 kids & the stress & arguing & crying (esp my 5yo<br/>
DS) they do over playing games & not being able to play (the older<br/>
kids dominating the computers) - even when I allow them &#39;free reign&#39;<br/>
the older ones will not usually &#39;take turns?&#39; - all of my children<br/>
have pretty much unlimited access to the internet - but I, also, get<br/>
frustrated when chores go undone & calls for them go unheeded due to<br/>
the extreme wrapping up in the game (Maple Story, currently - but<br/>
there was Runescape & Neopets & Gaia & Tektek) They are, also, pretty<br/>
wrapped up in youtube & myspace (14yo)  BTW - now 3 (14yo DD, 11yo DS<br/>
8yo DD) of my kids have their own computer set up - only my 5yo DS &<br/>
2yo DD don&#39;t - but my 5yo wants to play all the time too<br/>
-------------------<br/>
<br/>
When someone wants something someone else is using in our house I tend to work to engage the person who is waiting. Finding other engagement is easy, there are lots of things to do in or out of the house. Depending on the weather and the waiter there are lots of ways to become engaged. If things are getting stressful or into arguing I try to be as present as possible. I sit and help and listen and offer options and listen and wait and hold and be. My presence makes a big difference to the outcome of their rising tension. The hardest thing is for the waiter to walk away from the wait. At least in my experience. But my life is such that I can sit and be and wait and help as needed, as wanted. I also try and be aware of other things that my be leading up to this eruption of tension. Hunger, thirst, or tiredness and I try and make sure that those issues are taken care of often. Maslow&#39;s hierarchy of needs<br/>
 (<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs)</a> flashes through my head when I am trying to help. <br/>
<br/>
---------snip-----------<br/>
Is there no concern about them playing & interacting together & all of<br/>
us as a family?<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------<br/>
I almost never see my brother. The last time was 3 years ago. I haven&#39;t talked to him in a year maybe. There isn&#39;t any meanness or avoidance, really, in it. But there is also no connection. I know he reads my blog and I think of him often and e-mail him occassionally. We played and interacted as children and we fought and he&#39;s 5 years older than I am and we&#39;ve gone down very different paths. My children are much closer than Sam and I were. But I have no expectation that they will get along at any given moment. The other day Linnaea was spitting at Simon, sort of playfully, and he said &quot;You know, when I grow up I may not talk to you ever. I&#39;m gonna get caller id.&quot; which made me laugh. But he is right. Their relationship, their family time is about now. And if their individual childhoods are good, if their individual selves are happy and sated and peaceful much of the time they will be more generous and more kind to each other. And maybe that will extend<br/>
 beyond their time within my household. <br/>
<br/>
--------snip----------<br/>
 - I know some will say - play with them<br/>
---------------------<br/>
<br/>
Absolutely, play with them, watch with them, dance the dances they find on youtube with them. Without that what are you doing? Playing with them is key. Really key. <br/>
<br/>
------------snip------------<br/>
 I have so much to do that it&#39;s hard for<br/>
me to justify that <br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Justify what? Playing with your children? Enagaging with them where they are so that you can be fired up about what they are doing and learning and so that you can find new engaging things for them? That&#39;s really important stuff. There should be no need to justify that. <br/>
<br/>
--------snip-------------<br/>
so, I suppose<br/>
I&#39;m struggling between the constant, untiring gaming (is this more<br/>
pronounced because I&#39;m sometimes adamant against playing so freakin&#39;<br/>
much!), the lack of rest, the radiation from the computer & monitor,<br/>
the physical inactivity, the apparent obsession, etc, & wanting them<br/>
to do more &#39;organic&#39; things like play outside, create, draw, play<br/>
music, read? <br/>
--------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Jeez, what a lot of fear, and when you lay it out like that it must be really hard to see any value in their &quot;untiring gaming&quot;. You mentioned youtube, that&#39;s a lot of music to be playing, there is a lot of creation in games, and drawing, Art Rage is fantastic for drawing. Between Simon and Linnaea,  Simon is less likely to play outside, but when he does choose to, because it is a choice, he goes wholeheartedly. Forcing him to do something means that the something is unpleasant. Even if I think it is absolutely pleasant. Because it is his choice he will come up with things to do outside on his own. Things like going fishing or going to the beach to jump down the dunes. Linnaea plays outside a lot. She loves to talk on the phone while walking around the house. She likes to hike out across the fields with the cats following her to look at the horses down the way. They are different in what they enjoy. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, Linnaea really wants to play on WoW, so I&#39;m going to give her the computer. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-955797002">-=-My children are much closer...[b]ut I have no expectation that  <br/>
they will get along at any given moment. The other day Linnaea was  <br/>
spitting at Simon, sort of playfully, and he said &quot;You know, when I  <br/>
grow up I may not talk to you ever. I&#39;m gonna get caller id.&quot; which  <br/>
made me laugh. But he is right. Their relationship, their family time  <br/>
is about now. And if their individual childhoods are good, if their  <br/>
individual selves are happy and sated and peaceful much of the time  <br/>
they will be more generous and more kind to each other. And maybe  <br/>
that will extend<br/>
beyond their time within my household. -=-<br/>
<br/>
When Holly was seven or eight, she said &quot;Can I hit Marty?&quot; and I said  <br/>
&quot;When you&#39;re eighteen.&quot;  So for a long time there was commentary and  <br/>
reference to that.  She would say &quot;I can&#39;t wait until  my 18th  <br/>
birthday&quot; when Marty made her mad.  Usually she was joking.  But it  <br/>
was a way to express her frustration with him.  And sometimes he  <br/>
would do something he knew was irritating and say &quot;I&#39;m not coming to  <br/>
your 18th birthday party.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I figure when she turns 18, she will punch Marty on the arm and he&#39;ll  <br/>
take it well and laugh and say something funny.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For years Holly would say Kirby was mean and she hated Kirby, and  <br/>
Marty was her favorite brother.  But the last year Kirby was home,  <br/>
she started really liking him.  She was in Rhode Island visiting her  <br/>
friend Quinn when Kirby got the job offer in Austin and, over the  <br/>
course of a couple of days,  decided to take it.   When she found out  <br/>
he was moving out she cried.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s been to visit him twice in the past year--once Keith and she  <br/>
and I drove down there, and for my birthday in July what I asked for  <br/>
for my gift was two airfares.  One for Kirby to visit here, and one  <br/>
for Holly to go to Austin with him at the end of his visit to be  <br/>
there for a few days.<br/>
<br/>
It would be very easy for a 22 year old not to want his 16 year old  <br/>
sister there at his birthday, but Kirby was happy for  her to go home  <br/>
with him and visit.  They like each other.   I think it helped that I  <br/>
didn&#39;t try to &quot;make them&quot; like each other.  I tried to give them  <br/>
privacy and space and personal attention and understanding.   Of  <br/>
course I&#39;d get frustrated and tired of bickering sometimes, but  <br/>
because the goals of peace and harmony and self-expression were  <br/>
always prominent, I didn&#39;t belittle their feelings or deny them or  <br/>
try to get them to be false.  I&#39;d separate them and calm them and  <br/>
speak in terms of finding ways to let them be autonomous and  <br/>
separate, while still encouraging them to interact when they were  <br/>
happier, later.<br/>
<br/>
There was no &quot;kiss and make up&quot; requirement at all, ever.  There was  <br/>
&quot;Maybe you&#39;ll feel better about it later.&quot;  They did.<br/>
<br/>
I always try not to make it worse.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1170756939"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;<br/>
&gt; I always try not to make it worse.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yesterday, the mother of one of my daughter&#39;s friends called to cancel<br/>
our Saturday get-together.  Her reason was because her daughter was<br/>
being extremely disrespectful to her and so her answer was to punish her<br/>
daughter by canceling with us and sending her daughter to her dad&#39;s<br/>
house.  In the background of the phone conversation I could hear her<br/>
daughter defending her position loudly, I assume, for my benefit.<br/>
<br/>
It was a little reminder of why I stopped spending a lot of time with<br/>
this particular friend.  It was a little reminder of why I do what I do<br/>
and why I live the way I live.<br/>
<br/>
Chamille and I were talking about the whole thing, and her comment was<br/>
that she was glad that her friend still stands up for herself.  She is<br/>
very very succinct in what she says, she&#39;s been doing it since she was<br/>
about 3, which will say alot about her relationship with her mother.  By<br/>
the time she was 4, she could read and write and would leave her mother<br/>
notes on the bathroom mirror.<br/>
<br/>
I can get mad at my daughter, sometimes she does things that really<br/>
upset me.  The difference is that I can let go of my ego and look at it<br/>
from her perspective.  I can walk away and think about it and come back<br/>
to her with humility and understanding and we can discuss things and<br/>
move forward.  I even told her almost those exact same words above, that<br/>
I try not to make things worse.  I don&#39;t want to be the one stumbling<br/>
block for my daughter.  The worst thing I could do would be to be the<br/>
one that makes the situation worse, who can&#39;t get past my own issues to<br/>
treat my daughter like a human being.<br/>
<br/>
It would be really easy to damage our relationship, but I work to keep<br/>
it good.  I have never ever had an argument or disagreement with my<br/>
daughter that would lead me to threaten punishment and abandonment!  It<br/>
would tear me apart to feel that towards my daughter for even a few<br/>
hours!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1784759240">They have also been around in Korea for some time (not sure how long),<br/>
although perhaps it is because of Chinese influence.<br/>
<br/>
Watching Korean dramas I ran across a tv show that was a modern<br/>
version of a folk tale.  It led me to a Korean movie about the same<br/>
folk take that was made in 2000 that I DO recommend and it is<br/>
available on Netflix (title: Chunhyang).  It is set far in the past<br/>
(not sure when, but it is a folk tale) and they begin the movie with<br/>
someone singing the story in a really cool traditional way.  Neat<br/>
singing and a drum.  At any rate - the male lead is studying for an<br/>
exam to become a government official at some point in the story.<br/>
<br/>

It also reminded me of a Japanese drama called &quot;Tiger and Dragon&quot; that<br/>
features a Japanese form of storytelling called Rakugo.  It&#39;s a very<br/>
silly and funny show (member of the Japanese mob ends up learning<br/>
Rakugo from a Rakugo master who owes money) and it I really enjoyed<br/>
the traditional Rakugo stories that begin each episode.<br/>

through the mail the kids threw the Avatar movie from Netflix aside <br/>
in favor of the magazines that had come in the mail.<br/>
<br/>
In case the myth about television being detrimental to brain <br/>
development come to mind, I just want to add that my middle child, <br/>
who had the most tv restrictions, is the one that was labeled (ick - <br/>
that nasty word) with a developmental disorder.  Stick that under <br/>
things that make you go Hmmm?.<br/>

====I didn&#39;t take the time to read the linx on video gaming - but <br/>
when I did research earlier I couldn&#39;t find anything definitive.  So, <br/>
I look forward to reading something substantive.====<br/>

Google James Paul Gee.  He is a education professor at Arizona State <br/>
University, and although I have never met the man, he is one of my <br/>
favorite education professors.  He&#39;s on my people to meet list.  <br/>
Anyway, I am reading a fabulous book he wrote called *What Video <br/>
Games Have to Teach Us about Learning and Literacy*. He requires all <br/>
of his education students to play video games.  I have a link to an <br/>
interview with him on my blog, as well as some other links about <br/>
video games.<br/>

A final note on video gaming - my second child, the one labeled with <br/>
the developmental disorder, came out of school in the middle of first <br/>
grade as a struggling reader who hated books.  I did nothing to <br/>
address his reading other than give him free access to any video game <br/>
he wanted and read anything he asked me to read.  He recently took <br/>
over a book I was reading to his little sister and finished it <br/>
flawlessly.  I&#39;m sold on the merits of video games.<br/>
