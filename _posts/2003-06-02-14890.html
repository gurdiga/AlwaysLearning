As I recall there are big boys urinating on a little boy, parents dying and<br/>
a rooster being throttled  in the first ten minutes. I thought of saving it<br/>
for the teen years although I have seen a child&#39;s version of the book on<br/>
sale.<br/>

would probably be fine with it, depending on what grade the middle school<br/>
starts.  Grade 7 for sure, maybe grade 6, but not grade 5.  And that&#39;s a<br/>
generalization.  &lt;g&gt;  I think Lars was 12 when he saw it.<br/>
