<div id="ygrps-yiv-1559570882">Fears, complaints, worries, negativity, gripes, gossip.....  rain rain rain<br/>
and more rain.  You don&#39;t have to air them.  Having them is natural and<br/>
somewhat unavoidable.  Having drama about them is avoidable.<br/>
<br/>
Just read another Joyce gem about that very thing.  Here it is:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sometimes it rains. Getting angry about the rain, getting angry that<br/>
 </span></blockquote>it isn&#39;t sunny just adds more misery. This is obvious *and yet* it&#39;s<br/>
so easy to fall into the trap of negative thinking. Somehow it feels<br/>
satisfying to release the anger and let the universe know we&#39;re<br/>
angry. But it doesn&#39;t help. In the moment it might feel like a pot<br/>
letting off steam, but in the long run it&#39;s really just adding steam<br/>
to an already steamy room. It&#39;s good to work at letting go of the<br/>
frustration at what we can&#39;t change to help us help ourselves, so we<br/>
aren&#39;t getting in the way of our own happiness.And what helps even<br/>
more than letting go of the frustration and anger is seeking out the<br/>
good and the parts you love about right now.&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
The above applies to the subject at hand and it&#39;s *central* to unschooling.<br/>
As in vital, necessary and essential.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-554673438">More along the lines of what Joyce wrote...<br/>
<br/>
This is something that I just posted to a regional list that I just<br/>
started about how I wanted things to work on that list.  This took<br/>
place after a discussion about limiting food choices because of the<br/>
mother&#39;s desire not to buy certain kinds of food and other products<br/>
(organic, made in certain countries, from large stores, etc):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;My intention, when making this list, was for the philosophical<br/>
discussion to be more along the lines of a list like AlwaysLearning.<br/>
It is about the idea, not the person.  Ad hominem attacks on someone<br/>
would be incredibly inappropriate, but at the same time it is fine to<br/>
disagree with someone&#39;s idea... even if that idea is presented in the<br/>
form of a description of how they do things.<br/>
<br/>
My intention was not to make a support list where everyone has to say<br/>
that anything that anyone does is hunky-dory.  This ties into what<br/>
[a listmember] mentioned about respect.  I do respect that everyone has the<br/>
right to raise their own children and make decisions about how things<br/>
work in their families.  That doesn&#39;t mean, though, that I have to<br/>
respect (in the sense that I esteem and hold a high opinion of)<br/>
absolutely anything that anyone says and everything that they do<br/>
simply because they are on this list.  I expect, for example, that<br/>
[another list member] probably does not respect and hold in esteem the<br/>
fact that I<br/>
choose to shop at Target :)  She doesn&#39;t have to.  Calling me names or<br/>
saying that I am bad for doing so (or really even pointing out that<br/>
she respects me less for doing so) would be inappropriate and<br/>
irrelevant.  Discussing how choosing/not choosing to shop at Target<br/>
relates to unschooling is totally fine.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818745320">My thoughts on how to get the most out of a list like this.<br/>
<br/>
1) Lurk first.  Read old posts and follow new discussions.  Do this<br/>
for quite a while.  This is for two big reasons.  The first reason is<br/>
that they are relevant.  The problems and questions that you are<br/>
having are not unique.  You can learn a lot by reading these<br/>
discussions about other people&#39;s lives.  Think about them.  Let the<br/>
ideas stew.  Apply them to your life.  The second reason has to do<br/>
with manners.  Get a feel for the tone of the list.  This will help<br/>
you when you ask questions and when you contribute to the<br/>
conversation.<br/>
<br/>
2)  When posting questions, keep it short. If you can&#39;t do this, maybe<br/>
you need to think about your question and your situation a little<br/>
more.  Long posts explaining a problem get really old.  It&#39;s good<br/>
strategy as well as good manners.  If you start with a long winded<br/>
post, you won&#39;t have as many people (who might have had something<br/>
useful to say) read your post which means they won&#39;t reply.  Those who<br/>
do will probably be annoyed that you went on and on and may not be as<br/>
nice as they might otherwise have been.<br/>
<br/>
3)  Think before you post.  Is it helpful or interesting?  Is it even<br/>
appropriate?  Lots of people ask rhetorical questions to help you work<br/>
through your problems.  Don&#39;t post the answers to the group.  It&#39;s<br/>
annoying.  If you are responding to advice that you have been give,<br/>
don&#39;t reply right away.  Think about it some more first.  Let it stew.<br/>
 Try it out.  &quot;Yeah, but...&quot; responses to advice, explaining why all<br/>
the good advice wouldn&#39;t work for you don&#39;t go over well.  If you want<br/>
to ignore all the good advice people gave you, please do it quietly.<br/>
<br/>
4) Remember that this is not a fuzzy support group.  You have not<br/>
joined a fuzzy wuzzy place where you will be loved unconditionally and<br/>
treated the way you would treat your child.  This is a group to<br/>
discuss ideas.  It can be blunt.  VERY blunt.  Remember that it is not<br/>
about you, it is about the idea.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I love this one.  Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s part of the problem.  There were two kinda parallel lists, and  <br/>
they grew out of other lists, and other lists grew out of them.  So  <br/>
there&#39;s a flow to all this.  But I was on two lists (and only two  <br/>
lists, as to unschooling), and one has gone quiet lately.  That one  <br/>
(now quiet) had a bunch of rules.   This one had only the condition  <br/>
that if someone bugged me I&#39;d boot her (&quot;trap doors for the  <br/>
uncooperative&quot;).<br/>
<br/>
Over the years, the two lists have come to have just about the same  <br/>
set of moderators, and hundreds of the same members.  So the  <br/>
expectation is that the two will operate the same way.  So the rules  <br/>
of UnschoolingDiscussion have been oozing over to AlwaysLearning.   <br/>
But that list was trying not to have blow-ups, and I never much  <br/>
minded blow-ups myself.<br/>
<br/>
Just sayin&#39;... just for those who are helping me figure out how to  <br/>
advise new readers.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe an advice page would be sufficient.  If people want to ignore  <br/>
the advice, the rest of us don&#39;t need to feel as bad about bopping  <br/>
them, maybe.<br/>

pants... more because of lack of time.<br/>
Until about a year ago i did not know abotu such groups.  I was not a member<br/>
of any.  And since all my usual conversations/advice seeking was from<br/>
real-time-conversations.... it has taken me a long time to adjust to seeking<br/>
the same online.  The rules, ideas, expression mode, style of writing,<br/>
everything makes or breaks the conversation... esp as i&#39;m not a good writer<br/>
(yet ;-)  i struggle with this.<br/>
<br/>
And now i&#39;m desperate for these online forums/groups because i don&#39;t have<br/>
any like-minded people near me physically.  And i do so want to be able to<br/>
connect with people onliine.<br/>
<br/>
anyway... thanks Margaret.  have not read the thread... but came accross<br/>
yours while scrolling quickly and had to respond.<br/>

online with some groups. Perhaps this should be posted on the page where<br/>
the group is described? -=-<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll gather up what has been posted here and three I have through e- <br/>
mail and make something somewhere this week.   We&#39;ve learned over the  <br/>
years that people tend not to read the &quot;hi, welcome to this group&quot; e- <br/>
mails, and many join a group without even going to the main page  <br/>
where the group is described, so maybe the best use of such a page,  <br/>
when it&#39;s done, will be to send to people who are in a new-to-group  <br/>
frenzy.<br/>
<br/>
I enjoy frenzy sometimes, but I don&#39;t have as much fun when people  <br/>
can&#39;t be distracted with useful information or suggestions to read  <br/>
first and then post some more later.  So such a thing would be useful.<br/>
<br/>
Part of this is the format, I know.  A new unschooler wouldn&#39;t go to  <br/>
a conference and go up to the speaker&#39;s podium and take the  <br/>
microphone and  start talking.  It&#39;s easy, I&#39;m sure, to assume we all  <br/>
just got here instead of that some have been here helping people for  <br/>
years.  If Joyce writes one thing and someone else whose name few of  <br/>
us recognize writes the opposite, those aren&#39;t two equal opinions.   <br/>
If the new person has an opinion that dazzles Joyce and sparks some  <br/>
great ideas in other readers, LOTS of people will say wow, that&#39;s a  <br/>
great way to word that--thanks!  Joyce will probably be the first one  <br/>
to do so.  So it matters, in a situation like this, who is saying  <br/>
what, but not in the way that people have different colored speakers&#39;  <br/>
badges or ranks or awards.  It&#39;s something each reader figures out  <br/>
for herself.<br/>
<br/>
Readers will have favorite posters.  They won&#39;t be the same for  <br/>
everyone.  I love to see Deb Lewis&#39;s smiling e-mail address in my  <br/>
box, but she&#39;s really busy.  When Deb writes, I read twice.   <br/>
Different people for different people.  Schuyler&#39;s another favorite  <br/>
who doesn&#39;t post all the time.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-278060444">There is a good aspect to that conversation. The one where someone jumps in and says what &quot;good&quot; limitations they have in their household. It means you get to talk about that. You get to talk about how those kinds of limitations can work well when your children are littler, but, how if that&#39;s a hard and fast rule, it will end up biting you in the butt. You can also talk about the definition of healthy, how young children have a need for sweet and fatty for brain development and how by limiting food to low fat and sugar free you are doing poorly considered harm to that child. <br/>
<br/>
The problem for the poster of the advice is that they see themselves as their words. It&#39;s understandable, their words are all they have acting as their representative on a yahoo group. That and maybe a sig. line of a blog or a quote that inspires or makes them think. So when someone else comes along and writes about the less limited household, the household whose constraint aren&#39;t &quot;healthy&quot; but are what is wanted and what can be afforded and what is available, the poster of limitations feels attacked. And when someone else comes along and talks about the risks of limitation, the now defensive poster attacks back. And I don&#39;t think there is anything that can be done to make that less likely to happen. Even if the response is kind and gentle and warm, which it often is, the poster will read it with their own layers of bias and fear and infuse the words with tones that may incite them to greater levels of defensiveness. <br/>
<br/>
In my experience it is less likely to happen if the original poster is looking for help. There may be moments when they feel attacked or ganged up on, but it seems having been willing to put their concerns and worries into this and other public forums has already thickened their skin a bit, or made them more receptive, from the off, to the advice they are receiving. When the advice seeker tends to get grumpy and defensive is when something they posted that wasn&#39;t actually what they were asking for help with is examined and dissected, words that they framed their request with, padding to their story. <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, those are my thoughts and Linnaea is keen to have the computer, so if I don&#39;t post now I won&#39;t get this posted...at least not for a while. <br/>

If we were doing patchwork quilts, an analogy might be that someone  <br/>
brought a piece of cloth and wanted one particular part of it to  <br/>
maybe go into the quilt, and those of us already here got excited  <br/>
about another part of the cloth and weren&#39;t interested in having her  <br/>
tell us exactly which piece we should use how.<br/>
<br/>
My analogy assumes that people know that the purpose of the list is  <br/>
more like making a quilt than it is like being a help desk.  We do  <br/>
serve the help-desk function pretty well sometimes anyway.  Sometimes  <br/>
I feel like a pharmacist (chemist for the britoid readership) who&#39;s  <br/>
talking shop behind the counter for fun for  years, and then someone  <br/>
comes in and tells a desperate story and wants help.  So I prescribe  <br/>
a couple of webpages and expect them to read it and if it helps, to  <br/>
come back for more.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, though, someone will come in with a need they think they  <br/>
have, and if they actually are to be assisted in getting closer to  <br/>
unschooling, they need something altogether different.<br/>
<br/>
Customer:  &quot;I haven&#39;t slept for 72 hours and I need something to keep  <br/>
me awake.&quot;<br/>
Me:  &quot;You need to sleep.&quot;<br/>
Customer:  &quot;I can&#39;t sleep.&quot;<br/>
Me thinking &quot;uh... wait&quot; and saying:  &quot;I can give you something to  <br/>
help you sleep, and some ideas about how to sleep more regularly,  <br/>
because it&#39;s not safe to have driven or even walked here if you  <br/>
haven&#39;t slept for 72 hours, and you&#39;re likely to get sick from any  <br/>
passing germ because your immune system can&#39;t operate well this way...&quot;<br/>
Customer:  &quot;You have a pharmacy.  You HAVE to sell me something to  <br/>
keep me awake.&quot;<br/>
Me:  &quot;No I don&#39;t.  I&#39;m in the business of helping people be  healthy,  <br/>
and I can&#39;t assist you in a situation that goes counter to health and  <br/>
safety.   Anyway,  this is a FREE pharmacy and this is just an  <br/>
analogy, and in any case, I don&#39;t have to give you diddly-squat.&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>As a long time lurker over at UnschoolingDiscussion (since before it moved<br/>
over to google) I would like to say thanks for giving the diddly squat that<br/>
you do.<br/>
Here&#39;s a snip of a reply you once gave me back in May of 2007:<br/>
**********************************<br/>
-=-I feel like I&#39;ve started in that direction, but there are many<br/>
instances<br/>
when I fall right back into the &quot;old&quot; way of responding to certain<br/>
situations. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Probably everyone does, at times of stress, at least for a half a<br/>
second of thought, if not in word or action.<br/>
<br/>
The plan is to get further and further away from there all the time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-  I think I need to find peace and acceptance for myself before I<br/>
can fully share that w/ my children.<br/>
-=-<br/>
<br/>
You mean work on your own problems first and let your children wait?<br/>
How long?<br/>
<br/>
I think it will help you find peace and acceptance for you to give<br/>
your children what you wish you had had when you were younger.  Then<br/>
you&#39;ll be healing all of you at the same time.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I just really don&#39;t know where to start.-=-<br/>

     ***************************<br/>
So I read and I read and I read some more.  I lurked for awhile too on<br/>
UnschoolingBasics and AlwaysUnschooled and really received some thoughtful<br/>
replies to specific issues I was sorting through pertaining to food and<br/>
sleeping.<br/>
I was worried about my girl eating 3 or 4 popsicles for breakfast.<br/>
lol, it really seems so long ago and we have come so far.  Food isn&#39;t<br/>
limited in any form.  I now go down the chip and soda isle every week<br/>
because there are people in my family who like having those choices<br/>
available.  (Thanks Kelly Lovejoy for opeing my eyes to my selfishness)  We<br/>
are in SC and have been on Kelly&#39;s group, SOS, for quite some time too.<br/>
My daughter still has days when she wants popsicles, chocolate or chips and<br/>
there are other days she asks for steak, green beans, corn, carrots and many<br/>
differnent types of foods.<br/>
There are many other topics that I have been able to see in a different<br/>
light because of the diddly squat that&#39;s given on these lists.  I would<br/>
encourage those that are *really* seeking a more peaceful life to take these<br/>
suggestions and advice, not as personal attacks, but as a means to a<br/>
different way of looking at things.  Which in turn, can be literally life<br/>
changing.<br/>
It has for us.<br/>

read (at least some of) the list description.  It had a list of rules<br/>
and the last rule was that you had to copy and paste a phrase into the<br/>
membership application. The thing they wanted you to include in your<br/>
application said that you would not mention scanlations and that you<br/>
would read the FAQ.   I found out the hard way that they really do<br/>
reject you without it :)  They sent a polite message saying that I<br/>
should read the rules if I still wanted to join.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hi sandra,<br/>
I wish I could remember when I joined this list...is there any way I<br/>
could find that out?<br/>
I know that I joined the first four unschooling lists all on the same<br/>
evening...<br/>
<br/>
but I was reading joyfully rejoycing and your site long before I<br/>
joined and somewhere out there, I read the bit you quoted in the<br/>
original post by joyce.  <br/>
<br/>
And when I finally joined, I read, and read, and thought and discussed<br/>
things with my eldest dd Lucia (21yr) (who is really enthusiastic<br/>
about unschooling philosophy) and Im really glad I read that little<br/>
bit there by joyce because there were many times I thought someone was<br/>
just not being realistic...and then patiently Id keep reading<br/>
(sometimes impatiently wanting to post but knowing better, lol) and<br/>
violà, (as my smallest loves to say, from bwana and Koala) sandra (or<br/>
joyce or pam or schuyler or someone) would write something that just<br/>
pulled it all to gether.  <br/>
<br/>
Because often talking about unlimited computer or television it would<br/>
look like to me that there was a lot of &quot;un parenting&quot; going on.  <br/>
And to me, the crux of what makes no limits work is connection...<br/>
<br/>
I could see this in our family with just about everything else, but<br/>
with tv, well, we dont have one...we live where there is no reception<br/>
and only recently have they improved that for the locals here.  And<br/>
computer connections were costly and just as poor, again do to<br/>
location.  but last summer we got the fast and cheap connections<br/>
available (finally!) and all of a sudden we could get youtube, and<br/>
video games on line and then we go a wonderful mac :o)<br/>
<br/>
Thank goodness I had been reading! because that was dutifully pointed<br/>
out in wonderful ways, and since its all about connection, and being<br/>
present, when gaming and videos came into our lives,we were ready to<br/>
embrace it.  And its been just wonderful for us.  All my fear mantras<br/>
about tv video games had been argued away by others, without me ever<br/>
having had to step in and chime in (about how horrible it all is for<br/>
children).  <br/>
<br/>
Also when people would talk about food, and no limits, at first I<br/>
didnt get it at all! Not because I was a limit freak, not at all. WE<br/>
dont do limits here, and our children eat what they wish...but <br/>
I would read a few &quot;disaster&quot; stories where a mamma would lift all<br/>
limits and then be shocked by the obsession that seemed to follow, and<br/>
Id sort of wonder really loudly (to my dd) about that, as I was<br/>
thinking that if that is unschooling, I can do without.<br/>
<br/>
So thanks to joyce&#39;s words, again I kept my mouth shut and kept<br/>
reading...and sure enough someone came along to point out that going<br/>
cold turkey on limits and control is not always the best way to go<br/>
about it... or atleast dont tell the kids you are going cold turkey!<br/>
So then I got the picture that what I was reading about was not a<br/>
&quot;pure&quot; version of no food limits.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I think a link to your advice page is a great idea, and<br/>
forsure, make that advice page linked just about everywhere you go<br/>
within your site...especially near the part where youve got the links<br/>
to the lists...but Im sure you&#39;ve already thought of that.<br/>
<br/>
this has got to be the longest post ive made, here...Ive got a<br/>
terribly sore back and my kids are being so sweet and letting me play<br/>
here today :o)  <br/>
<br/>
Im really happy I read that bit there and just sat back a bit to<br/>
absorb it all in...<br/>
<br/>
melissa in italy<br/>
mamma of 7<br/>
who wonders if sandra remembers little notes Id send offlist once and<br/>
again saying thank you for writing such and that?  probably not, as<br/>
she must get jazillions!</div>

Unschooling is the OPPOSITE of unparenting - it is connecting, being  <br/>
attentive, observing, sharing, engaging, carefully providing distance  <br/>
when needed, being &quot;right there&quot; on top of things when needed,  <br/>
providing input, listening listening listening, showing, assisting,  <br/>
comforting, inspiring, supporting, offering ideas, digging up  <br/>
resources, finding out what&#39;s &quot;out there&quot; that would interest the  <br/>
child, modeling! And there  is lots more - but that&#39;s enough to be  <br/>
clear that it is certainly not &quot;unparenting.&quot;<br/>
