<div id="ygrps-yiv-705552705">My 13 yr old daughter has decided she wants to be a vegetarian and not eat<br/>
meat.  I&#39;d like to support her in this (I&#39;m a big meat eater, so I&#39;m<br/>
clueless!) and find some websites and books that are good without all of the<br/>
agenda and scare tactics of groups like PETA (we&#39;ve visited some sites on<br/>
the web and talked about some of that), and also good books we might find.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
This is all new to me and I know a lot of you are vegetarians or vegans.<br/>
Any information or help pointing me in the right direction would be helpful!<br/>
You can e-mail me off list as this is not an unschooling topic (unless<br/>
others need/want the info, too).<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>

Congrats to your daughter! We just made the switch to vegetarianism <br/>
not long ago (our son chose to continue eating meat since he <br/>
says &quot;real men need meat&quot;! lol) and we feel really good.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest advice I would say is to avoid too much soy/tofu, <br/>
especially at her young age. Soy can mimic estrogen in the body and <br/>
may throw her hormones out of wack. If she starts to crave protein, <br/>
go for beans, seeds, or Ezekial bread instead. Or if she&#39;s not <br/>
avoiding dairy, it has good protein as well.<br/>
<br/>
Have you checked out vrg.com? I don&#39;t do a lot of research on it but <br/>
that site seems to be less scare tactics with good info as well as <br/>
recipes.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2094839537">My very favorite cook book of all times is &quot;Passionate Vegetarian&quot; by  <br/>
Crescent Dragonwagon.  It is like a novel about food.  At 1,110 pages  <br/>
long (seriously!) it is a wealth of knowledge.  Even if you aren&#39;t a  <br/>
vegetarian, this book is awesome as she goes into great details about  <br/>
food and how its grown, different varieties, how to pick them, how to  <br/>
cook them, etc.  The way she talks about food you would swear she was  <br/>
talking about sex!  lol  It will stir up the passion for food in  <br/>
anyone and believe it or not,  I have actually read the cookbook  <br/>
cover to cover.<br/>
