<div id="ygrps-yiv-631408383">Deb, we hardly even discuss upcoming conferences on this list, let  <br/>
alone past conferences.<br/>
<br/>
There are other conferences to go to.  Kelly did it for years and for  <br/>
whatever reason she doesn&#39;t want to do it, that&#39;s not something that  <br/>
will help other people understand unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Conferences are a lot of work, and she&#39;s done for now.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m several hours behind on e-mail, but I came to check for personal  <br/>
stuff and saw this and I hope to limit the discussion up front.<br/>
<br/>
This site has announcements and discussions of upcoming conferences  <br/>
and such:<br/>

I&#39;m not sure if you got my e-mail about the conference, but I was<br/>
wondering why it won&#39;t be happening next year? I just found out about<br/>
it last week, and though I wouldn&#39;t have probably gone this year<br/>
(traveling with two babies who HATE car seats just doesn&#39;t work very<br/>
well for me) but NEXT year...who knows???<br/>
<br/>
WHY????<br/>

I answered you privately.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m tired and have other interests I want to pursue.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s important to understand that *many* things---not just unschooling <br/>
conferences---should be taken advantage of while you have the <br/>
opportunity. There is never a guarantee that ANYTHING---or <br/>
anyONE---will be around another year. Take the time---MAKE the <br/>
time---to experience things when you *can*. You may never get another <br/>
chance.<br/>
<br/>
There are PLENTY of other unschooling gatherings now. Lots. LOTS! Just <br/>
not Live and Learn. But almost every area of the country (as well as <br/>
Costa Rica and Canada!) has something to help you enjoy other <br/>
unschoolers. If not, start one!<br/>
