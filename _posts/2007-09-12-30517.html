<div id="ygrps-yiv-1306573025">My son (now 16) was a horrible speller.  The funny thing  is that while in <br/>
school (Public School K-3rd) he aced Spelling tests.  He  won tons of Spelling <br/>
awards.  He made A&#39;s in Spelling straight down the  line every year.  He still <br/>
couldn&#39;t spell.  After we started  homeschooling (not unschooling) he still <br/>
aced Spelling tests but could not spell  in real life situations.  I was awful <br/>
about it, too.  When he would  ask me how to spell a word (while making a <br/>
birthday card or labeling something  he drew or whatever) I would say &quot;you know <br/>
where the dictionary is.&quot;  What  a crappy mom!  Since our unschooling life has <br/>
begun, he&#39;s gotten  comfortable again asking me how to spell something for <br/>
MySpace or something and  I happily tell him and he remembers for next time.  <br/>
Imagine that...no  tests, no drills.  If he forgot, I&#39;d happily tell him again if <br/>
he  asked.  Now he&#39;s a decent speller.  Probably no Spelling awards in his  <br/>
future, but he does okay.  LOL  <br/>
