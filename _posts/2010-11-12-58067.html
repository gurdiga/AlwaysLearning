<div id="ygrps-yiv-2081407313">How many immediately think God when spirituality is mentioned? Or  <br/>
being one with the big Oneness (however you might define it.)<br/>
<br/>
But if you look at spirituality as how we connect with each other (and  <br/>
with the past, the world, the universe, and greater powers if you  <br/>
believe in them), what are the ways you connect to your kids and your  <br/>
partner?<br/>
<br/>
The first thing I thought of was how appalled most parents would be if  <br/>
I said we connect by watching a movie with dinner each night. ;-) And  <br/>
yet it&#39;s true. We&#39;re all emotionally connected to each other through  <br/>
the movies (and now TV shows) we all enjoy. The practice is years long  <br/>
so it connects us all the way to Kathryn&#39;s younger self. It&#39;s given us  <br/>
a common language and points of reference. We can (among many others)  <br/>
use &quot;On Teb, on!&quot; (from Galaxy Quest) and know how it connects to the  <br/>
situation and it also emotionally connects us and the moment with  <br/>
something we all enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
Once I accepted that as a spiritual practice, I came up with lots more  <br/>
but wanted to throw it out for others&#39; ideas :-)<br/>
<br/>
So what are the on going practices you connect through, one on one or  <br/>
with the whole family?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1378830271">Movies for us too. There are a few movies especially which we as a family<br/>
connect watching together. It is an Indian film. &#39;Jab we met&#39; Meaning when<br/>
we met. It is about a young girl while travelling back home from college<br/>
saves a young man from depression because he lost his love. How she misses<br/>
her train and he helps her to get back home starting a real bond between the<br/>
two.<br/>
<br/>
We all enjoy that film. Then we connect with Madagascar and Shahrukh Khan<br/>
films.<br/>
<br/>
Well spirituality is for me at the moment connecting with my self and my<br/>
emotions and the roots of those emotions.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-206704838">For me, this is especially important... to see the new paths of connection<br/>
between close family as meaningful and full. Both Brian and I come from<br/>
Christian childhoods and seeing the importance of how we connect now has<br/>
been challenging at times because of the emotional ties there from our<br/>
childhoods. Because our present lives aren&#39;t full of Christian connections.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for putting your post that way, Joyce. That&#39;s helpful for me to think<br/>
on.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-785743430">Joyce, thanks for bringing this up.  A young friend asked me the other day<br/>
when I mentioned that food was spiritual for me- how does that happen?  It<br/>
was difficult to explain and while I don&#39;t think there is at this point an<br/>
immediate sense of spiritual connectedness within our family to food- there<br/>
are other ways.  Over the last yr or so we &quot;religiously&quot; (haha) rented out<br/>
Little House movies from the library and found that not only did they help<br/>
our family to discuss community and many principles concerning  ethics ,as<br/>
well as bits of history, but we certainly shared this closeness and bonding.<br/>
Often we would laugh at different times about characters and a few times my<br/>
son or daughter would refer to someone or someone reminding them of parts of<br/>
the show or characters.<br/>

unconventional things our lives are still filled with joy and learning!!!<br/>

<h4>Joyce Fetteroll</h4>
<time>14 Nov 2010, at  5:06am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-492135818">Here&#39;s some other spiritual practices I came up with. Some fleshed  <br/>
out. Some kind of random at the end.<br/>
<br/>
Carl and I read books to Kathryn each night. Sometimes they were just  <br/>
books, part of the ritual before bedtime. Sometimes, if they were  <br/>
books we both loved that connected us, the time moved up several  <br/>
notches to spiritual.<br/>
<br/>
Every night for years and years, Carl has made chocolate milk at  <br/>
dinner for Kathryn. But he delivers not just the chocolate milk but  <br/>
the gift of his appreciation of something she enjoys which connects  <br/>
them in the moment and with their shared past.<br/>
<br/>
Playing games together, especially video games because those tend to  <br/>
be more personalizable and emotionally connecting.<br/>
<br/>
Carl and Kathryn have played Madden football together for years. All  <br/>
three of us played Animal Crossing. Oddly it&#39;s a one-player-at-a-time  <br/>
game. What was connecting was understanding the can&#39;t-be-explained- <br/>
with-words enjoyment and satisfaction of the activities. Like pulling  <br/>
the weeds that sprout up each night and fishing for the rare fish.  <br/>
Sounds dull written out. The pleasure can only be understood through  <br/>
experience. It&#39;s not only fun to do, but inexplicably enjoyable to  <br/>
watch others do it.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes the games we played together were just fun games. For me,  <br/>
Super Smash Brothers was just a fun game. Perhaps because I wasn&#39;t  <br/>
very good at it so couldn&#39;t experience the same feelings my daughter  <br/>
could. For a game to elevate to a connecting of spirits, there needs  <br/>
to be not just shared enjoyment but a deeper shared understanding that  <br/>
we&#39;re having very similar feelings.<br/>
<br/>
Shared emotions -- when we&#39;re all feeling the same thing -- that leads  <br/>
to synergy of emotion -- that extra you get when individuals share the  <br/>
same emotions -- connects us. (Which is probably why strangers can  <br/>
feel so strongly connected when they ride out a crisis together.) My  <br/>
family and my sister went to Disney World and had a fun time. We  <br/>
shared similar emotions. But the only connection I remember that rose  <br/>
above mutual enjoyment was the Jungle Cruise where the guides are a  <br/>
bit irreverent of the Disney experience. We did that one 3 times. It  <br/>
wasn&#39;t just more enjoyable but a synergy of joy. :-)<br/>
<br/>
We both greet Carl at the door, asking if he needs help bringing stuff  <br/>
in from the car. It was never a requirement  for Kathryn to join me --  <br/>
which might rouse negative emotions and associate them with his  <br/>
arrival. My attitude when he pulled in the drive was laced with  <br/>
positive emotions, &quot;Oh, Daddy&#39;s home!&quot; And for her it connected with  <br/>
her toddler-view of the world that already knew that was an awesome  <br/>
thing and carried that on through the years. She&#39;s 19 and still thinks  <br/>
it&#39;s awesome.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just a hi when he comes home. It&#39;s a mindful pause, a time to  <br/>
give full attention. Sometimes he walks in at an awkward moment in  <br/>
dinner preparation but I&#39;m conscious that he and the connection are  <br/>
more important than dinner and do what I can to get to the connection  <br/>
as soon as I can.<br/>
<br/>
Cooking. Not all cooking is spiritual or mindful. Sometimes it&#39;s just  <br/>
food grabbed quickly or tossed in a pan to get dinner done as quickly  <br/>
as possible. But it can elevate it to the spiritual when you connect  <br/>
to your family -- and yourself too! -- with some extra attention that  <br/>
says they&#39;re worth the extra effort. It needn&#39;t be elaborate. It might  <br/>
be getting the top split hotdog buns instead of the side split. My  <br/>
mother used to cut peanut butter and jelly sandwiches into 4 sticks, a  <br/>
triangle and a circle and assemble them into a person on a plate. A  <br/>
HoHo (snack cake) connects me to my childhood. As a child I always  <br/>
stripped the chocolate coating off to eat that first. Then sometimes  <br/>
I&#39;d unroll it and nibble it that way. I showed my daughter how to do  <br/>
that and it gave her a small connection with my child-self.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra often points out that you get to choose whether to stir anger  <br/>
into the meal as you&#39;re cooking or joy. You can choose whether to  <br/>
connect or disconnect.<br/>
<br/>
And, of course, cooking can connect you to the earth when you think  <br/>
about a red pepper being a package of rain and sunshine from  <br/>
California or the organic farm in the next town or the container  <br/>
garden on your porch.<br/>
<br/>
The cat was sitting on the washing machine next to the running dryer.  <br/>
Since I know she likes the warmth of the dryer, I cleared the top of  <br/>
the dryer off for her and she moved over. The other cat loves dropping  <br/>
a pipe cleaner into their water bowl and fishing it back out again. If  <br/>
I see it astray, I return it next to the bowl so it&#39;s handy for her to  <br/>
play with.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes I remember to buy a birthday cake for Christmas eve dinner  <br/>
and we sing Happy Birthday to Jesus. Since we&#39;re not Christian, it&#39;s a  <br/>
connection to the human being but the Catholic relatives enjoyed it  <br/>
too and for them there was probably an added spiritual dimension.<br/>
<br/>
Recycling. You can choose to let the bulky annoyance aspect of  <br/>
recycling color your vision or see that each item diverted from the  <br/>
trash connects you with the earth through being a caretaker in a small  <br/>
way.<br/>
<br/>
Connections with yourself. Like meditation. Cup of special tea that  <br/>
you sip with awareness. Buying that piece of pumpkin cheesecake  <br/>
because you&#39;re worth it and worth the time to savor each bite :-)<br/>
<br/>
Connections with a stranger. Random act of kindness can connect you  <br/>
with the world when they&#39;re done anonymously. Just the thought you  <br/>
made someone somewhere smile. :-) Or when you stop and give someone a  <br/>
moment of your time to help them out, it&#39;s not just nice but there&#39;s a  <br/>
connection formed and you get back more than you give :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1111387436">I studied religion/spirituality/psychology at university, which started an ongoing interest in Buddhism, both as study and practice. An old friend of mine, a friend I met in a Thai monastery more than 20 years ago, and only see very infrequently, recently asked me how my practice was going these days. In that moment I realised my spiritual practice these days is radical unschooling!! Yes, it&#39;s all there  mindfulness, being present, paying attention, being peaceful, making better choices . I could go on and on. Before I had children it was possible to do 10 day silent retreats and such like, and for a while after having them I thought I would never practice again. Now I realise how limiting that view was and know that my children have been the biggest gift to my own personal spiritual practice.<br/>

<time>15 Nov 2010, at  8:25am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-558963018">I was at an event, and felt immediately drawn to a woman there. She<br/>
noticed my tattoo (a zen enso, or painted circle) and asked about it and<br/>
started talking about her Buddhist teacher. I asked if her teacher was<br/>
Teijo Munnich, someone I had studied with for a time. I felt certain it<br/>
was, and she confirmed that it was! When I told her about my previous<br/>
studies, I was feeling a tiny bit guilty about not having as intense a<br/>
practice as I once did. Then I remembered that as a radical unschooler,<br/>
I&#39;ve chosen for connection with my guys to be my #1 priority, and<br/>
everything else settles in after that, and the guilt vanished.<br/>
Consciously choosing that priority really helps my other choices come<br/>
into focus.<br/>
<br/>
She said our teacher had recently said, &quot;Real life is your practice -<br/>
zazen&#39;s a vacation!&quot; (Zazen is zen meditation -- sitting.)<br/>
<br/>
And it&#39;s true. Nothing has brought me back to THIS moment, again and<br/>
again, being present in a real way, as much as radical unschooling, and<br/>
the commitment I made to this way of life, to my boys.<br/>
<br/>
Because of my childhood and other factors, I had to learn how to be here<br/>
with Evan and Seth, how to really connect, how to be present, not just<br/>
physically here. This journey has been amazing and full of gifts. I have<br/>
no doubt that one day I&#39;ll take a ten-day silent retreat, but for now,<br/>
our messy, sometimes loud, lives are plenty grist for the mill.<br/>
<br/>
Joyce, I was recently telling a friend how much I enjoyed fishing in<br/>
Animal Crossing - standing there, peacefully, with the sound of the<br/>
waves as accompaniment. Schuyler has written about finding a minute here<br/>
and there to connect with yourself, rather than believing you need a big<br/>
chunk of time away from your kids. Animal Crossing fishing provided me<br/>
with that minute AND connection with the guys.<br/>
<br/>
We watch youtube videos together. With six years between the boys, it&#39;s<br/>
getting trickier to find shows or movies we can all enjoy together, but<br/>
we can spend lots of time on youtube, laughing together.<br/>
<br/>
peace,<br/>
Caren<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1810405429">-=-With six years between the boys, it&#39;s<br/>
getting trickier to find shows or movies we can all enjoy together, but<br/>
we can spend lots of time on youtube, laughing together.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Soon it will be easier than ever to find things you all enjoy together.<br/>
<br/>
Six or eight years ago, I wrote to Pam Sorooshian and asked her  <br/>
whether what we were doing with this list and other similar places  <br/>
wasn&#39;t some kind of spiritual business, and she confirmed that it  <br/>
was.   It was for me, anyway.  It doesn&#39;t have to be for everyone.   <br/>
Some people can go to church and be totally active (deacon, or altar  <br/>
society, or whatever as applicable to &quot;extra active&quot;) and not have  <br/>
spiritual experiences--just go there &#39;to attend&#39;--for the social life  <br/>
and the community service or whatever.    Some people can be really  <br/>
spiritual but not useful to other people.  (They can invoke the  <br/>
feeling of being one with God, whatever that biochemical set is, I  <br/>
mean.)<br/>
<br/>
There is something empowering and humbling at the same time in helping  <br/>
provide freedom and flexibility in the life of another person.<br/>

and one of the Christian groups recommended it for that age. It never  <br/>
would have occurred to me! But she loved it. The first book is a  <br/>
little easier than the rest and I don&#39;t think I read the next until  <br/>
she was 5.<br/>
<br/>
But I just mentioned here (I think it was) that Kathryn was fascinated  <br/>
by dinosaurs and listened to Red Raptor at 4 which wasn&#39;t anywhere  <br/>
close to being a kids book.<br/>

We have done a lot of things around them, like harvesting corn and grinding it <br/>
and baking corn cookies, cooking stuf like they ate, trying a day without <br/>
electricity, knitting and sewing. Lots of fun stuf.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I read the first one Little House in the Big Woods to them when they were very little, 4 or 5.  And we had some fun doing the things Ma did.  We made butter out of cream, donuts and maple candy in snow.  We also tried washing clothes in a tub (they LOVED that and would occasionally do that for fun even years later)  and making little homemade toys.  It was really a lot of fun.  The other books were a bit tougher, their lives had some real dangers and difficulties and LIW was pretty opinionated about how people ought to behave.  I liked &quot;Farm Boy&quot; written about Almonzo&#39;s childhood on a farm back East for some of the same kinds of homey descriptions of life back then.  There are loads of picture books and recipe books for kids available based on the stories since they are so popular.  As we grew into the other books there were many discussions about the way children are treated then and now and about the relationships in the book.  I know many religious homeschoolers who would treat these books as fine examples of how children ought to behave etc.  I would avoid that... also &lt;spoiler&gt;  my kids were very upset when Jack, the Bulldog died.  My kids were about 10 at the hight of their fascination for the series.<br/>

<br/>
Its worthwhile to consider why you want to read those books, though. Is it just the tie-in to something your child likes already? The books aren&#39;t really like the shows in that sense - the shows emphasize the social relationships a whole lot more, while the books have looooong passages describing how people lived. So it might be better to get a sense of what your child Likes about the series and look for more of that. <br/>
<br/>
Does your child like to be read to? Mo didn&#39;t and still doesn&#39;t, although she sometimes enjoys reading to me. Its not a given that a child will enjoy being read to. <br/>
