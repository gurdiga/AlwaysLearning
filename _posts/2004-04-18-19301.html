&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;So I would really like some feedback on if I did<br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; right thing here - I was finally feeling like I<br/>
&gt; was getting the <br/>
&gt; &gt; correct &quot;ideas&quot; of this &quot;unschooling or Life<br/>
&gt; Learning&quot;, that it was <br/>
&gt; &gt; starting to make sense to me, and my son is so<br/>
&gt; much happier than he <br/>
&gt; &gt; was in school, but now that my closest<br/>
&gt; &quot;unschooling&quot; friend is <br/>
&gt; &gt; questioning me so I feel confused again.  &lt;&lt;<br/>

Sounds like you did a fantastic job of allowin your<br/>
son to take responsibility in his own way.  I hope my<br/>
son in a similar situation would handle it as well as<br/>
your son did, ie  next day apologize on his own, day<br/>
of incident acknowledge wrongdoing.  Wow!  What a<br/>
responsible son.  He really deseves to hear that<br/>
although he made a mistake he handled it really well.<br/>
<br/>
Sounds to me like your friend, the other mom, is<br/>
angry.  Instead of being upfront about her feelings<br/>
she wants you to punish your son, rather than address<br/>
her feelings.  She probably thinks that if you would<br/>
only punish him, then she wouldn&#39;t feel angry anymore.<br/>
 Well, maybe it would help to acknowledge her unspoken<br/>
feelings too.  Something like, &quot;I really hear that you<br/>
are upset about this, and I can understand that you<br/>
might be angry that your son was bitten, I would be<br/>
too if i where in your shoes.  It must feel hard to<br/>
place your son in our care, and then not be there to<br/>
protect him when something like this happens.  I am<br/>
sorry too that this happened.&quot;  Perhaps if she can<br/>
feel acknowledged in this way some of her own anger<br/>
will disipate.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t change your parenting style because she is<br/>
uncomfortable with it.  She can learn or not, but you<br/>
did a beautiful job.  If she is uncomfortable leaving<br/>
her son in your care, so be it, but given your<br/>
description I would love for my son to be treated so<br/>
well if i ever left him with someone.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry this is so hard.  I hope it resolves soon. Mary<br/>
