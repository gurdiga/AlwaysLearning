<div id="ygrps-yiv-498556710">I was looking up what other books Mira Kirshenbaum, the author of  <br/>
Parent/Teen Breakthrough, had written and found she has a  <br/>
relationship blog (and lists and lots of other things too.) The  <br/>
subject of husbands comes up a lot and how to get them to change. It  <br/>
just feels so important to get them to see things the &quot;right&quot; way  <br/>
that you can lose sight of the fact that the relationship is more  <br/>
important than being right. (If you end up divorced it&#39;s the judge  <br/>
who gets to be &quot;right&quot; and he or she is even less likely to be  <br/>
patient with your alternative parenting and education.)<br/>
<br/>
I really like the way she writes. She sees right through a lot of the  <br/>
emotional tangles that can screw up people&#39;s clear thinking.<br/>

The Ultimate, Best Ever, Top 10 Do&#39;s and Don&#39;ts for Having a Long,  <br/>
Happy Marriage<br/>

If you want a long, happy marriage, all you need is a bathroom  <br/>
mirror.  Then write down these 10 do&#39;s and don&#39;ts, tape them to the  <br/>
side of your bathroom mirror where you can see them every day, and  <br/>
you&#39;ll be all set.  Of course you actually have to do the do&#39;s and  <br/>
not do the don&#39;ts, but that&#39;s a mere detail.<br/>
<br/>
The point is --- and it&#39;s a revolutionary point, when you think about  <br/>
it --- that you don&#39;t have to be a genius or a saint for the two of  <br/>
you to stay happy with each other.  Love is a strong, healthy force.   <br/>
All you have to do is nurture it a little bit and avoid screwing it  <br/>
up too badly.  And it will be there for you when you&#39;re in your  <br/>
golden years.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, in no particular order, here are Mira&#39;s top 10 most important  <br/>
do&#39;s and don&#39;ts:<br/>
<br/>
1.  DO get this through your sweet head: you need to accept your  <br/>
partner as is.  The people we love are the way they are, and we&#39;ve  <br/>
got to love them for that.  That&#39;s what a great, long-lasting  <br/>
marriage is: two very imperfect people who love each other not in  <br/>
spite of their imperfections but with their imperfections.<br/>
<br/>
2.  DO really listen to each other.  Making each other feel heard  <br/>
down to your very toes is one of the sexiest, most healthful things  <br/>
you can do.  It&#39;s not about being silent while the other person is  <br/>
talking and then saying, &quot;Yes, but...&quot; and then immediately inserting  <br/>
your own opinion.  Instead it&#39;s about asking questions when the other  <br/>
person talks, unpacking what she says, getting inside and all around  <br/>
everything she feels about this issue.<br/>
<br/>
3.  DO show how much you appreciate each other.  Words are  <br/>
important.  Say how much you&#39;ve valued every little thing your  <br/>
partner does that makes your life better.  You should be saying a lot  <br/>
more appreciative things than criticisms.  But actions are just as  <br/>
important.  A hug, a tender kiss, a small gift, a helpful hand are  <br/>
all great ways of underlining your words of appreciation.<br/>
<br/>
4.  DO have fun together.  Fun is the glue of intimacy.  If you&#39;re  <br/>
not having fun, you&#39;re not doing it right.  Now it doesn&#39;t matter  <br/>
what you do for fun --- that&#39;s different for everybody.  But know  <br/>
what your fun things are and make sure you do them.<br/>
<br/>
5.  DO think long and hard every day about what it must be like to be  <br/>
in a relationship with you.  Here&#39;s an example.  Think about how you  <br/>
must seem when you come home from work.  Would you guess you&#39;re kind  <br/>
of grumpy?  Or maybe you act in another way that&#39;s not so fun?  Be  <br/>
honest.  What must it be like to have to deal with that?  This isn&#39;t  <br/>
just about coming home from work; it&#39;s about other ways you are in  <br/>
your relationship.  Once you see yourself through your partner&#39;s  <br/>
eyes, that&#39;s just got to change the way you act.  If you wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
want to have to deal with you, why should your partner have to?<br/>
<br/>
6.  DON&#39;T act miserable and gloomy.  Yeah, I know, you shouldn&#39;t walk  <br/>
around with a fake smile plastered on your face.  But complainers,  <br/>
downers, Mr. and Ms. Negatives make their relationship a place you  <br/>
want to get the heck away from.<br/>
<br/>
7.  DON&#39;T live in the past.  Don&#39;t dwell on the past.  Don&#39;t talk  <br/>
about the past.  Look, I know you&#39;ve both done things to hurt each  <br/>
other.  But love and happiness can only die if you live in a museum  <br/>
of past hurts.  Instead, focus on your needs in the present.<br/>
<br/>
8. DON&#39;T deny your most important needs.  When you identify which  <br/>
unmet needs mean the most to you, tell your partner what they are.   <br/>
Do it one at a time.  Make it clear what exactly your partner needs  <br/>
to do.  Unsatisfied needs corrode love. But when you satisfy each  <br/>
other&#39;s needs, love thrives.<br/>
<br/>
9.  DON&#39;T neglect touching.  The physical dimension of your  <br/>
relationship is like a fountain of youth.  I&#39;m not necessarily  <br/>
talking about sex, although that&#39;s important too.  But just as  <br/>
important is hugging, kissing, snuggling, holding hands and rubbing  <br/>
each other&#39;s feet or shoulders.  You should have some warm,  <br/>
meaningful physical contact every day.<br/>
<br/>
10.  DON&#39;T forget to have a life.  Marriage is a big deal.  It plays  <br/>
a huge role in your happiness and your sense of yourself.  But it&#39;s  <br/>
not everything.  It certainly can&#39;t give you what you can get for  <br/>
yourself from having a life of your own.  If you try to make your  <br/>
marriage do more for you than it can, you&#39;ll end up polluting it with  <br/>
your disappointment.  But if you have a life along with your  <br/>
marriage, the two support each other.<br/>
<br/>
Well, that&#39;s what I believe.  I&#39;d love to hear what you think.  What  <br/>
do&#39;s or don&#39;ts do you want to add to mine?  Maybe your list is better  <br/>
than this.  I&#39;d love to find out.  Let me hear from you.  And if you  <br/>
don&#39;t agree with any of mine, let me know that too.  Also, vote for  <br/>
which of my top 10s you think is most important.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have some good news for you.  I&#39;ve just started an exciting  <br/>
group that will provide support and invaluable suggestions for  <br/>
pulling our relationships out of the doldrums, putting the spark back  <br/>
in love, and fixing the most common relationship problems.  Plus  <br/>
we&#39;ll have a lot of fun and it could make all the difference for  <br/>
you!  I hope you will check out my new group and join it.  To get to  <br/>
