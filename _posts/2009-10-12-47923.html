<div id="ygrps-yiv-1638226070">Forty years into it, Sesame Street is more available now than it ever  <br/>
was.  I turned this one on because it showed up after Rebel L.   It&#39;s  <br/>
&quot;Born to Add,&quot; a Bruce Springsteen parody.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN4eGVZk08c&NR=1">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wN4eGVZk08c&NR=1</a><br/>
<br/>
I got a long chill, hearing it for the first time in years, from  <br/>
remembering it when the kids were little.  We used to tape Sesame  <br/>
Street a lot, and somewhere I have a best-of video tape but I don&#39;t  <br/>
need it now that they&#39;re putting more and more of them online  <br/>
officially.  I&#39;m glad they are.<br/>
<br/>
There are SO many things on there to help make connections for kids  <br/>
and parents both, and there&#39;s art, and construction, and there was Mel  <br/>
Gibson doing Hamlet with Elmo, and Smokey Robinson doing &quot;U Really Got  <br/>
a Hold on Me&quot;:<br/>

<br/>
Some of the comments there say the kids were scared of it as a kid.   <br/>
But it&#39;s interesting to look at how they did it (as to costume).  If  <br/>
their parents had talked to them about how someone dressed up to be  <br/>
the U, they might have had way better lives.<br/>
But &quot;I wanna go but U won&#39;t let me go&quot; is wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
Monsterpiece Theatre&#39;s Hamlet, with Mel Gibson:<br/>
mel gibson hamlet sesame street<br/>
&quot;Forsooth!  Elmo spyeth Hamlet, prince of Denmark, reading a book!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some of my favorite art is there now too:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLPPxSdwJw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eLPPxSdwJw</a>  (Fairy Alphabet--hand-done  <br/>
morphing art and beautiful music)<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Iehgp9s6M">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1Iehgp9s6M</a><br/>
There&#39;s another piece of morphing art about artistic point of view,  <br/>
but I don&#39;t know enough to find it, if it&#39;s out there. a cup turned  <br/>
into a duck, into a bell... kept turning.  Watermelon, stairs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It might be worth cruising the Sesame Street channel on YouTube with  <br/>
one of your kids no matter how old they are.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1866522939">That&#39;s so funny that you talked about Sesame Street.  Today I was showing<br/>
the kids youtube sesame street from Israeli television.  Sesame Street is<br/>
produced in many different languages.  I don&#39;t know how easy it is to learn<br/>
a language by watching TV, but it might help pick up incidental vocabulary<br/>
and definitely accent, rhythms, and intonation.  Has anybody used<br/>
international Sesame Street as a way to learn languages?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is more than you wanted to know ;-) but to understand  <br/>
unschooling, the why is more important than the what.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of kids are picking up Japanese through manga (comics) and anime  <br/>
(cartoons). But the important factor isn&#39;t the materials, it&#39;s the  <br/>
kids. Their desire to learn Japanese is pulling it in and playing  <br/>
with it.<br/>
<br/>
Undoubtedly there&#39;s anecdotal evidence of kids picking up varying  <br/>
degrees of language from a television program (or songs or software  <br/>
or books). But *why* did they? If the program were responsible, all  <br/>
kids would show the same results.<br/>
<br/>
The biggest factor is how much fun they&#39;re having, how engaged they  <br/>
are by something in the show, that will drive them to want to make  <br/>
sense of it. The kids learning Japanese from manga and anime first  <br/>
fell in love with the books and shows in English. That love inspired  <br/>
a desire to know even more about the shows and where they came from.<br/>
<br/>
The second biggest factor are probably intelligence type (eg,  <br/>
Gardner&#39;s multiple intelligences: <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/</a> <br/>
Theory_of_multiple_intelligences) and learning style. Kids drawn to  <br/>
language are more likely to find fun in playing with the foreign  <br/>
language code to break it.<br/>
<br/>
A mom sharing something she enjoys can inspire a joy in kids. But  <br/>
kids can pick up on a mom sharing something she believes will move  <br/>
them from where they are to where she wants them to be.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>My mother-in-law used to watch Sesame Street with her younger children back in the early 70&#39;s when they first emigrated here from Holland. She has always credited the show for her English and I suppose their English too!<br/>
<br/>
Back when I was a kid, Sesame Street was on the CBC here in Canada.  (I don&#39;t know what happened to it... anybody know???) Because we are a bilingual nation, we had both French and English.  I think I learned a lot of words in French from Sesame Street!  To this day, I will watch the French channels if I know we are going to or through Quebec for a trip.  Watching French gameshows help me not only remember vocabulary but also with the accent. <br/>

While we were at IKEA, we spotted a little stuffed toy mouse (&quot;mus&quot; actually) and bought it for Bronnie&#39;s kitten to play with. There was a label on the toy that had written in a number of different languages something like &quot;Contains polyester&quot; (don&#39;t recall exactly). After we came home, the next day I saw Patrick writing a word in some kind of oriental script that I thought might be Chinese over and over onto a sheet of paper. I asked him what it was and he told me it was the Japanese word for &#39;polyester&#39;. He&#39;d copied the characters from the label on the toy mouse onto a piece of paper while we&#39;d been at his sister&#39;s. Did he know what the word sounded like? No. So we looked up some information about the Japanese language on the internet and discovered the word was pronounced &#39;pory-es-tu-ru&#39;. Then Patrick wondered what was the Japanese word for &#39;completed&#39;. Why that word? Anyway, we used an online translator to discover that. Don&#39;t remember right now the pronunciation of the word, but once Patrick had the characters, he fetched the daily newspaper and meticulously copied out the word under the sudoku puzzle that he&#39;d finished earlier. Now he writes it under or next to every sudoku puzzle he completes.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know that Patrick&#39;s actually &quot;learning Japanese&quot; in the usual sense. I&#39;ve seen him writing out other words on pieces of paper, but his interest seems to be more in the &#39;artwork&#39; of Japanese language than in speaking Japanese. I do know he knows &quot;konnichiwa&quot; and &quot;sayonara&quot;. And &quot;kawaii&quot;, which we both have used for years from seeing something on TV to do with Puffy Amiyumi, a trailer for their show I think.<br/>

Anyway, I&#39;m watching with fascination for the time being.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1446829352">When my son was 11 he became fasinated with Japanese.  We picked up an english-Japanese translator book.  The rest of us learned some Japanese phrases just so we could understand what he was saying.  He carried the book in his back pocket for about a year.  He had a lot of fun learning new phrases.  <br/>
