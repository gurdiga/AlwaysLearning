<div id="ygrps-yiv-2145874327">In Florida, if we are registered with the county we live in, we are <br/>
required to have either an approved test, such as SAT, or we can have <br/>
our children evaluated by a certified teacher.<br/>
<br/>
Since this year was my first year off the curriculum I was planning <br/>
to go with the teacher evaluation. My husband is currently working in <br/>
a ps and has met up with a friend he went to high school with. We <br/>
were thinking of asking her.<br/>
<br/>
My oldest daughter &quot;had&quot; a big desire to go to school. So, right <br/>
before Christmas break my husband had a party for his classes. We let <br/>
our daughter go with him for the day. Well.... to say the least... <br/>
she has made it perfectly clear that if we send her to &quot;that place&quot; <br/>
ever she will leave home!<br/>
<br/>
I was thinking of joining one of the umbrella schools with only the <br/>
requirement of attendance. Do any of you have any experience with <br/>
them? What have you found that works well when you are unschooling?<br/>
