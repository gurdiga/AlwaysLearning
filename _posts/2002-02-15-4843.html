<div id="ygrps-yiv-294259710">Here is a link to the website of a friend of mine. He&#39;s a bit of a NUT---but <br/>
he has a cool college class for would-be chemists. This is the first time <br/>
I&#39;ve looked on his site, and I thought he had some neat things to do and find <br/>
out about.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked him to come to the October conference, but he hasn&#39;t yet confirmed <br/>
it with me.<br/>
