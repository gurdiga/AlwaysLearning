I&#39;m sorry it has been a tiring week for you.  To encourage you, it is SO helpful for someone just starting out on my unschooling journey to read those criticisms and then your well written, succinct, kind and respectful responses!  You rock!!<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s interesting how all the ignorant people keep writing about unschooling, something they know nothing about, letting us all know that we are most definitely wrong about it, yet not really bothering at all to read up on it or even try to understand it first.<br/>
<br/>
The really bad article that commented on the really bad journalism, (I know, which one right?) has someone commenting just straight up BS and calling others hypocrital for not following their illogical uninformed reasoning.  I&#39;m tired of discussing unschooling with people who have no idea what they are talking about and aren&#39;t interested in learning more.<br/>
<br/>
This particular response to your interview, Sandra, is the very definition of irony!<br/>

  **********Wow, she is ignorant! I went to public school from preschool through 12th grade and I went to college. I can&#39;t even remember any of the  &quot;great&quot; books I was forced to read, I never took calculus either. If she believes that you have to be told what to learn about then the system worked well in indoctrinating her. Intellectual development happens by thinking and learning IMO, not by being force fed useless garbage.<br/>

  &quot;It&#39;s not that I feel that school is a good idea gone wrong,&quot; he says, &quot;but a wrong idea from the word go. It&#39;s a nutty notion that we can have a place where nothing but learning happens, cut off from the rest of life.&quot;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1024051644">The criticism is irrelevant. I know my objective of nurturing my child in an<br/>
environment of respect and freedom has been supported by my discovery of<br/>
your site, you and this group. Talk is free. It is how it influences lives<br/>
that matters.<br/>
<br/>
One celebration I see in this is that I can see people&#39;s assumptions of a<br/>
lifetime being shaken so that they need to react so strongly. This can&#39;t<br/>
happen unless there is something that makes very strong sense. It is<br/>
graceful, harmonious and narrates a life lived by values many claim but balk<br/>
at living. Something like that shakes our foundations when that isn&#39;t what<br/>
we were doing and we&#39;d like to see ourselves as perfect. Whether they<br/>
devalue the insights that can change their lives to retreat into the safety<br/>
of their known or whether they grab on with both hands and enter a whole new<br/>
way of being is really their business though they are doing it in an<br/>
embarrassingly public way :D<br/>
<br/>
I look at this kind of criticism like I look at a child who accidentally wet<br/>
himself. With empathy, understanding and compassion. It happens, its not<br/>
easy, its embarrassing and scary in public. Its not easy living in a prison<br/>
of unexamined, externally inflicted, powerlessly adopted beliefs. Its not<br/>
easy defending something we have started seeing holes in from something that<br/>
will show our whole attitudes of interacting with someone very precious to<br/>
us as harmful. There is a lot of force used because losing this challenge of<br/>
belief means looking at what they were so proud of as blind harm inflicted<br/>
by T on our loved one. There is a long way to go before getting the humility<br/>
to accept that we are not perfect and we need not be as long as we are<br/>
willing to move with purpose from this moment on. Some never ever get there.<br/>
They irritate, make our life difficult from projecting their fears, but<br/>
those fears don&#39;t belong to me, and I can let them be, knowing that I can<br/>
afford to be kind.<br/>

<br/>
Unfortunately, though, they were talking about MY kids, and so my  <br/>
mothering instinct went not toward them, but my children.<br/>
To me it seemed less like an innocent child had peed his pants and  <br/>
more like a great hairy brute had whipped it out and pissed on my  <br/>
children.  Perhaps that was an over-reaction, but I do have motherly  <br/>
instincts and great kids.<br/>
<br/>
  I understand the frustrations and fears of people who want to  <br/>
unschool, and have helped quite a few of them.  I didn&#39;t count.<br/>
<br/>
I am much less sympathetic to the flailings and vitriol of those who  <br/>
heard of unschooling that same day (perhaps that same moment) and are  <br/>
assuring me that I&#39;m a psychopathic criminal-mom who will be to blame  <br/>
for having unemployed offspring who are a drain on those hardworking  <br/>
high school graduates.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was a great article, Sandra!  I can&#39;t imagine how worn out you must be after this week of intense media attention.  I&#39;m worn out and all I&#39;ve done is read!  The ignorant comments are just that, but they do hurt, and when they are so personal, and about your precious kids, well, that can hurt a whole lot.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to add my voice to those who have been taking the opportunity to repeat, or perhaps say for the first time, the positive effect you, your family, and your writing have had in my life.  You changed my life, Sandra.  You showed me that I have the power to create a joyful life with my children and my husband.  No school/homework/dinner/bed treadmill for us. What a gift.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even wish to think what our lives might have been like if not for your consistent assistance to those of us who want to get it. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m happy to hear there may be a SUSS Two!  It was so nice to see the pictures you posted.  Pearl and I had an experience in Santa Fe that we&#39;ll never forget.  It was such a sweet time for both of us.<br/>

It will need a new name if it&#39;s in Albuquerque instead of Santa Fe,  <br/>
and SUSA seems awkward.  &quot;Suss&quot; is an actual word.   I&#39;ll have to  <br/>
think about it.<br/>

Ditto.<br/>
<br/>
I would add : I&#39;m currently reading your Big Book of Unschooling - I&#39;m so glad you did this work, because it&#39;s easier to read than onscreen (I must say that I read it mainly in the bathroom). This reading has given me a gift that is incredibly precious for a mom of 4 under 10. It has given me ENERGY. Such a positive energy - it is a real blessing. I&#39;m as tired as ever, but it has half the importance it had the week before I ordered your book. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m so grateful to you (and to some others too) - and I bet my kids somehow are, too.<br/>
<br/>
Many, many thanks. Keep on rocking :)<br/>

&quot;There are 55.7 million school-age children in America. Of those almost 60 million, 1.5 million children study from home, and of those nearly 2 million, 150,000 lounge on the couch all day, playing video games and showing passion about very little due to the things they&#39;ve missed from a proper education. &quot;<br/>

Yeesh, I couldn&#39;t help but laugh when I read how she forced herself through mathematics and didn&#39;t give a hoot about history until she found a class she liked.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmmm, she found a class she liked and it interested her.  What a novel concept, hey?<br/>
<br/>
If all of these critics and bandwagon critics would take just a fraction of the time they&#39;re putting into dissing unschooling and spend it instead doing something they&#39;re interested in and enjoy, they could enrich their lives tremendously!<br/>
