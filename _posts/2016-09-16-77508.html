<div id="ygrps-yiv-1357270073">-=-I catch his hand and remind him to be careful. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If a stranger came into your house and attacked your daughter, would you catch his hand and remind him to be careful?  “Careful” doing what?  Taking aim?<br/>
<br/>
Say NO, and mean it.  Don’t waffle.  Don’t recommend.  Don’t give options.  Protect your daughter.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Yesterday, I had to step away for a moment, so I told my daughter I would lock her into her room so she can be safe. My son unlocked the door and ran in to hit her.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Even having a bedroom that can lock from the outside makes the situation feel unhealthy.<br/>
<br/>
-=- had to step away for a moment-=-<br/>
You should have taken the three year old with you.  More time with mom, safer for daughter, not locking anyone up.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Today, I was babysitting a toddler and while changing his dirty diaper, I heard my daughter struggle just a few steps away in the next room. I couldn&#39;t get to them in that moment so she received a bloody scrape. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Keep the three year old with you.  You could talk to him, sing to him, tell him stories while you change someone else’s diaper.<br/>
Keep the three year old with you.  You could have him playing with toys, or playing on an iPad or helping you with something (not the dirty diaper, but something).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I couldn&#39;t get to them in that moment so she received a bloody scrape.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The way you’re describing things shows the way you’re thinking about them (unless you’re purposely and thoughtfully rephrasing, which will show something important too).<br/>
<br/>
-=-I couldn&#39;t get to them in that moment so …-=-<br/>
IF your son is a danger in any moment you’re not there, keep him with you.  Don’t leave dangerous things out.  If he’s a dangerous thing, don’t leave him alone with your daughter.<br/>
I hope you will look at ways to help him not be dangerous.  But back to your odd description:<br/>
<br/>
-=-she received a bloody scrape.-=-<br/>
<br/>
UPS came while you were in the other room?<br/>
A bloody scrape came upon her as a sign from God, like stigmata?<br/>
There was a gift-wrapped bloody scrape that she had failed to remember she had, and she opened it and put it on?<br/>
<br/>
“She received”?<br/>
<br/>
Your son wounded your daughter and drew blood.<br/>
<br/>
Play with these ideas in your own head:  Someone comes in with a gun and later you are shot and bleeding.<br/>
Would you say “the police weren’t able to get to us in that moment, so I received a bloody wound”?<br/>
<br/>
-=-So here is the actual question: How do I behave around and after these incidents? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Wrong question.  WAY wrong question.  The actual question should be “How could I behave so that these incidents will not happen?”<br/>
<br/>
-=- I have reminded my son about 5 million times to be gentle, that getting hurt is not funny.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That’s funny.  Five million?  If it makes you feel better to think you’ve reminded him five million times, why is that?<br/>
After one million, why didn’t you figure out your reminders were not ONLY not stopping the behavior, but that your son was laughing at your attempts?<br/>
<br/>
Let’s assume it wasn’t five million.  (And please try to report honestly, not just to us or others, but to yourself.)<br/>
Let’s assume you have told him 40 times.<br/>
After ten times, why didn’t you figure out it wasn’t working?<br/>
<br/>
Are you suggesting or thinking that your daughter has been hurt five million times?  Forty times?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is he too young? -=-<br/>
Too young to throw a toy and hit her in the head?<br/>
Too young to punch her in the gut?<br/>
<br/>
Are you too young to protect your daughter?<br/>
<br/>
-=-How can I gently guide him?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Somewhere, someone has given you the idea that you-the-mom must be gentle.  <br/>
It’s not working well at all in this case.  Someone on your team is being violent.  Someone else on your team is receiving bloody wounds.<br/>
<br/>
Change your game plan entirely, then.  <br/>
<br/>
Your daughter should be safe in her own home.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When there is evidence of his doing, I have tried showing it to him. &#39;See, your sister go hurt.’ -=-<br/>
<br/>
Evidence other than her having said “He hit me again”?<br/>
<br/>
Above all the other scenario you’ve described, this is false, too:<br/>
<br/>
-=-Since starting radical unschooling some time last year, our home has become fun, light and peaceful. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Is your daughter’s life fun, light and peaceful?<br/>
If your son’s life fun, light and peaceful?<br/>
<br/>
If they are, the story you told us isn’t true, so all you need to do is rethink and rephrase.<br/>
If the stories of the hitting and blood ARE true, then rethink and rephrase whether your home is fun, light and peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
