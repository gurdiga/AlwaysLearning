<div id="ygrps-yiv-537486764">Yesterday was a wonderful, better-write-it-down<br/>
unschooling day.  A lot of it was  a direct<br/>
reaction/response to the conference.  <br/>
<br/>
We had a fairly typical morning....I checked emails<br/>
while the girls watched a show and ate their<br/>
breakfast...they watched the movie The Blue Butterfly.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I ordered the girls pink guitars while they watched<br/>
the movie.  They both want guitars and Eva wants a<br/>
ukulele and a violin, too.  These will probably be for<br/>
a Christmas surprise.  Or maybe not :)<br/>
<br/>
Then we got ready to take our dog, Mayzie, to the<br/>
groomer.  I usually use an independent groomer, but<br/>
wasn&#39;t impressed last time, so we went to Petsmart. <br/>
Petsmart was, as usual, the next best thing to  a zoo.<br/>
 The girls decided they wanted an exotic rat and a<br/>
guinea pig, and the conversation about small animals<br/>
popped up throughout the day.  This was funny because<br/>
they have never even been interested in animals like<br/>
that...only kitties and puppies.  So we are now<br/>
researching small animals and the best pets for little<br/>
hands.<br/>
<br/>
Earlier, I had called around to locate Manga cookies<br/>
(the cookies served in the Manga funshop at the<br/>
conference)...Pocky.  Turns out, our international<br/>
market stocks Pocky!  Yay!  When we got to the market<br/>
(attached to a Korean restaurant), we found Pocky<br/>
stocked in four or five places throughout the store. <br/>
Funny I had never paid attention to it before and it<br/>
was everywhere :)!  We bought strawberry and chocolate<br/>
pocky and a couple other tasties with Japanese<br/>
writing.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the international store, we ended up on a dirt<br/>
road I had never driven on!  We went over an old<br/>
bridge and passed an abandoned rock wall/dilapidated<br/>
building.  We hypothesized about its original purpose<br/>
and decided it would be a perfect photo spot.<br/>
<br/>
We came home for lunch, and Sophia really wanted to<br/>
look up vintage Midge dolls (Barbie&#39;s friend).  She<br/>
likes the 1962 or so versions.  We are looking for the<br/>
perfect doll with the prettiest face on e-bay for less<br/>
than $50.00.  Well, we didn&#39;t find one so we decided<br/>
to add to her growing Littlest Pet Shop collection. <br/>
We&#39;d never seen the seahorses!<br/>
<br/>
Sophia had a playdate with five other homeschool<br/>
girls, and Eva and I picked up Mayzie from Petsmart<br/>
and some great one-on-one time ensued.  It ensued<br/>
while I was laying down feeling that<br/>
morning-sickness-in-the-afternoon feeling.<br/>
<br/>
A huge rain storm hit when we picked up Sophia (turns<br/>
out the mountains are supposed to get snow this<br/>
weekend), and we talked about lightening and thunder<br/>
and distance and how much water our yard got since it<br/>
was also an irrigation day. We talked about rhythm and<br/>
seasons and how we need a word for the<br/>
in-between-seasons.  We talked about Benjamin Franklin<br/>
and grounding and other great inventions.  We talked<br/>
about when he died and how old he&#39;d be. I also stopped<br/>
to look at a house for sale and we talked about house<br/>
prices, neighborhoods, and our ideal place to live.<br/>
<br/>
When my husband got home, we went to our favorite<br/>
Indian restaurant which happens to also be a gas<br/>
station.  Guess what they had?  Henna for $2.50!  So<br/>
we bought Henna.  Today we&#39;re going to a really great<br/>
store here called Earthly Awakenings to buy an<br/>
applicator.  <br/>
<br/>
This reminds me, somewhere in there we bought the<br/>
Klutz hair color kit.  The girls really wanted colored<br/>
hair after the conference :)  I thought that would be<br/>
a good place for *me* to begin!<br/>
<br/>
When we got home, we watched Alice in Wonderland....at<br/>
the end is some black and white footage of non-cartoon<br/>
&quot;Alice&quot; and crew.  We looked Alice up on the Internet<br/>
to figure out her age and how old Walt Disney would be<br/>
now.  And how old Midge is in relation to those two :)<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Sophia is our late-nighter, so after Eva and I read a<br/>
whole bunch of books and we were nearly asleep, Sophia<br/>
walks in with Pocky in one hand and a new Manga comic<br/>
book she invented...all done in Pink!  She explained<br/>
every picture which included an angel/devil character<br/>
and a bully boy, and many plot lines!<br/>
<br/>
Today we&#39;re invited to the university&#39;s bug lab.  It<br/>
is right by the french fry sculpture which is pretty<br/>
close to our campus&#39;s famous ice-cream which is pretty<br/>
close to my favorite homemade bread shop which is<br/>
right off the bus stop which is all within walking<br/>
distance of my mom&#39;s office.  <br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow is our community&#39;s parade and event called<br/>
Apple Days with games and child-sized trains and meals<br/>
and booths and tons of candy!  They also do this weird<br/>
thing where they blast candy from a cannon and the<br/>
kids go nuts.  I imagine we&#39;ll be freshly henna-ed and<br/>
ready for the world!<br/>
<br/>
Life is good.<br/>

P.S. Every time I write a day-in-the-life account, I<br/>
wish I could add all the other interesting things we<br/>
talked about, the hugs we exchanged, the &quot;I love you&quot;<br/>
sign language, the shared sister moments, the tomatoes<br/>
from the garden, the apples from the tree, etc.  I so<br/>
do not subscribe to Hemingway&#39;s Iceberg Theory when<br/>
talking about unschooling.<br/>
