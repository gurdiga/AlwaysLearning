been on those lists in a long time).  Good to see you here.  <br/>
<br/>
I thought about you a lot for a time there after 9/11, and then Kay <br/>
Brooks sent me your update.  Good to know everything is going okay. <br/>
 Welcome to the list!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-560647467">Hi Tuck,<br/>
Glad to hear from you -- it&#39;s a small world out there:)<br/>
Thanks for thinking about us. Things actually were probably calmer here<br/>
than for you all last September. My excitment was that I flew to England on<br/>
the morning of Sept. 11 so it was a bit scary.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-846310487">Yes, there are some honking big mosquitoes up in AK. But we have them here <br/>
too...plus snakes, no-see-ums, jellyfish and sharks!! Ah, the price you pay <br/>
for living in paradise.<br/>
AK over all has no poisonus type things and mosquitoes are only bad out in <br/>
the woods...and they are amazing out there. SWARMS that are likely to fly off <br/>
with you.<br/>
I didn&#39;t think I was going to survive a rock climb once, and it had nothing <br/>
to do with the climb!!<br/>
<br/>
I took the quiz on your best places to live and guess what? It rated <br/>
Columbia, SC as one of my spots! Wow, now I&#39;m really excited about the <br/>
conference.<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say welcome Kate-on-the-other-side-of-the-world. Good to have <br/>
you here. <br/>
