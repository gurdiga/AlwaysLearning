<div id="ygrps-yiv-1748085381">I&#39;m sure several of you have been invited on the side to another  <br/>
unschooling list lately.  The purpose of that list seems to be to  <br/>
badmouth me and this list.  We&#39;ve known for quite a while that people  <br/>
were being invited out, but hadn&#39;t made a deal about it.  Now, though,  <br/>
Pam is being called a bitch over there.  And I&#39;m &quot;fucked up,&quot; says  <br/>
someone on that list.   This was given as evidence that Always  <br/>
Learning isn&#39;t a very nice list.  Yeah... ironic.  And I have heard  <br/>
repeatedly that they don&#39;t discuss unschooling there much, just how  <br/>
much they hate other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s a recent quote about this list, addressed to someone who had  <br/>
left to go and complain there:<br/>
<br/>
-=-At some point, you have to either accept that you&#39;re deciding to  <br/>
live with an abuser and not be surprised anymore when he hits or  <br/>
you&#39;re gunna have to leave. Again, I do not think you ever should have  <br/>
to put up with that sort of treatment - they are assholes and your son  <br/>
is likely not at all an angry kid. But out of the empathy that I do  <br/>
have for you and your situation, I implore you to run, run away, run  <br/>
away fast from all abusive people and especially from abusive groups  <br/>
because they never ever ever ever ever ever change. Really. -=-<br/>
<br/>
They (either all of us, or me and Pam?) are assholes.<br/>
And her son (whom none of them has met) is likely not an angry kid.   <br/>
The mother pretty clearly told us he was angry.<br/>
<br/>
-= I am so mad at that bitch right now and of course sandra won&#39;t let  <br/>
the post go through so i can&#39;t defend myself!!-=-<br/>
<br/>
The post I didn&#39;t let go through was talking about her son spitting in  <br/>
her food.  I wanted her to take time to try some of the suggestions  <br/>
that had made, rather than her filling the already- stressed list with  <br/>
more details of how unhappy things are at their house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s funny...sd emailed me saying she was copying(cc)my email to  <br/>
her 2best moderators but she doubted they would advise me.<br/>
so what was the point of her giving them a copy? for gossip?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Because the most active moderators are Joyce Fetteroll and Joyce  <br/>
Fetteroll, they had already seen the e-mail.  What I copied them on  <br/>
was my note with the reasons for returning her e-mail.  Not for  <br/>
gossip.  And not so they would advise her.   So they would know that  <br/>
one of the other moderators had returned the note, and why.   I  <br/>
sometimes, but not always, get copies of their rejection notes.  I  <br/>
sometimes, but not always, copy them.<br/>
<br/>
Going to another list and speculating isn&#39;t very honorable.  No one  <br/>
called anyone any names here.  No one used any of that language here.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone who wants to go to a hootin&#39; hollerin&#39; complaint session will  <br/>
probably get an invitation to it.   I like to think most people would  <br/>
rather spend time with their children, or in really looking at things  <br/>
that would make their children&#39;s lives better than investing time in  <br/>
helping others frolic in slanderous nonsense.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this post will be enjoyable to that list for a while, and that  <br/>
they&#39;ll leave Pam alone.  I hope Heather and some others will feel  <br/>
ashamed of their treatment of people who have spent many hours  <br/>
offering them help in the past.  I hope some of the people on that  <br/>
list will see the damage they are doing to their own souls and psyches  <br/>
and integrity by being any part of such a wankfest.  Their children&#39;s  <br/>
lives are not enriched a single bit by their mothers spending time so  <br/>
horribly badmouthing other unschoolers.<br/>

<br/>
And here&#39;s some feedback on this allegedly abusive group:<br/>
<br/>
** This list (Always Learning) is better for helping people get to  <br/>
unschooling than anything else available anywhere else in the world.**<br/>
I absolutely believe this. I&#39;ve only been reading here for a few weeks  <br/>
but it has revolutionized the way I parent in a way that I know  <br/>
therapy could never do - at least not in time for my children to grow  <br/>
up feeling abundantly loved. I was in therapy when my older kids were  <br/>
little, mostly for help with parenting. In the one case I received and  <br/>
followed the worst advice possible re: sleep issues with my son (then  <br/>
6) which has caused to him to be afflicted with deep-seated anxiety  <br/>
about sleeping away from home, even now at 15. The other therapist  <br/>
really helped me to put some of my own childhood traumas into  <br/>
perspective and that did help my parenting somewhat...but not in the  <br/>
all-encompassing way that this list - and Sandra&#39;s & Joyce&#39;s web site  <br/>
- have done. Unschooling is about a paradigm shift. It has taken me  <br/>
over a year (since first being exposed to the &quot;radical&quot; unschooling  <br/>
philosophy) to get to this point of really understanding and embracing  <br/>
that paradigm, but thanks to people like Sandra and Joyce, I&#39;m here.  <br/>
And I feel like I&#39;ve finally connected with my real self. Like I&#39;ve  <br/>
come home. And it is such a relief! :D<br/>

<br/>
Here&#39;s another thing to consider, for those that think they can go and have a bitch/gossip fest and have it not impact themselves... If those folks ever want to attend a conference and meet people who unschool and have been unschooling for a long time, spewing gossipy ugliness won&#39;t help.  The unschooling community may seem large and expansive, but it&#39;s not.  There are connections everywhere, in part because of the internet and email groups and online discussions.<br/>
<br/>
The truly wonderful long time unschoolers online that give out great advice aren&#39;t going to disappear simply because someone else has deemed them to be &quot;bitchy&quot;.  Lots of email groups have started out of reactionary nonsense like that, and they fizzle out.  I&#39;ve been reading and involved in unschooling discussions since my oldest was 5 and about to enter kindy, so almost 11 yrs.  I make it a point to stay where the good advice is, to keep up with what&#39;s out there in the unschooling world.  I can say, without a doubt, this is the best email group out there.  Unschooling basics is pretty good too, and always unschooled is ok, there is a lot of crossover of writers.  There are a few more out there that are decent.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that there is a lot of crossover, tells me, that nothing I write is secret.  What someone says on one list will eventually make the rounds to other lists.  People know people through strings of connections.  It&#39;s how small populations work.  It&#39;s just better all around to not be gossipy, especially in public.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-97127605">Being told you&#39;re wrong from a credible source such as Sandra, Joyce,<br/>
Pam, etc. will probably always be hurtful. I got hit myself. Looking<br/>
back I know it&#39;s because someone really cared how the unschooling was<br/>
going down in my family (and when I say &quot;down&quot; I don&#39;t mean in any<br/>
*good* way).<br/>
<br/>
Luckily (and we recently had a thread about luck) in conjunction with<br/>
a lot of my own stubbornness and thinking a lot on what had been said,<br/>
I didn&#39;t take it all over the place. I still didn&#39;t *get* it. I didn&#39;t<br/>
understand. Luckily I now understand more than I did.<br/>
<br/>
It was a real zinger. And I&#39;m thankful. It was a blessing.<br/>
<br/>
Now don&#39;t everybody hit me with anymore of those. ;) Ya hear?<br/>

<br/>
For me, writing about how unschooling works has helped me understand unschooling better and by understanding better I can DO it better.  I&#39;ve relied on the fact that nothing I write will be left to sit there if it isn&#39;t sound reasoning.  Someone WILL point out a flaw in my thinking, which is a good thing, because it keeps me on my toes and moving forward and continuing in my own understanding of unschooling and parenting.<br/>
<br/>
If I feel defensive, then it&#39;s good for me to examine why I feel that way.  That process of self analyzing has helped me be a better partner in my marriage and a better partner to my kids.  It was a beautiful and unforeseen side effect of writing about unschooling!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I didn&#39;t even tell her she was wrong about anything. I made the <br/>
suggestion that she should be with him every minute, that it seemed like <br/>
he had problems when he was left on his own. Set him up for success by <br/>
not leaving him alone in a room where he might respond by being destructive.<br/>
<br/>
She is on the other list saying that I made an accusation of child <br/>
abuse. I suggested she should try being with him every minute - <br/>
attentively in the same space. I said I knew how very difficult that <br/>
sounded, but I also knew it could be done because of my own sister&#39;s <br/>
experience with doing it with her daughter. Then I explained WHY my <br/>
sister had done that with her daughter, just because I thought people <br/>
would wonder. Heather described, this time, a problem with Lucas being <br/>
purposely destructive of things. I was simply saying that what I was <br/>
suggesting might sound extreme, but that I&#39;d seen it carried out <br/>
successfully in my own extended family. For that bit of very personal <br/>
disclosure for the sake of credibility, I get called a bitch and worse <br/>
and people are over there on that list saying how horrid I am for making <br/>
such a terrible accusation.<br/>
<br/>
It is really discouraging to read the things people on that list are <br/>
saying - not so much because some of it is about me, but because it is <br/>
so extremely high school &quot;mean girls&quot; stuff, and it is so sad that <br/>
unschooling moms are doing it.<br/>
