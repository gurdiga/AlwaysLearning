<div id="ygrps-yiv-1957776289">I was looking for a quote to use in a presentation I&#39;m giving this weekend in Sacramento.  I came across this, which I should probably edit toward parents and unschoolers, but it has some good ideas even as it is.   <br/>

This was written in 1998 for a small group of young adults from 21 to 34 years old, in the context of a medieval studies group in which they were extremely involved (the Society for Creative Anachronism) so if you can overlook the medievalesque names and references, it might have some useful ideas for anyone still struggling with being more positive in and about life.<br/>
