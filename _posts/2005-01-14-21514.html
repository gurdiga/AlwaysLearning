<div id="ygrps-yiv-1836254015">I wrote this for a small e-mail loop I&#39;ve been on for many years, but after  <br/>
I wrote it I thought it might be worth sharing with AlwaysLearning.  I  really <br/>
like this group.  Thanks, all of you who have made it a good place  to be.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
======================================================<br/>
 <br/>
So, one of our original exchange-deals was to note children&#39;s birthdays  with <br/>
tales of their births, I think.<br/>
 <br/>
It was a dark and rainy night...  <br/>
No, not rainy.  And not always night.<br/>
January 12, 1989, 40 hours of labor started.  I didn&#39;t know *That* was  what <br/>
was starting, or I wouldn&#39;t have been so happy.<br/>
 <br/>
 <br/>
But Marty is fine, and had a party last night that Kirby conceived and  <br/>
organized [since Kirby and several of the friends won&#39;t be available tonight,  and <br/>
their midnight movie plan fell through as there was no midnight showing of  <br/>
Elektra (sp? name?)].  Kirby went to the best cake shop in town to get him  a <br/>
cake.  It said &quot;Marty Sucks,&quot; and had beautiful blue roses all  around.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty&#39;s sitting right here, playing Halo II with eight guys, one of whom he  <br/>
knows. Having a good time.<br/>
 <br/>
I really like Marty.  He&#39;s wonderful.<br/>
And last night Kirby didn&#39;t suck. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
 <br/>

I shared that with Will.  He stopped plucking his electric guitar and  <br/>
laughed right out loud.<br/>
 <br/>
I have pictures of Marty on the whale watch boat, if you want to see  them.<br/>
 <br/>
Marty had a marshmallow fight in the hallway of the hotel with my  MOTHER!  I <br/>
sometimes still can&#39;t believe it.  Bless his heart.<br/>

Well did she want to or was she cruelly ambushed by a crazed  Marty-Dodd?<br/>

There was a great comeback involved, too. When Kirby presented the lit  cake, <br/>
he said, &quot;I&#39;ve been saying you suck for years, and you just wiped it  off <br/>
like butter, but now your 16th birthday cake says you suck.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
Marty said &quot;And I can wipe that off with a napkin.&quot;<br/>
 <br/>
It really was pretty funny, and not offensive, and it was very cool.<br/>
 <br/>
Kirby said the girl at the cake shop had fun doing it too.  He assured  her <br/>
it was for his brother who would appreciate it.<br/>

I think it made her whole trip!  I&#39;ve already thanked him.   :)<br/>
