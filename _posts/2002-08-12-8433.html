<div id="ygrps-yiv-611168482">I&#39;m glad to see this because I&#39;ve asked similar things and people have kinda <br/>
snorted and said &quot;that&#39;s dumb.&quot;<br/>
There are other mammals who don&#39;t drink water, and in the middle ages people <br/>
didn&#39;t drink water.  Of course now they&#39;re dead...<br/>

No need to guzzle all that water, expert says<br/>
<br/>
By Maggie Fox<br/>
<br/>
WASHINGTON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Trying to do the &quot;right&quot; thing by drinking <br/>
eight full glasses of water a day may do little more than make a person run <br/>
to the bathroom, a researcher said on Friday.<br/>
<br/>
Newspaper articles, health and beauty magazines all advise drinking at least <br/>
8 full glasses of water a day totalling 64 ounces (two litres) for optimal <br/>
health -- an approach called &quot;8x8&quot; by proponents.<br/>
<br/>
But Dr. Heinz Valtin of Dartmouth Medical School in New Hampshire said there <br/>
is no scientific evidence to back up this advice, which has helped create a <br/>
huge market for bottled water.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;After 10 months of careful searching I have found no scientific evidence <br/>
that supports &#39;8x8&#39;,&quot; Valtin, who has written textbooks on the subject of <br/>
human water balance, said in a telephone interview.<br/>
<br/>
Writing in the American Journal of Physiology, Valtin, a kidney specialist, <br/>
said people forget that the food they eat also contains some water.<br/>
<br/>
The Food and Nutrition Board of the National Research Council has recommended <br/>
that people take in about one milliliter of water for each calorie of food <br/>
eaten.<br/>
<br/>
This adds up to two liters, or 74 fluid ounces on an average 2,000-calorie <br/>
diet. But the National Research Council also noted that much of this is <br/>
already contained in food.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I did 43 years of research on that system -- the osmoregulatory system. That <br/>
system is so precise and so fast ting the loss of water through the skin, <br/>
Valtin said. Thirst kicks in long before dehydration starts, he added.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It does it very quickly and very accurately and it does so in minutes,&quot; <br/>
Valtin said.<br/>
<br/>
He said he and colleagues became concerned after seeing dozens of newspaper <br/>
and magazine articles urging people to sip water all day. &quot;I started talking <br/>
to my colleagues and asking them &#39;Do you know of any evidence for this?&#39;. <br/>
Invariably, they said, &#39;No I think it&#39;s a myth&#39;,&quot; Valtin said.<br/>
<br/>
The journal asked him to review all the scientific studies he could find and <br/>
he concluded that someone misinformed has been telling people to drink large <br/>
amounts of water when most do not need to.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I am referring to healthy adults in a temperate climate leading a largely <br/>
sedentary existence,&quot; Valtin said. &quot;Persons with certain diseases must have <br/>
large volumes of water -- kidney stones are probably the most common example.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The rest can just drink enough to slake thirst -- and this includes coffee, <br/>
tea, and even beer -- despite their diuretic effects, Valtin said.<br/>
<br/>
He hopes people will be relieved of the guilt of not getting enough water, <br/>
and of the expense of buying bottled water to drink throughout the day.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;There is also the possibility that if you drink a lot of water that happens <br/>
to be polluted then of course you get more pollutants,&quot; Valtin said.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then there is the inconvenience of constant urination, the embarrassment of <br/>
having to go to the bathroom all the time,&quot; he added.<br/>
<br/>
And overdoses of water can cause water intoxication that can lead to <br/>
confusion and even death. Water intoxication is one deadly effect of taking <br/>
the drug Ecstasy, for instance, because it makes people thirsty beyond their <br/>
physical needs.</div>

that a chronic over-doing of the water or a binge<br/>

it flush out all of the electrolytes and THAT is the<br/>
problem (I have cautioned some dieters about that,<br/>

<br/>
No over-water consumption problems here :-) <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-984903392">Death can occur from hyponatremia (low salt) due to medullary washout in the<br/>
kidneys, or pulmonary edema, and even cerebral edema. Psychogenic polydipsia<br/>
is another condition where people drink way more than they need to and can<br/>
have problems.<br/>
<br/>
You occasionally see water intoxication in animals as well, with open access<br/>
to water after being deprived, or with certain hormonal conditions.<br/>
