<div id="ygrps-yiv-106715353">Hi -- I am a widowed unschooling mom of two teen-aged boys.  My eldest<br/>
will turn 18 in February and Social Security has notified us that his<br/>
SSA survivor benefits will end in January unless he returns a form<br/>
signed by a school official that he is a full-time student. We have<br/>
been planning for his &quot;launch&quot; into the world of work and<br/>
post-secondary education in June, as he still has a few skills to<br/>
master before then(like driving.)<br/>
<br/>
The SSA form has a box to check for homeschooling, so do I check that<br/>
box and sign as the &quot;school official&quot; and send it back to SSA? <br/>
<br/>
Has anyone had any experience with this? <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I would think that it makes a difference what State you are in as to whether <br/>
you would check the homeschooling box. For example the education statutes in <br/>
California do not have any mention of &quot;home schooling&quot; per se, but a number <br/>
of strategies that are employed by home schoolers to be doing so legally. <br/>
Therefore if it were me in CA, I would not check &quot;homeschooling&quot;, but my <br/>
legal option of &quot;full time private school &quot; (until such time as the college <br/>
enrollment is official).<br/>
<br/>
Have you checked with your local list or perused www.nhen.org ?<br/>
