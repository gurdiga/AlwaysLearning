Unfortunately, I&#39;m still waiting for the EU laws about stuff sold in the EU<br/>
being labelled in all 12 or whatever EU languages to kick in on games.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The packaging ought to be very interesting.  We have English and French on <br/>
everything in Canada, and the print gets so small sometimes that I can&#39;t <br/>
read it even with glasses.  I can&#39;t imagine having everything 12 times.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It&#39;s interesting, on the things that have it.  It takes the entire back of a<br/>
box for a space heater, for example, to tell you what it is and what it<br/>
does.  Tim always looks for the Greek and other languages that don&#39;t use our<br/>
alphabet.  <br/>
<br/>
What always makes me laugh is clothing tags.  They&#39;ve reduced the &quot;machine<br/>
wash warm, tumble dry low, cool iron&quot; stuff to just symbols, but<br/>
manufacturers still mark sizes and fabric type in every language.  I just<br/>
bought a sweator.  It had two tags, each about 2 inches long, to tell me<br/>
that it was XL and made of cotton in at least 7 lanaguage.  And I used to<br/>
think American tags itched.  These were ridiculous.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Brenda, I had to laugh when I read your post.  I live overseas as <br/>
well and the tag length has really gotten ridiculous.  We just cut <br/>
them all out! LOL <br/>
<br/>
As for games, sometimes I buy games and make up rules for it by <br/>
looking at the front picture, if there are no rules in a language I <br/>
can figure out. and yes, it *does* the entire back of the box to <br/>
explain what it is! Lots of products are like that here in Prague LOL <br/>
You should see the back of the shampoo bottles!<br/>
