<div id="ygrps-yiv-2116924429">The other day I quoted from my book worship page on my daily Just Add Light and Stir blog.  Someone linked it on facebook, and a tussle ensued over someone bragging that she had never watched an entire movie, nor a youtube video, but only liked to read books.  I suggested someone who came to such a discussion claiming never to have finished a single book might not be qualified to discuss comparisons, and so I got jumped. :-)   Didn&#39;t get hurt.<br/>
<br/>
Today this popped up, totally unrelated to that other discussion, and it&#39;s interesting.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://psychcentral.com/news/2011/04/25/reading-fulfills-need-for-belonging/25610.html">http://psychcentral.com/news/2011/04/25/reading-fulfills-need-for-belonging/25610.html</a><br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a brief article on a site called psychcentral.com that says when people read and they identify with the characters, it fulfills the need for association.  (They didn&#39;t use that word; I am.)<br/>
==================<br/>
If you ask someone why they read, the response is usually to learn, or as an escape from the everyday routine of life. New research finds reading does much more than �merely� educate or entertain.<br/>
Psychologist Dr. Shira Gabriel studied how reading appears to foster a human connection � that is, as we read we become a part of the community described in the narrative � even when the text is set in a fictional fantasy land. This connection appears to satisfy the deeply human, and evolutionarily crucial, need for belonging.<br/>
<br/>
....<br/>
<br/>
 �[B]belonging� to these fictional communities delivered the same mood and life satisfaction people get from affiliation with real-life groups.<br/>
<br/>
According to the researchers, the study shows that reading is not just for escape or education, but helps to fulfill a deep psychological need.<br/>
<br/>
==================<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the beginning and the end of it.  It&#39;s not long in between.<br/>
<br/>
So escape.  No problem for me.  But imaginary friends?  Yeah, I&#39;ve wished I was really in a book.  Is that super healthy?  Not too bad, but I&#39;m even less interested now in having book-focussed people tell me that a child who&#39;s watching a movie with real-life friends would be better off reading a book full of imaginary friends.   <br/>
<br/>
The good news is people can do both. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve created a new page for some writing Frank Maier did, and will add to it about people watching things twice.   It opens with sound, so if others are asleep, turn your volume down.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-385021981">And it&#39;s not just in fiction that one can find &quot;friends.&quot;  This post has helped me understand my MIL a little bit better.  She is very print-centric. When she reads author&#39;s books, I have the distinct feeling she is becoming a peer of theirs.  She also has stacks of New Yorkers, Science Journals, Review of Books, Nation Geographics, Saveurs... she is hard pressed to let them go.  Now I see it&#39;s a bit like having all these people hanging out in her house.  A quiet, one-sided cocktail party, if you will.  Sure, they&#39;re all writing non-fiction, but it&#39;s escape on some level, nonetheless.  -which is not to say its bad!  Just good to notice.  Open the flow...<br/>
<br/>
... and here&#39;s something else:  she, my 8 yo daughter, and I have been watching Lark Rise to Candleford together - !  Talk about sharing a group of friends!  MIL keeps mentioning how we&#39;re passing on our anglophile heritage to my daughter...<br/>

<br/>
I should read your blog more often. :-)<br/>
I&#39;ve watched Downton Abbey on Amazon.   (Maybe they have Lark Rise to Candleford, too.)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be near London on the 14th and Edinburgh on the 19th, so I&#39;m about to get my Anglophile fix for a while.  The photos in Just Add Light and Stir will turn from adobe and trucks in New Mexico to architectural and cultural details of the UK for a while.  Some of the readers of Always Learning will be hanging out with me a while &quot;on the other side.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
For anyone not in that neighborhood who might want to follow my giddy adventures (or jetlagged disorganization), I&#39;m keeping a blog here:  <br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandraeurope2011.blogspot.com/">http://sandraeurope2011.blogspot.com/</a><br/>
and it can be subscribed to directly there (upper right).<br/>
<br/>
It looks like now that my kids are grown that I keep ditching my family and travelling, but honest--I invited them, and their lives are too fun and full for them to want to leave.  That&#39;s pretty cool, but does make me look a little like Mayzie the lazy bird.  To me, anyway.  Except my kids have been past the egg-stage for 20 years and more.<br/>
<br/>
So where was I?  Anglophilia.  I love English stuff.<br/>

Its as if there is no other way to learn but through books.  The <br/>
suggestions you get for the different types of learners are often book <br/>
centric.  If visual - they read the book; if kinesthetic - they do <br/>
something while you read the book; if audio - they listen to the book on <br/>
tape; etc.  I have read classics that were a waste of time and have even <br/>
found worthwhile books written in the last ten years. ;-)  We love books <br/>
here, even our toddlers will choose a book over a toy to take to bed <br/>
with them, but there are many other things we do too.<br/>

At least you&#39;ve meet some who learn through classic books. That&#39;s good!<br/>
Some seem to set the curricular materials up that way. When they ask whether unschoolers use books, they mean a math book, and English book, a science book and a math book.<br/>
<br/>
In the old days when homeschoolers hung out together online in a few small places, some structured homeschoolers would disavow structure, and proudly brag that they were liberal homeschoolers, or eclectic, or progressive, because they didn&#39;t mind if their kids sat on the couch to do their work, or on the swing outside, just as long as they did their work somewhere, sometime.<br/>

Yeah I really liked this one. The amount of language skills that Ishaan my 5<br/>
year-old son has picked up just watching movies is amazing. His favourite<br/>
film these days is &#39;Day After Tomorrow&quot; and he has gathered more knowledge<br/>
about global warming and the fragile ecology of the planet by just asking me<br/>
questions with ref to the film...<br/>
<br/>
What I see kids cramming through books he has picked up within a week.<br/>
<br/>
The kids like watching Barbie movies too. They both watch Babie and a<br/>
Fashion Fairy Tale over and over again. Ishaan for Eiffel Tower and French<br/>
and Gourika for Fashion. In the end they both dance to the cat walk music!<br/>
<br/>
Recently a friend of mine from Belgium has been visiting us often and Ishaan<br/>
asks her words in French. They both now know that in Belgium also French is<br/>
spoken. Plus Muriel (my friend) and Ishaan have formed this incredible<br/>
bond!!!<br/>
<br/>
I am not undermining books here, but I do not want to put lesser value on<br/>
other media as well.<br/>
<br/>
The other day we were watching &#39;Princess and the Frog&#39; and we talked of how<br/>
Jazz came from New Orleans. The movie had such wonderful Jazz in it....<br/>
<br/>
Then a few days later I was doing some research for an article that I had to<br/>
write on unschooling in India and I found out that Louise Armstrong did not<br/>
go to school. I was so excited I shared this with the children..How cool is<br/>
that???<br/>
<br/>
Which book would have all this info in together? I was wondering?...The dots<br/>
connect when we are able to value each form of media as a learning<br/>
potential....<br/>

<br/>
You&#39;re right--and IF someone writes about connections in a book, he or she always has to stop somewhere, and those who read it will add their own.   I read a book called Vermeer&#39;s Hat, by Timothy Brook.  He goes into detail about Vermeer&#39;s paintings, and what the maps and objects were and where they would have come from on those days. There&#39;s quite a bit about trading outposts in China, and the Dutch East India company, and what kind of money was flowing where in the 1700s, and where those coins were made, and where the silver came from and...  all kinds of connections.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1750497543">-=-You have to watch &#39;Lost in Austen&#39;.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I listened to the book.  Didn&#39;t know there was a video version!<br/>
<br/>
I love this world, and all this quick exchange of information.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been a guest speaker for a graduate seminar at Arizona State University twice this semester, by Skype.  This morning I answered some questions from some of the students in that group, all of whom are working on masters&#39; degrees or PhDs in education.  One was about the internet.<br/>
<br/>
---------<br/>
<br/>
-=-What do you think of free/Sudbury schools, and do you think they make it possible for children to unschool �at school�?-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s still school, but it&#39;s an interesting alternative school.  <br/>
I don&#39;t think there can be &quot;unschooling at school.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
An alternative program in the Albuquerque Public Schools that&#39;s 20 years old now, called The Family School, started off billing itself as &quot;half-time homeschool,&quot; but within two years they were telling people exactly what to do with that other half a day, and having mandatory weekly meetings of all parents, and missing a meeting could lose your spot to another family.   That wasn&#39;t any kind of homeschooling.  The school was controlling and dictating to the whole family, and not just the kids.   (And they were fully double-dipping, as the kids were there either through lunch, or before lunch to the end of the day, so they got full funding for two batches of kids.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-Also:  How do you see unschooling changing in today�s internet generation, if at all?  How do you feel about the contributions that technology has made/can make to unschooling, apart from the obvious (to us) learning benefits of videogaming?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Google.  YouTube.  Kahn Academy.<br/>
Just yesterday I watched two videos on installing a ceramic soap dish.  My kids will never feel they need to take a course in tile laying, for example.  Holly&#39;s learning guitar, and she looks at videos.  There&#39;s an online guitar tuning site (more than one), and chord sites, and sites for transcribing songs to other keys.   Marty plays drums, and there are how-to videos, and reviews of equipment.<br/>
<br/>
-=-How do you see the SCA in relation to unschooling (one student was involved in the SCA in college, and is considering getting involved again, this time with kids)?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Our middle child, Marty, is still involved in the SCA, as is my husband.  Marty won a mask contest by making a documentable cow mask of leather, with knotwork his sister did.  They learned these things in the SCA.  He knew to check the Viking Answer Lady site, because he and his dad/Keith do Norse personas. And there are people who have learned knotwork because of Holly and Keith teaching it at an unschooling conference once, and they learned it in the SCA.<br/>

Another benefit from the SCA is the friends they&#39;ve had, of all ages, who have interesting knowledge and hobbies.  Marty&#39;s first job was making boots with a man who had been his dad&#39;s squire, who now lives in our old house.<br/>

He was offered the job because he had shown himself to be interested and reliable, and because he was available and willing to work.  So the unschooling and the SCA have fed back and forth over the years.  <br/>
<br/>
The whats and whys of what people wear, do, make, sing, and eat around the SCA are learning experiences of more than just history and geography.  Lots of interpersonals and practical crafts and engineering skills.  Setting up elaborate camps of cloth and rope, for instance, is something Marty will be able to do for the rest of his life, if he wants to. :-)  He had helped many people set such camps up in all sorts of conditions.  <br/>
<br/>
Armored combat has been one of Marty&#39;s main sports and physical activities for the past seven years.  (Before that it was roller-blading and boffer fighting.)<br/>

I don&#39;t mind answering questions like these!  They can send more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Me too! Last night, inspired by this discussion and a similar one taking<br/>
place in the comments of my blog, I posted about BBC (and other) costume<br/>
dramas I have loved, and others that have been recommended to me.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://melissawiley.com/blog/2011/04/26/bbc-me/">http://melissawiley.com/blog/2011/04/26/bbc-me/</a>   People have been chiming<br/>
in all morning with more suggestions.<br/>
<br/>
I even mentioned Lost in Austen! I was talking about a BBC TV movie version<br/>
of The Railway Children, which I loved, and the young actress who played<br/>
Bobbie, the main character, in that movie in 2000 is the lead in Lost in<br/>
Austen. So it was fun to come here this morning and read Sarah&#39;s suggestion.<br/>
<br/>
The internet is perfectly amazing. This morning my 10yo asked me what kinds<br/>
of video games I played as a kid. I told her about our Atari console. I was<br/>
trying to describe the Adventure game I loved so much and it occurred to me<br/>
that there were probably videos on YouTube, so we checked, and there were.<br/>
Then we looked at demos of Pitfall, Donkey Kong, Pac Man, and Space<br/>
Invaders---all in those primitive graphics I remember. They were so exciting<br/>
at the time! And today, in a different way. The sound effects stirred up so<br/>
many memories. I remember figuring out how to win Adventure before my<br/>
friend&#39;s older brothers did, and they were cheering me on. I was little and<br/>
scrawny and terrible at sports, so that was a big moment for me--impressing<br/>
older kids in a *game*.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s incredibly cool to be able to show my kids, within seconds, the games I<br/>
played as a kid. A few minutes later, we were watching the (rather amazing)<br/>
mating dance of the Australian peacock spider.<br/>
<br/>
I love living now. :)<br/>
