<div id="ygrps-yiv-195967779">Hi there,<br/>
<br/>
I found myself having to go back to work full time about a year ago and I am really struggling with our lifestyle now as far as how to proceed with unschooling vs schooling. Do you have any suggestions, articles etc. you can point me toward to help. My children are old enough (15-9) to stay home for a few hours by themselves before their dad gets home so i&#39;m not worried so much about safety as much as concern that their is too much time spent without an adult around. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you.</div>

parent involvement but it can be done any time of the day.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I think your kids are the ones to ask. How do they feel  <br/>
about it? How open do they feel about bringing up problems to you if  <br/>
after a month they find there are issues.<br/>
<br/>
While they may be &quot;old enough&quot; to stay home alone, if their  <br/>
personalities crave a lot of interaction with you it may not be a  <br/>
great solution if they&#39;re going to be awake when you&#39;re gone.<br/>
