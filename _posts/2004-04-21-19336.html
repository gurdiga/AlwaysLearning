&gt; I got this in the mail from my father-in-law. My responses follow. He sure<br/>
&gt; knows hoe to piss off a daughter-in-law!<br/>

&gt; Paul Harvey Writes:<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them<br/>
worse.<br/>
&gt; For my grandchildren, I&#39;d like better.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It doesn&#39;t sound like it. It sounds as if you are 100% sadist.<br/>
&gt; I&#39;d really like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade<br/>
ice<br/>
&gt; cream and leftover meat loaf sandwiches. I really would.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With two &quot;only children&quot;, eight years apart, there just aren&#39;t any<br/>
&gt; &quot;hand-me-downs.&quot;<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t cook meatloaf, so there is never left-over meatloaf for<br/>
sandwiches.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you learn humility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty<br/>
by<br/>
&gt; being cheated.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Sad. And mean.<br/>
&gt; I hope my children learn humility by witnessing humility. And honesty by<br/>
&gt; being treated honestly.<br/>
&gt; I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m guessing they&#39;ll learn all three of these things when they are ready<br/>
to.<br/>
&gt; But none of them is a requirement for a happy life.<br/>
&gt; A down comforters is a great alternative for &quot;American&quot; bed-making.<br/>
&gt; The less lawn, the better.<br/>
&gt; Bikes are practical and require no petrol.<br/>
&gt; And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixteen.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; One child already has one----but at FIFteen. He&#39;s grateful for and<br/>
generous<br/>
&gt; with it. The second one will probably also get one.<br/>
&gt; It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your old<br/>
&gt; dog put to sleep.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both have happened already. But having a bitch deliver puppies just for<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; experience is NOT a good idea----for the bitch, the puppies, or the child.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What a horrible thought. You can fight for many things without punching<br/>
&gt; someone in the eye for it.<br/>
&gt; I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother/sister. And<br/>
it&#39;s<br/>
&gt; all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when<br/>
he<br/>
&gt; wants to crawl under the covers with you because he&#39;s scared, I hope you<br/>
let<br/>
&gt; him.<br/>
&gt; Sharing shouldn&#39;t be about &quot;drawing lines&quot;-----it should be about sharing.<br/>
&gt; Compassion comes from witnessing compassion. I doubt YOUR children are<br/>
&gt; compassionate!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I hope you have to walk uphill to school with your friends and that you<br/>
live<br/>
&gt; in a town where you can do it safely.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Mine will never go to school. Even if a child were to make it safely to<br/>
&gt; school---up hill---he is still not safe IN school.<br/>
&gt; On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I hope you don&#39;t ask your<br/>
driver<br/>
&gt; to drop you two blocks away so you won&#39;t be seen riding with someone as<br/>
&gt; uncool as your Mom.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Odd. I&#39;m considered pretty cool by both children----as well as by their<br/>
&gt; friends. And I get hugs in public all the time.<br/>
&gt; And why would rain keep someone from walking?<br/>
&gt; If you want a slingshot, I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one<br/>
instead<br/>
&gt; of buying one.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Both are acceptable sling-shots. How many have you made?<br/>
&gt; I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Is there a method for digging in the dirt we all must learn? Surrounded by<br/>
&gt; dirt and books, digging and reading happen naturally.<br/>
&gt; When you learn to use computers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; your head.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Surrounded by numbers.....adding and subtracting happens naturally.<br/>
Computers<br/>
&gt; don&#39;t even enter in to it.<br/>
&gt; I hope you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a<br/>
&gt; boy&#92;girl, and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory<br/>
soap<br/>
&gt; tastes like.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Friends who will tease you for loving someone aren&#39;t friends. And a mother<br/>
&gt; who will impose such a punishment is only worthy of being talked back to!<br/>
&gt; Both of these wishes are down-right despicable! What horrible things to<br/>
wish<br/>
&gt; on a child! Maybe you should have YOUR mouth washed out with soap!<br/>
&gt; May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a stove and<br/>
&gt; stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Again!  Despicable! Purposefully wishing pain upon a child? What kind of<br/>
&gt; man/father are you?<br/>
&gt; I don&#39;t care if you try a beer once, but I hope you don&#39;t like it. And if<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; friend offers you dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your<br/>
friend.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; What makes beer so offensive? &quot;Try it, but I hope you don&#39;t like it?&quot; What<br/>
&gt; kind of wish is that? I guess you don&#39;t drink? Both my boys drink wine and<br/>
beer.<br/>
&gt; Neither care for hard liquor. Personal tastes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And I had many friends who offered me joints. I&#39;ve never smoked. But they<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; still my friends. Who are YOU to judge my friends?<br/>
&gt; I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandma/Grandpa and<br/>
go<br/>
&gt; fishing with your Uncle.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Not if these are his wishes for his grandchildren! I&#39;d rather my children<br/>
&gt; stay far, far away from you!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Funerals are barbaric. And holidays filled with people who believe this<br/>
crap<br/>
&gt; cannot possibly be filled with joy.<br/>
&gt; I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your<br/>
&gt; neighbor&#39;s window and that she hugs you and kisses you at<br/>
Hanukah/Christmas time<br/>
&gt; when you give her a plaster mold of your hand.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would hope that I would understand that it was an ACCIDENT and help my<br/>
&gt; child find a way to make restitution----just as I would if it happened to<br/>
my<br/>
&gt; husband or to a friend. And I will give hugs and kisses for no reason<br/>
what-so-ever<br/>
&gt; other than that he is my son.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; These things I wish for you - tough times and disappointment, hard work<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; happiness. To me, it&#39;s the only way to appreciate life.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The only way to appreciate life is to have one. A good one. Being dealt<br/>
&gt; punishments and unkindness because you are a child is humiliating and<br/>
shameful and<br/>
&gt; should not be tolerated in decent society. A child who is routinely----and<br/>
&gt; purposefully---maltreated as you suggest above will NOT appreciate his<br/>
life, Mr.<br/>
&gt; Harvey.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I&#39;m glad you aren&#39;t my sons&#39; grandfather.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-496141286">This is probably redundant but of course you know this is one of those &quot;send around emails that people forward&quot;<br/>
I thought your responses were well thought out and reflected your own take on things.Your father in law should get a bolt up his butt and have a longer look at stuff before he sends it on.....hopefully?<br/>
Earlier this winter<br/>
I had the same silly thing  forwarded to me from a daughter in law and from her list of recipiants it had  pretty much been  sent on to  most of the parents in our area.( way off in the Canadian Rockies...)<br/>
I sent her a reply that  that pretty much said &quot;I know this doesn&#39;t actually  reflect your view on child raising  and is just a &quot;send on&quot;  but I think it is  a mean and thoughtless way to think of children.&quot;<br/>
She never ever commented but still forwards every bit of drivel that comes her way. and &quot;yes&quot; it does  seem to reflect her viewpoint on some things. -but I am just a &quot;mother-in-law so what do I know&quot; LOL<br/>
And  on the same vein---what is it with all the junk that people send on? I get the damdest things.<br/>
I do send stuff on myself but I try to at least stop and think if that particular person might find it funny or interesting.<br/>
And do all those people Really!! believe the sky will fall on them if they dont &quot;send this on&quot; to 20 of your friends.<br/>
grace<br/>
finally got my income tax done...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-344313317">I&#39;ve read the actual essay and the version your father sent has been edited <br/>
to be rougher.  From the snopes.com site:<br/>
&quot;The<br/>
claim that this essay is &quot;from Paul Harvey&quot; is ambiguous — does it mean he <br/>
wrote the essay, or that he popularized it? It&#39;s unclear which concept the <br/>
writer of the e-mail was trying to communicate, so we&#39;ll answer both questions in <br/>
preference to guessing what was in that person&#39;s mind. <br/>
Paul Harvey certainly didn&#39;t write the essay. The true author of this piece <br/>
is Lee Pitts, and the nostalgic essay was published in his 1995 book People Who <br/>
Live At The End of Dirt Roads and appeared in the 2000 book Chicken Soup for <br/>
the Golden Soul. <br/>
Paul Harvey does use material written by Lee Pitts from time to time, and he <br/>
did read this particular essay (crediting Pitts, of course) during his 6 <br/>
September 1997 broadcast. &quot;<br/>
Here&#39;s the actual essay.  I think it&#39;s better this way, not so vindictive:<br/>
We tried so hard to make things better for our kids that we made them worse. <br/>
For my grandchildren, I’d know better. <br/>
I’d really like for them to know about hand-me-down clothes and home-made ice <br/>
cream and leftover meatloaf. I really would. <br/>
My cherished grandson, I hope you learn humility by surviving failure and <br/>
that you learn to be honest even when no one is looking. <br/>
I hope you learn to make your bed and mow the lawn and wash the car — and I <br/>
hope nobody gives you a brand-new car when you are sixteen. <br/>
It will be good if at least one time you can see a baby calf born, and you <br/>
have a good friend to be with you if you ever have to put your old dog to sleep. <br/>
I hope you get a black eye fighting for something you believe in. <br/>
I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brother. And it is all <br/>
right to draw a line down the middle of the room, but when he wants to crawl <br/>
under the covers with you because he’s scared, I hope you’ll let him. <br/>
And when you want to see a Disney movie and your kid brother wants to tag <br/>
along, I hope you take him. <br/>
I hope you have to walk uphill with your friends and that you live in a town <br/>
where you can do it safely. <br/>
If you want a slingshot, I hope your father teaches you how to make one <br/>
instead of buying one. I hope you learn to dig in the dirt and read books, and when <br/>
you learn to use computers, you also learn how to add and subtract in your <br/>
head. <br/>
I hope you get razzed by friends when you have your first crush on a girl, <br/>
and that when you talk back to your mother you learn what Ivory soap tastes <br/>
like. <br/>
May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on the stove and <br/>
stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole. <br/>
I hope you get sick when someone blows smoke in your face. I don’t care if <br/>
you try beer once, but I hope you won’t like it. And if a friend offers you a <br/>
joint or any drugs, I hope you are smart enough to realize that person is not <br/>
your friend. <br/>
I sure hope you make time to sit on a porch with your grandpa or go fishing <br/>
with your uncle. <br/>
I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through a neighbor’<br/>
s window, and that she hugs you and kisses you when you give her a plaster of <br/>
paris mold of your hand. <br/>
These things I wish for you — tough times and disappointment, hard work and <br/>
happiness<br/>

pour himself a glass.  I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d handle it.  On the one <br/>

<br/>
My mom was a life-ruining alcoholic, and it&#39;s genetic, so I would worry.  <br/>
Neither my husband nor I are alcoholics, but any of our kids could be.  <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a personal perspective based on years of pain.<br/>
<br/>
My husband drinks occasionally.  I like to have a margarita when I&#39;m at a <br/>
fancy restaurant and am going to be lingering peacfully over a big chicken <br/>
enchilada plate for an hour.  Neither of us drinks for stress release or beverage <br/>
purposes.   <br/>
<br/>
One of my best teen-years friends, whom I was friends with for many years, <br/>
and his wife and kids, died at 35 of alcoholism.  (Not before ruining big chunks <br/>
of other people&#39;s lives.)<br/>
<br/>
I fear alcohol much more than I do guns or any other of the common boogey men <br/>
parents fear.  If there were some simple &quot;piss-in-a-cup, dip-a-strip, are you <br/>
a person who cannot drink alcohol or else you will ruin your life and several <br/>
more besides) test, then I would relax.  But the test is whether after a few <br/>
years that person won&#39;t even listen when others suggest he not drink so much, <br/>
and by that time the ruination has begun.<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s six of one or half a dozen of another to a kid, I&#39;d much rather he <br/>
channel his desire and potential addiction toward Coka Cola, Dr Pepper, coffee, <br/>
tea or even the minor-league illegal drugs than that he drank, grew to like <br/>
it, came to live for and in it.<br/>
<br/>
Real fear, based on real experiences.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-607906840">We have an old pepsi machine here filled with beer<br/>
(home-brewed and micro-brewed), home-made pop, (or<br/>
coke or pepsi when we can find the 12 oz bottles that<br/>

water....Usually quite an assortment.  They are all<br/>
available to everyone.  My 6 yo has always liked beer,<br/>
since about 2.  My 11 yo never has, except for<br/>
hefeweisen, but she&#39;s allergic to wheat so that&#39;s not<br/>
an option :(....Anyway, my 6 yo is likely to get<br/>
herself a beer maybe once, twice a month, and drink<br/>
about three swallows.  She also likes pop, juice, and<br/>
coffee--but she prefers water.<br/>

Anyway, I don&#39;t know how we &quot;hanlde&quot; it....I never<br/>

We don&#39;t drink at every meal.  &lt;g&gt; But at parties or when we&#39;re having a <br/>
&quot;finer&quot; supper, we&#39;ll pour each boy a small glass of wine or beer---whatever we&#39;re <br/>
drinking. They have the choice to drink it or not. It&#39;s important to us that <br/>
the wine go with the meal----to enhance the flavor and make the meal even <br/>
better than it would have been without it. So they&#39;ll usually have a sip or two. <br/>
Maybe even a whole glass. Very young, we would add some water to the glass, so <br/>
it wouldn&#39;t be as strong.<br/>
<br/>
Duncan&#39;s eight and barely drinks what we offer. Cameron&#39;s 16 and usually will <br/>
drink a glass or two at a dinner party----depending on the wine. He&#39;s <br/>
becoming fairly descriminating. <br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s always a bottle of wine in the &#39;frig&#39; and always a six-pack of good <br/>
beer too (since we buy beer mostly for parties and we hardly ever drink it all, <br/>
it just stays in the &#39;frig&#39;). It&#39;s fair game, just as the cokes, Capri-suns, <br/>
tea (sweet, of course! &lt;G&gt;), milk, juice, and water are.<br/>
<br/>
We have no concerns with Cameron. Our problem comes in with guests. We&#39;ve <br/>
told his friends that we have absolutely no problem with their drinking when <br/>
they&#39;re here if we&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s OK with their parents----and here it must be <br/>
in moderation. No drunken binges. So far, no parents have come forward with <br/>
an OK, so it&#39;s off-limits for them.<br/>
<br/>
Cameron&#39;s (maybe three times???) asked whether he could have a beer with <br/>
supper. It&#39;s always OK. But every time I&#39;ve found the bottle only half-drunk. So <br/>
I&#39;m not worried about any serious problems.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Sandra here though-----if there were alcoholism somewhere in our <br/>
backgrounds, I&#39;d be much more concerned. As it is, I&#39;m easy with it. I&#39;d <br/>
rather both boys learn to drink socially than to sneak off to binge as I saw so <br/>
many of my friends do by 15-16 and on up into college and beyond.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I have alcoholism and drug addicts in my family (although they are <br/>
grandparents and uncles, not parents or siblings.)  My husband&#39;s parents <br/>
were also alcoholics, although that is not something anyone in their <br/>
family discusses as both his parents are dead.  My parents were very <br/>
open with alcohol.  If I wanted a glass, I was able to help myself.  I&#39;m <br/>
not sure when this started, but probably at about 10 or so.  They <br/>
probably did what I am doing, which is letting my children have sips of <br/>
whatever I have, with a glass themselves at special occassions.  Lexie <br/>
has asked for a glass of champaigne and I complied.  She didn&#39;t drink <br/>
it, beyond a few sips.  Janene likes beer and has drank more than a sip <br/>
of mine, with my permission.  As Lexie gets older, she&#39;ll be able to <br/>
have whatever she wishes, within reason.  Same with her friends, <br/>
although I will need to have permission of their parents or know them <br/>
very well (her best friend has parents who do as we do, so I would not <br/>
have a problem letting this child have wine or beer and in fact, I <br/>
think, already have, although it&#39;s been in the form of tasting from my <br/>
own glass, at least one time in her parent&#39;s house.)  My parents, by the <br/>
time I was in my teens, would buy me wine on request (I liked red at the <br/>
time, and they drank white so I generally had to ask to get the type I <br/>
wanted).  I also would request beer on occassion, although I was happy <br/>
to drink my dad&#39;s if he had some around.  My parents used to drink more <br/>
than they do now, and my dad would have 1-2 drinks a day usually while <br/>
my mom was a 1-2 drink per week, if that.  I go through phases when I <br/>
drink a glass or two every day and then I go through phases where I go <br/>
for months without touching the stuff.  All is normal and I want my <br/>
children to see this.  There has been a few occassions when Lexie has <br/>
taken it upon herself to poor me a glass of wine unbidden and I found <br/>
that a sweet thing to do.  Once I asked her to bring me a glass and she <br/>
was taking the longest time but I was busy doing something and didn&#39;t <br/>
notice until she came up with the new bottle of wine and the corkscrew <br/>
almost out, and said &quot;I ALMOST did it mom, but I can&#39;t get it out the <br/>
last bit&quot; and I was rather proud that my eight year old figured out how <br/>
to use the corkscrew.  ;-)  Lexie is also aware of how food effects <br/>
alcohol, and has said, when we go out, mom, if you have a glass of wine <br/>
now and then eat, you&#39;ll be OK to drive.  but only ONE glass of wine.  :-) <br/>
<br/>
I think modeling good drinking habits and teaching moderation will go a <br/>
long way toward prevention of addiction.  My mom used to say &quot;if you <br/>
WANT a glass of wine, go ahead but if you NEED a glass of wine, you need <br/>
to rethink things.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
Lexie and I were talking about pot the other day and an anti drug <br/>
commercial that loops all the drugs as being the same evil, and her <br/>
ideas on why pot was not so bad were pretty sophisticated.  We&#39;ve talked <br/>
about it a lot.  I&#39;ve told her that if she wants to try pot, I&#39;d like <br/>
for her to please come to me so we could find some that was pretty pure <br/>
(or grow it ourselves) because of the risk of it being laced with acid <br/>
or something she didn&#39;t want to try.  I&#39;d also rather her try it with me <br/>
(I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d actually smoke pot again, at this point in my life <br/>
I&#39;d say no, I&#39;m too much of a control freak and I am not in control when <br/>
drunk or on drugs, but I would be with her while she did so).  She&#39;s <br/>
very aware of medical uses for pot and agrees that it should be legal.  <br/>
We&#39;ve also spent time talking about the risks of breaking any law, but <br/>
especially laws regarding drugs, and how we must measure the risks vs <br/>
the benefits or desire to try a drug. <br/>
<br/>
I think my parents pretty liberal views on drinking and their kids paid <br/>
off.  Of my four grandparents, all but one was either a drug addict or <br/>
alcoholic. Both my uncles and my one aunt are also drug <br/>
addicts/alcoholics (although everyone is in recovery and has been for <br/>
years.)  My parents had three children (two biologically) and all of us <br/>
are very mild drinkers.  I plan to follow their lead as this is one area <br/>
parenting wise in which I think they did pretty good.  :-) <br/>
