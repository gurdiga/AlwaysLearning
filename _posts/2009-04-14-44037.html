<div id="ygrps-yiv-1039324407">One of my daughters saw, on late night TV,<br/>
the author of a cookbook promoting both<br/>
the cookbook (the topic of which is edible <br/>
insects) and the idea that eating insects<br/>
is eco-friendly, healthy, and tasty.  DD was<br/>
intrigued, so we purchased a few cookbooks<br/>
on the subject.<br/>
<br/>
Now, of course, she wants to order the<br/>
insects, or start farming them on her own, and try<br/>
out the recipes.  But the rest of us are having<br/>
a really hard time finding enthusiasm for the<br/>
idea of eating insects.  I  was able to eat a <br/>
chocolate covered cricket with some persuasion<br/>
from DD, and I have heard that ground insects<br/>
find their way into many food products, but a whole <br/>
meal of insects?  I&#39;m having a hard time with it.  <br/>
<br/>
The pictures in the cookbooks are beautiful, but<br/>
I think I would have a hard time if those dishes were in <br/>
front of me, on my table.  EVEN THOUGH I would know <br/>
they had been lovingly prepared for me by DD.<br/>
<br/>
I feel kinda like Indiana Jones when he is <br/>
presented with the goat eyeball to eat.  But then,<br/>
he was only concerned with not offending his host;<br/>
I want not to quash my DDs enthusiasm.  I guess<br/>
a meal of mealworms is in my future.<br/>
<br/>
Then we&#39;ve got several in the family who<br/>
enjoy fish heads (and particularly the eyeballs).<br/>
They are not trying to sell me on the idea<br/>
of trying fish heads out, though, b/c typically<br/>
we only have two fish and at least three people<br/>
who are interested in eating the heads.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the idea that bugs or fish heads or<br/>
fill-in-the-blank is &quot;icky&quot; is a cultural construct.<br/>
I will keep telling myself that as I try the stink<br/>
bug souffle.  (The cookbooks say the name is<br/>
a misnomer; supposedly, they have a nutty taste.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-100257070">I had to smile at this post, my daughter has added cooking to her current passions (I so love using that word describing the kids&#39; interests because it is so true). She hasn&#39;t ventured into the realm of insect meals, though the 4 yr old would probably enjoy it, he still eats worms from time to time. I am not sure how I would feel about adding that to her current repertoire of foods she cooks. She likes mommy to sample the things she makes. That might be one she would go to Pa-Pa&#39;s and cook, he will literally eat anything that doesn&#39;t eat him first and enjoys fish heads and other odd food delicacies. <br/>

with insects and it was pretty cool. By the end, I was willing to take a <br/>
bite, out of curiosity. But I wasn&#39;t the only one - the line to taste a <br/>
sample was REALLY long and after waiting about ten minutes we could tell <br/>
it would be over an hour wait. Since nobody else was going to take a <br/>
taste, we moved on. I don&#39;t like everything - don&#39;t like sushi at all, <br/>
for example, but if other people eat it and like it, I do like to give <br/>
it a try. I&#39;m not squeamish.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1687088132">-=-LOL! But really, it is an eco-friendly way to feed the world,-=-<br/>
<br/>
So might be eating dogs and cats, but our culture doesn&#39;t allow it.   <br/>
We don&#39;t eat horses, either.  We don&#39;t eat bugs, either.<br/>
<br/>
If people want to make exceptions they might be able to (depends on  <br/>
local laws and prejudices).   Just because one culture drinks milk  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s equally good for all people in the world, and insect  <br/>
eating could be the same way.<br/>
<br/>
In France the eat snails.   In Korea, I hear, some people eat  dogs.   <br/>
In India, lots of people won&#39;t eat beef.<br/>
<br/>
Most people I know won&#39;t eat pork rinds. &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t try to make them  <br/>
do it.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s no reason for people to be pressed to eat what they don&#39;t want  <br/>
to eat.  There are many reasons for people NOT to be pressed to eat  <br/>
anything at all.<br/>
<br/>
-=So to say, &quot;you have to wait until you have your own kitchen,&quot;<br/>
when my only reason forsaying no is that I am viscerally grossed<br/>
out, with, admittedly,no good reason to be, I think is shutting<br/>
down her interest unfairly. Exercising veto power indiscriminately.-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not arbitrary.  It&#39;s not indiscriminate.   It shouldn&#39;t shut down  <br/>
her interest, either.  Keith was interested in going in to space.  Did  <br/>
his parents shut down his interest because they didn&#39;t arrange for it  <br/>
to happen?   (His dad was even a missile range controller; still  <br/>
didn&#39;t stow him away in anything.)&#39;<br/>
<br/>
-=-If parenting mindfully means facing things that make me<br/>
uncomfortable, and asking why, and seeing if I can look at it<br/>
a different way, well, &quot;Hey, Mom, will you eat my bug stew?&quot;<br/>
certainly deserves consideration. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Not if you&#39;re viscerally grossed out.<br/>
Especially not if the question is asked with even the slightest intent  <br/>
to gross you out.<br/>
<br/>
Parenting mindfully doesn&#39;t mean making the parents so powerless that  <br/>
the kids can make them eat bugs.<br/>
<br/>
-=-<br/>
Seriously, if I don&#39;t accept her &quot;far out&quot; food choices now,<br/>
can I expect her to continue to share her unique self with me<br/>
in future? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Sure.  If you&#39;re honest with her, and she&#39;s honest with you, why would  <br/>
honesty not grow?<br/>
<br/>
If you eat bugs to prove you don&#39;t mind her being weird, that&#39;s not  <br/>
the most honest scenario.  &quot;Being weird&quot; is being other than one  <br/>
actually is.<br/>

<br/>
I do think you should support it and let her use the kitchen to <br/>
experiment with it. Maybe it sounds a lot more extreme to Sandra in <br/>
Albuquerque than to me here in Southern California (where  people  do <br/>
eat dog and horse and buffalo and ostrich). I&#39;d want the kitchen kept <br/>
clean - not leave stuff around to gross out other people.<br/>

interest in spite of our own very distinct lack of interest seems okay. <br/>
Singing in public makes me uncomfortable enough that I can&#39;t bring <br/>
myself to do it, but I&#39;ve supported that interest in my kids - for years <br/>
(without actually doing it myself, I mean).<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What a fascinating topic!  I&#39;ve thought about this myself every once in a while, then watched people on tv actually eating bugs and pushed it out of my mind. ;)  (I think there is a show on the food network or the travel channel called &quot;Bizarre Foods&quot;--your daughter might enjoy that.  I also LOVE the show &quot;Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations&quot; on the travel channel--he goes to various places around the world and takes part in the cultural practices and especially food prep/eating of that area&#39;s traditional foods--I&#39;m certain I&#39;ve seen insects eaten on both shows ;)<br/>
<br/>
A recent passion of mine has been microbial nutrition--fermenting foods (to increase nutrients and digestability) on the countertop at home.  Not sure if she&#39;d be interested, but your post got me thinking of it because it&#39;s all about growing the beneficial &#39;bugs&#39; and bacteria that populate our digestive tracts, that help us to have good gut flora and aiding in digestion.  It&#39;s a food prep/preservation method that has been (and continues to be) used by most cultures throughout human history (from what I&#39;ve read).  <br/>
<br/>
Making things like sour kraut, kimchi, kefir, yogurt, sourdough breads, etc. *can* be soooo fun and delicious.  And it&#39;s really easy and pretty cheap (and just yum yum yummy!)  I feel like a scientist with each new &#39;creation&#39;, and just find it all very exciting!  &quot;Wild Fermentation&quot; is a great book to check out for those interested in learning more about it...<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and as far as *eating* the bugs, I agree w/ pp&#39;s who mentioned supporting your daughter&#39;s passion, but not eating them if you don&#39;t want to.  If her cooking them made you uncomfortable, maybe even having a separate set of pots and utensils for her insect cooking explorations could be helpful?  All of this just depends on your own comfort level!<br/>

<br/>
Like a bug-kosher kitchen?<br/>
Keith and I were talking about this last night.   People who eat  <br/>
lobsters and clams and crabs, especially those who catch them and  <br/>
clean and cook them, might not be so bothered by the idea of  <br/>
grasshoppers, or the might.    I used to eat fried crawdads, but  <br/>
that&#39;s not like the crayfish, whole, in Louisiana.  This were large  <br/>
crawdad found in West Texas by my papaw, taken apart by my granny so  <br/>
that there were two, three, four little pieces of meat that didn&#39;t  <br/>
look at all like a big mud-bug to me.<br/>
<br/>
Squeamishness is a legitimate reason to politely turn down food.   <br/>
Forcing a kid to eat pork but not allowing lamb, that&#39;s just  <br/>
prejudice.   Forcing lamb and forbidding pork, that might be  <br/>
religion.   But nowhere in unschooling-land should anyone be forcing  <br/>
anyone to eat anything!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1773535157">-=-Doesn&#39;t allow it as in, it is a cultural taboo. Legalities are  <br/>
another<br/>
matter. According to Slate, eating dog meat is legal in 44 states in<br/>
the U.S. (How reliable a source is Slate?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t even know what &quot;Slate&quot; is, but just because there&#39;s not a law  <br/>
against something doesn&#39;t necessarily make it &quot;legal.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s not a law against putting a kitten in a box kite and sending  <br/>
him up for a ride, but probably because it&#39;s just not something people  <br/>
do.  If someone does this now, because they read it on this list, that  <br/>
would be somewhere between reactionary and stupid, and if the  <br/>
neighbors complained they could probably be charged with cruelty to an  <br/>
animal.<br/>
<br/>
I doubt that 44 U.S. state repealed laws against eating dogs; probably  <br/>
they didn&#39;t have a law in the first place because the taboo is  <br/>
strong.   Tradition can&#39;t be repealed.<br/>
<br/>
-=-OTOH, 80% of the world&#39;s population eats insects intentionally--that<br/>
figure keeps popping up on site after site--and we&#39;ve all probably eaten<br/>
insects accidentally, or without knowing it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
The fact that flour might have mealy worms or corn has worms or apples  <br/>
without worms might still have the potential future for worms (because  <br/>
the eggs were laid in the blossoms before the apple was formed) is not  <br/>
remotely related to cooking up exoskeletal creatures, and a mom  <br/>
insulting other unschoolers for suggesting they don&#39;t want to eat any.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But about being weird? I don&#39;t think &quot;Being weird&quot; is &quot;being other<br/>
than one actually is.&quot; It can be. -=-<br/>
<br/>
The way you described it, it was.   It was a choice to do something  <br/>
for the sake of it being odd or shocking.<br/>
<br/>
This is a gigantic science-fiction jump:<br/>
<br/>
  I didn&#39;t/don&#39;t do them to &quot;be weird.&quot;<br/>
I do them b/c this is who I am.<br/>
According to wikipedia: ...<br/>
&quot;The concept of Wyrd highlights the interconnected nature of all<br/>
actions and how they influence each other.&quot;...<br/>
And from <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread215126/pg1...">http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread215126/pg1...</a><br/>
....  The word to describe this interconnectedness was &quot;wyrd&quot;, which  <br/>
was eventually perverted into the modern meaning of &quot;weird&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
WHOA!  Come back to earth gravity!<br/>
There&#39;s a world (several fantasy worlds) of reconstructed and  <br/>
imaginary &quot;religion&quot; and recycling of medieval words.   They don&#39;t  <br/>
even begin to trump the actual, normal English language.   If 800  <br/>
years ago there was a spelling of what became our modern &quot;weird&quot; that  <br/>
was &quot;wyrd,&quot; that does NOT mean the current term is a perversion.  It  <br/>
was a natural progression involving regional pronunciation, the great  <br/>
vowel shift, and standardized spelling.   From the older words, &quot;wyrd&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;worth&quot; are related, but that doesn&#39;t mean either is &quot;a  <br/>
perversion&quot; of the other.  One meaning fell entirely out of common  <br/>
usage; the concept was lost because beliefs changed.  Where the older  <br/>
idea of fate and the supernatural meets the modern idea of &quot;kinda odd&quot;  <br/>
is in the creepy/spooky/eerie aspect.  When someone is acting in a  <br/>
mysterious way, that&#39;s weird.<br/>
<br/>
Let&#39;s make things plainer and simpler, not creepy and weird.<br/>

Too much noise about things unrelated to the simple, quiet ideas  <br/>
behind unschooling are not good for this list.  There are unlimited  <br/>
opportunities to immerse oneself in argument and negativity and  <br/>
fantasy and strife.  There are very few opportunities to discuss  <br/>
something as profound as how to see learning and life in a clearer  <br/>
way.   I&#39;d like to preserve the focus of this list.<br/>

<br/>
*The fact that flour might have mealy worms or corn has worms or apples<br/>
without worms might still have the potential future for worms (because<br/>
the eggs were laid in the blossoms before the apple was formed) is not<br/>
remotely related to cooking up exoskeletal creatures, and a mom<br/>
insulting other unschoolers for suggesting they don&#39;t want to eat any.**<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m the one who said, &quot;I would eat it.&quot; But I didn&#39;t mean that <br/>
eating bugs was necessary to be a good unschooling mom - if it was taken <br/>
as insulting to those who wouldn&#39;t want to eat it, then I apologize for <br/>
that. My intention was to point out that we come at things like this <br/>
from different vantage points - I am a very adventurous eater - I ENJOY <br/>
trying out new and different foods, especially regional specialties. And <br/>
I live in a place where there is tremendous diversity, including <br/>
restaurants that specialize in dog meat. Plus, I love shrimp and I don&#39;t <br/>
see that as so different than insects, so the idea doesn&#39;t gross me out. <br/>
I&#39;m sure if one of my daughters got really into this cooking with bugs <br/>
stuff, I&#39;d get into it, too.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised, in fact, that all the immediate reactions were so <br/>
totally negative. The original poster was asking what would we do? Would <br/>
we, as unschoolers feel like we needed to support this interest? My own <br/>
answer is that I, personally, don&#39;t see why not? It doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>
those who find it distasteful have to actually EAT the stuff - but why <br/>
not support the interest in ways that are possible. It isn&#39;t immoral or <br/>
extremely dangerous. I&#39;d rather support that than motorcycle riding or <br/>
jumping out of airplanes, myself.<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter who has always been extremely squeamish about the <br/>
insides of the human body. And another daughter who has always been <br/>
fascinated by it. We all went to see Body Worlds (the plasticized real <br/>
bodies traveling exhibit) and Rosie and I were totally absolutely <br/>
enthralled and could have happily spent a few long days in the exhibit. <br/>
Roxana rushed through and went outside to wait - she was sickened. <br/>
Later, she moaned, &quot;What if I have kids who LIKE this kind of thing? How <br/>
will I be able to handle that?&quot; I told her she could get their grandma <br/>
to support that particular interest.&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But, anyway, I think the question is part of the bigger issue of how to <br/>
we support our children&#39;s interests when we, ourselves, have negative <br/>
feelings about them. The negative feelings could be because it grosses <br/>
us out, or embarrasses us or scares us or other reasons.<br/>

natural for a particular child but every kid is different. Kat  <br/>
doesn&#39;t seem much interested in parenthood. (I wasn&#39;t either.)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-191971624">Thank You for the short but enlightening conversation we had here from this<br/>
discussion.   I really connected with that part that Pam wrote too (I can&#39;t<br/>
seem to copy and paste here - I&#39;ll work on that).  There was a couple of<br/>
reasons...  One was how nice it was to think about how unschooling is going<br/>
to be a part of so many of our lives for the rest of our lives and will<br/>
benefit any grandchildren we might have one day.  :)   I do think of future<br/>
grandchildren someday.<br/>
 <br/>
I also liked how Roxana was thinking about this as a future parent too.  My<br/>
kids, ds 14 & dd 12, have never openly talked about having children in the<br/>
future in quite that way but they have mentioned being parents once or twice<br/>
over the years so I know they&#39;ve thought about it.  I don&#39;t think it was<br/>
much more than if they might go down that road though.  I know that I&#39;ve<br/>
said to them things like how glad I am that I&#39;ve been able to learn how to<br/>
be a different parent than my own parents were.  I know  they&#39;ve noticed for<br/>
awhile now that other parents do definitely parent much differently and<br/>
they&#39;ve said how glad they are we are different than &#39;most&#39; families.<br/>
Being nontraditional families the children might start questioning things<br/>
sooner than others.<br/>
 <br/>
I remember as a young girl pretending I had a child who I seem to remember<br/>
scolding alot.  I think an unschool me would pretend very differently.  I&#39;ve<br/>
realized, over the years looking back, I was totally afraid of having<br/>
children too.  I always knew I didn&#39;t want the relationship with my own<br/>
children I had with my parents.  Until I knew I could do it differently I<br/>
wasn&#39;t ready to have children, I was still afraid but had more confidence.  <br/>
 <br/>
Robyn wrote: Are we creating a ripple effect here?  I think so.  Any<br/>
unschool child who pretends or thinks of parenthood will have different<br/>
dreams and concerns than punishing and/or scolding their children.  :)<br/>

I think so, Robyn.  Karl is only 5 and he&#39;s been talking about his own <br/>
kids someday for a while now.  And his wife too.  Which is amazing to <br/>
me, considering all the turmoil me and Brian have been through in our <br/>
own marriage (not recommending it or saying it has no harmful <br/>
effect(s)).  Karl is very confident about the future.  I know some <br/>
people will say he *is* only 5.  I remember being so torn up about life <br/>
by 8 or 9 years old that I had already sworn off having any kids of my <br/>
own.  Not all school kids swear off family life but many of them do.  <br/>
So that isn&#39;t universal.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to hear about those unschooling kids and what they think.  I <br/>
think I&#39;ll go post to them in Unschooling Offspring and see what they <br/>
say.<br/>

My 3 year old DD Gigi talks a lot about keeping her things to give to her babies and how she has &quot;leitinho ( milk) in her breasts for them.<br/>
She is very young put I can see she already thinks of having her own babies.<br/>
My son says he wants to have 4 or 5 kids too.<br/>
We are saving some of his toys like all his Thomas for his kids.<br/>

absolutely hopes to have children (some day) and unschooling is for <br/>
sure. She&#39;s slightly anxious that she&#39;ll fall in love with someone who <br/>
won&#39;t be on board with unschooling and she says that will be a big <br/>
consideration whenever dating anybody. She cannot imagine how she&#39;d <br/>
stand it if she had kids and had to make them go to school. If they <br/>
wanted to go to school, she&#39;d support that, but she&#39;d try to find out <br/>
why and meet their needs outside of regular schooling.<br/>
<br/>
Mostly that was in her own words....I didn&#39;t type quite fast enough to <br/>
make it a perfect quote.<br/>
