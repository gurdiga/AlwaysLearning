<div id="ygrps-yiv-74836162">I was working on a medieval outfit for Holly (one of three she needs  <br/>
for a big campout) and got a call from the Children, Youth and  <br/>
Families Department of the State of New Mexico.  I had been expecting  <br/>
the call, and had tried to call back and had left my number yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I figured it would be about homeschooling.  I figured it wouldn&#39;t be  <br/>
much trouble, but I wasn&#39;t thrilled about the prospect of explaining  <br/>
it all to someone.<br/>
<br/>
Turned out it wasn&#39;t about that at all, but someone not liking my blog!<br/>
<br/>
Well, then.  It was a complaint about the (now) fourth (then third)  <br/>
post down, May 9.<br/>

<br/>
The comments were mostly moved to another page, which is linked  <br/>
there.  And the &quot;comment deleted&quot; only said &quot;Mine wasn&#39;t  <br/>
irritating.&quot;  You can figure out whose it was, if you look at the  <br/>
comments.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not trying to spook anyone at all, I just think it&#39;s a  <br/>
fascinating peek into how much some people want to control others and  <br/>
how desperately some people want to justify their own fears and  <br/>
&quot;safety&quot; rules.<br/>
<br/>
So this post might&#39;ve been more about unschooling if that&#39;s why the  <br/>
social worker called. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
