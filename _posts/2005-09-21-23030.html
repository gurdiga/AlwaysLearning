<div id="ygrps-yiv-532784035">=====================================================<br/>
I just cant seem to let go. So much that I read says just don&#39;t censor<br/>
but some of the stuff is just so bad now. And he is 8, we have NOT had<br/>
the sex talk, so that would have to happen first. But then he sees<br/>
these commercials, and these shows ARE soo funny and interesting.<br/>
<br/>
What do you do ?<br/>
<br/>
========================================================================<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, I deleted a post that was in the to-be-approved queue, thinking it was <br/>
on the Unschooling Discussion list, so I&#39;ve brought the text of it back.<br/>
<br/>
This has been discussed fairly recently I think, and though we can go through <br/>
again, does anyone remember when or where the last pass was?   I remember <br/>
someone (Joyce?) making the point that they tend not to watch what&#39;s above their <br/>
heads, or not to notice it.   <br/>
<br/>
Generally, my thought is that no one should do what she doesn&#39;t understand, <br/>
so any mom who doesn&#39;t get why loosening controls would be helpful is probably <br/>
not ready to loosen anything.   We can get ourselves in a <br/>
carts-before-situation if action precedes   understanding.     Then again, much of the <br/>
understanding of unschooling comes from experience itself.   <br/>
<br/>
Is this another ease-into-it situation?<br/>

<br/>
He isn&#39;t going to see the same things in the shows that you are. The  <br/>
sex stuff is going to pass him right by.<br/>
<br/>
There are books I read as a child and enjoyed but have since heard  <br/>
had some rather unpleasant images of black people. (Bobsey Twins,  <br/>
early Nancy Drew, The Egg and I, and there was one about a cat that  <br/>
owned a baseball team.) It totally flew by me because it didn&#39;t fit  <br/>
in with my world view. I was just reading for the story I wanted and  <br/>
tuned out the parts that were annoying sidetracks.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a simplistic answer because it&#39;s often taken by people to mean  <br/>
let them watch whatever without helping them at all. But it really  <br/>
means help them find what they want and avoid what they don&#39;t want.<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s saying &quot;Yuck&quot; to the relationship part, tape them and let him  <br/>
fast forward. If he doesn&#39;t care I suspect he&#39;s just tuning it out as  <br/>
he waits for the next good part or paying attention to just the funny  <br/>
part.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1664969211">One of my biggest frustrations when talking with other homeschooled <br/>
parents is their belief that if they didn&#39;t control things their <br/>
children would do &quot;too much&quot; or &quot;too little&quot; of something. When I <br/>
state that I don&#39;t believe that to be true, that children take what <br/>
they need at that time, that my child (a 7yo)can have unlimited access <br/>
to TV, PS2, computer w/ internet, books, radio etc.... and has a large <br/>
variety of interests and is able to use them according to his needs. <br/>
e.g. That his hands are not always glued to the TV remote or PS2 <br/>
controller. Then I usually consistently get the same reply from the <br/>
other parents that is &quot;that&#39;s your child, not mine, mine doesn&#39;t have <br/>
any self control, etc.&quot; which I usually reply that they won&#39;t know <br/>
that until they give the control completely over to them and NOT just <br/>
for an experimentary day or week. Unfortunately very few of them are <br/>
willing to try giving control over for very long, if at all. So I move <br/>
on for other parents to talk with, hopefully there will be likeminded <br/>
people at the Live & Learn conference, becuase nobody I know IRL is <br/>
going. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
    From my experience with my son I find that he watches what shows <br/>
interest him. It is RARE that he watches a show that has really adult <br/>
aimed content, but if he does then he asks me or dad if he needs an <br/>
explanation of a subjet or joke. Actually I have seen him start watch <br/>
a scary cartoon show in one room by himself and then when he gets <br/>
scared he will come into the room I&#39;m in and turn on the TV in here or <br/>
ask me to go into the previous room with him. So I feel that he trusts <br/>
us to help him deal with things that he&#39;s not ready to deal with <br/>
alone. I&#39;m hoping that it will be the same way with sexual content, <br/>
that he will ask questions as needed or come to us if he&#39;s scared or <br/>
confused about something. <br/>
     We watched Jerry (the mouse from Tom & Jerry) spank his younger <br/>
cousin at the end of a cartoon yesterday because he had accientally <br/>
poked Jerry with his sword, we talked about it. When he sees someone <br/>
kissing or touching on a TV show that he&#39;s interested in then we&#39;ll <br/>
talk about that also. HTH - Barbara</div>

<br/>
It seems what will cause a kid to watch a show he doesn&#39;t want to watch is <br/>
parental disapproval.   If he&#39;s been told it&#39;s too scary, too adult, or <br/>
forbidden, his natural curiosity might cause him to want to learn WHY.   My kids, with <br/>
the freedom to turn things on or off, turned LOTS of things off, or colored <br/>
or did Lego or played with dolls or action figures during &quot;the boring parts&quot; <br/>
(often happening to be the adult parts--what did they care?) and only looked <br/>
back up with happy music or light or dogs or kids got their attention again.<br/>
<br/>
When the parents make lots of things available they know their kids WILL <br/>
like--DVDs, videos, music, games---those kids are unlikely to be listlessly <br/>
flipping through channels looking for something &quot;bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Kids who are forced to be sneaky, though, WILL look for the forbidden things, <br/>
and if they get scared their parents will be the last ones they&#39;ll go to.<br/>

attention again. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I guess this post went everywhere but here - it may be what you were<br/>
thinking of just before, Sandra. <br/>
<br/>
*Was synchronicity on three lists - now four!*<br/>
<br/>
Quote begins:<br/>
<br/>
It has been the most pronounced incidence of synchronicity that I have yet<br/>
noticed on the lists where there have been three mothers posting almost the<br/>
exact same sentiments on three Unschooling lists, specifically expressing<br/>
the same concerns about &quot;limiting to appropriate content&quot; with children of<br/>
varying ages, from 2 yo to 6 year olds, to a 10 yo, and a 14 yo.<br/>
<br/>
This is not really the forum for a lengthy dissertation into the discourses<br/>
of television comedy, or a dissection of the semiotics of the sitcom as a<br/>
depiction of the American family - as entertaining as I would personally<br/>
find writing such an essay.<br/>
<br/>
Nor is it necessarily as helpful to get into a lengthy &quot;I don&#39;t like show<br/>
X&quot;...&quot;Oh I like show X a lot&quot; debate - because tastes differ, definitions of<br/>
&quot;vulgar&quot; or funny differ, and it doesn&#39;t really get any further into the<br/>
principles behind the ideas of choice and learning.<br/>
<br/>
There seem to be two issues in reference to the content of tv programs or<br/>
movies. The first is the idea that the content, while not necessarily<br/>
objectionable in itself, is too &quot;mature&quot; for the children - either too scary<br/>
or too sexually explicit seem to the main concerns. <br/>
<br/>
In the first situation I have found, similarly to what others have reported,<br/>
that Jayn is very good at self-care if she starts to become scared of<br/>
images, sounds or characters&#39; behavior. She also seems to have developed her<br/>
own specific coping mechanisms for exploring the scary stuff including fast<br/>
forwarding, going away for a minute, desensitizing herself with repeated<br/>
gradual exposures, and role-playing games. I too have learnt the kind of<br/>
music or images that disturb her, and will warn her if a program seems<br/>
likely to be scary. <br/>
<br/>
In the case of sexually explicit - and people have different places where<br/>
they will become concerned - I have found, again similarly to what others<br/>
have reported, that Jayn has zero interest in the sexual or even mere<br/>
romantic antics of people on tv. She certainly is not seeking it out. If<br/>
something comes on in the course of changing channels or she walks into the<br/>
other room and something is on, she gets a kind of &quot;that looks stupid&quot;<br/>
expression and usually totally ignores it. At around 3, she used to enjoy<br/>
&quot;Sex and the City&quot; because she liked the pretty dresses and sparkles, and<br/>
would just go play with her dolls during any of the incomprehensible to her<br/>
sexual scenes. Now she just lumps adult themed shows of any kind (eg police<br/>
drama) together as &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;stupid garbage&quot; and asks for Disney channel.<br/>
It is only a matter of time before she starts expressing ideas and seeking<br/>
clarification (her version of asking questions) on the odd sexual scenes she<br/>
bumps into at times on tv.<br/>
<br/>
*** I will add that I believe that she will start seeking out or being<br/>
attracted to programs with sexual content (of any kind) at the appropriate<br/>
developmental time when her inner questioning arrives at that place - or to<br/>
put it conversely, she won&#39;t be interested until and unless she is &quot;ready&quot;<br/>
to receive that kind of information, coupled with the additional guidance<br/>
that I will be able to give her about the level of reality that she is<br/>
seeing. I try to see every new program as an opportunity for more<br/>
communication between us.<br/>
<br/>
The second issue of concern has to do with the &quot;family values&quot; and behavior<br/>
and relationships of characters in the shows. I have to agree that both the<br/>
characters and the situations in teen sitcoms and movies often depict values<br/>
that are in conflict with the ideas of Unschooling, including lousy<br/>
parenting, adults as adversarial and dumb simultaneously, and sibling<br/>
conflict portrayed as normal and acceptable. <br/>
<br/>
However whether these values are going to be genuinely internalized and<br/>
adopted by our children is another question. I personally doubt it, despite<br/>
the experimental forays into these less than charming behaviors our kids<br/>
sometimes engage in. I am seeing it for the first time - Jayn has started<br/>
calling me &quot;stupid head&quot; at odd times - from &quot;Lilo and Stitch&quot; (movie). I<br/>
have Trust that it will get old soon. I also endorse the idea of talking<br/>
over in a genuine way specific behaviors or ideas, rather than making a<br/>
negative assessment of the show your kid loves. (I come and blurt the latter<br/>
onto the lists instead of onto Jayn). ;)<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the fact that I doubt that any of us are remotely like any of<br/>
these detached, authoritarian or befuddled parents, the biggest, hugest,<br/>
most significant difference between our children and 100percent of the kids<br/>
portrayed on any of these shows is: they are all in mandatory school.<br/>
<br/>
These TV children&#39;s primary bonding relationships are shown as being with<br/>
their friends and age peers, and with few exceptions, the majority of their<br/>
time is spent in the school hallways, on school related projects, including<br/>
some really contrived nonsense, and conversing with each other about school<br/>
stuff or school people. Additionally, with the one exception of Ren Stevens<br/>
who likes it and is a butt of humor for that reason, they seem consider<br/>
school a necessary evil. <br/>
<br/>
I believe that these shows portray a heightened and exaggerated depiction of<br/>
what we Unschoolers would consider some of the very real negatives of school<br/>
as they apply to family life - the appropriation of almost all time with the<br/>
concomitant disintegration of close family relationships, the culture of<br/>
peer approval and cliques and personality labeling (&quot;jocks&quot;, &quot;geeks&quot;,<br/>
&quot;popular girls&quot;, etc), the separation and fostering of distrust and<br/>
disconnection between parents and children, the adult (parent or teacher) as<br/>
both incomprehensible and a killjoy even while they are &quot;humorously&quot;<br/>
infantile (esp. males), children as directly powerless in the face of school<br/>
or parental rules so resorting to underhand strategies (hi jinks ensue!<br/>
:P~~). <br/>
<br/>
The entertainment value of these shows to schooled children, who undoubtedly<br/>
recognize themselves to a much greater degree, is likely partly in that very<br/>
separation from the parents. The tv kids usually spend almost no time in<br/>
class of any kind - more wishful thinking for the schooled kids. It is<br/>
possible that these tv kids have more personal power and autonomy than the<br/>
real children - they certainly will do more outlandish stuff. The didactic<br/>
&quot;mother knows best in the end&quot; message of most of these shows, is a small<br/>
price to pay (I mean for the schooled child viewers) for getting to watch<br/>
people make really dumb choices (dumber than they might make irl) and follow<br/>
through the absurd results. I notice that &quot;grounding&quot; is the universal<br/>
punishment, applied even after the &quot;lesson&quot; has been learned. <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that most of our children have much less identification with the<br/>
characters. Maybe they watch this stuff with the same sense of disbelieving<br/>
astonishment that some of us apply to Jerry Springer, or with the same<br/>
curiosity as pausing to view a car wreck or collapsed building. It is the<br/>
very &quot;otherness&quot; of these families that makes them interesting.<br/>
<br/>
I asked Jayn what she likes about &quot;That&#39;s So Raven&quot;, her current favorite. I<br/>
discovered that her attraction to the show comes from her enjoyment of<br/>
Raven&#39;s dress up as odd characters antics, and also she likes Raven&#39;s<br/>
regular clothing which is heavy on the sparkle, feathers and embroidery. We<br/>
record the programs, and sometimes if one of the other characters is the<br/>
featured story that day, she will ask me to skip over those scenes that do<br/>
not include Raven herself. In other words the actual narrative or internal<br/>
&quot;logic&quot; is irrelevant to Jayn&#39;s enjoyment.<br/>
<br/>
In the past Jayn has included shows that I don&#39;t like (for values) in her<br/>
viewing schedule. Her interest has waned, not because I made any attempt to<br/>
limit, but because she received all she needed and her interests matured. We<br/>
had lots of conversations about specific moments that I disapproved of,<br/>
along the lines of other choices the characters could have made in those<br/>
moments.<br/>
<br/>
Unlike schooled kids, our children have the opportunity to continue to have<br/>
authentic relationships with us. We can continue to be the first and primary<br/>
values influence in their lives, as well as their strongest safety net,<br/>
regardless of what tv shows they like. I hope that it is our huge presence<br/>
in their lives, and willingness to really listen without a hidden agenda,<br/>
that will ultimately mitigate any of the experimental &quot;bad&quot; behavior that<br/>
they may try on.<br/>

All three of mine were that way.   I tried to interest Holly in a peek at a <br/>

but she has no interest.   She&#39;s seen enough of nekkid behinds (and fronts), in <br/>

movie he&#39;s all or just some of naked, wet and shot.   <br/>

If it&#39;s treated as not any high-charged, dangerous big deal, then there&#39;s no <br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have two daughters three years and under. Here&#39;s what we do<br/>
concerning tv and other things (like sugar) that I&#39;m concerned about<br/>
exposing my daughters to. Since there are things on tv that I don&#39;t<br/>
want my daughters to be influenced by (hatred and violence), I don&#39;t<br/>
have a television. (We do watch DVDs on the computer.) And if there&#39;s<br/>
a tv on at someone else&#39;s house, I don&#39;t worry as much about it. I<br/>
don&#39;t fill the house with sugary snacks, but if there are snacks in<br/>
the house, they can have some. I remember how appalled I felt as a<br/>
child when I learned that both my aunt and my mom&#39;s cousin kept sweets<br/>
on the top shelf of their cupboards that were off-limits to the kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1207808931">I have to chime in on this. We haven&#39;t always unschooled, but my youngest is<br/>
an always unschooled child. At 10, with three teen siblings, he has been<br/>
exposed to more than my other kids at his age, he has unlimited access to<br/>
the tv and computer and he has no desire to watch things that are<br/>
inappropriate or uncomfortable for him. In fact, he rarely watches tv unless<br/>
we are all watching together.  The older kids are pretty good about not<br/>
watching things not appropriate for him. Of course, our family favorite<br/>
shows are CIS and NCIS and we all watch them including my 10 year old..and<br/>
some would say those shows are not appropriate for his age...but that&#39;s a<br/>
whole other discussion! <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven&#39;t banned television, but yes I will not offer porn to my<br/>
&gt; children, if you consider that a ban.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The question wasn&#39;t would you offer your children porn but would you<br/>
limit your children&#39;s environment based on part of what it has to<br/>
offer.  So, would you keep your children from talking to strangers<br/>
because once someone said something inappropriate to them?  Or would<br/>
you not let them eat cookie dough because there is some small risk<br/>
that they could get e-coli from the raw eggs?  <br/>
<br/>
The book comparison gets used because so many people see a<br/>
television/book dichotomy with television being the bad and books<br/>
being the good approach to story telling.  But of course before<br/>
television there would have been many other story telling venues:<br/>
theatre, public lectures, Punch and Judy shows at the local fete to<br/>
name a few.  Television has subsumed much of these visual mediums with<br/>
documentaries that are so much more informative than a slide show<br/>
presentation of My Trip to the Himalayas given at the local Women&#39;s<br/>
Institute or with a full out modernized production of Romeo and Juliet<br/>
with guns and fast cars and helicopter chase scenes to underscore the<br/>
tensions of the Capulet and Montague family squabble.  Not to say that<br/>
you shouldn&#39;t go to the local lectures or the amazing stage<br/>
productions on offer. But my two, Simon (8) and Linnaea (5), didn&#39;t do<br/>
well sitting for an hour long talk by Adam Hart Davis (a UK<br/>
semi-celebrity who presents Open University science programs for BBC<br/>
or Channel 4 or some such) on science but they (Simon particularly)<br/>
love watching his programs on What the Romans Did for Us, and What the<br/>
Victorians Did for Us, and all the iterations in between even though<br/>
he can&#39;t ask questions, even though it isn&#39;t personal, because on<br/>
television he can use a range of tools to demonstrate what he is<br/>
talking about, but in the lecture hall at the Life Science Centre in<br/>
Newcastle he had his power point slide presentation and his personal<br/>
charisma and that was it.  And without peanut gallery prices, we can&#39;t<br/>
afford to see that much theatre.  I love stage productions, but it<br/>
costs about 40 quid for a family of 4 to go to see the low end version<br/>
of Oliver, which I just can&#39;t justify that often.  <br/>
<br/>
So, to reiterate, the statement wasn&#39;t you should let your children<br/>
have porn because you let them read books; it was will you deny them<br/>
access to books because they might read pornographic material.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I choose not to offer television by not having one, but I don&#39;t stop<br/>
 </span></blockquote>my children from &gt; watching tv at other places.<br/>
<br/>
Do you often go to other places to give them the opportunity of<br/>
watching television?  Is it something that you help them to get access<br/>
to when they want it?  Do you recognize that it is your choice that is<br/>
being honored and not necessarily theirs?  <br/>
<br/>
David (dh) and I chose not to have cable or satellite television.  It<br/>
was based on economics.  We got the UK equivalent of Netflix for a<br/>
while but decided that both Simon and Linnaea enjoyed owning the DVDs<br/>
as much as watching them and that there was a certain desire to get<br/>
the most for our money by getting, watching, returning as quickly as<br/>
possible by David and myself that wasn&#39;t matched by Linnaea and Simon.<br/>
 So, when we left for the U.S. this summer we cancelled our<br/>
subscription.  While in the U.S. we stayed at many homes that had<br/>
cable.  Simon was held rapt by Toonami, by Nickelodeon, by Jetflix, by<br/>
Boomerang, by Cartoon Network.  He lounged in front of the television<br/>
for hours at my mom&#39;s house.  At my dad&#39;s vacation condo on the North<br/>
Shore, in between swimming at the falls, and skipping rocks on Lake<br/>
Superior, he would watch Teen Titans and Kim Possible and That&#39;s So<br/>
Raven and all the rest on their satellite television in the bedroom. <br/>
It made me realize that David and my economic choice was unfair to<br/>
Simon and to Linnaea.  So, when we got back we ordered Sky satellite,<br/>
only to discover that the way our house is we can only have the dish<br/>
on our chimney which is dodgy at best and with worries of the chimney<br/>
falling on the neighbors house it wasn&#39;t a route we took.  There isn&#39;t<br/>
cable in our deprived area, so not an option.  In the end, after much<br/>
adjustment of the antennae, we&#39;ve now got a television set box for<br/>
something called Freeview with what is called a Top Up TV card that<br/>
gives us Boomerang from 5am until noon and Cartoon Network from 6am<br/>
until 6am.  It isn&#39;t quite satisfactory, but it is the best we can do<br/>
in this house at this time.  And while Animaniacs can make everything<br/>
stop, particularly for me, the presence of some of the channels Simon<br/>
wanted have allowed him to satisfy his desire and given him the<br/>
ability to choose to watch or not watch with less desperation.  <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Why would you need to set limits?  Why is the presence of a television<br/>
something that would cause you to set limits?  And what is it about<br/>
sugar that produces the same response in you?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I watched television that disturbed me, frightened me, left me feeling<br/>

&gt;  remains vivid in my memory.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Why did you watch that television?  Why didn&#39;t you walk away?  I just<br/>
got Monty Python&#39;s The Meaning of Life last week.  There is a scene<br/>
with John Cleese playing a school teacher demonstrating sex with his<br/>
good lady wife in the classroom.  It was a scene that made Simon very<br/>
uncomfortable (and one that I warned him about moments before it came<br/>
up), so we skipped past it.  There is a scene where Terry Gilliam is<br/>
playing a man who filled in an organ donors card and has a couple of<br/>
donor harvesters come to his door to collect his liver.  It made<br/>
Linnaea uncomfortable so we skipped past it.  They didn&#39;t need to<br/>
watch it.  They were very capable of knowing what their limits were in<br/>
that moment.  And what they took away from the movie was the guy<br/>
blowing up from his wafer thin mint and the Every Sperm is Sacred<br/>
song.  Not the scenes they had me skip past.  And when David came home<br/>
from work they rushed the door to tell him about how the third world<br/>
is North Yorkshire (just a smidge south of us and an incredibly apt<br/>
take on the world of County Durham) and about how Brave Sir Robin from<br/>
The Holy Grail is in The Meaning of Life and nothing about how almost<br/>
seeing a scene that made them uncomfortable scarred them for life.  <br/>
<br/>
Right now they are talking about sperm whales and how when two males<br/>
are attempting to have sex with a ready female they will bash each<br/>
other about with their penises.  It was something we saw on a David<br/>
Attenborough program that stuck with them.  I didn&#39;t know that and I<br/>
don&#39;t think it was known before there were television cameras to know<br/>
it with.  Without the market of selling images to television there<br/>
wasn&#39;t enough money to support enough people in attempting to find out<br/>
more about sperm whales.  The conversation got to sperm whales because<br/>
while they&#39;ve been watching HiHi Puffy Ami Yumi Show they&#39;ve been<br/>
making whales with Hama beads that you put on plastic trays and then<br/>
iron together.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, are you limiting your children&#39;s exposure to new things based<br/>
on your negative experiences with them?  Was every moment of<br/>
television watching a miserable one for you?  Did you never walk away<br/>
from some show feeling better or having a greater grasp on something<br/>
in your own life than you had before you came to sit down and watch?  <br/>

rents them at movie store. TVs are everywhere: malls, restaurants,<br/>
waiting rooms, etc. We own many, many videos including tv serieses<br/>
that we watch on our computer. The computer and Internet have proven<br/>
to be a valuable resource for information and entertainment. It&#39;s true<br/>
that I and my husband don&#39;t desire, and so choose not to own a tv, but<br/>
if the kids purchase one or ask for one of their own someday, I<br/>
wouldn&#39;t necessarily be opposed. I feel strongly about protecting<br/>
their freedom to make their own decisions.<br/>
<br/>
They&#39;re 3 years and 7 mos old at this time. One could argue that the<br/>
Internet is no different for the variety of content, but at the girls&#39;<br/>
young ages, the tv poses more of a threat of disturbing content since<br/>
they don&#39;t necessarily interact with it to view that content. I don&#39;t<br/>
feel that I&#39;m doing them any disservice by not providing a tv, when<br/>
there&#39;s a whole world available for learning and enjoying. We have<br/>
what we have. My family didn&#39;t have computers or game machines when I<br/>
was a child.<br/>

children (at their current ages of 3 and 7 mos) if I provided them<br/>
with porn including the softcore content on tv or the gruesome<br/>
violence.<br/>
<br/>
Sugar is a drug. It is an unnatural non-food. I don&#39;t expect this to<br/>
be a popular standpoint, but it&#39;s what I think. Food is a whole<br/>
&#39;nother issue that I have strong feelings about. Yes, my children eat<br/>
sugar (although I feel guilty about providing it.) But, I don&#39;t fill<br/>
the house with it, and I hope that by providing healthy foods and the<br/>
knowledge of healthy eating and the way our bodies feel will help my<br/>
girls to respect their bodies and recognize the drug affect of simple<br/>
sugars and grain carbohydrates. They&#39;re both gluten-intolerant with<br/>
dairy, corn, and nut allergies, by the way, so food is something I<br/>
help them make choices about. Since about two-yrs-old my first<br/>
daughter has not resisted when I tell her that something is<br/>
&quot;tummy-sick.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I grew up eating whatever, whenever (no restrictions) not recognizing<br/>
that some foods made me sick, comfort eating, becoming overweight, and<br/>
nearly dying from anaphylactic reactions several times. There is a<br/>
spectrum between arbitrary control and protecting/helping when it<br/>
comes to being responsible in meeting our children&#39;s needs. I don&#39;t<br/>
want to restrict my children&#39;s food choices, but I want them to know<br/>
and recognize the difference between real, healthful food and &quot;things<br/>
we can eat.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &gt; I watched television that disturbed me, frightened me, left me feeling<br/>
&gt;  &gt; yucky, etc, from as young as I can remember. Some of that imagery<br/>
&gt;  &gt;  remains vivid in my memory.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Why did you watch that television?  Why didn&#39;t you walk away?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know, but I didn&#39;t.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  I just<br/>
&gt;  got Monty Python&#39;s The Meaning of Life last week.  There is a scene<br/>
&gt;  with John Cleese playing a school teacher demonstrating sex with his<br/>
&gt;  good lady wife in the classroom.  It was a scene that made Simon very<br/>
&gt;  uncomfortable (and one that I warned him about moments before it came<br/>
&gt;  up), so we skipped past it.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Interesting that you should mention that one. I remember it vividly.<br/>
My younger sister and I saw it on cable at our grandma&#39;s house when I<br/>
was about six. I didn&#39;t like it, but for reasons I don&#39;t now<br/>
understand, I was afraid to approach the tv screen. Grandma would not<br/>
have allowed us to watch it, but it came on while she was busy<br/>
preparing dinner. It was, however, less disturbing to me than the 80s<br/>
horror movies I remember.<br/>
<br/>
  There is a scene where Terry Gilliam is<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  playing a man who filled in an organ donors card and has a couple of<br/>
&gt;  donor harvesters come to his door to collect his liver.  It made<br/>
&gt;  Linnaea uncomfortable so we skipped past it.  They didn&#39;t need to<br/>
&gt;  watch it.  They were very capable of knowing what their limits were in<br/>
&gt;  that moment.  And what they took away from the movie was the guy<br/>
&gt;  blowing up from his wafer thin mint and the Every Sperm is Sacred<br/>
&gt;  song.  Not the scenes they had me skip past.  And when David came home<br/>
&gt;  from work they rushed the door to tell him about how the third world<br/>
&gt;  is North Yorkshire (just a smidge south of us and an incredibly apt<br/>
&gt;  take on the world of County Durham) and about how Brave Sir Robin from<br/>
&gt;  The Holy Grail is in The Meaning of Life and nothing about how almost<br/>
&gt;  seeing a scene that made them uncomfortable scarred them for life.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>While our family watched these horror movies, my little brothers held<br/>
pillows on their laps to cover their faces with as needed. I never<br/>
chose to do that though. I toughed it out. To this day, one of my<br/>
brothers gets visibly sick when he tries to watch a horror movie. I<br/>
choose not to watch them, but I have a visceral reaction to fear and<br/>
adrenaline without concrete basis. Somehow, though, I don&#39;t feel that<br/>
way when I read a horror story.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  Anyhow, are you limiting your children&#39;s exposure to new things based<br/>
&gt;  on your negative experiences with them?  Was every moment of<br/>
&gt;  television watching a miserable one for you?  Did you never walk away<br/>
&gt;  from some show feeling better or having a greater grasp on something<br/>
&gt;  in your own life than you had before you came to sit down and watch?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t think not having a tv is a limiting action any more than not<br/>
having a computer when I was a child was a limiting action by my<br/>
mother. We simply didn&#39;t have one. I enjoy many movies and television<br/>
shows, but I watch them when I want to on the computer. I don&#39;t<br/>
remember any television that was particularly meaningful to me as a<br/>
child, but there were a few movies like The Last Unicorn and Harold<br/>
and Maude that stuck with me.<br/>
<br/>
I know that the tv debate is not one that will be won on either side,<br/>
and I have no intention of trying. Frankly, I don&#39;t stand firmly on<br/>
either side. It&#39;s a complicated issue, and one that should be<br/>
discussed.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>You know, there may be an angle to the TV debate we&#39;re not addressing: <br/>
our own ages and experiences with media, and its evolving content and <br/>
standards.  I saw &quot;Meaning of Life&quot; in the theater, as a grown-up <br/>
married adult.  I my kids didn&#39;t see it until they were teens; in fact, <br/>
they watched it last weekend with a 19 y.o. male friend who&#39;d never <br/>
seen it, and I was kind of embarrassed &lt;g&gt;  I don&#39;t care much for <br/>
horror movies, and in fact did not see &quot;Alien&quot; when it came out and was <br/>
shocked my young niece had seen it.  The TV I grew up with was <br/>
Gilligan&#39;s Island and Star Trek (original) and MASH and The Ed Sullivan <br/>
Show (yes, I saw the Beatles).  Pretty tame stuff, compared to CSI and <br/>
Rescue Me and Desperate Housewives ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it gets back to the &quot;unschooling isn&#39;t unparenting&quot; idea: we have <br/>
to make some choices for our kids, especially ones as young as 3 years <br/>
and 7 mos.  I wasn&#39;t an unschooler when my kids were really young, and <br/>
I didn&#39;t strictly limit TV but we didn&#39;t have cable, either.  TV was <br/>
whatever the rabbit ears could pick up.  When I started watching E.R., <br/>
my kids were already in bed (yes, we had bedtimes then!); eventually, <br/>
my dd wanted to watch, too, so she&#39;d do that while ds played card games <br/>
with dad in another room.  E.R. was a little adult for dd, but it <br/>
brought up some social issues she might not have encountered since she <br/>
didn&#39;t go to school, and gave me an opportunity to talk about them.<br/>

Sugar is of plant origin, it does contain one essential nutrient (carbohydrate) and it is assimilated by the human body.  Therefore, sugar is a food.<br/>

To tell your children otherwise is to give them false information.  When they find out that you misled them about sugar, they will wonder what else you&#39;ve said that isn&#39;t true.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-486584070">&lt;&lt;&lt;I wouldn&#39;t feel that I was meeting my responsibility to protect my<br/>
children (at their current ages of 3 and 7 mos) if I provided them<br/>
with porn including the softcore content on tv or the gruesome<br/>
violence.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know any unschoolers who have provided their young children with<br/>
porn.  When my kids were 3 years old they liked Barney and Jay Jay the Jet<br/>
Plane.  They didn&#39;t like any shows that were geared toward adults and now at<br/>
ages 9 and 10 they only occasionally like shows geared toward adults.  The<br/>
shows that they like are horse training shows and things on the science<br/>
channel or history channel.  Just because other shows are available on TV<br/>
doesn&#39;t mean that young children will choose them.  But children who have<br/>
been limited in their choices often choose to watch things that they know<br/>
were limited *just because they can* at some point.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;Since about two-yrs-old my first<br/>
daughter has not resisted when I tell her that something is<br/>
&quot;tummy-sick.&quot;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If you are just providing her with information that is honest and she has<br/>
tried something and knows it makes her feel yucky, then she will not have<br/>
any reason to disbelieve you and she will feel like you are on her side. (if<br/>
given the information and the choice to do as she wants without guilt)  But<br/>
sugar doesn&#39;t make me sick and it doesn&#39;t seem to affect me like any drugs I<br/>
ever taken and if someone had told me that sugar was a drug then I would<br/>
certainly question what ever else they told me because that is not true for<br/>
me.  It&#39;s not a true fact and it certainly doesn&#39;t affect me like a drug. <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I grew up eating whatever, whenever (no restrictions) not recognizing<br/>
that some foods made me sick, comfort eating, becoming overweight, and<br/>
nearly dying from anaphylactic reactions several times.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand how you could not recognize that something made you sick.<br/>
Did you just not make the connection?  If my child ate a lot of something<br/>
and then felt sick, I might mention that it might be from eating too much.<br/>
I&#39;d give them information but in the end, I&#39;d let them make their own<br/>
decision.  That is how they will learn self control.  My kids have no need<br/>
for comfort eating because they are truly joyful and they aren&#39;t escaping<br/>
anything.  Were you?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; There is a<br/>
spectrum between arbitrary control and protecting/helping when it<br/>
comes to being responsible in meeting our children&#39;s needs. I don&#39;t<br/>
want to restrict my children&#39;s food choices, but I want them to know<br/>
and recognize the difference between real, healthful food and &quot;things<br/>
we can eat.&quot;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I really like one of the things that Sandra says often.  (paraphrasing)<br/>
Sweets eaten in joy are much better for the body and soul then fruits and<br/>
veggies eaten under duress or with guilt.  I&#39;d take the cotton candy in<br/>
peace and without judgment any day over something healthy eaten with someone<br/>
watching me to see if I was eating healthy.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;  &lt;&lt;Why did you watch that television?  Why didn&#39;t you walk away?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know, but I didn&#39;t.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But you might have if someone who had your best interests at heart was<br/>
sitting with you and saw your reaction and suggested to you that maybe it<br/>
was too much.  I wouldn&#39;t want my children to watch things that I felt might<br/>
be upsetting to them without my being there to help them through it.  It&#39;s<br/>
not about leaving them to their own devices.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, off to watch another episode of Little House on the Prairie with my<br/>
girls.  <br/>

<br/>
I think part of the problem in this discussion is that your children are<br/>
only 3 and 7 months. Many people speaking here have much older children,<br/>
have been well through the ages your children are, and are giving you<br/>
fabulous information...information I wish I had when my kids were yours&#39;<br/>
ages.<br/>
<br/>
I suggest you sit with the possibility that these posters have good points,<br/>
and they may actually HELP you in deepening your trust and relationships<br/>
with your children. They are truly unschooling, and sharing with you what<br/>
unschooling looks like.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know all the children on this list, but I do know that at least most<br/>
of them are delightfully respectful, happy, and nonviolent. I know mine are.<br/>
I get comments SO often about how awesome, creative and thoughtful my kids<br/>
are. That happened with unlimited TV, movies, books, crafts, animals and<br/>
food. They are all healthy, make healthy choices for themselves, and treat<br/>
each other well. I&#39;m not saying we did things perfectly here, but I do know<br/>
the connection between being there with my kids and allowing them the<br/>
freedom to choose everything in their lives and how incredible they are<br/>
right now.<br/>
<br/>
So if you do trust your children, notice what they like and what they don&#39;t,<br/>
be with them with what they choose, you are going to have a tremendous life<br/>
together. If you decide right now you are calling the shots, even if they<br/>
seem like really healthy shots, you will compromise the possibilities, imho.<br/>

I hurried off last night and didn&#39;t reply to your whole post. I wasnted to<br/>
address this comment too.<br/>
<br/>
For a 7 month old and a 3 yo, I think you are right.  They are very young<br/>
and not only do they not realize what kind of a resource and source of<br/>
entertainmetn TV could be for them one day, they also do not know what they<br/>
are missing.  But one day, quicker than you think, that will change.   When<br/>
it does, will you consider changing your mind or will you hold fast to your<br/>
rule.  When my kids were that small, we had a Tv, but I didn&#39;t get up and<br/>
turn it on for them without them asking for it and we watched very little.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was a kid, TV didn&#39;t have the range of channels and shows that are<br/>
available now.  I remember waiting until Sunday night to watch Mutual of<br/>
Omaha&#39;s Wild Kingdom.  Where else could you see all those wild animals up<br/>
close?  Certainly not near my house.  Now kids have Animal Planet and<br/>
National Geographic channel and don&#39;t have to wait all week to see wild<br/>
animals in their natural habitat.  (Among other things)  You can watch<br/>
people and animals give birth.  You can watch this new show we discovered on<br/>
The Science Channel on how things are made, where they tour different<br/>
factories,  you can bond over old re-runs of your favorite shows when you<br/>
were a kid. (Little house on the prairie) The choice are wide and varied.<br/>

It&#39;s not a rule. There&#39;s nothing to limit. If the kids want a tv<br/>
someday, sure, if the money&#39;s available, we&#39;ll make that decision as a<br/>
family. . . . I think what&#39;s happening here is that I say some things<br/>

<br/>
Also, I don&#39;t mind at all hearing others&#39; takes on the tv issue.<br/>
That&#39;s why I wrote about it in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
I do trust my children to do the best with what they know. As I<br/>
experienced as a little girl, we don&#39;t always know when to walk away.<br/>
We all learn through experience and come to these things. Yes! I trust<br/>
that my children will do this.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-584503463">I did send a long post on this topic some time ago.  I<br/>
thought it was worth spending the time to write it and<br/>
that it presented an alternate view on the tv &quot;issue.&quot;<br/>
 I was wondering if it didn&#39;t go through or what,<br/>
because I didn&#39;t get a single comment on it.  I don&#39;t<br/>
expect everyone to gather round and make me the center<br/>
of attention or anything, but it feels kind of like<br/>
being at a party and offering your thoughts or<br/>
feelings in a conversation and having no one look at<br/>
you or listen to you and act like you are not there<br/>
and they don&#39;t hear you.  I really was interested in<br/>
hearing what others had to say about what I offered on<br/>
the topic.  Normally I don&#39;t say anything about this<br/>
&quot;posting into the ether&quot; pehonmenon, but this has<br/>
happened to me a lot over the years and I just thought<br/>
I would mention it just this once and see if anyone<br/>
did see my message.<br/>
<br/>
ok, so anyway, I did have an additional comment to add<br/>
on this discussion.<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have broadcast tv, no cable, no rabbit ears. <br/>
We have dvds and tapes galore and all enjoy watching<br/>
movies and shows that way, usually together, on our<br/>
one tv.  Partly we don&#39;t have it because we don&#39;t want<br/>
it.  We decided not to have it years ago when we still<br/>
lived in town and had digital cable at that time<br/>
before we stopped.   However for the last 4 years<br/>
we&#39;ve lived in a place where we can&#39;t get tv, there&#39;s<br/>
no regular reception and no possibility of cable. <br/>
Well ok, we could if we paid for a sattelite dish and<br/>
the large monthly service fee for that, but we cannot<br/>
afford that and even if we could squeeze it into the<br/>
budget at some point in the future, we&#39;ve all<br/>
discussed it and choose to do other things with our<br/>
money.  Maybe that will change at some time, who<br/>
knows.<br/>
<br/>
Our kids are 7, almost 9 and 19.  They don&#39;t complain<br/>
about not having tv, wish for it, or feel like they<br/>
are missing anything.  They don&#39;t feel lost in<br/>
conversation with their friends due to lack of<br/>
braodcast tv, and neither do we.  We don&#39;t have a<br/>
whole lot of opportunities to see it other places, but<br/>
we do on occassion and we often don&#39;t like it. <br/>
Commercials in particular usually all of us can&#39;t<br/>
stand, although a few are clever and less annoying. <br/>
Our teen lived with a boyfriend and his daughter for a<br/>
while and hated how the tv affected their lifestyle<br/>
and the tv programming in general that she saw there. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not condemming tv.  We have one, we think there<br/>
are lots of great shows and information available on<br/>
it.  It&#39;s a tool, like any other, no more evil or<br/>
harmful than how it&#39;s used.  I&#39;m just presenting the<br/>
view of an unschooling household with unschooled kids<br/>
who don&#39;t live with broadcast tv.<br/>

they will only be this little for a very little period of time. I<br/>
think it is good that you say you will not discount their desires for<br/>
a television out of hand.  But maybe, just maybe, you should consider<br/>
bringing one into your household at some point.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>When Simon was 3 and Linnaea was 7 months we lived in Japan.  We had<br/>
Japanese television mostly in Japanese, but with the occasional<br/>
program in de Englishu.  The fact that he didn&#39;t understand what was<br/>
being said didn&#39;t keep Simon from enjoying television.  He loved Am<br/>
Pan Man a cartoon show with a hero who had a cookie for a head.  In<br/>
every episode the bad guy would somehow destroy his head and Am Pan<br/>
Man&#39;s baker father would have to bake him a replacement head.  There<br/>
were really interesting other characters like the toothpaste man and<br/>
the guy with a rice bowl for a head, the bad guys ate all the rice and<br/>
left him sitting with stars rolling around his head in the classic<br/>
dazed look. Late at night they ran Mr. Bean which I would tape so that<br/>
Simon could watch them the next day.  And they had Pokemon.  Pokemon<br/>
has been one of Simon&#39;s favorite shows ever since.  They would run the<br/>
new episodes at like 7 in the evening in English with Misty giving an<br/>
English phrase lesson at the end of the show, playing the dialogue in<br/>
Japanese and then again in English.  He never chose at 3 to watch<br/>
anything disturbing when he was 3.  And he still never chooses to<br/>
watch anything that disturbs him.  We saw Harry Potter and the<br/>
Prisoner of Azkaban at the cinema and the scene where Lupin becomes a<br/>
werewolf haunted him for a time.  When we were at a friend&#39;s house<br/>
this summer and they all wanted to watch the movie Simon walked out of<br/>
the room when the werewolf scene came up again. I called him back when<br/>
it was over.  Last night David (dh) and Simon wanted to watch The<br/>
Meaning of Life before bed, but Linnaea hadn&#39;t liked it all that much,<br/>
instead she chose to go upstairs and cuddle with me while watching Tom<br/>
and Jerry in the Magic Ring.  There isn&#39;t passivity in how they watch.<br/>
 If something disturbs me I walk out of the room, if something<br/>
disturbs them they walk out of the room or speak up or turn off the<br/>
television.  <br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t<br/>
&gt; feel that I&#39;m doing them any disservice by not providing a tv, when<br/>
&gt; there&#39;s a whole world available for learning and enjoying. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I can&#39;t access the whole world. I can&#39;t offer my children insights<br/>
into rural China.  I wouldn&#39;t have thought of The Grim World of Billy<br/>
and Mandy, nor would I have thought to offer it to them without<br/>
Cartoon Network. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; We have<br/>
&gt; what we have. My family didn&#39;t have computers or game machines when I<br/>
&gt; was a child.<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This sounds too much like &quot;what was good enough for me is good enough<br/>
for my children,&quot; which so often, in my experience, prefaces some sort<br/>
of unpleasant life experience like boarding school or living in a<br/>
council estate in the UK.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;  &gt; If I had a tv, I wouldn&#39;t feel right about setting limits.<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;  if there&#39;s sugar in &gt;the house, the kids get to eat it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;  Why would you need to set limits?  Why is the presence of a<br/>
 </span></blockquote>television<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; &gt;  something that would cause you to set limits?  And what is it about<br/>
&gt; &gt;  sugar that produces the same response in you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wouldn&#39;t feel that I was meeting my responsibility to protect my<br/>
&gt; children (at their current ages of 3 and 7 mos) if I provided them<br/>
&gt; with porn including the softcore content on tv or the gruesome<br/>
&gt; violence.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What is the pornography that you believe your children will seek out<br/>
if you get a television?  In the UK, late at night, on Channel 4 in<br/>
particular, there is soft-core porn.  Real Life in a Brothel or some<br/>
such, but neither Simon nor Linnaea have ever wanted to watch such a<br/>
thing.  I am sure the day will come when they will both be fascinated<br/>
with such programs but at 5 and 8 they just aren&#39;t curious about those<br/>
kinds of things.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I don&#39;t think not having a tv is a limiting action any more than not<br/>
&gt; having a computer when I was a child was a limiting action by my<br/>
&gt; mother. We simply didn&#39;t have one.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is a limitation. By not having a television you are choosing to<br/>
limit your children&#39;s access to certain media.  I don&#39;t know when you<br/>
were a child; I don&#39;t know what the economics of your childhood were,<br/>
but, your mother&#39;s choice not to have a computer was a limitation as<br/>
well.  David and my choice not to have a satellite dish put on our<br/>
chimney likewise is a limitation.  We are limiting the options of our<br/>
children&#39;s lives by deciding that the structural damage that might<br/>
ensue is something we don&#39;t want to risk.  Knowing that it is a<br/>
choice, and knowing why we&#39;ve chosen to limit the number of channels<br/>
we receive makes it an informed limitation.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Sugar is a drug. It is an unnatural non-food.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Sugar is in bread, in fruit, in sugar cane, in vegetables.  It is<br/>
natural.  But being natural doesn&#39;t make something good.  Smallpox is<br/>
natural.  E-coli is natural.  Heck, drugs are natural: beer,<br/>
marijuana, Psilocybe mushrooms, yakowana tree bark (which the Yanamamo<br/>
Indians use), to name a few. I wouldn&#39;t base your avoidance on natural<br/>
vs. unnatural things.    <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yes, my children eat<br/>
&gt; sugar (although I feel guilty about providing it.)<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guilt is an awful thing to offer with food.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Since about two-yrs-old my first<br/>
&gt; daughter has not resisted when I tell her that something is<br/>
 </span></blockquote>&quot;tummy-sick.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
What does that mean?  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes in the evening Linnaea will ask to have a glass of<br/>
caffeinated soda.  I will mention to her that sometimes caffeine makes<br/>
it hard for her to get to sleep which she has found frustrating in the<br/>
past.  If she still chooses to have the soda I won&#39;t stop her.  Is<br/>
that what you mean by telling her that something is &quot;tummy-sick&quot;?  Are<br/>
you giving her information so that she can make an informed choice? <br/>
The words &quot;not resisted&quot; makes it sound like if you say something is<br/>
&quot;tummy-sick&quot; and she says she still wants it you won&#39;t let her choose<br/>
to have it.<br/>

&gt;&gt;I didn&#39;t get a single comment on it.&lt;&lt;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This has happened to me many times too Nanci! I know what you mean that it<br/>
feels like you&#39;re being ignored. Rest assured from this end of the<br/>
connection that I either didn&#39;t see your post (I was offline for two months<br/>
with my ailing dad who has since passed away) or didn&#39;t have time to<br/>
respond, or didn&#39;t have anything to say. I&#39;m assuming that is the case with<br/>
most people in one way or another. If you look at it, there really are only<br/>
a handful or two of people who write regularly on this list, so that is<br/>
certainly a possibility.<br/>
<br/>
It also could just a matter of timing. For whatever reason, maybe the stars<br/>
have aligned in a way that people are contributing to this discussion now.<br/>
Just know that you are not being shunned!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;Partly we don&#39;t have it because we don&#39;t want<br/>
&gt;&gt;it.&lt;&lt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It seems to me that if each member of your family does not want TV, then you<br/>
are making those decisions well together. I think TV is a loaded issue with<br/>
many people and this list will prod a person to REALLY evaluate their<br/>
decisions about it. For many adults, it is a control issue, and those need<br/>
to be looked at in unschooling I think.<br/>
<br/>
We have four TVs and most of the time none of them are on. Sometimes all of<br/>
them are on, but that is extremely rare. At the moment, my 11 yo is watching<br/>
college football by himself (he just flipped on the TV and put it<br/>
on...clicked by a violent loud war movie, MTV, the news, various cartoons,<br/>
and settled on this). My husband is watching a History Channel special. My<br/>
15 and 16 yo sons are playing music together. My 13 you daughter is at the<br/>
movie theatre with friends watching &quot;In Her Shoes&quot; with money she earned.<br/>
The TVs were off for two days prior to this evening. That was lovely too.<br/>
<br/>
I think my kids know what works for them media-wise based on having freedom<br/>
and open discussions together. We have processed many a situation seen on<br/>
the screen...argumentative behavior, violence, teasing, sex, etc. None of it<br/>
has been taboo. AND, we know the difference between the TV running our<br/>
lives, and us running our lives.<br/>
<br/>
Jeez, I thought I was done writing about this...guess not!<br/>

&quot;tummy-sick&quot; means and feels like. That&#39;s why she doesn&#39;t &quot;resist&quot;<br/>
when I tell her something is tummy-sick, meaning that it contains<br/>
gluten or one of her other allergens. Any amount of gluten damages her<br/>
intestines and inhibits her ability to absorb nutrients. If I left the<br/>
decision up to her, she could die before she had accumulated enough<br/>
experience and reasoning ability to decide to completely avoid gluten.<br/>
If my daughter enjoyed the tast of glue or the smell of harmful fumes,<br/>
I&#39;d do more than simply inform her of the down side.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1995721012"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Sugar is of plant origin, it does contain one essential nutrient (carbohydrate) and it is assimilated by the human body.  Therefore, sugar is a food.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>&quot;Dr. Martin classified refined sugar as a poison because it has been<br/>
depleted of its life forces, vitamins and minerals. &quot;What is left<br/>
consists of pure, refined carbohydrates. The body cannot utilize this<br/>
refined starch and carbohydrate unless the depleted proteins, vitamins<br/>

in quantities sufficient to metabolize the carbohydrate in that<br/>
particular plant. There is no excess for other added carbohydrates.<br/>
Incomplete carbohydrate metabolism results in the formation of &#39;toxic<br/>
metabolite&#39; such as pyruvic acid and abnormal sugars containing five<br/>
carbon atoms. Pyruvic acid accumulates in the brain and nervous system<br/>
and the abnormal sugars in the red blood cells. These toxic<br/>
metabolites interfere with the respiration of the cells. They cannot<br/>
get sufficient oxygen to survive and function normally. In time, some<br/>

nothing else.<br/>
<br/>
But this isn&#39;t the place to bring reports that fill people with fear.  <br/>
It&#39;s a place to discuss how we can help our children explore the  <br/>

help parents help their kids explore cartoons when the parents don&#39;t  <br/>
care for them, and help the parents help kids explore their curiosity  <br/>
about guns and weapons when the parents are peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly I could undoubtedly dig up dozens of reports full of  <br/>
scientific words that have been touted throughout my nearly 50 years  <br/>
that have not panned out. I&#39;m not saying the report on sugar is wrong  <br/>
or right. But it&#39;s not a Mack truck. It&#39;s not a bottle of insecticide.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This all sounds scary. But what effect do you feel? What effect do  <br/>
you see in others? Will your children die before reaching adulthood  <br/>
if they eat sugar?<br/>
<br/>
Each of us has areas in our lives where we&#39;ve read something that  <br/>
sounds sufficiently worrisome that we alter what we choose for  <br/>
ourselves. I read about an aluminum connection with Alzheimers.  <br/>
There&#39;s no conclusive evidence -- and maybe it&#39;s all been refuted  <br/>
since -- but why take the chance with aluminum cookware and  <br/>
antiperspirants when 1) there are other choices and 2) my decision  <br/>
isn&#39;t preventing others from making different decisions?<br/>
<br/>
We will all through our lives weigh the pros and cons of various  <br/>
things we hear and *choose* whether or not to make some sacrifice in  <br/>
order to get something we think is better (sacrifice your own  <br/>
consumption of sugar for your belief that it will prevent certain  <br/>
degenerative diseases in your case). That&#39;s very different than  <br/>
someone deciding for *you* that *you* will make a sacrifice in order  <br/>
to get something that *they* think is better for you.<br/>
<br/>
I can see why you would choose not to eat sugar. But even if your  <br/>
children eat a lot of sugar for the next 18 years they will not die  <br/>
before they&#39;re old enough to read the pros and cons for themselves  <br/>
and make a decision about sugar for themselves.<br/>
<br/>
See it from your children&#39;s point of view. Your children are seeing a  <br/>
world of children and adults eating sugar freely. The children are  <br/>
happy and look to all intents and purposes healthy. The children  <br/>
aren&#39;t dying. And there you are standing between your children and  <br/>
things that they want to try with a lot of scary reports that say  <br/>
sugar is poison and that the world is too scary to play freely in.  <br/>
Children need an adult who can understand science to tell them what  <br/>
is safe and what is unsafe. Children can&#39;t do it on their own. They  <br/>
can&#39;t trust what they see: Those children are sick. They&#39;re on their  <br/>
way to degenerative diseases.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing for your husband to decide he&#39;s not going to watch his  <br/>
favorite genre of movies because he&#39;s read something about brain  <br/>
chemistry changes that occur and he thinks it&#39;s worth the sacrifice  <br/>
to give up something he likes to get something he believes is  <br/>
better.  It&#39;s an entirely different thing for him to decide you can&#39;t  <br/>
watch those movies either because he wants you to have what he thinks  <br/>
is something better.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think this is a nonissue. The discussions aren&#39;t about whether or  <br/>
not to have a TV. The discussions are whether or not to allow  <br/>
children access to TV.<br/>
<br/>
There is a huge power difference between adults and children.  <br/>
Children are well aware of it even if parents try their best not to  <br/>
exploit it.<br/>
<br/>
If a home doesn&#39;t have a TV because the parents don&#39;t want it -- and  <br/>
especially if the parents don&#39;t like it -- that&#39;s a huge barrier  <br/>
between children and TV. It may not feel like a barrier to the  <br/>
parents. They can *say* &quot;If the kids want it, we&#39;ll discuss it,&quot; or  <br/>
even &quot;If the kids want it, we&#39;ll get them one,&quot; but it isn&#39;t the same  <br/>
situation as a family just not having broadcast TV because of  <br/>
location or finances or truly mutual choice. They may outwardly look  <br/>
the same, but inwardly the children don&#39;t have the same freedom of  <br/>
choice.<br/>
<br/>
Last month we were a non-car magazines owning family but when my  <br/>
daughter saw an exotic car magazine at the grocery store we bought  <br/>
it. Since then we&#39;ve become a 2 car magazine owning family.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s not the same situation as having a parent who is  <br/>
philosophically against cars or against conspicuous consumption not  <br/>
owning any car magazines. If I were such a parent I might project  <br/>
openness by *saying* she could have any magazine she wants, but my  <br/>
beliefs would be a barrier between her and things that went against  <br/>
my beliefs. She would know wanting a magazine full of flashy cars  <br/>
felt somehow wrong.<br/>
<br/>
The TV discussions aren&#39;t about whether or not TV is necessary in  <br/>
order to unschool. The discussions are about helping our children  <br/>
explore the world freely. They&#39;re about being our children&#39;s partner  <br/>
in their exploration rather than their director. They&#39;re about being  <br/>
aware of how our own beliefs can be a barrier to our children&#39;s free  <br/>
exploration. (We can give them that freedom but it takes a lot of  <br/>
awareness to hold strong beliefs while having a stronger belief our  <br/>
children have a right and need to explore and hold their own beliefs.)<br/>
