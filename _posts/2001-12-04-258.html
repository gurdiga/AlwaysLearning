<div id="ygrps-yiv-88573132">I have been reading all the &quot;math&quot; posts, mainly because I am a <br/>
nib :) don&#39;t want to miss anythng, (on this list anyway :)). I am <br/>
LOUSY at math :) BUT! I have this book :) The World Treasury of <br/>
Physics, Astronomy, and Mathematics. I bought a Looooooong time ago, <br/>
thinking that I would read it, (like I have the time ), and I might <br/>
benefit from it..... I am much older and I have realized that I will <br/>
not read it, especially since my interest has wandered else where <br/>
with my kidlets and all :) So, back to my original thought ;) This <br/>
book I have, I have no need for, and if anyone is interested in it I <br/>
am willing to send it free of charge......I just dont need it and <br/>
although I LOVE books, it isnt something I will read. Any of you math <br/>
people :) are welcome to it! Just let me know!<br/>
