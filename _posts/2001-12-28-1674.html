<div id="ygrps-yiv-241935611">I just saw a commercial on tv for a show called Domino Days on ABC <br/>
(channel 7 for me) tomorrow night (Friday) at 9pm PST.  It looked really<br/>
neat where a bunch of people get together and design these huge<br/>
elaborate domino designs only to knock them down!<br/>
