 </span></blockquote>Hi all -<br/>
I just wanted to add to Joyce&#39;s comments about how amazingly mysteriously <br/>
children and all people can learn.....<br/>
<br/>
I have 2 Deaf parents and 4 brothers....my parents do not speak....we <br/>
communicate strictly through ASL.....When the family was just my older <br/>
brother and me, all 4 of us signed to each other.....eventually twins joined <br/>
the family and a fourth brother and we went off into preschools too.....I <br/>
don&#39;t know if any of those factors are relevant but somehow, we all learned <br/>
to speak English &#39;fluently&#39;....we received no formal instruction in English <br/>
and we did not get spoken English access in the home....MAYBE some tv but <br/>
this was long ago!<br/>
<br/>
This scenario has happened gazillions of times in other families.....<br/>
<br/>
my point is that altho we can&#39;t explain HOW it happens, we can clearly see <br/>
that it DOES.....<br/>
<br/>
Similarly with reading, math, etc....People learn, period.  We can&#39;t explain <br/>
it.  <br/>
<br/>
Schools act like they&#39;ve got it figured out and profess these grand reading <br/>
&#39;programs&#39; but it is clear that not ALL children learn with any method.  <br/>
Perhaps the children who learn during the time of the method&#39;s use really <br/>
learned DESPITE the method....??  <br/>
<br/>
I try to get away from the hows and whys and just look at the end results <br/>
historically.....what has proven to be true?  <br/>
<br/>
imo, it has been proven to be true that children have learned to speak and be <br/>
around people and read and use numbers and be compassionate and loving <br/>
without attending schools or doing &#39;school at home&#39;....<br/>
<br/>
Have a nice day....<br/>
Jane<br/>

  Welcome Noelle!  I had to laugh when I read this.  I&#39;ve been unschooling for years and I&#39;ve never read any unschooling books either!  I love the lists and I&#39;m on several, but I just don&#39;t care for non-fiction books all that often.  I guess we are living proof that you can learn to do something in many different ways and that you don&#39;t have to open a book if you don&#39;t want.  I am glad that books are available for those who want to read them.  I&#39;m sure they help some people get to unschooling.  I&#39;m just glad to hear I&#39;m not alone in never having read John Holt.  I&#39;m glad he wrote his books, but I&#39;m also glad my kids and I can enjoy a RU lifestyle without my having to read them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1515501691">Hi Ann, thanks for the welcome!! :)  I have heard about so many people<br/>
turning to unschooling after reading books on the subject, and that&#39;s<br/>
fabulous.  And I&#39;m a book lover to my core.  I would probably find the books<br/>
interesting and enlightening even though I&#39;m already dedicated to<br/>
unschooling, but I have such little time to read for myself with three young<br/>
kids, that I like to use that time reading things that are new to me.  It&#39;s<br/>
the same way with being a vegetarian to me...once I made that decision, I<br/>
didn&#39;t need to read any books on the subject to encourage me.  When my<br/>
choices come from the heart, I generally don&#39;t need anyone affirming them.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I&#39;m not misunderstood...I am in no way disregarding the importance of<br/>
the books on the subject of unschooling.  I&#39;m certain a lot of them are<br/>
fabulous, and I do hope to read some of them when I have more time, but my<br/>
point was that I didn&#39;t &quot;need&quot; a book to help me decide to unschool...simply<br/>
hearing about the concept was enough to hook me!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for writing, Ann.  Glad to be in the same boat with ya! :)<br/>

I haven&#39;t read EVERY John Holt book.  Half of them, maybe.  Recently  <br/>
I bought an obscure one for Deb Lewis because she&#39;s reading all of  <br/>

say: &quot;It&#39;s an idea group and is intended to lean more toward pure<br/>
unschooling than neutral, general homeschooling discussion�there are<br/>
hundreds of general homeschooling discussions for newcomers. It&#39;s to focus<br/>
more toward how people learn no matter where in the world they are, rather<br/>
than on what&#39;s legal in any particular country or jurisdiction.&quot;<br/>

so I thought it would be a place I could learn from and enjoy.  So I can<br/>
only answer for myself, but that is my the answer to the question you posed.<br/>

understood by reading his books, I&#39;m sure I would leave the list.  And if<br/>
the moderator wants me to leave because I haven&#39;t read the books, then she<br/>

exception of Learning All the Time, I liked the other Unschooling <br/>
books I have read way better.  I liked the real life descriptions in <br/>
The Unprocessed Child and Homeschooling Our Children, Unschooling <br/>
Ourselves -- they gave me a real notion as to what unschooling would <br/>
look like and feel like, beyond the theory.  And I felt like I got <br/>
more appicable information out of Alfie Kohn&#39;s books regarding <br/>
trusting my children -- and he isn&#39;t even writing &#39;unschooling&#39; <br/>
books.  Besides, some of Holt&#39;s stuff is getting out-dated (Teach <br/>
Your Own and Instead of Education), and he makes a few parenting <br/>
comments that really rubbed me the wrong way.  Of course I recommend <br/>
him to anyone, but I just wanted to express my feelings on <br/>
why &quot;people would join a list&quot; with Holt mentioned in the <br/>

Well he wasn&#39;t a parent!  And he never unschooled. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

But still his ideas were seminal and helping all this come about.  If  <br/>
it hadn&#39;t been for him and other late-60&#39;s, early 70&#39;s school  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1155128346">Hi,<br/>
I thought I should introduce myself.  I am Teresa, I have one child, <br/>
Ben who is 11, and also has a diagnosis of PDD, NOS, on the autism <br/>
spectrum.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Minnesota.  My son didn&#39;t go to school until he was in 2nd <br/>
grade.  There was a new charter school that seemed to have a program <br/>
that might work for Ben.  <br/>
<br/>
He was really stressed out most of the time (which makes me feel <br/>
bad), but he did also get something out of it, like a best friend, <br/>
and learned a few things.  I was nervous about sending him and ended <br/>
up spending most of the day at the school volunteering so I could <br/>
take a peek periodically and see how he was doing.<br/>
<br/>
So he went to this school for a few years.  This last year, his best <br/>
friend got angry with Ben for some reason, and decided he wasn&#39;t <br/>
going to talk to him anymore.  He got a few other students to join in <br/>
on the ignoring.  Most of the class was giving him the cold shoulder, <br/>
acting like he wasn&#39;t there.  My son was becoming sadder and more <br/>
withdrawn and I didn&#39;t know why.  He tried to tell me, and actually <br/>
did a pretty good job, but I didn&#39;t understand how serious it was, or <br/>
realize how much it affected him.  I feel horrible I didn&#39;t pull him <br/>
sooner.<br/>
<br/>
The school didn&#39;t notice it was happening, and when it was finally <br/>
figured out, they refused to do anything about it.<br/>
<br/>
So, I decided I needed to pull him out.  I hated seeing what was <br/>
happening to him, to his self worth and feeling of emotional safety.  <br/>
For many months it seemed he was afraid I would abandon him too, like <br/>
his best friend.  He is still quite clingy, and needs to know where I <br/>
am or be with me all the time.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to keep him out of school.  I need to learn more about <br/>
unschooling, but it really appeals to me.<br/>
<br/>
We practice attachment parenting, but haven&#39;t been able to find any <br/>
other families who have children on the autism spectrum who also <br/>
parent this way.  <br/>
<br/>
I was just wondering if there is anyone on the list who has a child <br/>
with autism or special needs who is also unschooling, that would be <br/>
willing to share with me a bit of their story and how things are <br/>
working out for them.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  <br/>

Once you&#39;re outside the school system there is no need for those<br/>
labels. Many of us have children who would have probably been slapped<br/>
with a label but we choose to simply live our lives free of all that.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling works for any and all children. The same philosophies<br/>
apply, even though the way it plays out and the needs of each child<br/>
are so very different.<br/>

hadn&#39;t heard the term unschooling back then, but she says that&#39;s how <br/>
she raised him.  He never had anything forced on him, including <br/>
special programs for autistic kids or school of any kind.  She just <br/>
let him do whatever came naturally for him at the time.  I think <br/>
unschooling works for everybody.  It worked beautifully for him.  <br/>
He&#39;s 39 now, and he&#39;s a Production Engineer for Turner Broadcasting.  <br/>
He&#39;s been working with the same people since he was 18 years old.  He <br/>
became an Engineer through apprenticing rather than college.  Also, <br/>
his mom never, ever told him he had autism or dyslexia when he was <br/>
growing up.  Her famous line for his autistic behavior was, &quot;Oh, <br/>
everybody has their quirks.&quot;  I certainly didn&#39;t think there was <br/>
anything &quot;wrong&quot; with him when I met him.  <br/>

Yes.  There are some, and I&#39;ve known some in person whose kids are  <br/>
big now, late teens or young adults.  They&#39;re &quot;ahead of the game&quot;  <br/>
compared to kids who went to school and were teased and shamed and  <br/>
shunned for thirteen years.  Just that alone, the avoidance of the  <br/>
social troubles, might be enough basis for a choice, but you&#39;ll see  <br/>
more advantages as time passes.<br/>
<br/>
Treating a person as a whole person makes a whole world of difference.<br/>
<br/>
Try to stop using the labels, and you&#39;ll be a giant step closer to  <br/>
not thinking the labels.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1743061252">Christi,<br/>
What a wonderful story you have shared, thank you!  Very <br/>
inspiring.        <br/>
<br/>
My son was quite severely autistic when he was young.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>
capable of conversations; he just echoed back words and phrases he <br/>
had heard in Disney movies and books I had read him.  What he echoed <br/>
never fit the situation.  He spent all day either jumping up and <br/>
down, or rocking back and forth flapping his hands.  He never <br/>
responded to his name and tantrummed almost all day long.  He wasn&#39;t <br/>
having tantrums because I had told him &quot;no,&quot; but because of something <br/>
inside of him that I didn&#39;t understand at the time.  He didn&#39;t know <br/>
how to play, had no imagination.  He was just sort of locked inside <br/>
himself.<br/>
<br/>
Finding out he had autism helped point me in the right direction to <br/>
help him.  He didn&#39;t get the diagnosis until he was almost 4.  His <br/>
doctor, like many pediatricians at the time didn&#39;t know much about <br/>
autism either.  Shortly after I changed his diet, took out all gluten <br/>
and dairy and artificial ingredients, as is recommended by some (not <br/>
mainstream) for children with autism.  He started talking <br/>
spontaneously after this diet change, no echoing after 2 weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Play therapy helped me learn how to join him in his world and connect <br/>
with him, so he could join our world.  I met an amazing person, a <br/>
therapist, who taught me how to play with him, how to connect with <br/>
him.  I played with him every moment possible.  Slowly, but surely <br/>
over time he started to blossom and his imagination started to grow.  <br/>
Now his imagination is enormous and he loves to play.  However he <br/>
still struggles with playing by himself.  He always wants me or <br/>
someone with him, which is fine because I love keeping the connection <br/>
strong.  <br/>
<br/>
I can see the great value in not having labels, in their affect on a <br/>
person&#39;s self esteem.  People are people; we all have our different <br/>
ways.  <br/>
<br/>
But for us, the diagnosis gave me a jumping point, a place to look to <br/>
help him feel better, to be able to connect with him.  I wouldn&#39;t <br/>
have thought to look to a diet to help him, or have known about the <br/>
play therapy, or met the person who taught me how to do it, if I <br/>
didn&#39;t have the label autism to start with.  I saw many children at <br/>
his school who couldn&#39;t have conversations, and did all the things my <br/>
son used to do.  I am certain that without the diet and the play <br/>
therapy, he&#39;d still be doing those things, and be locked inside.<br/>
<br/>
Now, at this point, he is considered &quot;high functioning.&quot;  I am <br/>
excited to move to the next step and help him grow more and blossom <br/>
by doing what he wants to do.  The label was relevant also for <br/>
school.  In fact they made it central.  Now we are at a place where <br/>
we can slip off the autism label and he can just be Ben.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all who responded to my initial email!  I would really love <br/>
to hear from someone else who has experienced this first hand.  I <br/>
have had one wonderful email from such a person, and would like to <br/>
get more, if there are any others out there. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Teresa<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But labels can also help with communication, support and research. When they realized that I was dyslexic, I got the support that I needed, which was different from what I would have needed if I had a different issue. Right now I am starting to get hot flashes. I need that label to try and figure out ways of dealing with them. I can use the label to identify what is going on, research options and then figure out what I want to do about it. (the I is bolded) My middle son did a Myers-Briggs inventory. He scored 100% extrovert. The person who did the inventory had never seen anyone who was as strongly extroverted on that scale. I haven&#39;t either. A good friend of his is an introvert. They know that about each other and it helps their friendship to be able to communicate their needs. When my son is at their house and his friend needs time to himself, my son hangs out with the brother and sister. Everyone wins because they identify and communicate their needs and the labels help them do that.  <br/>
<br/>
When labels are used to demystify, explain, get support, provide insight and help, they are good. When they are used to discriminate, judge, exclude, put down or ridicule, they are bad. It isn&#39;t the labels that are bad. The labels are what they are; they are descriptions. It is how they are used that is good or bad. <br/>
<br/>
When someone on the list used the label &quot;autistic behavior&quot; or &quot;autism&quot;, I had a good picture in my head about the kinds of issues that they are dealing with. Same with the label dyslexia. Using the label &quot;unschooler&quot; helps me to find other families with a similar learning and parenting philosophy. I use the label proudly, but others may use it in a derogatory manner. I don&#39;t share the label of my religion because I worry about people&#39;s reaction. It isn&#39;t my religion or even the label that I have a problem with, it is the reaction of others. <br/>
<br/>
And don&#39;t get me going on gay rights. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-434676262">I have a 6 year old son with a dx of Aspergers Syndrome. He acquired <br/>
this label at 3 years old, before we discovered unschooling, never <br/>

only is it possible to radically unschool a child with an autistic <br/>
spectrum dx but that it was, in fact, my DS that led us to radical <br/>
unschooling.  Mainstream parenting simply didn&#39;t &quot;work&quot; and DH and I <br/>
were forced to take a long, hard look at our son and our parenting <br/>
assumptions. I knew DS would not survive in school, so keeping him at <br/>
home was the first step for us. Punishment looked cruel when clearly <br/>
he couldn&#39;t help his behaviour, trying to get his attention focussed <br/>
on something that wasn&#39;t his agenda was nigh on impossible and  you <br/>
get the picture. The long , hard look led to research and the <br/>
discovery of radical unschooling and, while still learning, we have <br/>
not looked back. Our younger DS (age 3) may well have &quot;issues&quot; too, <br/>
but we have never sought an outside opinion and he has always been <br/>
radically unschooled to the best of our (improving) abilities. Both <br/>
sons are now thriving, as are both parents.<br/>

Had you been unschooled, it would have made no difference.  Dyslexic  <br/>
kids learn the same way anyone learns, with unschooling.  They learn  <br/>
to draw and to read and to write in a way that works for them.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Right now I am starting to get hot flashes. I need that label to  <br/>

<br/>
Maybe.  But you don&#39;t need to refer to yourself as heat-regulatory  <br/>
disabled.<br/>
Here&#39;s how to deal with hot flashes:  Keep a hand fan nearby.  Put an  <br/>
electric fan by your bed so you won&#39;t be blaming your husband or the  <br/>
builders of your house when it&#39;s suddenly way too hot at 3:00 a.m.     <br/>
Realize that the hot flashes only last a few moments and it&#39;s not  <br/>
going to kill you.  (It will feel like it might sometimes, but try  <br/>
not to whimper and whine or freeze the rest of your family out, as I  <br/>
do sometimes with the car&#39;s air conditioning.)  Turns out Prozac  <br/>
helps, so for those prone to depression, they might want to use  <br/>
Prozac through the up seasons too, to deal with the hot flashes for a  <br/>
few years.  (It&#39;s less invasive than hormone replacement therapy, I&#39;m  <br/>
pretty sure.)<br/>
<br/>

because they identify and communicate their needs and the labels help  <br/>
them do that. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Both extroverts and introverts can get jobs and hold positions of  <br/>
responsibility and be in mainstream activities.  Neither of those  <br/>
labels sets anyone in a problematical category.  Neither is &quot;special  <br/>
ed.&quot;<br/>

&gt; &gt; You need a label to be able to say &quot;Hey, I need a little space.&quot; or<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Hi Teresa,<br/>
<br/>
My 12 year old son Jeffrey was diagnosed with Aspergers.  My other 2 <br/>
children, Allison 10 yrs. and Claire 16 yrs. are not on the <br/>
spectrum.  They all respond positively to the unschooling lifestyle <br/>
because it allows each of us to be who we are, labels or not.  <br/>
<br/>
Jeffrey&#39;s day doesn&#39;t look that much different from his sister&#39;s <br/>
day.  They each pursue their own thing.  Jeffrey does prefer being in <br/>
his room alot while his sisters like to be in the family room with <br/>
everyone else.  He plays video games, builds his Lego creations and <br/>
surfs the &#39;net on his computer.  He comes out of his room every so <br/>
often to give me a hug and tell me something cool he&#39;s found either <br/>
in a game or online.  I have had people tell me that what I&#39;m <br/>
allowing him to do will prevent him from being successful as an <br/>
adult.  But they feel that way about homeschooling in general.  <br/>
Jeffrey is still very young.  I don&#39;t worry at all about preparing <br/>
him for his future.  I trust he&#39;ll let me know what help he needs as <br/>
he finds his own path.  <br/>
<br/>
My 16 year old has really taken off with making plans for the <br/>
future.  She&#39;s working with great enthusiasm and is really enjoying <br/>
herself.  But this is the first time I&#39;ve seen her really serious <br/>
about pursuing something specific.  I believe it&#39;s age and maturity.  <br/>
Jeffrey simply isn&#39;t ready to make major decisions about college or <br/>
work plans.  He has plenty of time for that.  And the same goes for <br/>
my 10 yr. old daughter Allison.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-81422561">But the point about labels is not that they should *never* be used.  They<br/>
work best when we find things that we understand to be about ourselves.  Not<br/>
the other way around.  We don&#39;t want to do the labeling work for someone<br/>
else.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, my parents wondered if the differences they were having with<br/>
me might be due to mental retardation!  They said this out loud in my<br/>
presence and it had a strong impact on how I felt about myself for years.  I<br/>
had trouble getting along with family sometimes, for whatever reason, and to<br/>
have it put in those terms made me doubt myself, not feel like I had a label<br/>
that fit my problem.  Just gave me pause and gave me doubt to carry around<br/>
for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Even saying that someone is gifted can have this effect.... if the &quot;gifted&quot;<br/>
child doesn&#39;t see him/herself that way.  It can give one a reason to doubt<br/>
oneself, for no other reason than that others have some opinion that isn&#39;t<br/>
shared.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s most helpful to give someone tools that might empower others ... like a<br/>
child who needs more large muscle activity (whatever the label s/he would<br/>
like to have) just needs opportunities to move more freely and in a larger<br/>
space when possible.<br/>
<br/>
An external label only helps if a person feels an affinity with it.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; Try to stop using the labels, and you&#39;ll be a giant step closer to not<br/>
&gt; &gt; thinking the labels.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But labels can also help with communication, support and research. When<br/>
&gt; they realized that I was dyslexic, I got the support that I needed, which<br/>
&gt; was different from what I would have needed if I had a different issue.<br/>
&gt; Right now I am starting to get hot flashes. I need that label to try and<br/>
&gt; figure out ways of dealing with them. I can use the label to identify what<br/>
&gt; is going on, research options and then figure out what I want to do about<br/>
&gt; it. (the I is bolded) My middle son did a Myers-Briggs inventory. He scored<br/>
&gt; 100% extrovert. The person who did the inventory had never seen anyone who<br/>
&gt; was as strongly extroverted on that scale. I haven&#39;t either. A good friend<br/>
&gt; of his is an introvert. They know that about each other and it helps their<br/>
&gt; friendship to be able to communicate their needs. When my son is at their<br/>
&gt; house and his friend needs time to himself, my son hangs out with the<br/>
&gt; brother and sister. Everyone wins because they identify and communicate<br/>
&gt; their needs and the labels help them do that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When labels are used to demystify, explain, get support, provide insight<br/>
&gt; and help, they are good. When they are used to discriminate, judge, exclude,<br/>
&gt; put down or ridicule, they are bad. It isn&#39;t the labels that are bad. The<br/>
&gt; labels are what they are; they are descriptions. It is how they are used<br/>
&gt; that is good or bad.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; When someone on the list used the label &quot;autistic behavior&quot; or &quot;autism&quot;, I<br/>
&gt; had a good picture in my head about the kinds of issues that they are<br/>
&gt; dealing with. Same with the label dyslexia. Using the label &quot;unschooler&quot;<br/>
&gt; helps me to find other families with a similar learning and parenting<br/>
&gt; philosophy. I use the label proudly, but others may use it in a derogatory<br/>
&gt; manner. I don&#39;t share the label of my religion because I worry about<br/>
&gt; people&#39;s reaction. It isn&#39;t my religion or even the label that I have a<br/>
&gt; problem with, it is the reaction of others.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; And don&#39;t get me going on gay rights.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-916314911">Thank you for sharing this, Alison!  I so agree with you about the <br/>
cruelty of punishment when a child either can&#39;t help it, or feels he <br/>
or she has no other choice.  Your story is inspiring.  I imagine your <br/>
experience with your oldest son will serve you well with your <br/>
youngest.  I wish you and your family the best.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
