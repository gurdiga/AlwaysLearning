<div id="ygrps-yiv-1865439954">It&#39;s not the first time, but there was a homeschooling family on Wife  <br/>
Swap the other night.  Not just homeschooling, but SCA, it seemed.   <br/>
Marty and Holly called me to look. Marty said &quot;Re-enactors.&quot;  I  <br/>
looked a minute and said &quot;SCA,&quot; and he asked why I thought so.  Only  <br/>
the SCA combines the Renaissance with belly dancing.   But they  <br/>
didn&#39;t mention the SCA as far as I heard, and when the dad named the  <br/>
places the kids get out and are with other people, he said hiking and  <br/>
gaming conventions.  No mention of feasts or tournaments.  Maybe they  <br/>
were involved in Renaissance Fairs; that&#39;s possible.  He didn&#39;t  <br/>
mention those either.  They did play D&D at night (and Marty pointed  <br/>
out that it was the original D&D book, nothing current or recent).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway...<br/>
They traded that mom (who was portrayed as somewhat of a nut, and I  <br/>
don&#39;t know how much editing or coaching goes on to edge them nutty- <br/>
ward) with a mom who was a teacher and had a second job in a  <br/>
restaurant (doing books and cooking, apparently; not cooking books, I  <br/>
don&#39;t think &lt;g&gt;).<br/>
<br/>
Much embarrassment ensued, and the school-focussed family ended up  <br/>
adapting more from the homeschooling family than the other way  <br/>
around.  The mom cut down on her hours, quit her second job or  <br/>
something, and the family was spending time together which the kids  <br/>
seemed happy about.<br/>
<br/>
Marty was saying &quot;We should be on this show!&quot;   Holly and I were  <br/>
saying &quot;NO, not possible.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
While they were sure they could handle some other mom&#39;s rules for a  <br/>
week, I wasn&#39;t sure I could handle some other family&#39;s... FAMILY for  <br/>
a week.   Marty said &quot;They&#39;d probably switch you with some lawyer or  <br/>
something.&quot;   Yeah, that&#39;s not too bad, but if I had to go to a job  <br/>
where I had to dress up, wear heels, MAKE-UP...  Yuck. &lt;g&gt;   Marty  <br/>
said I could really change some people&#39;s lives doing that switch.   <br/>
Uh...  Yeah, but maybe not.  They could probably just edit me to look  <br/>
nutty, old, crazy...   And the mom who traded with us would have to  <br/>
go online every day and talk to people about unschooling.  (Oh!  That  <br/>
would be fun for you all to discuss with her what my kids were  <br/>
accustomed to, and to remind her to be quiet until Holly wakes up  <br/>
naturally. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
For years and YEARS we had no monday-through-friday schedule, except  <br/>
that Keith usually worked then and not on weekends, but for most of  <br/>
four years, Keith worked in Minnesota, not from home.  He&#39;d be home  <br/>
ten days a month, and those were fun days, and the rest were fun,  <br/>
unscheduled days too.   Since December, though, both Kirby and Marty  <br/>
have worked exactly and precisely Monday through Friday, and not on  <br/>
weekends.  WEIRD.  So now they can tell weekends from weekdays for  <br/>
the first time ever, and I can too.  It&#39;s just me and Holly mid-days,  <br/>
and Holly&#39;s usually asleep.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the schooly family only stayed home from school one day, and  <br/>
on that one day the mom was trying to get the teenaged boy to make  <br/>
some boots for his costume (she had them wearing Renaissance  <br/>
costumes).  That made sense to me, because their costumes came from a  <br/>
costume shop, and he was wearing goofy jester&#39;s shoes, and I wouldn&#39;t  <br/>
blame  him for not wanting to wear them.  So it seemed she was  <br/>
helping him make some better shoes, but that made the dad mad because  <br/>
it wasn&#39;t academic.<br/>
<br/>
Weird.  Weird ideas, weird that the producers so sadistically find  <br/>
families SO different.  I hope the participants make good money doing  <br/>
that.  It seems like a dangerous shake-down of peaceful situations to  <br/>
me.  And it&#39;s not really WIFEswap, it&#39;s mom-swap.  The husband  <br/>
probably hardly ever sees the visiting mom and where does she sleep?   <br/>
Where does he sleep?  Where does the filmcrew sleep? &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Holly likes the glimpses into other people&#39;s lives.  I feel I&#39;ve seen  <br/>
enough weird families to last me, starting with my own weird  <br/>
relatives on my mom&#39;s side.  But Holly loves the social peeks.<br/>

They would probably switch you with some neat freak and she would get rid of all your cool stuff while she was there.<br/>
<br/>
They always seem to choose polar opposites for that show!<br/>

<br/>
My kids and I both love to peek into other people&#39;s lives by watching shows<br/>
like Wife Swap and Trading Spouses.  I am pretty sure they edit them by<br/>
taking the most extreme thing someone utters over the course of a week and<br/>
focusing on that.  They try to make the families look as nutty as possible<br/>
which is one reason I would never go on one of those shows.  I would find it<br/>
facinating to swap, but I would never leave my kids with someone who I did<br/>
not know for a week or two weeks, esp. someone with completely opposite<br/>
parenting ideas from mine.  <br/>
<br/>
If I had to choose one of those families to be, I would definitely choose<br/>
the homeschool family, although they were portrayed at anti-social with no<br/>
friends on the one hand, (the dd had her first ever friend over for dinner)<br/>
but in another scene at the beginning they had a party with some of their<br/>
reenactment friends and showed them around a lot of people. But they were<br/>
very close to each other and they seemed very respectful of the kids,<br/>
although the did still have to do school work for 3 hours per day.<br/>
<br/>
The school focused mom actually told the reenactment family that every time<br/>
they mentioned the middle ages that she would smash one of their game pieces<br/>
and she did do one, to which the older boy (handsome boy too) challenged<br/>
her, &quot;are you going to pay for that?&quot;  That woman was SO RUDE!  She thought<br/>
it was ok for her to be rude because she was an adult, but it certainly<br/>
wasn&#39;t ok for the son to challenge her back.  (even though she was so in the<br/>
wrong)  Fortunately, I am not around people who have so little disregard for<br/>
children because I would certainly challenge them. I wouldn&#39;t be able to<br/>
help it.  <br/>
<br/>
But the thing is, (and I felt this way about the homeschool dad) that I am<br/>
fairly articulate in writing, but when I am challenged verbally, I have a<br/>
hard time articulating what I am trying to say, esp. if I&#39;m under fire.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Lots and lots of editing.  My sister-in-law is an editor, she worked<br/>
on the first American Wife Swap, and she says they are almost nothing<br/>
like they turn out.  It is so important to manipulate the image to<br/>
make the story.  <br/>
<br/>
And it is weird because editing makes all docu-drama stories, we were<br/>
watching the most recent David Attenborough narrated wildlife show<br/>
that runs for 45 minutes and then they put the DVD extras on<br/>
(presumably it is so it can fit on network television in the U.S.) for<br/>
the last 15 minutes, the behind the scenes stuff.  They&#39;d done a story<br/>
about snow leopards that began with the mother leopard chasing down a<br/>
mountain goat, but in the diaries section the big chase scene was the<br/>
last bit they filmed.  So the whole set up had been contrived by the<br/>
editors to make a more appealing setup for the viewer.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow.  Lots of editing, and you don&#39;t get to choose how you and your<br/>
life is presented.<br/>

Hey, maybe Marty&#39;s right!  I should be on that show!<br/>
<br/>
Holly reminded us last night of one when the show was new (and  <br/>
might&#39;ve been the other similar show) in which a family had lots of  <br/>
crazy pets, wandering through the house, including a kangaroo.  The  <br/>
trade mom packed them all up in crates into a truck and sent them  <br/>
away on the week that was to be done by her rules.  Holly figures the  <br/>
show paid to have them cared for for that week.  Poor pets!  Poor  <br/>
kids who might&#39;ve been afraid they&#39;d never see them again.  So I  <br/>
guess if she packed me up it would be sorted and stored.<br/>
<br/>
One of you should try it first. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1589857262">Our family talked about the possiblity of  participating in one of these <br/>
shows.. My son decided that he didnt want me to becuase they always have a normal <br/>
mom and a psycho mom..  he figured that since I am the normal mom , they would <br/>
be stuck with the psycho one.  LOL   I have to say I am glad I was picked as <br/>
the normal mom.  :)  sometimes you are not sure which one you are. LOL <br/>

==============================<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, My kids had a good idea.  They said the best thing to do is lie like a<br/>
rug to the producers and make yourself out to be a controlling neat freak<br/>
who makes their kids tow the line.  You&#39;ll get &quot;matched&quot; with a nice relaxed<br/>
person and then you can go about your swap being nice and unschooly.  &lt;eg&gt;<br/>
