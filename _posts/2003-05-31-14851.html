<div id="ygrps-yiv-2122247460">Someone in our local SCA group is organizing live music for Renaissance <br/>
dance.  Keith/dh has been involved in the discussions.  He downloaded (or whatever) <br/>
and printed out the music from where she deposited it online, and played <br/>
through it all.  It was fun hearing him play from the other room, just long <br/>
stretches of him sight reading.<br/>
<br/>
Various people have volunteered info on what instruments they can play, and <br/>
the organizational meeting is coming up.  There&#39;s been a discussion on the list <br/>
with someone who plays two middle eastern instruments and wants to see if <br/>
they&#39;ll fit in at all...    Here&#39;s a paragraph, and then the effect some fairly <br/>
innocuous little thing had on me.  See if you can guess what made me twitch! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Sounds like fun.  I will come on Sunday, June 8 and we will see what<br/>
<br/>
happens.  I can read music but very slowly.  I am better at improvisation.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know much about western music theory though.  My training is Middle<br/>
<br/>
Eastern.  I can be taught, however.  I look forward to to putting a name<br/>
<br/>
with your face.&quot;<br/>

and below here&#39;s what I just mailed to my husband for him to read at work <br/>
Monday:<br/>

<br/>
If this were anywhere NEAR an unschooling discussion, I would say &quot;How about <br/>
changing that to &#39;I can learn, however,&#39; which puts the responsibility of <br/>
discovery on your and not on others to lead you through a body of knowledge you <br/>
haven&#39;t wanted before now?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
To &quot;I can be taught&quot; I can only think &quot;BY WHOM!?&quot;  Whose job is it to &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
her and how much money will they be paid?<br/>
<br/>
Sheesh...<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m ruined for normal dialog. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
