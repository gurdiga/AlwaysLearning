<div id="ygrps-yiv-568904236">I just finished Sandra&#39;s, &quot;Big Book Of Unschooling&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you, Sandra for taking the time to write the book.<br/>
It is so practical and full of warmth at the same time.<br/>
The structure is so easy for a mom of a three year old to read.<br/>
I read a few pages at a time either on the train, or in between things I was doing with Logan.<br/>
It was also fun to read snippets to my husband.<br/>
He was intrigued when I read him your quote from a comic book artist, and how your son enjoyed Shakespeare with you, (my guy is a comic book geek, and Shakespeare fan).<br/>
I finally got Logan into the bath after a long hiatus. I jumped in with a bunch of trays of ice cubes as per your suggestion, it was irresistible, and he couldn&#39;t wait to get in the tub.<br/>
<br/>
It was also fun to see that one of my posts about a wonderful day Logan and I had, in the book.<br/>
<br/>
While reading the book I started noticing things that we do that remind me we are on the right path. Since Logan is only 3 I realize we have so much to learn, we are newbie&#39;s on this Unschooling path.<br/>
<br/>
I feel like I could write all night about how much fun we are having, but I don&#39;t have much computer time these days, so I&#39;ll make it brief.<br/>
<br/>
Manners: We don&#39;t teach or tell Logan to say, &quot;Please, thank you or your welcome&quot;, but he does, not every time, but many times. The thing that pleases my husband and I is that we know he means it when he says it. <br/>
<br/>
TV, DVD&#39;s, computer time: He goes through phases, sometimes more TV, sometimes no TV, and he wants us to read books to him all day. We just hang with him no matter what he wants to do that day. He really likes the &quot;Backyardigans&quot; on NICK. They have an episode about baking, &quot;The Great Pie&quot;. After that, Logan told me he wanted to bake blueberry pie. I went out and bought all the ingredients, and he helped me make the whole pie. He especially enjoyed the egg wash. We had a very shiny crust, lol. Before that he had no interest in baking or cooking.<br/>
BTW, when he watches TV, he&#39;s also talking, running, dancing, jumping, rough housing with us, or playing with some other toy too.<br/>
<br/>
Food: We love the monkey platters. We give Logan lots of choices on the platters throughout the day, so he always has something he enjoys eating. He also has a cabinet with his favorite snacks, and he really enjoys having knowing he can always get something he wants. When I leave the house I usually ask him if there is anything he wants, he gets a kick out of it, and it gives me pleasure too. Many times he&#39;ll choose fruit or vegetables over sweets or chips.<br/>
<br/>
Love: Our son is so loving to my husband and I. Constantly hugging us and saying he loves us. I feel so overjoyed every time he looks in my eyes and I see his trust and love. It&#39;s off-putting for some people, (some family members and friends) whom he doesn&#39;t jump into their arms, he has a few trusted adults that he adores and is affectionate with. They play with him the way he likes to play, they get him! I love my mom, but I don&#39;t make Logan kiss her goodbye. He&#39;ll do it when he&#39;s ready.<br/>
<br/>
There is so much more I could say, I felt so inspired and full of gratitude after reading the book that I wanted to share.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing, a recent quote of Logan&#39;s, &quot;If the moon eats too much, it&#39;s a full moon.&quot;<br/>

Cool!  Tell him my older son, Kirby, is the model for a new comic book  <br/>
character called Kendall Dood (Kirby&#39;s name is Kendall Kirby Dodd).   <br/>
The name and appearance are based on real Kirby, but the being a time- <br/>
travelling surgeon... that was creative license. &lt;g&gt;  It&#39;s not  <br/>
available to see yet, though I got to see one page when Kirby was home  <br/>
in January.  The writer isn&#39;t the artist, but he sent photos of Kirby  <br/>
to the artist, and the character did look like him.<br/>

When it&#39;s seeable, I guess that might be the place to find out.<br/>

That&#39;s really sweet.  Thanks for writing all that up for the list, and  <br/>
for the kind words about the book, too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1075344933">I feel like joining in on the praise and say that I will have to place<br/>
another order for Sandra&#39;s book! My mom was visiting for a few weeks and<br/>
wanted to know more about our homeschooling and unschooling. I gave her<br/>
Sandra&#39;s book and she couldn&#39;t put it down. I thought my mom was very<br/>
traditional and set in her ways, and expected some kind of criticism or<br/>
judgment, but no. She observed our way of life with an open mind.<br/>
<br/>
Now the book has found a new home in Norway, and I&#39;m hoping it will keep<br/>
traveling!<br/>

Awesome.  I&#39;m glad she was able to feel better about your  <br/>
unschooling.  And Norway!  Cool.  One was sent to Denmark last fall.   <br/>
Nice.<br/>

How fun that Kirby is &quot;in&quot; a comic book.<br/>
<br/>
My husband has been looking for an artist to collaborate with him on a  <br/>
comic book for years.<br/>
I wish I could do it for him, but it&#39;s not the type of art I do.<br/>
