They took out the last names.   It&#39;s called &quot;Out of Pink Crayons&quot; and talks <br/>
all about Kirby and Marty and Holly.  The picture/patch is the zia, the flag of <br/>
New Mexico, kind of a red sun on yellow.<br/>

I&#39;m too lazy to go up a flight and a half of stairs, find the book, find what <br/>
page, but look, here&#39;s the quilt.  We&#39;re three down, four across.  What a <br/>
lame quilt block I made, huh?  &lt;g&gt;  (Not lame for New Mexico, but some of those <br/>
others sure too, more artistry and effort.)<br/>

&lt;&lt; I was intimidated by<br/>
it, really.  I could never keep the schedule some of those folks do!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Then I discovered unschooling someplace on-line, and felt much better! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I know, our chapter is buried in among the many, many (many) structured<br/>
homeschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
I wrote about needing to buy pink crayons for kids who were coloring Power<br/>
Rangers. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

Bad binding, or someone tore it out or cut it out??<br/>
<br/>
If it&#39;s bad binding, I bet you could go to the website and get a replacement.<br/>
