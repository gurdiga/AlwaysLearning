<div id="ygrps-yiv-1145295633">I&#39;m pulling this out of the thread on sleep because its a different topic. Someone wrote:<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;My son who is Autistic used to like to be up late in the middle<br/>
&gt; of the night <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My first reaction was &quot;why isn&#39;t he just your son?&quot; Is the autism somehow relevant to the topic? Lots of kids go through phases of being awake late at night - why isn&#39;t this child simply a child? <br/>
<br/>
It probably wasn&#39;t the parent&#39;s intention to write something dehumanizing, but that&#39;s the danger of seeing a person through the lens of a label - it becomes appallingly easy to frame everything about that person in terms of the label. Sometimes even &quot;child&quot; can be too much of a label, when it gets in the way of seeing human reactions and motivations. <br/>
