<br/>
We met with some unschooler friends to talk about their unschooling<br/>
life, and he later said to me that just isn&#39;t enough structure for him.<br/>
He said something like, &quot;Just living your life and learning things as<br/>
they come up, that&#39;s great, and I want the kids to do that, but it just<br/>
isn&#39;t enough. There also needs to be some plan in your mind of where<br/>
you want to get, and some measurable goals.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-=--<br/>
<br/>
First off, I&#39;d have him define &quot;GOALS&quot;---what are HIS goals for your <br/>
children?<br/>
<br/>
Does HE have some plan of where he wants them to &quot;get&quot;---and how would <br/>
HE make  that happen?<br/>
<br/>
The problem, which he will find &lt;g&gt;, is that there is no way to predict <br/>
any of that. The other problem is that *your* and *his* goals may not <br/>
be those of your children. What would he do/how would he feel THEN, <br/>
when he finds that he&#39;s made all these plans towards this goal that <br/>
were unnecessary or damaging to his relationship with them?<br/>
<br/>
How many adults feel that they are disappointments to their parents <br/>
because they aren&#39;t doctors or lawyers?<br/>
<br/>
Every day they live, your childen are learning. Every day, they are <br/>
working towards the goal of happiness and towards satisfying needs that <br/>
THEY have (not yours).<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
He also said something that I thought was interesting: &quot;Anytime I&#39;ve<br/>
tried to accomplish something, or see someone else try to accomplish<br/>
something, having no plan or goal just does NOT work well. It leads to<br/>
sloppiness, and to things you hoped would happen never getting done, or<br/>
going in circles with where you want to head, that kind of thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Exactly WHAT do he think the plan or goals should be?<br/>
<br/>
It is automatically assumed that a child who loves animals should <br/>
become a veterinarian. BAD goal---not because it&#39;s not a worthy <br/>
profession, but because that&#39;s the ONLY profession people think of. The <br/>
GOAL should be loving more animals, learning to care for them, being <br/>
with them. If the child *wants* a profession in veterinary medicine, <br/>
great---but there are HUNDREDS of other animal-related careers--just <br/>
put on your thinking cap! Plus---maybe the child just simply LOVES <br/>
animals---there doesn&#39;t have to be a career involved! Just animals to <br/>
love.<br/>
<br/>
Your PLAN for that child shouldn&#39;t be latin and greek and biology and <br/>
chemistry (unless the child likes these things!). It should be <br/>
accepting more animals in your home. Making arrangements to visit more <br/>
animals. Finding opportunities to BE with animals. Finding more <br/>
animal-knowledgable people for that child to hang out with. If that <br/>
theads to a career in animals, gret. If it leads to a life filled with <br/>
the things that child/adult loves (more animals)---that&#39;s even better!<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=<br/>
The reason I thought that was interesting was that, in general, I have<br/>
found that to be true for me as well. Usually when I approach<br/>
something, whether it&#39;s the laundry or a career change, I have some<br/>
sort of goal or plan - or even steps to follow - in mind.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
Would you set up a CURRICULUM to get you to that point? Or would you <br/>
surround yourself with like-minded people, with the best tools you can <br/>
afford, with as many opportunities to try that thing?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s about IMMERSING your child in his passion---that should be your <br/>
plan.<br/>
<br/>
And keep in mind that it could *change*  tomorrow. Children can be <br/>
fickle! What&#39;s fascinating today can be old news tomorrow. Be flexible <br/>
and willing to change gears at his whim.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
So ... I&#39;m wondering how much &quot;intentionality&quot; or &quot;planning&quot; is, or<br/>
should be, or could be, involved in unschooling. Surely it&#39;s not years<br/>
of just wandering aimlessly with no structure, goals, hopes, or plans<br/>
of any kind.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
I plan to follow their leads. I intentionally smooth the path in front <br/>
of them.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing &quot;aimless&quot; about what they are interested in at any <br/>
given moment. THEY have purpose and goals. Maybe long-term, maybe not. <br/>
But *I* am here today wo help them get where they are going TODAY!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>At a homeschool conference Mary Hood suggested writing out your goals for where you want you children to be when they are 18.  If you look at the big picture, you won&#39;t worry so much if they aren&#39;t reading until they are 8 or if other kids can add and subtract and they can&#39;t or whatever.  She also suggested  &quot;unschooling&quot; (she didn&#39;t use this term though) until the kids are about 13.  You don&#39;t have to worry about what they are learning until then.  By that time they are old enough to make plans for their future and decide what they want to do.  Then they have 5 years to &quot;fill in any gaps&quot;  <br/>
If they are &quot;behind&quot; in any subject that they want to learn they have 5 years to learn it before they are an adult.  Hopefully by that time they still have an appreciation for learning and continue to grow and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Mary Hoods books are really good.  She is not an unschooler, she is a relaxed homeschooler.  So some of her thoughts may be different, but her books are wonderful.  <br/>

What a nice thing to read on NOT back to school day!<br/>
<br/>
Saturday at the kid&#39;s soccer game I heard some lady talking to some girl <br/>
about school, the girl said her school started Monday (which is today), and <br/>
the lady said, oh, you&#39;re gonna have FUN! you&#39;re gonna have FUN! My first <br/>
thought was, how the hell does she know that? I didn&#39;t think school was <br/>
supposed to be  *fun*.  I never had *fun* in elementary school, (just the <br/>
opposite, I remember a lot of bad things like when I snuck into class and <br/>
changed a grade in the teacher&#39;s book, and once hiding in a storm drain <br/>
because I was scared to go to a summer school class), middle school was a <br/>
nightmare, high school I did have fun cutting class, skipping school, or <br/>
getting high at lunch.  Somehow I don&#39;t think that lady had that in <br/>
mind.  In retrospect maybe she was trying to convince the girl, brain wash <br/>
her, to believe that being incarcerated in a government institution would <br/>
be fun. What, I wonder, is her definition of fun?  This morning I called my <br/>
school-age boys over and said, today, you are NOT going to school, and <br/>
you&#39;re gonna have FUN!!! They grinned.<br/>
