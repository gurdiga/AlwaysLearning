<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516895045">Dan, I asked my son about your situation.  Here is his advice.<br/>
<br/>
If the guy is not a jerk at the club, if he&#39;s not excluding people, and<br/>
if you went there to learn about robotics, and he can give you what you<br/>
need, then keep going.  <br/>
Sometimes you have to separate the man from the job.<br/>
You should tell your son in case he wouldn&#39;t feel the same way. <br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s what a soon to be ten year old has to say on the subject. <br/>
<br/>
Dylan thinks everyone can change and be better.  <br/>

<br/>
I think separating the man from the job is what being non-prejudicial is all <br/>
about.<br/>
<br/>
If a woman is turned down for a job just for being a woman, that&#39;s not right. <br/>
 If an Asian is turned down for a scholarship just because he&#39;s Asian, that&#39;s <br/>
wrong.  If a teacher refuses a student for being Hispanic, that&#39;s wrong.  <br/>
<br/>
So... If a ten year old rejects a teacher because he&#39;s gay (not obviously, <br/>
you&#39;d have to look at his website and guess from a link to a support site) is <br/>
that bad?<br/>
<br/>
But if the parents believe homosexuality is a biological truth and not &quot;a <br/>
choice,&quot; then they should encourage the child the stay there rather than to <br/>
be unreasonably prejudiced.  <br/>
<br/>
What if a teacher had an anti-gay site (like any of thousands of religious <br/>
websites?)<br/>
<br/>
What if the California robotics teacher had an anti-English site (because his <br/>
mom was in Northern Ireland, or because he was in a bagpipe marching band and <br/>
was still angry with England about stuff 500 years ago), but the family&#39;s <br/>
grandmother lives in England?<br/>
<br/>
What if the family was republican, the grandfather was the majority leader in <br/>
the California state senate, and the teacher was a fundraiser for the <br/>
democrats?<br/>
<br/>
Where is the line at which a parent will set a thirteen year old down for a <br/>
serious talk (darn, I forgot how old Matthew is) and say, &quot;Son, we have to <br/>
talk.  Your robotics teacher might have a belief which would prohibit us <br/>
leaving you in his custody if we die.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And again, if there are other robotics teachers to choose from, the weights <br/>
of factors change.<br/>

others, really scary and maybe even dangerous. ( Geez, he could be my<br/>
mother! ) <br/>
  <br/>
If you&#39;re a woman or gay or Asian, you haven&#39;t chosen those things, you<br/>
just are. <br/>
 <br/>
If you&#39;re prejudice, that&#39;s a choice, a character thing.  If you don&#39;t<br/>
like prejudice people, are you prejudice?<br/>
<br/>
Perplexing.<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s not I think Matthew should be spared an ugly thing.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe I think it&#39;s like hitting someone to teach them not to hit.<br/>
<br/>
Dan found something. He&#39;s not totally sure what he&#39;s found.<br/>
<br/>
Matthew&#39;s learning robotics from a guy who is generously sharing his time.  <br/>
<br/>
Dan COULD bring up prejudice, but not without BEING prejudiced.<br/>
<br/>
And yes, there is a difference between being a racist and being white, <br/>
although this one guy can&#39;t tell the difference, and who knows WHY he&#39;s <br/>
racist?  That might be another question to ask.  I&#39;ve talked to some people <br/>
with some strong prejudices who had reasons behind it--violence, rape, some <br/>
trauma or another followed by insult.  <br/>
<br/>
And the line between what is done by choice and what is inavoidable/natural <br/>
will be different for different people, homosexuality being a HUGE (broad, <br/>
unclear) line of demarcation.  How about birth control?  Would a family cease <br/>
to associate with a piano teacher because they found she had donated money to <br/>
Right to Choose or Planned Parenthood?   How about religion?  Are people just <br/>
BORN Baptist or Catholic, or do they CHOOSE to be that?  Are people just BORN <br/>
Hindu?  Are people just BORN Jewish?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;If you&#39;re a woman or gay or Asian, you haven&#39;t chosen those things, you<br/>
just are. <br/>
 <br/>
&lt;&lt;If you&#39;re prejudice, that&#39;s a choice, a character thing.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If a ten year old is prejudiced, is it his choice?  Parental influence?  <br/>
Youthful ignorance and trust? (in friends/neighbors/robotics teachers?)<br/>
<br/>
When does childhood end and &quot;character choice&quot; begin?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the situation and I did indeed separate the man from the job. This<br/>
has allowed us to gain the benefit of his robotics acknowledge.  I kept<br/>
thinking of that dozens of people I work with that I have suspicions about<br/>
not exactly sharing my view life.  I&#39;m forced to work with them to keep my<br/>
job.  And I&#39;m not about ask that real strange guy down and receiving if he&#39;s<br/>
a Nazi. We all have our beliefs and each is entitle to their own.  The guy<br/>
in question never once promoted his ideas outside the field of robotics.  It<br/>
was *me* that wandered outside the subject when I decided to cruise his web<br/>
site. <br/>
I haven&#39;t told my son about it.  I think I&#39;m being chicken or maybe just<br/>
overprotective, but it really shook me to the bone.  It was very unsettling.<br/>
I didn&#39;t want my son to have to go through that.  Maybe he should? I haven&#39;t<br/>
talked to the guy about because I&#39;m afraid of what he might say.  If he<br/>
tells me in a face-to-face confrontation about the subject that he has<br/>
strong feelings and promotes the ideas I will be forced to disassociate<br/>
myself with him.  Maybe that&#39;s the heart of my question.  Was this a good<br/>
life opportunity to discover the ugly side of behavior? Am I letting a good<br/>
opportunity to learn about a bad aspect of Society slip by? I certainly have<br/>
my guard up around this guy. When the meetings break up into individual<br/>
discussion and Matthew wants to talk to him I make a point to be by his<br/>
side. I&#39;m not worried about Matthew&#39;s health or safety.<br/>
<br/>
All this wondering, the what if-ing, particularly from Sandra, has got me<br/>
thinking.  If his beliefs were promoting an anti-gay or anti Iranian or anti<br/>
northern European, rather than the generalized anybody-but-white, I might<br/>
have a different reaction.  I have very close friends that gay or Iranian or<br/>
from northern Europe.  I know my son and I have daily interaction with<br/>
people who are homophobic.  But they don&#39;t promote these ideas publicly.  If<br/>
they do, and I have any kind of control of the situation, I will take them<br/>
to task.    I would do the same with this white supremacists horse hockey if<br/>
he promoted it in my presence. If he was a pedophile I would call him out in<br/>
front of the group.     So is this a cop out?<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, at these meetings the room is full of teachers, this guy is just one<br/>
of them.  I do find myself going to the others if there&#39;s an option.  I even<br/>
find myself looking at this guy&#39;s hair style and thinking it looks like<br/>
Hitler&#39;s. And no, I wouldn&#39;t leave Matthew in his custody if we die.  There<br/>
are too many Iranian and gay people ahead of him on that list.&lt;G&gt; And yes,<br/>
the link is the trigger to this whole problem for me.<br/>
<br/>
Deb L, I like your son&#39;s advice.<br/>
<br/>
Nancy, One never does know. But I don&#39;t buy the passing interest argument,<br/>
not without some kind of disclaimer.<br/>
<br/>
Dar, there are very few non-whites in this club. This guy has ever spouted<br/>
anything at these meetings outside the area of robotics.<br/>
<br/>
And on another subject,<br/>
Kelly, yes I will be careful for what I wish for. The message count was up<br/>
to 77 by this morning.  So far I think I can handle it. &lt;G&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Ikes! I&#39;m going to be late for work!<br/>

learn that some people have a hidden ugly side (and you&#39;re not positive this<br/>
is so) or that he learn more about robotics from a good teacher?<br/>

locked up for violent crimes who were themselves victims as children.  We<br/>
still hold them accountable for what they do as adults. ( and more<br/>
recently, as children, too.) <br/>
<br/>
If a man was beaten as a child and grows up to beat his own children,<br/>
does he have a valid reason?   Is that nature or character choice?  Do we<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Most white people have experience with lots of white teens so they aren&#39;t<br/>
going to associate all white teens with the behavior of one bunch of white<br/>
teens.<br/>
<br/>
If a white guy were beaten up by a bunch of black teens and the only other<br/>
associations he had were the TV reports and TV images of black teens then<br/>
that would just reinforce the associations he had.<br/>
<br/>
If a black guy living in a black neighborhood were beaten up by that bunch<br/>
of black teens, he&#39;d be in the same position as the first example. He&#39;d have<br/>
had lots of prior experience with a variety of black teens so his experience<br/>
with one bad bunch wouldn&#39;t be extended to them all.<br/>
