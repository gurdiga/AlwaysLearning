<div id="ygrps-yiv-1087623928">I have two requests.  One is that if anyone is planning to buy a book soon, please do it before February 7, as I&#39;m leaving town for two weeks and Keith will not be able to mail books for me.  **<br/>
<br/>
The other is actually more important and pressing.<br/>
<br/>
If any of you are the typo-marking type, the page-turned-down AHA! sort, and if you know of typos in The Big Book, please let me know.  I have two marked in my book, but would not be surprised if there were a few more.<br/>
<br/>
If you have the very first edition (look inside the front, and if it says Good Vibrations Conference Edition--and if you want to trade it for another one, we can do that)....   never mind.<br/>
<br/>
IF (this is embarrassing) someone just recently or in the near future gets one that says Good Vibrations Conference Edition and it has a bunch of marks on pages, that&#39;s mine.  I&#39;d like to have it back and send you a new book and a Free Prize (of some sort).   When my shelf fell down <br/>

it is possible that my personal copy of the first edition went into a package.  I would feel terrible if I sent someone a first pass with the typos marked.  YUCK!  <br/>
<br/>
On page 10, there should be a space between Rules and discourage.<br/>
I have one on page 223 (live should be lived).<br/>
<br/>
Any more?<br/>
<br/>
**Holly has said if Keith can advise her, she can mail books while I&#39;m gone.  That is a possibility, but books bought before the 7th and after the 22nd get better handling with no trouble to the guy who&#39;s having a shoulder replaced.  :-/  Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1564113308">I&#39;ve never been very good at saying &quot;Buy my book!&quot; but today would be a good day for it if you were considering getting one anyway.<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Big-Book-Unschooling-Sandra-Dodd/dp/0557181550">http://www.amazon.com/Big-Book-Unschooling-Sandra-Dodd/dp/0557181550</a><br/>
<br/>
In a couple of days, Amazon will charge me by the cubic foot of storage, and the Big Book honestly is big.  <br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re not in the U.S., buy it whenever you want to (though I think your parenting might benefit from having it).  Amazon does print-on-demand in Europe and Australia and maybe Canada.  But Americans get print-on-demand from lulu.com, and Amazon is selling paper copies I shipped to them.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s why to buy it from me today if you&#39;re in the U.S.:  If you don&#39;t have Amazon prime and you don&#39;t want to wait a week for media mail, nor to pay so much for priority.<br/>
I send all mine from the house by priority and you&#39;ll have it in a day or two or three depending how far from Albuquerque you live.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  <br/>

And the link I left out :-)<br/>
<br/>
First request:  Buy it from Amazon<br/>
<br/>
Plan B:  Buy it from me here:<br/>
