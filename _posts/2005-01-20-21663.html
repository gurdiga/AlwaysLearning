<div id="ygrps-yiv-295607252"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;It would be expensive to take all the courses in<br/>
&gt;order to find out if they&#39;re something you&#39;d feel ok<br/>
&gt;about linking to.  <br/>
<br/>
&gt;If you linked to their course and they&#39;ve crappy<br/>
&gt;information it could tarnish your reputation or call<br/>
&gt;into question the integrity of the rest of your<br/>
&gt;site.   <br/>

product or service, it&#39;s a no brainer that they had<br/>
better be prepared to offer some of their<br/>
product/service gratis to said potential endorser so<br/>
that the endorser can make a value judgement about<br/>
whether it&#39;s something they would like to endorse.  If<br/>
they are not willing to make their product (their<br/>
course) avialable for you to peruse for free, then<br/>
they can&#39;t expect any endorsement from you, not even a<br/>
quote on their website, let alone a link on yours, and<br/>
they should ask &quot;satisfied customers&quot; for their<br/>
endorsements instead, since they have sampled the<br/>
actual wares.<br/>
