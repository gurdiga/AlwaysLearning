<div id="ygrps-yiv-1187796804">Hi Sandra,<br/>
I hope this message is okay to post here.  I&#39;ve been off-loop for quite a while.  This morning, I picked up Moving a Puddle for the first time in about a year.  I just wanted to thank you for sharing your essays.  Every time I read them, I get something out of them.  It is one of my very favorite books.  I really enjoy and appreciate your insights and the stories you share ...<br/>

Thanks!  I think these will look different on re-reading as children  <br/>
get older and moms and dads have more experience with unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For anyone who bought The Big Book of Unschooling, finished it, and  <br/>
wished there had been some more, there&#39;s Moving a Puddle.  The Big  <br/>
Book was written all as a set of summaries, last spring and summer.   <br/>
Moving a Puddle was written over the years from when Kirby was nine to  <br/>
the time he was 18 or 19.  It&#39;s a collection of almost all the  <br/>
articles I had had published by newsletters and magazines up to that  <br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
$15 and postage. Christmas is coming. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Because of the realities of the post office, I can&#39;t combine the two  <br/>
books by priority mail.  It&#39;s less expensive to send them separately.<br/>
<br/>
Because Moving a Puddle isn&#39;t as fat as the other one, though, you can  <br/>
get two copies for the same postage cost, or add a copy of Thinking  <br/>
Sticks with only one postage payment.<br/>

It&#39;s a game, and a tool for practice connecting ideas.  I don&#39;t want  <br/>
to describe too much because the instructions and the warning note are  <br/>
the best parts.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-630969133">yep the warning notes are sooo dang funny!<br/>
<br/>
My kids also made more sticks when we got our thinking sticks.<br/>
It was fun for them to copy and make up their own.<br/>
So many ways they come up with to play those sticks.<br/>
