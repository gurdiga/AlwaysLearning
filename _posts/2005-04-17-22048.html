<div id="ygrps-yiv-337018657">Would anyone be interested in a movie discussion of Hotel Rwanda? I <br/>
though we could do this in the politics folder over at unschooling.info <br/>
forum so as not to clutter or derail any of the lists.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I know this movie will be rough, I really want to see it and <br/>
support it. I&#39;ve heard that it&#39;s message is ultimately one of hope and <br/>
faith in humanity rather than just a grind you into depression kind of <br/>
thing so I&#39;ve gone ahead and put it on my movie queue, and I may <br/>
purchase it as well to support this kind of film making.<br/>
<br/>
Amnesty International has sent around a teacher&#39;s guide to the movie, <br/>
which while annoying with its learning objectives, etc., does have some <br/>
good info and discussion starter questions that could be interesting to <br/>
think about. I&#39;d be happy to post the link over there if folks are <br/>
interested.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I thought with the different book discussions on the elists <br/>
these days that this might be of interest to other folks, too. Let me <br/>
know and I&#39;ll set it up if there&#39;s interest.<br/>
