&lt;&lt; We&#39;ve had a batch of new subscribers to this list.   So someone say <br/>
something <br/>
 fascinating which will spark a priceless exchange that will last several <br/>
 days, okay?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hmm, well don&#39;t know if this is fascinating enough to spark a priceless <br/>
exchange,<br/>
but I did want to share a &quot;mommy&quot; unschooling lesson I learned the other day.<br/>
I am 7 mo. preg and have three kids 5, 8 & 9.  Knowing that after the babe is<br/>
born we will probably be limited to what we can do and where we can go for <br/>
awhile, we have been going to as many activities, field trips etc as possible.<br/>
One of the hs groups we participate with was offering some science classes.<br/>
They were 1 hr each (not too long) and would offer 3-6 hands on experiments.<br/>
The topic was to be gases. I thought, ok this has the potential to be a lot<br/>
of fun and (in my mind I am thinking-- hey they might learn how some of this<br/>
stuff works!)  I ask the kids if they want to go, I said it was an experiment<br/>
class and they said sure.  <br/>
<br/>
So we go to the first class and I sit in.  And I am sitting there thinking, <br/>
gee<br/>
I wish I had a science teacher like this in school.  But my kids aren&#39;t in<br/>
school...She was fast pace, explained things well, funny personality but<br/>
well, kind of boring...even with the experiments...and a couple were really<br/>
cool!  My dd kept looking back at me and I kept trying not to meet her<br/>
gaze as I knew : 0 that she wanted to let me know how bored she was<br/>
with a heavy sigh and eye roll LOL.  Precious girl doesn&#39;t she know I know<br/>
her so well?  As soon as the class was over I asked the boys if they <br/>
wanted to come again. They said no.  I didn&#39;t even need to ask dd.<br/>
<br/>
After class I asked the organizer if she had turned in my check yet,<br/>
and if not could I give her a new check that covered the kids for the day.<br/>
Well technically she was not supposed to do that. I assured her that<br/>
it wasn&#39;t the teacher, she was really good, but my kids just weren&#39;t <br/>
into that kind of learning and some of the info was really above their<br/>
heads (even though it was meant for their age range).  She did give<br/>
me my check back and I gave her a new one, bless her heart!  Phew <br/>
we all walked out much relieved. <br/>
<br/>
So as we sat in the car on the way home I asked the kids (mostly dd)<br/>
why they didn&#39;t like the class.  She tells me its because they have done<br/>
all that stuff at home.  I am incredulous.  Uh, when?  Well the first was<br/>
easy, it was blowing up a baloon and discussing pressure.  They mess<br/>
with baloons all the time.  Well what about the water in the paper cup<br/>
that she turned upside down onto a piece of paper (and the cup sticks<br/>
to the paper and no water comes out)?  &quot;We do that all the time when<br/>
we are letting the water out of the tub&quot;  they fill up some such thing<br/>
playing with suction, air etc.  So how about when you blew air through<br/>
a straw into plastic baggies and made the piece of plywood rise?  &quot;I<br/>
saw that in a book&quot; LOL.  OK OK I give up!  <br/>
<br/>
So what did I get for my money?  ($30 just for the one class for 3).<br/>
I learned that my kids don&#39;t separate &quot;science&quot; from life, that they <br/>
are living it in their daily lives.  That you don&#39;t have to know the why<br/>
of something to just know that it &quot;does&quot; (experiments).  One of the<br/>
experiments did lead to a longer conversation (could we lift the Twin<br/>
Towers with air bags?).  And finally, my kids saw that once again,<br/>
I would not force them to do something they didn&#39;t want to do.  I <br/>
lovingly reminded them what a good mom I was and did they realise<br/>
that some moms would make their kids take the class (probably <br/>
didn&#39;t even ask if they were interested to start with)?  They couldn&#39;t<br/>
understand that and felt bad for the other kids.  (If I had been stuck<br/>
paying for the class I would not have made them continue attending.<br/>
I would have asked the instructor for a refund and if not &quot;sold&quot; my<br/>
kids spaces at a discount rate to another family or worst case, just<br/>
eat the cost if I had to.  It was my fault for paying in advance, which<br/>
is what they want you to do, but I could have just paid on the date, so <br/>
next time I won&#39;t pay in advance for anything iffy!)<br/>
<br/>
So it was a good lesson for us all the way around I guess.  My instinct<br/>
told me the class might not work out, even though I had thoroughly <br/>
quizzed the organizer on the class/teacher etc.  So I stumbled, <br/>
we tried something that wasn&#39;t completely delighful and survived it &lt;g&gt;<br/>
and are back to normal again LOL.<br/>

<br/>
OOH!  We saw people lift an ice cream truck up off its side one night with a <br/>
giant balloon and a big generator and compressor.  They yelled at us:  &quot;GET <br/>
OUT OF THE ARROYO!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
That was me, Keith and our dog, way pre-kids.   <br/>
<br/>
Albuquerque has a big paved drainage between the sides of I-40 from the <br/>
mountains to the river. A side drainage came out of our neighborhood.  <br/>
<br/>
 A Baskin Robbins truck (medium sized one--three ton?)  ramped up over a <br/>
little car and went into the raging-river ditch during a rain storm.  Okay, <br/>
it wasn&#39;t raging river by most standards, and the truck was on its side and <br/>
bumping up and scooting along every few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
The driver was rescued by a policeman with a rope.  The truck was rescued <br/>
with a giant balloon and a giant tow truck, later than night, after they ran <br/>
me and Keith off.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;One of the experiments did lead to a longer conversation (could we lift the <br/>
Twin<br/>
Towers with air bags?). &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
What twin towers?<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It&#39;s interesting that someone will consider their lesson plan and <br/>
presentation to be entirely radically non-schooly, and from unschoolers&#39; <br/>
points of view it&#39;s as structured as can be.<br/>
<br/>
Holly and Kirby play Harry Potter at a shop where the owner, having a <br/>
homeschooling group come in once a week, has scheduled a comic book reporting <br/>
hour.  They buy a comic for $2, sit all quietly and read, and then they do <br/>
reports.<br/>
<br/>
EEEEYEW!!!<br/>
Yuck!<br/>
<br/>
Ptuie!!!!!<br/>

<br/>
That was my sons definition of &quot;really tall buildings&quot;.  He knows they no <br/>
longer<br/>
exist, but these are the ones he has seen/heard of the most that have a name.<br/>

<br/>
I guess it was structured, she had a lesson plan to get through that<br/>
was for sure.  A couple of experiments the kids couldn&#39;t do involving<br/>
fire (the egg falling into the beaker, and testing barometer pressure <br/>
in boiling water). One experiment the kids would have liked to do but<br/>
couldn&#39;t in the interest of time (I think she could have skipped the &#39;<br/>
measurement one using the boiling/cold water which the little kids<br/>
didn&#39;t get anyway and allowed them to DO the other one where they<br/>
broke a stick, karate chop style that was only being held to the table<br/>
by several sheets of newspaper).  She did offer to let the kids do that<br/>
experiment after class. Mine were so outta there LOL.<br/>

Oh yeah I can see my kids wanting to do this....NOT!<br/>
