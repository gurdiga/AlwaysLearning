<div id="ygrps-yiv-1897124462">&lt;&lt;Does anyone have any info or links about unschoolers who went to<br/>
college or got a really good job?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The unschoolers I know are not wholly grown, still teens...<br/>

Did you forgot about us? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My older (23) daughter is a lyricist and writes music/lyrics for our <br/>
theater group as well as directing plays. She&#39;s been working for a <br/>
promotion company and is about to leave for a six-month solo trip, <br/>
keeping in contact with the company so that she can work here and there <br/>
around the country to make some more money during her travels. When she <br/>
returns, the job--and entrance into management--will be there if she <br/>
wants it.<br/>
<br/>
My younger (almost 21) daughter is in college at a prestigious art <br/>
school. They accepted her portfolio (and even gave her a partial <br/>
scholarship based on it) without any SAT scores. They said they were <br/>
very impressed with her talent AND with the amount of <br/>
activities/learning experiences she had had.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t read this list all the time anymore, but whenever I drop in I <br/>
find something interesting!<br/>

No, I was only thinking about those who hang around my house and whose moms <br/>
aren&#39;t here to report them!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for giving the update here, though!!<br/>
