<div id="ygrps-yiv-1787523586">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anybody on this list is running a business in which <br/>
the kids can and enjoy participating.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are 6 and 4 year old.  We live in Miami, Florida.  My older son <br/>
is always talking about working and earning money, so I would not have <br/>
to work.  Obviously, labor laws would not allow him to work (other than <br/>
modeling, which he is not interested in doing).  So, I figured if I can <br/>
start or buy a business in which the boys will enjoy participating, <br/>
that will fill my son&#39;s void for helping.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for the words of wisdom.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna</div>

Children can work in a family business.  Of course, a 6 year old  wouldn&#39;t be <br/>
able to contribute as much as, say, a 16 year old, but there are  still <br/>
things he could do.  He could sweep up or refill salt shakers or keep  a shelf <br/>
straightened out.  <br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t really have any ideas for businesses, though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1011161952">I have run an eBay buisness and a online store for over 1yr now... My kids range from 4 to 16 and they all have jobs to help out ... for me it was an easy choice because I sell retro and vintage items - not antiques but tacky antiques - as my kids say... This has worked great for us because  - I love to garage sale and auction - the older girls learn how to do bookwork and research the items I&#39;ve found -the younger ones help to pack items for shipment - even the 4 yr old has a job - we put a flyer in with our packages:<br/>
    <br/>
  Besides going to auctions to find Treasures, for the past 13 years I have been home unschooling my daughters ( ages 4 - 16) this year as part of Geography I thought it would be interesting for them to track where our sales are going to. So we are asking our customers to please send us a postcard representing their part of the world. As a Thank You for your time and effort I will give you $1.00 off your next purchase for any postcard you send us or $2.00 off if you take the time to write a letter sharing what you love about where you live. (Please mention postcard discount and I will adjust your invoice accordingÂ… one discount per customer ) <br/>
  Thanks for helping me to share the world with my girls! <br/>
  and <br/>
  thanks again for shopping POSSIBILITIES!<br/>
   <br/>
   the  4 yr old helps us mark the map and put the cards in a scrap book - we have gotten post cards from all over the world - i have the nicest customers and as of yet not one person has taken the discount on their second purchase - we have made loads of new freids - the newest thing this year is my 16 yr old is working with the graphics on my mailings and buissness cards and learning HTML to help with our site and my 14yr old started messing with the re programing my spreadsheets to give us more accurate sales data... the possibilities are endless and keep growing... we are not by any means getting rich but we are working together - learning together - haveing fun and making some extra pocket change!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1740970630">We also sell online, mostly media items like books, videos & <br/>
computer games that we get mostly from garage sales. My son is very <br/>
patient with me about garage saling and he has a gameboy he plays <br/>
sometimes in the car when were out as well. At past 7 1/2 years old <br/>
he kindof understands that mom NEEDS to garage sale to get money to <br/>
buy groceries & give him an allowance. For his part (for a % of <br/>
profit) he likes to preview movies that he finds interesting and <br/>
many times he has previewed computer games to make sure they work <br/>
correctly, although sometimes we do end up keeping them if he <br/>
doesn&#39;t already have a copy. (my son THOURALLY enjoyes his Barbie <br/>
Horse Riding computer game! LOL I didn&#39;t see that one coming but it <br/>
is fun!) Plus of course he has a huge library. He ALWAYS has the <br/>
right to not do anything, of course. And he still has a large video <br/>
collection of his own that he gives me a few of every few months to <br/>
sell fo $ to buy a neat new lego kit or something. We&#39;re lucky <br/>
enough that we each have a computer so there are many days that I <br/>
work at my computer and he works right beside me at his computer, I <br/>
really like the feeling that he is close by and can ask me for help <br/>
anytime and he is happily doing what HE wants to work on! And other <br/>
than his great knowledge of games, Star Wars, Hot Wheels, etc. he is <br/>
also doing better than we expected on aspects reading and math let <br/>
alone the amount of historical conversations searching the web can <br/>
spark. Best Wishes! Barbara</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-549001497">Thank you for your thoughts!!!<br/>
<br/>
Since you mention that you request your customers to send a post <br/>
card, I thought I would mention that we participate in a yahoo! <br/>
group &quot;Postcardkids&quot;, where children who are mainly homeschooled <br/>
exchange post cards.  We have been doing it for the past 3-4 months <br/>
and it is tons of fun and a really neat way to learn geography.  The <br/>
more families join that group, the better.  Hope you and others would <br/>
consider joining the group.<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>

From: hollywoodapi &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:aak@...">aak@...</a>&gt;<br/>
Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if anybody on this list is running a business in which <br/>
the kids can and enjoy participating.<br/>
<br/>
My boys are 6 and 4 year old.  We live in Miami, Florida.  My older son <br/>
is always talking about working and earning money, so I would not have <br/>
to work.  Obviously, labor laws would not allow him to work (other than <br/>
modeling, which he is not interested in doing).  So, I figured if I can <br/>
start or buy a business in which the boys will enjoy participating, <br/>
that will fill my son&#39;s void for helping.<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
I apologize for being so behind in answering e-mails. Life&#39;s been nuts here lately, and I&#39;m just getting <br/>
around to reading and answering.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;ve suggested this time and time again, but I think it&#39;s a great idea! Pooper-scooping!<br/>
 <br/>
There&#39;s even a national organization for scoopers. I bet MANY Miamians (?) would LOVE to have their yards <br/>
cleaned of poop on a weekly basis. Especially with so many retirees who can&#39;t bend over and scoop up Fido&#39;s<br/>
leavings. It would just take a few clever flyers, a handy pooper-scooper (available online from pet <br/>
suppliers), some recyled plastic grocery bags, and some time.<br/>
 <br/>
My younger son still can&#39;t seem to handle the scooper well enough to do the picking up, but he has eagle <br/>
eyes! <br/>
 <br/>
And I bet little old ladies would LOVE to see a couple of young boys frolicking in their yards as they clean<br/>
up!<br/>
