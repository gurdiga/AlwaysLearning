When my kids were older, I wanted to get rid of all our plastic<br/>
dishes but they&#39;re still attached to some of their favorites.  We&#39;ve<br/>
moved steadily more toward ceramic and glass though. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

That&#39;s funny. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We have a pool and a brand new bitchin&#39; deck (thanks to Ren&#39;s sweet <br/>
husband, Bleu). Because of that, we&#39;re eating even more meals outside <br/>
now. But due to the pool and stuff, we also have lots of bare feet.... <br/>
So we&#39;ve moved from ceramic and glass to almost ALL plastic. Plates, <br/>
stemware, flatware, bowls, serving pieces, etc.  All &quot;tropical&quot; hues. <br/>
&lt;g&gt;  In fact, I have a ton of new plastic-ware for parties (26 guests <br/>
just left a party (fajitas & margaritas) at our house tonight).<br/>
<br/>
The older we all get, the more we move towards plastic. Go figure! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
But back to the topic: our lives are pretty clean and orderly, but I <br/>
have two onlies (19 & 11). But it&#39;s different for each family: if one <br/>
family runs on &quot;clean&quot; and homemade, then someone needs to make that <br/>
happen (I choose cook from scratch and clean a lot! While others <br/>
sleep.).  But if paper plates and convenience foods and clutter give <br/>
more time to the kids, that&#39;s what needs to happen. People before <br/>
things, right? &lt;g&gt;<br/>
