<div id="ygrps-yiv-225887590">&quot;All I wanted was children. I wanted to be a mom. That&#39;s all I ever  <br/>
wanted in my life,&quot; Suleman said in the portion of the interview that  <br/>
aired Friday. &quot;I love my children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/depanv">http://tinyurl.com/depanv</a><br/>
<br/>
 From an article on the recent mother of octuplets, in Los Angeles.<br/>
She already had six children.  She&#39;s divorced.  She was listed as  <br/>
&quot;unemployed,&quot; but I don&#39;t know if she&#39;s poor.  All invitro  <br/>
fertilization.<br/>
<br/>
-=-All I wanted was children. I wanted to be a mom.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s going for quantity over quality.  She&#39;s thinking about herself  <br/>
and what SHE wants, but seems pretty unconcerned with what her  <br/>
children might want.  Any pregnancy is a risk, but octuplets?  Two  <br/>
sets of twins in there and four other babies?  No thought of losing  <br/>
her life and leaving the other six motherless?<br/>
<br/>
I know a few times in the past I&#39;ve been criticized for suggesting it  <br/>
might be a good idea for a family to ease off on the reproduction if  <br/>
they really do want to provide a good live for ANYone.   I don&#39;t take  <br/>
it back.   The two biggest families I&#39;ve personally known were one as  <br/>
a kid, 18 or 20 kids, I&#39;ve forgotten now because the number is so big  <br/>
my brain starts to flutter.  The oldest was the mother of the   <br/>
youngest, but it was a big secret.  Yeah.  For a while they lived in  <br/>
a little four room house.  When #1 mothered #18 or 20, she was a teen.<br/>
<br/>
I know a family with nine kids (last I knew) but they&#39;re in a  <br/>
religion that promotes and supports that, and both the parents were  <br/>
from families of over ten kids.  When they lived here, they had  <br/>
five.  Later they had more, including a set of twins.  The parents  <br/>
are energetic and bright and dedicated to their religion and to their  <br/>
family.<br/>
<br/>
Meanwhile, back in non-extreme world, where does &quot;extreme&quot; start?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-840345036">For me and my personality I could have more than two kids if I was younger but I would want a big space between them.<br/>
I have friends that have big families and some are amazing and able to be there for all of them.<br/>
I cannot.  I feel divided. I feel I am not being a good enough mom or there when they both need me at the same time ( that is jsut my 2 kids 3 and a half years apart).<br/>
In this particular story I think this woman is not having all these kids for the right reason.<br/>
She is young and could have waited to use her other 6 eggs and not implant them all at once.<br/>
SHe has 2 year old twins. They must have been around one when she had those eggs implanted.<br/>
She says she did not have a happy childhood and missed having connections and siblings.<br/>
Sounds like she is having all these kids for herself.<br/>
I am not against big families at all.<br/>
But having kids to fill a void is not what I call being a good mom or doing for the sake of your kids.<br/>
A big family that I see being there for the kids is the Gray&#39;s:<br/>

implied assumption that her parents, the grandparents of all those kids,<br/>
are responsible for helping to care for them and they seem very unhappy<br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
It would be really sad if the mother really had no income and no money,<br/>
but I&#39;m assuming that since she was able to afford all the fertility<br/>
stuff, that she must have a source of revenue.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying not to read about it too much because it seems like<br/>
sensationalist news, even though I like human interest stories a lot. <br/>
The public criticism is hard to see, and she&#39;s gotten a LOT of<br/>
criticism.  I feel sorry for her and her kids!  I hope that she&#39;s a<br/>
better mom than most of the parents I see and run across in life!</div>

has 14 kids, no job and no husband, family, or community to help her<br/>
out. He oldest is not even 7 years yet. She is apparently attending<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m one of five as is my mom.  My dad was the oldest of three.   There<br/>
were downsides, I am sure, but I like having lots of siblings.   We<br/>
have two kids and we are definitely pausing and probably stopping with<br/>
two.  My husband is one of two and thought that was a good number.  I<br/>
thought 4 was a good number, but at this point I think I&#39;m too tired<br/>
for 4 :)  If I got pregnant now we would be very happy and things<br/>
would be just fine, but we aren&#39;t going to try for it for a while if<br/>
at all.  Maybe when they are a little older it will seem like a good<br/>
idea to have more: my daughter (5.5) desperately wants a baby sister<br/>
and I think three kids might be really nice much of the time.... but<br/>
there are other things that make not having another baby seem like the<br/>
best plan... so we&#39;ll see.<br/>
<br/>
I have known people with very large families and it seemed as though<br/>
there were problems with kids not getting enough attention or with the<br/>
older kids (daughters, esp) being imposed upon to take care of the<br/>
younger children.  In situations like this it does seem as though it<br/>
would have been kinder to the older children to stop trying to have<br/>
kids.  If there is a surprise, fine, but the things we are talking<br/>
about are people trying to have very very large families even if it<br/>
isn&#39;t really fair to the ones they have.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-713721790">We are definitely stopping at 2.  I&#39;m one of 2, but my partner is number 4 out of 5.  He did <br/>
not have a happy childhood, and although he is a great partner and father, I still have to <br/>
grapple with the consequences of his not having his emotional needs met as a child. (I&#39;m <br/>
not saying it would be like that in every large family of course.) I would consider a family <br/>
with more than 3 kids to be a large family.  I know one family with 6 kids (not unschoolers) <br/>
and their lives seem very hectic, very rushed, and the mum spends a lot of time cleaning <br/>
and the youngest doesn&#39;t seem to get much of a look-in at all. As for 14, well I&#39;m with you <br/>
Sandra, my brain can&#39;t even process that.<br/>
<br/>
I have found that attachment parenting/unschooling is by far the most nourishing and <br/>
rewarding way to live our lives, but it is pretty intense.  I want to concentrate the energy <br/>
and resources I have on my 2 girls ( and I remind myself of that every time I hold a friend&#39;s <br/>
newborn baby!)<br/>
<br/>
I think for each parent there must be a tipping point in the number of kids, beyond which <br/>
you are not capable of joyfully and calmly ensuring that everyone&#39;s needs are met because <br/>
you are stretched too thin.  I know I&#39;ve reached my tipping point, but unfortunately in <br/>
some families they only discover the tipping point by going over it.</div>

but I was raised for most of my childhood as an only child.  The <br/>
siblings didn&#39;t live with us.  <br/>
<br/>
I think it has less to do with the number of children a couple has, <br/>
and more to do with their temperment and the quality of parenting.  I <br/>
think homeschooling, especially unschooling, and attachment parenting <br/>
would make a large family much more doable.  On the other hand, I <br/>
cannot imagine doing it if they were all in public school and we were <br/>
trying to force other artificial schedules (sleeping, eating etc.) on <br/>
them.  I&#39;m sure that after the kids were in school all day, came <br/>
home, ate dinner, did homework, there would be precious little time <br/>
for one-on-one parenting interaction.  <br/>
<br/>
I have two children, and plan to have more, though we don&#39;t have a <br/>
particular number in mind.  We&#39;ll see how things play out as they get <br/>
older and decide where to stop from there.  <br/>

Yeah, the snarling in the back of my brain is pretty intense.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Meanwhile, back in non-extreme world, where does &quot;extreme&quot; start?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I am an only child of two only children. My mother&#39;s father remarried once<br/>
my grandma passed, and fathered three more kids, but they don&#39;t really<br/>
consider themselves family (due to the machinations of my<br/>
ex-step-grandmother, who is evil. But that&#39;s another tirade entirely.)<br/>
<br/>
My husband comes from big families. He&#39;s one of three, his mom is one of<br/>
nine, his dad one of three, but grandpa one of like 11 or 12 or something.<br/>
Dysfunction junction every way you look.<br/>
<br/>
My parenting mentor/guru, the person to whom I look whenever I&#39;m really<br/>
desperate about something, has 10 children. Because she and her husband<br/>
really, really like them. Her oldest two are boys, 26 and 24, married women<br/>
that my pal adores, girls who both came back to her house for college<br/>
breaks, rather than their own homes, and the two boys bought houses on the<br/>
same street as each other, so they could raise their families together. I<br/>
figure anyone who can pull that off is someone I want to emulate. =)<br/>
<br/>
I now have three children. I only was planning on one. Then he was, frankly,<br/>
incredible, and my husband and I said... let&#39;s do that again! And had #2,<br/>
who is an amazing person. And we were going to stop there, but then I<br/>
conceived, and miscarried, and that was so gutwrenching, that I knew that #3<br/>
was a good idea. And now she&#39;s here too, and the dynamic with three kids is<br/>
just awesome. It&#39;s like she&#39;s the salt in the dish the other two made, that<br/>
evens everything out and unifies it.<br/>
<br/>
Having three kids in the SF Bay Area of CA sucks. I get looks and comments<br/>
pretty much every time we venture out in public. You know, cause three is<br/>
sooooooo extravagant and we are being soooooo wasteful of resources. Never<br/>
mind that because of thrift, hand me downs, and homebirth, baby #3 cost<br/>
basically nothing. Never mind that we live on a boat and use approximately<br/>
one eight of the resources we did to run a house on land with one fewer<br/>
person. People will judge, and it&#39;s been my experience so far that they<br/>
judge on their own preconceptions, and not on the evidence before them.<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s OK; we had our family because *we* wanted to, because we wanted<br/>
to share the joy that we could create amongst ourselves, not because we were<br/>
looking to garner the approval of some of the most child-hostile people on<br/>
the planet.<br/>
<br/>
Having said that, it&#39;s hypocritical of me to judge the Octuplet mom. OTOH,<br/>
knowing what I know about the energy needs of just three kids with three<br/>
years between them, I have no clue how a single human being could possibly<br/>
hope to really raise them. If she&#39;s got answers, I&#39;d love to hear them. I<br/>
just cannot figure it out myself.<br/>

eight...that&#39;s a LOT of sitter time before that...I hated having to <br/>
work when my oldest was young and at least his dad was with him as we <br/>
worked opposite shifts...I did second so I spent most of Z&#39;s waking  <br/>
hours with him...my other three I was fulltime stay home with and it <br/>
was SUCH a difference...Beverly</div>
