&gt; &gt;Tia,<br/>
&gt; &gt;Is it common for Canadians to use &#39;mummy&#39; and &#39;mum&#39;?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most still do, though everybody is influenced by American TV.  But they<br/>
&gt; spell it mommy and mom, which makes no sense to me.  So I don&#39;t.  &lt;g&gt;<br/>
&gt; Tia<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I use Mummy and Mum, and spell them that way, too. My impression is that the<br/>
change in spelling has arisen in the last 25 years or so and is, as you say, Tia,<br/>
influenced by the U.S.A. The predominance of American reading materials may<br/>
explain this, as well as the push in Canadian newspapers and magazines to<br/>
harmonize our spelling with the U.S.   I read something a few years ago that<br/>
shamelessly asserted that spelling &#39;em with a &quot;u&quot; is incorrect. Tsk.<br/>
<br/>
Quite a few friends have one American parent (usually the dad), and I notice that<br/>
a few of them say Mummy until they&#39;re a little older, then switch to  Mom.  Our 13<br/>
year old calls me Mum, unless he&#39;s in the throes of need, when he switches to the<br/>
more effective, sung &quot;MO-OM!&quot;  I&#39;ve just checked something he wrote, and sure<br/>
enough, he spells it Mom.<br/>
<br/>
We always called our parents Mummy and Daddy and grandparents Granny and Grampa.<br/>
My own parents are Nanny and Grampa.  My husband (from South Dakota) calls his Mom<br/>
and Dad, and his parents are Gramma and Grampa to the grandchildren.<br/>
