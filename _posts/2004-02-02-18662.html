&lt;&lt; How *do* we celebrate it?  Other than watching Bill<br/>

It&#39;s my husband&#39;s birthday, so we always have a party! &lt;g&gt; He&#39;s 42 this <br/>
Ground Hog&#39;s Day.<br/>

Carly talked to my mother yesterday, and this morning she said to me, <br/>
&quot;Oh, Grandmom wanted me to remind you to make pancakes and sausage <br/>
for dinner because it&#39;s Groundhogs day.&quot;  The memory came flooding <br/>
back.  I have no idea where that tradition came from, but we loved it <br/>
as kids.  Though we had a mother that made complete dinners every <br/>
night, that we had to eat.  So knowing we were having pancakes was a <br/>
real treat to us.<br/>
My kids wouldn&#39;t be happy with pancakes for dinner as something <br/>
special.  We have pancakes, or anything else we want, whenever we <br/>
want it around here.<br/>
I&#39;ll have to come up with something different, now that my mom let <br/>
Carly know that we are suppose to DO something for Groundhogs day.<br/>
Actually I&#39;ll let the kids decide.  They usually have much better <br/>
ideas than I do.<br/>
