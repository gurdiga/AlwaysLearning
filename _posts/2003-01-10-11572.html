&lt;&lt; I asked Julian if he ever wished that he could go to a school like that. <br/>
He <br/>
 said that if he had to go to school he would want it to be a Sudbury Valley <br/>
 school, but that mostly he&#39;d actually rather be with me. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That IS a big compliment, shucks!!<br/>
I was just thinking about you today Kathryn, I hadn&#39;t seen any posts from you <br/>
for a bit (or was I being oblivious) and was wondering how you all were.<br/>
Julian is so sweet!!<br/>

complicated ones aren&#39;t.&quot;<br/>
