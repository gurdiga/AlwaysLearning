<div id="ygrps-yiv-1958482583">Here&#39;s a good article in Tulsa Kids featuring Leslie Moyer and Jenny  <br/>
Thompson.  Leslie has been my mentor for over 17 years and her kids  <br/>
are amazing!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-944586226">What I find interesting about it, is that it doesn&#39;t have the <br/>
unschooling article formula that we see all the time.  It has one <br/>
educational expert giving that old argument about how it might work <br/>
for some kids, if the parents and/or kids are interested in learning, <br/>
but that for kids that aren&#39;t, it&#39;s not going to work.<br/>
<br/>
Lame argument, and it was countered in the article by quoting John <br/>
Holt.  That part was cool.<br/>
<br/>
Other parts of the article didn&#39;t seem very unschooly, like the whole <br/>
chores thing, and how subject matter was discussed and dissected, but <br/>
that could be the writer&#39;s interpretation of what was actually said.<br/>
<br/>
I did like this list:<br/>
<br/>
Leslie Moyer offers the following list to help determine if <br/>
unschooling is right for your family:<br/>
 Willingness to invest time in your child<br/>
Willingness to research resources for learning experiences<br/>
Cooperation from partner or spouse<br/>
An appreciation of your child&#39;s unique strengths<br/>
Willingness to develop and explore your own passionate interests (be <br/>
a role model of learning)<br/>
Willingness to rely on direct observation for &quot;proof&quot; of learning<br/>
Have respectful, two-way communication about learning<br/>
Commitment to put your relationship with your child before any <br/>
educational matter<br/>
Willingness to let go of your own expectations about your child&#39;s <br/>
adult life<br/>
Ability to let go of  pre-conceived notions about what <br/>
constitutes &quot;education&quot;<br/>
Acceptance of the idea that we don&#39;t have control over what happens <br/>
in someone else&#39;s brain<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s a really good starting point for &quot;getting&quot; unschooling.  That <br/>
is the aspect of unschooling that I came to know first, then it <br/>
infiltrated into the rest of our lives, like chores, eating, <br/>
bedtimes, and all that other stuff that gets so highly regulated by <br/>
parents in the lives of kids.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-360525682"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;  Cooperation from partner or spouse<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Do any of you not have cooperation? <br/>
<br/>
My husband (kids step dad) is absolutely against homeschooling.  He has the attitude that kids should shut up, listen to adults, only speak when you are spoken to, or dad will take you out behind the tool shed and you won&#39;t be able to sit for a week.  He feels that kids need to go to school to learn anything, because, after all, how can they learn if they aren&#39;t out in the &quot;real world&quot;???!!!??<br/>
<br/>
We have discussed it a lot and have very opposite points of view.  We have pretty much agreed to disagree and it drives him nuts that the kids don&#39;t &quot;do school work&quot;  (If I won&#39;t give in and put them in school, I might as well do it at home, right?)  Every time he complains about them not doing their work, I just say &quot;they aren&#39;t in school, they don&#39;t do school work&quot;  If I ever point out cool projects that they have been working on that are educational he just gets irritated. <br/>

Anyone else dealing with a noncoperative spouse?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-634782680"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; My husband (kids step dad) is absolutely against homeschooling.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Keep in mind that you can&#39;t &quot;make&quot; someone unschool or &quot;teach&quot; <br/>
someone to unschool. If he feels like you are trying to force <br/>
unschooling on him he&#39;s going to resist.<br/>
<br/>
It might be helpful for you and he to have a serious discussion on <br/>
the subject of personal values. Find some common ground as a place <br/>
to start. Find a way for everyone in the family to be on the <br/>
same &quot;side&quot; rather than working to cross purposes. You must have <br/>
something in common with him, since you married him! Start there. <br/>
What&#39;s good about him as a person and husband and father? Value that <br/>
and let him know you value that and want to support that. <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;He has the attitude that kids should shut up, listen to adults, <br/>
&gt;only speak when you are spoken to, or dad will take you out behind <br/>
&gt;the tool shed and you won&#39;t be able to sit for a week. <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Its possible that he feels like its &quot;his turn&quot; to be in control, now <br/>
that he&#39;s the grown up - and is resenting the fact that, since y&#39;all <br/>
are unschooling, he&#39;s not &quot;getting his turn&quot;. So giving him a little <br/>
extra love and care and support may help him feel better <br/>
about &quot;missing his turn&quot;. Maybe he doesn&#39;t get to be the bad-guy, <br/>
but he gets to hold hands with the princess (as it were). <br/>
<br/>
Look for ways to smooth out relationships between him and the kids <br/>
as much as possible, too - more work for you, in the short run, but <br/>
anything you can do to help him have a better relationship with the <br/>
kids will help the whole family in the longer term. Think in terms <br/>
of relationships and family rather than un/schooling per se. <br/>

&gt; Harmony<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I am in practically the same position.  My daughters father came <br/>
back into our lives about a year ago.  He and I are together and <br/>
planning to live together and evntually get married and he is 100% <br/>
against homeschooling.  I have only recently begun to expose him to <br/>
the idea of unschooling.  He thinks I am completely wrong to put my <br/>
relationship with her above her &quot;behaving herself&quot;.  Part of the <br/>
issue is also that I am willing to give him a vote, espeially on <br/>
this issue.  Even though he is her biological dad I have raised her <br/>
alone for 14 years.  We both love her and want her to be happy, <br/>
healthy and independnet but we have completely different ideas about <br/>
how that is going to happen.  It is the same with many issues with <br/>
us but our daughter is the only thing important enough for us to <br/>
argue about.  Everything else we happily agree to disagree.  He has <br/>
agreed to not say a word for a year but then I am worried about what <br/>
will happen next.  He wants to be satisfied that she is progressing <br/>
well enough to have an independent life.  She is 14 and is just <br/>
starting to transition from de schooling to wanting to do more but <br/>
not sure how to go about it.  She is discontented and more than a <br/>
little whiny as she tries to find her place in the world.  I feel <br/>
frustrated trying to be supportive of her and having to defend her <br/>
to her father.  My biggest fear is his forcing her back into school <br/>
and her choosing to leave home at 16 to get away from him.  I shared <br/>
this fear with him and he promised he would not force her to go <br/>
back.  I have faith in her and I know unschooling is right for her <br/>
but I do worry and I am afraid.  I know he has so much to offer her <br/>
if he could embrace the idea.  He works nights and could do stuff <br/>
with her during the day while I&#39;m at work.  He could teach her how <br/>
to build and fix things and all kinds of stuff about nature.  I find <br/>
it funny that he left high school and got a GED and makes half again <br/>
as much money as I do but he is scared for her.  He&#39;s very &quot;down <br/>
with the man&quot; but his daughter should go with the crowd and be in <br/>
school.  He&#39;s never been to college but he feels she won&#39;t be able <br/>
to be successful there if she can&#39;t cope with high school.  We are <br/>
all working so hard on developing a family.  He has agreed to family <br/>
counseling and family night once a week.  I&#39;ve agreed to not keep <br/>
things from him and to try and not be so defensive.  Liz has agreed <br/>
to try and be around him more.  Sorry this ended up so long and  <br/>
disjointed.  This is something that has been weighing heavily on me <br/>
for months.   Any feedback is greatly appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1576720265">My opinion is that you need to be careful who you choose for &quot;family<br/>
counseling&quot; lest you all be pressured to get her into &quot;normal&quot;  school<br/>
asap.   There are  many  counselors  who  adamantly oppose many of the<br/>
foundations of thoughtful parenting and/or unschooling.<br/>

The clearest analogy I have for unschooling is owning a yacht.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to own a yacht and your spouse doesn&#39;t, can you still own a yacht?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think you can unschool if your husband is absolutely against homeschooling.<br/>
<br/>
You can&#39;t just &quot;agree to disagree.&quot;  Unschooling takes the whole family, not just one parent during school hours.<br/>

I think an intact family is way more important than unschooling.<br/>
A broken family can prevent unschooling, too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I am really interested in this.  Sometimes I feel very fortunate to <br/>
be single with a relatively uninvolved Dad who lives 600 miles away.  <br/>
I get the feeling his side of the family doesn&#39;t believe in <br/>
homeschooling and I&#39;m sure they would be against unschooling, but no <br/>
one is going to challenge me on it.  I do believe it&#39;s better for my <br/>
daughter to be here with me than as an intact family, or of course I <br/>
would move back down there.  But it is sad that she doesn&#39;t know her <br/>
Dad very well, and I know she is missing out on some things by not <br/>
being around that side of her extended family.  <br/>
It&#39;s only because I am willing to be supported by the state and <br/>
because my parents are awesome that I am able to do this.  That&#39;s <br/>
just my view from singlehood.<br/>
Why I&#39;m interested in this thread is that I have some good friends (a <br/>
married couple) who are &quot;partially unschooling.&quot;  They don&#39;t quite <br/>
agree on it and they are only unschooling in certain areas.  I feel <br/>
like this is much harder on their daughter than how they were <br/>
parenting before, except that she does enjoy going home more now that <br/>
she can watch tv and have &quot;treats.&quot;  I guess there is not a lot I can <br/>
do, I have recommended this list, reading John Holt, and Sandra&#39;s <br/>
website.  I guess I don&#39;t really have a question but I am awfully <br/>
frustrated.  <br/>
Maybe I just want to say if you&#39;re single, you can unschool.  But if <br/>
you&#39;re married and can work it out, that&#39;s better.  I would have been <br/>
so crushed if my parents had ever divorced.  And if my daughter&#39;s <br/>
father had wanted to continue our relationship, I would have never <br/>
left.  And if you happen to have any advice for how to deal with my <br/>
friends, I&#39;d love to know!<br/>
