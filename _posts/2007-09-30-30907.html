<div id="ygrps-yiv-483488852">Okay, I&#39;m having some trouble coping.  My daughter and I went to the <br/>
thrift store because I was looking for a little table.  Instead we <br/>
found a fabulous horse.  No biggie, the table can wait.  The trouble is <br/>
that when we got home she cut off its mane and rubbed face paint all <br/>
over the horse.  No, that&#39;s not the trouble.  The trouble is that it <br/>
made me really mad.  I was mad because I really had to scrounge and <br/>
negotiate to get it and I felt like she just couldn&#39;t wait to ruin it.  <br/>
It was such a nice horse.  I know that this wasn&#39;t what she was <br/>
thinking, and I know that it&#39;s hers to do with what she wants.  I want <br/>
to know how I can work on not having this knee-jerk reaction where I <br/>
get so mad over such meaningless stuff.  I feel like most of the time I <br/>
do pretty good with these situations.  But sometimes I just lose it.  I <br/>
did tell her I was sorry, that it was hers, that if she wanted to write <br/>
on it please use something besides face paint (because it&#39;s oily and <br/>
will rub off on anything that touches it)and that I didn&#39;t know why it <br/>
frustrated me but it just did.<br/>
<br/>
Any advice is appreciated.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1745934749">Is there somewhere she can play with the horse with the face paint<br/>
where it will not rub off on other things? <br/>
Is it a big horse, or something small to carry around?<br/>
I am picturing something big, don&#39;t know why!<br/>
I think looking it as she does, that the face paint makes the horse<br/>
&quot;beautiful&quot; to her, and its fun to rub it on. No it isn&#39;t fun to clean<br/>
it up, but thats why I&#39;m thinking if there was a certain horse with<br/>
face paint area for her to go wild with it, maybe that would work for<br/>
everyone?<br/>
My dd loves stuffed animals, she has quite the collection, every time<br/>
she gets a new one she immediately comes home and cuts all the name<br/>
tags off, sometimes they have actual names ( like some of the Ty<br/>
ones)........anyway, I don&#39;t know why this bug me but it does. I don&#39;t<br/>
say anything anymore, i used to try to convince her not to do it until<br/>
I asked why she does it and she said &quot; because real animals don&#39;t have<br/>
tags coming out of their butts&quot;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is now more than a nice horse. It is now a fabulous work of unique art.<br/>
<br/>
It will probably help your relationship if you can get past the idea that <br/>
this was &quot;meaningless stuff&quot; to begin with, either the horse or your <br/>
reaction. Also that the only reason it is OK to alter the item is because it <br/>
is hers. These ideas are still allowing you to minimize her experience.<br/>
<br/>
This area of children&#39;s artistic creativity is one that is very close to my <br/>
heart. Jayn is constantly altering her belongings, and it is very important <br/>
to her that I don&#39;t merely tolerate it on the cheap stuff, but that I <br/>
wholeheartedly embrace and support and celebrate her artistic modifications <br/>
of her things - many of which have been purchased for just that purpose. <br/>
Some of the dolls she wants to work on cost upwards of $50.00. However the <br/>
professional repaint artists can command sums of several hundred dollars for <br/>
finished dolls starting with the same base doll, so in the future Jayn&#39;s <br/>
current experiments may end up being really worth it from a fiscal <br/>
standpoint.<br/>
<br/>
But if not, it doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is that Jayn believes her art <br/>
work and her visual experiments are really important both to herself and to <br/>
her father and I.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; if she wanted to write<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; on it please use something besides face paint (because it&#39;s oily and<br/>
&gt; will rub off on anything that touches it)&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>With Jayn I keep all her supplies really close and on hand. I wrote an <br/>
article for Connections E-zine talking about how her ideas of good organized <br/>
storage were different from mine. It might be better in this kind of <br/>
situation to go get out the other art supplies that she has and set them out <br/>
for her, and talk about what effect she is trying to achieve - and not <br/>
miminize her transformative work by calling it &quot;write on it&quot;. There are also <br/>
spray fixatives and sealers that can go over finishes to help keep them.<br/>
<br/>
Which brings me to another change in focus that you could try - that the <br/>
problem with the face paint is not that it rubs off on other stuff, but that <br/>
it will mar the finish of the horse and ruin her hard work. This is all part <br/>
of the idea that they see themselves shining reflected in our eyes, as Anne <br/>
Ohman has said.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;that I didn&#39;t know why it<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; frustrated me but it just did. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>It is *really* worth working out why it frustrated you - from the point of <br/>
view that it  probably is not something superficial, but perhaps something <br/>
going deep. Were you not allowed full ownership of your things when young? <br/>
Did you have a really clear vision of this horse because it reminded you of <br/>
something and you wanted to be able to consider it yours? Something else? <br/>
PMS?<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s way better to know your own triggers so that you can let go of them. <br/>
Then your dd won&#39;t have to take on the idea that Mom gets frustrated and I <br/>
just have to live with it. It is much better not to have to apologize, <br/>
especially if lurking within the apology is the pretty clear judgment that <br/>
you still don&#39;t like her art work.<br/>
<br/>
Please, please try and find the wonder of the work, instead of the horse <br/>
that was. I know you want to feel better about this and any future similar <br/>
scenarios.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - you might try Altered Books as an art form, either with your dd or just <br/>
on your own. It is a really good exercise in getting past the idea that <br/>
something you buy is sacrosanct.<br/>

<br/>
I just wanted to second all of Robyn&#39;s post, and in particular this<br/>
statement above.<br/>
<br/>
Years ago, when my kids were around 5 to 10 years old, one of them started<br/>
to paint his bedroom door. Almost a permanent fixture in a house a door<br/>
is...right? And all the bedroom doors faced the living room and dining room<br/>
(open room concept) so it was in full view of any future guests. For a split<br/>
second, I thought to stop the painting. Thankfully, I let that thought go<br/>
and went full-board into support mode. I told my dear son how I loved the<br/>
changes he was making to his door. I pleasantly noticed the colors he was<br/>
choosing and the design. Soon he got to a point where he couldn&#39;t reach<br/>
higher on the door, and standing on a chair wasn&#39;t working, so I asked him<br/>
if he&#39;d like me to take it off the hinges and lay it down like a canvas.<br/>
Well, let me tell you that was exciting. Soon all four kids&#39; bedroom doors<br/>
were laid out in different places inside and outside of the house, paint<br/>
buckets and brushes everywhere, as they all created away. Once the other<br/>
three saw what their brother was doing, they all wanted to do it.<br/>
<br/>
Our living room was much more interesting and colorful with our new doors.<br/>
Most guests *got* us pretty quickly when entering our house, and most<br/>
admired the kids&#39; doors and various other things around the house. My<br/>
daughter, who is now 15, just brought this memory up a couple months ago.<br/>
She said at the time she didn&#39;t think there was anything unusual about what<br/>
we did, but over the years she realized how unique our home was this way,<br/>
and what a gift the freedom they had was, and is.<br/>
<br/>
It was just a horse when you bought it. Now it is something priceless. I bet<br/>
when your daughter first eyed that horse in the shop her wheels were already<br/>
turning with vision. THAT is the important thing to support.<br/>
<br/>
But you know that. I&#39;m glad your looking at why you were irritated. That&#39;s<br/>
just got to go :~)<br/>

<br/>
I hadn&#39;t thought of that.  I don&#39;t want to minimize her experience.  <br/>
I think I do have trouble being positive and I think it probably is <br/>
because I would have gotten in trouble for it.  In a reaction I think <br/>
I tend to go the opposite route and try to think of things in an &quot;I <br/>
don&#39;t care what you do to it&quot; attitude.  I see that&#39;s wrong also.  I <br/>
should care more, but in a positive way.  It&#39;s so hard for me.  I <br/>
come from a very cranky family and have fought for a long time to be <br/>
more positive.  It doesn&#39;t come naturally.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is helpful.  I do okay if I can have these kinds of ideas <br/>
lingering in my head, so thank you.  When I am caught off guard with <br/>
something, I have that knee jerk reaction that I really wish I <br/>
wouldn&#39;t have.  (by the way, it turns out that the face paint is the <br/>
only thing that achieved the effect she wanted.  We tried markers but <br/>
they didn&#39;t quite cut it.  So today we worked on it together and I <br/>
apologized again and she said it was okay, she wasn&#39;t still mad at me <br/>
for rubbing it off!)<br/>

in my own mind. It&#39;s possible that I didn&#39;t have full ownership of <br/>
things when I was younger.  The horse I loved only because I knew how <br/>
much she would love it.  And today I really think her enhancement of <br/>
it is pretty darn cute.  She gave the horse personality and a part of <br/>
herself.  PMS?  lol!  That was last week!  I think that&#39;s why I was <br/>
so shocked at my reaction.  I sort of predict that happening and can <br/>
temper myself, but PMS shouldn&#39;t last that long!<br/>

It might go something like this: &quot;She doesn&#39;t care that I just went through all this trouble for her,&quot; or &quot;she&#39;s selfish,&quot; which might lead to &quot;oh no, I&#39;m turning my kid into a selfish brat&quot; and fears like? &quot;I&#39;m screwing up&quot; or &quot;I&#39;m a bad parent.&quot;? Twisted thinking, I admit, but often it goes that way for me.<br/>
<br/>
So...if I start with the first few thoughts:? &quot;she doesn&#39;t care that I just went through all this trouble for her&quot; and &quot;she&#39;s selfish,&quot; I ask myself if it&#39;s really true, and if that&#39;s really the only possible reason she could have done what she did.? Almost every time I can honestly answer, well, no, that&#39;s not necessarily what was going on in her head, she might have been thinking this or that or some other thing (or even better, if I&#39;m not already upset, I can ask her) and that&#39;s when I realize I&#39;m reacting to incorrect assumptions (that are really coming from my own insecurities) and I&#39;m able to let it go.? I&#39;ve found it works for my reactions to other people too.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1807929198">I&#39;m new to the list but this conversation caught my attention because<br/>
I am sure my 6.5 unschooled and artistic daughter would do the same<br/>
thing and I may have the same reaction at any given time if I am not<br/>
at my best.  My point is..when I&#39;m not proud of my reaction I<br/>
apologize (as you did I ) and remind myself of the bigger picture.  I<br/>
am not perfect.  My dd is not perfect.  What a comfort for her  to<br/>
know that her mother makes mistakes, apologizes and tries to learn<br/>
from those moments.  I forgive myself so she learns to forgive<br/>
herself.  I hold myself accountable for my actions so she too will<br/>
hold herself accountable for her actions.  It&#39;s part of this journey<br/>
through life that I love sharing with her as we learn together. Pat<br/>
yourself on the back for caring so much that you are agonizing over a<br/>
one moment of soo many...as moms we expect so much from ourselves we<br/>
forget to &quot;pat our own backs&quot;  If I could I&#39;d pat your for you :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-506107740">Hi Amy,<br/>
<br/>
I know what it is like to have initial reactions, and then need to  <br/>
change them.  Over the last 3-4 years, I&#39;ve definitely had some  <br/>
instances where I&#39;ve had reactions and not seen the potential.  They  <br/>
are getting to be less and less frequent, hopefully non-existent soon.<br/>
<br/>
Your thread reminded me of a transition that has happened for us, and  <br/>
of course, I credit unschooling as the reason it did.  Several years  <br/>
ago, we might have been very traditional parents, very concerned with  <br/>
our things and protecting them.  But as time went on, and we began to  <br/>
say yes to more and more of the things the kids wanted to do, we  <br/>
began to stretch our limits.  When we stretched our limits, we began  <br/>
to see that the boundaries for creativity and experience are so much  <br/>
greater than what we would have allowed as traditional parents.  We  <br/>
were always interested in being creative with our children, and  <br/>
having fun with them, but there were more instances where we would  <br/>
have an automatic no.  With practice saying yes to things that might  <br/>
seem initially destructive or wasteful of a resource, we saw the  <br/>
potential, and eventually began to encourage and participate.<br/>
<br/>
Perfect example, on our middle daughter&#39;s 4th birthday, I bought some  <br/>
of the shredded tissue confetti.  Not sure what we were going to do  <br/>
with it, but it was pretty and we decided that we wanted it when we  <br/>
went through the party store.  On the morning of her birthday, she  <br/>
and her older sister absolutely ecstatically scattered it throughout  <br/>
our ENTIRE apartment on the floor.  (Not necessarily destructive, but  <br/>
definitely very very messy, and we are still finding those little  <br/>
things to this day.)  Craig and I both gulped a little bit, but then  <br/>
realized that it was so festive, that it was the best idea anyone  <br/>
could have come up with.  The next year, she wanted to have a &quot;sea&quot;  <br/>
theme for her birthday, so we made some really cute fish decorations  <br/>
and it was OUR idea to shred a ream of yellow construction paper to  <br/>
spread on the floor so it could be &quot;sand.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There are numerous other projects where I&#39;ve had that initial &quot;hmmm,  <br/>
now what do you need the whatchamacallit for???&quot; and then I realize  <br/>
that my children are doing something that is so creative that I am  <br/>
totally amazed.  Tape creations, foil contraptions, boxes of rice to  <br/>
play in on the kitchen floor (and elsewhere), potions in the bathroom  <br/>
(with my stuff, as well as stuff that I buy for them), rock/funnel  <br/>
water filters, you name it.  If you shut it down, though, it&#39;s not  <br/>
going to happen, and how will that limit your daughter&#39;s potential.   <br/>
What avenue will you close off permanently, because of an early &quot;no,  <br/>
that&#39;s going to ruin something, or use it wastefully?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
You can have a whole bunch of possessions, and you will live your  <br/>
life and die and they will just be the stuff that you had, or, you  <br/>
can have possessions with memories.  We may have crazy dangly things  <br/>
hanging from our shelves that other people don&#39;t think are  <br/>
decorative, collages on the wall, or cat-food cakes in my best cake  <br/>
pans cooling on the kitchen counter, but there are memories now  <br/>
attached to those things that are so precious that they outweigh  <br/>
anything that we used to think or feel about protecting the stuff.   <br/>
Those cake pans are now the cake pans that Amelia made her many cat- <br/>
food (and other concoction) cakes in, which is so much more memorable  <br/>
than what I might do with them.  Of course, there is a need to help  <br/>
your daughter understand and respect where the real limits are for  <br/>
the rental property that you are inhabiting, but it is possible for  <br/>
you to do that gently and with an eye to identifying really great  <br/>
alternatives to what she might suggest, if it seems destructive to  <br/>
the property.<br/>
<br/>
I think that you are on the right track by realizing the mistake  <br/>
seconds after you get mad.  Maybe your next step would be to try to  <br/>
catch yourself in mid-sentence.  Then the next step might be to  <br/>
anticipate a &quot;situation.&quot;  After that, you&#39;ll probably be identifying  <br/>
opportunities for your daughter yourself.  You already went out of  <br/>
your way to get her the horse that she would love, and others have  <br/>
pointed out how to look at her artistic expression with it  <br/>
differently. The caring is there, maybe just changing the habit of  <br/>
how you react, and allowing yourself to slow down some and allow the  <br/>
yes or positive thought to come in.<br/>
<br/>
I also think that it is helpful to do the work on yourself and what  <br/>
is causing you to &quot;be&quot; a certain way.  Irritability in a toddler or  <br/>
child has a cause, and sometimes it is the situation, sometimes it is  <br/>
a more underlying reason (food, sleep, boredom, lack of attention).   <br/>
I think that it can be the same way with adults.  I know that I&#39;ve  <br/>
had situations where something else has irritated me, and then I&#39;ve  <br/>
been irritable with my family, misdirecting the negative energy.  Or,  <br/>
we try to fit too much in during a day, and then it might kind of  <br/>
collapse at the end, because I&#39;m tired, hungry, thirsty, etc.  It  <br/>
always helps to sit back and do some analysis on myself.  Sometimes  <br/>
painful, but always helpful.<br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m a bit of a new lurker here, so &#39;hi&#39; everyone.<br/>
<br/>
I am going through this exact same thing right now, except my child <br/>
is a boy.  I often have very negative and nasty immediate reactions <br/>
to harmless things he has done.  I am positive it has everything to <br/>
do with the negative and nasty upbringing I had :).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway,<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;I want most is to learn to control that initial, irrational<br/>

 </span></blockquote>controlling my reactions or thoughts has never has worked for me.  I <br/>
tried really hard for a year or two and the constant resistance to <br/>
myself put me in a worse state than I had been in before.  What has <br/>
worked lately is more witnessing and questioning my thoughts and <br/>
reactions, as someone else has already mentioned.  It won&#39;t work the <br/>
first time, because you need to have a reaction to question- but <br/>
then, after something happened, I would sit down and inquire into the <br/>
thought or reaction and let my mind unravel it on its own ... then, <br/>
usually,  the next time my son did something similar I found there <br/>
was no reaction, or a different reaction, or an embracing of my son&#39;s <br/>
actions, rather than an instant resistance to it.<br/>
<br/>
Have you heard of &#39;the work&#39; by Byron Katie?  look her up, I found <br/>
two of her books at the library and they are both great intros to <br/>
this kind of mind-questioning.  Another big help for me has been <br/>
Raising Our children, Raising Ourselves by Naomi Aldort - kind of <br/>
&#39;the work&#39; for parents.<br/>

improve behavior, I was merely offering support. After a tough moment<br/>

When I was younger I wrote my name on everything (walls, furniture, <br/>
dolls, every piece of paper, even those darn giant wooden spoons my <br/>
parents had)!  I think I got in trouble when it was their stuff.  The <br/>
weird thing now, my daughter does the same thing!!  When I see her name <br/>
carved into her dresser or desk (etc.), it just brings back memories and <br/>
makes me smile!  <br/>

willpower, choice, and just doing it - for everyone.  In my <br/>
experience, I had to *learn* to do it, over time,  and &#39;the work&#39; by <br/>
Byron Katie was my way to learn it.  I couldn&#39;t choose to do it <br/>
because I didn&#39;t know how. I found it impossible to not ride the wave <br/>
of emotion that blinded me to what was going on inside me.  I&#39;m <br/>
sharing this so that maybe the OP or others who have a similar <br/>
experience to mine can also find their way - not because I want to argue. <br/>

<br/>
Making a choice is a matter of choice and just doing it.<br/>
I don&#39;t think it requires willpower to realize that a person can make a choice.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/choice">http://sandradodd.com/choice</a><br/>
It&#39;s possible to make it seem that people have to take a course or learn to make choices in some formal way.  There are always people who will take your money.  There are  lots of people on this list who can help others learn it for free.<br/>
Think of two choices.  Choose the best one.  Next time think of two choices (maybe the choice from the time before and a better one).  Choose the best one.<br/>
<br/>
If you do that several times a day, soon you&#39;ll be doing it countless times a day.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-746683865"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;I want most is to learn to control that initial, irrational<br/>
&gt; &gt;reaction<br/>
&gt; controlling my reactions or thoughts has never has worked for me.  I <br/>
&gt; tried really hard for a year or two and the constant resistance to <br/>
&gt; myself put me in a worse state than I had been in before.  What has <br/>
&gt; worked lately is more witnessing and questioning my thoughts and <br/>
&gt; reactions, as someone else has already mentioned.  It won&#39;t work the <br/>
&gt; first time, because you need to have a reaction to question- but <br/>
&gt; then, after something happened, I would sit down and inquire into the <br/>
&gt; thought or reaction and let my mind unravel it on its own ... then, <br/>
&gt; usually,  the next time my son did something similar I found there <br/>
&gt; was no reaction, or a different reaction, or an embracing of my son&#39;s <br/>
&gt; actions, rather than an instant resistance to it<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>When it comes to &quot;controlling a reaction,&quot; I think that if you reaction <br/>
is to shout or demean your child or crush an impulse intensely, then it <br/>
is appropriate to control yourself and your reaction.  The discussion <br/>
has been using words like nasty and irritated, so I&#39;m assuming that <br/>
negative statements and shouting are possibly what we&#39;re talking about.<br/>
<br/>
An intense reaction to a safety situation, on the other hand, might not <br/>
be so unwarranted.  Although, nasty and irritable could be replaced <br/>
with compassionate and caring.<br/>
<br/>
In the case where you&#39;re controlling your reaction, though, are you <br/>
simply shutting yourself down and saying &quot;must do this, can&#39;t say <br/>
this,&quot; as opposed to giving yourself the leeway to think through what <br/>
other more appropriate way to communicate your concern to your child <br/>
might be?  <br/>
<br/>
It would be helpful to hear an example of controlling a reaction in a <br/>
real life scenario.  Any example to share?<br/>
<br/>
There is a reason for your reaction, and of course, you must begin to <br/>
examine and question the reasons for your reactions, because many of <br/>
them could be invalid.  However, it seems to me that there is more <br/>
communication with the child that needs to come out perhaps, rather <br/>
than just shutting down the parent&#39;s reaction, and better ways of <br/>
communicating parental concerns is a whole other completely valid <br/>
topic, I think, and probably relevant to this topic.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Just an update on the horse, in case this will be helpful to anyone.  <br/>
I realized that my reaction came about because, besides being <br/>
exhausted, I was so proud of the good find ($16 for a $100 horse!)<br/>
that I had wanted to show it off to some people.  While I like my <br/>
dd&#39;s creative endeavours, I knew we would get a negative reaction <br/>
from some of the people I had wanted to show it to.  Well, once I <br/>
figured that out my brain grew a little more and I saw how ridiculous <br/>
that thought process was.  I know how bad I feel when I get a <br/>
negative reaction, and I didn&#39;t want that to happen to my daughter, <br/>
or me.  So I gave her the negative reaction.  This is so stupid.  <br/>
I am her defender of negativity, and if she gets any negativity <br/>
thrown her way I will champion her efforts - loudly, proudly, <br/>
enthusiastically.  <br/>
The upside of it, is that I&#39;ve learned a lot.  I&#39;m changing my <br/>
statement about wanting to control that initial negative reaction <br/>
to &quot;I want to change that initial negative reaction.&quot;  I didn&#39;t think <br/>
it was possible because it felt so out of control, but it is <br/>
possible.  <br/>
It made me think about how tired I get of the &quot;devil&#39;s advocates&quot; in <br/>
my life.  I would love to hear someone say &quot;Gee, what a great idea, <br/>
Amy!&quot; once in awhile.  At 36 years old, I still get really hurt by <br/>
other people&#39;s negativity.  I would feel awful if someone criticized <br/>
my artwork, or yelled at me for breaking or spilling something.  My <br/>
dd must feel so much worse when that happens.  Knowing this makes it <br/>
easy to change.  <br/>
Another thing I thought of is that unschooling isn&#39;t much different <br/>
than taking care of my grandmother.  I constantly made different <br/>
kinds of food that I thought she might like because I just wanted her <br/>
to eat.  I called her friends because I thought she might like <br/>
company.  If she wanted to do anything, I dropped what I was doing <br/>
and we did it because I wanted her to be happy.  If she made a mess?  <br/>
I  comforted her and happily cleaned it up.  I didn&#39;t even have to <br/>
think about it, it&#39;s just what felt right.<br/>
Thanks to all of you for your pats on the back and advice and <br/>
creative ideas.  I am making lots of better choices, in taking better <br/>
care of myself and in being a better person to my girl.  <br/>
