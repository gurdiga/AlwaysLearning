<div id="ygrps-yiv-1481206537">Maxine is my hero too. And I have a degree in social work! Unfortunately, no TV show can really relate the awful drudgery and horror of being a social worker for DHS. I chose a different path, but my friends who worked there struggled so hard with what they saw. However, a person like Maxine, who lets it out and isn&#39;t afraid for people to not like her, could do so much good. I just love her.h<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1493625488">Hi Kathryn, Jacli here :)<br/>
Just had to say it sounds like your son is a pretty cool<br/>
kid.<br/>
(and no its not just because I think Tyne Daly is one of <br/>
the best actresses to have ever been on tv or because I&#39;m <br/>
a huge closet fan of Cagney and Lacey...)<br/>
<br/>
Take care, Jacli<br/>
<br/>
