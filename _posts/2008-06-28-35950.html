<br/>
 Us, too. Well, oldest DS and I... DH and youngest don&#39;t seem to have  that <br/>
problem (in fact, DH can fall asleep in moments just about anywhere-even  <br/>
standing up!). I seem to have hit upon a solution that works for us: repetitive,  <br/>
boring hand-held video games. T.V. nor reading work for me-in fact, they wake <br/>
me  up. But something about a game where you have to work a long time to build  <br/>
experience points to move on, or something I&#39;m so familiar with (from <br/>
childhood,  even) like Monopoly seems to occupy my mind *just enough* to keep those <br/>
thoughts  from racing around in my head, but doesn&#39;t engage it enough to merit <br/>
continued  altertness. I&#39;ve gone from 1-2 hours of time to fall asleep to <br/>
10-30 minutes!!  Wyl (9), hasn&#39;t seemed to find a game that does that for him, <br/>
yet, and many  games wake him. But we&#39;re working on that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-626762201">I&#39;ve been thinking about this for the last few days, and I think I<br/>
found a way around this problem.  Travel.  I was thinking of slowly<br/>
going west to go &quot;back&quot; in time, but I would probably have to think<br/>
carefully about exactly when to cross the international date line...<br/>
so really, it might be best to travel around, stop nearby and plan the<br/>
time of my crossing carefully. Reading about &quot;Coordinated Universal<br/>
Time&quot; and finding out that there is a period of 2 hours where 3 days<br/>
are going on was cheering... surely there will be a way to do this<br/>
without ever being in July 24th.<br/>

<br/>
Then, for me, Learn Nothing day will not have existed.  And then,<br/>
being a mathy sort, I am ready to start saying things about the empty<br/>
set (my mathy husband and I make empty set jokes all the time.  An<br/>
example of this sort of statement is that a statement like &quot;All<br/>
unicorns are purple&quot; and it is a true statement but you can&#39;t say<br/>
&quot;Unicorns are purple&quot; as it implies the existence of Unicorns). I can<br/>
then say &quot;Nothing I did on &quot;Learn Nothing Day&quot; was learning&quot;.  I could<br/>
also say &quot;Everything I did on Learn Nothing day was Learning&quot; which<br/>
would be equally true, but I won&#39;t say it ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-851089392">Incidentally (while on the subject of translations) my translation spurred<br/>
some internal disagreement (as so many do) about the use of the double<br/>
negative in Spanish: Part of me still wants to call it &quot;El Dia de NO<br/>
Aprender Nada&quot;, as that sounds more natural, while my initially submitted<br/>
contribution was &quot;El Dia de Aprender Nada&quot; as a more literal &quot;Learn Nothing&quot;<br/>
day translation, which to me has some philosophical connotations (not just<br/>
that we would try NOT to learn that day, but that by &quot;learning nothing&quot; we<br/>
would be somehow &quot;learning about nothing&quot; if you will, which I realize is<br/>
contrary to the intent of the holiday :) but still struck me as meaningful<br/>
in context. So, my disclaimer is, for a purist, the transilation &quot;El Dia de<br/>
No Aprender Nada&quot; might be more appropriate.<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=<br/>
I can say the same thing for the Portuguese tranlation.<br/>
&quot;O Dia de Nao Aprender Nada &quot;sounds better to me too.<br/>

I don&#39;t think mainstream homeschoolers would understand...<br/>
Maybe the unschoolers should try it out.  If it&#39;s a &quot;second annual&quot;  <br/>
next year, that has more solidity than a never-yet-tested alleged  <br/>

repost== Well here I was doing something unusual for me and actually<br/>
looking up something. (Yeh I want more deschooling.) I was over at a<br/>
discussion &quot;The Scientific Method&quot; and just out of curiosity thought<br/>
I&#39;d search for something to explain more about what Ren mentioned ...<br/>
logic and how to avoid fallacious argument.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I found (having more to do with Margaret explanation of<br/>
time logic) on Linear vs. Circular -or Indigenous- Logic. Just like<br/>
Margaret said, time is a quantum physics concept. Pretty cool coinkdinky.<br/>
