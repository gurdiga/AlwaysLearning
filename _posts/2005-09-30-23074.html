When The Simpsons first came out there was great hue and cry that children <br/>
would identify with Bart and all become bratty.**<br/>
<br/>
When the first T-shirts came out that said &quot;I&#39;m Bart Simpson -- who the hell are you?&quot; my mom was appalled.  (She&#39;s still believes, without watching, that the Simpsons is appalling and is likely to degrade social standards.)<br/>
<br/>
My son recorded and watched 3 episodes of The Simpsons every day for months.  He&#39;s intelligent, affectionate, and pretty much well-behaved.  Not at all what she would have predicted.<br/>
