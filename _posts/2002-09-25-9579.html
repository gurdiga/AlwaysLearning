<div id="ygrps-yiv-1643077289">The mountains that are burning in LA, that you may have heard about in the<br/>
news are in the Angelus National forest directly north of the performing<br/>
arts center and college where I work in Glendora.  We have been in an<br/>
overcast of smoke for the past two days. Everything is covered in ash.<br/>
Every time I approach the theatre there is some awesome display of flames or<br/>
smoke columns dominating the view. On Monday afternoon we stood in the<br/>
parking lot watching 200 year old California oaks being consumed like<br/>
torches in just a few minutes. The ridge where the fire line was at that<br/>
time is about 2 miles as the crow files. From that perspective, the flames<br/>
were as tall as a kitchen match igniting at arms length. Truly humbling. It<br/>
was 108 degrees that day and the weather service said that the smoke clouds<br/>
over our inland valley insulated us from the predicted 110.  In the evening<br/>
at sunset I was driving to through Glendora, San Dimas, and La Vern to get<br/>
to a rehearsal at a theatre in Clarermont. There was a solid wall of smoke<br/>
above the ridge for the 12 mile drive as the entire valley behind the ridge<br/>
was being consumed.  At about 11:00 that night, driving home, there was not<br/>
a place on the mountain range that wasn&#39;t in flames. The entire northern sky<br/>
was as bright and orange as the western sky is just a few moments after<br/>
sunset. I noticed the large tanker helicopters buzzing back a forth from the<br/>
mountains to the direction of the airport and Puddingstone reservoir. They<br/>
were flying at night. It is very dangerous for them to be flying at night.<br/>
The only time I have heard of the flight crews working a fire at night is<br/>
when homes are in danger. I stopped in La Vern. I knew of a parking lot<br/>
behind a shopping center that have a very nice view of the mountains and<br/>
thought I could get a good perspective of the range and the fire from there.<br/>
As I pulled behind the buildings I meet hundreds of others that had similar<br/>
ideas, including the news trucks. I also noticed that there was about a half<br/>
dozen helicopters hovering about. I took me a few minutes, at about the time<br/>
they were flying away, to figure out that they were news helicopters that<br/>
had just finished there live reports for the 11:00 news.  From here it was<br/>
clear, the entire range was in flames. This range defines the northern<br/>
boundary of the eastern LA basin. Just a few miles from some of the most<br/>
densely packed suburbs and busiest streets of the San Gabriel valley. These<br/>
are some of the most rugged mountains in the country. Directly in front of<br/>
me I watched as San Dimas canyon was consumed. Flames hundreds of feet high<br/>
racing up the canyon walls. Imagine a narrow canyon, 600 to 1000 feet high<br/>
filled half their height with what appeared to be solid flame. I couldn&#39;t<br/>
imagine how any of the homes or stables or camps in that canyon could still<br/>
be standing.  This is where the reports say 44 &quot;Cabins&quot; were lost. These<br/>
cabins are the *homes* for many people. Including a family that was part of<br/>
our park day group about 5 years ago. I wondered if they had still lived<br/>
there. I&#39;m thinking they sold the place about 3 years ago... The dive along<br/>
Foothill blvd. to the theatre on Tuesday evening saw dozens and dozens of<br/>
firefighting vehicles. And trucks full of fire fighters. Fresh clean faces<br/>
going up and tired dirty ones coming down. I Don&#39;t know how they do it. It<br/>
seems like such an impossible task. On Sunday just a few hours after the<br/>
fire broke out, I pulled to the side of the road as a forest service Truck,<br/>
a big semi was speeding by with it&#39;s lights and siren going. It was hauling<br/>
a huge, maybe 12 foot wide bulldozer towards the mountains.  Not the usual<br/>
emergency vehicle needing the right of way. I&#39;ve also seen LA county Sheriff<br/>
trucks screaming by towing large trailers, hauling evacuated horses from the<br/>
canyon stables.<br/>
<br/>
Late yesterday afternoon we got word from the Azusa police that they are<br/>
preparing to use the college campus where work as an evacuation site if the<br/>
flames move any further west.<br/>
<br/>
This morning, from our home, about seven miles from the flames, the sunlight<br/>
is dim and orange from the smoke and you cannot see the mountains at all.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
For the past three weeks I have watched as the curve fire burned the south<br/>
side of the Angelus range above Azusa, recreation area for thousands of<br/>
Angelenos on any weekend. Now the front range from there east for 12 miles<br/>
is in flames. These are the mountains that are in my backyard. When I think<br/>
of the mountains, this is the area I think of. They are the mountains of my<br/>
youth.  The deserted mountain roads I ride my bicycle on are now packed with<br/>
firefighting people and equipment. And both sides of the road are burned<br/>
down to ash. I objectively know that these flames are an integral part of<br/>
the ecosystem. Healthy wilderness needs fire to maintain balance but it is<br/>
*very tough* to watch. It is like watching past generations grow old and die<br/>
so the new generations can claim there lives and place in this world.<br/>
<br/>
With a tear in my eye, the rebirth begins...<br/>
