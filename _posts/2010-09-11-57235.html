<div id="ygrps-yiv-996990004">&quot;I can see the sense in the advice Iâ€™ve been given here but I can&#39;t  <br/>
implement it with a great amount of assurance or confidence.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
After years of muddling around with a lot of words about how people  <br/>
can get from desire and intent to the point where they&#39;re actually  <br/>
DOING it, this arose last summer when I was preparing to speak in  <br/>
Montreal.  So for me, it looks like Montreal; just sayin&#39;.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Read a little, try a little, wait a while, watch.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people read about unschooling and then turn the computer off or  <br/>
put the books and magazines away, and they live with their kids in a  <br/>
way they think they understood, and then come back and complain that  <br/>
their initial understanding didn&#39;t work.<br/>
<br/>
Some people read and write online for hours, weeks, one person even  <br/>
YEARS, before changing anything about the way they are interacting  <br/>
with their children.<br/>
<br/>
Some people take a suggestion, go and try it once or twice, and come  <br/>
back and say &quot;That didn&#39;t work; now what?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If you read a little, put a toe in the water of trying it out, think  <br/>
about it, sleep on it, try it some more, listen to your kids and watch  <br/>
them and hold them (you can feel when a child is tense or relaxed by  <br/>
holding or hugging; I hope all the parents here can do that, and if  <br/>
not, practice that--WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT IT TO THEM), then come back  <br/>
and ask another question if you have one, or read more online, or talk  <br/>
to other unschoolers... that is how confidence comes.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing to do something because you read that other people&#39;s  <br/>
kids responded well to it.  Taking children out of school on the basis  <br/>
of faith that other people&#39;s kids did well without school is fine, but  <br/>
that&#39;s still about other people.  Little by little you will start to  <br/>
see your own child learn without being taught, and be there when your  <br/>
own child asks very cool questions and makes connections between ideas  <br/>
that you yourself never considered.  And soon you&#39;ll be one of the  <br/>
people other people are basing their own initial faith on.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s gradual.<br/>
