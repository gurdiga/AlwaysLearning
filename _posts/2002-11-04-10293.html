&lt;&lt; But I like Charlton Heston in period costume stuff, especially when he <br/>
gets <br/>
 mostly naked and dangerous yet noble:  Ben Hur, El Cid &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I finally watched that LAST NIGHT!! I did love Charlton Heston as the Cid, <br/>
but didn&#39;t care for Sophia Loren too much. Too many 60&#39;s looking hairdo&#39;s and <br/>
makeup, and she&#39;s oh SO movie actressish.<br/>
If that makes any sense at all!  <br/>
Learned a wee bit of history, and am now going to look some stuff up online <br/>
about him.<br/>
Did they REALLY put him on that horse when he was already dead?<br/>
Wow.<br/>

<br/>
Well...<br/>
<br/>
It was a legend even when it was written down, so who knows &quot;really.&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
There is an epic poem in Spanish about it, and other stories and bits.  <br/>
<br/>
Kinda like King Arthur or Robin Hood in English, there are major fictional <br/>
works, and then here and there a story or a ballad or local &quot;grave&quot; or <br/>
whatever.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Sophia Loren is the weak link.<br/>
<br/>
I have a book by Charlton Heston, kind of an edited down journal.<br/>
<br/>
He wanted them both to be made up to look older, after he was gone and the <br/>
babies were born and all.  And HE took makeup to make him look gnarly, and a <br/>
big scar, and grey hair.  She refused the makeup.  &lt;tee hee!&gt;  He seemed <br/>
grumpy about that.<br/>
<br/>
I like her in Man of La Mancha, though!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I finally watched that LAST NIGHT!! I did love Charlton Heston as the Cid, <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I love the scene where he makes the new king swear.  Slams his hand back down <br/>
in front of everybody.<br/>
<br/>
Lots of the acting was good in that, but neither of the female leads was good <br/>
enough.<br/>

Yes! I agree. <br/>
I was really tired of her by the end. <br/>
Great story and I got to see all the wonderful medieval costumes and <br/>
weaponry, which make it worth while anytime.<br/>
