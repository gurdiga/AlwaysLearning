<div id="ygrps-yiv-1079301562">My subscription to HEM lapsed years ago.  I did love reading Sandra&#39;s<br/>
column, and some of the others.  Didn&#39;t Carol Narigon write a column, too?<br/>
My memory is fuzzy.<br/>
<br/>
The fact that they will no longer be carrying Sandra&#39;s column coupled with<br/>
the fact that they&#39;ve decimated the unschooling.com boards speaks volumes.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m still waiting to see how they revise those, though I will miss the<br/>
archives.  I was wanting to do a search after a visit last weekend to my<br/>
SIL&#39;s.<br/>
<br/>
My SIL has a bright orange note prominently displayed on her kitchen<br/>
bulletin board:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Obedience--cheerfully, completely, immediately.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I about puked over that one.<br/>
