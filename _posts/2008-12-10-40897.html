<div id="ygrps-yiv-966084314">At the Life is Good Unschooling Conference 2007 a younger gal sang &#39;You are <br/>
Beautiful&#39;.  Does anyone have a video copy or know where to get one?  I <br/>
looked all over the place and can&#39;t find one - so I&#39;m wondering if it even <br/>
exist.  Please email me off-list so we don&#39;t cloud AL up.<br/>
<br/>
Sending the Thank You in advance.<br/>
