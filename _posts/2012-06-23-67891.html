I&#39;d second pipe cleaners! We&#39;ve just been to a party tonight that was pretty boring for children and I made little animals for my son out of pipe cleaners - I think it made the party a bit more fun for him :-)<br/>
<br/>
Pocket sized travel games can be good sometimes too. A Rubik&#39;s cube.<br/>
<br/>
An Etch-a-sketch although that&#39;s a bit bigger to carry round. Could be good to keep in the car though...<br/>
<br/>
Sticky mosaics, Usborne puzzle adventure or look-and-find books, Eye Spy books, sticker books.<br/>
<br/>
Magic colour-changing pens. Scissors and cut circles of paper to make snowflakes (could be too messy for some places). A few oddments of yarn, large-eyed needle and a plastic canvas shape (for little ones just tie the yarn onto the needle so it doesn&#39;t get annoying by keep coming off - the holes in the canvas are large enough for the knot to pass through).<br/>
<br/>
Pipe cleaners are my personal all-time favourite though - because they can become pretty much anything my son might want, within reason ;-) I made a T-Rex tonight, among other things.<br/>
<br/>

Playmobil figures (you can get individual figures for about 4 or 5  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2026802272">Something I had to learn about the &quot;secret stash&quot; toys is that they are way more successful at helping my kids to have fun in a boring or challenging situation if we play with them *together*. In other words, no matter how special or cool the toy or activity is, I can&#39;t hand them over to my kids and expect them to entertain themselves. (Depending on the reason the secret stash was brought out, this can be a challenge to implement in the moment.)<br/>
<br/>
We play with Army men, Playmobil figures, Lego figures, walkie talkies, Snapcubes, Star Wars action figures, wind up toys (one I learned from my own mom when I was a kid--she&#39;d bring a Ziploc freezer bag full of them to restaurants with us to play with at the table), matchbox cars, and finger puppets. Sometimes there will be something random and cool a the bottom of my bag--last week it was a string of paperclips.<br/>
<br/>
For us, it&#39;s usually not so much that it&#39;s something different in the secret stash, but rather portable favorite toys that we play with together in a new context. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>My children are aged 12, 11, 8 and 6.<br/>
<br/>
Each of my children has a zip-up folder in the car with plain and<br/>
lined paper, pens, pencils, sharpeners and rubbers so I don&#39;t carry drawing<br/>
things with me much. I also keep a big air-powered rocket, a small kite and<br/>
a big bottle of bubbles in the car.<br/>
<br/>
I currently keep some of the new tiny Nerf guns in my bag, with their<br/>
darts. I also have  playing cards, a puzzle book, a set of the promotional<br/>
lego knights which came in cereal packets a few years ago, with weapons<br/>
(they&#39;re moulded in one piece and are a bit bigger than the minifigures so<br/>
it&#39;s easy to find all the bits when you&#39;ve finished playing outside or in<br/>
the car). I also have a mixed bunch of tiny My Little Ponies which I think<br/>
are MacDonald&#39;s toys and a few Playmobil children to go with them, and a<br/>
selection of mini balls and gliders and balloons from the party section of<br/>
the supermarket.<br/>
<br/>
I find the toys sold as party-bag fillers are a good place to start and<br/>
eBay is invaluable. Hawkin&#39;s Bazaar (www.hawkin.com) is brilliant for<br/>
people in the UK. Some toys from Kinder eggs or Happy Meals are really well<br/>
designed and interesting and you can get whole sets for pennies sometimes;<br/>
I like to have at least one thing none of the children have seen before<br/>
hidden in my bag.<br/>
