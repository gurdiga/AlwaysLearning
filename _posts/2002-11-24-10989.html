&gt; close and spend a LOT of time together - we live really close and we hang <br/>

It&#39;s so hard adjusting to the loss of a parent, and it must be even harder <br/>
when it happens suddenly. If you want to e-mail, please do...we seem to be <br/>
going through a similar thing at the same time.<br/>
