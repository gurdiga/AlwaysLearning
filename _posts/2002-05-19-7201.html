<div id="ygrps-yiv-2035110626">I am a newcomer to the list. I probably will read more than post <br/>
unless I find some of my experience helpful to others. I homeschooled <br/>
my oldest some 20 years ago and recently have been homeschooling my <br/>
youngest my 17 year old who is now dual enrolled in the local <br/>
community school. I was excited to find a support group online such <br/>
as this. <br/>
<br/>
My 22 year old daugher is expecting my first grandchild any day and <br/>
wants my assistance in homeschooling her as well. So the postings <br/>
here will be most helpful as so much has changed! <br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
<br/>
Katie</div>

This may be the first time we&#39;ve ever discussed homeschooling in utero<br/>
on this list.    ::::: foolish grin ::::::::<br/>
