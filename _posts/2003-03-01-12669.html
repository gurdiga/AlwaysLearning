<div id="ygrps-yiv-1521435677">Having been born in England and lived there till 22 I can sympathize with<br/>
what you are going through.  Because of the British culture which I find to<br/>
be so oppresive (and is one of the reasons I do not live there) I think it&#39;s<br/>
going to take a long time for many of them to get the stick out of their<br/>
bums and stop being so uptight.  I do hope you are coming back to America as<br/>
some point so that you can continue to be with other unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Have you looked on any British websites for unschoolers?  I just spoke with<br/>
my best friend the other day (who lives in England and has all of her life)<br/>
and she was telling me that she can&#39;t believe that her baby (he&#39;s 3) is<br/>
suppose to go to school in 2 years.  She thinks he&#39;s way to young.  When I<br/>
suggested that she could always look into homeschooling, because I&#39;d heard<br/>
that people over there did it, she said she was going to look into it, but<br/>
started mentioning teaching him etc.  I tried explaining what we do and I<br/>
could hear the confusion in her voice about letting my kids learn at their<br/>
own pace (speaking of which my 2 boys are in the kitchen right now<br/>
concocting some kind of snack for hubby and I - as long as the bleach is<br/>
locked up there&#39;s it&#39;s all edible or drinkable - God knows what it will be<br/>
though)....  <br/>
<br/>
I liked what you said about unschooling and how it works.  Maybe the next<br/>
time you go to the committee meeting type of thing you could take that<br/>
e-mail with you and read out the parts out loud to them all about<br/>
unschooling and see if you get some positive feedback... You never know...<br/>
there has to be someone in your area other than you that&#39;s interested in<br/>
this life style.<br/>

I&#39;m writing more out of a need to vent than from anything else.  <br/>

slowly moving through our sense of isolation and the interminable <br/>
darkness</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1089589647">I&#39;ve thought about this a bit, having just moved to the UK and all.  <br/>
It seems that it isn&#39;t about (at least for me) the difference <br/>
between &quot;American Culture&quot; and &quot;British Culture&quot;, its about having <br/>
community.  We&#39;d lived in Albuquerque fro 7 years total, with a few <br/>
major departures.  I never missed it, really, before this time.  <br/>
This time we left people we care about.  This time we couldn&#39;t walk <br/>
down the street without saying hello to a bunch of people.  This <br/>
time we owned the park down the street.  Where we are now has a busy <br/>
street in front of us and no shops nearby.  There isn&#39;t a park <br/>
within walking distance, and we don&#39;t no our neighbors cause they <br/>
aren&#39;t around when we, and there is no place to meet them.  Where we <br/>
are moving has a park nearby and an almost village center.  We went <br/>
into a potters on Saturday and Simon asked if he gave classes.  The <br/>
man said no, but said if we ever where walking by and saw him <br/>
throwing a pot we could stop in and he&#39;d give us a full <br/>
demonstration.  He spent a lot of time telling us about the good <br/>
things in the community, and about how it is a community.  So, I <br/>
have hope.<br/>
<br/>
No we aren&#39;t planning on coming back to the US for more than <br/>
visits.  And once we find our place here the pull of the US should <br/>
lessen.<br/>
<br/>
And thanks so much Shyrley for the e-mail addresses and the lists. I <br/>
know now three families I didn&#39;t know who live not to far from us.  <br/>
Well, we have yet to shake hands, but it is a definite improvement <br/>
on where I was.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s to community.<br/>
