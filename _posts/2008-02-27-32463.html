<div id="ygrps-yiv-362892910">I have found a new website called<br/>
<br/>
www.livemocha.com<br/>
<br/>
It has free language tutorials and the opportunity to chat with native<br/>
speakers of those languages all around the world.  And it&#39;s FREE.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m just starting to home school my 12 year old son who hated his teacher<br/>
but was getting straight A&#39;s and miserable.  The school turned us in to<br/>
child protective services as truant when we notified them in writing that we<br/>
were homeschooling.  That&#39;s been interesting.<br/>
