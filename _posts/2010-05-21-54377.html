<div id="ygrps-yiv-576901511">-=-my middle son Ben is now 7. he has a tendancy to be quick to anger  <br/>
but for the most part quickly calms down when his feelings are  <br/>
validated.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Rather than validating feelings that arise after he&#39;s angry, look at  <br/>
ways to avoid the anger in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
Help him breathe first before speaking, &quot;count to three,&quot; anything  <br/>
that will help him pause and think.<br/>
<br/>
Not all feelings are worthy of validation.  But if he&#39;s being  <br/>
disregarded until he blows up, talk to the people who are disregarding  <br/>
him in the first place.<br/>
<br/>
And about the language, I would say &quot;Did you breathe before you  <br/>
spoke?&quot;   If he said no, I&#39;d say then you need to do that next time.   <br/>
I wouldn&#39;t go into details about what and why about the particular  <br/>
language every day.  You&#39;re doing that; it&#39;s not helping.  If he said  <br/>
yes, he did breathe before he spoke, I would say &quot;Then next time I  <br/>
guess you need to take TWO deep breaths, because you still said  <br/>
&quot;idiot.&quot;   I wouldn&#39;t make a big deal about it, but I wouldn&#39;t ignore  <br/>
it, ever, when it happened.  If we were going out where other people  <br/>
were going to be I would make sure he had eaten, had some water with  <br/>
him, had some knowledge about the plans for the day, and had been  <br/>
reminded to breathe if he started to feel frustrated.   Not normal  <br/>
breathing, a really long, deep breath.   The best way to get a really  <br/>
deep breath in is to breathe out all the air that&#39;s already in there,  <br/>
and not really fast, either, but consciously breathe out.<br/>
<br/>
That might be a little fun to play with, breathing out, and maybe even  <br/>
grunting, or thinking of cartoon bulls, breathing out and getting  <br/>
really still.   If all the air is out of him, he won&#39;t be able to  <br/>
speak until after he&#39;s breathed in.  So before the situations,  <br/>
practice breathing in.  Maybe make it a breath-holding contest, for  <br/>
fun, in a light moment, with everyone in the family.   See how long  <br/>
you can hold your breath out.  And huff out the last little bit.  And  <br/>
again.   And wait.   That breath that follows is going to be all new  <br/>
air.  Talk about balloons, maybe, and as that air comes in feel and  <br/>
see your posture change.  Maybe do it in a mirror.  If he doesn&#39;t want  <br/>
to don&#39;t make him do it; do it yourself in a fun way and he might join  <br/>
in.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-810616924">My son, around that age, had problems where he couldn&#39;t focus well enough to<br/>
say or do what he wanted.  Once he told me it was the &quot;hyper bugs&quot; that were<br/>
taking over.  So we made a game out of breathing the hyper bugs out.  Slow<br/>
deep breath in, to capture them all in the breath net, then long slow breath<br/>
out to make sure none got blown back inside.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps this would work, but with frustration bugs or anger bugs instead.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1110952334">===I would love to hear responses on this as I am having the exact same<br/>
issue with my daughter who is 10 yo.===<br/>
<br/>
With my older daughter I tried to make sure that she was fed and rested and<br/>
had used the bathroom recently &lt;g&gt;. If those weren&#39;t triggering her<br/>
unhappiness it sometimes was the noise level or feeling too warm or that<br/>
someone was in her personal space.<br/>
<br/>
Occasionally it was none of those things. Sometimes sadness manifests itself<br/>
as outbursts towards other people. Sometimes she was frustrated with other<br/>
children&#39;s behavior. More mom-attention and mom-time was a way to help her.<br/>
Hugs and sitting together close enough to touch worked really well as did<br/>
one-on-one attention and coaching on other ways to respond.<br/>
<br/>
I always, though, made it a point to let her know that even if she was<br/>
feeling bad, it was not OK to treat others poorly.<br/>
<br/>
Best wishes, Cara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1929954714">My daughter had similar issues with temper, but she was hitting her brother and having anger outbursts with friends.  It had to do with her feeling powerless with brother--not getting her way.  And with friends it&#39;s had to do with misunderstandings which, when cleared up, tend to melt away.  The more experience she&#39;s had with clearing up misunderstandings, the more her mind seems to be opening to not going there in the first place--but that&#39;s taken time and maturity.  The powerless thing has also taken lots of conversation with older brother--he treats her in certain ways that he feels very entitled to and isn&#39;t always even aware of.<br/>
<br/>
We talked about it a lot, and around the end of 8 she started to take herself out of the situation when she got frustrated, until she calmed down.  She then had to deal with the storming off putting people off--but it was better than hitting or an outburst.  We approached it like that--that it was a better choice, but that there were better choices still to be made.  <br/>
<br/>
She has those intense, quick-fire hormones.  Thinking of it that way has really helped to find strategies that would work for her.  The interesting thing is that when they subside, she is completely ready to make up or move on--she really doesn&#39;t hold grudges, and she&#39;s very happy to apologize when she feels better or has more understanding of the situation.  I think this side of her is charming, and is what has helped her friends to understand and deal with her!  <br/>
<br/>
Now, at 11 1/2, I can see how far she&#39;s come.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This was exactly what went on with Roxana. Around the age of 10 she got <br/>
the ability to get away, fast, just before she would explode (not every <br/>
time, but lots of times). There were people who were critical of that, <br/>
called it &quot;storming off,&quot; in a negative way. But, I knew that it was a <br/>
big step forward for her and I&#39;d stop others from following her and <br/>
insisting that she should deal with the problem immediately.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra talks about how different bodies probably handle adrenaline <br/>
differently. For some it hits them fast and furious, for others it is <br/>
slow to flow, but also slow to dissipate. Roxana says, and always said, <br/>
that her anger took her by surprise, that she really didn&#39;t have enough <br/>
warning signals to stop and make any other decision. Even trying to <br/>
breathe first seemed impossible to her. She&#39;d be already furious and <br/>
shouting or saying things she later regretted, at the exact same time <br/>
that another part of her brain would be telling her to stop and breathe <br/>
first. Looking back (she&#39;s 22 now and has full self-control), I think <br/>
Roxana&#39;s fight or flight body chemical responses were super super quick <br/>
and intense. She was little and when she felt wronged, it felt like <br/>
being attacked to her, and she had an instant and super strong <br/>
physiological reaction - she was immediately awash in &quot;fight&quot; mode <br/>
chemicals. Switching to &quot;flight&quot; was doable because those same chemicals <br/>
can lead to that option. Switching to &quot;calmly discuss the problem&quot; just <br/>
wasn&#39;t a realistic option when all those fight or flight chemicals were <br/>
raging in her body.<br/>
<br/>
Rox&#39;s sisters learned quickly to let her leave and then let her return <br/>
without much comment. Sometimes, though, she&#39;d have a problem with <br/>
friends, who would get their moms involved and then the mothers were <br/>
insistent that she should stay and &quot;talk it out&quot; right then and there <br/>
and they would get really pushy about it. There were times I said very <br/>
firmly and clearly (to moms, mostly, but maybe a few times to kids), <br/>
&quot;Please do NOT follow Roxana when she needs to get away. Let her go on <br/>
her own and leave her alone. She&#39;ll come back when she feels ready to <br/>
work things out.&quot; I stood guard a few times at park days - Rox was off <br/>
on her own, crying and very upset, and I prevented anyone from going to <br/>
her and insisting she &quot;talk about it.&quot; I know for a fact that there were <br/>
parents there who thought I was cruel not to go to her myself, but I <br/>
knew she needed space around her to recover. Looking back, I think it <br/>
was that she needed a certain amount of time for the fight or flight <br/>
chemicals to dissipate.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s a great 22-year-old now - I know her friends would describe her as <br/>
even-tempered and sweet. She still does have a very very strong sense of <br/>
justice - she feels it strongly when things seem unfair - it infuriates <br/>
her still. But she can cope. She has perspective. She &quot;feels&quot; it but <br/>
doesn&#39;t blow up over it. Example would be that her registration window <br/>
at her university was Wednesday morning. They get 2 hours to register, <br/>
then their window closes and they can&#39;t make any changes until just <br/>
before school starts in the fall - no adding or dropping or changing <br/>
classes. There was a glitch in the computer system during her window and <br/>
it didn&#39;t recognize that she&#39;d met the prerequisites for a series of <br/>
courses she needs to take to graduate. So it would not let her register. <br/>
She emailed support, they emailed her back that they&#39;d fied it, but they <br/>
took two hours to do it and her window closed, so she couldn&#39;t get into <br/>
the classes. They&#39;re now all full. That kind of unfair frustration is <br/>
exactly the kind of thing that used to completely throw her - something <br/>
not her fault, frustrating, and unfair. But, this time, she anticipated <br/>
they might take too long to fix it and so she looked around for some <br/>
other courses to take, found some others that seem interesting to her, <br/>
and really more than made the best of it. Ended up with some classes she <br/>
would otherwise not have taken and she&#39;s looking forward to them.<br/>
<br/>
Rox doesn&#39;t let everybody see all her intensity - all the strong <br/>
feelings she still has. She keeps it inside and only a few people even <br/>
suspect it is there. She can still &quot;feel&quot; explosive about little things <br/>
(to others) when they seem very unfair. She will excuse herself and go <br/>
to the bathroom when people are playing a game and she thinks some <br/>
decision was a bad one. I think her biochemistry has changed, some, with <br/>
maturity, but mostly she has learned various strategies to handle it.<br/>
<br/>
So - for those of you with quick-trigger kids who don&#39;t seem to have <br/>
self-control, I guess I&#39;m saying do the best you can to help them now in <br/>
ways that work best for them. Don&#39;t assume that helping them understand <br/>
how to problem solve, for example, is useful. Roxana  understood quite <br/>
well how to problem solve. That wasn&#39;t her problem at all and all <br/>
attempts to help her understand it just caused her greater frustration <br/>
and made things worse. The most important thing I did was really listen <br/>
to Roxana and really pay attention to what seemed to help and what <br/>
didn&#39;t. Enlist the child&#39;s help - it isn&#39;t like the kid wants things to <br/>
be hard - kids want to be happy, too.<br/>

Kirby is 23.  He used to get angry FAST when he was little, but now he  <br/>
hardly ever gets angry.  Partly it was karate, for him, I think.   <br/>
Partly it was being an analytical guy about social interactions and  <br/>
seeing the danger of hotheadedness.  But either he found tools or he  <br/>

We&#39;ve only run into one bad situation, and it was pretty bad, with a mom that had really strong opinions about exactly how it should work.  But when she&#39;s upset, she doesn&#39;t want to talk to anyone, including me.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-&gt; So - for those of you with quick-trigger kids who don&#39;t seem to have <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; self-control, I guess I&#39;m saying do the best you can to help them now in <br/>
&gt; ways that work best for them. Don&#39;t assume that helping them understand <br/>
&gt; how to problem solve, for example, is useful. Roxana  understood quite <br/>
&gt; well how to problem solve. That wasn&#39;t her problem at all and all <br/>
&gt; attempts to help her understand it just caused her greater frustration <br/>
&gt; and made things worse. The most important thing I did was really listen <br/>
&gt; to Roxana and really pay attention to what seemed to help and what <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t. Enlist the child&#39;s help - it isn&#39;t like the kid wants things to <br/>
&gt; be hard - kids want to be happy, too.-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-393642315">Hi: I just want to clarify that my daughter that I wrote about below wasn&#39;t<br/>
a quick-trigger kid like Pam&#39;s daughter.  Best wishes, Cara<br/>

&gt;  ===I would love to hear responses on this as I am having the exact same<br/>
&gt; issue with my daughter who is 10 yo.===<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With my older daughter I tried to make sure that she was fed and rested and<br/>
&gt; had used the bathroom recently &lt;g&gt;. If those weren&#39;t triggering her<br/>
&gt; unhappiness it sometimes was the noise level or feeling too warm or that<br/>
&gt; someone was in her personal space.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Occasionally it was none of those things. Sometimes sadness manifests<br/>
&gt; itself as outbursts towards other people. Sometimes she was frustrated with<br/>
&gt; other children&#39;s behavior. More mom-attention and mom-time was a way to help<br/>
&gt; her. Hugs and sitting together close enough to touch worked really well as<br/>
&gt; did one-on-one attention and coaching on other ways to respond.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I always, though, made it a point to let her know that even if she was<br/>
&gt; feeling bad, it was not OK to treat others poorly.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Best wishes, Cara<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1433485393">My oldest daughter, Roya, is getting married in August. Her fiance is a <br/>
peace officer/park ranger at Griffith Park in Los Angeles and just got a <br/>
notice that he&#39;s for sure being laid off due to city budget cuts. Roya <br/>
had just turned in notice that she&#39;s quitting her job because she&#39;s <br/>
starting graduate school. Her job was about a 50 hours per week, <br/>
average. They&#39;ve asked her to stay on as a part-time employee, so she is <br/>
going to do that, and she has another part-time job for the summer only. <br/>
He isn&#39;t having any luck finding work (been looking, because the <br/>
handwriting was on the wall for a while).<br/>
<br/>
They had been planning a European honeymoon or maybe Hawaii or Costa <br/>
Rica or at least something very exciting for a Southern California, USA, <br/>
couple, but now they are looking for inexpensive places. The wedding is <br/>
August 7th - so we&#39;re talking a week or two starting August 8th.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m trying really hard to find a way to make this related to <br/>
unschooling, but what I really want is to ask anybody who has any <br/>
suggestions or maybe a vacation home somewhere interesting that you&#39;d <br/>
like to offer to them to use, please email me OFFLIST.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the unschooling part, I guess. They are having a backyard <br/>
wedding and are very focused on the wedding as a union of families, not <br/>
just the two of them. It has been really interesting and fun to watch an <br/>
unschooled young woman plan her wedding. She has absolutely no interest <br/>
in doing anything in any particular conventional way just because it is <br/>
conventional - that doesn&#39;t enter into consideration. It is all about <br/>
what is meaningful to them, what is beautiful, and what brings their <br/>
friends and families together with the most love and joy. She isn&#39;t <br/>
rejecting convention, not by any means, but she isn&#39;t tied to it at all <br/>
- she picks and chooses what she wants and leaves the rest.<br/>
<br/>
Also, her fiance wasn&#39;t homeschooled or unschooled, and, although he&#39;s <br/>
agreed to it for their kids, once in a while he expresses concerns about <br/>
it. Her answer is kind of simple - &quot;You love me, right? You think I&#39;m <br/>
awesome, right? Well, I was unschooled.&quot; So - this is a new and <br/>
different kind of dynamic that will take place between parents, now that <br/>
our unschooled kids are growing up and getting married and having kids. <br/>
When my husband was skeptical, I could not point to myself as an example <br/>
of an unschooler, but that&#39;s exactly what my daughter will be able to do.</div>
