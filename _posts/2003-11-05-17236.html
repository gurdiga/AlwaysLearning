<div id="ygrps-yiv-2049110705">Well!  <br/>
<br/>
There is a &quot;yatta&quot; video (in Japanese) and there&#39;s a humorous take-off on it <br/>
with pictures that look like what it sounds like in English.  That&#39;s quite <br/>
twisted, but for the benefit of any of you familiar with that, it&#39;s a lead in.<br/>
<br/>
For those who have no idea what I just said, it doesn&#39;t matter.<br/>

When you see the pictures, the words sound different.<br/>
<br/>
Interesting!!<br/>
