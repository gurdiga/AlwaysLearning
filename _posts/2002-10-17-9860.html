<div id="ygrps-yiv-1556475887">Hi folks!<br/>
First, I wanted to say how wonderful it was to meet some of you at the SC <br/>
conference. I, my partner Beth, and son Julian all had a wonderful time.  And <br/>
it was great getting to spend some time with Sandra, although I don&#39;t know <br/>
how entertaining I was for her given the circumstances (I went to the <br/>
emergency room with her.)<br/>
<br/>
As I mentioned to some of you, after the conference (we actually left early <br/>
Sunday, after Anne&#39;s amazing talk) we headed down to Englewood, FL, where my <br/>
mother is very ill and dying. Beth and Julian left this morning, and I am <br/>
here to be with my mom and my sister (whose house we&#39;re all at.)  I don&#39;t <br/>
know how long I will be here. It is excruciating thinking about being away <br/>
from Beth and Julian for an extended time, but at the same time it&#39;s the <br/>
right thing to do. Julian has a lot of things he&#39;s doing at home, so I didn&#39;t <br/>
want to push him into staying here. So, we&#39;re going to experience <br/>
long-distance unschooling for a bit. If anyone has any ideas for us, let us <br/>
know.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra, I&#39;m glad you&#39;re able to get around a bit, but I&#39;m so sorry you feel <br/>
so awful. I talked to my best friend, who is an expert on the Americans with <br/>
Disabilities Act and an attorney, about what happened, and she told me that <br/>
Clarion is part of a huge chain that is notorious for LOTS of ADA violations <br/>
and suits. She says that if you&#39;re up for it that suing in this case would be <br/>
a very noble thing to do. :)  (Obviously it would be a safety negligence suit <br/>
in this case rather than an ADA suit, but the results would most likely be <br/>
the same).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that&#39;s what&#39;s happening here.<br/>
Thanks, Kelly for doing such a great job on the conference.<br/>

<br/>
That was generous and wonderful.<br/>
I had someone&#39;s hand to squeeze when they did something yucky or scary to me.<br/>
<br/>
I felt bad for Kathryn missing the opening talks and the John Holt <br/>
presentation.<br/>

<br/>
I want them to fix their ramp like LAST WEEK.  I don&#39;t have any interest in <br/>
asking for punitive damages or anything like that.  I WOULD like for them to <br/>
pay all my incidental expenese (co-pays and such), and I would LOVE to have <br/>
proof that they have re-done that ramp.  What&#39;s the noble and moral thing to <br/>
do?  If you want to give her my e-mail address that&#39;s okay.  If Kelly wants <br/>
to use that hotel next year, I do NOT want to piss them off. I also don&#39;t <br/>
want them to wait until just before the conference next year to fix it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m really sorry you&#39;re in for some weeks of big stress, Kathryn, helping <br/>
your mom out and being away from your family.  <br/>

   You were in my thought alot this past weekend but for the life of me I<br/>
couldn&#39;t remember your name. I wasn&#39;t about to go around asking either. This<br/>
is such a tough situation to be in. My thoughts and prayers are with you and<br/>
yours.<br/>

In her sleep is good.  Now instead of months further into the pain seems good <br/>
to me, but not all share my beliefs.  I hope, Kathryn, that you&#39;re at peace <br/>
with it as much as possible, and thank you for sharing your life with us.<br/>
