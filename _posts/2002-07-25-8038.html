<div id="ygrps-yiv-2131007903">&quot;For all of us who enjoy the craziness of our lives<br/>
as homeschooling parents, and want to share the enthusiasm and insanity with<br/>
others with a whacked personality.   This is the place where you can relax,<br/>
joke about the day, offer tips, glean insights, and just enjoy the company<br/>
of other parents intensely invovled with homeschooling and who want to take<br/>
an e-break!  &quot;<br/>
<br/>
This group has been established by DJ Brewer, a mother of four and house-mom <br/>
of over a dozen more, someone I&#39;ve known for many years and one who does not <br/>
[how shall we say...]  stand on ceremony or watch her language.  I&#39;m over <br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
DJ&#39;s not a full-on unschooler, but she has unschooling leanings and symptoms. <br/>
 Her mom lives south of Albuquerque and she used to be in on lots of the AOL <br/>
chats, and that&#39;s why we know each other.  She sent this for me to pass on:  <br/>
<br/>
Dear Sandra<br/>
Can you post this new group I started on a few of the elists you belong to?<br/>
I am sure it will spark some interest.   And if people have too many lists<br/>
and don&#39;t want to belong to it and it dies, who the hell cares! I don&#39;t!<br/>
