<div id="ygrps-yiv-1646499624">Does anyone remember someone described how her husband, who was Native  <br/>
American, coached her on what to expect when she met his relatives for  <br/>

information she could draw on to make courteous choices.<br/>

I&#39;m pretty sure it was here on Always Learning but I could be wrong.  <br/>
Anyway I seem to have exhausted the keywords that I can think of that  <br/>
might relate to it.<br/>

I remember writing about customs in India and people coaching those who would be meeting parents and grandparents.  Not sure whether it was here on at famiyRUNning or facebook.<br/>
<br/>
Might it have been that confusion of &quot;indian&quot;?<br/>

anything up.<br/>

Turns out it was on Unschooling Basics. Maybe someone reposted it on  <br/>
Unschooling.info which is how you saw it.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s the post incase I piqued anyone&#39;s curiosity:<br/>

My husband is part Laguna Pueblo Indian (New Mexico).  Before the  <br/>
first time I<br/>
met my husband&#39;s extended family, my husband explained the customs and<br/>
&quot;different&quot; things I&#39;d see.  He wasn&#39;t trying to play &quot;teacher&quot;, he  <br/>
wanted to me<br/>
to be prepared so that my visit would be pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
I had a wonderful visit with his family and after we left I asked lots  <br/>
of<br/>
questions.  Each time I went back, I had a better understanding of  <br/>
what was<br/>
going on and his family was very accepting of me.<br/>
<br/>
I keep that experience in mind when I introduce Megan to new things.   <br/>
What are<br/>
the customs?  What will most of the other people be doing?  Most  <br/>
schooled kids<br/>
are trained very early how to sit quietly in a group.  Megan started  <br/>
taking<br/>
Taekwondo lessons right before her seventh birthday.  Remembering to  <br/>
raise her<br/>
hand to talk took a week or so because it was new for her.<br/>
