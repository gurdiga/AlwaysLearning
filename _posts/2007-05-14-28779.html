<br/>
When I look back on our eight years of unschooling, what strikes me <br/>
most is how much fun we’ve had. I never expected unschooling to be so <br/>
much fun. In a way, it’s been a kind of an endless summer: eight years <br/>
of watching Rain follow her whims and her dreams and of learning and <br/>
growing alongside her.<br/>
<br/>
With unschooling, no two days are the same. Some days we rise late and <br/>
spend the day puttering around the house, maybe baking pancakes and <br/>
reading together, gardening or watching movies. Other days we’re up <br/>
early and off to museums or classes or berry-picking or visits with <br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
Although we rarely spend an entire day together anymore, I think I <br/>
spend more time with her than do most parents of teens. I really enjoy <br/>
hearing her ideas and insights and jokes, and just being with her. In <br/>
my very biased opinion, she’s a pretty wonderful person.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the time, I don’t think in terms of traditional academics at <br/>
all. When Rain was younger, schooled children would sometimes quiz her <br/>
on the things they were learning in their classes, like multiplication <br/>
facts or spelling words. They would forecast a lifetime of doom and <br/>
gloom for her, and sometimes she would come home upset and determined <br/>
to master the skills the schooled kids were working on.<br/>
<br/>
I walked a fine line, trying to support in achieving her stated goals <br/>
while pointing out the things that she knew that most kids didn’t, and <br/>
gently sharing my conviction that learning things on her own timetable <br/>
didn’t mean she would never learn them, if she needed to know them.<br/>
<br/>
When she was 10 or so, her hitherto almost nonexistent writing skills <br/>
blossomed, and within a year she was keeping a blog or two and writing <br/>
beautiful stories. A couple of years later, she wrote a thoughtful <br/>
essay requesting a scholarship to a summer program and was awarded the <br/>
highest amount possible.<br/>
<br/>
It didn’t matter at all that when she was 9, she would have struggled <br/>
to write a simple paragraph. Her writing score on the SAT she took as <br/>
an eighth-grader was well above that achieved by the average <br/>
college-bound high school senior. She wrote when she was ready, and she <br/>
enjoyed it, and I enjoyed bearing witness to the process.<br/>
<br/>
There’s an idea among some people that home schooling parents need to <br/>
know everything their children will learn, or they’ll need to hire a <br/>
tutor for those topics. I haven’t found this to be true. Learning <br/>
occurs independently of teaching most of the time, and most of what I <br/>
know was never explicitly taught to me.<br/>
<br/>
Indeed, I’m often surprised by what Rain knows. Through books, <br/>
television, radio, talking with people, Internet browsing, classes, <br/>
live lectures and perhaps osmosis, she’s acquired a rich tapestry of <br/>
background knowledge and an impressive skill base. The availability of <br/>
resources for learning in today’s world is amazing to me, and Rain has <br/>
learned to maneuver this world with dexterity and grace.<br/>
<br/>
I’m always here if she needs me, but I would never want to be her only <br/>
source of information. I like that she can explore the world and make <br/>
her own choices. She doesn’t always agree with me, and I think that’s a <br/>
good thing.<br/>
<br/>
I don’t consider unschooling to be a sacrifice on my part but an active <br/>
negotiation between the two of us. In our family, we pull together, and <br/>
unschooling is just an extension of that. Since Rain was born, I’ve <br/>
always either worked or been a student or both, and I’ve tried to apply <br/>
the principles of unschooling to my life as well as Rain’s.<br/>
<br/>
I do the things that I want to do, and I truly enjoy all facets of my <br/>
life (well, except housework!). I feel so fortunate that Rain and I are <br/>
able to live this way.<br/>
<br/>
****************************************<br/>
<br/>
I wish she could&#39;ve found joy in housework too! &lt;bwg&gt;<br/>
