<div id="ygrps-yiv-1186135584">we do own one tv, and it&#39;s in a cupboard with doors that close it from view<br/>
99% of the time.  when we do turn it on, it&#39;s only to watch videos that our<br/>
-5yo son jake has chosen from the library -- and since he almost always<br/>
chooses bill nye, which is fun and full of info (despite the annoying jump<br/>
cuts), we&#39;re not too bent out of shape about it.  we almost ditched the tv<br/>
completely when he was a baby, but then my partner and i decided that we might<br/>
want to rent a movie some night, some day, after jake started going to sleep<br/>
before midnite &lt;g&gt;, and so we kept it as a monitor only.  the reason we<br/>
started allowing videos for jake at all is because he discovered the rack of<br/>
vidcassettes at the library and wanted to see what they were -- and we try to<br/>
stick to the &quot;don&#39;t offer, don&#39;t deny&quot; rule as much as possible.  (here&#39;s<br/>
where you can point out that if we HAD ditched the tv, we could have just<br/>
explained what they were but wouldn&#39;t have had to show them to him.)<br/>
sometimes he chooses things that i don&#39;t like, like the amazing animals videos<br/>
that star an annoying, wisecracking lizard, but it&#39;s really just a mild and<br/>
infrequent annoyance.  what i absolutely hate are all the ads at the head of<br/>
many tapes, but thanks to them we were able to introduce the subject (and<br/>
purpose) of advertising, so jake usually fast-forwards through the ads,<br/>
complaining all the while that they&#39;re just trying to sell something that no<br/>
one needs.  i will admit that sometimes we do wish we&#39;d ditched the tv<br/>
completely -- and so no, you&#39;re definitely not alone in your view of tv as<br/>
ugly incarnate -- but the tv also gives me a good sense of my own parenting<br/>
and family priorities.  for example, if jake&#39;s watching a video on a sunny<br/>
day, perhaps i should have arranged the day around a bike ride, or left his<br/>
paints out, and saved the laundry for evening or the next rain...<br/>
<br/>
tv, the drug of the nation...<br/>

Interesting point you bring up; I wonder though, do you think that your MIL should not have TV on at all in *her* house when you and your family are there? Is that where your disagreement with her lies? If so I am a bit perplexed, why would you push your views on someone in their own home? I can fully understanding wanting to limit/not have TV in your home however how or why do you expect someone else to conform to your beliefs within their own home?<br/>
<br/>
It IS a personal choice, but just because your MIL does not have the same convictions is she really the one at fault? Your child will be exposed to TV in their lifetime whether it be in your MIL&#39;s house or in the airport, stores etc...That should not be a &#39;bad&#39; thing by any means.<br/>

  Ariadna; I am with you on the no-tv household.  It was a personal choice<br/>
  before having children, it is not how I like to spend my time, and I believe<br/>
  it is a as you say a tool of the the advertisers, and popular culture which<br/>
  I am not a believer or participant in (ie wearing the &quot;brand name clothes&quot;<br/>
  perfumes, perfect body, and I do not like the way many programs show people<br/>
  treating each other, which is often shallow, cruel, or self serving, which<br/>
  is modeling behavior I disagree with, and since I believe modeling is how<br/>
  people and children learn to treat themselves and others it is not something<br/>
  I want to observe or have observed by my children. I think it is a personal<br/>
  choice, and if one disagrees with 90 percent of what is displayed on the<br/>
  screen (this goes for most children videos too) then it is a reasonable<br/>
  decision to exclude it from ones life, in the same way that if you disagree<br/>
  with smoking to not allow smokers in your home while they are smoking or<br/>
  have just smoked.  For me, it is not just a concern of how much will my<br/>
  child watch if I open the &quot;flood gates&quot;, and will my child self moderate the<br/>
  amount.  It is for me, that I do not like most of what is on the tv, and it<br/>
  is such a passive activity, and a bit mind numbing.  I never realized  the<br/>
  effects the tv really had on me until I was tv free for a long time, and<br/>
  then had exposures (airport, etc) and saw how choppy and short the story<br/>
  lines and images were, how little time it gave for one to view a scene<br/>
  before flashing to another, and it actually was uncomfortable to watch this.<br/>
  It is not the way the real world is, we don&#39;t see our world around us<br/>
  flashing and changing scenes and views so jarringly, I think it feels<br/>
  shocking to the system that has not accommodated to that type of visual<br/>
  stimuli, and I question the health of it.   I feel that myself and  my<br/>
  child are better off self stimulating or being with stimulating humans than<br/>
  a flashing inanimate box.  In the same way, I never used inanimate soothing<br/>
  devices for my child as an infant (i.e. pacifiers, swings, vibrating baby<br/>
  seats, fake heartbeats playing on a machine because I believed his nature<br/>
  was to need human contact and   human soothing.<br/>
  Now just because I choose to avoid tv, I am not sitting in judgement of<br/>
  others who choose tv.  I certainly also respect and uphold others choice to<br/>
  include tv, in the same way that I respect others food choices and religious<br/>
  choices.  What I don&#39;t appreciate is when people (like my MIL) think my<br/>
  choice has no value, and chooses to have the tv on in front of my child<br/>
  behind my back, because she had decided my choice has not merit.  This is a<br/>
  violation, just as if she offered my child a food we avoided, or as an older<br/>
  child allowed him to have alcohol or exposed him to cigarette smoke.  This<br/>
  is a lifestyle choice our family has made , we all agree on it, and it needs<br/>
  to be respected.<br/>
<br/>
  Well this is my first post on this board though I&#39;ve been a<br/>
  lurker....perhaps I won&#39;t be welcome after this (hee hee)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-636703442">i just wanted to add that we had this same experience -- that of not noticing<br/>
how truly annoying (mind-numbing, desensitising, boring, whatever) tv, in<br/>
general, is until we quit watching it for some time.  we had a houseguest a<br/>
couple of months ago who chose to turn the tv on one night -- to a show i&#39;d<br/>
watched and enjoyed years ago, no less -- and i was surprised by the lack of<br/>
depth, jumpy images, etc.  we have friends who&#39;ve said the same thing -- that<br/>
they knew they wouldn&#39;t MISS tv, but, after they&#39;d quit watching for a while,<br/>
were surprised how much it ANNOYED them when it was on.<br/>
<br/>
btw, we&#39;re in the same boat with the toxic inlaws, too.  in fact, their<br/>
extremely negative (verbal, in front of our child) response to our choice to opt<br/>
for &quot;this homeschooling bulls**t&quot; (the last in a string of negative responses to<br/>
just about every parenting choice we&#39;ve made) has caused us to pretty much cut<br/>
off contact.<br/>

We ask my folks to turn off the tube when we visit, simply explaining that we came to actively visit, not passively veg in front of the tube.  If they&#39;d rather watch TV (like if there&#39;s a ballgame on or something), they let us know they&#39;ll be watching, and<br/>

<br/>
The exposure I refer was actually at a vacation rental house we all pitched<br/>
in to rent and spend a week visiting together (we are west coast and she is<br/>
east coast).  So it was neutral turf, and my husband, son and I had no where<br/>
to go to avoid the tv, and we have made a concious choice to avoid it, as<br/>
firmly as a nonsmoker avoids smoke filled houses if you understand what I<br/>
mean.  So it felt like a violation. She had a tv she could watch in her own<br/>
room upstairs but chose to turn on the one in the livingroom, and so we<br/>
needed to hide out in the tiny little bedroom with my son and try and spend<br/>
the evening reading every book we could find and keep him and ourselves<br/>
entertained, yet not having the &quot;visit&quot; we had spent so much money and time<br/>
to go there and do.  This was sort of an evening ritual for her.<br/>
<br/>
We do not live near her, but if we did I would, as I said expect her to<br/>
respect our values and choices and not expose my son to tv.  Although tv<br/>
viewers cannot understand this point of view (just like a smoker may not see<br/>
the big deal with smoke filled rooms)  I feel ANY exposure, especially in<br/>
the primary years, when he is still establishing his tastes, personality,<br/>
and values, any exposure is toxic.  I realize this is not a common belief,<br/>
but that is not the point, the point is he is my responsibility, and  I have<br/>
worked hard to protect his innocence as a child, that includes avoiding<br/>
media like tv and videos.  If she was a smoker she would be expected not to<br/>
smoke in his presence.  Same thing.  Or she could choose to visit him at our<br/>
house and follow our values, if she felt she should be able to do whatever<br/>
she wants in her house, regardless of his or our presence.<br/>
<br/>
To your point about exposure some day, yes, very true.  In fact I have a<br/>
plan for exposing him someday, when I feel instinctively the time is right,<br/>
and he has some stronger sense of self, and will be less able to be<br/>
disturbed or affected by the images as he will understand how unreal they<br/>
often are.  Also, we can explain the psychology behind manipulative<br/>
programing, advertising etc.  Now I do believe at a certain time it will be<br/>
useful to include videos with information he finds useful, especially during<br/>
homeschooling, and fullu expect to enjoy with him quality movies someday.<br/>
But as I said (an amazingly even the American Academy of Pediatrics agrees<br/>
in their statement that no child under age of 2 should view any tv or video)<br/>
that the smaller years are not the time for this type of viewing.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your thoughtful questions!<br/>

I thought of something else I wanted to add, and wanted  your thoughts on<br/>
this.  My MIL has a daughter much younger than the rest of us (22) who was<br/>
also at this vacation house. The same evening I refer to with the tv<br/>
concern, this daughter arrived in the evening, and the MIL got very angry<br/>
because she felt the daughter had been out smoking pot, and warned her if<br/>
she was going to be high she could not be in her (MIL) presence, at this<br/>
vacation house (equal turf right) and eventually the daughter left the<br/>
vacation early.  It seems to me this example is one of the MIL feeling her<br/>
values were being infringed on by being exposed to something (a person who<br/>
was high) being in her presence.  Like I felt our values were infringed on<br/>
by playing the tv, knowing we did not enjoy it at all.  What do you think?<br/>
Thanks.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1642936935">I must admit, I am stunned, I mean stunned at the anger in some of these<br/>
messages, as I wrote in one of my emails, I did not want, desire or care to<br/>
convince or debate the value or lack of value of tv with others who are<br/>
users.  I will also say the feeling of being attacked is shocking.  I<br/>
participate in other list serves, and have not seen this type of behavior,<br/>
perhaps this is an isolated thread but it does not shed a good light on this<br/>
board.  So as I have said:  I simply noted a parent who was on this board<br/>
asking &quot;is there any other parent on this board who does not use a tv?  and<br/>
I desired to respond to her and make a connection.  We seemed to be 1. a<br/>
minority, and 2. like minded so it was worth replying to her.   I never<br/>
posted any argument to all the pro tv posts I had been seeing and reading<br/>
because as I have said repeatedly, its not my place to judge, and I may say<br/>
neither is it yours!  It is not useful to continue to &quot;debate&quot; this issue<br/>
and defend my position to someone who disagrees because I really dont care<br/>
if you disagree with my post, I was not posting to create a discourse with<br/>
you, simply to make the connection with the parent who sounded like minded.<br/>
NOT a crime I think so I will leave this court room guilt free.  I have<br/>
plenty of responses to your retorts below, but I cannot see the purpose in<br/>
continuing, with the one exception of answering your one question for a<br/>
resource and that is see it yourself in Mothering magazine, search the web<br/>
site if you don&#39;t get the magazine, or call/email the AAP yourself.  It is a<br/>
quite well known recommendation that got a lot of attention (from both<br/>
sides) so I am surprised you did not know it.  (perhaps it was not broadcast<br/>
on tv?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-146099075"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;i just wanted to add that we had this same experience -- that of not noticing<br/>
&gt;how truly annoying (mind-numbing, desensitising, boring, whatever) tv, in<br/>
&gt;general, is until we quit watching it for some time.  we had a houseguest a<br/>
&gt;couple of months ago who chose to turn the tv on one night -- to a show i&#39;d<br/>
&gt;watched and enjoyed years ago, no less -- and i was surprised by the lack of<br/>
&gt;depth, jumpy images, etc.  we have friends who&#39;ve said the same thing -- that<br/>
&gt;they knew they wouldn&#39;t MISS tv, but, after they&#39;d quit watching for a while,<br/>
&gt;were surprised how much it ANNOYED them when it was on.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve always felt the same way, and I mostly avoid TV.  *But* my dh loves TV <br/>
and my son does too.  He seems to do a lot of his learning by watching.  We <br/>
didn&#39;t have a TV in the house for around 10 years.  I thought I had the <br/>
perfect solution.  There are 2 TVs next door at the in-laws, and my guys <br/>
would watch over there.  At first, Lars wasn&#39;t comfortable alone in their <br/>
basement, so he really only watched when his dad did.  Then he got <br/>
comfortable over there and started practically living there.  They both <br/>
did.  My dh basically moved his office over there and would watch while <br/>
doing paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
It took me a long time, but I finally decided that having a home life <br/>
*with* TV was better than no home life without it.  I was also concerned <br/>
about Lars sitting over there by himself night after night after we had <br/>
gone to bed.  So last week we got a TV and cable.  It&#39;s really not as bad <br/>
having it in the house as I thought it would be.  They&#39;re keeping the <br/>
volume low enough so I can tune it out if I want to.  (Very small <br/>
house)  I&#39;ve even been looking in the TV guide for things I might like to <br/>
watch.  I doubt I&#39;ll ever watch much.  (I&#39;d much rather play the email <br/>
game.)  But I think in the long run it&#39;s going to be a good thing.  And I&#39;m <br/>
also seeing what a variety of shows Lars watches.  He watches stuff I&#39;d <br/>
call junk, and I keep my mouth shut.  But now that it&#39;s in the house, I see <br/>
how much he watches that I could call &quot;educational&quot;.  It really is an <br/>
important part of *his* education.<br/>
<br/>
And the reason I finally agreed to TV in our house?.............the last TV <br/>
discussion on the other list.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-912317177">Hi Ariadna<br/>
You asked:<br/>
Does anyone here NOT have a TV?<br/>
<br/>
Yes! We got rid of ours about a year ago. This after increasingly being<br/>
disappointed/disgusted/dismayed at the programming content (rather limited<br/>
in South-Africa, unless you have satellite TV). When we realised that there<br/>
hadn&#39;t been anything worth watching for the last (in our opinion of course)<br/>
for the last 3 months, and we still had to pay the TV license every month,<br/>
we began to rethink the situation. The kids had always enjoyed videos, but<br/>
then the video machine died on us. So the TV went. There were momentary<br/>
regrets, and every now and then one or another of us really wishes we had a<br/>
TV to watch (usually when we are feeling tired and would be better off<br/>
asleep), but on the whole none of us REALLY miss it. There are so many other<br/>
things to do. Since our parents died, hubby and I have become so much more<br/>
aware of the brevity of life. Maybe this has produced an unfair pressure in<br/>
our family - I don&#39;t know. But there are only 24 precious hours a day. I<br/>
love living life, not watching other people live it. However, I do like<br/>
reading, so I guess I am contradicting myself - reading is a kind of<br/>
&#39;&#39;watching&#39;&#39;, isn&#39;t it!!!<br/>
If we really want to watch something in particular, we pack up and head for<br/>
the office - there is a TV in the boardroom and the kids think it&#39;s great<br/>
fun, watching TV at dad&#39;s work! This is once every 2 months or so.<br/>
I don&#39;t regret the decision not to have a TV for now. We will see what<br/>
happens in the future. I guess that if it became a really important need for<br/>
a member of the family, we would consider the acquisition of another one,<br/>
along with a video machine (we always felt that we wouldn&#39;t want to have the<br/>
one without the other - we refuse to be dictated to by the time schedules of<br/>
a silly black box).<br/>
I know many people find TV useful/entertaining/helpful/whatever. We don&#39;t.<br/>
Blessings<br/>
