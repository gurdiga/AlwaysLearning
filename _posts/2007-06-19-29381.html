<div id="ygrps-yiv-891096780">The mystery is finally solved. How does the small arrow on your <br/>

Click on the link below to find out.  The image may take a moment or <br/>
two to download; when it appears, slowly move your mouse over the light <br/>
gray circle and you will see how the magic works. <br/>

OH MY GOSH!<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s wonderful, wonderful.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is a graphics engineer, and I called him and he&#39;s not at  <br/>
his desk.  OH NO!!!<br/>
<br/>
So I called my next most engineering friend who&#39;s on a conference  <br/>
call.  I&#39;m bursting to share that.<br/>
<br/>
A similarly wonderful thing is the DVD menu of An Evening with Kevin  <br/>
Smith.  He does a long, long mime to live music while he&#39;s waiting  <br/>
for you to click something, so don&#39;t click anything so you can see  <br/>
the whole show.   And if you&#39;re not all that interested in Kevin  <br/>
Smith movies, go to the story of when he met Prince, which is one of  <br/>
the best story-telling moments of the past decade.  (Warning:  He  <br/>
does use &quot;the f-word&quot; a lot.)<br/>
<br/>
That story is worth the price of the rental.<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a second Kevin Smith thing Marty got for Christmas and I  <br/>
still haven&#39;t watched it all.  It&#39;s called something like &quot;A second  <br/>
evening with Kevin Smith, Evening Harder&quot; (a Die-Hard joke).<br/>

LOL! That&#39;s great. The kids got a big kick out of it.  :)<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
One of my favorite Kevin Smith stories is about how he suckered Ben<br/>
Affleck into doing a movie for scale.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I didn&#39;t know there was a second one. I&#39;m going to get my Kevin Smith<br/>
Fan Points taken away...<br/>
