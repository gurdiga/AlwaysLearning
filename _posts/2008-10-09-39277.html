<div id="ygrps-yiv-1701571271">Okay, it&#39;s not exactly an epiphany, but it occurred to me the other<br/>
day that the freedom to choose may also free us from the burden of<br/>
guilt, in some instances.<br/>
<br/>
In college, when I started dating my first boyfriend (now DH), there<br/>
were two times when we spent the night together in the same house. We<br/>
did not have sex, or even make out (at that time...!), but I felt SO<br/>
guilty that we did this. <br/>
<br/>
I had been raised that boys and girls do not sleep in the same place<br/>
after a certain, undetermined age, unless they were married. Even my<br/>
male cousins&#39; rooms were off-limits when we played at their house, in<br/>
case &quot;something&quot; happened...<br/>
<br/>
So even though the two instances where my boyfriend at the time and I<br/>
spent the night together (in separate rooms, even) were very<br/>
legitimate reasons (he was locked out of his house in the rain past<br/>
midnight after I dropped him off the first time, and I had no<br/>
electricity in my apartment after a tornado the second time), I still<br/>
knew that my parents disapproved (don&#39;t know why, but I tell them<br/>
everything), and I felt that God must disapprove, as well.<br/>
<br/>
The thing is, I think that God&#39;s smarter than that (my personal view -<br/>
not trying to push belief in my faith!) I think had I been given the<br/>
freedom to make decisions on my own, with the knowledge that I was<br/>
TRUSTED enough to make WISE decisions, and the knowledge that any<br/>
UNWISE decisions I would own up to, then I would have made those same<br/>
decisions but probably would not have felt any guilt.<br/>
<br/>
After all, what I did was not wrong, even according to the &quot;no sex<br/>
before marriage&quot; idea. I helped out a friend, who happened to be male,<br/>
who happened to REALLY like me :) I made a good choice.<br/>
<br/>
And though I hope my children understand that sex is a very special<br/>
act to be shared only when they are certain they are ready, I also<br/>
want them to be free to make choices every day that are based not on<br/>
fear of guilt but rather on the principal of love (the kind of love<br/>
that is implied by &quot;love your neighbor as yourself.&quot;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-161495169">My daughter (12) reads tons of manga (japanese graphic novels) they <br/>
are certainly not fine classic literature but her vocabulary is <br/>
amazing, she is learning Japanese words, culture and folklore. She <br/>
wanted to go to the anime (japanese animation) convention so she made <br/>
a costume. She draws lots of the characters and makes up her own. She <br/>
can write several words in Kanji (japanese writing) she watches the <br/>
videos in english and in Japanese with english subtitles and compares <br/>
the changes that have been made and the editing done. She can <br/>
understand the episodes in japanese now. I think it has provided an <br/>
immense amount of learning but I never would have expected<br/>
it to. I dont really like reading them myself. <br/>
When she was trying to decide which character to go as in costume she <br/>
would make a list with pro&#39;s and cons, and compare and contrast in <br/>
order to pick the best one.<br/>
There also happen to be several manga series based on gay/lesbian <br/>
couples, we discussed the lifestyles and at the convention there were <br/>
groups of teens that would form circles and 2 boys or 2 girls would <br/>
kiss in the middle. We discussed these actions and she decided she <br/>
is not against that lifestyle if that is what makes someone happy but <br/>
the actions in public of kissing like that whether they are gay or <br/>
straight are inappropriate. There have been many interesting <br/>
conversations that have been insired by the manga. <br/>

Hey, listen.  If God&#39;s NOT smarter than that, all the religions in  <br/>
the world should be shut down now, TODAY.<br/>
