Sometimes you see these in puzzles or scavenger hunts, where you have to <br/>

might find close ups of insect eyes and such. (Click on Images.)<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s also some here that are all animals. (The &quot;Challenging&quot; ones are<br/>
only challenging if you&#39;re 2 ;-)<br/>

Supposedly there&#39;s some fruit and vegetable close ups at:<br/>

but my computer was complaining about not enough memory to load Flash at the<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
And a book turned up at Amazon:<br/>
Close Up: Microscopic Photographs of Everyday Stuff<br/>
by Frank B. Edwards, Laurel Aziz (Contributor)<br/>
<br/>
Doesn&#39;t it just drive you crazy when you&#39;ve run across something hundreds of<br/>
times and then you don&#39;t know how to find it when you want it?<br/>
<br/>
I think your best bet is to ask a librarian! She&#39;d probably be able to put<br/>
her hands on a book within minutes.<br/>

We had one from the library lately, but it was just called &quot;What is it?&quot; or <br/>
some such.  A closeup of a strawberry surface stumped everyone here and all <br/>
our visitors.   You could ask a children&#39;s librarian.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Zak has a magazine called Kids Discovery and on the back of it each <br/>
month are close ups of animals and you have to guess what they are <br/>
and unscramble the names below. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
National Geographic World used to have them (maybe still, we don&#39;t get it now)<br/>
and sometimes Games? Games Jr.?<br/>
