<div id="ygrps-yiv-1060654970">Sandra suggested that I post here the *full* text of the letter I sent to<br/>
Life Learning Magazine, my copy of which was lost. I only received it<br/>
yesterday, so I am a bit behind the original discussion about the Report<br/>
that was held online.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I was disappointed in the editing of my letter, even though I understand<br/>
that space constraints mean that sometimes letters must be cut. Aside from a<br/>
few words here and there, the paragraph that was cut (sentences between the<br/>
stars) happened be my primary reason for writing the letter in the first<br/>
place, and my main disagreements with the original article.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
The editor chose to leave in the one paragraph where I agreed with *one*<br/>
idea in the article instead � which will teach me to be balanced and fair in<br/>
future! ;) <br/>

My text follows:<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
For the first time I am somewhat disappointed in an article in Life Learning<br/>
Magazine, which is the �Computers for Kids� report.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I think it is an error to extrapolate the results of studies done primarily<br/>
on schooled children to the lives of unschooled children. *** There is so<br/>
much focus in the article on the idea and of lessons, of academic<br/>
achievement as the primary goal of learning, curriculums, and even<br/>
discussion of school subjects. None of this language has anything whatsoever<br/>
to do with unschooling.****  <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I don�t agree that �it is safe to say that very early computer use � like<br/>
early television exposure � should be avoided or limited�. Hundreds of other<br/>
unschooling parents on line with years more experience than I, agree with me<br/>
from observing the enriched, varied and wonderful growth of their children<br/>
living in freedom. My daughter at 4.5 is free to utilize both of these<br/>
tools, or turn them off, at will � and she does. Since she does not have to<br/>
spend any hours either at school, doing homework, decompressing from the<br/>
stress of her day at school, or indeed engaging any activity not of her<br/>
choosing, she has ample time to be involved in low tech spontaneous<br/>
imaginative play or contemplation, with her father or I, her friends and<br/>
alone � and she does.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
However I do agree that much of educational software aimed at younger ages<br/>
is just dopey, and simply reiterates the disconnected �pre-reading� or<br/>
�phonics� inadequacies of formal workbooks. Jayn plays computer games - for<br/>
fun - and her favorite ones are the drawing and dressing up types. <br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I suspect that the key difference is one of expectations. Approaching<br/>
computers with the idea that they are an educational panacea is part of the<br/>
push for early academics mindset, complete with pressure to conform to<br/>
school-type schedules and milestones, that is anathema to unschooling.<br/>
