<div id="ygrps-yiv-595771230">**If we spent our childhoods doing what our parents wanted us to do and we<br/>
enter adulthood (and then parenthood) trying to fulfill the need to do what<br/>
we want, then we pass that legacy of neediness and unhappiness onto our<br/>
children. And our relationship with our kids isn&#39;t as joyful as it could be<br/>
because using our power to get our way creates an adversarial relationship<br/>
with them.**<br/>
<br/>
Have you seen the commercial for some mortgage deal (probably Fannie Mae) <br/>
where the man is standing in his house talking on the phone? &quot;Mom, I just wanted <br/>
you to know that I&#39;ve got every light in the house on.&quot; Then he moves into the <br/>
doorway and says &quot;And tell dad I&#39;ve got the door wide open air conditioning <br/>
the outdoors.&quot;   I get such a kick out of that commercial, and have gotten tons <br/>
of good conversations out of it with my kids.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is sometimes prone to issue &quot;As long as you live in MY house&quot; <br/>
statements. I always ask him if he really wants to insure the children do whatever <br/>
it is as soon as they walk out our door. He really ought to know better. He <br/>
started smoking on his 18th birthday because his parents had told him they&#39;d <br/>
better not catch him smoking before he was an adult. <br/>
