<div id="ygrps-yiv-222366767">I&#39;m not comfortable when someone says ice cream is great for breakfast, <br/>
or nervously says something about my kids probably eating wild and crazy<br/>
 things (not a quote; can&#39;t think of a quote).  It&#39;s more reactionary <br/>
than it is open. <br/>
<br/>
****<br/>
<br/>
Dan, 10yo, has had ice cream for breakfast a time or two.  It&#39;s not reactionary, it&#39;s just what he was in the mood for.  He&#39;s also been known, more often, to have chicken nuggets or baked beans for breakfast.  He&#39;s my *best eater* whose favorite meal choice is whatever is on Dad&#39;s plate.  He&#39;ll try any food once, usually twice, just to see what it&#39;s about.  There are no texture issues, no foods Dan won&#39;t try, and really no foods he hates.  Like me, when he&#39;s hungry, Dan knows what he&#39;s in the mood to eat. Unlike my mom, I respect that and give him what he wants from what we have available.  My older two have very specific eating habits, eating only breakfast food for breakfast, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
For me, it&#39;s food.  When people, even kids, have the freedom to eat what they want and like, they will -- at some point in time, maybe not today -- find their own level.  I take a big picture, long time-line view of diet.  A child may be 15 years old before he tries and likes a particular food everyone thought was a must-have from day 1.  I&#39;ve also seen both my older kids -- who made traditionally bad food choices while young -- become more responsible and informed in their dietary choices, entirely by their own choice.  It&#39;s all about being open and truthful, sharing information about dietary choices and nutrition as it comes up in the natural course of life.  <br/>
