<div id="ygrps-yiv-126566235">Just after reading Schuyler&#39;s post about breastfeeding&#39;s connection  <br/>
with other factors, I was googling Bob Collier&#39;s newsletter name,  <br/>
&quot;Parental Intelligence,&quot; and lots of stuff on his shows up, and some  <br/>
spy-on-your-kids nonsense, and this:<br/>
<br/>
Something about this showed up in the imbedded webpage description,  <br/>
but the full statement is even MORE **eeek***:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Parental intelligence also appears to influence cognitive development.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Influence of breast-feeding and parental intelligence on cognitive  <br/>
development in the 24-month-old child.<br/>

Abstract<br/>
This study was designed to analyze the relationship between breast- <br/>
feeding and mental development at 24 months of age, independently of  <br/>
the influence of other factors. A total of 238 babies born between  <br/>
October 1995 and February 1998 were enrolled in an observational  <br/>
prospective cohort study. Cognitive development was assessed using the  <br/>
Bayley Infant Development Scale. The results of multiple linear  <br/>
regression analysis showed that infants breast-fed for longer than 4  <br/>
months scored 4.3 points higher on the mental development scale than  <br/>
those breast-fed for less time. No differences were found in  <br/>
psychomotor development as a function of feeding regimen or duration.  <br/>
The positive linear correlation observed between parental IQ and  <br/>
mental development scores at 24 months was also statistically  <br/>
significant (mother: r = 0.39; p &lt; 0.001; father: r = 0.43; p &lt;  <br/>
0.001). It may be concluded that breast-feeding for longer than 4  <br/>
months has a positive effect on the child&#39;s mental development at 24  <br/>
months of age. Parental intelligence also appears to influence  <br/>
cognitive development.<br/>
<br/>
---------------------------<br/>
<br/>
Hello... Genetics?<br/>
If they didn&#39;t compare adopted kids with natural birth children as to  <br/>
the correlation of parental intelligence, I don&#39;t think they should  <br/>
even have mentioned it.   Way most likely the breastfed babies were  <br/>
biological children of the mothers.  Way most likely the people they  <br/>
would find who would be available throughout a two-year study would be  <br/>
fairly self-selected and interested in scientific studies.<br/>
<br/>
When I read a tag-on like &quot;Parental intelligence also appears to  <br/>
influence cognitive development,&quot; I&#39;m embarrassed about all studies.    <br/>
It&#39;s just dismaying.<br/>
<br/>
If at the end of the description of a study on the effect of regular  <br/>
meals on overall health they said that parental hair color also  <br/>
appeared to influence the child&#39;s hair color, it wouldn&#39;t seem more  <br/>
goofy to me.  Perhaps I&#39;m looking at the social-science research world  <br/>
through goofy-colored glasses, but I think that top example came with  <br/>
it&#39;s own 3-Duh goofy glasses.<br/>
<br/>
While I&#39;m on a rant, I don&#39;t like breastfeeding being shortened to  <br/>
&quot;bf.&quot;  We didn&#39;t name Marty Benjamin Franklin Dodd, which I REALLY  <br/>
liked as a possible name, because his initials would be BFD.  It would  <br/>
have reminded no one of breastfeeding.<br/>

I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to analyze this independently of the influence of <br/>
other factors.  Besides that, they didn&#39;t, they added &quot;parental intelligence&quot;!<br/>
