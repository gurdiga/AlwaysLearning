&gt; how <br/>
&gt; to drive around big trucks, and other tales of big trucks.  Then they all <br/>
&gt; went outside where his actual Big Truck was and he asked if anyone wanted <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; get in it.  Kirby said he looked around, and the kids were just kinda <br/>
&gt; shuffling and avoiding eye contact (something fairly new to him &lt;g&gt;), and <br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; he said &quot;I will!&quot; and did.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>On a similar note, but with ME, not one of my boys: Ben and a friend and I <br/>
were at a breeder&#39;s symposium (or other) about alpacas. Now, everyone had <br/>
paid BIG bucks to be there learning about an expensive animal that they were <br/>
all looking at purchasing.<br/>
<br/>
We were split into three groups (Ben & Barbara & I in separate groups). The <br/>
&quot;teachers&quot; were walking us through practical things like giving shots and <br/>
toenail trimming, checking weight and testing fiber. When they would ask who <br/>
would like come up to do it themselves, NO ONE would volunteer except me! Why <br/>
were they there? They paid big bucks to be there and LEARN??? I did <br/>
everything---and often more than once! I constantly asked questions and <br/>
pushed the instrustors for answers/explanantions.<br/>
<br/>
The next day we had NOT paid even bigger bucks for a prenatal and birthing <br/>
seminar, but they offered it to all three of us for the price of one (plus a <br/>
T-shirt that I held out for! &lt;G&gt;), because we were OBVIOUSLY serious and <br/>
interested and it was worth it to THEM for us to be involved!<br/>
<br/>
I was also asked to come back up a few months later a farm-sit (and attend a <br/>
birth) by one of the instructors.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s amazing to me that folks will NOT do something new. Unfathomable! <br/>
<br/>
Good for Kirby!<br/>
