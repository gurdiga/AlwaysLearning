<div id="ygrps-yiv-754428054">This quote is from another discussion, and was about school, but I&#39;ve  <br/>
pulled it for the seed of the idea.<br/>
<br/>
-=- It&#39;s hard to get over the fact that for years, we had to do things  <br/>
for other<br/>
people, completely unrelated to our own selves. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This morning I switched out the laundry quietly because Marty was  <br/>
asleep in the next room, with his girlfriend.<br/>
I hung his work shirt up so it wouldn&#39;t be wrinkly.   I thought about  <br/>
what I was doing, and why.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t &quot;have to&quot; do Marty&#39;s laundry.  I could have &quot;taught&quot; him to do  <br/>
laundry when he was ten (or younger) and bragged to all my friends  <br/>
about it.<br/>
I could tell him if he&#39;s old enough to have a job it&#39;s his  <br/>
responsibility to make sure he has clean clothes to wear.<br/>
<br/>
The way I support Marty&#39;s willingess, eagerness, to have jobs is that  <br/>
I help procure and maintain the clothes he needs to wear.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s 20 years old.  He could do his own laundry.  But there are other,  <br/>
more fun things he could be doing, too, and I was doing laundry anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Am I doing that for Marty or for me?  I could tell his girlfriend she  <br/>
should do his laundry.  I don&#39;t plan to do that.<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s what I&#39;m gaining:  I&#39;m still helping Marty&#39;s life  be safe,  <br/>
clean and comfortable.  He&#39;s still living at home, he&#39;s not paying  <br/>
rent, and we still feed him.  And he trusts us and loves us and when  <br/>
he had a personal crisis situation recently, his first two choices of  <br/>
people to confide in and ask for help were his brother Kirby, and me.   <br/>
(It&#39;s all better and calm and good now, but the first few days I was  <br/>
honored that Marty chose me as his counsellor.)<br/>
<br/>
By helping Marty without shaming or pressuring his girlfriend, I&#39;m  <br/>
making it comfortable for her to be around me too.  She might be my  <br/>
daughter-in-law someday.  I don&#39;t know.  Whether or not, I&#39;d like for  <br/>
our relationship to be a good one.<br/>
<br/>
For Marty&#39;s part, he&#39;s never sullen or sulky if I ask him to help me  <br/>
get something off a high shelf or to move something heavy or to give  <br/>
me a ride.  He&#39;s considerate in lots of ways other kids his age can&#39;t  <br/>
bring themselves to be with their parents.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-962921782">I&#39;ve got to respond to this because Marty is a large part of my parenting<br/>
experience with Hayden. Hayden looks up to Marty and it&#39;s easy to see why :D<br/>
I sometimes step back from my own relationship with Hayden (in those<br/>
angstful moments) and look at him through someone else&#39;s eyes - When I pick<br/>
Marty&#39;s perspective, I want to &quot;make things right for my little buddy and<br/>
get on with the fun&quot; as it seems to me that is their energy.<br/>
I, too, think of those little moments where I *could be* (and maybe in<br/>
someone&#39;s mind there might even be a should in there) less generous and kind<br/>
-- and RIGHT THERE  I stop -- and I choose the kindness because it feels<br/>
better all the way around. It heals the child for whom few grownups made the<br/>
kinder choice. It prevents damage to the child whose grownups strive to make<br/>
the kinder choice.<br/>
When I *do* make the less kind choice (oooh did I have a crabby, snappy<br/>
weekend!), sincere remorse and sincere forgiveness are part of the process<br/>
-- not forced, real and true. (I had a big ol snotty cryfest and felt MUCH<br/>
relieved) Because I create the same space for his less kind moments, too.<br/>
Funny thing is, they dissapate in a big space ;) And then we&#39;re free to<br/>
Start Over and pick kindness in the right now.<br/>
Marty&#39;s why it&#39;s easy to keep Sandra&#39;s voice in my head; their relationship<br/>
(and the relationships she has with all three kids) inspires me to follow<br/>
their lead, fostering what keeps us together and weeding out what pulls us<br/>
apart (usually my own junk). I&#39;m glad it *just makes sense* with me.<br/>
A gift that keeps on giving...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2047341919">I, unfortunately, have those moments too and they serve us best as a<br/>
comparison.  They don&#39;t give us anything good or valuable otherwise.  The<br/>
kind choice, on the other hand, brings ME happiness from the get-go, it<br/>
brings happiness for all of us on a &quot;time release&quot; basis.  The peace is like<br/>
a snow ball, the first kind choice leads to another and so on.<br/>
<br/>
I wish it was like a pill, a sample for families to try.  If they could<br/>
experience just a moment of the reality these choices bring I think they<br/>
would be eager to find out how to make it happen.  For me, it takes slapping<br/>
the &quot;don&#39;t let them get away with anything&quot; voice instilled by my parents<br/>
out of my head.  Without that I can see my kids for who they really are and<br/>
trust their intentions.  Otherwise I would just be missing out on how cool<br/>
and fun they are.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Ooooo nicely pulled out of context!  It is so different in a stand<br/>
alone, I&#39;m enjoying thinking about that!<br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking about the part of being unrelated to our own selves and<br/>
how that relates to service to others!  I do things for my kids all the<br/>
time.  It&#39;s totally related to myself though, very much so, because it<br/>
is out of my love for my kids that I do things for them.  I feel good<br/>
when I&#39;ve done something nice for them, especially if it wasn&#39;t<br/>
expected.<br/>
<br/>
So, I was reading what Sandra wrote and it&#39;s a bit about doing laundry,<br/>
which is funny because we just had our own laundry story happen and it&#39;s<br/>
totally related!  Yesterday I washed Chamille&#39;s bedding.  It&#39;s been a<br/>
while because she didn&#39;t want me to wash them.  I thought it was making<br/>
her room smell bad, and she has a stuffy nose so she couldn&#39;t smell and<br/>
when her nose suddenly works again, it would be nice to smell pleasant<br/>
smells rather than stinky ones.  So, while she was out and about<br/>
yesterday, I asked if I could please wash her bedding for her and she<br/>
let me.  I wasn&#39;t trying to be weird and bossy about it, or make her do<br/>
something she didn&#39;t want to do, I really wanted her to have a pleasant<br/>
experience sleeping in clean bedding, since I know it&#39;s something she<br/>
really does enjoy!<br/>
<br/>
It made me feel good to do that for my daughter, and she was really<br/>
sweet and requested to make it herself after it was all clean, something<br/>
which she has never done before.  She wants a nest, not a traditional<br/>
bed, and she knew how she wanted it done, and doing it was easier than<br/>
explaining it to me.  Frankly, I was happy to oblige because her bed is<br/>
hard to make, it&#39;s against 2 walls and it&#39;s a bottom bunk of a bunk bed.<br/>
<br/>
All that to say, that we were doing things for ourselves and each other.<br/>
Chamille didn&#39;t do something for me, even though it was mutually<br/>
beneficial.  I did something for her, that made me feel good about being<br/>
her mother, and it was something that she appreciated but wasn&#39;t<br/>
pressing for her to have done.<br/>
<br/>
Most of her friends have to wash their own clothes and bedding, as I did<br/>
when I was her age.  It happened every week.  I HAD to strip my bed and<br/>
pile all my laundry and start the wash, even if I didn&#39;t think my<br/>
bedding was dirty.  It wasn&#39;t something that I did for me, I did it<br/>
because if I hadn&#39;t, I wouldn&#39;t have been able to leave the house to go<br/>
do stuff with my friends.</div>
