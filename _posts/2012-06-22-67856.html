<div id="ygrps-yiv-700013852">We&#39;re just back from the park where we were meeting a friend and her little boy. We ate snacks together and ended up down at the creek. Soon after we began playing there, two other families showed up with six children between them, ages 6 to 9, maybe. Our kids played on the edge of this group happily for about an hour, and then a third mom joined their group, and she had brought Popsicles for all of them. They didn&#39;t offer our kids any, so our kids kind of wandered back to us. Then, my son, who&#39;s 6 1/2, walked back close-ish to their group and shouted to get their attention, then asked what they planned on doing after they ate their Popsicles. I suspected by his body language and his tone of voice that he was really wanting to be offered a Popsicle, but the other kids didn&#39;t answer anyway. I asked him to come back toward me, then asked him quietly to stop trying to get their attention and to let them eat their Popsicles. But he got a little frustrated with me, insisting that he wasn&#39;t trying to get a Popsicle from them. He went back to trying to get their attention, I asked him to stop again, he did it a few more times, but quietly, then stopped.<br/>
<br/>
We ended up leaving, frustrated, shortly thereafter, and I reminded him that we had popsicles at home. I asked him if he knew that it wasn&#39;t really considered polite to ask or &quot;kind of&quot; ask strangers for their food. He said he did, and reiterated that that&#39;s not what he was trying to do.  So I dropped it.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not happy with how I handled it. It felt clumsy and heavy-handed, definitely tense, and I wasn&#39;t taking what he said on face value. But I can&#39;t get a good feel of what would have made that situation better, to have done less or more, but in a different way?<br/>
<br/>
I rather wish I would have just let it play out. My sense is that the other kids would have just eaten their Popsicles then gone back to playing, and it would be a non-issue. But my fear was that he would be perceived as obnoxious, and I was trying to give him some information to help prevent that. <br/>
<br/>
What do you all think? What in this situation could have been better?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your ideas,<br/>
<br/>

I would simply have said &quot;Leave them alone,&quot; and then distracted him with something really fun, or walked off with him in another direction so that he forgot all about them for a while.<br/>

Unschooling doesn&#39;t mean everything on earth changes.  It means don&#39;t be arbitrary.  It&#39;s not arbitrary to decide on behalf of your team that if another group has food they&#39;re not offering that it&#39;s not your food, they don&#39;t have to offer you food, and they should be left to eat in peace.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>This is the point where you ignored his wants and made the situation about your agenda to get him to act the right way, which means anything you had to say he&#39;d be less likely to pay attention to.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;d begun with sympathy for what was bothering him, he probably would have taken in  advice on how to deal with it.<br/>
<br/>
You could have said &quot;It doesn&#39;t feel good when that happens. It would have been nice if they had had enough for everyone.&quot; And if he enjoys pretending you could have spun some fantasies, like &quot;It would be even nicer if popsicles grew on trees so we could have them any time we wanted.&quot; And played around with that. You could tell him there were popsicles at home. Or given him some options. Not as a way to make his disappointment go away but to create a sense that the world is full of options even when something unfun happens.<br/>
<br/>
At that  point you could say &quot;You can hang here until they&#39;re done.&quot; Perhaps pulled out something to do from your secret stash in your purse for such emergencies. Or given him other suggestions if he was having problems.<br/>

<br/>
Did you offer him something else to do? That&#39;s something to keep in mind for next time - don&#39;t expect &quot;information&quot; to be enough. He&#39;s little, so sometimes he needs help knowing what to do - not just what Not to do, if you see what I mean. He was interested in those other people, in what they were doing, maybe in what they were eating, maybe not, but they were the most interesting thing there. If it wasn&#39;t appropriate for him to get involved in what they were doing, then chances are he could have used some help finding some other interesting thing to do. Otherwise, it&#39;s like saying &quot;don&#39;t think of a blue elephant.&quot; <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;he got a little frustrated with me, insisting that he wasn&#39;t trying to get a Popsicle <br/>
 </span></blockquote>*****************<br/>
<br/>
It does seem like you jumped to a conclusion and stubbornly refused to consider any other possibility. Did it really matter why he was going over? It could help in similar situations to ask yourself that very question - does it matter why? It wasn&#39;t appropriate in the moment, and that&#39;s what he needed help with.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe the reason for his interest did matter - &quot;does it matter?&quot; isn&#39;t just a rhetorical question, it&#39;s a real one! If you thought the popsicle was the real issue, maybe you could have suggested it was time to go have popsicles, without making a big deal. &quot;Mmm, it&#39;s hot and those popsicles sure look good... we have some at home, and we&#39;ve been here for awhile, maybe it&#39;s time to go have popsicles and watch Spongebob in our cool living room.&quot; <br/>

I don&#39;t know.<br/>

Because we were kind to our kids from birth and we gave reasons when we wanted them to do something, and they trusted us, we didn&#39;t have problems.<br/>
<br/>
Allowing a child to bug other people who are indicating him by ignoring him that they don&#39;t want to communicate is rudeness on the part of the mother.  Your team wasn&#39;t being rude.  It&#39;s not up to the child to figure that out on his own or for the other group to deal with him.   Being his partner means you take the hit if he&#39;s rude, and you take some credit when he&#39;s not.  Teamwork.<br/>

All the other things I suggested in my post.  <br/>
If distraction or change of scenery and activity didn&#39;t work, I would happily (not as punishment, but as going to a more fun place) pack things up and go do something fun, or go buy a popsicle somewhere else if I really thought the popsicle was the important element.<br/>

No, I&#39;m unwilling to clarify it.  It seems crystal clear.<br/>

Do things that make sense.<br/>
Unschooling isn&#39;t magic, and it doesn&#39;t create exceptions for unschoolers in the real world.<br/>

If he&#39;s used to you telling him what to do and how to behave in that manner, it will sound like more of &quot;What you want isn&#39;t as important as behaving nicely.&quot;<br/>

<br/>
Sometimes parents use &quot;we&#39;re unschoolers&quot; as a kind of excuse: we don&#39;t have to follow social conventions we don&#39;t like. That doesn&#39;t help kids learn about the world and how to navigate the very real limits in it any more than saying &quot;no because I said so&quot; does. <br/>
<br/>
In between &quot;we don&#39;t have to&quot; and &quot;because I said so&quot; it&#39;s helpful to think about the reasons for things, and it&#39;s helpful to look for other options. Part of being thoughtful and reasonable, when you have little kids, is realizing that sometimes they&#39;re not going to understand, and sometimes understanding isn&#39;t enough - they need real, hands-on assistance. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>The other kids were still eating their popsicles. I was having trouble recovering from a situation that I didn&#39;t quite understand and that I sensed I was making worse. In that moment, I felt as if I had to change something, and the something I thought to change was our place.<br/>
<br/>
But now I have more ideas of what I could have changed that would have made things better. <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I did drop it. I wasn&#39;t nearly as clear on the situation as I am now. In my original post, I think I said that I wished I would have let it play out. I still do. I came to see that it was my assumption about his intention that caused most of the problems.<br/>
<br/>
In one of her responses, Sandra said &quot;Because we were kind to our kids from birth and we gave reasons when we wanted them to do something, and they trusted us, we didn&#39;t have problems.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I felt deeply discouraged about my own parenting reading this, and I feel the same way when I read disbelief that I didn&#39;t apologize in the moment.<br/>
<br/>
Later, after we had enjoyed our own popsicles, after we&#39;d had fun playing outside in the hose, after the bath and cartoons, when we were snuggling on the couch together and I knew it would really be heard, I apologized that I kept saying he was trying to get those kids&#39; popsicles when he wasn&#39;t, that I&#39;d gotten stuck on the wrong idea. He told me he thought that was a good thing to be sorry for.<br/>

clear. Sometimes it is better to not answer questions on the list - but to<br/>
consider ways you might answer. If you feel you have to answer on the list<br/>
in front of everybody, you might tend to sugar-coat a situation or be<br/>
defensive. You have no obligation to answer personal questions publicly.<br/>
<br/>
I think you might enjoy reading about &quot;ages and stages&quot; of child<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; development. There are some nice little books by  Louise Bates Ames called<br/>
&gt; &quot;Your three year old&quot; (they go up to 8 or 9 year olds, at least). Every<br/>
&gt; child is different, so don&#39;t get TOO hooked on typical behaviors - but<br/>
&gt; they&#39;re nice for getting a sense of brain, physical, and emotional<br/>
&gt; development stages.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You said, &quot;We ended up leaving, frustrated.&quot; That&#39;s very passive as if it<br/>
happened to you, rather than you deciding to do it. Also, who was<br/>
frustrated? You, right? A good exercise is to try to be really clear in<br/>
what you say, &quot;I decided we should leave because I was frustrated with<br/>
_____________ (not sure what you&#39;d fill that blank with).<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;This last part hurt to read. &lt;&lt;&lt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>i knew it might but decided to say it anyway because I thought you might<br/>
benefit from knowing how this all sounds to someone else. Sometimes we&#39;re<br/>
so close to our own children that we lose perspective.<br/>
<br/>
I keep thinking you must have the most well-behaved 6 year old in history<br/>
if this behavior got you so shaken up that you couldn&#39;t even stand to stay<br/>
and let them play longer. Not only does it seem like a normal everyday<br/>
little thing, the kind of thing a parent would handle a dozen times a day,<br/>
it seems like he consciously did not ask them for a popsicle and that shows<br/>
a lot of self-restraint for a 6 year old.<br/>
<br/>
You said you wish you&#39;d &quot;let it play out.&quot; You might be engaging in<br/>
all-or-nothing thinking. Maybe. Do you see the options as control him and<br/>
make darn sure he is not asking for a popsicle or indicating in any way<br/>
that he wishes they&#39;d give him one versus &quot;letting it play out&quot; meaning you<br/>
wouldn&#39;t say anything at all? (Rhetorical)<br/>
<br/>
I might have ignored the whole thing (just let it play out) - because he<br/>
wasn&#39;t asking them for anything. Most likely they&#39;d ignore him and he&#39;d<br/>
move on to something else. But there are other options. I think I&#39;d most<br/>
likely have handled it by going over to him (when he was calling to the<br/>
other kids) and saying, &quot;Let them finish their popsicles, then maybe<br/>
they&#39;ll be ready to play again. C&#39;mon, let&#39;s go ....whatever...climb a<br/>
tree, jump in the leaves, etc.&quot; If he didn&#39;t want to go, I&#39;d probably very<br/>
lightly just say, &quot;Okay - well that&#39;s fine just don&#39;t bug them about the<br/>
popsicles, okay?&quot; And he&#39;d say, &quot;I&#39;m NOT&quot; and I&#39;d say, &quot;That&#39;s good.&quot;<br/>

&gt; feel the same way when I read disbelief that I didn&#39;t apologize in the<br/>
&gt; moment.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Deep discouragement seems a little much as a response to some stranger on<br/>
the internet, but if it is because you, yourself, had a realization about<br/>
how much better you could be doing, then great!!<br/>
<br/>
Someone once said to me that I was oddly happy to have to wear glasses.<br/>
This person said she hated wearing glasses. I said, &quot;I&#39;m SO glad to live<br/>
now when good eyeglasses exist so that I can comfortably see really well in<br/>
spite of my bad eyes.<br/>
<br/>
Aren&#39;t you glad to have the opportunity to be learning this stuff? We<br/>
didn&#39;t have this when my oldest kids were little.<br/>
<br/>
Instead of feeling deeply discouraged, be encouraged by how much<br/>
opportunity you have to deeply consider your parenting options.<br/>
<br/>
And, yes, we ALL have made and will make mistakes. I could tell you about<br/>
mine, but what good would that do? Assume we&#39;ve all messed up and regretted<br/>
our choices. We learned, moved on, and have lots of examples and ideas of<br/>
how to make better and better choices - learned through experience,<br/>
observation, or logic.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-841446186">-=-If he&#39;s used to you telling him what to do and how to behave in that manner, it will sound like more of &quot;What you want isn&#39;t as important as behaving nicely.&quot;-=-<br/>
<br/>
I think that&#39;s true, though, that what a child wants isn&#39;t as important as behaving nicely, especially in public.<br/>
<br/>
When a child knows that what he wants is important, though, it&#39;s a different scenario. <br/>
<br/>
If parents are lackadaisical and unreliable, their children are likely to behave badly.<br/>
<br/>
If parents are attentive and concerned, present and reliable, their children are not as likely to behave badly. If they have reason to trust that their parents do care, they will pay more attention to the parents, too.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From the point of view of people outside that family unit, who might be eating popsicles or otherwise living their own lives within their rights, the parenting philosophies of other families shouldn&#39;t be a concern for them (the strangers), nor should it inconvenience them.<br/>
<br/>
A family shouldn&#39;t be disturbing the peace when they&#39;re out, and I expect the older members of the team to coach those newer to the planet on what maintaining the peace would look like.  Even if they&#39;re unschoolers.  Maybe especially if they&#39;re unschoolers.  Instead of having rules, having principles ( other people&#39;s picnics are private, if someone is on a swing or a slide, they should get to finish their turn in peace, strangers&#39; food isn&#39;t our food... I don&#39;t know what all it would be in particular situations--ideas about what is your group&#39;s territory and plan and what is other people&#39;s territory and plans.<br/>
<br/>
People don&#39;t get closer to good behavior by allowing or encouraging wild behavior.<br/>

<br/>
-------------------------<br/>
<br/>
I see Pam&#39;s point. <br/>
It sounds like there was way too much talking about it on the mom&#39;s part, and kids go to parks to play.  The mom should&#39;ve gotten up and done something so cool with the kids in her group that they couldn&#39;t even think about the other kids for a little while.  And if it looked really fun, the popsicle kids might have hurried with what they were doing to come back over there.<br/>
<br/>
But if our group had popsicles and a kid from another group was calling them and calling them, I would wish the other kids mom would get up and do something so cool with him that he wasn&#39;t focussed on what our kids were doing for a little while. :-)<br/>

<br/>
I figured some readers might be having conniptions about that statement, so i came back to say I&#39;m just tired of unschoolers letting their children behave horribly in public and saying &#39;well, we&#39;re unschoolers.&#39;<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling doesn&#39;t make it okay for kids (or teenagers, in a recent incident) to run up and down hotel hallways at 2:00 in the morning making noise.<br/>
<br/>
Being an unschooler doesn&#39;t make it okay to &quot;comfort&quot; a child who is having a loud fit in a restaurant (when &quot;comfort&quot; seems basically to encourage and prolong the loud complaint, instead of changing conditions so there&#39;s nothing to complain about, or walking the kid out to talk elsewhere, or carry him out to talk elsewhere, or letting the table go and trying later).<br/>
<br/>
The absolutely valid and reasonable expectations of other guests in hotels, other diners in restaurants and other users of public parks shouldn&#39;t be set aside because a family is unschooling.<br/>
