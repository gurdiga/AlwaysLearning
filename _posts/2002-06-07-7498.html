<div id="ygrps-yiv-935224871">We are having 100 plus degree weather now. Ouch, the street is hot when <br/>
barefoot. This week we wound down all our Spring activities, Little league, <br/>
Brownies, our Homeschool play and talent show. Today we skipped going to a <br/>
farm to plant pumpkins, skipped parkday, and stayed in our sleeping clothes <br/>
or no clothes until 4pm. My 2 and 5 year olds cuddled down with me for a <br/>
long nap, while my 7 year old went to a friends house for a bit. We made <br/>
cornhusk dolls, my nursing toddler proptly needed a baby and mommy so the <br/>
baby could nurse. At 4:30 we woke the kids, put on our swim suits and went <br/>
for our daily splash at the local pool, a 1/2 block from home. Now the kids <br/>
and Tim are watching Harry Potter, again, I&#39;m typing more than I have in <br/>
months, and everyone has eaten. Today was refreshing for I never started the <br/>
car, never looked for shoes, never packed a lunch on the go, never had to <br/>
wait with my toddler at another kids activity. We were tired from our <br/>
weekend in Tahoe. The kids still fussed. Riley throw a tantrun because he <br/>
could not play a song on the piano. I handled it well and I&#39;m glad to share <br/>
with you all that I did not tantrum with him. We read, we played, we napped.<br/>

planted enough extra for you! :-)<br/>
<br/>
It was hot, but we&#39;re Arizonans at heart. Guinda seemed cooler than<br/>
Dunnigan, and it&#39;s definitely cooler than Tucson or Phoenix.<br/>
<br/>
A stay-at-home day actually sounds, we&#39;ve been on the go for two weeks<br/>
straight...<br/>
