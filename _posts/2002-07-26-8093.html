<div id="ygrps-yiv-1339162783">&lt;&lt;I&#39;d think it would be pretty warm and cushy to really believe in a <br/>
simple<br/>
religion, to love your bed even if it&#39;s not objectively a great bed, to <br/>
be<br/>
happy with your food without the whole-body-and-spirit angst and fear <br/>
about<br/>
where it came from and what&#39;s in it, to trust doctors without asking<br/>
questions, to just be content with what&#39;s on TV and to believe what&#39;s on <br/>
the<br/>
news and to feel safe because there are policemen on duty.<br/>
<br/>
I want that life.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Oh, yes...I understand that. In fact, I&#39;ve said similar words to a <br/>
couple of people I thought would understand and they were incredulous <br/>
that I even had the thought.<br/>
<br/>
Especially the religion part. There&#39;s no way I can accept any religion <br/>
in totality--maybe bits of this and parts of that, but no one religion; <br/>
but just imagine &quot;knowing&quot; that you have a blueprint for living that is <br/>
&quot;right&quot;. My mother&#39;s neighbor said once, after I made the comment that <br/>
no one really knows for certain what happens after death, &quot;Oh, I KNOW <br/>
where I&#39;m going.&quot; (to heaven). I remember thinking that she must not <br/>
TRULY believe that, or she&#39;d be content all the time.<br/>
