<div id="ygrps-yiv-893068726">Hi All-<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m new to this group, but have been learning at home with my kids for the last 5 years or so.  They&#39;re 11 and 5 and we&#39;ve recently run into a bit of a rough patch with out 11 year old.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve just moved back to the US after a year in India, and settled (for my husband&#39;s job) in a very small, conservative and homogeneous town.  Prior to India we lived in a different part of the country in a big diverse liberal (WONDERFUL!) town, with a supportive home schooling community and close to old friends and family.  Our 11 year old seems to be struggling with the new environment and social circles.<br/>
<br/>
Lately she&#39;s been measuring herself against the &quot;school ruler&quot; - comparing her knowledge to that of her friends and acquaintances who go to public school - and coming up short.  The topics seem silly to me - things like who can multiply in her head faster or who knows which obscure southern  American history factoid - but these are big deals to her.  Sounds like her &#39;friends&#39; are giving her a hard time about not knowing what they do and telling her she&#39;s &#39;behind&#39;.  And so she&#39;s having a lot of heartache and self-doubt.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve had a number of conversations about how she is learning different things and in a different fashion that children who go to school, and we&#39;ve worked hard on highlighting her strengths and accomplishments, but she always returns to the darn multiplication facts!  I think this is made particularly difficult by the fact that there are not outlets and showcases for her talents and interests here, and hardly even any other like minded homeschoolers.  <br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s worked off and on over the years through math books, at her own pace and according to her own interest level.  I&#39;ve pointed out to her recently that if she&#39;d like to know the math facts (or whatever else) that her peers here know that we have the resources to help her learn them, but she resists mightily.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve even pointed out that she could return to school, but she&#39;s dead-set against that too. <br/>
<br/>
So I&#39;m feeling a bit stumped.  Anyone gone through this sort of crisis of confidence with their kids?  How can I help her put down the school ruler and start measuring her accomplishments more accurately?  I&#39;m not even sure if she wants to learn the things at issue - how can I help her clarify her goals and feel good about what she&#39;s choosing to pursue and learn?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your thoughts and ideas!<br/>
<br/>

So I&#39;m feeling a bit stumped. Anyone gone through this sort of crisis  <br/>
of confidence with their kids? How can I help her put down the school  <br/>
ruler and start measuring her accomplishments more accurately? I&#39;m not  <br/>

<br/>
I&#39;m pretty sure she&#39;s right in the middle of the most difficult age  <br/>
for unschoolers.  It will pass.  In the meantime, talk to her about  <br/>
the cool things she does know and has seen and done.  And tell her  <br/>
very few people really know the multiplication &quot;facts&quot; and so what?   <br/>
Get her a solar calculator for $5 or less or show her where a  <br/>
calculator is on the computer.<br/>
<br/>
My kids liked math patterns, so I would make the empty table, put  <br/>
numbers along the top and side, like a graph, and they would add or  <br/>
multiply into the inside for fun.  One time I drew a big one on the  <br/>
concrete on the patio with chalk and they and their friends filled it  <br/>
in, by doing the easy things first (2&#39;s, 5&#39;s) and then figuring out  <br/>
the few that were left.<br/>
