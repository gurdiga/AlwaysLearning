<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529723457">Yesterday a friend of mine called and told me about an accident involving<br/>
her van.   She came home from the store with all her kids and groceries<br/>
and parked in her driveway.   Her kids piled out and she took her toddler<br/>
out of the car seat and carried him in the house.   While she was inside<br/>
her van rolled down the driveway, across the road and into the ditch.  It<br/>
was quite a steep slope so there was some damage.<br/>
She said she ALWAYS leaves the toddler in the car seat until she unloads<br/>
the groceries but this time, God must have told her to take the baby in<br/>
first.   Because of some genetic trait I speak before I think and I said<br/>
&quot; Why didn&#39;t he just tell you to put the emergency brake on?&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
A few day&#39;s ago I called my sister to ask her to look for fabric for me<br/>
in her garage sale-ing and thrift store shopping. (I make braided and<br/>
hooked rugs) She said, coincidentally, a friend of hers who&#39;s moving out<br/>
of the country had been there that morning and given her fabric. (she<br/>
makes dolls)  How convenient!<br/>
  <br/>
Yesterday my mom was here and said she&#39;d been out shopping at the second<br/>
hand store for a long wool coat.   My sister&#39;s package arrived while she<br/>
was here and there was a note from my sis stating her friend had also<br/>
give her this long wool coat but it was too small for her and maybe mom<br/>
would like it. <br/>
<br/>
So I said to Dylan, ~ our little coincidences are just like on &quot;Signs&quot;<br/>
with all their weird coincidences...How Graham was a religious man to<br/>
give his family faith and how Colleen died so Merrill the slugger would<br/>
move in with them and how Morgan had asthma to protect him from the<br/>
aliens and Bo had the weird water thing because the aliens hated water,<br/>
yada, yada and was it really a miracle and God did all that?  And because<br/>
of some genetic trait Dylan said &quot;Why didn&#39;t he just send them all on a<br/>
cruise?&quot;  <br/>

I used to work in a gov. nutrition program that required us to ask clients about birth control.  (The stated purpose was for us to make sure that they had resources to acquire family planning info and supplies, but I digress.)  Some clients would tell us that they didn&#39;t use any family planning, because it was up to God whether or not they had more children.  My supervisor used to say that was like walking into freeway traffic and leaving it up to God whether or not you would be hit by a car.<br/>

of them say the same thing that it&#39;s up to Allah so they don&#39;t use<br/>
anything. Also I ask things like &quot;if you could choose the gender of your<br/>
child, what would it be&quot; and some get very offended because it&#39;s wrong to<br/>
think about things like that as it&#39;s not up to them.<br/>
The same view is felt about things like using seat belts or car seats for<br/>
kids. If they are killed it was Allah&#39;s will!!!<br/>
