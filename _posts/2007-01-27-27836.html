<div id="ygrps-yiv-260059465">Dear All,<br/>
<br/>
I had a business meeting yesterday that turned into a discussion about <br/>
unschooling.  The person I was meeting with has studied Osho <br/>
extensively and told me that Osho was unschooled and that he advocated <br/>
radical unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Is anybody in this group familiar with Osho&#39;s studies?<br/>
<br/>
Kind regards,<br/>
Anna</div>

Never heard of him.  I had a dog named Awshoo once, though, and then  <br/>
one named Oso later, so I thought you were going to tell us about  <br/>
your dog.  (Personal prejudice and connection on my part, but a clue  <br/>
as to how my mind is organized. &lt;g&gt;)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If this Osho is someone you think will help people with unschooling,  <br/>
how about a link to a site?<br/>
If not, that&#39;s fine too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1174311197">-His name was Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh before he changed it towards the<br/>
end of his life. I used to be a sannyasin of his way back in high<br/>
school.My english teacher was a sannyasin and he introduced me to him.<br/>
I was into the meditations but i didn&#39;t have very good times with<br/>
other sannyasins, i went to a &#39;workshop&#39; in NYC and had a male hit me<br/>
for flirting. I saw people selling their homes to contribute the money<br/>
to The Big Muddy out in Oregon. Towards the end there was scandals of<br/>
Bhagwans&#39; people poisoning the town people to win elections and all<br/>
kinds of tax problems...ect. There&#39;s a book called My Life In Orange<br/>
written by a guy who grew up on the Ashram...it&#39;s available in the<br/>
library.- In <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com">AlwaysLearning@yahoogroups.com</a>, &quot;hollywoodapi&quot;<br/>

Oh THAT guy!  Okay.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
If he was &quot;radically unschooled&quot; that might mean he just didn&#39;t go to  <br/>
school when he was growing up in India, but I doubt that, as he got a  <br/>
Master&#39;s Degree in Philosophy before he was too very old.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If I were running a cult, I would promote unschooling too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh wait.  I already promote unschooling.  And I HAVE been accused of  <br/>
running a cult.  But *HONESTLY,* if I have a cult I am totally crap  <br/>
at running one, because where&#39;s my white Mercedes?  Where&#39;s my armed  <br/>
guard?  I&#39;m cooking my own food.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps in my next lifetime I&#39;ll be able to run a proper cult.  Or  <br/>
maybe I&#39;ll be someone&#39;s back-up singer.  That&#39;s always seemed like  <br/>
the perfect job to me.  Easy, no responsibilities other than keeping  <br/>
my throat well and my clothes clean and showing up on time.<br/>
