<div id="ygrps-yiv-789997568"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; Very schooly, but interesting article about praise. http:// <br/>
&gt; nymag.com/news/features/27840/index.html<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I found this article interesting but very frustrating. It presents as  <br/>
a significant shift but seems to be to be a shift from praising  <br/>
*outcomes* as a tool to manipulate behavior...  to praising *process*  <br/>
as a tool to manipulate behavior.<br/>
<br/>
what a missed opportunity that the analysis stays at that level and  <br/>
does not even reflect on the irony of the two forms of praise  <br/>
presented...<br/>
<br/>
Obviously a very mainstream article ï¿½ so interesting that it even  <br/>
goes as far as it does i guess... but sometimes i am disappointed  <br/>
that the Alfie Kohn critiques on praise, rewards, punishments etc are  <br/>
not gathering enough steam to make an impact on such coverage.<br/>
<br/>
maybe i missed something because i did not read the (long) article in  <br/>
detail... but did frustrate me.<br/>
