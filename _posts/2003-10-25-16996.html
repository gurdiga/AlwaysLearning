**I know Danielle Van Dam&#39;s grandmother. What a horror. I&#39;d rather live<br/>
cautiously than ever have to live through something like that.**<br/>
<br/>
But, but, but....   neither of those girls was kidnapped while away from home <br/>
and their parents oversight, nor was their kidnapping the result of careless <br/>
or unsafe behaviour on the part of the child. How on earth can their tragedies <br/>
be seen as a mandate for not allowing children to go or be places on their <br/>
own? Not to mention that that kind of situation is thankfully extremely rare - <br/>
if it were common we wouldn&#39;t all recognize their names - in the same way that <br/>
people across the country do NOT know the name of the boy who died in a <br/>
bicycle/car accident in my town last week.<br/>
<br/>
Children out and about in their neighborhood are rarely at danger from human <br/>
predators as much as they are from automobiles and stray dogs. Most sexual <br/>
abuse of pre-pubertal and young adolescent children is committed by persons the <br/>
parents have brought into their home or in other ways given express access to <br/>
the child. People the parents &quot;know&quot;. Not strangers. <br/>
