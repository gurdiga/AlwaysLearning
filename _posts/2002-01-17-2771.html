<div id="ygrps-yiv-1558065636">I can almost do it (lick my elbow, that is). My tongue reaches about 1 inch from the tip of my elbow.<br/>
I don&#39;t know if I believe the bug one. I can&#39;t be sure, of course, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever eaten any bugs, awake or asleep! Okay, maybe once or twice while bike riding, definitely not 70 insects or ANY spiders... :o)<br/>

Since that one&#39;s not at all what I&#39;ve heard and read always, I question the <br/>
others.<br/>
<br/>
People have been saying &quot;God bless you&quot; to sneezers a long, long time.  How <br/>
long have they known about milliseconds?  Not long.  And IF a heart stops <br/>
during a sneeze, how would medieval people have known that?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Spirit&quot; is from the same root as &quot;respiration&quot; and SO much of person&#39;s <br/>
spirit/breath is out of them during a sneeze, the &quot;bless you&quot; is said (could <br/>
also be untrue, but it&#39;s been the common explanation everywhere I&#39;ve ever <br/>
seen it) to be a charm against the devil entering when you breathe back in.  <br/>
They could have had that idea, but measuring heartbeats in milliseconds, I <br/>
don&#39;t think so.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Wearing headphones for just an hour will increase the bacteria <br/>

<br/>
Does sleeping on your own pillow do the same then?  Talking on the phone?<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s another list that goes around by e-mail that&#39;s not funny enough to be <br/>
really funny, and it claims to be the history of various phrases, but it&#39;s <br/>
not.  It&#39;s just made-up stuff.   I like obvious parody humor, but things that <br/>
are made up and passed off as historical make learning harder.   <br/>
<br/>
Critical thinking...  sometimes I wish it wasn&#39;t so necessary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859845138">i&#39;d heard that because sneezing is often the first symptom of illness, people<br/>
began to bless each other to protect the sneezer from what was viewed as a threat<br/>
of sickness and, with complications, possible death.<br/>
