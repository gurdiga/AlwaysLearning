<div id="ygrps-yiv-559671206">Kirby starts driver&#39;s ed in a week.  Intensive nine-days-in-a-row course, <br/>
just half a mile from our house.   I told him I might want to buy him new <br/>
clothes, take his picture, get him a new lunchbox, and walk him in and tell <br/>
the teacher it was his first day of school, and to be really nice to him.<br/>
<br/>
At sixteen, he just wasn&#39;t as excited about it as I was. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Kirby was so calm about waiting until later, later to take driver&#39;s ed.  No <br/>
pressure from school friends, no big hurry. And he&#39;s busy four afternoons a <br/>
week, with karate and working at the gaming shop, and after school hours are <br/>
the regular driver&#39;s ed times here.  The public schools in Albuquerque don&#39;t <br/>
teach driver&#39;s ed, it&#39;s all done through private schools, but the schools <br/>
cater to school kids so there aren&#39;t morning classes, and Kirby isn&#39;t allowed <br/>
into the adult classes.  <br/>
<br/>
So soon our insurance will go up (way up) and I&#39;ll start sharing my van.  <br/>
Keith has talked about buying a third car every day for over a week, talked <br/>
with each kid, looked at what the credit union is offering in way of <br/>
re-possession, and last night he had a bad car-buying dream.  Poor Keith.  <br/>
<br/>
I think Kirby will be a really good driver, because he&#39;s totally <br/>
rules-conscious and cautious.<br/>

have a Mall that closed and a huge empty lot. &lt;G&gt; The 50 hrs with me will be<br/>

<br/>
I have considered our loss of honor-roll benefits, but I figure the cost of <br/>
school would&#39;ve been way higher than the cost of additional insurance.  Even <br/>
public school costs for fees, sports/music uniforms or at least parts <br/>
thereof, lunches, the right clothes and binders and backpacks and field trip <br/>
stuff.   So I don&#39;t mind paying a &quot;penalty&quot; for having kept my kids intact. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>No need to pay a penalty.  Just fax the insurance company a letter, on your <br/>
&#39;school letterhead&#39; stating that s/he carries an A average and sign it as <br/>
the &#39;principal&#39; or headmistress or somesuch.<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all you&#39;ve got to do.  At least with Allstate.  Maybe dif. with <br/>
other insurance providers?<br/>

loose in cars unaccompanied?<br/>
Back home you can start to learn at 17. Cannot drive alone and must pass a written exam (we<br/>
don&#39;t have driver ed in school - your parents teach you or you pay for classes) and then a<br/>
grueling one hour on-road driving test.<br/>
When I moved to VA I had to take the driving test here cos they didn&#39;t recognise my English<br/>
lisence. 5 minutes around the block, no lights, no left turns, no manouvers. I was amazed<br/>
that people are allowed out in a 2 ton vehicle with just that!<br/>
I remember taking my test back home when I was 23 and pregnant with number 1. After that I<br/>
didn&#39;t drive again for 5 years.<br/>
I&#39;m kinda hoping my kids wont want to learn to drive. I&#39;d be too nervous teaching them<br/>
myself and we wont have a car anyway so that would make it tricky ;-)<br/>
But Heather is only 10 so we have 7 or more years to worry about that particular bridge :-)<br/>

<br/>
I was driving alone at 15.  I could have done it at 14 and 9 months, because <br/>
I was an *honor student* (read that with the proper sing-song voice), but I <br/>
was also not in driver&#39;s ed until summer, when I turned 15 anyway.  In those <br/>
days, any 16 year old could get a learner&#39;s permit and learn on his own, but <br/>
if you were younger than 16 you had to take driver&#39;s ed.<br/>
<br/>
But laws change, and the current deal in New Mexico is NOBODY younger than 18 <br/>
can get a license without drivers&#39; ed.  Nobody can get a learner&#39;s permit <br/>
without being enrolled in an approved driver&#39;s ed course.   <br/>
<br/>
Then there is the two-tiered licensing system.  The learner&#39;s permit requires <br/>
fifty hours with a licensed driver (various will do) who is over 18 and has <br/>
had a license for at least three years.  There&#39;s a little folder in which the <br/>
drivers initial.  Ten of those hours have to be at night.  They also have to <br/>
drive with the driving instructor for (I think) five hours (maybe three, or <br/>
maybe three sessions shorter than an hour?) but that&#39;s after they finish the <br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
After all that they can get a provisional license.<br/>
<br/>
Provisional has to be used for at least six months.  Or rather, they can&#39;t go <br/>
to a full license unless they have been free of citations for six months.  So <br/>
a provisional could last until a kid was 18 if he gets a ticket each six <br/>
months.   <br/>
<br/>
During provisional days, they can&#39;t drive after midnight, can only have one <br/>
minor person in the car who is not a family member.  So a teen can drive one <br/>
other teen, or someone else&#39;s sister or brother, but can&#39;t take a teen friend <br/>
and that friend&#39;s sibling,arty the one mile to Active Imagination.  So Kirby <br/>
will be able to take his girlfriend out alone, but couldn&#39;t legally take her <br/>
AND her teenaged brother who has been their best chaperone.   The purpose is <br/>
to keep gangs of kids from cruising.  But the practical limitations mean it <br/>
creates single-couple dates, instead of a group of friends or a double date <br/>
situation.   I&#39;m not crazy about that.  Not so much about Kirby himself, but <br/>
in general, for a girl who would rather NOT be alone with a guy, but the <br/>
state says he can only take ONE person in his car who&#39;s not related to him.<br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, unless a kid needs a full license as part of a job <br/>
requirement, keeping a provisional a long time isn&#39;t much problem (unless <br/>
there&#39;s something about it I don&#39;t know), especially for Kirby who will turn <br/>
17 this summer.<br/>

with a full licence in the car. They cannot drive alone until they&#39;ve passed the driving exam<br/>
which has been called one of the most grueling in the world - 50% fail first time.<br/>
It seems like that in Virginia, when you turn 15 and however many months you can get your<br/>
learner permit and off you go. It worries me as a driver, a cyclist (and I am very vunerable if<br/>
people lose concentration for 1 second) and a mother - all them young inexperienced people in<br/>
charge of 2 tons of metal.<br/>
It should be made much harder to be allowed to drive. I think people take cars for granted so<br/>
much they forget that they are dangerous machines with the potential to kill. Road death figures<br/>
for the US alone run at 40,000a year. I couldn&#39;t find the numbers for injuries but they must run<br/>
into hundred&#39;s of thousands and most accidents are the result of carelessness and<br/>
inattentiveness.<br/>
Talking of which, I was cycling the other day and the traffic was heavy and slow so I was<br/>
keeping up with some woman in a sporty car. She was on the phone, eating a  hamburger and<br/>
drinking coffee all at the same time. She must have been driving with her knees! Now admittedly<br/>
we were doing about 23 mph but cars can kill at that speed. Fortunately Virginia is outlawing<br/>
mobile phone use when driving as some states have already done. Now, if only they could deal<br/>
with computer use, putting on make-up at 50 mph (I kid you not!) turning round to find something<br/>
on the back seat and reading a book......<br/>

    I think Michael will be a good driver too. He just finished up the in<br/>
class part. He&#39;ll get a call next week for the in car.<br/>
<br/>
**I&#39;ve got one of those. Dylan is 18.5yo and took the course when he was<br/>
16.5yo. We thought he&#39;d be in the course the first possible week and have<br/>
his license the day after his sixteenth birthday. He didn&#39;t think he was<br/>
ready until 16.5 though. He had received his learner&#39;s permit at 15.5 though<br/>
and we drove together at every opportunity. He was already an excellent<br/>
driver by the time he took the course. In Ohio, driver&#39;s ed is not offered<br/>
anyway in the skools, I am told. Even if it had been, we would not have<br/>
availed ourselves of the service as we don&#39;t use skools for anything &lt;G&gt;.<br/>
<br/>
He has a hefty insurance discount for &quot;having all A&#39;s&quot;......until this year<br/>
when he enrolled himsdelf in the local community college, he&#39;s nevr gotten a<br/>
grade in anything....I wrote the letter and signed it myself.  Unlike many<br/>
of the young people in our neighborhood, he has never been ticketed nor<br/>
caused an accident. Like with all things, waiting until the time is right<br/>
for the individual is the best way to go!<br/>

make up something! &lt;G&gt; I said, he gets &quot;straight A&#39;s&quot; in LIFE. She said that<br/>

I&#39;ll mention to Keith that he should try that when he calls them.<br/>

I have considered our loss of honor-roll benefits, but I figure the cost of<br/>
school would&#39;ve been way higher than the cost of additional insurance.  Even<br/>
public school costs for fees, sports/music uniforms or at least parts<br/>
thereof, lunches, the right clothes and binders and backpacks and field trip<br/>
stuff.   So I don&#39;t mind paying a &quot;penalty&quot; for having kept my kids intact.<br/>

tell you that they will become much better drivers after they don&#39;t have to <br/>
drive with someone watching them all the time.  Logging the hours was so <br/>
nerve wracking, I finally just let my 14 yo drive to the country store around <br/>
the corner by himself every day for a while.  (We lived out in the <br/>
semi-boonies at that time.)  It worked.  He learned to relax a lot, and I <br/>
didn&#39;t get constipated, either.  <br/>
<br/>
I learned how to drive when I was 13, in an old red VW Bug that had been our <br/>
family car.  We, too, lived out in the boonies, where my uncle was the <br/>
constable.  His daughter, and both of us 13 and unlicensed, I drove all over <br/>
our little town and I learned a lot.  Of course, we could also drive <br/>
tractors!  So when it came time for the driving test, I wasn&#39;t nervous or <br/>
anything...just drove like I had been for the last 3 years.<br/>
<br/>
I think every kid should learn how to drive a stick.  My future <br/>
daughter-in-law can&#39;t drive a stick and that&#39;s just SHAMEFUL!   It can be so <br/>
limiting.  <br/>

had already taken this that is what we used.   The first time we applied for<br/>
the discount, our local agent didn&#39;t know what to do about a homeschooler as we<br/>
were the first she had ever had.  At the time, we were still with Clonlara so I<br/>
just printed up a report card with Clonlara at the top.  I told the agent that<br/>
we were enrolled with them and she accepted it.  Hope this helps.<br/>

<br/>
Cam&#39;s driving now. Took the written test the day after his 15th birthday. He <br/>
has to have an adult in the car for 6 months, then he can get his restricted <br/>
and not drive alone at night. At 16 he&#39;ll be a full-fledged driver. As well <br/>
as the other zillion 16 year olds in SC!<br/>
<br/>
In SC in the &#39;70&#39;s, it was only a THIRTY DAY learner&#39;s permit! They&#39;ve upped <br/>
it to six months now.<br/>
<br/>
I learned how to drive a stick  (after lesson after lesson after lesson that <br/>
didn&#39;t take) when my date was too drunk to drive home. It&#39;s amazing what you <br/>
can learn when you really WANT to ! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

&lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I think every kid should learn how to drive a stick. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Me too.  We learned in a brand-new, little automatic.  Then we all went out <br/>
to drive pickups, and standard-transmission station-wagons, or at best, <br/>
automatic transmission BOATS (my mom had an old Buick Electra). <br/>
<br/>
NOBODY in my driver&#39;s ed class went home to a new little automatic.<br/>
<br/>
Had they taught us in a full-sized car with a standard transmission, ANY of <br/>
us could have gone out and driven a little automatic.<br/>
<br/>
So Kirby will get to practice in the mini-van AND on the antiquated Jetta <br/>
with the five-speed transmission.   Though neither will prepare him to drive <br/>
that old Dodge pickup that&#39;s out back, but I tried once and nothing had <br/>
prepared ME.  I say &quot;Just say no&quot; to old Dodge pickups with chokes.<br/>

Same in New Mexico.  Long ago (the 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s) you could get a learner&#39;s <br/>
permit with driver&#39;s ed at 14, or without driver&#39;s ed at 15.   Driver&#39;s ed <br/>
just backed everything up.  But honors&#39; students got a bonus three months <br/>
&quot;back.&quot;  So with drivers&#39; ed early enough (which I didn&#39;t have, since I <br/>
waited for summer) and good grades, I could have been &quot;real&quot; at 14 and 9 <br/>
months.  EEEK!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To be fair, though, it was not so uncommon in those days for people to have <br/>
moms who didn&#39;t drive at all.  And sometimes a family really NEEDED another <br/>
driver.  I think there are still farm exemptions, where a teenager living on <br/>
a farm can get an earlier license to do farm-related business.<br/>
