 </span></blockquote>This had been an ongoing balancing act for us, between<br/>
good nutrition, the kids&#39; freedom of choice with their<br/>
diet, and restricting dangerous allergens.  We HAVE<br/>
had to ban foods because of life threatening<br/>
allergies.  We have not banned them from the house,<br/>
but only from that child&#39;s diet.  How can we tell our<br/>
non-allergic child that he is not allowed to eat<br/>
anything with eggs, milk, cheese, or nuts in it?  <br/>
<br/>
Thankfully, we have been introducing small amounts of<br/>
foods with a little dairy or egg in them, and Thomas<br/>
has been tolerating them alright, so perhaps these<br/>
allergies will ease up even more for him as he grows. <br/>
But his reaction to eggs and dairy products has been<br/>
very violent in the past: projectile vomiting, mucus<br/>
clogging eyes, ears, nose and throat dangerously,<br/>
swelling, rashes, hospital intervention, etc.  He has<br/>
had that reaction to pancakes two years ago, but just<br/>
recently we tried them again (with less egg) and he<br/>
was able to eat them fine, if sparingly.  <br/>
<br/>
Nuts are non-negotiable, as we were VERY lucky to<br/>
discover it the way we did without losing him.  We<br/>
don&#39;t try them on him.  We don&#39;t even let him eat<br/>
things that say &quot;May contain traces of nuts.&quot;  When he<br/>
is a little older, I would like to have a doctor test<br/>
him, in a controlled setting, to verify the type and<br/>
degree of his nut allergies and perhaps free up some<br/>
of his diet that way.<br/>
<br/>
It has been our experience that he refuses foods that<br/>
do not &quot;taste right&quot; to him.  He can detect even trace<br/>
amounts of his allergens and knows which ones he<br/>
cannot tolerate.  Even if that allergen is disguised<br/>
in a cookie or other treat, he will take a small bite<br/>
and either spit it out, or refuse more.  I am the same<br/>
way with foods that contain my allergens, mushrooms,<br/>
avacados, and bananas.  We read labels on everything<br/>
or refuse homemade items we are not sure of,<br/>
particularly when it comes to nuts.  He brings us<br/>
foods and asks if they are alright for him to eat now,<br/>
but when he was younger I had to follow him around and<br/>
watch what he put in his mouth.  I am helping him to<br/>
learn to recognize the words nuts, eggs, milk, etc. on<br/>
labels.  We are stressing to him the importance, (when<br/>
eating food that does not come in a labeled package<br/>
and we did not cook ourselves,) of always asking, AND<br/>
GETTING ANSWERS, about what is in foods from the COOK,<br/>
 NOT the server, whether we are in a resturaunt or<br/>
someone&#39;s home, or at a picnic, or a store.<br/>
<br/>
We take antihistamines with us when we go out, and an<br/>
epi-pen (epinephrine punch type hypo) for emergencies.<br/>
 We watch our son closely with any food that has<br/>
amounts of his allergens in it, he knows to tell us<br/>
the moment he feels any sort of reaction beginning. <br/>
We avoid restaurant food with a lot of mysterious<br/>
ingredients, or asian food (where they often cook with<br/>
sesame and peanut and other oils).<br/>
<br/>
But then we run into a grey area.  There are foods<br/>
that tax his immune system, making him unable to<br/>
handle others that he normally can.  There are those<br/>
that cause him excess mucus production and aggravate<br/>
his asthma.  There are those that make him hyper or<br/>
over sensative, prone to meltdowns.  Our pattern has<br/>
been set by the foods that we HAD to limit for safety<br/>
sake, but now, as he gets older, we have to break that<br/>
pattern to allow him to learn his own balance in his<br/>
diet, while still helping him to recognize and<br/>
understand how his body reacts to certain substances. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have to say no sometimes.  We try not to do it<br/>
excessively.  We ask him what he thinks about it, or<br/>
to try a small taste of something (as long as it is no<br/>
nuts) and see how it feels to him.  It&#39;s hard to have<br/>
to give him more freedom every day on this issue, as<br/>
he grows, but I know we need to.  His allergies are<br/>
dangerous and that is scary, but I suppose it is good<br/>
practice for me in letting go, when I can.<br/>
