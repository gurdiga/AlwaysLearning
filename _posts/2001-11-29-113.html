&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Schools got really excited about the idea of going from &quot;grades&quot; to <br/>
&gt; indicators (and called them different things).  But when an A,B,C,D,F <br/>
&gt; system is<br/>
&gt; &gt; changed to VG, G, NI, U, it doesn&#39;t take kids half a second to figure out <br/>
&gt; what&#39;s what.   <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; I went to a university which didn&#39;t have a grade option at first. <br/>
&gt; The profs were supposed to write a narrative evaluation of<br/>
&gt; each student for the quarter.  What it ended up as was something like this :<br/>
&gt; &quot;Cindy scored above average on the midterm, excellent on the final.  She<br/>
&gt; turned in an excellent report on ...&quot;<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I went to a college that had no grades (written evaluations), no required <br/>
courses, no credits, usually no traditional &quot;tests.&quot;  We had to write <br/>
learning proposals and get an teacher to agree, then you fulfilled your <br/>
contract (with changes expected).  The neat thing about this was that I&#39;ve <br/>
used those proposal-writing skills over and over, including when dealing with <br/>
the school superintendent. <br/>
<br/>
The &quot;problem&quot; with going to my college (Hampshire College in Amherst, MA) was <br/>
that it ruined me for more traditional learning--both for myself (not wanting <br/>
any traditional grad school programs) and my child.<br/>
