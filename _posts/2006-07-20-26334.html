<br/>
Paper Moon<br/>
Annie<br/>
The Grapes of Wrath<br/>
<br/>
For a very interesting perspective though, maybe watch movies made  <br/>
during the Depression!  Top Hat&#39;s a good one.  Lots of them deal with  <br/>
the fantasies of having money, nice clothes, traveling, staying in  <br/>
posh hotels and eating in restaurants...<br/>
<br/>
Annie&#39;s another fantasy of the era.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I have purchased, but am afraid to watch yet, a documentary called  <br/>
Riding the Rails.  It&#39;s about hobos, and says there were &quot;250,000  <br/>
teenagers who left their homes and hopped freight trains.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
My dad left west Texas at 15, on a motorcycle, went to San Francisco  <br/>
to work in the shipyards, and joined the army with parental  <br/>
permission at 16, I think (could be wrong).  He was on a troop ship  <br/>
on the way to Germany when the war ended in Europe.  I don&#39;t think he  <br/>
ever rode a train, but on my mother&#39;s side, one of her uncles died  <br/>
jumping off a train in the early 30&#39;s (I think).  He broke his neck.   <br/>
They used to say he was probably pushed.  So the whole thing creeps  <br/>
me out, but Holly LOVES that period.<br/>
<br/>
I could sing them some tearjerker ballads.  &quot;The Little Paper Boy,&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;Put my Little Shoes Away,&quot; but I&#39;m not sure I could get through  <br/>
them without crying.  That second one I learned from my mom and I  <br/>
always hear it in her voice.<br/>
<br/>
SAD, sad, sad times. And on top of the financial disasters and the  <br/>
dust bowl, there were contagious fevers everywhere, and farm  <br/>
injuries, and...    And lots of people who lived then are still  <br/>
alive.  Keith&#39;s dad turns 90 at the end of this month, the same month  <br/>
Keith turns 50 and Kirby turns 20.  They span a century pretty well,  <br/>
with a pre-Depression birth, a mid-century and a 1986.<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-14481732">I checked netflix and they have 3 versions of this movie listed & NONE of them are listed as having subtitles or closed captions... do you know one way or another if any of them have them? (the listing for Red Fern 2 says &quot;subtitles none&quot; and not a word about captions)...<br/>
<br/>
Any info on this would be appreciated!<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of wonderful movies, last night we watched Fly Away Home... loved it.. wasn&#39;t about the depression, but was about a girl who raised some geese & well, I won&#39;t spill any more beans other than to say that it was about following something that&#39;s important & about a parent who supported that...<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
