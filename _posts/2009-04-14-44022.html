<div id="ygrps-yiv-1453764950">Here&#39;s a candid sample of Holly Dodd&#39;s writing.  She&#39;s 17 and although  <br/>
she never has had any writing classed, she like words.  She didn&#39;t  <br/>
read until she was eleven years old, though she was writing before  <br/>
then by asking people how to spell words.<br/>
<br/>
Stems is a flower shop a block from here.  Zumiez is a store in the  <br/>
mall aimed at skateboarders and snowboarders.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
TIME<br/>
So on Mondays from 1 to 6 I work at Stems.<br/>
<br/>
Monday has become a total week-marker for me, even though I&#39;ve been  <br/>
hardcorely mixing every other day up, it really clears things out week- <br/>
to-week wise. Well realizing it&#39;d been two weeks since the first night  <br/>
I hung around with Mike and Lyndsey, I also realized how much shorter  <br/>
it was from the 30th to the 6th as opposed to the 6th to today. I&#39;ve  <br/>
been trying to put my finger on just what makes different weeks or  <br/>
months seem long and exhausting or short and exhausting.<br/>
Not to say that I&#39;ve been totally exhausted, but a lot has been going  <br/>
on.<br/>
<br/>
So I think after the 30th of March I was doing something everyday.  <br/>
Zumiez, Stems, or something very stimulating, but away from home. This  <br/>
last week, though, I feel like I would have a big day and then a down  <br/>
day. Or a busy morning and then a relaxed afternoon. Or even sleep  <br/>
late and wake up to an exciting day.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>
<br/>
That was posted in an on online place few people read.  It&#39;s mostly  <br/>
for her own thinking.<br/>
<br/>
If she were to ask for help editing it, I think I would suggest a  <br/>
clean-up of the first long sentence starting with &quot;Monday...&quot; and  <br/>
point out that in &quot;I was doing something every day&quot; it should be two  <br/>
words that way because it&#39;s telling when, not what-kind-of (adverb and  <br/>
not adjective).   She would probably have caught it if she were  <br/>
reading someone else&#39;s writing.   Few adults even understand that  <br/>
anymore, but Holly usually sees it.    And a dash between &quot;every day&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;Zumiez&quot; would be better than a period.<br/>
<br/>
By &quot;down day&quot; she doesn&#39;t mean depressed or sad; she means a day  <br/>
without requirements or schedules.<br/>
<br/>
My favorite part is this:<br/>
-=- I&#39;ve been trying to put my finger on just what makes different  <br/>
weeks or months seem long and exhausting or short and exhausting.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Holly&#39;s interested in dreams and memory.  She&#39;s interested in  <br/>
perception.   All of that is about brain function and biochemistry.   <br/>
How do people know what they know?  How do people process and retrieve  <br/>
thoughts?<br/>
<br/>
Some people would say &quot;then she needs to study psychology.&quot;   And in  <br/>
the sense of going to a university and getting a psychology degree,  <br/>
she might.  She might do that someday.  But she&#39;s trying to put her  <br/>
finger on some of it now.  She&#39;s been thinking and observing and  <br/>
asking questions about these things already for years, and probably  <br/>
will keep doing that because she&#39;s curious and interested.   Some of  <br/>
those people who plan to study psychology just put it all out of their  <br/>
minds and wait for the professors they&#39;ve paid to teach them to put  <br/>
some facts into their willing and open blank slate minds.  Holly is  <br/>
building on what she already perceives.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some samples for those who wonder what I&#39;m talking about with  <br/>
the difference between every day and everyday:<br/>
<br/>
Some days I think she might go to college someday.<br/>
I think everyday thoughts every day.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And the purpose of this post, past showing a sample of Holly&#39;s  <br/>
writing, and to show you how I unschool (for those who want &quot;but how?&quot;  <br/>
and &quot;like what?&quot;).  Being able to see several aspects of something is  <br/>
part of what has made unschooling work well for me.   Holly wrote that  <br/>
to express herself and her thoughts to a very few people.   Writing it  <br/>
helped to clarify her own thoughts, and she&#39;s made a record for  <br/>
herself of what she was doing which she can refer back to in years to  <br/>
come (when she started hanging out with those two friends, who are  <br/>
students at La Cueva High--friends of another friend of hers, and she  <br/>
bought a skateboard from Mike).    It shows the mechanics of her  <br/>
writing, which are in the range of most adults who are willing to  <br/>
write in public.   So she&#39;s not &quot;behind&quot; there.  It&#39;s a glimpse into  <br/>
her thoughts on perception (perceiving the passage of time).<br/>
<br/>
This is how I can know whether she&#39;s learning without giving her a test.<br/>
This is how I can compare her progress to other people her age.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>What I find most interesting about Chamille, I would never find in her<br/>
writing.  It&#39;s through discussion mostly.  Her greatest skill, in my<br/>
opinion, is her knowledge of how people work.  She&#39;s really good at<br/>
knowing people, knowing what makes each individual tick, and the<br/>
possible reason for why they do the things they do.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s deeply analytical about it, but doesn&#39;t draw attention to it, I<br/>
think largely because she doesn&#39;t realize that what she does is<br/>
exceptional.  Her friends are starting to see it.  I&#39;ve seen it for<br/>
years.  Her newly acquired boyfriend sees it, or at least senses that<br/>
she&#39;s waaaay smarter than she ever lets anyone see.  He told me so, he<br/>
told me that Chamille is really smart, way smarter than he initially<br/>
knew, and he likes that she&#39;s smart and pretty!</div>

<br/>
Holly and Kirby were always that way.<br/>
<br/>
Marty is observant and analytical about people too, but less (thinking  <br/>
of a word...) it&#39;s less central to his thinking.  He&#39;s more physical  <br/>
and mechanical than the other two.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby and Holly see wide and deep on human interactions and personal  <br/>
motivations.   Each of them expressed surprise and disappointment upon  <br/>
discovery that not everyone has those abilities.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-432367198">I loved this:<br/>
 &quot;I&#39;ve been trying to put my finger on just what makes different<br/>
weeks or months seem long and exhausting or short and exhausting.&quot;  (Then i<br/>
read that it was your fav part too :-)<br/>
<br/>
So exciting and yet if at that age I&#39;d mentioned this to someone at<br/>
home...they&#39;d have asked me to look at the calendar, calculate how many<br/>
days/hours etc... Feeling things and thinking about them are different to<br/>
me.<br/>
<br/>
I did writing as a form of free flow for about 7 months (everyday) a long<br/>
time ago... and loved the shape of words and how things sounded when read.<br/>
<br/>
My grammar is not upto speed... so it was nice to read your little<br/>
pointers.  I really enjoy this book:  &quot;writing down the bones&quot; by Natalie<br/>
Goldberg.  She is a writer writing about writing. But it connects to<br/>
learning and art and everything in between for me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1723207230">Holly (18) has re-done her MySpace page, and here are her interests:<br/>
<br/>
General<br/>
<br/>
Psychology- memory and dreams<br/>
Movies- lighting, writing, sets and props<br/>
Clothing- fashion, history, costumes and style<br/>
Food- health, tradition, appetite<br/>
People- interpersonal and intrapersonal<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not prose writing, but it reads almost poetically.<br/>
