I&#39;ll definitely check your site rec&#39;s and read and try to change what &quot;i&#39;m&quot; doing....i think when the unkindness happens that being tired and/or hungry is usually the cause and sometimes its just testing like behaviour but I&#39;m gonna try to observe more and see if thats really it......it all just takes so much thinking and I guess sometimes i get lazy.........it really takes a lot of work ( for me)to be this kind of parent but its the right thing to do and no one is making me..... I often say I &quot;have a delicate sanity&quot; and what that really means is I get tired .......but it seems the long haulers don&#39;t really talk about getting tired or lazy or having a hard time and i guess maybe I&#39;m doing something wrong b/c its not supposed to be so hard? so, I&#39;m adding more thinking! to try and make it easier.....or just let it be easier.........:)so, thank you.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>=======================<br/>
<br/>
What some people describe as kids &quot;testing&quot; parents (and isn&#39;t that  <br/>
always presented in a negative manner, as though the kids are sneaky,  <br/>
manipulative and bad?) can be seen as them simply communicating and  <br/>
attempting to learn.<br/>
<br/>
Try to put a positive spin on how you see situations with your  <br/>
children, and how you phrase things.<br/>
<br/>
Words and ideas change thought and behavior.  It&#39;s not (as people  <br/>
like to say when they don&#39;t want to really think about it) &quot;just  <br/>
semantics.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=-I often say I &quot;have a delicate sanity&quot; and what that really means  <br/>
is I get tired-=-<br/>
<br/>
You often say that?<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Tired&quot; sometimes means feeling powerless or overwhelmed.   Every  <br/>
step you take toward seeing that your life is made of conscious  <br/>
choices will energize you, I think.  When people feel helpless and  <br/>
put-upon, that can feel like tiredness.     Bolster up your sanity  <br/>
with knowledge of how learning works and how you can help yourself  <br/>
and your kids learn, and how you can maintain the kind of peaceful  <br/>
yet busy environment that makes for good unschooling.  Have a focus.   <br/>
People without priorities can sometimes feel that they&#39;re wallowing  <br/>
and flailing in confusion.<br/>
<br/>
Focus doesn&#39;t mean you need to have a big plan and schedule.  That&#39;s  <br/>
how priorities and principles work.  If your priority is the cleanest  <br/>
possible house, then that will cause you to make decisions based on  <br/>
what will get your house clean and keep it that way.    If you  <br/>
priority is three sit-down meals every single day with your whole  <br/>
family present, then THAT is how you will decide whether it&#39;s okay  <br/>
for your children to sleep in or stay at a friend&#39;s house longer.   <br/>
The answer would be no, because it would conflict with your first  <br/>
priority.<br/>
<br/>
My priority has long been to help my kids discover the world in fun  <br/>
and safe ways.  So if they want to stay up really late playing online  <br/>
games with people on other continents, that seems (within my  <br/>
priorities) vastly superior to a sit-down breakfast just because it&#39;s  <br/>
7:30 a.m.  They can sleep.  I&#39;ll make sure they&#39;re not hungry.   <br/>
There&#39;s food available that they can get easily on their own, and I&#39;m  <br/>
willing to cook for them if they&#39;d rather have pancakes or scrambled  <br/>
eggs or something.  That&#39;s not a schedule, and it doesn&#39;t take a lot  <br/>
of thinking.  Each decision is made based on the principles and  <br/>
priorities that support unschooling at our house.<br/>
<br/>
If clean house were my one main focus, it would be better for me and  <br/>
my house for the kids to have gone to school so I could clean up, and  <br/>
they wouldn&#39;t have or need so much stuff at home, because their  <br/>
learning would be relegated to schooltime and school&#39;s buildings.   <br/>
Why would our house need maps and globes?  That wouldn&#39;t be my job,  <br/>
or the purpose of our house.<br/>
<br/>
-=-it seems the long haulers don&#39;t really talk about getting tired or  <br/>
lazy or having a hard time -=-<br/>
<br/>
It was harder when I was newer at it, and when my kids were all  <br/>
little there were days I hardly got to think of anything that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
the in-my-face sticky or poopy mess of the moment.  Talking about how  <br/>
hard it is doesn&#39;t help much, but talking about how it can be easier  <br/>
does.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-618193322">-=-I often say I &quot;have a delicate sanity&quot; and what that really means<br/>
is I get tired-=-<br/>
<br/>
My husband has a VERY different tolerance level, energy level and coping<br/>
level to many things in life than I do. He would say, with great relief to<br/>
have the words and confidence to say, &quot;I have delicate sanity.&quot; In fact, I&#39;m<br/>
going to share the term with him...I think he&#39;ll feel like it fits in lots<br/>
of situations for him.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard him say, &quot;I&#39;ve reached my max&quot; more times than I can count. And<br/>
it&#39;s the truth that he reached his max. He gets physically ill if pushed<br/>
beyond his max...you can see his eyes glaze and become bloodshot, he<br/>
disintegrates emotionally and has difficulty thinking rationally, can&#39;t<br/>
handle little issues. His body can even begin to quiver. It&#39;s a very typical<br/>
aspie thing.<br/>
<br/>
We Xmas shop together every year. We set it up so that we have fun and it<br/>
works for both of us. We figured out Charles&#39; tolerance time...about 1 1/2<br/>
hours. His delicate, finely-tuned &quot;sanity&quot; or &quot;togetherness&quot; starts to<br/>
crumble about then in public on the go. And this has built up over the<br/>
years...it used to be less than an hour.<br/>
<br/>
So we go in spurts and have great, short shopping excursions. I get most of<br/>
the shopping done by myself as I seem to have few limits this way. I tend to<br/>
be the energizer bunny.<br/>
<br/>
When he&#39;s &quot;reached his max&quot;, we&#39;ll go home so he can rest up and have no<br/>
expectations from anyone for a couple of hours and then be ready to go<br/>
again. Learning that he is not really insane, that he is like a lot of other<br/>
people who apparently lived in closets while he was growing up, having an<br/>
internet and books that have given him SO much insight into his own<br/>
mysteries, has allowed him to let go of shame and helped him organize a life<br/>
that works for him.<br/>
<br/>
KNOWING this about Charles has made our marriage work and his life a happy<br/>
one, rather than a &quot;there&#39;s something wrong with me&quot; one.<br/>
<br/>
Our first 8 years of marriage or so I didn&#39;t REALLY believe dh had these<br/>
limits. I believed he had control of these things and was choosing to see<br/>
himself in these ways, and could change the little breakdowns he had when<br/>
pushed beyond his max, maybe he acted like this because of his upbringing or<br/>
whatever. I was VERY frustrated many times because he just couldn&#39;t keep up<br/>
in a lot of ways. Having a shift in understanding, gaining information about<br/>
WHY Charles was the way he was (it just seems easier to figure out with our<br/>
children...it was definitely harder for me to be understanding of my grown<br/>
adult husband).<br/>
<br/>
And my husband is an incredible man. He is an amazing person on this planet.<br/>
I am in awe of him in many ways.<br/>
<br/>
So basically I just wanted to say that maybe you aren&#39;t limiting yourself by<br/>
using the term &quot;delicate sanity&quot;. Maybe these are words that describe to<br/>
some degree how you feel. Maybe you&#39;ve learned that compared to most people,<br/>
you have a lower tolerance to some things, and you *feel* tired after those<br/>
kinds of stimulants.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

someone else?  Or shop online instead?<br/>

That sounds typical of an extrovert and an introvert.  We have three  <br/>
extroverts here, who are energized by people and activity, and two  <br/>
introverts, who are energized by solitude.  There&#39;s nothing wrong  <br/>
with any of us.  Everyone is somewhere along the line between those  <br/>
theoretical extremes, and some fluctuate, needing solitude some  <br/>
seasons of their lives, and fearing it other times.  Knowing that  <br/>
both are healthy and &#39;normal&#39; (not mathematically normal, but not  <br/>
&quot;abnormal&quot;) is all people need to know (and not to pressure one to  <br/>
comfortably behave differently for very long).<br/>

them happy and what bothers them, that then they will feel comfortable with<br/>
behaving &quot;differently&quot; for very long. But the part of the sentence right<br/>
before the parentheses says &quot;Knowing that both are healthy and &#39;normal&#39; (not<br/>
mathematically normal, but not<br/>
&quot;abnormal&quot;) is all people need to know&quot;. So if our differences are normal<br/>
and fine, then why would we not want to have them for very long? Just a<br/>
little confused.<br/>
<br/>
You may be saying that if we use a label then we will lower our expectations<br/>
of ourselves or the other person we&#39;re using the label on. That is a<br/>
personal decision people make individually. I really can&#39;t control what<br/>
other people think of my son or husband. If they have preconceived notions<br/>
or false opinions that really is their problem. I&#39;ve watched both of these<br/>
amazing people just keep growing and learning and changing...no limits. My<br/>
husband has a blue belt in karate after starting at age 54. He STARTED med<br/>
school at age 41. He just keeps on going...often at a different pace than<br/>
me, but utilizing a label has done nothing to slow him down.<br/>

Keith will go to a party with me if I really want him to.  What I do  <br/>

four or five hours even though I might.  I watch for signs that he&#39;s  <br/>
uncomfortable and we bail.  I don&#39;t pressure him to do an  <br/>
uncomfortable thing.   If he seems uncomfortable about the idea of  <br/>
going in the first place, if it&#39;s something he can miss without  <br/>
social repercussions, I just go without him.  He doesn&#39;t like things  <br/>
in churches (weddings and funerals) but I like them fine, so I go.    <br/>

I&#39;ve heard him say, &quot;I&#39;ve reached my max&quot; more times than I can count. And<br/>
it&#39;s the truth that he reached his max. He gets physically ill if pushed<br/>
beyond his max...you can see his eyes glaze and become bloodshot, he<br/>
disintegrates emotionally and has difficulty thinking rationally, can&#39;t<br/>
handle little issues. His body can even begin to quiver. It&#39;s a very typical<br/>
aspie thing. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been following this thread, and I don&#39;t have any insights at all, but I<br/>
did have a reaction here.<br/>
<br/>
I was reading these two paragraphs and thinking how like me it was to be<br/>
reaching the maximum. It is often tiredness in my case, and I will say, &quot;I<br/>
haven&#39;t got much left in me&quot; as a lead up to making a transition to bed or<br/>
other activity with Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
Then I got to the last sentence: &quot;It&#39;s a very typical<br/>
aspie thing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And suddenly a big silent wall went up bang between me and the experience<br/>
you dh has and it seemed like I couldn&#39;t relate at all, that it wasn&#39;t<br/>
something in common with me at all. Suddenly it was all about being aspie<br/>
instead of about being at the end of the tether - however long that tether<br/>
may be for different people.<br/>

down, get moving on, get ready to go home, whatever.<br/>

at Disneyland - while standing in lines &lt;G&gt; - but I am massively  <br/>
overwhelmed by being indoors with the wall of sound that is always  <br/>
there in a mall and with artificial lighting and STUFF everywhere. It  <br/>
turns me into a zombie.  There is an element of claustrophobia in it,  <br/>
too. It is simply part of who I am and my family knows it and knows  <br/>
how much they can expect from me.<br/>

......it all just takes so much <br/>
thinking and I guess sometimes i get lazy.........it really takes a lot of work <br/>
( for me)to be this kind of parent but its the right thing to do and no one is <br/>
making me.....<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
It DOES take a lot of work. And it&#39;s NOT easy. <br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 .......but it seems the long haulers don&#39;t really talk about <br/>
getting tired or lazy or having a hard time and i guess maybe I&#39;m doing <br/>
something wrong b/c its not supposed to be so hard?<br/>
 <br/>
-=-=-=-<br/>
 <br/>
We&#39;ve been gently criticized for this before (we&#39;ve even criticized ourselves!) because we *seem* to always <br/>
get it right. ANd we make it seem easy. It&#39;s not. I work every day at it. It didn&#39;t come naturally. I often <br/>
ask for forgiveness from Ben and the boys when I lose it. But I get better. <br/>
 <br/>
I came with some serious baggage. Cameron will have less than I did---and Duncan will have next to none! &lt;g&gt;<br/>
I still have my mother&#39;s voice that rings in my ears. Duncan says he hates to see me shake (I grit my teeth <br/>
and do the Tom Hanks baseball shake when I&#39;m really angry---it keeps me from yelling and reminds me to <br/>
breathe! &lt;bwg&gt;).<br/>
 <br/>
Do we lose it? Yes! And we should probably tell you all more often when we do lose it. Because it helps to <br/>
know that we&#39;re not perfect moms. The same way it helps your children to see that you struggle with new <br/>
things too! But when newbies come and ask for help with things, we give advice---and that advice will be <br/>
to calmly think about what you&#39;re doing, to see your child as a young person who is learning how to live in <br/>
this world and who wants to do/be his best, and to respond as you would like to have been treated. <br/>
 <br/>
Yes, we should probably tell more about how we struggled to get to this point (where ever we are on the <br/>
continuum)---but we tend to say what we&#39;ve found works best for us.<br/>
 <br/>
Do we get tired? Yes---that&#39;s when you don&#39;t see me here much!<br/>
 <br/>
Do we get lazy? Uh---no! Not me! &lt;G&gt; I&#39;m an energizer bunny! &lt;bgw&gt;<br/>
 <br/>
Do we have a hard time? It gets easier and easier the more you do it and the more you think about WHY. <br/>
Seriously---the more you do *anything* the easier that thing gets. Keep making better, more unschooly <br/>
decisions and you will naturally become better at it. It will become easier.<br/>
 <br/>
That saying: if it were easy, everyone would be doing it? <br/>
 <br/>
Unschooling ain&#39;t easy. Simple, but not easy! And we&#39;re the few, the proud, the unschoolers! &lt;G&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I lose it very rarely anymore.  Years back I was more likely to.<br/>
<br/>
Now others in the family are more likely to smile if I&#39;m having a  <br/>
melt-down than to cringe.  There&#39;s nothing to cringe about.  Kirby  <br/>
thinks I should have more self control and so he expresses disgust  <br/>
(facially, and he leaves the room) if I&#39;m frustrated or angry.<br/>
<br/>
That Kirby who thinks I should be able to control my emotions better  <br/>
was a little kid who was quick to fury, broke things, lunged at his  <br/>
brother, threw himself down crying...  but we never said &quot;That&#39;s  <br/>
okay, Kirby.&quot;  We figured out how we could try to avoid the  <br/>
situations he was in and we would get people and things out of his  <br/>
range and hold him or sit across from him and help him express  <br/>
himself and to breathe, the combination of which are a quicky home- <br/>
version of drugs and therapy.  Oxygen and the opportunity to express  <br/>
the rage and the practice and assistance to put it into better words  <br/>
and context moved him QUICKLY to a place I will probably never be,  <br/>
because while I had years of no help, years of reinforcement for bad  <br/>
behavior.<br/>
<br/>
When I was little if an adult was having a tantrum, it was assumed  <br/>
that it was WHOLLY justified and probably the &quot;fault&quot; of me or  <br/>
another kid.  It was assumed to be okay that when that adult did calm  <br/>
down (or maybe just a while before), a kid could get a spanking, or  <br/>
some big punishment.  And we wouldn&#39;t have laughed or smiled or said  <br/>
&quot;Sheesh, mom--breathe!!&quot;   Because then we&#39;d&#39;ve been slapped.  So we  <br/>
were somewhat trained to accept those fits as normal and right and  <br/>
good and our fault.   Many years of that went by in my life, and when  <br/>
I was in my 20&#39;s, I had few good tricks for self-calming (though I  <br/>
had more than some of my friends, because I had been meditating since  <br/>
I was fifteen, and though it wasn&#39;t regular or daily, I had the tool  <br/>
and I knew how to induce that state more quickly than if I&#39;d never  <br/>
been there.<br/>
<br/>
So that&#39;s a long ramble to get to this point:<br/>
If this list turns into a &quot;support group&quot; for moms who lose it, we  <br/>
will enable people to continue to lose it and feel justified.<br/>
<br/>
When one feels about to lose it, that&#39;s a good time to look around  <br/>
and see what she should have or could have done differently in the  <br/>
hour or day before that.  Is it time to go and you&#39;re not ready?   <br/>
That is not the fault of your husband or children.  Suck it up.     <br/>
Did you forget to do something you said you&#39;d do and now you&#39;re  <br/>
embarrassed and frustrated?  That&#39;s not anyone else&#39;s fault.   <br/>
Apologize sweetly and make a quick Plan B.  Get a packet of phrases  <br/>
(affirmations, tricks) and learn to change your posture and to take a  <br/>
few breaths in whatever way calms you.  I do slow, deep and hold, and  <br/>
let it out slowly, and then huff out the last bit, and start a new  <br/>
slow deep one, and after years of that being my best trick, I can  <br/>
usually calm down in less than two breaths now, though there was a  <br/>
time it took several, or a fast walk.<br/>
<br/>
Fast walk is a good trick.  If you think you&#39;re about to cry or roar,  <br/>
do a real thing.  Take the compost out, or the trash.  Go and refill  <br/>
the bird feeder.  Check the mail box.  Then if you need to cry you&#39;re  <br/>
away from little kids who might be freaked out and feel responsible.<br/>
<br/>
Parent yourself when you&#39;re feeling like you&#39;re losing it.<br/>
<br/>
It probably helps new unschoolers to know we&#39;re not perfect moms, but  <br/>
it won&#39;t help them if we say &quot;Ah, don&#39;t worry about it.  Everyone  <br/>
loses it.  It&#39;s normal.  Don&#39;t feel bad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, feel bad.   Yes, desire to do better.   Yes, learn to manage  <br/>
life so that the frustrations are avoided and aren&#39;t so harmful when  <br/>
they can&#39;t be avoided.  Maybe  you can&#39;t jump there all in one great  <br/>
stride, but if that&#39;s where you want to go, every choice you make can  <br/>
be made with that destination in mind.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2076444107">It&#39;s funny you posted that. i was talking to my husband just last night about how much <br/>
more exhausted I am (well, I&#39;ve been tired for months and months, from pregnancy <br/>
sicknesses), but now that we&#39;re getting back to our regularly scheduled programming, i <br/>
am so much more exhausted than ever before. BUT...I know why, it takes more energy to <br/>
unschool that to homeschool (although tbh, both are easier than dealing with public <br/>
schools)<br/>
<br/>
Having said all of that, it&#39;s a better sort of tired. Kind of like being sweaty because you&#39;re <br/>
nervous vs being sweaty because you&#39;ve been working in the garden. I feel like we&#39;re <br/>
happier and more accomplished, and I&#39;m having a good time. I love it!  Now if you&#39;ll <br/>
excuse me we have to figure out how to affix two broken pieces of soap back together (we <br/>
spent last week melting down soap blocks and molding our own soaps. LOL! It&#39;s all good, <br/>

For me, it &quot;takes a lot of energy&quot; to sit still doing nothing.  A  <br/>

to take his book in case there was sitting-around time.  He said no,  <br/>
he&#39;d just sit around.<br/>
<br/>
I can&#39;t just sit around.  It makes lots of noise inside me, lots of  <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I see what you are saying, Sandra.  I find unschooling takes much less mental energy from me than sending the kids to school (we&#39;ve done both at the kids&#39; request).  THAT made me nuts even though I had all day to do whatever I wanted.<br/>
<br/>
Unschooling takes more physical energy for me.  Most of the time it does feel like playing because I really enjoy spending time with the kids....sometimes it does feel like work, usually when I&#39;ve made a conscious decision to support a child in their interest, particularly an interest that I&#39;m not really interested in myself.<br/>
<br/>
Zach decided to raise chicken broilers this year for 4-H.  We have laying hens...how hard could it be?  So the chickens arrived Wednesday and today I attended a workshop on how to help your child raise these things.  We are talking feeding 4 times per day and rousting them every 2 hours around the clock.  Sigh....no way can a 12 yo do that independently....But Zach is excited and I want to support him so I&#39;m digging out the extra alarm clock and slapping a smile on my face and trying to think of this as a memory in progress &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>

Jigsaw puzzles are just one of the things you don&#39;t get to do much or so  <br/>
perfectly when there are small children around.  Moms and dads should just  <br/>
realize that.  Like going to the movies or 5-star restaurants or sex on the  couch <br/>
in the middle of the day.<br/>
 <br/>
It&#39;s just something you put off until the kids are older or out of the  house.<br/>

Knee-jerk is easy AND it&#39;s damaging and painful; thoughtful parenting is <br/>
tougher (to begin) AND is healing (to parent) and nurturing (to parent <br/>
and child/ren). <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;Yes, feel bad.   Yes, desire to do better.   Yes, learn to manage  <br/>
&gt;life so that the frustrations are avoided and aren&#39;t so harmful when  <br/>
&gt;they can&#39;t be avoided.  Maybe  you can&#39;t jump there all in one great  <br/>
&gt;stride, but if that&#39;s where you want to go, every choice you make can  <br/>
&gt;be made with that destination in mind.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Guilt serves purpose; one purpose could be the cause of ulcers, another <br/>
(far more productive IMO) is the drive to do better, to make right what <br/>
has been done wrong and not to repeat harmful actions again. <br/>
<br/>
I realize this in my home, almost daily... When Hannah, 9, says she <br/>
doesn&#39;t want to do something she&#39;s committed to doing, she doesn&#39;t want <br/>
to hear about her committment, she just wants someone to acknowledge her <br/>
&quot;no&quot; to let it be heard and respected.  THEN she calms down, processes <br/>
the situation herself and is then absolutely *FREE* to make a choice. <br/>
The other day, she woke up and didn&#39;t want to go to her riding lesson <br/>
[the voices in my head were RAVING about the struggle to schedule this <br/>
lesson and the money it costs and the trouble the teacher went through <br/>
to get to the barn and what will they think of me and what kind of <br/>
parent will they think I am...].  Admittedly, I cajoled her, working to <br/>
rally her enthusiasm to go... I had to go anyway, to pay the teacher, so <br/>
she rode along to see her best friend.  Once there, she helped her <br/>
friend ready the horse, all along quietly reminding me she wasn&#39;t going <br/>
to ride today.  We watched the other girls have their lessons and when <br/>
Hannah&#39;s turn came, she looked at me with tears in her eyes and asked <br/>
that I tell the teacher she wasn&#39;t riding.  The volume button in my head <br/>
was really hard to reach and I almost caved in to those voices, when I <br/>
realized the *ONE* person I needed to listen to right now is Hannah and <br/>
Hannah alone.  I hugged her sad, scared little Self and told Deb she <br/>
didn&#39;t want to ride today.  The confusion on the teacher&#39;s face was <br/>
priceless!  How do you chastise a kid who came in and did the hard part <br/>
of the lesson and doesn&#39;t want to do the fun part??  As she sputtered <br/>
about charging without 24 hour notice, I quickly assured her I had no <br/>
problem paying for the lesson and I was glad to have Hannah&#39;s wishes <br/>
respected.  As soon as we adults were okay with her &quot;no,&quot; she helped her <br/>
friend take off the saddle and lead the horse to the field, where we fed <br/>
him the apples we brought along.  Deb kindly asked Hannah if there was <br/>
something *she* could do to make riding lessons less angstful for her.  <br/>
Hannah told her &quot;it&#39;s just today, I don&#39;t feel like riding today&quot; and <br/>
Deb accepted it.  Hannah&#39;s now looking forward to her next lesson.  I&#39;m <br/>
so glad I didn&#39;t put an anxiety ridden child on the back of a huge <br/>
animal -- so dangerous!!  -- but instead honored her feelings for that <br/>
moment and kept the role of  &quot;mom-as-protector&quot; in her heart. <br/>

make Hannah feel good about her own choices.  <br/>

Thanks, <br/>
