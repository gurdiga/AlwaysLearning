<br/>
Nope definately those pesky little microscopic gnats!!! Easy to swat, not <br/>
quick, just annoying. I always thought they appeared with rotting fruit, like <br/>
bananas when they get brown, but all my fruit is barely ripening. I have emailed <br/>
an entomologist friend to see if there is something I&#39;m missing in the washing <br/>
factor. I just don&#39;t know. But they definately NOT fruit flies!!! Those <br/>
suckers are more than pesky, they are pretty ugly little creatures too. LOL<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1862381949">Ah, you all are talking my language now. A few stories. Tim and I love plants so much we took a few on a couple camping trips before we had our kids. We added them to our favorite hot springs in the desert of California. Aloe and Jades and spider plants. Just in case they could grow. A tomato too. I have a picture of our camp, complete with plants. Once some ants got into my seeds and started taking them to their home. A strange plant grew in that trail. We left it. Turned out to be a sesame seed plant. So pretty. I need to grow that one again. I have always been with plants. I remember trying to grow peanuts when I was little, about 10 years old. Those things put their flowers underground.<br/>
<br/>
As for ungardening, there is a group of folks who like to farm with natures image in mind. Without tilling, with lots of diversity. Feed the bugs too and harvest what is remaining. Trees with crops growing around them. A good friend of mine use to take all the seed she had, mix it all together, then sprinkle it all over her yard. She would tend what grew where. Tomatoes and pansies and lettuce all over the place. Looked like a meadow.<br/>
<br/>
Right now we have a few pumpkin plants, lots of cherry tomatoes, 12 foot high sunflowers, swiss chard and lots of flowers. I have worked in retail nurseries, got my BS in Plant Science and a Master&#39;s in Farming Systems. Worked for years as an organic flower farmer. Thank you all for talking plants. I live in the Sacramento Valley. I love winter gardening here because you can plant, forget you did, let the rain germinate your seeds, then harvest until the heat comes. Summer gardening takes much more work because you have to water.<br/>

Hi, Mary --<br/>
<br/>
I already went berserk and bought a large pile of seeds for a winter <br/>
garden.  But even books specifically about gardening in California have <br/>
surprisingly little info about growing stuff in the cool season.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be at the Sacramento HSC conference both days -- will you be there?<br/>
