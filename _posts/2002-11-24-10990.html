<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; I always wish I could wear a t-shirt that would explain it all.  Then <br/>
&gt; I have to ask myself what am I trying to prove?  Maybe I am the <br/>
&gt; obnoxious white girl who&#39;s trying to prove she&#39;s not racist to <br/>
&gt; herself.  I know I have some racist hangups.  I know this.  I wish I <br/>
&gt; didn&#39;t.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what is the best way?  From people who have biracial families or <br/>
&gt; people who are in same sex relationships.  What is the best way for <br/>
&gt; me to let you know that I think wht you&#39;re doing is great.  And I <br/>
&gt; wish it wasn&#39;t such a big deal and I hope some day we won&#39;t even have <br/>
&gt; to think twice about it?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The thing is...WE ALL have these hangups. It&#39;s not really acceptable or <br/>
common to be blatantly racist (or homophobic or whatever) these days, but we <br/>
have this stuff institutionalized. It makes a difference if we&#39;re aware, <br/>
notice our discomforts, and make a point to &quot;walk our talk.&quot; You KNOW you <br/>
have some racist hangups and wish you didn&#39;t? Wow, that&#39;s WONDERFUL!  You&#39;re <br/>
most of the way there already!<br/>
<br/>
I learned an interesting parenting thing from a good friend of mine about the <br/>
assumptions we make.<br/>
<br/>
This is a straight married woman who was talking about her kids. She <br/>
mentioned she was gently teasing her then 15 year old daughter about a couple <br/>
of kids she had met over a weekend, a boy and a girl. She asked about the <br/>
boy, &quot;So do you LIKE him?&quot; THEN she asked if she LIKED the girl. <br/>
<br/>
I was flabbergasted! ( I just love that word). She had an awareness that her <br/>
daughter just might not be straight, and without even really trying, <br/>
communicated to her that it was okay and natural, in the light teasing way <br/>
that parents do with their kids sometimes. (This kid is one who was fine with <br/>
her mom asking about this kind of thing.) Now, most of our kids are likely to <br/>
be straight. BUT even very enlightened parents often talk to their kids in <br/>
ways that would make it hard for a questioning kid to think it was okay. <br/>
Kathleen gracefully, in a normal situation, did that (and does consistently.) <br/>
 Until she told me that story (and, even more amazingly, it was not to show <br/>
me how enlightenened she was. She was genuinely startled when I complimented <br/>
her on that aspect of it.), it hadn&#39;t occurred to me how much &gt;I&lt; took for <br/>
granted that Julian would probably be straight. I think about the messages I <br/>
give much more now.<br/>
<br/>
Is this as clear as mud? I&#39;m still a little addled.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1271389441">...which reminds me of something that happened with my teenage daughter.<br/>
<br/>
She was having a (male) homeschooling friend from another city over to stay <br/>
for a few days and she was trying to plan out where he was going to <br/>
sleep.  She had intended that he would sleep in her room (she had a queen <br/>
sized bed at the time, but she also has a cat which means her door needs to <br/>
stay closed as we&#39;re allergic.)    I said that I didn&#39;t know the young man <br/>
well enough and that he or they both were welcome to sleep in a more public <br/>
room, but not closed off in her room.  After all, I&#39;d met him for a grand <br/>
total of maybe 20 minutes... give me a break!<br/>
<br/>
She was complaining to a friend over the phone about how &#39;awful&#39; I was <br/>
being and took the opportunity to argue with me again.  She asked, &quot;Well, <br/>
you let &lt;a female friend&gt; sleep with me in my room, why not &lt;the male <br/>
friend&gt;?  I mean, what if &lt;the female friend&gt; is lesbian?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I said with a shrug, &quot;I guess I&#39;m just more comfortable with lesbian love.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Not quite what she expected from her old mum. (grin)  Blew her mind.  She <br/>
chattered about that one to her friends for a few days.  (and yes, she <br/>
knows I have lesbian friends and transgendered acquaintances, but I don&#39;t <br/>
really stress it much and as she&#39;s never had a romantic interest come <br/>
calling there&#39;s been little call for it.)<br/>
<br/>
That one made it into my mental &#39;parenting moments&#39; book.<br/>

&quot;does it&quot; with her friend Tanya, she can&#39;t get pregnant. LOL<br/>

Brain.  Sex-a-holics.  Nymphos.  This makes three or four of you who came <br/>
up with that! ...and you&#39;re absolutely spot on!<br/>
Hmmm, must be a room full of Unschoolers in here....<br/>
