&gt;I&#39;ve gotten so tired of all that down here in the Bible Belt! When anyone <br/>
&gt;asks, I just tell them that my children are autodidacts and leave it it that.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Most people I say that to don&#39;t know what autodidact means and are too <br/>
afraid to ask.  My 8 yo uses that to describe himself, too.  He&#39;s really <br/>
surprised when I tell him which other people are autodidacts, too.  I <br/>
guess he thought he was the only one?  lol.<br/>
<br/>
Jon needed a real diploma*, so I made him one.  I was using an example I <br/>
saw on Ann Zeise&#39;s site, and so I needed a name for the &quot;school&quot;.  It&#39;s <br/>
&quot;Autodidact Asylum&quot; in a huge olde English swirly font.  We figure that <br/>
anyone who&#39;s going to ask him for the diploma is not going to be smart <br/>
enough or brave enough to ask about it...and Jon is adept at diverting <br/>
*those* kinds of questions, anyway.  <br/>
<br/>
Oh well, *I* thought it was clever.  lol.<br/>
<br/>
*He&#39;s 17 and kind of caught in limbo between two different states&#39; <br/>
regulations since he splits his time between here and his Dad&#39;s....so <br/>
the easiest way to get him out of that in both states was to graduate <br/>
him.  In May school will be out for the summer, so it won&#39;t be as much <br/>
of an issue, but then there are 3 months during the school year before <br/>
he turns 18 in November. I really abhore compulsory attendance.  <br/>

&gt;Where is the best place to get ears pierced?  It sounds like the mall is out.  My older dd said she saw a sign at Wal-Mart for free ear piercings.  My dd said &quot;yea that would be great if you don&#39;t care where the whole is.&quot;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;ve had mine done 3 times. (same hole each time!)  The first two times <br/>
I was about 10 or 14 or something, and it was done at home by a friend&#39;s <br/>
mother.  (And my mother was ticked off because I didn&#39;t get permission!) <br/>
 Ice on the lobe to numb it, and then a fine needle pushed through to <br/>
the potato half held behind.  They closed up both times, mainly because <br/>
I didn&#39;t wear earrings enough.  One or the other would get infected on <br/>
occasion, and a little alcohol on a short piece of broom stick worn for <br/>
a few days would clear it up.<br/>
<br/>
The third time I had it done in the mall when I was 20, and they healed <br/>
up and have been fine ever since.  I&#39;ve gone long periods of time, weeks <br/>
and months, without wearing earrings.  But I can always pop some back <br/>
in.  Perhaps at younger ages we heal so quickly that there&#39;s no stopping <br/>
them closing up.  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s a tradition around here for many African-Americans to pierce their <br/>
babies&#39; ears within the first month or so.  I wouldn&#39;t do it, but to <br/>
each her own.<br/>
<br/>
I think it&#39;s like birthing and raising children, though...it&#39;s become <br/>
regulated and/or &quot;professionalized&quot; &quot;for our own good&quot; by people who <br/>
think they know better.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Hispanic baby girls get pierced ears that early too, here.  I guess so you <br/>
can tell the girls from the boys. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know whether that might make the hole easier to  maintain, that it&#39;s <br/>
&quot;always&quot; been there.  <br/>
<br/>
None of my kids have wanted tattoos.  That would be a hard one for me, <br/>
because if they grow up to regret it, there it is.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s funny that I don&#39;t feel that way about educational choices! &lt;g&gt;  Tattoos <br/>
are hard to remove, but chemistry classes are all over the place.  They have <br/>
a friend who stays here a lot who&#39;s in high school who has a pierced tongue <br/>
and eyebrow. He has had for at least a year.  They haven&#39;t said &quot;I want what <br/>
ERIC&#39;S got!&quot;  Maybe they really *are* making rational, mature decisions.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>If they want their tongues pierced, you might want to turn over <br/>
responsibility for their dental bills as well.  My daughter knows a lot of <br/>
people with pierced tongues who have cracked and lost fillings and even <br/>
teeth because of the tongue jewellery.<br/>

If my grandfather had had a pierced nose, his nose<br/>
hair would have gotten tangled!!  He also had long<br/>
overhanging eyebrows.  He had the sort of ear-hair<br/>
that might have tangled in earrings, though his<br/>
&quot;head&quot;hair would not have. :)<br/>
