<div id="ygrps-yiv-1387777432">I am trying very hard to stay committed to a non-punitive style of parenting(I have been wishy-washy on this topic-usually b/c there are certain behaviors I have a strong desire to extinguish), but lately I have noticed a bad habit in my older children of name-calling and rudeness towards their siblings when they are upset. Some of the things they say: &quot;idiot,&quot; &quot;shut-up,&quot; and &quot;shut your mouth.&quot; This is not the way they have been spoken to- but I guess they picked it up along the way, and now every time they get upset it flies out of their mouths(they don&#39;t say these things to me, just their brothers). The thing that really upsets me about it is that their little brothers and sisters hear it, and I don&#39;t want them to learn it. Any ideas on how to handle this w/o punishing? It seems like discussing it doesn&#39;t seem to help. Thanks in advance for any tips :). P.S. This doesn&#39;t happen all day long-just here and there. Am I being too critical? DH thinks so.</div>

 </span></blockquote>What&#39;s causing the name calling? That&#39;s where you need to begin.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting focuses on the negative actions as though if  <br/>
you can just make kids act right then they&#39;ll be right. If you manage  <br/>
to stop the name calling without dealing with what led up to it, what  <br/>
will they do when the tensions build and they feel like name calling?  <br/>
Punch each other? Secretly put tacks in each other&#39;s shoes?<br/>
<br/>
Better is to work on the relationships. Work on the tensions and help  <br/>
them find better ways to react before relations break down.<br/>
<br/>
Conventional parenting is about putting out fires. Mindful parenting  <br/>
is about fire prevention so there are fewer fires to put out.<br/>

There are links which will undoubtedly lead to more links. :-)<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d recommend:<br/>
<br/>
How To Talk So Kids Will Listen and Listen So Kids Will Talk by Faber  <br/>
and Mazlich<br/>
Siblings Without Rivalry also by Faber and Mazlich<br/>
<br/>
The How To Talk book is a great first step away from conventional  <br/>
parenting. Faber and Mazlich don&#39;t go far enough but they can get  <br/>
your thoughts turned around.<br/>
<br/>
Even better -- I&#39;ve heard but haven&#39;t read -- is Naomi Aldort&#39;s  <br/>
Raising Our Children, Raising Ourselves. I haven&#39;t heard anything bad  <br/>
about it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>THose are some really good points, Sandra. They sting a bit, but there is a lot of truth there! When I said &quot;wishy-washy,&quot; that might have been the wrong word. What I meant was that I have vacilated between more conventional forms of parenting and gentle parenting. I read some books early on in my parenting that gave me a very punitive mind set.I am really trying to stop thinking that way- but as Joyce pointed out, punitive parenting focuses on the negative. For example, when one son calls the other one an&quot;idiot,&quot; my first reaction is: &quot;I have to stop this name calling. If I make it undesirable to name call, he won&#39;t do it anymore..&quot; Now I know this is wrong, and what I think is required is a whole mind shift-focusing on the children as people that I love, instead of focusing on behavior. I have a lot of food or thought. Thanks so much for the input, and I&#39;ll keep you &quot;posted&quot; as to what happens :).</div>

<br/>
They possibly have stung as much as &quot;idiot,&quot; &quot;shut-up,&quot; and &quot;shut your  <br/>
mouth.&quot;   If one of your children is being treated that way in her own  <br/>
home, you&#39;re not keeping them safe enough.<br/>
<br/>
-=-This is not the way they have been spoken to- but...-= -  (from the  <br/>
original post)<br/>
<br/>
But they were being punished somehow, so they were being treated in  <br/>
those ways, perhaps without the exact words.   Punishment is about  <br/>
declaring/proving that someone is wrong/sinful/stupid and that he  <br/>
needs to shut up (one way or another).  No matter how &quot;peaceful&quot; the  <br/>
punishment might be, it still involves power and judgment and has a  <br/>
loser.   A winner and a loser.  Ultimately several losers, because the  <br/>
parents lose out on the chance to undo it, and the grandchildren might  <br/>
suffer similar losses of choice, freedom and happiness if the children  <br/>
aren&#39;t shown a better way.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you came to ask us for ideas!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
While you&#39;re changing your thinking, consider that a synonym doesn&#39;t  <br/>
change the underlying thoughts.   Whether you say you were wishy-washy  <br/>
or vacillating or jumping back and forth or undecided or thrashing  <br/>
mightily about, you couldn&#39;t figure out how to act because you hadn&#39;t  <br/>
decided how you wanted to be.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s good that you don&#39;t want to vacillate mightily back and forth  <br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
This might help:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/choices">http://sandradodd.com/choices</a><br/>
<br/>
If there are a thousand choices, or even three choices, how do you  <br/>
choose?  Some people like to live without choices, so they can say &quot;I  <br/>
had no choice.&quot;  People say that all the time, even about spanking  <br/>
their kids.  It&#39;s not very bright.<br/>
<br/>
So how do you choose?  You decide where you want to go before you  <br/>
decide to turn left or right, don&#39;t you?<br/>
Just like that.<br/>
<br/>
The way to know the right direction is to identify the wrong direction.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
 </span></blockquote>As a suggestion of where to begin.....<br/>
<br/>
Namecalling  is kind of a way to push someone away. Maybe the kids need <br/>
more space - more physical space. Maybe they need more chance to spend <br/>
time alone. Maybe they&#39;re needing more one-on-one time with mom or dad.<br/>
<br/>
It really helps when you have multiple kids to mix up the combinations a <br/>
lot. This means be aware - take only one kid off to the grocery store <br/>
with you and have fun together in the car and in the store.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure you&#39;re responding to each child as an individual, not to &quot;the <br/>
kids&quot; as a group.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - I think Joyce&#39;s point is a good one - think about the <br/>
circumstances under which the name calling is happening - don&#39;t focus on <br/>
the name calling itself.<br/>
<br/>
Is someone feeling really hurt by any of the namecalling or is it that <br/>
you don&#39;t like the atmosphere it is creating?<br/>

<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Our general attitude in our house is one of fun and being kind to one<br/>
another.  Sometimes people feel snarky anyway, or get irritated with one<br/>
another.  We all have our moody moments and sometimes we say things we<br/>
don&#39;t mean to and sometimes sibling personalities clash.<br/>
<br/>
What you are describing sounds like meanness, or lack of an ability to<br/>
communicate before anger sets in.  Both of my kids have figured out ways<br/>
to take themselves out of the situation, Chamille, more so than Margaux,<br/>
largely because she&#39;s older and more thoughtful about it.  Margaux still<br/>
struggles with how to be nice when things aren&#39;t going smoothly.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard to tell, based on what you wrote, about the context in which<br/>
mean things have been said.  Sometimes younger siblings get too much<br/>
into the older siblings spaces, and there is nowhere for them to go to<br/>
get away from younger siblings.  We work on that underlying issue more<br/>
than the name calling.  Name calling doesn&#39;t just happen for no reason,<br/>
there&#39;s always a reason.  It&#39;s not the fault of a younger sibling, when<br/>
the older sibling has nowhere to go.<br/>
<br/>
None of that, is what I set out to say.  I was going to say, that more<br/>
than anything, we are always saying nice things about each other.  We<br/>
point out each others good qualities, more than pointing out our faults.<br/>
When you intentionally set out to focus on the good in others, you&#39;ll<br/>
see it more and people will behave more like their good qualities.  That<br/>
is what happens with my kids and how they see each other.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not sure how else to say that, but how it plays out, is<br/>
complimenting each other and noticing and pointing out when we do good<br/>
things or cool things.  Belittling and name calling will happen less and<br/>
less, the more you do this.</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-503241196">Hello to all!<br/>
I just want to thank you all for your input. When Pam asked if the cchildren are being hurt by the name-calling, it is my conviction that even though they might not appear&quot;hurt&quot; by the words, it is damaging just the same. As Sandra pointed out, and in my own opinion, no-one should have to live in an environment(especially home) where he/she is subject to name-calling. It sticks with us whether we like it or not. Pam, I know you didn&#39;t mean to say that it doesn&#39;t matter, even if the name calling doesn&#39;t bother them, but I want to make myself clear in that I don&#39;t think name calling or belittling is ever O.K.<br/>
I think it might be like deschooling-For every year of punitive parenting, it&#39;s going to take that much time of mindful parenting before things change. <br/>
Thanks for all the wonderful links and places to read. I will be busy the next couple days! I am so thankful to have friends to share with.<br/>

name-calling that is very hurtful, intended to be hurtful. Sometimes <br/>
there is namecalling that is lighthearted expression of a little <br/>
annoyance or a little warning sign that someone isn&#39;t happy. Sometimes <br/>
it is humor. Sometimes it is the way kids have heard others express <br/>

<br/>
My point was not that it should be ignored, but that you should ask <br/>
yourself questions about it. One question might be whether someone is <br/>
really being hurt. Namecalling is the result of something and possibly <br/>
the cause of something. Look more deeply at what is really happening <br/>
right there with your own real kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1956416784">-= It&#39;s not a license to call people stupid. I took it as<br/>
talking to one&#39;s children to reframe the qualities of what it means to<br/>
be human, with the attitude that name calling is kinda silly both ways;<br/>
how not to take it so seriously when someone calls you a name-=-<br/>
<br/>
I agree with her statement about &quot;either it&#39;s true or it&#39;s not,&quot; and I  <br/>
said something like that to Brett last night because he was upset to  <br/>
have been accused of something he didn&#39;t do at work.<br/>
<br/>
Advising someone not to take it so seriously is peachy.  Encouraging  <br/>
or condoning words like &quot;stupid,&quot; though, I think is not NEARLY as  <br/>
good as discussing what the child means by &quot;stupid,&quot; and what the  <br/>
situation is that&#39;s leading to the desire to be hurtful.<br/>
<br/>
The example Naomi Aldort used was to say &quot;I&#39;m stupid, the President&#39;s  <br/>
stupid, everyone&#39;s stupid&quot;  (not a word for word quote, sorry; I don&#39;t  <br/>
want to listen to it twice).     She used the example of knocking over  <br/>
a glass of milk. I know that when people are speaking at conferences  <br/>
it&#39;s easy to come up with imperfect examples, but let&#39;s assume the  <br/>
example isn&#39;t one she would edit out if she had a chance to pick a  <br/>
different one.<br/>
<br/>
Spilling milk isn&#39;t &quot;stupid.&quot;  An accident doesn&#39;t make someone  <br/>
&quot;stupid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
When I&#39;m discussing situations and decisions with my kids to help them  <br/>
see what the range of options is in any situation, and we&#39;re talking  <br/>
about choices or the consequences of choices, there&#39;s better and  <br/>
there&#39;s worse and there&#39;s regrettable and there&#39;s brilliant sometimes,  <br/>
but it&#39;s not &quot;stupid&quot; to make a mistake from which one can do better  <br/>
the next time.<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;stupid&quot; can be clarified as something else--careless, thoughtless,  <br/>
irrational, irritating--then THAT can be dealt with, but there&#39;s no  <br/>
cure for stupidity, and use of the term seems to have no purpose but  <br/>
to condemn, judge and insult.<br/>

<br/>
Well yes and this is very close to what I was getting at when I said I <br/>
didn&#39;t like the cultural connotation of the word &quot;consequence(s)&quot;...   <br/>
Whether or not something yields a result you can live with depends on <br/>
all kinds of things about regret and brilliance, and nothing to do with <br/>
calling it &quot;stupid&quot; or a &quot;consequence some person deserves&quot; which to me <br/>
signals an anger reflex of some kind (annoyance or whatever) from <br/>
messing up or something that happened unintentionally.<br/>
<br/>
In my experience, it helps to find ways to realize &quot;ok there&#39;s my <br/>
reflex going off&quot; and then figuring out that &quot;hey, this is what just <br/>
happened.&quot;  Spilled milk enters into it for some people who haven&#39;t <br/>
gotten over being upset about messes.  Otherwise spilled milk wouldn&#39;t <br/>
matter.  It only matters as to how one relates with other people.  <br/>
Picture me getting upset when *anything* is spilled if I have a horror <br/>
over mess.  It helps to say &quot;hey, this is what just happened.. some <br/>
milk is spilled&quot;  .... and realizing that the word &quot;stupid&quot; may be my <br/>
reflex going off helps get over being upset about messes and go right <br/>
to &quot;oh let&#39;s clean it up.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Just substitute other words for &quot;stupid&quot; like &quot;wrong.&quot;  Things can go <br/>
wrong but feeling that some person is wrong is usually a roadblock <br/>
unless it happens to be true in the particular instance.  Looking at <br/>
what happened and going from there makes more sense than saying &quot;wrong <br/>
wrong.&quot;  If it&#39;s true that some person is wrong, it only helps if the <br/>
person who&#39;s wrong realizes it and can change.  And, right, spilling <br/>
milk wouldn&#39;t be the wrong part.<br/>

Thank you for pointing this out, Sandra.

I know I need to figure out the underlying cause of the name-calling.

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1369025441">-=- HOW do I keep my children safe from each others&#39; words without  <br/>
making the &quot;name-caller&quot; feel bad for choosing to say hurtful things? - <br/>
=-<br/>
<br/>
The responses to the original question have been about learning enough  <br/>
yourself about how to create a good environment for the kids so they  <br/>
won&#39;t have the frustrations that are leading to the name calling.    <br/>
Don&#39;t look at &quot;he hit her,&quot; look at what she did just before that, and  <br/>
why she did THAT, and what happened before THAT and it might come back  <br/>
to the mom should&#39;ve been providing more for them to do, or making  <br/>
sure they had eaten, that their toys or games were safe, that none of  <br/>
the kids had felt ignored...<br/>
<br/>
Generally speaking (and also pretty specifically speaking, but without  <br/>
a 100% guarantee), the children of attentive moms have fewer problems  <br/>
than the children of moms who are saying &quot;later&quot; or &quot;not now&quot; or &quot;just  <br/>
go play.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
-=- HOW do I keep my children safe from each others&#39; words without  <br/>
making the &quot;name-caller&quot; feel bad for choosing to say hurtful things? - <br/>
=-<br/>
<br/>
Now it&#39;s been rephrased to the realm of choices, which makes it a  <br/>
whole different situation.<br/>
  If the &quot;name caller&quot; chose to say a hurtful thing, why wouldn&#39;t you  <br/>
want him to feel bad?<br/>
If a person never &quot;feels bad&quot; about anything, what possible motivation  <br/>
would there be to do better?   There wouldn&#39;t be any such thing as  <br/>
&quot;better&quot; if the parent defines all things as equally good.<br/>
<br/>
If Holly calls Marty a douche, perhaps Marty was exhibiting douchish  <br/>
behavior just before that.  (Both things have actually occurred, in  <br/>
our home, and so that&#39;s not a hypothetical.)  If Marty was being  <br/>
antagonistic, or causing other people to laugh at Holly&#39;s expense,  <br/>
Holly might not need to feel so bad.  If Marty was actually in the  <br/>
process of trying to help Holly with something and she called him a  <br/>
douche, then she absolutely should feel bad, and I won&#39;t hesitate to  <br/>
point that out.<br/>
<br/>
The answer to all of these kinds of things is &quot;it depends,&quot; but the  <br/>
concrete advice is to be there more, doing things with them (them as a  <br/>
group and them individually) instead of leaving  them in one place  <br/>
while you&#39;re in another place.<br/>

What&#39;s wrong with a kid feeling bad for hurting someone&#39;s feelings by<br/>
calling them names?  Shouldn&#39;t kids feel remorse from doing something<br/>
wrong?  They aren&#39;t immune from having a conscience.  This is a good<br/>
thing, I would think!  With the whole gammit of emotions and human<br/>
failings and human doings, kids will eventually feel it all, just like<br/>
everyone else.  It&#39;s what we do with those feelings that makes a<br/>
difference.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Ok this is getting into the realm of what I was thinking about earlier. <br/>
  People do things that drive others batty sometimes.  Name calling <br/>
doesn&#39;t address the issues, yet it has a certain &quot;ahem&quot; to it.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s possible that an older sibling is annoyed at a younger sibling&#39;s <br/>
behavior and doesn&#39;t realize that the younger sibling has yet to figure <br/>
out to do better BUT it takes time because it&#39;s not just a logical <br/>
development.  Learning to consider the development of younger siblings <br/>
can be crazymaking for the older siblings who are concurrently <br/>
developing their own understanding.  I remember this clearly with my <br/>
own sisters.  And sometimes it wasn&#39;t about development.  The little <br/>
one is capable of looking for a reaction from a sibling too.<br/>

The name calling is like the steam coming out of the pressure cooker.  <br/>

is to plug up the release valve so you don&#39;t see the steam. Big  <br/>

I have been thinking a lot about what is actually going on with the name calling in our home, and I realize that it is just what you are saying. The kids aren&#39;t being malicious or ill-willed. It is a bad habit-almost a default mechanism- when frustration builds. I think what happens is that I have been too focused on stopping behaviors. We do have a lot of children and a lot of personal stuff going on in our lives right now, and I think the tendency when I am overwhelmed is to stop behaviors rather than invest the time to foster healthy relationships. I am not saying this is right; in fact, it breaks my heart. There is no excuse good enough to not take the time to build strong relationships with our children.</div>

&gt; &gt; words without making the &quot;name-caller&quot; feel bad for choosing to say  <br/>
&gt; &gt; hurtful things?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They *should* feel bad. But they shouldn&#39;t be *made* to feel bad.  <br/>
&gt; They shouldn&#39;t be humiliated or shamed.<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>This is the crux of it for me:  seeing the difference between<br/>
allowing a child to feel bad for choosing to treat somebody<br/>
else in a hurtful way, on the one hand, versus shaming the<br/>
child, on the other hand.  Recognizing that it is okay for a child<br/>
to feel ashamed of him/herself... so long as *I* did not put that<br/>
idea of &quot;you should be ashamed of that behavior&quot; out there...<br/>
or &quot;in there&quot; as in, into the child&#39;s head.<br/>
<br/>
Am I getting this?<br/>

I don&#39;t mind putting an idea into a child&#39;s head.  I would put that  <br/>
idea in ANYone&#39;s head who was rude at my house or rude to one of my  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
Treating my kids like people sometimes means saying something like  <br/>
&quot;That wasn&#39;t very nice.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
There&#39;s a big difference between &quot;You should be ashamed of yourself.   <br/>
I&#39;m going to wash your mouth out with soap.  If you can&#39;t be nicer  <br/>
than that, go into your room and stay there,&quot; and &quot;Next time could you  <br/>
be nicer?&quot;<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I don&#39;t know - that still seems a little too namby-pamby.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve asked, &quot;Why did you say that?&quot; Or, I&#39;ve said, &quot;You said X to <br/>
so-and-so and her feelings are hurt.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And my child has thought about it and felt really bad for doing it.<br/>
<br/>
Some might call that &quot;shaming&quot; - but I think it is helping.<br/>
<br/>
The next step is to help or encourage them to do something about it or, <br/>
if that&#39;s not possible, to do better next time.<br/>
<br/>
I think think the idea of not shaming our kids is more along the lines <br/>
of don&#39;t send them a howler (Harry Potter reference).  When I felt the <br/>
need to speak to my kids about something they&#39;d done (thrown sand, <br/>
called someone names, grabbed a toy from someone else, etc.), I would <br/>
take them aside, not embarrass them. One time another mom criticized me <br/>
for not reprimanding my child for something. I told her she had no idea <br/>
what I&#39;d said to my own child because anything I had to say to her was <br/>
done in private so I wouldn&#39;t further embarrass her. The mom said that I <br/>
should do it in public so that the other kids knew that she was getting <br/>
in trouble, too, and otherwise it looked like she got away with <br/>
everything when they didn&#39;t.<br/>

I have a hard time with parents giving me dirty looks at the playground when I let my daughter do things that they don&#39;t allow their children to do (running barefoot on the playground comes to mind.)  I suppose part of it is learning to focus on your child and ignore the criticisms...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2031326301">Well, I got into a few screaming matches with that particular mom, over <br/>
the years, so emulating me is probably not a great idea! I had to learn <br/>
a lot of things the hard way.<br/>
<br/>
What I would do now would be to, one time and one time only, say, <br/>
&quot;That&#39;s not how I do things.&quot; After that, I&#39;d ignore that person <br/>
entirely. I mean, literally look blank faced and then look away and get <br/>
occupied elsewhere. And then avoid the person after that, if possible.<br/>
<br/>
But, this is a person with severe problems - a parent who also tried to <br/>
impose her micromanaging incredibly controlling ways on other people.  <br/>
If it was a person I thought I could actually communicate with, I might <br/>
respond with, &quot;She&#39;s embarrassed enough about having behaved badly in <br/>
the first place, so I try not to embarrass her further by my reaction.&quot;<br/>
