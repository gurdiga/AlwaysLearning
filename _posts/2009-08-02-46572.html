<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561405768">Based on several requests, I will be making some changes to the registration deadline for the Good Vibrations Unschooling Conference.<br/>
<br/>
Online Registration is still open and will remain open until Friday, August 14. The current May 1- Aug 1 prices still apply; there are no increases.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, this change means that there will be absolutely NO Walk-In<br/>
registrations. Please be registered by Aug 14- no exceptions- or you will not be admitted to the conference.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you,<br/>
<br/>
Flo Gascon<br/>
Conference Coordinator<br/>
