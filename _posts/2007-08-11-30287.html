<div id="ygrps-yiv-1217492287">I feel like sharing this *it works* example<br/>
<br/>
My daughter cassie (4) sleeps on the couch and durning the day she <br/>
is usually on the couch. Other daughter Dani(2) camps out in a <br/>
basket with pillows.<br/>
<br/>
Cassie came home today and crashed on *her* couch, the problem was <br/>
that just minutes before Dani was hanging out on the couch. They <br/>
both wanted the couch without the other one.<br/>
<br/>
They proceeded to scratch and pull at each other. I took them both <br/>
and said we do not hurt each other we can work this out. Cassie <br/>
proceeded to scream at the top of her lungs and Dani tried to bury <br/>
her head in the pillows.<br/>
<br/>
I sat between them and started talking about how each one wanted the <br/>
couch and there had to be some way to work it out.<br/>
<br/>
Ideas--<br/>
sit on both ends<br/>
cassie couch dani basket<br/>
Older brother said Dani gets it she never gets it<br/>
dad said cut it in half<br/>
dad said buy a new recliner<br/>
I said lay together<br/>
<br/>
after a few minutes of negotiating and nothing working<br/>
I got up off the couch<br/>
<br/>
Cassie took the cushions off the couch and *made* her own couch on <br/>
the floor and got pillows for Dani to cushion her couch.<br/>
<br/>
The point is they found a way to make it work and on their own- not <br/>
because I made them share or took sides or made it fair. <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for being there to teach me how to respect both my <br/>
kids and others. It is not my way or your way it can all be worked <br/>
out somehow when you put enough brain cells to it.  <br/>
