<div id="ygrps-yiv-1785683320">The subject line was what came with the writing below.  I&#39;ve edited a  <br/>
little below, not to change any details, but to disguise writing.<br/>
<br/>
Please help me be Dear Abby or Ann Landers to this anonymous person  <br/>
asking for her friend.<br/>
<br/>
===============================================<br/>
<br/>
  I would like to ask your opinion on a matter that someone brought up  <br/>
and wants an answer to. For the protection of said person I will write  <br/>
about her calling her &quot;Jane Doe&quot;.  She could be anyone.<br/>
<br/>
The subject came up while reading the drug thread on [AlwaysLearning]...<br/>
<br/>
Jane used a certain drug for 16 years. She used it even in the  <br/>
beginning  years of being with her husband to be. She kept it hidden.  <br/>
Hidden from her family too.   She and her husband talked about past  <br/>
drug use and he said once, &quot;You would never use that drug would you?&quot;  <br/>
She didn&#39;t answer. He believes she&#39;s not the type to do that.  She has  <br/>
been clean, on her own, for 10 or so years.  She would never do it  <br/>
again.  She never told him because she is afraid he will see her  <br/>
differently.<br/>
<br/>
Recently, however, he asked her if she was ever addicted or used any  <br/>
drugs.  She asked why and he said because,sometimes if you did, you  <br/>
could have medical problems later in life......hmmm. What should she  <br/>
do? Some people say,what&#39;s in the past is the past.  She is ashamed to  <br/>
admit to it.  She believes you don&#39;t live your future by your past and  <br/>
I think that&#39;s good but should she tell her husband?<br/>
<br/>
===================================================<br/>
<br/>
-=-She could be anyone.-=-<br/>
<br/>
She couldn&#39;t be me.  I don&#39;t have a single secret from Keith, nor did  <br/>
I have from any of my boyfriends ever.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Should the past be known to your husband?-=-<br/>
<br/>
YIKES!  Yes.  But before he&#39;s the husband.  Now, it&#39;s a problem.<br/>
<br/>
When Marty was younger (7, 8) he would tell stories.  Good stories,  <br/>
but he would tell them in first person as though he really did these  <br/>
things.   That&#39;s called lying.   He didn&#39;t set out to lie.  He wasn&#39;t  <br/>
dodging truth to get out of &quot;trouble,&quot; but he was spinning yarns.   I  <br/>
told him then that it&#39;s important to be the kind of person others  <br/>
believe.  If they trust his accounts it will make him a better person  <br/>
and a better friend.<br/>
<br/>
The Boy who Cried &quot;Wolf&quot; comes to mind, for mainstream warnings about  <br/>
the value of honesty.<br/>
<br/>
In the SCA I&#39;ve had students over the years, and it&#39;s been in the  <br/>
field of service and virtue--&quot;being good.&quot;  Philosophy.   Politics,  <br/>
sometimes.  Management/organization/inspiration stuff.   I&#39;ve had  <br/>
eight or a dozen, depending how they&#39;re counted.  Some have had no  <br/>
problems with being candid and straightforward, and others had a  <br/>
sneaky streak.  What I&#39;ve advised to help them do better is to say if  <br/>
they live in such a way that they aren&#39;t ashamed, then they&#39;ll find it  <br/>
easier to tell the truth.<br/>
<br/>
But that moves back a step to the drug use itself.   And that wasn&#39;t  <br/>
the question.<br/>
<br/>
When anyone does anything they&#39;re going to choose to keep secret, that  <br/>
risk can affect things way down the road. If someone lied to a  <br/>
boyfriend, and then got married, and then kept lying, and that keeps  <br/>
her from being able to have the kind of relationship with her husband  <br/>
that will make unschooling work, or if it causes a divorce so that her  <br/>
children aren&#39;t able to grow up with both parents together, the best  <br/>
use for this list might be to see the situation and help our children  <br/>
be the kind of people who don&#39;t get into similar situations.<br/>
<br/>
Not very direct.  I hope other people have direct ideas.<br/>

Maybe he knows and isn&#39;t comfortable pretending not to know.<br/>
<br/>
I mean, otherwise, I don&#39;t understand why he&#39;s asking.<br/>
<br/>
She could start with saying, &quot;So, you asked a couple of times about any <br/>
former drug use, and I wondered what made you ask?&quot;<br/>

<br/>
It really depends *greatly* on the quality of the relationship in the first<br/>
place, as to whether or not one should out oneself after keeping it quiet<br/>
and then being clean for 10+ years.<br/>
<br/>
I had a bit of hmmm.. at wondering just what medical problems he could be<br/>
referring to.  There are those but is that really why he wants to know?  Or<br/>
is it not really why?  I&#39;d want to know if that&#39;s the problem.  It was<br/>
stated pretty close to the beginning of the post.  Just what is the worry<br/>
there?<br/>
<br/>
Telling all can be devastating and could end in divorce and the kids not<br/>
really having either of the parents, realistically speaking, no matter which<br/>
parent (or whoever else) ends up with custody.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that confession is not the first consideration.  If a person is<br/>
worried that it would change the husband&#39;s perception of her, then that to<br/>
me is good enough reason to take Pam&#39;s approach and find out more<br/>
information.<br/>
<br/>
Because.  If it&#39;s just a matter of the husband perhaps even being curious<br/>
himself about drug use at this late date, maybe he has no idea of the health<br/>
effects.  And maybe that&#39;s what he&#39;s really asking.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1371954092">I&#39;ve got varied perspectives on this one, all wrapped up in me!<br/>
When I met Mitch, DDH (Dead Darling Husband), I dubbed him a Thug. He hung<br/>
out with local dealers, though he didn&#39;t seem an addict.<br/>
Once we began dating, he kept me (& us) far from that lifestyle and I<br/>
realized he saw me as a chance to start over. Even moving the two of us to<br/>
South Dakota to have a clean chance at a new life, away from the temptations<br/>
of his former lifestyle.<br/>
Even after dating, living together, moving, marriage and children, I knew<br/>
very, very few details of this Thug existence he lived. Only that he<br/>
collected money for his friends who were dealers. That&#39;s it. I knew that if<br/>
I pressed, I could get answers, and I knew those answers would change how I<br/>
looked at this Man before me. I chose not to ask. I chose, instead to live<br/>
in the Now and let him live there, too, without regret or fear.<br/>
After his Los Angeles funeral, I was invited a by the few friends I knew to<br/>
join a larger group in celebration of Mitch.  Once there, however, I<br/>
realized the stories being told were of that time, that pleasantly unknown<br/>
to me time, of mischeif and mayhem.  I chose to leave and maintain the<br/>
memories of the Mitch I knew, leaving them with their own memories,<br/>
untainted by my reaction - and I tossed in the modern version of Mitch for<br/>
&#39;em too :)<br/>
The difference here, I suppose is the fact that I had a choice to know, and<br/>
chose ignorance.<br/>
A life partner deserves that choice.<br/>
<br/>
I have the sneaky streak Sandra described, after a childhood of lying as<br/>
survival, knowing that I&#39;ve kinda swung to the other end of the spectrum.<br/>
At 40, I&#39;m feeling like I&#39;m finding my happy middle :D<br/>
I&#39;m pretty much out there, open and trusting.  I have faith that if you love<br/>
me now, you&#39;ll not mind the path it took for me to get here.  I count on<br/>
that among my friends and loved ones.  It&#39;s been THE most painful experience<br/>
to have some chunk of my past result in present disappointment.  So I<br/>
understand the fear.<br/>
I think it&#39;s fair to say to one&#39;s partner, &quot;there are things I&#39;ve done that<br/>
I have a hard time discussing because I fear your opinion of me will<br/>
change.&quot;<br/>
I also think it&#39;s fair to say to YOU: you fear their judgment because you<br/>
are judging yourself harshly.<br/>
If you really see the addiction/recovery as a journey of growth and becoming<br/>
who you are right now, and however painful the experience, it has added to<br/>
your experience/toolbox/life through positive lessons, then you should share<br/>
it as just that.  What you went through to learn what you learned and now<br/>
you are here. Once you were there, not now.<br/>
The responsibility&#39;s on you, at this point, to sit down and dish it out.<br/>
Here&#39;s how I learned of Mitch&#39;s son he gave up for adoption (which would<br/>
have caused me to break up with him immediately if I knew, I had an<br/>
Absolutely No Children Anywhere Rule for Dating):<br/>
I met Kimmy and Jerry. We hung out 3 or 4 times and Mitch says, &quot;I used to<br/>
date Kimmy&quot; oh, I thought, she&#39;s nice, she&#39;s got a boyfriend, how cool he&#39;s<br/>
still friends with her.<br/>
3 months later: &quot;We lived together at my mom&#39;s house.&quot; oh, still I liked<br/>
them fine. I knew he loved me.<br/>
3 more months later: &quot;Wanna see pictures of Thomas? He&#39;s the son we had<br/>
together and gave up for adoption&quot; oh god, the kid was so cute, it was too<br/>
late. :)<br/>
Now Hayden knows Thomas is over 18 and might someday find us, to get<br/>
information about their dad.  Kimmy also has another son, with Jerry. Hayden<br/>
and Jerry Jr share a brother, Thomas, but are not truly related to each<br/>
other.  Hayden can&#39;t wait to meet either of them :)<br/>
So what could be, and would have been for me, a big display of righteous<br/>
judgment, became instead a really cool web of existence for our family.<br/>
Like Maslow, I side on the sunny side of humanity. We do the best we can<br/>
with what we have. When we know better we do better.<br/>
Do better.<br/>
