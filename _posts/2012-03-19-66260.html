I don&#39;t.  I have my food and eating collection here:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/food">http://sandradodd.com/food</a><br/>
<br/>
If I did have a blog about fast food, what would you have been looking for there?  You still haven&#39;t been specific.  <br/>
There&#39;s a drive-through hamburger place in Albuquerque that is not fast food.  People order and pull over and wait, if they got anything beyond a soda.  Each milk shake is made from the beginning; no hamburgers are cooked before they&#39;re ordered.  When they first put in a drive-through,  years ago, my husband said it was crazy, because the food isn&#39;t made very quickly.  (That&#39;s Blake&#39;s Lotaburger, a local favorite.)<br/>
<br/>
Some delicatessens and restaurants have some of their food pre-made hours before people come in.  That&#39;s &quot;fast.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In India I had some fast food that was made one bite at a time, though the little poofs were already made, and the sauces were made, they were assembled one at a time.   It reminded me of bars in the U.S. where people can drink one shot after another, but won&#39;t get a glass of the liquor.  People would eat three or six of these things, but they were made and eaten one at a time.  I don&#39;t remember what they were called.  Looked it up:  Pani puri.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-45225319">My question was rather cryptic, wasn&#39;t It?<br/>
<br/>
I was hoping that this group could help me think through my daughter&#39;s<br/>
daily requests (no exaggeration) to eat at McDonald&#39;s, Burger King, Taco<br/>
Bell, Wendy&#39;s and ChickFilA , the only fast food places in our area.<br/>
<br/>
I was concerned about the high levels of artificial chemicals in their<br/>
foods (I&#39;ve read the ingredient lists), but then I started thinking about<br/>
the groceries I buy.  I realized that commercially made bread and buns and<br/>
frozen potato products and ketchup, just to name a few, have similar<br/>
chemicals.<br/>
<br/>
The recent thread on children learning to self-regulate their food choices<br/>
had me wondering if I should say yes to every request, finances permitting,<br/>
to eat at one of the places mentioned above.<br/>

Thanks so much for your help,<br/>

<h4>Brady or Misti H</h4>
<time>20 Mar 2012, at  4:30pm</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-233142772">I have found that when my daughter is asking to eat at a fast food<br/>
restaurant, it&#39;s not necessarily the eating at the fast food joint that<br/>
she&#39;s after -- she just likes to eat out of the house.  We do now eat at a<br/>
fast food restaurant occasionally (planned or on a whim), and we don&#39;t have<br/>
daily requests anymore.  It is fun to eat out and it feels exciting to the<br/>
kids.  Another thing we&#39;ll do to satisfy eating out is to have a picnic or<br/>
to stop at a grocery store&#39;s salad/fruit/olivebar/soup buffet.  The one we<br/>
go to has a nice, window-y spot to sit and eat.  It&#39;s always interesting to<br/>
see what each kid (6 and 3) will choose off of a buffet, and since it&#39;s a<br/>
pay by pound deal, it&#39;s about the cost of eating at a fast food joint...<br/>
and it&#39;s still &quot;fast food.&quot;  :)<br/>
