<br/>
I am good at dissecting our activities, such that our fun busy <br/>
interesting lives look like &quot;school&quot; on paper, but this is actually <br/>
the thing that troubles me.  Having to do this 180 times a year for <br/>
a &quot;daily log&quot; keeps my brain tied to my old &quot;school&quot;y way of <br/>
thinking.  I have learned to keep the log away from my kids, so it is <br/>
just my own head that suffers about it. **<br/>
<br/>
Can you keep a daily &quot;journal&quot; that&#39;s more for fun and your own recollection, and then only rethink about it as &quot;subjects&quot; once a week or once a month?  You&#39;d still be cranking out a &quot;daily&quot; report, but  in a batch, so you wouldn&#39;t have to think about it in those terms every single day.<br/>
<br/>
**<br/>
Another way <br/>
is to keep a pretty thorough log for one year, but turn in a very <br/>
abbreviated form of it and wait to see if that is accepted. <br/>
**<br/>
This sounds like a sensible strategy.<br/>
