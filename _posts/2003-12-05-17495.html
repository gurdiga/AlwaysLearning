<div id="ygrps-yiv-1338448205">I&#39;m working on reading it, so far only two pages into it or so.  I&#39;m keeping<br/>
it in my van and reading it when I have to wait for something or someone,<br/>
which right now is very little as I&#39;m about three weeks from my due date and<br/>
have made life easier by delagating all errands to DH and not signing kids<br/>
up for stuff until after the first of the year.  So I may have to pull it<br/>
out of the van and just read it. :)  After I finish Return of the King, I&#39;ve<br/>
never read The Lord of the Rings series before but the movies have inspired<br/>
me and I&#39;m glad.<br/>
<br/>
From what I&#39;ve read it seems to be advocating less pressure and activities<br/>
and more free/down time for kids.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1435978376">Hi.  I&#39;ve been on this list for awhile, I think I even posted an Intro, but<br/>
this is my first quest...  for background, my daughter will be 5 in a<br/>
month.  We do classes, like gymnastics and we&#39;ve found a great art class,<br/>
but otherwise we don&#39;t do school.  We do make games out of learning stuff<br/>
all the time, but I usually get the ideas from my daughter and then I<br/>
follow her lead.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, our current situation is this... she complains about being bored.<br/>
I know this is nothing new to kids, but she explains it more as having<br/>
outgrown all of her toys; she does tend to do the same play day-in and<br/>
day-out.  It seems as though she is really looking for more of a challenge,<br/>
but I need some ideas here... the &quot;usual&quot; challenge (or change anyway) that<br/>
is offered to kids is to go into school.<br/>
<br/>
When she was younger I would have said that she is ready to make a huge<br/>
leap forward with some development.  I&#39;m sure this is going on now, I just<br/>
don&#39;t have as much of an idea about what the development would be and how<br/>
to support it as compared to when she was a toddler.<br/>

Any thoughts?   Thanks<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1653360735">&lt;&lt;Any thoughts?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
From your post, I gather she is an only child.  Do Y&#39;all do park days with<br/>
other kids?  Even my 13 year old loves these and wishes we could go more<br/>
than once a week.<br/>
<br/>
My kids rarely play with toys and I thought long and hard about it.  I<br/>
finally realized that most of the toys on the market today are fairly<br/>
one-dimensional.  Not a lot to them, so specialized that you can tell the<br/>
makers are trying to lead you into only playing with the toy in a certain<br/>
way.  Something someone else (I think Sandra) posted on in the past that I<br/>
thought was great was to just set some things out on the table that usually<br/>
aren&#39;t played with together, like Barbies and Playdoh, or dominoes and cars,<br/>
that kind of thing and see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Something that my kids love and that sparks lots of stuff around here is my<br/>
always trying to &quot;make it ourselves&quot;, like marshmallows, shampoo, soap,<br/>
cheese, coasters  that kind of stuff.  The kids see things in a different<br/>
light when they see how they are made.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-107340729">Hi.  I&#39;m new to the list and haven&#39;t posted an intro yet either.  :)<br/>
I&#39;m Alicia, mama to Victoria (5), Annalee (3) and Jack (7 months).<br/>
<br/>
Here&#39;s some stuff that my 5 year old loves to do:<br/>
<br/>
Reading, with lots of trips to the library to pick out more books (she<br/>
likes to both read and be read to)<br/>
<br/>
art-- I believe in making quality art materials available to children<br/>
because you can&#39;t produce satisfying art with cheap junk.  :)  I&#39;m<br/>
frugal in most stuff but I think it&#39;s worth the extra in this case.<br/>
Some materials that we have are-- oil pastels, crayons, markers,<br/>
watercolor paints in tubes and in trays, bleeding tissue paper (stains<br/>
the paper when you wet it, really cool projects if you cut it and<br/>
paint water onto a white sheet and then lay the tissue paper on),<br/>
charcoal pencils, construction paper, art paper (copy paper doesn&#39;t<br/>
hold paint well), stamps and ink pads and watercolor crayons and<br/>
pencils.  These last ones are especially fun.  You draw with them and<br/>
then paint with water to blend the colors.<br/>
<br/>
crafts-- We have lots of beads and strings for necklaces, ribbons and<br/>
buttons for embellishing socks, etc.<br/>
<br/>
She is learning to sew/darn and really enjoys that.<br/>
<br/>
She loves blocks, especially colored ones to make elaborate patterns<br/>
with.  www.hearthsong.com has great block sets that are really<br/>
creative and fun.  She also plays with Cuisenaire rods, which can be<br/>
used to explain all sorts of math subjects (fractions, addition,<br/>
algebra....).  We have these old colored, wooden shape blocks that she<br/>
adores and I&#39;ve been looking for 3 years for more.<br/>
<br/>
She likes watching PBS shows like ZOOM and then recreating the<br/>
experiments, recipes and crafts.<br/>
<br/>
We do kitchen experiments like putting bread in a bag and watching the<br/>
mold, getting out snow and salt and dirt and seeing the effects it<br/>
would have on icy roads, putting celery in colored water, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We go places a LOT.  We don&#39;t necessarily go to &quot;educational&quot; places<br/>
but it&#39;s all cool and interesting anyway.  When I was at the Mayo<br/>
Clinic for a bunch of tests, I brought my kids into the nuerologist&#39;s<br/>
appointment and asked him to bring up the EEG scans of my brain so my<br/>
girls could see.  How often do you get to see your mom&#39;s brain?  LOL<br/>
When we picked the cat up from the vet I asked if we could tour the<br/>
back.  When we get tires we go all over looking at how they use the<br/>
machines....  We also stop at rest stops and read all the signs and<br/>
stuff.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Both of my girls love spending time on the computer.  They have a<br/>
variety of games and art programs on it and they really enjoy it.<br/>
<br/>
My husband prints out coloring pages and worksheets from the net on<br/>
whatever subject they&#39;re interested in or he just surprises them.  I<br/>
think last week they colored these elaborate Native American turtle<br/>
designs, did llama coloring pages, answered a 20 questions page<br/>
designed for something completely different, did pages in about 6<br/>
workbooks they have (we get them for a dollar at the dollar store and<br/>
they love them) and colored and cut out masks from another site.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my girls love Brainquest cards.  They&#39;re spendy ($8-10) but<br/>
they like quizzing themselves or being quizzed, especially when<br/>
waiting in waiting rooms and stuff like that.<br/>
<br/>
Both girls like card games, concentration and similar games.<br/>
<br/>
Victoria loves marble runs that you build, and a marble maze we got at<br/>
a thrift store for a dollar.<br/>
<br/>
Both of my kids love cooking and cook often.  Young kids can make<br/>
bread (kneading and forming it into fun shapes is especially<br/>
rewarding), cookies, supper.....<br/>
<br/>
Craft projects like weaving, knitting or woodworking could be fun.<br/>
<br/>
My girls like helping me with mundane stuff like sorting socks,<br/>
folding clothes, using the dustbuster and lint roller, sweeping up<br/>
with the mini whisk, dusting, spraying and wiping surfaces, etc.  They<br/>
hate cleaning but love using most cleaning gadgets.  &lt;G&gt;<br/>
<br/>
We make sure the kids get lots of physical and sensory activities.<br/>
It&#39;s cold here so the basement is our rec area a lot of days.  They<br/>
have hippity hops to ride on, a trampoline, a sit n spin and so on.<br/>
Before we got the trampoline we let them jump on the couch and bed<br/>
because their physical need for the exercise and sensory input was<br/>
greater than our need for good springs.  &lt;G&gt;  It really helps regulate<br/>
their moods to get lots of movement too.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and we play music, dance, sing, make up songs, exercise and do<br/>
games like Simon Says.  Dulcimers or lap harps are easy enough for<br/>
preschoolers to learn to play, and sound beautiful.  We also have<br/>
flutes, maracas, tambourines, keyboards, ukeleles, small guitars and<br/>
instruments from other countries.<br/>
<br/>
We do stuff like treasure hunts, where I&#39;ll make up a list of 20<br/>
things to find in the house (something that starts with a B, something<br/>
orange, something that was once alive.....).  For my pre-reader, we<br/>
cut out magazine pictures and then glued them onto pages and she had<br/>
to find those (bed, letter R, this brand of cereal....).<br/>
<br/>
I agree with whoever said to look for open-ended toys.  Legos, blocks,<br/>
plastic animals, lite brite.... the same toys get used again and again<br/>
here.  My daughters will also create their own stuff to do with<br/>
string, tape, scissors and old boxes and paper towel tubes and stuff.<br/>
<br/>
Nature journals are fun, too.<br/>
<br/>
My kids have each other for company but I&#39;d probably seek out another<br/>
homeschooled child for company otherwise.  It&#39;s fun to have friends<br/>
over and lots of my kids&#39; favorite activities need a second person so<br/>
I can see how it would be harder not to get bored by yourself.<br/>
<br/>
Hope something in there helps.  :)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1614952396">Barb, our daughters are pretty close in age.  Victoria turned 5 in<br/>
May, so she&#39;s just a little older than your daughter.  Would your<br/>
daughter like a pen pal?  I think Victoria would really get a kick out<br/>
of it and we could send an art care package of some fun craft stuff<br/>
that we have extras of.  Write me offlist if you&#39;re interested.<br/>

homeschooled child for company otherwise.  It&#39;s fun to have friends<br/>

<br/>
I found that the same old activities, with the addition of another child, <br/>
were often quite different.  My kids have learned a lot from their friends, and <br/>
often the same old game takes a whole new aspect with a new kid involved, or a <br/>
toy they have has always been played with the same two or three ways, and <br/>
another kid has a new idea.<br/>
<br/>
I liked the list of ideas.  It mentioned learning to darn.   I darned one of <br/>
Holly&#39;s favorite socks.  Usually they have four matching pairs of something <br/>
and if one gets a hole I use it for a disposable cleaning rag and we move on.  <br/>
But she had a pair of patterned socks and really liked them.  So I darned a <br/>
hole.  She was amazed.  Just a couple of days ago she came in with the sock over <br/>
her hand and said &quot;This is So COOL!  This is so pretty.&quot;   <br/>
<br/>
Cheap thrills. &lt;g&gt;   Darning is so rarely done anymore.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1960871969">Awhile ago I posted about my notion of joining our local school as<br/>
homeschoolers rather than doing the R4.  I&#39;ve been meaning to post about<br/>
this again, and with the Jane&#39;s recent post (thanks, it was really great)<br/>
about letting go and trust I know it&#39;s time that I share again...<br/>
<br/>
Well, I got the paperwork and it sat on a shelf for a few weeks.  Then I<br/>
actually filled it out (I can&#39;t believe how many pieces of paper they<br/>
want!!), and that sat on the shelf again for weeks.  In fact, it&#39;s still<br/>
there.  We sort of got busy with life again!  I haven&#39;t had time to meet up<br/>
with my friend, and certainly haven&#39;t even thought about the paperwork.<br/>
<br/>
In the meantime, I&#39;ve been trusting more and more in life and it&#39;s journey.<br/>
It&#39;s not a thought anymore, something that I remind myself of; rather it<br/>
seems to be something that I&#39;m noticing after the fact.  This is really<br/>
nice, not only for me but for my whole family!<br/>
<br/>
One of the magical things that has happened has been a homeschool play<br/>
group starting in a nearby town.  It currently has 5 families, and 4 of<br/>
them are unschoolers - can you believe!!  We live pretty rurally, so I was<br/>
just amazed.  Needless to say I am in heaven having other real life people<br/>
to share experiences with, and my dd is warming up to the group too.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, one day I realized that I hadn&#39;t hooked up with my friend at the<br/>
school.  I sent her an email letting her know my schedule was pretty hectic<br/>
for the next month or so, and she let me know that we only need to meet<br/>
once a month and that she&#39;s very flexible.  Well, then it clicked... I was<br/>
very appreciative of her flexibility, liked her approach to find a way<br/>
around the system, etc... but I really didn&#39;t want to &quot;have&quot; to even do<br/>
that one meeting.  It&#39;s no surprise that I haven&#39;t turned in the paperwork;<br/>
I don&#39;t want to &quot;have&quot; to.<br/>
<br/>
Then as I was talking with my new friends, we were talking with one Mom in<br/>
the group whose dd wants to go to a local homeschooling &quot;school&quot; so she can<br/>
play with other kids, but that it was mostly the Mom&#39;s idea because she<br/>
wanted them to have the option to be able to take some of the neat classes<br/>
they had, and all of a sudden I heard my own notion...  I had wanted my dd<br/>
to be part of the school, but as a homeschooler, so that she could take<br/>
advantage of some of the stuff they have going on -- just in case.  My<br/>
notion didn&#39;t trust in life to present the options and the solutions when<br/>
we were ready.  I didn&#39;t really want to follow my own notion (hence the<br/>
paperwork sitting on the shelf), but it took my mind awhile to catch up.  I<br/>
don&#39;t know if I&#39;m expressing this very well, but all of a sudden I got a<br/>
new depth of the trust thing.  Whatever we might be needing in the future<br/>
will be taken care of... the options and solutions will be available.  If<br/>
we trust the process, then we will see what is available.  If we don&#39;t have<br/>
the trust, then we will not see -- we will be thinking to the future.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s really each and every moment that we need to do this.  When we have<br/>
something come up in one moment, it doesn&#39;t mean that it will be there in<br/>
the next moment.  New stuff happens, and the issues change.  Today isn&#39;t<br/>
anything like yesterday - not really.  This sounds so trite... but I think<br/>
YKWIM.<br/>
<br/>
I also see this playing out with the recent reading thread.  It&#39;s not that<br/>
we just need to trust that our kids will learn to read, or trust that they<br/>
will do it when they are ready.  We also need to bring it into the moment,<br/>
and then not hold on to it for the future.  For example, I&#39;ve noticed with<br/>
my dd that sometimes she asks me to help her learn to read, and she even<br/>
may express frustration that it hasn&#39;t happened yet.  So, we make up games<br/>
(index cards, word games, she&#39;s even asked me to buy a workbook.)  And she<br/>
has fun doing it in the moment that she&#39;s asked for it.  But then I try not<br/>
to hold on to her request as being something that she now wants me to do<br/>
forever.  When I let go of it (the request and any assumptions that I may<br/>
have had around it), then things work so well!  She usually wants to do<br/>
reading games once a month or so.  The rest of the time she is very happy<br/>
not being a reader.  It took me awhile to see this, but it was so easy to<br/>
see when I let go of yesterday&#39;s request.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, something else I thought recently.  I had no idea this list wasn&#39;t for<br/>
newbies - so I thank you all for being here and willing to listen to me and<br/>
to share your perspectives.<br/>
<br/>

A friend of mine put her kids in school and told them not to tell me.  They <br/>
accidently mentioned it to Holly and the mom kind of panicked.  <br/>
<br/>
She was intellectually prepared to understand unschooling, but she just <br/>
didn&#39;t let her breath out, y&#39;know?  She would do it if it worked before she ran out <br/>
of oxygen (or something), and she chickened out and put them in the Family <br/>
School here, which is a half-day program, but Holly said last night they&#39;re in <br/>
from 8:00 to 4:30 so I think they might be in a whole different deal.  4:30!?  <br/>
(She had a baby a week and a half ago, so if that was her real reason I <br/>
understand better.  Their house is always immaculately clean and very sparse.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m expressing this very well, but all of a sudden I got a<br/>
new depth of the trust thing.  Whatever we might be needing in the future<br/>
will be taken care of... the options and solutions will be available.  If<br/>
we trust the process, then we will see what is available. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is so sweet!<br/>
<br/>
Another level of that understanding comes when you&#39;re willing for not much to <br/>
be available, and then things crop up.  Or you see a crop of opportunities, <br/>
and your child&#39;s not too interested, and you really don&#39;t mind.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Oh, something else I thought recently.  I had no idea this list wasn&#39;t for<br/>
newbies - so I thank you all for being here and willing to listen to me and<br/>
to share your perspectives.-=-<br/>
<br/>
I wasn&#39;t the one who said it wasn&#39;t for newbie, and it&#39;s my list, but I <br/>
understood the intent of the statement.  This is more for people who really <br/>
understand unschooling or who are willing to try.   Though newcomers are welcome, it <br/>
wasn&#39;t set up to cater to people who had never heard of John Holt or were <br/>
going to say &quot;What do you mean, &#39;unschooling&#39;?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I really liked reading what you wrote and have stashed it for future use.  <br/>
Things in the archives of groups like this are there for a long time but <br/>
sometimes they&#39;re hard to search out.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I actually revel in that feeling now. I love it when something crops up <br/>
and the kids aren&#39;t interested and I can say to myself, &quot;Oh well - <br/>
another time, another place.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
It is calming. Meditative. Peaceful. Makes me feel like my head is <br/>
screwed on right! &lt;G&gt;<br/>
