<div id="ygrps-yiv-1679131114">Zachariah is 16.5 and has read his first chapter book(s).  He has been reading Japanese Manga for a few years and has always loved books with great pictures and captions under the pictures but would always say he was not capable of reading chapter books.  I had gotten the first book in a series called &quot;Eragon&quot; when if first came out several years ago before he &quot;found&quot; Japanese Manga.  He was not interested in Eragon nor any of the other books I&#39;d picked up for him and they went to the book shelf.  He eventually found a love for Japanese Manga and has spent the last couple of years reading tons of Manga.  Fast forward a few years and one night he picked up Eragon and began to read it.  He read that book and asked for the other two in the series, which we got him.  While reading this series he began to talk about what he would read next.  He chose Lord of The Rings as his next reading adventure - I ordered it and it is on it&#39;s way (along with several more Manga on his reading list).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
He is reading with pure joy - you can see it in his face!  It just simply radiates joy!  It is also evident in his enthusiastic discussions about what he is reading.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Side info: Zachariah was in a public Montessori school from age 3 to 8.5 (mid third grade).  We never did school at home, so he has been unschooled since age 8.5.  I don&#39;t think Zac ever really had to deschool - he has never said &quot;But how will I learn such and such?&quot;  I think he already knew he learned what he knew outside of school.  I&#39;m a public Montessori school teacher so I constantly have to &quot;let go&quot; and shift my thinking.  This list is vitally important in that process.  3 or 4 years ago  I was concerned that when Zac hit his teen years I would start to worry &quot;what about this or that&quot; and I would need help.   I searched for a good group to join and I found this one.  Y-E-A !!!!!!!!!!!!  Thank you Saundra and all the other contributing members that help me and my family along our life&#39;s unschooling journey.  Ed (dad), the stay at home parent, reads this list too.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1720933014">As an avid reader of fantasy fiction, I am happy to hear of Zachariah&#39;s foray into chapter books. It is wonderful that he enjoyed the Eragon series (the movie is pretty cool too), however in the fantasy genre there are books of far higher quality, eg.<br/>
<br/>
- Lord of the Rings, which you already mentioned. He may want to read The Hobbit first, just to get the story in chronological order. LOTR can be hard going at times, but oh so worth it!<br/>
<br/>
- The Thomas Covenant Series, by Stephen Donaldson<br/>
<br/>
- The Earthsea series, by Ursula K LeGuin (my all-time favourite)<br/>
<br/>
- various series by Michael Moorcock<br/>
<br/>
- the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett<br/>
<br/>
- His Dark Materials trilogy by Phillip Pullman (absolutely brilliant)<br/>
<br/>
And many more...<br/>
Go Zac!!<br/>

For older kids and adult Marion Zimmer Bradley is fantastic especially her darkover series but I also love her Avalon books to any star wars books are worth a read and there is a junior series in that also doctor who books are great as well<br/>

Britain but a few of her books are good for younger readers, particularly<br/>

its sequels. Many of her books are aimed at older teenagers or adults so not<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2016111926">My daughters, ages 5 and 6, adored The Realm by Emily Rodda, it is a 10 book<br/>
series about a magical realm. The main character is a little girl named<br/>
Jessie and a higher proportion of characters are female than male which is<br/>
not typical and I really appreicate. I have really enjoyed these stories too<br/>
where the main character goes into the magical realm and often helps solve<br/>
problems with common sense and thoughtful problem solving.<br/>
<br/>
We have also enjoyed:<br/>
Emily&#39;s Runaway Imagination by Beverly Cleary - funny and sweet also with a<br/>
female protagonist.<br/>
EB White&#39;s books - Stewart Little, The trumpet of the Swan,<br/>
The Little House on the Prairie books<br/>
Dragon Slippers (maybe for a little older than 4 - a few scary parts) also a<br/>
great strong female character and a great story<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has suggestions for books on faeries, strong female<br/>
characters, dragons we would Love to learn about more.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think virtually any good quality children&#39;s book can be a &#39;fantasy&#39; book as far as young kids are concerned. In addition to those recommended above (some of which are new to me and I&#39;m very grateful to hear of), I would say to check out your local Steiner/Waldorf store because they usually carry beautiful children&#39;s books, many with a fantasy theme. (Not that I am promoting Waldorf educational philosophies, just that their books and toys are so gorgeous).<br/>
<br/>
Some of my favourite children&#39;s books mix the fantastical and natural worlds, eg.<br/>
<br/>
Billywise, by Judith Nicholls<br/>
Magic Night, by Isobelle Carmody<br/>
works by Beatrix Potter<br/>
Uno&#39;s Garden, by Graeme Base<br/>
works by Eric Carle<br/>
and of course, Where the Wild Things Are, by Maurice Sendak<br/>
