<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; It is a TV station, we get it on satellite. I think it might be out of <br/>
&gt; Canada, but could be very wrong. Speaking of Canada, I have noticed that a <br/>
&gt; lot of programs Moly likes to watch come from there. She loves the station <br/>
&gt; Discovery Kids, and many (all?) programs on that station come from Canada. <br/>
&gt; Another show called The Worst Witch, airs on HBOF and it too comes from <br/>
&gt; Canada. My point? I guess that I really appreciate the quality programs for <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; kids that come from Canada, it seems like they take care in what they <br/>
&gt; produce <br/>
&gt; for children.<br/>

vicarious thrill of watching Degrassi Jr. High (Beth and I are too) and 24/7, <br/>
both about teens in school, one in Canada, one in England. Neither has any <br/>
impact on his wanting to go to school, but it&#39;s fun anyway. (They also run <br/>
Daria, which we all love.)<br/>
<br/>
Degrassi (it&#39;s a new one, based on the one that ran a while ago, with some <br/>
same characters) is interesting. They cover issues never done here in a cool <br/>
way, like teens and sexuality, etc. <br/>

We don&#39;t watch it too much in the evenings, (too many things for teens that <br/>
mine aren&#39;t interested in yet.) but we do like many of the programs.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-904815195">That&#39;s hilarious!!! I WONDERED what &#39;niggin&#39; was! When I signed on with our community food pantry, I was assigned the position of &#39;food pantry coordinator&#39;. So being the excited, anxious do/gooder that I am, I quickly jotted off an email to everyone on the list telling them that I was the new &#39; food panty coordinator&#39;. Yep! You read that right. I accidentally put &#39;panty&#39; instead of &#39;pantry&#39; and naturally spellcheck didn&#39;t pick it up! Of course, I didn&#39;t realize that I had done this until patrons starting coming in the library ( where I was the librarian) to ask if I was the new &#39;food panty coordinator&#39;! Don&#39;t you just LOVE those typos! Mary in Va.<br/>
