<div id="ygrps-yiv-1528384485">Thanks, Sandra, for your suggestions.  I know that if I am right  by them <br/>
when a fight starts I can usually smooth things out.  I know  some arguing is <br/>
normal in any family :)  As for Daniel (my 4 year old  warrior), we have always <br/>
had a lot of LOTR type movies around, as my other sons  and husband enjoy them, <br/>
and ones like Mortal Kombat, some Jet Li and  Pirates of the Caribbean.  He&#39;s <br/>
seen them all, and loves them.  He  also has several play swords and large <br/>
sticks that he has found for  staffs.  We watch the movies with him and talk <br/>
about what is going  on.  I think he wants very badly to be a great swordsman or <br/>
bowman or  whatever, and I think it drives him nuts that he can&#39;t do all the <br/>
things he  sees.  Do you have any suggestions (or anyone else for that matter) <br/>
as to  how to handle the times when he does say hurtful things to people?  His <br/>
 siblings ignore it as they know he is all talk, and I know they don&#39;t feel  <br/>
terrorized (annoyed, though), but the million other people we run into in  <br/>
grocery stores, at the playhouse, neighborhood kids, etc. think differently, I&#39;m  <br/>
sure.  I tell him that some words are hurtful or scary to others and that  we <br/>
need to respect personal space, and I have removed him from situations when  <br/>
he didn&#39;t seem to be able to stop.  I was considering replacing the violent  <br/>
movies with gentler ones whenever possible, and to ask the older kids to play  <br/>
more gently with him (the older boys like to rough house, and he always jumps  <br/>
in), but perhaps I&#39;ll forgo that.  We watched &quot;Karate Kid II&quot; today and  he <br/>
seemed to like it.  He&#39;s such a fun, great guy that I  hate to see him <br/>
alienating himself from others.  As for martial arts  classes, it just dawned on me <br/>
that I, along with his oldest brother, both got  our black belts last year, and <br/>
he went to tons of our classes and  observed.  I have an air shield here in a <br/>
closet (I stopped training last  March so it&#39;s probably dusty) - I think I&#39;ll <br/>
pull it out and offer for  him to pummel it :)<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks all,<br/>
Steph<br/>

 </span></blockquote>That might be one of those truisms that people repeat without really  <br/>
thinking about it, or without bothering to look for exceptions.<br/>
<br/>
Some arguing is normal, but what is even MORE normal (unfortunately)  <br/>
is parents leaving the kids unsupervised until the kids come to  <br/>
blows, break things, hurt each other, say mean things...<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do you have any suggestions (or anyone else for that matter)<br/>

people?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Be there more is my first thought.  Hurtful things hurt or they  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t call them &quot;hurtful.&quot;  Being all talk is still harmful.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I tell him that some words are hurtful or scary to others and  <br/>

need to respect personal space, and I have removed him from  <br/>
situations when<br/>
he didn&#39;t seem to be able to stop-=-<br/>
<br/>
Too may words, maybe.  I&#39;d say &quot;NO,&quot; and remove him and talk to him  <br/>
elsewhere.  I wouldn&#39;t let him go back or hang out with the other  <br/>
kids unless he agreed (at least temporarily) to stop.<br/>
<br/>
-=-He&#39;s such a fun, great guy that I  hate to see him<br/>
alienating himself from others.  -=-<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s the message he needs.  &quot;Other people won&#39;t like you.&quot;<br/>
Another message is that if older people do that they are arrested and  <br/>
locked up.  Little kids can have that pointed out to them.  It&#39;s  <br/>
absolutely true.<br/>
<br/>
Watching you or pummeling a shield isn&#39;t the same as the full package  <br/>
of learning a martial art himself.<br/>
