<h4>Ivalee Hackney</h4>
<time> 1 Oct 2010, at 10:48am</time>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-65845818">Hello everyone.  My name is Ivalee and I have a 22 month old son and a 6<br/>
 month old son.  I&#39;ve been a member of this group for several months now<br/>
 and have gained a lot of insight into unschooling and just a better way<br/>
 to interact with my children and people in general.  I don&#39;t have as <br/>
much time to read as I would like but am looking for some guidance to <br/>
starting out with younger children in regards to unschooling and just <br/>
dealing with the challenges that can come with the lack of communication<br/>
 at this age.  When I do attempt to find what I am looking for on <br/>
Sandra&#39;s site I can get so involved in reading other interesting topics <br/>
(that also often relate) that I get sidetracked and don&#39;t actually get <br/>
to the info I am seeking.  <br/>
<br/>
Before finding Unschooling I had <br/>
already won my husband over to the idea of Homeschooling.  The other day<br/>
 I mentioned Unschooling and wanting to do more research and find out <br/>
our state laws and he made it clear that he was not comfortable with <br/>
it.  I made a statement to him that, so far, according to our <br/>
pediatrician, our son seems quite advanced for his age and that, to <br/>
date, I&#39;ve not cracked a book or used any curriculum.  I decided to stop<br/>
 there and try some quiet research and approach him again with more <br/>
evidence at a later time.   <br/>
<br/>
What I am looking for assistance with is:<br/>
-  Where to find my state regulations surrounding Unschooling.  We live in Lakeland which is in the Central Florida area.<br/>
- <br/>
 Possible other Unschoolers near me.  (From my research I see a group in<br/>
 the Bradenton area which I am going to contact but they are about a two<br/>
 hour drive from us.)<br/>
-  How to communicate positively with a toddler<br/>
 in instances where he may hurt himself if I don&#39;t intervene, without <br/>
saying &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t.&quot;  (I try to redirect him mostly but would love <br/>
additional material to read for myself but also to pass on to my husband<br/>
 and mother.  Both of them seem to use No more and don&#39;t seem to realize<br/>
 how damaging it can be.  I want &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Stop&quot; to really mean something<br/>
 in a time when it might be necessary for safety rather than an everyday<br/>
 thing.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for the guidance.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It helps a whole lot to step away from the idea of telling or explaining with toddlers. Look and listen and learn to predict - learn to understand what he&#39;s already communicating and help him get his needs met before he&#39;s in the position of using less wonderful tactics like yelling or hitting. <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The trouble is, you can&#39;t *make* other people be more aware and proactive. The best you can do is set things up for as much success as possible. <br/>
<br/>
What kinds of situations are coming up? Playground stuff? Be right there with him, close enough, ready enough that if he slips you&#39;ve got him. Resist the urge to socialize with other adults when you have a busy, active child who needs one-on-one support, but realize other adults may not do the same. <br/>
<br/>
Is he getting into things at your mother&#39;s house, maybe? It might be better to stay away for awhile, only go over when you can stick to him like glue and help him explore and let him know what the perils and boundaries are. If grandam doesn&#39;t want her knick-knacks touched or furniture climbed on, respect that. That may mean asking grandma to meet you other places for awhile, so that your little guy can run around without hearing so many &quot;nos&quot; - be gentle and friendly and do the inviting &quot;come join us at...&quot; and maybe let grandma know that you want her to &quot;spoil&quot; him to her hearts content, and leave any &quot;discipline&quot; to you. <br/>
<br/>
All that being said, there&#39;s no special unschooling rule like &quot;never say no&quot; - sometimes &quot;no&quot; and &quot;don&#39;t&quot; are the best responses in the moment!<br/>

geared toward those of us with little kids who aren&#39;t &quot;school age&quot; yet.  I<br/>
have an 18 month old and a 4 month old, and I have been on these lists<br/>
already for a year -- there is a lot to learn!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2080494556">-=- I don&#39;t have as much time to read as I would like but am looking  <br/>
for some guidance to<br/>
starting out with younger children in regards to unschooling and just<br/>
dealing with the challenges that can come with the lack of communication<br/>
at this age. -=-<br/>
<br/>
How did you communicate with them before they could understand  <br/>
anything at all?  It&#39;s a continuum.  Mainly don&#39;t expect them to  <br/>
understand things they can&#39;t understand yet (developmentally or  <br/>
linguistically) any more than you would expect a baby to.<br/>
<br/>
-=-When I do attempt to find what I am looking for on<br/>
Sandra&#39;s site I can get so involved in reading other interesting topics<br/>
(that also often relate) that I get sidetracked and don&#39;t actually get<br/>
to the info I am seeking. -=-<br/>
<br/>
But that&#39;s good.  That&#39;s how natural learning works.<br/>
I used to have a really hard time looking something up in the  <br/>
dictionary without reading for fifteen minutes and getting on some  <br/>
wholly different tangent and forgetting what i picked the dictionary  <br/>
up for in the first place.  Especially dictionaries with  <br/>
illustrations.  With google, I can search for the word and  <br/>
&quot;definition&quot; and not see anything except that.  I kind of miss the  <br/>
paper dictionary, sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
When unschooling gets going, your child will learn that same way--not  <br/>
linearly.  Swirlingly. :0)<br/>
<br/>
-=-I made a statement to him that, so far, according to our<br/>
pediatrician, our son seems quite advanced for his age and that, to<br/>
date, I&#39;ve not cracked a book or used any curriculum. I decided to stop<br/>
there and try some quiet research and approach him again with more<br/>
evidence at a later time. -=-<br/>

in instances where he may hurt himself if I don&#39;t intervene, without<br/>
saying &quot;No&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t.&quot; (I try to redirect him mostly but would love<br/>
additional material to read for myself but also to pass on to my husband<br/>

thing.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t try to train your mother or husband any more than you train your  <br/>
child.  First, see the evidence for yourself in your own child, and  <br/>
then point that evidence out to them gradually.<br/>
<br/>
You could say to the toddler, &quot;Hey, are you trying to get that open?&quot;  <br/>
and then if it&#39;s a safe thing to open, say &quot;Can I help you?&quot; or &quot;It  <br/>
has a latch--look.  Lift this thing up.&quot;  Or if it&#39;s not safe to open,  <br/>
you could explain why, but find something similarly interesting that  <br/>
he CAN open.   See it as curiosity and learning.<br/>
<br/>
If learning is your primary goal, and if you are your child&#39;s learning  <br/>
partner, then the &quot;yes&quot; is &quot;Yes I&#39;ll help you if I can,&quot; not &quot;Yes, do  <br/>
whatever you want.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
If a child is walking ahead of you and there&#39;s a street or parking  <br/>
lot, you could say &quot;Wait for me.&quot;  That&#39;s what we say to our dog,  <br/>
actually.  We don&#39;t have to say it to the kids.  Our dog stops on  <br/>
&quot;wait for me&quot; and goes on &quot;okay, let&#39;s go.&quot;  We didn&#39;t &quot;train her&quot; but  <br/>
we did it consistently and she figured it out, because it made sense,  <br/>
and she was getting to do what she wanted to do, which was be with us  <br/>
and everybody being calm and happy.   Kids want that too.  They want  <br/>
to be able to explore the world in the company of calm, happy  people  <br/>
who know more about it than they do.<br/>
