Hi Sandra,<br/>
<br/>
I just wanted to let you know that the unschooling article is up  <br/>
today our Web site at www.edweek.org.<br/>
<br/>
You will have to register for the site, which will allow you to read  <br/>
two articles for free. The unschooling story also has an audio  <br/>
interview I did with a local unschooling mom.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for your input. I really enjoyed talking with you. One  <br/>
of the moms quoted in the story (Jane Powell) was so excited that I  <br/>
had interviewed you. She called you the &quot;mother&quot; of unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
Michelle<br/>

Snow cake.<br/>
<br/>
Sadie&#39;s birthday cake, with sparkler candles.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s made of snow, packed on top of a cable spool.  Kirby made it.   <br/>
It was yellow and blue (he sprayed food coloring and water) but then  <br/>
before she could come over, it was snowed on some more.  It looked  <br/>
more pale green.<br/>

<br/>
It snows in NM?? <br/>
<br/>
Here i am in Michigan, *michigan* for pete&#39;s sake, we are practically <br/>
Canada, Christmas is just in a few days.<br/>
<br/>
We have no snow. <br/>
<br/>
Not even a light dusting of snow. Nope, its bright and sunny, in the <br/>
high 40s. Supposed to be sunny all weekend, getting down to the high <br/>
30s by Monday. And no snow expected. <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not complaining, i hate driving in the snow, but still. Really <br/>
weird.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-911870799">Well, they killed off one of your kids. I&#39;m not sure who, but you are down <br/>
to 2 now. Kirby is still there, taking his math class at TVI, but either <br/>
Holly or Marty have disappeared. I&#39;m really sorry.<br/>
<br/>
Alfie Kohn concludes by saying: &quot;there&#39;s no question that unschooling leaves <br/>
behind most of the bad stuff in a lot of schools. The question is whether <br/>
some good stuff or potential good stuff is missing.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And of course the answer is yes, potential good stuff is missing. But that&#39;s <br/>
okay, potential good stuff is missing from everybody&#39;s life. It is a funny <br/>
notion that any educational philosophy, or any life approach, should lead to <br/>
a life inclusive of everything. But, I suppose, if that is the worst thing <br/>
in the article, that and the horrible disappearance of one of your <br/>
children...<br/>
<br/>
Actually it starts off in the way all of these articles tend to start off, <br/>
with a normal school morning being described and a family not rising for the <br/>
bus. And moving into a day without teachers and students but one described <br/>
as following the &quot;philosophy of letting the child decide each day what <br/>
activities to pursue-or avoid.&quot; Even if it is apt, it isn&#39;t how I would <br/>
describe our lives or my philosophical approach to life. It hasn&#39;t any of <br/>
the beauty or the wonder that I associate with unschooling. Maybe that is <br/>
the problem with all of these articles and the Dr. Phil show there is an <br/>
aspect of oddity watching that is going on. And they never really talk up <br/>
the wonderfulness that this freak show incorporates.<br/>
<br/>
There is a section with the heading Risks Involved that begins with Nel <br/>
Noddings (I love that name!), education prof. emeritus at Stanford (&#39;cause <br/>
that is important!) saying that learning deficits can result from letting <br/>
children learn what they want. As if children who are forced to learn what <br/>
they don&#39;t want are the acme of knowledge and have no gaps in their <br/>
understanding of whatever it is one must understand to be declared <br/>
edumacated. Linnaea knows that she likes eating reeces peanut butter cups <br/>
upside down at 6! I have no idea where she can go from there, but it can&#39;t <br/>
be anything but good. And Pat Farenga chimes in with his line &quot;I define <br/>
unschooling as allowing children as much freedom to explore the world as you <br/>
can comfortably bear.&quot; Which is great in that it increases the number of <br/>
unschoolers by so many times that it becomes hard to distinguish unschoolers <br/>
from anyone else. I mean many parents of schooled children, I imagine, could <br/>
not comfortably bear allowing their children the freedom to stay home from <br/>
school, and so become unschoolers within the framework Mr. Farenga sets out.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know, the article is all over the board. I don&#39;t think the author <br/>
had a clear sense of what she wanted it to be. And it comes across as many <br/>
of the other articles do, a sort of look at the difference, but don&#39;t go <br/>
there &#39;cause it could be too dangerous. Nel Noddings (of Stanford) does say <br/>
that unschoolers may be our saviors: &quot;Perhaps these kids may help the world <br/>
be a less miserable and less structured place,&quot; she said. &quot;Perhaps they&#39;ll <br/>
have something to say against the overly bureaucratic system we have now.&quot; <br/>
So there is that.<br/>

Yeah, I&#39;m thinking the same, in MN.  We do have about an inch on the ground (around our yard)  but only because its so shaded.  30&#39;s and 40&#39;s here lately too.  I&#39;m about 90 minutes from Canada,,<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So I was trying to think of how I&#39;d like it to be written. What I think <br/>
ought to be encapsulated in an article about unschooling and I thought about <br/>
the choice that Robert Frost wrote in The Road Not Taken:<br/>
<br/>
      Robert Frost (1874-1963).  Mountain Interval.  1920.<br/>
<br/>
      1. The Road Not Taken<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            TWO roads diverged in a yellow wood,<br/>
            And sorry I could not travel both<br/>
            And be one traveler, long I stood<br/>
            And looked down one as far as I could<br/>
            To where it bent in the undergrowth;<br/>
<br/>
            Then took the other, as just as fair,<br/>
            And having perhaps the better claim,<br/>
            Because it was grassy and wanted wear;<br/>
            Though as for that the passing there<br/>
            Had worn them really about the same,<br/>
<br/>
            And both that morning equally lay<br/>
            In leaves no step had trodden black.<br/>
            Oh, I kept the first for another day!<br/>
            Yet knowing how way leads on to way,<br/>
            I doubted if I should ever come back.<br/>
<br/>
            I shall be telling this with a sigh<br/>
            Somewhere ages and ages hence:<br/>
            Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-<br/>
            I took the one less traveled by,<br/>
            And that has made all the difference.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And that is what I want the dichotomy that Michelle R. Davis is depicting of <br/>
unschooling versus any sort of schooling to look like. A gentle turning off <br/>
the path with way leading on to way which makes all the difference.<br/>

Maryland Home Ed. Assoc. and one of the largest umbrella schools here in <br/>
Maryland, about how unschooling basically equals negligence on the part <br/>
of the parents. Manfred puts together the statewide homeschooling <br/>
conference and has been marginalizing any unschooling presence more and <br/>
more each year. We still don&#39;t know if we&#39;ll even get to present a <br/>
basic, nuts and bolts panel at this year&#39;s conference in April.<br/>
<br/>
I was dismayed by his comment, but not surprised. He&#39;s included in the <br/>
article, I&#39;m sure, because Jane Powell&#39;s in Maryland, too.<br/>
<br/>
****&quot;Manfred Smith, the president of the Maryland Home Education <br/>
Association, based in Columbia, Md., said members of his organization <br/>
once considered themselves unschoolers. &quot;It meant we were not going to <br/>
replicate a traditional school-like focus on curriculum and text,&quot; he <br/>
said. &quot;We wanted to focus on the needs and interests of our children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
But Mr. Smith said his group stopped using the term unschooling when it <br/>
concluded the word had become tainted. &quot;You have people claiming to be <br/>
unschoolers, providing minimal or no supervision,&quot; he said. &quot;Unschooling <br/>
can be this great rationalization or outright excuse not to make an <br/>
effort.&quot;&quot;****<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-917847173">-=-It snows in NM?? -=-<br/>
<br/>
We usually get two or three small snows, one of them enough for a  <br/>
snowman, maybe.  Last summer it rained and rained many inches and now  <br/>
we got deep snow.  It&#39;s exceptional, not normal. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My sister lives near Chama, in the central NWish part near Colorado  <br/>
and they always get lots of snow.  Then in the SW part near Arizona  <br/>
and Mexico, they get way less.  Anywhere in mountains they get snow  <br/>
every year.  Even in southern New Mexico there are high mountains and  <br/>
the elevation starts at about a mile in the Rio Grande Valley and  <br/>
goes up from there.  So elevation wise, New Mexico is high and  <br/>
higher.  That helps.  We&#39;re closer to the cold of outer space than  <br/>
Minnesota is.<br/>

Quantity over quality.  Numbers are all, it seems, to too many people.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m having a really nice week, after last week&#39;s pressure fest, and I  <br/>
have this problem (not a problem this week, but a problem that  <br/>
strikes without warning):  I get a phone call from someone who wants  <br/>
to interview me.  I can say no or I can talk.  If I say no, they  <br/>
might interview someone who knows less or isn&#39;t careful.  If I say  <br/>
yes, I&#39;m almost surely spend an hour or more futilely trying to  <br/>
explain unschooling to someone who thinks she already understands  <br/>
it.  Then the mischaracterization goes out to the world.<br/>
<br/>
Ugh.  Lots of times.  Maybe that&#39;s why Pat Farenga made a stock  <br/>

Christmas.=-<br/>
<br/>
I didn&#39;t put tic-marks on the wall, but I *think* that since I&#39;ve  <br/>
been in New Mexico (1959 or so?) I&#39;ve seen two white Christmasses.   <br/>
Maybe three.  And this snow probably won&#39;t last until Christmas, even  <br/>
though it&#39;s supposed to snow again Saturday, maybe.  Once the sun  <br/>
comes out, buh-bye.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen snow evaporate without even getting the ground wet where it  <br/>
was.  Snow itself isn&#39;t necessarily humid.  This stuff was extra  <br/>
fluffy and when I boiled it down it was (I said on the blog so I&#39;m  <br/>
repeating myself for some people, sorry) 1/4 inch of water from 6.5  <br/>
inches of snow.   I didn&#39;t try to compact it and see what the  <br/>
difference of boiled down snowball-stuff would be.  But the sun  <br/>
hasn&#39;t shone on it.  It&#39;s not too late to be scientific.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve seen more than two snowy Halloweens and more than two snowy  <br/>
Easters.  Maybe we&#39;ll have a snowy Christmas, and it *would* be the  <br/>
first Christmas that I didn&#39;t even get a tree, or fake one with  <br/>
lights.    I have already declared to my family than next year I am  <br/>
having a tree, a Christmas party, and NOT (not) performing at any  <br/>
tearoom for store credit and money.  Not at all.<br/>
<br/>
Holly proposed no stockings this year.  She asked me to ask the  <br/>
boys.  Marty balked so much I was afraid to ask Kirby.  Holly is too  <br/>
much like Keith for the rest of  us (and Marty&#39;s nearly a clone of  <br/>
Keith).  She&#39;s just too practical. &lt;G&gt;<br/>

unschooling, one would think he would be, given his great ideas on  <br/>
unconditional parenting.  Has anyone here seen Alfie Kohn&#39;s DVD?   <br/>
It&#39;s a fabulous way to show folks what&#39;s wrong with punishments and  <br/>
rewards.<br/>

   <br/>
  While the article was not perfect, it was, perhaps in its basic form, another person&#39;s attempt to get a grasp of what takes some of us (and I&#39;m waving my hand madly!!) a consdierable amount of time to really grasp.  Its author is, like many others, a member of the public school community (the publication is national, but based here in MD).  The fact that she showed a real interest and a want to understand what u/s&#39;ing is touched me.  She said that she began to reflect on her own educational experiences and how she wants her children to learn, etc. as she did her research and as she spoke with me (hers are small as well).  She also said that unschooling made sense to her.  Maybe the kind path here is to see that this article may have set one person along the path to question a life with greater freedom for their children.  The photographer who came to our home was also moved by what she saw here.  She doesn&#39;t have small people, but you could tell what she saw got her<br/>
 thinking.  <br/>
   <br/>
  Imo, the taped interview with me is a much better reflection of unschooling (or so I hope).  <br/>
   <br/>
  I was **floored** by Mr. Smith&#39;s remarks.  He runs a conference in MD every April and in a class I attended identified himself as an unschooler.  I&#39;m not sure what went awry...  <br/>
   <br/>
  Fwiw, I feel compelled to mention that &quot;allowance&quot; is not part of our life.  This was Michelle&#39;s addition.  It was also her addition to mention that &quot;the tribe&quot; calculates tips at restaurants.  We frequent joints that ask if you&#39;d like a combo or fries with that.  Restaurants don&#39;t fit us.  Moreover, asking them to figure a tip sounds too teachy to me and something I would not do.  <br/>
<br/>
  Maybe I&#39;m just noticing more, but is unschooling in the news more lately or is it just me??  It seems that it began with the People magazine article with Ren and has continued on and on and on!!  If nothing else, perhaps it&#39;s not such a bad thing that the word of another path is getting out into the masses more.  I know I would have welcomed a tidbit as I searched for a path which fit us!!  <br/>

In April 1975 too, when I was born, and I am further south where we get even less snow.  The other morning there was about a quarter of an inch of snow in my yard before the sun came up, I got all excited and woke Richard.   He said &quot;cool&quot; and went back to sleep.  &lt;g&gt;  It was gone when he got up.  It is warm enough to be out in short sleeves today, but I could drive less than an hour and be in 10 inches of snow.  I love that about New Mexico.<br/>

parents&#39; fault for having a bad attitude about school and not telling  <br/>
the kids all the time how great and important school is.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve heard parents blamed by teachers LOTS Lots lots.<br/>
<br/>
Some of Lindsey Lohan&#39;s e-mail was published, and it involved her  <br/>
saying that she was influential and an inspiration to generations  <br/>
younger and generations older than she is (and going on to complain  <br/>
about press unfairness and vague other things).  One journalist  <br/>
commented that she wasn&#39;t going to inspire people to homeschool their  <br/>
children as her parents had homeschooled her.   They said that  <br/>
because of some misspellings.<br/>
<br/>
My husband went to school K-12 and then college, and he can&#39;t spell  <br/>
as well as Lindsey Lohan.  He writes more coherently, but he&#39;s been  <br/>
doing it a long, long time.  Holly spells really well.  Marty cares  <br/>
about his spelling and asks.  Kirby doesn&#39;t care and doesn&#39;t ask and  <br/>
he&#39;s not that great a speller.  But how did he learn to spell the  <br/>
words he DOES spell correctly?  He just picked up tricks and visual  <br/>
recognition here and there.  Same as Holly, but she has the kind of  <br/>
mental organization and abilities (whatever-all those might be) to  <br/>
remember more of whatever she uses to spell words.<br/>
<br/>
When people jump on a homeschooled person and say &quot;SEE?  Doesn&#39;t know  <br/>
when the Battle of Waterloo was!&quot; they don&#39;t even think about how  <br/>
many schooled kids don&#39;t know AND wouldn&#39;t want to hear another word  <br/>
about it, whereas someone not beat down and traumatized by memorizing  <br/>
names and dates in history classes might say &quot;Oh, that&#39;s cool!  I  <br/>
didn&#39;t know that,&quot; and then tie several bits of information to the  <br/>
story once it&#39;s been sketched out for them.  My kids might tie it to  <br/>
Black Adder: Back and Forth, with the time travel, the Wellingtons  <br/>
and the loss of England to the French (in that Black Adder TV special  <br/>
which was shown in 1999, and involved a New Year&#39;s Eve party on the  <br/>
eve of 2000, and Colin Firth plays Shakespeare).<br/>

Not only kids who move from school to school miss whole chunks of  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Or, I often hear it described, a foundation. It is, supposedly, the  <br/>
set of information that anyone can build on to become anything they  <br/>
want to be.<br/>
<br/>
Even educators realize no one will need all of the information for  <br/>
the foundation. Most will build up just a portion of it. (Ideally,  <br/>
anyway. People who avoid touching the foundation stuff because their  <br/>
school experience getting it into them has washed over and tainted  <br/>
the poor innocent information aren&#39;t acknowledged. Or, if they are,  <br/>
they&#39;re blamed for having a bad attitude.)<br/>
<br/>
The reason to give everyone the same foundation is because, as Sandra  <br/>
said, schools use a factory model. The goal is to create a uniform  <br/>
product that can then mold itself and build up from some of the parts  <br/>
it&#39;s been given. Sort of like pouring in a whole grocery store even  <br/>
though no one uses more than a small portion of the stuff that&#39;s there.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s justified, though, by calling it a well-rounded education.  <br/>
Unless the whole grocery store is poured in, there will be gaps, it&#39;s  <br/>
feared.<br/>
<br/>
But unschoolers look at it differently. We know that we don&#39;t need  <br/>
the whole grocery store. We just need to a general knowledge of  <br/>
what&#39;s there and how to find it if we need it, and what to do if we  <br/>
encounter new things.<br/>

from a beginning Christmas book.  I had picked something for having a  <br/>
small range and being in 4/4 time.  What I didn&#39;t notice was that it  <br/>
was in the key of G (so there were F sharps).<br/>
<br/>
He was fine.  I drew a diagonal pencil line through each F and he  <br/>
went for it.  It was slow, but it was real.  &quot;O Come All Ye Faithful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And in the conversation about sharps and flats and different keys  <br/>
(with me playing scales and telling him no matter what note you start  <br/>
on it&#39;s possible to play a major scale (do re me so... like in Sound  <br/>
of Music, which he got immediately).  He said, &quot;So that&#39;s why it&#39;s  <br/>
funny on the Simpsons that their group was called the &#39;B Sharps&#39;  <br/>
because there&#39;s no B sharp?&quot;   Kinda yeah, but I told him every note  <br/>
has a sharp and every note has a flat, because it&#39;s the concept of  <br/>
half-a-step up or down.   But yeah, B Sharp is a double joke.  And  <br/>
then it was one he got doubly.<br/>
<br/>
It doesn&#39;t matter that he did that when he was 20 instead of when he  <br/>
was five or ten years old.  My friend Jeff won&#39;t sing in public, even  <br/>
though he&#39;s good, because he was traumatized by piano recitals when  <br/>
he was little.  Kirby will sing and sing without hesitation. &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1162599520">Recently, I&#39;ve returned to programming after a long<br/>
absence and in that effort, I rejoined a programming<br/>
user list not too different than this one with the<br/>
obvious difference that we discuss programming instead<br/>
of unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
What struck me this time around is that when inquirers<br/>
write to the list asking for detailed help in doing<br/>
what they want to do, most of the time the gurus<br/>
respond, &#39;You don&#39;t want to do that&#39;, &quot;Bad idea, don&#39;t<br/>
do that&#39; or &#39;Why would you want to do THAT?&#39;, &#39;Better<br/>
to do this instead,&#39; etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Sound familiar?<br/>
<br/>
But on that list, the inquirers don&#39;t respond<br/>
defensively or emotionally or criticize the responding<br/>
guru.  They  provide more info, they ask questions,<br/>
they accept the advice of the guru, turn their<br/>
thoughts around, go off in a new direction, and<br/>
express a lot of gratititude for all the free help.<br/>
<br/>
What a contrast to unschooling lists!  <br/>
<br/>
My initial thoughts are that this stems from a belief<br/>
system that everyone&#39;s ideas about parenting should be<br/>
considered equally valid while that notion becomes<br/>
absurd when applied to programming.  And, as a result,<br/>
it blocks some from becoming better parents.  What a<br/>
sad, damaging belief system.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d be interested in hearing other reactions.<br/>

deffensive because you are much more invested in it.<br/>
