<div id="ygrps-yiv-1828215332">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Everybody is very aware that we are unschoolers<br/>
and I have made several friends with the more<br/>
eclectic, semi-structured families.  Last week, I had<br/>
a brainstorm.  The newsletter is always advertising<br/>
classes.  I advertised &quot;recess&quot;.  I described it as a<br/>
free-form, free-play, multi-age activity so the kids<br/>
could just spend time with their friends.  The<br/>
newsletter doesn&#39;t come out for a couple of weeks, so<br/>
we will see if I get any response.<br/>

What a great idea! Can I borrow it? I have just made a<br/>
flyer to attract other unschoolers to our park day. I<br/>
would like to incorporate some of what you said into<br/>
it, if I may.<br/>
