<div id="ygrps-yiv-1581213626">Hi everyone! My name is JoAnn and my husband Jorry and I have 5 girls. They are 14,11,5,3 and 1. We currently live in Indiana and have been unschooling for 7years now. Prior to fully unschooling we were really relaxed and eventually moved to complete freedom.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m looking forward to participating in the group.<br/>
