<div id="ygrps-yiv-1049670934">I haven&#39;t read this whole thread yet, bit this comment from Sandra was true for my oldest 2 daughters. It wasn&#39;t that home wasn&#39;t comfy or happy or that they were rebellious.. they just wanted more I guess, both of them moved out at 17 and almost 18. They didn&#39;t go far and come home often to visit and are calling me almost everyday. I was always being warned from relatives, about rebellion and how bad age 13 would be for girls... well that was a bunch of bull.. ha... my youngest is almost 13 and she is my best bud! My oldest dd is a mama now too!  I think it&#39;s pretty cool that they had that confidence to step out into the world and are doing well. I on the other hand left home in a major funk... totally upset with my parents and didn&#39;t repair that relationship, esp with my dad for yrs. This has been so different, even tho I wish they would have stayed around longer. Julie in MO<br/>
