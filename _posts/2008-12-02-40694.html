<div id="ygrps-yiv-297910399">5. It doesn&#39;t matter when something is learned. It is perfectly all  <br/>
right for a person to learn all about dinosaurs when they are 40  <br/>
years old, they don&#39;t have to learn it when they are nine. It is  <br/>
perfectly all right to learn to do long division at 16 years old,  <br/>
they do not have to learn that at nine, either. It does not get more  <br/>
difficult to learn most things later; it gets easier.<br/>
