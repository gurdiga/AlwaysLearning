<div id="ygrps-yiv-2040934107">Ok I have to ask whether it&#39;s me or am I sane... I have noticed that a<br/>
lot of movies that are supposedly kids movies sexualize women in them or<br/>
have some sexual theme underlying.  Here&#39;s an example:  Stuart Little<br/>
2.. Mouse in love with Margolo the bird.  Scooby Doo - Daphne showing<br/>
big b**bs off to us all and Fred..  101 Dalmations (2) the animated one<br/>
- the female dogs are lusting over the hero dog that one of the<br/>
dalmation goes to see.. I have countless others that hubby and I have<br/>
noticed.  Now I&#39;m not a prude, in fact far from it.  Coming from England<br/>
I grew up with much more of an open mind about sex, seeing nudity and<br/>
foul language on British Television was something that I did see (not<br/>
children&#39;s shows though)..I guess I&#39;m just trying to understand the<br/>
reason there are underlying sexual references in kids movies.  Maybe<br/>
it&#39;s for the kids that go to school.  The reason I say that is that the<br/>
boy that lives next door to us is the same age as Zak (nearly 8) and a<br/>
couple of days ago I heard him outside talking to some older kids about<br/>
a girl he&#39;s going to date and he wants to kiss and spend time with (he<br/>
goes to a public school) whereas Zak has no idea what this boy is<br/>
talking about... ok enough ranting from me.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2000630814">I recall Stuart and Margolo having an affection for one another in the original book upon which the movies are based.  I haven&#39;t seen the #2 movie though.<br/>
<br/>
In Tuck Everlasting (book) the main character is 10 or 11 and has a crush on Jesse.  In the movie, she is portrayed as a teen, but I&#39;ve only seen the previews.  The book was definitely not a love story in the romantic sense though.  BTW, we enjoyed reading the book.  Another by the same author is Search for Delicious.<br/>
<br/>
I tend to get annoyed at changes that are made from book to movie, but it gives the kids and I a lot to talk about if we have read the book and seen the movie.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, Disney films often have a love story and/or sexual tones.  The entertainment industry is heavy on sex and violence.  I don&#39;t think they do it just for kids who go to school though.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1980841385">Sandra:  before I disagree can you clarify your statement.  I just asked<br/>
my husband if when we talk we talk a lot about sex and violence and we<br/>
don&#39;t.  So I&#39;m not sure about what you mean.  Then I thought of Jack and<br/>
the Beanstalk and Rumplestilskin and thought about the violence in that<br/>
so wasn&#39;t sure if that&#39;s what you mean.  My kids have also seen very few<br/>
commercials as they watch PBS.  Maybe when they get older they&#39;ll watch<br/>
more.  It just seems that 3-9 is a young age to have sexual themes<br/>
shoved down your throat for no apparent reason.  Unless it&#39;s that the<br/>
Disney people know that the parents are going to the movies and they<br/>
want to keep them interested and the only way to keep people interested<br/>
is talking about Sex.... I guess that would make sense for those<br/>
uncomfortable with sex or people who have the need to hear sexual<br/>
references.<br/>

<br/>
Kids that age ignore the sexuality completely.  Either they gloss over it, <br/>
they don&#39;t perceive it,  or they look away during kissing.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Those aren&#39;t the only choices.<br/>
<br/>
Story telling, ballads, fairy tales, dramatic productions, poems, are OFTEN <br/>
about love or sex or violence.  Have been since the greeks, probably earlier <br/>
than that.<br/>
<br/>
What you and your husband talk about is probably kids and yards and cars, <br/>
jobs, politics, and whether to get the oven knob repaired.  (Well, that&#39;s MY <br/>
house this week.)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree with this and yes it does seem that every movie or tv show made for<br/>
kids has to have some kind of boyfriend/girlfriend theme now. Dh and I have<br/>
often groaned about it as yet again it&#39;s crammed down their throat that<br/>
they &quot;should&quot; be dating at age 8! I think Disney is one of the worst<br/>
offenders  but I don&#39;t like the company as it is.<br/>
Society in general though pushes kids to grow up so quickly. We have had so<br/>
many people say things like &quot;do you have a girlfriend?&quot; to our boys -- and<br/>
that was even before they turned 10 or so! The pressure to date is really<br/>
pushed by as young as 3rd grade now which is no surprise when sex has been<br/>
in all their viewing since preschool.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Well looking away or not acknowledging doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t have an<br/>
effect on them. The message is still going in. And by looking away it can<br/>
mean they are uncomfortable with it as they are trying to tune out issues<br/>
that may be too stimulating for them.<br/>

human nature ever been non sexual or non violent.I do<br/>
believe that modern presentations have allowed for the<br/>
stories to be portrayed with more intense images though.<br/>
