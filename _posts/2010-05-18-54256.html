<div id="ygrps-yiv-58302284">My kids and I are going fishing tomorrow (hurray for unschooling!)<br/>
Last night in bed with my husband discussing our plans, I said,<br/>
<br/>
&quot;I want to prepare them for getting up early Wednesday, so tomorrow (Tuesday) I will get them up early.  I think I give their doors a knock at about 9am.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
He looked at me like I was off my rocker with my definition of what is &quot;early.&quot;  Oh well, this is our life.  I love it.<br/>
<br/>
Valete! (good-bye in Latin)<br/>
