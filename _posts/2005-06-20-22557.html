<div id="ygrps-yiv-1219885670">Hey!! We live in Benson,AZ, and are friends with Heather. you all come visit us when you go to the caves, which are only 10 minutes from our house. How fun that would be!<br/>
We don&#39;t have a &quot;real&quot; pool, but one of those 15 ft. round ones that is 4 ft. deep. It is good for cooling off, though. And our house is cool too....<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d like to extend a welcome to anyone travelling our way. There&#39;s plenty of room on our 5 acres for an RV. And electric and water too. Or, stay in our RV. We travelled around in that for 5 months, with the 4 of us. It would sleep 5 for a short while too.<br/>
