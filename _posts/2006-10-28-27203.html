<br/>
If you&#39;re doing any &quot;actual schoolwork,&quot; you&#39;re not unschooling and  <br/>
this is entirely an unschooling list.<br/>
<br/>
You might want to switch to unschooling!  Here&#39;s lots of information  <br/>
for you if you&#39;d like to consider a change:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/help">http://sandradodd.com/help</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-. We also<br/>
homeschool year around so we take a day off or so when others are in<br/>
school. -=-<br/>
<br/>
If you were unschooling, all your days would be learning days--no  <br/>
school days, no days off. Just a life rich in input and questions and  <br/>
new connections.<br/>
<br/>
-=-it scares me to the<br/>
point that I wonder if homeschooling is worth it. -=<br/>
<br/>
Get your confidence up by truly understanding how learning works, or  <br/>
put your kids in school.<br/>
<br/>
If putting your kids in school seems like a bad idea, you might want  <br/>
to consider unschooling.  (see above)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Will I feel more secure if i joined<br/>
HSLDA? -=-<br/>
<br/>
It depends how much you LIKE being  &quot;paranoid homeschooling mom.&quot;   <br/>
They can extend that feeling for years, for a fee.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-Does anyone else<br/>
feel this way? How do you handle it when your child goes outside into<br/>
the backward to do some &quot;recess&quot;? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Back yard?  (I don&#39;t think you meant &quot;outside into the backward.&quot;)<br/>
<br/>
We don&#39;t have &quot;recess&quot; because my kids have always been unschooled.<br/>
<br/>
Take your kids to a park, the zoo, a mall.  BE OUT.  Don&#39;t limit them  <br/>
to your backward back yard.<br/>
<br/>
If you have a hostile ex husband or critical in-laws, school might be  <br/>
easier.<br/>
If you  have a good marriage and our husband is your child&#39;s father  <br/>
and your in-laws trust you, I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re afraid of.<br/>

If you&#39;ve personally had some &quot;borderline&quot; encounters<br/>
or if you know of local problems that&#39;s one thing, but<br/>
getting upset about stuff you read online or in<br/>

I love philosophically pure unschooling, but too many people seem to  <br/>
be risking intact family, which risks (rather destroys) their chance  <br/>
for even compromised half-assed unschooling!<br/>
<br/>
They can convince the dads and then they have have philosophically  <br/>

speak articulately about education and what we&#39;re doing. Your best  <br/>
plan is to be knowledgeable - read a lot about learning so that  <br/>
you&#39;ll be confident just in case you ever have to speak to any  <br/>
authorities. BUT - why would you? I&#39;ve even put myself IN a position  <br/>
to speak to authorities and never had a problem. I once sat at a  <br/>
banquet at a table with the principals of the schools in our area  <br/>
including even the chairwoman of the SARB (school attendance review  <br/>
board). I talked about homeschooling and explained our state law to  <br/>
them and conversed throughout the meal with them about learning and  <br/>
education and even offered them some ideas of how some of what  <br/>
homeschoolers do so well could be incorporated into schools.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; How do you handle it when your child goes outside into<br/>
&gt; the backward to do some &quot;recess&quot;?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yikes. Recess? My kids&#39; entire life would be considered recess, by  <br/>
schooled kids. And they don&#39;t just go into the backyard - they go  <br/>
outside and in parks and museums and MacDonalds Play Places and the  <br/>
beach and skate rinks and on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Please don&#39;t keep them home and locked up during school hours. You SO  <br/>
do not need to do that, no matter where you live!<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Will I feel more secure if i joined  HSLDA?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>You&#39;ll feel a lot more secure if you forget HSLDA exists. Don&#39;t read  <br/>
their alerts - they write in grandiose and frightening language and  <br/>
exaggerate everything and make it sound like the government is out to  <br/>
get us. They scare people needlessly.<br/>
<br/>
Do you know your state laws? Then follow them and be confident.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve homeschooled for 12 years. I was on the board of my state  <br/>
organization - the only problems people run into are because of  <br/>
custody issues or because they took kids out of school during an pre- <br/>
existing dispute with the school.<br/>

have rarely been asked questions when we are out (usually its along <br/>
