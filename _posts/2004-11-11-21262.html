<div id="ygrps-yiv-1427117431">Someone I know is being threatened by family services saying that <br/>
their 9 year old needs to be medicated for ADHD! Trying to say that <br/>
the child will be put on medications or they will remove the child <br/>
from the home as being neglected. They started homeschooling last <br/>
year because they didn&#39;t want to put him on meds and they were tired <br/>
of defending their position to the school, so the mom decided to buy <br/>
a curriculum and homeschool him of which he is excelling at! The <br/>
father is a former meth addict, an addiction that he belives was <br/>
caused by having been medicated with stimulants for his supposed <br/>
ADHD as a child - so he will do ANYTHING to keep his child off the <br/>
drugs and now they are coming after them! This is just too close to <br/>
home for me! I am giving them the number for the HSDLA but I don&#39;t <br/>
know how else I can help.  <br/>
  I have also been digging information about the IDEA act which says <br/>
the officials are in the wrong just by stating that &quot;the child needs <br/>
medication&quot;. BUT here (in Missouri) they just in May of this year <br/>
passed in a federal court that a child MUST be evaluated for mental <br/>
health because of the same law - the IDEA, the Child Find part <br/>
supposedly gives them permission. The family services/school <br/>
officials even told this family that they would pay for them to the <br/>
University for evaluation - This is where I had the horrible <br/>
experience having my son evaluated (eyeopening for me - Never went <br/>
back) - They&#39;re so in the drug companies pockets that EVERYONE they <br/>
see has ADHD - URGH! BUT just because they have to be evaluated <br/>
DOESN&#39;T mean that the parents MUST follow the treatment.<br/>
  Apparently also there is a &quot;Child medication safety act&quot; that <br/>
would prohibit parents from being coerced into administrating <br/>
psychiatric drugs to their children but it is stuck in the Senate <br/>
after passing in a landslide vote (425 to 1) in the House of Reps <br/>
during May of 2003. <br/>
  Can anyone think of anything else I could tell the parents to <br/>
help? Anything you could add to reassure me so I&#39;ll calm down? Way <br/>
too close to home!!! Moza</div>

Let them test him and let them get the prescription.<br/>
Let them object in writing, and keep extensive notes on dates and times of <br/>
everything involved.<br/>
<br/>
None of that means they have to actually give him the meds.<br/>

<br/>
But...<br/>
If he&#39;s homeschooled, who&#39;s pressing for this action?<br/>
Relatives?<br/>
Special ed folk at school hoping they can get him back there?<br/>

Remind them to deal in writing (WITH COPIES) and if it&#39;s relatives that&#39;s the <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s just so unreasonable.  I would think the best protection, even if <br/>
it was expensive, would be an evaluation from a pediatrician who <br/>
specified that the child did NOT need Ritalin.  Or at least stated that <br/>
taking Ritalin could cause some harm.   (And I think it&#39;s fine to ask <br/>
for recommendations and cherry-pick a doctor that doesn&#39;t think drugs <br/>
are good for kids.  It&#39;s highly probable that CPS picks their experts in <br/>
a biased way, too.)<br/>
<br/>
So talk to everyone you know locally to find a cool doctor and other <br/>
anti-Ritalin experts.<br/>
<br/>
Also, research the cons and pros of Ritalin on the internet.  I believe <br/>
it supresses appetite and can cause insomnia.  You may also find <br/>
information linking it to drug addiction.    It can&#39;t hurt to be <br/>
well-informed.<br/>
<br/>
**I have also been digging information about the IDEA act which says the <br/>

<br/>
I think Conneticut passed a law addressing the problem of teachers <br/>
effectively &quot;prescribing&quot; Ritalin by saying that certain kids would be <br/>
kicked out of school unless they took the pills.  But I suppose that <br/>
doesn&#39;t help anyone in Missouri.<br/>

him on Ritalin.  And we told the school that he WAS<br/>
actually taking the drugs, although, of course, he<br/>
wasn&#39;t.  A month later, they told me how much better<br/>
he was doing - see, there was no reason to be<br/>
concerned, the drug was A Good Thing.  Uh-huh.  Can we<br/>
say placebo for the teachers??<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;re now homeschooling.  My 8 year old and I are<br/>
trying hard to make unschooling look like &quot;real<br/>
school&quot; to Daddy.  (No, it&#39;s not really working)  And<br/>
if he needs to wear off some energy, he heads outside<br/>

I thought yours made sense, too.  How the heck would they know if you were administering it or not?  Surely  the law doesn&#39;t permit them to come to your house every day and watch you child swallow it?  And I doubt they would be that energetic.  &lt;g&gt;  But I suppose they could try to insist on a pharmacy receipt showing that the prescription had been filled once. And maybe they could do that over and over?  Providing that kind of proof would get expensive.<br/>
<br/>
I was wondering if it was possible to appeal to either the administration at the university or the licensing board for psychiatrists or psychologists on *ethical grounds*?  Even a kid who might be helped by Ritalin at school wouldn&#39;t require it at home.  And we can&#39;t be the only people who have reservations about prescribing drugs where there may be a genetic predisposition to addiction.  (How about a letter from the father&#39;s doctor stating that Ritalin would be risky in this family?)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-83911422">Hi, I am certain (as a former teacher, ugh!) that ADHD *must* be <br/>
diagnosed by a pediatrician or other medical professional.  They <br/>
should definately seek out a dr. and they will have to fill out some <br/>
sort of behavior scale (with forms for dr, school and home).....I say <br/>
to fudge the data on the scale, too.   In my experience, the ADHD <br/>
attributes were almost always only present in school.  <br/>
Hmmmm.....child problem or school problem? LOL.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Unfortuately this has nothing to do with the &quot;registering&quot; part of <br/>
homeschooling. Just in May of this year they upheld in a federal <br/>
court (over a Camdenton Missouri case - again TOO CLOSE TO HOME) <br/>
that the state has the right to MAKE a child be evaluated under <br/>
the &quot;Child Find&quot; section of the IDEA. But that doesn&#39;t mean that <br/>
they can MAKE a parent give their child psyc. drugs. Now that&#39;s what <br/>
they&#39;re trying to do again in this case, MAKE the child be evaluated <br/>
(and in their opinion put on stimulants for ADHD)claiming that the <br/>
parents are neglectful for not having their child evaluated, etc. <br/>
According to the same act, the IDEA, it is also unlawful for these <br/>
same people to even state &quot;he should be on medication&quot;!!! The HSLDA <br/>
is opposing the May federal court decision as well. But from my <br/>
understanding of the law they don&#39;t have the right to call not <br/>
putting a child on psyc. meds as neglect and they should not be <br/>
threatening to take the child into custody, there are no legal <br/>
grounds for their threats! <br/>
 So that&#39;s my take on the situation, that they just don&#39;t have a <br/>
legal &quot;leg&quot; to stand on. Because today is a holiday they haven&#39;t <br/>
been able to get any legal contact yet but hopefully on Friday they <br/>
will get things more straightened out. I&#39;m feeling somewhat better - <br/>
Unfortunately one of my cats was killed last night by a &quot;hit and <br/>
run&quot; driver. I am frankly mad at myself because I saw him the day <br/>
before just laying in the road and I didn&#39;t go and make him leave <br/>
but drove around him - I knew then that he was getting too <br/>
comfortable with the road. He as always been an &quot;inside/outside&quot; <br/>
cat - the first one of those I have ever had, kindof like a dog that <br/>
he scratched on the door when he wanted in or out and he seemed so <br/>
happy outside - enjoying the world  - and up until 2 days ago seemed <br/>
to stay away from the road I figured I would let him (not like he <br/>
wouldn&#39;t continue to scratch at the door until I let him out <br/>
anyways.) but now I feel like I could have somehow avoided the <br/>
tragedy, Urgh! He was only a little over a year old also! <br/>
 Anyhow I am off to make some pizza dough for pizza for supper and <br/>
also I think my ds wants to bake a cake this afternoon which will <br/>
hopefully cheer me up as I really am enjoying his new found interest <br/>
in baking.  Moza</div>

Moza, I&#39;m sorry for your loss. The brevity of the time you spent together<br/>
doesn&#39;t make it any less distressing to lose a unique member of your family,<br/>
even a four footed one. I hope you find some peace, it really isn&#39;t your<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-693603720">Wow. That does hit close to home. While Sarah was in kindergarten in <br/>
MA public schools, we did have her on first Ritalin and then <br/>
Adderall. She wasn&#39;t eating or sleeping, had lost weight she couldn&#39;t <br/>
afford to lose, and was becoming very aggressive. The school wanted <br/>
her tested for Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, ODD, and OCD and insisted that <br/>
she not be taken off the medications. When we refused, because we <br/>
felt that she was too stressed out, they called social services. That <br/>
was a nightmare I don&#39;t wish to repeat. She hasn&#39;t been on any <br/>
medications since the end of Kindergarten though.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, I don&#39;t really have any advice for them other than to <br/>
hold firm in their belief that they don&#39;t need to medicate their <br/>
child for ADHD. <br/>
