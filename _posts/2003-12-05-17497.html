OK.. I haven&#39;t done the math, or actually written down the cards.. But, I&#39;m <br/>
wondering, does he show 5 completely different cards when he has &quot;taken&quot; your <br/>
card?   You look for your card, its not there!  You don&#39;t pay attention to the <br/>
cards that remain.    But we did it with 2 or 3 folks, and all of our cards <br/>
were gone!.. I am going to try to confirm this theory, I will let you know the <br/>
results.  Fun website though!<br/>

They show the second group of cards really fast so it&#39;s not easy to see<br/>
they&#39;ve changed *all* the cards. <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not just the card you&#39;ve chosen taken away, but every card presented<br/>
the first time is taken away and the group of cards they show in the<br/>
&quot;look I took your card&quot; is a different group.  You don&#39;t notice because<br/>
you&#39;re only looking for your card the king of hearts, or whatever. <br/>
<br/>
Good trick!<br/>

OK. I was right... The 6 original cards are Kh Jc Ks Qd Qc Jd ,we checked <br/>
them 10 times.. same cards.. The 5 shown after yours is taken away are  Qh Kc Jh <br/>
Qs Kd.. voila, all different from the original.  Nice illusion.<br/>

<br/>
The trick is that they change *all* of the cards so it does not matter<br/>
which one that *you* choose. Since you are only thinking about the<br/>
card that you choose, you do not notice that all the others have<br/>
changed too. You notice that they do not leave the<br/>
after cards up for very long? It took me about 3 times going through<br/>
just to write down what the cards were after.<br/>
<br/>
Cards before:<br/>
<br/>
King Hearts<br/>
Jack Clubs<br/>
King Spades<br/>
Queen Diamonds<br/>
Queen Clubs<br/>
Jack Diamonds<br/>
<br/>
Cards after:<br/>
<br/>
Queen Hearts<br/>
King Clubs<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1104751109">He changes ALL the cards from the ones he showed when you chose a card.  So whatever you chose is not there.  Try it and think of 2 cards -- neither will be there. <br/>
