<div id="ygrps-yiv-1342788479"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt; listen to books on tape.  Last night I started &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot;.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt;finding the principles he is talking about very interesting.  I plan to <br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt;Trevor (14) listen too, as it tells how a couple young boys learned about<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ooohh, be careful with those.  Take it with a grain of salt!<br/>
&gt; Firstly, they&#39;re badly written.  As someone who loves the written word, <br/>
&gt; it&#39;s really disturbing when a &#39;bestseller&#39; is written so poorly.<br/>
&gt; Okay, but that&#39;s really not all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Someone did some research on him and he&#39;s not all he&#39;s cracked up to <br/>
&gt; be.  It seems that he was talking about owning multiple properties in <br/>
&gt; Arizona (etc) and someone did a search and found him listed as owner of <br/>
&gt; only two properties, one of which he sold to buy the second <br/>
&gt; one.  Un-huh.  Yeah.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I&#39;m not rushing out to buy multiple properties here in So. CA! :-)  What I <br/>
like about the book is looking at accumulating wealth coming from a different <br/>
direction.  Becoming a wage earner late in my life after years of being a <br/>
stay at home mom who believed she could &quot;make do&quot; with what ever money is <br/>
available, I need to spin some of my money attitudes.<br/>
<br/>
Like Trevor and I read in some book - a young girl was having fun creating <br/>
lots of her own businesses, and her friend was getting annoyed because there <br/>
was no time for her anymore.  She stated - &quot;you know money doesn&#39;t buy <br/>
happiness&quot;, her business friend replied, &quot;well it doesn&#39;t buy unhappiness <br/>
either&quot;.  <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll try the books you suggested.  I have never focussed on money, and <br/>
realize that the stress of trying to cover the dental work, plus looking at <br/>
my future, and covering my current expenses,  I need to educate myself and <br/>
direct some energy in this direction.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your input.  I hope I have the opportunity to take you to <br/>
lunch!!  :-)<br/>

I&#39;ve heard a few &#39;horror stories&#39; about folks taking that book literally, <br/>
quitting their jobs right off the bat and expecting to be millionaires in a <br/>
matter of days or weeks.... only to find themselves losing everything.<br/>
Ouch.  I should have realized that, being an unschooler, maybe you have a <br/>
better head on your shoulders than many! (grin) (no, no bias here, why do <br/>
you ask?)<br/>
The millionaire next door book is a little more grounded and I think you&#39;ll <br/>
really enjoy it!  Most libraries carry it I think.  It&#39;s really helped us <br/>
change our thinking about how wealthy people get and stay wealthy.  We&#39;re <br/>
inching that way, ever so slowly!!!<br/>
Enjoy,<br/>
