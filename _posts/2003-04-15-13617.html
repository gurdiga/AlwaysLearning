A couple years ago Beth, Julian, and I made a trip for almost a month to <br/>
Spain, Portugal, and Morocco.  In Spain not that many people spoke English, <br/>
but we got along pretty nicely with our phrase book (Go, Rick Steeves!) and <br/>
distant memories of college Spanish, and for Julian, his three years in a <br/>
bilingual school. <br/>
<br/>
In Morocco, in Marrakesh almost everyone spoke English as well as us (as well <br/>
as French, Arabic, etc.) -- including small children begging for money on the <br/>
streets. In the High Atlas Mountains and in the Sahara, it was less so, but <br/>
most spoke French, so we did fine with our phrase books and distant memories <br/>
of high school French.<br/>
<br/>
Then we got to Portugal. Most of the people there spoke English, which was a <br/>
damned good thing, because despite our phase book and despite the fact that <br/>
it LOOKS like Spanish, it was so hard.  There are SH sounds where they don&#39;t <br/>
seem to belong, etc.  Someone described it as a cross between Spanish and <br/>
French, spoken by a person with marbles in their mouth. But those brilliant <br/>
people mostly spoke Portuguese, English, and Spanish fluently. I&#39;d compliment <br/>
someone on their English, and they&#39;d humbly say, in perfect, almost <br/>
unaccented English, that they weren&#39;t very good.<br/>
<br/>
I live on the outskirts of a Portuguese neighborhood, too, right near <br/>
Peabody, Massachusetts. (We&#39;re in Salem.)  Janis, my grandparents lived in <br/>
East Providence, and I have an aunt and uncle in Riverside.  Maybe sometime <br/>
we can connect. You could come visit, or we could come there....maybe the <br/>
zoo?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1818512046">Hi Kathryn, <br/>
That sounds wonderful. Actually, Brianna & I like Salem very much. I&#39;m such a history person and Brianna is such a travel person. neither of us have ever met a place we didn&#39;t like! <br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d love to visit Portugal some day, actually, I want to visit everywhere.<br/>
<br/>
A zoo sounds wonderful.<br/>
Let&#39;s do it!<br/>
<br/>
Janis<br/>
