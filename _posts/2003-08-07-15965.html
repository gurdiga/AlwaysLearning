<div id="ygrps-yiv-958188992">Heidi, when do you leave for Myrtle Beach?  Sorry for posting here but didn&#39;t <br/>
have your E mail address.  <br/>
<br/>
We are there the week before the conference.  We had talked briefly about <br/>
getting together one day.  Wanted to set a date.  We have never been to <br/>
Brookgreen Gardens before.  Another option is the Alligator Adventure, my boys always <br/>
have to go there.  Or you had mentioned the Ripleys Aquarium.  You can pick a <br/>
place we are up for anything.  Also any day is OK with us during the week.  And <br/>
any time after 10:00.  LOL <br/>
Let me know<br/>
Pam G.<br/>
