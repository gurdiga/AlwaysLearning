&gt; They&#39;ve made bold statements and don&#39;t want to have to go back and say, I<br/>
&gt; need to rethink this?  <br/>
&gt; Some people just want to be right no matter what.  <br/>
&gt; I&#39;ve noticed the ones who can&#39;t defend their position any more, and still<br/>
&gt; won&#39;t give it up, are the one&#39;s who then cry they&#39;ve been attacked<br/>
&gt; . <br/>
&gt; Be what ever you want to be, but face it bravely, and don&#39;t call it what<br/>
&gt; it isn&#39;t.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Contrary. I think some people are just overly contrary. They have an INSTANT <br/>
contrary resistance to anyone who acts like they have any expertise. They <br/>
perceive anybody who has strong opinions as &quot;opinionated&quot; and accuse them of <br/>
putting themselves up on a pedestal and so on. It doesn&#39;t matter to them what <br/>
the opinions are based on or whether or not they make sense.<br/>
<br/>
I think we ALL probably have some of that in us -- that&#39;s what LET us reject <br/>
the authorities who say things like &quot;School is a child&#39;s job.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Some people just have too much of it and it clouds their logic. <br/>
<br/>
IF they have that extreme contrariness AND they are stubborn, too, they <br/>
disrupt lists with unnecessary contention.<br/>
