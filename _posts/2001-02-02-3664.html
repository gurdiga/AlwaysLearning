<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047609470">You kill your black widow spiders? We don&#39;t, at least not in the<br/>
corners and such, they eat so many bugs we keep &#39;em around.<br/>

I thought daughter had been bit by one once so I called poison<br/>
control. They said they were not really a problem but to watch out<br/>
for kissing bugs.<br/>

&gt; That&#39;s my job.  Nobody else kills black widow spiders--they hike across the<br/>
&gt; yard and through the house to tell me they saw one.  Nobody else touches dead<br/>
&gt; mice, or lizards, or birds.  It makes me feel big and brave.  (I&#39;m also the<br/>
&gt; undertaker for cats, but my husband has done the dog deaths we&#39;ve had, just<br/>
&gt; two.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; &lt;&lt;It was a hoot when he went to pick up the dead chipmunk and it shot into the<br/>
&gt; air and started running around the room. There was no gender-typical<br/>
&gt; reaction there. He screamed like a little girl. &gt;&gt;<br/>

&gt; I would too!<br/>

since I had children. Not that I don&#39;t kill widows in the house, I<br/>
do, just not in the dark corners of areas that also get other bugs<br/>
in the summer time. We have paper wasps too and what is one to do<br/>
about them? Hysterically spraying a can of raid around was what I<br/>
was modeled as child and that really seemed a bit extreme once I<br/>
grew older. <br/>

solely on their youth or inexperience. The posts I&#39;ve been reading seem to <br/>
showcase youth and a lack of understanding of what experienced people can <br/>
offer. That&#39;s all.<br/>
No one tried to suggest anyone should be judged by anything other than their <br/>
actions or lack thereof.<br/>
Are you trying to say that I could get just as much insight from you about my <br/>
12 y.o. as I could from Sandra or Sharon? I very much doubt it. You may have <br/>
some great suggestions, but you haven&#39;t LIVED through the 12 y.o. stage with <br/>
your child, so your information is not as valuable to me as someone that has.<br/>
You are stating that we are not understanding what you&#39;re saying....I think <br/>
it&#39;s the other way around.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-155683374">&lt;&lt;My nephew married a girl he met on the internet&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
My little brother was in Germany in the Army and met a guy from North<br/>
Dakota.  Once this guy was talking on the phone to a girl from home and Mike<br/>
(my brother) was goofing around and got on the phone with her.  They wrote<br/>
back and forth.  She got involved with some guy and had a baby.  They called<br/>
back and forth.<br/>
<br/>
When Mike got back to the US, he went to North Dakota and the first time he<br/>
saw Amy in person, he asked her to marry him.  Their first &quot;date&quot; was to get<br/>
engagement pictures taken.  They have been very happily married for 10<br/>
years.  Mike adopted her son and they have 2 dds.<br/>
<br/>
Point being, there are also lots of neat and wonderful people out there.<br/>

talked some and I figured he&#39;d be sort of on the liberal side if he was<br/>
out marching at midnight with everyone... and he&#39;s the one who talked<br/>
about how great John Rosemond was not 10 minutes into it. Aiii. I know I<br/>
mentioned that here... he had no dogs, either, maybe that should have<br/>
been a clue.<br/>

It hasn&#39;t mattered what approach I&#39;ve taken to getting a division of labor, my dh sees himself as the &quot;project guy&quot;.  My expectations of having the garbage taken out, because I mentioned it was garbage night, were unreasonable.  I just got very upset when I pulled up and there was no garbage.  If you remember, what started this was a thread that talked about the *difference* between asking someone to do something and then having it done someone just doing it because they know it would be appreciated.  I&#39;m probably not appreciative enough!<br/>

It is assumed I will pick up the slack or not(because others standards are lower) but it seems more important to me that things are done in a timely manner.  I have found that it doesn&#39;t take any more effort to do something when it needs being done and then you have the added bonus of not having to look at all the stuff you have to do, not to speak of enjoying your surroundings without trash or whatever piling up.<br/>

Taking bags of trash out of the house is whoever notices it&#39;s full.<br/>
<br/>
Making sure the dumpster-thing is at the curb, my husband dibbsed.<br/>

Picking trash up out of the yard, I do.  Gathering trash in a big bag from <br/>
all the little trashcans in bedrooms and bathrooms, I pick one or another <br/>

It&#39;s more an interest and ability and necessity thing.<br/>

That&#39;s my job.  Nobody else kills black widow spiders--they hike across the <br/>
yard and through the house to tell me they saw one.  Nobody else touches dead <br/>
mice, or lizards, or birds.  It makes me feel big and brave.  (I&#39;m also the <br/>
undertaker for cats, but my husband has done the dog deaths we&#39;ve had, just <br/>
two.)<br/>

Go to dog shows and hang around the Dane and Newfie rings! &lt;g&gt;<br/>

<br/>
Men at dog shows are married, approximately 99.999999% of the time (even the<br/>
gay men are in committed relationships).<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;d say go to field trials, as there are a higher percentage of unattached<br/>
straight guys who own nice dogs like Labs and Golden Retrievers, but they&#39;re<br/>
also Republicans with guns (the guys, not the dogs).<br/>
<br/>
Um -- oh! Go to agility trials! There are definitely some single guys there,<br/>
and they tend to be in good physical shape, too. And some of them won&#39;t be<br/>
gay or Republicans-with-guns or in relationships with anybody with two legs.<br/>

Our cat once brought in a squirrel, killed it and left it in the corner behind one of my living room chairs.  I didn&#39;t know anything about it until the house became inundated with large black flies. :-o  Talk about disgusting.  This was during my bike racing days and cleaning was not a priority!  <br/>

&lt;&lt; You kill your black widow spiders? We don&#39;t, at least not in the<br/>
corners and such, they eat so many bugs we keep &#39;em around. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re in the house I do!<br/>
<br/>
If they&#39;re right in the place where people stand to throw stuff in the <br/>
compost I do.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve been bitten by one of them, and two brown recluses.  I didn&#39;t have any <br/>
fun.  I can&#39;t wish that on a kid who was asked (by  me) to take the compost <br/>
out.<br/>
<br/>
I have a friend who never kills any spiders.  After I had kids I developed <br/>
the irrational urge to flatten to a smear anything that might bite them or <br/>
sting them (centipedes and wasps) or put nasty germs on them (cock roaches).<br/>
<br/>
Maybe now that Holly&#39;s getting big, that instinct will wane.<br/>

&lt;&lt; Brown recluse are nasty -- did you have a long time healing?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>The first time I was in my 20&#39;s, didn&#39;t know what it was (except &quot;something <br/>
bit me&quot;), in was inside my left knee, and a friend recognized it.  I kept <br/>
thinking &quot;it will get better soon.&quot;  I was bitten around July 1.  The skin <br/>
finally closed up (scab and all gone) late November or early December.<br/>
<br/>
So in my late 30&#39;s, early 40&#39;s (after I had kids) I got a bite on my ankle.  <br/>
I saw it, I called the doctor, I went in and said &quot;ANTIBIOTICS!&quot;  I took oral <br/>
and topicsl.  I don&#39;t remember if they gave me a shot too.  I said I wanted <br/>
the biggest antibiotic bomb ever.  And that one healed up in a week.<br/>
<br/>
The first year we were in this new house, I saw three.  Two I saved whole, <br/>
one I smashed flat.  <br/>
<br/>
Black widows would march across the bedroom floor (MY bedroom floor!) because <br/>
the house hadn&#39;t been lived in for a year or so and there&#39;s a crawl space <br/>
under that room.<br/>
<br/>
Haven&#39;t seen one of those inside for three years either.<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve exorcised them.<br/>

<br/>
In fifth grade I picked up a snake that had been run over by a car <br/>
lenghtwise. It was still &quot;warm&quot; (for a snake).  I took it to lunch with me.  <br/>
The teacher was disgusted and told me to throw it away, but I wouldn&#39;t.  When <br/>
she found out later I still had it, in the classroom, she gave me a box for <br/>
it. <br/>
<br/>
I took it home.  By then it was no longer &quot;bendable/poseable.&quot;  I kept it in <br/>
my room a while, and then set it up across the top of a horseshoe which was <br/>
nailed above the door to a shed we used as a playhouse.  It stayed there at <br/>
least three years.  Looked awful near the end, but it was MINE.<br/>
