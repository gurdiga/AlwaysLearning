times he leaves and arrives, they often save a lot... hotwire will just<br/>
show you the prices, and priceline has you put in your &quot;bid&quot; and then you<br/>
wait a half hour and see if you got it. Priceline also adds fees now...<br/>
and you can also book hotel rooms through both, and specify the area and<br/>
how many &quot;stars&quot;, minimum. We got a really nice room throught priceline<br/>
when we went up to see Karin in Phoenix, I think it was a Howard<br/>
Johnson&#39;s, walking distance from the play we were seeing, and only $30.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-843545532">Are you looking to book a room in Las Vegas?  We had some good luck last<br/>
time we stayed there are year or two ago by going to the about.com area on<br/>
LV and following some links there.  We ended up getting a very nice room at<br/>
the Hyatt, just off the strip for $50.00 a night.<br/>
