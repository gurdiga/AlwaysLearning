<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I found a lump in my breast the end of november,.....<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I had a very similar situation happen two summers ago...At the time I <br/>
was caring for my dear friend&#39;s children, while she went to chemo...I <br/>
watched her     s for 3years....<br/>
<br/>
So Kim was the first person I went to..She said find out everything <br/>
that you can, then it might not seem so scary..That helped, knowing <br/>
the odds and all..and talking to women that had a similar <br/>
experience.  It is the hardest waiting, and thinking.  I remember <br/>
laying in my backyard thinking OMG life might change tomorrow or the <br/>
next day.  I knew I would make myself crazy with the wild <br/>
imaginations so I got busy..I wrote cards to people that I knew <br/>
needed encouragement, baked casseroles for families that needed help, <br/>
went to the libary, Science Center, worked(hard)in the <br/>
garden....anything not to think about all the possibilities.  And I <br/>
took Valerian (it is a herb) to help me sleep. Deep breathing helps <br/>
the stress too. Mine turned out ok,  I do have some abnormal cells <br/>
that need to be monitored, but so far everthing is ok.  I hope that <br/>
all will be well for you and your family....And please do not feel <br/>
guilty for the way you are feeling toward MIL, feelings are just that <br/>
feelings, no sense adding in a heap of guilt...<br/>
<br/>
Prayers and hugs<br/>
