<div id="ygrps-yiv-907645875">My daughter (3yrs) loves to watch Dora, BAckyardigans, Diego.. she <br/>
picks up a ton of good info from them.<br/>

I have been so frustrated, though, by the cartoon &quot;The Wonder Pets&quot;. <br/>
They say things in a baby language instead of saying it the way it <br/>
should be said. Instead of saying &quot;trouble&quot;... at times they will <br/>
say &quot;twuh-bull&quot;. They do it with several words and it is so <br/>
frustrating to me!! <br/>
<br/>
Being that we unchool to a certain extent and I let her learn in her <br/>
own way in her own time.. ( I try not to correct her on too many <br/>
things as well)... I really do NOT understand how to explain to her <br/>
that these animals on TV are saying things right one day and wrong the <br/>
next. Shes starting to pick up on some of the incorrect words they use.<br/>
<br/>
What do you say to a three year old to tell her why they are doing <br/>
that? (Hell- I dont even know WHY they are doing it!!)</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2019247595">We love ³Wonder Pets² and it¹s message of helping animals and teamwork. If<br/>
the contrived, language impediment (I think the writers have them doing it<br/>
because they are trying to make them out to be cutesy, little,<br/>
singularly-helpless animals, nothing more.) bothers you, I¹d recommend<br/>
talking about it and how some people have difficulty saying words. Might be<br/>
a good opportunity to talk about not making fun of others.<br/>
<br/>
That said, I¹ve had the same issue w/ Caillou, but DD loved him! I saw how<br/>
much joy he brought her, so I eventually just ignored it. She never tried to<br/>
imitate him. <br/>
<br/>
I also had issues with Dora and Diego and their yelling EVERY SINGLE<br/>
THING!!! I used my own advice and took that as an opportunity to ask her why<br/>
she thought they had to use their voice like that and also explained why we<br/>
have ³outside²/²inside² voices. For example w/ inside voices, the library<br/>
where people are trying to read or sleep (we saw an older gentleman sleeping<br/>
there one day near the magazines); w/ outside voices, people love to run and<br/>
holler at the park in fun. She got it. LOLDora is on right now!<br/>

explain that to her? Has she asked you why they speak like that?<br/>
 If its out of her own curiosity, I&#39;d simply explain that some people <br/>
(or characters!LOL!) move in and out of &quot;baby talk&quot; as they grow. If its <br/>
simply something that bothers /you/,I wouldn&#39;t mention it at all.<br/>
Or if its something you feel extremely irritated by, I don&#39;t see any <br/>
harm in saying -as you are watching the show together - &quot;gee the way <br/>
they are talking drives me batty!&quot; As long as you are not labeling it as <br/>
&quot;bad&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; (because its not) Your dd will benefit from hearing you <br/>
express your opinions as long as she is also able and encouraged to <br/>
express her own.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1496084768">I think every kid&#39;s show has at least one character who speaks in baby<br/>
talk.  The pteradactyl in that dinosaur series can be really annoying<br/>
(to me).  I don&#39;t feel I need to explain or correct my daughter.  I<br/>
(and DH) don&#39;t speak in baby talk except when we are playing around.<br/>
Sometimes DD will imitate things she hears, but the words phase<br/>
themselves out as she moves on to other things.<br/>
A lot of parents get hung up on this but myself I&#39;m just not worried.<br/>
 I had two sets of cousins who spoke in twin talk when they were kids,<br/>
and as they got older and spent more time out and about with other<br/>
kids they gradually lost it.  I know one mom right now whose 6 yr old<br/>
twins speak twin talk, and their school system has them in all sorts<br/>
of special needs classes because of it.  Pretty sad.  <br/>
My DD has a few words she mispronounces, my favorite is &quot;mistAppeared&quot;<br/>
for disappeared :) <br/>
I have a very successful (in the business world) adult friend who<br/>
can&#39;t pronounce certain words, like enzymes - she always says<br/>
&quot;emzynes&quot;.  It&#39;s no big deal!<br/>
So maybe those &quot;annoying&quot; characters are just representative of a<br/>
portion of the population who does &quot;talk funny&quot; and we don&#39;t need to<br/>
explain why they are different, they just speak that way.<br/>
In the words of Strawberry Shortcake, &quot;It&#39;s our differences that make<br/>
us interesting and unique!&quot;<br/>

<br/>
If a mom posts that she  has an &quot;urgh&quot; attitude (judgmental) and  <br/>
someone else suggests that being judgmental can be more damaging than  <br/>
babytalk, that is a statement of fact. It&#39;s a reminder to someone who  <br/>
chose to post negativity in public that the negativity might be the  <br/>
worst part of the equation.<br/>

There&#39;s more advice than you could read in two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
If you want personalized assistance for your problem as you choose to  <br/>
state it, any advice you get in the absence of good judgment isn&#39;t  <br/>
going to be very helpful at all.     If you want advice from people  <br/>
who don&#39;t think very carefully before they write, you have come to  <br/>
the wrong list.<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re new at unschooling, the UnschoolingBasics list would be  <br/>
good for you.  Don&#39;t worry; I&#39;m not on it.<br/>
If you only partly unschool, this list is probably not your best  <br/>
resource.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m sorry- I think I gave you the wrong idea. I think the way you <br/>
took it was that I only &quot;partly&quot; unschool.<br/>
<br/>
What I meant by that statement was that since my children are 3 <br/>
months old, 14 months old and 3 years old... so we unschool to a <br/>
certain extent. Some people have argued with me about that fact that <br/>
I don&#39;t truly unschool since my children are not yet old enough to <br/>
be in &quot;real&quot; school yet anyway. Do you see what I mean?<br/>
<br/>
Therefore- I said we unschool to a certain extent (which I feel is <br/>
100% unschooling, but some have challenged me on the age thing).<br/>
<br/>
Hope that clears it up for ya :)<br/>
<br/>
Sorry bout that!<br/>
