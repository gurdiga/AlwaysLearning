<div id="ygrps-yiv-1229195299">Ok, I have another question.  Now that the food thing is going along <br/>
ok, I&#39;ve been letting the kids stay up until they want to go to bed.  <br/>
<br/>
At what age do you start this?  My three year old is ALWAYS telling <br/>
me, &quot;Me no wanna go bed&quot;.  I have been letting them stay up until I&#39;m <br/>
ready to go to bed because I feel that the 5 and 3 year olds are too <br/>
young to be up by themselves downstairs with everyone else asleep in <br/>
bed. (And I often stay up very late) I would allow my 9 year old to <br/>
stay up by herself but she doesn&#39;t want to go to sleep without me <br/>
singing to her first, and if she wants me to sing to her it has to be <br/>
before I go to bed.  <br/>
<br/>
But what do you do when they are real miserable and it&#39;s obvious it&#39;s <br/>
because they didn&#39;t get enough sleep?  Do you just put up with their <br/>
miserableness?  This is something I&#39;m seeing in the 3 year old <br/>
especially.  I will pick him up and tickle him when he&#39;s getting <br/>
miserable and say something like, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re miserable because you <br/>
didn&#39;t get enough sleep last night&quot; but he still stays miserable.  <br/>
<br/>
And what do you do when they fall asleep downstairs on the floor?  <br/>
Wake them up and coax them upstairs?  And when they stay up until <br/>
they fall asleep on the floor, they never feel like brushing their <br/>
teeth...<br/>
<br/>
And finally, my three year old has been asking to sleep with me.  We <br/>
never did the co-sleeping thing before.  I hate to deny him that <br/>
since he&#39;s directly asking to do it, but when he sleeps with us my dh <br/>
and I don&#39;t get enough sleep and then we&#39;re miserable the next day!  <br/>
Especially dh, who said he&#39;s always forced to the side of the bed and <br/>
he&#39;s clinging to the side afraid that if he goes to sleep he&#39;ll fall <br/>
off.  And I don&#39;t sleep as well because I sometimes can&#39;t get in my <br/>
most comfy position or because I&#39;m afraid ds is going to fall out of <br/>
bed or get his head stuck under the covers or between the pillows or <br/>
something.  <br/>
<br/>
You ladies always give great advice. I&#39;d appreciate whatever you can <br/>
give me!</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-294289786">What I do is this.<br/>
<br/>
Janene is tired between 8 and 9.  So at that time I encourage her to get <br/>
a bedtime snack, brush her teeth etc.  She knows she is tired and does <br/>
so.  Then we read a few books and I either lie down with her or work on <br/>
the computer which is next to the bed.  She sometimes plays for a few <br/>
minutes and sometimes not, but if there is no other light except the <br/>
computer, she goes to sleep. I don&#39;t say it&#39;s bedtime exactly, i just <br/>
make sleep happen for her in a way I know works.<br/>
<br/>
With Lexie, I don&#39;t do a thing.  I occassionally fail because I will say <br/>
&quot;JUST GO TO SLEEP!&quot; because it&#39;s 1am and I&#39;m tired and trying to get <br/>
some work done.  But mostly I just let her stay up.  Usually between 11 <br/>
and 1, we read whatever book I&#39;m reading aloud to her and then I turn <br/>
off my light and go to sleep.  She sometiems follows suit but sometimes <br/>
goes into the other room to read.  I dont&#39; worry about her, she&#39;s 7.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1023405120">This is one of Lexie&#39;s goals for the year (on some stupid list they were <br/>
listing their goals, and the goals were really funny.. have a better <br/>
attitude about our daily 3 hour school schedule, write down what we do, <br/>
do a better job of planning, etc. so I asked Lexie what her goals <br/>
were..)  anyway, Lexie&#39;s goal was to memorize all four HP books, so she <br/>
can beat Rain (Daron&#39;s child) at HP Trivia (Rain beat Lexie, the very <br/>
first time she&#39;s ever been beaten), stay up 24 hours,<br/>
<br/>
oh wait, I just found my email...<br/>
<br/>
1. stay up all night and all day once.<br/>
2. to learn to do more algebra<br/>
3. to get all four Harry Potter books memorized<br/>
4. To beat Rain at Harry Potter Trivia<br/>
5.  To play soccer better<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I thought they were interesting, especially that stay up all night <br/>
thing.  I think we need to find a friend to try it with her, cause her <br/>
mom can&#39;t stay awake past 2am!<br/>

miserableness?  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I used to rock mine in the rocking chair, or let them fall asleep on the <br/>
couch where other people were (reading to them, or letting them fall asleep <br/>
to a video).<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I will pick him up and tickle him when he&#39;s getting <br/>
miserable and say something like, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re miserable because you <br/>
didn&#39;t get enough sleep last night&quot; but he still stays miserable.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Tickling and teasing probably have never helped a miserable person ever.  I&#39;d <br/>
drop those two parts.    Can&#39;t you say with some sympathy and compassion <br/>
&quot;You&#39;re probably just tired&quot; without adding the shaming bit like it&#39;s his own <br/>
fault?<br/>
<br/>
Kids learn to regulate themselves from failures to do so, not from the words <br/>
of other people.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And what do you do when they fall asleep downstairs on the floor?  <br/>
Wake them up and coax them upstairs?  And when they stay up until <br/>
they fall asleep on the floor, they never feel like brushing their <br/>
teeth...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have tooth brushing at a certain time without regard to sleep-time so they&#39;re <br/>
all done, or let them wait until they wake up.   I&#39;d carry them to bed or to <br/>
a couch when they fell asleep on the floor.  The sleeping is more important <br/>
than the being in a bed.<br/>
<br/>
If your kids are too sleepy, it&#39;s better if it&#39;s not because you woke them up <br/>
from a sound sleep to brush their teeth and change rooms.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;And finally, my three year old has been asking to sleep with me.  We <br/>
never did the co-sleeping thing before.  I hate to deny him that <br/>
since he&#39;s directly asking to do it, but when he sleeps with us my dh <br/>
and I don&#39;t get enough sleep and then we&#39;re miserable the next day!  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sleep with the child in HIS bed, or in a floor bed made for the occasion.  <br/>
Fold out a couch.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1534945343">Since you stay up late, could you make a snuggly bed on the floor where<br/>
you&#39;re going to be for the three and five year olds to sleep?<br/>
You wouldn&#39;t have to call it a bed, if they are really opposed to<br/>
sleeping, you could call it the cozy or the snuggle or something friendly<br/>
sounding, and if they do fall asleep you could just take them ( can you<br/>
scoop them up without waking them?)  to their own beds when you go, or<br/>
stay there with them. &lt;g&gt; Sounds fun!<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they want to stay up because that&#39;s where you are.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they&#39;d feel more like going to bed if they could sleep with each<br/>
other when you can&#39;t be there?  What if you laid down with them for half<br/>
an hour after story time or singing time, or when the three year old is<br/>
asking to sleep with you. <br/>
<br/>
Where ever they sleep, can you just let them sleep as long as they want<br/>
the next day?  Is there any reason they have to get up at a certain time?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
If the little one is really miserable from lack of sleep a few minutes<br/>
rocking and singing might be a comfort or a transport to more sleep.<br/>
<br/>
We had a little tent we set up in the living room of our very tiny house<br/>
when Dylan was smaller.  It was all made up with a bed, but it zipped<br/>
closed to keep the dogs and cats out.  During the day sometimes he would<br/>
sneak in there and not intending to, would fall asleep just because it<br/>
was cozy.  (He stored Cheerios in there, too.)    <br/>
<br/>
When Dylan was three ( and two and one and brand-new and sometimes now)<br/>
he slept with us.  He never got squished, or suffocated or lost.&lt;g&gt; <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1142948594">I was concerned about our sleeping habits, my 9 year<br/>
old and 13 year old have some issues with sleeping<br/>
without me, probably because I didn&#39;t have them in bed<br/>
with me from the time they came home from the<br/>
hospital.  I would definitely do things differently<br/>
today.  So we all sleep on the floor in one of their<br/>
rooms, I have tried to get my husband to sleep with<br/>
us, but he won&#39;t.  He tells me I am perpetuating a bad<br/>
habit, I don&#39;t think so. I like to think I am<br/>
fulfilling a need I denied them when they were little.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I guess I forgot an intro, or maybe I already did.  I<br/>
have been on the unschooling website and heard about<br/>
this one. <br/>
<br/>
I also have had the food issue. I use to make an issue<br/>
out of it and it was such a fight and than I decided<br/>
it wasn&#39;t worth it.  My husband and family think I<br/>
have lost control, guess what I don&#39;t want control. <br/>
Nice to read other emails with similar situations. <br/>
Now I unfood.<br/>
