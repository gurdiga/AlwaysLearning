I think it’s not really London, but it’s “greater London.”  Kind of London. :-)<br/>
<br/>
(Text below, with a couple of live links, or you can read it here:)<br/>
<br/>
This notice was sent out by Julie and Janine on May 25, 2016:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Sandra Dodd will be speaking at a one day event on Sunday 18th September from 9.30am to 5.30pm, followed by free pizza, and more informal chat until 6.30pm. The venue is in Long Ditton (near Surbiton & Kingston Upon Thames). There is free car parking on site and in the surrounding streets, and it is a 20 minute walk (or a short bus or taxi ride) to the nearest train station at Surbiton.<br/>
<br/>
A Day with Sandra Dodd is an event for experienced unschoolers. It is designed for radical unschoolers who are already committed to the approach and who are looking to deepen their understanding and improve their practice. It is not really aimed at people who are brand new to unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
Sandra says that she is getting old and cranky, and coming all the way from New Mexico to answer beginners’ questions isn’t a good use of her time. So if you haven’t progressed beyond “What?! You let them have more than an hour a day on screens?!” then go to SandraDodd.com/help and catch up.<br/>
<br/>
The day will be an opportunity to hear Sandra speak in-depth about some of the more advanced/sophisticated aspects of unschooling and how it feels when solid unschooling principles underpin everything you do, so that learning, peace and joy are your everyday reality. There will also be opportunities to chat and share ideas with other experienced unschoolers.<br/>
<br/>
Tickets for the day are £22.50 for adults. We also have junior tickets which are £17.50 and are available for teens/children who are interested in listening to the talks.The event isn’t suitable for children younger than about ten as there won’t be any activities for them on site. Babes in arms are welcome although we ask you to step outside if your baby is making a noise and preventing others from hearing the talks.<br/>
<br/>
If you think you would like to attend please email us to let us know how long you have been unschooling, the ages of your children and what you are hoping to get out of the day. This will allow us to make sure that the content is well targeted. Please email at this address <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:juliedaniel.email@...">juliedaniel.email@...</a>. You can also email us on this address if you have other questions.<br/>
