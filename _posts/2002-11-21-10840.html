&gt;Well, there&#39;s something to be said about wishing to avoid confrontation. <br/>
&gt;Because I really didn&#39;t want to call the grandmother unless I was<br/>
&gt;*absolutely* sure, I decided to count everything again.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Found I had made a mistake, having put only $35 change in the drawer for<br/>
&gt;Saturday&#39;s sale, when I wrote down $45 and thought I had put in that much.<br/>
&gt;The total of all sales/money taken in was exactly $10  OVER, because I had<br/>
&gt;taken $10 out of the donations to make up for the loss.  Saturday&#39;s take<br/>
&gt;balanced, but nothing did when I added up all the sales. <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;::whew:::  Now I just have to deal with the girl&#39;s propensity to ask people<br/>
&gt;for money for herself.  I realize this is a cultural issue--she&#39;s a different<br/>
&gt;race than me.  It happens to me on occasion, little kids--strangers to<br/>
&gt;me--approaching me and asking for quarters or dollars.  Even had a boy about<br/>
&gt;9 come up and ask me if he could have a piece of our pizza!  I find it rude<br/>
&gt;and obnoxious, and realize that others might feel differently.  But what is<br/>
&gt;that about?  I don&#39;t get it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Tuck<br/>
