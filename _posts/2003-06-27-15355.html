<div id="ygrps-yiv-1291575240">I found this at unschooling.com, in a folder about obsessions.  It&#39;s COOL!  <br/>
Certainly reminded me of Roxana, whose obsessions led me to my own <br/>
(shorter-lived) obsession, which led to me and Holly seeing Cats in London, with a <br/>
friend who had never been to any musicals in London (she lives there) and now goes <br/>
all the time.  A couple of days ago she came to visit, and brought Holly the <br/>
CD of a new musical there called Bombay Dreams, and so one influence continues <br/>
to have an effect!!<br/>

My dd (11) has always let her interests become all-consuming. It&#39;s just how <br/>
she explores things. By taking her &#39;obsessions&#39; to the next level, she always <br/>
finds new avenues, new experiences...sometimes new &#39;obsessions&#39;! <br/>
<br/>
Currently, she is truly enamoured(sp?) by the broadway musical &quot;Cats&quot;. It is <br/>
all she talks about. Every single thing that comes out of her mouth has <br/>
something to do with the songs, the characters, or some other aspect of the musical <br/>
&quot;Cats&quot;. I have to say that this does become rather ....tedious... after a <br/>
while, but I encourage it. I have learned more about that musical than I could <br/>
have ever wanted to know. I had no idea that the musical was based on a book of <br/>
poetry written by T.S. Elliot. Of course now she has all of the poems <br/>
memorized, along with learning new words like &#39;terpsichorean&#39;. <br/>
She has made 2 collars, a tail, and 2 wristbands, wearing them everywhere she <br/>
goes, and is very busy visiting websites of others who are equally obsessed <br/>
with &quot;Cats&quot; (and there are many...) She wants to begin making full scale, <br/>
professional looking costumes, and has also become interested in makeup and wig <br/>
making. She wants to learn how to knit her own leg warmers (it looks SO much <br/>
better if they are knit, rather than crochet!). She has already begun <br/>
brainstorming ideas for her own original characters. All of this came about simply because <br/>
she watched the DVD at someones house one afternoon. I had nothing to do with <br/>
it! <br/>
<br/>
We just happened to find out the other day that the musical is actually <br/>
coming to a nearby city in December. Tickets go on sale in 4 days. When we learned <br/>
this, she actually broke down and cried tears of joy. I love that she can feel <br/>
so passionate about her favorite things. The hard part is to keep other <br/>
people from saying &quot;Can&#39;t you please talk about ANYTHING ELSE!!!&quot; The joy she seems <br/>
to find in sharing her knowledge is worth so much. I&#39;d not want anyone else <br/>
to dampen her enthusiasm in any way. Just a year ago, I, myself, might have <br/>
said something snarky, but I am learning to bite my tongue and not limit her <br/>
spirit with my comments. With unschooling, any interest can become a full fledged <br/>
passion, and any passion can become a life altering experience. There is so <br/>
much &#39;learning&#39; taking place in the name of Joy. I can&#39;t begin to describe how <br/>
wonderful this has been for us. And it hasn&#39;t even been a year! <br/>

<br/>
 YES!<br/>
<br/>
I get this all the time,  with my son and his passion for video games.    I<br/>
even have a friend who worries that he will be a social misfit from me<br/>
encouraging his passions.   Please.......<br/>
<br/>
I just keep saying that these passions will probably turn into his life<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
In allowing him to pursue these things I can see his self-esteem returning.<br/>
(He was in ps for 5 years.)  His excitement for life is so awesome!  Take<br/>
that a way?   Try and get him to be interested in things that *I* think he<br/>
should be interested in?   I don&#39;t think so!!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I think I need to look into that thread,   thanks Sandra.<br/>
