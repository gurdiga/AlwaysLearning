<div id="ygrps-yiv-75746962">I posted recently about my problems with my family&#39;s concerns with my <br/>
approach to reading.  Now I have another concern.  My in laws have the <br/>
attitude that most people have.  They treat children as if they were <br/>
not deserving of their respect.  We had a family get together for <br/>
Easter and it was so difficult to watch all the coercion, threats, <br/>
punishment, etc. that went on.  Now that I am getting more familiar <br/>
with unschooling, that stuff looks horrible to me.  I almost can&#39;t bear <br/>
to watch it go on. <br/>
<br/>
My husband&#39;s family is probably pretty typical as far as what most <br/>
people believe regarding discipline.  I felt so &quot;foreign&quot; today as I <br/>
tried to handle my children in a respectful manner.  Remarks were made <br/>
not directly to me but in general like, &quot;When I was a kid, I got <br/>
spanked for something like that!&quot; or &quot;When I was a kid, I had to eat <br/>
everything on my plate,&quot; (DD(8) didn&#39;t clean her plate but wanted to <br/>
eat some of her Easter candy) and just those types of remarks. <br/>
<br/>
When I was a child, my mother was very &quot;brick wall&quot;.  We were all <br/>
scared to death of her.  She was not only manipulative, but verbally, <br/>
emotionally and physical abusive as well.  I think that may be why I <br/>
have such a hard time speaking up for myself even when I know what I am <br/>
doing is right and confronting people.  I always tried to make my <br/>
mother happy to avoid any of the consequences, so now I find myself <br/>
(even at 40 something) always trying to please others.<br/>
<br/>
It was so hard for me to even think of anything to say when these <br/>
remarks were going around the dinner table and afterwards.  I just seem <br/>
to freeze up.  Also, I first heard about unschooling back in September, <br/>
so there is still so much I am trying to figure out myself and I am <br/>
still finding out what it is I truly do believe.<br/>
<br/>
What are some ways that I can talk to my family about being respectful <br/>
to children?  Any ideas?<br/>
<br/>
Also, does anyone know if there is a way to do a blog where only people <br/>
you want to read it can --- like maybe they have to have a password or <br/>
something?  I thought maybe if I had some sort of Private blog, my <br/>
family and my husband&#39;s family could read about what we do and maybe <br/>
that would help them see what our life looks like.  <br/>
<br/>
I read on, I think, Sandra&#39;s site an email that someone wrote to their <br/>
family to clear up misconceptions and such about unschooling.  I am <br/>
wondering if maybe I sent an email to my family discussing my views on <br/>
discipline and respect they would understand where I am coming from, <br/>
especially since I have such a hard time confronting people in person.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Melissa</div>

It&#39;s easier, I think, to just prepare your children for dealing with  <br/>
disrespectful relatives.  They&#39;ll meet up with lots of harsh people  <br/>
in life, and they can practice compassionately on their own  <br/>
relatives, maybe!<br/>

Wait until you&#39;re really confident to do that, I think.  And by then  <br/>

<br/>
I have a thick skin though. I might come up with some good one-liners<br/>
and leave it at that. You will probably invite more criticism if you<br/>
try to change their minds or explain unschooling in depth. Let it rest<br/>
unless they ask questions. As Kelly Lovejoy always says &quot;the proof is<br/>
in the pudding&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
Years later, when you still have great relationships with your<br/>
children they will quit making lame comments I bet. I don&#39;t hear that<br/>
kind of crap from family anymore. I&#39;m lucky to have a radical<br/>
unschooling sis too....which takes some of the focus off me. :)<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think one way to handle these kinds of remarks is to treat them like an <br/>
amazing and sad piece of information about an utterly foreign culture - <br/>
which hopefully is how our kids think of them. Sympathetic disarming. They <br/>
know you hear their criticism but make a concious refusal to take it on or <br/>
allow it to affect your kids or get into an argument.<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Wow how awful.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;What a shame.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;How sad.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps later on with your kids, &quot;Gee I&#39;m sure glad we don&#39;t live the same <br/>
way granny did.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is why we unschool. So that my dd won&#39;t ever have that kind of memory <br/>
in her head.<br/>

I&#39;ve said &quot;Grandma and Grandpa don&#39;t really know how to be happy&quot; for David&#39;s parents. And there have been conversations before or after visiting about how hard it is for some people to change from being quiet and calm to noisy and peaceful. <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Because you&#39;re feeling defensive. Remarks are feeling like attacks.  <br/>
(They very likely are!)<br/>
<br/>
You want them to stop and you don&#39;t know how.<br/>
<br/>
But the only one you can change is you. Other people are who they  <br/>
are. Unless they&#39;re making your kids do something you disagree with  <br/>
-- then you should jump in -- your kids are probably not feeling the  <br/>
words the same way you are. They&#39;re probably seeing the people as  <br/>
individuals who have a different way of viewing life. Kids won&#39;t see  <br/>
the occasional &quot;When I was a kid ..&quot; remark as a disguised reprimand.  <br/>
They&#39;re too concrete for that fortunately :-) (Living with a parent  <br/>
who says that is a different story though. It would come with lots of  <br/>
other remarks and actions to wear the child down.)<br/>
<br/>
If you see these people with compassion, as people who had these  <br/>
harsh ways of life imposed on them -- who had to make themselves  <br/>
believe that that&#39;s the way life needs to be otherwise they were  <br/>
suffering for nothing -- it&#39;s lots easier to see the point of their  <br/>
remark as a painful echo of their childhood. It&#39;s lots easier to find  <br/>
a way to not feel their remarks as criticism (even if they are) and  <br/>
to say, as others suggested, &quot;That&#39;s too bad,&quot; and so on.<br/>

younger.  Now they are 10, 11 and 15 and people aren&#39;t so in my <br/>
face.  Though they do like to talk behind my back.  At those times, <br/>
I tried to shift the focus onto me instead of my kids.  I would say <br/>
that times have changed and spanking has been proved to do way much <br/>
more harm than good.  The particular person in my life that gave me <br/>
the most grief has always been impressed with big things, so I told <br/>
her that The American Academy of Pediatrics discourages spanking.  <br/>
As to eating everything on the plate, I would call attention to the <br/>
fact that obesity is a real issue in America right now (assuming <br/>
that is where you live).  I too grew up in the &#39;clean your plate&#39; <br/>
club.  The only thing that eating everything on your plate will do <br/>
is add more calories to your body.  It will not help the starving <br/>
children in [insert 3rd world country name here].  As for the Easter <br/>
candy, I would have said it&#39;s Easter, the kids know they get candy <br/>
on that day so keeping it from them would be the same thing as <br/>
refusing to allow them to open Christmas gifts on Christmas Day.<br/>
<br/>
Honestly, I found it challenging to rise above my upbringing and <br/>
actually stop being afraid of the adults in my family the way I was <br/>
afraid when I was a kid.  What&#39;s the worst they can do?  Punish <br/>
you?  You&#39;re an adult.  Speak unkindly to you?  Hug them and say <br/>
you&#39;re sorry they see things the way they do and you wish they could <br/>
be as full of joy of life as you and your family are.  Stop speaking <br/>
to you?  Well, I&#39;ve had that happen.  I think it hurt them more than <br/>
it hurt me in the long run.  You are NOT responsible for how they <br/>
perceive things.  But you can be proactive and protect your children <br/>
from going through the same things you have gone through with the <br/>
same people, if that makes any sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1327228627">Thanks so much for the responses to my post.  I am a very sensitive <br/>
person, so responding to family members with compassion would feel <br/>
right to me.  I think if I look at their responses as coming from <br/>
people who don&#39;t know how to live life joyfully, I WILL feel truly <br/>
compassionate towards them and be able to respond from my heart.<br/>
<br/>
My other issue is, because I was controlled so much as a child and <br/>
always felt the need (very real need due to the abuse) to please my <br/>
mother, I still feel like I have to please everyone.  One of the <br/>
issues that came up yesterday was that my husband&#39;s brother carried <br/>
my ds(5) out to the car after church against his will.  My brother-in-<br/>
law was &quot;helping&quot; me out because, as has been said in my husband&#39;s <br/>
family many times behind my back and also to me, &quot;Melissa doesn&#39;t <br/>
know how to control/handle M.&quot; (Ds is very intense). I think he was <br/>
just taking it upon himself to be &quot;helpful&quot; to me.  Then he forced DS <br/>
into his car seat and shut the car door.  When I got in the car, DS <br/>
was crying and said, &quot;Mommy, why didn&#39;t you make Uncle J put me <br/>
down?  I didn&#39;t want to be carried.  I wanted to walk like a big <br/>
boy.&quot;  I apologized to him and told him I should have told Uncle J to <br/>
put him down.  <br/>
<br/>
Honestly, while my brother-in-law was carrying him, DS was not crying <br/>
or screaming.  BIL was doing silly things like holding him upside <br/>
down, etc. that DS usually loves.  When I noticed that DS didn&#39;t like <br/>
what was going on was when BIL started forcing him into the car <br/>
seat.  Also, BIL was getting forceful in his tone of voice and what <br/>
he said to DS.  I didn&#39;t say anything because I was afraid of the <br/>
confrontation (we&#39;re in a church parking lot and lots of people are <br/>
around).  Looking back, what I did was let my precious son know that <br/>
his feelings were not as important as me &quot;pleasing&quot; my brother-in-<br/>
law.  Wow.  That hurts.  That makes me feel ashamed of myself.  I <br/>
just don&#39;t know how to get over the fear of confrontation, even <br/>
peaceful confrontation.  Maybe those old feelings of what happened as <br/>
a child surface in the moment when confrontation comes up.  How do <br/>
you get over that?<br/>
<br/>
Now, I know everyone in my husband&#39;s family thinks I can&#39;t handle my <br/>
son and that I need lots of help, and this has been going on since DS <br/>
was around 2 and before I knew about unschooling or the philosophy of <br/>
living life joyfully and peacefully.  I was using tools from my past <br/>
to deal with my son.  Now I know a better way, but my husband&#39;s <br/>
family is unaware of this philosophy and basically think I am <br/>
whimping out on my responsibility to &quot;deal&quot; with my DS.  <br/>
<br/>
I need help in learning ways to respond to these family members that <br/>
love me and think they are helping me.  I know my new way of living <br/>
does not look &quot;normal&quot; to them.  It looks to them like I am letting <br/>
my children &quot;get away with it&quot;. I need to learn ways to handle <br/>
confrontation and how to stand up for my children.  <br/>

 </span></blockquote>Keep out of situations in which your son&#39;s intensity is going to be  <br/>
apparent and annoying to those family members who might take matters  <br/>
(literally) into their own hands.<br/>
<br/>
For the times when you can&#39;t avoid it -- have an arsenal of words and  <br/>
phrases ready. For example, the minute you noticed BIL getting overly  <br/>
forceful, maybe you could have said, &quot;Wait a second.&quot; He&#39;d have at  <br/>
least paused and looked at you and you&#39;d have a second to intervene by  <br/>
calling your son to you on the pretense of asking him a question or  <br/>
something.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The family members will maybe change, over the years - but it&#39;ll be as  <br/>
a result of your kids getting older and you seeming more capable and  <br/>
confident, not as a result of hearing about your parenting ideas.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
But, for now, they have to be worked around. Think of them as the  <br/>
obstacles on a miniature golf course - you might even have a little  <br/>
fun working around them and helping your kids do so.<br/>
<br/>
This is assuming nobody is spanking your kids, yelling too much  <br/>
directly at them, hurting their feelings repeatedly, quizzing them too  <br/>
much. You have to be the judge of whether it is more damaging than  <br/>
beneficial to be around them at all.<br/>

&gt; law.  Wow.  That hurts.  That makes me feel ashamed of myself.  I <br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Don&#39;t sit feeling ashamed.  You get to learn just like your kids do.  Take that <br/>
uncomfortableness and ask the hard questions of yourself.  Like what are you going to do <br/>
next time.  Reenact the scene, but replace yourself with your new version.  Rewrite the <br/>
script--what do you say now?  You have plenty of time, you aren&#39;t frozen in the moment <br/>
anymore--and by the way, I&#39;m sure everyone has a story during a time of transition, when <br/>
they didn&#39;t know how the new them was going to respond and so they froze.  I know I <br/>
have.  But take that to the next level and create a new response.  How will you support <br/>
your son?  Because now you will.<br/>
<br/>
Begin to create the change you are asking about through fanatasy--play.  That&#39;s how my <br/>
kids do it.  Play with what you want to sound like, how you want to present yourself and <br/>
imagine what she is like.  Practice a few other scenarios before the next get together.  You <br/>
can also prep your kids if that seems appropriate.  &quot;Uncle J sometimes doesn&#39;t know when <br/>
he is overwhelming you.  How about we make a signal you can give me that clearly tells me <br/>
you need help, or you say &quot;no&quot; clearly?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Be prepared--and chances are that if you bring the new you to the party, some of the <br/>
challenge won&#39;t even present itself.  People can read the energy (body signals, posture, <br/>
commanding presence, whatever it is) of an alpha person who&#39;s confident and in control <br/>
from a mile away--so can animals.  We know through all of those unconscious signals <br/>
who we will respect and who we will challenge in a situation with a pecking order.  In a <br/>
more loving situation, we read those same signals as who is o.k. and who might need <br/>
more social help, and we befriend that person, not single them out for the kill!<br/>
<br/>
I think if I look at their responses as coming from <br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; people who don&#39;t know how to live life joyfully, I WILL feel truly <br/>
&gt; compassionate towards them and be able to respond from my heart.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
 </span></blockquote>And these people, seen through a different lens, may also be challenging you and your <br/>
kids to see if you&#39;ll break.  If you don&#39;t, maybe there&#39;s something worthwhile there.  I <br/>
remember so clearly the moment when I decided I would swear.  I didn&#39;t want to, but it <br/>
was cool, so I did.  I swore to my mother, and for the first time she didn&#39;t stop me.  I so <br/>
wanted her to stop me and was shocked when she didn&#39;t.  I actually felt abandoned!  But <br/>
the point is that to her I was bristly and confrontative and in her face, but inside me I was <br/>
small and looking for love and connection.  I kept the bristly exterior because my real <br/>
needs weren&#39;t met, but I knew inside it was all show.  Perhaps your family is a lot of bristly <br/>
show that looks rough on the outside, but hides a lot of pain on the inside.  There&#39;s some <br/>
chance that as you show a confident person, able to connect with her children instead of <br/>
cause them pain, some things will come out that may surprise you--but it may not <br/>
happen in the larger group setting.<br/>

&gt; my children &quot;get away with it&quot;. I need to learn ways to handle<br/>
&gt; confrontation and how to stand up for my children.  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>My husband has used a phrase - &quot;renting space in your head&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
That is what your birth family are doing. I say birth family because now you <br/>
have a new family - your dh and children.<br/>
<br/>
There is one big way to handle confrontation that would be the one that <br/>
worked for me for years and years with my controlling mother - less contact. <br/>
*Way* less contact.<br/>
<br/>
Especially now, while you are still learning about unschooling and making <br/>
these huge changes in your thinking and the shape of your soul, especially <br/>
now while you are processing your own childhood experiences in a different <br/>
way and discovering this new awareness, just don&#39;t spend time with your <br/>
parents and extended family.<br/>
<br/>
If it takes planning a road trip to avoid a family gathering - do it. If it <br/>
takes telling them that you are spending the next holiday with your dh&#39;s <br/>
family - do it (if that works for you).<br/>
<br/>
If it takes moving across town....well I moved from Texas to Los Angeles, <br/>
and if it wasn&#39;t LA it would have been New York.<br/>
<br/>
Don&#39;t &quot;handle confrontation&quot; - that is a negative mindset that keeps giving <br/>
the others the power to create confrontation. Instead focus on &quot;finding self <br/>
confidence&quot;.<br/>
<br/>
You DO NOT NEED their permission to care for your own family in the best way <br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
You DO NOT NEED their approval to live your own life.<br/>
<br/>
What about printing Sandra&#39;s empowerment certificate  and posting it in your <br/>
house?<br/>
<br/>
One of the things that I did when my controlling and abusive mother died a <br/>
couple of years ago was sit down for an uninterrupted few hours and wrote <br/>
about her - every memory I could muster of her childhood as she had told me, <br/>
and of mine and of recent events. 13 closely typed pages. I discovered some <br/>
patterns in my and her behaviors that were illuminating. It was also a <br/>
tremendous catharsis. In one way it made me angry - which is a better place <br/>
than feeling powerless and victimized - but I was also able to feel the <br/>
anger and come out the other side of it.<br/>
<br/>
Each story, each word was one more snip of the bad ties binding me to my <br/>
past emotions and unhealthy mindset, including removing much of the <br/>
undeserved guilt. I wish I had thought to do such an exercise when she was <br/>
alive.<br/>
<br/>
You can heal. Many of us have done so in the pursuit of a glorious <br/>
unschooling childhood for our children.<br/>

will be getting older, your confidence and experience will be  <br/>
growing, and if the relatives actually miss the kids, you might say  <br/>

I love this!  It puts into words the sense I&#39;ve been having when people talk about <br/>
&quot;confronting&quot; something or someone.  It seems like in my 20&#39;s it was really popular, and <br/>
almost expected, for people to confront things.  Was it more popular in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s or <br/>
is it just because I was hanging around other 20 year olds?<br/>

I think this would be worth printing out and posting somewhere if a<br/>
person is letting family negativity get to them!<br/>
<br/>
In my early days, I grounded myself by asking whether my child was<br/>
more important or this other family member. THAT brought me right back<br/>
to what really matters.<br/>
<br/>
When there IS some negativity (and I agree with everyone about<br/>
avoiding it) you have to ask yourself whether the negative person or<br/>
your CHILD is more important in that moment. My child wins everytime.<br/>
I feel a sense of responsibility towards my children that I do NOT<br/>
feel for other family members. <br/>
<br/>
Children need and deserve an advocate when someone spews their own<br/>
garbage all over the place. <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1921805664">The other thing that jumps out at me on the confrontation topic is this;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you can&#39;t avoid confrontation. People who say they don&#39;t<br/>
care for confrontation are sometimes hiding from the fact that the<br/>
confrontation came TO them. You aren&#39;t bringing it about when someone<br/>
dumps it right in front of you. The confrontation is there whether you<br/>
asked for it or not.<br/>
<br/>
So once the confrontation has been brought to you, it&#39;s THERE. You<br/>
can&#39;t avoid it. You can choose what to do with it though...<br/>
<br/>
You can deflect<br/>
You can ignore<br/>
You can push back<br/>
You can set some boundaries gently or not so gently<br/>
<br/>
But it&#39;s there either way. That other person decided to bring it to<br/>
you, like it or not.:)<br/>
<br/>
We were watching &quot;The Two Towers&quot; the other night. There&#39;s that<br/>
wonderful scene where Gandolf and Aragorn are trying to convince<br/>
Theoden (King of Rohan) to go out and fight rather than flee to Helm&#39;s<br/>
Deep (completely different scenario than in the book of course). <br/>
<br/>
~~Theoden: I will not risk open war.<br/>
<br/>
Aragorn: Open war is upon you whether you would risk it or not. ~~<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes confrontation is upon you whether you wish it or not. How to<br/>
handle that is a great skill to hone in my not-so-humble opinion.<br/>
Especially if you&#39;re going to buck mainstream society&#39;s ideas of<br/>
&quot;right&quot; and &quot;good&quot; and forge your own path. Best to learn how to be<br/>
very comfortable with your choices and be a strong advocate when your<br/>
children need one.<br/>

Your sister in law&#39;s mother isn&#39;t quite &quot;family&quot; in terms of  <br/>

though, they agreed by omission.   That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to  <br/>
object when something awful is done or said too.  Silence is consent  <br/>

<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;If no one else there objected to her saying &quot;shut up,&quot;  <br/>
&gt; though, they agreed by omission.   That&#39;s why it&#39;s important to  <br/>
&gt; object when something awful is done or said too.  Silence is consent  <br/>
&gt; in some cases.  Lots of cases.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Oh, they definitely agreed.  All of them except my hubby.  <br/>
<br/>
I know in Iowa some people are trying to change the compulsory school<br/>
age to 18 which I&#39;m against as well.  If schools were fun, interesting<br/>
places to be kids would stay, IMO.  I think they also passed<br/>
legislation that if a child isn&#39;t in school or hasn&#39;t turned in a cpi<br/>
form (competent private instruction, homeschoolers form) then they<br/>
aren&#39;t allowed to have a license (silly, they&#39;re not in school, now<br/>
lets keep from driving to a place of employment).  If they drop out of<br/>
school their license is revoked. <br/>
<br/>
Maybe this is too state specific for this list, but maybe it&#39;s going<br/>
on in other places too.  I just believe that teenagers have such few<br/>
rights and the government is passing legislation all the time that<br/>
they have no say in.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for the thought provoking comments (even though you<br/>
just asked to stop thanking you for them...bwg).<br/>
<br/>
In all honesty I&#39;m probably just trying to find an excuse to stay away<br/>
from those family functions!<br/>

driving is a privilege and not a right but it seems teenagers often<br/>

<br/>
Think of the people who got the BIG shaft for the mistakes of  <br/>
inexperienced teens driving late at night when they were sleepy or  <br/>
stressed over being late or whatever.  Teens can handle a year or two  <br/>
of restricted rights.<br/>
<br/>
Kirby worked until 2:00 a.m. a lot when he was first driving, but the  <br/>
law allows for returning from work.  He kept a note in the glove  <br/>
compartment telling where he worked and where he lived, so he  <br/>
wouldn&#39;t be accused of making it up on the spot.  He was never stopped.<br/>

Teenagers have more rights in most of the countries represented on  <br/>

too much about.<br/>

Hey...<br/>
<br/>
People can thank people and say the agree LOTS if they follow that  <br/>
with useful additions or more good questions. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>

away from those family functions!-=-<br/>
<br/>
#1, don&#39;t say &quot;just&quot; if you don&#39;t really mean it and<br/>
<br/>
#2, it&#39;s a reason, not an excuse, if people are saying &quot;shut up&quot; and  <br/>
such.<br/>

&lt;&lt;&lt;In my early days, I grounded myself by asking whether my  child was<br/>
more important or this other family member. THAT brought me right  back<br/>
to what really matters.&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
For some folks it isn&#39;t that cut and dried. Sometimes the &quot;history&quot; with  <br/>
family gets wrapped up in the &quot;learning unschooling&quot; and the parent wonders if  <br/>
they are projecting or imagining things to be worse than they are, sometimes  <br/>
complicated with kids who don&#39;t show much (or any) sign of being upset or  <br/>
uncomfortable *or* unaffected. Sometimes that exercise is a huge  <br/>
almost-unsolvable puzzle. Sometimes it takes time to get to know who one is  *outside* that <br/>
old, conflicted family dynamic, which again, the &quot;leave of  absence&quot; works <br/>
wonders.<br/>
 <br/>

This article was posted a long time ago, maybe on this board? Doesn&#39;t<br/>
matter really.  It&#39;s a good article that I saved a long time ago.  I<br/>
don&#39;t agree with everything said, but the general idea is a good one. <br/>
At the end of the article there is a list of various laws regarding<br/>
teens over the years and how there are more and more regulating teens<br/>
with the passing of years.<br/>
