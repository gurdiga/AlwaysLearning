<div id="ygrps-yiv-1516444631">Hi-<br/>
<br/>
I started reading about unschooling almost a year and a half ago. I got<br/>
SUPER excited and in that excitement told my husband about it. He was<br/>
not so excited. Since that time I have embraced a lot of really good<br/>
advice - I do not bring it up with him really, but have continued to<br/>
read about it daily. Our few conversations have not gone well. Around<br/>
Valentine&#39;s day this past year I wrote him a letter (I had been reading<br/>
about unschooling for about a year at this point). I let him know that<br/>
if we explore our options together I am of course willing to have our<br/>
children go to school if that is what is best for the happiness of our<br/>
family. (Thank you Sandra! I do mean that too... What I am working for<br/>
now is at least having DISCUSSION and actually exploring together).<br/>
<br/>
He read it and we haven&#39;t discussed since. This past weekend I got<br/>
really upset when he made a comment to me about not liking my ideas,<br/>
unschooling etc. This was during a &quot;discussion&quot; about something entirely<br/>
unrelated -- where to put the couch in our new apartment! So clearly it<br/>
has been building up in him. I was very hurt but we didn&#39;t discuss it<br/>
anymore.<br/>
<br/>
So today I sent him an email:<br/>
<br/>
I never addressed my &quot;joyful&quot; mood on Sunday. I thought it was pretty<br/>
obvious what made me really upset, and I have a feeling you had an<br/>
inkling. I don&#39;t want to let it slide though because my strong feelings<br/>
tend to fade and it is possible to just let things go until the &quot;next<br/>
time&quot; and it becomes a cycle without dealing with anything.<br/>
<br/>
It was not the &quot;discussion&quot; about where to put the couch that hurt me so<br/>
much. Although I think it is actually a good analogy to what IS<br/>
bothering me. I purposely do NOT bring up unschooling because I am<br/>
trying to respect that you are not ready to talk about it. But I would<br/>
think that by now you would see that it is something that means a LOT to<br/>
me and something that I am learning a lot about; I read about it almost<br/>
every day. So when you make an offhand comment about it in a very<br/>
dismissive way that really hurts. I am a very thoughtful, intelligent<br/>
person - and we both know it. I think that you are too. I wouldn&#39;t be so<br/>
enthusiastic about something that couldn&#39;t be really good for all of us.<br/>
I feel like you shut down about things that you just want to go away or<br/>
just want your way. And yes I realize that I want &quot;my&quot; way. Or at least<br/>
a lot of discussion about what that means! That is the most hurtful part<br/>
for me at this point, that you won&#39;t even talk or read or anything. I<br/>
guess you may be scared that if you even look like you are considering<br/>
it then I will be encouraged?? I KNOW doing things differently isn&#39;t<br/>
easy, and I TRULY appreciate how supportive you have been about all of<br/>
our parenting decisions so far. I think (and I think you do too) that<br/>
Marisol is amazing. I hope that we all continue to grow together and<br/>
trust each other even more.<br/>
<br/>
I LIKE thinking of different ways to do things - which is why I thought<br/>
the couch thing was a good analogy. I really am fine leaving it how you<br/>
like it -- part of the fun for me when settling a new place is trying<br/>
different things out first.<br/>
<br/>
A lot of this is a repeat of what I wrote to you in that letter on<br/>
V-day, but you have not responded and I felt like I should say something<br/>
about why I was SO upset last weekend. I think that I will also start<br/>
emailing you little things to read and I hope that you will. A lot of it<br/>
is not even &quot;unschooling&quot; per se, but about learning, or how to treat<br/>
others, or how to live your life in general!<br/>
<br/>
Here is something that I read today that I thought really made sense:<br/>
<br/>
Think about that. The kids who do best in school, who have the types of<br/>
intelligences that schools are geared toward, are going to excel in<br/>
those areas without ever setting foot in a classroom. So all they really<br/>
get from school is gold stars and A grades for doing what comes<br/>
naturally.<br/>
<br/>
And what about the kids who struggle in school? They spend all those<br/>
years feeling inadequate. Yes, some of them learn to write well, or to<br/>
enjoy reading, or to do some higher math. But can the schools take the<br/>
credit for it? After four years of unschooling, I&#39;m not convinced they<br/>
can. Maybe it&#39;s another case of a natural process coinciding with an<br/>
artificial one. And for every one of those kids who is able to adapt<br/>
himself and get the rewards of school, there is one (five? twenty? a<br/>
hundred?) who comes out of school with nothing but a self-esteem<br/>
problem. It&#39;s thirteen wasted years, years he could have spent in an<br/>
environment that valued the strengths he possesses, developing real<br/>
skills to build a life on.<br/>

<br/>
I love you so much and hope that soon we will be able to talk about this<br/>
more.<br/>
<br/>
Susan<br/>
<br/>
Then we talked on google talk (we have ALWAYS been better about writing<br/>
- messaging on the computer especially, than about talking things out in<br/>
person. It is something I would like to work on, but I am happy that at<br/>
least we communicate in SOME way)<br/>
Here  is the conversation:<br/>
Husband: what cha doing?<br/>
<br/>
Susan: writing you an email<br/>
<br/>
Husband: what?<br/>
<br/>
Susan: if you have no work to do I gave you something to chew on :-)<br/>
I felt that I should clear up my bad mood last weekend since we never<br/>
did talk about it...<br/>
<br/>
Husband: k<br/>
<br/>
Susan: I wanted to talk to you about it the next day, but I always<br/>
chicken out or it seems like the &quot;wrong&quot; time<br/>
It&#39;s not long by my normal standards either... pretty brief really (the<br/>
email) I just sent it to you<br/>
(He read the email at this point and then we messaged more)<br/>
Husband: ok<br/>
I will talk about this whenever<br/>
but I thought you would bring it up<br/>
From what I know about unschooling I don&#39;t really like it<br/>
I think the good thing about traditional school is that you learn about<br/>
everything<br/>
<br/>
Susan: I don&#39;t feel like it goes well when I bring it up - you have told<br/>
me before to just stop, that you dont&#39; want to talk about it and pretty<br/>
much just stop me<br/>
<br/>
Husband: even if you don&#39;t like something<br/>
so I am definately in favor of something more traditional<br/>
<br/>
Susan: ok<br/>
<br/>
Husband: not just letting the kid do what they want to do<br/>
if you want to home school I am okay with that<br/>
but I would like it to be structured<br/>
<br/>
Susan: I&#39;m just curious... tell me the benefit of learning about things<br/>
that you have no interest in? and how long do you think that it stays<br/>
with you?<br/>
<br/>
Husband: some type of formal system...as formal as it can be at home<br/>
because maybe you don&#39;t know that it interests you<br/>
until you learn more about it<br/>
<br/>
Susan: ok<br/>
I see what you are saying<br/>
<br/>
Husband: kids should be exposed to every possible avenue<br/>
I didn&#39;t like chemistry or biology but at least I have some basic<br/>
understanding of it<br/>
I think that is good<br/>
it is noble, scholarly and not harmful<br/>
people change so much over time<br/>
not exposing them to different topics could be harmful in my opinion<br/>
<br/>
Susan: well I am glad that you are willing to talk more about this, and<br/>
I hope that we can keep the conversations more positive... what I really<br/>
want is to talk to you about things like this and not have either of us<br/>
get overly defensive<br/>
<br/>
Husband: ok that is fine<br/>
Susan: thanks :-)<br/>
I know you only want what is best for her (and other children) and I<br/>
hope you know that that is what I want too... we just have different<br/>
ideas right now about what that is<br/>
<br/>
michaelmay21: yes I understand<br/>
I actually started crying while we were messaging each other. I think it<br/>
was such a relief to actually be discussing unschooling (or our<br/>
educational options) with him! (I am also very hormonal right now - 7<br/>
mos pregnant!) I was holding back a lot. I kind of let him get things<br/>
out - had a lot swirling in my mind as &quot;responses&quot; to his concerns - I<br/>
even started typing a few things and then deleted. I really didn&#39;t want<br/>
to &quot;screw up&quot; our first civil conversation. I already have some ideas of<br/>
things I may be able to say to try and alleviate some of his concerns.<br/>
But I also know that it will probably come across as me trying to<br/>
convince him of &quot;my way&quot;. Some examples that of things I might say:<br/>
<br/>
To this<br/>
Susan: I&#39;m just curious... tell me the benefit of learning about things<br/>
that you have no interest in? and how long do you think that it stays<br/>
with you?<br/>
<br/>
Husband:<br/>
because maybe you don&#39;t know that it interests you<br/>
until you learn more about it<br/>
I might say-<br/>
I think that strewing and the rich lives that successful unschoolers<br/>
lead pretty much negate this worry. Also I have read so much about how<br/>
one thing leads to another from so many people...<br/>
<br/>
as for this:<br/>
Husband: kids should be exposed to every possible avenue<br/>
I didn&#39;t like chemistry or biology but at least I have some basic<br/>
understanding of it<br/>
I think that is good<br/>
it is noble, scholarly and not harmful<br/>
people change so much over time<br/>
not exposing them to different topics could be harmful in my opinion<br/>
I think I remember recently Pam or someone saying something about how<br/>
even school can&#39;t open every door - no path can do that! I don&#39;t know<br/>
what to say to the &quot;noble, scholarly, and not harmful&quot;.<br/>
Oh, I guess the last line is pretty simple - Unschooler do expose their<br/>
kids to lots of different things!<br/>
<br/>
I think I am suddenly seeing one of his misconceptions - that<br/>
&quot;unstructured = kids do whatever they want&quot; and that parents are not <br/>
influencing what they are doing in their lives at all.<br/>
<br/>
I also pretty  much know that I don&#39;t want to homeschool the way he was<br/>
saying... I agree with the idea that &quot;school at home&quot; is probably more<br/>
harmful to our relationships than plain old school. Plus I was a teacher<br/>
and that is not what I would want to do! I just let it go for now...<br/>
<br/>
Ok, this is getting long. I really wanted input -- where do people think<br/>
I should go from here? I think this was a HUGE step for us and I want to<br/>
really think through things I say/do from here.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
Susan<br/>

Maybe a copy of &quot;Dumbing us Down?&quot;<br/>
Maybe now that you have his concerns in writing you could be on the  <br/>
lookout for studies that show American high school grads can&#39;t find  <br/>
other countries on a map and things like that.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe casually, conversationally (if that can happen, and if you can  <br/>
be willing to bail if he catches on) you could talk about what you do  <br/>
or don&#39;t remember from high school chemistry or physics or biology  <br/>
classes.   Maybe he would volunteer what he does or doesn&#39;t  <br/>
remember.   It might get him to thinking about what he does remember.<br/>
<br/>
And the &quot;everything&quot; they teach in school is a teeny subset of  <br/>
&quot;everything.&quot;  There are many topics school never touches and never  <br/>
will, and those they do &quot;touch&quot; get the lightest of one- or two-week  <br/>
unit and then it&#39;s on to something else.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1616578405">I may have missed this, but is he<br/>
willing to read?  Alfie Kohn summarizes<br/>
tons of educational research that talks<br/>
about how many of the aspects of school<br/>
inhibit/discourage learning.<br/>
The book, _The Game of School:  Why We<br/>
All Play It, How It Hurts Kids, and <br/>
What It Will Take to Change It_ might<br/>
be convincing.  The author, Robert Fried,<br/>
is a school psychologist, so he is a<br/>
proponent of schools.  Yet, both professionally<br/>
and personally (one of his own children<br/>
struggled mightily in school), he has seen<br/>
the system shred kids, and he writes about<br/>
that.  The stories he tells are so heart-<br/>
wrenching that it is hard to remember that<br/>
the guy is a part of the system he is <br/>
criticizing.<br/>
<br/>
Also, would he be willing to agree to a<br/>
short trial of unschooling?  That is how<br/>
our family began homeschooling.  My DH<br/>
was reluctant, but was willing to give<br/>
a try, &quot;for a semester.&quot;  That semester<br/>
was so good that he was willing to let<br/>
us try the &quot;experiment&quot; for another <br/>
semester, and another...<br/>
<br/>
Maybe it&#39;s too huge a leap for somebody<br/>
who&#39;s having a hard time even talking<br/>
about it, but sometimes it&#39;s easier<br/>
to do than to talk.  One semester would<br/>
give you something to talk about, other<br/>
than your fears.  It would give you a <br/>
real experience to discuss.  And even<br/>
if he is afraid, what is going to be lost<br/>
in one semester?  <br/>

quit school because the pace of the teaching was so slow compared to<br/>
what I knew was possible it was like watching grass grow. My<br/>
intention was to get him through the school curriculum more<br/>
efficiently. But he didn&#39;t want lessons of any kind, so, figuring he<br/>
was only seven and could always catch up later if he fell behind in<br/>
any subject, my wife and I gave him a year off to do his own thing.<br/>
That was more than six years ago. He never returned to a structured<br/>
education. He&#39;s been too busy learning immersively at the speed of<br/>
thought.<br/>
