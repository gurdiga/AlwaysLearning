<div id="ygrps-yiv-300054212">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Riley had the candy bar when I got to practice yesterday. He then told me that what he said the day before was actually a lie. That he really did swim under all the lanes without a breath. I smiled and let him know I understand he wanted to be able to swim under all the lane lines and then talked about all the skills he learned this summer and how hard it has been to swim when it&#39;s cold. I let go any lecture about the wrongs of cheating. He enjoyed his chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
Now a little bit more info. Riley loves winning, tantrums over losing. Riley cheats to win many games he plays, tantrums when anyone else cheats. Riley has lots of the characteristics of the kids in the book The Explosive Child. He challenges me beyond what I ever imagined parenting to be. At 6.5, I still can pretty much take him by his hand and guide him. Though I see much honesty and compassion from him, I also see cruel and dishonest moments. He worries me, alot.<br/>
<br/>
Last night we saw some teens going towards Rileys bike out in the grass. They were bending over to pick it up. To check it out or take? I do not know. I casually talked loudly and tols Riley to remember to get his bike. The boys put the bike down and split, straight away from me bolt. This openned the doors for a very gentle discussion of the rights of people, honesty, stealing. He was very receptive having the image of his own bike possibly taken. I think he understood. We will have to see how his actions are. I&#39;ll let you all know.<br/>

Thank you all for the helpful feedback.</div>

Hi, Mary --<br/>
<br/>
I have twin nephews that are now 17.  When they were sixish they would <br/>
both have big sobbing outbursts and run out of the room when they lost a <br/>
game.  (I wouldn&#39;t quite call that a tantrum.)<br/>
<br/>
I just visited them this week and went back-to-school shopping with them <br/>
and they are both totally sweet and well behaved.  (Trying on clothes <br/>
often makes ME feel like having a tantrum.)  They are honor students, <br/>
boy scouts, nice to their mom and their relatives, very well behaved and <br/>
don&#39;t even stay out late.  (They are in public school.)<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to say that not every six year old who hates to lose will <br/>
come to a bad end.  :-)<br/>
<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-707743059">My Levi who just turned nine the other day hated to<br/>
lose. Still does. We talk lots about being a good<br/>
sport and what that means. He is a stomper even for<br/>
being told no. I think it is some kids personality. My<br/>
third son Jessy , who is 12, climbed a tree to get a<br/>
soccerball for some kids they were playing with. Levi<br/>
was angry because Jessy got the ball before he could..<br/>
&quot;I just wanted to be man of the hour&quot;. I have never<br/>
used that expression and do not dub winners and losers<br/>
in our family. Levi has a very strong personality and<br/>
I have times of being worried about him too.  He is<br/>
also a tender heart and when you get down to it he is<br/>
very gentle and kind. I am trying to really focus on<br/>
that side of his nature. Thank him when he is<br/>
including of his little sister. Tell him how much I<br/>
appreciate how he handles a situation when he keep<br/>
control of his temper. Levi is also prone to making<br/>
stories up to make himself look better. He is also the<br/>
kid who walked back to shore seven times as the boys<br/>
went ahead to help his next youngest sister who kept<br/>
changing her mind if she was brave enough to wade. He<br/>
never lost patience or said enough. They,the boys,<br/>
were quite far ahead when I said go on to him she was<br/>
not going to make it today. Keep faith in his goodness<br/>
and trust yourself and him to help him be his best<br/>
self. <br/>

Kirby, same (except the honor student part).<br/>
HORRIBLE to play games with when he was little, and now so civilized that <br/>
people (adults) will come to our house several days a week to ask if he will play <br/>
games with them.  All KINDS of games--collectible card stuff, D&D, video, <br/>
old-time poker...<br/>
<br/>
I guess he got it out of his system early and now is gracious whether he wins <br/>
or loses.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I think it is really amazing, though, how he ended up with gaming being <br/>
such a huge part of his life.  Roxana&#39;s inability to handle game <br/>
playing made me really sad, because my dh and I both really love to <br/>
play games, but playing with her was always pretty miserable.<br/>
<br/>
She&#39;s 15 now and is fine - no more outbursts like she used to have over <br/>
games.<br/>
