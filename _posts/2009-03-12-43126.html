<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010639226">This next paragraph is from a page I&#39;ve just tweaked (added another  <br/>
link, reformatted a little):<br/>
<br/>
There is a danger in living an entirely reactionary life.  If you do  <br/>
everything the opposite of what your  mom did, it&#39;s as bad as doing  <br/>
exactly what your mom did without knowing why.  Be discriminating and  <br/>
thoughtful.  Don&#39;t chuck the ghost of the baby you were out with the  <br/>
bathwater of your emotional memories.<br/>
