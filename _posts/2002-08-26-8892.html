<div id="ygrps-yiv-1624764869">Hi,<br/>
I went to the video game session at the recent HSC conference and as Dan spoke,<br/>
I realized I did sort of have that prejudice against video games in favor of<br/>
computer games.  Mostly, I think, because I was just resistant to buying another<br/>
machine.<br/>
<br/>
But after some thought, now I&#39;m wanting to buy one.  I can see lots of<br/>
opportunities to use it and new games for all of us  to play.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter, 11, will be the main user (or maybe I will be!) and I sure could<br/>
use some help deciding which machine to get.  I&#39;m hoping to make a birthday<br/>
purchase this week.  As far as games, I think she&#39;d like Harvest Moon and Zelda<br/>
from what I&#39;ve seen and heard.  And I don&#39;t really know what other games are out<br/>
there that she might like.<br/>
<br/>
We bought a Game Boy Color awhile back and  it never did get much play.  Any<br/>
help, suggestions would certainly be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>

There are no simple answers. There are many reasons to get a particular<br/>
console. When I asked my son and his friend, there first response &quot;what do<br/>
they want to do with it? What kind of games do they want to play?&quot; so I<br/>
asked if you can categorize what kind of games go with each console. At<br/>
first that seemed an easy task, but within 30 seconds or so, there was much<br/>
disagreement  and no clear answer came of it.<br/>
<br/>
If I were looking to buy a console, I would research the web to get a<br/>
starting point, figure out which games you want to play and rent or borrow<br/>
them. The game and the console. Here in southern California Blockbuster<br/>
rents them. This way you get to take take them home and pretend you just<br/>
spent a lot of money on the purchase and see if it was worthwhile. You also<br/>
have the ability to look at the game racks knowing that only the games for<br/>
&quot;your&quot; one console are available to you. See what fits the best.<br/>
<br/>
Here are some links that might help:<br/>
<br/>
Yahoo always seems to be a good starting point for me.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://dir.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Video_Games/">http://dir.yahoo.com/Recreation/Games/Video_Games/</a><br/>
<br/>
This is a good beginning to think about which console article.<br/>

<br/>
This has brief descriptions of each console. Also brief game reviews by<br/>
console.<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.thecgn.net/new.shtml">http://www.thecgn.net/new.shtml</a><br/>
<br/>
Many reviews. Games listed with review index to many review sites. So if you<br/>
look under PlayStation 2 for ICO, the game Kathy&#39;s son demonstrated at that<br/>
session, there will be links to 18 different reviews.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1567410756">You can also just go to Walmart or Target or Toys &#39;R Us (someone add typical <br/>
California locations if necessary) where they have demo stations, and you can <br/>
play whatever game they have plugge into it.  There will probably be a <br/>
Nintendo booth and a playstation, where the controller is fastened to a bar <br/>
from the wall, and you can stand there and play a while.<br/>
<br/>
And then if they love something or other or prefer one you could rent a <br/>
system.  Where I am you can rent them at Hastings.<br/>
