&lt;&lt; Definitely my favorite unschooling board... no offense to this list :) &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
This is a list, that&#39;s a forum.  A forum sits where it is and people come by <br/>
and post or read, and it can have permanent parts like the library at <br/>
www.unschooling.com.<br/>
<br/>
A forum is a website.<br/>
<br/>
A list arrives by e-mail.  Only people on the list see the list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Yahoogroups kinda blurs that line by giving us a place to leave photos and <br/>
files, and having an archive.  But e-mail lists (even with jazzy &quot;home <br/>
pages&quot;) aren&#39;t the same as the-plural-of-forum.<br/>
<br/>
To some people it doesn&#39;t matter. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
To me it does.  I don&#39;t know why.<br/>
