&lt;&lt;So what happens if the child says it more than once?? That sounds <br/>
like a mother with a newborn saying &quot;my child is never going to cuss <br/>
or hit me, I won&#39;t let them!&quot; &gt;&gt;<br/>
Im on Digest this week so this maybe late.<br/>
I have never had one of my kids tell me to *shut up*(I have four). But then <br/>
again its not a set of words used here.  <br/>
A mother of a newborn IMO isn&#39;t far from age 6. Id say the child has been <br/>
around someone who says it. <br/>
Im trying to think of times where I have heard &quot;shut up&quot; in a positive <br/>
way....thinking......Nope, none that I can think of...<br/>
  My thoughts are that I wouldn&#39;t tell my child to shut up anymore than I <br/>
wanted to be told to shut up.  Is the child in so many situations that he&#39;s just <br/>
feeling forced endure places and conversations that just suck/boring or are no <br/>
fun for him? If the child&#39;s feelings are being respected why does he feel <br/>
such frustration?<br/>
