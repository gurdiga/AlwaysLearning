 I too only heard &quot;jerry-rigged&quot; till I moved to the big city. I <br/>
 wonder though if &quot;jerry&quot; is somehow a euphamism for the n-word.  &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
No. From what I understand of the origins, it is simply a wrong pronunciation <br/>
for &quot;Jury rigged&quot;.<br/>
Jury rigged is the correct slang term, not jerry rigged.<br/>
It&#39;s meaning is fairly obvious.....so I won&#39;t explain that one!! :)<br/>
