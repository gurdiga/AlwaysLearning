<br/>
Thank you, thank you, so much for the information... I needed to hear what<br/>
you had to say to realize that it&#39;s gradual and in time I will be more<br/>
comfortable with what I&#39;m doing....  On to read what others are saying.<br/>

Unschooled kids are also making a model of the universe inside them, but<br/>
<br/>
they&#39;re making it their own way, and they&#39;re not valuing the school-bits<br/>
over<br/>
<br/>
the bits that their model has which are unique to them and their own<br/>
personal<br/>
<br/>
interests and experiences  - Sandra<br/>
