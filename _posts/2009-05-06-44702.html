<div id="ygrps-yiv-1747875660">Very off topic...   Next time, write something useful to go with your  <br/>
off-topic request so the post itself won&#39;t be off topic.<br/>
<br/>
Talk about how your kids use Lego, or if you&#39;ve been to Legoland tell  <br/>
what was coolest about it, and then I won&#39;t care about the request,  <br/>
but I really don&#39;t want the list to turn to side discussions.<br/>
<br/>
And I might have a ticket.  Marty got the legoland magazine  <br/>
yesterday.  Did you read fine print to see if one family can use more  <br/>
than one freebie ticket?<br/>
<br/>
Marty went to Legland with a group of homeschoolers once.  Even though  <br/>
he was &quot;old&quot; (16?) he had a blast and told us stories for weeks, and  <br/>
would talk about the photos I could find with excitement, no matter  <br/>
how much time had passed.<br/>
<br/>
Marty has quite a bit of nice Lego, and there were visiting kids  <br/>
recently who were excited to see his Viking ship all put together, and  <br/>
they played with it for a while, and augmented it a bit, but Marty  <br/>
doesn&#39;t mind.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Sorry about that, we do love legos.  I think one thing I like best about them is that they span ages so well.  Older kids and adults can play with younger ones very easily, building together, having a common activity.  When our two youngest were first adopted, all our kids spent hours building together, bonding over legos.<br/>
