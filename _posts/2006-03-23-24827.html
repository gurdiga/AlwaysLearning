<div id="ygrps-yiv-1047978808">Hello,  I am a fairly new member.  I have been following the<br/>
discussion on reading....and was waiting to hear from anyone who has a<br/>
tween who is just beginning to read...My son is eleven years old and<br/>
we have tried all sorts of approaches, the first being to wait it out,<br/>
unschooling, you could say.  there came a point, around eight, where<br/>
his self-esteem was so low because he could see that others his age<br/>
could read and he wasn&#39;t.  Because he expressed an interest in<br/>
learning, we finally did the 100 lessons to teach your child to read.<br/>
 He and my husband did it at bedtime...they &quot;stuck it out&quot; (I&#39;ve been<br/>
also reading the posting on learning and teaching) and did get to the<br/>
end of the book.  He was able to recognize all his letters but still<br/>
couldn&#39;t remember most words, even the simplest, and seemed to do a<br/>
lot of guessing.  Then last summer, I finally gave in, and attending<br/>
the Orton Gillingham workshop at our Minnesota Homeschooling<br/>
Conference.  I had been avoiding it because it sounded so horrible and<br/>
tedious.  Turned out to be just the thing for my son.  They teach to a<br/>
kid&#39;s strengths and they go slowly.  I have read things about<br/>
dyslexia, which &quot;label&quot; I have also been avoiding for all the years of<br/>
my teacher training and mothering, and some of the things I read fit<br/>
my experience of my son...he is exceedinly creative and inventive.  So<br/>
we&#39;ve been using an Orton-Gillingham tutor (paid for, thank goodness,<br/>
by a sister-in-law who was adamant that my son should seek<br/>
professional help).  The tutor, Barbara, is a sweetheart who actually<br/>
homeschools one of her kids for part of the year, and I have watched<br/>
my son&#39;s confidence build as he has learned to recognize more and more<br/>
words and has applied his learning to his &quot;My Space&quot; e-mail messages.  <br/>
He&#39;s getting a little tired of the tutoring these days, twice a week<br/>
for an hour, and so we are discussing other options like being more<br/>
consistent working with me....but I must say, I am not in a big hurry<br/>
to discontinue this tutor.  <br/>
<br/>
Now I suspect that all this flies in the face of everything<br/>
unschoolers stand for.  I &quot;waited it out&quot; and coudn&#39;t stand seeing my<br/>
son suffer any longer not knowing how to read, not even wanting to<br/>
open a book and look at words.  <br/>
<br/>
I am posting this message because I would like to know if there are<br/>
others out there in the Unschooling community who have had similar<br/>
experiences...and I am certainly open to hearing from people who might<br/>
disagree with the route we took and want to voice that.  Thanks. Mary</div>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-135489444">My son is almost 13 and is just now reading.  He went to Kindergarten for a few months and went from a kid who LOVED having a stack of books read each day to a kid who didn&#39;t let me even read to him for over 2 years.  We waited.  He played video games that required a bit of reading and got tired of waiting for me to walk in from the kitchen to read whatever he needed to be read.  He got to where he recognized a few words and that grew.  He still mainly sight reads and if there are more than a few sentences it overwhelms him.  I don&#39;t think it is a &quot;reading&quot; issue but rather a neurological issue...he is extremely antsy, understands visual-spatial things that are in motion in an uncanny way, has mixed dominance neurologically, etc..<br/>
<br/>
Each year he has learned more and more.  I don&#39;t know if he will ever read for pleasure but he is able to read for information at this point.<br/>
<br/>
If my kid was really wanting to read, if they were upset, I would ask if they wanted me to try to help them.  I would do it just like I would help them learn to ride a bike or bake a cake.  It would be fun, it would be just another thing we do.<br/>

something wrong about not be able to read at 8? How did you respond?<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; the first being to wait it out<br/>

 </span></blockquote>It isn&#39;t at all unusual, especially for boys, not to be reading at 8.  <br/>
So becoming concerned at 8 isn&#39;t &quot;waiting it out.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
In principle (for others with younger kids who are worried)  <br/>
confidence that kids *will* read and reassurances that the child  <br/>
*will* read when his brain is ready for it are much better than  <br/>
trying different reading methods. *Especially* if the child isn&#39;t  <br/>
ready to read. A reading method will very likely convince the child  <br/>
that there&#39;s something wrong with him if he even fails with  <br/>
professional reading methods. :-/<br/>
<br/>
The best thing to do is ask other unschoolers, especially on big  <br/>
lists! Ask what their experiences are. Get feedback on what other  <br/>
unschoolers have done in the same situation.<br/>

<br/>
Some kids want to ride a bike at 5 but they just don&#39;t have the right  <br/>
brain/body connections to do it no matter how hard they try. Until  <br/>
those connections are ready, they just can&#39;t. And being upset at not  <br/>
being able to ride is like being upset with a broken leg for not  <br/>
working properly.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s the same with reading. Until all the brain areas involved in  <br/>
reading are mature, it&#39;s just not going to happen.<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Then last summer, I finally gave in<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>So he was only 10 when you gave in. 10 is *still* too early to worry.  <br/>
If a child is bothered at 8, I&#39;d find out why then I&#39;d give him lots  <br/>
of reassurance to build his confidence. I&#39;d pass on stories from  <br/>
other unschooled kids so he&#39;d know he wasn&#39;t the only one. We need to  <br/>
work against nonsensical schoolish messages that just aren&#39;t true.  <br/>
There&#39;s no reason an 8 yo who isn&#39;t reading should be reading. He  <br/>
*shouldn&#39;t* have been concerned that he couldn&#39;t read at 10.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m glad you found something that worked for him *but* since he was  <br/>
down *at 8* (which is early for reading for boys anyway) it sounds  <br/>
like he didn&#39;t have a positive supportive environment that would have  <br/>
allowed him to know he would read when he was ready.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>And when the brain areas involved are mature, it is just going to  <br/>
happen, if the child is surrounded by opportunity.<br/>
UNLESS...  unless he has been traumatized and filled with fear and  <br/>
shame and he comes to avoid the printed word, to freeze up when  <br/>
reading opportunities arise.  School is GREAT at creating lifetime  <br/>
non-readers.  Unschoolers who begin early enough not to shame,  <br/>
pressure, label, measure and &quot;teach&quot; can&#39;t produce a lifetime non- <br/>
reader.<br/>
<br/>
When Holly wasn&#39;t reading we had the embarrassment and frustration  <br/>
that comes from others looking at each other with the &quot;unschooling  <br/>
doesn&#39;t work&quot; look, but because she was the third and the boys were  <br/>
reading and she was clearly intelligent and verbal, I knew it would  <br/>
happen.  It did.  And when it clicked for her, her vocabulary was  <br/>
already extensive and acrobatic.  She didn&#39;t need to limit herself to  <br/>
&quot;first grade words.&quot;  Once the system worked for her, she read five  <br/>
syllable words as easily as &quot;hop on pop.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I think some people assume that for every reader there is a year of  <br/>
baby books, then first grade books, and a year of second grade books  <br/>
before they can read chapter books.   I think that might be true at  <br/>
school, but it&#39;s an indication that those children are &quot;doing reading  <br/>
lessons,&quot; which is not always even NEARLY the same as reading.  Many  <br/>
schoolkids are getting B&#39;s or C&#39;s in reading at school but cannot  <br/>
read in the real world.  They can only read from the carefully  <br/>
engineered-to-be-simple things they&#39;ve already heard discussed, and  <br/>
from the limited vocabulary the authors of their reading lessons put  <br/>
in.  Short words are substituted for longer words.  Sentences are  <br/>
short.  Sentences are small.  We play at it.  We play at reading.    <br/>
Children do not think.  They do not fly.  Words do not flow.  Blah  <br/>
blah blah blah.<br/>
<br/>
Holly didn&#39;t read during that &quot;phase.&quot;  Her first reading was Harry  <br/>
Potter cards, Judy Blume and Stephen King.<br/>
