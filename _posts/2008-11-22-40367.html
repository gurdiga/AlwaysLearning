<div id="ygrps-yiv-827271395">Congratulations on the 7th Anniversary! <br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a little late to the party; I just joined this group today! I am also on<br/>
a few other groups, but all just since June of this year as we are new to<br/>
unschooling. I had read some stuff about it (felt like it sort of followed<br/>
the path I was on with Attachment Parenting, Unconditional/Peaceful/Playful<br/>
Parenting, and such) and a friend convinced me to go to the Life Is Good<br/>
Conference here in Portland (well, it&#39;s across the river in Vancouver, but<br/>
close enough!) in May and I just loved it. :) The atmosphere was wonderful<br/>
as were the many people I met there.<br/>
 <br/>
In an effort to get more of that vibe and influence in my life, I joined a<br/>
few online groups. First one, then another, now I think I am on 5 such<br/>
groups! And I can&#39;t believe I didn&#39;t join this one right away, but I sort of<br/>
felt like as a newbie I wasn&#39;t ready for the big leagues! Mostly I just read<br/>
in the beginning. That&#39;s what the instructions said to do. I read a lot. I<br/>
didn&#39;t post right away because I didn&#39;t want to seem ignorant or have people<br/>
tear my words apart. Often other people asked what I wanted to ask and I<br/>
learned from the dialogue that followed. But now (I know, amazingly in just<br/>
a few short months!), now I am very comfortable with the vibe of most lists<br/>
where the majority of posters are passionate about unschooling and ask the<br/>
really hard questions of us newbies (which we need). I&#39;m sure many of those<br/>
people are also on this list too.<br/>
 <br/>
I am always learning, so I think this is a good place for me.<br/>
 <br/>
However, in my journey I am facing a new problem. After the conference, I<br/>
had a desire to meet other unschoolers in real life. I wanted more positive<br/>
interactions than just at the conference! I had met some people there, but I<br/>
knew there had to be other families in the area, some I didn&#39;t meet and<br/>
others who didn&#39;t even attend LIG. So I sought out my local unschoolers<br/>
list. And I am disappointed. It is not anything like these<br/>
national/international lists. <br/>
 <br/>
Here is where I complain. There are a few (very few) people on this local<br/>
board who seem to &quot;get it&quot; but many more who don&#39;t. It&#39;s like a bunch of<br/>
homeschoolers have latched on to the term unschooling and think it only<br/>
means that they do not use a set curriculum in their school at home. For<br/>
them it does not extend to their lives, to parenting, or in general<br/>
respecting their kids. Maybe they think it does, or maybe they think it<br/>
doesn&#39;t have to. The vibe of some recent posts is basically a few women<br/>
(mostly with younger children) telling everyone how they live with certain<br/>
structures, controls, and limits for their kids and basically saying that&#39;s<br/>
what works for their family so don&#39;t question it. I made the mistake of<br/>
questioning some of these things and seriously people came out of the<br/>
woodwork to tell me off! They have rules for everything. No TV (or very<br/>
limited in time they were allowed to watch and some limited the shows their<br/>
kids were allowed to watch), bedtime at 8:30 sharp, lunch at noon, no sugar<br/>
in the house, and more. Sugar and TV seem to be BIG and I mean HUGE things<br/>
that people were very defensive about. Saying that because they have<br/>
&quot;reasons&quot; for limiting such things it is not arbitrary and who are we to<br/>
question what is working for them. (Um, because this is an UNschooling group<br/>
and you are NOT unschooling?!)<br/>
 <br/>
Is this common in smaller local groups? I am so sad that I am not getting to<br/>
meet other similar minded folks. Well, that is not true. I had one ally (who<br/>
has older children and much more experience than me with this) who asked the<br/>
same questions I did and even went deeper into an explanation of things like<br/>
cause and effect and how they can&#39;t see now what they are teaching their<br/>
children. She got blasted more than I did! It got ugly. So I called her up<br/>
and we met with our kids and had a great time. So at least one good thing<br/>
has come of this! One new friend!! <br/>
 <br/>
Just wondering what to do now. I suppose I should just stop reading over<br/>
there. Yeah, tell me the obvious. Anyway, I&#39;m here to learn! I&#39;ve got some<br/>
issues ya&#39;ll can help me with as no one else I know seems to be able to<br/>
relate! I just didn&#39;t want to dump it all out there on Day 1. :p<br/>
 <br/>
My name is Kim, DH (since 93) is Geoff, and our son is Damon (4). We live in<br/>
Hillsboro, Oregon, just on the west side of Portland. We&#39;ve lived here 8<br/>
years and I do not have a hometown, my dad was active military so I have<br/>
lived in many states and seen most of this great country of ours.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for the online community.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-859273760">-=-So I sought out my local unschoolers<br/>
list. And I am disappointed. It is not anything like these<br/>

<br/>
This is discussion, though.  There are people here who might  <br/>
disappoint you in person.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s like a bunch of homeschoolers have latched on to the term  <br/>

curriculum in their school at home. For them it does not extend to  <br/>
their lives, to parenting, or in general respecting their kids. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the other edge of unschooling.  It&#39;s unschooling.  It&#39;s not  <br/>
the kind of unschooling that creates the results radical unschoolers  <br/>
are getting.  They&#39;ll end up with the same bad relationships with  <br/>
their teens, and maybe the kids will decide they&#39;d rather go to  <br/>
school than stay home, because there won&#39;t be the same warmth and  <br/>
acceptance.  The parents are not as likely to have the depth of  <br/>
compassion they would have for their kids if they didn&#39;t have the  <br/>
overlay of a checklist of missed chores and broken rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The vibe of some recent posts is basically a few women (mostly  <br/>
with younger children) telling everyone how they live with certain  <br/>
structures, controls, and limits for their kids and basically saying  <br/>
that&#39;s what works for their family so don&#39;t question it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When people say they don&#39;t want to be questioned, or they want to be  <br/>
&quot;respected&quot; or that all parents should support all other parents,  <br/>
they&#39;re not ready for any sort of philosophical discussion.  The kind  <br/>
of unschooling we discuss here is based in principles, and those  <br/>
can&#39;t be discussed or understood without the willingness to change  <br/>
and examine one&#39;s thoughts.  That&#39;s what philosophy  is, looking at  <br/>
beliefs and how beliefs affect thought, words and actions.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t change those other people, but we can provide discussion of  <br/>
beliefs, though, language and action.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is this common in smaller local groups? I am so sad that I am not  <br/>
getting to meet other similar minded folks.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are very rare.  Good unschoolers are even rarer.  Yes,  <br/>
this group is pretty damned special. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just wondering what to do now. I suppose I should just stop  <br/>
reading over there. Yeah, tell me the obvious. Anyway, I&#39;m here to  <br/>
learn!-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you can read that other one without frustration, maybe you could  <br/>
at least recommend webpages or other lists occasionally, for the  <br/>
benefit of the undecided.  And honestly, if those families have  <br/>
younger kids and they&#39;re not going to commit to unschooling at such a  <br/>
depth that it will really stick, they&#39;ll probably be moving toward a  <br/>
curriculum before long or putting kids in school.  Some will want to  <br/>
move further into unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I quit a statewide yahoogroup that I  myself had formed and owned  <br/>
because I got jumped on for saying one unschooling thing in a year.    <br/>
I was doing them a favor to  keep that list operational and  <br/>
advertised, and the one time I wanted to defend unschoolers I got  <br/>
pounded by newish-to-homeschooling know-nothings.  I&#39;d bet any amount  <br/>
of money that all their kids have been in school for years now and  <br/>
that they&#39;re spending their time complaining with other parents about  <br/>
how hard it is to be a parent.  My kids, meanwhile, are sweet and  <br/>
present and tell me they love me.<br/>

Have the people on  your local list gotten this support link?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2020775226">Yes, it is hard to find other radical unschoolers :)  On my local<br/>
unschooling list, someone was advocating spanking at one point in the<br/>
not too distant past.<br/>
<br/>
I ended up starting a regional group for radical unschoolers last<br/>
summer and I think it is going well.  It is a Washington group, but we<br/>
have some people just over the borders (B.C. and Portland, mainly).  I<br/>
think there are two or three people in Portland or Vancouver.    It<br/>
might be a good match for you:<br/>

The good thing about that site is that there are photos, and there&#39;s  <br/>
humor, and it can be way chit-chatty.   For those who like the more  <br/>
personal details, those ning sites have the potential to bring a  <br/>
whole different aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Another thing to consider is blogs.  It&#39;s not the same as having kids  <br/>
for your kids to play with, but they could potentially lead to that  <br/>
(road trips/visits).<br/>

Thanks for that link, I&#39;m going to check it out.  I unsubbed from the<br/>
local list because of the hostility and fear based parenting being<br/>
presented there.  It&#39;s like this for me, if it&#39;s not happy making, turn<br/>
toward what is, just turn around and face the other direction.  For me,<br/>
the only way to not get sucked back into that was to unsub, with mixed<br/>
feelings, but ultimately, if those folks aren&#39;t digging radical<br/>
unschooling, do I really want to be chummy with them, in person, if they<br/>
are so mean online?<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>I just started one specific for our area, so you can search Portland,<br/>
you will find it.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s all local specific stuff above, so I&#39;ll just add this....<br/>
<br/>
In general, with all things, if something is causing fear and anxiety<br/>
and you turn away from that and towards what is happy, everyone in your<br/>
family will benefit.  Not one single person in this whole wide world can<br/>
be convinced that unschooling will work and work fabulously, unless they<br/>
really want it!  I&#39;m not going to convince a meat eater to become a<br/>
vegetarian unless they were considering it to begin with!   If someone<br/>
is stuck in their belief that controlling kids is the only way to raise<br/>
kids, then gosh darn it, they will do that and lots of it and come up<br/>
with all sorts of arguments to convince me it&#39;s the case!  And, no,<br/>
anecdotal information doesn&#39;t count to counter their belief system, as<br/>
so much of the information on unschooling is anecdotal.<br/>
<br/>
I was re-reading &quot;How Children Learn&quot;, last night, partly to recharge my<br/>
thinking, and was once again intrigued by his thinking.  I really liked<br/>
what he was saying about studies done on children, and his conviction<br/>
that anecdotal information is often more reliable, even if you are going<br/>
off of someone&#39;s word or interpretation, because, studies done on<br/>
children inherently take them out of their natural environment, while an<br/>
observational study won&#39;t.  Well, that&#39;s what I got out of it when I was<br/>
reading last night, others may have another take on this idea.<br/>
<br/>
So many studies done on children are skewed in the perspective on the<br/>
maker of the study.  Not only that, they are done on school children,<br/>
and I see a huge huge difference in how my always unschooled children<br/>
are and how they behave and interact with the world!  A long time ago,<br/>
Sandra, said that unschooled children are like the control group.  I<br/>
like that!  How can so many studies on children, not have a control<br/>
group?!  Staticians don&#39;t even see school in that manner affecting<br/>
studies and outcomes of those studies!<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-658754685">I&#39;ve found unschoolers who apply the principles to their whole lives  <br/>
especially far and few between.  It&#39;s sweet when that happens, but in  <br/>
the meantime I&#39;ve learned not to bemoan that, and to put the energy  <br/>
into my kids and family.<br/>
<br/>
A few days ago I was on a panel (for school options that a local  <br/>
small private school put on); I spoke on unschooling.  I went into it  <br/>
(naively) thinking that people would be so jazzed about unschooling.   <br/>
I was thinking along the lines of what Jenny said, &quot;To me,  <br/>
unschooling is so happy and cool, I mean, how could that not be  <br/>
contagious!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now, I get that perhaps I need better public speaking skills, so that  <br/>
might&#39;ve been part of the problem.  But I saw people get so excited  <br/>
about charter schools and school at home with a curriculum.   I heard  <br/>
people who homeschool with a curriculum say, &quot;We unschool part of the  <br/>
time.&quot;  Huh???<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve met Sandra&#39;s kids and Pam&#39;s kids and others; they clearly walk  <br/>
their talk.  My kids and I were just talking yesterday about how much  <br/>
fun Marty is... we were reminiscing about the killer game we played  <br/>
at Life is Good (unschooling conference) a year and a half ago.  We  <br/>
were comparing it to a game we had played yesterday with some kids  <br/>
who were so busy controlling what everyone was doing that they often  <br/>
missed our teammates going in to capture the flag.  Ironically, the  <br/>
loudest kid complaining about things was kid whose mom says &quot;We&#39;re  <br/>
unschoolers&quot;, but the kids go to school two days a week.<br/>
<br/>
Discussion on this list gives me plenty to think about and apply and  <br/>
I&#39;m so lucky to be here.<br/>
<br/>
Many many thanks to Sandra for collecting all that she has over the  <br/>
years, I&#39;ve used her site and herself for so much invaluable  <br/>
information.  Happy Seventh Anniversary.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1838363568">Thanks Gwen! I didn&#39;t think it would matter that much how people are raising<br/>
their children, and most of the time it really doesn&#39;t, but it does when I<br/>
am looking on an unschooling group for comeraderie and not getting it. In<br/>
fact, getting the opposite with hostile treatment, name calling, and lots of<br/>
defensiveness about how it&#39;s OK for them to limit certain things and not OK<br/>
for anyone else to question that.<br/>
 <br/>
I&#39;m a little overwhelmed with &quot;lists&quot; at the moment, but I think I will go<br/>
ahead and join yours and perhaps unjoin the other one (not sure yet, but for<br/>
the moment I am not reading or commenting there). I need to go where people<br/>
are happy like Jenny says! And I kind of wondered if that conversation on<br/>
our local board would separate the RUs from the &quot;others&quot; and I might find<br/>
some of you here! Now I just need to figure out a way to meet some more of<br/>
you IRL! Join Jenny&#39;s Portland group on ning too. :)<br/>

I&#39;ve thought about creating a radical unschooling group for my area, but<br/>
there was already a local unschooling group and it seemed kind of obnoxious<br/>
to start yet another group.<br/>
<br/>
But after reading this week, I decided I was ok with being obnoxious :-)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-679398902">Thank you Sandra. Jenny was trying to explain how what they are doing now<br/>
will not translate into good relationships with their kids once they are<br/>
teenagers, and they just didn&#39;t want to hear it. You can lead a horse to<br/>
water (they did join the group!) but you can&#39;t make him drink.<br/>
 <br/>
My reason for joining the local group was mainly to meet other like minded<br/>
parents IRL, to expand my social circle to include some unschoolers. But in<br/>
conversations on the board I found that we were NOT like minded and<br/>
therefore I had no desire to go to any of the meetups where I could have met<br/>
some new friends. I already have friends who are raising their kids in all<br/>
sorts of ways (and we respect each other), some of whom send their kids to<br/>
school and yet are much more respectful of them than the women on that<br/>
board.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I know I didn&#39;t really post a real<br/>
question, just a frustration, so thanks for relating to it.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-So I sought out my local unschoolers<br/>
list. And I am disappointed. It is not anything like these<br/>
national/international lists. -=-<br/>
<br/>
This is discussion, though. There are people here who might <br/>
disappoint you in person.<br/>
<br/>
-=-It&#39;s like a bunch of homeschoolers have latched on to the term <br/>
unschooling and think it only means that they do not use a set <br/>
curriculum in their school at home. For them it does not extend to <br/>
their lives, to parenting, or in general respecting their kids. -=-<br/>
<br/>
That&#39;s the other edge of unschooling. It&#39;s unschooling. It&#39;s not <br/>
the kind of unschooling that creates the results radical unschoolers <br/>
are getting. They&#39;ll end up with the same bad relationships with <br/>
their teens, and maybe the kids will decide they&#39;d rather go to <br/>
school than stay home, because there won&#39;t be the same warmth and <br/>
acceptance. The parents are not as likely to have the depth of <br/>
compassion they would have for their kids if they didn&#39;t have the <br/>
overlay of a checklist of missed chores and broken rules.<br/>
<br/>
-=-The vibe of some recent posts is basically a few women (mostly <br/>
with younger children) telling everyone how they live with certain <br/>
structures, controls, and limits for their kids and basically saying <br/>
that&#39;s what works for their family so don&#39;t question it.-=-<br/>
<br/>
When people say they don&#39;t want to be questioned, or they want to be <br/>
&quot;respected&quot; or that all parents should support all other parents, <br/>
they&#39;re not ready for any sort of philosophical discussion. The kind <br/>
of unschooling we discuss here is based in principles, and those <br/>
can&#39;t be discussed or understood without the willingness to change <br/>
and examine one&#39;s thoughts. That&#39;s what philosophy is, looking at <br/>
beliefs and how beliefs affect thought, words and actions.<br/>
<br/>
We can&#39;t change those other people, but we can provide discussion of <br/>
beliefs, though, language and action.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Is this common in smaller local groups? I am so sad that I am not <br/>
getting to meet other similar minded folks.-=-<br/>
<br/>
Unschoolers are very rare. Good unschoolers are even rarer. Yes, <br/>
this group is pretty damned special. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
-=-Just wondering what to do now. I suppose I should just stop <br/>
reading over there. Yeah, tell me the obvious. Anyway, I&#39;m here to <br/>
learn!-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you can read that other one without frustration, maybe you could <br/>
at least recommend webpages or other lists occasionally, for the <br/>
benefit of the undecided. And honestly, if those families have <br/>
younger kids and they&#39;re not going to commit to unschooling at such a <br/>
depth that it will really stick, they&#39;ll probably be moving toward a <br/>
curriculum before long or putting kids in school. Some will want to <br/>
move further into unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
I quit a statewide yahoogroup that I myself had formed and owned <br/>
because I got jumped on for saying one unschooling thing in a year. <br/>
I was doing them a favor to keep that list operational and <br/>
advertised, and the one time I wanted to defend unschoolers I got <br/>
pounded by newish-to-homeschooling know-nothings. I&#39;d bet any amount <br/>
of money that all their kids have been in school for years now and <br/>
that they&#39;re spending their time complaining with other parents about <br/>
how hard it is to be a parent. My kids, meanwhile, are sweet and <br/>
present and tell me they love me.<br/>
<br/>
Have the people on your local list gotten this support link?<br/>

is a PNW group.-=-<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-90878382">LMAO Robyn! That is too funny! I have read a ton on Sandra&#39;s site because of<br/>
links provided by others in various places. That&#39;s when I realized I was on<br/>
the same path, just closer to the beginning of it. The info there makes so<br/>
much sense to me and I can relate to it. Something is resonating within me,<br/>
I just need to find ways to get my husband on the same path so we can live<br/>
peacefully within our family (he is half way there without knowing it, he<br/>
usually has a respectful way of dealing with our son, but blows up way<br/>
sooner than I do and is worried about him missing out on what &quot;school&quot; is<br/>
supposed to provide for kids). I figure I have a year or 2 to show him how<br/>
we are going to be better off in the long run without sending him to school!<br/>
I&#39;m starting by really trying to unschool all of our lives and treating<br/>
everyone including him (DH) with respect and empathy and understanding. It<br/>
feels good.<br/>
 <br/>
I guess to find others on the same path, I needed to go to the source (this<br/>
list!), I just perceived it for those who knew what they were doing more<br/>
than for me who was not quite sure. Not sure why I thought that, but I&#39;m<br/>
glad I finally joined!<br/>

What I&#39;ve found that works very well on the local level in  mixed <br/>

found early on that even mild questions directed in someone else&#39;s  direction got <br/>
negative reactions, so I started talking about what works in our  family, what <br/>
my kids&#39; lives look like, different options I tried before I  decided on <br/>
something and *why* something works for one of the people in my  family. I&#39;ve <br/>
gotten a lot of positive comments on the side and in person, and  quite a few (for <br/>
the size of my local homeschool group) really asking questions  and wanting <br/>
to learn more. I&#39;ve had moms tell me that because of what I&#39;ve  shared on the <br/>
local homeschool group, they&#39;ve relaxed about their own  homeschooling. I&#39;ve <br/>
heard through the grapevine that some people still get upset  about what I write <br/>
(even thought it&#39;s about my own and my family&#39;s own  experiences), but <br/>
there&#39;s not a group &quot;ganging up&quot; on anyone for any particular  viewpoint on that <br/>
group.<br/>
 <br/>
I, too, started my own local unschooling group and though it&#39;s  slow, it&#39;s <br/>
got good conversation. :~)  I think the owner of the group  really sets the <br/>
tone. It&#39;s young yet, and the members kind of far-flung, so I  figure it will <br/>
probably take time for it to really warm up and get  flowing.<br/>

by Sandra on UD (her words - I&#39;m sure the communication would NOT have been <br/>
any kind of personal attack or mean spirited as the word &quot;flame&quot; implies) <br/>
she ran an &quot;unschooling&quot; support group that facilitated so many organized <br/>

pre-school aged children, as Jayn was then, that it sounded like..well... a <br/>
preschool - with weekly field trips to the park. I immediately knew it <br/>
wasn&#39;t a group that was worth the long drive for me or Jayn.<br/>
<br/>
Not a nut case so much as maybe a sad case. She was turning away from and <br/>
discounting some wonderful life changing possibilities freely offered at <br/>
www.sandradodd.com . But she seemed perfectly satisfied with her group and <br/>
her approach.<br/>

bullshit detection cause them to stay away (some of them, perhaps). &gt;<br/>
<br/>
I have found that it attracts people who have been deeply wounded in their<br/>
own childhood and who want better for their own children.  Unfortunately,<br/>
some are still living a reactive life instead of a proactive happy<br/>
unschooling life.<br/>

saying, as a judgement call, even though it&#39;s not.  People project.  If<br/>
you say, for instance that you dislike spanking and you don&#39;t do it in<br/>

I was trying to explain in one conversation that allowing children as<br/>
young as 2, to use sharp knives and helping them and guiding them, was<br/>
different than saying &quot;no&quot; as a rule.  Someone responded back, that it<br/>
may be fine with me to let little kids play with knives, but for her and<br/>
her family, they&#39;d continue having a no knife rule.  The fact is, I&#39;d<br/>
never LET my kids play with knives and I&#39;ve never seen my kids try to<br/>
play with knives.  They wanted to USE them, just like I was, it was<br/>
natural curiousity about copying what the adult was doing and wanting to<br/>
try.  That&#39;s how kids learn.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s clarity in words and thinking, something, that to a large degree, I<br/>
learned from reading and writing with others that were clear in their<br/>

<br/>
This sort of emotional and philosophical distortion can be taken too  <br/>
far, though. If someone argues for spanking, and sees herself as a  <br/>
well-justified spanker who will never change her stance, where does  <br/>
&quot;just the behavior of spanking&quot; and &quot;them because they spank&quot; have a  <br/>
difference?<br/>

There are plastic knives and wooden toy knives and table knives, and  <br/>
there&#39;s using knives to put butter on bread and then using knives to  <br/>
throw at mostly-naked ladies on spinning wheels in carnivals, and a  <br/>
huge range in between.<br/>
<br/>
I know there is a long tradition of the Christian platitude &quot;hate the  <br/>
sin but love the sinner.&quot;  I think that&#39;s because sinners might  <br/>
become tithers.<br/>
<br/>
If I hate bullshit, how can I love the bullshitters?  Bullshit  <br/>
doesn&#39;t create itself.<br/>
<br/>
In the Christian model (in the fundamentalist platitude-spouting  <br/>
model to which I&#39;m referring), sin is something foisted on people by  <br/>
their disobedience and by the devil (or by God as a test, depending  <br/>
how you look at), but it&#39;s not that sin comes out of people, it&#39;s  <br/>
that people who might be born again any moment (and start giving  <br/>
money to the church) are lured in by the spiritual elemental *thing*  <br/>
that is sin.<br/>
<br/>
So.  Can you dislike spanking and like a spanker?<br/>

 </span></blockquote>Totally!  The example that was used, which I guess, I didn&#39;t bring here,<br/>
was specifically a steak knife.  The mom feared that if she let her<br/>
daughter eat with a steak knife, she would stab herself and bleed to<br/>
death, and therefore she had a &quot;no&quot; sharp knife rule because she wanted<br/>
her little kids to be safe.<br/>
<br/>
And, I was just thinking in the car on the way home from the grocery<br/>
store a few minutes ago, that if Chamille or Margaux wanted to use a<br/>
knife in a playful manner, they would probably be able to do so, because<br/>
they are safe with sharp things.  How else would a person learn how to<br/>
juggle knives or throw them at spinning ladies in a circus, if they<br/>
never PLAYED with them?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, I do love my sister, even though she spanks her kids and punishes<br/>
and schools at home because she doesn&#39;t want the evil bad non-christian<br/>
influence surrounding her kids.  Although, I don&#39;t necessarily extend<br/>
that same generosity to strangers that I&#39;ve never met before.<br/>
<br/>
So, in real life, I try to give the benefit of the doubt and local<br/>
boards tend to offer, real life possibilities of meeting people. <br/>
However, if those people prove in real life or online to be a pain in<br/>
the neck, I&#39;ll change my mind and have an informed opinion based on<br/>
their behavior.  So, someone who spanks their kids, may have other<br/>
redeeming qualities and may come to see the error of their ways, but if<br/>
it&#39;s so big and huge and influencing in their lives, it would be hard to<br/>
reconcile putting a lot of effort into that relationship.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ve lost friends over similar things.  The mother of one of my<br/>
daughter&#39;s friends, is a pretty cool person in a lot of ways.  We were<br/>
friends for years, but it eventually came to a point where it was hard<br/>
to be around her and her daughter when the mom was always belittling and<br/>
shaming and guilting her daughter.  We started just inviting the<br/>
daughter over and now the daughter is old enough, where she&#39;s starting<br/>
to exhibit this same sort of behavior, and we&#39;ve stopped asking her over<br/>
too.</div>

Oh yikes.  I don&#39;t think I had thought of it that way, that  simply  <br/>
isolating the child still isn&#39;t safety from the behavior of the parents.<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;ll be on the lookout with that in a couple of Holly&#39;s friends whose  <br/>
moms were friends of mine once.  Maybe they won&#39;t become their moms  <br/>
and maybe they will.  Maybe the behavior won&#39;t be as irritating to  <br/>
Holly as it was to me if they do.<br/>

<br/>
I think that&#39;s true.<br/>
<br/>
Because of the SCA (which I joined in 1977, and am fading out of, but  <br/>
have been extremely active for most of my adult life), I&#39;ve had  <br/>
relationships with people who had the intent to learn all kinds of  <br/>
things I knew, or that others around me knew, and I&#39;ve seen dozens  <br/>
(hundreds at a distance, and dozens I was involved  directly in) of  <br/>
instances of people drawing people in for year or for life, and of  <br/>
distancing them or flatly running them off, and seeing what kinds of  <br/>
dynamics and personalities helped or hurt in what ways.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not the same as casual friendships or natural relationships with  <br/>
neighbors and relatives.  It&#39;s not the same as teachers/students in  <br/>
schools with schedules and tuition.  It&#39;s not the same as bosses and  <br/>
employees.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing has been the same way in  my life except the unschooling  <br/>
discussions.  Not the unschooling itself (though in some ways things  <br/>
I know from the SCA have helped me be a good unschooler or helped me  <br/>
see aspects as analogous to things I already knew), but the area  <br/>
where people learn unschooling and help others &quot;get it.&quot;  There is  <br/>
some modeling, and some coaching, and some &quot;chastening&quot; (saying &quot;HEY;  <br/>
cut it out&quot; or &quot;NOT helpful&quot;) when the behavior was in danger of  <br/>
endangering the learning of others in the same place (chatroom,  <br/>
message board, discussion list).<br/>
<br/>
People have balked at me saying &quot;shush&quot; in various situation (and  <br/>
they still do, and they still will) and people have said &quot;You don&#39;t  <br/>
own unschooling.&quot;  Damned straight; I don&#39;t.  But I own my  <br/>
environment, when it&#39;s a topic I&#39;ve started, or a list I own, or I&#39;m  <br/>
defending a point I&#39;m making of which I am absolutely confidently  <br/>
certain.  And honestly, those are the only points I bother to defend.<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s one thing for someone to be unreceptive.  It&#39;s another for  <br/>
someone to be disruptive or abusive.<br/>

&gt; so happy and cool, I mean, how could that not be contagious!  I have<br/>
&gt; spent so much of my life believing that people want to seek out<br/>
&gt; happiness, and to find that it really isn&#39;t the case for so many, is so<br/>
&gt; hard for me to grasp!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, it can be hard to grasp. I&#39;ve been a radical parent more or less<br/>
since my daughter was born 23 years ago, long, long before I became<br/>
(allegedly) a &quot;radical unschooler&quot;. When my daughter was a baby and<br/>
toddler and was parented in ways that most people here would<br/>
recognise, other parents weren&#39;t interested at all in why she was such<br/>
a delight. As a new parent then, I certainly did think that was most<br/>
odd. Perhaps they attributed it to, &quot;Just lucky I guess&quot;. <br/>
<br/>
I recall one time in the early years when it was suggested that my<br/>
parenting style (as the full-time at-home parent) came from being a<br/>
man and not understanding what children are &quot;really like&quot;. Oh how I<br/>
laughed. Not to her face of course - I do have *some* manners. And the<br/>
fabulous results that had come from how my wife and I parented our<br/>
daughter were right there in front of this stupid woman all the time<br/>
and all she noticed was that we were &#39;different&#39; and by her definition<br/>
therefore not doing it right.<br/>
<br/>
Ay caramba! as Bart Simpson would say.<br/>
<br/>
And btw, after nearly six years of my son being out of school, I don&#39;t<br/>
know any unschoolers in real life. Not one. And that&#39;s alright with me<br/>
because I would do it this way for my son even if I was the only<br/>
person on the planet doing it this way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1479925772">---&lt;&lt;Can you dislike spanking and like a spanker?&gt;&gt;---<br/>
 <br/>
I don&#39;t think so. That is something I am having trouble answering to myself!<br/>
And why I felt uncomfortable in my local group. I was there hoping to meet<br/>
other families in real life who are unschooling or even in the process of<br/>
deschooling and willing to explore and learn and see how other families<br/>
exist in the unschooling universe. Upon reading many of the posts there with<br/>
such hostility and defensiveness, I was moved into thinking I would not<br/>
attend any of the group activities as I would feel uncomfortable hanging out<br/>
with people I know (from their online confessions) don&#39;t allow their kids to<br/>
watch TV or eat sugar. I would surely see it in their actions too, like if<br/>
we ate lunch together and my child had fruit snacks and their kids wanted<br/>
some. <br/>
 <br/>
But not to worry, a local RU group has formed! I think I&#39;ll try to meet up<br/>
with those folks for a while. Not because I can&#39;t be around other people who<br/>
don&#39;t have the same ideals, I have plenty of friends like that and we have<br/>
grown to have a mutual respect for one another, but because I&#39;m not in a<br/>
place where I want to open up and work on new relationships where I know<br/>
going in we have very different goals with our kids.<br/>
 <br/>
One note on non-unschooling friends: yes, it is getting harder and harder to<br/>
hang out with them now too. I do express my opinions in the context of a<br/>
subject that is being discussed (if someone asks, I will tell them what we<br/>
do in our home), but I do not bring up new topics I know most people don&#39;t<br/>
agree with. I&#39;m not out there to rock the boat, but I do hope that my<br/>
presence provides an alternate viewpoint. Sometimes they point to me as the<br/>
&quot;out there&quot; example (still co-sleeping with a 4 yr old, who also only just<br/>
weaned after he turned 4) for other friends who are doing something similar<br/>
(co-sleeping, breastfeeding a 2 yr old) and wondering how long they will<br/>
continue. I say what works for us, admit that it may not work for every<br/>
family, and sometimes cite examples of studies that support my choices.<br/>
 <br/>
I figure with unschooling it will be more of the same. <br/>
