<div id="ygrps-yiv-1880314375">Well, I&#39;m not sure exactly how to state this query but I think we <br/>
may still be &quot;deschooling&quot; here, my ds is 6 and he &quot;tried&quot; kindy for <br/>
half a year Last year then he officially unenrolled at the mid year <br/>
point. Anyhow today I was was wondering how much stuff my kid <br/>
actually does for himself and how much he does because he wants <br/>
to &quot;please&quot; me - although I try to not give him any indication that <br/>
he doesn&#39;t please me, etc when related towards schoolwork etc. How <br/>
much planning do you do ahead with your child? Do you try and plan a <br/>
few activities for the week or month? Do you input that would he <br/>
like to study this topic this week or perhaps he would like to <br/>
continue such and such instead? I know some &quot;unschooling&quot; moms who <br/>
are doing timelines with their 6yo and everytime they come across <br/>
some bit of info the mom puts it on the timeline - so the child will <br/>
understand history. But me and my son have discussions about power <br/>
rangers and avalanches and if the power rangers were real... Or we <br/>
talk about scenarios for new Scooby do games and movies or we <br/>
compare kids shows like &quot;kids next door&quot; with real life events and <br/>
occasionally we play will a computer game like &quot;totally spies&quot; which <br/>
is so teenage girl geared but my ds just loves it although he has to <br/>
ask me to explain all of the make-up gadgets - but he still beats me <br/>
at the game! I think in fact our current &quot;curriculum&quot; must be <br/>
Cartoon Network! The TV and the .net as well! <br/>
   Anyhow I&#39;m rambling yet again. So having explained this, if my <br/>
son decides to practice writing (for example) do you think he is <br/>
doing that for me or actually for himself? Should I just wait awhile <br/>
and see if it keeps his attention, should I praise him for doing it? <br/>
That would be out of context for me because I wouldn&#39;t praise him <br/>
for playing a video game and that&#39;s learning, although when he does <br/>
sometime like clear the living room floor I might say someting <br/>
like &quot;it looks clean in here, thanks for putting your toys away.&quot;  <br/>
Any of you who have read my previous posts know I do have a problem <br/>
with TV - although I am TRYING to not let it show, I was just always <br/>
raised that there are so many other things you could be doing in <br/>
real life instead of watching others on the tube. SO especially <br/>
cartoons I grow tired of quickly, but I allow my son to watch all he <br/>
wants, and I try not to berate the TV too much, but I also try to <br/>
offer other things to do - which brings me full circle to the <br/>
beginning of my post, should we be planning more things to do, what <br/>
if all he wants to do he is already doing? And as far as I can <br/>
tell &quot;strewing&quot; isn&#39;t doing anything as far as I can tell, he&#39;s <br/>
holding tight mostly to Cartoon Network, so what am I doing wrong or <br/>
should I just lay off? Thankfully he&#39;s not compulsory age yet so I <br/>
don&#39;t have to keep the journal until starting July 1st  and as you <br/>
can tell I am already confused about how I am going to do that. <br/>

<br/>
Outings I plan (always did) and visits with friends.<br/>
The &quot;strewing&quot; might involve waiting for a slow day and pulling out some new <br/>
crafts kit or science-ish toy or game or music theretofore unheard by them.<br/>
<br/>
-=- Do you input that would he <br/>
<br/>

<br/>

<br/>
No, never did talk about topics or study.  I specifically did NOT want them <br/>
to study topics, but to do real things and pick up bits of connectable <br/>
information as they went.<br/>
<br/>
Lately I remind Kirby every few days to look at the punctuation or math stuff <br/>
he&#39;s wanting to brush up on.  He&#39;s been happily very busy with other things, <br/>
so I&#39;m not pushing hard, but if I don&#39;t mention it at all, he might think I&#39;m <br/>
sabotaging his stated intention to take classes.  I *could* say if he really <br/>
wants to go he&#39;ll do that, but as he declared he wanted my help, I reach out <br/>
and say &quot;hey&quot; sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I know some &quot;unschooling&quot; moms who <br/>
<br/>
are doing timelines with their 6yo and everytime they come across <br/>
<br/>
some bit of info the mom puts it on the timeline - so the child will <br/>
<br/>
understand history. -=-<br/>
<br/>
I have always fantasized having a big long timeline.   We have a little <br/>
printed one of England (mostly pictures, from cavemen through iron age, etc.   <br/>
England&#39;s history&#39;s kind of short. &lt;g&gt;  Maybe that&#39;s why they steal everyone <br/>
else&#39;s so merrily.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think time lines are a sin, especially if they involve costumes and <br/>
musical instruments and architecture! (Pictures, not names and dates.)  We have <br/>
a chart of presidents up more often than not and it has a photographical <br/>
timeline along with the dates.<br/>
<br/>
-=-But me and my son have discussions about power <br/>
<br/>
rangers and avalanches and if the power rangers were real... Or we <br/>
<br/>
talk about scenarios for new Scooby do games and movies or we <br/>
<br/>
compare kids shows like &quot;kids next door&quot; with real life events and <br/>
<br/>
occasionally we play will a computer game like &quot;totally spies&quot; which <br/>
<br/>
is so teenage girl geared but my ds just loves it although he has to <br/>
<br/>
ask me to explain all of the make-up gadgets - but he still beats me <br/>
<br/>
at the game! I think in fact our current &quot;curriculum&quot; must be <br/>
<br/>
Cartoon Network! The TV and the .net as well! -=-<br/>
<br/>
Literature, comparison/contrast, philosophy, technology/engineering, <br/>
writing/storytelling, geology/science/history/health (avalanches). . .<br/>
Everything you&#39;re describing will be information he will build on for the <br/>
rest of his life.<br/>
<br/>
More than that, you&#39;re building a relationship of trust and shared <br/>
involvement and exploration.<br/>
<br/>
-=-So having explained this, if my <br/>
<br/>
son decides to practice writing (for example) do you think he is <br/>
<br/>
doing that for me or actually for himself?-=-<br/>
<br/>
Can&#39;t see him from here, can&#39;t feel him from here.   If he&#39;s having fun, <br/>
that&#39;s fun regardless of his initial motivation.   If he&#39;s not having fun, won&#39;t <br/>
he stop?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Should I just wait awhile <br/>
<br/>
and see if it keeps his attention, should I praise him for doing it? -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&quot; what?  If writing keeps his attention?<br/>
I wouldn&#39;t praise him for doing it, but if he makes a really pretty &quot;j&quot; or <br/>
something and it honestly strikes you as nice, maybe mention that.  Wouldn&#39;t you <br/>
do that for a friend who was practicing calligraphy or trying out a new pen <br/>
and some nice paper?  &quot;Nice J!&quot;  (I would.)<br/>
<br/>
-=-although when he does <br/>
<br/>
sometime like clear the living room floor I might say someting <br/>
<br/>
like &quot;it looks clean in here, thanks for putting your toys away.&quot;  -=-<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It looks clean&quot; would bother me, if my husband came through and said that.<br/>
&quot;Thanks for straightening up&quot; might not bother me, depending on the tone of <br/>
voice. If it sounded like &quot;It&#39;s about time&quot; or &quot;Oooooh!  You cleaned UP!&quot; I&#39;d <br/>
rather he just hadn&#39;t said anything.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I allow my son to watch all he <br/>
<br/>
wants, and I try not to berate the TV too much-=-<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re not berating TV if you say something, you&#39;re berating your son.<br/>
<br/>
-=- I also try to <br/>
<br/>
offer other things to do-=-<br/>
<br/>
If you&#39;re offering them because they seem genuinely interesting or fun, <br/>
that&#39;s virtuous.<br/>
If you&#39;re offering something solely to try to lure him away from the TV, <br/>
that&#39;s not fun.<br/>
<br/>
-=-And as far as I can <br/>
<br/>
tell &quot;strewing&quot; isn&#39;t doing anything as far as I can tell, he&#39;s <br/>
<br/>
holding tight mostly to Cartoon Network, so what am I doing wrong or <br/>
<br/>
should I just lay off? -=-<br/>
<br/>
Can you find book, magazines, CDs of music, card games related to cartoons he <br/>
likes?   Maybe aikido-like you can go toward his interests instead of trying <br/>
to pull him away from them.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-858586904">====Do you try and plan a few activities for the week or month?===<br/>
<br/>
I&#39;m not much of a planner, honestly. If others are involved, we <br/>
plan--4-H, park days, LLL, stuff like that. Those are on the schedule. <br/>
But most of our life tends to be much more organic than that. I don&#39;t <br/>
like to feel over-scheduled; I don&#39;t want to feel obligated to do <br/>
something if our day just doesn&#39;t match up. By the same token, if we all <br/>
wake up and feel like going somewhere, I want to be able to go with that <br/>
spontaneous energy. I don&#39;t plan to grocery shop or clean or anything on <br/>
any particular day. That kind of scheduling just brings out the rebel in <br/>
me. *g*<br/>
<br/>
====How much planning do you do ahead with your child? ====<br/>
<br/>
Oh, pretty much none. Except for their birthdays and trips. Usually, <br/>
we&#39;ll go do something of the child&#39;s choosing on his/her birthday, so I <br/>
will ask in advance what they want to do for their day. For vacations, <br/>
same kind of thing. I&#39;ll do a bunch of research about fun stuff we could <br/>
do/see, then put the most likely candidates out for choosing.<br/>
<br/>
In other terms, I&#39;m not really sure how to read that question. Are you <br/>
thinking in terms of goals or subjects here? Like sitting down with a <br/>
child and talking about what they want to read or do in terms of history <br/>
or something like that? Maybe you&#39;re not--I don&#39;t know. But if that&#39;s <br/>
what you mean, even if you&#39;re doing it on a relaxed, vague time-table <br/>
like &quot;this month,&quot; say, that&#39;s still not getting you to Unschooling. I <br/>
don&#39;t ever make plans like that with my kids. We just live, have fun, <br/>
follow our interests and the learning happens. I don&#39;t worry about <br/>
whether we&#39;ll do things on any given day because we always do things, kwim?<br/>
<br/>
====Do you input that would he like to study this topic this week or <br/>
perhaps he would like to continue such and such instead?====<br/>
<br/>
The only time I ask a question remotely similar to this is when we&#39;re at <br/>
the library. Then, I will ask if there&#39;s anything in particular the kids <br/>
want to look for while we&#39;re there. Sometimes there is, sometimes not.<br/>
<br/>
The best strewing book I got the last time we were at the library was <br/>
one that hadn&#39;t even been looked at a time or two before: a book on the <br/>
folk art of whirligigs and weathervanes. Very cool. Lot&#39;s of beautiful, <br/>
glossy color pictures of really elaborate whirlygigs--the kinds of <br/>
wooden things that spin and move in the wind. There were swimmers, row <br/>
boats, big bands, chorus lines, Santa and his sleigh. Really cool stuff. <br/>
The back had some patterns for simple beginner vanes and whirligigs <br/>
sketched out on graph paper. Lots of great discussions came out of that <br/>
book, which captured the attention of my oldest (7) and my youngest (4).<br/>
<br/>
====Anyhow today I was was wondering how much stuff my kid actually does <br/>
for himself and how much he does because he wants<br/>
to &quot;please&quot; me - although I try to not give him any indication that he <br/>
doesn&#39;t please me, etc when related towards sHchoolwork etc.  ===<br/>
<br/>
Well, we just don&#39;t do schoolwork, period. Pretty much nothing we do <br/>
even remotely looks like schoolwork, though my younger dd (5) has been <br/>
interested in the Bob&#39;s Books recently (though I suspect some of that is <br/>
dh&#39;s influence, grrrr). We do science experiments because dh is a <br/>
scientist and my kids love them, but they don&#39;t look like schoolwork. <br/>
There are no lab books (well, there were lab books that dh brought home <br/>
from work, but they never caught on), no lectures about the scientific <br/>
method, just genuine interest and curiosity and wonder--the real basis <br/>
for science before it was formalized into a method.<br/>
<br/>
=====I know some &quot;unschooling&quot; moms who are doing time lines with their <br/>
6yo and every time they come across some bit of info the mom puts it on <br/>
the time line - so the child will understand history.====<br/>
<br/>
We&#39;ve talked about making a time line because we do a lot of <br/>
history--going places like Williamsburg or Plimoth Plantation--and Em <br/>
loves ancient civilizations. But we&#39;ve never actually started it. I&#39;ve <br/>
talked about making a chart listing the different gods/ goddesses from <br/>
Greece, Rome and Egypt, but not for Em, for me because I can&#39;t always <br/>
keep them straight. But, these more schooly things rarely materialize <br/>
and tend to be more fleeting thoughts than anything else. I think that <br/>
if I were to jump on them and start organizing everyone to do them, that <br/>
would probably start being more about me and some educational product <br/>
than about the kids. I suspect anyway.<br/>
<br/>
====Or we talk about scenarios for new Scooby do games and movies or we <br/>
compare kids shows like &quot;kids next door&quot; with real life events and <br/>
occasionally we play will a computer game like &quot;totally spies&quot; which is <br/>
so teenage girl geared but my ds just loves it although he has to ask me <br/>
to explain all of the make-up gadgets - but he still beats me at the <br/>
game!====<br/>
<br/>
Em loves doing this kind of thing. She&#39;s always describing the next Star <br/>
Wars movie that she&#39;ll make or whatever, and we love watching the DVD <br/>
extras where they show all the story-boarding that went into making the <br/>
movie. We&#39;ll do stuff like read a book, then watch the movie, look at a <br/>
comic book, looking at all the different adaptations of the story. We <br/>
don&#39;t do this often, but when we do it&#39;s fun. We&#39;ve done it with <br/>
Sleeping Beauty, _The Hobbit_ and _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_.  <br/>
Right now, they&#39;re in the middle of _Stuart Little_ with dh, so we&#39;ll <br/>
rent the movie when they&#39;re done. I&#39;d like to do it with _James and the <br/>
Giant Peach_, but that&#39;s just a vague someday kind of thought.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Pay very close attention to his body language, facial expressions, etc..<br/>
You will know if he doesn&#39;t want to do something.  Verbalize that for him<br/>
and out loud give him permission to tell you that he doesn&#39;t want to do<br/>
something.  Then when it happens, take it with a smile and move forward.<br/>
<br/>
TV----Does he prefer TV over other fun activities on a regular basis?  If<br/>
so, he is either getting something he needs from it or he is still hearing<br/>
you berate TV in his head and is waiting for you to flip it off, trying to<br/>
gorge on as much as possible before you do.  Either way, you need to watch<br/>
your own body language and let him be.<br/>
<br/>
If he does not prefer TV over other fun activities, offer fun stuff to do.<br/>
A trip to the zoo, a picnic, build a bonfire, collect ants for an ant farm,<br/>
etc..<br/>

I agree. And if he&#39;s the least bit worried about missing a favorite show, <br/>
record it for him.  He might not even ever watch it, but you&#39;ll have taken his <br/>
desires into serious consideration and that&#39;s priceless.<br/>

when we use to follow a curriculum (glad those days are behind me), <br/>
we put a long sheet of white paper on the basement wall and would <br/>
write a date on it occasionally which she liked.  so the other day, i <br/>
asked her if she would like to make a timeline notebook.  she has so <br/>
much fun drawing dinosaurs, wooly mammoths, etc.<br/>
in the past, i would have tried to hurry it up so we could go onto <br/>
the &quot;next&quot; subject.  now, we have spent hours on the timeline and she <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2134441899">I live in Missouri. <br/>
<br/>
  I think I will just write down the stuff that we do and perhaps <br/>
not even &quot;divide&quot; it - but then someone may accuse me of not having <br/>
enough &quot;hours&quot; in each of the &quot;required&quot; subjects. I talked with <br/>
another person who I know is &quot;unschooling&quot; her  4 and almost 6yo <br/>
children and she says she&#39;s already logging &quot;for practice&quot;. I said <br/>
when time came I may just log the 1000 hours required then stop <br/>
because I feel &quot;logging&quot; may take away from what I actually feel <br/>
unschooling is but she insisted that I should write everything down <br/>
so if the &quot;throw out&quot; hours as not being schooly enough then my son <br/>
will still have enough hours, so that got me thinking just WHO is <br/>
going to &quot;throw out&quot; hours? Unless someone turns me into child <br/>
services for truancy or neglect (please NO) then no one is ever <br/>
going to see these logs - The law just states that we keep a LOG or <br/>
some other PROOF that learning is happening and that learning <br/>
experiences are being offered, no where does it say the logs are <br/>
going to be reviewed or someone is going to &quot;throw out&quot; hours, urgh! <br/>
One of the reasons I don&#39;t like the idea of keeping a log - well <br/>
other than the fact that apparently Cartoon Network is a big part <br/>
our curriculum these days and I&#39;m sure some reviewer would think <br/>
that was neglect, LOL - but it will turn everything we do naturally <br/>
into &quot;School&quot; terms, that writing a letter to grandma is working on <br/>
literature and handwriting skilles, that going swimming is physical <br/>
education, that grocery shopping is health, etc, etc. I&#39;m sure I&#39;m <br/>
luckier than most when it comes to doing the log because I have a <br/>
degree in education - so I know the language - but my own child has <br/>
changed my perceptions on life in such a big way, I don&#39;t want to <br/>
confine what he does into the &quot;required subjects&quot;  - I just want to <br/>
let him learn what he wants!<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I have a file cabinet with folders for each of my children. When they do<br/>
something that marks something important that we may want to remember, I put<br/>
it in there (with their permission). They sometimes put their own stuff in<br/>
there. If something looks &quot;school-like&quot; I may put it in there in case at<br/>
some point the big bad arm of the law comes knocking at my door (I&#39;ve not<br/>
heard of people getting in trouble for their unschooling ways, but I still<br/>
have that on the back of my mind). It is my intention that at some point I<br/>
am going to make a portfolio for each of my children as a gift of history<br/>
for them with that material, probably in chronological order. If in the<br/>
meantime, I am forced to show someone what my kids do and how I keep track<br/>
of it, I may make them sooner.<br/>
