<div id="ygrps-yiv-1529722252">I have not posted here in a long while, although some<br/>
longtime members might remember me since I have been<br/>
here for years. <br/>
<br/>
This list is a list that seeks to encourage growth. <br/>
Growth is not stagnancy, dormancy or staying within<br/>
comfort zones.  Growth means stretching, often<br/>
uncomfortably, and it means wrapping your mind around<br/>
ideas that may at first seem repellant or at least<br/>
uncomfortable, then maybe begin to make logical sense,<br/>
and finally to ring with a clarity which makes you<br/>
wonder how you didn&#39;t see it before.  Growth is often<br/>
somewhat scary, leaping into the unknown, letting go<br/>
of preconceptions and of well worn and comfortable<br/>
long standing beliefs and practices.  Because it&#39;s<br/>
scary it often causes defensiveness.  Growth is also,<br/>
despite popular cultural lip service, not something<br/>
that is often supported or encouraged on a personal or<br/>
interpersonal level.  Being &quot;polite&quot; to the point of<br/>
being dishonest, not &quot;rocking the boat&quot; or disrupting<br/>
the status quo, and minding your own business are seen<br/>
as much preferable to encouraging growth in general.<br/>
<br/>
I love this list because it&#39;s different than that. <br/>
It&#39;s not afraid to be honest, while not holding<br/>
grudges or making personal attacks.  I don&#39;t see flame<br/>
wars on this list, just occassional ruffled feathers<br/>
as those doing some stretching feel the burn of<br/>
growth, sometimes reacting defensively.<br/>
<br/>
I love this list because there is always so much good<br/>
food for thought, differing meaty and meaningful ideas<br/>
to chew on and experiences to take in that are not<br/>
hand holding and cooing like the many &quot;support group&quot;<br/>
lists out there, as Sandra described.  I love the real<br/>
exchanges happening on this list, as opposed to smarmy<br/>
and meaningless (or worse) small talk and self<br/>
defeating back patting that only serves to stifle<br/>
growth and silence doubts or questions or exploration.<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
I also love this definition of unschooling Sandra gave<br/>
during the recent dicussion (guess I&#39;m just full of<br/>
love!):<br/>
<br/>
&quot;It&#39;s maintaining a lifestyle in which learning<br/>
flourishes.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
I hope that&#39;s always what my life is all about.<br/>
