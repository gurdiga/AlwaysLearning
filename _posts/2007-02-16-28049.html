<div id="ygrps-yiv-750861547">Hi. My name is Angel and I am new to the group and more so new to <br/>
the concept of &quot;unschooling.&quot;  Truthfully I have no idea what it is <br/>
really is.  I am a former school teacher who now is a SAHM. I love <br/>
it!  I have a wonderful four year old boy and I started his day like <br/>
I would if he were in a pre-k classroom.  I had lesson plans and <br/>
materials ready to enrich his world.  Well, my son was not having <br/>
it.  I am NOT a ditto or workbook kind of mommy or teacher.  The <br/>
activities I provided were based on interest and a variety of <br/>
materials-play-doh, paint, dirt, etc.   But any effort I made seemed <br/>
to be shot down by my son.  So, I thought okay I will allow my boy <br/>
to pick out the book when it is story time, I will allow him to pick <br/>
the songs to sing, and material to use, but the schedule to do these <br/>
activities will remain the same as before.  Well, that does not seem <br/>
to be working either.  So, one day I just let him do his own thing <br/>
and I was there to be his mommy, playmate, and resource whenever he <br/>
needed me.  AND GUESS WHAT- I observed so much learning and <br/>
excitement from my little boy. I was told that this is a form of <br/>
unschooling, is it???? I have some more info I have included and I <br/>
could sure use your advice.  I do not want to teach my son based on <br/>
my &quot;teaching degree.&quot;  I want to teach my son to develop a love for <br/>
learning that would be in the best of his interest. Thanks.<br/>
Ok, I have had wonderful answers about how you do it. But now I <br/>
would love to know and for us to share; What do you do?  Ok, I am <br/>
allowing my son&#39;s learning and activities to be based on his <br/>
interests.  I have set up a routine schedule. For example: In the <br/>
morning we will do story time and he picks out the story. During <br/>
another part of the day it is sensory time and my boy picks out the <br/>
sensory activity.  Although, he has the freedom to pick out the book <br/>
or activity, he may not be motivated at that time to do it. Well, It <br/>
is not working for me. I redo the schedule and I reschedule all the <br/>
activities and you know what it keeps changing.  It was so much <br/>
easier being a classroom teacher.  I thought having a routine chart <br/>
would work and provide structured. However, my son may not be <br/>
physically and mentally ready for that activity during that specific <br/>
time of day.  He is a YOUNG four year old.  Do you have this <br/>
problem? Alright moms, I need your advice and input.  My son is very <br/>
well behaved and is responsible about helping around the home and <br/>
being considerate of others, but should I just do story time  when <br/>
he picks up a book and says, &quot;mommy, please read this story to me?&quot; <br/>
Should I completely just let my son flow throughout the day as long <br/>
as learning and teaching responsibility occurs? Should the <br/>
activities happen based on spontaneous learning?  Moms, it would be <br/>
nice to know how it works for you.  I do not want the &quot;loving-<br/>
control&quot; part of me to come before the natural interest of my son.  <br/>
Am I making any sense?????</div>

<br/>
Then the first thing for you to do is to read about unschooling!<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/unschool/definition.html">http://sandradodd.com/unschool/definition.html</a><br/>

<br/>
That might look like it&#39;s all my writing, but it&#39;s not.  It&#39;s just  <br/>
all in my ever-expanding collection of good-parts.<br/>
<br/>
When you post, please break your writing into paragraphs so that  <br/>
those who might read and help you out aren&#39;t inconvenienced.  It will  <br/>
not only be a courtesy, it will help you with the clarity of your own  <br/>
thinking, if you can look at what you&#39;ve written and group it into  <br/>
topics or sections.  Clarity will make or break unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
-=-. So, one day I just let him do his own thing<br/>
and I was there to be his mommy, playmate, and resource whenever he<br/>
needed me. AND GUESS WHAT- I observed so much learning and<br/>
excitement from my little boy. I was told that this is a form of<br/>
unschooling, is it????-=-<br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s not &quot;a form,&quot; but it was one big clue for you, wasn&#39;t it?   <br/>
Learning happens without teaching.  Teaching can hamper learning, in  <br/>
fact, and can eventually kill the desire to learn, or the natural  <br/>
ability to learn confidently and freely.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I have set up a routine schedule.-=-<br/>
<br/>
That won&#39;t help anything.<br/>
<br/>
-=-During another part of the day it is sensory time and my boy picks  <br/>
out the<br/>
sensory activity. -=-<br/>
<br/>
Every part of every day is &quot;sensory time.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Would you build an assembly line to make one automobile?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Alright moms, I need your advice and input. -=-<br/>
<br/>
You need the advice and input of unschoolers, whether moms, dads or  <br/>
kids.<br/>
<br/>
-=-However, my son may not be<br/>
physically and mentally ready for that activity during that specific<br/>
time of day. He is a YOUNG four year old. Do you have this<br/>
problem? -=-<br/>
<br/>
The problem of having a young child?  A four year old?  The problem  <br/>
of scheduling when scheduling won&#39;t help?<br/>
<br/>
-=-Should I completely just let my son flow throughout the day as long<br/>
as learning and teaching responsibility occurs?-=-<br/>
<br/>
If &quot;teaching responsibility&quot; is making you feel better, cling to it.   <br/>
It won&#39;t help you unschool.<br/>
Here&#39;s something to read about teaching and learning:<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://sandradodd.com/wordswords">http://sandradodd.com/wordswords</a><br/>
<br/>
-=-Should the<br/>
activities happen based on spontaneous learning?-=-<br/>
<br/>
NO.<br/>
Activities shouldn&#39;t happen based on spontaneous learning.  That is a  <br/>
WHOLE lot of words and ideas and ownership to put between yourself  <br/>
and your very real and immediate child.<br/>
<br/>
Learning can and will happen and your responsibility should be not  <br/>
preventing it, by basing activities on real, natural, spontaneous  <br/>
learning.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I do not want the &quot;loving-<br/>
control&quot; part of me to come before the natural interest of my son.<br/>
Am I making any sense?????-=-<br/>
<br/>
Mainstream, confused sense, but not unschooling sense.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-448921159">I would say that the part of your post where you discussed how  much your son <br/>
enjoyed it when you just let go and stepped back in order to give  him room <br/>
to do what he wanted was a big first step towards unschooling.  In  your post, <br/>
it sounded as if you realized that, but then you lapsed back into  routines <br/>
and structure.  I know that some people who are new to the idea of  unschooling <br/>
see it as an easy, almost lazy approach to parenting.  They are  overwhelmed <br/>
with thoughts of all the things their children will not be  getting.  The truth <br/>
is that unschooling is often far more difficult on the  parent than teaching <br/>
would be.  It&#39;s hard to relinquish control.  It&#39;s  hard to trust your children <br/>
to know what they want and need.  It  shouldn&#39;t be, but sometimes it is.  You <br/>
should read plenty about  unschooling and lurk here for a while in order to <br/>
get a feel for what  unschooling really is (and isn&#39;t).  In the meantime, while <br/>
you soak up all  you can, keep in mind how your son blossomed when you put <br/>
his day into his  own hands.  Let the contentment that you saw and how it made <br/>
you feel  be your focus.  You have a wonderful opportunity to give your son a  <br/>
life of freedom and of choice.  Believe me, learning will happen on its  own.  <br/>
 You&#39;ve made a great first step.  Don&#39;t let fear and your  own conditioning <br/>
make you doubt the joy you witnessed first hand when you  allowed your child <br/>
the freedom to choose how he spent his day.   A happy child will be your reward. <br/>
 Good  luck.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1444651489">Hi everybody!<br/>
<br/>
I have a few questions on online games.  First of all, is Runescape a  <br/>
sim game and if not/so then what is a sim game?<br/>
<br/>
My dreamlets (7) and I were looking for a game like Age of Mythology  <br/>
but with horses instead.  We found lots of them, but they all seemed  <br/>
to be old and not played anymore.  Then I found one that wants to  <br/>
filter out newbies like us saying that if you&#39;ve never played or if  <br/>
your too young you should go elsewhere.  I then checked out runescape  <br/>
and when it asked us to open an account it asked our age.  I  <br/>
appropriately said 13 and under and got chucked out of their lobby!   <br/>
I tried to go back but they said &quot;we meant it&quot;.  So even if I (42)  <br/>
want to play I can&#39;t because somehow my computer, or IP address has  <br/>
been registered on their system.<br/>
<br/>
My dreamlets do pretty well with Age of Mythology and have learned so  <br/>
much.  My one dreamlet plays all the time and progresses in leaps and  <br/>
bounds.  But she LOVES horses, and the Barbie&#39;s Horse Adventure just  <br/>
doesn&#39;t cut it anymore.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas???  If not horsey games, then any fun games will do.   Thanks!<br/>

<br/>
My DD 7 recommends bellasara.com and horseland.com for free horse games. Bellasara <br/>
has trading cards you can buy and then register the horses that you get to add to you <br/>
stable, but you can play there without the cards with the horse they give you.<br/>
<br/>
DS 9 also plays lots of Age of Mythology and would love to play Runescape but we have <br/>
never had any luck getting started there either no matter what we put for a birthday. <br/>
Bummer!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck - Alyse</div>

But if there&#39;s something more interesting going on, then what?  Do <br/>
you stop playing with leggoes to read, when he&#39;s happily building <br/>

the mud...would you *make* him play in the mud?<br/>
Do you take weekends *off* from *school*?  Suppose something <br/>
interesting comes up on Saturday...does it have to wait until Monday, <br/>
when you can ask if he&#39;s still interested and wants to look into it <br/>

<br/>
This morning (Saturday) my younger dd was looking out the window <br/>
watching the snow...she saw a white-tailed deer in the field across <br/>
from our house.  &quot;Mom,mom, look! A deer!&quot;  She saw several <br/>
birds...&quot;Look! a cardinal!...What&#39;s those little brown birds that&#39;s <br/>
all over the place called?...Look at this one, it&#39;s black with red <br/>
and white...what is it?&quot;  I took time from what I was doing to look <br/>
at a deer, to identify house wrens, to look up a black, white and red <br/>
bird online (eastern towhee), and marvel over the size of a deer&#39;s <br/>
tail.  <br/>
When LIVING is learning is living, there isn&#39;t a reason for schedules <br/>
and routines.  I COULD call it science and make a note of it, but I <br/>
think instead I&#39;ll just enjoy it, as it flows. <br/>
I don&#39;t know if this will help you answer any of your <br/>
questions...just my 2 cents, but really, go to Sandra&#39;s site and <br/>
search around and read about how unschooling works IRL.  I&#39;ve been <br/>
reading at her site for MONTHS now, and am not nearly finished.  I <br/>
usually only have time for a page or 2 a day, but it&#39;s FASCINATING to <br/>
read about their lives.  (And the lives of those others&#39; she <br/>
references) <br/>
I hope this helps...sometimes it&#39;s helpful to know it IS working in <br/>
other people&#39;s lives.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1811907481">Welcome Angel! I am very much like you... new to unschooling, mommy <br/>
to young children and former teacher.  I very much wanted <br/>
to &#39;structure&#39; my 3 y.o&#39;s day because that is what I was taught to do <br/>
as a preschool teacher and also as a 2nd and 1st grade teacher. <br/>
<br/>
I ran into the same problems and more.  When it was &#39;time&#39; to do <br/>
reading, there was no way I was going to interupt her block building <br/>
time, and when she was reading, there was no way I was going to stop <br/>
her just to tell her that its &#39;time&#39; to do art.  And sometimes <br/>
reading would happen all day and no art would get done, and other <br/>
days all she wants to do is art and no reading will get done; and I <br/>
had to LET GO of my expectations and learn that SHE knows the best <br/>
way that SHE learns.  <br/>
<br/>
Not to mention that the AAP came out with a new study that emphasises <br/>
the importance of play- Free, unstructured, unscheduled play time is <br/>
ESSENTIAL for social, emotional, and cognitive development!<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.aap.org/pressroom/play-public.htm">http://www.aap.org/pressroom/play-public.htm</a>  <br/>
<br/>
Reading that study just confirmed to me what I already knew in my <br/>
heart and helped me let go of my own schedules in favor of hers. <br/>
<br/>
I read an eye opening speech by John Taylor Gatto (his teacher of the <br/>
year acceptance speech) that talked about how children&#39;s focus is <br/>
made to be shortened by school bells that ring at arbitrary times so <br/>
children have to stop what they are doing and go to the next class. <br/>
(Think pavlov&#39;s dogs and his bells) All of this &#39;school&#39; type of <br/>
stucture is really only to move the MASSES of children in a way that <br/>
works for the school, not for the best interest of the individual <br/>
child. So why would I try to emulate that at home?<br/>
<br/>
I am still learning about unschooling, like you.  If you want, you <br/>
can also email me personally if you would like to chat.<br/>
