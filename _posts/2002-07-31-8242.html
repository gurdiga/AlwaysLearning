<div id="ygrps-yiv-353942092">Sandra, <br/>
<br/>
You brought up some interesting ideas. Ashley is going on 8. She has her own<br/>
space, a whole room, yet our house is tiny. She does have a brother who does<br/>
not respect her things mostly. He&#39;s getting better. He is obnoxiuos,<br/>
especially when friends are over. She has had to share me twice now with a new<br/>
baby. She stays up super late waiting for me to cuddle her in bed. Tessa still<br/>
nurses at night and I get her asleep before I can visit with Ashley. Some<br/>
nights I&#39;m proactive and get Ashley to settle in with some stories/chats<br/>
before I help the others to bed. I&#39;m exhausted mostly meeting 3 kids needs all<br/>
day and night. Tim leaves for work early in am and ar 40 can not stay awake<br/>
past 9:30. We have issues about bedtime/let them go to bed on their own.<br/>
Totally off on a tangent now.<br/>
<br/>
O.K. So I know Ashley is needy. Her neediness is going on and on and on,<br/>
though. We give her a ton of time with other families, teens, friends,<br/>
activities. She is a do-er. She does not repect us in that she barks when we<br/>
talk to her. She cries if she has to compromise. She sees herself at the hub<br/>
of the universe.<br/>
<br/>
 Riley likes to sing the songs she learns for musical shows. He does not want<br/>
to be in the shows, yet loves watching and learning along side. Forever now,<br/>
he sings his own versions, she barks corrections at him, we ask her to let her<br/>
brother sing his style. If he wants help he will ask. She complains, cries,<br/>
hums rudely and loudly so he messes up. He screams, she continues correcting.<br/>
So she is possessing even songs. She does not want to share them. It makes for<br/>
misearble driving and family time. Why can&#39;t she just let him be? Even after<br/>
being asked to let him be?<br/>
<br/>
I really want her to see the results of her actions. When you correct Riley he<br/>
yells at you. I need to help Riley not yell and Ashley not correct. The<br/>
yelling would stop, though, if the correcting stopped.<br/>
<br/>
Finding her an adult/teen who she can learn respect from seems like a great<br/>
idea. She has a good friend here on the block. I&#39;m at the point now of asking<br/>
her to show some self control. She seems to be taking this rude behavior too<br/>
far and I want her to practice being kind. Feel what it feels like to speak<br/>
kindly. We talked too much yesterday about finding solutions. She melted down<br/>
every 5 minutes or so. I would drop it. Wait until she was ready to talk<br/>
peacefully.<br/>
<br/>
 Basically, she is frustrated alot of the time because things do not go her<br/>
way. She needs to learn a few coping skills. She wants me to send her to her<br/>
room to read when she gets cold and prickly. I want her to vent her<br/>
frustrations, on paper, to me, to the kittens, to someone so she can see/hear<br/>
what&#39;s really going on. Often times the issue is really easily solved.<br/>
<br/>
 Talk about sensivity to clothing. She has worn 1 pair of satin PJ bottoms<br/>
inside out for 5 months now. And a bathing suit for underclothes. Once in a<br/>
while she pulls on a tank dress. She found 2 pairs of sandals she loves, yea<br/>
we have shoes for now. <br/>
<br/>
I really want her to see the results of her actions. When you correct Riley he<br/>
yells at you. I need to help Riley not yell and Ashley not correct. The<br/>
yelling would stop, though, if the correcting stopped.<br/>
<br/>
OK enough, thank you for raeding. I&#39;m going to remember what a LLL leader<br/>
friend always said &quot;When they are the most unloveable, they need the most<br/>
love.&quot;<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It will go on until her needs are met.<br/>
That&#39;s the thing.<br/>
<br/>
If one kid is needier than others, that kid needs more!<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She cries if she has to compromise. She sees herself at the hub<br/>
of the universe.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
That will fade with time.  And it will fade faster with more attention.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;She complains, cries,<br/>

being asked to let him be?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If he&#39;s doing that just to bug her, I&#39;d ask him to stop.<br/>
<br/>
We used to make Kirby crazy by singing songs wrong. Sometimes we&#39;d do it just <br/>
to tease him.  I&#39;d sing the Flintstones to the Jetsons tune, and vice versa  <br/>
(Or just &quot;Meet Fred Flintstone<br/>
Daughter Pebbles<br/>
His dog Dino<br/>
Wilma his wife...&quot;<br/>
<br/>
and Kirby would be wailing &quot;NO!  That&#39;s WRONG!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
We quit doing it after a while because it was too mean.<br/>
He honestly DID hate it.<br/>
<br/>
Do you try humor with her, and logic?  <br/>
Maybe if you say to her (when she&#39;s alone) that the only songs she can own <br/>
are the ones she makes up herself.  It might get her to thinking.  It might <br/>
get her to writing some songs.  It  might get her to lighten up.<br/>
<br/>
Or if she says she does own some songs, maybe make a list of all the songs in <br/>
the world (you can finish it later, but at least start it) and as if it&#39;s a <br/>
serious proposition, make a list of the songs SHE owns, but she&#39;ll need to <br/>
designate some to be her brother&#39;s songs.  And when she sees how silly and <br/>
&quot;wrong&quot; it is, she&#39;ll laugh and give up the idea.<br/>
<br/>
(Maybe &lt;g&gt;.)<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;I really want her to see the results of her actions. When you correct Riley <br/>
he<br/>
yells at you. I need to help Riley not yell and Ashley not correct. The<br/>
yelling would stop, though, if the correcting stopped.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wish I knew you guys in person so I could say something really helpful.  <br/>
I&#39;m kinda thinking, though, that maybe somehow you&#39;re perpetuating or <br/>
contributing to it and you&#39;re not seeing the results of your mom-actions.  <br/>
Maybe the correcting would stop if you could figure out what she wants by it, <br/>
what she&#39;s thinking.  Or just get her to see it in a different way.  Maybe <br/>
you need to help Ashley not NEED to correct.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; She seems to be taking this rude behavior too<br/>
far and I want her to practice being kind. Feel what it feels like to speak<br/>
kindly. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I remember a conversation with Kirby when he was about twelve.  I said I <br/>
didn&#39;t know why he thought it was okay to be mean to Marty.  That people were <br/>
 nice to him (and I rattled off ten names of other kids and mostly adults who <br/>
were nice to him) and that he KNOWS it feels better, but he didn&#39;t seem to <br/>
realize how much he was hurting Marty with his attitude and his words.  I <br/>
said I was frustrated that I couldn&#39;t figure out how to explain it to him, <br/>
and embarrassed that he was being a way that he himself hadn&#39;t been treated, <br/>
and I asked him what he would do if he were me.<br/>
<br/>
Things started to change after that.  He just thought about it differently.<br/>
<br/>
What about role playing?  Trade places and be each other.  Let each of them <br/>
take turns being the mom.  Be them with an obnoxious vengeance.  If they get <br/>
mad and say &quot;THAT IS NOT HOW I ACT.&quot; say &quot;Oh.  Sorry.  How should I say it?&quot;  <br/>
And maybe they&#39;ll do the &quot;new improved&quot; them.  And in doing that they&#39;ll <br/>
think about how it looks to others. <br/>
<br/>
And if a role playing session turns to tears and storming out, let it go.  <br/>
Put on some quiet music, work in the yard, let all that frustration dissipate <br/>
gradually and let it do some good.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt; Basically, she is frustrated alot of the time because things do not go her<br/>
way. She needs to learn a few coping skills. &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Does breathing help?  Running? <br/>
What if she&#39;s required to run around the outside of the house (if you have a <br/>
circuit outside) before she can yell at anyone?  <br/>
<br/>
Just the other day Kirby hit Holly.  He&#39;s fifteen.  She&#39;s ten.  He hit her in <br/>
the head because she was picking scabs off the cat and didn&#39;t quit when he <br/>
told her to.  We had company.  You can imagine my joy.<br/>
<br/>
I pulled the ancient and honorable rule we used when he and Marty were <br/>
little.  You can only hit IF you talked first and then got a grownup to help. <br/>
 So here I am talking to someone physically bigger than I am, saying &quot;Did you <br/>
ask a grownup to help?&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;No.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Then you shouldn&#39;t have hit her.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes such rules are more for the thinking-effect than for the procedure, <br/>
for sure.   But a running around the building &quot;rule&quot; would be a way for her <br/>
to breathe and release adrenaline and have time to think.<br/>
<br/>
About the cat--I did point out to Kirby that if a cat does NOT want its scabs <br/>
picked, no ten year old girl can do it.  It takes two adults and a towel.   <br/>
My husband and I learned that when we had a cat with an abscess on its head.  <br/>
Yes, you can pick a cat&#39;s scab against its will, but first wrap it in a <br/>
towel, lay on it with your arm over its paws (which are wrapped in more than <br/>
one layer of towel) and hold its skull while the other adult does the deed <br/>
quickly. &lt;g&gt;  If Holly was picking Flower&#39;s scabs, Flower was into it.<br/>

It&#39;s true of ANY thinking being that they&#39;re thinking from the inside of <br/>
themownselves.  Then there are those tricks of compassion and awareness to <br/>
learn so that you accept that other people&#39;s universes really are <br/>
intersecting yours. &lt;g&gt;</div>

<br/>
This is what I&#39;m trying to convey to Ashley. Her world bums and bashes<br/>
sometimes into others worlds and that causes people to have feelings.<br/>
Sometimes really nasty, hateful feelings. Sometimes really beautiful feelings.<br/>
At home she collides into us. Out in the world she swirls and dances and flits<br/>
into others worlds.<br/>
<br/>
 I guess if I look really closely at this, I&#39;m jealous that she is so<br/>
nurturing, interesting, and active out and about and cold and prickly most of<br/>
the time at home. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday I got a sitter for the younger 2 kids and took Ashley and a friend<br/>
out to shop for clothes for her beatles show. She hates clothes, and wanted<br/>
bell bottom jeans. We had a blast trying on ever pair of bell bottoms we could<br/>
find. No, No, No, No because. She did not melt down, I did not melt down. Her<br/>
friend Kelly talked nonstop the whole time. She&#39;s the quiet one I mentioned.<br/>
Quiet in a houseful of kids. Very talkative when one-on-one. We found Ashley a<br/>
pair of satin flowery pj bottoms. She will wear them inside out. I have to<br/>
wash them first to get ride of the scratchy glittery stuff. She also found a<br/>
hot pink super soft fuzzy shirt which will be nice in the fall too. I dressed<br/>
this kid in organic cotton and undyed wool and she only wears polyester.<br/>
Yikes. The girls sang and giggled all the way home and had a slepover at<br/>
Kelly&#39;s. Very fun 2 hours. Well worth the $ spent on a babysitter.<br/>
<br/>
So while I know I am a big part of the problem, I see other&#39;s parts so much<br/>
clearer. She&#39;s probably correcting her brother because I seem set on<br/>
correcting her. I&#39;ll quit. <br/>
<br/>
Got to go pick Ashley up across the street at the pool. I&#39;m late, oops.<br/>

<br/>
Kirby!!<br/>
<br/>
He is SO on, charming, attentive and sparkly when he&#39;s gone, and when he&#39;s <br/>
home we get some of it, sometimes, but he needs to rest and relax and unwind <br/>
and we sometimes get the frustration-dump which he refrained from releasing <br/>
while he was out being  **Kirby Dodd!**<br/>
<br/>
One classic piece of advice I use less than I should (because it works when I <br/>
do it) is to ignore the stupidity some and praise the maturity.   When I <br/>
notice Kirby or Marty being patient or helpful or social with Holly, I say <br/>
&quot;Holly really liked playing that game with you guys.  Thanks.&quot; (Not when <br/>
she&#39;s listening!) or &quot;I&#39;m glad you like Holly and can be so patient with her <br/>
stories.  Thanks!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And I told Kirby the other day I was really glad he&#39;d been letting Marty hang <br/>
out with the older kids lately, that Marty obviously appreciated it.  And I <br/>
said I hoped it wasn&#39;t hard for Kirby, and that Marty wasn&#39;t being <br/>
irritating.  He said, &quot;No, Marty&#39;s cool!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
YES!!!  woohoo!!!<br/>
<br/>
BIG relief and big change from the difficult years when Kirby was reaching <br/>
puberty and marty was &quot;a kid.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday Marty showed me his pubic hair.   Yes, I twinged too.<br/>
It was on his upper lip.  He said, &quot;Look, mom; pubic hair&quot; and indicated <br/>
moustache stuff.   Holly and I acted appropriately shocked and averted our <br/>
eyes and squealed and said &quot;Don&#39;t Show Us!  It&#39;s not right&quot; and such.  But he <br/>
said he figures leg hairiness, underarm hair and moustache are all pubic hair <br/>
because he got them from puberty.<br/>
<br/>
eeek!<br/>

Eeeek, indeed! So I charged online to set young Marty straight, and darned<br/>
if he isn&#39;t pretty much on track. From<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.clues.abdn.ac.uk:8080/besttest/alt/translat/trans92r.html:">http://www.clues.abdn.ac.uk:8080/besttest/alt/translat/trans92r.html:</a><br/>
<br/>
&quot;The pubescent are so called from pubis, that is, they get their name from<br/>
the private parts of the body because these first show the down of puberty.<br/>
Some think of puberty as a specific age, that is, they call &#39;pubescent&#39;<br/>
someone who has reached the end of his fourteenth year, even though the<br/>
signs of puberty may appear much later. It is certain, however, that a child<br/>
has reached puberty when it shows the physical signs and can generate<br/>
children.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
This is from the Aberdeen Bestiary Project, so of course I had to find out<br/>
what *that* was:<br/>

<br/>
And it turns out it relates to medieval texts, which made me think of SCA,<br/>
and thus I arrived safely back where I started.<br/>

A fine opportunity to drop in a little historical trivia.  Remember the<br/>
Clarence Thomas conformation hearings?  Anita Hill testified that he<br/>
made a tasteless joke about pubic hair, saying he had found one on his<br/>
can of soda?  The media went kind of crazy saying &quot;pubic hair&quot; over and<br/>
over, like they were little kids having fun grossing out their friends. <br/>
But I&#39;m pretty sure the underlying story was that he had just used a<br/>
hair from his head for an opportunity for some obnoxious adolescent humor.<br/>
<br/>
Confirmation hearings for presidential appointments can be such a circus!<br/>
<br/>
Everything is educational!<br/>
<br/>
Do I even WANT to know if pubic hair has any other entries in the great<br/>
encyclopedia of history?  Maybe not!<br/>
