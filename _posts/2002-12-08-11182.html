<div id="ygrps-yiv-239843059">This whole thread reminds me when a friend of ours asked for our help to <br/>
plan her party, a halloween party. Her theme was Mother Goose stories, <br/>
with everyone dressing up as characters from mother goose.  Lexie helped <br/>
me find books, etc. to help her but was mad that Rita would ask us to <br/>
help and not invite us.  I explained the party was late evening hours, <br/>
and Lexie reminded me she stays up late constantly.  I reminded Lexie <br/>
that it was an adult only party and lexie said that was not fair and <br/>
that she was good with adults and could just come for a bit.  I finally <br/>
said &quot;Lexie, it&#39;s for lesbians only.  She does this every year.&quot;  Lexie <br/>
said something about how she might be a lesbian when she grew up and she <br/>
needed to have this experience!  LOL.  She didn&#39;t get to go, but let me <br/>
tell you, Rita and I were sure thinking that if she could argue her <br/>
point that well, she should be allowed to go!  <br/>
<br/>
It&#39;s hard on kids but you don&#39;t get to go to every party, even to every <br/>
party you are invited to.<br/>
