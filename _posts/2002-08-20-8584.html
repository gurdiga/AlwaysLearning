<div id="ygrps-yiv-1944651609">Hi to all,<br/>
<br/>
I wondering if any of you (or your children) play EverQuest.  We are just<br/>
getting started and are trying to figure out which would be the best server.<br/>
If anyone knows of a guild or group that has an unusually high unschool<br/>
membership that would certainly help.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
<br/>
Cris Kenski<br/>
PS. you can e-mail me at <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="mailto:ckenski@...">ckenski@...</a> if this is too off topic for<br/>
general interest</div>
