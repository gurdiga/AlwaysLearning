<div id="ygrps-yiv-1561939570">&quot; Needless to say, I excelled in the<br/>
workforce. I was a great multi-tasker and leader, but because of those<br/>
deep labels I still felt very insecure about my abilities.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
Yes, isn&#39;t it sad that the very labels that are considered &quot;bad&quot; in<br/>
school, are actually a bonus when applied in something the person<br/>
excels at? So sad.<br/>
<br/>
I think I&#39;m hyper. Not hyper in the sense that I need to move<br/>
physically all the time, but my brain is hyper!:) I don&#39;t need much<br/>
sleep, I am thinking constantly and always have about 20 projects going.<br/>
I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to get in a rut because I&#39;m short on<br/>
ideas, I get in ruts because I have TOO many and can&#39;t figure out<br/>
where to go next. sigh.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t mind the word being applied to ME...but I am very quick to<br/>
hush anyone that says it in a negative way in front of Jalen.<br/>
<br/>
He&#39;s SO physical and intense and explosive sometimes. I was watching<br/>
him with playdough the other day and his movements are literally<br/>
frenetic. He makes this funny noise and moves REALLY fast, almost like<br/>
he&#39;s &quot;stuck&quot; and doesn&#39;t notice anything around him. I&#39;m so thankful<br/>
we really, totally embraced radical unschooling before he came<br/>
along..I can&#39;t imagine how hard life would be for him if we weren&#39;t<br/>
understanding of his temperment.<br/>
<br/>
I bet you&#39;re finding a lot of healing through parenting your child<br/>
without all those labels and negative connotations associated with<br/>
behavior. That&#39;s so great.<br/>
