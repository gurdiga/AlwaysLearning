<div id="ygrps-yiv-1073516140">Unschooling Gathering - Camping on Long Island<br/>
<br/>
Several unschooling families will be camping at Heckscher State <br/>
Park&#39;s camp ground on Long Island, NY, from August 26th through <br/>
September 4th this summer and would welcome other unschoolers <br/>
joining the group for all or part of that time. There are still many <br/>
sites available. We&#39;ve done this in past years and it&#39;s always nice <br/>
to have other families coming and going throughout the week.<br/>
<br/>
Heckscher State Park is a short car ride away from Long Island&#39;s <br/>
barrier island ocean beaches. The park itself offers great bike <br/>
trails, a bay beach, fishing, clamming, crabbing, boat ramp into <br/>
Great South Bay (great for Kayaking and canoeing) and a huge <br/>
swimming pool along with playground, basketball courts, etc - all <br/>
within the park. While the park is huge, the campground itself is <br/>
shaded and simple as state parks tend to be, however, it does have a <br/>
decent bathhouse. The small campground office puts on a family video <br/>
in the evenings and we&#39;ve sometimes brought our own movie which the <br/>
park ranger was willing to use.<br/>
<br/>
In the past, while camping at the park, we have done many great day <br/>
trip adventures to different Fire Island ocean beaches. It&#39;s a short <br/>
20 minute drive to Robert Moses and Fire Island Ferries nearby. <br/>
Sunken Forest/Sailors Haven on Fire Island has a nature center, <br/>
nature trials and kids programs throughout the week. The Light house <br/>
at Robert Moses also has a museum tour and boardwalk trail over the <br/>
dunes. <br/>
<br/>
There is easy grocery shopping within 10 minutes from the park and a <br/>
great farm stand and health food store in Sayville less than 20 <br/>
minutes away. Also - being on Long Island - you have all <br/>
the &#39;benefits&#39; of suburban amenities you can imagine within a 20 <br/>
minute radius. We&#39;ve spent rainy days at laundry mats and Barnes & <br/>
Noble or nearby movie theaters if needed - I think there is a local <br/>
roller rink - though we&#39;ve never gone. One year we ventured to the <br/>
big water park further out on long island. Our family usually spends <br/>
one day of the camping trip driving out to Montauk early in the <br/>
morning and returning to the campground late at night. <br/>
<br/>
In the past we&#39;ve kept it pretty flexible and loose, not doing too <br/>
much planning so that families and individuals can follow their own <br/>
needs while providing a great group experience. This camping trip is <br/>
organized in such a fashion that being together doesn&#39;t mean anyone <br/>
is obligated to follow anyone else&#39;s agenda or schedule, however, <br/>
there is always a lot of overlap, shared meals, shared bike trips, <br/>
beach trips, pool trips, etc. If we&#39;re a large group, we try not to <br/>
complicate the trip by expecting or planning an entire group to do <br/>
the same thing each day throughout the week. Though group outings <br/>
are great!<br/>
<br/>
We booked site #11. Adjacent sites are available: site 10 & 12 & 20, <br/>
21 & 22. Some for the entire 8 or 9 nights some for just part of <br/>
that time. You&#39;ll find out when you go online or call reserve <br/>
america 1 800 456 camp (2267).<br/>
<br/>
If you want more information or details please feel free to contact <br/>
me directly. And feel free to spread the word to other <br/>
unschoolers/unschooling lists. <br/>

I&#39;ve put the information here, so if anyone gets interested later and  <br/>
is worried about finding it...<br/>

<br/>
But I should point out that the yahoogroups have a MUCH better search  <br/>
function in the archives than they used to have.<br/>
