<div id="ygrps-yiv-779904232"><blockquote><span title="ireply">&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I think I&#39;m going to have a major<br/>
 </span></blockquote>case of empty nest syndrome some day! (on the one hand, it&#39;s so great<br/>
that i will be able so spend so much of their lives with them, as<br/>
opposed to them living in school most of the time, but then at the<br/>
same time, it will be that much harder to see them go, having been so<br/>
close!!&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I wonder if it might be easier to someday see our children &#39;leave the nest&#39; because of the relationship that results from unschooling.  Maybe it is easier when we&#39;ve had 10 to 20 years of lots of good quality time together, rather than the more typical parent-child relationships that are full of the interuptions of daycare, school, and what not.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2010813038">Please don&#39;t worry about it now, when your kids are young. Mine are <br/>
older - 20, 17, and 14 - and, although I sometimes miss those little <br/>
kids they once were, I love the young adults they are becoming and <br/>
welcome the new kind of relationships we have. Don&#39;t dread it - look <br/>
forward to it and remember the fact that you&#39;re getting the chance to <br/>
raise the people who will eventually become your loving dearest closest <br/>
friends. You&#39;ll be glad of it, when the time comes.<br/>
