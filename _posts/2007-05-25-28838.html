<div id="ygrps-yiv-1660724910">Hi all.<br/>
<br/>
There has been so much the past several weeks that I&#39;ve wanted to<br/>
write/respond to.  But mostly, a big heartfelt thank you and posting of<br/>
gratitude - even veteran unschoolers continue to learn from everyone.<br/>
Several threads have helped me tremendously with letting go even further<br/>
with areas of my own life that need to be more deeply unschooled,<br/>
specifically in perspective to how I treat myself.  I&#39;ve made some personal<br/>
shifts which require more time than I want to give it to explain in a two<br/>
minute email.  While I am a confident unschooler in my relationship with my<br/>
children - my relationship with myself can always use adjustment.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Anyway.I&#39;ll be off line for the next 10 days or so - but couldn&#39;t head off<br/>
without at the very least acknowledging how wonderfully exceptional<br/>
unschooling life is.<br/>
<br/>
 <br/>
<br/>
Always evolving,<br/>
<br/>
