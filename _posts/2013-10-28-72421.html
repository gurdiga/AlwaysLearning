<div id="ygrps-yiv-1201648381">Hi,<p></p><div><br></div><div>We&#39;ve been unschooling for 3 years, as long as my oldest has been school-aged. &nbsp;Our kids are now 7, 4 and 1. &nbsp;I set up an auto-transfer for allowances into accounts for them, because we kept forgetting to give it to them, and they kept forgetting too... until they wanted to have some money. &nbsp;So, this way we can just keep it saving up for whenever they are interested in using it. &nbsp;Anyhow, I was thinking about money (not allowance money, just fun money), and I was thinking of fun things we could do with money. &nbsp;There were lots of ideas. &nbsp;But I had one idea that I can&#39;t tell if it &#39;exists&#39; by googling, so I wanted to see if anyone has heard of this?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I recently got interested in the idea of micro-loans, and crowdsourcing. &nbsp;They are pretty cool ideas. &nbsp;And as a kid I was always fascinated by the thought of &#39;sponsoring a child&#39; (you know those TV shoes by WorldVision that would be on a channel for hours?). &nbsp;Combining those interests (funding cool projects, being a kid, helping kids), I was wondering if anyone has heard of a kids lending to kids sort of organization. &nbsp;I think it might be fun to give a small loan to some kid&#39;s business start up and see where it goes. &nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>There is kiva.org, which is micro-loans, which is where this started recently. &nbsp;I&#39;m still mulling over whether I want to lend to anyone there. &nbsp;So this isn&#39;t all about the kids, and I&#39;ll do it myself if/when I want to. &nbsp;But I thought they might enjoy browsing the possible investments too, even more if the possibilities related to kids projects.</div><div><br></div><div>Thanks,</div><div>Shira</div></div>
