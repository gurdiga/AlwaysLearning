&gt;curds, it saves a bundle over buying it.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I love to bake, and I love lemon.  I sort of know what<br/>
crumpets are, but would someone mind explaining for<br/>
me?  Also, what are lemon curds and how do you make<br/>
them Ren?  I do remember The lovely creamy ice cream<br/>
that they sold in carts all over London and Devonshire<br/>
when I was there several years ago.  Yumm...<br/>
