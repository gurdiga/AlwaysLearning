<div id="ygrps-yiv-1763142547">Hello, and I hope you are doing well! I just want to share a legit <br/>
stay-at-home income I&#39;ve found, <br/>
since I know they are few and far between.   My parents never thought <br/>
I would make it as a teen mom  boy were they wrong! <br/>
<br/>
I love staying home with my 5 year old daughter! With homeschooling <br/>
for my daughter, and university for me,  we are a very busy household <br/>
as you can imagine.  The MommyCash Newsletter has been perfect work <br/>
for me ~ my job is so flexible, I can work around my own schedule <br/>
which is a MUST with little ones around! After all the scams, MLM, <br/>
and pyramids I&#39;ve sifted through this is something I can feel good <br/>
about doing.<br/>
<br/>
I have only been working with the Newsletter now for about 6 weeks. I <br/>
have made $1500 so far and haven&#39;t even had a whole lot of time to <br/>
devote to it, maybe 14 hrs. a week. It is really simple and Liz is so <br/>
great to work with!  She and I both will help you every step of the <br/>
way. I look forward to hopefully working with you. You can see July&#39;s <br/>
Issue of the MommyCash Newsletter at<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.geocities.com/mommycash/july.html">http://www.geocities.com/mommycash/july.html</a><br/>
<br/>
I get some type of payment almost every day (sometimes $30, sometimes <br/>
$90, or more, depending on how much work I&#39;ve done). If I can do it <br/>
so can you!!  It is VERY simple.<br/>
<br/>
The MommyCash Newsletter is rapidly expanding!  We are looking for <br/>
moms who want to work <br/>
from home for both part-time and full-time pay. Work around your own <br/>
schedule. No experience is <br/>
needed!  We will train but you must have a computer that has online <br/>
access. No selling required. All work is done from home.<br/>
<br/>
You must put code 85488 in the subject line when you reply, and if <br/>
you do decide to join, make <br/>
sure you put 85488 in the referral or code number line ~ that is how <br/>
we will make our money.<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested feel free to reply to me at the email listed in <br/>
the header of this message. I will be more then  happy to send you <br/>
some more information.  Any and all questions are welcome! =)<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>

my letter and that I was complaining about spam.  We&#39;ll see if she pays any <br/>
attention.<br/>
