<div id="ygrps-yiv-1571844817">Not totally off topic, because it&#39;s about my Big Book of Unschooling.<br/>
<br/>
For one thing, to make it more useful to more people, there&#39;s a new  <br/>
review of it, just this evening:<br/>
<br/>
<a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://whenkateblogs.blogspot.com/2010/01/sandra-dodds-big-book-of-unschooling.html">http://whenkateblogs.blogspot.com/2010/01/sandra-dodds-big-book-of-unschooling.html</a><br/>
<br/>
But my real question is...<br/>
Last summer or fall someone from this list (I think) e-mailed me  <br/>
privately about having the book on Amazon, and I wanted to correspond  <br/>
again about that.  I can&#39;t find the e-mail and I don&#39;t remember who it  <br/>
was.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
Sandra</div>
