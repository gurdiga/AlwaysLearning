<div id="ygrps-yiv-425012924">A friend and I were having a discussion about providing opportunities for<br/>
our children. Her son goes to school, but it is one of those &#39;different and<br/>
experiential schools&#39;, not regular school, and it sounds like it is like an<br/>
unschooling home right there in the school, though of course not completely.<br/>
As a result, she has many ways of looking at things I find here on this<br/>
list.<br/>
<br/>
She was talking about giving her child the freedom to explore all kinds of<br/>
learning, and how she will buy him all kinds of toys and things he wants to<br/>
&#39;experiment and play&#39; with, without worrying if they are educational or not.<br/>
<br/>
What remained with me after the conversation is how essential is this? I<br/>
don&#39;t have the kind of financial freedom she does, and it is likely that I<br/>
am not going to be able to afford many things that catch his fancy and<br/>
provide wonderful learning opportunities, though I will buy what and how<br/>
much I can.<br/>
<br/>
She was speaking of a difficulty in finances herself, where he loved riding<br/>
his friend&#39;s bicycle and wanted one of his own, which she was saving for,<br/>
but each time he wanted other things, she ended up using that money. I could<br/>
relate. I earn more than her, but I also have three dependent adults in the<br/>
house, so I end up broke at the end of every month.<br/>
<br/>
My instant feeling was remembering my own childhood, and how not getting<br/>
stuff didn&#39;t really destroy my creativity, but channeled it in other ways. I<br/>
have saved, I have created objects I wanted to buy on my own, I have traded<br/>
with friends, have found other things to immerse myself into that were<br/>
equally fascinating (everything is fascinating for me). On the other hand, I<br/>
was never into things so much as process (everything I wanted was always<br/>
&#39;raw material&#39; for my desire rather than the object of my desire), so I<br/>
can&#39;t say that her son, or my son (in the future) will be like that. I can&#39;t<br/>
KNOW that its okay.<br/>
<br/>
I thought more, and more and more it seemed that there had to be something<br/>
else that I don&#39;t see.<br/>
<br/>
I remembered Sandra&#39;s words on there being more than black and white,<br/>
and thought I&#39;d bring this thing here and see how other experienced parents<br/>
managed such dilemmas.<br/>
<br/>
I would like some perspectives on how you deal with desires that you cannot<br/>
fulfill with a child who doesn&#39;t really understand money or beyond &#39;this<br/>
moment&#39;, so those spontaneous small toys and bicycle are all equally<br/>
important in the moment he wants them? Of course, no one, however rich can<br/>
afford absolutely everything their child wants, but I was hoping to see how<br/>
do you approach this situation. Is there a line you draw in terms of budget,<br/>
or choosing which desires to fulfill, or try to help him learn what is<br/>
essentially my money problem though it impacts him...? My friend&#39;s dilemma<br/>
is something I have no answer for, but I sense the question coming up on my<br/>
horizon too. Do I fulfill 50 small desires for objects that may sometimes be<br/>
similar and will not last long, or that one desire that has been consistent<br/>
for a long time (and seems like its going to stay), but requires far more<br/>
financial resource?<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1542724817">We always took a lot of time in stores when we went shopping so that Karl<br/>
could play with the toys in the store. If a toy was packaged in such a way<br/>
that he couldn&#39;t really play with it, we talked together about what it does<br/>
and how it might work (how Karl thinks it works?) and converse about it for<br/>
a bit then pointed out another toy I thought he might be interested in too<br/>
and started talking about that toy. And on and on and on. With no need to<br/>
actually buy any of these toys.  Even now that he&#39;s older, Karl doesn&#39;t have<br/>
to BUY the toy to &quot;have&quot; it for a time. And I would usually get something<br/>
reasonably priced for what we could afford at the time after Karl had had a<br/>
lot of time to experiment with the store&#39;s variety of toys.  And he was<br/>
perfectly fine with the experience and a little something to take home with<br/>
him, and sometimes he actually declined taking anything home.  He&#39;s still<br/>
like that even at 6.  Right now I want to get him is a bike to replace to<br/>
all the kiddie bikes he&#39;s outgrown. It&#39;s currently uppermost on my mental<br/>
list of things to get him.  Also I get stuff online that I know he would<br/>
like which are more cheaply available online.  I surprise him with it during<br/>
a lull in the midst of his other interests when he&#39;s going through a not so<br/>
interesting moment. :)  It&#39;s good to have those things on hand.<br/>

<br/>
Maybe by not seeing it as a dilemma. &lt;g&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Too strong a word for choices in the moment.  You don&#39;t need to make  <br/>
one giant decision about your whole life.<br/>
<br/>
-=-I would like some perspectives on how you deal with desires that  <br/>
you cannot<br/>

moment&#39;, so those spontaneous small toys and bicycle are all equally<br/>
important in the moment he wants them?-=-<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t understand this question.  I don&#39;t understand the &quot;all equally  <br/>
important&quot; aspect of it.<br/>
<br/>
-=-Do I fulfill 50 small desires for objects that may sometimes be<br/>

consistent<br/>
for a long time (and seems like its going to stay), but requires far  <br/>

<br/>
That&#39;s not a question anyone here can answer.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
It doesn&#39;t need to cost money to catch someone&#39;s fancy.<br/>
Your child is too little for toys yet, so maybe let these ideas  <br/>
percolate and make decisions when the time comes.  If you worry about  <br/>
a bicycle before he can walk, what you&#39;ve created is worry.<br/>
