<br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;&gt;I wonder if someone could show by an analysis of my books what religion?  <br/>
&gt;&gt;If so, it might be Anthropologeism or Dabblation.  I have lots of Bibles, <br/>
&gt;&gt;but more Zen books.  I&#39;m not afraid of Beavis and Butthead or Kyle and <br/>
&gt;&gt;Cartman. I like humorous surprise.  What religion is that?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>How about The Church of the Subgenious, which shares the sacred teachings of <br/>
J.R. &quot;Bob&quot; Dobbs? &quot;Researching the Public&#39;s Fear of the Unknown Since 1953!&quot;<br/>
<br/>
And including the TriPrimality:<br/>
<br/>
&quot;Bob&quot;is.<br/>
&quot;Bob&quot; becomes.<br/>
&quot;Bob&quot; is not.<br/>
Nothing is;Nothing becomes;<br/>
Nothing is not.<br/>
<br/>
Thus: Nothing is everything.<br/>
Therefore: Everything is &quot;Bob.&quot;<br/>

Or everything is something?<br/>
<br/>
(I have Bob Dobbs books too, so everything is something religious or humorous <br/>
around here, or both.)<br/>

Anyone unfamiliar with the Church of the Subgenius, and who can take some <br/>
shock, might want to peek here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="http://www.subgenius.com">http://www.subgenius.com</a><br/>

It&#39;s stupid, but sometimes stupidity is a nice vacation, and somtimes <br/>
outrageous nonsense kick-starts the senses.<br/>
