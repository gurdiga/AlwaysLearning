&lt;&lt; Well, I watched a few of the movies, and now I am very excited about <br/>
 the possibilities of watching more movies, and learning more things, <br/>
 for ME! &gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Isn&#39;t it GREAT Pat!! Congratulations...it&#39;s so awesome when that epiphany <br/>
hits you between the eyes (or heart).<br/>
I&#39;m just going to tell you a little bit about the last few days to help you <br/>
see how that very thing you just figured out will continue working.<br/>
<br/>
My ds loves Chinese lettering and dragons...pretty much anything Chinese.  <br/>
Well instead of trying to teach him anything about China, I started learning <br/>
for ME.<br/>
I just won a bid for some old Chinese coins and a Chinese cookbook. Ds is <br/>
totally thrilled about the coins and is paying for them himself.<br/>
I read up on the language and some of the difficulties of translation to a <br/>
syllabic language like our own, then copied some symbols for him to look at. <br/>
Just showed them to him and left it at that. What he does (or doesn&#39;t do) <br/>
with them is completely up to him. We found an incredible China town, <br/>
complete with The Great Wall of China replica in Orlando that we can visit.<br/>
I found a really awesome Chinese calligraphy set that I plan to buy. I <br/>
totally approached it as a new thing to learn myself though....not to impart <br/>
anything to him.<br/>
And in the process he stayed  really excited, because I&#39;m just being excited <br/>
with him and letting his interest teach ME.<br/>
I also went off on some tangents of my own...Ocarinas, bone flutes, pan <br/>
pipes, all sorts of funky instruments.<br/>
It&#39;s great how each persons interests flow over to others in the family at <br/>
times.<br/>
The key is to maintain a childlike interest, a curiosity yourself.<br/>
The kids know when you feel you must impart something, and they avoid you.<br/>
They will just as easily pick up on your excitement when you&#39;re just learning <br/>
because it&#39;s fun.  Sometimes they don&#39;t act like they even notice...but later <br/>
it usually comes back around and you will have those &quot;aha!&quot; moments.<br/>
Keep on having fun.  It&#39;s a huge healing process you&#39;ve been going through.<br/>
Isn&#39;t it funny how we are SO concerned with what our children &quot;need&quot; to learn <br/>
and not even realize that we are so damaged we don&#39;t have much curiosity <br/>
ourselves?<br/>
Unschooling can heal all of that.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-2013691375">On another list there was a question about how to start homeschooling a child <br/>
at age 7 and graduate at age 18.  Because if you start at 7 the child would <br/>
be 19 when he graduated.  This was an NC question where the compulsory <br/>
attendance is 7-16.  I answered something like there is no law saying what <br/>
you have to teach or that you have to teach at all etc etc, all the unschooly <br/>
types of answers.  Anyway there were so many responses that talked about <br/>
doing 2 years curriculum in 1 year.  About extending the school year by a <br/>
month or two to make up for that etc.  <br/>
<br/>
 I am really starting to get it.  I mean why people have such a hard time <br/>
wrapping their mind around the concept of unschooling.  They are so sunk into <br/>
the &quot;public school system&quot; that they can&#39;t even begin to think outside the <br/>
box.  Can&#39;t conceive of skipping grades or any of that &quot;schooly&quot; stuff let <br/>
alone the concept of just not doing &quot;school&quot;.  To them I must just seem so <br/>
far out there.  Like the crazy lady who talks to herself.  That would be me.  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We had the curriculum show and tell last night.  It was fun.  There were some <br/>
people that still have children in school that were coming to see what was <br/>
out there.  They were so interested.  And there were a couple that I knew <br/>
would just never get unschooling.  Not just would decide it wasn&#39;t for them <br/>
but would really never understand.  LOL.  There were a couple of moms who are <br/>
unit study types and I could just see the light bulbs go on when, after <br/>
talking for 1/2 hour, finally got it.  LOL<br/>
Anyway I am rambling now.<br/>

Our local homeschool support group gets together and everyone brings what <br/>
they are using this year.  They like to have something from all the different <br/>
types of curriculums out there, all the different companies. It gives people <br/>
a chance to see things before they go to the curriculum fair at the state <br/>
conference. It is real casual, the items are set out on tables for people to <br/>
come in and look at.  Homeschoolers, people interested from the community <br/>
etc.  You just chit chat and answer questions about whatever it is you are <br/>
using, like how you like it etc.  I asked first before I went to make sure <br/>
that I would be welcome.  This is a very Christian homeschooling, school at <br/>
home area.  LOL. (Not that there is anything wrong with being Christian...did <br/>
I get that out in time) LOL.  My table was actually very popular.  Maybe it <br/>
was like being the three headed pig a the circus side show.  Everyone had to <br/>
see me.  LOL<br/>
Anyway that is what we did and it was good my boys were there and Jackson <br/>
also.  A family effort.  <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1402704674">Yes.  It&#39;s the Home Educator&#39;s Cooperative of the Mid-Columbia.  &quot;The purpose of the Home Educators&#39; Cooperative of the Mid-Columbia (HEC) is to create a cooperative and supportive community of homeschooling families without regard to educational, political or religious philosophy. It is envisioned as a base for activities, outings and workshops, to meet the needs and interests of both novice and seasoned homeschoolers across the region.&quot;<br/>
<br/>
The group isn&#39;t very active right now.  It is really a cooperative, so there are no &quot;leaders&quot; making things happen.  There is a small group meeting weekly at a park and we have a yahoo group with about 70 folks on it.  I&#39;m the moderator.   I&#39;ve had a few people leave the yahoo group because, they said, they couldn&#39;t keep up with the volume of email.  Our busiest month ever had 240 emails.  That was for the entire month.  Most months are well below 200.  Days go by without a single email.  I think those people should join unschooling.com for a week, then they will see what too many emails look like!<br/>
<br/>
Our group sponsors field trips, arranges group orders from Scholastic, and has occasional meetings on a variety of homeschool topics.  We even had David Albert come speak to us, and I got to have him stay at my house.  That was really cool!<br/>
<br/>
It is not an unschooling group.  There are a few unschoolers, as well as some real school at homers, and other varieties too.  I will say though, that overall it is a very supportive group of people, even though our approaches to homeschooling are all very different.  Not to mention that our approaches to religion and politics are also very different.  More than a few of the families joined our group because they weren&#39;t the right kind of Christian for the local bible based group.  We also have atheists, agnostics, and a Jewish family.<br/>
<br/>
That is probably more than you wanted to know :-)<br/>
