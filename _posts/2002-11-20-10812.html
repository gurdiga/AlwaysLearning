<div id="ygrps-yiv-1334511801">I&#39;ve been reading this thread about the girl and managed to keep my mouth shut for a while here.  But this bothers me.  I have to say it.<br/>
<br/>
You said in your most recent post that this girl would have to prove herself to you in order for you to trust her again.  What do you mean by that exactly?  How can she prove herself if not by coming to sekll candy and NOT stealing?  Didn&#39;t she do that?  You said yourself she didn&#39;t steal the second time.  What more proof do you need?<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t want you to take this too personally but in some ways it sounds like you&#39;re looking for bad in this girl.  The way you quickly assumed that she stole the money the second time with *absolutely no evidence* to back up the assumption hints at this.<br/>
<br/>
The truth is you don&#39;t really have any proof that she stole the &#39;first&#39; dollar.  You say that she eventually confessed to it in front of you and her grandmother but if she denied it to begin with and if you continued to press the issue after her denial she may have seen a false confession as the quickest way out of a very uncomfortable situation.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 9 or so I had a close friend who was stealing things from a school stockroom.  When her mom found her stash she confronted her and she told her that I had stolen it.  I didn&#39;t even know anything about it so when my parents confronted me with what they *knew* I had done, boy was I surprised.  But no matter how much I denied it they were sure I had done it and were ready to punish me for it *and* for lying about it.  So I apologized for stealing the stuff and promised never to do it again.  And I haven&#39;t.  :)  Maybe Sandra is right about the Marines.  Maybe I&#39;ve known too many adults who jump to conclusions so I don&#39;t trust them as a group now.  Maybe that&#39;s why this whole story is sitting so wrong with me.<br/>
<br/>
Or lets say she did take the dollar.  maybe she did.  And then she saw that she didn&#39;t get away with it.  Wised up and decided not to do it again.  Good.<br/>
<br/>
You also say she asked someone for money and this bothers you.  But again you didn&#39;t &#39;see&#39; it yourself.  You mentioned that sometimes people were offering the girls money.  Is it possible someone just gave it to her?  You say there is a witness.  Is it possible they misunderstood the situation?  Or maybe someone gave another child money and this girl saw and asked for one as well.  Not exactly proper, it&#39;s true.  But not a crime either.  And certainly better than stealing.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe all that would be needed was to have a little group meeting about what&#39;s expected during candy sales to make them &#39;proffesional&#39;.  Make a rule and let it be known that the girls are not allowed to accept &#39;tips&#39;.  And if people want to give them money they should tell them they can&#39;t accept it but that if the would like to go ahead and make a donation they certainly can.  The donation jar is right over there...<br/>
<br/>
It sounds as if this girl might just rub you the wrong way.  You mentioned that she&#39;s a different race than yourself.  I would hate to think there is any racism in your group.  As that is obviously not how groups like this should be.  You have a right to not like this girl.  You have a right to dispise her even.  But I don&#39;t really think that in your capacity as a group leader that you have any right to let your feelings get in the way of treating this girl like you would any of the other children.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you don&#39;t take any of this too personally.  You&#39;re getting an unfair share of my frustration with adults in leadership positions who don&#39;t respect the kids they are dealing with.  I&#39;m sure you respect them very much.  But My MIL who teaches 6th grade was just telling me how DUMB particular kids in her class are.  So you&#39;re getting some of her share of my frustration becase I don&#39;t know you and I can&#39;t tell her what a horrible pig she is.  So I am sorry if this was more than needed to be said :)<br/>
<br/>
Peace,<br/>

<br/>
My brother is a thief.  He&#39;s my half brother, both his parents were extreme <br/>
alcoholics, my mom didn&#39;t know she was pregnant until five months in, and was <br/>
passing-out drunk the night he was born.  He&#39;s nearly 30.  He&#39;s never going <br/>
to have a real conscience.  There have been times he&#39;s gone a week without <br/>
stealing anything.  But I&#39;m telling you, do NOT let him have access to your <br/>
things.  Don&#39;t.  It&#39;s not our opinion of him that made him steal.  It&#39;s his <br/>
inability to hold a job, his desire/need of alcohol and drugs, and his lack <br/>
of conscience.<br/>
<br/>
To try to make decent people feel bad every time they rightly suspect someone <br/>
who has proven untrustworthy doesn&#39;t help the situation.<br/>
<br/>
If my hopes and blind trust and love and encouragement could have changed my <br/>
brother, he would be a saint.  People loved him when he was little and took <br/>
care of him, but it&#39;s beyond others&#39; influence at some point.<br/>
<br/>

You never had.<br/>
But did you trust your friend after that?  Did you trust her not to steal?  <br/>
Did you trust her to be truthful to or about you?  Are you still friends with <br/>
her?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Or lets say she did take the dollar.  maybe she did.  And then she saw that <br/>
she didn&#39;t get away with it.  Wised up and decided not to do it again.  <br/>
Good.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
One closely watched &quot;success&quot; doesn&#39;t prove a change.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe she never will again.  Too soon to say.<br/>
<br/>
Reclaiming a reputation isn&#39;t a one-to-one correspondence.  One truth doesn&#39;t <br/>
make up for one lie.  Maybe TEN.  If you litter, it&#39;s not enough just not to <br/>
litter the next time.  You need to make amends and pick up some other <br/>
people&#39;s trash, maybe, or be EXTRA vigilant to be the least littery of anyone <br/>
around you for a long time.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It sounds as if this girl might just rub you the wrong way.  You mentioned <br/>

<br/>
Wow.  This is a leap.  Nobody said anything LIKE &quot;despise.&quot;   Did you really <br/>
read all the stuff that lead up to this?<br/>
<br/>
-=-in your capacity as a group leader that you have any right to let your <br/>
feelings get in the way -=-<br/>
<br/>
Are you recommending that it is the duty of a group leader to ignore all <br/>
feelings and knowledge, first or second hand, and NOT use her own judgment?  <br/>
That&#39;s nonsense.  Leadership involves judgment of what&#39;s safe, good, <br/>
productive, etc.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>But she did ask a stranger for money.  Besides, she has ample opportunity to <br/>
prove herself in other ways without attending the last 2 candy sales of the <br/>
year.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The way you quickly assumed that she stole the money the second time with <br/>
*absolutely no evidence* to back up the assumption hints at this.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t think &quot;quickly&quot; is an accurate term, given what I said about my <br/>
thought process at the time:<br/>
<br/>
&quot; However, when I get home with the money from the sale, the drawer was $10<br/>
 short.  Now, I KNOW that there are a hundred other explanations to why that<br/>
 could be.  I could have given someone change for a $20 instead of a $10, it<br/>
 could have blown away, etc.  Our candy is $4/box, so it&#39;s probably not an<br/>
 accounting error.  Besides all our inventory is correct, etc.  But  this is<br/>
 very suspicious.  I have no evidence that says she could have taken it, <br/>
other<br/>
 than her bad reputation.  I did find the lid of the money box kind of  ajar <br/>
a<br/>
 couple of times, and I know at least once I had left it that way, and the<br/>
 other time I was surprised and thought I&#39;d locked it back. &quot;<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;The truth is you don&#39;t really have any proof that she stole the &#39;first&#39; <br/>
dollar.  You say that she eventually confessed to it in front of you and her <br/>
grandmother but if she denied it to begin with and if you continued to press <br/>
the issue after her denial she may have seen a false confession as the <br/>
quickest way out of a very uncomfortable situation.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Her grandmother wasn&#39;t there.  This was no interrogation under a spot light.  <br/>
We had a conversation with her, in which she eventually saw that she was <br/>
trapped and she admitted it.  Besides, her cousin saw her take the dollar, <br/>
accused her of it right on the spot, and she denied it.  I, too, once <br/>
admitted to doing something I didn&#39;t do just to get out of a bad situation.  <br/>
This is not what happened.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;You also say she asked someone for money and this bothers you.  But again <br/>
you didn&#39;t &#39;see&#39; it yourself.  You mentioned that sometimes people were <br/>
offering the girls money.  Is it possible someone just gave it to her?  You <br/>
say there is a witness.  Is it possible they misunderstood the situation?  Or <br/>
maybe someone gave another child money and this girl saw and asked for one as <br/>
well.  Not exactly proper, it&#39;s true.  But not a crime either.  And certainly <br/>
better than stealing.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Have you read what I wrote?  Someone heard her ask, &quot;Can I have a quarter?&quot;  <br/>
<br/>
Begging doesn&#39;t bother you?  If you walked up to a table where they were <br/>
selling Girl Scout Cookies and one of the children asked you that question, <br/>
would you give them a quarter?  What else would you think?  What would you <br/>
think about Girl Scouts, or that Scout leader?<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;Maybe all that would be needed was to have a little group meeting about <br/>
what&#39;s expected during candy sales to make them &#39;proffesional&#39;.  Make a rule <br/>
and let it be known that the girls are not allowed to accept &#39;tips&#39;.  And if <br/>
people want to give them money they should tell them they can&#39;t accept it but <br/>
that if the would like to go ahead and make a donation they certainly can.  <br/>
The donation jar is right over there...&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
If it had ever occurred to me that any of the children would think it was <br/>
okay to ask for money and then put it in their pocket, I would have mentioned <br/>
it to them.  This is a new one for me, although I have been asked for money <br/>
and other things by children here before.<br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;It sounds as if this girl might just rub you the wrong way.  You mentioned <br/>
that she&#39;s a different race than yourself.  I would hate to think there is <br/>
any racism in your group.  As that is obviously not how groups like this <br/>

dispise her even.  But I don&#39;t really think that in your capacity as a group <br/>
leader that you have any right to let your feelings get in the way of <br/>
treating this girl like you would any of the other children.&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
You&#39;re making a lot of assumptions.  I don&#39;t let my feelings dictate my <br/>
actions.  I do, however, allow my actions to be informed by my experiences.  <br/>
<br/>
I mentioned her race because it is my experience that the small children who <br/>
asked me for money on the street, and the pre-teens who have asked me for the <br/>
last piece of pizza on my table at Chuck E. Cheese have all been of this <br/>
girl&#39;s race.  I feel these actions are evidence of a cultural difference <br/>
between my race and theirs, and I am willing to accept that, and I fully <br/>
realize I don&#39;t have to participate in those transactions.  But I can&#39;t have <br/>
those transactions happen in the context of our fundraiser.  Ideally, the <br/>
children would be on board with the fact that the money they are offered <br/>
should be part of a donation to the club, and not for their own pockets.  I <br/>
don&#39;t care what they do on their own time.  <br/>
<br/>
&lt;&lt;So you&#39;re getting some of her share of my frustration becase I don&#39;t know <br/>
you and I can&#39;t tell her what a horrible pig she is.  So I am sorry if this <br/>
was more than needed to be said :)&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Well, some of these folks have met me.  Let&#39;s take a poll.  ;)<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1412983837">Yes, but this girl isn&#39;t a drunk or a habitual liar.  She&#39;s an 8 year <br/>
old who may or may not have taken a dollar.  One time.  ANd hasn&#39;t <br/>
done anything terribley unreiable since.  People do make mistakes.  <br/>
And I do think that as leaders it would be our job to help them but <br/>
not to pass judgment on them for one bad act.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe that&#39;s just me.  But that is my opinion.  Yes I have been <br/>
reading it.  I realize Tuck has said she loved the girl.  Wants to do <br/>
what she can for her.  But underneath there was something about this <br/>
girl doing something (ask for money) that she didn&#39;t like.  And then <br/>
she added that the girl was a different race and maybe it was a <br/>
cultural thing.  And that she couldn&#39;t get over that.  Not everyone <br/>
has the same strong feelings on this as Tuck.  Clearly &#39;begging&#39; for <br/>
money hits her deeply.  Apparently it doesn&#39;t hit this girl the same <br/>
way.  Apparently it didn&#39;t bother the person who gave her the money.  <br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t know all of the situation and I&#39;m not claiming to.  I was <br/>
just trying to share my gut reactions with tuck so maybe she could <br/>
see the other side.  And actually I am still friends with the girl <br/>
who accused me of stealing.  Many years later.  Because I didn&#39;t hold <br/>
this one event against her.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>I agree that Ideally they should be.  You know that.  I know that.  <br/>
But unless you have made that clear to them.  They may just not know <br/>
that!  I&#39;d like to think people would just grow up knowing such <br/>
things.  They don&#39;t.  I used to work in fast food.  When they trained <br/>
us they told us we weren&#39;t allowed to accept tips.  These were <br/>
adults.  But they still told us.  It covers everyones but if you <br/>
don&#39;t just assume everyone has the same values as you.  This way if <br/>
they ever saw you at work putting some money in you&#39;re pocket there <br/>
would be no chance of confusion.<br/>
<br/>
As I said maybe I&#39;m wrong.  But if I were the girl.  it would bother <br/>
me to not be allowed to be involved in any more sales.  Of course as <br/>
you said she&#39;s met her quota.  Maybe she won&#39;t know the difference.<br/>

quarter I would give it to them.  If they demanded it I wouldn&#39;t.  At <br/>

the leader about it.  I wouldn&#39;t give her the quarter.  Which someone <br/>
obviously did.  So it apparently didn&#39;t bother that person!<br/>

People in grogery stores give my kids money.  Just for being cute.  I <br/>

make my kids refuse the money as it makes these older people in the <br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1195101156">This whole conversation really bothers me.  I could go out and look in <br/>
the archives and get your exact quotes, but it seems to me that you <br/>
brought up race.  You brought up cultural differences.  <br/>
<br/>
My opinion of this is simple. I think you don&#39;t like this child.  That&#39;s <br/>
OK, not everyone can like every child.<br/>
<br/>
All kids steal.  They do so for different reasons.  A couple of weeks <br/>
ago my 4 year old said off handedly that when she needed extra quarters <br/>
she woudl go into the quarter collection in the girl scout stuff.  I <br/>
thought she was kidding until I looked and realized that there was money <br/>
missing.  Is it because she is black?  No, it&#39;s because she&#39;s 4 and <br/>
doesn&#39;t understand things.  My 7 year old was taking the cash that I&#39;d <br/>
take out of my jeans and putting it in her banks.  I saw her one time <br/>
and asked her to please let me know or ask me before, because I might <br/>
have needed that money for something.  No big deal.  We share in this <br/>
family and she assumed, for good reason, that we share money too.  We do.  <br/>
<br/>
As a former teacher I had a few kids steal from me.  I just gave them <br/>
more, more love, more attention.  I kept food in my classroom as many of <br/>
them were hungry.  And sometimes I gave them money so they could buy <br/>
from the bake sell or whatever.  It was im portant to them, for many <br/>
different reasons.  But these reasons had more to do with their home <br/>
life and little to do with their race or culture.  <br/>
<br/>
how do you know the girl didn&#39;t get  the quarter from a family member. <br/>
 A few weeks ago at our booth sale, one of the girls ran up to a strange <br/>
woman and the woman gave her some money, then walked away. I quickly <br/>
caught up to the woman and asked what was going on.  Ends up she was the <br/>
child&#39;s aunt.  We sell in our neighborhood so the girls often know the <br/>
people who are shopping, they are family members or neighbors.  We have <br/>
an elderly neighbor who always gives the girls money, candy, little toys.  <br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I am rambling.  You asked our opinion on this issue and <br/>
then you are mad because you don&#39;t like what we are saying.<br/>
<br/>
I still would ike to know the race of the child and your own race.<br/>
<br/>
joylyn<br/>
<br/>
Asian folks drive crazy. I know this because I live in a city that is <br/>
mostly asian and they all drive crazy.  They drive slow or fast, don&#39;t <br/>
signal, and it&#39;s because of where they come from.  It&#39;s part of their <br/>
culture.  <br/>
<br/>
Black people steal.  So do hispanics.  It&#39;s part of their culture.  <br/>
<br/>
These comments are rude and stereotyping and not acceptable.  <br/>

I understood your initial post about the child being of a different race<br/>
to mean that you meant a cultural difference.  I think maybe this<br/>
particular poster took offense to the word &#39;race&#39;, as it is not used<br/>
interchangeably with culture.  For example, I have friends that are a<br/>
different &#39;race&#39; than I am but culturally come from very similar<br/>
backgrounds.  <br/>
<br/>
I certainly felt that your meaning was clear, but I&#39;m thinking the term<br/>
used was a stumbling block...<br/>
<br/>
What comes through loud and clear is your true concern for this child and<br/>
I don&#39;t think anyone questions that...<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-41460259">Tuck, Theresa and all,<br/>
<br/>
As a Puerto Rican black woman, as someone who has always been the <br/>
&quot;other&quot;, I have to add to this from a different perspective.<br/>
<br/>
That child knows you treat her differently for what she is. Believe <br/>
me, she knows.<br/>
<br/>
You may have wanted to do the right thing but your main concern is <br/>
for the integrity of the group. Your main concern is to keep the <br/>
peace. Most certainly your main concern is to show her who&#39;s boss. <br/>
That is what leaders do.<br/>
<br/>
I have so many stories of people trying to do right because I was the <br/>
&quot;other race&quot; or the &quot;other culture&quot;. And this has come from people of <br/>
both sides of the fence because I was either too dark or too <br/>
light-skinned or I spoke English too well or because I just spoke <br/>
Spanish too well. The list goes on and on.<br/>
<br/>
Believe me, the do-gooding never felt sincere.<br/>
<br/>
There is nothing right now for you to do because you won. The family <br/>
of that child has already made sure that she says the right things <br/>
and does the right things so that she can fit in BECAUSE she is the <br/>
other.<br/>
<br/>
Just take this to heart ----Is her race or her culture that <br/>
important? What race or culture has ingrained in its idiosyncrasy <br/>
that, yes, it is OK to ask money from strangers?<br/>
<br/>
Let me leave with a little story:  In Spanish, if you want to use <br/>
hyperbole to describe someone&#39;s skill with money you can say, <br/>
&quot;Ese/Esa es un/a judía&quot;; or &quot;That one is a Jew&quot;.  I met my first <br/>
Jewish person when I came to finish college at NYU --I was 19 years <br/>
old. The person in question was my roommate. Talk about clash of <br/>
cultures. She was an upper middle class &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; Orthodox Jew from <br/>
Philapdelphia, I was a working class PRican black Catholic from the <br/>
island. I learned a lot from her (gosh, can&#39;t remember her name right <br/>
now) but it took me years to get that what was a common moniker used <br/>
in my family is probably one of the most racist things that you could <br/>
say. Yep, my parents were racists (especially my father) and, <br/>
ironically, they worked actively in the Civil Rights Movement. And <br/>
that makes me a recovering-racist as well.<br/>
<br/>
Which has taught me a great lesson.  People do not understand how <br/>
prejudice is so deeply ingrained in speech until someone else calls <br/>
them on it.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the day my husband (who is &quot;white&quot;) was talking about the <br/>
&quot;old&quot; Springfield; about how there was only one black kid in the <br/>
local high school, how when he was little the darkest people were <br/>
Italians and anybody Jewish lived at the other side of Main Street. <br/>
So I turned in disbelief and asked him, &quot;There were segregated towns <br/>
in NJ during the 60&#39;s?&quot; He choked on a laugh because it was the first <br/>
time he reckoned with such a thought. His parents are like the most <br/>
laid back Irish Catholics you&#39;ll ever meet; supporters of the <br/>
unionized labor and CRM movements. I am sure they never thought <br/>
anything about where they lived in the terms that most &quot;ethnics&quot; <br/>
would look at it now. This is because they were the ethnics once.<br/>
<br/>
It takes years to work on these foibles. The first step is acceptance.<br/>
<br/>

&quot;Now I just have to deal with the girl&#39;s propensity to ask people<br/>
for money for herself. I realize this is a cultural issue--she&#39;s a <br/>
different<br/>
race than me. It happens to me on occasion, little kids--strangers to<br/>
me--approaching me and asking for quarters or dollars. Even had a boy about<br/>
9 come up and ask me if he could have a piece of our pizza! I find it rude<br/>

&gt; cultural differences, and those *could* be one of the reasons, but <br/>
&gt; that is<br/>
&gt; about all I remember her saying on the subject. I really hope you aren&#39;t<br/>
&gt; trying to bait her or anyone else here into a racisim debate.<br/>

race Tuck feels is prone to begging.  <br/>

&gt; You may have wanted to do the right thing but your main concern is<br/>
&gt; for the integrity of the group. Your main concern is to keep the<br/>
&gt; peace. Most certainly your main concern is to show her who&#39;s boss.<br/>
&gt; That is what leaders do.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I have so many stories of people trying to do right because I was the<br/>
&gt; &quot;other race&quot; or the &quot;other culture&quot;. And this has come from people of<br/>
&gt; both sides of the fence because I was either too dark or too<br/>
&gt; light-skinned or I spoke English too well or because I just spoke<br/>
&gt; Spanish too well. The list goes on and on.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Believe me, the do-gooding never felt sincere.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; There is nothing right now for you to do because you won. The family<br/>
&gt; of that child has already made sure that she says the right things<br/>
&gt; and does the right things so that she can fit in BECAUSE she is the<br/>
&gt; other.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Just take this to heart ----Is her race or her culture that<br/>
&gt; important? What race or culture has ingrained in its idiosyncrasy<br/>
&gt; that, yes, it is OK to ask money from strangers?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Let me leave with a little story:  In Spanish, if you want to use<br/>
&gt; hyperbole to describe someone&#39;s skill with money you can say,<br/>
&gt; &quot;Ese/Esa es un/a judía&quot;; or &quot;That one is a Jew&quot;.  I met my first<br/>
&gt; Jewish person when I came to finish college at NYU --I was 19 years<br/>
&gt; old. The person in question was my roommate. Talk about clash of<br/>
&gt; cultures. She was an upper middle class &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; Orthodox Jew from<br/>
&gt; Philapdelphia, I was a working class PRican black Catholic from the<br/>
&gt; island. I learned a lot from her (gosh, can&#39;t remember her name right<br/>
&gt; now) but it took me years to get that what was a common moniker used<br/>
&gt; in my family is probably one of the most racist things that you could<br/>
&gt; say. Yep, my parents were racists (especially my father) and,<br/>
&gt; ironically, they worked actively in the Civil Rights Movement. And<br/>
&gt; that makes me a recovering-racist as well.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Which has taught me a great lesson.  People do not understand how<br/>
&gt; prejudice is so deeply ingrained in speech until someone else calls<br/>
&gt; them on it.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I remember the day my husband (who is &quot;white&quot;) was talking about the<br/>
&gt; &quot;old&quot; Springfield; about how there was only one black kid in the<br/>
&gt; local high school, how when he was little the darkest people were<br/>
&gt; Italians and anybody Jewish lived at the other side of Main Street.<br/>
&gt; So I turned in disbelief and asked him, &quot;There were segregated towns<br/>
&gt; in NJ during the 60&#39;s?&quot; He choked on a laugh because it was the first<br/>
&gt; time he reckoned with such a thought. His parents are like the most<br/>
&gt; laid back Irish Catholics you&#39;ll ever meet; supporters of the<br/>
&gt; unionized labor and CRM movements. I am sure they never thought<br/>
&gt; anything about where they lived in the terms that most &quot;ethnics&quot;<br/>
&gt; would look at it now. This is because they were the ethnics once.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; It takes years to work on these foibles. The first step is acceptance.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
So what&#39;s the recommendation?<br/>
<br/>
I had this three days ago from someone who grew up with me in Espanola, who <br/>
married someone from South Carolina, who has lived in Virginia for over 20 <br/>
years, whose husband is a curator at the Smithsonian:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
I can imagine how those old prejudices play into the lives of African <br/>
Americans, especially in the South.  There are such stigmas to overcome.  <br/>
Well, I guess I&#39;ll take back the &quot;especially in the South&quot; part of it, <br/>
because I know it could happen that way here, too, and probably further <br/>
north.  <br/>
<br/>
Once when I was at the National Gallery of Art with David, we were having a <br/>
snack at the cafeteria, and a black man came and sat down at the adjacent <br/>
table.  He didn&#39;t have any food, which was suspicious.  Anyway, he bent down <br/>
to tie his shoe (or so it seemed), and I thought, &quot;that guy could be stealing <br/>
my purse&quot; but dismissed it right away, judging myself to be prejudiced. He <br/>
looked right at me, too, and sort of smiled.  Anyway, he then got up and <br/>
left, and I quickly looked down and checked to make sure my purse was still <br/>
on the floor where I had put it, and it was, so I kept talking to David.  I <br/>
then decided to get up to buy an apple, and grabbed my purse, picked out an <br/>
apple, went to pay for it--and guess what?  that guy HAD stolen my wallet!  <br/>
So ever since then, I just try to be more careful.   Also, I don&#39;t carry a <br/>
purse that someone can just slide his/her hand in and grab a wallet oupected <br/>
(I guess they are innocent until proven guilty) snipers ended up being black, <br/>
too.<br/>

 </span></blockquote>So.  There&#39;s a private conversation.  Tear it up if you want to.<br/>
<br/>
Joylyn,  this is a cultural scenario:<br/>
<br/>
If you were with your girls at the New Mexico State Fair, and it was getting <br/>
dark, would you more likely shy away from a batch of teens from the Academy, <br/>
or from the same number and gender of teens if the girls had mall hair and <br/>
the guys all had hairnets and Our Lady of Guadalupe t-shirts?<br/>
<br/>
Jesse Jackson said once he was appalled that when he was walking around in <br/>
Washington he was afraid to be followed by a black man.   <br/>
<br/>
How far does colorblindness go?  Does one leave the house open to prove <br/>
trust?  Leave the car unlocked?  Equally in all neighborhoods and situations? <br/>
  Is it racist for me to worry about Marty and his friend being downtown <br/>
after a concert tomorrow night without any adults with them until Keith shows <br/>
up?  Or is it just sensible fear of the area around the Sunshine Theatre at <br/>
ANY time of day or night?  It&#39;s not a question of race or ethnicity.   A <br/>
homeschooled teen came through and asked me to leave her at the train station <br/>
one night at 3:00 a.m. or so.  NO WAY, I said.  For one thing, the train <br/>
station doesn&#39;t even have a waiting room.  Turns out it was a bus ride to El <br/>
Paso or some such to catch a train.  I wasn&#39;t leaving her at the bus station <br/>
either.  We walked her in.  <br/>
<br/>
My half brother is as anglo as they come.  His name&#39;s Justin Bradley.  If any <br/>
of you meet him, don&#39;t trust him.  He&#39;s a known habitual liar, thief, drunk <br/>
and drug user.  VERY charming and personable.  He has taken in counsellors, <br/>
parole officers, psychiatrists and judges.  <br/>
<br/>
What does all this mean?  And those who are accusing Tuck of prejudice, what <br/>
are your recommendations?<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>The first thing one must do to overcome something is to admit there is a <br/>
problem.  Denying that there is a problem doesn&#39;t solve anything. <br/>
 Beyond that I don&#39;t have a recomendation.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yes, and in california, and in New Mexico.  I do admit that I think, and <br/>
Mark agrees, that New Mexico, with it&#39;s diverse culture that is not <br/>
primarily anglo, was better than california.  I see a LOT of racism out <br/>
here in california, from people being rude to those from Mexico, to <br/>
people asking if my kids are foster children, to the fact that when my <br/>
family and I looked for a place to rent, we didn&#39;t find somethign but <br/>
when I went alone, I found somethign quickly.  That happened in New <br/>
Mexico too.  When we had foster kids (one black, one hispanic, Mark and <br/>
me), I went looking for a house to rent.  I found a nice one near UNM, <br/>
and put a deposit on it.  We met the owner 3 hours later to sign the <br/>
papers, but this time Mark and the kids came with me.  It was pretty <br/>
obvious by the look on his face he was shocked, but I was shocked when <br/>
he returned my check to me and said that he had rented the place to <br/>
someone who paid him 6 months rent in cash as well as the deposit and he <br/>
couldn&#39;t pass it up.  Racism is everywhere, it is just more subtle then <br/>
it was 30 years ago.  Personally, I prefer the in your face racist to <br/>
the subtle &quot;cultural differences&quot; closet racist who doesn&#39;t really know, <br/>
honestly, that they are being racist.  The old ladies who just LOVE my <br/>
kids, think they are so beautiful, and rave about them--they are trying <br/>
to prove to themselves that they are not racist but I see right through <br/>
them.  Just as Mark saw right through the high school counselor who <br/>
suggested he take shop or other vocational classes because he&#39;d never <br/>
make it to college anyway, and he needed a life skill.  Anyway,  the old <br/>
prejudices are alive and well.  <br/>
<br/>
Snipping some good stuff.<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Yeah it was.  Until you worry each night as your husband drives home <br/>
from a gig that he might be pulled over for DWB, people don&#39;t understand <br/>
how big that was.  How many black men were questioned until she came <br/>
forward and admitted she had murdered her own children?  A lot.  I <br/>
remember this and remember talking to Mark about it and saying I thought <br/>
she had done it, before she admitted it.  The black man excuse, it&#39;s <br/>
used all the time.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;<br/>

&gt; and<br/>
&gt; the guys all had hairnets and Our Lady of Guadalupe t-shirts?<br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Well, actually, probably the academy kids.  I&#39;ve had experience with <br/>
those brats and don&#39;t wish to have anythign to do with them.  There is <br/>
also that god awful christain school down by the freeway that used to <br/>
call the kids from our private school dropouts (how can kids going to a <br/>
private school be dropouts?) and would foul them at every opportunity <br/>
when we played sports against them.  And as I taught in the valley and <br/>
as my brother looks more like the latter group than the former, and as I <br/>
love the state fair, I probably would not shy away from either group but <br/>
would continue doing what I wished.  My brother does security at the <br/>
fair so I may have a different view point of it.<br/>
<br/>
However, Mark and Ihave also discussed this.  he will be driving down <br/>
the freeway, 70 mph, and some white lady will look over and see him and <br/>
lock her doors.  Like he&#39;s going to jump out of his moving car and get <br/>
her, please.  It is not reasonable behavior.  However, if I am alone in <br/>
an elevator, or waiting for one, and I see a man about to get on with <br/>
me, I think about it.  The color is not important, however, what my <br/>
tummy (as lexie says) indicates is important.  I have gotten off the <br/>
elevator and waited for the next one because my tummy said I wasn&#39;t <br/>
safe.  But I know that looks don&#39;t say a thing.  My brother looks <br/>
scarey.  If you saw him at the fair, you would probably walk the other <br/>
way.  He&#39;s big, very dark, long hair, and has an attitude, especially <br/>
when he&#39;s working security or just hanging around.  But he&#39;s a big baby. <br/>
 However, he gets followed in stores, always has.  We used to play a <br/>
game with th is.  He would go into a store and then be followed and I <br/>
would then follow the employee that was following him.  <br/>
<br/>
So to answer your question, I think I would think about where I was.  I <br/>
dont&#39; go on the midway at night without my brother or my husband.  I <br/>
stick to the daytime, but then, I haven&#39;t been to the fair in years--I <br/>
need to go to NM next year in early september, I miss the NM state fair. <br/>
 I think it&#39;s less about color or hairnets, etc. as it is about taking <br/>
basic precautions, listening to my insticts, and looking at more than <br/>
the cover of a person and stereotypes.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt; Jesse Jackson said once he was appalled that when he was walking <br/>
&gt; around in<br/>

<br/>
 </span></blockquote>but was he afraid of the black man or of the man?  <br/>
<br/>
When I was 18 I dated a man.  He was funny, cute, tall, had a great <br/>
smile, treated me so nice.  But when we kissed, there was nothign there. <br/>
 I remember having a discussion with my mom.  Was I racist?  I mean, <br/>
this was the first black man I had dated, is that why I felt nothing. <br/>
 My mom reminded me that perhaps the color had nothing to do with it.  I <br/>
had dated white, hispanic, etc. men before and felt nothing and just <br/>
moved on.  Wasn&#39;t that the point of dating? to see what kind of man I <br/>
liked?  And I realized, I did like this person, but there wasn&#39;t any <br/>
thing more to it, he was just a good friend.  It had nothing to do with <br/>
color, it was just that we didn&#39;t click.  <br/>
<br/>
<blockquote><span title="ireply"> &gt;   <br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; How far does colorblindness go? <br/>
<br/>

not be color blind, nor should it be focussed on color--it should just <br/>
be colorful.  <br/>
<br/>

&gt; either.  We walked her in.  <br/>
<br/>
 </span></blockquote>Of course you did.  It is silly to not take precautions in what could be <br/>
dangerous situations.  I tell my girls, and my girlscouts, that if they <br/>
get lost they should first look for an employee and second look for a <br/>
person in uniform (police, fire, etc.) and if they can&#39;t find either of <br/>
those, to go to a mother with children.  Not a dad with children, not a <br/>
single woman, not an old grandma type, but a mom with children. <br/>
 Statistically that is the safest way to get help.  But I also say trust <br/>
what your tummy says.  If you walk up to the employee and your tummy is <br/>
saying get away, then get away and find someone else.  Is that sexist to <br/>
say find a woman with children?  Probably, but it&#39;s also safest.  Mark <br/>
has said he is not offended when he is on a dark street and a woman <br/>
speeds up or crosses the street.  It is what he would expect me to do. <br/>
 it is what I would do.  But it&#39;s not about being black or white, it&#39;s <br/>
about being safe.  <br/>

what race the child in question is.  Only she can decide if there is <br/>
something more.  I did not bring up race, she did.  But race, and <br/>
racism, is a part of our world.  To deny that is stupid, and doesn&#39;t <br/>
help change come about.  Only by talking about it, thinking about it, <br/>
can we effect change.<br/>

<br/>
I know I opened myself up to criticism and misunderstanding by noting that we <br/>
were of different races.  I wanted to state right on that I believe there are <br/>
cultural differences between races and I have said that I am willing to <br/>
accept them.  I wanted to know what others think of this thing I have noticed <br/>
that I&#39;ve said I don&#39;t see in my subculture, and what others think I should <br/>
do about it.<br/>
<br/>
Except for stating the facts of the situation, and making sure no one <br/>
misstates what I said, I will not participate in any discussion of racism, <br/>
especially when it&#39;s clear any accusations are going to be flung my way.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-1430647601">**If you were with your girls at the New Mexico State Fair, and it was<br/>
getting dark, would you more likely shy away from a batch of teens from<br/>
the Academy, or from the same number and gender of teens if the girls<br/>
had mall hair and the guys all had hairnets and Our Lady of Guadalupe t-shirts?**<br/>
<br/>
I shy away from pairs and/or groups of men that don&#39;t have women with<br/>
them.  And teens and twenty-somethings often strike me as more menacing<br/>
than the middle-aged.  And really old guys don&#39;t scare me much at all.<br/>
<br/>
Prejudice, or rule of thumb, not sure which I&#39;m using.  I guess I&#39;m<br/>
prejudiced in favor of women and the middle-aged (that&#39;s me) which may<br/>
be unfair to the rest of the world.<br/>
<br/>
Some day perhaps an innocuous little old lady will take advantage of me.<br/>
 Rules of thumb ARE a form of lazy thinking.<br/>
<br/>
I don&#39;t tend to be in areas that have lots of crime in the daytime.  At<br/>
night time I try to keep my wariness of groups of men *internal* and<br/>
*equal* based on the size of the group.  I try to be equally wary of all<br/>
of them.  I&#39;m trying to iron out my racism.  But I&#39;m letting the sexism stand.<br/>

smile, treated me so nice.  But when we kissed, there was nothign there. <br/>
 I remember having a discussion with my mom.  Was I racist?  I mean, <br/>
this was the first black man I had dated, is that why I felt nothing. <br/>
 My mom reminded me that perhaps the color had nothing to do with it.  I <br/>
had dated white, hispanic, etc. men before and felt nothing and just <br/>
moved on.  Wasn&#39;t that the point of dating? to see what kind of man I <br/>
liked?  And I realized, I did like this person, but there wasn&#39;t any <br/>
thing more to it, he was just a good friend.  It had nothing to do with <br/>
color, it was just that we didn&#39;t click.  **<br/>

I, like Joylyn, caught a whiff of an implication that maybe Tuck didn&#39;t<br/>
particularly adore the girl accused of taking a dollar.  But if my<br/>
perception is true, and it isn&#39;t necessarily, I would assume that her<br/>
attitude is based on personality and chemistry not on race, as in the<br/>
example above.<br/>

<div id="ygrps-yiv-129199177">To Sandra and all,<br/>
<br/>
First of all, I made the point that I have gotten the bite of <br/>
prejudice and racism from both sides of the track --for being either <br/>
too black or too light and, yes, I have even been accused of being <br/>
too white (because I do not speak English with a Spanish accent).  So <br/>
this is not about race vs. race. My comment was about how subtle and <br/>
ingrained prejudices can be that, those who consider themselves <br/>
progressive have not reckoned with what gets them in the same band <br/>
wagon than those who hide under hooded sheets.<br/>
<br/>
Best example? My using the word Jew to describe people and not to <br/>
refer to a person who believes in Judaism. Notice that I do not refer <br/>
to Judaism as a race since I have a problem with calling Jews a race <br/>
because, obviously, they come in many colors, flavors and sizes <br/>
--Ethiopian and Chinese Jews come to mind. Now I can make that <br/>
opinion because I have had to reckoned with my (I do not what to call <br/>
it) passive/latent/unconscious prejudice. That prejudice was so <br/>
natural to me that I grew up hearing about the heroes of the Civil <br/>
Rights Movement and yet had no idea how antisemite I was. Not out of <br/>
hatred but pure ignorance.<br/>
<br/>
Comments like Tucker&#39;s do not come out of hatred but out of <br/>
ignorance. She wants to the right thing but she still cannot go past <br/>
the &quot;all the people her color/race/culture as money from me&quot; because <br/>
they are still all lumped together. It&#39;s the &quot;all Chinese people look <br/>
the same syndrome&quot;. It is when we are in the position of dealing <br/>
intimately with a person from another race or ethnicity that these <br/>
things come out to fore.<br/>
<br/>
What can you do? Nothing. Just keep a note of it. If this is a <br/>
situation, or a thought, or an action or even a conversation that has <br/>
happened more than once in your life, then you could take it as a <br/>
little wake-up call. We all could, BTW. Tucker&#39;s is an example of <br/>
what happens to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
This is not about being good or bad. Prejudice is two steps away from <br/>
bigotry but one step closer to resentment. The resentment that says, <br/>
&quot;well two people did this to me so obviously all people that look/are <br/>
like them do it so I might as well avoid them&quot;. That social kind of <br/>
resentment says blacks drop property values or Chinese are good at <br/>
math or, better yet, people of so-and-so race always beg for money. <br/>
That I find is more pervasive than bigotry. With outright bigotry you <br/>
know what&#39;s coming. Social resentment, that is the most vampiric, <br/>
energy sucking activity that bashes people down, takes away hope and <br/>
can only end up in alienation.<br/>
<br/>
So no, this is not about doing the busy doing of anything. This is <br/>
about waking up.<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>
Liza<br/>
<br/>
